It ended up taking an hour to get my order only after me asking and it wasn't even complete because Nisa said it would take longer to get the appetizer I wanted.  Because I didn't want to wait longer I said forget the appetizer so I didn't even get my full order.  This was not a large order just 2 appetizers and 2 entrees.  Even when I got home my order was wrong which was especially frustrating.  When paying I explained to Nisa that I couldn't believe she was charging me full price after waiting patiently. She reluctantly didn't charge me for an appetizer and was very rude to me afterwards.

The customer had to say to the waiter that room was tight because 10 people were waiting for their take out orders and that he wasn't starting anything.

I parked far far away and walked up my appetite. \\n\\nOverall impressions:\\nI didn't give a full 5 stars because in comparison to my experience in NY, it just seems like the food was a bit more greasy and salty than I'm used to for SS.

The Thai pork lettuce wraps were a hit with my date, who loved the marinade and the dressing. The biggest disappointments of the night were the lo mein, octopus, and spicy silky tofu, which were all so salty that we needed to order extra rice to gulp it down.

After discussing with my partner as to why they may of done that, we decided to ask them to bring our main back so we can enjoy our starter without pressure to rush. The manager looked at us and said \\" The kitchen doesn't know the difference between a starter and main and sends all food out at the same time\\", to which I asked \\" Why is it specified as a starter on the menu if there isn't truly a distinguishing difference on when it comes out\\"?

I ended up getting two:  the Maple Bacon and the Chocolate Almond Ganache. Both were delicious, but the real stand out was the maple bacon. The flavors were just so good, and the donut had such a great texture. One thing about these donuts - they are heavy. Some donuts are light and on the \\"airy\\" side, but not these donuts. I should have gotten one, but of course my head won out, and I had to get two. One was plenty, so I just saved the other one to eat a few hours later (okay maybe it was only an hour later, but who's counting.....).\\n\\nOverall, I think these donuts are really good. Pricey yes, but for a gourmet donut, I'm not going to be stopping by here on a regular basis, so a nice splurge every once in a while. Service was okay, not great, but maybe the person who helped me was not having a good day.

Some people may like eating a burger that crumbles after one touch, but I like my patty to stay a patty until it is in my belly. I like that the vegetarian patty was full of fiber, grains, and veggies, but I dislike the taste and texture. It's akin to eating dirt or mulch.

We didn't know anything about it when we pulled up, it just looked cool.  We go in, take a look at the menus, and are surprised by the reasonable prices for the gourmet burgers ($6-$8).  We had a good laugh at ourselves when they brought out the single sliders, and the prices made more sense.  Not crazy, but not cheap.  \\n\\nThey've got some interesting burgers here, but this is not a \\"have it your way\\" establishment.  You can probably get ingredients removed, but don't try to customize your burger.  The waiter discouraged us from doing so, and I reluctantly got a butcher's cut without blue cheese but with the red wine jam, only to find that the \\"jam\\" basically served the same function and had the same texture on the finished burger as a reduction.  My girlfirend and I also had fun debating about the Cheez-Whiz foam, which apparently tasted fine though on her Philly steak style burger.   I felt like I was on Iron Chef and the secret ingredient was Slider.\\n\\nFor sides we got the sweet potato tots and the onion rings.  The tots were tasty but the consistency didn't quite work, they were pretty large and didn't hold together that well.  The onion rings were FANTASTIC and were the standout attraction.  I've considered going back for just onion rings and beer but haven't had the chance.\\n\\nThe lady got a Krispy Kreme shake, which I expected to taste like a vanilla shake with ground up doughnut in it.  I was right.  Strangely, the shake and the onion rings made a wonderful pairing, and the onion rings brought out the best in the shake.  The Nutella shake and the buttercream shake just sounded like stomach aches waiting to happen so I skipped those.  Neat ideas and all, but a very high quality basic shake goes a long way, though I doubt to $7.\\n\\nAll in all, the place is worth checking out.  Be prepared for a wee, albeit unique burger, and some Chefs Gone Wild mayhem, and you'll be fine.  If you're a burger enthusiast, again, be prepared for the weeness of the burger and you can enjoy yourself."},{"name":"Blue Star Donuts","address":"1155 SW Morrison St, Ste 102","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Unique and complex flavor combinations, perfect for Portland foodies!

I did my homework on the Ethiopian places in Atlanta and this one won hands down because of all the positive reviews.

It was delicious!  Everything was hot and fresh and spicy (but not too much that it burned in a bad way).  And when our supply of injera started to get low, a waitress came around with a fresh platter of perfectly rolled replacements.\\n\\nThe service was also excellent - an attentive waiter who recommended Ethiopian beers and gave me a taster of the wine before I ordered a full glass to see if I liked the honey overtones of it.  He checked on us several times throughout the meal to make sure everything had come out and was to our liking and brought the check promptly when we were finished, yet he never rushed us either.\\n\\nAnd the ambiance of the place is very cute.

I had the Pina Rellena which pretty much exemplified this mission to me.  The menu stated that dish was inspired by the coasts and beaches and the area of Tuxtla, Veracruz, Mexico.  The dish was a combination of adobe'd shrimp and fish sauteed in tequila with sliced onions, peppers, topped with melted jack cheese, and baked in a pineapple. It was served with white rice and a crunchy salad of pico de gallo, jicama, and carrots marinated in an orange vinaigrette.  I found the dish to be full of flavor, but very subtle and not overpowering.  Honestly, this is not a refined flavor combination that I'm used to and I found the subtle flavors very pleasing.  I guess I would consider it slightly up scale (without a stuffy upscale feel) with the entrees ranging from $11.50 - $15.25, but well worth the experience.  If you're looking to feed your face (classy huh?) on mexican food, I suggest you go elsewhere because the portions are not overwhelming. There's no foot and a half burrito or gordita crunch supreme here.

The rotating specials list and small plates at Navarre however, make it virtually impossible for me to eat there without trying at least three new dishes per visit.  They do a fantastic job of working rotating delights into their menu with seasonal, fresh CSA deliveries (which also supports local farmers - hurrah) and their fixed list is always a treat as well.

However, because of a friend's birthday last night up in Marietta, I thought we'd kill two birds with one stone and first have a quick dinner at Fuddruckers.  Well, I hate to say this but I will never go back to this location.  \\n\\nI'm really not a squeamish person about cleanliness of restaurants, but this place was dirty.  Food crumbs all over the floor.  The bathroom smelled horrible and was also not clean.  There was no ice in the coke machines.  There was no sauce in many of the sauce containers. It wasn't good. \\n\\nMy food was alright, but when I've gone to other Fuddruckers, the burgers are great and this one just didn't taste the same.  The icing on the cake was that my boyfriend ordered a chocolate shake, and we were still waiting for it when they called our food order, still waiting when we finished our food.  35 minutes later we go up to the counter to just ask them to refund the money, and they do that (after waiting for them for a few minutes), and not one time did anyone at the front apologize for the wait, not once.

For Wunton (wanton, wonton?) it wasn't bad.  Kind of in-between the old fashioned Wunton from Hons and almost like the Wunton like Michigan.  This place really needn't be second fiddle to those other places.\\n\\nService was friendly, they speak English and Cantonese and a bit of Mandarin.\\nThe food comes out fast and you're always left full after a meal.\\n\\nThis particular occasion I had a mixture of feelings when it came to rating.\\n\\nThey had signage that the were open late and I guess their business has really gravitated to the late night snacks.

For my lunch, I had Wunton and (another dumpling) soup with noodles and a side dish of Tripe.\\n\\nThe Wunton noodles were quite nice.  Good lower glycemic index carbs that is better for me than pasta or udon noodles.  The Wunton and that other dumpling that I can't  spell was supposed to be an even mix between the two dumplings, but I got 3 of the \\"suey gao\\" (god I think I just butchered my attempt at naming it) and it seemed overcooked.  The dumpling skin had fallen apart on all my dumplings.  I onle got one piece of Wunton.\\n\\nSo I was a bit saddened that there wasn't an even proportion between the two dumplings and it seemed that the cook either didn't care or figures I was just a \\"short white guy in an Asian skin suit\\" and wouldn't know the difference.\\n\\nI would have given it a 4 star, but this was a borderline 3.  I'm not complaining though.\\n\\nMy tripe was different.  At other places the sauce is thicker.  This dish was like it was in a puddle of thin soup.  It was almost clean looking in comparison, well, more like watered down.  Flavour wasn't as full in comparison to the other restaurants I've compared this to.\\n\\nTo be fair, I know that the food is better.  So I'm wondering if it was a different cook? New ownership or the business has evolved somewhat?\\n\\nI love the location and this mall offers alot when it comes to food services and competition if fierce.\\n\\nHopefully they will find a way to no longer have to be second string in a concert of Wunton houses in Richmond.

The kids were getting restless because they were so hungry. WE were getting restless! However, the apps held us over until the next 25 minutes that our food came out. A couple of us had some colder food which led us to believe it had been sitting for a while. \\n\\nMy other issue is that I ordered a \\"prime rib\\" sandwich that was on a hoagie roll and was pretty much a Philly cheese steak for $13 which is overpriced IMO.

I tried pulled pork once, also excellent. If you are like me and you find good brisket then you keep getting brisket. They also have cornbread waffles which are unique and delicious. I haven't tried for breakfast yet but they do pulled pork inbetween waffles or sausage and waffles. Again, I can't stop with the brisket or I would try these other options. Sides have all been really excellent also. And they have a variety of sauce options, try the pepper sauce in place of salsa on the tacos. Or with Salsa. All good.

He and his posse get together on the first Friday of every month to drink, laugh, carouse and - of course - eat! In addition to planning a nice dinner out with the family, I thought it would be cool and memorable to plan a night out for the dudes - a Boys Night. With assistance from one of my dad's epicurean pals, we created a shortlist of restaurants that could accommodate our group of 12 and that we have both wanted to patronize. In the end, the winning restaurant was the highly-touted Les Faux Bourgeois, which I had been rejected by twice over the past year due to its popularity and small capacity. I really like Jules too, which is also owned by Stephan Gagnon.\\n\\nI  want to give this restaurant a good review because I love the space, the food was well-prepared, and they *tried* to provide good customer service. To clarify, it will not be the food that I remember from this night, but rather the inflexible service. I believe you will sympathize with me, my fellow foodies, when you consider the following examples of mulish, uncompromising management.\\n\\nWhen I originally looked at the menu online, the two dishes that caught my eye were the Cassoulet and, of course, the Duck Confit. To my surprise, I received a call from Les Faux two days before our reservation with a request that our party select one of the two prix fixe menus. I said that we wished to order a la carte, and then the ma√Ætre d' - en faire tout un fromage - rebuked my stated preference by explaining that groups over eight *must* order from a set menu. I described that the set menu would be problematic for our group due to allergies and inclinations toward the standard menu. Even with this appeal, the ma√Ætre d' (who I disappointedly discovered was Stephan, the owner) rejected us.\\n\\nI was further disenchanted when we were at the restaurant and were informed that they had run out of a bourbon requested by the Birthday Boy, as well as the only dairy-free dessert on the menu. I know that I cannot condemn a restaurant for lacking Buffalo Trace or lemon tarts, but it was very disappointing considering the importance of the evening and the poor effort of the wait staff to make this let-down up to us.\\n\\nLastly, every other restaurant I have (ever) been to has provided groups of 10 or more - who are easily going to spend over $600 - with a freebie of some sort. Whether it be an aperitif, digestif, or dessert, most respectable restaurants offer a culinary bonus as a thank-you for accumulating such a massive bill. We received le diddl√® squat.\\n\\nFrom the set menu that was forced upon us, we consumed Lamb Bourguignon, Scallop Mornay, Saumon √† la Po√™le, Beef Tenderloin and a Tarte Flamb√©e Alsacienne. As mentioned above, all of these dishes were flavourful and skillfully made, but the Confit at Jules was better.\\n\\nTo end on a positive note, you will be hard pressed to find a better French meal for the price in Vancouver.

I'd give the food 4 stars, but never get delivery. First off, they have a delivery charge that is neither listed on the website nor told to me over the phone. The food arrived at a decent time and upon signing the receipt, I noticed that there was a delivery charge. I was pretty upset about this so I didn't tip the driver. I also am a true believer that if there is a delivery charge then a huge tip isn't necessary - I mean, what exactly is the restaurant charging that for? To-go boxes that I would have gotten if I dined in the restaurant? So I hand the receipt back to the driver and he has the nerve to ask me for tip. Seriously?? You're going to ask me for tip? So I begrudgingly hand over a more than generous tip given his attitude. \\n\\nNot only that, but once I peered into my bag hoping for a delicious meal to calm the rage over the delivery charge, I notice that I'm missing not one, but BOTH of my Chai Teas. I immediately call the restaurant letting them know of my missing orders. The guy is extremely rude and tells me that the driver is now too far away to return - I'm sorry, what?? It had been maybe 2 minutes since the driver left and I realized what was missing. The guy on the phone tells me that the Chai Teas will be free the next time I order. He hangs up without taking any of my information. It's safe to say that I got charged an unknown delivery fee and unwillingly tipped a rude driver for an incomplete order and an empty promise.\\n\\nI'll need some time to decide whether or not I'll return here, but my advice for now is to never get delivery.

After eating here though, I'm convinced that not only am I a fan of Ethiopian food, I know a lot of other folks who will be soon, too! \\n\\nMy family and I came on a Thursday night without a reservation, but had no issues getting a table right in the middle of the restaurant. The website says that they will only make reservations for parties of 6 or more on weeknights and parties of 10 or more on weekends. Not bad for an ATL Top 50 restaurant!  \\n\\nThe massive menu makes it pretty easy to order, even if you have no idea what you're doing. There is a panel of definitions and the menu is segmented so that it can be easily deciphered. Luckily, my sister had dined here before and I'd of course done my Yelp homework, so we were able to order for the whole table with just a bit of guidance. (As a note, this is a place where communal eating is encouraged. It felt weird to us at first - no one had a separate plate! We were all just reaching onto the platter, injera or pita in hand to scoop some of this and some of that!)\\n\\nWe had the following, all of which I would recommend:\\n\\nAPPETIZERS\\n- Sambusa ($3): stuffed with your choice of either minced beef or lentils. Think crispy egg rolls! These come two to an order with a slightly spicy dipping sauce. We tried the lentil version and they were the bomb - definitely my favorite thing we tried! \\n- Kitfo Wrap ($6.50): injera or tortilla flour wrap willed with kitfo, served your choice of rare/medium rare/medium well. Kitfo is steak tartare blended with spices and herbs. We tried the wrap in tortilla (my sister doesn't like injera) and medium rare (to appease the more conservative eaters). I enjoyed both the texture and flavors, and preferred the wrap to the kitfo bowl we got with our platter. \\n\\nSIGNATURE ENTREES\\n- Ribeye Tibs ($13) \\n- Chicken Tibs ($11)\\n- Goden Tibs ($15)\\nThe Tibs platters are large plates with meat, bread, and sides. We ordered all at once and all the tibs came out on one large plate. I didn't try the goden (beef ribs) but really liked everything else, especially the chicken. We loved the ater (yellow lentil stew), especially on the injera with the meat and veggies. The cabbage and carrots side was great. The collard greens were some of the best we've ever had. \\n- Kitfo: the kitfo main can be ordered as steak or salmon, but we kept with the beef theme and ordered steak, \\"very brave\\" style. I expected to love this as I had the kitfo wraps but honestly it was a little overwhelming for us and we all seemed to be gravitating to the other entrees. \\n\\nOverall - I thought the service was great. The ambiance was casual but upbeat and I enjoyed the remixed John Legend songs they were playing. The food is hearty and filling, but really good. It was a bit meat-heavy for me... Next time I would experiment more with the side dishes (they were all the bomb!!!) and possibly order something with fish.

My other half told I looked like I was about to cry after I had finished mine and starting raving about it. \\n\\nAnybody who knows and loves lobster knows that lobster, like other shellfish, is easily overcooked. The tail meat gets chewy, the claw meat starts to lose moisture, and the claw tips develop a spongy unappetizing texture. \\n\\nLet me assure you, none of that is happening here. Now, the owner confided in me that he recently changed purveyors to a higher quality albeit more expensive lobster meat. I urged him strongly to remain with this new supplier at all costs if he was willing to pay the price. \\n\\nThis lobster was softer and sweeter than any I can remember having had in a very long time (and I lived in the lobster central of Maine for 3+ years). Short of steaming them at home and pulling them right at the first second of doneness most lobster ends up overcooked. This stuff was soft, tender, sweet and melt in your mouth. We got two rolls both ways, one mayo and one butter.\\n\\nThe mayo version was simple and subtle. The butter version was what knocked my socks off. The buns with the thin flat hot dog buns toasted in butter for the perfect bread to meat ratio. \\n\\nNow, in addition to all this spectacular-ness, we had a medium boat of whole belly fried clams. These were also spectacular!! Perfectly fried, not overdone and not greasy. The breading was seasoned properly, light and delicious. None of that thick heavy stuff or that flimsy greasy corn starch nonsense. \\n\\nAs a whole this place knocked it out of the park. We've only been here once, so I can't speak to consistency nor the other menu items.

Super-thinly sliced potatoes layered and packed down in a heavy cream and cheese sauce, and then baked to soft perfection. Each bite literally melted in my mouth. \\n\\nRunners up were the prawns, the crab cakes,  the grain dish (I wish I could remember what it was called!) and the rabbit. Each was good, not great, and was SO CLOSE to being amazing. \\n\\nThe prawns were overcooked but the sauce they were in was amazing; the crab cakes were full of giant crab pieces but someone put in giant wedges of mushrooms that confused my mouth with their contrasting texture and flavor; the flavor of the rabbit was great, but it was overcooked and dry; the grain dish was light and a great compliment to the heavier food we'd ordered, but it was rather bland. \\n\\nThe red velvet cake was a huge disappointment. After the raves I was really looking forward to sinking my teeth into a moist sea of happiness. What I got instead was a mouthful of stale cake. Boo. \\n\\nI was also disappointed about the olive oil. I imagine the bread, while homeloved and chewy, would've been a lot better with the \\"grassy\\" olive oil other yelpers had raved about. This especially irked me because I could see bottles of the stuff for sale 3 feet away on the shelf. \\n\\nWaitstaff was ok, I men they were nice when you could flag them down, but the restaurant wasn't full and they were particularly careful to avoid eye contact with us. \\n\\nOverall: meh.\\nFood: meh\\nStaff: meh\\n\\nI just know in the future if I DO come again, I'll probably spend the whole time wishing I was at Tasty and Sons."},{"name":"Song La","address":"411 W 23rd St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Ordered bento box, nuggets, and boba milk tea at 1am, because their pork belly buns are already sold out! The portion is much larger than I thought. It's my first meal today and I fail to finish them all. FYI I had two Chick-fil-A sandwiches and a large Wendy's chili yesterday as lunch, which is my normal appetite.\\n\\nToday's bento box features chicken teriyaki with onions, which I'd like to give 4 stars. It's  OK but not impressive. I cook better teriyaki at home with Kikkoman teriyaki sauce. And the tofu in bento box could use a bit more flavor or have some sauce over it imo.\\n\\nTheir chicken nuggets, however, is why they got an extra star. It's crispy outside, with tenderness and all the flavor inside. I am certain that they were marinated overnight then fried on demand the next day. The simple salt and pepper seasoning with basil leaves adds a good finishing touch too.

(Waitstaff note in general: check your table BEFORE the food comes to see if anyone needs another round. Some people (ahem) like their cold one right there next to their first bite.) \\n\\nSo yes, about the bites. Yummy! I had the Butcher's Cut and he had the Local. His was a tiny bit too rare but he was ok about it. Mine was perfect.

Of course, that's the only picture I saw, so imagine my surprise when I walked in and saw multicolored walls decorated in posters, flags, and other trinkets. I thought I was in the wrong place until the hostess/waitress invited us in. The seating was also different than what we expected. The tables look like goblet drums but instead of a flat surface, its surface was concave and we had to hunch over to eat (which I was not really a fan of).  \\n\\nI ordered the Vegan Drek Tibs ($13) and my non-vegan friend had a spicy Lamb dish ($13). When the waitress brought out our food, my order was laid out on one side of a large piece of injera and my friend's was in a separate bowl. Then, the waitress began ladling the lamb dish onto the same injera as my vegan dish! I politely stopped her and after clarifying that the lamb was in fact the lamb dish and not just another part of my vegan dish, I asked if she could please keep the food separate. She looked surprised but kindly obliged. So a note to all the vegans enjoying a meal with your non-vegan friends... ask to keep the dishes separate and explicitly mention that you don't eat ANY meat. \\n\\nThe Vegan Tibs were amazing! The taste was fabulous and the tibs had a nice crunch to them - even my non-veg friend said it was good, and she's not the type to lie to spare feelings. I was very surprised that I liked the dish as much as I did. It came with cooked onions, jalapeno, and tomato which added depth and more flavor to the tibs. I would definitely recommend this dish! \\n\\nThe waitress gave us plenty of injera to enjoy and was friendly throughout the meal. I would definitely come again for the tibs!\\n\\nCONS:\\n- The pricing was okay with the extra 20% off.\\n- I didn't like the tables, because I felt like I was sitting very far away from it and was nervous about making a mess! Also, the tables were low, so I was kind of hunched over for the meal. \\n- The restaurant did not seem exceptionally clean. \\n- My vegan food was almost contaminated! \\n\\n\\nPARKING:\\nThe little lot outside the restaurant was packed (even though the restaurant itself was empty), so I parked in the abandoned-looking lot directly adjacent (next to) the restaurant.

It makes me sad as well to see this place empty at times. Are people really going to yucky chipotle over this gem? This is as close to home cooking as it gets. It authentic and genuine. I get the carnitas, because damn it's good. They make a ridiculously good carnitas. Tender and perfectly seasoned. The pinto beans are always cooked thru to perfection, soft yet firm, never dry. The rice is perfectly seasoned. Never salty and always fluffy, firm yet tender. The homemade sauce ( the green one) is out of this world. It's mild with a good amount of flavor. Even the extra spicy is good if you are looking for a kick. Overall the fam that works there are the sweetest people ever. Always have a smile accomadating and never any attitude. They are fantastic. My only gripe, and legit my only, and I didn't take away stars for it, but I feel like it needs to made aware because another yelper mentioned it. The white dude (hate saying that but it's the only way to identify or rectify the situation) will give major attitude. We had words over the fact of me ordering extra sauce. He asked if I would like everything on my plate. I told him my specifics and said I will take extra sauce. As well he was prepping my food. I got a different, very spicy sauce, so I asked if they changed the sauce. He replied no you asked for extra sauce. Mind you, I have been coming to this establishment for at least 5 years I would say. During which time I was not aware that there was an EXTRA HOT sauce. Good to know. Then he reprimanded me and told me to not assume. Hmmm am I tho? Otherwise, help comes and goes and this was only recent and I don't hold it against the establishment, theres no reason, but it should be made aware that his lack of customer service could potentially reflect badly on the establishment.If you are expecting fake taco bell food, then yes you will be dissapointed.

So I was a little weary when I walked in and found out that Hottie Hawg's identifies themselves as a \\"Texas BBQ joint.\\"  Fortunately that started, and ended with selling meat by the pound.  Eh, I can live with that.\\n\\nSo I had a half pound of pulled pork, on a bun, with mac-n-cheese, and beans as my sides.  The pulled pork by itself was great.  Smoky, with a deep rich flavor.  Add on their own Hot Bastard Mustard sauce, and you've got an amazing combination.\\n\\nThe mac-n-cheese was good.  I must say that the jalape√±os in it were a surprise.  Don't know that I care for the combination, but I will say that I am a Yankee (reformed), so that might have something to do with it.  Similarly, the beans I did not care for.  My guess is that they cook them with beef drippings.  As I'm not a beef fan, so that combination doesn't sit well with me.\\n\\nThe setting was great.  The buildings appear to be an old school house, or maybe a church.  One way or another, it's been painted to definitly stand out in the neighborhood.  The interior is a typical roadhouse style, with blues memorabilia, and BBQ competition winnings plastered all over.  This creates a very casual, and relaxed atmosphere.  \\n\\nFrom the moment I sat down everything, and everyone felt welcoming.  Ms. Stacy was absolutely great.  Keeping me company, telling me all about the BBQ compitions, and some of the history of the place.  One thing that really stands out to someone dining alone, is how friendly the staff is.  I know I'm more likely to to return to a place, if I feel like I've got a friend there.  Anyone that comes in while Ms. Stacy is working, knows they have a friend there.\\n\\nOverall, Hottie Hawgs gets a top rating for thier friendly atmosphere, and their great BBQ.  This will be a must hit location from now on, whenever I'm in Atlanta."},{"name":"FLIP burger boutique","address":"1587 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"On a recent trip to ATl I stopped by My friend Richard's place...

It was new last summer, I think....had just opened...and we stopped by to check it out.

The food is amazing and the customer service is even better (if possible).  I can ask those guys ANYTHING about what is in the food and they don't bat an eye, unlike some other places I go where they either look annoyed or dumbfounded.  On my very first visit there the manager himself went and got the packaging for their papadum to make sure the ingredients were okay for me and showed it to me personally.  SO accommodating and they continue to be every time I come in.  \\n\\nThe prices, unfortunately, just went up a bit, but I'm still willing to pay. I LOVE the onion bhaji appetizer--sooooooo good! As well, I love that they have a Chicken Tikka Saag--I like white meat only (I know, I'm soooo picky!) and most Indian places don't have it with the saag or are unwilling to trade.  \\n\\nThe only thing that I have to say that's negative is their papadum is overpriced...I know how much a package of 15 or so of those things costs in an Indian food grocery store and it's just silly charging so much for them.

Not going to ask, \\"Have you been there, to There?\\"  Not going to pull a Liz Lemon and ask if you \\"want to go to There.\\"  Nope.  Not going to happen.\\n\\nInstead I'll simply state that I've always had a pleasant experience at There.  The first time I visited was during brunch hours on a Sunday, so there was a jazz duo playing in the corner of the restaurant.  That was delightful!  We weren't really in the mood for brunch foods though, so we eschewed the special menu and ordered a couple of burgers instead.  I ordered the standard There burger even though I would have preferred to have ordered the much-lauded bison burger, because I refuse to order the same thing as my dining companion.  Unfortunately we have very similar taste in burgers.\\n\\nHer selection proved superior, although she was generous and let me have a bite.  Both burgers were delicious but bison trumps beef for certain.  The double patties are substantial and with the poblano it packs just the right amount of flavor without verging into spiciness.  We both got garlic rosemary fries on the side and found them unremarkable--neither of us finished, although that might be more a testament to the size of the burgers than to the quality of the fries.\\n\\nOn our second visit there was no jazz duo, but we consoled ourselves with an appetizer of fried pickles.  These are the best fried pickles I've ever tasted.  Perfectly battered and fried, not greasy and so packed with flavor that I could have hoovered an entire bowl by myself.  Apparently they are house-made and battered in beer and vodka?  I didn't taste the vodka though, and that's a good thing.  After an unpleasant experience in college I try to avoid the stuff.\\n\\nFor entrees I selected the Cubano and she ordered the Reuben.  For those keeping track at home, that means we've never eaten a non-sandwich entree at There.  But these sandwiches are the bomb-omb diggity, so I don't think we've missed out on anything.  The Reuben comes on H&F rye and it is a perfect example of what a good Reuben should be.  The Cubano was also quite tasty and hit the spot... although, I think she got the better sandwich.  Foiled again!\\n\\nFortunately on our last visit, I got the better side.  The cheddar & poblano grit cake is amazing.\\n\\nThe beer selection at There isn't vast, but it is local.  Several options from Monday Night Brewing, Red Hare, Sweetwater and the like.  They had the new(ish) MNB Blind Pirate Double IPA on tap when I was there last, and it was served appropriately in a MNB tulip glass.  Mega points for that.\\n\\nI like this gastropub a lot, and would visit with more frequency if it were closer to me.

I had contacted them to make sure they had the NFL games before coming to their restaurant and even required about how to request to watch our games. I informed them that I had considered two other bars in the area as well, but they assured me that we should come to Yard House since it would be the best experience and it would be no problem to ensure we would be able to watch our games since we requested early enough. Unfortunately, this was not the case. After the first quarter, the TV channels were changed. I politely requested that the TVs be changed back and explained the situation. The staff member apologized and had the TVs changed back. This occurred 3 more times over the course of the next two quarters. I finally asked to speak to the head manager. He was clearly flustered and got upset but did change the TVs back. To make matters worse, when I went to pay my check, I had asked for change and a copy of my receipt. She did neither, so after 25 minutes, I again had to ask another staff member to please locate our server. This has overall been an unfortunately disappointing experience.

I called at least 4 times during the week and spoke with various managers and was assured by all that we would be placed on the \\"call ahead\\" list. Each manager took down my name every time I called. I also called again, 2 hours prior to my party's arrival, to make sure I was on the list.\\n\\nWhen we arrived, they had no idea about my call ahead and looked at us blankly despite the fact that I had called at least 4 different times. What was the point of the call ahead list if no bartaco employee is able to find my name on it? This was a little frustrating because of the amount of time and energy invested during the week.\\n\\nLuckily, the wait wasn't terrible. Our table was ready within 30-40 minutes.. which for a large party on a Friday night is not bad at all.\\n\\nWe placed our orders on the bartaco order cards as every single person in the party wanted tacos. The tacos arrived chaotically. The servers had no idea who ordered which taco or which order card it belonged to. I am no industrial engineer but this seems like the most INEFFICIENT way to bring out taco orders. \\n\\nThey should be grouped based on order card. Each order card should come out with the tacos so there is no confusion. I am not sure why they don't group them by order card in the kitchen, before they come out! Seems silly to me. Our large party spent at least 20 minutes trying to figure out the mess of tacos that arrived to our table. The waiter really was no help in distributing tacos to the appropriate people. By the time we were able to eat our tacos, they were cold and soggy.\\n\\nPreviously, I have had great margaritas and sangria at Bartaco. Last night, the drinks were subpar. The margaritas were overly sour and watered down. 5 different people in our party had the margs and all agreed. \\n\\nI will say that our waiter was patient with the large party and willing to split checks which was helpful. He even brought out a birthday dessert!\\n\\nOverall, this was just A-OK. The service really needs improvement (from the employees taking call aheads, to the kitchen staff sending out tacos, to the waiters serving orders). \\n\\nI prefer the bartaco locations in Inman Park and Chastain Park.

All were fine- nothing terrible, nothing to come here for.\\nThere's also baked potato salad and Mexican rice.\\nOther items are also available next to the sides: banana pudding, cornbread, and pecan pies.\\n\\nMEATS\\nThey offer brisket, beef ribs, pork ribs, sausage (original or jalapeno cheese), turkey, and chopped beef.\\nThey were out of beef ribs by the time we arrived, so we settled on 2 pounds of brisket, 2 pounds of pork ribs, and a jalapeno cheese sausage link for 4 people. With the addition of 5 5-oz sides, our total came out to be right under $100.\\nThe brisket was beautiful but was on the leaner side. There wasn't an option to choose between fatty or lean slices. The rub, like many other Yelpers pointed out, was also really salty. \\nThe pork ribs and jalapeno cheese sausage were surprising very good. The pork ribs were tender with some fat and had a really nice sweet and salty rub. (Again, a little more on the extra salty side, but the sweetness helped.)\\nThe jalapeno cheese sausage was extremely creamy and one of the better sausages I've had at a bbq place.\\n\\nSAUCES\\nOriginal, sweet, and spicy. Original was more tart and vinegar-based. Sweet and spicy were not-that-sweet and not-that-spicy, so I ended up using mostly the spicy one.

At 7pm, several tables were already occupied, yet we were offered a choice of tables/booths for our consideration. \\n\\nThe selections for the special menu come from their regular menu; the only difference being the price for the three courses.  I started with the red lentil soup, which was absolutely delicious.  Knowing that lamb is a big staple in Mediterranean and North African diet, I ordered the lamb shank for my main.  It was perfectly prepared (tender and distinctly flavorful) and served over a 'pillow' of cooked eggplant.  My wife started with the Shepherd's salad (assorted mixed greens) and enjoyed the variety and dressing.  She followed with the stuffed chicken - the accompanying vegetables were superbly prepared and enjoyable.  An excellent Chilean Sauvignon Blanc @ $34 went well with all we consumed.  We finished with an order of their special creamed rice pudding and baklava (both excellent).\\n\\nOur server, Kimberly, was attentive and informative and took great care of us the entire evening.

We are Californians always on the hunt for good Tacos, among other things. \\n\\nWe were starving tonight, after far too many hours working on a deal, and needed a great meal.  This place has excellent reviews, with an interesting menu and what looked like baja-style pedigree. We decided to try the pickup window, which we were really glad to see.   \\n\\nThis place had such promise on its face, but it failed miserably. \\n\\nFirst, the service was absolutely deplorable. Horrible. Actually very nasty. \\n\\n1) We waited at the window for service and noticed the sushi-style ordering card.  The young lady who was standing at the window register drifted off without acknowledging us.  Then...I kid you not...three other servers came into the window area and not one greeted us.   Finally, a server came over - and was exceedingly difficult (more on that in a minute).\\n\\n2) Baja style is typically not a problem for non-dairy people, but living in the south has taught us to be very clear about *non-dairy* needs, because establishments often sprinkle on cheese and other dairy items not listed on the menu.  Bad business, but very common. \\n\\nWe wrote \\"no dairy, no cheese, no mayo, no aioli,\\" to ensure there were no surprises, and made this clear to the server.  We initially stated that we'd just order a side of verde or guacamole to go with our order. \\n\\n3) The server had a particularly nice-nasty style.  Lots of smiling, but a feigned confusion about our *no dairy* request.  There was a great deal of back and forth.  \\n\\nBefore I move on here, I want to point out that Bartaco makes it clear in their menu that most menu items are gluten-free, with stars indicating items with gluten.  We assumed that this meant that the restaurant was friendly, or at least competent, around dietary issues.\\n\\nOur first question: \\"What comes on the tacos?\\" She seemed really annoyed by this question.  But answered \\"They all come with cilantro and onions\\".  When we asked about whether there were other toppings, she seemed put off.  I can't pinpoint what the issue was.  \\n\\nAt any rate, the server was very difficult, seemed put off by having to pull out the food data book, and kept making strange comments about how these tacos \\"aren't your average tacos\\" - by which I suppose she meant Taco Bell tacos. \\n\\nI explained that we were quite familiar with the (apparent) style of taco, and that we just wanted to make sure that there was no dairy.  Couldn't she just note the no dairy or suggest adjustments?  No, apparently.   Again, this wouldn't have been such an issue, except that the young lady was just so...nasty.  The weird smile did not mask the general hostility she seemed to harbor, and her lack of knowledge around the menu items (and what salsa verde is) was an inconvenience.  We used to call this \\"nice-nasty\\".  Genuine politeness would have helped. A lot.  \\n\\nI can't imagine what the root of all that was.  \\n\\n4) At a baja-style place, or one that pretends to be in its website iconography, the tacos are generally very basic.  Corn tortilla, fresh cilantro, onion (the occasional pico de gallo) and a seasoned meat.  It's fine to do something different, but the establishment should be clear about this.  \\n\\nOnly one taco, the portobello w/queso fresco, lists a cheese.  But, in this horribly long and taxing exchange with the server, we learned that another taco includes feta cheese. Something else had a chipotle \\"slaw\\".  (We explained we didn't want anything with mayonnaise.  She insisted they have no mayo anywhere in the establishment.  But there is dairy, right? *Long pause* \\"Yes, there is milk in that\\"  *sigh*).  The curry shrimp taco also includes milk somehow.  Cheap replacement for coconut milk, I'm guessing?   I find this very unprofessional - it's imperative that a restaurant list its preparations in the description notes (this menu doesn't have little description notes).  If you are going to be creative, you should be clear. \\n\\nWe also tried to order a King of Pops pineapple habanero popsicle.  The server told us at the end of her keying in the order, almost triumphantly \\"And...we're out of King of Pops\\".  Seriously? How did you not communicate that to the servers at some point?  \\n\\nRestaurant 101: Tell the servers when you are out of stuff and save the customers time.  Secondly, maybe make sure you have your locally-sourced frozen items in stock, or don't bother, cause we can also go grab some ourselves.\\n\\nI dunno, I'm rarely this annoyed when writing a review, and it's not my intention to be snarky.  \\n\\n5) Finally, get the basics right. The guacamole was lovely to look at and obviously fresh, but it was very, very, very salty.  For a nine dollar pricetag on a large guac, get it right.   The tomatillo salsa was hefty, but weirdly sweet.  Um, verde shouldn't taste like relish.\\n\\nEspecially if you love true taco fare and good service, pass on this place."},{"name":"Hopdoddy Burger Bar","address":"1400 S Congress Ave, Ste A190","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"If I could I would them a 4.5! \\n\\nThe line was pretty long but it was Sunday brunch.

Always on the look out for good outdoor dining options, I finally figured out how to get there by land and we gave it a try for lunch.\\n\\nThere is an nice inside bar and  restaurant space with large windows that overlook the outside pooldeck bar and tables. Although temps were climbing into the low 90's, everyone this day still opted for an outside table. People were hanging out swimming in the pool as well as simply showing up for a bite to eat. There was live music and a nice summertime vibe going on. \\n\\nThe menu here is what you might expect from a place on the water: an assortment of seafood, burgers, sandwiches and pizza with some steak. chicken and pasta dishes thrown in among the full meal entrees. We were there for lunch so I ordered the fish tacos and Marty got the Hawaiian chicken sandwich. I like that you could choose between grilled, blackened or fried on the fish but I was a little disappointed that the tortilla choice was flour only. Personally I prefer corn tortillas. The menu said they would be served with lettuce, tomato and crisp onion along with a homemade tartar sauce. The serving is a generous one of three tacos, each with 2-3oz of nicely cooked, moist fish. I was slightly surprised because I interpreted \\"crisp\\" onion to mean fried however they interpret it to mean tiny pieces of chopped red onion. My bad I guess. The homemade tartar sauce was pretty bland - hardly more than a side of mayo. But I had noticed that they offered a remoulade sauce with some of their other dishes so I asked for some of that instead. That was spicy and flavorful and totally kicked the tacos up a notch. They were messy to eat but I quite enjoyed them. \\n\\nMarty's sandwich was also a very generous portion of chicken with pineapple, bacon and cheese. The piece of chicken extended well beyond the bun. He said his was quite tasty too. We both chose fries as our sides and they were the thick waffle cut style. \\n\\nThey have no beer on tap which I found a little surprising - only bottles/cans. Soda is also served by the can with a glass of ice on the side but at just $1.25 it's a very reasonable beverage. Many of the tables have umbrellas that can offer a little shelter from the hot Florida sun or you can hang out at the bar which sits under cover. Either way, as a non-smoker be prepared to face the conundrum that sitting outside to enjoy the fresh air means you risk being surrounded by smokers. \\n\\nThis was a very pleasant, casual place to sit and enjoy a drink and a bite to eat while we watched the boats in the marina and got the occasional summery whiff of suntan lotion from the poolside crowd."},{"name":"Andiamo Ristorante","address":"2521 Rutland Dr, Ste 325","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"The food is decent, but certainly not for the price.

The only reasons I'm giving the Clay Pit three stars instead of two are the excellent cocktails, the lovely space, and the excellent naan. I guess the American staff and the fact that the waiter couldn't explain why their baigan barta wasn't vegan (he guessed it had cream, but I've never seen a recipe for this dish that called for cream or any other dairy item) should have been a dead giveaway that the food wouldn't be to my liking. There wasn't anything wrong with it, it just was dumbed down and not terribly authentic other than the channa masala. The daal was cooked to a mush and the Goan curry was made with yellow curry powder, which I never found in any food anywhere in Southern India.

If you like the Lockhart Black's you are going to like Terry Black's BBQ in Austin, and in my opinion the Austin site is even better.  I ate here twice now since opening, about 3 weeks after it opened.  At lunch it was quite busy, the parking lot was almost full and but the line inside was light.  Nice size parking lot for the area and nice location off of Barton Springs almost across from the Palmer center.\\n\\nThe sides looked fresh and they have an $11 lunch plate with 1/2 lb of meat and two sides.  Tip:  the plastic foam plate has 2 spots for sides - you can share a spot with more than one side.  So if you want mac and cheese, cream corn and potato salad, you can mix the cream corn and mac & cheese on one slot and fill the other slot with the potato salad.  Another tip - if you want a desert such as the awesome pecan cobbler, you can use that as your side instead of the traditional side selections.  I did enjoy the mac & cheese and cream corn (however I like Rudy's version more).  \\n\\nThis BBQ place is about the meat and they advertise they use Angus beef.  I talked with two of the cooks about the BBQ process. They have four main cooker's, three outside and one in back of the building.  These are not new but have been in the family for a while.  They use oak wood and cook the brisket for 14 to 15 hours, check the temperature of the meat but pull based on how 'easy' the temp probe goes into the meat.  This brisket meat is as tender and moist as Rudy's and Franklin's and more tender and moist than the Salt Lick.  The rub gets good penetration (the amount of color the goes toward the center of the meat from the rub) into the meat but I have seen more penetration in Franklin's (which may be a difference in the rub).\\n\\nThe beef rib is amazing - the cut is about 2 inches off the bone.  They don't cook it as long (about 5 hrs) as the meat would fall off the bone.  The beef rib is $16.50 a pound and many of the ribs weigh in at 2 lbs!  Most tender beef rib I have seen.  \\n\\nThe pork ribs are thick, moist and juicy.  I still prefer Rudy's but only because of the flavor of their ribs, they are not as thick or as moist as Black's.\\n\\nThe BBQ sauce is an option for the meat - you don't need to add it, but you have a choice of 3.  I actually liked a combination of the 'traditional' and the sweet & spicy version - yes you can mix them to get a better flavor for you!  \\n\\nOne comment to management - the onions and pickles are in a small area and don't have container (at least I did not see them).  I recommend to add a little more area to the station with the drinks, ice cream, pickles, onions, and bread. I do like the wheat bread offered - fresh, moist good quality bread.

We stood in front of a friendly guy who eventually led us to a table in the empty dining room (we visited at 3:30 pm on a Wednesday).  The place has an unfinished look-- as if a bunch of tables were randomly placed -- somewhat unorganized with too much empty space, so it's an odd feeling to start. An inviting aspect was a bookcase of games -- which gives that come and stay a while feeling.  Once seated it took a long time to get in a drink order -- even though we were the only people seated in the main dining area.  The most unsettling part was our waiter -- nice guy, but he didn't have good table-side manner.  Very low energy and zero suggestions of menu items or highlights. He also lacked a basic knowledge of the menu.  He couldn't pronounce the name of a dessert (which was one of the specials of the day).  We ordered one and it was forgotten -- we had to go to the counter and remind him of our order.  He also didn't know if sandwiches came with anything (chips, etc.). Our iced tea ran dry and we had to ask for more since no offer was coming despite two visits to our table.  Once I had eaten chips and salsa and chicken tortilla soup, I didn't feel I had anything special that I couldn't have had by opening a bag, box or a can. The BLT was good (standard homemade fare)...  The chicken cranberry sandwich was very tasty as was the angus burger. One other concern:  it took over 30 minutes to get our food -- and only one other person had entered.

The mentioned green peppers seemed MIA, however, everything else was accounted for.  The concoction as a whole was pleasing, but much lighter than either of my past rum tum dittys, perhaps because it was not cheesy.  I had lifted the top half of the skillet popover and found that it had been slathered with some kind of glistening spread - the house sauce, I was informed, which included olive oil and hollandaise.  Well, I thought that a nice touch, and ate nearly half alongside the filled base.\\n\\nFor things such as water, don't bother asking the dark haired lady who may deliver your food.  She's nice enough, but seems to have too much going on in terms of putting out the food, and might forget.  I'll forgive her.\\n\\nTip in regards to the bathroom - lock both the top lock and the door handle lock for greatest privacy.\\n\\nThey weren't too busy for lunch on a Sunday.  But should there be something happening over at TD Garden, all bets are off.\\n\\n***\\n\\nEven though I handicapped them with having ordered their home fries $1.99 to go, the tender rough chopped potatoes were pretty tasty and I liked them.  I am assuming, however, that they would have retained some kind of crisp and crunchiness to the browned bits if I had dined within instead.\\n\\nTheir fresh fruit bowl $3.99 was a nice mix of honeydew, green round grapes, cantaloupe, and strawberry.  That fared a lot better on the travel and time.  The honeydew was sweet and ripe.  The grapes were a bit sour.\\n\\nThe sweet skillet popover $6 had a sweet glaze coating the top.  It was nice, but perhaps a more tender vehicle would have made for a more pleasant consumption.  So between this and their Sugar Cinnamon Popover $5.50, I prefer the second.\\n\\n***\\n\\nThe chicken strips $6.50 at Popover King were a pleasant surprise - 3 thin sliced chicken tenders, marinated and skillet fried.  I realized when I saw them that I had imagined chicken fingers, possibly with a dipping sauce.\\n\\nThey were well flavored, but ranged from cooked well to a bit overcooked on the thickest piece (likely due to the kitchen trying hard to avoid salmonella).\\n\\nTheir banana bread $3.25 was good sized, sliced about an inch and a half thick, and smelled great!  But it was rather oily, as evidenced by how the oil had soaked through the paper and box after a while.\\n\\nTheir sweet popover Royal (ricotta filled with maple berry compote and fresh berries) was nice and not overly sweet, but very berryful.  The ricotta was light, not dense and rich and dairyful as in a cannoli.\\n\\n***\\n\\nI ordered up one of their Peachy Keen $8.50 (peach-maple filling topped with mango cream and pomegranate) sweet popovers to go.  They packed the cream separately, which was nice, so I decided to ask them how to care for this treat if it wasn't going to be consumed for a few hours.\\n\\nShe worried about a loss of moisture, so instead of keeping the popover at room temperature, she suggested freezing the popover, while refrigerating the cream), then microwaving it a minute, followed by baking for 2 at 400 degrees.\\n\\nAfter all that, it was still pretty good.\\n\\n***\\n\\nThe Friar Tuck Popover (cheese, pesto bacon) $8.25 is rich and creamy a concoction.  The garden salad (grape tomatoes (make that chopped), cucumbers, onions, and lettuce) $6.10 with honey mustard on the side was a good accompaniment as it helped to cut the fattiness of the cheese.  The salad was a portion that two diners might share it as a side."},{"name":"Taco Bell","address":"495 W State Rd 436","city":"Altamonte Springs","stars":"2","text":"Honor your HOURS!!!!

That being said, bartaco in West Midtown was one of the most delicious, disappointing, and frustrating resturant experiences I have had in Atlanta to this date. Here are my thoughts:\\n\\n1st Experience: I went to dine at bartaco by myself on a whim, so I proceeded to grab a seat at the bar. My first impressions of the expansive, open-aired dining room space intrigued me. Same goes for the eclectic wall art and hip music. I thought I was in for a memorable experience, a new favorite regular spot. It started to take a turn for the worst from that point on. I waited patiently in my bar seat for about 12 minutes and tried to make eye contact with one of the bartenders, most of whom were busy stocking underbar fridges or making cocktails for other guests ( I came later at night, so I'm sure they were trying to complete their closing tasks). I finally caught one of the bartenders attention and ordered a Findencio, neat. My drink was given to me very soon after that. Another 10 minutes rolled by ( almost 22 minutes now since I sat at the bar) and I was eager to order something to eat. I was finally informed that I had to check off my food choices on an order card, which I had not known up until that point. I had ordered an assortment of  tacos ( Glazed Pork Belly, Crispy Rock Shrimp, Cauliflower, Baja Fish), as well as the Ceviche. My second disappointment of the night was when my food came out of order ( I had ordered the Ceviche as a first course), as well as AFTER three other bar guests, who had ordered after me. The tacos were delicious, well seasoned, and full of flavor, the pork belly being my favorite. The ceviche was classic with a great balance of acidity and salt. After thoroughly enjoying my food, I was ready for the bill, which was presented to me correctly, but something was off. The Findencio that I had ordered was $24 for the pour. When I asked the bartender why this was, they responded with \\" yah our Findencio is expensive\\" and walked away. From 10 feet away, the bottle looked exactly like Findencio Classico, but it turns out it was Findencio Pachuca. I was very annoyed that, since this was the only Findencio they had, they didn't inform me how MUCH more expensive it is than its classic mezcal counterpart, with has almost the exact same label. I did order it after all, so I paid my bill and left, desiring more from the overall experience. \\n\\n\\n2nd Experience: I decided to give bartaco another shot last Friday with one of my friends. I went into it with a positive mind and wiped the slate clean from what happened previously. We sat at the bar again and since I was initiated with the ordering process, I figured we would order our food right away. I was sadly mistaken. I took almost 10 minutes for a bartender to acknowledge us. Once again, we had waited almost 18 minutes for our drinks to arrive after that. Mind you, it was 10:30pm and the bar was hardly at full capacity. We ordered a bunch of tacos once again, as well as the salsa verde'. The salsa verde was delicious and extremely fresh and vegetal. The accompanying fried tortillas were warm and the salt was fine enough to cling to every bite. I was ready to order another drink, just a Modelo Especial with lime. After waiting around 10 minutes, my Modelo was nowhere in site. The first bartender had forgotten about it. I ordered it from another bartender, which took another 5 minutes or so. 15 minutes for a bottled beer with lime? No thank you. After our meal, we had asked the bartender to split our check. She returned the check to us with the full amount already processed to the one card on file. \\n\\nI want to like bartaco, I really do. The food and the non-pretentious atmosphere might bring me back for one more try, but the customer service will surely not. I'm a resturant manager in Downtown Atlanta and creating guest connections is my career. You go to a resturant originally for the food, but return for how the staff makes you feel. I feel that bartaco fell shy of the mark."},{"name":"Clay Pit","address":"1601 Guadalupe St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I went to the Clay Pit with my sister for her birthday.  I flew in hours before our dinner, so no reservation was made.  Fortunately that evening, we arrived early and there was space in the basement hallway.  The basement area has the ambiance of a wine cellar.  While the sound was bouncing off the walls, it was much quieter than the main dining room (very loud).  \\n\\nFor our appetizers, we order the veggie Samosas and the Coriander Calamari.  The samosa is a golden-fried, conehead pastry puff filled w/ vegetable and is good with dipping sauce. The calamari is lightly breaded and fried, cooked perfectly and served with a tasty sauce.\\n\\nOur soup dishes are the Taj Mahal Soup and the Mulligatawny Soup.  The Taj Mahal is a puree of lentils and vegetables, while the Mulligatawny is also a puree of chicken, apples and veggies.  The Mulligatawny is very good but the Taj Mahal is highly recommended.  We have our soup with onion & cilantro naan.\\n\\nWith our soup and appetizers, we probably should have stopped with all our plates being fairly large in portion.  But we have a few bites of our entrees with the expectation to save the rest for takeaway.  The entrees each turned out to be only ok.  The Chicken Tikka Masala had good chicken cubes but I've had better flavor elsewhere. And our Clay Pit Vegetable Stir Fry and Channa Masala seemed to taste similar and thus a disappointment.\\n\\nAs far as the heat of this place, the waitress will ask the table if you want mild, medium, hot and desi (super hot).  Medium tends to be the average, so we go with that.  Everything up to the appetizer was medium, but the entrees were more on the hot side.  I recommend to err on the side of caution when ordering spicy - especially when you are with others!\\n\\nWhile there were some highlights in the menu, there were some dishes that would have been okay to skip.

So... wait, the new coffee shop is gone and it's now back to being a pizzeria again? But this location had previously been home to two consecutively failed pizza joints (Mangia and Pizza Bistro), so why would they do that? But wait, it's still Stinson's. Sort of. I think.

My burger was cooked properly this time but the fries were really soggy and the salt shaker was clogged.  Actually, I had to ask for the salt because my food was so bland. On a positive note, the salad I ordered with beets and goat cheese was lightly tossed in a very bright, fresh tasting vinaigrette which was a nice surprise. The rather large chunks of beets at the very bottom were overpowering, however, and would have been more appealing diced into smaller pieces.\\nAs for dessert, I had been curious about the Krispy Kreme milkshake.  Talk about sugar overload - one sip of this frothy concoction was more than enough.\\n  \\nFinal thought:  I appreciate the novelty of a burger boutique but the actual taste of the food is more important."},{"name":"Burnside Brewing","address":"701 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"So last night my girlfriend and I decided to go brewpub hopping in Portland. We're new to the area so we thought the best way to experience the beer culture is to order a couple beers at each place and quickly move on to the next brewpub. We started at Lucky Lab then moved to Green Dragon and Cascade. Burnside was the fourth brew pub we visited and after we went to Hair of the Dog. I must say out of all of these, we enjoyed Burnside the most. First off the atmosphere was very comfortable. It seemed a bit more upscale than the previous brewpubs and I liked the open kitchen right behind the bar which filled the room with a mouth watering aroma. We had the bartender surprise of with our first two beers and he was more than helpful with everything else from there. We ordered the Shrimp Daikon fries to snack on and what a meal it was. Packed with flavor in every bite, I highly recommend this appetizer to everyone!  We ordered the beer sampler which had all 10 of the beers that they had on tap. They were all very delicious. What topped it all off was the great Indie Rock soundtrack. Great Food, Great Beer, Great Service, Great Atmosphere and Great Music for the winning combination!!!

Because of my fondness for Korean, I make it a point to always locate a Korean restaurant nearby any place I have lived in the last couple of decades.  \\n\\nI live far from Beaverton, so those places were a bit much to travel, unless I had no other choices. I used to go to Sorabol, they were reasonably good, then that horrid Sushi go round thing came, then went back to pretty good again, but now they are a stupid Karaoke bar. I went to Koji's grill a couple of times during the \\"Horrid Sushi go round\\" phase of Sorabol, but they are expensive, and too soft on the spicy heat. \\n\\nI no longer had a Korean restaurant nearby. That was until I searched around and found So Kong Dong. I didn't have huge expectations on my first visit here. But was pleasantly surprised with my meal. I am glad Sorabol is closed; otherwise I may not have found this place. \\n\\nEveryone who mentioned the tofu soup is exactly on target here. Do not pass up the house specialty.  They will even make it really spicy or less spicy, as they ask you how you want it! It comes out to the table boiling hot, I mean literally boiling. Crack the provided egg into the soup to cool it off and cook the egg right before your eyes. \\n\\nI have had both the pork Bulgabi and beef Bugogi, cooked by the house.

Service was great. Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the items on the menu. It's a hit or miss with some of these tappas.  Definitely a fun dinner experience but expect it to get a bit pricy.\\n\\nCHARCUTTERIE BOARD - got the Chorizo which were pretty much tiny Pepperoni's. Lomo iberico which is straight up pigs fat sliced out thinly. Didn't have too much flavor. It's exactly like what I kinda expected pigs fat would taste like. I forgot what cheese we got but it was made out of sheep's milk. We asked the waiter to recommend a sharp cheese and its what he pointed out to us. The cheese was creamy and really strong. We did not enjoy this. I don't know much about cheeses so I wouldn't know the best way to describe the taste. But we were kinda hoping to get something like a Gruyere cheese. Surprisingly my fav part of the board was the fig Jam/jelly that came for free on the side. Rlly sweet and tastes amazing with bread.\\n\\nSQUID INK FIDEOS for 2 - surprisingly this came out before all the tapas. This was big enough for 5 people. We all really liked this. Was a bit spicy but had aoili on top that you can mix in. And there was a good amt of squid in it!\\n\\nWAGYU TARTAR- one of my fav dishes of the night. The truffle aoili on the tartar made it rlly flavorful and delicious. Comes with a raw egg on top and few pieces of toasted bread.\\n\\nEMPENADAS- filled with beef. this was good but nothing special.\\n\\nHANGER STEAK- everyone on Yelp recommended this so we tried it and really enjoyed it. I think the vinegrette is what makes the dish.\\n\\nPULPO - I don't remember what this was called but it's octopus.  I was not a big fan of this because it smelled really bad. I don't like olives/cape and right when the waiter puts the plate on your table, the smell of whatever it was definitely hits you. The smell lingered at the table until we finished it. \\n\\nDEER MEAT- don't remember what this was called either. But it was 2 pieces of deer meat that look like it was cooked raw. I've never had deer meat and was afraid it was going to taste gamey. Surprisingly it tasted a bit like beef and although it looked raw, it had a tough/dry texture. Cool to say I tried deer meat, but it was nothing special.\\n\\nPAELLA MARISCOS for 2 - seafood paella. This came last and I was most excited for this. It looked amazing with tons of seafood on top. But sadly it looked better than it tasted. I took my first bite and it was kind of bland. I took another bite and it was really salty. The rest of my friends thought it was rlly salty too. We were so disappointed. We couldn't finish it and had to send it back. For $50 we expected so much better. The manager came by our table and told us that he tried it and agreed it was salty. He was nice enough to take it off our bill as well. \\n\\nFLAN - got this for dessert. Your typical flan. Sweet and creamy. \\n\\nCHURROS - 5 giant/ fat pieces; 1 for everyone in my group. They were really doughy and fluffy. Came with chocolate sauce on the side but it was really dark chocolate so wasn't sweet at all. I love desserts but I didn't really like this. Couldn't even finish eating my 1 churro"},{"name":"Koji Osakaya","address":"1000 SW Broadway, Ste 110","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"Went here for happy hour last night.

Not even with a really great bloody mary? Hmmm...\\n\\nThe concept of the place is great. It's a beautiful place to eat a meal. The drinks are creative and the one bartender on duty when I went for brunch time on a Saturday was nice. But that's what was weird, there are lines out the door at other places on this very street for brunch, but not here.\\n\\nI think the reason is the food - it's just not ready for primetime. BBQ is currently en vogue right now and Portland is trying its best. There are a few notable entries (look toward gas stations in Vancouver, for better options) around town, but Southland lacks a little something. I grew up in the South and know what properly smoked BBQ should be like. This is nothing special. You can tell all you need to know about a BBQ place by how good the brisket is. Anyone can do ribs and pulled pork or smoked chicken. Brisket separates the fakes from the real ones. This brisket was grey, overcooked, but still tender due to the amount of fat in this particular section. The gave me a part off of what is called the point - the really fatty part. That's fine, but it better be tasty! It was average to below average at best.\\n\\nI also tried the chicken and waffles. I could only eat about 1/4 of it because of how bad it made me feel. I've never had a more dripping, oily piece of fried chicken in my life. Which is too bad because the taste of the breading was actually not so bad. This one drumstick and half-breast was so greasy that it made the waffle they put it on completely mushy. Let alone putting any of their special butter or syrup on it.\\n\\nThe best high-point, however, is that house bloody mary they gave me. It was good. Try it (they put brisket on it and that is fine).\\n\\nOverall, I'd go back to try other things, but I know the BBQ is not properly smoked and won't have that certain something special that properly smoked food should have.

Not to say it is untidy, but it is lacking a system. You can order at the till, or you can sit down and get table service, but no matter what you do, it is not a beautifully choreographed performance. The whole operation relies on the servers being on-top of everything. I have not experienced it personally, but I am sure a few mistakes get made when things get busy. Lunchtime gets busy and because they don't have a system in place, they have hired quite a few servers to make up for it. That's one solution, but if they hired someone (with prior experience managing a restaurant) to design a better system of operations they could be turning more profit. They could be serving more people, with less servers, with less mistakes. \\n\\nWith all that said, sometimes the charm of family run businesses such as this, is the human element, the lack of a system. I didn't leave this establishment feeling great about the service, but when I opened up the food I took home with me, my frustrations vanished. They've got tasty burgers and sandwiches. The couple of things that I ordered were both excellent.\\n\\nI will go back to try more of their stuff.\\n\\nThe people here are all good people.

I discovered this place about 5 years ago, when my colleague was ordering food for everyone, and I had to go pick it up. What I've learned from James Snack is that you don't want to order on the spot when you have arrived. Clay pot rice needs tender love and care. It takes time to get the semi brunt crust to form and for all the flavors from the ingredients to be absorbed by the rice. I think it takes them at least half an hour of prep.\\n\\nI saw a lot of the other bloggers have been raving about the ostrich meat and sadly, I haven't had the opportunity to have it yet. The two I want to introduce to you today are:\\n\\nFree Range Chicken with Mushroom: The chicken is so succulent, and the mushroom adds a smoky flavour.\\n\\nMinced Meat with Salt Mustard: This is amongst my go to clay pot rice flavor. I like minced meat cakes. My favorite thing to do is to use the spoon to break the cake and then pour the soy sauce into the rice.\\n\\n \\nSteps to eat clay pot rice (my way):\\n1.)   Break apart the ingredients and the rice.\\n2.)   Pour soy sauce into the pot.\\n3.)   Eat =)\\n4.)   When you're done you'll notice the burnt rice crusted on the side of the pot. DO NOT leave that. Try to scrape it off and eat it. This is the BEST part of the rice.\\n\\n\\nJust want you to pay attention to number 8 on this card here. It says that it's FROG with ginger sauce.

So if you don't like a sourdough/sponge mix, you may want to choose another option like rice or pita bread). Unfortunately, we came 1 1/2 hours before closing and they informed us that they were out of Injera for the night, so we got rice instead(bummer). \\n\\nThe food is great! The spices/seasonings in the meats are powerful, aromatic, and will definitely have your palette doing cartwheels. I definitely recommend the fish, which is my current favorite there. They also throw in jalapenos which adds a nice kick. The vegetables are well seasoned, also. \\n\\nI've heard from others who've claimed that Desta isn't the most authentic Ethiopian food, but I say that great food is great food, and Desta definitely delivers on that.\\n\\nThe reason why a 5/5 rating immediately came to mind is because the staff is AMAZING and have been incredibly nice and attentive during all 3 of my visits."},{"name":"Hopdoddy Burger Bar","address":"1400 S Congress Ave, Ste A190","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Some of the best damned burgers on the planet.

I'm greeted warmly and ask about the lunch specials. No hesitation by the server, she gives me the rundown, there is a veg or a meat lover's option for 11 bucks. The meat lovers is butter chicken today, so that's what were going with. \\n\\n  For the record, I'm not a big butter chicken fan. I just think it lacks the amazing complexities found in a lot of Indian dishes.  However, It seems to be a gateway dish into indian cuisine and has many fans. What can I say,  butter and cream makes people fat and happy!\\n\\n  The dish comes with basmati rice,  chick peas, naan, and a chopped veggie salad. I think the salad is red and green peppers and cucumbers in a ranch yogurt sauce. I cant taste the ranch and the cucumber should have been peeled.  It's just too much hard skin Ruffage and not enjoyable for me. This might just be personal preference, I'm not sure how others feel.  The rice is standard. Now to the chick peas. Not mushy! God I hate mushy chick peas!  These chick peas  have the firm consistency I love with a decent sauce. Still well below the benchmark for chick peas that is the GM Restaurant in maple ridge but still good. The Naan is more than acceptable as well.\\n  So were left with butter chicken. Its sweet, rich and tangy. The kind of flavor great Italian chefs can also create by melding butter and tomatoes in a long steep simmer. Sitting in this love pool are 6 or 7 chunks of beautiful breast flesh.\\nHere, Ginger has overcooked the chicken, leaving some of the pieces dry.

For the main course, we ordered Po Tsel (with spinach), Tsel Shogo, Langsha Labu and Tsel Deyngo . Only the Tsel Shogo had some semblance of flavor or taste and the rest of the dishes were bland and with litle or no salt. While it is unfair to compare the curries to Indian food, overall it really felt like a bland spice-less and flavorless counterpart to South Asian cuisine. Lastly we tried Phagtsa Magu, a handmade bread cut into pieces, sauteed with butter and brown sugar for dessert and it was decent.

Not bad.  The chicken was moist, the crust was nothing spectacular.   The black beans and rice was really delicious and not a cilantro leaf in sight (thank you Jesus!).  I really was craving a flour tortilla to eat with my food but they were out and giving tortilla chips and salsa instead.  Somewhere along the way, the chips made it but the salsa was no where in sight.  I ate them with some hummus I had in the fridge.  Good chips, very crispy indeed.  I also got a flan which was okay in flavor but strange in texture.  Not smooth.

It's easily assessable by transit, and of course, there is ample downtown metered spots or parking lots in varied locations within walking distance.\\n\\nMy first impression of this market was sullied by GardaWorld security demanding that I open my purse, and quickly told me that my bottled root beer could not be taken inside. I had the option of quickly drinking it in entirety before entering, or I had to throw it out. Sigh, okaaaaay.\\nI expect the purse inspection(usually for alcohol) at a large concert with thousands of people, but at a Christmas market?\\nReally?\\n\\nWe passed the beverages-in-bags drill sergeants to the front entrance, the adult admission was $12 - I was given the option of adding a +$1 for a Christmas Season ticket, so I opted for that. I did, however have to print my name neatly on the ticket in front of the ticket kiosk staff ~ to prevent the unauthorized use/sale of this ticket.\\n\\nOnce inside, there were a good number of kiosks selling (mostly) European style holiday goods.

My wife let me taste the collard greens (which were just like the home made greens I ate in Dallas) and the fried green tomatoes (tasty but I did not dig the breaded crust).  I could not leave without having had the fried chicken, so I went with the chicken and bisquit...WOW!  Crispy...juicy...packed with flavor.   The bisquit was light and flaky. Their spicy syrup really finished it off nicely.  I'd make this place my regular morning stop before work just for the chicken bisquit alone...too bad their hours do not permit it.

The pork was pretty good as it still had fat lining the edges.  The chicken was just as good and tender.  The enoki mushrooms cooked with bamboo shoots were also delicious, although since she didn't grow up eating it was often, the flavors were pretty intense for her.  The cabbage was softer than what I'm used to, but still pretty good.  The fried tofu was definitely a hit.  The amount of food doesn't look like much in pictures, but there was definitely enough to get me full.  I was only partial to the boba milk tea though.  The tea itself was actually really good with the perfect amount of sweetness.  However, the boba was a bit tougher and bland, and I quickly got bored of them after a little bit.  If they marinaded their boba like Kung Fu Tea or Tea Haus, their boba milk teas could easily be solid competitors.\\n\\nOverall, the taste was pretty decent, and the home-cooked experience you get out of it was really comforting.  The food coming out of this truck is something you can't find much in Austin.

Tables are close together, and they were quite busy, but we got pretty good service.  The food; however, left nothing to desire.  I can't really remember what the dish I had was called, but it had a cream sauce that was INCREDIBLE, and for the price (which was under $20 for both of our meals), I was VERY IMPRESSED.

My two favorite \\"sit-down\\" Persian restaurants in Atlanta are Persepolis & Rumi's Kitchen - while I like the ambience at Rumi's much better, I like Persepolis b/c the prices are slightly lower and you don't have to do valet parking. \\n\\nWe had a party of 6, and even though the menu isn't designed for family-style dining, they made it work for us. Shared 5 entrees & 1 appetizer, and it was just the right amt of food. \\n\\nHere is what we got:\\n\\nComplimentary flatbread w/ feta cheese, radish, walnuts, basil, mint, onion, & butter. Honestly it was probably my favorite part of the meal - the flatbread is crazy huge and yummy, and even more yummy when you tear off a piece of the flatbread and wrap it w/ all the items listed above. \\n\\nTAHDIG - we ordered this app b/c it was one of my friend's favorites but I didn't care for it. It was beef stew w/ beans on top of a crispy layer of rice. Not that exciting and tasted salty. ($5.99)\\n\\nKHORESCHT GHEIMEH - the menu description says \\"cubed beef, Persian split peas, & sun-dried lime simmered in Persian tomato sauce w/ spices\\" but looked & tasted just like the Tahdig except w/ no rice & it was more expensive. Disappointed our server didn't let us know we were ordering an entree that was pretty much like our app ($11.99)\\n\\nCHELO KABOB-E-KUBIDEH - probably my favorite entree of the evening. 2 char-broiled skewers of ground sirloin, grated onions, & spices. Great flavor. ($10.99)\\n\\nCHICKEN BARG - this is the dish I almost always order (from Persepolis & Rumi's Kitchen). I thought tonight's version was a little salty though. This was the group favorite. ($15.99)\\n\\nVEGETARIAN ADAS POLO - the menu lists 4 different veggie kabobs and the only difference is the type of basmati rice that comes w/ it. We picked this one b/c the basmati rice sounded the most interesting: \\"steamed w/ cooked lentils topped w/ sauteed raisins, onions, & saffron.\\" Rice was good but the veggies were pretty charred and a little on the salty side. Still loved it though. ($11.99) \\n\\nKHORESCHT FESENJAN - ordered this dish based on the positive Yelp reviews but we didn't like it too much. It's chicken breast simmered in ground walnut and sweet & sour pomegranate sauce. I thought it was a little too sweet and everyone else in the group thought it was too tangy. ($11.99)\\n\\nEach of the 5 entrees also came w/ 5 separate heaping plates of basmati rice. We cleaned up just 2 - the rest we took \\"to go\\". Saying the portions are generous is an understatement. \\n\\nFor dessert, birthday girl got complimentary baklava - nice big piece, too :) Also ordered a piece of the mocha cake ($5.99). Both desserts were beautifully decorated :) \\n\\nOverall I'd give this place 3.5 rounded to 4 stars b/c service was really great. I loved that they accommodated our request to do family-style dining, didn't look down at us b/c we didn't order 6 entrees for 6 people, gave us generous portions, complimentary birthday dessert, and that unforgettable complimentary flatbread appetizer.\\n\\nI definitely need to come back and try their lunch buffet available Mon-Fri 11:30-3."},{"name":"Burnside Brewing","address":"701 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Their Beer overall is average, I've had a couple I really liked.

The garlic naan was also most singularly toothsome, but positively SEETHING with butter, so consider yourself warned.\\n\\nThe dishes came out in good time: everything was obviously cooked to order, and came out still sizzling.

They just served coffee and waffles were available, but not their main item. Laptops were banned and it was a great place for first dates, catching up with friends, or getting some time to yourself. I loved the Marymint Monroe because it was the only thing I could find in all of Austin that reminded me of Philz Coffee's mint mojito drink. I was still a fairly regular customer when they added chicken and waffles and slowly changed over to the Wild Chix name. The waffles tasted like they were made from scratch and had incredible flavour, as did the chicken.\\nI came again today and was disappointed to see a lot has changed. Gone are most of the coffee drinks (including the Marymint Monroe) and instead of ordering at the counter yourself you order from the very disinterested employee at the door and find a table. The waffles are now gluten free but unfortunately whatever recipe they've switched to has very little flavour and didn't contribute at all to the meal. I ordered the What the Cluck and my chicken was very dry. I couldn't taste the cheese at all. The truffle macaroni was tasty but came in the smallest ramekin I've ever seen a side come in.

My family is from Spain and I go 6-8 times per year, I was excited to maybe find a hole in the wall place closer to my house with home cooking.  It was ok. While there are lots of options, there are a lot of the repetitive options, like I think throughout the menu there was probably 6 or 7 lines for croquetas. My point, maybe have a dedicated spot for croquetas and list the various options, if you do the same with empanadas and cheese/cold meat plate options, you lose 1/2 that menu.  I think they should consolidate the repetitive stuff and then add more variety of real tapas, alone here is an awesome list: gazpacho, ensalada rusa, montaditos, Papas arrugadas, Chipirones, Tortilla de patatas, Alb√≥ndiga, Higos con Miel y Queso.  \\n\\nAlso not all but most of the portions were very small, like very very very small.  For instance, while there are some places in Spain that make tiny ball croquetas, most places make them like the shape of large sized hush puppies and the ratio of filling vs. what's inside is decent.  At Pinto, the filling was way more than the meat, and it was a tiny tiny ball.  \\n\\nThe paella wasn't moist or as tasty as I would expect, it wasn't bad but also wasn't amazing.  \\n\\nI would say the atmosphere is cozy, they have an amazing wine list, it was nice that they had vegetarian options and our waiter was amazing.  \\n\\nI think if they consolidate the repetitive items, add a handful of totally different choices, make portions a tiny bit more generous, it would be worth returning to.

Several staff kept looking at us awkwardly and just walking away, not taking a moment to even say \\"I'll be with you in a few minutes\\". I don't mind the wait at all, but to be completely ignored was weird. The food was good -- I got the artichoke omelette and really enjoyed that and their potatoes. However, I was thrown back when I saw that their milkshakes were now a whopping $7 for choc/vanilla/coffee, and $10 for Oreo/coffee Oreo, etc. It's weird because their website advertises their milkshakes to be a little over $5, which is reasonable. But... $10? For a milkshake? Come on now, you're not a fancy milkshake place. The price must have changed recently because I had their coffee oreo milkshake back in October, and let me tell you, there is absolutely no way I would've paid $10. Not when I can go to Boston Burger Company and get on their killer milkshakes for the same price, as they *are* a fancy milkshake place. Anywho, the moral of the story is, while their food may be good and the decor is cool, the staff were pretty rude and the food itself is largely over priced, and not being advertised correctly on their website.

Monica's was very inviting from the outside, huge windows open to the street and the tables didn't look to be on top of each other, as is the norm in most North End eateries, so we walked in. It was mid afternoon on a Saturday and only a handful of tables were occupied.  I'm sure that changed during the dinner hour.  Loved the open kitchen and the place had a welcoming vibe.  We were greeted by a very friendly woman who seated us right away.  It went downhill from there, we were ignored for an uncomfortable amount of time. We weren't offered water, nobody asked if we wanted a drink or to order an appetizer, not even a nod in our direction.  There was plenty of waitstaff there, we could see them gathered around each other chatting and laughing. After about 15 minutes of this we were just about to walk out when a waitress came over, apologized for the wait, and got us drinks and bread. She was friendly and efficient.  Hubby had the sweet potato gnocchi and i had spaghetti carbonara.  Both were delicious.  The bread was fresh with a nice crust but soft inside, and the dipping oil had an unusual but excellent flavor.  My red sangria was very good.  Somehow they got the portion sizes just right, from the amount of oil that came with the bread to our meals, everything was perfect.  No leftovers to take home but we had just enough of everything without feeling overly full. \\n\\nOur visit today got off to a rough and disappointing start.  For the price point - $70 plus tip for two dinners (no seafood or anything fancy), one sangria and an ice tea, no appetizers or dessert, I would expect much more attentive service.

Soon enough we saw the light and it came from the Burnside Brewing Co. restaurant/brewery, whatever you want to call it. Being craft beer fanatics we made a direct line in and grabbed a table. The atmosphere in there was much more our style. Groups of people sitting at their own tables, having fun conversations and drinking craft beer. No ridiculously loud music. No one drunkenly squealing and spilling their vodka drink on you. And no 15 minute line to use the one toilet in the establishment. Sorry, I'm still bitter about that other place. The bathrooms here are large and comfortable and there was never a line, or even anyone else in them any of the 17 times I visited while we drank through their menu.\\n\\nWe prefer to drink flights, so we opted for their MASSIVE flight of all 14 beers they had on tap (4oz tasters).

While she got a martini, I decided to try one of the alcoholic lemonade slushies. The slushie came out in a traditional glass and tasted pretty good for being an alcoholic slushie. The waitress also brought out waters in large plastic cups, which fit in with the beach side mentality one would look for at this type of place. \\n\\nWe then went ahead and put in our food orders. I decided to try out their fish and chips and see how they stacked up. While our food took a little while to come out (probably due to the place still figuring things out), the drinks and view helped keep the wait from becoming too frustrating. The fish has a good sized piece of haddock over some very tasty fries. While the food wasn't mind blowing, it made for a good dish and fit in well with the beach side mentality that one would look for at this type of place. \\n\\nAfter finishing our meal, I decided to order the bread pudding for the table as a fun little treat.

They only have 4 taps: Smuttynose Finest Find IPA, Pretty Things Jack D'Or, Brooklyn Lager, and Allagash White. Apart from 2 beers with Belgian yeast (albeit different beers entirely), its a selection ANY beer drinker can find something. (Yes even you bud and coors folks...live a little and branch out and drink a beer with FLAVOR) **steps off soap box** Their wine list was just as unique with only Spanish wines. I had the Vega Sindoa Viura/Chardonnay. It was slightly oaken with subtle buttery and apricot notes. It was a good wine and a good deal at $7 (especially with the pour they give)...It is a GREAT deal at $27 for a bottle! Having managed a restaurant and knowing the markups most restaurant take with their bottle selection ($60+ for Kendall Jackson Chardonnay are you kidding me?!?!), its nice to see they don't prove gouge. They took time and effort to develop a wine list that is traditional to their culture and pairs well with their food, they even have food suggestions in the descriptions. They also offer a tasty sangria which is what my wife had.\\n\\nThe food.....Oh My God! They really put their all into it and it shows. We started with the oxtail stew and the Kobe beef empanadas. Both were killer We also got the potato,kale, and leek croquets and Shrimp in spicy garlic oil. Both were very good as well. The shrimp were perfectly cooked, however I felt that the cooks were a bit heavy handed with the smoked paprika and the garlic that was sizzling away in the bottom of the crock was burnt leaving a lingering bitter taste that took away from the dish. Given the fact that EVERYTHING else was perfect I am willing to overlook this one minor detail ( especially since the place was packed with a wait the entire time we were there) This place has it all, and we are sure to visit again\\n\\nWell this place has it all...almost.

Yes, I usually order the same 5 or 6 items, and I've never bothered ordering anything other than Blue Moon to drink - except the one time they had Pumpkinhead around Halloween last year - but I'm rarely disappointed. The waitresses probably recognize my father and I by now, and i'm fairly on a first-name basis with the doormen, but I can't say I'm upset about that. The chances that my dad and I get better service than some other clientele might be pretty high due in part to the facts that a) we always tip well and b) 49 times out of 50, we're waited on by cute girls who are just trying to improve their keep for the night. This is par for the course. Whiskey's employs almost entirely women, and depending on when you go, they may or may not be appropriately dressed (tonight, they were; Friday night at 11, they won't be). \\n\\nThe only reason tonight wasn't great was because there was a large party hooting and hollering and making general fools of themselves, taking up the attention of the wait staff and really cramping the atmosphere - I appreciate a monday night party as much as the next grad student, but when everyone in your group of 30 is laced at 6 on that monday night, you don't have a party, you have a group of AAs in training. \\n\\nAnyhow, as with any restaurant, large parties showing up unannounced slow the service down. It happens. It's not a big deal. They slow the kitchen down. It happens, it's not a big deal. They might even cause some of the kegs to need changing. Again, it happens. Nothing that happened tonight was particularly poorly-done, it just didn't click the way it usually does. No big, I just decided now would be a good time to tell the world about it. \\n\\nIf you're looking for beer, the selection at Whiskey's is solid, draft or bottles. If you're looking for margaritas, this is one of many right places along Boylston street. I will admit that the Red Bulls and Grey Goose are a little pricey, but if you're ordering something that top-shelf, you deserve to pay a lot for it - it's the treasury's way of teaching you a lesson. If you're looking for quality bar food, there's no reason to look elsewhere. Fried, Starched, BBQed, Salted, Cheesy, Spicy, name it, they've got it. The nachos are particularly good, and the pulled pork sandwich - they do pride themselves on their BBQ, after all - is pork perfected. The Steak tips are another signature item, but don't be distracted by the more mealy items. From 4-7 during the week, they have half-price appetizers at the bar. Take advantage of this. And don't stop. From 10-1 Sunday through Wednesday, they have 99 cent 12-inch pizzas with the purchase of an alcoholic drink. You might think a 99 cent pizza late at night wouldn't be that good - you're wrong. It's absolutely delicious, and it's a shame they don't serve it in the dining room during normal mealtime hours. I digress. \\n\\nThere are a lot of good things about Whiskey's, and its atmosphere on the weekends and during Sox and Celtics games is great. The staff is always friendly. The food is always tasty, if imperfectly done. The beer is always cold. The TVs always have a great game or great music blaring from them, and there isn't a seat in the house where you can't see them. And if you don't agree with me, step around the block to Daisy Buchanan's on Newbury Street. It won't take long for you to see what you're missing."},{"name":"FLIP burger boutique","address":"1587 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"So I went to Flip Burger today for the first time without high expectations.

Inside is an oasis: well air-conditioned, nice decor, a few tables scattered through the front room where people were reading or plugging away on laptops. \\n\\nThe main dude who works here couldn't have been friendlier. He noted we were newbies, walked us through the menu, and is a fantastic face for the place. We both opted for kale wraps (mine mild, my cohort's spicy) and a side.

She gave me the \\"fuck you\\" look followed by a big shrug and told me that I hadn't ordered clearly, and before my astonishment from all that could have been fully expressed by my face, she very abruptly dismissed me and walked away.

Well... not ENTIRELY across the board but I'll get to that later.  \\n\\nAs we walk up, we were hesitant about eating here due to the lack of people in the restaurant.  There were less than a dozen people here when they could easily seat more than 100.  We had a party of 11 people and were greeted by multiple hosts and multiple waitresses.  The reservation was made 30 minutes before we got there and luckily they had room.  After being seated, we decided to get 11 summer taste platters.  The executive chef then came out and started to just make small talk, possibly due to the fact that they were having a slow time right now.  This gave it a nice and warm atmosphere and feeling.  \\n\\nFirst plate comes out - Seems to be a California Roll but not with immitation crab, instead very thick chunks of shrimp.  comparing this sushi roll to places in SD or LA, everything but the seafood was not good.  The rice was soggy, the nori was a ltitle chewy, but hey, that's not at all what matters, the shrimp was very tasty and hit the spot.  We at first were wondering why this came out because it wasn't part of the prix fixe menu.  It turns out the executive chef sent it out complimentary for our group.  \\n\\nSecond plate comes out - Combination Ahi Tuna Roll fried tempura style, Salad, and Calamari.  Nothing can be said about any of these three things that is negative.  The only way this could be improved is to cook the ahi tuna roll less so the tuna is more raw, but that's just my preference.\\n\\nThird plate (Entree) - Combinatino of asparagus, bok choy, lobster, and fish on a bed of shrimp risotto.  All here was also very delicious.  The lobster was cooked similar to Chinese style with a batter and fried with a delicious sauce poured on top of it.  The sauce did not overpower the lobster taste at all.  It was the perfect blend of different tastes.  The fish was cooked perfectly with grill marks and a moist and tender inside.  \\n\\nFourth (Dessert) - Green tea creme brulee, mango sorbet/ice cream, and chocolate ganache cupcake.  For some reason we didn't get the last dessert we were supposed to get but it's okay.  The amount of food on those three and a half courses were plenty to fill up every single one of us.  \\n\\nFor food and service of most of the wait staff 5+ star.  I'd give it 6 if I could (Yelp when will you let this happen?)  So why the 4 star rating?\\n\\n The waitress who had taken our order was simply miserable to be around.  She was inattentive, rude and very unprofessional.  There were times when she would roll her eyes at us for not answering a question she asked immediately after being asked it.  I can understand that people can have a bad day, but it almost seemed like she just got dumped by her boyfriend and WE were the ones she got dumped for.  \\n\\nAnother qualm I have about this place is the parking.  The executive chef informed us the restaurant will be moving in about a month to a different location downtown which will have worse parking, but the parking was hard to come by.  \\n\\nOverall, 4.5 stars 5 for food and 90% of the servers.  -0.5 star for parking and rude server.  \\n\\nThe total bill ended up being about $35 per person for the seasonal prix fixe menu."},{"name":"bartaco","address":"969 Marietta St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Bartaco was amazing!

Double Sips?) and the option to add lemon, lime, and/or ginger.\\n\\nTruly, Sip is an indulgence one can do daily and not only look better in a few months but feel much better too.

They had a muscle, shrimp, squid and green onion pancake on the appetizer menu.  I already knew I liked pancakes, so I got one of those too. \\n\\nMy house specialty was a seafood stone pot Bibimbab.

It was way to hot to eat, so I worked on the pancake and just let the little pot warm the front half of the restaurant.\\n\\nThe seafood pancake was a basket weave of green onion strips, layered with muscles, shrimp and squid, permeated with tempura batter, and pan fried.  This thing is to die for!  They dropped off half a dozen little plates with Kimchi, and an assortment of other tastes.       \\n\\nAfter half an hour my little pot had cooled enough to try and eat.  At the bottom of the pot was rice, then bean sprouts, greens and thinly sliced strips of spicy seafood on top.  The rice on the very bottom had cooked into a crust in the intense heat, and peeled off in golden brown strips.  The seafood strips weren't really recognizable, though I did see some little squid tentacles, but it was flavorful and spicy - had some heat to it.\\n\\nThe service was very good and helpful, but I got the feeling she wanted to correct us, like we were doing something stupid, but she was too polite to say so. Like maybe we were doing the equivalent of stirring our french fries into the soup.  She just looked at the table like she wanted to cough up a hair ball, stammered a little, and then waved it off.

Desta has competitive prices and good food.  Appetizers are around $5 and main courses are around $11.  The place does not have many tables inside the restaurant, but there is a large outdoor patio for outdoor seating.  Inside, the restaurant is dimly lit for a jazzy atmosphere. The wall is painted with earthly colors and decorated with many foodie awards.  Keeping its theme, the tables and chairs are of dark amber wood with a fine finishing.  I was impressed with the fact that they were playing their music through KRK studio monitors giving diners crisp clean music to listen to.  I ordered the sambusa & the kitfo (steak tartar).  The sambusa was a bit too salty in my opinion.  The meat had a smoky flavor to it which I enjoyed.  It was also not too greasy which is always a plus with fried appetizers.  The kitfo, which I got medium rare, was delightful.  The meat melts in your mouth.  The green onions complement the flavor of the meat nicely.  The juice (not really a sauce) had a salty and tangy flavor.  It was very light so its taste was subtle.  The injera was not too sour which was my complaint at the last Ethiopian restaurant I dined at.  The waiter was very attentive.  He offered advice on dishes and was informative on portion sizes.

For ultimate crisp, I'd love to see this fried into three smaller separate donuts. The Count Gourdough Cristo was tasty, but texturally a bit boring and lukewarm surprisingly. The ham was my least favorite component, I felt like it let the other ingredients down and the avocado lime sauce was a much needed condiment to counteract the richness.

My husband and I have been here 3 times in the last 7 or 8 months, and we live in Dallas--the last visit, we drove the 4 hours expressly to eat here. Dallas has nothing like this, sadly. \\n\\nThe creativity that goes into dreaming up each dish, and the skill required to then execute is simply, to me, awe-inspiring. I love how so many of the plates use very familiar ingredients prepared, altered and combined in ways most mere mortals would never, ever think of. I'm not a huge molecular gastronomy fan, but its manifestations here seem to have a purpose, not just \\"doing weird stuff because you can\\", and the \\"weird stuff\\" is really tasty! All I can say is, don't let the combinations scare you. If there's one ingredient in a dish that you enjoy, then order it and prepare for it to be served in a way you've never experienced before. Take a leap of faith. Trust that the chefs know what they're doing, and absolutely trust the wait staff--they know everything about each dish and also about the wines, and they are all genuinely nice people who are happy to be there and happy to have you there too. Listen to them when they say to order all at once. And ALWAYS try the blackboard specials!\\n\\nThe communal seating is cool, we've met some really nice people, but you don't have to chat with the neighbors if you don't want to. It's a very casual, relaxed atmosphere. I agree with previous posters, if you enjoy the art and science of cooking, the bar by the kitchen is the place to sit.

As you walk down the big aisle you grab a bag to write your order on - Which Wich style. \\n\\nThis burger was formidable. Sadly, I think the weakest link was the meat. But, everything else really brought the burger up. I ordered the junior (1 patty) with grilled onions, cheddar, mushrooms, tomato, lettuce and mustard. The buttery bread was my favorite, the free toppings were all done correctly and fresh. However, the meat was just mediocre- for the size maybe it's difficult to pack a lot of flavor and due to the thin patty maybe it's also difficult to keep juicy and easy to overcook. My boyfriend ordered the regular size (2 patties) and he had more of a meat taste- but he said it was ordinary decent meat flavor, nothing special.\\n\\nThe fries are hearty and not as crispy as I prefer. We accidentally ordered a large order of fries to share and this is clearly for at least 3, maybe 4 people minimum.  The strawberry shake was really good- much better than Mighty Fines for some reason. Although, it's pretty small, but then again it's $2.99.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is pretty typical of these places that have been popping up. One plus is no communal seating. I was sad that it was kind of empty because if you're into burgers the quality is superb for the price.\\n\\nWith a regular w/cheese, junior w/cheese, large fries, a shake and a water our total was $17.xx. \\n\\nThis place has healthier options (a turkey burger) and is a-ok to take vegetarian friends (veggie burger). I would definitely come back if I'm in the area and some of my other favorites are packed or if someone else wanted to go- but, I would not go out of my way or suggest it on my own.

The key players are the caramelized onions, jalapenos, and bbq and sassy sauces. Those really changed a classic cheeseburger to something else. There is a slight sweet taste from the bbq and caramelized onions, but the jalapenos balance it out. Plenty of jalapenos in the burger as well. The coolest thing about ordering this baby is that it's known as the Good Cause Burger because $1 is donated to a local organization.\\n\\n-Classic Burger (4/5, Angus Beef, Red Leaf Lettuce, White Onion, Ripe Beef Steak Tomato, Sassy Sauce, Classic Cheese, Bacon): You cannot go wrong with a great, plain cheeseburger. I personally didn't order this.. Just had one or four bites of a friend's with a dip of green chili cheese here and there.\\n\\n-Llano Poblano Burger (3/5, Angus Beef, Pepper Jack, Roasted Poblano Chiles, Apple-Smoked Bacon, Chipotle Mayo): This was the first burger I've tried here and wasn't that thrilled about it. I actually chose this from reading prior Yelp reviews. The most prominent taste from this burger was the angus beef itself. I would maybe add caramelized onions in this with an extra sauce.\\n\\n-Truffle Kennebec Fries with Green Chili Cheese (5/5): It is slap yo' mama good! One of the days that I had the 20 minute wait, the worker was advertising truffle fries with green chili cheese and chili con queso. We immediately dipped a truffle fry in both and knew the way to go was with green chili. Recently, it seems that we got less cheese than normal. However, truffle fries have the perfect crisp without being extremely oily. Try this!\\n\\n-Nutella & Chocolate Pretzel Shake (5/5): Fan of Nutella? (Who isn't?) Fan of sweet and salty? I highly recommend this. This shake is the subtle kind of sweet and salty that goes a long way with everything here. I was hooked on this after I tried a friend's. If you're feeling a little more adult, add some Bailey's. Get it, get it!\\n\\n-Red Velvet Shake (3/5): This is average with bits of cake in it. Literally like a blended cake.\\n\\nIT IS COMING TO HOUSTON SPRING 2016.

While the food was okay, the slow service, punctuated by a different member of the staff visiting our table almost every time, detracted markedly from the experience overall. \\n\\nWe began our first visit with their meat appetizer, and while most of the items, including the chicken tikka and seekh kebab, were good, the lamb component was extremely dry to the point of being wholly unappetizing. When our entrees arrived, the staff generally seemed confused as to how to proceed, unsure of whether we might want to keep the vegetables that remained on the appetizer plate; considering our table was roughly the size of four large phone books, the answer should have been quite clear. Overcoming this moment of uncertainty, I scooped a generous helping of Murg Korma (Chicken Korma) onto a pile of rice and hoped that the expectations set by sister restaurant Diva would be met. Quite unfortunately, they were not. While the dish wasn't unpleasant, it didn't have the depth and distinct flavor I've come to expect. Simiarly, the naan, which I'm not generally a fan of to begin with, was too doughy, further tarnishing my view of the restaurant. How is it that Diva does not suffer from the same problems? Whatever the answer may be, I'm happy for it.\\n\\nOn our second visit, we opted for the dinner for two, an option we've grown accustomed to ordering at Diva. The soup we began with was excellent, and the plate of appetizers that followed was also enjoyable, though with one exception: only one of a particular item was provided, a decision that makes little sense in a dinner for TWO. As an entree, I decided to try the spicy variety of their Murg Tikka Masala, and was unfortunately disappointed yet again. Having ordered the same dish at Diva, I noted a distinct lack of flavor present in this dish that could compete with the spice. Overestimating our hungriness, we chose not to finish the dinner for two, instead wanting nothing more than to escape this rather disappointing restaurant. Again, the poor service made this a challenging undertaking as we impatiently waited for someone to deliver the check.\\n\\nWhile I certainly wouldn't go out of my way to visit Bukhara again, part of me feels that I'm being too harsh given the high standard Diva has set for me. Save the lamb kebab in the non-vegatarian platter, none of the food was inedible. With more consistent and attentive servers and a bit of help from Bukhara's sister restaurants, it is quite possible that this could be an exceptional place to eat."},{"name":"Dancing Goats Coffee Bar","address":"419 W Ponce De Leon Ave","city":"Decatur","stars":"4","text":"This was almost a 4 star review. First timer here on this particular day and I must say, the ambience is great. Everything a coffee house should be. It's colorful, inviting and full of charm. The staff was a bit lackluster. I got dry personalities and little interaction which is odd because this place seems so much more open than that. No judgment there, I didn't go there to make friends with the staff (but I would have liked a new pal :( lol ) I went there for good coffee so I guess I don't really care about their personalities or lack thereof. I ordered a mocha soy latte which was actually disregarded as my initial choice once I saw they offered almond milk!!!  For an additional $0.30 keep in mind I've already paid $0.70 cents for the soy milk option so a whopping $1 for almond milk. This is still not the end of the world especially if you do you have dietary restrictions or you just care about your insides or you're on some sort of a calorie stricken diet. Yes it is going to cost you a premium with that being said I don't personally mind paying a premium for the finer things in life. The baristas were kind enough to not make me get back in line and pay the additional $0.30 cents they went ahead and created a lovely cup of craft coffee, super bonus points in customer service there.

The reasons - \\n\\n1) It was over-priced. A plate of 8 pieces of beef momo was about $ 13. 40. Momo is actually like an appetizer or snack and just a few months back, on my trip to New York, I had a plate of tasty big fat 6 piecees of momos for only $ 5.99!  To be fair, at Rangzen, a plate of momo comes with a small cup of lentil soup and 4 different sauces. But its still expensive.\\n\\n2) For the price, the taste was pretty ordinary, not very juicy or flavorful. So it's not worth the money.\\n\\nI've had momos in Nepal and in Tibetan restaurants in India many times and am looking for the best place in Boston for momos. I guess I have to continue looking as I am not planning to go back to Rangzen! \\n\\nWhile I haven't tried the thukpa (noodle soup) or other items, most of the main rice and noodle dishes on the menu were b/w $ 13 to $15.

If I had known, I would have just gotten a Classic with cheese. Instead, my boyfriend and I got the Llano Poblano and the Buffalo Bill. Both are topped with high-flavor condiments, but none of them came through at all.\\n\\nI had expected my Buffalo Bill to be spicy with a good compliment of blue cheese but it mainly turned out to be a bison burger with bacon. There was hardly any sauce or cheese, and the same went for the Llano Poblano. The buns were great, but I felt like the prices for the burgers went up $2-3 once topped with these things. I felt a little jipped. The fries were good. You can order the small and it will def feed 2-3 people. \\n\\nNormally I would ask for more sauce, but with the amount of people and our table being in a tight corner, it wasn't easy. \\n\\nI'd go for the classic with cheese, maybe bison as the meat, and a yummy drink if you want to try this place. The shakes also looked amazing.

The seating ranges from 70's orbital chairs, couches, swings (yes, really), even a little corner with Korean style floor seating. And, of course, some more traditional table and chair options, if that's more your style. The art was equally eclectic. It's one of those places that makes you keep wanting to explore, and I hadn't even gotten to the food yet. Your options here are basically healthy, or unhealthy: no in-between options. My friends all got the poke, and raved about the flavor and the generous portions of fish, while I opted for the soul chicken. Fried chicken on top of a waffle with butter and real maple syrup. The server told me they make everything from scratch, and it definitely shows! Again, really generous meat portion with the chicken, juicy and nicely breaded with just a tiny kick of spice, and a really lovely, fluffy waffle. I also got the milk tea, which got rave reviews from me and my friends. One of us ordered the iced tea, expecting the standard stuff you usually get, and it turned out to be the same \\"imperial wedding\\" leaves as my milk tea. This may be the only time I've ever preferred the plain version over a milk tea. Both were fantastic, but the caramel notes they mentioned in the description were even stronger without the milk.

The Wendy's slogan is very fitting when you order the dish - \\"...where's the beef??!!\\"   They should change the name of the dish to Peppered Mushrooms & Peas with Diced Beef Tenderloin since 90% of the dish is mushrooms and peas......definitely NO worth the $12.50 I paid for a plate mushrooms.\\n\\nThe rest of the dishes were eatable but not spectacular!

It has a good blend of American and Chinese food mixed together. \\n- The Asian food (ie: the bao) had a lot of \\"creative spices in there\\"\\n- More food on the American side\\n- Usually a line outside for dinner, so might be wise to make a reservation\\n\\nMaybe it is just my taste in food, but I just didn't enjoy the food as much as other people have. I have heard so much hype and rave over Myers & Chang (so don't think that Myers & Chang is not good), but it just really wasn't my kind of food. I would recommend you to come here if Asian Fusion is one of your favorite types of food!"},{"name":"Otto & Anita's European Restaurant","address":"3025 SW Canby St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Awesome!

For instance, they brought everyones tacos on the same dish. As the guest we had to figure out whose taco was whose. So different fingers on the tortilla was just a gross thought. Aside, from that if you have an allergen all the tacos are together on the same plate. You fill out a card of the food you want instead of just ordering with your server.

It has been years since I left a place so happy with the experience from beginning to end. We were a party of six and the wait was about an hour and half and I am not one to wait or go to a place who doesn't take reservations but I had been hearing how great it was since November and figured that I should give it a shot. So glad I waited. One the service was wonderful, a full bar to order from while you waited, great bartenders who knew how to make a good martini and had heavy hands. Hostesses were very pleasant and would give us periodic updates on how much longer we would have to wait, which only built the anticipation of what waited for you on the inside. Did I say it was worth the wait, because it was. Once we were seated in modern plastic chairs, which I first turned my nose up at, I realized that modern can be comfortable, the music playing was fun, relaxing and brought back a few memories of my earlier years in the 90's. Our waiter Neil was awesome. Not shy about recommendations, answered questions about menu and made us feel as if we were his only table, even though he had several larger parties near us. Let's say that he was enthusiastic not only about his job but also the food he was serving, I will be asking for him on the next visit. \\nNow the food, I had the Southern and it was just the perfect combination of flavors, not too heavy and the sweet potato tots with the blue cheese sauce were out of this world. Basically everyone in my party thought the same of their selections. Not one complaint only rave reviews and we are a rather tough crowd to please.

The 3 stars is for the lunch buffet only.  The cold/salad section of the buffet boasts a variety of veggies and appetizer type food.  Not bad, but not that different from the stuff you can get from the serve-yourself bar at Edgewood Kroger.  Heart of palm, artichokes, stuffed grape leaves, hummus and so on.  The hummus is simply chick peas and olive oil - no tahini.  I don't know why Persian places do hummus. Just because Iran's neighbors do it, I guess they feel compelled, but I would compare it to French beer - the folks next door do it much better.  Anyway, back to the buffet.  The hot side has a handful of rice based dishes to accompany the beef/lamb/chick kabobs, grilled beef and Sharazi (sp?), a nutty and sweet stew (this one with chicken).  The lamb/beef items were flavorful, juicy and delicious.  The chicken in all of its forms is bland and woefully dry.  Small bonus for really good baklava, but the not too bad yet not the greatest buffet selection (for $12) gets a solid 3 out of 5.

My friends decided on this place since one of them is Basque and wanted some authentic food.  They looked on yelp, and this is the only restaurant that popped up in Portland.  When they asked the waiter what was Basque on the menu, he said that he had to ask.  He came back saying that the restaurant changes its menu every so often, and they must have been thinking of the old menu, but the chicken was \\"kind of\\" Basque.  All the menu said was \\"bird\\".  That's it, no description or anything.  They all decided to try it though since it was the only Basque option.  The small portion which was $8 was half of a chicken breast in sauce.  That's' all.  No bread, salad, or any kind of side.  HALF of one chicken breast.  About the size of a deck of cards.  The chicken was over boiled, with a bad texture.  All of my friends described the sauce as \\"slightly gritty and tasted like muddy grass that had been turned into a sauce\\".  The \\"large\\" portion, which was $24 total, included two small extra pieces of chicken.

The food is consistently good, sashimi fresh and overall a great value.   I feel it's one of the best sushi restaurants in Portland because of food quality and value.  For example, dinner for our family of four usually comes out to under $90 with tip and alcohol.  That same dinner at Sinju (Bridgeport) would easily cost over $130 as we've done in the past.\\n\\nThe Tiger Roll is one of my favorites and they make a great tasting veggie tempura roll that is not on the menu but you can request it.  My only complaint is that their sake and beer selection is pretty slim.  I think this is one area they are really missing out on to increase alcohol sales with more selection offerings.  I saw the same sake brand they serve there at the local Asian grocery store and their markup was pretty darn low compared to other sushi bars.  So hey as long as their sake prices are very reasonable, I'm not complaining too loud.  So kudos to Ikenohana for doing that.\\n\\nTip: Go when their female sushi chef is working - usually weekends.

While the veal was both tender and delicious, my  favorite item of the night were my perfectly cooked medium rare lamp chops.

Where to begin? So I took my family to bjs for an early mother's day dinner. The 1 star is a generous rating that I'm only ok with giving since my grandmother was the only one fully satisfied with her ribeye steak. My sister ordered a turkey sandwich which had sour tomatoes and ham, she choose not to finish her meal. My boyfriend ordered mahi mahi, bland, dry and small portioned. My mother the mahi mahi tacos she was unimpressed. I ordered the house sirlion medium rare... Apparently this is foreign meat to bjs. The \\"steak\\" was tiny and over cooked and they forgot to load my potato....a nightmare that was just beginning, they took back my meal only to later bring me just a loaded potato...this was my meal. Then came another steak and potato, this time the meat wasn't even a steak more like a dry hamburger patty. Round 3 the meat again was questionable, I cut into it and no juices...plus the meat looked brown.,..meanwhile the potatoes wouldn't stop. At one point my boyfriend had to go find our waiter and beg for the potatoes to just stop coming. The 4th steak at least wasn't over cooked...BUT rare as hell. So i just gave up, enough was enough. Plus there was no toilet paper, my mother had to use toilet covers. That was my first and last visit to this over priced and poor portioned establishment.

Yet, my friends -- whose taste I trust in food -- went on another occasion and enjoyed the salad with lardons. This leads to me to believe that if you play it safe and order small plates and avoid seafood, you should be okay.

My friend arrived to find there was a reso for 4, for an hour later. They sat us at the bar, as they had no table for us, and claimed that I had made the change myself. Turns out, they had called the person above me in the reso book and that person had made these changes, and it had been written over my name.

There have been times where I have reserved a table for 12:00, and ended up waiting until 12:25 before being seated!  But I think this shows how amazing the food is here.\\n\\nAnyways, as mentioned in other reviews, this is a very pricey restaurant, comparable to Jade and Kirin.  We usually spend around $18-$22 per person here for dim sum depending on how much we eat, but I feel like that price is justified by the freshness and quality of their dishes.\\n\\nTheir siu mai is the best!  Even though my family is from Hong Kong and we go back there every year, we still feel like Neptune's siu mai is one of the best!  We haven't tried the 3-star michelin dim sums in Hong Kong for $50CND+ yet, but this place is serious comparable to the top Cantonese restaurants in Hong Kong!  Their \\"zha lern\\" , chinese donut wrapped in rice roll noodle, is the best that I've ever had in Vancouver and I order it every time!\\n\\nLastly, their desserts are very intricate and delicious.  My favourite dessert would be the Osmanthus jelly (gwei fah goh).  Now... I honestly don't know how to describe what Osmanthus is, but it's this extremely fragrant health bolstering flower found in Asia, which is used in many traditional Cantonese dishes.  The flavour is very unique and the dessert is delicate, refreshing, and cleans your palate.  Sometimes if we aren't full, we will order a heavier dessert after this.\\n\\nAnyways, you should definitely try out this restaurant if you're in Richmond because their dim sum is as authentic as it gets!  You WILL need to make reservations though because I have heard of people waiting over an hour for a table as walk-in guests."},{"name":"Kelly's Roast Beef","address":"165 Endicott St","city":"Danvers","stars":"3","text":"5-Stars, end of story...!\\n\\nOk, Kelly's is a name that is immediately recognized in the North Shore area.  It started with a location in Revere, MA, on the beach, that served huge portions of all the perfectly satisfying, \\"boardwalk\\"-style foods daily to beach-goers; and then soon became a late-night, meet-greet-n-chow, for after-hours, post-party drunks and anyone else who just couldn't bring themselves to go to bed before 5 in the morning.\\n\\nNow they've opened up other locations (thank god) and this one, in particular, is a true good eats blessing to have so closeby.  But, why is that?\\n\\n1. Award winning clam \\"chowdah\\".  This is not the thick, pasty, flowery kind of chowdah but the broth is more thin and creamy.  It's LOADED with clams; nice, small cubes of fresh potatos; and a dollop of butter melted in for a supremely, inimitable, this-is-definitely-Kelly's, taste.  I cannot get a small size, EVER.\\n\\n2. Lobster rolls.  No, excuse me, MUTANT Lobster rolls.  I think there's at least a pound of meat in them, maybe more.  But, they are HUGE and it's LOBSTER MEAT, not 50 stalks of celery mixed in to puff it out.  Some might say it's pricey (currently $16.50) but I personally don't care.  When I go for a  lobster roll experience, I want the BEST and I want it BIG and I'll PAY for it without complaint.  It comes with chips and pickles but, in my mind, I'm thinkin', \\"Who the hell cares?!\\" \\n\\nI throw 'em to the seagulls and eat the lobster roll...\\n\\n3. Fried Clams.  Ok, I think I'm unqualified to comment on the clam strips because I'm one of those who wants to eat a whole large order before I get there but after I eat 5, I start to get queasy.  It can't be because of the clam strips because my friend will literally sell his body for them.  I just find them a little too greasy for my taste but maybe they're supposed to be that way.  But, let me just say, those first FIVE clam strips are freakin' AWESOME!  Really.... \\n\\n4. Roast Beef.  Roast Beef.  And, (you guessed it), Roast Beef.  Kelly's is renowned for its seafood but it's also synonymous with (guess again!), Roast Beef.  It almost seems like a law that every \\"roast beef\\" place has to put \\"World Famous\\" on their outdoor signage, but Kelly's is the only TRUE World Famous Roast Beef in the North Shore of MA as far as everyone I know is concerned.  Always fresh, nice and rare, sliced real thin...gonna got me some right now.... ;)\\n\\n5. Fries, Onion Rings, Fish Sandwiches, Hot Dogs, Hamburgers, Roast Beef, Reuben... all very lovely, all very nice to have for those who don't get that Kelly's is about Clam Chowder, Fried Clams, Roast Beef and MUTANT Lobster rolls, but not for me.  But, it's good they have them and the Reuben's actually pretty good.\\n\\nAs for the rest:\\n\\n1. Ample parking on 3 sides of the building.  Easy in-out.  \\n2. Route 128 is nearby so you can get there quickly from cities up and down the road.\\n3. 1 Mall literally next door; another large mall 2 minutes away.\\n4. Plenty of seating inside but every so often the place is jammed.\\n5. Take out service RULES!  If you see a huge line when you pull up, just call in and you can, sometimes, walk in and go right past everyone waiting in line and get your stuff at the take out area. ;) lol, for real.\\n6. The inside is kinda light, airy and interesting.  There's a fish tank with exotic fish and a few nice bits of memorabilia from the Revere Beach area dotting the walls.\\n\\nKelly's is an experience everyone should have at least once.  Because, like a Lay's potato chip, you can't stop at just once.  You'll go back again, and again, and again, and again, and again.\\n\\nAnd AGAIN!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"name":"Clay Pit","address":"1601 Guadalupe St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I have a feeling the people who enjoy this restaurant are the same people who have never had Indian food before in their life.

A tomato-soup based sauce with previously frozen vegetables. It was bland and cheap, certainly not worth the $10 or so plus whatever we spent on bread. As another reviewer said, it's bland and overpriced. If you like the appearances of a fancy restaurant without actually having good food, Clay Pit is for you.

We used to go to the San Marcos location all the time when we lived there, so it was inevitable that I constantly compare the two during our dining experience at the Austin location.  The most readily apparently difference was the appearance and ambiance.  The San Marcos location feels like a mid- to upscale Mexican restaurant with a nice, polished interior and attractive bar area.  The Austin location feels like a hole in the wall with little in the way of ambiance at all and a bar that looks like it was ripped out of the discoteca next door.  Still, some of the best food comes out of holes in the wall, so I was not greatly put off by the appearance.  I ordered the enchiladas Oaxaquenas, which was my favorite dish back in San Marcos.  While we were waiting, we were given the typical chips and salsa which were almost identical to what you get in San Marcos.  The chips tasted like they came out of a bag but the salsa was fresh and clearly made in-house.  The entree itself was mixed.  The enchiladas and the mole that goes on them was just as I remembered from San Marcos with the mole giving a rich, earthy flavor and a subtle heat.  However, the sides that came with it were well below the quality I had experienced at the other location.  The rice was bland and mushy and I was given black beans in a cup instead of refried beans, and the black beans were very bland and appeared to be suspended in warm water.  The guacamole was the worst thing on the plate.  It tasted like runny avocado paste with no seasoning whatsoever.  The husband's chile relleno was also tasty but it was served with the same bland sides, though he was given refried beans with his entree.  I had a bite and they tasted far too strongly of lard for my tastes.\\n\\nAltogether, this was a mediocre dining experience.  I'd be willing to give this location one more shot to see if they were just having a bad night, but something tells me that nothing much will change.  It's a shame, too.

I would still have to put it down the list from Ruth's Chris and Three Forks but it is in that tier of steakhouses. \\nThe wait staff is professional although error prone (which hasn't happened to me at either of their aforementioned competitors). The banquet service was exceptional and the food was delivered hot and as ordered which is always a challenge with a larger group even when there is a limited menu. \\nThe dinner meeting was the reason they lose a star (and now I've decided two). It was busy for a weeknight, packed really. We were into our second drink at the bar before our table reservation was ready. The seafood appetizers were prepared behind the bar that night and the rapid fire oyster shucking was a minor show.  We were more than ready to be invited to our window seating though. \\nWe hovered over a rather common bread basket and there was a long interval between the sushi, our salads and the arrival of our steaks which lead to more drinks. Both mine and my colleagues steaks were overcooked. We are still talking about USDA Prime and I can enjoy anything between Medium Rare and Medium so it's not as if I was dissatisfied. Our waitress that night was not the person who served our steaks and by the time she checked on us we were already finished. She offered to comp us a dessert but it was getting late on a week night; the dinner was already creeping up on its third hour.\\nI also hear what H.R. from Dallas (J.R.?) is saying. Not that Dallas natives are somehow devoid of that same arrogance, in fact they may be the infecting variant here in Austin. I think the point is Eddie V's appears to be focusing on revenues from alcohol and not putting enough emphasis on the noteworthy aspects of their dinner menu. Drinkers, come to have a fine meal but eaters don't come if you are not prepared to drink.\\nI'd say the two other features that standout about this location: parking is non-existent.

Clay Pit on the other hand, is one written in the audience's own familiar language, albeit written with a graceful mastery of the audience's language.\\n\\nBy far, the Clay Pit is not authentic Indian. But I promise, this lack of strict authenticity is not a bad thing. Although, retaining a lot of the better elements of Indian cuisine, the Clay Pit has incorporated some elements of Afghani and (surprisingly) American cuisine, with splendid fucking results. \\n\\nWith that preamble out of the way, let's get to the food. If you're getting appetizers, you need to follow two rules. Don't get the samosas. They are miserable, dry, blandish affairs. Definitely get the curry crab cakes. Also don't go to the Clay Pit if you are not going to be ordering any naan. Clay Pit naan is life-affirming. And don't just get garlic naan. For the love of whatever you hold holy, try the other naans. Personally I wait for the day the Clay Pit decides to incorporate elements of faux-Italian-slash-American cuisine and already invent the naan pizza. \\n\\nFor the main course, get stuff off of either the Specialities of the House or Vegetarian Delight on the menu, for some easier-to-pick great fucking food. If you dare to venture off of those two choices however, rest assured that most of them explorations will yield something pleasant. If you feel like getting the Korma, don't. Get the Kabuli Chicken instead. It's basically Chicken Korma 2.0.

However, be aware there is better kheer in Austin. \\n\\nI think that's all the information you need to be armed with to enjoy the Clay Pit. For some interesting trivia, keep reading. Otherwise, make reservations as the place tends to get crowded for dinners. Or show up for a decent happy hour (all appetizers are half off) and stick around till dinner. Okay, trivia starts in the next paragraph. \\n\\nNaans are made in an oven made of clay. Hence, the name. Incidentally a lot of Afghani bread is made in a clay pit. Before housing the Clay Pit, the address has housed a brothel and a grocery store. As some of Austin's older residents will still remember, the grocery store that once was also has a horror story that some claim still haunts the Clay Pit.

My fav thus far is butchers cut.. just a plain ol good burger you can really taste the pot roasty type meat they grind in there (I think it's short rib??) Steak tartare, weird! the bun makes this burger awkward at best.. rBQ, surprisingly good (I'm usually not a fan of BBQ unless I'm at a BBQ place bc other places rarely smoke the meat) but if you like more than one animal between your buns this one could be for you.. (please don't take out of context) Korean BBQ - good, not great a little too not extreme to be extra special. Southern - blah, I have the curse of having to order anything on the menu that lists pimento cheese as one of its components. this burger was a letdown.. it is battered and fried... not in a sinfully delicious way just in an excessive way, ps. green tomato ketchup not good either. Ossobuco - good if you like murdering babies! that's a joke btw. Chorizo- decent sandwich but burger it is not. and onto the fry menu. I am not a fan of the batter used so the onion rings, okra, pickles.. all blah (sort of a funnel cake taste to it) the sweetbreads had a different batter, but not worth ordering.. save sweet breads for somewhere fancy! Fries are in the same style as five guys (but five guys are better) frys aren't very crispy. the smoked mayo served with the frys is fantastic! and now for dessert. The Pistachio milkshake is super yummy! the Krispy Kreme tastes like doughnuts were blended with vanilla ice-cream... chunky badness... in-case you are wondering, I didn't eat all these burgers, just went with a big group and sampled... side note, wine is a heavy pour.. so you might be paying a little more for a burger, but you can make up the difference in grapes!

So lets start with the good and go on from there: \\n\\nAtmosphere- 5/5 instagram-able place. Lots of mix and matched furniture, lovely incandescent bulbs, throw pillows with cute sayings, a couple of swings. There is going to be ~something~ in the decoration that you will find interesting. The chandelier is wood with what seems like crystals hanging from it and small lights wrapped throughout. One thing I found strange was the number of artwork depicting nude women. Don't get me wrong, I can appreciate art. One piece of tasteful nude artwork has an artistic flare. But when you have 5+ pictures on the walls (esp considering the size of the cafe), then there is a \\"umm...\\" moment there. \\n\\nFood- 2/5 Nothing fantastic about the food. The waffle on the bottom was soggy and not warm, the egg salad and slaw was not cool (was it even refrigerated?) The presentation was ok, although I have to give credit to the plate design for doing much of the work. I had the chicken waffle sandwich with a side of \\"slaw\\" and what seems to be an egg salad. The chicken was oily and bland, although I can tell they put in effort to season the batter, it did not speak to me. The waffle has a asian twist to it. When you pull on it, it does not pull like a typical waffle you find at an all-american dinner. After much thought, my friend and I concluded there must be some tapioca starch/flour in the mix. The slaw was very bland and bitter. The egg salad was watery and was leaning towards the acidic side. At first I found it to be tolerable, but I could not find myself finishing it. For ~$14, the food cannot justify the price tag. At this rate, you are certainly paying for atmosphere. One thing to note was that my order originally had a hair inside it (Read more about this under \\"Service.\\")\\n\\nDrink- 3.5/5 Matcha Latte with almond milk. This was given to us on the house because of the ordering mishap (see \\"Service\\".) It certainly has a matcha essence. I had my fair share of matcha beverages. When done right, it can be lovely. Unfortunately, that was not the case here. Again, presentation was nice. I appreciate the tea cup and saucer it was served in, I appreciate the latte art, but the taste was missing. Perhaps the almond milk changed what it was suppose to taste like. Something that can be fixed if they offered skim milk. They had the option of whole milk and almond milk and I picked the lighter of the two.  First sip had almost a seaweed taste. And again, I have had a number of matcha beverages with a pleasant \\"earthy\\" taste, seaweed was not the part of the earth i was expecting to taste. After a few sips, it just never grew on me and I never finished it. Again, this was given to us on the house. \\n\\nService-1.5/5 Going in, you place your order on a tablet, from there you find a place to sit and wait for your name to be called. Nothing bad about that. A modern concept that can help with workflow in a busy cafe. However, the first time they called our name, they had the order wrong. We ordered a chicken and waffle sandwich, but we got plain waffles (Mishap1-not terrible because it can happen anywhere at anytime.) The next time they called our name, they gave us chicken and waffles instead of the chicken and waffle sandwich (essentially the same as the sandwich but instead of the slaw and egg salad, you get syrup and butter.) This was Mishap 2- at this point my friend and I were getting hungry and dissatisfied. Finally the right order was received. After taking a few pictures, we were ready to feast. However, upon closer examination there was a hair wedged in my sandwich (Mishap 3.) I went up to ask for an exchange and the worker refunded us our money and gave us a new dish. The folks in the front (near tablets and coffee maker) were nice and accommodating. The question is what is going on in the kitchen? I saw one of the workers wear a paperboy hat and a low ponytail, the other's had short hair so the hair in my food did not match there's. Perhaps one of the workers in the front who had a loose braid? Perhaps it fell in the batter when they premixed it earlier? Who knows. But hair in food is not something I want to find anywhere at anytime. 1.5/5 because they were nice about it and refunded us.

The seating arrangement mostly involves bar stools, individual couches, and small tables.  This place is packed throughout most of the day; so keep your eyes peeled for empty seats while waiting in line and/or waiting for your drink. \\n\\nFood and drinks are really solid here.  If you order a plain cup of joe in one of their stylized 'for here' mugs, then the first refill is free.  Their espresso drinks taste great, and I always appreciate their apparent care and artistic touch in making them.  I also like their scones because they are really soft and fluffy and not hard and crusty; their cranberry and chocolate chip scone is awesome.  Hopefully, that's a keeper even though they don't really have a 'menu' for baked goods per se; you just have to come in and see what's up.\\n\\nDancing Goats is a cool environment in which you can easily get comfortable.

There was a brief wait, and it definitely got longer as the night wore on. I was lucky to find parking right away, but it looked pretty chaotic as drivers desperately circled around, hunting down any patron on their way out the door.\\n\\nAs a low-carb, calorie conscious female, I was worried I'd leave Flip starving and with a considerably lighter wallet, but neither concern seemed to be a problem. I opted for the mushroom swiss burger (vegetarian option) and a side of pickled vegetables. They were very accommodating to my low-carb demands and put the burger on a bed of lettuce. I was pleasantly surprised by the pickled veggies. Served in a small jar with a light vinegar base, the zucchini, beets, and squash had just the right amount of an acidic kick (and the little jar was precious). The burger was definitely not huge, but it was filling. The patty itself was a bit mushy and oily, but the flavors were satisfying, and I left nothing on the plate. \\n\\nOne of my friends got the lamb burger, and my other friend got the original Flip hamburger. Both got fries and enjoyed everything. They also split a Burnt Marshmallow & Nutella shake (the restaurant is very willing to split a shake for you in two smaller, less sinful sized glasses), and they raved about it. Everything came out pretty fast, and the service was friendly, knowledgeable, and efficient.\\n\\nMy total check, without tip, came to around $11. No complaints here.

It specializes in steaks, featuring Porterhouse, Filet Mignon, New York and others (NY and Filet coming in petite versions of 10 oz and 7 oz respectively for $27.95). The steaks come with a choice of 4 potato preparations (including garlic mashed, fries and baked) and a vegetable choice of steamed brocolli with cheese, fresh of the day (which was grilled Brussell Sprouts) or a couple of other choices. They have an excellent wine list including some nice local Willamette Valley Pinot Noirs, well known for their quality and fragile delicacy to master. A daily special list of fresh seafoods, including wood plank Salmon and seasonal offerings like Halibut are also available, with most seafood in the $20 entree range. Desserts are well made and include favorites like Creme Brulee, Tiramisu and an excellent Peach Crumble, as well as their special Chocolate Souffle Tort a la mode, all ranging in the $5.95 to $6.95 range. The restaurant has elegant wood panelled decor in a deep rose color wood with wine colored red leather booths and cherry wood colored captain chairs. Service is professional, knowledgeable and attentive. This is an excellent choice if you have a desire to have great steaks complimented with good fresh seafood selections and a wine list that would satisfy most in their variety and quality.\\n\\nPS - I didn't try it yet, but this place has been voted into the top 10 for best Happy Hour in Portland!

And , as I found out that night, any self respecting hipster does not carry a Coach bag, Coach is considered the equivalent of Isaac Mizrahi in the handbag world. Also, don't drive a minivan, after the snide remarks I heard outside of the people leaving in a min van... bring your BMW or Lexus, maybe rent one for the night.\\n\\nThing two, this is not a reason to not dine at coast, I was just pointing out that if you the kind of person that cared what people thought, make sure you come dressed appropriately with attitude and all of the above. Men included- especially if you are looking to score.\\n\\nThing three, make a reservation if you are coming on a weekend. Ask for a table on the balcony so you can see and hear. Eat at the bar if you want to hook up or pass idle time being flirted with (but heed thing one).\\n\\nOnwards, the lounge was fascinating.

The fish are all grilled, that's it, nothing really done to them, all with the same vegetable side, I had the mahi mahi (which tasted like grilled mahi mahi, and my friends had sable fish, ditto for the prep description).\\n\\nOn gimmicky restaurant new age mumbo jumbo. As opposed to getting a description on how your fish is to be prepared, instead you get a description of where your morsel of seafood came from... for instance (and I kid you not) \\"Bengal prawns, caught by the Nguyen family in Vietnam\\" Seriously , it says this. Thank you Ngyuen family, I forgot to request an address to send my Thank You card to.\\n\\nThe service was good but I was a little put off that our male server was sweating profusely. I would have recommended a Botox shot but noticed that all the male servers were doing same, perhaps the male servers needed to wear the hotpants and fishnets? Servers had attitude, nice attitude which I enjoyed, nothing like a little banter. Everyone working there that I came into contact with did a great job, no qualms on the service.\\n\\nCool little female plus. Bathrooms on every level, bathroom in the lounge, bathrooms downstairs AND a bathroom on the balcony, no teetering down the steps in your heels to a packed bathroom. Tres cool, bonus points, Advance to Go. Also, they have  cash machine in case you forgot that you needed to pay your valet $8 in cash ($10 with tip if you want to wait 30 min to see you car next time, $15 if you want to be valet BFFs).\\n\\nSo, summary, would I go back, yes for appies and wine and maybe give them another chance on my main.

Where my complaint lies is directly with the terrible \\"server\\" I had from dining there on a Friday evening. \\n\\nI was meeting a friend here for dinner and drinks and running late.  My friend ordered an appetizer and glass of wine while waiting for me to arrive.  Once I arrived and sat at the table, the \\"server\\" asked me if I'd like a anything to drink.  I ordered a glass of wine and subsequently began talking to my friend.  When the \\"server\\" returned with the wine she asked if we were ready to order.  At this point we said we weren't and requested a few more minutes.  A few minutes later the \\"server\\" came back and asked if we were ready to order again.  Again we were not ready, but this time she stated we needed to order something within the next few minutes.  Not understanding why she was in a rush for us to order our dinners we eventually ordered our meals.  While waiting for our meals, our \\"server\\" neglected to bring a table setting with silverware or napkin for me while the appetizer sat on the table getting cold.  Eventually our meals arrived and when done our \\"server\\" cleared our plates and asked if we would like to hear about desserts, when I said I would; the \\"server\\" scowled and recited the dessert menu.  After seeing her facial expression, I decided against ordering any dessert from her.  She then abruptly handed the check to us.  We felt throughout the whole meal, the \\"server\\" to be unprofessional, rude, negative and poorly trained.  When she was confronted by how we felt about her service and the dining experience, she actually gave us an attitude and a smart ass reply.  Totally unacceptable in my opinion.  \\n\\nMy overall opinion about this place is definitely SKIP IT; unless you enjoy spending your good hard earned money for really lousy, rude, inept, unacceptable service and a poor dining experience.  I really wish I could give this \\"server\\" and experience no stars, unfortunately one star is the lowest I can give.  For my money, I would look for other great restaurants and not recommend this place to anyone!"},{"name":"Monica's Trattoria","address":"67 Prince St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I live on the same street and a lot of people have recommended.
