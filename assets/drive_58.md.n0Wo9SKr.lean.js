I'll admit.. we did have a small wait of 5 whole minutes, which is nothing compared to other places within the area. \\n\\nAbner's has a nice little outdoor patio to bask in some sun and nosh on morning, afternoon, or evening eats, but it was a little chilly, so we passed.

That is the sizzling hot plate and the quick and efficient serving from ordering to table service.  It has to be fast. \\n\\nTonight I had the mushroom burger made for. Shimeji mushrooms.  It was tasty.  A bit in the thin side, but tasted good nonetheless.  I do think if it was a bit thicker it would be juicier and more presentable.

It was like a fresh Kimchi.  Good to go with any beef pairings.  I like the fact that they have this side dish available now.  Why not add a bit of spice to your Pepper Lunch!  Besides it also a good probiotic for your digestion and it's vegetarian too.\\n\\nIf you want seafood, there is the Hokkaido Scallops with Pasta.

Did i mention that you get 4 summer rolls for 3 bucks. You just can't beat that.\\n\\nFor the main course I had the Bun Hue spicy soup. The soup was absolutely delightful! Since I like to kill my self with hot food, it wasn't as spicy as I would have liked, but that was ok cause they provided a really nice hot pepper paste which you could add to your soup. After adding some of the pepper paste my soup was perfect! Another great thing about the soup is that it wasn't over salted and you could really taste all of the actual flavors. \\n\\nSomethings to keep in mind if you go here:\\n1. It is a really small place only a few tables. \\n2. They are only open from 10-6 or 7 depending on the day. \\n3. The food is very reasonably priced\\n5. This place is cash only\\n\\nI can't wait to go back and try more of their yummy food :)"},{"name":"Zed's","address":"501 Canyon Ridge Dr","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I can't say enough positive things about Rachel Landa and the events team at Zed's.

To be fair, it was Easter Monday, and they clearly didn't anticipate the volume of customers that they ended up having, and wound up severely understaffed. However, that's no excuse. Our burgers took around half an hour to be served, which seemed long. The line cook came by with a refill of fries, and ended up placing them such that they fell of the table moments later. He must have heard the loud noise of the tray falling on the floor, but he didn't turn around. In fact, none of the staff walking around seemed to \\"have their eyes open\\", and just kept passing right by the pile of fries lying on the floor. No one visited our table until it was time to pay. Very disappointing. However, our server was acting as bartender, and when he did come by he was genuinely apologetic, and even offered to pack some up for us.\\n\\nAt the same time as all of this, the table across from us had been waiting for ages for their burgers, and when they arrived, I overheard them say that one of them was the incorrect order.

I am always willing to pay the price tag for this buffet because I think the price for value is above fair for how much I eat.\\n\\nI have been going to Nori Nori for a long time and I went a few weeks ago and was disappointed by the new sashimi distribution. Instead of the large glass bowl of sashimi they now have little plates with two pieces a plate. I think this is highly inefficient since I see people grabbing like 15 plates a time as soon as the server puts them out. This prevents a lot of other people from getting the sashimi they want to eat. If this is an AYCE buffet then I think Nori Nori should revert back to the old system. \\n\\nBesides that I am still very happy with the nigiri, sushi roll, and hand roll from the sushi side. The hot foods were also good as usual. The oysters were unavailable this particular night but they are normally very good. I really enjoy the high quality and variety that Nori Nori has to offer which is why I keep coming back for the dinner buffets even though it's upwards of almost $30 on the weekends. \\n\\nI love the hibachi grill where you can get steak, scallops, shrimp, chicken, and veggies, the soup/udon station right next to it and the rib eye kabobs by the grill!

You can never go wrong with their fried calamari, which I consider to be the freshest and best tasting that I've had in quite a while.  The fact that I've seen people order calamari as their main course speaks for itself.\\n\\nAs for their main dishes, I would recommend the broiled haddock because not only was it well seasoned, but it literally fell apart right in your mouth.  You don't know what  flaky means until you've tried this dish.   I preferred this dish with their white sauce as opposed to the red sauce, as I found the olive oil and garlic complementing the flavor of the fish much better.  I also immensely enjoyed the monkfish marsala, which had a firmer texture with a sweet and tangy flavor to it. \\n\\nAnd finally, if you have a +1 with you, get the Lobster Fra Diavolo.   Seriously, read the description, read it again, and order it.  You won't regret it.

It was our first time there and the temperature inside was reasonable. It was pretty hot outside but folks were eating out on the porch so with a breeze, it seemed bearable. My sister, boyfriend and I are not vegan, vegetarian, etc. we simply came just to try out new experiences. \\n\\nHere's what we ordered:\\n-omelette scramble with a side of kale salad: this omelette is interesting. Definitely not what you'd expect from your typical egg omelette. However I really liked it! It was different but very filling. I added sriracha sauce to it which helped with the flavor.\\n-breakfast burrito - my boyfriend ordered this and said it was alright. He had to put a lot of the sauce on it and chipotle sauce to eat it all. He doesn't think he'd be able to eat it without the sauce. \\n-strawberry French toast with a side of the sausage: my sister didn't like the \\"sausage \\"at all. Adding some sauce to it helped her wash it down though. The French toast was pretty dry since there's no syrup but I really liked the cashew creme that came with it. Eating it with the strawberry slices also gave more flavor to the palate. \\n\\nService was decent, nothing over and beyond the minimum service we were to receive dining there. I wish she would have done more by recommending menu items and being more interactive/engaging  with us since it was our very first time there. \\n\\nReason I'm giving this 3 stars is because although I personally enjoyed it, my sister and boyfriend probably represent more of our meat eating friends and they weren't too blown away or enjoyed their dishes as much as I did.

Our entire meal at Cantina was delicious - authentic chilli rellenos - and cost $20.\\n\\nI have dined and worked at the finest restaurants in the world, and if the chef were brilliant, then the prices and presentation would be okay.

Great price. Ask them for suggestions, they're super nice."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"With this second dining experience, I can say unreservedly that Pok Pok serves seriously good Thai food, my food memory did not fail me and despite escalated expectations after reading other excellent reviews about their NYC outposts.  But I  digress...I must first preface this review with an account of a rather unpleasant encounter with the hostess.  \\nHere's the short version:\\nApparently, there are different seating areas.  One that is nice and warm inside and two that are in tents, nice and chilly albeit with some sparsely positioned heaters.  My first visit to Pok Pok was Nov. 2011 so no, I didn't remember the different areas. If the hostess doesn't ask your preference, state your preference.  Otherwise, you'll end up having to advocate strongly like we did to sit inside.  I'm a nice diner so I'm very mindful when service is lacking, or actually hostessing skills are lacking- our server was wonderfully attentive.\\n\\n\\nThe long winded version:\\nWe arrived on New Year's eve 2012 to place our name on the list and were told that the wait would be 20-30 minutes and that the Whiskey Lounge across the street was their de facto waiting room if we chose to pass the time there.  We gladly did given the 34 degree weather.  I had the fragrant lord bergamot cocktail with the bergamot infused vodka and honey drinking vinegar.  It had a tang and lightness that could have enabled me to keep sipping and sipping.  I barely noticed the alcohol, a serious drawback for light drinkers who don't know their limits!  We passed on the first table we were offered since we had just received our drinks, a mistake in retrospect because the wait for the second table was longer than the first.  By the time we were offered our table, it had already been 45 minutes and the drinking food on the lounge menu was increasingly becoming more enticing.  The hostess showed us to a table in the tent which is nowhere I want to eat  Chicken wings with bare cold fingers!  We asked to see the bar which was also available and then noticed that several tables were waiting for their checks and one was empty.  Our inquiry about these tables were met with some nonsensical explanation that it was saved for some other people (?!) and that we had to wait an additional 20-30 minutes.  As we persisted, she pointed to the empty table and offered us the table accompanied by the statement, \\" you can have this table but the other party will have to wait\\".  \\nWas it her attempt to guilt us?  It was hardly necessary to convey her logistics difficulties.  It was more likely an unprofessional and unfair remark that made her customers feel like interlopers.  We took the table despite my unease.\\n\\nBut the food and our aforementioned lovely server made it just a fleeting bad taste rather than a lingering one.  I ordered my second cocktail, an apple gin rickey, another tasty and fun drink full of snap made with apple drinking vinegar.  The water, a revelation during the first dining experience was no less enjoyed the second time.  I've not encountered a Thai restaurant in the states that infuses the water with Pandanus leaf.  The lady next to me was marveling at the rice flavor of it the whole time.  \\nThe dishes we tried:\\nIke's Vietnamese fish sauce wings-greaseless, crispy, balanced spice with sweetness, with a glimmer of the sauce.  Served with pickled daikon and carrots to cut the fattiness.\\nKaeng som thaleh- pork belly and shoulder curry- rich and unctuous, slightly sweet,  perfect over rice.  \\nDa chom's laap meuang- a minced pork salad.  Like the larb I had at a Thai temple once, it lived up to its spicy description.  The heat doesn't hit you until the third or fourth bite and by then, you'll have tears in your eyes.\\n\\nWhat started out uncomfortable developed into a very memorable meal.  Thanks, Pok Pok.  Food is great-just got to train your hostess a little bit more.\\n\\nI can't wait to try Andy Ricker's pad thai place in NYC!"},{"name":"True Food Kitchen","address":"222 West Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Very accommodating and the food is healthy and delicious.

Of course he was obliterated and had been there before we even showed up. They also tried a stand up gig for the night and the crowd was more interested in acting like buffoons and looking for one night stands than a little comedy. It was obviously the wrong setting for a stand up venue.\\nI had been to one other Graffiti Junktion location and the only thing I remembered was how good my hamburger was. Apparently that must be the only good thing on the menu because my turkey sandwich I ordered fell apart as soon as I removed the toothpick. Plus I couldn't get the sports venue I wanted to watch on a nearby television because it was used for their in-house advertising and power-point slideshows. Not that I could really see the game because I begin to lose interest knowing that I had to wait for the sun to go down to get the glare off the television. We sat outside and had a decent size group.\\nI know that Longwood is not downtown Orlando and this is probably the local hookup spot for the young crowd. I totally understand as I live in a city which shares the same circumstances. But when you take a local restaurant chain that as far as I know is relatively unknown outside of Central Florida and try to build its reputation you have to put your foot down sometimes. There needs to be more crowd control, security and someone needs to mind how much alcohol is being served. I got pretty much bombed out of my gourd by the end of the night and it was easy.

Parties over 5 can reserve a table and you best if you plan to eat with a party that large.  For being a James Beard awarded restaurant, I was so pleased to have nice servers with no pretension or attitude. Just a lovely overall experience. \\n\\nThe brussel sprouts are AMAZING and the pork belly/shoulder is as Don says, BOMB. \\n\\nAlso, they have a special menu alerting all the allergens in their foods -- so if you are a glutard or lactard or whatever... they seem to be sensitive to you."},{"name":"Sichuan Gourmet","address":"91 Middlesex Turnpike","city":"Burlington","stars":"4","text":"Delicious tingly numbing spice, characteristic of Sichuan cuisine and the food here. This place opened for business in the last several months and is a great and welcome addition  to the neighborhood. We got takeout on a weeknight and the food was ready in 15 min and everything was cooked perfectly.\\n\\nChengdu dumplings. (5/5) This was a winner and was chosen based off the other reviews. Dumplings are meat-filled and come in a slightly thickened spicy sauce. Dumplings skins were soft and slightly stuck to one another when we got ours. Meat-filling is delicious. Sauce is the star. Spicy, tingly, slightly sweet.\\n\\nDry fish fillet (5/5). Another great dish chosen based off reviews. This was my favorite. These are strips of white fish that are delicately fried with the spice incorporated into the flour (rather than a sauce) Despite being fried this was a surprisingly light dish. If you want to try something unique, this is the one.\\n\\nBeef & Napa Cabbage w/ Spicy Chili Sauce (4.5/5). Tender slices of beef stir fried with cabbage and celery in a rich spicy chili sauce. What surprised about this dish was how tender the meat was. It comes thinly sliced and some pieces almost melt in your mouth. Cabbage was good balance to the dish. It is sliced like kimchi. The sauce was rich and spicy. While the sauce was amazing the first few bites, the richness gradually turns into greasiness later on. Still worth trying.\\n\\nMapo Tofu (3/5) Soft silken tofu in a hot chili sauce. This is a great dish to spoon on top of rice. The dish was good, but it seemed it felt like it was missing something and not quite what I expected. It's simply tofu in chili sauce. This dish is typically based on fermented black and has minced meat, but this seemed like it was missing both. This is worth getting, but temper expectations if you've had this dish before."},{"name":"Boston Common Coffee Co.","address":"515 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Great Place.

The food was ok overall and the service left much to be desired. It felt like there were a ton of employees working as it was a Saturday a lunch. Luckily there was space at the counter so we didn't need to wait for a table. There would always be a huddle of 3-4 servers hanging around by the register apparently not doing much because we had to wait a while for our water, then to give our order, then there was a good 10 minute stretch just waiting for the check once we were done eating. With all those bodies floating around you'd think they'd have a better system to take care of their customers.\\n\\nNow onto the food. I ordered the Garlic Tonkatsu Ramen because if you are going to go for it you might as well go for it. The flavor of the broth was good. Extremely garlicky which is what I wanted in this, but there was only 1 thin slice of meet in my bowl of noodles...for $12 i'd at least expect a little more substance. I enjoyed the noodles themselves the most. The flavor and texture were great. Also ordered some gyoza and takoyaki. The gyoza were good, but the takoyaki were mostly dough and not enough octopus. \\n\\nI really wanted to like this place since it's right next to where I live but as far as ramen goes there are several better options in Portland I will venture off to first before I go back to Kukai."},{"name":"Ceviche Tapas Bar & Restaurant","address":"125 W Church St","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"I lurrrrve this place!

For my main dish I ordered the traditional garlic tonkotsu shoyu ramen and it's one of my favorite things to get on the menu besides the miso ramen.\\n\\nThe reason I'm giving this place 2 stars is because even though this place has the best ramen I've tried yet, it's had the WORST customer service I've experienced. Never seen our server after she took our order (girl that wears dangly silver earrings) they don't pre-buss dishes so our table was filled with plates and bowls and trash, and it's not like there was things still inside they were all empty. And to make things easier for them we even stacked the dishes so all they have to do is just take it off the table. But nah, they just left it. No one came up to ask us how everything was after they dropped off the food, the only time they did come up was to secretly drop the check and didn't say anything. Ugh and what's even worse is that they add automatic 18% gratuity to parties of 6 or more (we had 4 adults and 2 kids) so that's probably why they didn't bother to provide excellent service from us, you most def know we didn't add anything to the tip. What annoys me the most about this place is they never once refilled our waters, everyone's cup on the table was empty. However, when the card was in the checkbook that's the thing you guys see? Before even handing over the check I stopped and asked for the person to refill our waters and the guy had the nerve to give me a stink look, LOL!!! No apology or anything but he did refill them AFTER being asked. I'm blunt and I don't care, i said \\"It's funny how they can see when the check is ready to be paid but they can't see all of our waters empty.\\" They're just lucky I haven't said anything because I was with my boyfriends family. But believe next time if I receive the same service I'd be talking to the manager about not paying that 18% because you guys did not deserve it at all!! (Btw management, we were sat on the booth right next to your server station so this complaint wasn't just out of no where. We sat right next to your servers standing around talking stories and doing nothing sometimes. My advice is to have a talk with your team about their behavior in front of the customers or to move your server station to somewhere we won't be able to see them goofing off because that's hella annoying.)\\n\\nPS: don't say things in Japanese if you don't know how to pronounce them or know the meaning of it.

My husband ordered and I was in the middle or ordering when a bus boy stepped in front of the waiter and asked him a question! I was mid-sentence. Worst of all, the waiter proceeded to have a conversation with the bus boy and ignore me! Needless to say, he missed my drink order. \\n\\nWe ordered brunch, and I have to say I was disappointed that they had advertised a mother's day brunch and didn't have a special mother's day menu. Oh well. Someone else at our table ordered soup as an entree and steak/eggs as a main course, and they brought everything out at the same time. The waiter didn't seem to understand why my friend didn't want his soup at the exact same time as his entree. My friend sent the soup back to the kitchen. We were a table of 5, and 4 of hte entrees came out, and one just didn't. We had to ask for it. As for dessert, the waiter seemed caught off guard when we asked for dessert menus. We ordered some coffee, tea, and a piece of pie to split. The dessert came out right away, and 15 minutes later, some of hte coffee/tea came out. We were done with the dessert by them. Then the waiter put the bill down on the table! The rest of the party was still waiting on their coffees! I mean really, this is supposed to be fine dining. \\n\\nOverall, there was an amazing amount of staff buzzing around doing absolutely nothing. I counted at least 5 food runners and many other wait staff, and no one had control of the dining room. If there was a manager there, I would have complained, but no one appeared to be in charge. \\n\\nBoston has plenty of great restaurants, and I would NOT recommend Bistro du Midi.

Maybe I only experience this because I go here several times a week? I dunno.\\n\\nThey don't get everything. Yes, it's true.

It's like the company purposely hires the snootiest, most holier-than-thou people they can find. I've been going to this store for years and there's only been a handful of times when I felt like the cashiers were friendly and helpful. I generally don't need a lot of help in a bookstore (I'm a big nerd), but at least smile at me when I fork over my hard-earned money, okay? And don't sneer at me because the used books I'm selling aren't cool enough.\\n\\nThis place is always way, way, way too busy, even in the middle of the day.

Parking around here is kind of a pain unless you're willing to pay. I was lucky and found free street parking right around the restaurant (beware: the ones right in front of the restaurant is 2 hours only). You can park in the garage behind the restaurant and they can validate it so that you will only pay $7 max. This is great if you plan to hang around this area later into the night. My friends ended up parking here for 6 hours and still only paid 7 dollars. You can also do valet, but their lot fills up fast.\\n\\nThey did not take reservations and did not allow us to get seated unless we had 5 out of the 8 people in our party. There's not a lot of waiting space in the restaurant so I felt like we kept getting into people's way while we waited for the rest of our group to show. Eventually we were seated. They have a lot of burgers on their menu. I ended up getting the shrimp and grits ($16) because I wasn't feeling a burger. The food took a while to come, maybe because there were a lot of people here tonight watching a football game, but since we were in no hurry we just sat around and talked.\\n\\nWhat I liked about the dish was the grits part was two pan fried grit cakes with sausages inside (a little crispy on the edges, yum!).

I been here for dinner a couple of time but it was expensive and I don't like cold snow crab. I decide to save some money and see what the difference in food was for lunch. Lunch was almost half the price of dinner at 18.95 per person and my 3 year old daughter was 60% off. They base that on her height which they measure when she walk in. All the buffett where I live are becoming pig sty and always give me stomach ache so my family decide to give nori nori a try again. The display of food and sushi was very clean and nice not like other buffett where they dump the food like they are feeding pigs. \\n\\nI notice two things that kind of bother me. First the tongs were really dirty but the lady didn't change them. I couldn't find a clean tong to pick up sushi because they were cover in sauce and rice. So when no one was looking I just use my finger. Second the lady at the kabob station was using her bare hands to rotate the kabob. She didn't touch the food but just the stick but she could have wore plastic gloves.\\n\\nIf you read my previous review I don't like my food sweet just my dessert. The food was not bad but they all taste a little sweet. Ever item had some kind of sauce drizzle on top. I literally had to pick piece of food that wasn't cover in sauce because I don't like sauce that I don't know what it is. It also seem every item taste similar. They deep fried food and drizzle secret sauce on top. The dessert was just ok too.\\n\\nMy waitress was nice but she didn't refill my drink. I think she didn't speak English. I ask for refill and she just walk off. My mom had to yell   \\nCOKE and point to glass before she came with another drink.\\n\\nOverall it's was good and I like the ambience of the resturant.

I found them to be distinct, and they were easy to decipher which flavor was which. The shell had a light crunch and easily cracked when I bit into it. I found the filling to be creamy and sweet, but not overly so. I also think they have a great variety of not only common flavors but a few unique ones as well (which I love since I'm an adventurous eater!)\\n\\nThe salesgirl was also super friendly! I wish I remembered her name, but she was very polite and made me want to make a purchase even if I didn't like macaroons!\\n\\nThe only negative I could think of was I wish we could select the flavors in the bag.

We ate the popcorn, but didn't finish it. \\n\\nFor the entree, I ordered the Texas half baked chicken that is covered in a Dr. Pepper flavored BBQ sauce, and a side of baked mac n cheese. My friends both ordered a fish entree, I can't recall which one though. When our plates arrived, I couldn't stop staring at my food! Wow! I prayed that it tasted as good as it looked. And it did!! The chicken was juicy and easily fell off the bone as I cut it with my fork. The sauce was AMAZING. It had that subtle Dr. Pepper flavor and the tang of southern BBQ.  I ate most of my chicken but I wasn't able to finish it all so I took the rest home.  I wanted to ask for more sauce to take home but I totally got sidetracked because my friends and I were so busy chatting and catching up. The Mac and cheese was cheesy, creamy, hot, and had buttered bread crumbs on the top that really put it over the edge. After I finished it, I was wishing I had more. Both of my friends cleared their plates. Not an ounce was left! We couldn't stop talking about how great the food was!\\n\\nAll 3 of us were extremely pleased with the quality of service and food.

Granted we walked in late but other patrons were seated after we sat down.  First thing the waiter said was \\"the kitchen is closing\\".  It was all rush rush rush.  The food was delicious but all the waiter and waitress need to work on their customer service skills.  I really hate going to a restaurant where I have to rearrange the table so it makes it easier for the waiter/waitress.  Then what is the purpose of tipping.  After 10 pm, a young Thai waitress asked \\"if we are done with the sriracha and hoisin sauce\\", I told her \\"not yet\\".  Then she asked a second time but yet we haven't finished our dinner.  We enjoyed the food but the service was THE WORST.  The waiter asked if we needed to order anything else and I ordered mango sticky rice.  The dessert came when we were only half way done with dinner.  Were the workers in a hurry to go home for Father's Day celebrations or that is their normal protocol.  Finale was when the same young Thai waitress asked if we are done with the sriracha and hoisin sauce for the third time, this was her exact wording \\"you are done with it, right?\\", no duh, we only had one plate left on the table.  If she had proper restaurant customer service training, she should never address the customer that way.

We waited another 10 min for the waitress to ask us what we would like to drink, by then I was all ready to order and this was my first time here. We ordered the pok pok,  ike's chicken wings, the boar's neck dish along with a side of jasmine rice. \\nOverall the food tasted good, however the portions were a bit small especially the boar meat dish, and on the pricey side as our bill was $50 for the two entrees, rice and two drinks from the bar.\\n\\n\\nDetails:\\nThe chicken wings were $12 for the equivalent of about a dozen wings. It came with a side of sweet pickled daikon radish, carrot and cucumber which was tasty not too sweet or sour. The wings were reminiscent  of a slightly spicy, teriyaki crispy glaze. They were good but way overrated.\\n\\nThe boar's neck dish was disappointing small , but the flavor made up for the this. For $12 there was only maybe 4 ounces of meat along with a few springs of chilled mustard greens on the side. The meat was a bit over cooked and cut kind of thick. The sauce had a nice kick with a complexity beyond just spiciness. It was sweet , salty and maybe some fish sauce with citrus and spicy. It just keeps changing in your mouth. The hype I heard about the chicken wings and pok pok came  nowhere near the reality of the actual dish but OMG this dish...that sauce made this place a 4 star review.\\n\\nThe pok pok reminded me of lime flavored cole slaw, which was totally disappointing. For $8 I expect more than slaw.  They do also try to sell you the sticky rice with it for an additional 2 bucks. But I ordered the jasmine rice instead.\\n\\nThey have a small indoor dining area with a bar (Whiskey Soda Bar) and a covered outdoor area and a outdoor take out window. \\n\\nFYI they do charge various fees for split checks and credit purchases under $10 and for 18% gratuity parties of 5+."},{"name":"DUOwusa","address":"875 Woodbury Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"This place is amazing and delicious.

After finding two different people and asking for service they sent someone who was on his first day of serving. Ever. With no training. No. training. He asked us for a drink order while we were sitting at a dirty table with no menus. Then he said there was no alcohol menu. We should have left. But it was 50% off and at this rate probably free. Never brought our waters (after asking three times), brought the wrong drinks, out of guac (really!?!?), cold queso- I'm talking refrigerator cold. And there were like a dozen chips in the basket.

Oh, no- it doesn't matter if there are couples trying to enjoy quiet conversation nearby, he whistles away without a care in the world. If this man is the manager-  it explains the poor service that other reviewers have had... he's too busy whistling to manage anything!\\n\\nThis past weekend marks the third time that I have had an experience at Finale ruined by this man's incredible lack of tact.  Recently my boyfriend and I were in the upstairs room and he was setting tables right beside us and was just whistling away, so loudly that it was impossible to concentrate on a conversation. I have never found whistling to be so irritating- and I was not the only one who noticed. I overheard the couple at the table beside us contemplate asking him to stop. When the woman sort of glared at him, he intentionally began whistling even louder. That couple decided to leave without dessert- the best thing Finale has to offer!\\n\\nThis man's behavior is absolutely unacceptable, it is reminiscent of the behavior you would see in a rowdy downtown bar, not at an upscale (overpriced...) desserterie, where couples want to enjoy quiet conversation.

I'd never been to Casa B, so I suggested we try it. Their bar was packed as well, but they had a table for two. We said we'd take it, and we're glad we did. The atmosphere was cozy and the menu and the decor immediately brought us back to our recent trip to Bilbao and Barcelona this past summer. We shared the bu√±uelos, Puerto Rican pot Roast, and the sandwich de pollos pinchos (or \\"pinxos\\" as they would say in Bilbao). The service was a little slow, especially the drinks which came out after we were halfway through our first plate (the wait staff was a little overwhelmed but they were very courteous and honest about it), but everything was great. We both loved the Puerto Rican pot roast, which was the perfect comfort food for a frosty February evening. At the end of the meal, my wife surprised me by making an executive decision to order the Brussels sprouts on impulse. I was sorta of done, but the Brussels sprouts were amazing. By far my favorite. I think there was yuca mixed in with the Brussels sprouts, and it had a wonderful Asian sauce to it. Highly recommended. All in all, our dinner was probably twice as expensive as the beer and bar food we had been hankering for, but the whole way home my wife was commenting on how nice our Casa B experience was, and how wonderful it is that this place is in our neighborhood.

Cue the music!  But seriously, hubby was a good sport and I ratcheted my normal foodie weekend levels WAY down.\\n\\nSo of all the places on my bucket list of 20 Most Important Restaurants in America from Bon Appetit in 2013, I figured Pok Pok would be among the top.  After all, they landed at #8 on the list, as well as highly ranked on many other national lists.  Thai/ Vietnamese is some of my favorite cuisine and I LOVE spicy!  Portland is known for inventive, tasty cuisine.  The hype for this place is just tremendous.\\n\\nSadly, I wasn't as blown away as I had hoped.  I do believe the way to dine at Pok Pok is to roll in with a big group of not-too-hungry friends.  That way, by the time you get through the hours-long wait and actually are hungry, you can try quite a bit off the menu family style and start to get a good barometer of this restaurant, as the menu is ginormous and hard to decide what really should be ordered.\\n\\nOur little party of 2 arrived at ~1:10pm on a Sat afternoon for lunch.  After about 10 minutes of waiting our turn to get to the hostess station to put our name down, it ended up about another 20 min wait for the table, but we spent some of that walking along Division St in either direction for a couple of blocks to look around.  Given how long I know wait times for other Yelp'ers have been, I felt pretty fortunate.\\n\\nOnce seated, I was pretty excited despite the fact that neither one of us was as hungry as I wished we had been (breakfast still lingered...).  We were seated in the air-conditioned section inside on the upstairs floor and with the homeland shots lining the walls and sparse decorations and seating, it felt pretty authentic.  And when the menus came, we were definitely hard-pressed in deciding what to order from the many choices.\\n\\nWe **had** to get the Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings (Spicy), if only to see what the big deal was about.  This is 1/2 dz whole chicken wings (=HUGE wings) \\"marinated in fish sauce and sugar, deep fried, tossed in caramelized Phu Quoc fish sauce and garlic and served with Vietnamese table salad.\\"  The first one was delicious and I was digging it.  The second one was definitely getting a bit too much, due to it's extreme saltiness.  By the third one, I was dying and these wings definitely were not so tasty any longer.  Again, had we been a larger party and been able to have just one each, it would have been perfect and I probably would be craving them right now.  \\n\\nWe also ordered the Kung Op Wun Sen.  \\"Wild caught gulf prawns baked in a clay pot over charcoal with pork belly, lao jiin, soy, ginger, cilantro root, black pepper, Chinese celery, and bean thread noodles.  Served with naam jiim seafood.  The Chinese influence on Thai food in full evidence.\\".  We liked this one better, but it was still fairly salty.\\n\\nAll in all, I might go to Pok Pok again, but with a crowd and in a much more hungrier frame of mind.  It's definitely not something I am craving, and I felt we tried better restaurants during our weekend in PDX.\\n\\nSorely disappointed based on my experience with its position at #8 on 20 Most Important Restaurants in America (BA 2013)."},{"name":"Moretti's","address":"5849 Sawmill Rd","city":"Dublin","stars":"4.5","text":"I had mixed feelings about Moretti's tonight.

It didn't have the normal pasta beads, but I don't know enough about the soup to know if that is authentic or not.  The flavor was very good.\\n\\n* The Veal Moretti was a travesty.  This was intended to be a veal cutlet, breaded with linguine in a cream sauce with mushrooms.  It was more along the lines of a pound of butter sauce, because the sauce had no flavor other than that.  I, of all people, love me some butter, but a cream sauce should NEVER be so buttery that it tastes like that and one can see the congealed butter in the candle light.

I love that they have a staple few flavors, plus rotating seasonal specials with fresh fruit muddled in to prove it's freshly mixed! Not too many flavor options that it's overwhelming, like La Fogata for example. They stick to what they know is good and will sell. Sangria and beer selections are both great. Wings here are actually really good, and I love that they morph that kind of stuff into burrito or taco form etc. Waffle fries and queso MMM! Patio seating is clutch - not a ton of opportunity for that around campus anymore. Reason for just 4 stars - bar service I've always noticed is slow. Mainly on very crowded gamedays, though I think it's important they master that. Wait staff service though is always very accomodating and helpful, especially considering they deal with big groups and majority students. Great student and BuckID deals.

I've also had the boston creme which is really good, and I do love the beautiful presentation and mini-desserts. I went there for Valentines Day 2007 and 2008 and although they change their dish for 2 each V-day I just started to get bored with Finales. I do love their Varlhona hot chocolate yum! I've been there about 5 times and re-ordered the cheese things and one time the bread that comes with was kind cold/ stale. I think it's kind of over priced too- like it's fun to try once or twice but I think it's more the novelty.

Since I had my dog I looked on the windows for any no dog signs, I looked inside and saw no inside seating, then I figured this is Austin, on Barton Springs at that. so I go inside, takes about 4-5 minutes for her to help the people in front of me, I decide I am going to get the Berry Godmother as my first drink at this new and interesting establishment, the lady politely asked me if my dog was a service dog? I said no, she said the dog had to go outside, so I said nothing turned around and left, I understand dogs are not allowed at certain places, but she could have atleast offered to take my order for 1 drink outside, as I was alone, jogging and had no one to hold my dog,  or say what do you want I bring it out to you, I am a local Austinite, born at Brackenridge Hospital downtown Austin and I was very surprised to experience this.

In any case, yesterday we had the opportunity and the hunger and with the always-packed parking lot it can't be bad, can it? Walking in you pay the $7 for all-you-can-eat buffet first (plus a drink if you want one, we just got plain water). The staff was very friendly but the server a bit slow to come back to the table once the initial glass was delivered. The place was very busy - this was at 2:30 PM or so on a Friday afternoon - kind of amazing that so many were in there wolfing down so much food. Interior was the same as your usual Greek Diner offering in Atlanta, over-the-top mirrored and marble surfaces, etc. which I'm guessing Kacey inherited from the previous tenant.\\n\\nThe food lines themselves were rather disappointing - after going to any of the mega Chinese buffets or even Golden Corral, the two short hot lines plus one dessert table seemed rather sparse. I tried just about everything on the menu - the best entree was the fried-chicken (which is to be expected), however the breading isn't anything special and it wasn't particularly hot (also I thought I was eating a partial breast then realized it was a micro breast that still had the tiny wishbone attached - slightly larger than squab - I wonder where they buy their chickens?). There were three seafood entrees - I tried them all and preferred the fried Ocean Perch and Whiting (surprised there wasn't any catfish) - also pretty average corn coating. The baked tilapia was dry and not finished. The tartar sauce was perhaps the worst I've ever had - gummy, way too tart and a peculiar aftertaste - I still cringe at the thought of what might be in there. They had this ground-beef chili also - tasted like Hormel's to me (fine if you like canned I guess).\\n\\nThe veggies were all very average - I did appreciate the collard greens and boiled cabbage. The mashed potato gravy (from the salisbury steak pan) was just plain bad tasting. The soft yeast rolls were good. I noticed that the food in general wasn't as salty as you normally find in Southern food, which is a plus. The salad dressings were all your average food-service big jar brands.\\n\\nThe most disappointing thing for me was the dessert table - the peach cobbler was gooey, the chocolate pudding horrible and the chocolate pies (or is it cheesecake?) looked old and crusty - I passed on those. Surprisingly the best dessert was one made with canned fruit cocktail, cake and whipped cream. Not enough here, even with the enticing all-you-can-eat price of $7 to get me back for a second try. If you're looking for buffet, go to a Chinese mega-buffet or Golder Corral. If you're looking for good quality Southern in the same area, try Matthew's Cafeteria right down the street in downtown Tucker."},{"name":"Mad Mex - Columbus","address":"South Campus Gateway, 1542 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"Ordered through grub hub and it got to me quickly but food was pretty boring.

It was prepared well and was super tasty. \\n\\nHowever, we were also dining there with the hope of warm hospitality. They fell so abysmally short in this category, that I will never EVER return to this business again.  I was so disappointed to have spent my hard-earned money on this experience that I was angry when I left. NEVER in the 10 years we have lived in Portland have I had this kind of welcome from a waiter/waitress. And this is why they get 1 star.\\n\\n First off, if you're in the business of hospitality and customer service, at least pretend like you enjoy it. Fake it if you need to.  Don't bring your baggage to work. I really think we ruined our dark-haired, bespectacled waitress' day (I sincerely hope she isn't the owner!) when we came in and asked for a table of 8. She was so upset that we would be in need of chairs from another table (there were only enough chairs at our table for 6) that she audibly clucked when we asked of them.... She brought them over, kind of mumbling under her breath, and I asked if there was a problem. She said 'Yes. There is. This really won't work. I have to 'give up another table 'to give you these chairs. BUT THAT'S HOW IT GOES, I GUESS. OH WELL.... YEP, OH WELL....'  (Side note: there are maybe 10 tables in the restaurant, and during our entire visit there was never a demand for 'that table 'nor was there a line of folks waiting on this Sunday morning.)\\n\\n This was the welcome we got. And her treatment of us during our stay was on par with that welcome.  Our food was thrust on our table, and water glasses were begrudgingly refilled. Unfortunately, we ordered more food and that was just annoying to her.....\\n\\n Another side note: If you don't want to welcome kids to come into your restaurant, be honest. Put a sign on the door if you need to. The transparency would be appreciated and preferable over the open resentment of their presence.  And I say the following with all honesty as well- our kids were all well behaved and well mannered. I fear for the experience of those with even slightly unruly kids.\\n\\n So in the end, she got her big party tip from us because it was built into our check, but if it was my choice, she would not have received a penny.

There are just a whole of places that are good but not great, enjoyable but safe, and generally formulaic. I like suggesting Island Creek because despite a few faults, it feels original and reflects coastal New England style in an upscale and consistent manner.\\n\\nAlso interesting is that new restaurants in Boston tend to show off early and go the extra mile with service and then slowly pull back over time once business is comfortable. Island Creek to me is much better now than when it opened two years ago. It's kind of settled into its niche without having to compete with the other expensive restaurants in Boston with typical large entrees and instead has its own style of menu that feels fresh every time you sit down.\\n\\nThe cocktail list was a little too weird if I recall when it first opened, though I think they swung too far over to the conservative side eventually. Not to say they don't have great bartenders who can make any drink (they do) but the cocktails here are a bit boring in terms of spirits. They have interesting flavors, but they're of the \\"one spirit and some sweet stuff\\" variety. I'd like to see a list more like Eastern Standard's or No. 9 Park's, even if it was a separate list that you had to ask for. The beer list is typically quite good and aligns well with food they serve.\\n\\nService is usually good. There have been some odd servers in the mix but they generally don't mess anything up. I like that the hostess table is well manned at the front and you can count on a friendly greeting even if the restaurant is packed.\\n\\nThe clam chowder is awesome. I've had just about all of the ones that are considered the best in Boston, and none of them match this for flavor. The key additions are homemade biscuits and large chunks of good bacon that will you quickly find yourself fighting over if you share a bowl. \\n\\nThe oysters are of course terrific, though you have to swallow your deal-hunting instinct before you swallow any bivalves. I love good oysters but $3/per takes a bit of the fun out of knocking a bunch back. I will typically only order these at a full dinner and even then just a few to try ones that I haven't had. I really wish they would offer dollar oysters at an off-time where they wouldn't be taking a hit on the expensive orders. Perhaps a Sunday brunch offering with one kind of oyster featured each week?\\n\\nSome good memories at Island Creek:\\n\\nSitting out a hurricane at their front window over a bowl of clam chowder.\\n\\nAlways cleaning out the fresh bread and cayenne honeybutter.\\n\\nPeople watching from the small booth at the front window.\\n\\nDiscovering the wonderfulness that is Brooklyn Sorachi Ace on tap.\\n\\nIntroducing some first-time visitors from Canada to lobster rolls and clam chowder (and then realizing I'd found my new favorite clam chowder).\\n\\nA table full of lobster rolls and good crisp beers on a Sunday afternoon."},{"name":"Thai Wok Kitchen","address":"5000 E 4th Plain Blvd, Ste A101","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"It's quite simple really, this restaurant is on point in every way.

The calamari came in a small cup which was disappointing considering it cost 12 bucks.  After about 20-30 min, we were confused at where the other food was. We were pretty fed up with the service and the food itself wasn't that great so decided to ask for the check and cancel the rest of the order. When the waitress comes by, we inquired about the rest of the order and she nonchalantly said \\"she had forgotten about it and it was her fault.\\"  This worked out for us but it came off like she knew she forgot and just never told us till we asked.

It is truly depressing to be deprived of the full menu there - the take-out window (with its painfully small selection) is a 2-3x/mo gig for us because we have a toddler - where the decor is oddly cool and the steak salad sings with delicious pungent spices and the wings are so addictive that one could almost cry for them. \\n\\nOver time, I have seen the backlash to the country-club-looking set's arrival, which has been an increasingly condescending wait staff, replete with tats, beads 'n scruff, talking to customers with their eyes closed.

Very fun and very Union Square (aka trendy). We had:\\n\\nThe passion fruit daiquiri which was delicious. Very refreshing\\n\\nThe hamburguesas which were by far the best thing on the menu. Two come in an order so I'd get like 16. \\n\\nThe gnocchi and pot roast which was very filling and the gnocchi far out shined the roast. But still overall great\\n\\nShrimp wrapped in bacon. Good, but basically just shrimp wrapped in bacon. Not spectacular. \\n\\nChorizo in puff pastry. The guava sauce really made this dish. Get extra even. Pretty good but I'm not a huge meat eater so it kind of just tasted like a hot dog. Still very filling though. \\n\\nTuna on a plantain. Super good and the wasabi aioli was an excellent compliment to the plantain. I thought the tuna tasted a little smokey and though it could have tasted more fresh/raw but it was the second best thing besides the sliders. Really good. \\n\\nEnded with the tres leches cake for me and my friend got the coconut bread pudding. I never had tres leches and thought it was awesome! The meringue was aahhhmazing, it was like marshmallow fluff. That being said I think I would order my friends dessert next time.

It's very well known / renowned in Portland. \\n\\nWe came here on a Thursday afternoon for lunch, so we didn't see any of the log lines or crowds mentioned in other reviews. We sat inside which was a very good decision...since it must have been 90 outside. \\n\\nI can't speak for the authenticity of the food. Seems more like a Asian fusion that works very well. \\n\\nFor starters we ordered the Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce wings. Everybody seems to be raving about these...with good reason! Delicious! Tons of flavor, just the right mix of sweet, spicy & tangy. I'm a big fan...it would take a long while to get sick of these.\\n\\nI got the Muu Paa Kham Waan (Boar collar). SPICY! Tender meat with tons of flavor and spices. I'm sure it's probably not spicy enough for true spicy lovers, but it definitely gave me the spice sweats. The dish came with a side of mustard greens on ice to cool you down. BRILLIANT! Lets just say I used all the greens...\\n\\nMy buddy got Pok Pok special. Good healthy size dish. The game hen was delicious...just done perfectly! The dipping sauces had good flavor, not overpowering at all. The salad was nothing special, but definitely edible. \\n\\nThe biggest disappointment here was the sticky rice. Its hard and dry, like it was made in big batches and was sitting around for a while. I usually love sticky rice, one of my favorite things to eat while in Thailand. I would definitely pass on this one...\\n\\nFor dessert we ordered a Coconut Ice Cream Sandwich.

We enjoyed the food and drinks we had, and we'll definitely be back to try a whole meal.\\n\\nFirst off, I need to give a hearty commendation to any place that gives a happy hour discount on drinks featuring premium alcohol, such as the OYO vodka martini list that Luce offers.  Props to them for not just discounting swill.  That said, the drinks I had were hit or miss.  First round, I ordered a grapefruit martini, which according to the menu included grenadine and basil.  The grenadine was so strong in the drink I barely tasted any grapefruit, and there wasn't any basil in the drink.  Second round, I had a vanilla mojito made with OYO honey vanilla vodka, and was not disappointed.  The vanilla, though a light flavor in both the vodka itself and the drink overall, made a nice addition to the traditional mojito.  \\n\\nWe did decide to go for some food while we were there. Though we were at the bar and only ordered a couple of smaller things, we were also given a nice breadbasket with olive oil and a tomato spread.  That was a nice touch.   I ordered the \\"International Artisanal Cheese Plate\\".  The only complaint I have was that the cheeses weren't labeled, and I'm not enough of a cheesehead to know the difference sometimes, so I wasn't sure exactly which I was tasting.  But, the cheeses were great, and the plate came with some grapes, candied pecans, and a delish apricot cherry chutney.  It also came with two pieces of \\"house flatbread\\", that was very tasty, but so flat that it shattered in my hands and could not really be used as a vehicle for any of the cheeses.  My husband had a forest mushroom pizza.  Normally I have a fairly low tolerance for a proliferation of mushrooms, but the pizza was well-balanced, and had a nice shroomy flavor that wasn't too earthy.  \\n\\nThe rest of the menu looks amazing, and I do plan to go back to to try out more of the dinner dishes.  There are several restaurants in the Powell area that have unique, upscale dining, and it's nice to add Luce to the list."},{"name":"General Burnside's Canteen","address":"3239 SE Hawthorne Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"This is an off the charts kinda place.

The very casual (and cheap) decor and the vegetable market and lunch counter up front communicate a neighborhoody vibe for a casual meal, but the dinner menu is priced like a special night out.

That would be sufferable if the quality was excellent, but every side dish we ordered was bland and unmemorable, if well-cooked.

Definitely. They have a ton of vegan and healthy options, and even whole30 approved items. I've never ordered anything that I didn't like. Some standouts, for me, were the ancient grains bowl and the Curry (which might be seasonal). I do like that they have veggie dishes/starters/pizzas so if you want to go a more shareable, tapas route you can or they have entrees. \\n\\nHowever, like most restaurants of this type, it's a bit overpriced for what it is. I've never spent less than $30 there and that's usually sans alcohol with an entree and splitting an app. And while the food is delicious yes, it's not more delicious that other restaurants in the same vein (or my own cooking) and the portions can be a bit skimp depending on what you order. \\n\\nOne thing that really bugged me was when ordering the guacamole app- we requested no pita chips and instead just give us some veggies like carrots, etc. because I had a food allergy. The waiter said of course- nothing else. Well when we got the bill we were charged the full price of the appetizer, AND an extra $4 for the three carrot sticks and like three pieces of zucchini they gave us for the dip! It was rang in as a \\"side of crudite\\". Now if someone had told me i was going to have to pay $4 for literally 6 pieces of raw veggies i would have just said no thank you all together.

For those who prefer fresh lemon or cocktail sauce these come with the oysters as well. Nice variety of oysters, fresh - no complaints.  \\n\\nFor those oyster lovers (and to dispel complaints about price) - we had Island Creeks ($2/ea), Belon ($3), Moon Shoals ($2), Hog Islands ($3), Shigoku ($3), Dodge cove ($2.50). \\n\\nWe also selected 2 other items from the raw bar - halibut ceviche and razor clam ceviche.  Portions of these were small, but for quality of fish the price was reasonable (At Neptune portions of raw bar items are usually a bit larger, but the price is as well).\\n\\nWe ordered a crab cake appetizer which had a nice percentage of crab compared to cake.

We found ourselves looking at the menu for a solid 5 minutes just trying to figure out how the list was organized. Surprisingly, no chicken. I admit that I don't know if there's a code when it comes to Greek pizza toppings but I'm sure they have chickens in Greece, so we were perplexed that while shrimp made the cut on one of their specialty pizzas, chicken didn't. The Greek style crust it was pretty good. Our pie came out piping hot, I even burnt my lip a bit from the steaming hot tomato sauce. There was a lot of cheese given the crust and tended to overpower the toppings. A good thing if you're a cheese lover, I suppose!\\n\\nSangria:\\nWe also decided to try their Sangria by the glass and we were really disappointed. No fruit other than a wedge of lime *and* lemon which made it really sour, no pineapples for us. The wine was so diluted with spritzer and juice that it looked like pink lemonade juice. I'm not sure what the $6 they charged went towards; the juice? the lime & lemons? Maybe we're spoiled by La Bodega's awesome Sangria. Heck, even Anton's had better Sangria than this place.\\n\\nService:\\nThe service staff seemed really disorganized. When we arrived, we had one person ask us how many for our table, only to see that person usurped by another who then asked the exact same question. Our server came and asked us if we wanted to order drinks but then 5 minutes later another staff person ( the same who usurped and seated us) came by and asked us if we wanted order drinks. After we ordered and waited a solid 25 minutes for our pizza in a restaurant that was only half full, a third staff member brought us an order meant for another table that had been seated after us. We were never given any explanation that there had been a mixup, only that our order would be coming soon and we ended up waiting an additional 10 minutes for our order.\\n\\nAs far as the pizza goes, I've had better. I'll definitely go back one day to try their Greek food fare since that seems to be the most talked about. But for now, I'm standing by my rating of only 3 Stars.\\n\\nWebsite confusion:\\nIt's worth noting that a google search of \\"olympia pizza\\" brings up results for 3 different restaurants (olympiapizza.COM for the Denman restaurant / olympiapizza.NET for the Broadway restaurant / and olympiapizza.CA for the Surrey restaurant).

The other dishes we got including the laarb was just ok. I thought the portion size for all of the dishes were quite small. Between 4 of us, we each were able to have a small severing size of each dish. I definitely was still hungry when we finished.

Tonight was my first experience with KRS. And, to get the important part out of the way, I'd happily go back and spend the money to dine here again.\\n\\nBut that's not really what you want to know. You want to know what it was like. You want to know about the drool-inducing starters, the world-class salads and the meat that would make you slap your own mother for another taste. Ok. Let's talk about that, in order, with a minimum of fuss and self-indulgence.\\n\\nI mean, really. I just spent $50 on a 12 oz. chunk of barely cooked cow. I've burned my self-indulgence budget for 2011 already.\\n\\nSo. Our waiter, Rick, did a great job. I have no complaints about the service, except, perhaps, for the fussy way passing staff would \\"reset\\" your napkin if you wandered off to the toilet. Food was delivered smoothly, utensils were replaced stealthily, water was refilled without drama. All as it should be in that regard. \\n\\nOn to starters. At our table, we had the bacon, the bacon-pimento puffs, and, essentially, a tuna tartare. It's awfully hard to mess up sushi-grade tuna served raw, and KRS managed not to. Very good. I could pass on the bacon-pimento puffs, but I'm not strongly motivated by pimento cheese. People who like it would probably fight over the last one. As for the so-called bacon, phew, each piece is a slab of pork about an inch on a side and 4 or 5 inches long served in a pleasant barbecue-style sauce. It was very, very good, but I was actually hoping for something a bit more interesting. Still, I'd order it again.\\n\\nNow, salads. We didn't share salads, so I can only tell you about my bacon (seeing a theme here?) spinach salad. It was very tasty, a pleasant pause from the meat orgy. My only complaint, and we're well into \\"water is wet\\" territory here, is that the bacon part made it a bit too salty. \\n\\nSooooooo, the main event. The 12 oz. filet, rare. I could tell you about the excellent jalapeno creamed corn or the broccoli that should've been served without the cheese, but I'm guessing that you want to know about the cow chow. \\n\\nIt wasn't the best piece of meat I've ever eaten. I've had a filet with almost magical texture. It wasn't even the best prepared (I assume there's a seasoning of some sort, as the outside of the meat was very salty). But let's be honest: these are nits of a truly silly sort. This was a damn good piece of beef, extremely flavorful, wonderful texture, and entirely too quick to disappear. Was it worth $50? Well, a similar piece of meat would probably cost about $25 at Whole Foods, and I'd completely mess up the preparation. So, yes, if you're going to splurge on a very high quality piece of cow meat that somebody else takes the time to prepare well, this is an excellent way to do it. Why four stars and not five? Simply because I've had better food. But I will be going back, and I hope sooner rather than later.\\n\\nTotal damage for a bill split 3 ways was $85 per person, plus tip. That's with no wine and a handful of beers. Not, under the circumstances, an outrageous bill. \\n\\nPS. Just about the only truly bad part about the meal was standing under the awning waiting for the valet. The awning is really, really bad. \\"Aspirational\\" is a word I'd use, as it doesn't so much block rain as slow it down and concentrate it into larger drops.

We figured it was bc they were busy, but then noticed that a couple across from us who arrived 30 minutes after us already finished their appetizers! I call the waitress over to let her know and she tells us that the kitchen is really backed up. Then I see her talking to another waitress and punching stuff into the computer hurriedly. Obviously, she forgot to put in our order. We finally get our apps after 10 minutes (about the same time as the new couple that just sat down to share our table). But after another 20 minutes (& still no visit from our waitress) I decide to talk to the manager. Fortunately, she was very professional & nice and actually ended up comping our meal and was very apologetic.

At least a visit to Powell's makes it feel that way. Powell's is a huge and diverse bookstore that feels like Amazon's book section has come alive. If you feed it cookies it will reveal hidden passages behind bookshelves that lead to the layers of evil wizards with bad teeth and poor wi-fi reception. Unfortunately I always forget my cookies.\\n\\nThe store is broken up by different sections, each a color that is easy to spot, so even though it's huge, you're never lost or left wondering what section you're in. To wander is a joy. I always come across the weirdest books that no one has ever heard of or that leave me wondering how they every got printed. I love that they have lots of books in stock that are in different languages. Spanish Harry Potter made for a great present for a friend down in Guatemala. At the front they have shelves of their top sellers in fiction and nonfiction. Being a huge fan of nonfiction I always stop here on the way in to see what's new and popular.\\n\\nThe coffee shop is always crowded but they make good drinks and it's nice to lounge in there with laptop in hand or the new book you just got. The window looks out to Burnside and I enjoy just sitting there with a coffee and my music on, looking out at all the life hustling by. The Burnside entrance often has a street performer out there playing his songs. They sound good and the dude isn't pushy.\\n\\nWhat I really want to talk about is their incredible author series. Powell's basically acts as a university, hosting authors almost daily who have written about an endless amount of topics. I am signed up for their weekly email and from that pick out who would be cool to see that week. I often don't know the author but if their book sounds interesting I go. There's plenty of regional authors who pop up too. Typically an author will read then take questions from the audience, or do a conversation with a moderator and then answer questions. Afterward they'll sign your book. It's fascinating to hear their creative process or why they're drawn to certain topics. It usually lasts only an hour and so is a perfect little easy thing to add to your day. I have learned of so many incredibly books and seen so many awesome authors because of this. I've seen Chuck Palahniuk, Patton Oswalt, Greg Proops, Chris Hadfield the astronaut, and Chuck Klosterman just to name a few. Did I mention this is all free? What an incredible gift to the community. Powell's is a kickass place. Go get lost and find a goofy book! Take a pic of its cover and send it to friends. Then read that goofy book and be thankful you found it by browsing books in a real place!

My least favorite (only because something had to come in last place) was the banh mi...chopped pieces of pork belly with all the veggies on freshly grilled Texas toast...mmmmm!!!!!

Fairly common among many of the more popular eateries here, I've lived in Portland for 20 years and am more or less just used to it. I've always found it odd as I've worked in food service and didn't feel the need to put on airs when serving people, but hell, like I said I am used to it. \\n\\nOn the other hand, almost all the actual customers are people who aren't from Portland and came here because someone told them this is some kind of local foodie bastion. So it's interesting to see people expecting the level of service you would get in almost any other city confronted with the reality of the state of the service industry here. I do enjoy going just to be a fly on the wall and more than once I have heard someone loudly announce \\"Now I can say I am a Portlander, I've had Pok Pok!\\" \\n\\nHm. Yea. Well. Ok.\\n\\nAs for the food - I've been 4 or 5 times now and have had a variety of dishes and drinks and have had the same experience each time. It's good, it's no where near great. The drinks are weak and expensive and it's a nightmare to get the bartenders to be anything but flat out rude. The noodle dishes are generally over seasoned, but not greasy. Meats are often tasty but always tough. Soups are bland but hot. So, very mediocre. I've never had bad food here, but I've never had exceptional food. \\n\\nI'd say if you are new to Portland, and feel like experiencing our unique brand of snarky, too hip to be real service, this is a good primer.

It's a deli downtown that's churning out old school classics like pastrami better than everyone else in town. \\n\\nI was on a mission to try the chipotle pastrami sandwich I had seen on the show. I'm a pastrami lover, so any twist on it gets me excited. They served the sandwich on toasted bread, which in my opinion made all the difference. It gave the sandwich a crunch factor and made it hold together better than a non toasted sandwich would. The chipotle pastrami was outstanding. It was a little sweet, a little smoky and mondo flavorful. It definitely lived up to the hype. The creamy and crunch cole slaw mellowed a little bit of the spice from the pastrami as well which was great. \\n\\nMy fianc√© went with the pastrami and corned beef combo, but hers was served traditional deli style on untoasted bread slices. Her sandwich was good, but it definitely didn't hold together well as she was eating it. The flavor of the meats was fantastic though.\\n\\nSam lagrassa's is worth a visit. It's a small little place, but you can definitely get a table rather quickly, or take your sandwiches to go.

I mean my housemates and I drove all the way to portland from California to eat around. I was literally jumping up and down to try this place. I mean it was all over the foodnetwork and it is one of the most yelped restaurant in Portland. First of off it was an hour wait and the front desk host girl was so rude to my housemate. She gave my friend attitude just for asking a question and she had the most smug face. That started off the vibe wrong because I wondering where is her customer service etiquettes. \\n\\nI was so excited try their signature wings. I was so disappointed... Not only with the wings but their som tum (papaya salad) and my friend's clear thin rice noodle dish. \\n\\nThe wings were not crispy and super salty. This is coming from a person who grew up eating nuoc mam (fish sauce) sometimes 3x a day at home. The wings looked burnt. The price is what made me mad, $15 for 6 whole wings that assaulted my tongue with salt.\\n\\nI thought their thai style som tum look promising but sadly my papaya salad was not refreshing and the papaya seemed to be more on the ripened side. Som tum is suppose to be crispy, slightly sweet & acidic. I found myself dipping the papaya back and forth to retrieve the lack of sauce at the bottom of the plate. I've had way better som tum elsewhere. \\n\\nNow this last dish. My housemate wanted her own dish so she ordered a clay pot of glass noodles with shrimp and pork belly also cooked in the clay pot I'm assuming. The flavor of the clay pot was ok, nothing special tasted like a little soy, sugar, and maybe oyster sauce. The shrimp was cooked well but the price was crazy. The one dish cost $17. Even though it was big... It's glass noodles with shrimp and some pork belly. I could have made that home. \\n\\nOverall if you live in Portland it's probably a cool place to go to once in a while if you crave thai fusion dishes but if you want authentic thai, laos, Vietnamese dishes go to California."},{"name":"Pon Thai Bistro","address":"213 Washington St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"Chef Pon is amazing!

The restaurant is very mom-and-pop-like, with about five tables, a small open-kitchen (you get to see the chef cook, which always amuses me!), one chef, one waiter, little to no decor -- a restaurant with the bare minimum but surely blows you away its delicious, solid food. \\n\\nThe most interesting thing about this place is that the chef is Asian. It's pretty mind-boggling that an Asian guy can make such authentic Italian food. We ordered three entrees: \\n \\n- Aglio Olio black pasta - this is their signature dish and a must-try; the al dente squid ink pasta, aroma of garlic, and the ground squid all blended flawlessly. We liked it so much that we were tempted to order seconds. \\n- Putanesca black pasta - a vegetarian black pasta. Not quite as tasty as the aglio olio, but still pretty good  \\n- Lobster Fra Diavolo - it came with generous portions of clams, mussels, shrimp, and a giant lobster mixed with pasta \\n\\nHuge portions here so don't over-order. We split three entrees among five people and we were all stuffed. We ordered a syrah to go with our food and that was the finishing touch to a perfect meal. \\n\\nThe food was served on the sizzling pan that the chef cooked the entree with and fresh off the stove.

There's a nice modern spin on some things while others stay very true to classic, quality BBQ. \\n\\nAppetizers: go for the fried green tomatoes. They do a really delicious spin on a classic. The chow chow is a nice southern touch. The tempura ribs were delicious as well (surprisingly) and didn't seem \\"over the top\\" at all. The fried pickles were good, but nothing special.\\n\\nMeat: I tried brisket and pulled pork. The brisket is the best I've found in the city so far. Seriously, it was essentially perfect on every level. The pork was almost buttery in texture. Tender but didn't hold up all that well. It was a little salty if anything, but the variety of sauces definitely helped out. Go for the brisket! \\n\\nSides: The coleslaw was a pretty classic vinegary (not creamy) type. Didn't stand out but cut through with some nice acidity. I also got the mac n' cheese which was delicious. The pasta was cooked perfectly, the sauce was creamy - not runny but not totally thick - and it had a little bit of bite. The cornbread was good, but didn't taste much like jalapeno or bacon at all as its name would've suggested. \\n\\nDessert: The seasonal cobbler was flawless. The ice cream sandwich left a bit to be desired. The mint chocolate chip ice cream in the middle was incredible, it nearly tasted homemade, but the cookies were almost impossible to break. Didn't function as much of a sandwich, but tasty nonetheless.\\n\\nThe atmosphere was super welcoming and really paid homage to the southern bbq culture, which I liked.

Both were excellent. Wonderful seafood, nice tender pasta, and realy great sauces. I especially liked the pasta with ground clams, even if it was a tiny bit oily for my preference. \\n\\nThroughout the meal, the service was friendly as the night started to settle down for our poor waitress.

Steve was great! He was eager to enhance our ordering experience by explaining what's on the menu, including the featured fish for the day, which was Moana Ahi Tuna in this salty and spicy dry rub. What made everything better was that he would allow us a free taste for each salmon and tuna that he was explaining. They were out of scallop that day but he joked that it gave us a reason to return (no doubt about that!). Everyone in the bar were actually very helpful, approachable, and easygoing - they also had a wicked fun sense of humour! After paying, my friend and I dug into our pok√© bowls and it was so delicious I did not regret ordering the large bown (comes with two scoops of pok√©). The rice, fish, and fruits that were in my bowl tasted fresh despite the fact that we arrived there near closing time. \\n\\nI definitely recommend this place!

Thank me later."},{"name":"Sweet Kingdom","address":"423 Main St","city":"Malden","stars":"3.5","text":"The short version: Cute and inexpensive place, but the kitchen was so very slow, and the food thus cold, that I may never go back.\\n\\nThe full version: I've lived in Malden Square for over a decade and I'm happy to be seeing lots of new shops and eateries opening. It's great for the neighborhood. This was my first visit to Sweet Kingdom, which opened 2 months ago. I had been looking forward to checking it out.\\n\\nThe decor is great. It is a small space with high ceilings and a look that emphasizes natural elements--woodgrain, stone, rustic metal--in an eclectic and clean way. There is free WiFi. The music playing was not my cup of tea--Rihanna and Eminem's dysfunctional duet followed by bland Chinese pop etc--but it was not overly loud.\\n\\nI decided to order take-out. There were 4 or 5 other parties already seated--mostly teenagers with bubble tea. It was mid-afternoon and not looking too busy. I waited about 5 minutes for the hostess/cashier to deal with another customer. While waiting, I looked over the menu, which was printed on a large-sized postcard in very small English and Chinese text. It was not simple to read but that's not a deal breaker for me. They mostly have various drinks, savory small plates, and waffles and pancakes. While I was ordering, another customer came up to the counter and interrupted me to complain to the hostess that she had made a mistake with their order. It seemed to me there were probably not enough employees to cover the shift.\\n\\nI ordered an iced Thai milk tea, octopus balls, coconut shrimp, mini hot dogs, mini crab cakes, scallops in bacon, and a mochi waffle. The savory dishes were all small appetizer-style items and all items were inexpensive--about $4 each. So this was not actually a lot of food. Then I waited...and waited and waited and waited. Other customers came in, were seated, ordered, got their food--both savory dishes and desserts--and still I waited.\\n\\nAfter 30 minutes (really), my iced tea and one of my hot dishes came out and the hostess began to prepare a bag for my order. I was not offered the iced tea so it warmed and melted before I could drink it. After 45 minutes, I approached the hostess and asked her how much longer it would be. She was apologetic and said it would be ready immediately. But it wasn't. I was very late getting home by then, so I left and went home while my BF waited for our food. Ten minutes later--55 minutes after I had ordered--our order was finally ready. That's just not acceptable. It cannot take a restaurant one hour to prepare an iced tea, one waffle, and some small bites.\\n\\nWe live right around the corner, so we were eating our food within 5 minutes of getting it but most of it was already room temperature. As far as I can tell, the kitchen had only been able to work on one or two items at a time, so nothing had come out together and most of the food was cold. The crab cakes were still slightly warm. I suspect all of the food would have been better hot. The crab cakes had an acceptable amount of meat in them and weren't just breading. The scallops and bacon weren't very good at room temperature and the scallops were tiny and dry. The bacon was okay. The coconut shrimp was pretty tasty even at room temperature. My daughter liked the mini hot dogs (pigs in blankets, really). The octopus balls were disappointing. The breading/batter was undercooked so they were kind of just a cold, doughy blob. They were cute on the outside, though. Judging from the big box of Bisquick I could see through the cashier's pass-through to the kitchen, I don't think the waffle was in any way \\"healthy\\" or \\"natural\\" as advertised (and I really wonder whether any of the items I ordered didn't come from a frozen, pre-made box), however, the waffle was properly cooked and probably would have been quite yummy had it been hot. Unfortunately, it had sat so long with whipped cream on it that by the time we got it, the whipped cream had \\"broken\\" and the waffle squares were all full of watery \\"cream puddles\\". The mochi on the waffle was not something I would get again. It seemed dry and flavorless. I have never had mochi in a Chinese eatery so I will withhold some judgment on that and just say that this was *not* Japanese mochi in any way. The Thai milk tea wasn't icy by the time I drank it but it was sweet, creamy, and tasty.\\n\\nAll in all, the prices at Sweet Kingdom are so inexpensive that I would not have expected amazing dishes, and I would have been happy simply to eat the dishes hot. The place itself is also quite nice looking. But to wait an hour for a small amount of food, and to receive zero of seven items at the proper temperature, after waiting so long, just isn't worth it. I hate to give mediocre reviews. I hope that Sweet Kingdom will improve its kitchen process because it's other wise a nice addition to the neighborhood."},{"name":"Torchys Tacos","address":"4301 W William Cannon Dr, Ste G-400","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"The only thing worthwhile at this place is the chili con queso.

However the presentations of the food  is 5/5 stars. My family ordered one of the sushi specials, and when we got it, we only got 2 PIECES! The seafood soup did not look like the picture on the menu. On the menu, it shows a bowl of soup with a variety vegetables and seafood on it. When they served us the soup, all we got was a teapot and a teacup with a slice lime in it. The color of the soup was pretty, and it tasted good. But the amount was not enough, the lime was bigger than the cup. I do not recommend the cold tofu. It was bland and lacked in flavor. However I do recommend their ramen, even though it's pretty expensive. The sushi is good. One of the ladies gave me a origami flower, which was very thoughtful. The dessert was also free. My family got green tea mochi, which I did enjoy. However they each gave us half a mochi. While I was eating the mochi. While eating my desert I saw fingerprints on my plate, which was probably from the flour of the mochi. They do keep the place very clean, the tables don't have the sticky residue.

There were seats available but the hostess said something about not being able to \\"overload\\" the servers.  OK...I get that.  Staff for a weekend when you know you are going to be busy?

I finally asked my husband to go see if they knew we were up there, yes, they did and finally our waitress came to take our order.  She was very nice, and had to go up a large bunch of stairs to get to us, I thought that would be interesting when their arms are full of dishes, and it was.

Unfortunately I heard after that the wings are great and are the only thing worth trying. I got 3 dishes. The portions are minuscule and wildly over-priced. But it changed my friends life so who cares about value? First I had the boar collar.. It wasn't bad. It wasn't good. It was a waste of exotic game meat. Could have been chicken, beef, tofu.. It just tasted like the sauce it was drowned in and is very similar to the average steak you would get at a typical Thai resturant. The only difference was this was overly salted and had more than enough garlic.. This was the best part of the meal. Next was the albacore tuna which was awful. It was a plate with basic vinegary chili sauce, some shredded carrots and topped with chicken of the sea canned tuna. It had the worst presentation and an even worse taste. It was terrible. I also believe it was like $17! Lastly I tried the papaya salad and hen otherwise known as the pokpok special. This also wasn't terrible but it was far from good or special. 3 small pieces of white meat that didn't have any amazing spice or flavor to it that were so wonderful. Every bite contained a bone and or ligament.. It was accompanied by 2 sorry pieces of cabbage, and a very basic papaya salad with tiny dried shrimp which I don't care for but some people do and peanuts.. Again this can be ordered at any Thai resturant and it usually much better... I didn't try any deserts and wish I had tried the wings and the duck.

Some recommendations: from 2-4pm on Monday through Thursday, students (with ID) get half off (most) food.  11pm-1am is similar half price (though for everyone), and 4-7pm (I think) is happy hour for cheap drinks.\\n\\nOn the food side they've got a huge variety - good dips and salsas make the \\"pickadippa\\" (3 salsas or dips and endless chips for $6) a great choice.  For the vegan types among us, they will substitute non-dairy sour cream or cheese for no charge, which is almost unheard of even at most vegetarian-friendly restaurants.\\n\\nSo on the whole, I like Mad Mex.  But two caveats: 1) the food is, in fact, spicier than average.

The pork belly dish was great, they did a fantastic job on it where the pork belly was tender and wasn't too fatty.  The place is popular and place seems to be small, but they did a great job at trying to make room for tables the best they did.

My server was fabulous-polite, attentive and knowledgeable. He was new and made the Konichiwa Kitten cocktail for me-his very first time- and it was strong and smooth. I had the $15 special, with the Tokyo ramen and seaweed salad. I don't drink beer so the server was nice enough to let me choose a cocktail in it's place and pay the difference. The $15 special was listed as a beer and a 4 piece California roll OR ramen with a small salad-kind of pricey for what it is. I would have been really happy if it included the ramen and the 4 piece roll. 4 pieces alone doesn't seem like enough to make anyone full. We came for happy hour and on my budget that would be the only time I would come to this place. I agree with some previous reviewers that their prices are high for happy hour. Some of the rolls are $10-12, which are full prices at places of a similar caliber outside of downtown, but all of the food was incredibly fresh. I do wish they had more rice based options and highlighted gluten free dishes on their menu (*pollock fish, soy sauce and ramen noodles are made with gluten). The broth however was made from scratch and not watered down at all, and the pork was tender enough to melt in my mouth. My companion ordered the spinach salad with his special and it was good as well. It was served with a peanut sauce and had a different texture than the seaweed but it was refreshing to have a little variety."},{"name":"Piazza Italia","address":"1129 NW Johnson St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"This was by far my favorite meal during my recent trip to Portland. And honestly, even with the great Yelp rating, I wasn't expecting to have such a great experience. \\n\\nMy friend and I walked in and were surprised by the cozy atmosphere. I was thinking it was going to be some sort of romantic spot, but the authentic Italian atmosphere was full of soccer paraphernalia in a casual pub style. It was perfect for a laid-back lunch. \\n\\nLet's talk about the food because it was heavenly...and not in some fancy, uptight kind of way. Upon sitting down, our server brought us a basket of bread and some olive oil with vinegar. Seriously, the best bread I have ever had. I know that sounds ridiculous, but it was soft and chewy and perfectly baked. Delicious! For my meal, I decided on the mozzarella and tomato panini. Such a simple choice for a meal. I wondered if I should order some of their elegant Italian pasta instead. But I stuck with my guns and ordered the panini. And oh my god, was I happy with my decision! Best. Sandwich. Ever. \\n\\nTo be honest, I am not sure what was so amazing about my sandwich. But it was so damn good that I am devoting an entire paragraph to it. The mozzarella and tomato panini is a basic idea. Pretty straight forward actually. They started with some Italian bread - obviously freshly baked. Threw on some of the sweetest, most flavorful tomatoes that I have ever had...and I don't even like tomatoes that much. Add some fresh, moist mozzarella and some seasoning and you're all set. Let me reiterate myself....BEST. SANDWICH. EVER. The fact that I ate half of it right then and there and was then able to eat the leftovers for dinner made it even better. I am craving it right now! \\n\\nI really loved this restaurant. So much so that I just checked to see how much flights to Portland cost. I am ready to go back!

We tried a bit of everything, and there wasn't a single standout dish.  Summary:\\n\\nApps:\\n1. Oysters: all were super fresh, but I only enjoyed 2 of 8.  this is probably a case of just my preference for sweet, West Coast oysters, rather than the brininess of the East Coast\\n 2. Stuffed clams: just ok, I've had much better.  the breading was tasty, but the clams were TINY and completely got lost in the stuffing\\n3. Mussels: we had the saffron-base, and maybe it's because there wasn't any wine or acid, but it was just extremely heavy.  we had it cleared without even finishing half\\n4. Smoked sturgeon: i was really looking forward to this because i've never had anything like this, but was very disappointed.  it had the consistency of pork, but the fish itself was tasteless - no salt, no distinct fish taste, etc.\\n\\nEntrees:\\n1. Lobster: way overcooked and dry, and particularly disappointing after the lobster that I just had at La Mar Cebicheria in NYC, but that's to be expected considering that was by far the best lobster i've ever had\\n2. Salmon: perfectly cooked, but totally blah.  there was absolutely nothing distinctive about the preparation\\n3. Scallops: probably the best thing that we had overall.  portion size was perfect, and i liked the mushrooms\\n4. Lobster roll: the bread was great, but the lobster stuffing was really boring.  however, there was a TON of lobster.  and the chips and cole slaw were both good\\n\\nDesserts were the most disappointing part of the meal.  i'll eat anything sweet, but there was absolutely nothing here that i would order again.  we left all of them half unfinished.\\n1. Apple cider doughnuts: way overfried, to the point where i was really surprised they sent them out\\n2. Grape crisp: their version of pbj, and the best dessert overrall.  but then again, how can u go wrong with pbj?\\n3. panna cotta: very light and tasty - if i had to order something again, it would be this one\\n4. pear tart:  just not very good at all.  the pears were already tart, and then they added a tart raspberry sorbet, so overall, the dessert just lacked the sweetness that it needed to balance the pears and sorbet\\n5. coconut chocolate cream pie: decent.  i thought the pie crust was dry and crumbly, but the filling was good.\\n\\noverall, just not a great food experience.  maybe i ordered the wrong things?  but based on this experience, i won't be back.  \\n\\n3 stars for the beautiful space, cool ambience, and really great service."},{"name":"The Mark","address":"9900 SW Canyon Rd","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"The staff is nice - we went into the bar looking for the deck we'd heard about...

Not really appetizing at all and we were literally given a golf-ball size portion for $3. \\n\\nJust a note, the water tasted funky. I kept drinking hints of coconut - but I'm not sure if that was done on purpose or what?\\n\\nOverall, everything was well seasoned, but a little too salty for my taste. Lastly, I don't think the quality, taste, or portions of the food justify the high cost for each plate."},{"name":"The Mark","address":"9900 SW Canyon Rd","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Can I say The Mark is a solid 4 star review?  Oh yah I can....\\n\\nSo I was looking for extra work and stumbled across The Mark.  While I was here I thought I would take a quick glance at the Menu.  \\n\\nKobe beef burger, dungeoness crab florentine dip, warm bacon spinach salad, spicy wings, hmmmm....this had my attention....\\n\\nBUT REALLY....how good can the food be at a restaurant that's attached to a Shilo Inn? What...more typical SYSCO fare?  I will get to that.....\\n\\nThe place is divided up into 3 sections, when you enter you have The Mark to the right, a bar to the left, and a Cigar Bar upstairs.  Say what!?!?  A cigar bar???  Yes, you can smoke a stogey and drink to your hearts content AND eat food in this place.  Although Oregon banned smoking in bars/restaurants, Shilo grandfathered the law.  Pretty wild right?  It also has about 6 big screen TV's on the wall, pretty cool look to it.\\n\\nThe bar down stairs is smoke free, has a pool table, video poker machines, a few flat screens, and a wide selection of booze.  Drinks are stiff and the bartender is way cool.  They do have a happy hour, I just cant recall what the hours were.\\n\\nON TO THE FOOD......on a few different visits I have found the food here is surprisingly really good!\\n\\nCrab florentine dip- crab, florentine, spinach, artichoke hearts, onion, parmasean cheese, roasted bell peppers, and some crostini for dipping.  This app was creamy and tasted really good. 5 star dish\\n\\nLobster Bisque- When reading reviews in Vegas, Texas De Brazil's lobster bisque was supposed to knock your socks off, while I found it average, The Marks lobster bisque was OUTSTANDING.  This actually hand chunks of lobster in it, 4 or 5 lil pieces at the bottom.  I believe it's made with a brandy which gives it a distinct taste, and i'm already hooked on it. 5 star dish\\n\\nWarm Bacon Spinach Salad-  I decided to get wild and try something I never usually would.  THIS WAS AWESOME!!  It's a salad that has a hazel nut encrusted goat cheese crouton on top.  The salad also contained red onion, bacon, bacon vinegarette, spinach, and dried cranberrys.  This had my palate doing a dance.  Initially you get the bacon/vinegarette taste, but then the goat cheese kicks in, while you taste the goat cheese and you work through the \\"earthy\\" taste it has, BOOM a cranberry pops in there and that sweet taste cuts right through the cheese completely cleansing the palate leaving you ready for more. 5 star dish\\n\\nHot wings- You get about 4-5  large drumettes in a order.  It's prepaired in a confit of duck then fried, they toss it in a wing sauce that has a hint of carrot so at first it's sweeter and as you chew, the heat turns on at end.  It's a simple dish, but the chicken literally falls of the bone, and I really liked the sweet/spicy taste.  Something you wont find at a Buffalo Wild Wings or other similar places.  Basic, but good. 4 star dish\\n\\nKOBE BEEF BURGER- HELL YEAH BABY!  A Burger that has stole my heart.  I ordered this thinking that the discription left something to be desired, yet I had never tried a \\"kobe beef burger\\" and why the hell not give it a shot?  This was a large hand pressed patty that was topped with Tillamook cheddar, carmelized onions, lettuce, tomatoe, some type of sauce and OH MY GOODNESS was this awesome.  The sweetness of the onions somewhat spread through the burger and i'm not kidding, this was killer.  5 star dish\\n\\nGorgonzola Potato Bites- I love potatoes, I love Gorgonzola...WOW!! Way better than I imagined it would be.  They serve up slices of baked potatoes that are then fried, creating a nice *crisp* outside texture, while maintaining the soft baked inside.  Topped with a gorgonzola sauce and crumbles this was fabulous.  I will be ordering this 1st thing when I go back. 5 star dish\\n\\nThere's more to the menu that I want to try, but for now, I'm very happy with this hidden gem.  Food is prepaired when you order, NOT SYSCO food.  Service is kind, attentive, and they seem to actually care that things are prepaired well and done the right way.  I really do suggest giving this place a try."},{"name":"Ceviche Tapas Bar & Restaurant","address":"125 W Church St","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Excellent, a must go when visiting Orlando!.

He had only positive reviews on their own dinner experience and how nice the restaurant was. I walked past Hotel Commonwealth and entered Island Creek Oyster Bar.\\n\\nImmediately, I noticed the spacious room, lighting, oyster bar and overall design. While we were waiting, asked the friendly hostess how long ICOB has been in this location and she said its their one year birthday as well, opening in October 2010. The decor and serenity of the room, wood, oyster shells against the walls is very unique and cool. \\n\\nThe oyster bar is very sleek and ice and oysters were well displayed. I would love to come back and try out the dinner menu or have a cocktail with friends and I mentioned this to the General Manager Tom on my way to the ladies room.\\n\\nThe service was warm and impeccable. Our servers and the kitchen was seamless and the staff executed really well for a group of 39 other brunch attendees and a full restaurant.\\n\\nThen two baskets of pastries came to are table filled with a blueberry muffin, doughnut muffin, cinnamon roll, croissant, raspberry crumb cake and scone. All the baked goods looked tempting, but our servers highly recommended the doughnut muffin and raspberry crumb cake.\\n\\nGiven how much I adore doughnuts and muffins, the hybrid combination of the was a fantasy fulfilled. The doughnut muffin was tender, lightly sweet and I craved the other half. I think will try to recreate this novel idea myself.\\n\\nI also tried ICOB's cinnamon roll, which had a hardened glaze over the lightly cinnamon flavored pastry. Although it was good, it was a bit too dry for my liking.\\n\\nThe cocktail I tried was a Red Beer (ICOB Pilsner topped with housemade sangrita). I liked the bite and bitterness of the  pilsner and it really reminded me of autumn. I have had beer and champagne before at Mistral and loved it, but I have not tried wine and beer together. The combination requires a sophisticated palate and a few of us who ordered it thought it was very tasty, but a bit too heavy to drink the whole beverage.\\n\\nI had Ethel's lobster roll on a rosemary roll with homemade kettle chips and cole slaw. The lobster roll was stuffed with full lobster claws and meat and the hint of rosemary on the buttered roll really made the sandwich unique. I enjoyed the crunch of the kettle chips, which could have been a little tad bit saltier and the coleslaw was really creamy and refreshing. Going forward, any visitors I host in Boston will be directed to the ICOB lobster roll and restaurant for a thoughtful representation of New England seafood.\\n\\nWhat I found quite humorous was the amount of strategy involved to elegantly consume the lobster roll. What was the best methodology? Amongst just grabbing the entire roll, Divide the lobster roll in half and carefully enjoy."},{"name":"Island Creek Oyster Bar","address":"500 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Delicious food!

We were standing by their sides so that she could obviously see other walked-in guests are waiting to be seated.

The food is good. The cooks and staff are always friendly. I haven't tried the sushi yet although I'm not a big sushi person. Also if you don't have a third degree Black belt in Japanese food know-it-ology then you should be okay.  The average patron at this place isn't concerned about authenticity....I know I'm not. If I want authentic Japanese food ill go to Japan.  The American version is good enough for me.\\n\\nThat being said I ordered some sake with my food.  The small bottle was about $7 and the large was $12.  I tried it cold but I prefer warm sake. The soup that comes with the meal is no bueno. It tasted watered down. However you can substitute another soup which my date did.  The salad is nasty. They need to stop serving that mess. So why give them four stars?  The food off the grill was great. Like I said I've been here few times and the taste has been consistent. Of course one of the biggest draws to this place is the cooking experience and if you're one of those people that like to interact they'll even throw food in your mouth.

It was pretty good but so small.. Some of them had heavy taste of cilantro but some of them didn't. \\n\\nChicken took an hour but we knew that before we placed the order so it was fine. The chicken tasted good and it was roasted very deliciously but it was WAY TOO SALTY. Sometimes when I chew I could feel chunks of salt in my mouth..

Neither of us could finish our plate because we felt like our tongues were going numb. \\n\\nWhen our server came to check on us, we told him that the chicken was too salty. He asked if we wanted to order something else instead but we said we were fine since we already waited too long for it. Later, the manager came to apologize. Since we didn't want to order something else, he offered us complementary desserts along with his apology, which was very nice.

I understand that flavorful and creative food does not always come cheap but this menu was not describing any ingredients that couldn't just as easily be found at Sunny's. The Brisket was recommended to us so two of us ordered that. Mine was almost entirely covered in Fat and when I was finished trimming all of that off it was probably 2 ounces of meat. Even at two ounces I didn't bother eating it all because it was so bland. The green beans had no seasoning or any attempt at flavor. Our other friend got the Pork Chop with the Mac and Cheese, which judging by what was left on his plate (all of the Mac and Cheese) wasn't very good.

This allowed me to try a couple of their cocktails and their pig sty nachos. The nachos were so delicious and filling we ended up taking our BBQ plates home. I also had their fried green tomatoes and deviled eggs. The fried green tomatoes were soooo good. The deviled eggs were good too but they only give you three in an order and that's a little pet peeve of mine. \\n\\nSo while Smoke Ring has  good food and drink they're still a new place with new place kinks to be worked out. Like, their table situation. I went for dinner with my husband on a Saturday and all these small parties were at tables meant for 6 people... Because that's all they have. Why aren't there smaller tables? We ended up getting impatient and left. We may have been more inclined to stay and listen to the duo playing nice music but there was a Chive gathering and they were rowdy. Which is another thing. Is this a place for people to get really drunk and rowdy? I mean people drinking and having a good time is one thing but some of the people were a little over the top, especially for 9pm. It made waiting at the bar a little awkward. So we left. Hopefully that's not a typical Saturday night crowd because I'd love to come back for a date night.\\n\\nWe'll definitely try going again, I did like the food and drink plus the atmosphere is pretty cool.

Probably some of the best oysters I've had in Boston so far. Another great dish that can't be missed is the Oyster Sliders. The oysters are freshly fried and coupled with a sweet bun that nicely contrasts the saltiness of the fried oysters.  The menu changes occasionally, with new specials added frequently and some changes to the standard menu itself.  Personally I'm not a huge fan of their lobster roll. I find it to be bland and not something to write home about.  Some of their other dishes (pasta) can be too salty and overpowering. \\n\\nAdditionally the service is touch and go. Sometimes it's fantastic, other times the wait times (to order, receive drinks/check) can be a bit delayed. \\n\\nOverall, I really enjoy this restaurant and when I have friends in town this is one of the main restaurants that I bring them to.

The food is really good for a quick takeout/delivery night. Their General Tso's chicken was too sweet for me even after asking for extra spicy, but it is Americanized Chinese, so can't complain too much. That's the only thing I didn't like. Their Hunan chicken is amazing if you like saucy dishes to eat with rice. I feel like their fried rice is so good it can be an entree in itself if you get it as your side. The hot and sour soup is delicious and a good portion especially for the price. Their Lo Mein is made perfectly with just the right amount of sauce. The orange chicken has the right amount of spice and actually tastes like orange. The sweet and sour chicken is good too - different than everywhere else I've had it.

He was a youngish guy and his service poor. It was clear that he wanted to do anything but tend to grilling. He BBQ-ed the meat, but he was slow to change the grilling pad, and the meat began to char. Can we say cancer?

The three filled us up, no problem. \\n\\nI don't usually order garlic bulbs, but these were really good. You kinda have to get down and dirty to get all the garlic out though.

Nori Nori in Sandy Springs is a VERY different kind of sushi restaurant. It's........now don't stop reading after you hear this.....a buffet restaurant!\\n\\nNo kidding and pretty damn good. Granted, when one thinks buffet, one thinks Junior Samples at Ryan's Steakhouse. But Nori Nori is not to miss and light years from what most of us think about buffet fare.\\n\\nThe place is huge and the options are many from sushi to Asian hot foods. I go for the sushi and I go to.....gorge.\\n\\nThe best deal is lunch. It's $14 for all you can eat. The dinner fare does not seem to change in any way that I can identify.... other than by price. Dinner is $27/person- double the lunch price with the same food options.\\n\\nSo, my advice? Go for lunch and then plan to nap afterwards!\\n\\nMy favorite at Nori Nori is the nigiri. Rolls are a plenty, but I find some of them to be so complex that they do not offer complimentary flavors. I'd pass on most of the rolls. But if you really like sushi, that won't deter you. The nigiri is some of the best I've every tasted. The salmon is like butter. Soup is great as are the myriad salads and hot foods.\\n\\nThe desserts are very pretty, but look better on my plate than in my stomach. But then, who would go to an all you eat sushi place to eat dessert? If you want dessert, I suggest that you did not eat enough sushi and to sample a few more. Skip the dessert. I think its  just there for the kids and those trying to develop diabetes and hypercholesterolemia.\\n\\nBottom line, I think that once you try Nori Nori, you'll think it's THE sushi deal of the city and will only eat sushi at another place when you want to burn bucks and impress your date with the hole you've made in your wallet.\\n\\nAnd remember, if you take a bite and don't like the item, trash it, because it's buffet and you need not waste one inch of gastrointestinal  space on food that does not thrill you.\\n\\nI give it a  big thumbs up!"},{"name":"Pon Thai Bistro","address":"213 Washington St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"We had a terrific dinner at Pon Thai Bistro tonight.

Pok Pok is the rare restaurant where I've tasted and enjoyed nearly everything on the menu. Each time I go, I can't decide until the last minute exactly what I'll be eating that day. And when I finish, I can't wait to go back and get something different. I go to Pok Pok a lot-- certainly more than any other restaurant. The only thing keeping me from going more often is the cost. And speaking of the cost...\\n\\nYes, Pok Pok is more expensive than most Thai restaurants, but I think the price is justified. You really can't compare this to your local hole-in-the-wall Thai restaurant that will serve you a massive mound of ketchup-soaked pad Thai for nine bucks. Pok Pok uses high-quality ingredients, many of them hard to find in the U.S. Technique and attention to detail are also very important in crafting these meals, and I think we're paying for more kitchen labor than you'd see in a typical American Thai restaurant.\\n\\nAnyway, on to the food itself. As I said, I like almost everything on the menu, but I do have some favorites:\\n\\nPapaya Pok Pok - This papaya salad might be my favorite thing they serve. Such an awesome, complex mix of flavors. It's pretty spicy, I guess, but I always wish it was spicier. I would ask them to toss in a couple extra chilies, but my usual dining companion would not enjoy that so much.\\n\\nIke's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings - This is what drew me to Pok Pok in the first place. They lived up to the hype for me. Salty as hell, but damn tasty and addicting. I always get the spicy version, though I do wish they were spicier.\\n\\nKhao Man Som Tam - This is a great plate because it comes with a few different items: a small papaya salad, coconut rice and sweet shredded pork. All very delicious, and one of the few items on the menu that is served with rice. \\n\\nKung Op Wun Sen - This is the dish with the prawns baked in a clay pot with pork belly and bean thread noodles. The flavor in this one is a little subtler than in many of the other dishes, but boy is it tasty when you really stir it up and scrape the caramelized spices from the side of the pot. Comes with a yummy, spicy cilantro sauce on the side too.\\n\\nKhao Soi - Curry soup made with coconut milk and yummy egg noodles. Served with roasted chili paste on the side so I can make my helping nice and spicy.\\n\\nKaeng Hang Leh - Very rich pork belly curry. This one looks small when you get it-- just a few chunks of pork in a shallow broth and hardly any veggies-- but it's rich and heavy, so we're always satisfied with the portion size. Need to get rice with it to soak up that broth. Yum.\\n\\nNeua Naam Tok - A medium-spicy flank steak salad seasoned with fish sauce and lime. This one's my girlfriend's favorite, and we get it pretty often. Good, complex flavor. Demands sticky rice.\\n\\nThere's a lot of other good stuff on the menu, but those are the faves. If you're going for the first time, I'd recommend getting the wings and Khao Man Som Tam.

If their service was only off once or twice, I'd give them a 3 or a 4, but their service is God awful. Absolutely DO NOT order a combo if you want to enjoy your fries. I ordered one and apparently it all comes in the same box, so the condensation from the hot chicken wets the fries leaving them soggy and floppy. I usually enjoy wings over, and will probably keep ordering and kicking myself for it, but I've had too many bad experiences in the past to suggest them to others. In the past I've had extremely late (1+ hours past ETA) deliveries (I get it - shit happens), but another time they were missing food - they promised they'd be back 'within 2 hours' with the missing sides (which seems like a long window to correct a messed up order), but then they no-showed!

For two diners way too know much food. Easily enough food for 4 diners. The beef didn't taste seasoned, it tasted more fleshy than I like. Also, the ginger in both entrees was poorly distributed and kind of burned my nostrils when I ate. Egg drop soup was good, very huge bowl for $5.50 with enough to for several small bowls.

We split the Berenjenas Fritas, which is thinly sliced, crispy fried eggplant with honey for dipping. Surprisingly tasty for such a simple recipe. I ordered the Chorizo y Pimientos, which is 5 types of chorizo, with tomatoes and peppers. I probably could've ordered a couple of those and been happy it was so tasty. While eating the tapas, we ordered the Paella Valenciana, which contained lobster (really just a lobster tail), scallops, shrimp, chicken and chorizo in rice. We skipped the squid due to my wife not liking it. The dish was full of flavor and the various meats added a lot of variety.

I've been there a few times and every one of them, I did the AYCE option for the KBBQ. It is a bit pricey ($29.99/person) but it's worth it in my opinion due to the meat options that they have. The variety ranges from LA galbi, boneless short rib, rib eye, beef bulgogi, pork bulgogi, chicken, pork belly, etc. I'm missing a few more if I remember correctly. You also get unlimited banchan and pork dumplings if you order this option. If you're a fan of dumplings, I highly suggest you get these because they are delicious and taste incredibly homemade and fresh. Also, don't forget to ask the waitress for the sauce for dumplings and use it as your dipping sauce. Trust me, you'll love it. The service was also great so no complaint there. The only reason I am not giving this place 5 stars is because of the somewhat high price. However, due to the lack of quality KBBQ in Florida in general, I think it's worth every penny when you do go."},{"name":"Hakata Ramen","address":"673 Hancock St","city":"Quincy","stars":"3.5","text":"Ramen is pretty good and broth had good flavors other then that the sushi is pretty basic as is all jap restaurants"},{"name":"Mo's Pizza","address":"3109 Briarcliff Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Mo's pizza is pretty good in my opinion but like the many reviews already here the service is very bad.

I asked for regular cheese but they sent extra so when I called to ask for replacement pizza I asked for regular cheese. When the new pizza arrived it had barely any cheese at all on it. It was primarily sauce. I hate bad service and I hate businesses that take less pride in the service they offer even more. I won't do business with them again and really thought about bringing the pizza back myself to discuss it with the manager but I realized that won't do any good.

The place is a little weird, as it looked like a two-story house converted into a restaurant. We were sat in the upstairs patio on a long booth style table under heat lamps. It was a tight fit as people sitting at the end had to get up and move out for people sitting inside to get out. There was no other way to move about - so once you're sat, you're there until the group is done eating. \\n\\nTheir suggestion is to do family style. We took their suggestion because for the prices listed, we assumed each dish would have enough servings for the six men that were sharing (the ladies just had to have their own dishes). We assumed wrong. Although the food was SOO good, there just wasn't enough for the prices paid for each dish. To be fair, it was a great way to sample all the foods Pok Pok had to order. From among the many dishes we ordered as a group, my favorites were Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce chicken wings and Muu Paa Kham Waan (Boar collar meat in garlic/coriander/pepper/soy & sugar glaze in spicy chili/lime/garlic sauce). \\n\\nTake a look at the pictures of the dishes and you can see why, while we were greatly satisfied with the food, we still left hungry.

I have been here twice for dinner and the food and drinks have been consistent, high quality, and delicious!!! Food is acquired from local farms/sellers and the executive chef is apparently a raw vegan outside of work so VEGANS and VEGETARIANS--you will always have delicious options here (even for dessert)!  AFB is definitely a place for food innovation and creativity.  I love places that encourage thinking outside of the box. I would never have thought turmeric would be a good added flavor for a dessert or a cheese platter made of cashews, spirulina, and other plant based ingredients (vegan-friendly). Even my non-vegan friends thought the vegan-friendly dishes were amazing!  They change their menu items seasonally and are willing to accommodate people with food allergies and dietary needs which is always a plus! Regarding the drinks...what can I say aside from tasty, full of flavor, and spunk...compliments to whoever has been making my drinks from the bar!  I haven't tried a drink that has been disappointing.  If it was, I would of say something.  Ambience is great.  Love the contemporary-farm to table themed decor. Reservations are highly recommended since its been busy every time I have come here though.  Staff- hostess and waiters/waitresses that waited our table have been great. Restaurant is good for any occasion, with a good group of friends, kids/family, celebrating a birthday or even business meetings.  I've seen it all.

The atmosphere is one of a modern speakeasy (if there is such a thing?) with jazz music, 1920s styled artwork and chandeliers.  The menu is a mix of seasonal creations that rotate every couple of months and standard classics that remain on the menu.  Never one to turn down an old fashioned, I consider Barlow's rendition among the best in town (it is served with a big cube and both lemon and orange peels) and definitely recommend it to others.  Another perk of Barlow is that you can order many of the starters and some of the smaller entrees from Picnic House as it is the same kitchen and ownership (again, the Brussels sprouts are amazing; the onion dip is another strong choice).  Alternatively, if you're looking for a before or after dinner drink, combining Barlow with Picnic House next door is a good way to do it.  Service is always very friendly and helpful.  My only criticism is that it can sometimes take a while to get your drink order (we have waited more than 10 minutes on several occasions) and this is why I wouldn't give 5 stars, but perhaps this speaks to the craft nature of the bar.

I also wish there were more toppings- the pie is mostly crust with a small sprinkling of cheese and other items, and seems to rely mostly on the finishing sauce in order to flavor the pizza.

They aren't meaty at all and lack the flavor that other Pok Pok dishes (and ribs in general) pack.\\n\\nI finally tried the spicy wings, and can tell you to choose those over the mild ones.  They aren't very spicy so it's just one more flavor that adds to the complexity / intensity of flavors.  Also, someone opted out of family style to order his own set of wings.  He said it was too much flavor for a single dish.  It's better to split these between people.\\n\\nI tried the Pok Pok hen and green papaya salad.  The papaya salad was kind of a waste of time.  I've had better ones at other places, and there was nothing going on in Pok Pok's that made me want to continue eating it.  It was whatever.  The roasted hen was good.  It had nice subtle flavors, but I'm biased towards wanting an intensity of flavors versus the subtle variety.

Once we were seated, we ordered:\\n\\n-Portland's Best Biscuits-n-Gravy (Slow Roasted Pork Loin Thinly Sliced, Nestled Between Two Sweet Potato Biscuits, Smothered in Rosemary Sausage Gravy, Served w/Library Fries, $10, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arleta-library-bakery-cafe-portland?select=4H2TL8A1LRXRL52ErBwHMA#4H2TL8A1LRXRL52ErBwHMA): Ok. The sweet potato biscuits were new to me and had a nice flavor, but the gravy was just ok. I also didn't like the pork loin in this dish and wish it were optional to add so that you don't get charged for it. The library fries were good, but there were only 3-4 pieces. I wouldn't order this dish again.\\n-Sicilian Hash (Their Signature Dish: Painted Hills Natural Beef Braised Overnight Then Sauteed w/Peppers, Onions, Potatoes, Topped w/Parmesan Scrambled Egg, Served w/Toast or Scone, $10, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arleta-library-bakery-cafe-portland?select=4H2TL8A1LRXRL52ErBwHMA#qdolLz7SBFtu1DE2G9aNIQ): We chose the scone, and that was pretty good, but a little too crumbly/dry for my preference. However, that was much better than the hash, which I didn't like at all. It was too salty, and I didn't think the flavors went well together. Skip!\\n-Buttermilk Semolina Griddlecakes (3 Ample Cakes Served w/Whipped Honey Butter, Organic Maple Syrup, Seasonl Fresh Fruit, $7, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arleta-library-bakery-cafe-portland?select=4H2TL8A1LRXRL52ErBwHMA#IJtPR-LitqTkA7K9H2M-nA): Nothing out of the ordinary, and the griddlecakes were a bit dry. Unfortunately, the butter and maple syrup couldn't save this dish since they were not very flavorful. Skip!\\n-Side of Thick Cut Bacon (3 slices/$3, http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/arleta-library-bakery-cafe-portland?select=4H2TL8A1LRXRL52ErBwHMA#vwpz63bwomYZZmN6Yl3RSg): Huge pieces of bacon, but 3 slices were a bit too much for us. However, recommended if you really like bacon or have a group.\\n\\nThe tables and chairs here aren't very comfortable, which I guess makes sense so that you don't linger. The service was ok- the staff is nice but not super friendly, and it took a while for our food to come out. Overall, I wouldn't make the drive out to Arleta Library Bakery Cafe again, and don't recommend that others make a special trip out here. There are better brunch places closer to Downtown Portland, and for the same prices if not less! At least the parking was fairly easy to find and free."},{"name":"Cask'n Flagon","address":"62 Brookline Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Had a great time here the other day before the Cubs vs Red Sox game, and even after the game!

I came here based on positive online reviews and a solid recommendation from the concierge at my hotel.  No part of my experience met expectations.\\n\\nThe first strike was my reservation which was set at 9pm -- a safe time to get seated quickly.  There was some confusion about who was responsible for preparing my table, so I cooled my heels at the bar while the staff worked out who would get my and several other tables ready for seating.\\n\\nThe second strike was the cocktail.  Being a fan of craft cocktails, I asked the bartender if he could whip up a Corpse Reviver and got an enthusiastic YES in response.  I've no idea how to describe the resulting drink that was finally foisted upon me after I had waited the entire time at the bar, been moved to a table and ordered.  Maybe it was an apple drink of some sort?\\n\\nI ordered the lobster tail which is shown on the menu as a chilled dish.  i asked for it instead to be heated.  The waiter steadfastly refused.  After some time, he finally said that the chef was simply refusing to heat the dish.  Strike three.  But wait, that's not all!\\n\\nFailing to get the lobster I wanted, I instead ordered the bluefish, a very common fish in the northeast.  The waiter sheepishly informed me they had, ummm, run out.  Again, after more time, I learned that the same immovable chef, makes his seafood purchases from his cousin and of course that day the cousin had run short on bluefish.  Strike four.\\n\\nAt this point, with a ruined appetite and totally ruined dining experience, I returned back to my hotel where i was relegated to feasting on chicken fingers and fries.\\n\\nThere were so many things wrong in this particular restaurant on this particular evening.  Absolutely incredible, absolutely surprising, absolutely disappointing."},{"name":"One Bistro","address":"1125 Boston Providence Tpike","city":"Norwood","stars":"4","text":"This place is delicious!

I know they are popular and lots of people like them, but I have bought several of them and they broke relatively quickly. Once or twice it was because I have small children who aren't careful and like to get into everything, but the other times it was because the screens had issues. They are kind of spendy for me to be replacing all the time. Also, I like reading at work, and am too afraid to just leave them sitting out like I would a normal book, for fear of someone stealing it, so I leave it in my car which isn't very convenient for me. This of course paves the way for traditional books, and I try and always come here. \\n\\n2) They have a large selection of books, especially in Powell's City of Books downtown. Online of course you can get \\"just about\\" anything, but the downtown store covers a whole city block several stories high which keeps me browsing for hours. \\n\\n3) They have new and used books, and either way they are generally in very good condition. Try bringing in a used book to sell and even with very minor flaws the books get rejected, so you don't have to worry about books where the spine splits and pages begin to fall out like I have gotten elsewhere. They'll even reject a book with a small stain on it when the book is still readable, which I don't care about but I guess they do. \\n\\n4) The book store is unionized, so even \\"if\\" I can get a better deal online, I will still purchase my books here when I can afford it. \\n\\n5) The staff are amazingly helpful and knowledgeable. If you can't find something, they will immediately leave their chair and walk over to the aisle with you. Short of using an associate for help, there are many computers situated throughout the store making it convenient to locate things. \\n\\nDrawbacks?\\n\\nAt the \\"city of books\\" location downtown, the parking lot is convenient but a bit scary. That parking lot needs to be updated. The ramps to get to each floor are steep, and the structure is very narrow. The ramps are only meant for one car at a time, so they expect you to honk on your way in and out of the structure so other cars know you are coming. Tongue in cheek, I almost feel that I'm risking my life everytime I go in and out of that place. \\n\\nI'm also worried that maybe Powell's won't be able to absorb the changes to the book marketplace, even with its supportive base of fans. I noticed that they recently started selling electronic books along with a suggested reader, so I guess that time will tell."},{"name":"Bennu Coffee","address":"515 S Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I come here 2-3 days a week in between working as a full time nurse, full time student and a full time mom to my 1 year old. The reason I give Bennu 4 stars instead of 5 is because I have had 3 separate extremely bad experiences with one barista in particular. She switches back and forth between locations, and I have never had a good experience with her. She is short tempered, rude and belittling. I ordered a turkey sandwich which took 45 minutes. After watching 8 people that were behind me get their food I walked up to her and asked her if my sandwich was almost ready. Her response rudely was, \\"well what did you have?\\" I told her a turkey sandwich and again extremely rudely she states, \\" Well there's like 6 different kinds, so which one was it?\\" Finally I said I don't even care, I worked a 12 hour day at the hospital with no time to eat, I will eat anything. Then she stomps off. This pretty much reflects every time I have had to deal with this lady.\\n\\n Just when I decided to give Bennu one more chance before finding a new coffee my experience was restored by my interactions with two incredible baristas, Bert and Christina. They are friendly, helpful and sweet.  I watched them interact with other customers and it is obvious they care about the customers experience. They are humble, kind and are able to connect to their customers by building rapport and showing genuine interest in their life.

Faster than we could dribble watery salsa down our shirts.  Faster than it took our waiter to bring us plates...oh wait, we never got any.\\n\\nYup, my experience at El Toro tonight was pretty much a disaster, with just three shining moments of mediocrity: 1.  The interior is very pretty.  2.  The corn chips were hot and tasty and 3. I had a 50% off Scoutmob coupon.\\n\\nThe patio was unfortunately full when we arrived, so we grabbed a seat inside.  The server was out of menus and only had one set of silverware, so we had to wait a minute to be able to peruse the selection of moderately priced tex-mex.  Though we eventually got the menus, we never got a second set of silverware.\\n\\nAfter a good 15-20 minutes, when the waiter came to get our drink orders, we both asked for waters and I got the special margarita as well.  The waters came with our chips and salsa, but the margarita never came.  Though we ordered an appetizer, it came with our entr√©e.\\n\\nAnd oh, that entr√©e...\\"Fajitas for Two with Steak\\" seems to be a pretty simple request, but what was delivered was highly disappointing.  For $30, there were about six slivers of badly charred meat covered in a seedy tomato sauce on some saut√©ed onion and still raw green peppers (see pictures).  It's probably a good thing that it didn't even come on one of the typical sizzling platters, because this steak couldn't have taken much more cooking.  The boy, the ultimate carnivore, ate one piece and disgustedly let me gnaw on the rest of the meat, eschewing a second bite.  That was very kind of him considering at this point we had had our food for a good fifteen minutes and still had only one set of silverware and no plates.  After requesting both from our server, I got up and helped myself to another set of silverware and asked for plates at the hostess stand.  None were ever delivered.\\n\\nConsidering the long wait for our menus, our drinks, our food, etc, we requested our check the next time we saw our server.  With platters still basically full of food and NO PLATES, you would think that this might have prompted some concern or question from the server.  In fact, this was the exact opposite and our request for the check was our only request of the night that was met with some speed and courtesy.  The check was presented, and the boy quickly gave his card, not wanting to spend another 15 minutes waiting for our server to return.\\n\\nHowever, in our hurry to speed up this process, we ended up being charged for two items we never ordered or consumed.  \\n\\nI really hoped to be able to add El Toro to my regular list of work lunches and neighborhood dinners, but bad food and bad service is a combination that does not merit a repeat visit."},{"name":"Cask'n Flagon","address":"62 Brookline Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"They ID you at the door, the place is very dimly lit, however it's a nice atmosphere.

We arrived at 2:30 and I guess it's a great time to arrive as the restaurant was about half full.  \\n\\nWe were seated and given our menus.  I was pretty determined to make my own pancakes, to see what that was like.  Spazz decided to order off the menu.  \\n\\nSomeone came by to oil the grill and instructed me to avoid the edge of the grill (as the batter won't cook).  I was also given the spatula and my sides of banana and walnuts.  Our server showed up with butter (I had asked for Earth Balance and didn't know she had given me regular butter at this point - she came back and replaced it without me asking if it was Earth Balance) and my squeeze bottle of vegan pancake batter.  I was told it would take about 5 minutes for this batter to cook thoroughly (the longest of all their batters).  She said that when it was ready to be flipped, I would know it because it would sorta hover over the grill and not stick when lifted.  Further instruction was that, for the bananas and walnuts, it was important to drown them in the batter.  \\n\\nI poured some of the batter and then put on the bananas and walnuts.  I then took the batter and covered the toppings with more batter.  I was disappointed it only made 2 small pancakes.  Impatient me allowed maybe 4 minutes before I started to play with it.  It did stick a little, but I kept loosening both pancakes.  I eventually flipped the first one and though our server was there to witness it and say it was a good flip, a part of the pancake didn't flip and I had a little bulky side that I was helpless to do anything about.  The second one was flipped with some help from Spazz and turned out a lot more even. \\n\\nAgain, I was impatient and tried to loosen the pancake before it was time.  Some stuck to the grill.  Eventually, Spazz got served his sweet potato casserole thing.  I didn't finish too long after he was served.  \\n\\nI was warned the homemade blueberry and strawberry syrups were tart, so I only tried a small drop of it.  Yep....too much for me.  I stuck with their pancake syrup instead of splurging $2 for their organic maple.  Where's IHOP's Butter Pecan syrup when you need it??!  \\n\\nMy pancakes, despite my awful culinary skills, were yummy.  I don't know about $5 (plus $1 each topping) for what only made 2 small pancakes, but I guess that's actually somewhat normal for restaurant pancakes.  I got to have them whichever way I wanted and I just love banana nut bread (which is what they basically tasted like).  I couldn't actually finish both pancakes, so Spazz got some.  His meal was supposed to have come with vegan sausage, but there was none in his dish.  When he inquired about it, he got a side of them and it was reflected as an added side on the bill.  They straightened it out in the end, but it was still confusing to know what went wrong.  \\n\\nAll in all though, we were pleased with our visit.  It was a decent neighborhood, next to a bunch of food carts.  It's a bit far for us, but then what vegetarian and vegan options aren't far for us?  Anyway, we'll go back again in the future.

The halibut ceviche is on the sour side, but still delicious.  The lobster roll had more zest than the ones we're used to from DC and Key West, but pretty good nonetheless.

We even had room for cannoli for dessert! (Not at the Daily Catch but at the Modern Bakery down the street. The line for Mike's Pastry was way too long.)

They ran out of clams so they substituted with scallops which was fine.  The yummy tomato based sauce with a small kick of spicy goodness is to die for.

When I moved away and returned 2 years later for a recruiting trip, Cafe Luna immediately came to mind as a perfect place to conduct student interviews as it was close to campus and has great food and coffee. \\n\\nWhen I walked in, I was a little worried because it seemed like a bit more upscale than the casual cafe I was used to. It was now more of a sit-down-and-order place rather than go-to-the-counter-and-order place, which is great but not exactly the ideal situation for an entire day of interviews. I was worried because I felt bad taking up 2 tables for an entire day, and even though my coworkers and I were going to order a lot of food and drinks throughout the day, for ourselves and our candidates, it probably wouldn't be as much as other paying customers on their typical day. I wavered between telling the manager what we were up to, and just carrying through with our plans, hoping that we wouldn't be asked to leave because we were there for too long.\\n\\nA friend encouraged me to talk to the manager and just communicate what we were trying to do. So I asked for the manager, who introduced herself as Kim and I told her my concerns. Her response: \\"No problem! Stay as long as you want! We're open until 5pm. I also have pen and paper if you need it. And don't feel obligated to order anything more than you need or want!\\" \\n\\nAnd that's how you get a customer for life. \\n\\nAlso, the lobster omelette, latte, and hot chocolate are all amazing. :)"},{"name":"Betty","address":"1100 Burrard Street, Suite 102","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Tremendous coffee drinks served in a space ripped from the late 60's.

Please share. \\nHere's what happen: 2 of my children are sick and we were at the doctors for hours & we were all hungry. There was a buffet near by I stopped there because I just wanted them to get food quick but not fast food. The cashier asked for their ages I said: 8,5, 3 & one adult. She said all pay but the 3 year old is free I said ok great. We set down. My daughter stayed at the table waiting on her food. With one hand I held one son's hand & his plate the other hand holding the other son's hand & his plate. I get to the table cutting up their meat. So I can go & get my daughter's plate next. The manager/owner comes to the table & saids I need to speak to you can you come here? I said I'm feeding my kids is there an issue? Whatever you need to speak to me about you can tell me while I cut my son's food. She said well the cashier made a mistake & you were suppose to pay for the 3 year olds drink. I said okay well how much is it? She said $1.25. I said how much was mine drink? she said the same price. I said okay great then give him my drink & give me water. She said you sure you want to do that? I said yes I don't have time to go back to the cashier again because you guys made a mistake so just give me water & give him my drink. I got my hands full so can you just please do that? She said I don't care if you have your hands full that's not my problem. I said can you just bring me water & my son his drink & leave us alone because we are hungry & my kids are sick we just came from the doctors. We just want to eat. She said I don't have to leave you alone and I can make you leave. I was like what? So you mean to tell me because I said don't bother me I got my hands full & I just told you we are hungry & they are sick you are making us leave? She said yes. I was very upset of course. I got the kids up, put on their coats on & told them we needed to leave, when I saw their faces of disappointment because they been waiting hours to eat, my mommy mood kicked in & I said it very loud so the whole resturant could hear me.

After we left I decided it was worth making the video because my kids were in the car crying because of hunger.

I liked the idea that the toppings were grilled to add to the burger.  Too bad they don't really do that.  The toppings, including the \\"grilled onions,\\" were raw and had no opportunity to develop any flavor.  I did see them on the grill.  What happened?  The burger was tasteless and overcooked.  The french fries were still partially raw. I noted for reference that there were no options for smaller portions, snacks or meals for children, so no option but a lot of food and a big bill, which isn't always what is needed. Not the best use of dining dollars. So, because the price skews fairly high for the area, the food needs to be great and well prepared.

I mean, how well can a Caucasian man make Northern Thai food? So what if Andy Ricker is one of this year's James Beard Award nominee? So what if Pok Pok was named the Oregonian's Restaurant of the Year in 2007? How authentic can the food really be?\\n\\nWell, my parents lived in a small rural town outside of Chiang Rai for over 10 years before immigrating to the United States so I grew up on Northern Thai/Lao food. And let me tell you... the food at Pok Pok is pretty close to my daddy's (my daddy is the better cook, not my momma). They even use stainless steel soup spoons... just like home!\\n\\nThe food:\\n\\n1)Kao Soi. This is the Thai version of Kao Soi with curry, coconut milk and yellow noodles, which is different from the Lao Version of Kao Soi that I'm used to with white noodle and a tomato based broth. But I've had this version of Kao Soi before and it's the best so far. It had a perfect amount of curry and coconut milk in the broth and it wasn't too thick and heavy.\\n\\n2)Papaya salad: Spicy and sour, not too much sugar, just like how its supposed to be!\\n\\n3) Fish Sauce Wings: Delicious and crispy. The glaze isn't overly sweet and goes perfectly with sticky rice. It really reminds me of my daddy's chicken wings. And don't be afraid to get down and dirty and use your hands because it's finger licking good.\\n\\n4) Kai Yaang Chicken: Perfectly cooked chicken. It's not as flavorful as the Fish Sauce wings, but it's the simplicity of the dish that makes the chicken stand out. But it comes with a great sweet chili dipping sauce. This is another dish that goes really well with sticky rice and you'll want to eat it with your hands. \\n\\n5) Pad seew: Average\\n\\n6) Yam Wun Sen. MY FAVORITE BECAUSE IT TASTES JUST LIKE MY DADDY'S. It's a clear noodle salad that's sour and has minced pork, dried shrimp and fried garlic. It's such a refreshing salad... perfect for a hangover, a warm day, or just about any occasion. It was so good that I wanted to lick the plate clean.\\n\\nWe also had their Bloody Mary and their Tamarind Whiskey Sour, both are great cocktails that I would definitely order again. For dessert we had fried bread (the kind you dip in your rice porridge at Chinese restaurants) that we dip in ice cream with espresso. It was delicioso! The salty, oily, warm bread is a great compliment to the ice cream. Also, I really liked their outdoor eating area because it reminds me of a food stand at a night bazaar in Chiang Mai, which definitely feeds into the authenticity of the restaurant.\\n\\nAlthough the portions are not huge, it's still a really good deal for the quality of the food.
