Overall, the food is very sweet. The chicken karaage came with perfectly cooked, portion and plated. But there was a chili honey drizzle on it that was too overpowering with the yuzu mayo. I am more used to the salt and peppery karaage. If it didn't have the honey, it would have been perfect with the yuzu mayo. As for the ramen, it was ok. In comparison to my go-to ramen places like Danbo or Santouka (not for the hype but really their broth can't compare), this soup was thinner and much sweeter. If you can take heat, I would suggest that you ask for extra chili oil and drizzle it on top to balance out the sweetness. The chashu was perfectly grilled with the smokey bbq flavour but it would have been much better if they used a bit more fatty meat - the caramelized fat would go well with the broth. In the end, I could not finish the noodles as they were too sweet for my taste. With a few adjustments, I feel like this place has great potential!

There is always one thing that is consistent in my orders when I come here. It's the Spicy Chicken Sandwich. I've gotten it with Fries, and the fried cheese curds during brunch. The cheese curds are really good btw. The come with syrup to dip them in. It sounds weird at first. But once you try it, you will love it. Now back to the Chicken Sandwich. For one it is really spicy. It's Hot Hot. Not like burn your tastebuds off, to the point that you can't taste anything. No, no, this is a wonderful heat, sitting a little too close to a fireplace heat, but it's still good heat because it's cold outside, type of wonderful heat lmao. It burns so nice, but you can still taste the layers of flavors in the sandwich, First they top it with a red pepper. A Lot of heat comes from this. I like to take it off the top and place it on the sandwich. Then there is the spicy honey butter they put on top of the bun. Do NOT remove this. This gives it flavor and heat as well. Then the Chicken is so juicy, and the breading is very nice. The bread and butter zucchini are the perfect complement to the sandwich as well. As you can tell I love this sandwich.\\n\\nThe service is always pretty nice. I've never had an issue. Everything is on time and everything I need is always there. \\n\\nOverall i will say: Rockmill Tavern has THE BEST spicy chicken sandwich in the city of Columbus. And its by a landslide according to my tastebuds. I wish it wasn't so expensive though. And some of the sides could be a little better. Sometimes the fries come out a little overcooked. Also i don't like that the sides aren't really included in the meal, I have to pay extra to have a side with my sandwich is kinda lame. But not too much other things to complain about.

The chicken and veggies were fresh and perfect as well.  The only thing the sandwich was missing was heat so I added hot sauce.

I've heard great things about the food (spoiler: that part was delicious) but the atmosphere and overall service was really lacking.\\n\\nWe arrived for a 6:00 dinner reservation on a Saturday night, and already the place was packed--which is great for them! However, the first problem of the night was our table. We were seated in a two-top along the banquette wall, and the tables were so close together, I had to pull our table out so I sit on the bench. I understand that restaurants want to seat as many people as possible, but a situation like this is just embarrassing. I am an average sized person, so someone larger than me would probably have difficulty navigating that seating situation--not to mention other accessibility concerns. \\n\\nOnce we were seated, it took 10 minutes for anyone to even look our way. We finally got some water from the busser, and still our server didn't even acknowledge the table. When she finally did come over, the table next to us intercepted her because they had been waiting for their check for so long. I understand servers get in the weeds, but it did seem like the restaurant was really over capacity in terms of what they could handle. She was very nice and explained the menu to us (this is one of those places where the menu \\"needs\\" an explanation), but by that point we were actually considering just leaving and eating somewhere else.\\n\\nOnce we got our drinks, things got a little better. I had \\"the one in the grapefruit\\" which was tasty, but I think it was basically just a paloma. My partner had a beer. We ordered 4 dishes of various sizes, although the server suggested 4 to 6 for two people. We found that 4 was plenty of food though. We started with a tuna crudo which was tasty and a little spicy. The lobster pasta we had was rich and delicious, as was the lamb BLT and corn salad.

So I took the end seat of the bar and actually had a grand time. Much better than if I was just chilling at a table by myself!\\n\\nI got the spicy deviled eggs to start. This is a big portion with five halved eggs and a pile of rather spicy pickles to go with. Delicious.\\n\\nMy main course arrived. I had the one meat platter. Brisket with collard greens and cole slaw. The brisket was absurd. It was almost too good. Perfect flavor, excellent texture, just the right tenderness that no knife was needed. And while the bartender did line up their three bottles of sauces (house, mustard and hot), none of them were at all needed for this tasty meat.\\n\\nThe seat at the bar was great and they do have a special bar menu. My eggs and platter of brisket was $30.

Certainly, doesn't stand up to cuisine in NY or Miami. I'm grateful to afford such a meal and the portions are enough to feed a full family! We bought three dishes for decent prices. \\n\\nThe Food---\\nI had the whole red snapper which was cooked well with flavor and no fishy taste (A+). However, the fish was supposed to be escovitch and that's where it came up short. The garnishing (onions, peppers, and tomato) for this type of technique requires acid and spice which lacked severely. I paired it with a side of collard greens and candied yams with an unexpected set of plantains. The collard greens left much to be desired and were too sweet. The candied yams were flavorful but not In a soul food sort of way, yet it's hard to mess that up. \\n\\nNext up, I had the veggie roti. While the roti itself had authentic flavor, the curry inside just didn't give me the Trinidadian/Indian spices required. However, they didn't skimp on the potatoes, chickpeas and cabbage-- making it stomach filling. Had a the tamarind sauce---it certainly had tamarind flavor but once again lacked the authentic spice. It's appearance and Taste was a spin on bbq sauce. (Def not ideal for rotis)\\n\\nLastly, I ordered the spinach and dal with rice and peas. The spinach and dal had nice texture and was seasoned. The rice and peas were well done with a hint of coconut. And there was a unexpected pico de gallo that added a slight bit of spice and acid. \\n\\nOverall, I wouldn't be in a rush to go back and this spot needs to amp up the spices (I.e. Scotch bonnet) in order to call themselves Caribbean or Tropical Cuisine."},{"name":"JC's Just Chili","address":"1617 W 5th Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Being a Texan I'm picky about chili.

It wasn't TERRIBLE, but there was just this long list of weird little issues. There are two entrances from the main road - the first, most convenient one near the front door is marked \\"service vehicles only\\" despite not seeing a single service vehicle ever using it. Apparently you're supposed to go in the second and drive all the way back through the parking lot to get to the main entrance. Just weird.\\n\\nGetting to our room was a hassle - their key card maker was broken the weekend we went, so they had a maintenance staffer conducting people to their rooms. They were very friendly, and hey, stuff breaks, no BIG deal... but on top of everything else...\\n\\nNext, the room was very large, but honestly so large it almost felt EMPTY - there was just this weird large space beyond the entrance door of open carpet.

My conflict matches the inharmonious nature of this place perfectly. Allow me to explain. (Grab a drink first, I have a lot to say about this place.) \\n\\nMy daughter is a new resident of Austin and she wanted to spend her birthday somewhere special, interesting, unusual. The Oasis on Lake Travis is a well-known tourist attraction, so it fit the bill. Reviews are so mixed, however, that before you even arrive, you already have a sense of apprehension. We told ourselves that we were coming for the view (particularly at sunset) that everyone raves about. Let's start there. \\n\\nLake Travis is a man-made lake created by the construction of a dam. It is vast (65 miles) and from The Oasis' position high up on a cliff, you get a very nice panoramic view. Yes, I said \\"very nice.\\" Admittedly, it was somewhat cloudy on the day we visited. However, the sun did peek out of the clouds just in time for the sunset--and it was, indeed, lovely. Yes, I said \\"lovely\\". \\n\\nHere's the thing. It took me a bit to realize why people were so in awe of the view, while our reaction was, \\"That's nice.\\" There aren't many bodies of water in central Texas where one can view spectacular sunsets. Hailing from the northeast, spending summers at the shore and vacationing all over the world, we've seen a lot of gorgeous sunsets against the backdrop of natural bodies of water. So we weren't quite as impressed.\\n\\nThe food is the next big topic of debate in reviews. The daughter ordered mahi mahi ($26), and despite not being a huge seafood fan, thoroughly enjoyed it. The husband and I each ordered a different burger ($14), and were quite satisfied as well, though the waffle fries were not even warm. (Note that everything you order in Austin is spicy, \\"They sneak it in there,\\" quipped the daughter. Indeed, jalapenos are as common as salt, so ALWAYS ask how spicy the dish is if hot hot hot isn't your thing.) Prices were a tad high for a regular restaurant, but not for a touristy spot IMO. Drinks were very well made, not watered down, and at $12 for a souvenir, hurricane glass-sized cocktail, $8.50 without, fairly priced.  \\n\\nAtmosphere: You can park within the complex (in spots or in a garage, it seemed) or the parking lot across the street. We chose across the street and it was a quick walk to the entrance. As you come upon The Oasis, you are taken in by the beauty of the foliage and massiveness of the large, stone complex with signage alerting you to stores, a brewery, gift shop, etc. At that point, the \\"tourist trap\\" reputation is understood. \\n\\nWe were there on a Monday evening and it wasn't very busy. We noticed several decks outside with empty tables. Great! No lines means no wait, right? Nope. We still had to wait about 45 minutes. Apparently, they close off certain sections on weekdays. This was strike #1. How can you make people wait \\"45 minutes to an hour\\" when you have DOZENS of empty tables? \\n\\nStrike #2 came from talking with the hostesses. Zero social skills. They don't smile and don't make you feel welcome. If it hadn't been for the 40 minute drive to get there, we might have turned around and walked out. (Bad service is another common--and deserved--complaint about the restaurant. But as it is a popular destination, I imagine management doesn't really care.)\\n\\nStrike #3: While you wait at the bar, you cannot order anything but cocktails. No food, appetizers, snacks, nothing. You have to wait up to an hour and can only drink. SMH. \\n\\nStrike #4: They text you when your table is ready. When we got up to the hostess stand, there was a long line of people waiting to put their names on the wait list. WE HAD TO WAIT IN THIS LINE TO BE SEATED. How absurd is that?!\\n\\nStrike #5: Our table was right in the path of the stairs leading from the inside to the sunset viewing area. As people repeatedly walked by banging into our chairs, we couldn't help but wonder what fool decided that was a good place for a table.\\n\\nStrike #6: Our server left menus, then didn't return. I had to get up and ask for someone to take our orders. EDITED: I should have mentioned that a manager (I assume) took over and was very attentive. Our waitress did return eventually, apologized and seemed flustered. The place, overall, just seems very poorly run.\\n\\nThe complex has multiple levels, including at least 3 viewing decks, 2 bars, 2 dining rooms, a stage area, brewery, and shopping section. (Sidenote: no one was quite sure when the brewery was open, where or when the advertised live music was played or where some of the pinpoints on the establishment's wall map were located.) The best way to describe the decor is frenetic. Something to see no matter where you look, none of it matching. Arabian style hanging lanterns, a giant animated jalapeno pepper, lighted peacocks, Grecian-looking statues, tiki hut, a monkey on a banana. No sense of style or consistency. Doing their part to keep Austin weird, I suppose."},{"name":"The Toothsome Chocolate Emporium And Savory Feast Kitchen","address":"Universal CityWalk Orlando, 6000 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"My, oh, my!

Others like to eat their sorrows. Given the events of this week (Jan. 27, another day that will live in infamy?), I decided to pull myself away from Facebook/CNN/the interwebs in general and attempt to drown my sorrows and eat them away at the same time.\\n\\nFood: We got the burger, squash, lettuce wraps, and biryani. Summary: get the lettuce wraps and biryani, skip the burger.\\n-The burger was okay. It was a lot smaller than I expected and it didn't come with anything on the side. The french onion soup sauce was delicious and made the burger but had it not been there, I don't think the burger was anything special. Maybe I am a burger snob, but the bun was just a plain bun that became soggy very fast, and the patty was pretty thin, not the juicy behemoth I expected. \\n-Squash was thinly fried and pretty delicious. I just wish there had been more of the chutney to mix the squash with because many pieces were just squash with little seasoning/sauce.\\n-Lettuce wraps were probably the best thing I had. The lamb bacon was chewy and smoky, almost like a jerky but better. It wasn't greasy at all. Paired with the sauce, the pimento cheese and the veggies (tomatoes and lettuce), it was perfect. I could eat these wraps all day every day, though I'd probably die of a heart attack pretty quickly given its mainly cheese, mayonnaise and meat.\\n-Biryani leads me to mixed feelings. I loved the flavor of it, especially mixed with the nuts. But I could barely taste the halibut. Overall, it was still worth it for the smoky pickles that it came with.\\n\\nDrinks: This is probably where they lose a star.\\nMy pet peeve is when a bar/restaurants puts a ton of ice in a drink. I always feel like they're trying to short change you and it bothers me to no end. The drinks were good, but there was a lot of ice, so maybe get a drink that doesn't come with ice. \\nThough beware, the KO comes in a flask, which I didn't realize until they brought it. The table over definitely thought I was an alcoholic who brought my own flask to a restaurant.\\n\\nThe service is meh. It was hard getting ahold of the waitress when we wanted her but she was pretty knowledgable about the menu and did her job. The water was always full, but they had a habit of always trying to take dishes away before we were finished. \\n\\nOverall, it was a pretty good distraction, until I left the restaurant and realized it's still 2017."},{"name":"Superica","address":"99 Krog St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"The best ever.

We ended up getting a couple dozen to try all the flavors and also take some back home for our hubbies. I really liked the ones with nutella/chocolate. The maple bacon was also interesting.

It wasn't too busy when we arrived around 7 PM.  I ordered the pho tai, and Dan got the beef stew.  The pho had a generous amount of rare steak, probably the most I've seen in a standard bowl, and was worth the $6.99.  The broth, as in my previous takeout order, was very thin.  I've eaten a lot of pho, and usually drink the broth straight, without adding any sauces, because the spices and the long simmering creates a very rich, flavorful broth.  This was the first time I had ever had to add additional sauces to make the broth worth drinking.  On the plus side, it wasn't too salty, which is something that happens often with pho broth.  Dan enjoyed the stew, although the flavors were very pungent and had a bit of a spicy kick that made it difficult to get through the whole bowl.  We also tried the strawberry boba smoothie; the tapioca was a little mushy, as if it had been sitting for a while, though the smoothie itself was good.\\n\\nThe waitress was nice enough, but rushed us through the meal -- we were still eating when she offered us dessert, and still eating when she offered to bring the check.  It wasn't so busy that they needed our table, so I'm not sure if she just didn't realize we were still eating, or whether they normally try to turn over the tables very quickly.\\n\\nThe combination of the rushed service and the bland broth result in this restaurant getting crossed off of my pho-go-to places."},{"name":"The Rolling Rooster","address":"13717 Mopac Service Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Tasty, cooked to order oxtail, pork chops, collards, okra, fried wings/shrimp/catfish.

My friends and I arrived at around 7:15 on a Saturday night and it was no surprise that there were line ups out the door. The restaurant was relatively small (seating approximately 45 people) and we waited for about an hour for a seat for 3. (I wouldn't recommend coming if you're pressed for time!) It seemed like the most popular dish was the hot plate (literally every table had one). Each order of a hot plate requires a MINIMUM of 2 orders (they place two orders of meat on the same plate). My friends and I opted for the winter special which had spicy baby octopus and pork ($15/person). Each hot plate comes with corn and egg but cheese is an additional $5. (Tip: don't eat all the cheese at the beginning of your feast because it's an additional $5 to refill!) When you are just about done with the hot plate, you can also order \\"fried rice\\" for $3, where they bring a bowl of rice, with chopped up nori, and fry it with the rest of the sauce that's left on the hot plate. We found that the rice was super spicy and didn't like it too much but the flavour was still really good! We also ordered Mom's Pop Chicken ($10) and an order of Japchae ($15). My friends and I ordered beers as well and upon ordering, we were not ID'd. After I had already finished half my bottle, a waitress came and asked for ID. My one friend and I had ours and the other forgot hers so after talking amongst one another, a waitress came and told us \\"no beer\\". We agreed that our friend just wouldn't have any, and continued on but the same waitress came back and told us all of us couldn't have any beer? She said it was the \\"rule\\" which I disputed telling her I was of age (22) and having my ID, I am allowed to legally purchase alcohol. (I was mostly frustrated because she was refusing to listen to me and kept talking over me insisting that none of us could drink). Another waitress came by (she might have been the manager or floor leader because she was wearing something different) and I explained the situation to her. She agreed that my friend and I were allowed to have the alcohol so we continued on and that was that. So rule of thumb: make sure you bring your ID if you want to purchase alcohol, otherwise you will be hassled by the waitresses (who didn't seem to be checking other customer's IDs?) Regardless of the service, the food was up to par with the hype that's been going around with this new restaurant. It was definitely a novelty piece since there's nothing else like it in Vancouver yet. As for the chicken, it resembled sweet and sour pork (for the coating), spiced up a notch (I wouldn't recommend this). And the Japchae was delicious (it was such a huge portion too!) Overall, I was very pleased with the food, and it was fairly priced as well. I would recommend it but not during peak dinner hours unless you have time to spare. I'm also hoping to see an expansion to Vancouver or even Burnaby so this location will be a little less crowded and also so it's a little more convenient to get to."},{"name":"China Jade","address":"6104 Boardwalk St","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"Love this place!

My most recent visit for dinner was actually very pleasant.\\n\\nWe ordered a slew of sushi items, too many to name, but the standouts for me were the tuna tower, jalapeno yellowtail sashimi, Picasso roll, and assorted nigiri sushi.

The Picasso roll was my accidental favorite.  After the server raved about it, I gave it a try, and it will now be something I order every time.  The yuzu freshened up the entire dish with the cilantro adding that extra flavor profile that made it a very delicious roll.\\n\\nService was attentive, friendly, and knowledgeable of the entire menu.  Kona Grill does have an extensive menu, with items that just seem like they don't belong, Jambalaya, Caprese, and a Cuban sandwich?  What an odd combination!

Oh, and they make crepes too! \\n\\nThe owner of Perierra Creperie opened a second location down here on this little alley (brilliant!) offering late night crepes to the drunken downtown crowd, and in the back he stashed a nifty little bar made with wood, metal, and some fairly uncomfortable school-house style metal stools. It's cute, hip, a little sexy, and has some great design features. \\n\\nThe space is small, with a main floor and a balcony/mezzanine sitting over the back bathroom/kitchen area. The high ceilings and ancient brick walls lend an \\"we just built this thing into an alley between 2 historic buildings\\" kind of vintage feel. A giant metal windmill fan hanging from the ceiling caps what otherwise would have been a cavernous expanse, and a huge taxidermied Elk bust adorns the wall. I still have yet to figure out what the connection between hip culture and taxidermied animal busts is, but whatever, I've come to accept it. \\n\\nFor finishing touches, the lighting hanging over the booths running down the west side are these cool steam-punk style fixtures that offer a nice, glowing low light. The bathroom is fun, with an awesome wood counter-top and fun photo decoupage wall. \\n\\nThe bar itself is quite small, and manned (or should I say womanned?) by a heavy hitter from PDC in New York. Cute and unassuming, she exercises a relaxed control over her surroundings and obviously has easy command over the libations coming across the wooden bar top. \\n\\nWhile I haven't seen any sort of cocktail menu, I don't need to.

I love the ambiance of this Northstar because it feels cozy and you can relax while eating and talking with your friends."},{"name":"Disney Springs","address":"1486 Buena Vista Dr","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"I stopped at Disney Springs after my Animal Kingdom visit was completed (around 5PM). I was BLOWN AWAY by the size of this outdoor extravaganza (over 100 Shops)! For starters, the  garage parking was free(Orange L2) which was a VERY pleasant surprise :) This place is just as big as one of the parks, but all retail shopping/restaurants! This is shop/eat til you drop (Lol). I was sore from the earlier park, but found renewed energy to trek this landscape out. You will find/enjoy everything from a movie theater, Sprinkles cupcakes, Marvel souvenir shop,  Coca Cola Factory to an Outdoor Lego Store and with awesome Lego statues(Lego Dragon built in the lake), to a GIANT erupting volcano at Rain Forrest Cafe.(The Best one I have seen yet in any city). You can just spend the day here if you wanted if you enjoy an outdoor style mall/food courts. I also noticed a hot air balloon in use and boat rentals were available(Nice)! Just like all the Disney Parks, free maps are available to navigate. Too many shops to lists!!!!\\n\\nThis place became SUPER crowded after 8PM(Week night) so I would suggest going between 4PM--6PM. I HIGHLY recommend stopping here if you are visiting Orlando for the first time, or just want a different Experience from the Theme parks!

The food was good enough for 4-stars (it didn't blow me away, but it was a little better than par), and the service was adequate (also didn't blow me away). I'm afraid the atmosphere was horrible, and it pains me to write this as I know they just moved to a brand new location. The most disturbing part of our experience was the EXTREMELY LOUD NOISE generated by the kitchen, waitstaff, and more than anyone, the table bussers. It was so loud that we were having a hard time hearing each other speak amidst the very loud clinging and clanking of silverware being sorted, metal water pitchers being filled with ice, plates abruptly hitting the metal countertops in the kitchen pass window, and servers and kitchen staff shouting out orders to each other. If that wasn't bad enough (it was horrible, actually), the rest of the restaurant had raised its collective voice to compensate -- the patrons and the staff were literally shouting in order to be heard. The resultant cacophony was enough to drive anyone absolutely mad. My constructive advice: if you're going to run an open kitchen restaurant, then you've got to train your staff that your guests hear everything-- I mean absolutely everything-- that is done or said in the kitchen. As Americans, I'm afraid we are a loud lot, and perhaps people have come to expect everyplace to be loud in the U.S.. But it's unsettling; certainly not how one should sit down to enjoy a meal. Other counties, France in particular comes to mind, treat noise pollution like any other kind of pollution. In France, restaurants and bars in urban centers are required install noise meters with green, yellow, and red indicators -- when the noise reaches a bad threshold, the meter flashes red, and the establishment can be cited by the police for noise pollution. Oh how I wish we had the same protections here in the USA. Alas, our experience today was absolutely redlined at max noise pollution (it was an 11 out of 10). When I rose to speak with someone about it, I ran into the owner. Her look of annoyance and disappointment was clear when she realized that I wasn't stopping her to pay a compliment, but to offer some constructive feedback. Funny thing is, in order for her to be heard replying to my comment, she was literally shouting the words."},{"name":"Sunee Thai & Lao Kitchen","address":"1400 SE Stark St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Yummy Thai food, lovely little quaint place!

I always thought the prices at Smak were quite high, but I justified that fact by telling myself that it's the cost to pay for a healthy lunch with friendly, quick, and consistent service.

The woman I spoke to on the phone said if we came around 6 pm the wait should be about 45 minutes. \\n\\nWhen we arrived at 6 pm we were told that the wait would actually be 2 hours!! Apparently, because the park had just closed for HHN the crowds were higher than normal. Sure would have been nice if the woman on the phone I spoke with had told me this! I asked to speak with a manager who insisted there was nothing she could do and we would be seated as soon as possible. She did not offer any type of remedy for the situation and honestly acted as if she could care less. I even told her it was a special occasion and nothing. \\n\\nWe kept the spot in line and went next door to eat dinner at Hard Rock. Finally, 2 and a half hours later, almost 9 pm, we were sat for dessert. We were seated in a tiny, crowded room on the second floor.

I asked the lady bussing tables if they could turn up the air some and she told me \\"I can't do anything about it.\\" We also were informed the kitchen was running 30 minutes behind. So our desserts took almost another hour to even get to our tables. We didn't actually walk out of the restaurant until almost 11 pm. \\n\\nAnd finally, my 5 year old daughter was with us and wanted to meet Penelope. In the 2 hours we waited to get our food and pay checks she never once came to our table. So I asked our server if she could come by real quick before we left. She informed me \\"that's a different department\\" and that she would have to ask her manager. By that point I just walked up to the character and asked her to say hello to my daughter. I will say she was the highlight of the evening and very professional. \\n\\nAs for the desserts, they were nothing exceptional and the milkshakes were ridiculously overpriced.

They are frosted very neatly and topped with some cute sugar design that you can eat. The cake was moist for both the vanilla and chocolate. Not too sweet either.

It was crazy busy, probably because it was a Saturday on a holiday weekend and we were a party of 7 but anyway. Staff seemed super frazzled and frustrated. From the person who checked us in to the girl who walked us to the table, there was just a rushed and negative energy. \\n\\nDespite the ladies we interacted with initially, our server was AMAZING. I didn't get his name but I really wish I had. My grandmother is sick and was visibly uncomfortable settling in and he made it a point to let her know that he would get her anything she needed. It was such a kind gesture and only took a second on his part. I really appreciated that. He seemed really busy and was still able to be attentive to us and make sure we had whatever we needed. \\n\\nThe food was good, nothing out of this world. It came out quick and everything was exactly how we wanted it, modifications and all. We were lucky enough to get a table overlooking the lake so we enjoyed the view during lunch. \\n\\nAll in all, I probably wouldn't go back expecting too much.

Having heard of slightly rude service dissuading some while slightly stale pastries turned off others my plan was to arrive early - before the crowds had time to wear on the staff and while all was fresh - and while the latter was a success the customer service aspect was foiled by a pair of issues, namely a broken air conditioner and the city of Boston jack hammering the sidewalk out front in order to pour a new one (apparently unannounced to the owners.)  With the service prompt yet gruff as the owners and clerks wondered aloud how anyone was even going to be able to see they were open let alone enter the shop once the pouring began my order was placed quickly and $17 later I was seated at the table enjoying breakfast with more treats for later boxed to go.\\n\\nHaving already noted my standards two of my selections were no surprise to anyone - the first a Rhum baba nearly 1.5x the size of that at Modern and while equally flawless in texture and creamy balance so boozy that I'd be surprised if it contained less than a shot and a half of rum in addition to the Strega - to be fair it was delicious and quite similar to some of the best I had in France, but at the same time it likely would have been better served after 8am. In addition to the Baba, my other breakfast choice was something novel - a delicacy titled \\"Boston Bocconotti,\\" essentially a cream puff masquerading as a Boston Cream pie...or perhaps a portable Boston Cream pie - but either way a lovely balance of sweet vanilla cream housed in a crunchy pate a choux style shell and dipped in semisweet chocolate with a white chocolate drizzle.\\n\\nTurning toward my second standard bearer, and certainly Mike's most famous item, I must say that with more than a dozen options there was no way I could simply select one Cannoli and in the end I opted for three.  Well aware of the fact that Mike's Cannoli's were pre-filled as opposed to the a la minute style served at Modern my expectations were appropriately tempered - especially as I waited nearly 2 hours after ordering to enjoy mine - but in the end I came away duly impressed both by the flavors and the textures which, while not as crisp as Modern, were still better than 95% of my previous cannoli experiences.  With my choices including chocolate cream dipped in chocolate chip, ricotta with hazelnut, and peanut butter mascarpone I will note that given the wetness of ricotta this was certainly the least crisp of the trio and for those looking for a traditional cannoli (with ricotta) the better choice would certainly be Modern - but for those looking for more interesting options you could do a whole lot worse than Mike's."},{"name":"Mother‚Äôs Bistro & Bar","address":"121 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"The Greek frittata was very tasty, but I would have liked crispier home fries.

There was at least 10 of us but we managed to take up the space of about two tables. But even taking that into consideration, my personal experience was still very horrible. Let's start with the good\\n\\nThe aesthetics of the place was not bad, it looked like an upscale cabin type venue with dim light but still very social and bustling. It was noisy but not loud enough that you can't hear the person in front of you. It is a very hipster yet interesting kind of look. This place is supposedly known for their drinks and judging by all my friends who ordered one, they were pretty strong. This is the only reason why this rating is 2 stars.\\n\\nSo the items on the menu is very expensive. And based on the service and food I got, I don't understand why. So being slightly caught off guard by the price is ordered flatuas which were somewhat cheap and described as fried chicken tacos. What I ended up getting was a hard shell opened burrito with a bunch of greenery on top and a huge glob of sour cream and guacamole on it. It took me about 3 minutes to even figure out how to eat the thing, let alone pick it up. So much was happening with it and none of it was fun. And on top of that, it wasn't all good in terms of taste. I actually double checked with the waiter to make sure if it was the right order. That's how confused I was as to what I was handed.\\n\\nAnd all of this occurred after waiting about 30 minutes or more for the food. The entire party literally had to stop themselves from eating the second bowl of two servings of chips and salsa. I ordered an lemonade and what I got was unmixed water with maybe a drop of lemon juice and syrup. When I first took a sip, I thought it was water. Then my friend suggested I stirred, which I did, and barely tasted any semblance of lemonade. Hell I barely tasted sugar. I promptly sent it back and got a water.\\n\\nNow back to the food. The birthday girl is vegan so she ordered something with left out ingredients to make it veganized. That order came out wrong and she had to wait some more after the 30 minutes. I had some place to go afterwards so I asked for my check when I got my food. The waiter complied, and came back three times with no check in hand. I actually didn't receive my check until he went and got everyone else's, handed theirs out, and then came to me. I was the first to ask for it and the last to receive it. This process took just as long when I handed him my card and waited to get it back. When I got it back, I ended up borrowing a pen from some other person because he left none. \\n\\nThe service was extremely bad in my opinion. We had to ask for straws, a knife to cut the cake, plates, just basic service items. I promise we weren't being critical or snooty. It was just bad. I personally did not enjoy any part of this experience. And especially for a place that's so pricey, it needed to show for it. All I was left with was questions on why this place was so bad.\\n\\nLike I said, people said this place was known for their drinks (which I should note, were half glass sized) and my friends seemed to enjoyed theirs so that's why they didn't get the lowest grade possible. However I will say that their brunch menu didn't come with a bottomless option, which everyone was disappointed about. Not sure if I just came on a wrong day, but I wouldn't recommend this place. Definitely not for brunch. I don't know about dinner because I didn't get one of the expensive food items, but even then, I won't be looking in this restaurant's direction any time soon.

This is conveniently located on 2nd Street downtown (if you are staying in the area).\\n\\nWe got the lunch plate with two meat choices and two sides:  \\n\\nWhat we liked about Lamberts was the \\"sides\\" options.  As you can see from the photo we got the macaroni and cheese and the collard greens as our sides.  Both were very good.  The collard greens were cooked in bacon (and you could just get a hint of it) and were quite tender.  Perhaps some of the best we have had over the years.  \\nThe macaroni and cheese was also good, with a top that was a little solid which we like, but there was quite a bit of sauce and not too many macaroni noodles.  Perhaps the small ramekin container made it hard to add more noodles, so I would give it a seven out of ten, mostly because of the creamy sauce and top.\\n\\nWe ordered the pulled pork and the brisket.\\n\\nThe pulled pork could have been a little more tender and was not really \\"pulled\\".  Rather, it was a piece of pork which was still one large piece they put sauce on prior to serving us which was a combination of their house and spicy sauce.  If you want to put on your own sauce, be sure to tell the server.  We did not assume it came with someone else's concoction on top of it.  We would have rather tried both sauces alone with no meat and then put on our own.  \\n\\nThe brisket was good, a little dry, but had a good flavor.  We got four small pieces on our lunch plate.  Two brisket pieces were from the lean end of the brisket and two from the fatty end.  The fatty pieces were QUITE fatty.  Apparently, based on the large pieces of fat in the brisket, the fat had not really rendered out of the meat when cooking.\\n\\nThe meat was served at room temperature, so be sure to understand if you order a \\"cold\\" beer you may have fat coagulating in your mouth!  LOL!  \\n\\nNo bread, onions or pickles served her to make a traditional sandwich.\\n\\nThis restaurant was not as friendly as others we had visited in the area.  \\n\\nIf we returned to Austin, we would not return here for food, but were glad for the experience to be able to compare it to other barbecue restaurants we went to while in Austin.   \\n\\nEnjoy!"},{"name":"The Toothsome Chocolate Emporium And Savory Feast Kitchen","address":"Universal CityWalk Orlando, 6000 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"This place is awesome my family loves this place we ordered the chocolate x5 the food I've heard is good and the workers are nice"},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Walk around the neighborhood and everyone has a box of Mike's - there's a reason why!\\n\\nThe pastries are DAMN good! \\n\\nAnticipate long lines & limited seating, yet it's worth the wait. \\n\\nOne of Boston's favorites.

Unfortunately, I was always in school or working and never around to eat there.\\n\\nFast forward to now. I work in HR (Recruiting specifically) for a huge global company that doesn't require me to go to an office every day. This works out well for me because I don't particularly like wearing pants. Working from home is great, although I do enjoy leaving the house to grab some take out and get some fresh air (I wear pants when I leave the house). It finally occurred to me that I now have the luxury of being able to eat at Mighty Subs. It's almost like I've been waiting 30 years for this opportunity. Well let me tell you - it was worth the wait. \\n\\nMighty Subs motto is, \\"Our small is their large.\\" This statement is actually 100% accurate. Their small is 10\\" and their large is 20\\". You're probably assuming that they don't stuff their subs so the extra length is just extra bread. Well, that assumption is completely wrong (they pack both length and girth). So now you're probably assuming that they charge double. Nope, you're wrong again. Smalls range from 6 to 7 dollars; larges are 10 to 11 dollars. \\n\\nAs some other reviewers have said, you truly do not need a large for one person. I only get larges because it means I don't have to make dinner later. Taking one down in one sitting will absolutely lead to a food coma. I'm speaking from experience. \\n\\nI rotate between the Italian, Chicken Parm, and Steak Works. The Steak Works is my favorite, hands down. \\n\\nMighty Subs also offers breakfast until 11am. I haven't tried it yet, but will update this review once I do so. The whole point of working from home is so I don't have to leave the house in the morning, so I'm facing somewhat of a paradox. \\n\\nThe lines can be long around noon, but don't worry, they move insanely fast. If you get a cold sub it will be ready in 1-2 minutes. Hot subs are only a 5-10 minute wait. \\n\\nThey also accept all 4 credit cards, so feel free to whip out your hipster Discover card. \\n\\nThe hours are 5:30am to 4:00pm.

My personal favorite was the calamari.  I asked for the remoulade on the side and just squeezed lemon on mine. My friend said her favorite were the bao buns.  She said they were her favorite in town over other competitors.  I did not like the shrimp tempura roll.  Although the roll was clearly fresh (as was the rest of our food) the shrimp tempura was just a little boring. I think I may have been missing the eel sauce to add a little depth.\\n\\nDrinks: I had a craft beer on tap (not happy hour included), their house rose, and my friend had a Kirkin.  My favorite was honestly the craft beer.  I think Seito is a great happy hour spot for appetizers and maybe one drink but I would rather grab drinks somewhere else for happy hour pricing.  \\n\\nBe prepared to still drop some money (if alcohol is ordered) during happy hour.

You warned me I would not find real bbq, that the sides were atrocious, that any self respecting Tennessee bbq lover would rather eat tofu than choke down this offal, but no. I was in a hurry to get out of Portland and so I stayed. What follows is the story of me learning this lesson the hard way. \\n\\nUpon walking in, a typical hipster Portland waitress eventually told us to sit ourselves. My boyfriend and I decided to split the 5 rib dinner with mac n cheese and mashed potatoes, while our friend got beef brisket sandwich with fries.\\n\\nApparently beef ribs was a mistype on the menu for charcoal logs. The sauce, Memphis style, was on the sides, and we dutifully poured it on before our first, much anticipated bite. The thick blackened exterior covered a thin, overly chewy strip of meat clinging desperately to the bone. Overall, there was far more unidentifiable burned lumps outside than edible meat within. Just what everyone wants in ribs, right? A giant, burned meat toothpick. Cavemen roasting mastodon ribs in caves would have done a better job.\\n\\nThe sauce was thin, insipid, and boring. Seriously, did y'all just add some water to the some grocery store sauce with Memphis on the label? I gamely ground the dessicated flesh between my molars, just trying to get through the meal and on the road. My boyfriend looked at me, unhappiness clear on his bbq sauce-smeared face. Unacceptable.\\n\\nNext comes the one PLEASANT aspect of our visit. Upon approaching our waitress and explaining the problem, she had no problem swapping the ribs out for their smoked meatloaf, which I naively was interested to try. She even brought out an extra side of mashed potatoes, which was really nice.\\n\\n Unfortunately, the good feeling only lasted until the \\"meatloaf\\" arrived. ***NOTE I refuse to call it meatloaf, which insults the delicious meal made by loving moms across America, so it shall from here on be called spiced meat cake***. The spiced meat cake came covered in a gravy straight from the 50s, when pepper was the only spice a cook owned. The edges visible under the coating were disturbingly dark. Bad signs I should have heeded.\\n\\nI tentatively cut a piece, grayish gravy glopping off the side, and popped it in my mouth. And only years of good manners kept me from spitting it out again. It was so heavily spiced that no recognizable meat flavor was discernable. The texture was mealy, dense, and obviously stuffed full of some bread filler. Hence, spiced meat cake. We ended up just scraping the gelatinous gravy off and covered it in ketchup  (good ol ketchup) and ate it as quickly as possible so we could LEAVE already. \\n\\nOh, the sides. Mashed potatoes were a dud. I am convinced that Tennessee Reds only uses the pour side of the pepper, because that was all I could taste. I ADORE mashed potatoes, so this was quite the disappointment. Mashed potatoes aren't that hard, people! The mac and cheese only had enough sauce to turn it vaguely orangey, and not nearly enough to make it moist or actually TASTE like cheese. Whee. Seriously, the cheap stuff from the blue box tastes better. Considerably. \\n\\nOur friends brisket sandwich wasn't much better. He was liberally dousing it with sauce, and looking at the dry, scraggly ends drooping out of the bun,  I could easily see why. The fries were decent, nice and crispy but not overly greasy. \\n\\nFrankly, Tennessee Reds needs to stick to being a bar.  The drink specials seemed decent, bar games and karaoke make this an enjoyable place to get drunk, maybe watch a movie on their projector. Our waitress did a great job handling us and being helpful, and is the main reason why I didn't straight up demand our money back. Go there and drink if you must. Just don't ruin your experience by ordering their bbq, unless you're too drunk to care.\\n\\nLearn from my mistakes; listen to your fellow yelpers!"},{"name":"Superica","address":"99 Krog St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I really liked this place.

The drink is fruity with Smokey and Spice notes. It has a lingering warm spice taste with hints of nutmeg and cinnamon. The best part of this drink is that it comes in an actual grapefruit. For starters we had the recommended striped bass ceviche, cucumber salad and tuna tartare. The ceviche is super bright and fresh with lots of lemon flavour and comes to the table with a masterful shrimp cracker to atop. The crispy cracker is the perfect pairing to the soft fish. The tuna tartare was also delicious and on top of a seared rice cake. It tasted like a deconstructed Spicey tuna roll. The cucumber salad was almost too pretty to eat with rolls of finely sliced cucumber sprinkled with goat cheese. The salad wasn't the highlight of the night but it's unique presentation was worth the dish. For main dishes we had the shrimp tikka and grilled octopus.

They are consistently out of the proteins and various other ingredients. Multiple times I've been told that they were out of it and had to ask \\"well how much longer will it be?\\" Generally the response is that they will go ask. Sometimes they have an answer and sometimes, like today, they just said \\"it will be a while.\\" I genuinely cannot understand how they are so consistently out of common ingredients. If there is someone checking to see what they are low on every now and then, they are not doing a good job. It is also amazing to me considering every time I've walked in there have been multiple people appearing to restock lettuces (without fail), one or maybe two people working the line, and a line out the door. With so many people restocking and so few people making salads it seems impossible that they would ever be out of anything.\\n\\nI thought I had gotten lucky today when I walked in at 12:30 and found that there was no line. I waited three or four minutes standing at the counter and noticed one or two employees nod in my direction and still not walk over. I really felt like an inconvenience for intruding on their social time, as they were standing near the cash register chatting. When I was finally served they were out of multiple ingredients. Like I mentioned above, they couldn't give me a time on when the sweet potatoes would be ready and when I pressed them on it, someone from the back said \\"I don't know. He just said it would take a long time.\\"\\n\\nI have never dealt with anyone rude once someone finally gets to the counter to serve you. The employees are generally kind, but extraordinarily lazy, or appear to be. I don't blame any single employee, but rather the work environment and expectations. No one seems to be moving quickly and honestly with no line today it should not have taken me over 14 minutes to get someone's attention and then a salad with missing ingredients.\\n\\nI so rarely write reviews to complain about service because I was in the service industry for so long I know it can be tough. But when the restaurant opened a little over an hour before, and they are out of multiple ingredients, and people very clearly do not want to serve you, I felt like I had to. Either someone is not properly stocking food prior to opening or low items are not being noted. It should not take until the chicken is gone to begin to prepare more chicken.\\n\\nA few weeks ago I was told it would be 12 minutes until they had the fish ready that goes into the OMG Omega salad. They were also out of chicken. And I had already waited in line for 20 minutes and was not waiting another 12 for fish. It should not take over 32 minutes at a fast food restaurant to receive service and your food.\\n\\nThis is not the first time it has happened and it is unfortunate that it is the only one close enough to where I live, because I have never had an issue at the one on Newbury Street. I'd love to find a nearby salad place where I don't feel like I'm in position where I walk in only to dump $12 into a salad that I'm not happy with. I have no idea who the employees are that are serving the other individuals who have written reviews on here, but I apparently seem to be unlucky every time. And I'm not kidding, I have been here over 50 times and have probably spent upwards of $1000 here since they first opened. I think I have had issue-free experiences 20% of the time, and that is generously not including the times that I've waited seven minutes for items that they are out of."},{"name":"Guangzhou Restaurant","address":"1220 Cambridge St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3","text":"Came here on a Friday for lunch and were the only ones here.

I love supporting a local business with friendly staff and delicious goods and have for 4 years. \\n\\nSo, naturally, I thought to use PP for my main wedding dessert. The manager I originally reached out to unfortunately was not the manager employed when I eventually kicked off the catering order. It was highly difficult to get in touch with the new manager to agree on a tasting date and time. When finally agreed upon, we show up to find she believed it was scheduled for the day before, so she was not there. Ok, fine, so we work with the baker to taste and go through the ordering process. I saw the baker had my email wrong, so I corrected her at the meeting to receive the invoice. I am not joking when I say it took weeks of emailing the manager and calling the business to receive the invoice, that went to said incorrect email address 3 separate times. The manager said she was dealing with personal out of office issues, which is obviously fine, but someone else in the business needs to pick up the slack in the communication department. I had no confirmation of an order / proof of invoice until way too close to the event date (less than 3 weeks). I was so worried that I reached out to my caterer to potentially make extra desserts to which they said it was too late in the process to do so. \\n\\nI set up a delivery order per my venue's request for the day of my wedding at 3:30pm. One week before my wedding at 2:00pm I received multiple voicemails from a delivery service asking where am I / the venue's closed. After frantically calling them back while away from home, the issue amounted to an incorrect order ticket being taken from the shop. Ok, so I called PP to discuss, and the baker almost had zero reaction, making it seem like it's no big deal. Ok, fine(??), I confirm we're on for the following Saturday at 3:30pm. \\n\\nI call again a few days before the wedding to super-extra confirm we were on track and they quoted a 2:00pm drop off. The venue is not open at that time and at no point did I say the words 2:00pm during our previous two delivery discussions. Again, I just don't understand the complete breakdown in communication.\\n\\nListen, I don't need to be attended to with endless, saccharine apologies, but at no point during this entire time was there any confidence instilled in their process or even simple acknowledgement that there were multiple problems along the way. We were spending hundreds of dollars! The pies ended up being the only thing I was stressed out about on my wedding day, which to me is almost comical. Were they going to make it?? \\n\\nThey did indeed arrive, we rejoiced, and the guests thoroughly enjoyed the product, but for friends that have asked whether they recommend PP for their wedding dessert, my reaction has been a resounding 'eeeehhhhhhhhhhh I don't know about that'.

Hard to believe that a bagel can make me this happy! But when it's properly prepared - hand rolled, boiled, baked and with the perfect amount of schmear - it makes me sooooo happy!\\n\\nBernstein's is the real deal. As I've stated in other reviews while on my quest for a genuine NYC bagel, a good bagel does not need to be toasted. It's crisp on the outside, chewy on the inside, and full of flavor and you can eat them, and enjoy them, fresh. Now if the bagel is all dough, then the only way to get it down is by toasting it!\\n\\nTypically I order a poppyseed bagel, my fave.  It's  classic and any great bagel shop needs to be able to master a great poppyseed bagel. My first time at Bernstein's - went there after the gym when I heard they opened a shop on N Russell - and they were already out of poppyseed. It was a Friday at 10:30am! Yes, people, their bagels are that dang good!\\n\\nDecided to be really decadent and ordered a salt bagel with the veggie spread. DIVINE. The bagel had the crispy outside, the perfect chew inside (think al dente pasta) and was filled with the perfect amount of cream cheese. Not so much that it oozes out and can adorn another bagel; not spread so thin like it was butter; just the perfect amount in every bite. Bernstein's veggie schmear had crisp cucumbers in addition to scallions and sweet peppers which gave it a very refreshing taste and crunch. Delicious. \\n\\nWhile I was waiting, I enjoyed watching them hand roll the bagels (see video I posted) and was so excited when they handed me my bagel wrapped like a little present. My intent was to eat it when I got home after my appointments, but when I got into my car I had to steal a bite, then another and then it as gone! \\n\\nLuckily, my gym is close to the N Russel Street location so no need to head to St. John's to their original shop when I am craving a taste of home. Yes, I'm from the east coast and anyone from NY, NJ and MA will tell you if they move, the top three things we usually miss, and make it a quest to find are: 1. Pizza; 2. Bagels; and 3. Real Italian Food. \\n\\nHappy to say my search for authentic NYC bagels has ended. Bernstein's are the real deal and taste just like the bagels at home.

Meh? I mean it wasn't bad but I don't see what the big deal is. The cannoli shell strongly tasted of overused and burnt oil, I understand they must make tons of these things a day but still... might be a good idea to freshen the oil at some point, especially when you can literally taste it. The filling wasn't that sweet which was nice but I won't be returning, line or no.

This is the ~10th time I've visited in the last year and it will be my last ever. \\n\\nI had a surprising interaction with the chef (or owner?) who can't seem to control himself and doesn't seem to have empathy for old people, or people in general, maybe. \\n\\nArrived before a snow storm today (starting around noon) at around 9:30am today. I brought my Grandpa, who is 93 years old, and my girlfriend. I walked in while they sat in the car. Inside I was told it'd be a 10-15 wait. I said that's fine and we waited in the car for 10 minutes then walked in. When we got in we were expecting to wait another 5-10 minutes. \\n\\nWe sat in their outdoor seating area (near the take-out window). I gave my Grandpa my coat to keep his legs warm. The waiting area has a heater but it's a piece of junk. It's about 35-40 degrees in the waiting area. Everyone waits at this place, so why not invest in a real heated area to wait? \\n\\nAfter about 15 minutes, 4 other groups were sat, so I went back in just to make sure we were on the list. I was assured by the hostess that we were next. We waited another 10 minutes. I went to the take out window, another waitress asked if I needed anything, and I politely asked if we might be able to get a cup of coffee while we waited. She said, sure, no problem. The coffee never came.\\n\\nWe waited another 10 minutes and the hostess told us it'd be just 2-3 more minutes while they cleared the table. I watched as they cleared two large tables. Then she never came to get us. At this point, after 34-50 minutes my Grandpa said he was getting cold and asked when we'd be sat. To me it looked like the hostess just got busy and forgot about us. So, my Grandpa got up and asked me to walk him in to be seated. Again, he's 93, so I had to walk him in and hold his arms (his legs fell asleep sitting outside for longer than expected), help him rotate the chair, get him seated, etc. \\n\\nAfter I got him completely seated none of the waitresses were making eye contact so I decided to walk up to the main counter. I told one of the waiters, \\"Hey, so we're seated over there, under the party of Alex on your list and the table was clear, my Grandpa is 93 and we've been outside for a while, so I just want to let you know we stole that table over there.\\" I wasn't upset at all, I was just stating the facts. Rather than understand where we were coming from, the waitress said, \\"You stole a table?\\" in a dead-serious tone, as if she were truly upset, not joking around. I repeated myself politely, saying something like, \\"Well, not \\"steal\\", I'm just saying, we took this table over here, we were next up, and I want to let you know so you can update your list.\\" and then the owner/chef interjected. \\n\\nHe starts rolling in to me, telling me that he was considering closing, that the snow is coming down, that he wasn't even sure if he was going to sit me, etc. I couldn't get a single word in with him. I kept my cool but he didn't.  I wasn't being argumentative. He keeps going on, repeating the same thing 2-3 times, about how he may be closing/etc. What I don't understand is why the hell he didn't tell us that instead of leading us on over and over in the waiting area. At one point I had to interrupt him and say, \\"Dude, look, he's 93 years old, he's an elderly gentlemen. Are you closing or what?\\" People around the restaurant started looking around.\\n\\nMy girlfriend was super pissed off and under any other circumstances I would have walked out and never visited again. \\n\\nIt's a shame the owner is such a dick and we had such a bad interaction, because he's a damn great chef.

Went for my moms birthday brunch. I pass this place every day to work and have always wanted to try. The decor is super cute. They were really nice about us just ordering drinks and a starter while we waited for one of our friends to arrive. We all ordered breakfast and when it arrived, all of our meals were cold. I've never had that happen at any restaurant. After reading some of the other reviews, it sounds like this is a common problem here. Two of us were fine with the food being room temperature, but for the other two, it was pretty disappointing to have breakfast that tastes like leftovers. I don't know if you've ever had cold potatoes, but there's a reason they're always served hot. We left a majority of our meal uneaten. The manager came over and offered to send out a free dessert, which was good for my moms birthday, but none of us really cared for a dessert for breakfast after our meal. My mom chose one and when they brought the meal they had added the $8 dessert and then took off $14 from the total, so a discount of $6 from the total bill and a free dessert. \\n\\nI'm not one to complain about food, as I work in similar style restaurants. I'm glad my moms friend said something though. I really don't think that was a fair accommodation for 4 full meals being served cold and us not eating most of it. They took an additional 25% off but it never feels nice having to ask for something to be made right. Still tipped our server 20% of the total bill without the discount as it wasn't his fault.

This is one of the worst meals that my friend and I have ever experienced. Several days later we're both still traumatized and furious. The prices are in stark inverse proportion to the portion size (miniscule) and the quality (inedible). \\n\\nBelieve the negative reviews, people. \\n\\nWhen your server (pale, chunky, receding hair) is unable to recommend even one dish and instead keeps saying that \\"everything is good,\\" run for the exit. This is always a bad sign. However, due to sheer hunger, we proceeded to order:\\n\\n- Chinese Broccoli w Crushed Chile Flake $9 (yes, the Flake is singular in the menu, casting doubt on MT's Ivy education claim) \\n- Kung Pao Brussels Sprouts $10\\n- Garlic-Chile Braised Octopus $13\\n- Shishito Peppers w Sesame Powder & Lemon $12\\n- Duck Fried Rice $23\\n\\n\\nAnd when your server declares that the Chinese Broccoli is not only spicy but also spicier than the Kung Pao Brussels sprouts, and is later called out on it when the dish proves to be neither, he should promptly apologize and replace the bland dish with one that he and MT promised. Instead, he promptly asked if we would like a side of hot sauce. Worse were the rock hard parts of the one stalk that my friend tried to eat. I didn't believe it until I tried to cut it with a knife; it was as hard as acrylic. \\n\\nThe KP Brussels Sprouts was the only remotely edible dish, but in total, there were no more than 4 whole Brussels sprouts on the plate, including all the loose leaves that were served torn apart. And there was nothing Kung Pao about the dish, neither in flavor nor in spice level. Instead, it was drowning in salt and was acidic to a tongue-curling degree. \\n\\nOur so-called Garlic-Chile Braised Octopus had no garlic, no chili taste and virtually no octopus. Reality: a salad with a few index nail size slices - both in circumference and thickness - of the octopus, lost in the paltry serving of greens, visually and gustatorily. \\n\\nTo reiterate, we were famished, and yet we couldn't finish any of our dishes. When we realized that the best items on our table were the Sambal Olek (on request) and the Saratoga bottled water, we asked our server to cancel the last two dishes. Too late. \\n\\nThe Shishito Peppers came out next, and neither of us could finish a single pepper. The sesame powder had as much taste as chalk dust, and the peppers had no flavor. \\n\\nLast, and perhaps most laughable, was the Duck Fried Rice, or rather, as per the menu, \\"Red Roast Duck Fried Rice with Seasonal Accompaniment and Crispy XO Duck Egg.\\" For real. That said, the only seasonal accompaniment evident was Chef Ming's ego. There was nothing crispy about the runny sunny side up egg. The duck pieces had a discernible duck flavor in the tsunami of super salty rice. But clumps of uncooked rice were interspersed throughout. It was impossible to get a spoonful without them. Big trophy to Chef Ming for succeeding in screwing up rice. A truly epic feat. \\n\\nNot once during our meal did our server express concern over all of our untouched dishes. And the loud music made it hard for us to converse and hear our own gagging. \\n\\nAfterward, we set off to Gourmet Dumpling House (Chinatown) as a chaser, where every dish nails the flavors and where most are less than the price of any of Blue Dragon's Dim Sum dishes. \\n\\nBut before we left Blue Dragon, we asked the hostess about the mythical Chef.

We arrived around 8:30pm (3.5hrs earlier than they close) and had to wait for a bay area on the 3rd floor to be available. In the meantime we looked over the menu to order food as soon as we got seated to streamline the process.\\n\\nOnce we got on the bay we were introduced to our server who gave us a tutorial about how to play, the rules and do's and don'ts of the game all before starting our playing time. Since there was 9 of us we asked to order our food before time started as well, but our server said he couldn't do that. That wasn't ideal, but we went with it. \\n\\nI wanted to try their mac and cheese bites and spinach dip, but both things were out. I ordered something else for a meal and actual appetizers we ordered came after our meals or at the same time. That made no sense. \\n\\nOverall the experience was okay, the food was good,  but it is pricey. You pay by hour and need a membership to play off of which is an additional $5 per person or you can play off one membership. It's an experience for sure, just a pricey one."},{"name":"Subway","address":"3695 E Cascade Rd, Ste E","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2","text":"Nice and clean store\\n A bit noisey  although its inside a Wal-Mart.

Our server was attentive but did not hover, and really understood that we wanted to take our time and not be rushed along, that is a big deal since in high traffic places like this, servers want to understandably flip tables for more money. She was great! Our drinks from the bar came in a decent amount of time and were tasty as well. Our food also came out pretty fast, I was impressed, but we may have made it in before the mad rush. The food we ordered was good and we all were satisfied. Again, this is a Cheesecake Factory - it is what it is.

It has - and is wonderful. \\n\\nLocated on Pemberton, you might drive past it and not notice it immediately - but it's worth a stop in. I've tried a number of items on the menu. I'm prone to ordering Chicken and Waffles when I see it. The waffle was tasty and fluffy - great texture. The chicken was moist and flavourful.  But the pleasant surprise was the country sausage gravy!  Wow! So good - never had anything quite like that. Mixed with Douce Hot Sauce and maple syrup, I'm still drthinking about it. My friends have ordered the Eggs Bene with Avocado (which Dawn recommends) and the Douce Double Burger (which was excellent -served on a brioche bun, with a delicious mix of zucchini and pickles). \\n\\nSave room for the shakes. I've had the Oreo cookies and cream and the Banaoffee (banana and caramel). I'd recommend either - depend on what you are in the mood for. \\n\\nTomahawk has been a staple for diners in North Vancouver.

We order two pizzas, a kid chicken fingers and a Greek salad. The Speedy Delivery promise on the flyer was beyond false advertisement. It took over an hour and twenty minutes to get our food. The \\"order taker\\" said the driver was stuck in traffic. The delivery driver said he had to wait 25 minutes for people to come and get their food and they never showed. Seriously? So our pizza was not even slightly warm and the salad was! Thankfully the crust is thin so it was manageable since we were starving. The kids meal was one piece of chicken and the fries were literally soggy. Clearly the frying oil was dirty and had not been changed in how long. Heavens knows the establishment would fail a health inspection. The Greek salad was shredded iceberg with chopped up onions, green pepper and black olives, obviously toppings for their pizzas. It cost over $59 and was not worth it at all. They flyer doesn't offer a website or an address. Shame on us for not focusing more on the facts and thinking through the decision but we had starving kids and needed food fast. I called our hotel front desk and talked to security. I told them about the situation and they said the company was not permitted on the property and they illegally place flyers on the hotel doors.

It was just like, \\"Okay what do you want to order?\\" The menu consisted of soup and salad, shared plates, bowls, sushi rolls, sashimi, noodles, bento boxes, chicken.  They had a happy hour special on certain sushi rolls and drinks from 5-7pm.  I took advantage and tried the dynamite roll and California.  The rolls were okay, but the fish in the dynamite didn't taste super fresh, and the rice wasn't the best tasting.  It was sub-par, but edible.  The edamame was slathered in salt.

Right in the restaurant row of Baldwin park sits this little gem.  It is a very nice and romantic restaurant which is a great choice for like a date night.  Now I recently went there for dinner for the first time and I had high expectations for this spot after hearing rave reviews about it.  We had ordered an array of different rolls and a chef's choice sashimi platter and each and everyone of them were super fresh!  You can really tell the quality of the fish with every bite.  The presentation was stunning, which made you really eat with ur eyes and provided that WOW factor.  Now for the cooked foods, we tried the calamari and the duck ramen.  The calamari was fried to perfection, it was super light and crispy.  The duck ramen... OMG the duck ramen was probably my favorite dish I had the whole night.  Such a great balance of rich flavors and the actual noodle itself was made in house which had really put it over the top.  I might even say that it is probably the best ramen I have had in Orlando!  I highly recommend everyone to try that ramen at least once in their lifetime.  We had finished off with a matcha cheesecake which was equally pleasing to the eye and just the right amount of sweetness to cap off the night.

The first morning I get a call from Urschel stating that 14 people's cards were declined. Really, 14? Come to find out several people (including the original 14) received emails from Whichwich stating that their order was canceled. Urschel tells me that if I don't pay for the meals right then, then he would cancel the entire delivery AND the entire delivery for the next day. He told me that 14 people were too many for him to take individual payments from so I needed to be responsible for them. Additionally, he told me that usually when the system has a problem processing payments that it will probably happen again the next day. When we finally got the food, several people got two boxes, but we didn't know at the time that Whichwich had fulfilled their orders for both days and these people would not receive their lunches for day 2. I really don't appreciate being forced to pay for food that I didn't order and I don't understand why Urschel couldn't make calls to each person who ordered food since they provided their phone number when they ordered.

The menu is short but sufficient and I had a hard time choosing between all the tasty options (though I settled for a daily special of Goat Cheese and Arugula on a Rosemary Panini).  The Gazpacho was just amazing (and a big portion for the price).  Overall actually, I would say you get a good value for your money and you get a perfect semi-quiet spot in the square to people watch and generally enjoy the atmosphere.  It can be hard to find a tasty affordable place to eat while sitting in such a cute spot in Harvard Square.\\n\\nThe Low Down: Service was polite, but a little slow.  The inside of the little cafe lacked in charm so I would stick to this during out-door dinning seasons.

It's visibly unripe and I'm sure they felt how hard it was when they diced the mango so I can't chalk it up to them not knowing about it.

You will have to share a table with strangers. Tea was brought promptly  and better than the average Chinese restaurant  brown liquid. Nothing else was brought for 20 minutes. For a huge space packed with people only  2-3 carts were in rotation, and not evenly throughout the space. We waited about 20 min between each of our food items, and often had to get up from our table and hunt it down from a cart across the room. We started doing this because we noticed the Cantonese people next to us were impatient with the wait and just got up to seek after the dim sum themselves. \\n\\nPerhaps it was because we were seated on the side, not the center of  the room. But even so it was surprising that not more carts were in circulation. After about 40 min without finding the thing he wanted (the one with peanuts, shrimp, pork, and chives), my  husband ordered from a waitress, who then went on a wild goose chase for it and brought it for us 30 minutes later.\\n\\nThe dim sum itself is not any better than what you'd find in Chinatown. \\n\\nFun place if you are patient and you like doing some amateur anthropology. You'll be surrounded by tables of Cantonese families (all 3 generations, from the silent grandmas to the parents  \\"he only makes 60k a year!!\\" and the sulking, iphone-glued children). \\n\\nDon't think you can sneak away without paying the check amid the chaos and crowds.

Trust me, i used to work in the WTC well over 7 years ago, and when i tell you nothing, there is NOTHING.... so it's nice to see the neighborhood up and coming with restaurants and a night life.  \\n\\nNow...onto the food. We got a hodgepodge of stuff...\\n\\nBraised short rib potstickers\\nHamachi Carpaccio\\nEscargot with Thai Compound Butter and Brioche Toast \\nOctopus salad\\nCrispy Pork Tail with Mango Sticky Rice\\nDan Dan noodles\\n\\nThe short rib potstickers were not too bad.. i felt it was a bit meaty..but hey, it was short ribs, so not going to complain too much.  It was pan fried so can i really complain too much?\\n\\nThe dan dan noodles were OK... i like spicy, but it was spicy and not seasoned enough, so it just made it bland and spicy.  Not a great combination.  I've definitely had better.\\n\\nThe highlights were the escargot and the octopus salad.  The escargot melded with beautiful flavors and spices and the thai compound butter and brioche toast that accompanied it..was pretty good.  The octopus salad was very citrus-y so it made it refreshing and light.  \\n\\nThe Pork tail...while decent..was too much for my liking.  There was too much fat, and not as crispy as i had hoped it to be.  \\n\\nThe last dish was the hamachi carpaccio.. which came out tasting luke warm and fishy... needless to say, we didn't finish the dish.  We advised our server.. and then finally one of the Managers stopped by and inquired with the Chef.  We got a really long-winded answer, but bottom line.. is that the hamachi was slightly seared, (which should be in response to why it was luke warm when we tasted it)...but she never addressed why it was fishy.  \\n\\nTo our dismay they still charged us.

Definitely a good amount of food for just over $10.\\n\\nEverything comes on freshly made and fried corn tortillas.  If all corn tortillas were like this, I would be ordering a lot more of them.  So much fresher, lighter and more flavorful and with a better texture than the prepackaged rubbery, bland flavored corn tortillas you get at the grocery store.  All the fish and shrimp was perfectly cooked to order, tender and was fresh.  The slaw topping and veggies were ripe and along with the lime wedge for squeezing and a fantastic homemade tartar sauce, the tacos are nicely fresh, light and flavorful.  The fries were enjoyable, and the hushpuppies were some of the best I've had and made even better when dipped in their tartar sauce.  \\n\\nThere's also a plethora of hot sauces and condiments to customize your order with and I really liked one of the jamaican sauces and the chili garlic cholula quite a bit with the fish tacos.  \\n\\nService is friendly, but it does take a tad longer than your truck to get your food as everything seems to be made fresh to order.

The Oysters Rockefeller were gross and the Southwest Mussels were extremely greasy. The Lobster Bisque tasted more like tomato soup and the 4 oz steak was severely underseasoned. All that aside, they had some excellent items. I loved their shrimp salad and cajun shrimp, the oysters were fresh, the salmon was exquisite and their batter and fried calamari was really delicious. Though I'm admittedly not a dessert person, even their flan and fried cheesecake won me over. But the absolute winners are, of course, the unlimited lobster and crab legs. I absolutely love that they teach you how to eat the lobster and the service was great from beginning to finish. We were greeted at the door by the manager Vince and were visited at our table by two managers, Vince, who checked in on us at the end of our meal, and Paul, who also passed by our table to ensure our satisfaction. It is pricy but for unlimited lobster and crab legs, $38 per person is well worth it, especially considering that a single lobster dish anywhere else will run you $30-$40 easy. Also, do NOT be ashamed to take ALL YOU CAN EAT seriously. We got there at 4 pm and left completely satisfied at 7 pm (in my defense, I struggled learning to crack open the lobsters and then realized I enjoy crab legs better which are just as much work resulting in significantly less meat, hence the 3 hr stay). Still, I'm glad to admit I pigged out and did not leave until I was completely and thoroughly stuffed and never once felt uncomfortable or rushed.

Chinese Ameicans always complain that Chinese/Chinatown style type restaurants are not nice.

As with most places that have fancier construction and furniture, the food is just mediocre, nothing special.  \\n\\nWhen I go out to eat, I realize that I'm dining out and expect the food to pop in some way.  Nothing really popped, and if anything, the flavor didn't hit the mark for dim sum.

I've eaten at dim sum restaurants all across America, and this place ranks on the low end in terms of taste.  However, this place probably takes the prize in terms of construction and d√©cor.  \\n\\nThe service was almost unacceptable in one instance.

This was completely unacceptable, and I walked up to the hostess/manager and asked for a new one.  This is America, and we have higher standards here.  The owner needs to retrain the staff to understand this fact.  So, they make a new one for us, and while we are waiting, every single kitchen staff member walks out to see who is \\"complaining.\\"  We know what's happening.  We are not stupid.  The new one comes out looking very deep fried.  I could tell that they tried leaving it longer in the fryer, but it was still cold in the middle.  The head chef needs to figure out how to successfully execute this dish so that customers don't suspect that it's just frozen food that's heated up because that's what we think. \\n\\nThe reason why I'm giving this place two stars is b/c the egg tarts and pineapple buns are decent enough.

I tried the Maya India Bar before, but this time it was phenomenal.  The lunch buffet today was only $20 and there was a good selection of food and the spice and flavor in every sauce was very good.  My favorite was the Vermicelli pudding dessert.  It is a perfect dessert for brunch, for after breakfast but right before noon-time lunch.  The Vermicelli pudding is a bread pudding.  This restaurant serves it homemade where they add a special Indian ingredient of Jaggeri for flavor.  It is Indian-fusion at its finest.  The value cannot really be compared to in the area where you can get a full dish of food with a spicy soup and Vermicelli pudding or another dessert if you so choose.  Last but not least, they have shipyard pumpkin head on tap!

It's also incredibly messy because your turning the piece over and over to try and figure out how to get at the edible parts.  There are these large black spots which are obviously cooked blood and then it just kind of grosses you out because you see bones you  normally throw away when you cut up a whole chicken.  Are they cutting up their chickens this way?  Are they purchasing non-edible chicken parts and trying to make it some sort of delicacy.

You have to be willing to go in with an open mind on ambiance. We were impressed by the five star rating on Yelp. We had read that it was a part laundry mat and part restaurant. The Google map isn't totally reliable. Tienda is located in a blue-roofed complex on Nordel and 120th - but it's facing Nordel (you can see it from the street). \\n\\nWe met the owner.  It's a family run business and we are always happy to support smaller places. We were also intrigued by \\"Salvadorian\\" food - which was effectively Central America style (similar to Mexican) fare. For our family of family we ordered two orders of Tacos (six individual tacos total), two pupusas (which I never had before - and come in groups of three), three tostadas, and two tamales.  I have to admit that I'm generally not a huge fan of tamales - but these tamales might be the best I've ever had (including trips to Mexico). The way they make the tamales seems to hold the corn flavour more. Everything was fantastic really.  Sydney enjoyed the tacos the most, Logan the tostadas.  I'd recommend getting a order of all four items to start - and then double down on what you like. Everything is worth trying. I didn't know if we would be full - but we were all good with the above order and it came out to $50. \\n\\nGreat place. Very friendly staff.  If you are looking for those mom and pop operations with fantastic, homemade, authentic eats, and you can deal with the fact that it's a part laundry mat - you should definitely try it out. \\n\\nThanks for having us and for being so accommodating on our egg and nut allergies!"},{"name":"Ray's on the River","address":"6700 Powers Ferry Rd","city":"Sandy Springs","stars":"4","text":"Today's Sunday Brunch is proof that even a 5 star restaurant can have a 3 star day.\\n\\nWe had reservations for 11:30 and were immediately seated in a spacious booth facing the river. = 5 stars. \\n\\nWe were greeted by our waiter(s) and told to help ourselves to the buffet. = 5 stars.\\n\\nOnly one person working the omelet bar with literally 10 people waiting in line.

Come and enjoy the scenery but don't waste your money on food!!!"},{"name":"Zaftigs Delicatessen - Brookline","address":"335 Harvard St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"I had a lot of misconceptions about this place, most of them positive.  The truth wasn't as glamorous as what I'd imagined.\\n\\nI imagined a more traditional quick-service place where you'd pick what you needed from a glass case or the menu behind the counter.  Instead, it was a proper sit-down restaurant with servers.\\n\\nI imagined a more authentic experience.  Instead, I got a more of a mainstream, generic restaurant experience.  The place looks like a Jewish TGI Friday's.  The reputation that Zaftigs has built for itself was what convinced me to come here.  It's got the kind of reputation that Jesus has in the South: It's blasphemous to trash Zaftigs in Brookline.\\n\\nAnd it was decent, satisfying even, in that it filled me up but it didn't enthrall.  It was like going to Dedham, Massachusetts.  Nothing wrong with the town per se, but you aren't exactly clamoring to go back and celebrate New Year's there.\\n\\nI got the pastrami sandwich on rye and the best thing that can be said about it was that there was a lot of meat on the sandwich.  That's how a pastrami sandwich should be.  But there's a few indications of freshness that set a great pastrami apart from mediocre pastrami.\\n\\nFirst, great pastrami is so fresh it's a lot more firm and chewy than it is gelatinous.  This pastrami was more gelatinous, even greasy, than it should have been.  Perfect pastrami gives way but only after using 80% of the pressure your jaws can generate.  If you can rip through it like a gator rips through a dead dog, something is wrong.\\n\\nSecond, great pastrami has a lively flavor reminiscent of black pepper.  Granted, the cook has discretion over whether to amplify black pepper overtones or let them lurk in the background, but every good pastrami I've had happens to have a bold black pepper taste.  Correlation doesn't necessarily mean causation but it does help indicate what to expect.\\n\\nMy buddy got the potato latkes.\\n\\nI didn't have a chance to taste these so all I had to go by was his lukewarm reaction to it.  He said they weren't bad, \\"decent.\\"  I took this to mean that he was giving his meal three stars.  I might have asked for a taste but there was one glaring giveaway that suggested the latkes weren't worth it.\\n\\nThey had a ton of bacon bits and melted cheese on top.  Bacon.  I guess Zaftigs is run by loosey goosey Jews.\\n\\nAny amateur cook, shit, anyone with a pulse, knows that these are two of the biggest culinary cheats in a chef's arsenal, aside from butter.  When someone uses these ingredients as liberally as Zaftigs did, they're hiding something, most likely a lack of flavor.  This baffled me.  Potato latkes are, by their very nature, crisp and delicious without help, assuming that they're prepared the right way.\\n\\nIt reminded me of when my dad used to dress me in short pants at the age of fifteen to try to convince people I was under twelve so he could get fifty cents off on rides.  I had wispy hair on my upper lip and I sounded like Scooby Doo. He wasn't fooling anyone and neither was Zaftigs.\\n\\nLatkes are delicious if done right.  I'm not sure what kind of fraud is being perpetrated in Zaftigs kitchen but I'd stay away from them.  Or try making them at home.  A potato pancake is easy to make and worth it.  Pastrami is harder to pull off at home but I'd go elsewhere for that.  Mamaleh's in Kendall Square does a mean pastrami.  Go there instead.\\n\\nHaving said all this, our server at Zaftigs was energetic, friendly, and efficient.  She had to be; the place was packed and there was already a line forming at the door when we finished.  Like everyone else has already noted, go early, especially on weekends.  You might have to stand in line no matter what but your wait time might be shorter if you show up early.  \\n\\nI wouldn't know; I was lucky enough to walk in and score a table for two without waiting.  I have a feeling that doesn't happen often, though.  Maybe it's because I look Israeli?  From some angles, I look like the authentic Christ: Tanned, Middle Eastern features, bearded, calm expression, reeking of wine.\\n\\nI'm just speculating, but it's fun to think about."},{"name":"Sweet Caroline's Snow Shack","address":"13497 Hwy 183 N","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"It's been a while since I've had a snow cone this good.

That bumps the place up to 3.5 stars.  The food needs a little work.\\n\\nPlush couches in restaurants always remind me of my high school proms. The school and our parents would chip in to rent out a whole floor on a hotel and promise to turn a blind eye.  \\n\\nAnd, for once, those cock-blocking, finger-wagging motherfuckers actually kept their promises. All they wanted in return was to let them know if our plans changed. They wouldn't even ask what happened on prom night as long as we returned home the next day without a police escort.  \\n\\nIt was a fair trade given that they were usually further up our asses than a sigmoidoscope during the rest of the school year.\\n\\nThe hotels would have VIP sections with couches like the Living Room's. After dinner and dancing, we'd retreat to these rooms and try our best to end each others' dreams via rubberless hanky panky.  \\n\\nFlex duct work minus insulation. Riding without a saddle. Catch my drift?\\n\\nThat's why couches always give me the strangest tingle below the waist. On the one hand, I'm not that guy anymore and I'm in a stable relationship. On the other hand, it's hard to forget sharing a couch with two other couples.\\n\\nBut at the end of the day, I rate a place mainly for its food, not furniture that causes weird boners. If a shady dude was serving seizure-inducingly good food out of a cardboard box in an alley, I'd pull up a dead cat to sit on and join him.\\n\\nTo be fair to the Living Room, I probably didn't order right.  I got the momos, a Tibetan dumpling, for brunch.\\n\\nYou can trash me after you hear me out. If a brunch place with classics like chicken and waffles has momos on its menu, then the chef probably feels confident enough about his ability to make the dish that it's worth having.\\n\\nThat doesn't guarantee that it'll be good, though. The momos were decent but the meat could have used a lot more garlic, ginger, and heat.  This isn't a hard fix. Just grate more of each ingredient into the ground meat before working it over with the stand mixer. Steaming tends to subdue strong flavors so I wouldn't worry about upsetting the traditional brunch crowd with a punch of powerful Asian flavor.\\n\\nEspecially because people who order momos know what they're all about and are actually hoping for the gustatory equivalent of Bruce Lee's straight blast.\\n\\nI would also cook the momos a little longer. The dough was plasticky, especially towards the edges. It's an art to keep the filling firm and the dough pliable but firm, so I can't be too hard on the chef. They were not bad at all, especially when dipped into the four sauces they came with.\\n\\nOne was a green sauce like chimichurri, one was a tangy, tomato-based sauce, the third one was a soy-based sauce, and I can't remember what the fourth one was. The tomato and green sauces were the best.  I'd throw in a little more salt into them. Actually, I'd throw a little salt into the momo filling too.\\n\\nMiss K ordered the breakfast flatbread, a half-a-naan sized flatbread topped with mozzarella cheese on marinara sauce, portobello mushrooms, scrambled eggs, and a ton of spinach.  If Popeye were to invent a flatbread, this would be it.  It was vegetarian, if you don't count eggs, but packed with nutrients.\\n\\nI had a taste and it was surprisingly decent. Despite all the healthiness on it, it didn't sacrifice flavor. Meatless flatbreads aren't my thing but adjusting for that, it's something I would consider ordering again.  \\n\\nBut, like the momos, it could have used a little sparkle. I would dress the spinach in a balsamic vinaigrette or drizzle it with a homemade dressing. This keeps the freshness of the vegetable alive and adds tang to the entire bite.  \\n\\nYou aren't always going to taste the tang of a marinara when there's a bunch of toppings on it, so a vinaigrette would rejuvenate the top floors of this building perfectly. Flatbreads should be treated like my high school prom: Bring the party to every corner of every floor.\\n\\nEveryone else seemed to enjoy their food and drink and they weren't just saying it because I was the meetup host. Which reminds me . . . overall, the staff did a decent job dealing with our meetup of ten, especially considering that there was another group of ten right next to us.\\n\\nThe only complaint I had was that our hostess gave us the dinner menu and it took her about fifteen minutes to realize it. Some in our party thought that the servers gave us too much time with the menus, but I decided not to hold this against the staff.  \\n\\nThey were vigilant enough that I knew they hadn't forgotten about us. They were just giving us plenty of time to peruse the menu. There's a difference between that and being lazy.\\n\\nMy benefit of the doubt was vindicated after we ordered.

This is more a 2 1/2 star review.  Bought a Groupon after seeing it advertised over many weeks.  Read some of the reviews and decided to give it a try.  First impression, there was only one table occupied on a Saturday night, not a good sign.  They really needed to have music, it was dead silent in there, besides the conversation between my family.  Went to use the bathroom, there was no soap and no paper towels.  The food was decent, but portions were small for the prices.  I'm a \\"big portions\\" kinda gal!  The flavors were there, but not great or memorable that would make me want to return.  Ordered chicken wings, they were good.  The beef salad was quite salty and the lettuce was not cut up, but were given leaves of lettuce instead, messy to eat and tear apart.  The stir fry and noodle dish were fine.  Yellow curry was watery like a broth, should have been thicker.  As I went up to pay, I was amazed by the number of tablets with labels of food delivery places.  It was like a shrine of tablets!

For the price I would have expected a little more food or keep the small portions but reduce price (we liked the sizes just little overpriced). The puff pastries were very savory and yummy!  The risotto was not consistent with risotto and more like rice with gravy, flavor good but not enough lobster for price. The scallops were good but a little on well done side instead of Seared with medium temp. We then finished with the foie gras and beef tenderloins.

The description sounds pretty simple for an item that's $12, but it was a great appetizer. The rillette was full of chunky salmon and the creamy mayo complemented the smoked flavor very well. The capers added a slight salty taste, which was well paired with the crackers. We were given 15 crackers, which were well enough. These were great as leftovers as well.\\n\\nEggs Benedict- The dish includes two eggs benedicts on top of canadian bacon and a side of roasted herb red potatoes. The hollandaise sauce was creamy and had a hint of tart taste, which is what I like since it can be heavy on the butter. The highlight were the roasted potatoes, which had a crispy edged exterior and o-so-fluffy interior. It was covered in melted herbed butter and was mouth watering for every bite.\\n\\nSmoked Salmon Scramble- This was an omelet scramble with smoked salmon and cream cheese.

Plus, they used to be heavier on the green chile (now the red is more prominent) and though spicy, made these burritos so unique. And the black beans have diminished. It's still a good burrito, but there are lots of good burritos around. It used to be stellar.\\n\\nWe finally tried the brunch menu. Great option, easy to just walk in on a Saturday, but check ahead for a Sunday. We came late enough in the morning to eat a big meal for lunch which was good because we wanted to try a lot. The salmon tostada was a standout, incredible flavor and texture to the cured salmon, but definitely order an \\"add\\" of avocado. It balanced it just right and probably should be part of the selection. I couldn't imagine it without it.  The blue corn pancakes (huge portion) were the perfect texture, the specialty maple syrup, citrus butter and toasted pinons a tasty balance. Get a side of bacon, beautifully cooked. I love blue corn grits so I had to taste these too, good, but wrong with the other items. Get them to balance something else. The sides added quite a bit to the total meal price.\\n\\nFor happy hour and dinners, I still enjoy the food and service, though there have been a few inconsistencies. Some faves have changed or disappeared. I still love the Blue Corn rellenos. And the little tacos. And the queso.  Do not miss the Frito Pie at Happy Hour. I loved the original version of the bizcochitos, which were tiny and crispy but the last time I had them, large and heavy. But there is always a dessert I like. My husband still always orders the pi√±on tart. And really, those of you \\"noise conscious\\" people, they have really improved that situation. You can have a conversation. Staffing seems to change quite a bit and I sort of get tired of servers asking if it's our first time. I've been a lot and will continue. I don't know how to make that fair though, because I guess there are still a lot of first timers. So I try to be patient. It's so nice to have this style restaurant in this location."},{"name":"Punjabi Dhaba","address":"225 Hampshire St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"great service and food is cheap! worth it."},{"name":"Boston Lobster Feast","address":"8731 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"Went there twice, the first time was perfect.

We went to the public opening this evening with the intent to have drinks and small plates rather early. Yes there was a line outside  before they even opened. From a young couple with a 2 month old baby to gray hairs like me. From trendy dressed professionals to people straight from work in customer service. We threw away our original plan as soon as we saw the duck breast entree and I asked a few questions of our server and she mentioned that it was Hosea cooking it. I know that duck from the first year at Blackbelly and have always wished for it to come back. It did, but over here at Santo. \\n\\nWe did start with the guacamole and the queso fundido and they were both exemplars of these standard appetizers. The queso top was sprinkled with toasted pipitas with a dollop of red pepper jelly in the center. Not too spicy, not bland. Instead of the earlier planned items we jumped at the duck breast which came with a good sized portion of sweet potato puree and excellent, flavorful brussels sprouts. We also shared the smoked corn soup which was quite interesting and made for a soup person like my husband. I loved that it was not dairy based but actually a puree of corn with a great body and flavorings.\\n\\nWe did have to try dessert and though we  went in thinking, just one, shared, we had to have two. Our flavor preferences are so different, especially in sweets, that there was no compromising here. He had the pine nut tart and I had the trio of drinking chocolate tasters, each flavor accompanied by a little flaky cookie, vaguely in the biscotti category but so much more delicate. Each complemented the chocolates in spiciness, from the lightly flavored top, maybe lime sugar? through savory pine nut to spicy ground chile.  \\n\\nWe did have drinks also, a beer for my husband and a paloma for me. Both were very good and just what we wanted.\\n\\nAs usual with Hosea's places, from the Blackbelly dining room to the Market sandwich lunches to Santo, good staffing is key and we had no complaints. They clearly look for a certain personality to go with good training and its noticeable. And the bar seemed to be an instant success, given the hour. Packed, standing 2 deep behind the seated. The place is very sparkly.\\n\\nSo lots of congratulations to all involved, this one should be a stunning success too. I love that it's only half the distance from my house as Blackbelly. But make reservations folks, walking in after tonight won't be easy. And note that they will be closed tomorrow (Sun, Nov 19) rather than open for walk-ins at 4pm as originally announced by local media, given the effort put forth this week to get open and do the pre-opening events and the breather needed by all, I'm sure. And I will just have to fit Santo into my schedule without losing sight of Blackbelly as they are quite different. \\n\\nOh!

For $19 you get a whole chicken, a salad and a side of regular french fries. In my experience, a whole chicken plus a choice of¬†2 large sides (like rice, beans, yuca fries, plantain) is usually around $16. Having zero interest in a weak iceberg salad, we opted for the \\"whole chicken only\\" at $12 plus a $4.50 side of yuca fries, which are the traditional side for pollo a la brasa. The chicken was a pretty standard size, but for $4.50, I expected a reasonable serving of yuca. Instead, we got a tiny styrofoam sandwich box, which wasn't even full with 5-6 fry chunks. They were crisp, and well cooked, but hardly worth the cost.\\n\\nThe chicken was well enough executed, and roasted in a wood-fired oven, with brown, adequately crisp skin, but it lacked spice and seasoning. They were there, but not in a quantity to provide the dish's characteristic flavors.\\n\\nEl Inka's sauces also missed the mark, which is a real shame, since a good aji can easily fix a broken pollo. Their sauce offerings included a standard yellowish mayo, a diced herb mayo variant, a mild green lettuce/herb sauce, and what I'm sure was an off-brand sriracha. I would have loved to see a spicy jalape√±o sauce (like they have at the famous El Pollo Rico) instead, because every pollereia should pack a punch of some kind.\\n\\nOverall, the meal itself was acceptable, but for the price, I will keep looking."},{"name":"Lao Cai Dining & Entertainment","address":"130-1425 Marine Dr","city":"West Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"Spicy old noodles with a heavy hand serving of garlic!!!

I was so excited to try this restaurant but then scared to death after looking over a few reviews. I prepared for the worst and was pleasantly overwhelmingly surprised! First of all I heard about this spot via Travelzoo, props and thanks to them.  They happened to have stellar reviews as did OpenTable and Google... that helped calm my nerves. \\n\\nWe had reservations for 8:30pm on a Tuesday night, but still had to wait an hour to be seated. No worries, we sauntered over to the bar and grabbed a drink. Their drinks are very reasonably priced unlike like other swanky places who shall remain nameless. Average is $10-20. Lots of options in the $10 range and beers are cheap too (can't stress how many Atlanta places love to upcharge it all).  I got their Moscow Mule ($8),  this drink is not hard to make but very few places get it just right. Nikolai's roof did not disappoint. It was great to sit and chat, and enjoy the city views around us at the bar. We decided we'll return to the bar in the future, it's a great place to bring friends and start the night without going broke. \\n\\nWhen we sat I noticed the low lighting and elegant decor. Another reviewer called it cheesy, it reminded me of the old guard. Not afraid to use light colors, and gold detail. This place is French-Russian fusion, very apparent in the baroque but slightly modern decor. \\n\\nWe opted for a 4 course meal. Started with the Piroshki, oh my  it was good. This is a small bite of heaven wrapped in delicate filo dough. Next I got the Salmon which came with a salt cured piece with berry sauce  and a raw piece with soy sauce. Loved the fusion of flavors. My date got the scallops, they came out huge and topped with a flat cheese crust (delicious). I ordered the tenderloin medium-rare, I was glad I did. It was perfectly cooked and melted in my mouth. Just the way high end steaks should be. I always get medium-well except at fine dining spots, they know how to properly cook a fine piece of meat. Nikolai's was not exception. My date got the fish, it was grilled and came with veggies. It wasn't bad but I'd say my steak was best. \\n\\nFor dessert my date got the  bread pudding which wasn't the best I got the souffle and it was amazing! Perfectly fluffy,like a cream puff but thicker like a sponge cake. Inside they added a cream that knocked my socks off. I literally licked it clean (with poise of course). We also had a cheesecake of sorts given to us since it was a special occasion, it was just ok. The souffle is the winner of the night. \\n\\nWe had wine with or meal, I have to say the Bordeaux we ordered was perfectly paired with our entrees. \\n\\nOur waiter was very courteous and apologized profusely for the wait. Right away we knew this place was like any European joint. You ever been to the Intermezzo? TAKE YOUR TIME and don't be in a rush. There was a good 15-20 min lull inbetween entrees which we quite enjoyed through wine and conversation. It took time to get our tab too, no surprise. Reminded me of Europe in every way, why rush for anything?  We were there for about 2-3 hour and it was splendid in every way. \\n\\nYes we will return, it's the perfect spot for a fancy shmancy meal and putting on your finest.\\n\\nParking: We did the self parking but they validated it and made it free!"},{"name":"Happy Dragon Chinese Cafeteria","address":"2440 Wesley Chapel Rd","city":"Decatur","stars":"3","text":"We've been going to Happy dragon for several years, probably at least 10 years, never disappointed with their food or service, contrary to some othet reviews I've read.  we never had an issue with pricing or money and they're always timely with your order. \\n\\nSuggestions:  Braised wings, sesame chicken, beef & broccoli with white rice or shrimp love mein.

These are decent, average hotels.  I needed to book a four day stay in Boulder and could not find a room anywhere but the Millennium Harvest.  I had never stayed at a Millennium hotel and was unfamiliar.  Millennium's website presents itself as a higher-end hotel and the price (much more than a typical Hampton) seemed commensurate with that presentation.  I dug deeper into the wallet, looking forward to a special stay.  It has been special all right, just not in a good way!\\n\\nI booked on Millennium's website.  When I finished, I immediately received TWO confirmation emails (with different confirmation numbers).  Lest my card be charged twice, I called Millennium's Customer Service number.  A thick-accented representative confirmed the double book and said that my card had been charged twice.  Further, because my reservation was a non-refundable pre-pay, she could not refund my nearly $1,000 duplicate billing.  With my protest, she stated that my only recourse was to call Accounting, when they were open, and request the refund.  The next day I called, and as far as I know - at least I hope, my refund happened.\\n\\nArriving here a few days ago, I was quickly surprised upon seeing the large, but very dated building, tired surroundings, facing the dumpster end of a strip center.  Check in went OK, but as we moved through common areas, the word (dump) began pinging my mind.  With the exception of the rather nice, and recently renovated bathroom, the room continued with the \\"dump\\" mantra.  Wrestling the 1950's era slider open, I stepped on the porch, and I was clearly in a 1950's hotel.  I will say, however, that the grounds behind the hotel (except for the algae plagued water feature) were quite nice.\\n\\nIt gets worse, unfortunately.  Beside the very, very dated furnishings, our king mattress, though in good shape, was too firm.  Turning down the bed, the fitted sheet flipped off the corners and could not be put back on.  Further investigation revealed that this was a Queen sized sheet trying to hang on to a King sized mattress.  But where things really get bad is that without a doubt, this is by far the noisiest hotel I have ever stayed in!  The walls are paper thin and every door slams as though someone flung it as hard as they could.  The building structure seems to conduct and resonate sound so much that you can hear slamming doors from up and down the hall, and even between floors!  And then, housekeeping staff roll onto your floor bright and early and seem to take great pleasure in slamming, and banging, and yelling one to another.  Day after day, night after night, it was this way.  I cannot wait to leave here, so that I might get some sleep.\\n\\nThere's more, like the blood on our sheet, or my razor that the housekeeper apparently knocked off the bathroom counter.  They were nice enough to place the various broken pieces back on the counter for me.  Or, the shower faucet handle falling off in my hand, and on, and on, and on.\\n\\nIf this was an $80/night Motel 6, I would expect all this.  But the way that Millennium touts itself as something special, and the nearly $250/night room charge, I must say that this has been a solid 1-star facility.  Oh, did I mention that there is no free internet, wired or wireless?  Only wireless is available and at a cost of $9.95 per day!  Adding insult to injury, it did not work, at least without a 10 minute call to their tech support people.\\n\\nI will never stay at another Millennium Hotel!"},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Our UBER driver said he wasn't impressed.... we think he was 100% wrong.

The food was just bland...crawfish was tasteless, lobster meat was not fresh and nothing was cleaned--okay, I get they're a buffet and it's all about the quantity, but at least put some seasoning or have more sauces available. \\n4. All the fried foods were overfried and I don't know how many times they've reused the oil but nothing was good, not even fried clams/scallops/chicken! \\n5. Oysters were not fresh. The only thing that was okay was the stone crab so I got full eating stone crab (finally I was able to justify the $50) \\n6. Desserts were too buttery and even the ice cream sucked. I was there for 1.5 hrs and they never refilled the cookies and cream. Chocolate was way too sweet and lemon sorbet was too sour. \\n7. The bill came and of course we didn't get the early bird special even though we came before 6 but we waited 20 mins in line and by the time we paid it was 7:30 ish.

After placing it, I called the restaurant to make sure that the substitution for brown rice instead of jasmine rice was clear. They assured me it was, and that my order would be ready in 10 mins. When I arrived, I checked in at the front desk. The gal who assisted me was unfriendly towards me. After she came back from the kitchen, she verified the name on the order and gave it to me without another word spoken. There was no smile, no thank you for ordering with us. Nothing. I left feeling very uncomfortable about the exchange. When I got home, I immediately open the bag, took out the curry container and rice box. I was hungry and looking forward to a nice bowl of curry and rice. When I opened the rice box, the contents were wrapped in foil. I thought, 'well that's a first'. I unwrapped the foil to find the contents (rice is what I was hoping). It was brown rice, yes. But it was a very tiny amount which took up 1/3 of the box it came in. The rice was luke-warm and untidy. I examined it for a minute. It suddenly dawned on me that this rice looked to have already been served once. Was I about to consume someone else's leftover brown rice? I was shocked! Could not believe my luck! I had to through it out. I threw out the curry mix as well for fear that it too was leftovers from a previous customer! Such a let down.

This place was the only place my husband kept talking about during our trip.  We were lucky that we went for breakfast on a weekday.  I can only imagine how crazy it could get otherwise.  \\nI don't think there was a dish that anyone disliked.  There was something different about the French Toast that I have not had anywhere else...it's like they coat it in something crunchy (maybe a cereal???), but as most people say, it is very good.  I decided to get two half portions of different things so that I could try more, for about the same price as getting one full breakfast entree.  I think that's actually a good way to go, especially if you have little kids.  A half portion is really enough to make a \\"regular\\" appetite satisfied, especially if you are ordering something really hearty.\\n\\n I got the biscuit and gravy and breakfast nachos.  I've never been big on biscuit and gravy, but my oh my, Mother's has made me a fan!   I've had biscuit and gravy before, but this is the first time I actually felt all warm and mushy inside from eating it.  It was rich, savory, I can definitely see why it is considered comfort food. \\n\\nMy husband literally said it was one of the best breakfast places he has been to.\\n----------------\\nSo we ended up coming back a week later for dinner. Let me just start by saying stay away from the $15000 crab cake entree. My hubby being a crab lover went for it, feeling heartened by the $15,000 in the name, I mean, it had to be good, right? Wrong.  Out of everything we ordered (Linguine with meatballs, Five hour braised pot roast, chicken and dumplings) the Chicken and dumplings were probably the best, followed by the pot roast.  Dinner was definitely not as satisfying as breakfast, so with that said, Mother's is def a good choice for breakfast/brunch. I would not recommend it for dinner.

I have been suggesting Ray's for awhile now because I've never been.

Unfortunately, this is where our good service ended. \\n\\nWe were seated with a decent view of the Chattahoochee river, although we were a little close to other tables. At least this gave me an opportunity to see what others had ordered, which influenced my own decision. One server came by to fill our water glasses up and I asked for a couple of lemons, which never came. Not the end of the world, but odd for a restaurant like this. A few minutes later, another server came by and asked if anyone had gone over the specials with us. Okay? I didn't expect that this meal would be tag-teamed by multiple servers, but whatever. I can only assume that we had a server for drinks and a server to take food orders. However, I saw so little of both of them that I can't confirm that theory. Our appetizers came out quickly and then were checked on by the same two servers, who left our dirty dishes on the table until another server finally came around to pick them up. I had to ask twice for a second glass of wine, which was becoming unacceptable. \\n\\nOnce our food came, we dug in - everything was very good. I had the Parmesan crusted scallops and my husband had the ribeye. Everything was cooked perfectly and was very tasty. However, no one came by to see how our food was or if we needed anything. In fact, we didn't see a server again until well after our meal, and even then, we had to flag him down to ask for a dessert menu. \\n\\nOverall, when we pay upwards of $200 for a meal, I expect service to be top notch.

Honestly, I would have preferred a little more broth and a little less \\"stuff\\". I'm probably a rarity here. \\n\\nThe chipped liver was texturally good, but lacked flavor. Perhaps more onions in the mix might have helped. But the real crime was dry, barely room temperature pastrami.  The Reuben looked underfed as well. Very little sauerkraut with the corned beef.

It is most definitely delicious, but truly, it is a cup of mashed potatoes with some beef inside and some shredded parmesan on top. Nothing too special, but still delicious. The house salad is decent, and they serve it with olive oil and balsamic vinaigrette. \\n\\n-The only thing that is stopping me from giving this place a 5 star is the fact that our waitress asked us if we want the rice and beans before the meal or during the meal. She explained to us that rice and beans are part of the brazilian staple and wants to know when we would like to have it (my sister is married to a brazilian so i knew that rice and beans are like bread and butter to americans). Everything went fine until we received the check and realized that the rice and beans are 4 BUCKS EACH. The rice is a small bowl of jasmine rice garnished with chives and a small bowl of regular black beans. I was like WTF? i have never ever stiffed a waitress before but i came close in doing so.  I used to wait on tables and i knew that she was trying to up sell and the only she can do so is for her to swindle customers into paying an extra 8 bucks for a small portion of rice and beans.

When I arrived, my friends were already there and had a pretty good table, right in the centre, and when you come in, you see this place has a good wooden look to it, a serious bar \\"you are gonna drink here\\" type of look that already has its hands on your wallet even before you have uttered a word to spend money and down the hatch on alcohol.\\n\\nI had their special 'Japanese Old Fashioned' here, and sure it came out to like $26 but was pretty good, as they have to prepare this you get a choice of a small chaser of beer or wine before your drink actually comes out. I had a few other drinks on this night and looking at what the others in my party had, this place knows that presentation is also key, as every drink came in a different type of glass to compliment the drink, from the glass to the color to the end taste there is something to say about a place that is confident serving you drinks at these prices, cause they know they can, and they know that people will come when people want a good experience with a good drink.\\n\\nThis is definitely not a place for slamming back drinks before heading to the club, this place is more of you having the night here and this is the last plan, or the second last plan. Whether you are enjoying the decor... as I helped a few girls take pictures in the hallway going to the washroom as they thought the lighting and the brick wall, as I said you will enjoy the decor that you are in. You will probably have more than one drink here, and probably another good one depending on how you got here (drink responsibly everyone!).\\n\\nWell, come to think about it, I was here slamming down drinks as the party I was with decided to call some shots, round after round, and being here for a few hours it is definitely a different type of vibe, and one that is a happening place, the bill.... let's just say it was a good one but everyone was happy, the service was super attentive for our orders, asked us constantly if everything is going good, also had to move us cause our party ended up getting bigger by a few members.\\n\\nIf you are in Gastown and need a higher end place to drink, definitely think of this place, it is not for the budget friendly, but if you want quality liquor you won't go wrong here, as for the food... who knows, all I know is this is a great place to drink."},{"name":"Austin's Pizza South Lamar","address":"1817 S Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"Okay, I ordered some oh-so-yummy pizza rolls the other night and had to come Yelp them some props.

I received two dry sliders with little to no toppings or flavors of any kind and a huge plate of fries. The menu did not say it was sliders - it said Bison Burger - what I received was a plate of fries with a side of two small sliders. The sliders were literally less flavorful than fast food. Each contained a dry small piece of meat, with two small fried onions on them. All the while, this meal cost like 17 dollars. I should have went to McDonalds and would have had a better meal for much much less money.

Feels like you're in a real cellar sort of room repurposed to be a restaurant.\\n\\nThe service was great! Our server was helpful, prompt, and pleasant. Even though she had plenty of tables, we felt well taken care of the entire time.\\n\\nBut most importantly... the food. Note: my wife and I split single orders of all of the items and it was still a ton of food.\\nTo start, the pretzel bread was unreal!\\nWe both got Moosehead beers, which was something we had tried on our honeymoon in Whistler, Canada. It's a fine beer. Not my favorite, but definitely not bad (I've grown to enjoy hoppier beers since our honeymoon). I would probably get one of their cocktails or a glass of wine on another visit.\\nWe got a starter of the Cheddar Cheese Soup, which was delicious. We even saved some of the pretzel bread to dip in it, which I would recommend.\\nThen we had some Signature Poutine. I've thought this for a long time, but poutine is something that we in the US need to get on board with a bit more. Canada has been doing poutine for a long time and for some reason, we in the states aren't catching on that it's amazing. I digress. The poutine was delicious. This was one of the things we were most excited for and it did not disappoint.\\nThen we got the filet with a side of the Maple Whiskey Brussels Sprouts. Lord have mercy. The Brussels Sprouts were to die for. The steak was well prepared, and the risotto it came with was so good.\\nFor dessert (most important meal of the day), we got the Maple Cr√®me Br√ªl√©e and the Warm Pecan Brown-Butter Tart. Both were good. We would probably pick just one or the other next time around since we were pretty stuffed by this point. But we felt like we had to try them both. Definitely not the best dessert in the park, but definitely worth getting if you're at Le Cellier.\\n\\nOk, so Le Cellier is expensive, there's no getting around that. This was our most expensive meal of our week long trip in Disney World. I can get a little stressed about money when I'm spending a lot, but this meal was worth every penny and was good enough that I had no regrets spending as much as we did. Expect to spend close to $100/adult with drinks, apps, entree, and dessert in the mix and you'll be alright. Sure, you could manage to do it for less, but don't cheat yourself of all the great offerings they have. Either be ready to splurge or skip it altogether.\\n\\nI 100% recommend this place.

Menu is pretty eclectic with an Asian twist, and a focus on seafood with raw bar options. \\n\\nAs it is a tapas restaurant, portions are small. For a party of 8, we got double of most dishes. Dishes come out one by one, which drags out dinner so hopefully you're not in a rush! \\n\\nWe found the service to be subpar. As they were bringing a new dish, they would take away our other plates even though we were not completely finished. As a foodie, every bite counts, even one last small bite! This happened twice so it felt like a race to finish our dishes, which became an ongoing joke at the table. We wish they had asked before they would take away our plates. They also forgot one of our dishes which we had to remind them as they were passing out the dessert menu. And lastly, there was a swap in our waitress but was not informed. It would have been nice to be informed that she was leaving and was getting a new waitress as we waited around to flag her down only to find out she had left. \\n\\nAnd to the important stuff, the food. \\n\\nMust haves: \\n-Foie Gras- amazing, one of our favorites. It is seared perfectly and served over toast and quince (a sweet fruit) which pairs well together. \\n-Octopus- Also delicious. Big and juicy and filled with flavor.

Especially with the coconut sauce, couldn't get enough! \\n-Sea bass- Amazing! Tender, flavorful. \\n\\nRunner ups: \\n-Vietnamese Bologna- refreshing and good, especially if you love vietnamese food.

We were hungry for a between meal snack, and had heard of Mike's so we thought we would give it a try. \\n     The store was crowded with people, with people just stepping up to the counters at random to place their orders.   My first impression is that the place has a vintage feel, loud and chaotic, and not any too clean.  The handful of tables near the windows were not clean, and neither was the floor.   The glass cases were filled with a variety of baked goods.  Hubby and I decided to go with what seemed to be the most popular item, the cannoli.  The woman at the counter was efficient, but was not necessarily friendly or pleasant.  Just got the job done.   We were told \\"cash only\\" like we should have known that ahead of time.  Sorry, but we didn't see that posted anywhere at the entrance or in the store...but then who could really notice much with all of the chaos? \\n     Hubby chose a traditional cannoli with pistachios. I decided to try a caramel creme.  Both were fine, but we didn't see a reason for all the hype.  The shells seemed way too thick and heavy to me, and I could taste the frying oil.  The filling was also heavy, thick, and grainy on the tongue.   I have definitely had better, with light crispy shells and soft, slightly sweetened fillings, but I am sure there are probably worse than Mike's out there too. \\n    Meh...If we knew then what we know now, we would have skipped Mike's and sought out a small pastry shop where they care more about quality than quantity....and also where we could sit at a table to savor our desserts in a cleaner, quieter atmosphere."},{"name":"Vespaio Ristorante","address":"1610 S Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"This is my personal favorite restaurant in Austin.

I was working out while in Avalon Park and I came across this business. I was reluctant because this spot has been, in the past, two-three different Puerto Rican restaurants that were known for not being great. Bummer! \\n\\nEither way, looked them up on Yelp and was pleasantly surprised with their awesome reviews!  So one evening, while insanely hungry and not drenched in sweat after a workout, I decided to check them out and I was surprised again when I came in and saw a \\"cafeteria style\\" business with some items made to order. Meaning, no wait time!!  *unless you order mofongo or tostones*\\n\\nSo this is how it works! Most items you can buy individually or order them separately; however, the real fun is in getting a tasty meal at a low price. They have their lunch special ($7.95) which is available Monday through Sunday from 11am-4pm and their dinner special ($9.95) available Monday through Sunday from 4pm to closing time. Additionally, they have the kids' meal ($5.50) which consists of rice and beans and a drink; only for kids 11years and under.\\n\\nNow, the Lunch and Dinner special consists of selecting your choice of protein (pork, stewed chicken, beef stew, pork ribs or their special of the day) and selecting any two sides (rice and beans *counting as one*, vegetables, cassava (a.k.a. yuca), sweet plantains and boiled green bananas). However, you can also select tostones, french fries or mofongo which are made at the moment for an additional charge.\\n\\nSo, those who know me KNOW I'm a picky eater... *\\"What!? Michelle, get out of here, you're a Yelper!!\\"*  I know, I know... I'm a weirdo, but I'm ok with it, so chill!  Anyway, this is important info since I don't eat red meat or pork. I lie, I actually eat pernil (pork), maybe, about once a year, during Christmas, as it's one of Puerto Rican's favorite entr√©es to eat during the Holidays.  I digress...\\n\\n \\n\\nSo I got the pernil (couldn't help it, since the scnet was seducing me with its seasoned goodness), with the fried rice (which has, even more pernil, eggs, corn and more), \\"maduros\\" (sweet fried plantain) and placed an order of mofongo for my significant other and me to share.\\n\\nFood was fresh, (hot, but not too hot), was packed with just the right amount Puerto Rican seasoning and tasted great.  Mofongo was the best I've ever had!  Seriously! I have my top three places to eat Mofongo (one Cuban style and the other two Puerto Rican style) and this one just made it to the number one place to eat Puerto Rican mofongo in Orlando. This mofongo is perfectly seasoned, perfectly fried and still moist with no need for \\"caldo\\" (chicken broth). *Those who know mofongo know that some of them are so dry that they need some \\"caldo\\" on the side to make it easier to swallow *errr, that sounds weird*.\\n\\nNeedless to say that I looked like a pernil myself as I walked out of the restaurant will a full stomach and a huge grin of accomplishment!  No shame!\\n\\nAll in all, a variety of Puerto Rican food with fair prices in  Avalon Park was just what the area needed!  Finally, a Puerto Rican business that is a hit in Avalon Park!

It's so incredibly landscaped/decorated....even when it's hot as balls outside, you somehow still manage to forget about the bat wings and just enjoy yourself, hahahaha! \\nOne thing I thought was weird for a place that's outdoors, in Florida.....they don't have those air mist thingys like you see in places like, Scottsdale/Phoenix. \\nMaybe they do at Disney Springs, but for some GOD AWFUL REASON....They were like....\\"99¬∞ and 100% humidity? Nah, we good! We turn them on when the temp hits 100¬∞\\" \\nThey would have been a god send when I was there lol.\\nIt's a wonderful place regardless. \\n\\nApparently after all the parks close, everyone rushes over to Disney Springs for all the after hours fun. \\nAll the restaurants have something going on, there is all kinds of entertainment. \\nI didn't go after the parks closed. The traffic to get in was INSANE! and no joke, that one day alone, according to my smart watch, I walked 41 miles! Soooooo, doing more walking around Springs...nah, I was good, lol. And I didn't wanna push through thousands of people and fight for parking spots, haha! \\nMe saying that tho, won't stop anyone from going...and why should it? The place is amazing. \\nHad I not walked 41 miles that day, I probably would have been 100% down to go and go back to the Irish restaurant for the Irish band and step dancers they have nightly. \\n\\nSo that's it folks! I don't need to tell you to check this place out if you're headed to Disney World, because if you are headed there, you WILL. DEFINITELY. end up at Disney Springs at some point and you should! Because it's a fun, fun, fun place! Restaurants, shops, bakeries, Disney stores galore WITH an all year round Christmas one! I absolutely LOVE that!

There are lots of places to sit down and just enjoy conversation over a cocktail. I love that you can get your cocktails to go and just walk around with them. They have little carts with beer etc for sale around the park so you don't actually have to go inside a restaurant or bar for a drink, unless you want something fancy.\\nThe shopping is mid to high end. There are a lot of stores here that you can only find in big cities. \\nParking is totally free. There are a few garages, that have signs letting you know if they're full or how many spaces are left and on which levels. Smart! Valet is only $20 and there is a valet near the orange garage and the lime garage, so you can be on either side of Disney Springs. Very convenient, and not expensive. \\nThis Christmas season, they have an option to get pictures with Santa. You go to the kiosk, you put your number, then you go shop or eat etc, and they call you when it's your turn so you can come back. No more long lines! For more info, check the brochure. \\nAlso, for Christmas, there are several bars/restaurants that are offering special holiday food/drink items. There is a brochure that has a list of all the items, so you can check them off as you enjoy, or you can make a plan to try something different each time you go. \\nFun place for a family outing, or even a date night.

The spicy green chili that they topped it with added a nice spicy element without making the dish too spicy. It was a nice contrast to the creamy and rich nature of the appetizer. The appetizer was pretty large and even with the three of us picking at it, it was really filling. For lunch, I had the same thing I did previously (Shrimp and Lump Crab Mac and Cheese) and it was still delicious and I had even more leftovers with the amount of Totchos that were consumed. My sister had the Chicken Bercy and didn't end up liking it that much. She loved the mashed potatoes, but just wished there was more of it instead of the chicken. The chicken was too dry and the smoky flavor of either the chicken or the sauce was not really expected so was not what my sister was expecting with the explanation that was written on the menu of the dish.\\nFor dessert, since we were already so stuffed we all shared a Peanut Indulgence shake.

He didn't explain anything, picked the game without even telling us.... practically didn't even greet us. \\n\\nI'm not one to leave reviews, but this experience left such a bad taste in my mouth, that I would honestly second guess coming to this specific Top-Golf location again."},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Such a delicious cannoli!!!!

Now I must admit here for full disclosure that I've never really been knocked out by their food at the old location. The new location is very well appointed (in the old Prime steakhouse here in Portland) and quite comfortable as far as the downtown dining experience. The wait staff was interesting...there were plenty of trainees following the waiters around but it was rather curious that the waiters never seemed to be around when you needed them and then when you didn't they'd be there hovering. (and hovering wait staff is definitely on my list of No-Nos when it comes to dining out).\\nNow about the food... It is nice to look at a menu and see most of the entr√©es are around $20.  This is a good thing... Until you actually get the entr√©es and you see you've probably paid about twice as much as they're worth.  My wife ordered The salmon which was dry as toast with a sauce that was almost inedible.  My barbecued pulled pork with mashed potatoes and zucchini was terminally unremarkable.  In fact, I ate at a church potluck lunch on Easter Sunday that included all three of those same items and they were all a great deal tastier than they were at Mother's.  \\nTo summarize... I hate to slam such a venerable Portland institution... But there is SO much great food in this town I just don't understand why they can't up their game and it least make their food interesting. This food would've been really nice and upscale in the 60s and 70s, but, compared with the culinary choices one has in Portland these days, Mother's food preparation is not even close!  \\nSo, if you want to go to a restaurant that harkens back to a simpler day, a simpler time, and simpler food prepared the good old-fashioned way, then mothers is your place."},{"name":"Lamberts Downtown Barbecue","address":"401 W 2nd St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"My mother and I drove to 3 different places the day after Christmas to find them all closed.

Kel's Duck Two Ways was melt-in-your-mouth good as was my Canadian Cheddar Cheese Soup.  I had the Mushroom Filet for my entree and she had the Prime Rib.  Both were cooked perfectly.  For dessert Kel went with the themey Chocolate Moose which, despite being really cute, was delicious.  I had the Creme Brulee Sampler.  Half of it was maple creme brulee with a cinnamon whipped cream that I still dream about a month later.\\n\\nThe wine list was fine as were the specialty cocktails (Kel had a \\"Torontopolitan\\").  Our server was attentive, helpful and friendly.  No complaints there.  Downsides were how close together the tables were and the noise level.

I went in with reasonably high expectations, and left disappointed. I ordered the Holy Dark combo with a side of mac and cheese and coleslaw. Since I got takeout, the presentation was nondescript, but the chicken looked nicely fried and seasoned. However, when I took my first bite I noticed little to no heat. At best, the spice level was akin to a jalapeno. I'm honestly confused how a restaurant that prides itself in cooking hot chicken could produce such a mild piece of meat. On a positive note, the chicken was moist and tender, and the breading was crisp. The shining beacon of the meal was the coleslaw-- too often restaurant's douse their slaw in a torrent of mayo, drowning out all of the other flavors. This slaw was light with a prominent vinegar flavor that was nicely balanced by the seasoning. The mac and cheese was slightly better than boxed macaroni. Unless Hot Chicken Takeover improves their spice level, I doubt I will go back."},{"name":"The Rolling Rooster","address":"13717 Mopac Service Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Food tasted authentic, like the chef back there made it with love.

I was waiting at the front when the worker came up to everyone at the front, totally ignoring me, and asked the other customers waiting how many people they had. At this point, it was starting to look very bad on them, as I had walked in before everyone else. This caused multiple people waiting to start talking back confirming who came in first, and who was supposed to be seated first. As the conversation became more heated, the server stated \\"It is busy here and I cannot keep up who came in first.\\" The restaurant is small, and her answer just confirmed Hoang Yen had bad customer service on their part, and did not intend to fix their own mistake. Instead, she started giving the customers bad attitude and a loud \\"SIGH\\" that she was annoyed. My party decided to leave based on poor customer service and went across the street to Hoi An Cafe, as we had very good experiences and delicious food. My party then stated they were never going back to Hoang Yen after experiencing the worst customer service they had in a restaurant without them trying to correct their own mistake. Whats even more exasperating was when the party after me had 2 people, and 2 caucasians came in from the back and got seated first. The 2 person party was fuming at this point, and wanted to know why the caucasian couple was seated before everyone else who has waited longer. It seemed like they were afraid and did not want to seem like they were racial profiling, but at the same time, I felt sorry for the 2 person party who had waited longer. \\n\\nIf Hoang Yen continues with their attitude and bad customer service, it is likely they will continue to lose customers. I would suggest correcting their own mistake and admitting to it first as the customer is never wrong. Why not start a system where customers coming in can write their names on a piece of paper so that all parties are in order by who came in first?"},{"name":"Cartopia Food Carts","address":"1200 SE Hawthorne Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"No parking, hard to get to, freezing cold, not a huge selection of food options, no entertainment, but oh man this place ROCKS! \\n\\nI can't explain it, I don't understand it, and I can't even fathom why so many people are coming down here on a freezing cold rainy Friday to eat food cart dinner outside. \\n\\nSure the food is good, but it's not \\"OMG I'm going to die if I don't go get this right now\\" kind of phenomenal.

We stopped at Abide, hoping to find cold smoothie-type icy fruit teas. \\n     The employees at the counter were super friendly and helpful, answering all of our menu questions.  We learned that Abide does not do smoothie style drinks, just cubed ice, so we ordered two iced drinks.  I chose a fruit tea, my husband a milk tea, both with boba.    They both tasted really good, but were definitely not icy cold.  The tea ingredients on the bottom of our cups were room temperature at best, almost warm.  The ice was on the top.  We had to stir stir stir to make our drinks and boba cold, which watered them down quite a bit.   \\n     They do not have regular tables and chairs here, just low coffee table-ish wood and upholstered, backless, ottoman-type seating, both on wheels and easy to move around to wherever you want.

The third time I decided I will not go back ever again.\\n\\nI love the Well Tea in Richmond, so I figured this one should be at least comparable in terms of food and service but it is nowhere near!\\n\\nDo not let them sit you at a table without the controls to call the server (that's right, there are tables here that do not have the device, which makes no sense at all since the servers will never come to check on you otherwise!)\\n\\nAlso, don't expect that you will get what you want.  I am a huge fatty and love Taiwanese sausage when it's done right.  I've ordered it twice here now and not only was it really terrible quality (how can a Taiwanese place get it wrong!?) the server acted like I was crazy when I asked if they could bring some garlic.  Now I can understand if you serve it without garlic, but if you want to try to tell me you don't have any garlic in your restaurant then that's a completely different story.  I thought hm, perhaps a language barrier, so I even started talking to the servers in Mandarin thinking maybe it would get me somewhere (usually they start off in English so it can be awkward switching).  Nope.  Not only do the servers need reminding, sometimes they just simply do not bring you what you ordered.\\n\\nK fine, I eat my stuff the way you prepared it, super nasty makes me want to throw up, and then I want to pay.\\n\\nBut hold up, you can only split the bill 4 times?! WHAT. If you can split it into 4, why the can't you split it into 5.  That is probably the dumbest thing I have ever heard. The first time I thought it was just a stupid server. The second time I thought maybe it was actually just the same stupid server.  The third time (I guess that makes me the stupid one for going back again) I realized it's actually just a stupid manager.  Refusing to split the bill at all makes WAY more sense than splitting the bill into maximum 4.  If this is a problem with the point of sale system they're using, they should probably invest in a different one.\\n\\nTHEN, because we were annoyed, we paid all in change, which we counted several times before leaving and even left in little stacks so they would know we paid enough, and the server came CHASING AFTER US OUTSIDE claiming we didn't pay enough.

Restaurants with a big menu like this place either do one or two things well and the rest Meh, or do nothing well.  This place does everything well.  I'm deducting a star for the following - I went there with my wife, Son, Father, and 10yo Granddaughter.  There is a difference between low lighting for \\"Ambience\\" and \\"Hooly crap I can't read the menu\\"  Even my Granddaughter couldn't read the menu because of the low lighting, and we had to turn the flashlight settings on our phones to read it.  The server was cheerful and attentive.  Imagine my surprise when a 15% gratuity was included in our bill.  Nowhere on the Menu does it indicate this (or maybe it did and because of the crappy lighting I missed it) and we were not a large enough group to warrant it.  Normally we tip 20 - 25% BUT since you included it you screwed yourself out of 5%+.  I Got some Baklava to take home and was very disappointed.  Not enough Honey, and too much salt, and the puff pastry separated and the whole thing came apart like a house of cards in a windstorm.  I'm willing to shell out $2.5 -$3 a piece for good Baklava, but the crap you get in the freezer aisle was better than this.  Seriously guys, increase your lighting, your wood is all dark and absorbs light so that 40 watt bulb is putting out 25 watts worth of light, and leave it up to me how much to tip."},{"name":"Another Broken Egg Caf√©","address":"3016 Guadalupe St","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"Walked into this place after a TV fail at a bar down the street as I wanted to watch a football game.

It has so many things going for it that I love. It is woman owned, they give back to the community and they are even in my neighborhood! They serve vegan options and the owner has a similar love of quirky vintage. Plus they are in my neighborhood and open until 8! I was feeling guilty because I have lived in the neighborhood for 10 years and have heard rave reviews but have yet to stop in until now. For my husband's birthday I thought that I would stop in and surprise him with a  quality piece of cake. \\n\\nI admit I am a bit of a pastry snob because my sister in law owns two cupcake shops in the bay area, so whenever she is in town we have to go bakery hopping to sample goods. I am a die hard fan of vintage and antiques and even I found the layout and decor off-putting and unprofessional. There's quirky and cute, but this reminded me more of someone's attic than a bakery.\\n\\nThere were no menus at the front to look at. The cakes and cupcakes looked attractive, but practically nothing was labeled as far as price and half of the options weren't even labeled as to what flavors they are. The lady that served me must be new because even though there was only 2 people in front of me she seemed very frazzled. The guy in front of me ordered a slice of vegan carrot cake and being vegan I ordered the same cake, since I didn't think my husband would like Irish Oat cake, which was the other option. So, she boxed up two slices and I took them home. I had reasonable expectations as the two slices cost $15. I added a dollar as a tip just because I have worked food service and know what it's like to live on tips so I try to pay it forward, so $16 total.\\n\\nI got home from work at 7 and was starving. I lit a candle on my husbands cake so he could blow out the candles and I could get straight to eating something amazing. I as SO UNDERWHELMED! I must have been fed something that was AT LEAST two days old. The cake was dry and stale. I have had so much better cakes from practically any grocery store! Even though I was starving after half a slice I threw it out - it was that bad. My husband made it through one and a half bites and had the same opinion.

The Baldwin Park restaurant is modern and trendy on the inside, with a lot of silver and black and interesting lighting.\\n\\nWe ordered three rolls: The Alaskan, the Sunset, and I think it was called the Torchamaki or something like that.  For once, I skipped the hamachi nigiri that I usually get on my first visit to a sushi restaurant because we were already spending enough money and for some reason, they wanted $6.50 for two pieces.\\n\\nAll three of these rolls were very good.  The Alaskan had a nice krab taste with some tempura crunch, and was topped off with a bit of eel sauce.  The torchamaki had a unique taste, due mainly to the torching of the whitefish on top of the roll giving it a hint of a burnt flavor (it's not a bad thing).  The Sunset (universally voted as the favorite) was wrapped with salmon and topped with a super-thin slice of lemon for an interesting citrus flavor, added to a little sweetness from the spicy ponzu sauce that comes on the side for dipping.\\n\\nSome unique options, to be sure.  We almost opted for one of the two chirashi selections though, because there were so few maki options on the menu that we were interested in.  We had to scour the menu to find three special rolls that weren't fried, filled with cream cheese or based heavily off of that most boring of all sushi, the California Roll.\\n\\nAnd as good as our rolls were, they were a bit small for their price.  At over $40, I would have hoped to be full enough to skip that trip for frozen yogurt afterward, and I'd say that at many sushi places at that pricing tier, I would be.\\n\\nSo Seito looks great on the inside and the sushi is good, but the pricing seems to reflect the decor more than the food.

I ordered a side of veggies and rice. The rice had hard pieces in it and was undercooked and sprayed with butter to make it look edible. The broccoli had blackened stems that I meticulously cut off before eating. Don't get me started on the salad. It had pre-cut lettuce. How do I know it's pre-cut, it was shriveled and darkened. On top were a few red onions (like toppings on a burger), diced tomatoes (like toppings on a taco or garnish), and some dried English cucumbers (I think I didn't have my magnifying glass with me). That was $9. I could've gone to the field and picked my own lettuce for cheaper. Sorry I ordered that.

First off, let me say our server was great especially considering the policy she is forced to follow which must be a giant pain. So we were meeting some friends for dinner and one thing led to another and we ended up with a group of 13. Now I understand that this is a big group for a place the size of Pizza Bruno but there were plenty of empty tables when we arrived and they were able to push some together in the back without much fuss so I didn't think having a big group was that big of a deal. We sat down and started chatting and eventually it was brought to our attention that we were given the \\"group menu\\" which is apparently a reduced menu with \\"family sized\\" portions of the sides. Since this was my first time I didn't realize there was anything missing off of the menu, but one of the families in our group told our server they would like to order their usual off of the non-group menu. This required an admonishment from someone (presumably the manager) who came to our table to tell us that we could order off of their normal menu this time but next time we would have to follow their policy of ordering off of the group menu. I think we unanimously said under our breaths there will never be a next time. She manager-splained to us that they have a small kitchen so they just can't allow groups to order off of the normal menu (because 4 families sitting with their tables pushed together is WAAAAY different from 4 families sitting with some space between the tables). This was only problem #1.\\n\\nProblem #2: my wife has a legit gluten allergy. \\"Then why go to a pizza restaurant?\\" you may ask. The other 12 people do not have gluten allergies and we enjoy their company. Also, most places have some gluten free options these days. Apparently Bruno did have gluten-free crust until recently, but no more. So my wife's options were a kale salad or one of 2 gluten-free apprizers which are only available family-size for double the price. So if she wants both the cauliflower and the octopus, we can get both for $50+. She's not a fan of cauliflower which means one octopus tentacle for dinner for $30+. We ended up stopping at Taco Bell on the way home.\\n\\nThere were some positives. As I mentioned, our server was great and went out of our way to try to diffuse what could have been a bad situation. Luckily for her we all really enjoy each others company so we were able to laugh at the situation, have some drinks, and enjoy the pizza we eventually ordered (off of the normal menu). They gave my wife some free cauliflower (yay?). The music selection was cool (pretty much all 90s grunge) but not too loud. The pizza was pretty good. I just can't get past not being able to order things and having higher prices (yes portions were bigger but everything was double price) just for wanting to sit with some friends. This isn't a hard problem to solve. Offer this as an option. Don't allow groups over a certain size. Inform big groups that their food won't all come out together.\\n\\nJust to be clear, this wasn't a special event. This wasn't a kids birthday party or a family reunion or special anniversary. This was a few group of friends arriving at a restaurant asking to be sat together. This is something almost any restaurant can handle and the ones that can't simply physically cannot so they let you know. This is a HORRIBLE policy and talking to customers like they have done something wrong for trying to come to your restaurant together is HORRIBLE customer service. I know at least 3 of the families aren't planning on coming back even though there really wasn't any issue with the food or it's service. It is just because of this RIDICULOUS policy and how we were treated by the management."},{"name":"Modern Pastry Shop","address":"257 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Love the pastries here.

Fine (figured maybe she will get me the almond macaroons).  My mom starts her order and requests 1 lb of seeded cookies.  Waitress states they don't have any.  I then ask for the bill and pay it.

Great looking interior, quick service and easy to order menu. But ultimately it's about the food, and the food fell woefully short\\".  He also stated \\"Everything about the restaurant hints at something more than what we were served.\\"  Well put, George.\\n\\nMy wife and myself, along with my son and his girlfriend, visited today for the first time.  The service was VERY good, and the d√©cor is slightly upscale, and very spacious.  I chose the Niman Ranch Burger with fries, and my wife had the veggie burger with chips and salsa.  For desert we had a couple of cookies, and for drinks I had Boylan's Red soda from the fountain - which was possibly the best soda I've had in my 42 years of life - and my wife had the hot cider with rum for $9 (yikes) and said it was so good that she would have paid $10 for it.\\n\\nSo regarding the food, my fries were average and the burger was ok as well.  I did finish the burger which was probably 1/3 lb., but I wasn't a fan (I was just very hungry).  This will sound strange, but the burger was overkill.  It was like flavor overload.  I'm thinking this was the type of beef, but it was just too much flavor for me.  I know this isn't the case, but it tasted like it had MSG sprinkled on it.  I would not order this burger again.  Another note that I hope will help some poor soul:  I instinctively salt my food before tasting it which works out ok 99% of the time - this is not a good idea with this dish as it was already quite salty.  My son and his girlfriend split this burger as well and had the same opinion - they would not reorder either.\\n\\nMy wife loves veggie burgers and did not care for this one.  She managed to eat about half, and did enjoy the chips and salsa.  The rest of the table also tried her veggie burger and did not care for it either.\\n\\nThree sandwiches, three sides, three cookies, and four drinks (one alcohol, three sodas) totaled $75.

Everything from the soft green and yellow decor, to the friendly waitstaff, to the stumptown coffee, to the delicious menu items delights me.  I could venture there once a week and never tire of the menu items (though I might start running low on funds).\\n\\nLocals and tourists alike seem to know all about Mother's as THE place for brunch.  So my suggestion, make a reservation if you want to eat here or alternatively, you can show up at about 8:40am on a Saturday or Sunday which will get you there early enough to line up before the doors open (at 9am), and you'll be guaranteed a seat.  I assure you, even though I am a morning person, its worth to be there early if you don't have a reservation otherwise you can expect to wait 40 minutes.\\n\\nThe service is truly impeccable and friendly.  Some of the best dishes for brunch include their hallmark cornflake french toast, their smoked salmon hash, or their perfect eggs benedict.  If you're there with a group, I suggest ordering the french toast as a breakfast \\"appetizer\\" to share and then ordering your own delicious meal.\\n\\nAlso a great place for lunch - their salads are large and tasty."},{"name":"Mahony & Sons","address":"5990 University Boulevard","city":"Vancouver","stars":"2.5","text":"There's slim pickings for good food/drinks on campus and even less if you're looking for a sit-down place... so this explains how a few friends and I end up here one afternoon.\\n\\nDefinitely not my style - I'm not a pub girl at the best of times and this place leaves much to be desired.

The food @ Northstar is good. There's no denying that. I had the egg sandwich and my partner had the \\"Big\\" breakfast burrito and we both enjoyed them. OJ is obviously fresh squeezed and tasty and the \\"fair trade\\" organic coffee was good too and I like the fact that everything was organic and they have a whole \\"save the earth; do good\\" approach to everything. \\n\\nHaving said that.....GET OFF YOUR FREAKIN' HIGH HORSE, NORTHSTAR! Stop acting like your s*#t don't stink.  First of all, let's start with the cost. Along with the burrito and egg sandwich, we also ordered 2 coffees and 2 OJ's. Grand total: $32.00! I really couldn't believe it. I have never complained about the cost of something but when I'm ordering at the counter and getting my own coffee, I think $32 for two people is a bit high.  Heck, First Watch has waiter service and even throws in sides at no charge and still comes in lower than you guys. And while I respect the whole organic & green approach, it comes off a bit \\"sanctimonious\\".  You're a breakfast place. You're not going to save the earth serving breakfast burritos. And then I realized why they have to charge what they do. They're @ Easton, the largest and most upscale \\"lifestyle\\" center in the Midwest! This was the former Smith & Hawken space so they're next to Barnes & Noble and Crate & Barrel. They've got to gouge the New Albany moms who want their organic meals for their \\"gifted\\" children, Skylar & Olivia. They know that the Worthington families want to feel good about where they've eaten as they hop back in their Range Rovers. I'm not sure what the other locations are like but the Easton location seems pretentious and self righteous and really just ends up looking fake. \\n\\nI enjoyed the food but didn't enjoy the \\"message\\" (or the self entitled suburban children running around me)."},{"name":"Hot Chicken Takeover","address":"59 Spruce St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"Adding the great baked beans adds a star.

He would give us recommendations for his favorites and for the \\"most popular\\". His favorites were hands down the winners of our choices. \\n\\nI also like that their characters (Penelope and Toothsome) were very interactive with the crowd. My kid (10yrs old) really ate that up and loved this place. \\n\\nAppetizer-- I had the avocado toast, which was good for someone who LOVES avocado as there is A LOT of it. The dish also had a light balsamic glaze drizzled on top and a few tomatoes. But IMO, the dish lacked flavor. It has potential but needs something with more of a punch. Maybe a seasoning on top? To be fair our waiter suggested the hummus or the Brussels and we chose to try something else ÔøΩ?Main-- we had the grilled teriyaki salmon which turned out to be some of the BEST salmon I've had. It was light but flavorful. 6oz portion, man I could've eaten double!! The veggies were good and we subbed mash potatoes for rice. Staff was happy to sub sides for whatever we liked with a ton of options. This dish was suggested and the waiter claimed it to be his favorite. I can see why. It's a nice light meal before the overindulgent dessert options. He also raved about the super food salad which we did not try.\\nDessert-- I was undecided so I went with his favorite (again a winner!) which was the flourless chocolate cake and we subbed the Nutella ice cream for sour cream ice cream. His thought was that the Nutella is a tad overpowering to the sweetness of the cake. I would say I could agree to that after tasting it. The cake was amazing and the sour cream ice cream complimented it well. Think of sour cream ice cream as similar to the homemade mix you would make for cheese cake, light and tangy. Perfect with the super moist cake (reminds me of carnivals chocolate melting cake). Hands down this dessert was a 10! He also raves about the bread pudding. \\n\\nMy son got the brookie. And well it was an enormous plethora of sweets from ice cream to cookie brownies and whip and all sorts of jazz. Nothing special IMO because none of the flavors stood out.

Barbacoa muy rica y autentica. \\n\\nSo, count this one as a lesson to Mr. Don B. in what REAL D.F. Mexican food can be (I guess, I have never been to D.F.).  \\n\\nStep 1: Go to Chipotle and get a barbacoa burrito: beef slow cooked with bay leaves, etc, with a crapload of Americanized additions. Think - mmm, this is a tasty concept, I bet real Mexicans can make it better.\\n\\nStep 2: Go to El Brasero, a dirty-looking little cart on 12th and Hawthorne, which advertises authentic Barbacoa.  Make sure you think that you know what you are doing. Order the barbacoa.\\n\\nStep 3: Be surprised.... very surprised.\\n\\nI thought I knew what was up. El Brasero has humbled me. \\n\\nSo I ordered my usual - meat burrito with guac and sour cream. Because they take up a whole 1/3 of a sheet of plywood advertising the Barbacoa, I figured I should try it.  I have a great amount of anticipation, excited to be trying a new authentic version of something I am sure a place like Chipotle has totally screwed up.  The guy looks at me like I am crazy, but proceeds to fill the order.  After a 4 minute wait, I receive quite a large burrito, filled with soft, tender beef, lettuce, salsa, and guac.  It came with a little side of homemade salsa.\\n\\nThe salsa was mediocre..\\n\\nThe beef was moist and tender, and had an ok flavor - mostly the flavor of slow-cooked beef, without any spices. It did have that \\"beefy-beef\\" flavor, known well to those more adventurous eaters who have consumed various inner-parts of a cow. It's not the light steak flavor, but closer to the real essence of cow one experiences when consuming offal. Oh, yummy, tender, melt in my mouth beef.... uh, what was that? Oh, a little chunk of bone. That must be an anomaly, a splinter from a rib or something.... MMMmmm  tender bee.... uh, what's that? Oh, another little chunk of bone... wow, these ribs must have been man-handled, I mean cow bones are big and sturdy, but they can chip and fracture... oh, well, mmmmm tender and delect.... uh, ok, this time the bone in my mouth is a whole bone. A whole bone that looks like a chicken bone. \\n\\nWTF?!?!?! Cows don't have small bones. They just don't. The bone in my mouth is about 3/4\\" long, 1/4\\" wide, and a FULL BONE. Sweet mother of all that is good, WHAT THE HELL AM I EATING HERE?!?! I stopped to take a long, hard look at the meat inside the tortilla, and it looks, tastes, and smells like beef. No, this wasn't a stray chicken bone that made it into my beef, this bone was part of the meat.  \\n\\nWhen something like the above-described situation happens to you, especially while eating a burrito from a cart, it inspires a really interesting set of internal emotions. They run the gambit from scared, to astounded, to disgusted, to intrigued. Needless to say, when it happens about 1/8th from the END of the burrito, you are best off trying to finish with the\\"intrigued\\" emotion winning out.  \\n\\nAfter spending a good 3 to 4 minutes just STARING at the burrito, I opted to stick with \\"intrigued\\", and went ahead and finished the thing off. Frankly, I was hungry, it was decently tasty, and I already had the bulk of [___] meat in my stomach. It's too late now - if it's gonna kill me, I'm already a goner.\\n\\nSo I finish the damn thing and proceed to go about my daily business.   My sense of wonderment has been piqued enough to regale my study-mates about my experience and to closely monitor my gastrointestinal situation for any signs of the possibly impending ass-pocalypse that could erupt at any time.  No doing, it went down just fine.\\n\\nI run home later to the safety of the interweb to determine just what I had unwittingly experimented with. It seems that traditional, authentic barbacoa is slow cooked cow's head. I guess that makes some sense. The only place in a cow's body that could possibly have a bone that small is the head. NOT WHAT I WAS EXPECTING, but surprisingly not too bad. Would have been better with some seasoning though.  I cannot definitively say that what I ate was cow's head, but where else does a bone that small come from on a cow???? I have had cow spine, and cow innards, and all sorts of other \\"parts\\" of a cow, and never encountered a bone this small.\\n\\nBravo to El Brasero for undermining my paradigm.  More stars to be had if you can season up that wonderfully tender meat a bit, and GET THE DAMN BONES OUT OF THE MEAT NEXT TIME!!!!! You're gonna scare off us white folk, and in a place like Portland, you don't want that. \\n\\nAs to the menu, they offer a traditional mix of tacos, burritos, sopas, etc. I saw some coming out to other customers, and they looked quite good. I will definitely be trying out a non-head meat here next time. I wouldn't get the barbacoa again, not because of what it is, but because of what it isn't - all that tasty."},{"name":"Grand Floridian Cafe","address":"4401 Floridian Way","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"YES!!!

I don't know if Boston/Cambridge just doesn't have any good milk teas that they consider this place good but this place is a joke.

Well ok, i probably wouldnt wait out the door and around the connah for it but its worth the wait if youre a first timer.\\n\\nOh apparently people don't know how to order a cheese cannoli so be sure to ask for the cheese ones as the cream filled ones are not worth it. I agree, don't expect to get a box and enjoy the same freshness the next day. Nope, they will sog a bit so eat them the same day! They have alwys had that creamy delicious center with the crispy shell. I'd pass up the pretty chocolate chips on the end, they just mask the already delish flavor\\n\\nSome other favorites are the chocolate dipped biscotti. These are ok to freeze and take out as needed and the flavor is always what you look for in a biscotti, yum!\\n\\nMy all time fav are the rainbow cookies. Layers of colorful marzipan with a thin layer of sweet jam, all covered in chocolate, can this get any better? Moist and delish!\\n\\nThe rugalach is also nice, its fresher tasting than others I've had.\\n\\nThere is a secret to getting in line and getting served fast, i can't share it but i think you can find it in these reviews later on.

They just (Finally!) painted the outside of the building, but they need to hire someone to deal with the plants and garbage in the bushes it would be so much nicer out there, plus they need to upgrade their furniture outside. (Ikea has decent outdoor furniture and is inexpensive, hello?) We never buy anything from this place, nor go in because there's just too much junk in there. If they spent some time and little money it could be a nice place to go to sit down and have a piece of cake and some coffee but until then my family and I (as well as others I know) will never go there. I'm actually surprised they pass health inspections with so much clutter. Maybe the kitchen area is clean, but the rest is clutter. They also freeze cupcakes..they need to blow that stuff out at the end of the day and start fresh each day...maybe thats changed, as it has been at least 3 years since weve bought anything from there but i know that we had cupcakes that werent very fresh (especially for that kind of $).

I wouldn't be surprised if they didn't. \\n\\nIn the last two weeks that I've been here, I've found hair in my food three times.. (three times too many if you ask me). The first time, it was just one long hair. I pulled it out, and didn't finish my meal but didn't say anything to them as I frequented this place quite a bit and figured it was just a one off. The second time, I found another hair. I also didn't finish my meal but didn't say anything. The third time, I got take out. When opened the box, I saw my yam roll had what I thought to be splinters from chop sticks or something. When I looked closer, it was literally a CHUNK OF HAIR all over the bottom and side of my roll. It literally looked as if someone got a haircut in their kitchen, and dropped my yam roll in it. I was so disgusted. Never coming back to hair garden again. \\n\\nWhen they brought me my food here a couple of weeks ago, I asked them for a soy sauce dish as they forgot to bring it. It wasn't very busy that day as it was about 3:30 on a Tuesday. I waited 25 minutes and asked for a dish for soy sauce 4 times. Each time the server would say 'yes right away' and then go back to the counter and talk with the other servers. I asked FOUR times (THREE different servers), and eventually had to get up, walk over to the counter and ask for a soy sauce dish. Again, the girl said 'right away. I'll bring it over to you'. I waited another 5 minutes and ended up just pouring soy sauce onto my rolls which I hate doing because I find way too much comes out and it tastes way too salty. \\n\\nI really wish I could give this place zero stars.

We wanted to see which was better and we both agreed that the beef tasted better. The tacos were fresh tasting from the shells all the way down to the side items. The chips were terrific with a fresh crisp taste and they even come with a melted cheese dipping sauce on the side. \\n\\nWhat I really liked about the concept of the place was they had a side area of the restaurant dedicated to their special sauces which you can pick and choose what you want to try.

Unfortunately, most locations can't live up to that. If you want the cheapest price and quality of food that you can still technically call \\"pizza,\\" by all means, eat here; but if you can justify spending more money (a lot more money) for satisfaction and fresher ingredients, try Nancy's at camp creek.

I officially LOVE Lee's!\\n\\nLee's Bakery is situated in a shopping center off Buford Highway, close to the Clairmont split (across from Taqueria Los Rayos).  The store is clean and somewhat like a sandwich shop, in that they have tons of chips, drinks, and homemade Vietnamese pastries to purchase in addition to your sit-down meal.\\n\\nWhat I had:\\n-- Spring rolls (read:  shrimp basil rolls wrapped in rice paper with peanut sauce - NOT FRIED):  $3.50\\n-- 1/2 banh mi (grilled pork) and 1/2 pho soup:  $6.50\\n-- Thai tea with \\"bubbles\\":  $3.00\\n\\nThe spring rolls were huge and very light and tasty.  They are the best answer to a hot summer's day.  For the size, you'd easily pay $5 and up elsewhere, but here?  $3.50.  The portion is large enough to split.\\n\\nThat sandwich, oh my gosh, that SANDWICH.  Let me begin by saying, aside from bacon, I rarely eat pork.  I don't really like the flavor or texture so its just not on the menu in my house.  The 1/2 soup/sandwich combo comes with a wide array of choice for the sandwich.  \\n\\nHere's how the convo went down:\\n\\n\\"What's traditional?\\"\\n\\n\\"Grilled pork.\\"\\n\\n\\"Okay then.  Let's do it.\\"\\n\\n\\"Spicy?  Jalapeno?\\"\\n\\n\\"Yes, absolutely.\\"\\n\\n--big, big grin from the waiter--\\n\\nI couldn't get over how fantastic the sandwich was.  The grilled pork is tender and yet so flavorful, with just the teensiest bit of crunch to it.  When paired with fresh veggies, cilantro, and a slice of yummy raw spicy jalapeno, it was perfection.  The bread is everything I've dream about in a French roll.  I added a little dash of sriracha, and next thing I knew, my sandwich was gone.  I can't believe this sandwich costs $3 ($2.50 if you carry out!).\\n\\nBut wait, there's soup!\\n\\nThe 1/2 soup portion was MASSIVE.  Its definitely not a half soup portion!  I loved the beef in my pho and all the pho accoutrements made my meal super.\\n\\nMy \\"Thai tea with bubbles\\" had a lot of ice in it in comparison to the drhink, but I think there must be a reason for that (someone tell me what I didn't figure out there...), but I LOVED its taste, especially with the food.  I also loved eating the \\"bubbles\\" as a dessert.  YUM.\\n\\nThe service in this place is 5 star.  John Lee is so super friendly and kind, it makes me want to be a regular!  Our waiters were friendly as can be and eager to help us get what we wanted.  Pics of the food also make it relatively easy to order.\\n\\nThe only drag is that there is a $10 minimum for credit cards, but if you get the $6.50 soup/sandwich special, spring rolls, and a Thai bubble tea, you're already over that limit."},{"name":"Whole Foods Market","address":"12601 Hill Country Blvd","city":"Bee Cave","stars":"3.5","text":"Good selection of food.

The sushi rolls were very good but not the best I have had. The corona roll was different than I had thought it was when I tried it about two years ago. Of course things change and possibly the ingredients did in this roll. It was a good overall flavor, but the toppings on top like the red onions and diced tomatoes did not look and taste fresh. The triple tail roll was better for me. I loved the typical sushi roll vibe and taste. Had the best combo in the roll; yellow tail, salmon and tuna. I am a big sauce girl with my sushi, and I can say they have very delicious spicy mayo and eel sauce. The bayou roll is a good choice to get filled up. It comes with fried shrimp coated in a sweet sauce on top of the roll. Having it with the spicy mayo makes a great finish to it. The bourbon roll is a no no choice for my taste. It has sesame seeds on top and a very sweet sticky texture and flavor when you bite into it, that it takes over everything. I would say if you have tried sesame balls from Asian restaurants this is what the roll is like.  Overall great service and atmosphere.

If you don't want to be overwhelmed with huge theme parks, this is a great place to just relax, shop, and eat. There is no entrance fee into Downtown Disney, but you have to pay for the things they offer if you decide to do these activities. So basically Downtown Disney is divided into three sections: Downtown Disney West Side, Downtown Disney Marketplace and Pleasure Island. I will go over the highlights of each.\\n\\nWest Side:\\nSo this is a more chill side, where you can relax by watching a movie or acrobatic show or enjoy breakfast/lunch/dinner. There's the AMC theater. It's a normal AMC theater to me. Nothing new. And no they do not only play Disney movies haha. You could watch the Cirque du Soleil-La Nouba, which is a colorful acrobatic/circus show in a nice theater. I haven't watched it but there's so much rave about these types of shows. There are several restaurants such as the House of Blue Cafe, Wolfgang Puck, Planet Hollywood, and Bongo's (Gloria Estafan owns this restaurant). There's Disney Quest, which is an indoor arcade/game place for the kids (additional admission). Oh there's that hot-air ballon-type thing called \\"Characters in Flight\\" (additional admssion). It basically takes you up on this giant balloon-looking ride so you could view Downtown Disney from an aerial perspective.\\n\\nMarketplace:\\nThis is where you can buy all your souvenirs if you want original Disney items. You can go to World of Disney, which is a huge store full of Disney products! It's kind of like the Disney store you see at the mall times 100 haha. Oh and there's a Lego store/creation center next to World of Disney. There are little food stores here. Oh and there's a Disney Christmas shop here. The Rainforest Cafe is a nice dining experience here.\\n\\nPleasure Island:\\nI think this might be more geared towards adult tourists because there's a cigar store, bar/pub, and a Harley Davidson store. Fulton's Crabhouse is on a cruise boat-type of restaurant here. We didn't spend that much time here...we just walked past it.\\n\\nSo that's Downtown Disney in a nutshell.

The munchkin had asked for Thai, so I did a quick search and this place was open for over another hour and a mile or two away.\\n\\nOff we absconded like a thief in the night. We parked and rolled up on the joint like we were casing it. Well we were kinda starving and ready to thief some grub if we had to. Instead we got a table and chilled. \\n\\nPro Tip: COME HERE! I seriously doubt you will be disappointed...\\n\\nAND THEN IT HAPPENED! The munchkin sprung from her ipad and me from my mobile aps, to witness lo and behold the grub that had been delivered deftly to our table...\\n\\nFirst up was our shrimp tempura appetizer. Three pieces of shrimp, a bell pepper, a carrot, a string bean, and an American broccoli tree. Well these shrimp and veggies tasted delightful. They were light, not very oily, and were tasty as expected.\\n\\nThen arrived the munchkin's Pad See Ew. The noodles were double wide O_O Yes that means about 1.5\\" wide! BOOM. I have never seen that before anywhere in Thailand or in the States. They were much better than average with this one. They also had both American and Chinese broccoli within the Pad See Ew.\\n\\nLast but not least by any stretch of the imagination, was the Bulgogi. OMG THIS CHIT IS AMAZING! I know some that would call it Amazaballs... but I dont talk like that, thank God. Needless to say this dish was little bites of heaven with some cooked onions to act as a counterpoint. The little bit of au jus in the onions should be drizzled over your rice before placing meat and onions over it to grub.\\n\\nFor a great surprise they brought out free melon chunks for desert with some kind of lobster cutout skewers.

We went to Toro for Saturday night dinner and Little Donkey for Sunday brunch. Little Donkey was busy but we were able to be seated right away. As suggested by our waiter, my boyfriend and I decided to share 4 dishes: congee ramen, foie gras burger, toad in a hole, and hash. The congee ramen did not come with any noodles but had some typical ramen toppings like sesame oil, ground pork, and a soft boiled egg. The congee was thicker than what I'm used to and my boyfriend said the whole dish reminded him of oatmeal. I enjoyed the dish because it reminded me of my childhood but I also agree with my boyfriend that it was quite bland. The foie gras burger was tasty but again, was not anything special. There was no foie gras to be detected and the whole thing was quite greasy. I would get it again if it didn't cost $15. The toad in a hole was basically eggs in a hole with sausage and banana bread in place of toast.  I really enjoyed the banana bread but the sausage was generic and the creamed spinach didn't quite fit. Our last dish was the hash and it was my favorite of the four. The portion size was bigger than the other tapas and the meat was seasoned well, not salty. Little Donkey didn't live up to the hype in my opinion but I'd be willing to go back for dinner in the future.

Not only that, my friend almost fell on glass. Yes glass, left by a previous group all under the table. Mind you this was on the upper floor. The below floor had wonderful staff. These were the 2 bartenders, 1 a girl with dark hair and green eyes and fairly tall. I usually would never call out a specific employee but the entire time we felt disrespected by her and clearly she can't do her job, which is to be friendly to be costumers. So after the glass incident she did not apologize or give us any type of help, nor did staff offer to clean the glass up so we wouldn't have to do it ourselves. Also this glass was not by us as all our glasses were on the table in one piece and only pieces of glass were find scattered across the floor. Not only that, We notified guy working as a bartender that night that we would be doing karaoke , 12 people for 2 hours. He told us via text it would be $10 per person, not per hour. Person. If you ask how much for two hours you wouldn't expect them to say how much for two hours or include per hour if they are saying per hour . It ended up being $252 dollars. $250 dollars , $27 per person. We were told it would be $10 not only that if it's $10 per hour the total would be $20 per person. It was absolutely absurd and we were clearly mis informed by the staff. They did not apologize for this mishap , but instead argued with us, totally disregarding their mistakes in misinforming us and leaving glass all over the floor.

We were gone for an hour, they knew they had her license and card, and they had all our info and number to call my friend and tel her.

Pips is the proclaimed donuts of the city of Portland by locals. \\n\\n Pips specializes in small bite size donuts with various glaze combos (nutella, chocolate, salt etc).  I'm partial to chais and its nice to see a place that really focuses on them. There's a really diverse assortment from spicy to lavender. I thought the smokey robinson was an tasty, smooth mix of vanilla, chai and a strong smoke aspect (like that in a cocktail).  Try the flight if you have time! As for donuts, most get a mixed sample of a dozen. Really easy to eat, and certainly a different (less guilty) experience then that at Voodoo.  The Dirty Wu and season special- a blueberry filling were especially standout. Impressive that it all came out to only $10! \\n\\nMany have painted this place as a local hole in the wall type gem, though I think those days are long gone- it is just as popular as the other 2 major donut places in town.

Everyone in line was a tourist for the most part (icing on the cake was people talking about how Pips was featured in Vogue) , in some ways its great they are getting so much business. In other ways the hyping is a shame as it felt like some sort of amusement attraction rather then a quintessential PNW food experience.

Keep in mind it is an All You Cant Eat restaurant. \\nThe quality of the meats were decent. Not the best but definitely not the worst. Cooking the meat on the grill is always a great experience on its own. All the dishes did come out pretty quickly, the dishes that they remembered. There were more than a few times that we politely reminded them about a few dishes. Other wise it was a good experience. Sushi at an All You Can Eat restaurant is always a hit or miss. For Shabusen it was definitely a MISS. The rice and the Nigiri Sushi all together was not prepped and put together all that great and just broke apart if you were using your chopsticks. Much better if you used your hands for the Nigiri Sushi. Though the rest of the items that were available on the Dinner AYCE were pretty good. The Ton katsu and the Chicken Teriyaki were really good. \\nOne thing we did notice at our short time there. Each dish did get smaller and smaller as we ordered more. They became smaller in quantity and and took much longer to bring around the table. At one point we did wait 20 minutes for our second order of dishes.

Because of the snow, there was not much of a wait and we were seated right away.\\n\\nTo start off the meal, we went with the pork and chive potstickers, along with the short-rib and celery dumplings. The pork and chive potstickers were dressed with the famed oil that creates a numbing sensation in the mouth--which was interesting, but not my favorite experience. On the other hand, the short-rib dumplings, which were topped with a spicy sauce, were probably my favorite dish of the night.\\n\\nFor the rest of the meal we ordered the Brussels sprouts, the lamb lollipops, and the fish tacos. The Brussels sprouts were cooked perfectly and had such great crispiness to them that really provided a nice bite. The lamb lollipops were decent, and the noodles that came with them were very good--wish we had a bit more of the noodles with it. The fish tacos were also good--I believe they were mani-mahi the night we went.\\n\\nTo finish off the meal, we went with the popular hot cookie and ice cream. I've had desserts like this before, but somehow here they are able to keep the whole cookie very soft and serve it with plenty of ice cream. It was the perfect finish to a tasty meal and plenty to split between the two of us.\\n\\nOverall, this place is very charming and has a nice ambiance--a perfect place for a date.

While I'm not happy about having to use two of my table service meals to eat here now for dinner I understand why disney had to make this change. The lunch menu however is basically the same as the dinner menu and lunch only counts as one table service meal. The atmosphere here however is great. As the name implies le Cellier meaning the celler it is just like eating in a small wine celler. The space is small and cozy and very relaxed. This is a nice break from the hectic day at the park. THe wait staff here has always been really friendly (eventhough they have bad taste in hockey teams :)). The beer cheese soup here is to die for. I think this is still the only bowel of soup where I pretty much licked the bowel clean. EVery bite has a few small pieces of bacon and the flavor is amazing. The steaks here are also great. The beef is actually flown in from Canada (talk about disney magic). Mine have always been cooked exactly as I ordered them. Dessert is also great although the portion size is a bit on the small side. All and all a great meal and a must try when visiting Disney."},{"name":"Taste of Punjab","address":"4980 W Irlo Bronson Memorial Hwy, Ste 192","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"4.5","text":"We came to this recommendation on the recommendation of a friend and I am so glad we did. Hands down, this is probably the best Indian food I have ever eaten in my life! My only complaint was that since it was lunch time, my husband and I chose to share dish as opposed to each having our own, which would have meant more deliciousness to eat! To start with, we had their vegetable samosas. They were filled with a delicious mixture of potatoes, peas and Indian spices with a nice crunchy crust on the outside. The entree we had was the butter chicken which came with Jasmine rice and we also had an order of Naan bread. The bread was so delicious I know I'm going to be thinking about that bread for a long time! The sauce  with the butter chicken  was so good we literally ate every drop of it.In addition to this perfect meal, we had exceptional service from one of their employees named PK who was very on top of things, constantly filling up our water glasses and checking to see if we needed anything and were happy with our meal. They are lucky to have an employee such as PK at the restaurant.

That being said, I will NEVER RETURN TO PEICE OF CAKE. Here is why- My mom and I ordered two simple, small, GF cakes for my wedding last September- basic chocolate with raspberry filling and white icing. I had a small wedding with 30 people and was really going for the nontraditional look. After ordering, my mother received a call about 1 month before the wedding confirming our order and trying to upset a tiered cake instead of the two small cakes we ordered. When my mom declined sharing that I did not want a traditional \\"wedding\\" look and that it was only for 30 people, my mom WAS CRITICIZED BY THE OWNER  for a \\"cheap\\" look. I was APPALLED. Not only was I worried my order might be wrong but now I was being criticized for the way I wanted my special day to look. I considered canceling my order, but I had too much on my plate at the time so I continued with the order. The wedding day showed up, my mother and law picked the cakes up and dropped them at the venue, I arrive to the venue to see a disappointed and angry look on my mom's face because SURPRISE, THE CAKES WERE WRONG. White icing with a weird brown border, and the icing looks spotty and gross. Too late to do anything at that point. I waited a week and contacted Piece of Cake, who said the owner- WHO HAD PREVIOUSLY INSULTED ME, could call me back. I reluctantly agreed. She called me, saying it was MY FAULT for not choosing a \\"wedding cake\\" in the first place and went round in circles with me until I said I needed to move on from the experience and ended the call. I then got a TEXT MESSAGE FROM THE OWNER AT 10 PM the same night apologizing and asking to talk again. I promptly hit \\"report as spam\\" to block her number and was in awe that she would think texting an angry customer at 10 pm was appropriate. THIS IS NOT HOW YOU DO BUSINESS.

The heating system was very loud when it was running. I called again and was moved a few doors down. The windows had the same problem, and still hard to heat the room. It takes running it, which is very loud, at 80 for a long time. This will get it up to something I'm betting in the high 60s. \\nThe other problem which makes me sad - is despite being told at check-in who was in the room, looking at my drivers license and checking in my credit card they do not seem to know I am here. My mother made the initial reservation, IN MY NAME. She tried to pay for the room as well, but they said no that was only to hold the reservation.

My check-in experience has mostly been bad for the several times I've visited as there seems to be no sense of etiquette or respect with the line and any random person can just cut in. And it doesn't help that the people who've already informed the receptionist are just spread out randomly standing or seated so you won't be able to keep track - and that's when I had reservations booked too. It would be nice if they had some stubbing system going on for the queue. Some of the servers are attentive while some are dismissive. I personally think the chubby server (sorry! I didn't get to ask her name) has been the most diligent and courteous and she actually gets the orders right. Check out and paying the bill was a hassle the last time because the terminal was down and the people in line were suggested to pay in cash, but I waited it out because...credit card points are good. Overall, worth the few bumps on the path to glorious unlimited dining for a fair price.\\n\\nFwiw, I've been spoiled with Manila/Philippine buffets that have so much variety for crazy cheap prices (just check Youtube - Korean Grills, Spiral buffet, Niu, or Vikings) and Shabusen is the only one I've been satisfied with in relation to the price.

They have all been pretty recent, within the last two months, but I had a vastly different experience.  Some guy gave one of my roommates the menu yesterday, and since it was free delivery (over 8 dollars) all my roommates and I decided to try this place out.  We each ordered a panini, a vanilla frozen yogurt with a toping, and we got two humus and pita sides to share.  I'm not sure how much pita there was initially when the food came (they gave an estimate of 45 minutes, but I believe it was closer to 30), but by the time I sat down my roommates were raving about the humus (both the huge amount and how amazing it was) and there wasn't a lot of pita bread left, which was honestly my only disappointment with the order.  The humus was awesome--I don't know what they put in it, but it was really something special!  My panini was fantastic, but we were all raving about our own paninis around the table, so I know it wasn't just mine.  The sourdough bread had rosemary in it, which gave it an extra boost in flavor.  We opened our big frozen yogurt containers, and unlike most fro-yo places which give you the base and toppings separately and you have to stir them in, each of ours were blended together with our vanilla base.  Everything was exceptional; I don't know if it is because they apparently opened recently and have only now gotten their act together, or if they saw the reviews here and decided to step things up, but I encourage everyone to give it another try."},{"name":"Every Ting Jerk","address":"235 Plymouth St","city":"Holbrook","stars":"4.5","text":"The place was clean and the staff were polite.

Upon the first few bites, you would think that this lacks spice, but the spice build up becomes quite strong after finishing the entire dish. I think that they control this aspect of the dish very well to allow you to keep wanting to eat it. My only critique is that the fish could be more fresh as I believe it was previously frozen, but I can't complain for the price.\\nSize: Good for 2-3 people.

The matcha flavor on the matcha drinks is too light for my taste, but I really enjoyed the fresh fruit. The Sunrise was a bit too tart; I really like unsweetened fruit teas and I'm used to the tartness, but it really would taste a lot better with a bit of sugar. Or fruits with more sugar in them. The boba was chewy and as it should be, and the almond jelly was interesting. Each drink is $6.42 post-tax whether you want toppings (boba or almond jelly) or not. The owner is super friendly as is one of the people who work here (although she's leaving in a few months). It seems like they have a lot of return customers, which is cool. I also thought the space was really strange to have a boba shop, because there aren't really any chairs or tables for people to hang out in.

That holds true here at the Little Donkey. If you are okay with that, I think you can get a good dining experience here, because the tapas are tasty. \\n\\nMy friends and I got 5 dishes:\\n\\nEverything Parker House Rolls - the dish my friend called the secret to not feeling hungry after eating tapas (since bread fills you up). The rolls were warm and soft, and I loved the fried garlic and shallots on top. Pair that with some butter, and I'm not sure what else you could want with rolls. \\n\\nGrilled Iberian Pork Secreto - I usually don't have high expectations for pork since I don't eat high quality pork that often, so this pork did surprise me a little. It reminded me of all the nice parts of a pork chop dish you would order at a nice steak house. \\n\\nPickle Brine Fried Chicken Sandwich - Its not Howlin Rays level of fried chicken (the crispiness of the chicken isn't quite there), but it was pretty good in terms of flavor. I liked the avocado ranch and buffalo sauce on the hot and messy version of this sandwich. I think they did a good job of adding heat to this sandwich (buffalo sauce, jalape√±os) without actually making it too spicy. \\n\\nManti (Istanbul Neat Ravioli) - probably my favorite dish, this actually reminds me of the dumplings in chili sauce you can get at Szechuan restaurants (I love these dumplings) since the meat inside the ravioli had a strong lamb flavor and the red pepper butter is similar to chili oil. The garlic sour cream, lamb meat, and butter made for a delicious combination. \\n\\nGrilled Hanger Steak - this was fine. The steak was cooked well (medium) and it tasted good overall. Not the biggest fan of horseradish butter though, and I think I would have liked a better sear. \\n\\nThe service was a bit slow and they also gave us the wrong check at first, but the staff was friendly and helpful. \\n\\nWould I come back again? Probably. There's still a lot of tapas that I would like to try out at some point, and it seems like they do get rotated often enough. Exploring a variety of small dishes is fun."},{"name":"The Cheesecake Factory","address":"100 Cambridgeside Pl","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3","text":"The service was not good at all.... below average of the other Cheescake!I I like this brand of restaurant and this is the last of my list!"},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"A must experience when in Boston!

It did not leave a lasting impression; however, the portion size is definitely generous though and shareable.\\n\\nThe chicken was prepared well and there was plenty of sauce to go with the the chicken was also plentiful, however not very flavorful. I wasn't expecting an explosion of flavor, but something more to distinguish this apart from the other Korean Fried Chicken locations around the city.

When you are seated at your table, you are promptly given some tea, but there is no menu for ordering.

Thus, it is difficult to know what your options are and what you have ordered. We tried 7 items which ranged from nearly inedible to passable. We were also given a spicy sauce which was quite spicy but had a weak body.

We decided to eat some good Texas barbecue while we were there, and we started with dinner at Lamberts.  Lamberts is fancy barbecue, so if you're looking for a down-home Southern feel, I would look elsewhere.  We knew going in, though, that this place was an upscale, cosmopolitan restaurant.  We had a fantastic dinner.  The setting was casually elegant, and the barbecue was still very much comfort food, hearty and delicious.\\n\\nI liked the cool decor and relaxed atmosphere.  We got a roomy booth for our party of five, and we felt right at home.  The service was great.  Our waiter was helpful and patient, and the food came out at a good pace.  There was one unfortunate event during our meal - one of the exposed pipes rained on us at the end of our meal.  We were lucky that we were done eating at that point.  Management came over to apologize (and assure us it was not toilet water), and we got our desserts comped.  The water was unpleasant, but they did handle the situation admirably well.  Anyway, that little mishap was not the defining moment of the meal.  Everything else was truly excellent.\\n\\nI drank red wine and a cocktail with my dinner, and both were very good.  I loved the Killer Bee's Knees, a drink with mezcal, tequila, honey syrup, and fresh lemon.  It was smooth and smokey with a little bite and a little sugar, just the kind of cocktail I like to sip on, with or without food.\\n\\nWe ate everything family style, and this was both easy to do and highly enjoyable.  We kicked off our meal with a plate of jalape√±o cornbread muffins with butter.  They were delicious, lightly hot and sweet and loaded with butter.  We ordered spicy deviled eggs and crispy wild boar ribs as appetizers, and these were great starters.  The deviled eggs gave creaminess and a supple chew, with smoked paprika and a salty burst of American caviar on top.  The middle of the plate held a medley of olives, cornichons, caperberries, jalape√±o, and pickled pearl onions to perk up each bite.  The boar ribs were delectable, smeared sticky with a glaze of honey and sambal.  They were tender and meaty with a lot of bold flavor.  The ribs came in a pile, served with blue cheese in a crumble and a sauce, with a celery and daikon slaw to lighten things up.  They were a definite highlight of the meal.\\n\\nBut the real fun came in the straight barbecue portion of our dinner, when we got all the meats and sauces and a la carte sides.  We ordered the natural Black Angus brisket, the housemade jalape√±o hot links, the half local chicken, and the Niman Ranch ribeye.  There were no duds in this spread.  The brisket was tender with a nice crust, rubbed in brown sugar and coffee.  The hot links had a great snap and a deep, gratifying smokiness.  I wasn't excited about the chicken, but it was moist and flavorful, with a pleasant achiote and lime rub.  The best dish of the night, though, was the mustard and brown sugar crusted ribeye, served with a whole roasted garlic bulb.  That was one of the best steaks I've had in recent memory, a perfect tender medium rare that spilled flavor with every easy chew.  The sweet and pungent cloves of soft garlic did nothing to hurt its case.\\n\\nWe enjoyed our meats with Lamberts' trio of housemade sauces, a traditional barbecue, a mustard with ketchup and jalape√±o, and a hot sauce made with habanero and red jalape√±o.  I couldn't pick a favorite, so I used them all.  For our sides, we had the baked mac and three cheeses, the fried okra with spicy remoulade, and the saut√©ed lemon spinach.  The mac and cheese was particularly impressive.  Lamberts has a good recipe, one I wish they would share with restaurants closer to home.  The noodles were cooked firm, and the gooey cheese was full of flavor.  The okra and spinach were nice vegetable sides, but not really essential to the meal.\\n\\nFor dessert, we had red plum fried pie, warm ricotta cheesecake, and fancy banana pudding.  Dessert was not the high point of the meal, but it was still very good.  The plum fried pie was warm and tart, with a heavy turnover crust dusted with powdered sugar.  It was served with candied corn kernels and fresh slices of plum, along with a summer corn ice cream, supposedly.  If there was ice cream on that plate, it was the melted sweet sauce on the side, and I don't mean that in a disparaging way - I just think the kitchen left out that component.  The pie was still good, but I missed the ice cream.  The cheesecake in a glass was a better dessert, with a honey pine nut crust and a topping of local peach preserves.  Not too sweet, with a great spoonable texture.  My favorite, though, was the banana pudding with Nilla wafers, caramelized Krispies, and cashew cream.  It was sweet and creamy and loaded with banana.\\n\\nI loved all the barbecue we ate in Austin, and though I'd recommend Lamberts behind Salt Lick and Franklin's, it was perfect for upscale barbecue.  I would love to eat here again."},{"name":"Zaftigs Delicatessen - Brookline","address":"335 Harvard St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"Zaftigs is a classic brunch/lunch spot in Brookline.

Fresh donuts, made to order, with about 5 different flavors at a given time.  \\n\\nIt's a small shop with very limited seating so I'd prepare to take your donuts to-go...but don't go too far, cause you're gonna want to dive in right away. \\n\\nThe donuts are small, bite-sized and fried just enough to create a golden, crunchy exterior while leaving the inside soft and cakey.  I wanted a good variety so I ordered the cinnamon sugar, Nutella & sea salt, and lemon Meyer & pear butter donuts. They were all solid. I was never a big fan of the salted caramel craze (I've found most salted caramel creations to be too salty) but Pip's Nutella & sea salt does the sweet/salty combo really nicely and the salt is much needed to keep the donut from feeling overly sweet and indulgent. My favorite was probably the lemon Meyer donut; the curd provided a wonderful tanginess to balance the sweetness of the donut.  I ordered a matcha latte to wash it all down and that it light, frothy, and really green tea-y. \\n\\nPrices are reasonable and you get a 20% discount with your Yelp check-in.

We didn't hear about Mother's until a few locals were talking about it being one of the best brunches of their lives and perfect for a snow day crab sesh.

No excuses, brunch like a champion!\\n\\nDuring the holidays we were reading up on home made cinnamon rolls, and let me tell you, there are a lot of ingredients and a LOT of love that goes into them.

As we tore into it we could see the layers slowly breaking away from one another like they were holding on to a good hug. And that's exactly what this tasted like - a hug from your mother. So comforting. So satisfying. So loving. It was so good, I *almost* cried. \\n\\nORDER THE CINNAMON ROLL IF IT IS THE LAST THING YOU EVER DO. \\n\\nWe also opted for the standard two eggs, bacon, biscuit combo.

Thick cut, salty, and crispy just the way bacon should be. \\n\\nBut here's where Mother's steps up their game: brunch cocktails. \\n\\nNow we are all a fan of brunch cocktails, but Mother's brunch cocktail game is on another level. They have an entire page of coffee cocktail concoctions and the bar is basically a barista station of brunch cocktails with an organized chaos like you have never seen before. I don't know why but I never remember this and always opt for the mimosa or a bloody mary. We went with a bailey's style drink with fresh whipped cream and a cinnamon/sugar rim and it was deeeeelightful. We were so inspired we went out and bought the ingredients to replicate a few of their coffee cocktails. They also have a regular mimosa menu complete with different juices or you can get a MEGA mimosa in a pint glass (which we all secretly want to begin with - like a good mother, they can read your mind and know what you want)  \\n\\nI wish Mother's was in my city because I would hit this place harrrrrd.

The sky would be chicken parm, the rivers would run wide with DOCG Super Tuscan, and the mountains would be bufala. The food at Parma is better than a hug from your mom. Emilio is low key the most hilarious man in Louisville. Molto bene. Perfetto. Il massimo. Bravi."},{"name":"Chipotle Mexican Grill","address":"4311 NE Thurston Way, Ste 200","city":"Vancouver","stars":"2.5","text":"I love Chipotle but was totally blown away by the dirty empty tables on my way to the patio.  A few minutes later I went back into the restaurant  which was NOT busy & mentioned to one of the employees how dirty the tables were. When I finished my meal I purposely went back thru the restaurant to see if they had cleaned any tables,  Not one table had  been cleaned.  This was on Sunday eve. about 8PM 7/21/19.  Where are the managers overseeing the employees?  I will think twice about visiting another Chipotle."},{"name":"Hot Chicken Takeover","address":"59 Spruce St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"Has it really been over 3 years since I've been here?!  I was surprised when I purchased a tee shirt I received a free meal. I'm a dark meat type of girl. My sides were baked beans and coleslaw. I enjoyed the new side of baked beans not to spicy not to sweet just right for my taste buds. As much as I love that banana pudding I was too stuffed after eating my meal. I'll need to remember on my next trip to eat the pudding first. Dessert first will be my new foodie adventure."}]`),D={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:P},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:z,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(s=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return s.name.toLowerCase().includes(e)||s.city.toLowerCase().includes(e)||s.text.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},H={class:"search-container"},E={class:"card-container"},j=["disabled"],L={key:0},R={key:1};function N(s,e,n,f,i,r){const c=p("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"üéâ Restaurant Reviews ü•≥")])],-1)),t("div",H,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"üîç",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=h=>i.searchQuery=h),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[v,i.searchQuery]])]),t("div",E,[(a(!0),o(y,null,m(r.filteredPoems,(h,g)=>(a(),k(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:i.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...h)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...h))},[i.isLoading?(a(),o("span",R,"Loading...")):(a(),o("span",L,"See more"))],8,j)):w("",!0)])}const F=u(D,[["render",N],["__scopeId","data-v-09760f79"]]),V=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/6.md","filePath":"quotes/6.md"}'),G={name:"quotes/6.md"},U=Object.assign(G,{setup(s){return(e,n)=>(a(),o("div",null,[I(F)]))}});export{V as __pageData,U as default};
