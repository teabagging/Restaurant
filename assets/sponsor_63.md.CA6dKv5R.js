They put beets on their cheeseburgers instead of pickles - sometimes a fried egg is in there too.  (Imagine my surprise the first time I ordered a cheeseburger with everything on it) The food combines influences of traditional British fare, pacific rim, Indian, and southeast Asia.  There's also a lot of lamb.  A LOT of lamb.\\n\\nFlaky little round, flat meat pies are available at coffee shops, kiosks, convenience stores, pretty much everywhere in Australia.  They come in little paper envelopes that people just hold and eat with their hands.  A lot like to top the pie with some 'to-mah-to' sauce (distinctly sweeter and less vinegary than ketchup).  Meat pies in Oz are pretty much as common as burgers are in the US.\\n\\nIt was interesting to go to a restaurant specializing in Aussie-style meat pies. I wasn't sure what to think really.  Seemed like an unusual thing to for a restaurant in Austin to specialize in.   I've been a few times now and I'm pretty pleased.  \\n\\nAn incredibly nice, mellow dude runs the shop whenever I go in.  He's always pleasant and efficient.  Even today when there were at *least* 30 6th graders running around the place and he was the only one working.  He just took it in stride, being nice as pie (ha) to every single kid and customer.\\n\\nThe pies are a bit larger than the standard Aussie pie, and the crust is a thicker.  This isn't bad I just noticed the distinction.  The crust is still flaky.  There's a variety of flavors ranging from Southwest Veggie to Chicken Curry.  \\n\\nSo far my favorite has been the plain old steak and mushroom.  And hell yes I want that served as a 'floater' - topped with mashed potatoes and gravy why bother even asking?\\n\\nThey sell frozen pies to take home - I think it's 4 pies for 20 dollars.  My friend loves taking the frozen ones home but I thought they took way too long to heat up for my taste.  I could roll out dough and make my own pie in the time it takes to cook up a frozen one.\\n\\nI've tried some of the other options - the thai chicken, southwest, and the ground beef pie.  None of them did it for me like the simple steak and mushroom.  Maybe it was because I bought these other flavors frozen and cooked them myself?\\n\\nIn any case it's always a fun place to go to lunch with a friend."},{"name":"Red Oven Pizza Bakery","address":"6000 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"I was reading a lot of negative reviews about this place which almost made me pass on this place but decided to try it anyway we ordered 3 different pizzas and a salad pizzas are very reasonably priced and Caesar salad was a good portion I guess my expectations weren't high but kids liked  it and so did my wife good quick eat"},{"name":"India Grill","address":"2924 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I was a bit worried about eating here after reading all the negative reviews, but I'm happy to say that I was pleasantly surprised! The servers weren't the best I've ever dealt with, but we got everything we ordered in a timely manner, so I can't complain too much about that.\\n\\nMy friends and I showed up on Friday night and the place was packed. The waiting area is tiny and we had to stand awkwardly on the staircase while we waited for a table to open up. We wondered if we should leave, since no one came to tell us how long the wait might be, but it wasn't too long before we were seated at a nice table by the windows. We ordered some samosas, naan, three chicken dishes and the matar paneer for me. \\n\\nThe samosas (tied with fresh salad rolls & peanut sauce for my favorite appetizer in the world) lived up to my high expectations. Crispy and salty on the outside, they were full of potatoey goodness and tasted delicious with the tamarind and spicy mint chutneys that were served with them. The rice and naan came next. The rice was great, but the naan scored low points because it was a bit dry. This was probably a good thing, since good naan inspires me to fill up on it until I don't have room for the main course! Maybe they do it on purpose?\\n\\nFinally, the main course arrived. I'm a vegetarian so I didn't get to try my friends' dishes, but they seemed pleased and my dish was certainly awesome! Matar paneer is peas and cubes of cheese in a spicy(ish) yogurt sauce. I don't normally care for peas that much (at least not enough to base a whole meal on them), but this is one of my favorite dishes, and India Grill does it pretty well. I love paneer, but the sauce in this dish is definitely the star. It's wonderfully aromatic and creamy, with just the right amount of heat.\\n \\nSome people on Yelp have claimed the portions here are too small. I'm not saying they're huge, but everyone in my group was completely full by the time we left. If you're worried about the portion size, just get an order of samosas. They're so good that you could make a meal of them all on their own, and they'll help fill you up in case the main course isn't quite enough to do it for you."},{"name":"Pad Thai Cuisine","address":"1201 Barbara Jordan Blvd, Ste 1220","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Food was pretty good and service was great!

Vegetable Tempura is a basic yardstick by which you can measure a Japanese joint.  Kenobi passes for light batter and just-right time in the frying pan.  The Chicken Lollipops are fun and tasty.  Think crab cakes made with chicken instead and served on a sugar cane skewer.  Meat on a stick.  Yes indeed.  End the first course with the lump crab gyoza.  The dumplings are filled with lump crab meat and goat cheese; our table agreed that this was the best appetizer.\\n\\nI would like to have ordered nabayaki udon, but Kenobi is following a disturbing trend of being a Japanese restaurant that does not offer this signature Japanese dish.  I liken it to a NY deli not having a corned beef sammich on the menu.  Unacceptable.  (Hopefully it gets added to the menu after the restaurant moves from soft launch status).\\n\\nFortunately, the fantastic specialty rolls made up for the lack of my favorite non-fish dish.  The Crunch, which each restaurant seems to tweak a bit, was typical and met expectations.  The Brandy features shrimp tempura, smoked salmon and avocado toped with eel sauce and seasame seeds.  The taste was solid and led to a three-way discussion of who would get the honor of chomping the last piece.  The Seven-and-a-Half was easily a nine on a ten point taste scale.  Tuna, salmon and yellowtail anchor this roll which was topped with eel sauce and spicy mayo.  \\n\\nThe best-in-show award goes the Millennium roll.  I normally don't like cooked fish of any kind if it is accompanied by raw fish.  But, the peppercorn seared tuna added a savory element to this dish.

I just went there with a friend this evening and every time we needed something we had to call them over. Hello can you please refill our water?? Can you please pick up our bill? Can you please take our order?? \\n\\n2. Timing- they are painfully slow at preparing the sushi. Don't get me wrong, they do a great job at preparing it, but it shouldn't take 45 minutes. Plus, it's not a high end restaurant so presentation is not expected to be perfection. They also brought out one roll at a time so my friend finished her meal by the time mine arrived.\\n\\n3. Decor- very bland, not exciting, TV's are on in the background, which is wierd for a Japanese place. It's not a sports bar!\\n\\n4. Price- a little high for this type of place. Usually costs me about $20 including tip.

I got the 100 day aged steak and my girlfriend go the Kobe cap steak.  The cap steak was definitely the better one as it was moist and tender and cooked perfectly.  My steak was much fattier but was still delicious.  We ordered sides of asparagus, mashed potatoes and the truffle tots (we really only needed 2).  \\n\\nWhile the meal was expensive, it was definitely the best meal I've had in downtown Boston and the atmosphere and location was certainly worth the price for a night out and a special occasion.

Right off the bat, let me say that it's nothing amazing; they are, however, consistent, cheap, open late and relatively close.  I also prefer their pizza to most close and similarly-priced local competition (Mellow Mushroom, Mama Niki's, etc.).  \\n\\nYou can order pizza by the slice, and if you do this, know that they put the toppings on par-baked plain cheese slices and re-bake them to completion.  If you order a full pizza, it is cooked once from scratch the usual way.   This makes the single slices taste somewhat different from slices of a full pizza.   \\n\\nAnyway, their menu is pretty simple.  They have a la carte large pizza slices with optional toppings and full pizzas.  They also have \\"Sicilian\\" slices (and full pizzas) which are baked on very thick crust.  Finally, they have side salads and calzones.  \\n\\nPersonally, I stick with a couple of regular slices with simple ingredients.  I find their toppings hit or miss.  Some toppings I like at other pizza places I don't like at Fellini's.  In particular, something tastes off about the flavor of their Vegetarian slices, but I can't put my finger on it.  Their calzones are okay, but the balance of ricotta and mozzarella tends to be inconsistent and I'm not a huge fan of their ricotta.  I tend to look elsewhere for calzones.  A Sicilian slice once and a while can be okay, but really it's just a lot of crust.  It'd be better with some marinara for dipping.  So, mostly, I stick with a pair of regular slices.\\n\\nAnyway, Fellini's is fine by me.

Kind of interesting(?), but way too pricey and just... not good.\\n\\nDumplings are one of my very favorite foods, so when I heard this place was coming to within five minutes of my office, I was excited.  I showed up the day before and sent pictures to my wife, I scouted the menu and reviews of other locations.  The concept looked great on paper, and they clearly had success in previous locations. Excited, I say.\\n\\nYou can get all the location and handmade bun details elsewhere.  The bottom line for me is that it's a ton of dough for very little filling, and at around $3 a bun, it's expensive. I guess it's more filling than other buns, but the dough is not why i get dumplings! Especially this dough.  It was like someone crossed a steamed pork bun with a parker house roll and under-cooked it by about 3 minutes. \\n\\nMy wife and I had (thankfully) decided to try 1 each of three different kinds of bao (lobster, sweet potato, curry beef), and ate them in the park across the street.

There's not much complexity in these dumplings for 10 for $5 is an extremely satisfying meal. \\n\\nThe pork and leek is my favorite as I think it's a bit juicier than the other options.

Well, eating at Casa De Luz is what I would imagine eating in a nice Yoga studio would feel like.  \\n\\nAnd this is a review coming from a die-hard Japanese fascist right-winger who WILL NEVER EVER VOTE DEMOCRAT.  Remember that for a second and you will just know how good Casa De Luz is that it attracts fanatical right-wingers like myself when you think that almost everyone who goes there has completely opposite political ideology.  OK, so the founders of Macrobiotic movement were also Japanese, like me, but whatever, I've only ever seen white people eating at Casa De Luz, a strange but not too disconcerting event.  All the workers are also, um, how best to put it, very, very tan.  They are very nice, but I can't help but notice the divide between the tan people cooking and the non-tan people eating and managing.  \\n\\nAt $12 a head it is a bit pricey but remember that it is a non-profit organization that doesn't follow the rules of CAPITALISM and instead follows the rules of devotion to nature.  NON-PROFIT.  Get that in your freaking right-wing capitalist numb-nut heads people who complain about the price.  \\n\\nThe food is refreshing as it is tasty.

Was it the best breakfast taco I've ever had? Nah. Taco Shack is in no way Mexican or spot-hittingly yummy. Was it fresh and tasty? Hell yeah! Those eggs were prepared perfectly. That cheese was fresh, real, and melty. the taco price point is about $2, and the size makes the price more than reasonable. Anyone complaining that they can get two tacos for the same price at a Mexican stand- sure, but those two tacos still won't be as packed full of overflowing egginess as one Taco Shack snack. Really.\\n\\nI've also tried their breakfast bowls- any toppings of your choosing layered in a taco-size portioned bowl. Also very tasty, but for the higher price and same amount of food as a taco? Not recommended.\\n\\nThe salsa, by the way, is terrific. Great flavor with an actual bit of a bite. Again, not the best, but certainly satisfying. \\n\\nIs Taco Shack better than other options in the area? No. I can get tastier, cheaper options elsewhere.

Another girl got the scampi which she said had a good amount of shrimp in it and two others got steak. They said their steak was decent but nothing to write home about. My self and the last member of our group didn't get our food because the waitress forgot to put it in. She went to check and realized she forgot to ring it in. I appreciate her honesty about it and telling us rather than blaming anyone else. I was only asked once if I'd like another drink and that was once my food (which came out after 3 of the four had gotten their food finished). My friend got the swordfish and he said it was just ok, not very impressed with the flavor. I got the salmon which didn't seem to have much flavor. Honestly the only good part of my meal was the asparagus and mashed potatoes. It was very disappointing. The waitress again apologized for forgetting which again I looooove that, but I was shocked that none of the manager(s) came out to apologize or talk to us. Shocks me!

Changs and a co-worker told me about this place.  We arrived to a really beautiful, albeit slightly small, asian restaurant and were immediately seated.  I noticed they have a really nice patio outside with tables and chairs with umbrellas.  We were seated inside however.  I ordered the lunch version of the Pad Thai combo with Beef, Chicken and Shrimp.  I was then asked...something..wasn't sure what because the lady had a really thick accent but eventually my co-worker and I figured out she was asking if I wanted a salad or soup.  I chose the hot and sour soup.  I also ordered a spicy salmon roll.  \\n\\nThe hot and sour soup came out shortly thereafter and it was fantastic.  It was the best hot and sour soup I've had in a long time, only one place that I can think of in Virginia has better hot and sour soup.  I would have liked a bit more sour and it would have been the best ever.  It was FILLED with tons of mushrooms and other \\"stuff\\" that they put into hot and sour soup..  \\n\\nThe spicy salmon sushi was next and it was really good, although not very spicy.  The sushi itself was presented very neatly and wrapped tightly and had a lot of filling in there.  Like I said, I could have used just a bit more spice but the wasabi took care of that for me.  And lastly my entree, the lunch pad thai combo, arrived and it was awesome presentation (see picture).  The portion size was just perfect and everything was excellent.  The noodles were cooked perfectly and it had plenty of meat in it.  Some of the meat was slightly fatty but not terrible, just be aware.  Also, I would have liked a bit more shrimp (I got 2) but for the price it was a good value I think.  My friend got the Ronin Delight (see picture) and he really liked his as well.\\n\\nAll in all I had an excellent, huge meal and the bill only came to $13 (without tip) so you can't beat that.

I call again, and he says \\"OH OKAY HOLD\\" hangs up on me, and I see him creeping around the corner out of where the drive in gate is, which I explicitly asked him not to use, and although there is tons of space for him to pull over near the side walk, he stops RIGHT in the MIDDLE of the road and holds the food out to me through his window, forcing me to cross the road because he's on the other side. There are cars. Lots of cars. \\nI look at him and ask him to pull over because there are cars behind him and opposite and he says \\"yea yea okay yea\\" and doesn't move, but continues to hold the food out through his window.

I'd definitely get the black beans again, and next time I'd like to try the Spanish white beans w/ sun-dried tomatoes & spinach. \\n\\nSWAHILI SHRIMP CURRY W/ CHOPPED MANGOES- $13.95\\nServed over Basmati rice, this was another tasty dish - I just wish it were served temperature hot.

It couldn't be bad again, right? Wrong. I Decided to go with something savory this time, having been burned by the sweets. I went with the sausage, egg and cheese biscuit.  I have never been served a biscuit that was so overcooked. I'm pretty sure biscuits aren't supposed to be dark brown. I can't believe they don't get more complaints.

After they sorted that out we were seated by the manager. The manger told us about a vent that was blowing cold air and he said he would take care of it. We were given our menus and had 15-30 minutes to look at the menu then met our waiter 10 minutes after that. We ordered 4 ceaser salads and 2 house salads2 steaks 2 scallops and 2 pork chops and one kids noodles. 30 minutes later we got bread that was marginal and we were denied (complements of the kitchen) aka time wasters twice. All through that time the air vent kept getting worse and we informed multiple people many times. We figured out that a party of 12 was waiting and needed our table fast so things picked up halfway through our salads. We were rushed into our entree. The only thing warm was the kid noodles. The pork chops weren't cooked right and everything else was cold. All the sides tasted horrific as well. While all this was going on I was litteraly going through hypothermia with 2 heavy jackets on me and several trips to the luke warm fire place. The table of 12 had to be seated somewhere else because our waiter was litteraly waiting on everyone else in the resturaunt was walking around setting up and taking down the same tables the whole time we where there. The hostess had to come help as well. The staff that wasn't doing anything where sitting around yawning. We finally finished our horrific food with the manager already offering us free deserts. The manager asked us if we wanted to look at the desert menu and we said yes the two times we were asked. We ordered ice cream and the bannana foster for two(actually every one ordered their own because they were so hungry.) It\\ntook us 30 minutes to get our bite sized ice cream and get our check. The total ended up as about $375. We got there at 5:30 and left at 10:00.

She didn't really want either, but settled for a flatbread since she is hungry. \\n\\nOnce she finished with her sandwich, Tracy asked me what I would like. I stated a six inch, spicy Italian on wheat.

We weren't even brought water until 10 minutes after we were seated (we almost walked out), and our waitress didn't even acknowledge us. Finally she came over us and said, I'll be with you soon, I have food up now. Rather than take our drink and appetizer order quickly, she came over to tell us that we would wait longer. So, we waited and waited and finally we ordered, but she was rushing us and ran off before we could even order drinks. It was ridiculous.

As a table for one (this was a work trip so I was alone, though this is the exact kind of place you take someone very special who loves food adventures as much as you do) you know you may inconvenience them, so when they asked if I'd like to be sat at a table with two other groups of two I didn't mind one bit. We were placed around a round table and opened the menu to see what to get.\\n\\nOne of the couples at my table was a regular, so they didn't even look.

I knew right what to order, once again thanks to Yelp. \\n\\nIf you want to stick with the famed dishes: order the wings and the butter beef. That's the money. And it's an incredible combination. You get the vinegary sauce with the beef, the sweet and tang of the wings, and the savory of the beef. It's a one-two punch that put my tastebuds on notice. \\n\\nNow, I don't get too much Cambodian food in my neck of the woods, and the Vietnamese I get is pretty mainstream... but my lack of experience is not borne out of a lack of desire.

The service was top notch. Our main server was Linda but other wait staff also serviced us. Linda and everyone was so friendly and made sure you had a good experience  The food is amazing. Lobster Bisque was delicious. 8oz Filet was delightful and the 24 oz American Waygu Rib Eye was a amazing cut of meat. Perfect salt crust and amazing taste. Now I've never had Waygu and can't compare it to anyrhing. It wasn't butter tender where you didn't need a knife but it was one of the most tender rib eyes I've had. It was worth every penny. When the steak came Linda asked for me to cut into the steak to make sure it was to my liking but it was on the rare side and I asked for Mid rare. She took extra care to make sure a expensive cut of meat was right and perfect.  I could have  been annoyed for it not being cooked right but i appreciated her effort and care. For sides definitely go with the cream Kale. So so good and the Cheddar, bacon mash was good too. The Chocolate cake was pretty good as well. Deserts are big portion so one is perfect for sharing. Only thing that can be improved upon is the house salad that comes with your entree. It was a bit wilted and soggy. Also, in the middle of eating our salads and soup the entrees came out.

But there was way too much dough for the amount of filling. As such... Even when taking a forkful from the middle, I could taste more bread than filling. \\n\\nThe dough is a little gooey, I would prefer it a little firmer, but that is a matter of preference \\n\\nSince they keep them in steam heaters, they come out very warm...

However, bf didn't like his paella, which was a bit bland -- white rice, white seafood and meat, white broth and tons of peas.

Yeah I was disappointed about that and they weren't even delicious. My bf ordered a beer that he liked and I ordered the Heckle and Jeckle off there \\"house favorites\\" part of the menu and it was just not what I was expecting at all. To me, it tasted like a hand grenade, kind of gross. It was decorated nicely though!\\n\\nOur server was nice though and when I told her I didn't really like my drink she offered me something else instead which was sweet.

Opening a restaurant with a bar, new menu, new chef, in a new space is going to be a little sloppy at first.  My main course arrived before my appetizers.  Not the end of the world, but not unexpected either.  I would give them another month or so to get a rhythm going, and then everything will fall in to place service wise.\\n\\nFor my appetizer I had the buffalo wings, and the sliders.  The wings were tasty; although I love them when they are super hot.  These were medium spicy which is perfect for the average Newton patron.  The sliders were a bit overdone, but the good news is that the mini rolls were very tasty, and the caramelized onions were good.  The good news is that overdone is easily corrected, and I suspect will be once the kinks are ironed out.\\n\\nFor my main course I had the Hamburger with Swiss Cheese and Bacon.  The roll was very good, the burger was done exactly the way I wanted it, the meat was tasty and very fresh, and the cheese and bacon were excellent.  I had 2 small complaints:  1. The tomato slice was tiny and there was only one, and 2. There was only one small piece of lettuce.  Both should be in greater abundance which would allow me to decide how much of each I want on my burger.  Not a big deal, but should be corrected.

As an avid sushi connoisseur, the sushi is fine but absolutely nothing special. I stick to their classic rolls, as I prefer more traditional sushi. I'm a fan of their salmon skin roll. It has a good thickness of salmon left on the skin, so it's not too crunchy. They could work on their knife work with their nigiri and sashimi; the cut is often messy and sliced too thin. As a heads up, their \\"spicy\\" sushi rolls (ex. spicy scallop) is actually pretty spicy for sushi--it overpowers the fish. \\nMy biggest issue is with the service. On multiple occasions, I've ordered a roll only to have something different brought to the table. I'm sure if I complained they'd bring the correct roll, but the wait is often too long to sit through another round of waiting. They also have happy hour where they market their specialty rolls as buy one get one half off and their nigiri as $1.50. I went with a group and ordered a number of nigiri. My impression was that I was ordering one nigiri for the price of $1.50; this was what the waitress explained to our table. The plate arrived and there were two nigiri. We were charged $3.00, multiplied by all of the various nigiri we ordered. We inquired about the price difference. The waitress then said that it's $1.50 for one but you're automatically made to order two. So really, it's $3.00 for a pair of nigiri...which is how the advertisement should read. You cannot order a single piece of nigiri for $1.50. I felt it was really shady and a bit of a bait and switch. It's still an ok deal for some of the nigiri, but I'd rather just go somewhere more honest with better tasting sushi. I also ordered unagi nigiri and that for whatever reason was $5.50--so I guess some nigiri doesn't qualify for happy hour.

We ordered a bottle of wine and garlic bread (at a near outrageous price tag of $8 for something you normally receive for free) to start.

On a high note the butter had hints of honey that made it slightly more rich than normal.  \\n         For dinner we ordered: the pork belly and Kimchi, half chicken and seafood stew.  The Pork Belly was well cooked and the combination of flavor worked well for the dish. The Seafood Stew, however, included a handful of undercooked bivalves and was lacking any real flavor.  While mussels that are still able to sing to you are unappetizing the chicken was possibly the definition of poultry mediocrity. Dry, tasteless and unappealing the best part of this dish was the squash and zucchini succatash, which oddly enough, did not resemble any succatash I have ever seen. \\n        With a total price tag of over $100 for three people the food underdelivered and the kitchen seems horribly inconsistent with quality from dish to dish.

In fact, my friends were so impressed, they went back again before leaving town.  It helped that the traffic was nonexistant or our waiter was just that good.  He was able to make good wine suggestions for my friend but was clueless in discussing beer choices for me.  I don't usually order chicken out (because chicken is for the ambivalent) but I wanted to get the cheapest thing that sounded good since the friends were buying.  The skillet seared chicken breast was perfectly prepared - juicy yet done.  My friends ahi tuna tartar was also perfect according to him (but can you really screw that up?).  The salmon plate got a big thumbs up.  We could have gone looking for another place to go drinking after dinner but we hunkered down because the people and ambience made us feel comfortable and welcome yet gave us the thrill you want from a new (to us), hipper place.

They were having a 'Grand Opening' promotion - a large pizza with sauce and cheese and 2 toppings of your choice for $7.99.  Okay, be honest, I'm not the only one that's a sucker for 'Grand Opening' promotion, right?  Does that serve as an excuse to toss my new year's toast blazin' out the window?  No, but I'm trying to convince/console myself that it was somewhat justifiable that as a Yelper, I must try out new things and places so that I can fulfill my duty... *sigh*...\\n\\nAnyways, the place was small or cozy, some would describe it, but it had few tables for the ones that wanted to dine-in.  There was one picture that decorated wall - a framed picture of someone (assuming it's 'Marco') with Adam (don't remember the last name) from 'Man vs Food' on the Travel Channel.  I was greeted upon entry by a cheerful and friendly associate.  I said hello and placed my order.\\n\\n I opted for the 'carry-out' and ordered the promotion with my two topping being ham and pineapple - revised (limited) Hawaiian version.  The pizza was done and ready to go in about ten minutes.\\n\\nWhen I got home, I popped opened the pizza box and examined the contents.  Yup, it looked like a pizza that was made in about ten minutes...  but hey, I can't really complain, for $7.99, I had the whole dietary essentials from the food pyramid group.  The slices were cut irregularly, some were sized big enough to be two pizza slices while some were about half of one.  After my assessment, I moved onto the taste.  My 'Hawaiian' pizza tasted decent - edible and ordinary.  I didn't get an option on preference of the crust, which comes in original or thin, I think mine was original crust and it was really doughy.  After couple of slices, I was content; which meant I wasn't in the state of hunger anymore, but I didn't want to consume it anymore either - wasn't worth the extra miles on my guilt trip.\\n\\nOverall, I think it was decent; I think this is where the expression, \\"You get what you pay for,\\" come into play.  Would I go again?  I don't know.. I've learned to never say never... but then again, with other local and commercial pizza options to choose from (ie Donatos, Dominos, Papa John's and so on..), I don't think I'll be coming back for this one anytime soon.  \\n\\nSo there you have it~  As for me, off to the mental guilt trip for my lack of determination TT__TT...  add this one onto the Resolution List...."},{"name":"Outback Steakhouse","address":"11600 Research Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"Outstanding service.

This is one of the top restaurants I wanted to write a Yelp review on but I decided to wait until the new location opened. I have been wanting to come back here frequently now that I have some more cash in my hand. Has Nud Pob changed significantly since they moved? Not really, but the interior itself went through a big upgrade from what it used to be.\\n\\nThe first thing I got was my favorite (and one of the most expensive) fried rice dish: The Indonesian Fried Rice. I paid a total of $10 for the chicken version. This is chicken fried rice, with crispy chicken, some hot peppers, a fried egg, and some sauce to dip the crispy chicken. When I first tasted the crispy chicken, I was really surprised that the chicken has not changed since I last had that dish back in the Autumn of 2008. The crispy chicken was crunchy on the outside, tender on the inside, and dipping it in the sauce made it sweeter and flavorful. They have reduced the number of hot peppers in the dish, making it less spicier than the previous version. The fried egg is smaller, but the yolk is still runny just like the last time I had it, and tasted really good with the fried rice. One dish should be enough to fill my stomach and take home a little leftovers for a really light lunch depending how hungry you are. I was really hungry and I was really full after eating the Indonesian Fried Rice in one sitting.\\n\\nIf the quality of the Indonesian Fried Rice has not changed significantly, then I think their less expensive fried rice dish (also one of my favorites); the Crispy Chicken Fried rice has not changed significantly. This is a little similar to the Indonesian Fried Rice, but without the egg and the hot peppers. \\n\\nI came back again, and ordered one of my favorite rice dishes when I was a student, which is the Chicken Cashew Nut rice plate. The pineapples gave it a sweet and tangy taste to it. The chicken was okay, and the cashews and vegetables were decent. Overall, I had a decent dinner, and it made my stomach really full when I came in hungry. \\n\\nThe interior is bigger, so there are more tables compared to the old version of the restaurant. They actually have toilets (the old location did not), the free water dispenser is still there, but the free hot tea dispenser is gone. You can still choose between silver utensils or plastic utensils, and when you are done with your dish, you can still take it to the dish carts on the corner near the entrance. Service is definitely slower on a Friday afternoon/evening when school is in session compared to other days and the lines have gotten longer.\\n\\nI will definitely be back to get some dishes from Nud Pob, and I will keep on editing this review after eating some more of my favorite dishes such as the Pad Thai, Chicken House Fried Rice, Kao Nah Ped (#P6), and their curry rice plates.

We both work in restaurants at night and having a night off is something any waitstaff/manager can appreciate.  We decided to use Urban Spoon to find a place in the Natick area that wasn't chain.  When we stumbled upon Maxwell's, we read the reviews and checked out the online menu.\\n\\nSome of the reviews were helpful - food recommendations, and not to judge the restaurant by it's exterior. \\n\\nWe had made a reservation, but opted to sit at the bar instead. The bar is small (only seats 4) but was perfect for us.  We were presented with a list of specialty cocktails and the helpful, friendly bartender guided us through the menu.  I am a fan of St. Germain Elderflower Liqueur and was delighted to see 2 drinks made with it.  I tried one and my boyfriend tried the other.  Both were delicious, clean and crisp.\\n\\nAfter hearing about the dinner specials, we asked for recommendation on appetizer selections. By suggestion we chose to try the Beef Carpaccio and the Mushroom Risotto Cake. Both were outstanding.  The cheese and the capers on the beef, with arugula salad on the side was delightful.  We were served bread with chili dipping sauce, and homemade humus on the side.  We used the bread to finish up the sauce on the risotto cake -- couldn't let any go to waste! The side of humus that comes with the bread is to die for as well! Everything so far had great flavor and mixture of textures.\\n\\nFor our main course I decided on the Sole.  It was with crab and sauteed spinach. The most amazing part of the dish was the sauce.  The lobster, sherry sauce infused with butternut squash.  It had great color and flavor.  It was served with the option of fresh ground pepper, and every bite was excellent.  I would go back just for this dish! My boyfriend had the Gnocchi ai Aragosta, which had fresh lobster meat, wild mushrooms, truffle sauce, cream & parmesan cheese. SO GOOD. After his first bite he said that they were easily one of the best gnocchis he has had.  We knew they had to be homemade.  And sure enough, we asked the bartender and they were.  \\n\\nAfter dinner and chatting with our bartender, Randy, we tried a sample of their Black Fig Vodka.  They infuse vodka in house and have just recently started selling it to the public.  The vodka is delicious.  The fig taste is uncanny. My boyfriend tried their signature Black Fig Vodka Martini, which was served with 3 jumbo blue cheese stuffed olives - his favorite.  I opted for an Espresso martini, which was made with an actual shot of espresso. \\n\\nWe again turned to the guidance of our bartender for a dessert recommendation.  Per his suggestion, we ordered the carrot cake.  Carrot cake is easily one of my favorite desserts, but I was hesitant because they put pineapple in their version.  Randy had be on the money throughout the entire meal and I trusted his input.  The carrot cake was AWESOME.  The mascarpone frosting was light and the perfect companion for the carrot cake.\\n\\nOverall it was an excellent dining experience, and we couldn't have been more satisfied.

I understand misunderstandings but i clearly said two mediums. On top of everything we literally live a mile down the road and the pizza we receieved was lukewarm if that. I had to reheat in microwave right away. Then the cheese bread was cut so thin and cold it was almost just stale and off putting. Very disappointing.

From the moment we walked in (along with my 16 mo old daughter, well behaved and in a stroller), he was rude, insincere, and absolutely made the entire experience intolerable. Food was great. However, my Dutch pal didn't quite understand an omelet and instead of explaining it to her, he loudly repeated himself into her ear what it was, as if she were deaf. She's not. She just doesn't know what am omelet entails. So she orders steel cut oats which she just didn't like (texture is different/bland), and he acted so insane about it when she said coyly that she didn't like them. He loudly asked what was wrong with them, were they sour? Etc. She then asked for a plain bagel, which he insisted on toasting much to her not wanting it toasted, because as he said, 'You want it toasted, it will taste better'. Then I asked at the end for him to split the bill. You would have thought I asked for a kidney.I said to the man, look I'm sorry you're having a bad day... Why are you so flustered?!

I've never gone on yelp to speak poorly of a business, and I tend to be very skeptical of negative reviews. But I've just gotta be that person unfortunately. \\n\\nLet's start with the good. The beignets were the best I've had outside of Louisiana. Our servers were friendly. The fries were great. The cornbread was delicious. Others have told me the drinks are good there. I'd even say that if you just want beignets and drinks, go right ahead, enjoy yourself.\\n\\nOkay, now the rest. At lunch yesterday I ordered the etouffee, which I normally love. It took a long time to get out, which our server apologized for. No harm no foul. The etouffee was more along the lines of a shrimp chowder with rice, and lukewarm. It's pretty bland, except for an abundance of salt. Whatever, it's not nola, maybe I should've known better. I asked the server if they had any bread-y offering, figuring I could at least mop up the soup. He offers garlic bread, tells me it's crispy. Great, that should be perfect! Well, one side of the bread is lightly charred, the kind it might get under a broiler, and somehow it's still floppy and slightly soggy. It doesn't taste bad, it's just a bizarre texture. Disappointing, not very palatable, but better than the etouffee by itself. Our server is trying really hard. I'm STILL not worried about it. I'll just eat my partner's fries, get through the etouffee until I'm not hungry anymore, enjoy the beignets. That's exactly what happens, and with some more kind and personal service, we left. \\n\\n3am the next morning I wake up with food poisoning. All the other food I'd eaten that day had been fruits and vegetables. The day before that I'd eaten oatmeal and a vegetarian curry that involved a small amount of cream I'd purchased three days prior. Normally I'd assume that I undercooked something, but it just didn't seem possible with the foods I'd made in the last few days. \\n\\nAnyway, I call the restaurant to let them know- maybe one of their fridges or freezers is a little too warm, maybe whatever they use to heat their soup is kept too cool, maybe the shrimp was bad. If I ran a restaurant, I'd want a heads up. I ask to speak to the manager, tell him I'd had the etouffee the day before and woke up 14 hours later with food poisoning. I'm not asking for anything, I don't mention the weirdness of the food itself, I start the conversation by saying I'm sorry to call only to say something negative. Stuff happens, I'm literally just calling so they can take appropriate safety measures. \\n\\n\\"I don't mean to shift blame, but food poisoning usually takes 48 hours to set in, so it probably wasn't us.\\"\\n\\nI'm stunned by this response, I say okay, clearly surprised. He says he'll make sure they're serving a new batch of etouffee today, and it should be a new one by now. I say okay again and tell him to have a good day. \\n\\nMy first thought is maybe he's right. It's been ten years since I worked in a kitchen, I don't remember the details of this stuff.  So I look up food poisoning on the Mayo Clinic website. Maybe I need to throw my heavy cream away. I mean, the curry I made at home simmered for half an hour after boiling for several minutes, but I'd rather not chance it. Turns out four of the bugs that go with the potential causes (incorrect temperature, seafood, dairy) have onsets that match when I started feeling terrible. And now, now I'm angry, and now I go write a review on yelp because I spoke to a manager of a seafood heavy restaurant who brushed off food poisoning by citing totally incorrect information about when the dish I ate could have gotten a customer ill. I'm just stunned by the ignorance. \\n\\nAnyway, I STILL don't want anything from them, not even an apology at this point, but I do want them to do a careful review of safety standards in their kitchen, and I do want other customers to know that if they got sick here fourteen hours after eating a seafood dish... French Quarter is probably to blame."},{"name":"Wendy's","address":"500 S Us Hwy 17/92","city":"Longwood","stars":"2","text":"I don't think my Avocado Southwest Chicken Salad is supposed to have apples and craisins in it.

Not in this case for the Fogo!  A group of friends and I decided to go here on a day's notice so we fasted appropriately.  My friend made reservations and got confirmation with ease.  Even when we needed to add an extra guest last minute, the staff didn't complain one bit.  Despite holding many seats, the place was hoppin on a Friday evening.\\n\\nOnce the group arrived, we were seated promptly by the hostess.  A word of caution, try to avoid sitting by the wall as it's not the best spot in the restaurant.  It can feel tight at times.  Other than that, the server only asked us once if we wanted cocktails or other drinks.  We politely declined and the server wasn't upset when the wine glasses were taken away.  After a short and sweet explanation about the restaurant, we headed to the buffet.  There is a good variety of fresh salads, veggies, and even a meat and cheese selection.  Labels on the buffet would be nice to see which dish was which for some of the lesser known items.  After sampling some of the salami, cheese, kale salad, and the complimentary \\"highly addicting\\" mini cheese rolls - meat with swords arrived!\\n\\nProbably my favorite offering was the leg of lamb, the chicken, and the Fogo steak.  There is so much tenderness and flavor with each bite that there is no need for additional seasoning or sauces.  Sure sauces are offered upon request, but I didn't think it was a total necessity to pair it together.  Each person at the table had their own red/green disk so I didn't have to be bothered by the offerings when I had a plate full of goodness.  When I had the red disk shown facing up, if I saw a certain kind of meat my friends were getting, I would jump on the bandwagon.  \\n\\nOnce we started to get full, dessert was offered and we decided upon the papaya cream and the flan.  Since it was a friend's birthday, the flan was comped on our bill.  I led the singing appropriately and the birthday boy was all smiles.  The server topped off the papaya cream with liquor to give it an extra boost.  Without it, I thought the dessert was just meh and forgettable.  I do recommend the flan which was the clear winner of the group.  \\n\\nDefinitely come here for a special occasion and if you want to be treated like royalty.  It's not everyday I spend moolah on fine dining, but Fogo definitely delivered in terms of quality and satisfaction.

I kid you not, it was tiny, and for more than $40 dollars I expected much more. The taste of this tiny piece of meat wasn't great either. I ordered a medium well but tasted more like well done.

This is a richly flavoured broth with a pleasant aroma.  And they were more generous with the fillings than I have ever seen them.  I don't know if they were just in a good mood today or not, but I hope this is the new standard!  There was literally close to a half pound of raw beef that was amazingly tender.

They offer creative options that aren't afterthoughts, like a lot of finer dining places in Atlanta. Vegetarians probably know what I'm talking about...the usual risotto, veggie plate, veggie pasta or nothing. 4th gets much more creative usually a few apps, salads, one entr√©e and a veggie plate where you pick from 4 of their sides - and since their sides change just about every day and are local and fresh, it not the same tired veg plate that you'll find elsewhere. \\n\\nMy most recent trip was for my husband's birthday and after one initial not-so-great moment (see Ridiculous Hat Rule below), it was fantastic. Ordered: pork belly, heirloom lettuces salad, venison, I did have the veggie plate - polenta gnocchi (awesome), rapini (good), ratatouille (the best), potato of the day (just ok). They did have a unique vegetarian entr√©e, but...what's the deal with the exotic mushroom trend on menus lately? This dish featured the French horn mushroom (looks like a penis...really, google it).

My husband was wearing a cool hat that was nice and went great with his hipster outfit. He was told at the hostess stand that his hat had to go. He looked MUCH more casual without the hat on, his hair all crazy. So in this case, removing the hat did not = a better dressed diner. \\n\\n2.

It follows, therefore, that you should NOT let your prejudice for places so simply named stop you from coming in to Pad Thai in the Mueller redevelopment. It's absolutely worth it. \\nThe decor is pleasantly austere without being uncomfortable...exactly what you want in a no-frills place where the focus is on the food and not the atmosphere.\\n\\nOn my latest excursion to Pad Thai, my cohorts and I ordered a variety of dishes, all of which were tasty and incredibly fresh.\\n\\nStart with pretty much any of the appetizers...the shrimp spring rolls topped with hot (hot!) chili sauce are excellent, the fried rice balls have a nice hint of coconut to them, the various incarnations of shrimp wrapped in rice paper or coconut are great. \\n\\nPad Thai has delicious soups that could be a meal on their own: the Tom Kha with chicken in a fire pot is creamy, spicy and pleasantly tart with a hint of sweetness from lemongrass and fresh coconut milk. Also, who doesn't love serving themselves soup from a dish that is ON FIRE? It makes for a bit of conversation if you're trapped with otherwise dull companions.\\n\\nFor entrees, the curries and stir fries are served family style, and are cooked to order, so if you have substitutions or dislike a particular vegetable, it's no problem. I could eat the C3 (Gang Garee) yellow curry every day of my life. The noodle dishes are excellent, portions are generous, and there are plenty of options in that category, in case you would like to venture out of your everyday \\"pad thai\\" comfort zone.\\n\\nMy favorite thing about this place, however, are the special duck dishes. This is one of the few places in town that treats duck the way it was mean to be treated- crispy on the outside, flavorful and tender on the inside. You can get half a duck in either Thai basil sauce (excellent) or red curry (great if you like a tangy sauce with a hint of sweetness) and stir fried veggies, plus their white rice that isn't too sticky and always is served with a heart-shaped carrot slice on top for garnish. \\n\\nIt's the details. \\n\\nOverall, the food is great, which is frankly not something you can say about many of the Thai offerings in Austin. Also, what bumps Pad Thai up to 5 stars in this case is the combo of great food, reasonable prices, quick turnaround time for cooked-to-order dishes, and friendly, knowledgable service. \\n\\nIf you're in Austin and are tired of being treated poorly by the longstanding Thai \\"institutions\\" then I would highly recommend making Pad Thai one of your go-to places for a great meal."},{"name":"Charley's Steak House","address":"2901 Parkway Blvd, Ste 1A","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"4","text":"Wow the best filet I have ever had.

I think they likely have good food if you are ordering off a menu, but I strongly advise people to skip the brunch.  I knew what the cost would be beforehand, and was fine paying almost $90 for two people, because I expected a relaxed champagne brunch where we would get excellent food. The place is quite pretty, the servers were attentive and personable, and they kept the champagne and coffee coming.  But the food was a huge disappointment.  I recognize it is a challenge to keep food at the right temperature on a buffet line, but usually things are hot when they are initially brought out, at least. All of the food, without exception, was at best lukewarm.  Some was downright cold, to the point where the sauce in one of the dishes was starting to congeal. My husband has a thing about food being hot, so he was very unhappy.  I'm a bit more tolerant, but even I don't like cold eggs benedict. Also, the cold foods like the salmon were drying out, and we were there 1 hour after it opened. We had heard there was an omelet bar and three types of carved meats, but there was on omelet bar and only one non-descript looking roast.  We later learned there was another buffet downstairs (we were seated upstairs) and it was apparently far larger than the one we were offered, for the same price.  There was nothing relaxing about the atmosphere; it was crowded and noisy.  Based on this experience I will never convince my husband to go back for dinner, and I don't know that I want to either.  No one ever asked us how we were enjoying the food, and the manager was not in the lobby when we left.  I didn't want to ask for him, because they were really crowded when we left and I didn't feel like waiting.  All in all, a most disappointing experience."},{"name":"Laughing Planet","address":"1720 SW 4th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"So I want to be clear... I don't dislike this place, but I don't love it either.  This review is primarily for my visit today.  I just went and grabbed a to-go option.  It was the Southwest Chili Burritto.  Overall, I was disappointed.  I like the concept and the ingredients what I didn't like was the fact that it was mushy, like it had been sitting in the warming pan for too long.  Everything just mushed together and tasted like been and slimey tortilla.  For a $7 burritto it was way below par - I wish I had gone to a food truck nearby.  Also, the spicy salsa... ugh!  Looked like carrot juice with the pulp still.  Tasted spicy, but I couldn't get past the pulp and I think it may have come out of a freezer as it was very cold and did not drizzle over the burritto very well.\\n\\nHowever, so you don't think I am just a hater - I have been before and ordered a quesidella (instead of grabbing a to-go) and it was great! Crisp, perfectly melted cheese and warm, just melting in your mouth.

We were quickly seated in the middle of the dining room. Excellent! Next, our server introduced himself and let us know of the specials and told us that we were early for drinks, but that he'd take our drink order and put it in 5 minutes before serving time so that it would be ready by the time we were able to partake in adult beverages. Sweet. We're happy! We then place orders for food... this is where it starts to go down hill.... \\n\\nThey brought out biscuits that were incredibly burnt on the bottom (but, the jelly was fabulous). It was pretty open at this time because the crowd hadn't started to fill in, so WHY did it take 50 minutes to bring out our food? We understand that we were a larger party, but is shouldn't take that long and no one made any \\"special requests\\". When the food did come out, it came out in sections. 3 plates here... another couple of minutes.... 1 plate... a few more minutes.... another 3 plates and then when everyone thought that they had their food, I look over and my date who has no food in front of him ::sad face:: (of course everyone is on good behaviour that day and waiting until all food has arrived to start eating). So, when we finally get our waiter to come over we tell him and he runs back for the forgotten omelet plate... Okay, life is good, everyone has food. ::Nom Nom Nom:: YUMMMMMMMYYYYY! \\n\\nThe food was ah-mazing. We were all raving about our food even though some plates room temperature after the painfuly inconsistent chain of delivery. We all thoroughly enjoyed the Bloody Marys (although, make sure that you specify that you don't want Kettle One or Grey Goose if you want to stick to the $8 one. *They ask if you want Kettle One or Grey Goose, like those are the only options that they have*. We didn't know until after the fact that it was more $$, we thought that was just how they served them, stupid hungover us!). The also have the option for $8 all you can drink Mimosas and Bellini's, however I saw many tables waiting for a substantial amount of time for refills. We had a pretty great time even if for a super long brunch. \\n\\nIt was definately a memorable experience and the place is super cute.

I was not in the mood to cook so i wandered into ball square  and thought that this place had a lot of options and could be a possible solution to finding dinner.  \\nThere are a lot of options and personal pies, burgers, wings, sandwiches and salads all start between $7-$9.  Fair pricing, more of the norm.  \\nI was drawn to all the sandwich/panini options.  I opted for the eggplant parm.  I remembered a place I worked that used to make a great breaded eggplant parm and wanted something that wasn't necessarily healthy.  On top of that I opted for a side.  Mac and Cheese sounded good until i found out it was made with velveeta.  It isn't my first personal choice, but the person I met explained it represents a home made version and is very popular. So i ordered spicy fries.  \\nThe fries were o.k.  They weren't greasy, hot and a good amount, but they were over salted and not spicy.  I am senstive to heat and my tongue wasn't even effected by eating the fries so I was disappointed by the lack of spice on the fries.\\nThe eggplant parm was a nice size.  You could share if your appetite is not that big or wanted to eat it with a salad or soup.  It was covered with lots of cheese, not a lot of sauce and the eggplant was mushy.  I think that the way chicken parm is made - being breaded and either pan fried or deep fried is the same way you should treat eggplant.  I wouldn't ever get this again, nor the spicy fries.  Maybe I would try the pizza or another sandwich, or even one of the many varieties of wings next time I don't feel like cooking.  \\nOverall, I appreciate the portions and the pricing.  The fries were good, but would have preferred them to have had some heat.  The sandwich was deliciously cheesy, but would have enjoyed a traditional chicken parm.\\nOne thing I didn't mention is that they offer lots of options for a complete meal.  In addition to the sides, etc... they also sell ben and jerry's ice cream, lots of bottled beverages, chips, cookies - some are gluten free.  So you can find a lot of great options to indulge when you don't feel like cooking.  \\nI think that the next time I go I will be adding a star, because the service was quick and helpful and polite."},{"name":"Grand Central Bakery","address":"714 N Fremont","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I love walking here on the weekends and grabbing muffins and breakfast sandwiches for my family.

Every entree is served with a salad, which was extremely refreshing, and some parmesan rosemary bread, this was very nice! I would say the taste reminded me of rosemary infused biscuits. Angeline recommended a glass of Malbec to pair with my Bison Ribeye. SO GOOD. Cooked to perfection (medium rare) not too salty, it would honestly melt in your mouth. My mother ordered the classic ribeye (I wanna say 20oz?) and it was great as well. She ordered truffle butter to top the steak and it really enhanced the flavors, that butter was pretty addicting.

The food will probably get 3 stars since I did like how crunchy the fish was (I had a catfish poboy)however the grilled corn was a waste of $3.50. Also, they gave me a small amount of fries. Thus, $20 is expensive for a poboy with fries and corn on the side. What really disturbed me is that they added 10% gratuity for a call in order for just one person. I don't like being deceived because when I called in my order over the phone they should have told me that they add gratuity for pick up orders. Now I have no problem with tipping but I should've been informed first and I don't think it should be mandatory to tip on a pickup order (unless maybe they are personally bringing your order to your car which they did not).

The people who eat here arent college kids and its not a chain restaurant feel. My fresh fish sandwich was good (but it wasnt amazing). The fries were tasty - spicy flavoring and big fat smooshy fries which I love. My sandwich was good sized.\\n\\nCons- The fries were better than the fish. My sandwich tasted fresh but had no flavoring - I ordered the Cajun flavoring but couldnt really tell. They didnt put a lemon on my plate or on the fish so that didnt help the lack of flavor and Im used to seafood restaurants putting a lemon and/or pickle on my plate.\\n The parking is crappy with limited spots and tight parking spots (parallel on the street and limited parking right in front of where you eat outside which was sort of odd). \\n\\nExpect to pay around 15 bucks for most meals. \\n\\nThe wait is pretty long and its super busy. \\n\\nYou have to order at the window inside and the line winds outside as you are waiting. I dont think most people realize that you havta order at the counter because if you are waiting in a long line and the menus are right next to where you order, you dont get a chance to see the menu until its time for you to order. They could probably keep menus hanging outside somewhere noticeable for people with a sign saying to preview before getting up to the counter inside.  \\n\\nAlso, the waiters run in and out from the kitchen with their orders for the outside deck and run into people waiting in line. They had to say excuse me every five minutes to get people to move so that they could get food to people. I think they could either add a door just for the waiters OR make the door larger where we are standing (its only a large enough door for one person to fit through)."},{"name":"ParkGrounds","address":"142 Flat Shoals Ave SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Great coffee and cool atmosphere.

Partly this is because I behaved badly.

However, nearly everything I've bought at the Blue Glass Cafe since it opened in October has been either overcooked, over-salted or stale.

When the waiter came back to tell us our son's order was in we ordered drinks, a BBQ shrimp as an entree and a fried chicken po' boy with fries. Then the waiting started. 15 minutes in no kid's entree but we could hear the waiter yelling at the kitchen. The people beside us waited that long and more for happy hour oysters. After 15 minutes the BBQ shrimp arrived but nothing else. The BBQ shrimp was awful. The sauce was burned and the shrimp were not head on shrimp as the dish is traditionally served (and where most of the flavor comes from.) 10 minutes later we finally got the mac and cheese. About 10 minutes after that the chicken po' boy showed up without fries. Five minutes later the fries showed up. The good news is the mac and cheese and po' boy were tasty. The bad news was that everyone in our party ate at a different time and this was when the restaurant was basically empty with three people working the open kitchen. I shudder to think how slow it would be if the place was busy. Worst of all the waiter gave us our bill at full price. There wasn't even a manager who came by our table to ask us how it was going or offered to pitch in when multiple waiters were yelling at the kitchen about not getting food.

Even with proven timestamp. \\n\\nSo I walked downstairs  from the second level (we parked by the elevator because one of our group is disabled) and told the bartenders of our situation.

However, I felt very compelled to write something in this case.\\n\\nI am writing this not only as a great review for a great experience I had at ROKA this past weekend. But also as a counter response to Kaitlyn, because she wrote something that I am pretty sure also relates to me and my family , as much as it did ROKA. And I am not going to lie, it bothered me.\\n\\nI live in the neighborhood and I had the daunting task of doing a birthday dinner for my sister, who turned 30. I chose ROKA, (changing it from another location and I am glad I did) it came recommended to me from a family member. And on Saturday, the 8th I was that \\"loud and annoying\\" birthday party. I guess. I dont really know about Birthday parties that are quiet. Especially, when you are happy, having fun and eating great food.\\n\\nI apologize for ruining your evening, that was not our intent. I think the issue, was more about where you were placed. And if I was having a romantic dinner, I of course wouldnt sit next to a large party. So I get it.\\n\\nEverything about ROKA was awesome from the moment, my family and I got there. It was close to home. Gorgeous. We have attentive staff. Our food was pretty, tasted good and came out so quick we could barely get to the next course. I called ahead of time and prepared for my party. Thats the event planner in me and chose my menu based on some of our favorites, but willing to try new things. My waitress teresa was so awesome I tipped her 3xs the average. The owner, Jerry came out and gave us free sushi and some of the best rolls I have had. He was a nice, funny and good guy. \\n\\nI would not only just go back, I would even host another event maybe larger. I had 15 people and no complaints. We even had additional servers come by and help my younger cousins with holding chop sticks.\\n\\nPlus, free parking!\\n\\nThe spot has been only open a couple of months and a lot of what i read are growing pains. and I strongly believe if you asked to speak to a manager or owner, any issues would be rectified.\\n\\nThe walnut shrimp and singapore noodles and general gaus chicken were my favs.  my family is hard to please and they all walked out of there happy and that made me happy.\\n\\nI haven't in a long time wanted to cover a large group bill, but I gladly spent over $300 and it was worth it.

However, beside my entree everything else left a bit to be desired. The Thai iced tea was like 1/4 tea 3/4 cream and far to sweet. The place doesn't even pretend that it's not dirty. And a little weird. The menu you look at in the store is different from their take out menu. The take out menu is so much more extensive, I'm glad I looked. And not just with me, but very often people would get their entree before their appetizer. Not that fast delivery of food is bad but when it's ready that fast, it basically implies that the food is not cooked to order and that someone started you meal before you arrived in some aspects.

We both had not been to Dalo's, but like Ethiopian food, so decided to try it. Upon entering we were greeted and offered to sit anywhere we wanted. Once we had our table we checked out the buffet.\\n\\nThe buffet looked alright but really didn't have enough variety for me, especially for $11 (even though it was all you can eat). I decided I would probably go with my standard Ethiopian stand by, a vegan platter. As my friend and I decided what else to get our waiter brought us water. I asked for lemon and he responded that they had lemon. \\n\\nMy friend liked the idea of sharing a platter and a couple other things so we decided to order a small vegan platter, a side of filled pastries (similar to Samosas but with lentils inside instead of potatoes and peas), and a side of greens. Once we had decided what we would order we waited and waited and waited for our waiter to come back to take our order. After probably 10 minutes we finally went up to him at the bar and put our order in. I again asked for lemon, which he said he had. I also asked for a whiskey ginger.\\n\\nAbout 20 minutes later there was no sign of my lemons (for my water) or our food. Our waiter did come by to say they didn't actually have ginger ale, but had club soda and tonic. I decided to forgo having a cocktail. After he left our table, it dawned on me that they are probably used to people just getting the buffet and not actually ordering off the menu. The samosa like things came, without the accompaniment of lemons, so we finally had some food. I gave up on getting lemon for my water- didn't want to be annoying after all.\\n\\nOur vegan platter components came shortly after. Now, other Ethiopian places I have been to have been consistent in that a vegan platter includes at least 7 or 8 \\"sides\\" that are spooned onto the injera. I personally like this presentation and technique, but I am not a fan of the injera when it gets soggy so that's usually my cue to be done eating. Their way of plating the vegan platter was a big dish with the injera and then 3 small bowls with the sides. There may have been 4 sides, but we figured one of the bowls was the side of greens my friend had ordered. I was surprised to receive it this way, and even more surprised when the waiter said \\"enjoy\\" and walked away. \\n\\nSo, not only was this kind of a boring (and small) platter of tasty goodness, but it was identical to what was being served at the buffet. The menu had listed 11-13 items were included on the platter, but our variety didn't even include half of that amount. I didn't mind spooning the toppings on the injera myself, and it tasted good, it just wasn't the best I have had in Portland.\\n\\nBetween the service (or lack of), the misleading text on the menu, the lack of variety with the vegan platter, and the price for these things I will stick to Queen of Sheba."},{"name":"Black Rooster Taqueria","address":"1323 N Mills Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"I was meeting with a group of colleagues, most who had never been here before but had an office around the corner.\\n\\nWe showed up at lunchtime and the place was a bustling; we found a table for six of us and quickly placed our order at the counter.\\n\\nWe started with homemade guacamole, chips and salsa and nearly everyone did an assortment of two or three kinds of tacos.\\n\\nThe homemade guacamole is out of this world both creamy and chunky at the same time with great flavor and amazing homemade chips.\\n\\nTheir salsa is smooth and has a little smoky, almost chipotle flavor to it.

Perhaps I should have just stuck with just the \\" traditional Mexican style burriito.\\" My cajun style burrito seemed simple enough; filled with rice, black beans, roasted corn and chicken, Again, seems simple enough, right? WRONG!\\n\\nI think the problem was in the cajun sauce. The \\"cajun spices\\" sauce or other key \\"cajun\\" ingredients that went into my burrito were wrong in too many ways. And that sauce got mixed in with or combined the other fillings. The sauce that was in my burrito was, by design or by accident,  awful in a cloying taste overload kind of way. It was like a cross between Mexican queso cheese, McDonalds special sauce (dressing) and some kind of vinegar-based salad oil / vinegar dressing. Just awful.\\n\\nAlso, what did not help matters at all, was that the chicken meat was chopped up too finely; way too mushy; like chicken salad from hell.

I definitely am in agreement with the other reviewer--it was AMAZING! it's definitely in my top 10 restaurants in Atlanta. \\n\\nfirst, it's southern dim sum as they put it...there is a menu that they have that shows what the various items they will be serving that night along with a price and an area for the staff to write the quantity consumed. Each dish ranged from $6-18, but all were kind of tapas size (just a few bites usually). We too ordered almost everything on the menu. So first tip, better to go with a few people so you can try a bunch of items. Vegetarians beware--not as much veggie friendly food as you'd probably like to make a meal of since all the food comes pre-prepped to the table.  The menu changes constantly, and so won't delve into the dishes in specifics. They were all interesting/clever new takes on southern fare. Now i being from the north think southern fare has a tendency to be monotonous/not my first go to cuisine category. However, here, Kevin Gillespie and company made dishes that incorporated southern ingredients in a very interesting/tasty way. He has this braised short rib, lemon spaetzle, and mushroom dish that was delicious. The beef just melted in your mouth, the spaetzle had the nice crust from being on the bottom of the pan. The chocolate cake for dessert--rich, decadent, and i could have eaten 4 of them!  I will say that a few of the dishes were a bit overly salted for me but as you can tell from my track record of reviews, i think a lot of food down here is overly salted. that said, many people at the table liked the overt saltiness of some of the dishes. to each his own.\\n\\nTip #2: be prepared for a nice slow meal that you won't feel stuffed at the end of. i can imagine some might leave a bit hungry (we had a 16 year old growing boy in out group and i think he needed to go home and eat a pizza after our meal). the chefs both prepare the food and come to the table to serve/tell you about the item (and i mean all about it; like the fact that the pig i had was named wilbur (he was delicious)). We had at least a two hour long meal, as it took a while for all the dishes to make the rounds.  I'm not sure if this is  a sustainable business model, but it worked for us! That being said, the way the carts come out, there are certain tables that get the creme de la creme items immediately, and by the time the cart made its way to our table, those items were gone, which meant waiting. it would be good to have them mix up the directionality of the carts to make sure that its not always the same table waiting for food...\\n\\nthe portions--they're not hugely generous; usually a portion is just a few bites.  For example, for $18, you get 1 slice of lamb (though it was delectable)! i think if you come here uber hungry you'll either spend a lot of money or leave hungry. \\n\\nservice: great. very attentive staff, though a tendency to remove the plates while there was still a last remaining morsel on the plate (if there are only 3 bites on a plate, taking the plate away when there is 1 bite remaining just doesn't make sense). especially commendable since they only opened up a week ago! the slow food pacing/service is due to their concept, and we'll see if that survives or not. i can't imagine it'll be easy to get a walk in slot if everyone's meal is taking 2 hours.\\n\\nambiance: open kitchen is great to watch the chefs in action, though i suspect if the restaurant was packed, it might be a tad noisy/hot (just guessing). Casual eatery with stroller-wielding families, couples on dates, groups of friends being merry, so really runs the whole gamut. \\n\\nprice: we paid $60 per person which included some wine/beer (fyi they're now able to serve beer/wine) and a large variety of dishes and our tip.  i'd say that's a great value for the quality of the food you're getting, but at that price, it's outside of the casual dinner range and into the special occasion/date night category. \\n\\nso, my main message--go. it's a fun, relaxing, unpretentious way to eat great food."},{"name":"Gunshow","address":"924 Garrett St, Ste C","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"I love this concept and the experience!!  4 people is a great number to go with.

Oh, and stop trying to take my plate when I'm trying to relish the sauce) and even the flawed concept (each chef makes 2-3 dishes an evening and if he is making one, you wait for the others for at least 30 minutes, plus we waited for certain dishes but the chef stopped making them and we haven't had them even once), we will not be back here again. \\nFood was poultry-based and went from brilliant (chicken heart schwarma) to executed nicely (egg on corn bread, chicken nuggets and halibut in chicken skin) to executed poorly (pasta that was close to raw, tough and not edible). some dishes, like the chicken liver, were too small to be shared among our party of 4. \\nDesserts were looking disappointing- bread pudding? Peach in some sauce and something that looked like an energy bar?? For 10$ each this is insulting. We were so annoyed with the need to scream the whole evening we just skipped it and fled. With banging eardrums.\\nAnnoying experience altogether."},{"name":"Phnom Penh","address":"244 E Georgia Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Visited Vanc for a day, this is in our must eat place per our friend's recommendation.

I used to enjoy the delicious food, thoughtful beer list, casual atmosphere and reasonable prices, but I've been there 3 times recently (due to temporary lack of transport to get many places conveniently), and been very disappointed.  Twice when I've been and got the tenders and fries they have given me tiny portions (3 finger-length tenders), and when I mentioned this they remedied it the first time but not the second, on that occasion when I pointed it out to the bartender he said, \\"Oh, I've noticed that too, maybe we're running out or something.\\" It's better to run out of an item altogether than to underportion food, especially when you have gastropub prices ($10 for chicken and fries).  It isn't that I need a huge portion, but I would like to get my money's worth (and possibly have leftovers). Their vaunted duck fat fries have also gotten more and more lackluster, and now come out covered in the gritty orange seasoning usually found on college cafeteria fries. Ew.  \\n\\nAs for the rest of the service, I've also noticed recently that if you aren't sitting at the bar, it might be a while before anyone gives you a second glance.\\n\\n\\nSorry Augustine's.

I requested no onions and they charged me to substitute another vegetable.  Seriously?  I asked for medium heat and that translated into extra salt and no heat.  Also, there were very few scallops.  I prefer the Drunken Noodles or Uncle Bob.  The spring rolls are decent but the Crab Rangoon is to die for.  \\n\\nWithout the appetizer but including tip, my Basil Scallops were $15.

This bar has multiple personality disorder.\\n\\nAnd even though the drinks are cheap, don't be tricked into thinking you're getting a good deal.  The mixed drinks are pretty weak and generally not well mixed.\\n\\nThe Tortoise does earn itself an extra star for having decent karaoke, where the wait isn't much longer than a few songs on their peak nights."},{"name":"Marino Adriatic Cafe","address":"4129 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"We just love this place.

Well, less often anyway. Like a few other reviewers, our go-to place for Indian is MOI. We've tried about 4 other places so far but found no viable options, until now. Well, maybe not equal, but close enough. It is a small, quaint eatery serving authentic, delicious Indian dishes at reasonable prices. I was impressed by the staff in general from the hostess to the busboys. They seemed really invested and made us feel welcome. Of course the only exception had to be our own waiter, otherwise it would've been 5 stars. In fact I felt it should be -2 stars for his attitude, but the other wait staff  (there were 3 that served and helped) were so brilliant It cancelled out. Sort of. He seemed stressed from the start and was annoyed we had questions rather than being ready to order, I assume it was because they were reasonably busy. I felt pressured to make a choice quickly. At one point, after asking about levels of spiciness, he said \\"Look, you want spicy or not\\". In fact I like both so I decided to just pick one to get this part over with rather than get upset and spoil an otherwise perfectly good evening. Luckily It turned out to be good. The 2 vegetarian choices were Tadka Daal & Bagara Baigan, the latter was mildly spicy with the unmistakable flavor of tamarind and creaminess of coconut milk. Yummy. My  husband's Lamb Koorma was also really tasty, especially the gravy with their garlic naan. We tried Dosa for the first time, the Masala Dosa. It was amazing. It is a giant  crispy-skinned potato \\"pancake\\" rolled and served with a coconut mint chutney, a curry sauce and a mildly spicy, seasoned potato mash. Loved it.

I asked if she had any foil to keep it extra warm as it was raining out and since she did not, she was kind enough to fry up a fresh batch. That did not work so much out in my favour in terms of taste. The fries, while simple and crispy, tasted of old, refried oil, no doubt from end-of-the-day oil and no time to drain the excess (I know I cant really hold it against them).  The gravy was nothing special, more salty than anything (I think I like McDonalds gravy better, theres more actual flavour!) and the cheese curds were not too skimpy or too loaded.\\nOverall, this place is just ok. Nothing blew me away. For $7, in terms of value, you get what you pay for.

There are two pools a heated pool and a regular pool that has colder water. There are also two hot tubs and a nice watersilde. The hot tubs are kind of hidden, but if you stay a few nights you will learn where they are located. there is a huge cave that has waterfalls for the pools that is really nice and unlike any other pool I have been at. Unfortunately, I was here on business and the few nights I had free it rained non-stop, but I was still at the pool. There is a 24 hour fitness center. The pools and amenities are also open 24 hours. Make sure you take advantage of these pools, the hot tubs, the fitness center, the WIFI, and the other activities near the pool because like it or not you are going to be charged a resort fee each night you stay. \\n\\nOne thing is it is really expensive to stay here. I spent $600 for 3 nights and that was at a discounted rate. There are a few restaurants inside the resort that are nice, but also super expensive. I had an angus burger at the bistro cafe (near the front lobby) and that was good and I also had a chicken quesadilla at the poolside place for lunch which was also very good. \\n\\nThe room itself was very small. I stayed in a room with a King bed and a small sofa. There wasn't much walking room.

It's kind of an old fashioned place. Here's my review.\\n\\nFor starters we had the oysters two ways - remick and Rockefeller. I don't care for oysters but my boyfriend does and he said they were both really good. Then we had salads. They serve iceberg lettuce for the tossed salad, which is kind of old fashioned. However I like a good crunchy iceberg salad so I was fine with it. The ranch dressing was heavy on the mayo and light on the ranch seasoning, so I would try a different dressing next time. Boyfriend got the Waldorf salad \\"in the spirit of trying new things\\" and it was OK. As a disclaimer, I've never had a Waldorf salad that was better than OK, so I don't hold it against them.\\n\\nAnyway, I wasn't trying to fill up on sides and salad because I ordered an 8 oz New York strip steak. All of the entrees come with the aforementioned salad, a choice of potato or rice, and a vegetable. I picked a baked potato to go with my steak. Boyfriend got the scallops pan fried with redskin potatoes. Both of us very much enjoyed our entrees. My steak was cooked perfectly (I asked for between medium rare and medium) and they got a perfect sear on the outside without burning it or overlooking it. The steak itself was of excellent quality and not too fatty. I hate it when half the weight of my steak is in fat. \\n\\nOne thing to be aware of is that they don't season the meat (or most of the food) before it's cooked. I assume this is because of the older clientele who prefers to season to their own taste and may have a limit to how much sodium they can have. You can ask them to season your meat before it's cooked, which is what I would do next time, but the meal didn't suffer for the lack of salt. I just added some salt and pepper at the table.\\n\\nOur bill came to just under $60, which surprised me because I thought it would be more for good quality steak and seafood. Boyfriend also ordered a beer. For the record there were both cheaper and more expensive items on the menu, so you can pretty much fit any budget here."},{"name":"Caffe Umbria","address":"303 NW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"They have the European vibe with the coffee counter.

The majority of the menu stays the same, but there's at least one new thing each time I go. I am particular fond of the Moroccan Stew. It's an extremely flavorful and unique brunch item that I always go back to. Also, they have plablano pepper lasagna and butternut squash lasagna. While I was skeptical at first, they are truly a flavorful experience. The coffee is also wonderful! \\n\\nThe restaurant itself has a cute decor and cozy atmosphere. They have a small lounge area while you wait, and a nice patio when the weather is nice. \\n\\nThe staff has always been very welcoming and friendly. They always try to make your brunch experience great. The only time Randy was snarky to me, was when I accidentally forgot to sign my check. And it was funny. Maybe he gets frustrated at many things, but he is very nice and just wants to run a quality restaurant. And I think he does just that. \\n\\nOh and I almost forgot. The cake!!! Get the coconut cream-banana-lemon-whatever it is cake!! They have this little piece of heaven every weekend. It's drizzled with a Carmel sauce.

The food is nothing to rave about and the portions are small.  Overall, I thought the food was just average or a tad below average.  Parking can also be tough during lunch hours.

At first it feels kind of bad to decline a dish, but trust me it becomes a fun experience. It was so hard to pick which foods I wanted since they all looked and sounded so delicious.

I am not even sure where to start as the whole experience was so bad and it just kept getting worse.   It ruined our annual holiday dinner. It was a combination bad chef, no attention to detail, & horrible customer service.  \\n\\nIt started by the waiter spilling a full glass of wine onto my friend's steak that just arrived.  It was really no big deal mistakes happen and I had ordered the same thing and I could very easily cut my steak and half give it to my friend while they cook a new one.   I immediately cut into my steak and it was RAW on the inside.  Not rare, not medium rare but raw.  I ordered Medium for the record.  It was prompted sent back to the kitchen.  Next up the same steak that I ordered came back this time is was WELL done and charcoaled on the outside.  I was in shock.  The reason we went to this steak house was because we thought it was known for quality steaks.  We were wrong!  \\n\\nHere is where it gets weird.  My friend who had his steak doused in wine and broken glass also received a steak cut in half.  Where did this magical already cut steak come from?  Who's steak was it?  Was it the wine doused steak with potential broken glass in it?  Not sure?    So, we sent this hockey puck of steak back to the kitchen and asked to have the manager bring the next steak out.  Ten minutes later or so the manager Jacob arrived with two steaks and asked me to center cut them.  We both did only to find another very rare steak.  The manager agreed that it was clearly not medium and mine was RARE.  He then asked me if it was ok?  I almost felt like he didn't want deal with this situation and hoped that I would just take it so he could move on.   I said NO it was not ok it wasn't even close.  So, they took the steak back.  At this point our wives already already finished dinner.  So we decided the give up and leave... 45 minutes of steak mishap had already occurred and we had enough.    \\n\\nThe took care of our meal so that was one positive.  But, they didn't offer us desert so we had to walk down the street to Finale.   Plus, they left us sitting there at the table for 10 minutes before they came over and told us that the meal was free.  We actually had to ask a passing waiter to get the manager....so we knew what to do.  It's customer service 101. ..take care of the customer first.  Don't leave them wondering.   \\n\\nSo, our holiday dinner was ruined.  If you are a quality steak house Grill 23 claims to be...you expect them to at least be able to cook a steak to the temp you asked.   I understand sometimes med rare in some places are med in others.  But, this was not even close.  It was an embarrassment to the craft of steak cooking.  I love an occasional steak but I think i will stick with Mortons, Capital Grill, or Smith and Wollensky's.

It was so rich, even split three ways. A companion noted she would never be able to make lasagna the same way again. The ricotta was heavenly, light and grassy.\\n\\nFor our main courses we devoured \\"Three Little Pigs\\" - Loin, Belly, & House Made Sausage, Macaroni & Cheese - All of the pigs were flavorful and rich - the mac and cheese heady and decadent.\\n\\nHouse Made Pappardelle with Summer Vegetables, Arbequena Oil, Red Pepper Flake was so surprising. I rarely order a non-meat dish at these prices, but I was craving vegetables. The Pappardelle was SO light and flavorful, the spiciness of the pepper and the crisp youth of the vegetables combined perfectly. I loved this.\\n\\nOak Roasted Harris Ranch Flatiron Steak with Crispy Potato Ribbons, Crushed Olive \\"Chimi\\", and Watercress - I had a bit of the steak and found it perfectly cooked. The birthday girl found it perfectly great and cleaned her plate!\\n\\nSweet Corn Risotto- a bit of an aside side (ha! sorry, that was lame) was very creamy and very sweet.\\n\\nDessert was a peanut butter tart which I found too intense, but companions adored, and  a marscapone mousse which was agreed orgasm-worthy by all.\\n\\nWine was a moderately priced Four Vines Zinfadel - very tasty.\\n\\nHumpf. Everything was so tasty, but I had service and experience issues. We tipped for the sake of the food, and my companion hoped our server was new, but well...I have to admit I didn't like our table which was next to a giant red pipe and across from the bathroom tucked in the back. A strange choice as the restaurant was not full at 9pm, and there were plenty of comfortable tables in the main section. Our waiter, while sweet, had to be asked three times for something to fix the wobbly table, forgot our first appetizer order, took our second order and then returned fifteen minutes later to note they were out of it, and actually notified us that the proper way to order was to order everything we wanted at once, and he would manage the timing.

It's got a lot of great outdoor seating for people watching and a roof on top of it to keep us dry during the Florida afternoon showers. We check out the menu and decide to split a salad and a pizza. \\n\\nWe go for the Caprese salad (vine ripened tomatoes, fresh hand pulled mozzarella, organic grown Harvill Farms basil, organic first pressed extra virgin olive oil). There were both red and yellow tomatoes which I really liked. They have their individual flavors, and it looked really pretty, too. The mozz was delicious and tasted like real mozz, not just white cheese like some other pizza spots. I was a fan, and it certainly sounded more interesting than the other salad options. \\n\\nAs for the pizza, we look under the red pizzas list and choose the Allo Benno (prosciutto, pineapple, jalape√±os, San Marzano tomatoes, mozzarella). It looked like the best option to us. The prosciutto was very tasty and played well with the huge chunks of tomatoes, but I wish it had been cut with a little more tact. The giant chunks of the meat kept falling off with every bite I took. It was a little awkward. \\n\\nThe pineapple was good. It made it into a fancier Hawaiian pizza, obviously, and the jalapeno added a good chili taste (with absolutely no heat, don't worry). \\n\\nOverall, this was a solid little place.

We were not very happy, and the waitress did not offer any solution when I explained that was unsatisfactory. \\n\\nWe decided to also order 2 standard sushi rolls since they had a happy hour of buy one,  get one half off.

She kept telling me she can't take the coupon and started getting very loud. Mind you, the rolls we ordered were $5 each, so my giant happy hour discount was a grand $2.50.

I use this site a lot to judge restaurants and read through quite a few reviews that were seemingly positive. A few had mentioned that the service was not good, but if those are few and far between I boil it down to the person being too knit-picky with everything and probably an all around difficult person in general, I've been a waitress and bartender myself for many years and understand that while the job seems relatively easy, if the wrong person is seated with you it makes your job 50x harder. In any case, we gave it a go!\\n\\nWe chose this place in Porter Square, which is not the best of all the squares in the area (Davis, Union, Harvard...), a bit quieter in this area which is what we wanted. First, it said they had parking in the back -- no, no -- they have maybe 3 spaces in the back, dont even try it. When we went inside, we did not wait too long for our table, which was surprising because it was a Friday night at 8pm (I had made reservations on Open Table earlier) -- I still thought we'd have to wait but it was not bad. When we were seated and our waiter came over, you could INSTANTLY tell he was in a sour mood and did NOT want to be there. He did not greet us and ask us how we were, his first line was \\"what do you want to drink?\\". We ordered drinks (2 espresso martinis which were NOT made traditionally, it was simply espresso vodka and regular vodka, and a vanilla lovers special  which was DISGUSTING). We also ordered an app (the Aged Cheddar fondue). He took easily 25 minutes to bring our drinks out...frustrating. Once we got the appetizer, it looked good enough, it did not list on the menu the items that came with the fondue but it was definitely not worth the $20 in price...we got some hard pretzel bites, clearly frozen broccoli, broken  up cauliflower, salty little meatballs half cooked -- it was disastrous. There was also what looked like a beet in addition to those items but when I said it aloud, the waiter quickly snapped that it was a \\"pickled pear\\". Oops.\\n\\nHe did not ask us how the appetizer was and asked for our meal options in the same manner as he asked for our drinks, unenthusiastically and rushed. Our meal took 30ish minutes to come out and was brought by different waiters. The server never came over and asked how our food was and if everything was cooked correctly. At one point he saw me struggling to get through the pork loin with a butter knife and finally offered something stronger -- should've assumed it from the start, I would've anyway. In any case my sisters got the salmon and I got the porkloin. Very tough, not quite worth the price either, not bad, not anything to rave about either. When our server finally came back around 45 minutes after we got our food, w decidedd to try one more drink. We ordered it from him and he rolled his eyes and sighed at us blatantly. I have no idea why on Earth he had such an attitude we are 3 really nice girls that just wanted to have a nice Friday night after a hectic work week. The food and drink reviews seemed good enough, but I have to be honest for $40 bucks each it was not at all worth it. We were treated like garbage and the food and drink were mediocre, and thats being nice. After a long work week you look forward to unwinding at nice little restaurant with appropriate treatment/attention, good conversation, good food, and good drink. This place had none of the above. Terrible, terrible, terrible service. We even asked to speak with the manager and she got as far as \\"I super apologize\\". Oh, thanks, that seems really sincere.\\n\\nAll in all, we'll never go back. Not a good enough experience all around.

I work very close to it so I go pretty frequently. I usually get the same thing every time so I can't speak for a lot of their food. I have tried their Gyoza which gets a 5 star review in my book! Gyoza is literally my favorite thing ever:) What I usually go with is their Maki Combo - 2 sushi rolls (or 3 depending on how hungry I am) and it comes with their salad. I always get the spicy tuna and spicy salmon rolls and they are always on point. I have never had bad sushi here. They put a little bit of crunchy breading inside the rolls which gives it some nice texture.  Their salad however, is not great. Honestly I couldn't even eat it yesterday. They put way too much dressing on it and it's not good. When I get salads at sushi places they usually has a very strong ginger flavor and the consistency is thicker and crunchier. This tasted like warm, watery mayonnaise with a teeny tiny hint of asian flavor to it. \\n\\nThe ambiance is very welcoming. The restaurant has a cozy feeling to it and is always very clean. I think where Ronin loses some points is with their service. Yesterday my friend and I were seated immediately, but it was probably 15 minutes before someone came to take our drink orders. The place wasn't ridiculously busy either so I wasn't sure what took so long. After we got our drink orders we had to wait at least another 10-15 minutes to order food. After we got the orders in the food came out pretty quickly. However, most of the time the food takes a really long time as well. I went there a few months ago around 1:30 to try and avoid the lunch rush. The servers had their children at the restaurant and had them sitting at the table next to us eating lunch. I love kids and family owned/operated places. I wouldn't have had an issue with this at all except for the fact that it took us 1.5 hours to order, get food and we never got our drinks refilled. The funny thing is our server was sitting with his kids and the other server I am assuming was his wife and they never looked over to see if we needed anything. We were literally sharing the long booth against the wall with them. We finally asked them for our checks and felt awkward interrupting them. I haven't had that happen again since that that time. So it may not happen often. \\n\\nI still plan on eating here pretty frequently mostly due to it's location.

The accommodations were fine but the check in and shuttle experience was poor.\\n\\nFirst, the credit card charge was $80 more than the room rate plus taxes that were disclosed at the time of reservation.  According to the front desk clerk, $50 of this was a \\"hold\\" for incidentals but the front desk could not tell me what the other $30 was for and my only option was to just pay it and deal with it when I check out. Questioning this charge literally added 20 full minutes to the check in time due to a mix of computer issues and the front desk clerk running around trying  unsuccessfully to determine the reason for the extra charges. By this point, lines backed up behind the three of us guests who were checking in resulting in 30+ minute wait times to check in. (It was 5:15pm on a Friday).  Anyway we finally got checked in.\\n\\nThe next issue was with the shuttle.  As I mentioned, my daughter was here for a gymnastics competition and for some reason (which frankly I don't agree with, but it is what it is), they are also graded on their appearance.  They have to have their hair in a pony tail with curls, blah, blah, blah.  The forecast for the next morning was showers, so we wanted to grab a hotel shuttle to get to the convention center and avoid a bad hair day for our budding gymnast.  At check in, I asked about securing the shuttle for the next morning at 7:15am and he said it would be no issue.  Just call down to the front desk before we head down.  Cool.\\n\\nLater that evening we were having dinner with the other gymnastics families and got the sense that the shuttle was much more limited and exclusive than we were led to believe.  On the way up to the room for the night, we checked with the front desk to see if we could reserve a spot.  Now we were told the shuttle was full unless we left at 6:15AM.  So we missed an opportunity to get a spot on the shuttle due to bad information given at check-in.  What's worse is now we were told the convention center was just a short 5 minute walk.  Being unfamiliar with the area, I'd rather walk 5 minutes than drive and pay to park, so we decided to walk.  Fifteen minutes later we arrived and my daughter's curls which she literally worked all night for had disappeared.  We got caught in a bit of rain and the walk was much further than we thought.  If we were told up front this would be a 15 minute walk, we would just have driven. \\n\\nWhen we got our final bill for checking out, it was correct.  The $80 extra that was put on hold was not charged.  If the front desk clerk could have explained this up front it would have saved a lot of frustration.  I'm hopeful this was isolated and that our next experience would be fine."},{"name":"Park's Edge","address":"913 Bernina Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"I've been here pre and post gordon ramsay. they changed the interior from light green and oranges to a softer brown with sheer curtains. classy.

I have been waiting for this restaurant to open for some time (it was supposed to open in Spring 2008).  The first official night was last night (21 JUN 2008) which is a little later than spring, but not too bad.\\n\\nI and three friends had dinner at 4th & Swift last night.  We had reservations for 5:30 (very early) but we had a concert to get to later so we decide to eat early.  We arrived and the menus were still being put together and no other customers were there.  I received an email saying that it was BYOB since they didn't have their liquor license yet (should be next week, by the way) so we brought some beer and wine with us.\\n\\nThe food was really simple, great flavor and really amazing.  Most of it is local (within the southeast) and it's all organic.  I LOVE supporting local food producers and it's worth it.  The quality is so much better and you can feel good about keeping a local farmer in business.  So, back to the food:  i ordered an arugula salad with the most amazing Parmesan beignets ever!  the beignets need to be an app on their own but they work so well with the salad.  I also ordered the swordfish, which was on a fennel salad and fried calamari were also on the plate.  The calamari was great -- some of the best I've had in the city (tender with perfect breading).  The swordfish, while not exactly local, was from North Carolina.  It was perfectly cooked -- very simple (no crazy sauces) with a really nice wood smoke flavor.  My partner got the scallops (those aren't local either) and they were super sweet and also perfectly cooked.  They were served over a bed a sweet corn risotto which we ended up taking home because it is so good.  We also ordered a side of the macaroni and cheese -- it was perfect.  The mac and cheese was baked in it's own little dish and super creamy/cheesy..  The others in our party also ordered really good food (so they said -- i didn't taste).  One got the \\"Three Little Pigs\\" which is a trio of pork (loin, belly and house made sausage) with a side of macaroni and cheese.  The other ordered 2 \\"small\\" plates.  Apparently, the menu will change quite frequently (most likely due to what is fresh that day) so who knows if what I ate will be on the menu next time.  I do know that they need to make an app of the calamari to show everyone what good fried calamari tastes like and they need to have the parmesan beignets on the menu every day because they were just that good.\\n\\nThe decor/ambiance of this restaurant is really nice.  The location is an old loft in the old 4th Ward.  There is an \\"open\\" kitchen in the back -- actually it's got a wall of glass in front of it, but you can see what they are doing back there, which I always love.  The colors are warm browns and neutrals.  The tables are well spaced, which I love because who wants to sit on top of their neighbor.  There is a row of really cute 2 seat booths on one side which would make the perfect romantic dining spot.  I didn't get a lot of time to explore the place since we had to get to the show, but the bar looks really nice and large.  I also didn't get a chance to see this place when the sun goes down but I bet it is gorgeous.\\n\\nThe waitstaff was GREAT!!!  Everyone was very attentive and we heard that they went through 3 weeks of training prior to opening.  Our server was very nice and knew the menu backwards and forwards.  The hostess who seated us was very friendly.  It pays to have a smiling face at the door when you walk in -- it was my first impression and it lasts.\\n\\nOverall, this place is great.  I know it was opening night, and they do have some little kinks to work out but it was amazing.  They obviously put a lot of thought into everything and it shows.

The wienerschnitzel (pork)  was possibly the best I've had, which includes Wolfgang Puck's at his restaurant in Orlando. The bratwurst served with grilled onions was unique and great, with the flavor and juiciness you expect from sausage but a lighter texture that doesn't weigh you down like sausage. Finally, the ice cream cookie sandwich was awesome. Their homemade chocolate chip cookie are special with a small touch of coconut in them.\\n\\nIn terms of the decor/service, cafe Hibiscus has a welcoming air to it that makes it feel like your walking into a very friendly person's home. Our server was extremely sweet. The chef/owner came out at then end of our meal to thank us for coming in. She's from Hawaii - her mother a native Hawaiian and her father a chef from Switzerland whom taught her everything he knows. The place definitely has the perfect combination of the aloha spirit with coziness of the Swiss alps, executed well with a feminine touch."},{"name":"Aab India","address":"2400 E Main St","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"First time at this location and I really enjoyed it!

We concluded that they had turned off the heat despite the freezing external temperatures, instead relying on the warmth from the brick oven and the crowd to sustain the temperature.  This failed to work, and we struggled to get comfortable as we waited 35 minutes for our pizza (once we had ordered) while people crawled all over us to get to their tables.  \\n\\nOur server was absolutely amazing.

They only offer some weak Almond milk and they cannot foam it. So...you are a coffee shop, get a non-dairy option that you can make proper drinks with. There are plenty!

That being said, let's accept the fact that the convenience factor trumps the high prices in my case. I do not HAVE to shop here, but I choose to because I am lazy, and sometimes I'm willing to pay a little more knowing something is good quality, and five seconds from my kitchen.\\n\\n More specifically and in the Market's favor, I will step right up and say that the staff are friendly and now recognize myself and my boyfriend, the produce is always fresh and nicely displayed-- and some things, the RIGHT things, aren't too expensive-- and the pre-made salads are in fact a real bargain!!! The other day for lunch I split one with my man- we chose the chicken teriyaki with a honey mustard dressing. The plastic container looks small-ish but the salad inside ($5.99)  filled two large plates and the whole thing tasted super yum!!! You just sometimes have to look around for the bargains, because they're there...albeit few and far between.\\n\\nSo, the salads are a plus, and some of the produce. Bypass: the cheeses and dairy in general unless you're in a pinch-- these things are way cheaper at Trader Joes or Shaws. Same with any canned goods- way too pricey. The booze, especially the beer, is ridiculously overpriced but, again......SO convenient!!! The fresh rolls and breads are fair-ishly priced, and I guess the desserts are okay too. They have a nice selection of greeting/holiday/birthday cards. What is my point to all this? I go to the Broadway Market because it's close and the stuff is good quality. Do I buy everything here? No. Do I buy eggs and bacon on Saturday mornings? Yes. In the end my motto is: in a pinch, stop by the Broadway market. Or if you want a dank salad."},{"name":"Sun in My Belly","address":"2161 College Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"My roommate and I went to brunch on a Saturday morning around 10:30am.

We preferred indoors and were seated within a couple minutes.\\n\\nOur waiter approaches, and I must have missed something because he was well into a convo on tomatoes when I suddenly realized \\"we are in a convo about tomatoes\\".  Fortunately my dinner companion was holding up her end of the convo well, so hopefully my confusion didn't show.\\n\\nLooking at the menu I knew I wanted Veal Marsala and she said she'd go with Eggplant Parm.

I swear to you, he was not gone but a few minutes and emerged with our full dinner.

My friend makes a remark early on regarding hers \\"it's all sauce\\" and it DID look like all sauce.  Then as she's 75% through it, she says \\"there is no eggplant in this\\".  So she brings this up to the waiter and he insists (nicely, but still) that what remained in the bowl was eggplant.  Okay, am coming to grips with the fact that I'm a bit of an eggplant-addict.  Let me tell you, number one if that was eggplant--- PATHETIC.  Number two, I don't think that was eggplant.  So after telling her this was the eggplant, he offers to bring her more.

It was rich and flavorful and I could've enjoyed more. The steak presentation; told by my parents to be amazing, was something I was most looking forward to Bry seeing.\\n\\nAfter we ordered our drinks we were presented with one of the best steak presentations I've seen in a while. Louis really rocked and we had a happy adventure. I ordered the Kansas City Strip because of the cognac cracked pepper sauce and the bone in style which produces a richer and more moist tasting steak. I convinced Bry to order the Wagyu Kobe Steak which was said to be the caviar of all steaks and cuts like butter. For our sides we ordered the lobster mac and cheese and the broccoli with garlic along with their house wines.\\n\\nAs we awaited our food we were presented with lobster bisque sampling which is Bry's favorite soup coincidentally and we both agreed it was superb. Louis also brought out garlic cheese butter bread which we really loved as well. Then came our meals. I've never had the Kansas City Strip but it was beyond amazing the flavor was very unique and intense, I really enjoyed it yet it was dwarfed by Bry's Wagyu; WOW, slap my momma- it was so rich and flavorful- not to mention it cut like butter (no lies in the description) we also ordered truffle sauce for my steak and bleu cheese crumbles for Bry's. I was happy that mine was on the side, because I really didn't care for it, but I did think the bleu cheese crumbles, complimented Bry's Wagyu well. \\n\\nThe portions here are enormous and we definitely had leftovers that we took home and savored. The pricing here is not bad, because the quality and quantity of food you get can't be beat.

Now, it's a chain restaurant desperately trying to differentiate itself from the myriad of other Sysco outposts in town by giving things an \\"Austin\\" twist. The result is another mediocre \\"Southwestern\\" chain that's only a step above Chili's, but with much less revenue and patronage.\\n\\nIn the race to expansion, the menu has been dumbed down to the lowest common denominator. Good dishes like the red snapper have been replaced by the likes of grilled miso salmon, a first-year culinary student dish if there ever was one. Migas are gluey and served with gummy flour tortillas. Muffins were rock hard, and the skillet cornbread was soft and pillowy, with no hint of a carmelized crust. Even holdover signatures like the shrimp and guacamole tostadas have morphed into unrecognizable, poorly-seasoned versions of their former selves. The service has suffered as well; our server's attitude was as lackluster as the iced tea he served me.\\n\\nLike most good chain menus nowadays, vegetarian and gluten-free options are clearly demarcated for those with dietary restrictions.

My salad came with neither. It did, however, come on a plastic plate with a packaged tub of Ken's Caesar dressing. Huge pet peev, a Caesar salad that isn't tossed. It was one of those salads u grab at the gas station. Def not worth the $10 they were attempting to charge. Luckily the lack of toppings provided the perfect opportunity to order the wings instead. These are prob your best bet. Spicy, vinegary goodness...drenched in sauce, which I like. I accidentally splattered the guy next to me. He didn't notice. I also ordered a side of potato salad.

I started off with a Chocolate Chip latte. It came to the table looking like a latte lovers dream with all sorts of pretty swirls, froth and whatnot and it tasted just as good as it looked! Next I had the shrimp and grits. The grits were cheese, the shrimp adorned with BBQ sauce and also came with two pieces of sausage and a big ole crouton (just seemed like garlic toast to me but whatever). I loved that it was nice HEALTHY portion! I've gone to places before that have literally gien me ONE GRIT AND ONE SHRIMP and have left me hungrier than when I came in! Not true for this place! Not only did it taste excellent but it left me fulfilled! \\n\\nAs we were about to leave we noticed they have a nice assortment of mimoas ranging from regular, raspberry pomergrante, and asian pear mint. We couldn't leave without trying at least ONE! We went with the raspberry. They bring the champagne to your table along with a shooter of the flavor you chose so you can decide yourself how much or how little of the flavor you want.

I haven't had conch fritters since moving from Miami so we decided they'd be a great start to our meal. While a bit overpriced in my opinion ($9 for 6 pieces), they were highly tasty and their crispy exterior worked perfectly with the bold remoulade sauce. \\n\\nAs our entr√©es, my fianc√© chose their Cioppino ($18) and I chose the Monster Mahi sandwich ($16) with a cup of Tuna Chili as my side; both were great! I chose to have my Mahi cooked \\"jerked\\" style which added a nice spice, although I would've preferred more heat. The sandwich had such great flavor, the only con was that the Kaiser roll didn't holdup and having bread that falls apart as I eat is a pet peeve of mine. The chili was a nice side, however the tuna disappeared, I'd swear there was only beef in there.\\n\\nLooking for a meal that has absolutely no negatives and is sure to fill you up, well then the Cioppino is for you. Jumbo shrimp, mussels, clams and fish cooked in a great tasting clam and tomato broth served over linguini.

Since we weren't starving at that point, we opted for ordering an appetizer and entree to split.  \\n\\nI'm always a fan of chicken satay, so that was the app, and my friend chose the Earth, Wind and Fire entree - medium spiciness.  \\n\\nThat satay was awesome - mostly because of how it was presented.  Instead of the usual grilled chicken skewers with peanut dipping sauce, what arrived at our table was a tiny, flaming grill skewers of already cooked chicken just waiting to be warmed again, peanut sauce and slices of cucumber mixed in a sweet and sour sauce.  Awesome!  I love playing with my food!  So we grilled our skewers up campfire-style then easily removed them from the skewer and added the sauce and cucumbers.  Very tasty and so fun to do.\\n\\nThe Earth, Wind & Fire dish was good too - it had a nice presentation: big heap of veggies like baby corn, water chestnuts, broccoli, carrots, etc mixed with the shrimp and chicken in a sweet and spicy (but not overly so) tamarind sauce on one side of the plate and rice on the other.  It was pretty good - a little bit too sweet and spicy (weird that both were a touch too strong) for my tastes, but since we were sharing, we polished it off without trouble.\\n\\nThroughout the meal our server was attentive refilling water, clearing plates and cutlery away and returning with clean ones quickly.

However this year I was not allowed to continue with the avoidance of any celebration of my nativity due to the loving insistence of my bride to be.  Since you do not turn 43 every day, and it is a sufficiently unmilestonish number (50 will be unacknowledged!),  to mark the occasion my fiancee let me choose where we would have dinner.  Let me tell you - I chose well!\\n\\nMooo is situated up on Beacon Hill.  An easy stroll from the Boston Common Garage but we took advantage of the valet.  I elected for an early seating and I think that helped us have a great experience and an attentive waiter as it was a very full house later in the evening.  We were a bit early for the 5:30 pm dining room opening and enjoyed a cocktail at the bar.  Our barkeep was friendly, guided Stef to a delicious pink drink served in a martini glass and gave a handsome pour to my Jameson's, neat, with a water back.\\n\\nSoon we were seated and had a chance to drink in the ambiance.  As others have said and I can say it no better -  \\"stylish and elegant while still managing to be comfortable and welcoming\\".  Stef particularly liked the paper lantern wrapping of the chandeliers and the muted tones.  Almost, but not quite, too dimly lit,  it was very conducive to a romantic dinner.\\n\\nAfter being guided to our table we were greeted by our waiter.  Throughout the meal he was knowledgeable of the menu, made excellent suggestions and had perfect timing.  Suggesting 'rare' for my 14 oz dry aged NY sirloin alone was enough to earn him his tip.  Guiding Stef to the lobster bisque was another moment of brilliance.\\n\\nI chose a '99 Chateauneuf du Pape, a smooth Rhone wine that stood up to the beef but was soft enough to compliment both the bisque and the cheese we planned on for dessert.  The wine list was extensive and filled with all manner options for pairing with the menu.  There was a Duckhorn I was dying to have but it will have to be for the next visit when I am paying :-)\\n\\nThe bisque and the Waygu beef dumplings were out of this world.  I am allergic to shellfish but Stef reported a \\"1/4 of a tail' at the center of a creamy broth.  I think she would have liked it in smaller pieces for ease of eating, but the flavors - from the look on her face - were spot on.  The six dumplings were two small bites each, which allowed me to bathe every bite in the sauce they were served in.  A dozen bites of Waygu beef seasoned with garlic and onion each followed by a sip of the fruit of the Rhone and suddenly being 43 was not seeming all that bad.\\n\\nAfter a welcome interval to talk and enjoy our wine, dinner was served.  Stef opted for the petit filet, medium and savored every bite.  My rare dry aged sirloin was the best I have had in 10 years.  We complimented the steaks with asparagus in Hollandaise and gratin potatoes.  Seriously - have the gratin potatoes.  I ordered the borderlaise, but honestly it just did not improve on the meal, and was superfluous.  The meat was so delicious that a bit of the marrow butter served in the bone and sprinkle of salt was all the compliment that made sense.  Period.  The soft-pretzel like bread added a welcome dimension, but I highly recommend restraint as it was very filling (but I would have eaten all four pieces under any other circumstance!).\\n\\nThe fourth and final movement of this symphony of flavor and experience was the chef's selection of cheeses.  I don't know what it is but finishing a great meal with small bites of a selection of cheese is an essential note.  All were very good - in particular there was a soft Vermont with fig (as I recall) and a Stilton served with a honeycomb that were head and shoulders above the others.  A perfect finish.\\n\\nA last little taste as we readied ourselves to leave was a single bite of a kitchen made s'more each.  It was a bit of marshmellow and what tasted like a graham cracker crust dipped in chocolate.  Stef claimed that she would burst if she ate another bite, so the gentleman that I am, I ate them both :-)\\n\\nIt was as nice a dining experience as I have had in a long time.  I hope all of you have as wonderful a time that we had if you decide to give Mooo a try.  Know one thing before you go, it was an expensive night out but in the few times I have been to Mooo, it was worth it."},{"name":"Bella Vista","address":"288 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Excellent value for lunch.

We had Friday night reservations and the place was quiet and about half full, which was perfect for us for that night.  We were looking for something casual and enjoyable and this worked out well.\\n\\nThere are two rooms, which for brunch is fine, but one is clearly better for dinner and we were seated in that room right by the window, so we were able to enjoy the great spring night.\\n\\nThey had a Prie Fixe menu but allowed us to order whatever combination we wanted from that and the standard menu with the Scout Mob, which I thought was a very nice touch.  We had the Braised Pork Belly, which was excellent, if larger, it would have been a great entree.  We had salads, they were nondescript, nothing to complain about, but nothing really stood out.  We shared the Pepper-Seared Tenderloin of Beef, which like the Pork Belly was excellent.  It was BYOB without a corkage fee and since we typically bring our wine this was also a plus for us.\\n\\nThe desserts were a bit of a let down and I will explain this a little more in a moment.\\n\\nThe service was underwhelming.  Our waiter struggled with pronouncing the specials and didn't have much of an understanding as to what they were.  When we asked about certain dishes he hadn't tried any of them and therefore had no opinion of them.  My girlfriend and I typically like to eat later in the evening and we have found that restaurants always run out of certain dishes, especially desserts.  So we have gotten into the habit of asking if anything is running low, so we can put in our order in advance to make sure we get what we want.  We did this here and the waiter assured us they had plenty of everything.  When it came time to order dessert our top two choices were gone.  Now this is not a five-star restaurant, so expectations needs to be in check.  This restaurant is wonderful for what it is, but the service was just a little too casual.  Not bad, the waiter was a very nice guy, but there a few small things stuck out during the meal that did take away from the experience a little, but not enough that we wouldn't go back and have a great time.  I recommend this place to anyone, it is unique, casual and fun.\\n\\nTo Recap:\\n\\nThe Good:  Food is interesting, fresh and enjoyable.  The staff is friendly and location gives it a feeling of finding a hidden gem in the city, which is fun.\\n\\nThe Bad:  A little nit-picky, but the service was a little too casual even for the laid back feel of the place.  Not to be confused with a bad attitude, everyone was very friendly.\\n\\nThe Band This Restaurant Most Resembles: The Grateful Dead.

We then got our check and I then went to redeem my groupon.  My server then tells me that it is not good for alcohol.  I was a little confused because it had nothing stated in the fine print about it not being good towards alcoholic beverages.  I asked her to explain this and she told me it was a law.  I was then even more confused.  I asked the owner/manager to come over for a better explanation.  He then tells me that its a law that was passed on Sept 1, that you can not discount alcohol.  I have never heard of this, but maybe its true?.?.? The total of our bill was $44, $20 of it being mimosas. My groupon was worth $35.

The parsley was a nice touch. \\n\\nI didn't get to eat my Portland bowl until later, but it far surpassed my expectations. The ratio of quinoa to greens to tempeh to other veggies was perfect (some places give you so many greens you hardly know what to do with them).

My ex-roommate, R, introduced me to Casa back in January or so, and I've been hooked ever since. In turn, I've introduced 10+ (and counting) people, the majority of whom b****ed and moaned, adamantly vouching to hate it beforehand because of the meatless menu and extreme concept, and all of whom left reeling over how it completely trumped their expectations. Talk about foot-in-mouth syndrome. Or maybe that just means you should come here with zero or negative expectations... \\n\\nThis is a pretty detailed post so if you want the short version: TRY IT BEFORE YOU KNOCK IT. You might be surprised. \\n\\nThat being said... This might be my favorite restaurant in Austin, at least tied for first, for a couple of reasons: (1) Every single meal I've had here has been *consistently* delicious. That's not something that comes easy. I've never walked away thinking \\"damn, I wish we went somewhere else.\\" In fact, I've left other restaurants thinking, \\"damn, I knew we shoulda just gone to Casa.\\" (2) The meal is very well balanced and very satisfying. Afterwards, I always feel healthy and totally rejuvenated. Casa does my body gooooood. (3) I enjoy the simplicity of eating what's put in front of me without having to flip through 10 pages of options. It's nice to not have to order off a menu. I'm usually the one who orders something I haven't tried off menus, and, not gonna lie, it doesn't always work out. \\n\\nI love walking through their garden up to the building. The fresh smell of jasmine always reminds me of my childhood and puts a smile on my face as I stroll up. I get an enchanting vibe from their garden and can't wait for nice weather to sit outside to enjoy my meal. The last time we tried sitting outside, my brother and I got eaten by mosquitoes and had to move in after 5 min. The people here are oozing with kindness.\\n\\nIt's $12 for the meal which includes soup, salad, and a main plate of fresh, flavorful, deliciousness. They also have water and hot/cold teas available. There is a set menu, so you don't order anything. The place is set up cafeteria/community/whatever-you-want-to-call-it style. You get your own tray and silverware, pick up some soup and salad, then find a place to sit, then someone will bring the main plate out to you, and when you're done, you bus your own table. The main plate always includes a type of grain (usually brown rice - which is super tasty if you try out some soy sauce over it ), greens (usually kale) with some amazing sauce, pickled vegetables, beans, and a vegetable \\"main\\" course (which varies every night, but they do have themed nights: http://www.casadeluz.org/dining.htm). If you're still hungry afterwards, you can always go for 2nds. \\n\\nThose who say it's \\"bland\\" or lacking flavor should try mixing the foods together. While each group is good on its own, the best way to eat it, as R and I have discovered, is to mix it all up and get a little bit of everything in each bite. We also like to add sesame and a little soy sauce to the soups. R and I have mouth-watering dreams about their Tamale and taco nights. R claims the sauce they use in their tacos tastes like chicken. I haven't tried any of the desserts yet, but R likes em. \\n\\nI know it's not for everyone, but it's worth a try."},{"name":"Marrakesh Restaurant","address":"1201 NW 21st Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"We all met for dinner at Marrakesh for a fabulous dinner.

I also had a great waitress that understood how to take care of customers.\\n\\nPros:\\n - the waitress apologized earnestly when it seemed that the kitchen goofed the order and sent everything out LATE and all at the same time. I appreciated her honesty as we got our appetizers, salads, and food all at once (and it was a slow down time with only 14 people in the place?)\\n - the (late) food was actually cooked to order. My blackened fish was \\"extra blackened\\" like I requested and the crawfish came out seasoned well with a good sample of potatoes and corn\\n - the waitress kept our drinks filled and was cordial all around\\n\\nCons\\n - the hostess gave me a perplexed look when the first booth she attempted to sit me at (near the door) had a loose seat. When I sat on it, it collapsed to the floor as it was off of its frame.. so I tried to adjust it thinking it was a gimmick that I sat down wrong. Nope, just a terribly bad seat that needed to be placed firmly in the frame.. all the while she just stood there looking at me. So I suggested for a new seat... she put the menus on the table of the booth where the seat just collapsed.. then I REQUESTED a NEW SEAT and noted that I would NOT be sitting there uncomfortable during my meal... so that threw off her seating chart apparently and oh the horror she had to go clean the wax pencil from her hostess seating station and put me in a new seat. I know they equally assign seats to be fair to the staff.. and I then mentioned that she may want to get the seat adjusted or fixed so she wouldn't have to keep avoiding seating people there.\\n  [Then] I did what I sometimes do, to open conversation, etc... I actually apologized to her for MY inconvenience on HER.. she said nothing and just walked me to a more secure booth seat for my friends (coming soon after myself) and I. I watched her back at her hostess station and she seemed to get \\"catty\\" with the other hostess and look in my general direction; I interpreted it as if I did something (wow...haha..whatever)... I guess it was my concern for wanting her to take charge and get me a safe seat and resolve the other issue ..\\n\\n  As noted, THANKFULLY, I had a great waitress and the rest of the day was well. \\n\\n I mark the hostess issue up to: not being concerned with customers, youth/inexperience, or just that separated attitude some people have in the service industry of restaurants (bar staff vs. floor staff vs. kitchen vs. front of the house staff)\\n\\nOverall my dining experience was good and I didn't come here to judge it based on the hostess (even though they are the FIRST impression customers get) and I will come back probably for crawfish next season as well."},{"name":"Crowne Plaza Portland-Downtown Conv Ctr","address":"1441 NE 2nd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I stayed with my husband and 2 children while we were in the city for my daughter's dr visits at Doernbecher hospital, first they charged $18/ night to park, outrageous!

The Greek salad had a very generous amount of tasty feta cheese and the garlic rolls they served along with it were very flavorful. I was very hopeful for the pizza but I'll admit that I was disappointed when it arrived. The crust was a good consistency and held up well but it was lacking in flavor. It needed a shot of olive oil and maybe some salt. The meatballs were cut into little cubes, which I didn't like. I prefer chunks of round meatballs so you bite into something that may be a little crunchy outside from the heat of the oven but still substantial enough in size so you can taste the seasoned meat. The extra garlic on our pie didn't come through at all. It was a pleasant enough pie, certainly fine if you are in the area for a movie and want pizza beforehand but we felt it was on the pricey end of the spectrum and not really worth it.

We initially wanted breakfast, and he kindly accommodated us by whipping up a specialty crepe. The first crepe had spinach, cheese-delicious homemade cheese that was reminiscent of bufala mozzarella-and a well-salted and buttery egg on top. The second one he prepared was the Kefta crepe. My boyfriend and I were genuinely surprised by the quality of ingredients as well as the care and attention used to create these fantastic dishes. We came hungry and had room for dessert.

Now we have to spend $5 extra for both people to have the dinner combo.  I find it suspicious that this change happened right after the online deals came out... could be they did it on purpose.  Most of their specialty rolls are priced between $12-16ish..\\n\\nAside from being a bit expensive for a place that is not fancy at all, we've had pretty questionable service quite a few of the times we've been there.  The service is fairly slow even when the restaurant is empty, and if it's crowded, you can forget seeing your server more than once every half hour.  One memorable time, there were about 3 tables being used in the whole restaurant, we had finished our food, gotten our check, and were just waiting for the credit card to be run... We watched our waitress sit at the bar for 15-20 minutes watching a sports game before she bothered to see if we were ready to go.  That's inexcusable service.\\n\\nI am a fan of the lunch combo.  $9 for two rolls and comes with soup and salad both.\\n\\nThere's nothing wrong with the actual food, it's fine.

This second experience was disappointing, and frankly, embarrassing. I will only list the most significant issues that I had. There were several other problems, but I choose to let those go.\\n\\nKeep this in mind as you read below: during my phone call to make reservations, I initially asked the hostess if the kitchen would be able to accommodate such a large group so late in the evening (my prior life was spent working in restaurants, I know that not all kitchens are created equal). I was told \\"We'll make it work\\". I already felt nervous at this point, but ended up letting it go. \\n\\nAfter being seated, I looked around us and noted that there were about 2 two-tops (probably dates), and another single patron (a table of about 9 had just left) it wasn't a packed house.\\n\\nI ordered 5 side dishes to share amongst 11 people. Id' guess if you take two bites each, 5  sides are appropriate for 6 people (at most). I really wish the server suggested that I order more, especially after I gave him a roll call of side dishes for the table - and explaining that these were not for me and they were to share amongst us all. \\n\\nNot everyone wanted steak, and not everyone eats meat (some ordered oysters, salads, soups, and other items). So we certainly didn't back up the kitchen ordering with a huge number of steaks.\\n\\nWe ordered a total of 6 steaks around the table: 1 steak was overcooked, and rough to eat or cut.\\n\\nAnother steak came after the entire table finished eating our meals - we were nearly ready to pay for the tab. It was explained to us that the chef overcooked that initial steak, which is why he had to make another one so late in the process. \\n\\nThis is no excuse to keep a patron hungry and upset, and there was nearly no apology or care given about this particular issue. \\n\\nNeither person wanted to complain or send their food back. This is not a patron's job - to send food back. \\n\\nI am not confident in the service and kitchen at Urban Farmer for groups or a sunday dinner.

Kitsch: crazy Coca-Cola signs from years ago.\\nKitschtacky: Having some tiny-ass 19\\" inch screen TVs bolted high to the ceiling with this ambiance. I honestly don't think anyone ever watches.\\n\\nThe dark-lit room kind of turns me off but we come here for the food, not 60W bulbs so let's get down to business. I always want to eat a truckload of catfish or shrimp, but I know I'll feel like a fatty. That point becomes instantly moot when I remind myself that I'll probably gorge myself in a basket or ten of hush puppies anyway.\\n\\nSo I usually settle for a best of both worlds: the catfish combo platter, that way I also get some shrimps.

Try the jalapeno tartar sauce, even if you don't do spicy, it's not that potent, but just enough for you to feel wild if the craziest thing you ever done in your life was mix decaf with regular.

Prior to our last experience, this was my fiance's favorite steakhouse in Boston because of the kobe cap steak.  It's #3 on my list.  Del Frisco's is #1, Abe and Louie's, #2.\\n\\nOur most recent experience this past Saturday night, was a comedy of errors, and it's very likely that we will never return here to celebrate a special occasion again.  \\nWe arrived promptly for our 6:30 pm reservation and were brought to our table, on the 2nd floor, right away.  The table was a series of 2 tops and one seat was swooshed up against the wall and the other was right against the back of another diner's seat.  It was uncomfortable, to say the least, so we politely asked for a different table, which was accommodated.  We were then sat at a roomy 4 top and Gino was our server.  \\nThings went downhill with Gino.  My FI ordered a Chopin dirty martini w olives.  After the first sip, he said he tasted no olive juice in the drink.  When Gino came back to take our dinner order, he asked if it was a dirty martini, to which Gino said no.  He took the drink and brought him a new, over brined martini, which was perfect.  \\nFor apps, he ordered a half dozen oysters and I, the Caesar salad.  On our last visit, in Sept, I ordered the Caesar salad and it had a lot of anchovies on it, which I loved, and is why I ordered it again on this visit. When I started eating the salad, which was very difficult, because they didn't chop up the romaine leaves at all, I saw that there were no anchovies on it.  I really loved the anchovies and didn't want to keep eating the salad until I had some.  My FI had finished his oysters, and a busboy came to clear his plate, so I asked about the anchovies.  Gino came to the table and I told him about the lkast time I had the salad and he told me that since \\"most people don't like anchovies, they don't put them on the salad unless they're requested.\\" Strange, since the last time, I didn't have to ask for them and I got a lot of them.  I finally got a side of anchovies after a good 15 minutes had passed.  I was putting one of the last bites in my mouth as a busboy snatched the plate away, because our steaks were ready.\\nI ordered the petite filet (two, 4 oz filets) cooked med rare and FI ordered his usual kobe cap steak, cooked medium.  I ordered mine MR, anticipating a Med temp, as past visits I've ordered Med and they were slightly overcooked.  As anticipated, they were cooked to a perfect Med temp. When F/I first cut into the center of his steak, it was cooked Med, as requested.  As he was eating, the steak was actually bloody pink and rare.  He didn't want to send the steak back, in fear of it being tampered with, so he left almost half of the $85 steak on his plate.   When Gino saw we were finished, he agreed that the steak was not cooked correctly and offered to re fire it, but it was too little, too late at that point.  \\n\\nWe were both still hungry, so we ordered the coconut cake for dessert.  WOW, that cake was SO good, clearly the best part of the meal.  I found the pineapple sherbet to be a perfect complement to the cake.  \\nWhen Gino brought the dessert over he said, \\"this is on the house.\\" It was insulting that to compensate for all of the service hiccups and raw steak, that we got a $10 dessert. \\n\\nBased on our past experiences and a $200 bill, we expected more.  My FI emailed the GM, Peter, when we got home that night, but so far no response has been received.\\n\\n*UPDATE 3/10-The GM, Peter, emailed back.  His email was long, rambling and filled with grammatical errors.  Embarassing that he clearly did not care to articulate a response.

Gunshow can easily go off the rails. They are, after all, running quite the balancing act. But let me start from the beginning.\\n\\nBeyond the fact that all the beardy guys in the open kitchen makes it look like a Mumford & Sons concert, we're actually talking about white people dim sum. That's the hook--some might even say, gimmick. It feels fresh and new to some; annoys the crap out of others. I mean, the courses come when they come and you must be ready to jump on them (even if you don't FEEL ready.) Some may appreciate the individualized attention, since each chef is presenting their work directly to you; others may feel put upon (or even an implicit pressure) that they have to accept each dish placed in front of them. (\\"I felt bad saying no to the guy!\\" a friend of mine once told me.) It's all a bit discombobulating.\\n\\nEh, people need to suck it up and taste the food.\\n\\nAll right, let me help you understand where I'm coming from. I've been to a million dim sum joints, about a billion churrascarias (or should I say \\"a Brazilian\\"), so I'm down with the idiosyncratic meal presentation. When a chef presents his work, his soulful eyes that of a Dickensian waif pleading for another bowl of gruel, asks if you would like to partake of his food, glorious food, I got no problem saying \\"no\\" if I don't feel it. That's part of the game. I know it and THEY know it. Don't feel bad. It's not like you looked at it and said, \\"No, that looks like crap. I've seen Joe Rogan serve up better plates of food on 'Fear Factor',\\" but if you did say that, then yes, you should feel bad, you dick. But if you're not feeling it, say \\"No thanks\\" and another plate will come along soon. That said, if you do change your mind after the fact, you are kind of SOL since it may be an hour before you see are particular dish (which seemed to be the second biggest complaint among friends who've been here.) So, as that old knight said in the 3rd Indiana Jones movie, \\"Choose wisely.\\"\\n\\nFortunately for me and my wife, we chose pretty damn well. In fact, our night showed the full promise of Gunshow's promise. Dishes turned over quickly, but not TOO quickly. Service was fun and engaging. And the food!

I took a \\"sammy\\" to go. \\n\\nYes, the porchetta was over $10.00 for a small sandwich and $1 tip to the nice counter girl. I asked to have lettuce added; No problem. When I brought it home, I added tomato, although I'm sure they would have added it, too. \\n\\n***Note***- I don't understand why places won't add veggies to a sandwich nowadays. I mean, if they don't offer salads, aren't we supposed to have veggies with all of our meals? To me, it doesn't take away from the meat; it enhances it. I found myself longing for some peppers or apples on this particular one, too, but it certainly didn't need any cheese. \\n\\nPeppers were offered on others, but not this one, but I was pretty sure that I had chosen the best one. I could see the \\"mom\\" behind the counter slicing the pig, and it looked absolutely divine! \\n\\nI was extremely happy with my order, and could barely wait until I got home to try it. It was packaged in neatly folded brown paper with a fancy little sticker sporting their brand; perhaps that's why the sandwiches cost so much? :) \\n\\nThe porchetta was pretty succulent, after all, and in contrast to M & B it wasn't too greasy; nor did it drip which can be annoying and ruin nice clothes. It is also embarrassing to drip in public, if you know what I mean.  (And I loved M & B). As others suggested, the cubes were a win, and most stayed within the sandwich while eating, even with my own addition of two slices of tomato. \\n\\nWhile the sandwich wasn't huge, it was certainly big enough for me, even if I could have probably eaten more. I am not sure just who could stop eating that crackly pork, so that was probably a good thing. I didn't get any potatoes or anything with mine, but I didn't need them. It seems to me that the little extras would have made it a deal. \\n\\nIt really seems to be standard pricing for a sandwich, anyway, so I'm not sure about the complaints here?

We had here some of the better fish in town. The only problem is, the quality is not always consistent. Sometimes the fish is incredible, sometimes just so-so / kind of tasteless. It is always edible (we haven't had \\"BAD\\" fish) but I haven't been able to determine on what day they get their new supplies... Will keep you posted if we figure it out. Oh, and I feel their appetizers are kind of overpriced for the quantity, so I recommend to cut to the chase, and get down to business ASAP (order them cut-rolls or nigiris). When they tell you \\"we have fresh Uni tonight\\" it does not necessarily mean that the Uni is fresh. We tried such a \\"fresh\\" uni, it was kind of 3-4 days in the refrigerator type of fresh. Not spoiled yet, not slimy yet- but tasted a bit like \\"chemical cocktail\\" haha. If you know Uni, you will know what I mean... Out of their nigiri menu, we like most their yellowtail, salmon, flounder, squid and scallops.\\n\\nSERVICE: 3 stars, up & down, varies every time we go there (from 1 to 4 stars)... yup, inconsistent. The Korean lady at the front, who helps you to the table, is gorgeous like a model, one of the prettier Asian women I've seen here in Austin (kind of rare... but please, don't flirt with her too much, I think she is married, you don't wanna have a pissed of Korean Taekwon-Do master kick your ass... hahaha). Once you get seated, they will try hard to be good but then sometimes they forget you. Only the Mexican dude who refills relentlessly the water will come by often to make sure it's well topped off. Don't drink too fast, you may drown before getting your order processed. Anyway, really depends on the person, usually a college student from UTA or the ACC. Sometimes the wait-er/ress does not even know how to properly pronounce the Japanese name of the food... Soo-shey? Mah-guru? Yall, we got some fresh Eye-koo'ruh tonite! Cus it's almost never an Asian person- and you know how it feels to be served Japanese food by a Caucasian person who never stepped foot outside of the great state of Texas. So just be prepared, set your service expectations lower, so you can be happy. That is what I do. Some don'ts: don't go there if you're too hungry cus you may, or may not, wait for quite some time to get your food. Don't order their hot sake cus they may, or may not, bring it when it's already lukewarm (or even cold, yes, we did have such an evening). :) you get my point.\\n\\nAMBIENCE: 4 stars, a modern well-decorated place- arguably a good dating spot (especially if your date is not a Japanese girl), and plenty of available seating. We feel Kenobi is one of the good restaurants for an Austin level good sushi experience. As I said it has a loungy feel & they play some electronica & ambient tunes. Lighting is dim but not too dark so you can still see your beautiful (hopefully) date. It's not too loud so you can still have a conversation. It's tastefully designed inside- they clearly spent some money on the interior design. I felt it's perhaps a bit large for the amount of clientele they are getting in a city like Austin, especially on weekdays. But maybe it's only because of the recession?\\n\\nTOTAL: umm, with mixed feelings, it is very hard to say. Sometimes I swear that I will never go to Kenobi again, yet after a month or so, I guess I forget, and I return back... When the experience is good, I do feel the urge to go more often, but then the next time, they kill my desire and the above process starts over.\\n\\nFeel free to ask me questions- I always respond... :)"},{"name":"4th & Swift","address":"621 N Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"My wife and I went for our first anniversary dinner here.

Many other times, I have gotten General Tso's that is made up mostly of the breading. If I had to put a percentage to the times I've gotten terrible General Tso's from here it would be 95% of the time.

The shredded chicken was a nice contrast to the ample amount of tender meat, and the lumaconi, large pasta shells, shaped like a snail's shell and the size of a  small ball (don't worry, I had to google what this was too), was perfectly cooked.  The lumaconi was not too soft, but not too hard at the same time; an impeccable model of al dente pasta.  The sauce was flavourful, and really added to the overall delight of my dish.\\n\\nThat being said, the other dishes, the tagliatelle and an eggplant pasta (another special), that my friends had were sub par.  The dishes were bland and plain, and could've used more of the sauce that they were said to come with.  This totally did not meet the expectations that were set by the high price of these two dishes.  The sangria that we ordered along with our main courses was very watered down, and the pitcher was filled with more ice than the drink itself.\\n\\nThe service was very slow.

First off, we visited Victoria Station in November, a rather chilly time in MA. The restaurant was colder INSIDE than it was outside. It really did feel like they had the AC on full blast and many of us ate with our coats and scarves still on. We did ask the server a few times if the there was anything that could be done as we were uncomfortable, but it stayed pretty cold the entire time. Note to Victoria: don't freeze your costumers!\\n\\nAs for the food...ehhh. There were lots of us so there were lots of items on the tables:\\n\\n** One of my coworkers that used to live walking distance to Victoria Station kept raving that they had a good salad bar. Ok, either I have uppity taste or he's wickedy wack! That salad bar was a MISS! Plain iceberg lettuce, boring tomato slides, some shredded carrots, chopped hard boiled eggs, raisins, maybe some red beans, and some beets that looked like they came out of a dented can. Just because you put out 5 or 6 different salad dressings, doesn't make your salad bar \\"fresh and creative\\" and described in the menu. Big let down. \\n\\n** Started with a few orders of the Nachos appetizer. About as good as the ones you get from a major league baseball game. It was a rather large serving so good for a group to share.\\n\\n** Bread was ok. Not warm and the butter was cold and almost impossible to spread.\\n\\n** A few people ordered the onion soup (cuz it was so damn cold!) and said it was tasty. Me, being the onion-hater that I am wouldn't dare try it. By default, I would have said it was disgusting!\\n\\n** Lobster Mac 'n Cheese: I feel like this dish is getting so played out now. Tasted like not-fresh lobster poured over some Kraft Shells and Cheese then put in an Easy Bake Oven for a few minutes.. Wasn't gross, but it wasn't great either. \\n\\n** Bacon-wrapped Scallops: Not too bad. Nice presentation and came with some sort of aioli/1000 Island Dressing-looking kind of sauce. Bacon makes just about anything good.\\n\\n** Grilled Chicken Sandwich: Blehh. Unseasoned chicken on out-the-bag sliced wheat bread. No sauce, no dressing, no flavor, no bueno! Even the grilled mushrooms didn't help that poor sandwich. The only thing that was good on my plate was the sweet potato fries.\\n\\nService was good and I always commend a wait staff that can handle a large group. I'd maybe recommend this place for a game day when beers will overpower the bad food, or for a senior retirement luncheon, or if you're visiting from Antarctica and want to warm place to eat.\\n\\nNot terrible.

Went here for breakfast during our trip to Atlanta, and we felt very welcomed. We sat outside which was a little warm, but the food and service was outstanding. We had the special corned beef hash and steel cut oatmeal with dried fruit. Mmmmm, both were SO good. Corned beef hash had the perfect runny egg. Definitely LGBT friendly which is great!"},{"name":"Wok N' Roll","address":"1908 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"This rating is for their delivery food....Seaweed salad was not fresh.

So score one for false advertising!  Also, the service was pretty poor.  But if you want to be dazzled by dozens of large LCD TVs, then Brighton Beer Garden may be for you.

But I was not overly impressed."},{"name":"Grand Central Baking Company","address":"1444 NE Weidler","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I have come to the conclusion that GRand Central is not what it used to be.  My last couple of visits have been underwhelming.  Today I went in and got a chocolate croissant and an americano.  The croissant was chewy and did not flake the way I would expect and the americano was thin and watery.  It was as though there was not enough espresso in the cup.\\nIn the future I will walk the block to Peet's.\\nI do still recommend their breads."},{"name":"Las Margaritas Latin Resturant Tequila & Rum Sports Bar","address":"1842 Chesire Bridge Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Nice atmosphere and service. Only a little pricy but not for Buckhead."},{"name":"Salts Restaurant","address":"798 Main St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4.5","text":"One of the first questions we got asked by the waitstaff here when they found out we were visitors was \\"How did you find us?\\" and the answer (as always) was \\"Yelp!' (duh).  \\n\\nThere are plenty of things I could have nitpicked here.  I could complain about how the rolls were not as soft and pliant as they should have been.  I could complain about something stupid like how the butter was not housemade or locally sourced.  But I won't because like I said... that's stupid. \\n\\nBesides, everything else elevated this restaurant to epic 5-star proportions.  The service was impeccable, including the house manager staying on the phone with my ride until they were safely parked in Salts' parking lot.  They made excellent recommendations for wine and brought out two different kinds for us to try.  The recommendations for food was delicious, although I would have LOVED to try the tasting menu.  For $75, they create a menu specifically tailored to your likes and dislikes, food allergies, etc.  One day... \\n\\nMy mom and I started off with the escaveche of striped bass which was delicately flavored, impossibly fresh, and beautifully decorated.  She can't stop talking about how it was the best fresh fish she's ever had.  Then we got the duck for two, which was... FABULOUS.  We both love duck, and it was roasted to a crisp perfection, stuffed with apples and stuffing and mushrooms, with this amazing roasted pear and a delicious sauce of some kind or another.  Man, I can't wait for the leftovers!\\n\\nThis is a GREAT place for a special occasion.  The ambiance is quite and softly lit, the service impeccable, and the food was fabulous.  Highly recommended."},{"name":"Redd's in Rozzie","address":"4257 Washington St","city":"Roslindale","stars":"4","text":"I feel like it's over hyped.

I was a little disappointed because the food was average and I was expecting it to be really good! It wasn't bad but the portions are huge so you get your money's worth. I decided to give an extra star for that and also the restaurant provides complimentary valet parking. \\n\\nAnyways, I'm generally not picky with the food but the service here also made me upset a little. I think the server may have been recently hired or the place was a little understaffed. The food took awhile to arrive, our server repetitively kept giving us the wrong food because he got tables mixed up. I guess I just came to try the place out at the wrong time but this place didn't interest me enough to come again."},{"name":"Mooo Restaurant","address":"15 Beacon St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"It's been a while since I last left a review and luckily its a positive experience that has brought me back!  Unfortunately I was especially inclined to write a review because as I browsed the current ratings people have left, I find that once again Yelp! Is a horrible way for restaurants to be critiqued.  Good reviews are filtered and removed while slander is left behind, honestly leaving me to believe yelp! Is rigged and a horrible misrepresentation of the real truth.  \\n\\nMany people have given very harsh and negative reviews based solely on two things, \\"overpriced\\" and \\"slow service\\".  Well if you know what fine dining is and what high end steak houses offer then immediately toss out those complaints because Mooo is in no way \\"slow\\" or \\"over priced\\".  Their quality and style is above the status quo for steakhouses in Boston and their pricing is practically the same. \\n\\n When you enter an upper echelon of restaurants you must know what to expect and most people really just rated it as if this place should be like Outback or something.  A finely crafted dry aged perfectly cooked bone in delmonico here costs 46$ give or take, while Grill 23 , And Capital Grill offer something similar for 40-50$ as well, yet I don't see a shred of outcry for being over priced from their reviews.  Drinks are also appropriately priced ranging from 8-15$ for cocktails and the wine selection is exceptionally impressive.\\n\\nSo aside from the gross injustice that Yelp! Provides lets get down to the actual meal.\\n\\nAppetizers - shellfish sampler was clean delicious and offers just the right amount of variety to leave you satisfied but not too full for your steak.  The bone marrow was also good however I didn't like the bed of salt that it was on, made for nice presentation but it can actually interfere with the flavors quite easily.  Their lobster bisque was second to none surprisingly, very tender lobster meat and the bisque wasn't too thick like chowder with just the right amount of sherry.\\n\\nSteaks-  I had the bone in delmonico which is probably in the top 3 best steaks I've ever had, medium rare of course, the wife had a ribeye and my sister had a peppercorn sirloin, all of which were amazing as well.  What gives Mooo... The extra edge is the fact that they also provide chived butter in a bone to baste your steak with, complimenting the juicy flavors and crisp chars. \\n\\nSides-  One of the only steakhouses and fine dining restaurants that let's you do a side sampler rather than ordering a bunch of huge portioned sides that no one can even finish, get the small sized side flight because you can't go wrong.\\n\\nDessert -  I'm not going to lie I usually hate sweets but the creme br√ªl√©e here was the best I've had at any restaurant.  The bananas foster was my 2nd favorite dessert and I would recommend passing on the stout cake.  Lemon meringue pie was the surprise in this category, I was expecting something tart and over powering but it was perfectly balanced and only had a delicate essence to top off the pie.\\n\\nAmbiance - As with all restaurants of this nature the lighting will be dim and the decor will be modern however they get points for a controlled environment, anyone who has had grill 23 or Oceanaire knows the loud and hectic dining hall vibes they provide.\\n\\nService - Another reason why Yelp! Fails miserably is because of the majority of patrons that use it.  Stuck up people who feel that people, real people like themselves are paying for servants/slaves rather than servers.  There's a very big difference but I guess everyone wants to be pampered out there, bunch of MASSholes if you ask me.  Well to their credit, because of those douche bags Mooo... Has exceptional service  as well, our server David F.  was very knowledgeable, polite, and checked in on us plenty of times without hovering.  The hostess or ma√Ætre de literally tried to put our jackets on for us (I declined but this probably happened because some other schmucks had complained about her not doing so). But yes the service was that attentive.  Also I forgot to mention, valet parking was free (but its still advised you tip generously).\\n\\nOverall it's 5/5 stars any day of the week and twice on Sundays.  Anyone who tells you otherwise either has a huge misunderstanding of what these restaurants are supposed to offer or just had that one bad experience with that one bad employee  on that one bad night because yeah, it happens."},{"name":"Flying Biscuit Caf√© - Midtown","address":"1001 Piedmont Ave","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Take this with a grain of salt because I don't live in Atlanta and I've only been here once. But the shrimp and grits are incredible here. Definitely the best I've ever had.

That's good service in my book."},{"name":"The Melting Pot","address":"754 Peachtree St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"I went to the Midtown Melting Pot last night for restaurant week. The staff was nice and the food was not bad. My one complaint is the amount of salt used in the batter for the frying of the meats - in addition, to the salt used in the vegetable broth for the cheese based fondue. I walked out there with swollen ankles and I am in my mid 30s and very healthy. I do not know why the batter (especially) is so salty but word to the wise about the salt levels in their food. It has been over 12 hours and I am still feeling the effects of it. CAREFUL!"},{"name":"Victoria's Station & Vic's Boathouse","address":"86 Wharf St","city":"Salem","stars":"3","text":"Poor quality of food and mediocre service. My two friends and I took our girlfriends out to dinner Saturday October 10th before going out for the night in Salem in hopes of a good time. First mistake, the waitress gave my girl friend the wrong entree \\"not even close\\" so she either wrote it down wrong or took the wrong food from the kitchen. Mistake two, all the food was cold, we sent a couple entrees back and all of the fries and sides. I was surprised how cold the food was because it came out rather quick which tells me that they gave us fries and sides that were just sitting there and were not freshly made. Mistake three, one of my friends ordered   red meat and requested it be made \\"medium\\" and it was so undercooked it was extremely red and hard to cut. Fourth mistake, after all the complaints we made, we were not apologized to by any of the staff and or compensated by any means and were just given the check. For a great location I would have expected more from this place, however I was very wrong and appalled at the quality of service and food, can't believe I spent money here."},{"name":"Cabo Bob's Burritos","address":"2828 Rio Grande St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"The verdict is in: Cabo Bob's beats  Chipotle.

So good and they pack so much food into their burritos! Their chips and guacamole are great too; the chips are slightly thicker than most normal chips which is something I liked. Prices are good for what you get and I would definitely come back. \\n\\nAlso the staff is so friendly too! Always good to see staff who work so hard and are still able to interact with customers and smile.

What a huge disappoint!!! \\n\\nWe walked into a half empty restaurant and stood around for about 5 minutes before any waiter even makes eye contact to seat us.  Minus 1 star for lack of service.\\n\\nHere is what we ordered based on the raving, popular suggestions according to Yelpers:\\n\\nButter Beef\\nEssentially supposed to be Vietnamese bo tai chan (beef carpaccio) but really a Chinese chef's take.  I don't even understand why there's even \\"butter\\" in the name.  Anyhow, thinly sliced beef with a soy based ponzu sauce. This was average but the best dish of the three we ordered.\\n\\nHu tieu\\nWe ordered this since the sign on their door exclaimed it was their special.  We repeatedly said to the waiter \\"hu tieu\\" and he just had a blank look on his face and had no clue what we were saying.  I have no problems with non-Vietnamese people/chefs running a Viet restaurant but at least know your own menu.  Hu tieu turned out bland with very little flavors. Might as well eat your noodles in plain hot water. \\n\\nFried chicken wings\\nSOOO overrated!!! The chicken itself has no salt or any seasoning and the batter is equally flavorless. It definitely didn't excite my taste buds one bit.\\n\\nOur group of four diners are all Vietnamese so we know what Vietnamese is supposed to taste like.  And even if the food is only Vietnamese inspired, it doesn't even taste that great.
