I'd take any burger challenge. And yet, when James Brown was plopped in front of me, I think my heart almost stopped just by looking at it. Don't worry, it didn't, and a stuffed stomach later, I conquered that messy beast. \\n\\nJames Brown was an interesting combo. He was stuffed with (bland) pulled pork and a little bit of cheddar. He was overwhelmingly topped with dill relish and BBQ sauce, among other things. The bread was surprisingly one of my favorite parts of the burger other than the tasty beef, but with the drenching from the toppings, it began falling apart mid-meal, which made the very messy burger even more of a hassle to eat. Your Mom's burgers are definitely unique, but I found the most important part - the meat - bland. One plus, the fries are heavily seasoned and pretty good.\\n\\nMost of their seating is outside where it looked like there were screen windows and only a fan circulating the air. Good thing I came during one of Austin's cool days because a covered patio in the summer is unforgiving. I loved the bright aqua walls and decor, the tree on the patio that they built around and how they name their burgers after famous people, but if I came again, I'll probably order a burger less overwhelmed by originality.\\n\\nLast tip: You don't want to come here if you don't want to scare your first date with sauce all over your hands and face, if you're on a diet or if you have to run a 10k the next day."},{"name":"Tom, Dick & Hank","address":"191 Ralph David Abernathy Blvd SW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Fantastic!!!

I could blame it on increased age or decreased activity, and while I'm sure those things have their place, the reality is that at dinner time I end up at places like Your Mom's, where one burger can effectively nullify an entire day's worth of healthy eating, like it never even happened.

It's the avocado that puts it over the top, I think--avocado on a greasy, chorizo-laden burger provides the perfect touch of cool creaminess that this concoction begs for.  Even the buns are good, and the fries, as long as they're fresh, are some of the best I've had in town.\\n\\nTo my poultrytarian friend's disappointment (I have no idea what you call a person who only eats poultry and plants), they were out of their veggie burger--but they offered to make her a grilled cheese with tomato and avocado, which she said was delicious.

The souffle was cheesy and soft but we felt it was more suited to be spread onto bread/crackers than served on its own. For the mains, we had their special Wagyu short rib ravioli, the black truffle fettuccine and also their gnocchi. Our favorite was definitely the truffle fettuccine as it was cooked in a simple olive oil base, noodles were perfect and the truffles were delicious. The server shaved the truffles at the table which was neat to see. The ravioli was in a light cream sauce and was very delicious. The gnocchi came in a tomato sauce and has good flavour.

I'd give none of it were possible. \\n\\nMy husband had been there once, and said the food was good, but that it was super crowded during the weekday lunch rush. We were in the area on a Saturday (the 3rd of December) to get groceries nearby at Trader Joes, and realized we hadn't had lunch yet, and didn't want to shop on empty stomachs. This place looked relatively quiet when we cruised by, and the hubs said it was a good burger -- so we ducked in. Having never been there, I let my husband order first. A cheeseburger (all the trimmings), a regular fry, and a drink. When it was my turn, since I still didn't know anything about the place,  my exact words were \\"I'll have the exact same as him\\". Not that hard, right? \\n\\nShocker number one was that 2 burgers, 2 fries, and 2 drinks cost over $30. WHAT? If I'm paying that damn much for a simple burger, i want table service. I could go to Chile's or Applebees for a burger,  and have somebody wait on me in a better environment for the same amount of money.\\n\\nShocker number two was that we waited OVER 20 MINS for our number to be called out. See above regarding table service -- that's a restaurant level wait time. Not fast food, where I serve myself. \\n\\nShocker number three was that saying \\"I'll have the exact same as him\\" IS APPARENTLY too complicated. I needed to hold the poor kid's hand and spell out step-by-step what I wanted -- because my husband's burger came out with all the trimmings, and mine was completely plain. Bread. Meat. Cheese. We waited 20 mins for THAT?!\\n\\nI went up to the front, and was completely pleasant at this point still, and set my burger down and explained that I had asked for it all-the-way with the toppings,  could they please fix it. This crabby older lady looked like I was annoying her, and treated me like it was my fault for ordering it wrong, or something  (again... don't know how much simpler I could've been). She told me she could give me all the toppings and I could make it myself, or she could have them make me a new burger, but she couldn't take the burger back behind the counter and add the toppings because of health code (which I totally get).\\n\\nIf they were rapid at making the burgers, I would've gone that route. I did not want to add the toppings myself because the bread was already ripping in half from sticking to the cheese when i tried to open it to look for toppings. To put the toppings on the same burger would've been a disgusting mess. BUT ALAS, I also did not want to wait TWENTY more minutes for a new burger. \\n\\nSo, to summarize: I waited forever to eat an extremely overpriced, falling apart, plain burger, that was not what I ordered... and enteracted with some teenager who couldn't take the simplest of requests, and an old lady who was crabby and rude. \\n\\nI could go to Mighty Fine for WAY BETTER service and atmosphere.... and a freaking drive-through Whopper from BK would taste better than what I ended up with."},{"name":"Carmelina's","address":"307 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"I've been to Damiano's three times and I've loved everything I've tried there.

While delicious and uniquely presented, this isn't a restaurant, nor does it want to be. Go there for the experience, and you'll enjoy an excellent meal along the way.\\n\\nPeople arguing about the food's authenticity, or the atmosphere, or even the service (when comparing to a restaurant) are missing the point. Tanuki is a bar; according to the owner a \\"Japanese punk bar,\\" and they like it that way. This is the sort of place where you go to have a good time, drink some interesting (and hard to find) sake, talk loudly, watch lewd television, laugh with friends, make new friends...and enjoy life. That it happens to have incredibly good, inexpensive food and a witty, engaging, masterful chef/owner/operator and staff to match is a bonus, albeit a very enticing one.\\n\\nMy girlfriend and I stopped in here based on reading the reviews regarding the quality of Tanuki's food in the midst of a California-to-Seattle drive. We ended up staying for more than three hours, getting to know the owner and staff, and being sent on our way with a number of provisions for the road to go along with our full bellies, great memories, and a feeling like we had just been invited into, for a short while, an intimate little hideaway from the clamour of the world around us.\\n\\nI will say a bit about the food - it is excellent. We ordered the omakase and had a number of Japanese and Korean dishes, including some excellent, uniquely-flavored edamame and the best hamachi sashimi I have ever tasted. The chef has apparently made a few nods toward the critics, offering us both the milder Japanese kimchee that Americans are used to and the more fermented, sour Korean kimchee (which was better by far than the former), but they are few and far between, and what we found was better, if possible, than what we expected based on the glowing reviews here.\\n\\nIn short, this is the sort of experience that is enhanced greatly if one walks in with an open mind and a willingness to learn about, and get to know, people. If you are a restaurant-goer who seeks to find the next gem to receive a Michelin star and is wholly focused on the food and service, you will likely not enjoy Tanuki as much as you could...and they don't mind this. \\n\\nMy only regret has been that we did not have the opportunity to revisit Tanuki on our way back through Portland...and we live too far away to go back anytime soon. We will definitely go again if we find ourselves in Portland, and only wish that something even remotely like it existed around here.\\n\\nTry it - you won't regret it."},{"name":"Salty Sow","address":"1917 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I am leaving more than satisfied.

Interestingly enough, the restaurant has been in our backyard for years, but we had not heard too much about it. Now we know why... we arrived for happy hour a little before 6:00 and were told we could take a seat on the porch and so we did. Sitting patiently as waiters, waitresses and managers continued to stroll past us waiting on other patrons while ignoring us for more than 20 plus minutes. We stopped one of the waitresses to request service and she informed us that she would have to check with the host to see who was suppose to be waiting on us. She ended up waiting on us and was very attentive, the food was good, yet the delivery and service was a huge debacle! We requested to speak with a manager so as to address the problem directly. After an already terrible experience, we moved inside because it began to rain. There were several empty high-tops seating four people and one extended table seating 10 patrons, but the extended table was still covered in dirty dishes. We decided to move two high-tops together and preceded to sit down when at that point the host came to us and said it was company policy not to move the high-tops together. So once again we asked to speak with the manager who came over and told us we could not remain seated at the high-tops, but he could accommodate us at the dirty table that sat 10. At that point we should have walked out of the restaurant, but relocated over to the other table where once again we placed our drink orders and additional food items for those who were just joining us.  AGAIN, we waited and waited and noticed the host looking over at us and motioned to speak with him. He didn't care to address our concerns stating he was just the host and so we requested that he send the manager back over. The manager came back over and asked us what we would like him to do... we were taken aback at this point.

The menu sounded promising, but the food we had made both of us worry about food poisoning.  The three-cheese mac and cheese was cold when it came out (and the noodles were quite over-cooked), and the pulled pork sandwiches tasted like the pork had been taken out of the freezer after suffering freezer burn only to be microwave-heated.  It tasted like bad pork, enough so that we did not take more than two bites each.  The bacon-wrapped figs were less alarming, but they were over-fried....probably because they had been fried earlier that day (or week) and been thrown back in the deep fryer to heat up when we ordered them.  It took 15 minutes for the waitress to come around (and they were *not* busy but well-staffed for the night crowd), and then we also had to ask for our silverware after food had been brought out.

Overall fantastic experience.  Service was excellent - our servers were polite, friendly, and with the right level of attentiveness for our family with 2 kids.  We're all pasta lovers, and our daughter is a \\"certified\\" butter pasta critic ;-).  My son chose \\"build your own\\" shrimp with Alfredo sauce.  Shrimp was cooked perfectly - not over done, and the Alfredo sauce was one of the best I've tasted - sweet and buttery, and not too heavy tasting.  My carbonara was also fantastic - the star was the salty, crispy bacon.  Note - traditional preparation, so very eggy and meaty flavor.  If that's what you like - this is a must try!  For dessert, we tried the trifle - tiramisu and Oreo.  Didn't get a picture because we inhaled them both!  Lastly, Chris, the owner, is just what you want.  He takes pride in both food quality and providing an awesome customer dining experience.

First, the beef is consistently superior at Hy's.  When you are amongst classy women, each one is beautiful.  Hy's has  women as customers who own multi-million dollar companies, and approve their employee's expense accounts. Back to the beef-my recent visit to celebrate a special anniversary was better than ever. We opted for lunch and booked through Open Table. The server was attentive and professional-potatoes O'Brien came with the entree, and were delish -lots of fresh peppers snuggled in those spuds. Perfectly finished. My pepper steak - tasty, with the fragrance of whole black pepper floating up to my nose - bare those fangs, folks, and devour prime beef, aged and cooked to your specification. In the past we have chomped our way through the cheese toast, you have got to try it at least once, but now that we know the creme brulee is the best -we save room for that explosion of creamy wonder, along with the coffee. Hy's has a \\"real\\" bartender-so order any cocktail-I had a Pink Lady-modern mixes don't compare to hand-blending of spirits that make this pink fluff so potent. You can't go wrong with Hy's-order any of the chunks of beef and you will definitely return for a dining experience that combines beauty and elegance with the joy of eating. Really exceptional spirits available at the bar-a vast selection of smoky scotches.

It didn't help that one of our glasses had remaining lipstick from the previous guest! The waiter reappeared to take our food order. I ordered the baked Brie appetizer  and a spinach salad with chicken as my main. Before my companion could place his order, the waiter turned to leave??!! We had to chase him down so my companion could order a main course (chicken flatbread)! When the baked Brie arrived and it was a pasty color (not baked golden brown). And when we cut into it, the BAKED Brie was cold in the middle!? However, we persevered by peeling the anemic pastry off and eating the cold cheese. When the mains arrived, we were completely underwhelmed! The spinach salad looked like it was thrown on the plate and topped with a strangely orange chicken slices, accompanied with a plastic cup of non descript vinaigrette. The flatbread was equally disappointing. Our second round of \\"French 75's\\" included another pre-lipsticked glass.

It should also be noted that the other benedict that came out had poached eggs that looked pretty good. As people who NEVER send back food, it was a tough call. But after we asked the waitress to take a look at it she agreed that it did not look right. It was so unappetizing that he almost didn't order another dish. But he went with the chicken and waffles which came out pretty quickly. The egg over medium on the side still looked terrible - like they were over-cooked in burned butter (blackish/brown on the outside).

I don't eat rice so every time I try to order it without the rice, they waiter tells me that I can't because it will mess up the presentation. I so don't care about the presentation. I have to tell them that I am allergic to rice in order for them to 'ruin' their presentation of a plate of rice with a piece of chicken on top of it. The ambiance in there isn't all of that so why are they are messed up about a rice presentation. Anyway, they have the best uptown (lemonade and tea). The price is fabulous, food is served really quickly, friendly staff, and the service is normally nice. The wait is usually long, but I am willing to wait on my fried or smothered chicken.  The breakfast is pretty good, but I can't give details since I've only had breakfast after I leave the club and been drinking so I don't remember much about it. I will take away 1 star for giving me a hard time about some rice, for the long wait, oh yes, for the hit and miss sides."},{"name":"Beau Jo's - Boulder","address":"2690 Baseline Rd","city":"Boulder","stars":"3.5","text":"I just ordered a bbq pizza and it was delivered via hungry buffs.

Outfitting the West with Lebanese, the folks at Al Wadi.\\n\\nFrom the father-son duo behind South End stalwart Nicole's Pizza, Al Wadi's the manifestation of their family dream to open an upscale Leb joint, and's located in the completely overhauled former Spring Blossom space, now elegantly outfitted with plush brown suede & leather banquettes, marble pillars, a 12-seat mirrored bar, and imported Egyptian chandeliers sporting jewels dangling from golden crowns of hammered metal (apparently Ozzy can still hang). Meaty Mid-East delectables include spiced lamb tartare w/ onions and parsley; Kibbeh Beseneyah, baked ground beef stuffed with minced beef/pine nuts & yogurt-cucumber sauce; and a mint-sprinkled grilled steak served over bulgur -- far healthier than Bulger, which'll murder your arteries. With guns. There're also exotic large-portion plates like a tahini sauce'd sea bass & mixed nut tajine, turnovers stuffed with spinach/lemon/sumac, olive oil sauteed gourmet sausages, and chicken wings dressed in garlic and cilantro known as Jawaneh, which explains why it doesn't come with breasts.\\n\\nTo satiate your sweet tooth, they're baking traditional pastries, from pancakes stuffed w/ sweet cheese, to cream layered, rose water syrup'd shredded dough, also what parents suspect they did if you went to Latin and ended up at Not Harvard.\\"\\n\\n                  __________________________________________\\n\\nOk, I came here with my \\"hottie\\" friend.

I thought HECK, let's try this place and so we did. \\n\\nMy colleague warned me about bringing a flashlight because it's quite dark at Hy's. There were certain corners that were lightly dimmed and we were seated near the back near the grill. This area was a bit brighter compared to other areas in the restaurant. And I did see many waiters and waitresses with flashlights just so if customers have a hard time reading the menu...\\n\\nWe ordered the Cheese Toast for Two. I heard that when it arrives, you had to take the foil off so the toast doesn't get soggy. When it arrived, I saw how much cheese there was and thought to myself \\"I wonder how many calories this toast contains...\\" but still, I ate it anyway. It was deliciously mouth-watering piece of toast...it just melted in my mouth. I only ate two as I felt like I was starting to get full. I needed to save room for my entree and salad.\\n\\nWe also ordered the caesar salad which Hy's staff performed in front of us. I really enjoyed the salad even though the dressing was mixed in with the salad. Normally, I like to have dressing on the side because sometimes restaurants put loads and loads of dressing which isn't the healthiest and this could prevent you from tasting the natural flavors of your salad (you don't want to be eating dressing only). The caesar salad was made fresh; the romaine lettuce was crispy and crunchy. The croutons were light and crunchy...it wasn't stale or crunchy hard. It was garlicky and just superb.\\n\\nThe bf ordered the Cajun Rib Steak (panfried with Hy's cajun seasoning) while I had the Filet A La Hy's (medallions of beef tenderloin saut√©ed with wild mushroom sauce). The bf's steak was flavorful and juicy but it was a little oily and fatty for me while the beef tenderloin that I had was quite pleasing. When we finished eating, the server surprised the bf with a bourbon chocolate cake (which I had been informed was the least sweet cakes compared to other options). It was tooth-sweet to my liking. This didn't tickle my taste buds. But hey, I can't complain as they placed this dessert on the house. \\n\\nOverall, I enjoyed the experience and see myself coming to this restaurant again."},{"name":"Oyatsupan Bakers","address":"16025 SW Regatta Ln","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4.5","text":"A really very awesome place !!

So, I decided to opt for the chicken picatta.  i was seriously disappointed--from the start. My salad was wilted. The cucumbers seemed old. The dressing was bottled (expected). The croutons were not home made. (expected).  The chicken picatta was so bland. There was no lemon flavor and no garlic flavor.  I actually had to salt my meal. Anyone who knows me knows I rarely salt my food, beyond how it is presented to me. The linguine was over cooked and rather mushy. The Patriot's play off game was going on at the time of our dinner, so I am guessing the chef was preoccupied. The rolls were lousy. The portion was huge, but I didn't want much of it the first time around, so I wasn't thrilled about having it a second time. it wasn't expensive... my meal cost $11.99.  I did bring it home because I didn't want my friends to think I hated my meal. My son took my leftovers and doctored them up before he ate them. He added fresh parmesan, ground black pepper and garlic powder. He also cut the chicken up into smaller pieces. I found the pieces way too large and unseasoned. I wont be rushing back to Conrad's.

I had high hopes but was not impressed in so many areas.  The waitress was nice but the service overall was not impressive. My friend had a drink spilled on her and at that point wouldn't they be very apologetic and perhaps give a free drink? That did not happen and I thought that was odd but could look beyond that since it was just a mistake.  What was even worse was that I waited 25 minutes for a 2nd drink.  Yup, I timed it!  I've never waited that long for a drink in a restaurant and I just have no idea what they were doing. Was there only 1 bartender and he/she was on break? Either way there was a clear delay of getting drinks. Also, we had to ask for water repeatedly when most, if not all restaurants, would automatically refill the water.  \\n\\nWe tried the fried calamari, mussels and pizza for appetizers.  The fried calamari was ok but a bit soggy.  The mussels were horrible.  They tasted like they were frozen and/or several days old. They were definitely not fresh and were the worst mussels I've ever had.  The pizza was ok, but the sauce was disappointing.  If the sauce was better I probably would have rated the pizza above average.   \\n\\nFor the main course I had the duck and it wasn't bad but it was boring.

This place is seriously overrated. I tried a bunch of stuff because I had two groupons. Here is a review for each item:\\n\\n1. prosciutto panini- They microwaved it before they toasted it! Apparently, it was a pre-made refrigerated sandwich and toasting it would only heat the outside of the sandwich. So, they microwaved the entire sandwich. I HATE microwaved bread. If you've never tried it, it becomes ridiculously rubbery after being in the microwave. They also left in too long so the prosciutto turned into bacon. I've never had a worse panini.\\n2. Hummus wrap: It had so little hummus that my wife added mustard to the wrap for flavor.\\n3. Spinach pastry: Not at as advertised. Greek pastries are supposed to have thin and crispy exterior, like phyllo dough. This had a weird southern biscuit exterior, thick, buttery and fluffy. We threw away about 75% of it.\\n4. Two pieces of baklava: It was soaked in sugar syrup. Too sweet and the phyllo dough had lost all of the wonderful crispy texture. Threw away about half of each\\n5. The mango cake dessert and the chocolate hazelnut dessert. These two items, unlike everything else we had, were edible. However, they were not memorable. The mango cake was too sweet. The chocolate hazelnut was better but lacked any sophisticated flavors. When I compare either dessert to anything that I've gotten at Finale, I feel that both were more quantity and much less quality.

You start right away with a cup of water - pretty basic tap and no ice :(. Once the menu arrives, wow there are so many options. I had trouble narrowing it down between options but there are so many options on the sweet and savory spectrum. I ultimately decided on a southern Benedict, fried avocado, and orange juice. The food arrived about 10 minutes after we ordered (+1 for short wait once again!). Although, it may have been for a reason...The biscuits on the Benedict tasted a bit like raw batter, clearly undercooked. Luckily, the poached egg hid the taste really well and was cooked perfectly. Now the ugly--as a former vegetarian, I've had my fair share of plant-based chicken. The \\"chicken\\" from the Benedict was one of the worst I've tried; very chewy and flavorless. I'd also advise against the home fries if you're not fond of turmeric. My fried avocado was delicious and interesting (definitely recommend, but it is filling!). Another minor complaint is the serving of orange juice I received which was pretty small for its price (luckily, there's free refills on warm tap water). Our server was incredibly kind and accommodating so although I didn't exactly love my meal (definitely a hit or miss kind of spot), it's clear that this place is so welcoming and friendly and a recommended experience.

The food itself is good which makes me even more sad. It is the borderline rude and incompetent service that really does the place in. \\n\\nService started off slow but we could deal with that since we weren't in a rush. We finally ordered a bottle of wine and were informed that we would be charged a $5 corking fee. I understand charging a corking fee if someone brings a bottle in, but it is stupid to charge this fee on the wine you are selling. You don't charge a corking fee for wine by the glass, why would you charge it for the bottle? To top it off it didn't even have a cork, just a stopper that took two seconds to pull out, or at least would have if the server had known how to open it. \\n\\nLike other people, we weren't able to get what we wanted because they were out of ingredients. This isn't my biggest concern but it seems to be a trend among reviews. While we were eating our food, a couple of people who seemed to know the staff opened a door to a section of the restaurant that was unoccupied and apparently unheated. We and the table next to us started to get very cold since the door was left open and the recent cold snap has dropped temperatures into the thirties. A woman, presumably a manager or someone who worked there, noticed that the customer at the table next to us was shivering but instead of apologizing or closing the door told her that she choose to sit at the wrong table, insinuating that it was her fault for sitting next to an interior door. Eventually the woman came back out and made the table next to the door move rather than just shutting the door. If the place were full and they needed to open the section for extra seating I would understand it, but half the restaurant was still empty. \\n\\nThe icing on the cake was when were ready to leave and we tried to take home our half full bottle of wine. We asked for our bill and to have the wine bagged. The server looked at us as if we were speaking a foreign language. I explained that we wanted to take the bottle home and we needed it bagged so we could take it home without getting into any trouble. She left and came back with an empty plastic ice bag that had a gigantic hole torn in the side and told us we could put the bag in there and put it in our trunk. This is illegal! The law considers it to be an opened beverage even if it has been recorked and OLCC requires the restaurant to bag the wine and staple it closed before it leaves the premises. When I told her this she told me I was wrong and she knew she was right because she had just taken her OLCC liquor licensing test. Apparently she didn't read the material very thoroughly. At this point we were just ready to leave. We were told there was nothing she could do, that was all she had. Instead of offering to discount the wine or make any amends she just gave us a helpless look when we said we would just leave our half finished bottle there. \\n\\nThis is by  far some of the worst service I have ever seen!

Crammed into a high 4-top against the wall of the front room, our service was slow to start, the servers had challenges servicing the table, the bus staff took a diner's utensils as the main was being served, and it took 5 minutes after service to get staff's attention to get them replaced. We had another long delay in replacement when the server noticed one of our wine glasses was dirty and had to trek across to the restaurant to get another.

I went back to the GrubHub page to see if they had forgotten it, or if, indeed, it's meant to be ordered separately. A side of steamed rice is listed on there for an extra $1.50 - in my opinion, that's pretty stingy (and also kind of sneaky). I've never ordered from a Thai place that expects you to order a side of rice with the meal. Pretty hungry after all that waiting, and now I have to wait an extra half hour to cook a side of my own rice - and I'm pretty sure the curry will be cold by then.

You can also get a drink like a bottle of water for $1.00 or a can of soda $1.50. \\n\\nThey also offer Chicken Wings.Five-twenty wings for $8.00-27.00 or even side dishes like Cole slaw,hush puppies,fried okra or French fries for $1.50.The atmosphere here is good the older gentlemen who takes your order(might be the owner) is very nice and helpful and tells you to take your time. \\n\\nI orders the Tilapia sandwich witch comes with a few pieces of fish(4) and a piece of sandwich bread and some fries's,all the condiments(ketchup,mausterd and hot sauce0 are on the table and the food is served in a to go box with fork and knive wrapped in a napkin. \\n\\nThey also have  Combos one has your choice of fish,six jumbo shrimp, bread,fries and two hush puppies for $14.00 bucks. \\nThe other combo is only $9.95 and comes with fish,three jumbo shrimp, bread,fries, and two hush puppies, sounds like good combos for a decent price. \\n\\nI gave this place four stars because 1) There fish sandwich come with nothing but the fish and bread and a white sauce on the side, they could add some tomatoes and lettuce to the sandwich 2) They are closed Sunday and Monday, personally I cant imagine any business surviving on only being open 5 days a week 3) The menu is not very long witch is a good thing and bad thing because it is simple but yet he could add a few more items to make it more exciting but nothing to crazy.\\n\\nThey are open only 5 days a week, Tuesday-Saturday. 11am-6pm on Tuesday thru Thursday and 11am-9pm on Friday and Saturday.\\n\\nI will definitely be back to give them a shot again and try there wings , they also have some of the \\"best ribs in town\\" that is another option for next time sense the time I went was a Friday and being that it is Lent I was not able to try anything else but fish. \\n\\nBest moment here is when the gentlemen that took my order (might be the owner) ask me ''What kind of fish you are eating?

The Moscow Mule served here is excellent; crisp and refreshing on a hot summer night. \\n\\nFor snacks, we had the ox tongue sliders and some pickled veggies, both of which were pretty tasty. Bartenders seemed a bit frenetic, but I'd chalk that up to this place being relatively new.

This is where the \\"newness\\" started of the business started to infringe on what could have been a great experience. The waitress seemed to disappear after we initially ordered another round of drinks and appetizers. So we waited forever for the drinks until the appetizers were brought out. We had the Carpaccio, very tasty and the PEI mussels. This is where it started going downhill. At least a third of the mussels were closed, which as you know, is not good. I asked her about this and she told me that she would have the chef try and \\"fire them open\\" by putting them back in the liquid. I told her that I didn't think that would do the trick and that they were dead. She said she'd see what she could do. Shortly thereafter they brought us another round of mussels. And to my surprise there were closed mussels in the broth again. I can see maybe letting one slip by, but multiple on multiple occasions is not acceptable. This I attribute to a new place just trying to find it's legs, but that can be a real deal killer. What if someone pries open one of the mussels because they don't know any better and then eats it?

I know you have the die hard Franklin's fans out there who would swear by that and never give top bbq spot to any other place, but I would say La Barbecue is HANDS DOWN either just as good or the top competitor to beat out Franklin's.\\n\\nDisclaimer: I have not had Franklin's yet, so if you want to dismiss my credibility now, so be it. For those that want to know my reasons, read on.\\n\\nOk, maybe it's just me, but there's something wrong about waiting over 2 hours in line just for BBQ! I don't care how good it is, I won't wait that long for it! Granted, you can order Franklin's way in advance and then pick it up weeks later, but still! No matter how good the food is, no 2-3 hour wait is worth it in my opinion. And that applies to any restaurant that is top notch. I would never wait that long in line. If you have to wait that long, they should have a reservation system.\\n\\nThat being said, I have a VERY hard time believing Franklin's is really that much better than La BBQ that it's worth a 3-hour wait, whereas, if you are at La Barbecue at the right time, you barely wait 15 minutes for the most delicious BBQ on the planet! And the most I've waited in line was 1 hour. And that was on a Saturday afternoon on a beautiful, sunny day. So my perspective is, if you want some of the best BBQ in Texas/on the planet, go here! Skip that crazy Franklin's line and experience life-changing bbq. Your taste buds will make you cry because it's so good.\\n\\nEverything I have eaten here is so incredibly delicious - beef rib, pork ribs, brisket, and sausage. There hasn't been a single thing I've eaten here that wasn't mouth-watering, make-you-cry-because-it's-so-good, delicious. Nothing is over/smoked, undercooked, chewy, dry, or lacks flavor. \\n\\nThe pork ribs are some of the best you'll ever eat. Moist, juicy, pulls off the bone with every little effort, flavorful, and does not need any sauce on it. Portion sizes are fantastic and I can eat a whole rack of these easy.\\n\\nBeef ribs are Fred Flinstone size - no joke! Do NOT order a lot of these because they are literally the size of your forearm. So if you are by yourself, definitely buy only one because you might not have room for anything else. If you have a party of 3 or more, you might want more than one, but please look at the size before you buy more! I am not the biggest fan of beef ribs in general, so these were just ok for me. But for beef rib lovers, I'm sure these will blow your mind.\\n\\nTheir house made sausage is out of this world. I would buy individual sausage links unless you just want to load up on a lot and get a pound or more of these. They are flavorful and smokey, with the right mixture of being chewy and soft.\\n\\nTheir brisket is some of the best I've ever had. Again, moist, delicious, smokey, not too oily, and flavorful in every bite. They're cooked to perfection. You'll just want to keep eating these and won't be able to stop.\\n\\nBe advised, this is a food truck, so there is no indoor seating. And hopefully you'll get some good live music and a shady spot. I've been there when there wasn't good live music :)\\n\\nSo, again, if you want something that will be life-altering BBQ that you don't have wait 3 hours in the hot sun to get, this is a MUST EAT. If you're visiting from out of town, and don't have 3 hours to stand on line for a single meal, skip Franklin's and go to La Barbecue instead."},{"name":"BIBIBOP Asian Grill","address":"1281 Polaris Pkwy","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Good food.

It is large, and could have fed 2 small appetite people most definitely. The problem I had with it, was that for being pressed in a panini press, it was coldish.... I am not sure if they just grill the bread and then put the food on it, or how it works, but it wasn't anything like I thought it would be. The flavor was ok, but I would have liked a more \\"sharp\\" cheese on it, which would have increased the flavor of the sandwich greatly.

The enchiladas were amazing. We backed off and didn't finish them so we could enjoy them again tomorrow. As if we needed more to eat, we had the coconut flan for dessert which was also fantastic.

When we asked for another basket of underwhelming room-temperature bread, which we were only given one of to start, our waitress gave me a look that honestly shattered my self esteem for the rest of the night. She treated us like we were spoiled children instead of customers. My friend's soda didn't even come out for a half hour and even that was delivered angrily. Finally our food arrived and was admittedly halfway-decent for the price. Still, nothing blew us away. \\n\\nWhen the bill arrived, a twenty percent tip was added due to the fact we were a party of six. It's not as if we were not going to tip the waitress, however for such horrible service we were only going to give her fifteen.

They don't try to act like a $90 per plate steakhouse but their food is decent. She got her go-to dish, the Jambalaya. I got the ribeye with shrimp. Friends got the Cuban sandwhich, fish and chips, and they even made a surf and turf burger for a friend even though it's no longer on the menu.  She loved the burger- her fave. The fish and chips rated well although we all prefer halibut instead of the cod. Yes we know it would be more expensive. The Cuban was big and apparently tasty. My steak was cooked perfectly pink inside. I'm really tired of line cooks that don't know how to cook a steak to order. That's kinda their job. Like a painter that can't tell the difference between offwhite and eggshell. Anyway they nailed it. My wife's jambalaya was really subpar. It was obviously cooked by someone not familiar with how the dish is cooked, seasoned and presented.  I wouldn't say it was awful but she didn't finish it. And in the past we wanted to lick the bowl clean cuz it has been SO good.  Too bad being the birthday girl and all. Dessert was yummy. The brownie with ice cream was the best we've had.

I really hope they survive this time so that the investment they must have put into it isn't for naught. \\n\\nLast and, of course, most important, the food. The food is pretty good. I won't say it's always been the best Thai I've had, but it's been consistently worthy of a return visit. The flavor is excellent, the food can be a little overcooked, however. This is a common complaint I have about Thai food, though, and nothing special to this place. I'm sure that wok + high heat = easily overcooked food. It can be touchy, which I know from cooking the same dish at home. My chicken is cooked more properly, but their flavor wins by a landslide.\\n\\nWe have definitely found a new Thai restaurant that we can call our regular place.

He apologized and said that they ran out of salad and that they were making more. By the time our food already came out he brought us our salad.

The soup was on the thicker side, with a consistency like chowder, but still had good flavor. The French Dip was good, but the actual au jus was super thick and tasted like ramen seasoning so I didn't care for it. For our free appetizers, we got the ahi nachos and the crab cakes. Crab cakes were ok, they were on the softer side. The ahi nachos were probably my favorite - came with fried wonton chips instead of normal corn chips, which matched the ahi and avocados perfectly. \\n\\nThe service was outstanding, the waiter was super attentive and friendly, always smiled at us.

First let's be real about what this place is Not, it's not fancy. They don't spend a ton of money on decorations or the like, the booths are somewhat old and show their age, the dishes and such aren't brand new, etc... All that said, you can't knock it for things like that when the prices are so reasonable. All the wait staff are courteous and prompt, the owner/manager oversees everything and is always friendly, the sushi chefs are well dressed, they look and act the part, and the food is good! The new raw bar they started doing is cool! You will have to peel your own shrimp, and nothing is like top notch quality wise, but it's all fresh and tasty. I got the opportunity to try a funny little marinated octopus thing from the raw bar that I probably never would have otherwise. If you're really hungry, or you're one of those people like me who's main criticism of any other sushi place is you never can get enough, this is the place for you. All dishes are brought out fresh and made to order, they're not sitting around under a buffet light or something. And you can get tea, coffee, or ice cream at the end of your buffet meal.

BUT, I'd fight that parking ANY DAY to have their burgers.  Be sure to get the single patty burger or you'll be leaving part of it in the trash on the way out. Their fries are awesome!  I can ALMOST compare this burger to a burger where I grew up (small town...no chain store) where they buttered the buns and threw them on the grill, flipped them and then assembled the perfectly \\"browned\\" patty and toppings on them.  I don't know what it is about hamburger joints nowadays where they don't \\"brown\\" the patty.  I'm sorry, but that's where the FLAVOR comes from.  There is FLAVOR without SALT out there people...and \\"browning\\" your meat will do just that, add flavor without having to add tons of salt. \\n\\nAnyway, to get off THAT soap box...just try Five Guys.

Sounds simple yet some places find ways to fu*k this concept up, such as having veggies that taste like the plastic bag they came from, or too much bread and not enough meat.  Here at Tucci's they've got it right and deliver one helluva sub sandwich.  In fact it's so good that I'd have to put them Top 2 in the Austin area.  \\n\\nI love a great Italian sub and everyone has a different variation.  The bread or roll has to be fresh and taste great, the veggies have to be quality and garden-fresh, the dressing has to be the right compliment, and it has to have enough meat to make it worthy.  Tucci's passes with high marks across the board, there's plenty of salami, peppered ham, capicola, and enough proscuitto to feed a small family.  They certainly didn't skimp on the good stuff!  \\n\\nShe also recommended the Philly Cheesesteak so we decided to give it a shot, then took a bite of each sandwich to give the team immediate feedback - - wow, awesome!  I love the 5 different kinds of peppers that are offered:  spicy relish, sweet pepper, grilled peppers, banana peppers, and jalapenos.  You have to try their Spicy Mayo - - it ROCKS!!   They also have a garlic mayo which is pretty tasty - - it kinda reminds me of a really good Caesar dressing, but the Spicy Mayo is my fave. \\n\\nThere are daily and weekend lunch specials, and the service was diligent w/ a smile.

We came to the MidWest Grill ready to eat!  After a long day walking around the city we called Midwest Grill to see if there was a wait since it was 7:30 on a Saturday night.  \\"No wait, just come right in\\" said the man on the phone.  That should have been a sign to go elsewhere... any good place on Cambridge street has a wait at this hour.  The voice on the phone also mentioned that they offered all you can eat meat and a buffet for $25 a person.  Once we arrived, the 6 of us were seated by the window but only 4 of us were interested in eating the rest were more interested in the wine.  As one of the 5 tables in the restaurant we anticipated the service to be great especially since all the waiter really brings you are drinks.  We sat for a while with our bottle of wine waiting for meat to arrive.  After 10 minutes of no service we noticed the other tables were getting up to go to the buffet to grab plates.  Once the plates were brought to the tables the 2 men with long skewers of meat would arrive.  We followed suit and got up to the buffet which was the saddest table of food I have ever seen.  Half the items were unrecognizable and there were no signs to explain what we were choosing.  The only items worth anything more than 1 star were the plantains and the meatballs.  Once back at the table the dry and fatty meats began to arrive.  I will say the tastiest item they brought to us on the skewer was the garlic rolls.  We quickly asked the men to stop bringing meat and we filled up on bread and wine.  Once the bottle was emptied we asked for our check.  The woman returned to our table without our check, but instead with a tray of desserts and asked which one we preferred.  We asked for one of each so that we could taste if maybe the dessert made this place worth the $25 we were each paying... it did not. The cheesecake was very dense and tasteless, the flan too was sweet and covered in chocolate (isn't it suppose to be caramel?) and the tiramisu..well, that's an italian dessert and has no place being offered in a Brazilian restaurant.  \\n\\nThe worst part of the whole evening came when the check was brought to our table.  We were charged for 6 people, charges were added for the 3 desserts and gratuity was included.  This place was a rip off.  We spoke to the manager and explained that only 4 guest ate dinner and that we were never informed of the additional charge of the desserts.  Also, we wanted to decide the gratuity and since we weren't a party of 6 we asked it be removed.  He refused to credit us anything other than one person and removed $25 from our bill.  I understand that their business is struggling as was evidenced by the empty restaurant on a Saturday evening, but overcharging guests is not the way to grow your business.  I really wanted to like this place and I typically don't like to slam a small business in this way, but this experience left me with little choice.  I informed the manager to read the reviews on yelp and better understand the status of his business.  I encouraged him to take the feedback seriously and make changes before he's forced to shut down.\\n\\nFor those thinking of going out to eat on Cambridge Street, I'd recommend you choose from one of the many other restaurants in this area willing to accommodate you, treat you honestly, and offer great food and service."},{"name":"Oath Pizza - Fenway","address":"1348 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"New spot in the Fenway neighborhood and I was excited to try it out.

The salad bar at this location needs better maintenance.  Lettuce is usually limp and food is scattered around the bar. Once upon a time, Ruby's had this awesome veggie burger with a basil mayo. Well, they stopped using the basil mayo. Ok, fine. Guess I'll make due with the more common condiments. But then they did away with the burger, replacing it with the \\"zucchini minis\\". They took a little getting used to, but the cook was kind enough to tweak them a little to improve the texture (they originally were kinda mushy) and created a chipotle mayo for them as well.  But now those have been dropped from the menu. Agh! Ya know guys, I can't be the only vegetarian dining out in these parts. Even one good veg entr√©e, decently priced, would ensure my returning. A veg soup would also be nice.  By the way, thank you to the young man who created a yummy veg flatbed for me, once I'd discovered my usual items were no longer available on my last visit. That was above and beyond, and very much appreciated.  \\n  For now, guess I'm limited to coffee and dessert. The tirimisu is actually quite good. Yes, it's overpriced and premade.

The caprese salad with heirloom tomatoes and buffalo mozzarella was also noteworthy.\\n\\nFor mains, again too many attractive offerings to select from - not a bad thing at all!

We enjoyed a 2009 Ch√¢teau de Beaucastel Ch√¢teauneuf-du-Pape.  It was a fine example of a Rhone and was spicy, but lacked the bitter bite so often found in young reds.

If I had known better I would have looked this place up before we chose it, but the branding and the line out the door enticed me to spend precious vacation budget and give it a try. \\n\\nIt was the morning of Valentine's Day and they were really busy. A woman who seemed like the manager asked us all to be patient while they paused taking orders and caught up. I've worked retail too so I totally get that and thought they handled the rush really well. The line stretches in front of the display case which contains mouth watering cakes, cupcakes, doughnuts and pastries. I had a lot of time to look at my options and decide what prepared item I wanted which was fine, because eye candy.  \\n\\nWe ordered the oatmeal and a salted caramel chocolate chip cookie bar. I took my first bite and knew something terrible happened to it while being made. It had been made with coconut oil instead of butter, and I have never felt more betrayed by a pastry. I then looked this place up on Yelp and realized that it's a gluten-free vegan bakery. I am neither of those, though I imagine if I was, this place would have been the best thing that ever happened to me. I would have waited in the long line and bought a dozen pastries to eat all by myself. The oatmeal looked really pretty but took a good ten minutes to cool down enough to eat and the kind of skimped on the fruit. It was forgettable. \\n\\nMy biggest complaint is that they don't advertise that they are vegan and gluten-free. So they get 5 stars for being good at what they do but minus 2 stars for really bad communication to their customers.

Chicken fried bacon and biscuits, pulled pork eggs Benedict and their own classic version of the same dish. \\n\\nBoth the Benedict's came over biscuits instead of English muffins and the eggs were a little bit vinegary.

I got the koobideh with plain rice.  The koobideh comes with 2 skewers and though I asked, there is no option to halve it.  So we brought home leftovers for hubby's lunch today!  The smell of the saffron on the rice was intoxicating when the food arrived, a good sign.\\n\\nThere were little authentic Iranian touches missing- no raw onion served with the bread and herbs brought out initially.  No butter pats on the side of the chelo-kebab mains that I could melt into my steaming rice.  Initially the meat seemed to be cooked perfectly, but then upon further eating- the middle of the koobideh definitely was not cooked all the way through.  Hubby thought his barg was OK, nothing exceptional.\\n\\nI would say that my experience at Mehman last year was better overall, but hubby's family suggested Gilaneh when hubby mentioned his barg-kebab there was very dry.

The menu consists of about 6 or 7 craft beers on tap plus a full page of bottled craft beer options and then a couple pages of wine as well.  Although I didn't drink wine this visit I did take note to the fact most if not all of the wines offered also had a \\"by the glass\\" offering which I LOVED because nothing drives me more nuts than going to a wine place and having a wine list of 100 choices but only 5 of them offer a per glass price.  If I'm with a friend who doesn't necessarily want the same wine as me or if we aren't interested in having multiple glasses a piece then this really restricts our options so I was excited to see so many options at Therapy that would meet my wants/needs.  The food menu, although much smaller than the drink menu, is very comprehensive in appetizers, salads, sandwiches, burgers, and entree items and many of them were on the healthier side which is always welcome in my book.  \\n\\nService was good enough, it didn't stand out as an exceptional experience but I was content with the service received.\\n\\nI can see this location being very popular once it starts to warm up a bit more because it has a huge outdoor patio area but I don't recall seeing heaters so we opted to stay indoors.\\n\\nOne thing to note- the restaurant is on the second floor in the building so although it can be seen from the street it might not be the most obvious location unless you know its there.

My recent experience w Lupo falls into the latter category. A few weeks ago, my organization reserved a table to celebrate the Chairman of the Board, who was stepping down after years of volunteer service. We canceled our group reservation shortly thereafter - within a few days I believe, which was again, a few weeks ago. During Spring Break they called once and left a message (on Mar 21) during my holidays. They called again when I returned to work on Mar 22 and got ahold of me. Michael called to discuss the group menu for the 24th. I expressed surprise and explained we had changed our reservation to Le Croc, and that the person who coordinated the event must've forgotten to cancel. I apologized for the oversight and Michael gave me attitude, saying  it would have been \\"nice to know that!\\" After hanging up I spoke to the individual organizing the event and she explained how she had canceled weeks ago. She then called Lupo (presumably got Michael again) and explained how she had canceled and apologized if that message was not passed along (she was extremely polite, per her natural demeanour). We found it strange that although Michael acknowledged the cancelation, he got upset again mentioning he called me a few times over the weekend. I find this so unacceptable - to have mistaken the cancelation (ok people make mistakes, that's one thing, and entirely forgivable) but to blame the guests thereafter for not returning a call left while they were on holiday. What bothers me was the attitude he gave her. To be discourteous and unapologetically rude was unnecessary. Furthermore, there is only one record of a message, and no records over the weekend from Lupo. There was one missed call on the 20th at 4:45 from an unknown caller, a different number than what registers as Lupo. Additionally, the fact that I was off is moot as even if I wasn't there was only a ONE day delay between Lupo's phone message and our actual conversations. I have eaten here before, it's been awhile. The food was indeed excellent. But this experience will prevent us from planning dinners here. Very disappointing.

It was like cold dry potato, absolutely disgusting. My husband made the mistake of ordering the lemon crepe, which was not a crepe at all.

By the time we left we had tried two wines, two beers, two soups and a pasta. Ouch!\\n\\nBut you know what, Bin 26 Enoteca? It's OK. Go ahead, take my money, I didn't need it anyway. Because I have my memories of the cocoa tagliatelle (al dente thick noodled pasta made with cocoa powder, a subtle flavor that was more of an earthy undertone than explicit chocolatey taste) with a succulent, buttery mushroom sauce. And the bread and tomato soup drizzled with basil oil (so fresh, so lovely). And the soup of the day which was a chilled honeydew melon soup that had a spicy kick to it--yowza!\\n\\nAnd then there was the Greco (white wine from Italy, such a nice mix of different notes, somehow dry and fruity at the same time), and the juicy, juicy Barbera. ALL of the wines I have tried here (on my grand total of two visits) have been phenomenal. They know their way around a beer list, too, offering only five or six selections that are carefully chosen, and detailed descriptions of each one to help you decide what you'll like. We tried a Belgian tripel and a brown ale from England. Both were delightful.\\n\\nI love how every detail of this place is well thought out. Creative materials abound. Chairs made out of a basket weave of recycled seatbelts. Menus with thick leather covers. Light fixtures made out of (duh) empty wine bottles.

It rubbed me the wrong way but like i said it could have been an accident. The server took our order and since we were the only ones there i figured it would be quick. Wrong. It took close to 20 minutes for 2 omelettes. Come to find out the reason it took so long is because the two girls working also made themselves food at the same time and proceeded to sit at their bar and eat their meals right in front of us as well as right next to another guest that came in after us. Not only were they eating in front of customers but they were showing each other videos from their phones loudly and openly talking and giggling about them. When we were done with our meals, which were average, we had to wait close to 10 minutes for our server to get off of her phone and bring us the check. Extremely unprofessional.

Perfectly crispy and drizzled with hot sauce, the boneless pieces of chicken were my ideal. To kick things up another notch (yeah, sue me for using this tired saying, haha), the tenders were served on a bed of sweet corn grits (corn and grits together?!

I picked off the roasted tomatoes before sinking my teeth into the little mini burgers, to avoid splashing. The arugula and the rosemary aioli complemented the patties very well.\\n\\nMac & cheese was awesome, made with a combination of white cheddar and manchego cheeses and topped with panko. I am seriously a lover of panko, as common as it has become as a breading. But it is popular for a reason and that is because panko is so crispy, which lends a wonderful contrast in texture when it is used with softer foods. Soft foods like mac & cheese. Great execution on a seemingly innocent dish that can and does easily go wrong.\\n\\nWhile my belly was about to burst through the dress I wore to dinner (I know right? I rarely dress up when going to stuff my insides), I went ahead and ordered the Malva pudding, which was the only traditional South African dessert of the bunch.

To me, the single bigger patty is juicier with more flavor than a two patty burger.  Somehow, Five Guys manages to get two patties that are quite juicy and flavorful.  I also prefer the buns here to those at most of the places and their selection of condiments/toppings is above average for a standard burger.  Yeah yeah, I know that Hopdoddy and other more upscale places have more choices.

For what was once a superior sushi restaurant located in east vancouver has now dwindled down to a empty shell.  The passion, taste, and quality has all been sacrificed over the years to far distance themselves from the once pretisgious placing as one of the best japanese restaurants in Vancouver.  The exterior and interior decor has always been the same, the dated and faded yellow sign hanging in front; and the decades old grungy carpet and peeling walls miraculously still standing.  No need to hope for any renovations since it is nearing a quarter century and evident the end is near.  The restaurant is still owned and operated by the same family with Kuni as the head sushi chef now and his mother as the kimono clad waitress who clearly lost her passion years ago and would love to retire.  For what was once joyous greetings with smiles all around and great customer service has now come down to a look of annoyance and inconvenience to serve the few tables of customers still loyal to its brand.  Koko is now nothing more of a novelty than a enjoyable japanese sushi restaurant, if you are looking for nostalgia then by all means, but if you are chasing memories of delicious food and service those days have long been forgotten.  With the quality and quantity of japanese restaurants out and available now, Koko struggles to even make ends meet and it is quite evident in the quality of their food.  The sushi did not taste fresh as if you had to use extra soy sauce and wasabi to mask a stench emitting from it, let alone being warm as if not stored properly or has been left sitting out in room temparature.  Lets just say I did not have a pleasant experience afterwards and instantly knew where it came from but should have known better not to eat it.  The overall quality just seemed as if you could have made it better with ingredients at home then paying for the convenience of eating out.  There was nothing special let alone spectacular left from the old days where everything was good portions, good size, and good quality.  From the days of enjoying Koko once a week as a child, to now trying to even consider it once a year is a sad sad memory of how these independant smaller older japanese restaurants are being dominated by bigger newer more mainstream ones.

The caprese salad was the best I've ever had, but the truffle mashed potatoes blew my mind! They were perfectly creamy and buttery, and the truffle flavor was balanced and not at all overwhelming, as it sometimes can be.  I still rave about them - in fact, my fiance tried to order some from Bin 26 to bring to me as a surprise when he flew into D.C.

Being a wing fan since I had my first one over 30 years ago I've been on a quest ever since to find the best chicken wing.\\n\\nI have not been to every restaurant in ATL that serves wings but I have tried many - the usual Taco Mac, 3 Dollar, Buffalo's, Wild Buffalo, Buffalo Wild Wings, and 100's of no name. Clay's has the best wings I've ever had.  \\n\\nThe wings were big - not like some places where I call them pigeon wings.  They were juicy and cooked to perfection - not under or over cooked, just right.  They also offer a variety of wings sauces - MILD, MEDIUM, HOT, XHOT, JALAPENO, LEMON PEPPER, HOT LEMON PEPPER, TERIYAKI, HOT TERIYAKI, BBQ, HOT BBQ, HONEY BBQ, HOT HONEY BBQ, IERK, HONEY MUSTARD, HOT HONEY MUSTARD and RANCH.  The XHOT is awesome.  I recommend HOT with XHOT on the side.  \\n\\nThe service is top notch.  With only one server the kitchen and manager server as BU and do a great job. I've eaten there 5 times now every time I'm immediately greeted with a smile, served quickly and right back out the door.  \\n \\nThe environment isn't the prettiest you'll ever see.  It's old.  It's a sports bar without an actual bar.  It's small with only 15 tables so go early if you want a seat. I think its perfect for what they are true local sports bar with great food.  there are a couple of TV's not the best quality, they've got a large screen from the 90's. Remember the ones that were 3 feet thick and weighed about 500 pounds.  Well, they've got one. I think it's the \\"icing on the cake\\" as for who they are.  Down to earth local beer serving awesome wing place.  Who cares what it look like!\\n\\nAs for kid friendly I say yes (ages 5 and up).  There is no smoking, but smells like it use to, not really bad like a car but you can tell way back when.  It's close quarters and not a place where a 2 or 3 year old can run around - not that they should and they don't hand out crayons and coloring paper.   \\n\\nLocation: Very hard to find.

But this place was one of the single worse dining experiences I've ever had.  And that it happened near my home is prompting me to write this in the hopes that no one else makes the same mistake I did last night with my wife and friends.  We arrived at 10:50pm to a Snooki-like hostess who looked at me twice while chatting with her coworker before I prompted her and asked if we could sit.  I notice the place was half empty and didn't think it was going to be a problem - I counted 8 empty tables.  She asked us to wait while they set up a table (strike 1).   She then had the waitstaff organize a setting for 4 right next to another couple who were obviously trying to have a quiet dinner.  With all the empty tables available, there was no need to drop us in right next to them.  So I asked her to move our party away from them - and got a really nasty look from her and the waitress for my trouble (strike 2).  The waitress then seats us - doesn't even welcome us but immediately states that the kitchen closes at 11:20 pm and then disappears (strike 3 - should have left but we stuck it out - bad move).  After about another 5 minutes, we flag her down so we can get an order in, and she is obviously not happy - apparently she was not supposed to be waiting on us but can't find our waiter.  She does nothing to mask her displeasure or attitude, and the couple we're with is now uncomfortable.  We figure we'll make it easy and just order three apps.  Unfortunately the only thing worth eating was the guacamole that they made at table-side.  Excellent.  The other two apps were awful.  The nachos had a distinctly bitter aftertaste to them and the queso fresco dip came out lukewarm and congealed.  We decide it's time to go but can't get our waitress back.  I finally catch her eye  and ask for the check.  We pay and leave.  On the way out, I mention our experience to the \\"hostess\\" - who refused to acknowledge the problem and asks us to just leave.  To make a bad situation worse, 3 of the 4 of us don't feel well for the rest of the evening.  As of this morning, my wife is still not feeling well.  \\n\\nTo say I'm stunned is an understatement.  I travel a lot for work and have eaten Mexican all around the world.  This isn't even close to being decent Mexican food - never mind authentic.  The quality of our \\"meal\\" was substandard, and exacerbated by the incredibly poor service from the minute we walked in the door.\\n\\nI grew up in Boston, so please believe me when I tell you there are dozens of other options for decent Mexican cuisine in the city - even more so if you're willing to travel 10 - 15 minutes outside of Boston.  This is an overpriced, faux upscale chain tourist trap preying on visitors to Boston who may not have the time to review their dining options.  You can do far better for a lot less money than Rosa Mexicano.  If you're in the Seaport area and are hungry, walk across the street to Atlantic Beer Garden.  There are also several other establishments in the area that are more deserving of your time and money.\\n\\nUPDATE 3/13/13:  In the interest of full disclosure, please note that the Regional General Manager for this chain contacted me regarding my posting.  We had a very constructive phone call and he informed me that the Boston location is in the midst of installing a new management team as well as some retraining.  I thank him for the courtesy of the call and ask that you consider this update when making your dining choice."},{"name":"Sejuiced Vegetarian Restaurant","address":"1958 W 4th Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Great breakfast burrito & greek tofu wrap!

I guess in the last couple months, Jamba Juice has started charging for boosts. You know, the ones they used to pester you about FOR YEARS because they were free. If you have a usual, you have a usual boost. They don't even mention that they're now charging... which is a bit underhanded. The sign they use is the same sign that used to only have the extra $ for the special boosts. \\n\\nExtra (-) for not being kid friendly. After I bought my own drink and split it with my kid, she ended up still wanting more. So I walked back to get a kids size drink, just for her. Apparently I'm not able to order the one she likes because its not on the kid menu of \\"4\\". I asked if she was serious and she told me that all the kids drinks are specially formulated to be healthy because there is no dairy. Does she realize a) its my kid and b) an 18 month old kinda likes/needs dairy. Apparently I could have bought a larger size, bought the 50 cent kids cup and then still had extra.

We may have had a few plates swapped accidentally.  For sides, we had the spinach, onion rings and mac & cheese.  The onion rings were the highlight.  What's very nice is that they have lots of sauces and different preparations for the filet's as well so if you want to flavor it up, this is the place\\n\\nWith the steak we had a very nice 2008/2009 Trefethen Reserve Cab.

We couldve eaten it all but restrained ourselves.\\n\\nAll in all, it was a very good dinner.  The only other constructive comment I would make is about table size.  We were at a table for four and had five.  At a round table, that can work just fine depending upon whether its a pedestal table or not.  At most rectangles, though, it can be a tight squeeze.

Most start out relatively upscale, then slowly decline.  First it's subtle, like a Saks Fifth Avenue moving out and being replaced by a JCPenney.  Things accelerate from there, and before you know it the place is nothing but dollar stores and check cashing places and no one wants to go there after dark.\\n\\nI'm not saying the Arboretum is definitely doomed to that sort of path, but when a monument to pointless consumerism like Sharper Image moves out and a third-rate burger joint moves in, that has to be taken as a bad sign.\\n\\nBeing a former loyal Mooyah-phile before the unfortunate Geaux Burger incident and later closing down, I was on the lookout for another good burger joint.  We noticed Five Guys on one of our many trips to Barnes and Noble, otherwise known as the only place in the Arboretum we can afford to shop.  The inside of the store is clean but sparsely decorated.  The whole atmosphere of the place screams \\"sterile efficiency\\", which would be fine if the idea was for customers to get their food quickly and escape before they started having flashbacks to their middle school cafeteria that would eventually drive them to madness.  However, the fact that these guys cook every burger fresh and provide free peanuts while you wait suggests that they are inviting you to hang around for a while, which seems at odds with the decor.\\n\\nThe aforementioned peanuts are provided in large cardboard boxes perched atop the kind of industrial brown garbage cans that probably look filthy straight out of the factory and just decline from there.  On the bright side, once you get past the notion of eating peanuts that spent a not inconsiderable amount of time perched over a smelly garbage can, they are quite tasty.\\n\\nThe burgers here are heavily reminiscent of the late great Mooyah, although Mooyah's bun was far superior.  The bun at Five Guys is inadequate for the toppings, especially if you order it \\"all the way\\".  Halfway through the burger, the sopping remains of the bun will be sliding helplessly away, leaving you with meat patties and various condiments sliding inexorably into your shirt.  Wear short sleeves.  Other than the unfortunate bun, the burgers taste very very similar to Mooyah, which is not a bad thing at all.\\n\\nThe fries here are underwhelming at best.  The quantity is more than adequate, with a single large fries being easily enough for a family of four, provided none of those four are growing teenagers.  The taste, though, leaves much to be desired.  They seem to be chronically undercooked and undersalted.  Maybe the poor quality of the fries is just a cynical ploy to get people to upgrade to the cajun spiced variety in hopes that an excessive amount of seasoning can save them, sort of like how Red Robin's seasoning saves their horrible fries.  We can only hope.\\n\\nOverall, the place is good but not great.  It remains our preferred destination when we get hungry during one of our Barnes & Noble trips but can't be bothered to take out the second mortgage necessary to eat at the Cheesecake Factory and we're too famished to survive the long trip to the Elevation Burger down the street."},{"name":"Veggie Galaxy","address":"450 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Disclaimer: I am not a vegetarian nor do I have any desire to become one.

I had to ask for butter but when it came it was melted for me (score!). The salad was excellent. All the right things for a house salad but the winning attribute was that it had no iceberg lettuce!

It literally is meat heaven, and for an all you can eat style of. eating? this is your place to go.\\n\\nMy friends and I went here on a Friday night, I believe, and there was no one there. We were perhaps one of 4 or 5 other groups of people. I suppose that was good for us, bad for the restaurant. Which isn't good for us, because they're actually a decent place.\\n\\nAnyways, onto the stuff.\\n\\nIt took them like 2 minutes to get to us at the front door and have us be seated. I started off going with bar of sides. The only thing I had was roasted plantains, or what I'm assuming were plantains. They were actually really good. They were very sweet, but not in that artificial way. I think they must have been roasted as to caramelize the natural sugars from the fruit. \\n\\nOther than that, I had meat, most of which was really really good. Good pork ribs, pork tenderloin, kielbasa, sausage, lamb, sirloin, chicken drumsticks and rolls.\\n\\nIf you don't know how this restaurant works, then listen up. You've got a card that says \\"Go Ahead\\" or \\"Stop\\". They come around with meat, on long skewers and ask you if you want it. You can either accept or reject this meat. I highly recommend getting as much steak sirloin as possible, it's really really good. The kielbasa, pork ribs and tenderloin are also excellent. I'm not sure about the lamb, I've never been a lamb person, but maybe it was just a bad batch. \\n\\nI mean, it was a good experience. I genuinely liked this new way of eating. The reason I'm not giving it a higher rating was because it didn't really impress me. Yes, the sirloin and some of the other meats were tasty, but that's about it. The side salad bars and other eateries bars are good, but things like this need to be cooked to order. They should also have a selection of other Brazilian-themed dishes that incorporate other aspects and sides of meats. \\n\\nCould the quality of some of the meats been better, yes, on some of them, the entire thing was almost fat. I suppose this argument is almost irrelevant  because if you don't like it, just get more. It's not like it's going to cost you any extra.\\n\\nAt $25 dollars for all you can eat, you're getting a fair price. This does not include drinks, so you'll be paying extra for those. \\n\\nOverall, it's a cool experience. Should you take your date there?

Bread and the dish of oil, parmesan, etc. was placed on the table. After we decided not to get a pizza, I ordered an appetizer of clams in red sauce along with GF bread (we were going out after and I didn't want a huge pile of leftovers). \\n\\nI received the wine but not the bread; I didn't want to drink the wine until I had something in my stomach, so I waited patiently. For awhile. Our meals came out, and I still had no bread. Now I not only had luke-warm wine, but I also had lots of sauce and nothing to eat it with. Plus I was now 30 minutes hungrier. When I finally flagged down the waiter, he didn't seem to realize I'd ordered the bread (it was the first thing I ordered after the wine) and seemed apologetic. My boyfriend and I sat staring at everything getting cold (he was being polite waiting for me) for more and more time, until finally I flagged the waiter down and asked again about the bread. (I'd assumed given how much they say they're GF it was a matter of bringing it out.) Very rudely he said to me, \\"well you'll just have to wait!\\" At that point we seriously considered walking out, as we hadn't touched anything we had been given. \\n\\nAt that point I asked the other waiter if there was a manager to speak to; none.

I knew that we couldn't spend time in the area without eating, so I quickly referenced my Yelp app for some good recommendations. Carmelina's did not disappoint. \\n\\nThough it was early evening on a Sunday, we immediately received a table in the small, cozy restaurant. The tables are quite close together, but I didn't feel as if we were awkwardly close (you know, when you are tempted to join your neighbor's conversation because you can hear everything they are saying...). We started with a bottle of red, which was incredibly cheap compared with bottle prices at most restaurants. I believe we spent roughly $30. For entrees, my boyfriend chose a tried and true dish--Chicken Parmesan. It was outstanding, nice and crisp, full of flavor. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. I chose from the specials of the day menu--prawns over risotto with an assortment of vegetables.

I was actually sick all night and it was unnerving to think that this was the reason.  The food was actually sickening, it was so poorly conceived and executed.  \\n\\n Service was okay, but the server seemed oblivious to food issues, so I never got a chance to tell the problem.

We said countless times we didn't need a high chair or booster seat for the 2 year old but we would need the sling for the car seat.....in the end we didn't get either and just squeezed in the booth.

However, the ramen was disgusting.  The two veggie ramens had barely any broth (the broth level didn't even cover the noodles) and the noodles weren't cooked all the way.  We asked for more broth and they brought out what I am pretty sure was soy sauce diluted with water.  That's the same broth that was used in my pork ramen which was not pork belly but some disgusting shredded pork that looked like it came from City Barbeque.  And I didn't get an egg which is my favorite part of ramen.  We asked for an egg and they brought out a plate of them which had clearly just came out of the refrigerator and the whites were not even cooked fully.  I barely ate any of my ramen because it tasted like the cook dropped the whole salt shaker in it.\\n\\nAfter we finished our meal and our server was told one check, we waited...and waited...and waited.  20 minutes later we had to ask ANOTHER server for the check.  Almost $150 for a crappy meal and terrible and non-apologetic service.\\n\\nI predict this place will close in a few months.  Stay away!\\n\\n(Side note:  We saw servers touching the food in the kitchen and rearranging stuff on the plates.  No hands were washed.  A stack of plates also fell on the floor and were just picked up and stacked--ready to be reused again.  Disgusting and unsanitary.)"},{"name":"Caribou Coffee","address":"231 Peachtree Street","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"This Caribou is great - mostly because the employees are so friendly and go above and beyond.

I was a really big fan of the 'que before the change, so we had to try it now to see how it stacks up. We gave them a couple weeks under new mgmt, and went today for lunch. We got there right at 11am, and the line was already 30-40 deep or so, which took about 45-50 min to get served. They were playing old country music on the speakers,mostly Waylon and Willie type stuff. \\n\\nThey had brisket, sausage, pork ribs, beef ribs, turkey and pulled pork on the menu. The two best items from the old place were the beef ribs and brisket. I ordered 1 beef rib, and 1 slice of brisket. For a side, I got 1 slice of cheese, and a dr pepper in a can. Total bill came out to ~$28. OUCH!!! My coworker got the same, and a link of sausage, and his bill was $33. \\n\\nThe brisket was very tender, probably as tender as any I've had in Texas. It had a nice appearance, but just seemed to be a bit light on the overall flavor. I think maybe they don't use as much pepper seasoning now, or perhaps the way they cook it allows it to mellow out more. It is good, but I think it is a notch down from the previous pitmaster. \\n\\nThe beef rib was also very tender, and the flavor profile was very similar to the brisket. It was just a little below what they cranked out before the changeover. That being said, it was one of the top 3-4 beef rib selections I've had anywhere.\\n\\nThe sausage was very good, with a lot of visible seasonings and such in the link. It was probably a bit overdone, but not to the point of being dry. It had a nice spicy flavor, and I would give it a good 8.5 out of 10. \\n\\nOverall, this place has a lot going for them. They will also face comparisons to the old pitmaster, and what he did so well. But here are a couple key points that will define success, at least based on what I feel they should be. \\n\\n1. The line is too long and slow, especially for opening at 11. It never moved fast before, but you could always arrive earlier at 10:30 or 10:45, and get served quickly. That option is gone now, and many workers won't be able to handle hour long waits, plus eating and travel times. \\n2. The prices are just too high now. They are pricing themselves at the 'Lambert's level', and while the food is at that level, the whole standing in line for an hour and sitting outside doesn't justify $30 plates. My co-worker said \\"the food is good, but they sure are proud of it based on those prices\\". He is exactly right. They need an option where I can get plate for ~$20, and I don't want just sausage or a small slice of brisket. \\n\\nThen again, maybe I am not the target market. I would never compare a place like this to Donn's BBQ, but Donn's does have 2 meat plates for $10-15. Add a markup for the premium cuts that LA uses, and make 2 meat plates available for $15-20, and we have a winner. Until then, we have a very good BBQ joint that charges too much for their food."},{"name":"Hops N Scotch","address":"1306 Beacon St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3.5","text":"Initial impression was that this isn't your average bar.

Rude, sketchy and with bad vibes. \\n\\nI understand that they are evil because of what they do, but why do their personnel have to be so evil too? If you've ever experience a car tow with them, I'm sure you can relate, as I find so many others instantly can once I share my experiences with them! Busters is among the worst businesses in Vancouver to deal with and it angers me that the City has outsourced all downtown towing to this company in particular. \\n\\nIf you drive and park on the streets of downtown Vancouver often like I do, you know that this very action can be stressful! The City issues parking tickets the very moment you're overdue on the meter and Busters tows within seconds. I swear there\`s some kind of Big Brother video cam watching over us and a big red beeping button that lights up to target us like we're pons!\\n\\nSo, I was towed a couple weeks back and I deserved it. I missed one of the signs on the meter. I thought that I could park after 10PM until 9AM in the morning, but I missed the extra time restrictions in smaller print on the side that said no stopping, 7AM-9AM. Fine. Tickets suck, but it takes a lot more to get me upset, so I went to pick it up on Main. Just like last time, the attendant was so rude, disrespectful and acted completely annoyed with the logistical questions I asked. This was what ruined my day. I felt like she assumed I was going to be angry at her, so she felt she had to be mean, rude and condescending first. I've experienced this before with them, and so many people have shared similar stories with me. \\n\\nIn another case a couple months back, my dad's friend was towed after misreading a sign with the small extra restrictions on the side (just like I did). Busters dented the front of her BMW in the towing process. When she brought it up, they treated her with disrespect, argued vigorously with her and said they could do nothing about it. It cost her over $1000 after the damages. \\n\\nBusters is full of bad vibes, bad practices (CBC: http://bit.ly/toeQMY) and personnel that need to learn how to work with people better. They're in need of a rebrand, reassessment in unlawful business practices and corporate culture update. No one likes them because of how they do what they do and the perception they create for themselves: They are the evil car towing company that inconveniences busy people and treats them like dirt in the process, and were just very lucky for the City to guarantee them business... However, I think there is hope that they can do better, but only if they care to improve themselves: They could be the car towing company whose priority is to maintain clear traffic patterns and good traffic flow in the City, especially in busy rush hour, so that commuters can get from A to B without any backups ... and who strives to treat their customers well by guiding them through the process easily and with respect.

Is this what you do to your customers?  Call the police on them?  I called multiple times because I had a complaint.  I will never order from domino's again.  I am filing a charge back and I am contacting corporate even though the extremely rude manager refused to give me the number to them or the local franchise owner.

The man I placed my phone order with was incredibly rude. I realize that I called around lunch time on a Monday, so they are obviously busy with many other orders. However, there was no need for the way I was treated. I ordered two sandwiches and whenever I would try to customize them, he kept cutting me off and would not allow me to get full sentences out. I felt insanely rushed to the point I couldn't even take the time to click back to the menu page to decide my order. At one point, he told me he would need to put me on hold to take another call because I was taking too long to order. Mind you, I believe I was on the phone with him for less than 2 minutes. When the delivery guy arrived, I expressed my annoyance with him over this employee. He informed me that the rude man on the phone was, in fact, the manager of the store. I was shocked that a manager would not know better than to treat customers so disrespectfully. He will never have to worry about my phone order holding him up again.

It was a burrito without a tortilla - how that is possible? I don't know.\\nPart 2: Mexican pizza.  The dish is simple and elegant - I can't even describe to you how this could be messed up.  The wrong cheese, no sauce, and just beans and crunchy flat tortilla.  This was more puzzling that the enigma codes cracked during world war 2.  But then there is part 3.\\nPart 3:  Crunch wrap supreme.  I think the only way you can get worse is when the thing is simply missing - guess what?

The good news was that the mine frire was pretty good, with huge chunks of chicken and a tasty chutney on the side. The Shyamosa, a take on a samosa, also has the same terrific chutney and chili sauce, and it's deep-fried exterior was so good. However, the filling inside was kind of bland...I would have thought it would have more spices to kick up the flavor. I'll admit to being super full, but wish everything was a bit punchier in terms of flavorings and spices. My fault, perhaps, for going for medium spice level, but it did seem to go beyond that.

The bartender said that they are still working on a printed menu. I found that disappointing, as I really enjoy trying restaurant-inspired cocktails, and with no menu, we struggled a bit to make a selection. We then ordered the fried green tomatoes, which were quite bland, and scarcely showed a trace of the remoulade that was supposed to garnish the dish. We also ordered the she crab soup. It was served lukewarm so we asked if they could heat it up a bit. Once served to temperature, it was easily one of the best she crab soups I have ever tasted - it was amazing! I ordered the shrimp and grits, and unfortunately, they too were not at temperature. They were again lukewarm. I didn't return it to the kitchen because after one bite it was clear that even proper temperature would not be able to save this dish. The flavor was mediocre, at best. My husband had the duck and waffles with blueberry confit. He noted that the flavor was bland, and there was nothing to marry the flavors of the two main ingredients. Lastly, the restaurant had a live pianist who was quite awful. She was reading the music (as opposed to playing by ear) and would often stop mid-song to look down at the keys to find her next note.

The fish tofu also good, nicely seasoned, not too spicy. The chicken heart and winter melon were in a soup that was suppose to be the spice, but I drank it and it was not that spicy. It was a good broth, but maybe too much salt. The chicken hearts were small, as if they've been sitting out and loss a lot of the fluid or were from elderly chickens.\\n\\nOverall, I would come back and try again.

You walk up and pick up your food which most likely there is something wrong, mis-ordered or missing completely from your tray. Try to work it out and it is just more confusing.  Stick with whatever food they gave you and be happy.  The confusion and Chaos with ordering and picking up cost me the same price as if I went somewhere that had servers.

If I could give a place a four-star review based on the food and the table-level service alone, I would give it to Dolce Italian.  As it is, all I can say is that the chef is far too good for the restaurant in which he or she is currently working, and I would encourage him or her to move on.  The food is superb.  The restaurant itself?  New money, the kind that doesn't actually understand the difference between image and reality.  (Just as an example, while we were there, the music was all late eighties and nineties pop music, with a smattering of Spanish Euro-pop.  If it is an Italian restaurant, I would expect the pop music to be Italian, or by a current Italian group, or something similar.  When I asked the afternoon manager, however, he shrugged his shoulders and said that nobody else cared -- it was European. Oy.  The words I thought of, eating there:  slick, rather than elegant.  Trendy, rather than substantive.  A place to show off, rather than a place to savor and enjoy. A place where people are grabbing after status, not a place where people have it within themselves inherently, no matter their financial worth.)  \\n\\nWhen we arrived, we found the inside very \\"live\\" -- loud, hard surfaces, tables crammed together, not at all conducive to peaceful eating and discussion.  One would have to shout to be heard.  So we asked the maitre'd if we could be seated on the outdoor patio.  After some discussion with the manager, and some glances in our direction that included eyerolls, we were told that the patio could be opened for us. We were then seated in a location where we would not be seen by any of the patrons inside.  The damage was done, apparently, and others began to be seated outside.  Each time, the afternoon manager looked resentfully at us for just a minute as he passed.  Sir: it was your choice to seat us outside -- a simple no, we're sorry, the patio won't be open until X time would have sufficed; we would have nodded, said thank you, and eaten inside.  Slight frowns or not, however, it was lovely outside on the patio, even in the evening humidity: quiet, cool, and pleasant for dining.\\n\\nOnce we had been seated, the afternoon manager came out and rattled off the specials.  He seemed irritated when my friend, who is a celiac, asked about the gluten-free options, and he gave terse answers. Our table server, a young Hispanic woman, was utterly delightful.  She answered thoughtfully, and even on her own accord checked with the chef -- something that the manager should have done.  She even took care to place the sauce for my friend's dish on the side, just in case.  Throughout the evening she was attentive without being obtrusive, and was the perfect balance of there-when-needed and not there when not.  She also had mastered the art of not asking about food right when we had taken bites. My salmon and vegetables were superbly cooked.  They were easily the best I have had in Atlanta; the sauce was just right, perfectly and simply balanced.  It was as good as anything I had eaten in Italy.  My friend's seafood with puttanesca sauce was also superb, though we decided that the sauce didn't need to be there.  As I wrote earlier, the chef is too good for the place!  During our meal, another, slightly older man checked on us as well; I suspect he was the evening manager or the chef.  His manner, unlike the afternoon manager's, was also quite welcoming and warm.  He treated everyone the same way-- the two of us, who were clearly not Dolce Italian's usual demographic (middle aged, with frizzy hair that has never seen a keratin treatment, overweight, plain clothes) to the middle aged men with thin, trendily-dressed, carefully coiffed young women.  That was the way *I* was raised to behave, and I appreciated that.  (When I was a child, my parents' friends included everyone from local farmers to people who could -- and did -- fly friends to Italy. For a long weekend. On a whim.)  \\n\\nAfter we left and were waiting for the valet service to bring our car, I mentioned the general falsity of the atmosphere coupled with pretentiousness to the remaining valet.  He laughed and rolled his eyes.  \\"That's Dolce Italian, for sure.\\"  It's sad when the staff notices.  \\n\\nThere's one last element that bothered me about the place.  I don't know if it was simply an accident of the time that we were there, or if it is symptomatic of a longer term trend.  I hope that it was merely a matter of accident that day.  Almost every member of the staff was a person of color, but every single patron that day was White.  (And almost all were excessively thin, but I digress.)  I hope that was just a timing accident, and that more of the serving staff is White and that many more patrons are people of color.  Otherwise, especially for such a diverse city, the vibe was just uncomfortable."},{"name":"La Famiglia Giorgio's","address":"112 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Whenever I go to the North End with anybody, it kind of goes like this: \\n\\n\\"Where do you want to eat?\\" \\n\\"Eh, I dunno.\\" \\n\\"Me either.\\" \\n\\"Let's just walk up and down the street until something looks appealing.\\" \\n\\"Alright, cool.\\" \\n\\nLast night brought us to La Famiglia Giorgio's. \\n\\nTo start off, my Irish mom makes better meatballs. Not just slightly better. They're amazing when compared to the over sized yet bland offering swimming in a sea of marinara. \\n\\nI got the rosa sauce (mix of alfredo and marinara) with ravioli. It was good, but the alfredo was really grainy on account of the cheese not being melted properly. One of my friends got a pizza that was way too crispy, and the other got gnocchi with an eggplant sauce, which was actually probably the best plate of the three. \\n\\nIf you're not Italian or have no sense of Italian food, then you'll probably think it's okay, especially since they have humungo portions.  I am half Italian and will be a snob about Italian food forever.  I almost didn't want to take home my leftovers. I didn't care about the rudeness factor, but rather the wasteful factor. As many others have said, it's really quantity over quality. \\n\\nThe inside of the restaurant is fine, typical of the majority of restaurants on Salem and Hanover, so no complaints there. Staff was friendly but not super attentive. The bathroom for the bottom floor is in the same small hallway as the cash register, so it was kind of awkward when I tried to make my way back there and there were three servers chatting in the hall and nobody even moved until I said \\"excuse me\\".

My girlfriend and I took a trip to Coolidge Corner and we stopped by for dinner. We waited about 10 minutes for a table on a Saturday night (not bad at all.) The downstairs portion of the restaurants looked very rustic and cozy. Upstairs had a great view of Coolidge Corner, but felt really cramped. \\n\\nThe beer and scotch lists are, as expeceted, fantastic. It's been a little while since my visit, so I can't remember what scotch I tried, but it was phenominal. My girlfriend ordered a flight of Belgian beers which had a sampling of 4 different beers. \\n\\nWe split two appetizers: The pecan stuffed dates wrapped in bacon, and the scotch eggs. This was my first scotch egg and I loved it! The dates, however, were my favorite item of the night. They were packed with flavor and I regretted the fact I had to share them! \\n\\nFor entrees, we weren't too hungry so we ordered sanwhiches. I tried the Grilled Chicken Club. I usually do not order chicken when I go out, but this dish caught my eye. The chicken was heading towards the dry side, but I'm so glad it was grilled over fried anyway. The star of this dish was the rosemary mayo. There was so much flavor packed into it, and I tried to savor every bite. My girlfriend ordered the Catfish Po'Boy. I know she enjoyed it a lot. I only sampled a couple bites but I agree that it was a good dish. \\n\\nThe only complaint I really have was that the service got a little slow towards the end of the night. Up until our entrees came, our waitress was very attentive to our needs. I was interested in ordering a beer or perhaps another glass of scotch, but she didn't come to our table again until after someone else had cleared out dinner plates away. There was a (very cramped) table of about 10 or so next to us that got a lot of attention, so we may have just slipped her mind.\\n\\nEven with that lapse, I am very glad we visited and I will return to drink more scotch!"},{"name":"TILT","address":"1355 NW Everett St, Ste 120","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Huge lines, but this place is engineered to make it work.

So when I saw this place was the highest rated downtown food truck on Yelp (5 stars! That's unheard of in my neck of the woods!) and only a couple of blocks from my hotel, I couldn't contain my excitement. I pored over the reviews and pics in preparation. I wandered by around lunchtime, and as the reviewers warned, there was a crowd, so I stopped back at my hotel and came back a little later. With no line and just a handful of people waiting for their orders, I knew based on the reviews that I'd still have a bit of a wait. But I didn't imagine it would take thirty minutes. Even the guy ahead of me kept looking around as if he was considering just walking away. I mean, I barely know how to boil a pot of water, but I can make stir fry in less than thirty minutes at home. And I think it would taste better than this. \\n\\nI ordered the pan-fried noodles with the chicken curry, and...it was edible. And there was a lot of it. But that's about all I can say. It was kind of like a curry-spiced noodle version of the fried rice you get at a Chinese restaurant. Fine as a side, but not really the main attraction. Every bite tasted the same, there was no nuance or variance of flavor, and the flavor it had wasn't very interesting. With every forkful I hoped it might get better, or at least different, but even the chicken tasted like everything else. If it wasn't for the change in texture, I would have thought it was just more noodles. For something that was clearly made fresh on the spot, it tasted sort of like all the individual ingredients had been sitting around together all day, you know? The cilantro chutney added a nice, much-needed freshness, but even that was boring after a few bites.\\n\\nI will say, the service was great, even with the wait. The guy who took my order stopped me when I considered adding a shyamosa, telling me it would be way too much food.

I went with a party of five, including two Feng Shui connoisseurs who were visiting the restaurant for the third time in the past week. The following represents the group's take on our dining experience.\\n\\nThings we liked:\\n- As soon as we entered, we were greeted by multiple friendly staffers, which made us feel welcome and set the tone for the rest of the evening.\\n- From the speakers flowed classic 90s hits put to piano music, which was relaxing and sparked more than one sing-a-long. These ballads of beauty (as one group member described them) included Celine Dion's \\"My Heart Will Go On,\\" Cyndi Lauper's \\"Time After Time,\\" Bryan Adams's \\"Everything I Do,\\" and many, many more.\\n- The scorpion bowl was generous, fruity, and delicious, and the center of the bowl contained a half-shot of Bacardi 151. One party member deftly demonstrated how he collects the 151 into the long straw, then redistributes it throughout the potent punch for maximum enjoyment.\\n- The crab rangoons are exceptional! They're now my ranking #2 favorite (behind Beijing Cafe in Boston). They were hot and crispy, contained the perfect amount of filling, and full of crab flavor without too much cream cheese. One party member said she could eat Feng Shui's crab rangoons for the rest of her life; in fact, they would be her Last Supper. Paired with the delicious duck sauce and plenty of spicy mustard, they just tasted great, plain and simple.\\n- Our server graciously accommodated special requests; for example, we asked to substitute cucumber for avocado in our Philadelphia maki (an excellent decision).\\n- The sushi arrived in a wooden ship, which is a must-have when I dine on sushi. \\n- There was a generous mountain of wasabi on the ship, so no one had to ration themselves.\\n- The sushi was light on rice, which is a good thing! Other places load up the rice to compensate for tiny pieces of fish, but not Feng Shui.\\n- The sushi itself was excellent. It exceeded expectations on all counts. The tuna had a beautiful, deep purple color, with no stringy membrane stuff. We ordered the spicy tuna roll, spicy salmon roll, shrimp tempura roll, spicy yellowtail roll, una-avo roll (eel and avocado), crazy maki, california roll, tuna and avocado, and Philadelphia roll. We agreed that the crazy maki (shrimp tempura, avocado, and spicy mayo) is the best value at $7.50.\\n- Feng Shui is offering a $15 for $30 Groupon, of which my earlier-mentioned dining companions have been taking full advantage.\\n\\nThings that could use improvement:\\n- I felt the miso soup was mediocre. It tasted fishy. It was also served in a porcelain bowl with a metal spoon rather than the traditional bowl with the plastic spoon that is customary at Japanese restaurants.\\n- Some party members lamented that there was excessive cucumber wherever cucumber was served.\\n- Feng Shui's ginger is white, while I prefer pink ginger.\\n- We splurged on the Kiss the Fire maki from the specialty side of the menu, and we all agreed that it was not worth the price. The raw jalapeno was a bit much for some, and the flavors didn't meld well. For $14, I expected much better. The presentation was lovely, though.\\n\\nTHE SCORES: My party scored the overall experience as follows.\\n- W: 4.2/5\\n- A: 4.7/5\\n- P: 5/5 (in terms of the sushi experience)\\n- RAT: An \\"I Can't Wait to Come Back\\" 4/5\\n- Me: 4.2/5\\n\\nAll in all, Feng Shui proved itself to be the dark horse, the ace in the hole, the unexpected Cohasset sushi gem that I will certainly frequent in the future! In fact, I believe we'll go again next week :)"},{"name":"Broad Street Riot","address":"131 Broad St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"This place is great.

I think after the second sub which was a Hot Capicola, I am ready to declare them \\"as good as it gets!\\"\\n\\nThe first sub take-away was a regular SouthSide Authentic Italian Gourmet. That beast had some meat on it. My first impression from reading the menu was \\"damn, that's expensive for a sandwich,\\" but when you get it you see where your money is going. There is SO MUCH meat it's crazy. So much GOOD meat it's insanity! There were 3 wrappings of sliced Italian meats (some may have been capicola that we will discuss later) that went onto the sub. The veggies were wrapped tightly in the various types of ham. I think there may have even been a layer on the bottom. If you love deli meat, then the Gourmet is for you. All the meat is freshly sliced. Ah . . . I remember the days 20 years ago when Subway did that. \\n\\nNow I enjoyed the sub immensely, but I also felt that ALL THAT meat just over-powered the veggies. Just a personal pref. I am probably the only guy at sub shops that asks for extra lettuce. I just love the way the oil and vinegar soak into the lettuce. \\n\\nNext time if I am in the mood for a sub with all the veggies, I will just have them custom make a sub for me with a bit less meat. Instructions are on the board for that as well.\\n\\nThat out of the way, the Hot Capicola seems to be where it's at here. The owner's enthusiasm in introducing this sandwich to me was infectious! I wasn't sure how to pronounce it, so he demonstrated by rolling it off his tongue with a fake Italian accent. You can practice this at home, kids, and really impress him when you walk in!\\n\\nThe owner is quite proud of this sub and rightfully so. We discussed the hams/meats in the Italian Gourmet sub I'd had previously and then the Hot Capicola. Nobody else he knows of  in Austin is serving up these types of ham!  \\n\\nNow boys and girls, are you ready to learn something? I didn't know anything about capicola so I went to Wikipedia. If you want to get technical, capicola isn't actually ham according to them.\\n\\n\\"  . . . the technical definition of ham is the thigh and buttocks of a pig (or boar) slaughtered for meat, whereas capicola is solely meat from the shoulder or neck.\\"\\n\\nSo what's a Hot Capicola sub you ask? Think cheeseteak (yes they have those too!) but with ham er . . . capicola! It's fried up like cheesesteak but with onions, tomatoes, cherry peppers and cheese. Then some vinegar is added to it. You can smell the deliciousness as they bring it from the grill to wrap it up in front of you. When you bite into it, the capicola practically melts in your mouth. \\n\\nRun, don't walk to Tucci's and try one of these bad boys out. And use the accent! \\n\\nThe wife liked it, but she is ready for me to bring her a Tucci's cheesesteak next time. So that's on the list! Being close to our new neighborhood I see years and years of visits to Tucci's in our future!\\n\\nEDIT 2-2-10: Stopped in for a cheesesteak with all three types of peppers. Absolutely delicious just as I expected. The wife loved it too. Now the real point of this review was to add Tucci's to my HFCS free soda list. They have Dublin DP in the cooler.

Jim quickly determined that his sweet and sour chicken was the best he'd ever had the chicken was perfectly cooked, moist and tender.  I on the other hand was a bit surprised that the sauce on my General Tso's was a brown sauce, usually the sauce is more red.  One bite and I was hooked.  They use a brown sauce that is not as sweet as the red but is absolutely delicious.  The egg rolls were some of the best I've ever eaten.

Raised booths with red seating and some sparkles.  Nice!  If you've ever been to Nickels Diner in Montreal, a local chain owned by (yes its true) Celine Dion, you'll find it to be very similar.  \\nHard to imagine her sitting down to a beefy burger and a side of 2 pound chocolate cake, but I was taught never to judge a book by its cover.  I still do, but yeah.. I DIGRESS\\n\\nAdmittedly, I end up here on semi-sunny days when I feel like getting out of the office and taking a short walk up to Central Square.  Typically I am prepared to be underwhelmed, but always end up pleasantly surprised.  I've had a few different plates here, and have only dined in once.\\n\\nI've tried the pancakes with home fries, and out of everything, that's probably been my least favorite.  The pancakes were a bit, (cough) dry and required extra syrup.  Some people would delight in this, but I am not an extra syrup kind of gal.'  The home fries were standard.. nothing to write home about.  They weren't over seasoned and probably could have benefited from some additional salt/pepper which I could have added myself.  But I wasn't watching copious amounts of FoodTV or Chopped at that point, so how the heck would I have known?  I am just a pedestrian dinner-outer who doesn't dare delve into Charcuterie with hearts/liver or pate.  \\n\\nSecond offering:  Southwestern Salad with black bean salsa and some sort of chive vegan dressing.  This is delicious.  I imagine it is even better in house, before the dressing has a chance to soak in.  But I love the freshness of the cherry tomatoes (they use an heirloom mix in the summer) greens, salsa and dressing.  It has enough flavor to keep me plowing through the salad when I otherwise would be daydreaming of some sort of carb.\\n\\nToday's offering: The grilled cheese (Vermont Cheddar) and tomato.  WOW.  I think it must be attributed to the way they marinate their tomatoes (they use a plum tomato) but this sandwich is delicious.  Nice crust on the wheat bread and good bite to the cheddar.  It comes with your choice of side...I chose potato salad and some greens.  The greens were dry so I was missing a bit of dressing there, but the potato salad was a nice side.  The sandwich hurled its way above those two sides though.  I can't wait to get another one, once I get over my guilt for wanting another one and the sun returns.  Luckily the forecast calls for some rainy days ahead.....\\n\\nI've been reading through the reviews, and one person mentions the health quotient.  Listen, any restaurant that likens itself to a diner is not going to be like Life Alive.  Sounds like she should have walked another block and a half up and would have felt satisfied.  It is a diner, and diners celebrate Americana and the junk we love to ingest.  \\n\\nFinally, the service.  Everyone I've come into contact there is very nice, and will even (gasp!) dare to make conversation with you whilst you wait.

For our sides we went with the chipotle mac and cheese (not on the menu), the pickles, 4 buns, potato salad, and a serving of chipotle slaw all totaling around $70.\\n\\nThe beef rib was phenomenal, pulled prok was great, as well as the brisket. Our only wish was that we wished we got a little more fattier cut of brisket. Sides-wise, the mac and the pickles were on point and delicious. \\n\\nWe ended up not finishing everything and remained full for much of the rest of the day. Fast forward to right now...I had some leftover beef rib and 1.5 buns that I forgot about and decided to heat it up in the oven. After that first bite of crisped up, fatty, and smoky goodness, I raised prayer hands in the air and said \\"fxck yeaaaaa\\" out loud while sitting alone in my dining room in Chicago. Best BBQ I've ever had so far, but it made all the difference being eaten at the right temperature."},{"name":"Carmelina's","address":"307 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"This was wonderful food.

For $33 I got three courses (my appetizer and entree alone would have been $45).  To start I had oysters florentine, delicious! It had this crazy seaweed on the plate.  I asked the waiter what it was and he didn't know so he said he'd ask the chef and he actually did.  Second course was the best cod I've ever had in my life on top of scrumptious potatoes.  3rd course was dessert, an amazing peach dish with some type of fluffy pastry surrounding it.  The atmosphere is charming and sophisticated.  The wait staff is outstanding.  \\n\\nNow for the flaws: When we entered the restaurant my fiance grabbed the railing outside and got tar on his hands, wierd!  We then waited over a half hour for a 7pm reservation.  We got drinks at the bar but the bartender didn't give us a bill and the hostess said they would transfer them to the table, but that didn't happen.

I did get a regular burger. It took them about 20 minutes to get that burger to me. That's a little surprising considering bigger places get food faster but no worries. I've decided that maybe was a really good burger. Well let me tell you that it wasn't. The burger was wet, the bread especially. The lettuce was very wet as well and I suspect-that the wetness from the lettuce made the bread very soggy. The flavors were very poor and I did not like it. I really think they need to work on the burger. The two stars are for the service because the lady was working very hard and it was really busy in there and she was nice. The Food is not good. I would not recommend getting a burger from here again. I do not like soggy bread and I do not like wet lettuce in my burger. If you're going to take 20 minutes to make a burger, make it good.

The people here don't wear uniforms or aprons or name tags or anything so you basically guess who works there and who is just a random stranger, so that's a little awkward. Anyway we went to the bar to get a drink. The bartender seemed to have a really bad attitude and went off about how his manager was \\"breathing down his neck\\" or something. K dude.. so we got a margarita and a cucumber mint drink.  They were both good but it kinda grossed me out that the bartenders were sticking their hands in a huge vat of cucumbers and pulling them out. Tongs much? About 10 minutes after we got our drinks we were seated. This place is entirely outdoors and the ambience is nice and casual assuming it's not totally hot or rainy. Our waitress came and we ordered appetizers- crispy green beans and mussels. We were planning on a relaxing evening, no rush at all so we didn't mind when it took a while for this stuff to come. The green beans were good but they were served in a paper container which made it feel less special and *so* not eco-friendly. Haha anyway the mussels were fine as well. After we ate that we're looking for our waitress because we don't have drinks and we want to order entrees. She finally graces us with her presence and we order more stuff (drinks, pasta special & grilled cheese). About 30 minutes later she comes back and asks if we still want our drinks... Umm YES that's why we ordered them. 10 minutes later they come. 10 more minutes later she comes back to inform us that the pasta special isn't available anymore... So we are like whatever and order the chicken instead. It finally came and the food was just alright. The chicken was dry, the grilled cheese wasn't special enough to be $7. The french fries were good. Next time we see our waitress we decide to order the s'more because it's fun and it's only $3. When it comes it looks pretty sad and we start eating it confused as to why it's so gross and salty. There's no marshmallow.. I checked the menu and it said \\"lardo.\\" So we just ate a lard s'more. It was seriously disgusting and a bad greasy taste to the longest most mediocre meal I've had in Austin in a while.

Brisket was delish! juicy, flavorful and moist.

I heard you could order online 3 days before and pick it up so that is what I did on a weekday at 11:30. Still had a little wait.

Sausage is spicy peppery, not fatty. good. Pulled pork, okay. The buns they use are really fresh and light, perfect combo with meat.  Now the Cons! the Wait, the wait, the waiting in line. Watched them take like 8 minutes with one order at the window!!! Whaaaat?? While I was waiting, my brain was churning out ideas: Why don't they speed up the process? I mean, they are probably making good money with all the customers. Make some menu cards, give one to each customer in line. Have a few staff take the orders and run them back to the Preparation line. Keep two staff filling the orders inside. How difficult could that be? Really? Any well run business could have figured this out. You prepare for the demand!  Franklin BBQ take note as well. People would be coming in droves if they could cut the wait time. More sales, more money, they could open a brick and mortar restaurant, or at the least hire more staff. I suppose they equate the wait with, if you don't have to wait, its not good bbq :(("},{"name":"Taco Bell","address":"1170 Columbia Drive","city":"Decatur","stars":"1.5","text":"Not open on time or even relatively near on time.

We had two different recommendations, should have picked the second. We waited 25 minutes, which isn't awful, I do it at home all the time at some of my favorite spots, because it's worth it.  This one wasn't.  Tons of other places equally priced that in the neighborhood, probably better.  Our waitress was stressed out. The man behind had an issue because the cook prepared the wrong dish.  Not sure what happened there but it appears that he had waited until eating some of it (maybe he didn't realize) and the restaurant was making it right.  In any case she was flustered. The food came quickly after ordering.  I have three teenagers.  My daughter ordered pesto with tortellini, she felt my sauce was \\"more flavorful\\" and my boys agreed. I do make it with fresh ingredients.  She ordered the homemade pasta, but it didn't taste much different than the frozen stuff.  They have a reputation for large portions so I ordered a shrimp cocktail and opted to share shrimp and scallops in wine butter and garlic sauce.  I asked  to have olive oil instead of butter, no problem. The shrimp cocktail was cooked properly but the shrimp didn't taste super fresh an weren't jumbo size. They were fine.  I will say we all agreed that the shrimp and scallops were in a tasty sauce though it had tons of oil hanging out on the bottom of the plate. The scallops were fresh and the veggies were good.  My son had veal and chicken in a marinara sauce, he was happy with and did have some left overs.  My other son had fettuccine Alfredo.   This was the first time we ever had that made with ricotta, usually its more creamy with a bit of Parmesan or Romano.  So this was unusual, it was okay.  For Italian they seem to shy away from garlic, weird.  I will say the bread was served nicely with Parmesan garlic and olive oil dipping sauce. When we asked for more we only got the bread and we had to ask three times.  Definitely not \\"family style\\" dining.  Portions were not huge, they were fair.  Not sure if this area maybe tends to generally have small portions and comparison these are large?  Certainly not any bigger than what we have a the local Italian places at home.

Last weekend we got there right as they were closing to prepare for dinner so we made it a point to get there earlier yesterday.  At first all was good.  We liked the space and the server-despite him not introducing himself and clarifying his role as our server-was initially friendly and helpful.  However, after he took our order everything went downhill from there.  We waited way too long for the meal to arrive, noticing nearby tables who had sat down after us were getting their food first.  When the food was delivered to the table by someone other than our server he never came over to update me on my side order.  I will assume they had run out since it was never brought to me.  In fact, he NEVER came to the table again.  EVER.  My husband took one bite of his meal and told me it was disgusting but he thought he could salvage it at least a little by \\"doctoring it up\\".  We wanted to request salt, pepper (mysteriously not on any of the tables) and hot sauce but again, our server never once returned to our table-not to see if we wanted another drink (a lost opportunity to upsell-we wanted to order two coffees and possibly two more cocktails), not to refresh our water, not to ask how the meal was... There was one girl who apparently gets paid to stand at the back of the room and stare aimlessly out the window.  When her eyes darted away to the window to us (by this time we were discussing talking to the manager) she exited the room.  Heaven forbid she actually do Something like approach a table and ask how she could help.  My husband finally did go to talk to the manager, letting him know we understood every once in a while you're gonna get a bad plate of food.  No big deal.  BUT what was a big deal was being ignored throughout the meal at a place set up and priced the way it is.  This is not the corner diner and our experience was inexcusable.  We have never needed to talk to a manager before this.  The manager took my husband's order off the bill and came over to refill our water but by then we just wanted to get out of there as soon as possible.  I was debating whether or not to tell the two tables on either side of us who had just sat down to get up and run.  And I was tempted to write a letter to D2 Restaurants LLC to alert them that some MAJOR training and protocol needs to be put in place before this whole venture goes belly up.  By the way, the manager and the server never apologized for our experience.  Needless to say there are too many great places to eat and drink in the area, so we will not be back."},{"name":"Ray's Deli & More","address":"6101 S Orange Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Always drove past this place and never saw it. Little market shop and in the back there's a tiny deli. Good breakfast. I've had the bacon, egg and cheese sandwich. Not to bad, but their empanadas, the beef to be exact. Now those were really good!"},{"name":"American Cut Steakhouse","address":"3035 Peachtree Rd NE, Ste 140","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Mit took great care of us. Walking into the restaurant and being greeted by a group of beautiful ladies was a plus. All of the hosts were gracious and accommodating.
