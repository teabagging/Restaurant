I was so excited to cruise here after work, but after 30 minutes of sitting in traffic on 5th (accident), driving around for 10 minutes in loops looking for it (my bad), and then spending 20 minutes looking for parking (construction and just dt in general), well let's just say it took the wind out of my sails. So I was ready to be brought back to life with tasty meaty goodness. Unfortunately, BR BBQ did not live up to my expectation. Poo. \\n\\nI ordered a pound of brisket to go (you can't order any less) for $12. I was impressed by how much meat that really is (then again I'm not in the habit of ordering my dinner by weight) and the gentleman cutting seemed to err on the side of slightly over a pound rather than under. Well done sir. I chatted with the manager while I waited - a nice guy who just moved here from San Antonio to manage the place - and he hooked me up with free fruit salad and banana pudding. They make everything fresh each day and since it was near close he was basically just handing em out to get rid of them. Lucky me! \\n\\nWhen I got home I dug right in. The brisket was flavorful, but a bit on the dry side for my liking. I also like it pretty fatty and juicy, but this just may depend on where you cut it from? The sauce was really thin which I 'm not fan of either - you could dip a piece in there, but you'd better have the sauce container right under your chin, otherwise it will run off by the time it gets to your mouth = not cool. It had a nice flavor, but a little sweet for me. Luckily my meat came with loads of pickles and jalapenos so I could spice it up. I was thinking an entire pulled pork sandwich slathered in sauce might be nauseatingly sweet...but ya know, it might be nice to load up that number with onion, pickles and jalapenos and they would play off one another. Hmm. I may return to give that a shot since I really really want there to be a go-to BBQ near my house. \\n\\nThe fruit salad was the kind with those tiny pink and green marshmallows in it, so I passed on principal. (Who decided to make them green? When they get wet they leave their sticky fungi-looking-goo all over the fruit. Disgusting.) I was about to slam the bread pudding, but just now read it's BANANA pudding, which makes way more sense! It was the first thing I dug into when I got to my car and was so disappointed and confused. It comes in a little bowl and honestly does not look all that appealing: it's basically a mess of pieces of bananas, vanilla pudding, and cool whip. Made fresh, and tasty I'm sure if you are into that sort of thing, but I just dug out a few pieces of banana in my bewilderment. \\n\\nWhile it's not the best BBQ I've ever had, it's priced right, and you get all the goodies included (either with a meat order, or lunch plate, or a family pack, etc).

Yes, that is what this place is amazing for. Stumbled upon this place this morning when looking for a place to have a good hearty breakfast near St. David's in north Austin.

Bacon had a great smokey flavor, eggs were cooked to order, pancakes were delicious, and hashbrowns were crisp and had a perfect amount of onion in them to give them a little more flavor.\\n\\nThis place also goes as a coffee shop, so the diner coffee was A+ grade, not the cheap watered down stuff. And the refills kept-a-flowin.\\n\\nService was super friendly and the atmosphere quaint, as if you were in a diner way outside of town and not in a random strip mall off of metric. I felt as though we were well attended to, frequent status checks by the waitress, but not to many, and a \\"warm-up\\" on the Jo whenever it appeared to be half empty.\\n\\nPortions were perfect for 1 person who wants a full breakfast for under $7, but perfect to split if you don't want to be put into a food comma.

The rice pilaf and carrots were very undercooked. Chicken tenders, steak tips, mashed potatoes, and blackened caprese chicken sandwich were delicious. Really, really good. It's hard to give an accurate overall review because our experience was so different across the board. The prices are fair assuming the meals are served correctly.

A number of times for dinner and one time for drinks.  I'm happy to say I've found the food isn't that bad  (although I usually get the fish and chips - I have enough self preservation not to keep a fryolator at home).  The first few time or two we went the onion rings were sadly tasteless, but I kept forgetting and ordering them again.  The third time my forgetfulness paid off - they changed the batter and it was good.   My fiance has ordered a soup twice (once pumpkin and once carrot IIRC) and they were both tasty.  She ordered a risotto once which was okay, but she said the taste and consistency wasn't a risotto.  The kids have ordered chicken fingers and pasta before which were fine.  Chicken was moist and tender enough that they didn't complain.  One of them ordered a fish once which tasted good but was so heavy with butter that he only ate a very small portion.  I thought he was being difficult until I started eating his leftovers (because I'm a fish loving pig) and I only got halfway through when the heaviness set in.  Yeh, we took the rest home.\\nThe decor itself is nice - it's clean, and in the summer you can open the large windows for a nice airy feel.  It's a nice pub environment, although a bit hard to travel through on weekend nights.  We discovered this once, when we decided to check out what seems to be the only nightlife in Winchester.  It's like those shows on Discovery Channel when the water dries up and all the animals have to drink from the same shrinking watering hole.  Everyone's packed in just wanting a lil something to drink.  But the bartender's friendly, and since we were content to find  our own little personal space and not wait for a seat it was fine.  \\nActually, in all our times going the wait staff was always nice, if not always good at checking back consistently.  Not to say they were awful, just not exemplary.  We give that 3 stars.  They have always been friendly to the kids when we brought them, and scavenged up some blank paper and crayons for the kids to draw.  \\nOverall not going to wow the foodie in me but I'm pretty spoiled in that department, and it's a decent place to hit with the kids or a drink.  In a land devoid of pubs, the bar is low and yet this place is still pretty good.

Pretty simple. \\n\\nThe salad roll is more \\"home style\\" than the kind you get at a restaurant. What I mean by this is that the roll wasn't rolled very tightly and is more moist and the filling is a little different. The roll had shredded ice berg lettuce, carrots, shredded cucumber, vermicelli noodles, and cilantro with your choice of meat. The roll was a little loose and hard to dip into the peanut sauce but I was able to pour it on after each bite and it worked out. I like the peanut sauce because it wasn't thick and not too sugary either.  \\n\\nI felt weird just ordering rolls for $3.75 (you get 2 rolls over order) so I ordered the milk bubble tea as well. These two items put me out $7.70-- which is not bad. \\n\\nI didn't specify how I wanted my tea (blended like a smoothie or over ice) and it came out blended. I liked it!

Of late though I've been making an active effort to remember mine, and this weekend I remembered two. Yesterday it was just me saving the world from a Roomba run amuck, a 4010 model which was angry at being supplanted by the 500 series. This morning though I had a really good dream, where I saved a planet of crab people from their alien oppressors... unfortunately I had to sacrifice one of them to do it, taking off its shell and cracking its body in half - when it shuffled off this mortal coil it released an energy blast that destroyed the invaders and returned me to my dinner party.\\n\\nThat last dream sort of made me crave seafood, and though the whips and scorns of time have removed many memories from my mind, that dread of another unpromising meal at Truluck's led me to Joe's Crab shack instead - yes, I know it's a non-local chain, but in this case conscience did not make a coward of me.\\n\\nThe appetizers made me regret my choice - we started with the crab stuffed mushrooms and garlic mussels. The mushrooms were tasty, but were mostly breading and celery with a hint of crab. The mussels were good but much too salty.\\n\\nThe entree, though, led me to forget the thousand natural shocks that flesh is heir to. We had Joe's classic steampot for two - Dungeness crab, Alaskan Snow crab, boiled shrimp, boiled sausage, potatoes and corn. Ah, the eating of crab with bare hands, bibs on, is truly an enterprise of great pith and moment, something one should do frequently.\\n\\nThe decor is tacky by design. The service was decent, although the routine they did seemed somewhat lackluster; I've seen lively and inspired performances by the servers at Joe's in the past, but this was not one of them.\\n\\nAll in all, not a bad place to go if you're craving some down and dirty eating."},{"name":"The Original Dinerant","address":"300 SW 6th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I went here three times in three days while at a conference in Portland.\\n\\nMy first visit, I struggled as to whether it was going to turn out to be a place I liked, but the food was so overwhelmingly delicious that it won me over.

That was decidedly not the case this time. My family and I were celebrating our oldest daughter's 17th birthday and Hawkers was where she wanted to eat. They don't take reservations and the wait gets long very quickly, so we got there fairly early... about 6:25pm. There were a number of open tables and we were seated immediately. So far, so good. A waiter came by with menus and we ordered a few dishes before even looking at them, just to get the ball rolling. Of the 3 dishes we ordered, the first came out in about 10 minutes... a bit long considering two of the dishes were curried mashed potatoes, and that wasn't even the dish that came out first. We had to remind the waiter about them. He brought the potatoes out 10 minutes after that, at which point we ordered another 6 or 7 dishes. It's now about 6:45. At 7:05, the waiter asked how we were doing, to which I responded \\"we're hungry\\", since the 3 small dishes we'd been served were long gone - There were 5 of us at the table. At 7:15 I asked to speak with a manager, since we'd been watching other parties get seated and served multiple dishes while we sat at a table with no food. The manager said that the waiter had forgotten to put our order in and she was sorry. She'd get us our food as quickly as she could. The manager brought over a few dishes herself 10 minutes later... We'd been there for an hour at this point. By 7:35 we finally had everything we ordered, but the Satay chicken skewers contained a few chunks of charred but raw chicken. Not good. Our waiter never apologized or acknowledged his mistake. The manager never offered us a refund, a discount or anything. I was truly disappointed in a restaurant that I had always enjoyed.

We are pretty damn certain it was due to the ingestion of one single wing at Cheyenne Grille. Yes, it is a dangerous sport, my friends, eating food at the \\"New Menu, Improved Management and Service\\" place that Cheyenne Grille purports itself to be.\\n\\nYou know those stupid looking rubber toy chickens that are I guess what you'd call \\"gag gifts\\" or the like? The wings we ordered that were supposed to be lemon-pepper, extra crispy were the texture of one of those. Or of tire. Either way, they sucked. Our server actually used the word \\"re-drop\\" to describe what the kitchen was doing to them when he came over to tell us it would just be another minute (after far too long of a wait already) - which is when we should have known there would be a, ahem, problem with our order - then once we* tried them and just could NOT bring ourselves to eat them, both he and the manager tried to tell us that no, no, no, they make all their wings *fresh* each order . . . Um, as The Boy said \\"#fail-apostrophe, wait I mean, #fail-exclamation mark!!!\\" Exactly. \\n\\n(*\\"We\\" didn't actually try the wings - he tasted one, managing to swallow all of it just to make totally sure we were not overreacting. I took one look at the plate as our server sat it down and based on their color being somewhere between dark chocolate and shoe sole, didn't feel the need to try them myself.)\\n\\nWhat could be worse than chicken-wings-of-rubber? Glad you asked. The answer to that million-dollar-question would be Blue Cheese Water. Whatever is that, you wonder? Well, color me surprised, but I didn't know blue cheese could ever be That Horrible. I gamely tried the celery and sauce while the boy was sampling the foul fowl and the only way to describe the little sauce cup of yuckiness is that it was like they took a ramekin of blue cheese dressing (made there or bought, really doesn't matter) and thinned it until you could barely tell what it was and could only assume it was supposed to be blue cheese because that's what was supposed to come with the wings. Mad nasty, so much so I'm still a little queasy.\\n\\nThe only thing that was remotely good were the fries, although we weren't really interested in eating them and, truthfully, I thought they tasted like someone had driven to Wendy's and bought them and dumped them in a basket for us - but that seems insulting to Wendy's. They went back along with everything else.\\n\\nThe manager was nice enough but seemed completely flummoxed that we thought the food was inedible. He basically kept repeating \\"Really? You don't like them?\\" when a glance at the wings should have been enough to tell him there was something rotten in the state of Denmark. *Le Sigh*\\n\\nWe found out later that a couple friends of ours got food poisoning there since the ownership, etc changeover. Musta been the wings . . ."},{"name":"Deschutes Brewery Portland Public House","address":"210 NW 11th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"This is a very busy, hip, fun, and tasty brewery.

Based on the previous good reviews, I was expecting better.  \\n\\nPros:  Appearance and quantity of food.  I got the dolsot bibimbap and I was suitably impressed when it arrived.  If you like food porn, this does not disappoint.  I also have to point out that the dishes they use were hand crafted and glazed.  Whoever selected and designed the ceramicware did an outstanding job.  I also love the wood tables and benches. Very unique for Richmond and adds well to the atmosphere and ambience.\\n\\nCons:  Taste of the food.  It didn't taste bad, but it didn't taste \\"special\\".  Haroo was better, but Haroo has ridiculous wait times.  \\n\\nI really like korean food, and I'm always looking for the next best thing to jumping on a flight to Incheon and eating at the food markets there.  Samsoonie felt disappointing.  \\n\\nFor example, the kimchee was made in house, but I think it was not fermented long enough for my taste.  The red marinade hadn't fully penetrated into the cabbage.  There wasn't enough umami flavor in the kimchee.  Maybe they should add more garlic and anchovies to the kimchee.  Not sure.  \\n\\nThe potatoe banchai looked beautiful.  The corn syrup glaze made it look enticing.  Biting into a few though, I got a piece that was undercooked and still crunchy.  Most of the other pieces were cooked through.  I'm not sure if the potatoes were soaked in cold water before being boiled.  The texture wasn't perfect.\\n\\nAs for the bibimbap, they definitely don't put MSG in their food, so unfortunately for me, with my MSG-addled tastebuds, it seemed a little bit on the underseasoned side.  I probably should have asked for some salt or soy sauce.  The condiments looked bright and beautiful but they all tasted kind of similar, so the joy of eating bibimbap where you get different flavors and textures with each bite was kind of lost.  I think they should have added some lightly pickled veggies, dried fernbrake, and maybe some sliced ham, to put in more flavors and textures.  \\n\\nAt the end of the day, I felt like although the restaurant has been opened for a while, it is still going through the early learning/teething stages.  Usually, at these restaurants, they have a signature dish that everyone goes for.  I think their menu is a bit too broad and they could do better to focus on just a few dishes and make them outstanding.

I've have come here a few times over the years and it was phenomenal the first two times i went. the food was outstanding however the last two times i've been here both when the kitchen makeover was just completed and then tonight. I get the Dak Bulgogi usually the chicken was so dry and unseasoned/unflavorful. it was like eating cardboard. The Jalepeno mac and cheese used to be very rich and creamy and tangy and the past two times it just tastes like an under salted bland béchamel sauce without any cheesey flavor. It seems the quality of the product continues to go downhill. Also they seemed to have a staffing issue and it wasn't just tonight. I read the other day other people were having to order their food and beer from the bar instead of being served by wait staff which albeit is great because you won't be seeing a tip but inconvenient to have to get up for beer and ordering food frequently.

It has a nice dark malt taste and a nice creamy finish.\\n\\nWe indulged our appetites in the elk burger and yellow belly burger and added a runny egg on the latter. Both were a party on the palate. I thoroughly enjoyed the yellow belly burger. The pork belly was perfectly braised. The goat cheese on the top bun and jalapeno pesto on the bottom bun really tied everything together nicely. Full of flavor and perfect meat to bun ratio. There was not one ingredient in this burger I would (or wanted) to omit.

We were all so excited to be safely covered with the comfort of fans, great music, incredible company, and what was about to be the best meal any of us have experienced in a very, VERY long time while mother nature went nuts in the background.

If you haven't, you need to and then you need to have the Burger at Canoe).... with a side of the bacon and sweet corn risotto that was the side for the scallop special of the evening.... words don't, and cannot describe the emotions and sensations that went coursing through my body when my glutinous ass slopped some risotto onto the burger and took a massive bite.

The gardens, the pathways, the trees, the LIGHTING.... oh the lighting... it was too good. Way too good. \\n\\n We made our way to the back where a small gate opened to what can only be described as the most seductive dining spot on the planet. A giant picnic style community table beautifully crafted by hand by someone that really took care to put some character into it.

It was good but not great, and it was way too big for 1 person.  I think 3 could eat it.  I wouldn't order it again but wanted something other than baklava.  I'd go back for sure.

I took my boyfriend here yesterday right after work for a Birthday dinner. He had never had hibachi before. It was great, for many reasons:\\n1.) It was pretty slow at the time we were there so we ended up having our own personal hibachi table and cook. \\n2.) The drinks were strong. \\n3.) They squirt sake directly into your mouth at dinner. \\n4.) We had a sushi appetizer (Yoshi Roll) which was amazing. It was extra crunchy. \\n5.) The waitstaff was so nice, I did not announce that we were there for a birthday, the staff figured it out after checking IDs for drinks, as a result they comped a meal as a \\"birthday meal\\" and brought out ice cream with a candle. \\n6.)

There's a reason why the name just doesn't have a good enough reason for us to stop.  Yeah, it didn't sound appetizing!  We have heard it through the grapevines, that they've changed ownership and it still that same Greek/American food like they have in the past - but better.  OK, so here we go, let's stop by once & for all and we be the judge to that!\\n\\nThe second we sat down, I asked if they have hot cocoa, no whipped cream. It was served, just as I like it, and the temperature is drinkable.  That's a plus, right there!  I'm ready to order, their Dinner Special - Red Snapper, sounds good enough for me found on the menu. \\"What kind of vegetable are you having with the Dinner Special?\\"  \\"I don't know, I'll go find out for you.\\"  Minus one point for not knowing in advance.  Shouldn't they let their servers know, what they're serving today, veggies with what, etc?  \\"Corn\\".  \\"On the cob?\\"  That would have been a plus, too. \\"No, just corn.\\"  \\"Fine, I'll have that.\\"  Then I should have asked her, how was the snapper cooked?  Grilled, baked, fried. . . then here comes my server again telling me, \\"the snapper & the cod are gone!:  Minus two points!  The cook should have advised their servers that THEIR  FISH DINNER SPECIAL are sold out and this is ONLY noon?  Shouldn't they have enough to serve somewhere around lunchtime and it's not EVEN DINNER YET?  I don't think they've served more than 3 by lunchtime, but if they're selling their fish too soon, they SHOULD HAVE had more than 3 by noon , but run out of two kinds of fish by noon . when they called it DINNER SPECIAL, that is just not right.  I said 3, as a matter of speaking. Maybe, that's ALL they have?  But they should last @ least 3-4PM.\\n\\nI ordered the Greek Meatballs. They're huge 2 balls, I think they have chopped up spinach inside, but the sauce is a tad salty, but I ate it and it was good over rice. The spinach inside the meatballs, could have made that Italian as well, add grated Parmesan cheese. Whatever! Again, the temperatures of our dish was perfect, but they got cold fast, could it be they were served with cold plates?\\n\\nOur lunch was quick!  We're still eating our salad, but that's OK, they're adding more points now.  I was almost done with my lunch, when she asked me my meal comes with a tapioca pudding and Jell-O, but the tapioca pudding is another plus!  She knew I didn't want whipped cream on my hot cocoa, she should have asked me if I wanted whipped cream on my pudding, so I have to scoop that one out!  I won't deduct for that one.  I'm just being nice!\\n\\nDh's hamburger, if you look @ the photo is floating with oil.  He liked that, but I don't like greasy foods.  So, I won't judge or give points for that, but they get points for fast service!  \\n\\nPhotos of our meals under my profile.\\n\\nHere's a bonus, but it was not their fault. There's this lady customer who just came in with 3 others in her party. She decided to sit on the booth, behind me, instead of eating @ the table of 4 in the middle aisle.  She had the audacity to asked me if she could move her seat farther, because she's fat, those are her words not mine. Before I could answer, I went ahead and pull my seat closer to me, but she continued to push my seat, so she can squeeze herself on her bench seat . . . . until my chest is touching the table, making me uncomfortable, and she asked if I was OK, and I flatly said NO!  Hey, I paid for this table, and having a nice relaxing time enjoying my food, and I have as much right to sit here, even though I'm skinny, just as any 200-300 pounder woman! How dare she!

I admit I have not been in for over 6 months because of the ongoing road contruction, not just on the highway but also the access points near this shopping center. But that is much better now and though the highway is a mess at certain times, there are local routes to use, and we should all try them. It's too good a place to miss.\\n\\nToday, I had the brisket lunch again, which has turned out to be my favorite. It was tempting to try the pork belly, but a little less fat is probably good for me. I love that the customer can select the meat portion size, it is weighed and you pay for just what you get. And you can pick you choice of sauce. The meat comes with one roll, which did seem a bit smaller than I remembered, but it was fine with me. Additional rolls can be ordered for a very low price. I got the slaw, which I love, as one side and I could not resist getting the peach cobbler side for dessert. Had it been anything but peach, I would not have had dessert for lunch. It could maybe have used a little more peach but the flavor and cobbler topping were so tasty.

Pricey, even by New York City standards, at $90 bucks for 20 ounces yet I would gladly shell it out again. The crisp edges were crunchy yet not burnt. The medium rare was cooked to perfection, red and juicy without it being bloody or undercooked. The meat was as smooth as butter, marbled and tender. The fatty ends melted on the baguette. I almost mistook it for marrow.\\n\\nThe venison ceviche a total winner with hints of citrus and home made chips spicy and tangy. The roasted potatoes were excellent. A simple peasant side dish made to perfection. The portion though way too small and skimpy. The side of green beans put us over the moon laced with chunky well cooked bacon bits and citrus drippings.

If you're allergic to any type of food that isn't easy to recognize in a dish - such as shrimp - then I'd highly advise you to avoid dim sum unless someone speaks Chinese or the place is 100% English.

Food was obviously prepared with care and service was super friendly with Miguel, our server, explaining the specials in English (for us all), Portuguese (for my mom) and Spanish (when his Portuguese faltered) when he found out our table was more like the United Nations. He couldn't speak any Polish, but really, who can besides my husband and his mom??? :D. With his discreet but noticeable ponytail, I'm guessing Miguel is some kind of artist: I can recognize them, you see, I've married one! Anyway, he recommended the special ribeye but my carnivore hubby was in the mood for \\"les poisson\\" and ordered the traditional \\"bouillabaisse\\". I tasted it and agreed: I could swim in that velvety lobster broth! Miguel also recommended the bread pudding - he said he ate some earlier in the day and he could finish ours if we couldn't. Sorry we had to disappoint Miguel but when you're accompanied by \\"sweet teeth\\" instead of \\"sweet tooth\\" folks, you bet there won't be any dessert leftovers. Miguel asked us if it was anyone's birthday and I told him that my mom had turned 79 the night before but we had already celebrated it - he, however, didn't think it was enough and brought my mom some vanilla ice cream in a decorated plate (candle and all) and we all sang Happy Birthday to her.

Not a steak my hubby said, but \\"très bon\\".\\nFree range roasted chicken - so glad there was a chicken catcher who braved the plains to grab this bird for my mom to eat and lick the bones.\\nBread pudding with Irish cream ice cream - it's got to be good when the word \\"cream\\" appears twice in a dessert.\\n\\nBistro Niko is not just a place one goes for a special occasion - it is a place to be frequented by those who consider themselves special: and if that is not a daily occurrence for you, then you need to work on your self-esteem."},{"name":"Capo Restaurant","address":"443 West Broadway","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Cheese/Salami platter was very nice.

I thought it was a little weird but didn't think much of it.  When my steak came out - it was not even medium-rare, it was just rare.  So, I called the waiter over and asked to send it back.  I hate to do this, but when you are paying so much for a steak, it should be right.  So I said, this isn't medium, it very rare and his reply was, well that's the French way.  Okay.  I get it.  I'm in a French restaurant.  But.  I am in a French restaurant in Atlanta.  Not in France.  Furthermore, isn't the customer always right?  Not what ordered, no need for the attitude.  It took about 15 minutes for the steak to come back out.   My mom was already done with her meal.  It was very frustrating.  We had creme brulee for dessert and that was good.  So that was redeeming at least.

Parking all around,  if you don't know the area,  keep your eyes open there are two additional free parking lots writhin eye view.    Food,  drinks, and service are all good/ great.  Also,  the manager is always running around.... he's never introduced himself... but he  appears to be making sure everyone is having a good experience (which I  like seeing in a restaurant).   However,  one thing that made me rate this as a 4 star  rather than 5 is the noise level.   I May be a bit critical here,  but I simply can't understand why a new place with such an open concept didn't consider hanging noise reducing acoustic panels or something.   The owner/ manager has to notice how you can hear every conversation in the place at once.

It fit the bill for what I was seeking...beer and snacks in a relaxed atmosphere.  I did not walk in looking for someone to swipe the crumbs off between courses and re-fold my napkin when I got up from the seat...this is a beer bar where food happens to be served.\\n\\nPeople seem to be under some strange spell when they enter Bukowskis on a weekend night...it always amazes me when I see it.  They walk up and toss down a credit card, apparently not seeing posted signs that it is cash only.  Angrily they go to the ATM in the back or hoof it to one of the banks on Cambridge Street, it's not like there isn't easy access to cash...and if you don't have the available cash to be going out, perhaps they just saved you.  The next laugh is when people see hundreds of beers available in bottles, the large draft selection; and yet they order a vodka cranberry or some weird cocktail that must be hit of the week downtown.  I urge people to go outside of their comfort zone and let one of the bartenders recommend something...they know a TON about all of the beers there.  Some reviewers have made comments about getting attitude but I think it might be a case of getting what you give.  When people are inquisitive and want information, it can make a world of difference rather than just getting pissed at the person serving because there is no Bud Light on tap.  Being a bystander in these situations has given me a new appreciation for what it's like as a bartender in busy weekend situations.  Crews of people stream through, tip horribly, and then complain because they feel like they didn't get prioritized.  \\n\\nAgain, I might seem prejudiced because I go there often...but I think if it was actually terrible I wouldn't go back.  There are a slew of places in Inman and surrounding squares I could choose but this one just feels comfortable.  The food is not for everyone I guess, but I like it.  You'll find bar standards like nachos, burgers, fries, etc. but also a changing specials menu that features some really unique items.  The chef likes to add in spicy dishes and things with Asian flair, so I'm always willing to try those and have been pleasantly surprised a few times.\\n\\nBukowskis, you have my vote.  I had to take off a star because I still don't like the no credit/debit card thing.  I have pretty much wasted about $1000 worth of ATM surcharges (maybe not that much) because I never carry cash and I'm too lazy or it was too cold/snowy to walk to the Bank of America once I started drinking and realized it.  I know why they do it, but damn it inconveniences me.  \\n\\nAnyone who lives nearby should consider the beer card because you'll learn a ton about beer, and it's fun.  Drinking out of a mug once you finish ups your coolness factor and makes you feel like paying for all those crazy beers along the way was totally worth it.  Living far away would make it tough...nobody wants to get sloshed and commute far for a total 133 beers.  But yeah, beer card.

They really need to put a cap on people they let in- it gets wayyyy too crowded. There's a 90% chance beer will get spilled on you; never wear anything that a beer stain (or worse, the dreaded cranberry spot!) won't easily be rinsed out of. It will also take you 5-10 mins. to reach the bathrooms at the end of the room, depending on where you're standing. Tread wisely. For all of these reasons, I can't justify paying a $5 cover to get in. \\n\\nOther than these two glaring points, the Landsdowne Pub attracts a young, fun crowd. Usually there is dancing, more toward the end of the night. Cover bands are lively and play a nice selection, from old throwbacks to top 40. Drinks aren't too pricy, but it can be quite a wait to get the attention of a bartender/bartendress. \\n\\nOverall, a fun Fenway spot with good music, but unless your primary MO is getting messy and having drink stains all over you, go somewhere else for end of the night/ last call."},{"name":"The Original Dinerant","address":"300 SW 6th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Great food, great atmosphere.

However, was the food divine, decadent, and memorable? No. The flavor profiles were there, but they were not worth the price tag. \\n\\nI ordered the Arancini from their Snack menu. Hot, cheesy, and fried--who could say no? A great start, plus it's vegetarian-friendly (but for you sticklers, it's fried in the same oil as the meat, just FYI). For my appetizer, I ordered the Burrata. This dish was probably the highlight of my meal (a salad? what a shame). The spiciness of the arugula, tartness of the balsamic, and the sweetness of the pickled rhubarb was quite good. Finally, I accepted the recommendation of my waiter and decided on the Black Bass as my entree. The dish certainly looked pretty. And the fish? Well, let's just say it was perfectly cooked--moist and flaky in addition to having a crispy skin exterior. But there my friends, is where it ends. I enjoyed the dish, but it was just a good, light dish. Nothing to go crazy about.\\n\\nMy friend ordered the Creamed Kale + Socca Pancake, and he seemed to thoroughly enjoy it. He was hoping the bread would be crusty and warm, but he commented that it was cold, chewy and bland. Finally, he ordered the Salted Caramel Chocolate Tart, and I stole a couple of bites. While the filling was pretty good, the tart pastry itself was dry and flavorless. If you want dessert in downtown Decatur, I recommend Leon's just down the block. Their chocolate tart was rich and heavenly, and you'll manage to save a couple of bucks.\\n\\nService: I had to reschedule reservations originally made at 8:30 PM to 9 PM knowing that my friend would be running late. The hostess was cordial and accommodating. Many of the previous reviews mentioned sour service, and I was a little wary even before entering the establishment. On a positive note, we did have good service, although it could have been fantastic if we didn't have to flag him down a couple of times, with the bartender noticing our movements and calling our waiter over. He also accidentally charged me an extra dollar for bread service, which my friend received; I did not. He apologized, and I took it as an honest mistake. The lady who brought our dessert was emotionless as she quickly left our plate before us. When I said thank you, she obviously had a forced smile; thank goodness she was not our waitress. Another gentleman (very cute, if I may add) brought me my appetizer and sang, \\"Here's your Burrata-ta-ta.\\"\\n\\nAmbiance: The restaurant is well-designed with a barrier in the center to divide the dining room into two sections: the traditional restaurant setting and the bar area with booths and small 2-seater tables. I imagine this creates a buffer as the bar area can be pretty loud but was a great place to sit. The waiters and bartenders were all hipster, and the patron dress code consisted pretty much of casual button-downs and jeans. A good and relaxing atmosphere.\\n\\nTo sum up my evening, the dining experience waned with each course, and I left disappointed despite the fact that I had been longing to visit for years."},{"name":"Riviera Bistro","address":"12801 Shops Pkwy, Ste 200","city":"Bee Cave","stars":"4.5","text":"We just arrived in town and drove to the restaurant from the airport after reading very favorable reviews on Yelp.

We had appetizers of calamari, oysters and pimento cheese spread shared between four people.  The oysters were nice, fresh, super cold and dressed with what we think was a pickled radish and caviar.  Could have done without the pickled item as it was slightly overpowering to the oyster itself.  Many would think that was great but I'm a fan of less is more with oysters.  Calamari was great, tender and had a great sauce.   The pimento cheese spread was quite well done but they were a little skimpy on the bread and it took over thirty minutes to get extra toast which was a bit disappointing. Three of the four of us had the steak Frites, cooked medium, with the chimichuri sauce and all thought their dinners were delicious.  I tried the French Dip, the portion was generous and the horseradish spread is fantastic.

So, instead of a charge of $87/$97 +tip, I had those charges PLUS $260 showing on my account for the rest of my vacation.  Eventually the voided charges were removed, but I still did not have use of those funds while away.  \\n\\nSo, Kemron, if you open a private practice or go to another salon, I would be happy to patronize your business.

My boyfriend always gets the burrito (signature style) with spicy chicken and/or their chicken wings and loves both.\\n\\nAnother plus is the Maine Root beverages. I got hooked on these as they're also on tap where I work, and tbh I think their Cola is better than Coca-Cola, even the Mexican Coke.

While the food was certainly great (pretzels, pear/gorgonzola grilled cheese), the drinks were almost all lacking and the waitresses were not as helpful (took lots of finagling to arrive upon a decision that was ultimately disappointing, and I said almost the exact same descriptors of likes/dislikes as I did last time).\\n\\nI think the main issue with 2 out of 3 of my drinks was that the bartender that evening was VERY, VERY heavy handed on the bitters. The first drink (a strawberry/champagne concoction, if I remember) was just straight-up medicinal in that way. I managed to wash it down using my water/my boyfriend's drink as chasers. The 2nd drink was a favorite I had last time, the Grand Bohemian, which I happily drank to wash down the first drink's flavor. The last drink, which I also had last time, was the bicyclette. So, SO bitter, to the point where I drank about 1/3 of it and decided I would rather leave than try another drink. It definitely wasn't like that last time! I know bicyclettes are like...half Campari, but nevertheless. My boyfriend's Jack Rose was comparatively good compared to my 2 misses, and I don't normally like Jack Roses.\\n\\nPerhaps my personal taste and one of the bartender's personal tastes differs vastly.

My friends all got something different.  One of my buddies got the buffalo hot dog.  \\n\\nThe one thing that my friend did not expect was that the buffalo meant the sauce on it, not the meat contained within the dog.  Maybe that's his fault, maybe it's the restaurants.. but whatever, this isn't his review. hah\\n\\nAnyways, I did have bite of his buffalo hot dog, and it was not very good.  The portion was huge, and the hot dog was drenched in buffalo sauce so you could barely make out any taste of the meat.  I had the turkey open faced sandwich, and it was good.  It felt like it was thanksgiving all over again with the fixings it came with.  What a great way to start the mid-day with a sandwich that is going to put you to sleep.

I've been here several times and tried various things on their menu and have never been particularly impressed.  It tastes fine, but if you take a particular item - say, the gyro meat - and compare it apples-to-apples to, say, Athenian Grill (which, after reading Lumiere's review, I now realize isn't meant to be the same genre of cuisine, but they do have gyro meat), it just doesn't stack up.  Was that last sentence long and confusing enough for you?  Good.  Back to the food.  The gyro meat here is dry and hardish, the cucumber/yogurt sauce they serve with it isn't thick or garlicky enough for my taste, and the pita bread - oh, the humanity! - dry and thin and just not worth eating.  The hummus isn't bad, but I needed more of it, mostly so I could dip all the dry items on the table into it to give them more flavor and moisture.\\n\\nDuring the day, you order at the counter, but at night, they have table service.  The atmosphere is fine, kind of quirky and relaxed - not a bad place to gather with friends.  I think it's a little on the pricey side for the quality of the food, but at least their portions are pretty big .  Also, it's one of the few places on Congress Ave that has somewhat reasonably-priced entrees (my comment about it being pricey given the quality notwithstanding) and is open at dinner time, so  that's a mark in its favor.

The day of Jennifer at the box office was great; Jackie the manager was really nice about letting us set up the tables early with balloons, center pieces, our own cake and even candles; our waitress, Carolyn, was so sweet, enthusiastic, and very attentive; we had open bar and the bar tender was never impatient with our big group.\\n\\nSecond, the food was good.  Everyone raved about the mashed potatoes, and we had a salad bar, good chicken, fish, and steak options.\\n\\nThird, the atmosphere was really fun!  The music was a really good mix of popular dance party songs that got our group out on the floor, electric slide type group dances with a really good mix of ages, and some classics like \\"Staying Alive\\".  The DJ/ cruise director was really nice, took song requests, and had a good balance between getting everyone dancing but also not being annoying.  We were a big group and they set us up right next to the dance floor so we had lots of room, which was great.

If you like beer and want to eat delicious sausage, this is your place. \\n\\nTheir selection of draft beer is going to fit most anyone's taste buds. The prices are average. The beer was cold and it was fun to try out different types of beer.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is overall fun, but a bit chaotic. If you don't want energetic large crowds that suddenly plop next to you on a bench table, then don't go here. If that kind of thing energizes you, then this is your place. We found people coming up from behind us and plopping down, literally touching shoulder to shoulder with us. If they were packed, it would have been understandable. They were about 30% full and there was a ton of bench room on either side of me, yet a group literally crowded up against me, pressing against my shoulder. It was awkward to say the least. \\n\\nThe tables are simple picnic tables. If you have back or bottom issues, stay away as I found no other options. We sat there about 1 hour and had a nice time, but we got sore butts and backs after a bit. Younger people probably wouldn't care about such things. Getting older isn't for the faint of heart.\\n\\nThe waiter was helpful and explained the menu and options well. \\n\\nThe sausage was really good, excellent actually. I ordered the drunk chicken sausage. I doubt you can go wrong with any selection here. Mine was served in a bun in a hot dog fashion. I suspect most, if not all, are served that way. Recommended.\\n\\nThe one thing that was bad -and it was bad- was the macaroni and cheese. My wife and I love macaroni and cheese. I believe it is hard to screw up macaroni and cheese. Some are better than others, then there is Banger's mac-n-cheese. This goes hands down as the single worst mac-n-cheese we have ever had, bar none. It was creamy, the noodles were noodles, but there was absolutely ZERO cheese flavor. Zero. I mean, we kept saying where is the cheese? There was a cheesy texture, but zero (and I mean absolutely zero) hint of any kind of cheesy taste. If you want a macaroni creamy mixture, this is it. But it is NOT cheese as I understand cheese, no matter what they say. Not recommended. By the way, since my wife doesn't care for sausage, this was going to be her meal. It was inedible and we left it on the table uneaten after a few samples. It wasn't cheap either.\\n\\nI would have rated them higher, but they made a cardinal sin in my estimation. We don't know Austin and this was our first time to this district. We inquired at the front about food, specifically, if they had anything other than sausage. I love sausage, my wife, not so much. We asked about any restaurants in the area. They stated they are the only place serving food other than the food trucks. We found out later this was not true as we walked around the neighborhood. \\n\\nIf chaotic atmospheres with hard benches, good beer and sausage is your thing, then this is your place. Just avoid the creamy macaroni and be ready for sore butts and tired backs."},{"name":"Grindhouse Killer Burgers","address":"6000 N Terminal Pkwy","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"I'm not sure why others have rated this place so low.

But anyways, onto the food.\\n\\nMy friend and I split a chips and queso for an app. The queso was pretty good. Not too salty, rich and cheesy, and though the chips weren't the best chips ever, the app I thought was definitely worth getting.\\n\\nThe sandwich I got was the Orgy half sandwich with chips and a clam chowder in a bread bowl.\\n\\nThe Orgy:  Warm peppered pastrami, swiss, coleslaw, Russian dressing. Served on marble rye. Unfortunately, the sandwich meat was tough. I had to give it a good yank to rip the meat off with the rest of the sandwich. The taste was pretty good, but the toughness killed it for me.\\n\\nClam chowder bread bowl: I love bread bowls. I love mopping up left over sauce or juices with bread. So this was right up my alley. The chowder was interesting because it tasted very herbaceous and had a bit of sweetness to it. Apparently they had changed the recipe a couple weeks back (according to the waitress). Though it wasn't really traditional clam chowder I thought it was pretty good nonetheless.\\n\\nThe chips side: Good chips.\\n\\nPickled veg: Good vinegary taste with some heat that I enjoyed.\\n\\nAll in all I had a pretty good experience here. At this point I'd honestly rate the place a 3.5 due to the mishap with the sandwich, but I think I'll probably get a better sandwich next time I'm here so I'll lean toward the 4-star."},{"name":"Nick's Food To Go","address":"240 Martin Luther King Jr Dr SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Fantastic and authentic Greek food.

It's limp, not dry, and you can tell they hardly used any oil in it.  The potato filling is tasteless.  A good dosa should be crisp with some body to it and have a nice golden red color.  \\n\\nFinally the ambience of the place is terrible.

All of my meals here have been slightly above average, but not mind-blowing. True, the prices are a bit steep for the quality of the food (especially when I think about the fact that the entree prices aren't much lower than those at Meritage, one of Boston's best fine dining restaurants imho).  However, you're also paying for the incredible view. It's worth it, believe me. As for the dishes that I've actually tried--the clam chowder is tasty if you're into bacon, and the short rib empanadas are scrumptious. I enjoyed the mussels, the blackened red fish, and the scallops (though the preparation of the scallops was not particularly inventive).  My husband wasn't crazy about the paella. Hopefully they'll work on the menu, to bring it up to par with the Blue Ox and G Bar.

I have been anxious to try this new iteration of Kells, and this seemed like a good opportunity.  I am sorry we went.\\n\\nWhen we arrived sometime after 2 PM, there were maybe four other tables with patrons.  We were promptly greeted and told to sit anywhere.  We were given menus, asked for drinks and given more time to order.  So far, so good.  \\n\\nLooking at the menu, it looked like it was more for dinner than lunch.  There were four or five sandwiches that looked appropriate for lunch. All the sandwiches were around $10.  The prices were a bit steep, but that's fine, this is Portland after all.  We have great fresh food here.  I don't mind paying more for fresh, good food.  I ordered the Cod & Chips and my wife ordered the BLTC (Bacon, Lettuce, Tomato and Cheddar).  I asked that our fries were cooked \\"well done\\".  (I have ordered fries this way in MANY establishments - it has never been a problem.)  The waitress did not understand what I meant.  I explained that I wanted them cooked a little longer so they would be extra crispy.  She then explained that their steak fries were already crispy, and that wouldn't really be necessary.  FIne.  I didn't want to argue.  I just wanted lunch.\\n\\nFirst my beer arrived.  This was very good, a house made Irish Red.  If I see it elsewhere, I'll have it again.  \\n\\nWhen our food arrives, I asked our waitress for either some BBQ sauce or ranch or something for the dipping.  She said she they had BBQ sauce and some kind or buttermilk dressing that was similar to ranch, and would bring that \\"right out\\".  \\"Right Out\\", as I found out is a codeword meaning \\"10 Minutes\\".  \\n\\nThe food:  My wife's BLTC was on cold toast, with cold bacon, mixed salad greens, tomatoes and a little melted cheddar.  There was a micro splorp of mayo, but it did not make any headway against the overall dryness of the sandwich.  The fries?  Frozen.  WTF?  Come on, Kells, Really?  Frozen F'ing Fries?  Yes, they tossed them in the fryer and they arrived warm - but these things haven't been a potato in a long time.  My Widmer battered cod was overcooked, a little tough and greasy on the bottom. (Why Widmer batter when they make their own?  Not a complaint, but I don't understand.)  The house tarter sauce was good, but the fish was not spectacular. \\n\\nAfter two pieces of fish and half a crappy sandwich, the BBQ and dressing arrived.  Good, but a little late.  My wife had given up after half of the sandwich, so I gave her my fish and I took the sandwich.  My wife took a sip of my beer and her fingers were so greasy from the fish, the glass slipped out of her hands and spilled the rest of the beer, about a third of a glass on the table.  The waitress showed up a moment later BUT NEVER CAME BACK WITH A TOWEL OR RAG, but did ask if I wanted to order another.  We were sitting at Beer Lake.  We sacrificed our napkins to make a dam to keep the pond from reaching our plates.\\n\\nOverall, the food was mediocre at best.  I have had much better food for less money. The service was crap.  If it was busy, I would cut them some slack, but it wasn't.\\n\\nThere are some great choices in this city.

Every time it is the same.  We walk in, ask for a table (look around and notice the place looks empty) and we are asked if we have reservations. We say no, and they leave.  We wonder \\"Do we even need reservations for this place?, Are we just ahead of the dinner crowd?\\" Someone comes up and take us to a table, and leaves.  We sit at our table for like 15-20 minutes before anyone comes up to take our order.  Finally, when we are about to give up and start talking about going elsewhere, someone asks us our drink order. We don't let the person leave, and we give our food order at the same time, because by that time we are desperately hungry! 10 minutes later, they come and turn the grill on, and bring little sides.  These fill us for a few minutes, and we leave little crumbs so we will still have some to enjoy with our actual meals.  THEN after another 5-10 minutes, the food comes, and we don't see the server again till we stalk her for the check at the end of the meal.  Forget getting a refill on your drink, and forget ordering more as your meal moves along. Maybe this isn't what everyone else experiences, but this the service we've gotten, which sucks.\\n\\nThe food is pretty good, though, and the Kaya Sauce marinated Kalbee is quite delicious!

Definitely a very unique in terms of their architecture and layout of the dining area. Since it is an Asian/Hawaiian Fusion restaurant, there are lots of refurbished wood around the walls and for the tables and nice lighting. There is also a graffiti mural which really draws attention and their set up was unique for their type of food.\\n\\nWith a name like Bao Down, it was obvious we had to get baos, 3/5 of us ordered different baos: Vevo 3.0, Bao Chicka Bao Bao, and 2 Worlds Collide for all under $10.

My bao, Vevo 3.0, was vegan and included ingredients such as shiitake mushrooms, avocado, bean sprouts, and arugula.

(maybe a 3 if it were in NY or SF but it is good and one of the better places in ATL)   It certainly wins points for staying consistent throughout the years.  Places such as East Pearl always start off with great dim sum when they open and slowly deteriorate in quality.  I'll definitely be going back to Royal China again.\\n\\nComments on a few of the more popular dishes:\\no Ha Gao - average, nothing to write home about\\no Siu Mai - The taste was fine, but there was some tendon or tougher pieces in the dumpling...a nono for any kind of dumpling\\no Woo Gok (or fried taro with meat): Awesome - these were very fresh and the perfect consistency: crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, and not soggy;  The best I've had in Atlanta.  This is  my favorite dish for dim sum\\no Turnip Cake - fellow foodies said it was good, but I didn't try it that day"},{"name":"Papa John's Pizza","address":"2354 Stringtown Rd","city":"Grove City","stars":"2","text":"Amazing pizza!

The portion is just enough for one person. I thought the food was just A-OK. The sandwich was quite bland. I'm not sure if they forgot to put some sauce on it, but the pork tasted like straight up boiled meat with no seasoning. I also ordered a café con leche, which was delicious, but a bit too sweet. \\nIn addition, it may be because they had just opened, but they seemed to have some confusion about the orders among their staff when we were there. They originally brought me the wrong soup with my sandwich so they had to bring me another one.

When my family moved out west, I was disabused of the idea - chili was about spice, meat, and only then might you think about throwing beans in the pot. \\n\\nTCP is about as old-school as you can get with this idea.  It's housed in a delightfully dive-y, rundown honky-tonk location - the kind of place you can tell has a steady clientele from the graffiti carved into the tables.  Service was very good (though I came at a quiet time so YMMV). \\n\\nAnd wow, is the chili good.\\n\\nFor me, there were two standouts in the 3-bowl sampler I tried.  The mild black bean and Elgin sausage chili was some of the best I've had, with a smoky, meaty taste that didn't rely too much on chili powder or cumin.  On the other hand, the XXX-level house chili was the bigger accomplishment - proving to be very hot (I ended up sweating!) without burning out my tongue so that all I could taste was pain. \\n\\nIronically, the white-bean and pork chili suffered in comparison.  It was good, but nowhere as great as compared to its two older, bolder siblings.  Also, I need to put in a good word for the pork tamales, which were excellent - though I think a native New Mexican would probably call out the green chile for not having Hatch product in it. \\n\\nStill, I'd come back to eat here in a heartbeat.  Parking can be tough, but nowhere as tough as in the 'zone of death' that you'll find around E. Sixth Street. Definitely worth the trip over for some genuine Texas-style comfort food.\\n\\nThis place scores a 5 out of 5 on the 'CTJ Scale', as noted below.\\n\\n5 out of 5 stars: Come-to-Jesus good. Would be OK passing away after finishing a plate here.\\n4 out of 5 stars: Come-to-Mary good. Would be OK being seen eating here by Mother Mary.\\n3 out of 5 stars: Come-to-Joseph good.

I got there late and the rest of my group had already been seated, so I can't speak to the wait time.  They had already ordered a couple of appetizers for the table: steamer clams and the Ale and Chili Cheese Dip.  I can't eat clams, but the rest of my group enjoyed them, and I found the cheese dip to be a fun, flavorful take on a traditional spinach artichoke dip.  The menu claims that the tortilla chips are house-made, but they looked and tasted just like the 'fancy,\\" multicolor chips I can get at the grocery store.\\n\\nMost of my group ordered burgers.  They have some interesting variations on the traditional burger available, and I really love the guide to doneness printed on each menu.  The garlic burger comes with a good dozen cloves of roasted garlic on top and is incredibly impressive, if a little intimidating.  \\n\\nI decided to go a different route, since I already had my eye on another burger in Portland that I was looking forward to the next day.  Instead, I opted for the Obsidian Stout Mac and Cheese, with smoked wild Pacific salmon added for an extra charge.  The menu describes it as \\"Cavatappi Pasta tossed in a Rich Stout Cream Sauce with Grilled Red Onion, Baby Spinach and Sharp White Cheddar Cheese topped with Bread Crumb\\" and I was salivating at the thought of those rich, bold flavors.  Instead, I got a weak, runny, bland sauce over pasta with a smattering of salmon that was so chopped up it might as well have come from a can.\\n\\nEveryone's entrees needed salt.  I traveled with this group for eight days and never once saw anyone pick up a salt shaker, except at Deschutes, where we passed it around the table at least twice.\\n\\nAt this point, I'm sure you're wondering: what about the beer?  Well, the beer was good.  The waitress helped steer us all towards beers that fit our individual preferences.  Not being a beer aficionado, all I can really say is that the beer was good.\\n\\nTo sum up: Nice decor, interesting menu, good beer, underwhelming food, needs salt.

The XXX chili I wrote wasn't that bad last time I went? Well, it got an attitude adjustment. I ordered Freida's Enchiladas with the XXX based on my previous visit. Sure enough - the first couple of bites weren't too bad, but boy did it build up. By the time I got through half of the plate, I was in serious PAIN.

Every time I've been to this place, customers are waiting outside. When you finally do get seated, you have to climb over other customers to get to your table. There is only seating for about 20 people inside the restaurant, and really there should only be seating for about 10 people, but they cram them in like sardines. My mom had to put her butt on some guy's shoulder to slide out of her chair to leave. Plus it was hot as heck waiting outside and hot as heck inside as well because again, you are packed in like sardines. Of course, because it's such tight quarters, the wait staff aren't able to get around as quickly, so the service was not great. So if you want Joy Cafe, I recommend ordering it to go.

The decor for Canoe is amazing, from the bright bold letters outside, to the wood furnishings, even to the menu design: a simple sheet of tan cardstock. Plus, the restaurant sits right on the bank of the Chattahoochee River, so scenery should be spectacular in the day (I came at night). \\n\\nAfter we ordered, we got two bread baskets for our table. It was an assortment of sourdough, olive bread, cranberry nut, and cheddar crisps. I've had my fair share of complimentary bread at restaurants, and these were one of the best I've tried. My favorite was the cranberry nut, it tasted like raisin bread, but the sweetness of the cranberries weren't too overpowering and the bread tasted fantastic with butter. The cheese crisps were interesting, like how other reviewers described it, Cheez-its come first to mind. These crisps were a bit spicy to some people, but overall contrasted nicely with the other selections of bread. Basically just a classy cheez-it. \\n\\nSMOKED SALMON, POTATO CAKE, GOAT CHEESE - $7 (2 cakes)\\nReading the other reviews, I had to get the potato cakes. I've been a huge smoked salmon fan all my life, and thoroughly enjoyed the combination of flavors in this dish. Essentially the base was a crispy potato cake, with goat cheese, and a slice of smoked salmon piled on top. The dish was kind of a twist on your regular salmon, cream cheese,  capers, and bagel. The salmon was really tender and had a lot of umami, the goat cheese tasted a lot like cream cheese while the capers cut through the creaminess of the former. The potato cakes tasted like hashbrowns, and really wrapped the dish together. My only complaint is that there was a bit too much of the goat cheese, and I couldn't really taste the salmon as much as I would've liked to. \\n\\nGEORGIA RABBIT, MUSHROOM TORTELLINI, HOUSE BACON, GARLIC SAUCE - $29\\nI haven't had much experience eating rabbit, so I'm not very qualified to judge this entree. The rabbit was cooked to tender goodness, and kinda had that gamey taste you would have with lamb and venison. The mushroom tortellini didn't taste that special, and the garlic sauce had a little tartness that complimented the richness of the rabbit and bacon. Overall I really liked this dish, but I just wish the serving size for the rabbit was a little larger.\\n\\nI really enjoyed my experience here, and I do hope to come and visit again. It was a bit pricey for a student like me, but I would definitely recommend this restaurant for special occasions like prom for my instance.

If there is one thing a sports-restaurant/bar should be able to nail perfectly - its wings.  Theirs taste like they are cooked in an oven.  The previous time we went, they overcooked the burger.  Again - a simple temperature request on meat is easy to follow.  Once they corrected it - it was just an average burger that I would not order again. Do yourself a favor - save your money.

They seem to do a great job getting people there for trivia/poker events and they have a great outdoor patio.  They have SUCH great potential.

My roommate is a true Brazilian and he praised their bowls. \\n\\nThe bowls are great for a snack or a light lunch. I had the Dream Boat blender which was blueberries, strawberries, acai and vanilla almond milk all blended together. AHH DELICIOUS IN MY MOUTHH. Especially on hot, humid days it's really cooling and filling. Both places were super helpful and patient.

Right in the middle of Rosedale and you don't have to park on the street! Go around the back of the building to park and the entrance faces the parking lot. Walk in, and hope there's an empty table. There's table service and it's very friendly. Or you can sit at the bar. The atmosphere is great. Dark and rich. It can get a little loud though. \\n\\nThe wine list has something for everyone and every budget. They also have a nice beer selection if wine isn't your thing. I think it's all bottles though. I could be wrong. \\n\\nThe appetizers are so good and go well with wine. We had the strawberry goat cheese bruschetta and the spinach and artichoke dip. All that with wine?

I stopped for awhile, then when I was ready to go back, Sweetie refused to.  So it has been a year or two since I had Chipotle.  I satisfied my occasional burrito cravings at Moe's or Hot Heads.\\n\\nYesterday was a fundraising day for the Columbus library- Chipotle donated half your purchase price to CML.  This is probably the closest to us (except campus, and no thanks when the kids are there.)  So, I ran up here to grab lunch and help out.  It is conveniently located near the southeast corner of Easton, near parking lots.  Of course, Easton is crazy no matter when you go.  Weekends are nuts, but a Wednesday at 130pm still had lots of traffic and pedestrians, and parking was tight.\\n\\nThe store is good-sized, and there's a nice patio.  Service was great; several people helped at the counter.  There was a steady stream, but no real wait.  I got Sweetie her usual chicken/rice/mild/cheese burrito, and she liked it.  I had steak with brown rice, black beans, corn salsa, guacamole, and some of their new queso with chips.  The burrito was smaller than I remember, but I could be wrong.  The steak was seasoned and pretty good, a bit tough.  The veggies were fresh and tasty, and the whole thing was a nice combination.  Held together in the foil, fell apart when I took it off.  Oh, well.  The chips are thick, tough enough for dipping.  The queso, a small, was a tiny portion for the money, and was pasty and just not very good.\\n\\nNot bad; a little pricey for the quality and portions.

So we just left our name and went to Aberdeen to kill time. I was suprised at how busy the place was, but again, it was a small restaurant, probably less than 10 tables. We were eventually given a table and the server expressed her appreciation of us waiting on multiple occasions.\\n\\nWe were given the menu and decided on the combo B ($64.95), which came with beef rib eye, G.N. bulgogi, pork galbi, and spicy miso chicken. The combo also came with a choice of seafood pancake or japchae, as well as a bibimbap of your choice (we chose seafood pancake and spicy pork bibimbap). It was difficult to get the servers' attention as they were busy going from table to table and we were seated at the last table on the far side. \\n\\nWe were given four kinds of appetizers (kimchi, potatoes, seaweed salad, and beansprout salad), and a green salad. They gave us a generous amount of each side and they were all very tasty. The BBQ items came and we put them onto the grill one by one. I enjoyed the meats as they were very tender and well marinated. The bibimbap came out smoking hot and it was still sizzling as I was mixing the ingredients together. I was a little disappointed at the seafood pancake because I didn't find much seafood in it, except for small shrimps and scallop pieces. Instead, there was a strong onion and green pepper taste to it. I also thought the pancake was too greasy. \\n\\nOverall, we were very satisfied at the amount of food we ordered. The server came by to refill our water and even offered to bring us another set of appetizers. We truly appreciated that.

It took well over an hour. Again, we took it in stride given that it was Valentine's day. What I wasn't expecting was that they would not even MAKE my meal! The rest of my party got their food and several minutes after everyone else got their meal the waitress said mine would be out shortly. After everyone else had eaten half their meal I asked what was going on. The waitress said she would check and when she came back she said they hadn't even started making it. What?! I was pretty shocked to hear that.  When I asked her why or how this happened the waitress became extremely defensive. She said \\"there are two kitchens! The food doesn't always come out at the same time!\\" I said why would you serve one person's meal before the other person's meal was even made? That makes no sense?!\\" Her next awesome comment was when she told me that \\"most people know that sushi takes longer to prepare and doesn't usually come at the same time as cooked food.\\" (Hand to God...) I ordered a sushi roll, btw. And bear in mind that she had already admitted that they hadn't even started making it (obviously the order was never even placed with the kitchen). The waitress was unbelievably rude and hostile. Not once did she apologize. Not once. And on top of that, she was nasty and belligerent. It was clear that she was pissed off that se was even there. And she was visibly angry that I dared to be disappointed that my meal wasn't made. She asked me, rudely, if I wanted to order something else. Um, no. The rest of my party is almost done eating and I wanted what I ordered. When the bill came I asked if she was going to take anything off the bill.  She said (and I kid you not...) \\"I didn't charge you for the sushi!\\" W.T.F.!! Of course you didn't, I DIDN'T GET IT!!! After talking to the \\"owner\\" she came back with a $15 gift certificate and some more of her awesome attitude for dessert! Oh, and my SIL's steak was cold, like it had been sitting out for a while. She also noticed that a couple who were seated after us received their sushi (hmm....that's odd).

I had arranged via phone to have a group roundtable discussion at The Original based on someone's recommendation, so I went there for lunch two weeks ago to check it out.  I had the special, a pulled pork sandwich.  It was hands down the best pulled pork I've ever had... tender and just the right amount of spices, topped by a bit of barbecue sauce (what good is pulled pork completely doused in sauce - you can't taste the meat then) and a bit of coleslaw.  It came with a side and I chose the mushroom soup - another delicious choice.  I chose what I ate based upon the recommendation of the bartender.  I had asked if there was a place to sit near an outlet and they said they could plug in my computer at the bar.  The bartender was SUPER attentive, asking me how everything tasted, constantly filling up my water and iced tea.  Some of the best service I've ever gotten at a restaurant.\\n\\nThis morning was the event I mentioned earlier.  We sat in the back, and they had everything set up for us, coffee, half & half, sugar, utensils.  The only downside is that I'd suggested they make some sort of breakfast pastry in case people wanted to buy something and I reminded the manager on duty about it, and he said he'd check, but never came back.  So we all just had coffee.  As someone mentioned, it is $3/cup with unlimited refills.  Our server came by to refill coffee and water about every 5 minutes, even thought the place was very full.  \\n\\nI decided to stay for lunch after the meeting, and asked the server in my new seating location for her recommendation.  She recommended the B.L.A.T. which is a bacon, lettuce, avocado and tomato sandwich.  It was fabulous!  The flavors each stood out, and the bread was perfectly toasted and they used only a little mayo which is my preference.  Why do restaurants often use a 1/4 of an inch of mayo?  Yuck!  The bacon was really good.  I also had an Oregon Salad, which was greens, hazelnuts, pears, both red and yellow beets, chevre, and a vinaigrette that was delicious and tangy, just the way I like it.  This was a combo for $10.95.  The salad was a very generous portion.\\n\\nThis is definitely a great restaurant, and I've experienced exceptional service both times (and the second time was the group event and my personal lunch so it was like three times).  I have no idea about those who have posted horrible reviews - the food and the service I've experienced are above anything I've experienced elsewhere in Portland.  Heck, Zagat rated the place a 27/30!"},{"name":"Cha Yen Thai Cookery","address":"613 Mt Auburn St","city":"Watertown","stars":"4.5","text":"Possibly the best Thai food I've had in Boston.

We were running late but the restaurant was crowded anyway, so we ended up having to wait by the bar and get a drink. I got an old fashioned, which was awesome, and she got an Italian soda/Tom Collins like drink that she enjoyed. \\n\\nGreat atmosphere and service. Hostess and bartenders were friendly and our waitress was knowledgable and outgoing. The bread was outstanding (they give you an option of four kinds whenever you run out- make sure you try the flatbread).\\n\\nI had the Carolina rabbit for the first time in my life, and it was incredible. The meat was perfectly cooked and seasoned, and it melted in your mouth. It was served on a bed of bacon ravioli, which was delicious, along with a sweet potato hash. I can't even really describe the flavor; it was just absolutely incredible. My date got the Springer Mountain Chicken, which she loved. Understand that this dish has a very Thai-like flavor to it, so adjust your expectations and taste buds accordingly. \\n\\nFor dessert, we got the chocolate grotto, which was great; rich and tasty, but not overpowering (just don't eat it too fast). The only downside if the meal was 1) that it ended and 2) I didn't like my second drink (a Negroni), though that was simply a function of me trying a new drink that I wouldn't enjoy anywhere. My fiancée loved her second drink. \\n\\nLike I said earlier, this is either the best or second best meal I've ever had. It's hands down the best restaurant in Atlanta and totally worth the cost.

The price is considerably pricey for small plates $10 plus\\n2. They just changed the menu so quite a few of my favorite appetizers such as boiled peanuts and plate of olives are no longer available\\n3. The quality of the food is inconsistent at times. We ordered their bacon fettucini dish and it was pretty bad. The only thing that saved that experience was the chef happened to overhear us complaining and requested us to allow him to remake it. The dish was quite awesome afterwards, but i'm hesitant to order it again simply because I don't know who will be making my dish. I ordered the pork shank dish tonight and it was quite flavorful & delicious...\\n\\nTheir pimento cheese & tomato soup is a huge hit with my Fiance and friends alike and it's quite reasonable at $8.

He also said that they are a high volume restaurant, which is why they go the frozen route.  Nevertheless, I ordered the chicken parm.  When it arrived, the colors looked muted.  The marinara was more of a dull orange color that tasted of canned tomato paste.  The chicken itself was ok, but was super thin.  The spaghetti was awful.  Watery and doused with that orangy marinara concoction.   I forgot to mention that Jay said that if we wanted more bread, he would have to charge us.  Charge for the \\"free\\" bread?

The service was pretty good and the ambiance of the restaurant being european style with high wooden vaulted ceilings was really nice.  Problem with high ceilings is noise level.  It is either deathly quiet when  no one is there or severely loud when people are there.  Either way it was a good overall experience.

I had a few long days at work. We were both looking for the perfect dinner spot. Canoe immediately came to mind. I was last here two or three years ago. The experience was so fantastic, I still remember it vividly. Not that I was surprised; my return experience was equally wonderful. Despite my friend running a good half hour late, they insisted I take a seat and were more than understanding and accommodating. Though we had settled on the Slow Roasted Carolina Rabbit and the Grilled Duck Breast, our waiter threw in the special of Pan-Seared Scallops. When I asked him what to do, he said, \\"Just get all three.\\" That was the EXACT answer I was looking for! (I appreciate an honest answer!) The House Smoked Salmon was fantastic. The rabbit, duck, and scallops were brought out and were works of art. Delicious, flavorful, and filling art. The creme brulee: decadent, perfect. I know that Canoe underwent renovations because of water damage; this place hasn't skipped a beat, which is so good to see. The best part of the night? Enjoying wine while sitting along the river. This is always what makes the experience over the top. One of my favorite escapes in Atlanta is Canoe. Everything about it but especially that post-dinner relaxation period on the restaurant grounds, relaxing in the garden or on chairs on the edge of the river, that makes this place not just unique to Atlanta, but to any restaurant in any city. One of Atlanta's finest without a doubt."},{"name":"Fuze Burger","address":"265 Ponce De Leon Ave NE, Ste A","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"We went there tonight since it's snowing and we didn't want to drive too far.

It was so overcooked and burned that it was basically a tree branch. Smoking is the process of cooking over indirect heat at a low temp for a long time. It would be extremely difficult to burn a hotdog by smoking it. But somehow this place found a way.

Despite this fact, and despite all of its local competition, the Austin Flying Saucer has rekindled my love for the mecca of beer.  I originally fell for the beer selection, which hovers around 240 imported and micro-brewed beers, but alters weekly and (more drastically) seasonally.  I was straight head-over-heels when I happened upon a Space Club sandwich with a side salad one night, and realized that BAR FOOD can also be GOOD FOOD.  I'm not saying you would want to skip dinner at III Forks to catch a sandwich at the Saucer, but it is fresh and wholesome fare that will hit the spot after draining some pints.  As a single 20-something female, I am not intimidated nor offended by the waitresses' outfits.  A tee shirt and a plaid skirt is not what I consider to be hooker-wear (as indicated in some previous reviews), but if you're prone to becoming insecure in the presence of attractive women in skirts, perhaps this is not the place for you.  For those indie-Austinites of you, I think we can all sleep easier knowing that the Flying Saucer IS a chain that supports Austin beer culture and consumption (and therefore our economy) similar to the Gingerman which is ALSO a chain.  I'll get to the Gingerman in a later review.

I made it a point to get to this before anyone else. Heck, I bet you there are a bunch of Yelpers dying to get out of their office to eat at the THE (clever name, no?) and write a review.\\n\\nAfter seeing an article about this joint, I figured I might as well wait... but then I saw that no one had yet reviewed it. Thus, I awoke the next morning and made a beeline to  be first. And, I mean at $3.25 for breakfast, there was no reason not to eat here ASAP. Yelping first is always a bonus..\\n\\nAs I walked up to THE, I saw a good number of signs and had a bad memory about Graze. I arranged to meet a friend for a dinner at Graze last fall, but they had just flat out closed. Alas, THE is located in sort of a back bungalow type thing on the corner of the backside of Graze. There is actually some odd open gate to get into THE from the backside?\\n\\nGetting to the actual ordering stand is quite the maze. I counted like 6 \\"THE signs.\\" You walk under some awning-type coverings. Very... Austin.\\n\\nThe ordering takes place at a little counter, and there are actually a few tables for eating--a big difference from the original institution. Those of you hipsters on the east side no longer need to venture onto the infamous Airport in order to get your (ridiculously) cheap breakfast taco fix. The menu is a touch smaller, but of no less quality.\\n\\nI kept my order roughly similar to that of the flagship: a guacamole chalupa ($1.75 for a whole mess of grub atop a tostada ) and a breakfast taco. The chalupa boasted a whopping scoop of guacamole, a heavy smear of beans, and hefty hand of cheese. And veggies. My breakfast taco was far too stuffed. It had a mountain of rectangular potatoes and a black bean spread. $1.20? Can't beat it.\\n\\nI couldn't wait to eat. I literally stopped and sat in one of those oddly placed chairs leading back. I pounded my two items, then drove off. I suggest you do the same. Get to THE... I guarantee it will receive a rating of utmost satisfaction.

I got there after him but he came to the car to greet me letting me know he was already impressed because the owner was so friendly and he could see the beverages leaving the place. When I walked back in with him I got greeted by the owner and the wait staff. We took a high-top table and began reading the breakfast menu. The waitress immediately came over to ask about a beverage to start us off and when I told her I love a good late but hate the extra sugar most places out in, she explained how they roast the bean with the flavor already in the bean. She recommended the chocolate marshmallow and promised it would not be too sweet. I ordered it iced and it was absolutely fantastic. My boyfriend got a hot flavored coffee, and said it was equally fab. He ordered the eggs-bene, which he orders wherever we go and I asked for help again. I had read reviews about the omelets and the breakfast sandwiches and was stuck. She recommended the breakfast sandwich, that was loaded with great stuff like avocado and spinach. His eggs-benedict were amazing and what he loved most was the sauce was actually white vs, the yellow color that you get at way too many places. It screamed and tasted like a homemade sauce. Also they put enough on it so he could dip the home-fries. Did I mention the home-fries were cooked to perfection and you got a good amount of them.

It almost looked like a small government building. \\n\\nWhen we walked inside, we noticed that the corridor that brought you from one end to the other was quite narrow. I'll explain more on that soon. On both sides of the corridor were the different unique stalls that served their own kinds of food. Such foods ranged from various grilled and fried items to seafood, soups (chowders), sandwiches, and salads. Of course we couldn't forget about the frozen delights, coffee, pretzels, and pastries. All of that sounds appetizing, huh?\\n\\nAs what some other Yelpers mentioned, this place is a tourist trap! The whole entire facility here was crowded! It was so crowded, that it made the entire corridor feel completely narrow. The fact that people stood in the middle of the corridor doing absolutely nothing contributed to that factor. This doesn't include those who were waiting in long lines to buy food. \\n\\nEverything in there was pricey. We got some pastries there, and even though they tasted good, we felt that it wasn't worth the price. But then again, you were in a tourist area. They even had a Starbucks in there, and the prices were pretty high compared to some other locations. SMH\\n\\nStanding in the atrium was pretty cool. Looking up at the top was quite interesting, because of the interior design that was evident up there. Overall, visiting here once was enough for me.

Unfortunately this has been commonplace for Jin Wah for a number of years. \\n\\nFood quality has gone south as well. Lots of skimping on ingredients with many of the dishes.

We couldn't decide what to get so we basically ordered most of the menu. I had been craving brisket for a while and theirs did not disappoint. It had great smoke and the perfect amount of fat (a lot). The ribs were nice and tender, though not the most flavorful ribs I've ever had. The pulled pork was delicious and smoky both by itself and in the baked beans. The rest of the sides (Texas toast, fried okra, fried pickles and French fries) were good, if not remarkable. You order at the counter and someone brings your food out to you. Service was friendly and quick.\\nI don't know if I would say Harry and Larry's is definitively better than 4 Rivers. While they both serve barbecue, they're two very different restaurants, so it's hard to compare them as a whole. I think their brisket is better and once you're there, it's definitely less of a hassle since you don't have to wait in line. They have a simpler, more traditional menu, which could be a good thing or a bad thing, depending on your preference.

Well, the brisket is authentically smoky. . .I see the pink \\"smoke ring\\" on the outer edges of the slices of meat.  Also, there's some nice burnt crustiness too.  In addition to the brisket, the sandwich also has smoked Gouda, crispy fried onions, BBQ sauce. . .and (bad idea) mayonnaise.

Then there are a few places where I wonder how they survive, like the Polish kitchen, and the Indian place that serves pita bread and calls it naan. Maybe it's because Columbus is in the Midwest that this place gets the rave reviews, but it's hardly an outstanding market.

I ordered the Crazy Roll ($8), which was shrimp tempura, avocado, cucumber, tobiko and spicy mayo. The warm and crispy shrimp surrounded by the other cold ingredients was wonderful tasting!

Example: The guy who rang me up tonight apologized for taking longer than 5 secs to make change (register was out of coins). He thanked me for coming in, I tipped him $1, and he acknowledged this with a discrete 'thank you' again. (Whether or not you get the 2nd thank you is my test for great customer appreciation.) Presumably they have a bunch of students on staff, so they turn over quickly.  Yet the shop maintains professionalism & consistency in their food.

If we lived closer we would be coming back for wine and cocktails just to stroll around the outside.  Inside is also nice, with a small bar area to hang out in before you get your table.  The cocktail menu was solid and appealing, although not large.  The wine list had a GREAT selection by-the-bottle, and quite a decent one by-the-glass (maybe 25 total?).\\n\\nThe hostess, the bar staff, and our server were AWESOME.  We arrived much earlier than our scheduled reservation, but were able to be seated much sooner than expected.  Our server was overflowing with personality, which we like - and was VERY helpful with food selection.\\n\\nThe menu was extremely interesting and varied, with many dishes you won't find almost anywhere else - rabbit, pheasant, duck, etc.  Fresh artisan bread kept us happy while we perused the menu -  it was hard to make an entree choice - I wanted 5 of them...\\n\\nWe settled on the raw oyster appetizer, pork loin with butternut squash, and pheasant with sweet potato and pheasant croquettes.  The oysters were VERY fresh, although the cucumber relish they put on top really overpowered anything else - I certainly appreciate the attempt at a cool oyster-topper...but that one's not quite there yet.\\n\\nBoth of the entrees were excellent.  Both bone-in, and accompanied well with their starches and veggies.  The pheasant's outer coating added a nice peppery crispinees - and the dark meat pheasant croquettes were INSANELY good - I was told you can order them separately...and if we are back in the area I will.  The herbs and spices on the pork were also superbly done.\\n\\nThe desserts sounded really good (I wanted the killer sounding bread pudding)...but at that point we would have been hospitalized if we had eaten any more.\\n\\nThe only thing even slightly negative is the proximity of the tables to each other.  Many are so close together the servers can't even walk by - which doesn't really lend itself to a romantic venue, if that's a reason you're going.

I can now tell you what it is - a kickass little joint.\\n\\nThe beer list is impressive, and getting more impressive.  Have no fears, Smithwick's and Chimay fans, they're coming.  The bar manager just doesn't have space in the tap room until he gets some work done.  They have the PROPER PINT GLASSES FOR EVERY SINGLE BEER.  Logo-bearing, properly shaped pint glasses.  The beer is cold, fresh, and cheaply priced.  Notably, Shiner is eligible for happy hour prices!  The bartender knows more about beer than Chase H. and I put together - which is impressive.  I suspect he could even give Dan \\"The Beer Man\\" R. from Spec's a run for his money.   The man knows his stuff.\\n\\nThe bartender and bar manager are both friendly, open, and cheerful, and the owner was out chatting with the customers.  He (the owner) seems to know his customers by name.  He certainly took the time to talk footie with Chase and I - he's an AC Milan fan, if you wanted to know - and talk a bit about the bar.\\n\\nThey've only been open for two months, so obviously improvements and adjustments are ongoing, but the kitchen is being completely renovated with a new griddle, range, grill, and hood, and the tap room is expanding (for more beer selection!), and new recipes are on the way.\\n\\nSpeaking of food, I didn't have any, but it all smelled and looked good, and the menu is pretty impressive.  There's some classy stuff you won't see anywhere else there, like chilled butternut squash soup, alongside the traditional bar standards like pizza.\\n\\nThe joint is still new, and is shiny clean and pleasant smelling.  None of that stale beer smell you get at some bars, and large, well lit restrooms that are tidy and clean as well.\\n\\nThe wine selection is interesting, and in honesty I'm not enough of a corker to know how good it really is, but I'm told it's nice, if limited.  The cocktail selection is interesting and there's a foosball table, along with an actual Mr. Pac-Man (r) table-top game.\\n\\n\\nIn all, I found the atmosphere comfortable but nice, the beer selection and prices better than average, and a nice conversation.

Note that sashimi and \\"fancier' rolls are not included, and range from $.75 - $1.95 extra per piece/roll.  Otherwise the selection is not bad.\\n\\nHowever, after finishing our first order, it literally took 1 hour to flag a staff member down to grab another order form.  We asked multiple times from different wait staff, but we suspect they were delaying our request because we had such a large order in our first round and they knew they were not going to make money off our group.\\n\\nRegardless, after putting in our second order (on hour 2 now, and the restaurant is basically empty), we waiting another 30 minutes to grab another round of beers, and received our second round of hot foods ( a couple plates of gyzoa and shumai - again, not fresh, and most likely re-fried frozen stuff).  It was at this point we heard an argument between a few staff members and the sushi chef, and while most of it was in a foreign language (we believe it was actually Mandarin and not Japanese), we heard the sushi chef shout in English, \\"I leave now.\\"  It was very uncomfortable and a awkward situation.  \\n\\nWe decided to leave the restaurant, and flagged down a waitress and told her we wanted to cancel our second round of sushi and wanted the bill.

Originally the menu had few food items for kids but since we don't feed our kids typical kid food (i.e. Chicken nuggets , etc), not a problem for us. However, over time it got more limited in choices that they preferred so I decided to make it a place to meet some friends while waiting during practice. That ended when I waited for over an hour for appetizers to come out and decided I could have driven closer to Decatur during the 1 1/2 hours we have to sit... fast forward to this week and the 85 collapse traffic nightmare. Decided to give it a go again with R&D. Pleasantly surprised that there was a kid menu and choices more friendly on the menu- the apple salad was terrific. Tonight though,  once again disappointment. After fighting traffic to get over to AZ ave on a Friday I decided to have some food and a glass of wine. I ordered Sopressata, goat cheese, olives, and grilled bread from the pantry list. 43 mins later (I was waiting for someone to notice so I could cancel the food) it came out. It was not busy 2-3 people including myself at the bar and some tables, nothing I ordered needed to be cooked except the toasted bread. I made the comment to the young lady working the bar that wow it took 40 minutes to toast the bread since nothing else was cooked. She told me that yes that got a new oven today (not a toaster or grill) so that was the delay. I explained to her that my son got a burger in 15 yesterday so that seems weird. She clearly was annoyed with me and asked if I needed anything else. I said no then realized that I needed to get going so I asked for a box and the check. I paid for my meal and gave 20% tip despite the rude response ONLY bc I have worked in the service industry and never stiff people. Just disappointing- will not return."},{"name":"Bukowski Tavern","address":"1281 Cambridge St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3","text":"We went here for brunch and were pretty disappointed.

We always order sharables: fondue (original, of course), sauerkraut, potato pancakes (with proper sour cream & applesauce) plus items like onion soup, ceasar salad, cheese bread, boar sausage, etc. The pub side is my preference, inside or patio. Happy hour is well priced and there is always seating. Around the bar you can catch a game on the many TVs - BUT the TVs do not disturb or disrupt the charm of the bar seating. The staff is really friendly and attentive. If you've never tried German cuisine, go! If you like a friendly, spacious pub, go! The restaurant side is nice for a casual or more formal occasion.

The girl who took our order was THE RUDEST cashier I have ever encountered in this establishment in the 3 years we've been patrons. Her tone was condescending, she was rolling her eyes the entire time and really had the worst customer service demeanor I've ever encountered. I asked her why she was being rude. I am a paying customer and have been coming there for years not to mention I was with my family and it was all friendly vibes on our side. She ignores me but makes sure she starts speaking Thai to the others after I asked and hides in the kitchen as I waited for my food. Another staff member comes and replaces her to take orders for other patrons coming in. No one says anything to me. When my order was ready, they called my number and left my bag on the counter. No chopsticks or any utensils and I'm sure that was on purpose as we've NEVER had a takeout order without utensils/napkins in the bag. The rude cashier glared at me from the kitchen and had a smirk on her face.

I moved to the Fenway neighborhood in 2006 and gave up on Ginza around the same time.  The management changed sometime in 2011, and they rolled out the all-you-can-eat meals, online ordering coupons, and most importantly, revamped food.  Pre-2011, I could barely identify the fish they were serving - the taste, texture, color was all unlike anything I'd seen (or would want to see).  Now we get take-out about once a week, and I would put their salmon, salmon roe, and mackerel up against any other sushi bar in Boston.  The tuna could be better, and the yellowtail can be quite good (half the time great, half the time not bad).  I haven't taken a chance on their sea urchin or scallop yet, because it's an expensive risk to take when you don't know for sure that it's good here.\\n\\nI am also a super big fan of their lunch specials (11:30-2:30 daily, even weekends)!  I wish their online descriptions did my two favorites justice:  Ginza Bento, cryptically described as a \\"lunch assortment,\\" and the equally vague \\"Ginza Special Luncheon Combo B.\\"  First off, Combo B is a great deal - it includes a salad with that yummy Japanese restaurant dressing, your choice of udon or soba (I like the soba, which includes a bunch of fresh veggies), then one plump maki (I like the spicy tuna, but they also have California or Veggie).  It's probably the most filling sushi meal you can get for ~$10.  The Ginza Bento has everything you think of - shrimp tempera, sushi rolls, nigiri/sashimi, salad, soup, etc., and with the online discount on a take-out order, it's my go-to for a shared meal or huge brunch.\\n\\nThe all-you-can-eat, I've only tried once with a big group of people, and I've not gone back.  There's nothing wrong with it - it's quite freeing to order a seaweed salad, miso soup, edamame, and THEN whatever sushi you want, but the quantity doesn't settle well with me.  You should know that the sushi menu isn't the all-you-can-eat menu; there's a more economic selection on a special menu for the latter.  If you're a rolls-only person, I also don't think that there are enough \\"fancy\\" rolls to make this worth the money; I'm a fish-only person, so I actually think I got my money's worth."},{"name":"Quincy Market","address":"4 S Market St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Woah.

The salsa definitely tastes homemade and fresh.  The tinga pork or chicken is VERY well seasoned and makes any dish taste good.

Drinks: True Blue margarita, white sangria (summer), and strawberry-rasp margarita.\\n\\nCONS: the decor is dark, and mostly cheesy. They are a restaurant with a bar, as opposed to a bar that serves food. This means they close at 10 on weekdays, and 11 on weekends which stinks when you want to go there after work for drinks.

This chicken is tender, juicy, and seasoned with this rub that is just the right amount of spicy. You can choose how much bird you would like: quarter, half, or whole. Then you get a few sides to round out the meal. It's served on a bed of the cabbage drippings and an assortment of salsas. These range from a mild raw tomatillo salsa to a punch your momma in the face spicy habanero. All are excellent with the chicken.

Now I'm not talking at 1am after a huge rush of people going home from the bar, I'm talking at 9pm on a Friday or Saturday. And these are not ingredients a Taco Bell can survive without.

I asked for a manager to personally make my last items as I figured they would at least try to make it correctly.\\n\\nWhich brings me to my last point. The staff is rude and incompetent. The manager that I spoke to just asked \\"Well what do you want me to do about it?\\" I wanted to try and be nice because everyone knows a horror story of someone spitting in food, but at this point I was just irritated.

This restaurant is inside the Radisson Hotel on Stuart St across from Legal Seafoods, which was a very quick walk from the Financial district. When we walked in the first thing we noticed was the awkwardness of the room. It was just one big room with a bar off to the left which was full of people, then an empty dining room in front of us. The brick oven was way in the back and there were some half booths that had high back stools and the tables were really small. Since we had our choice of what seat we wanted we picked a seat toward the back in front of the brick oven. The server was very nice and very knowledgeable and took the time so that our experience was a good one, which I love. There is nothing worse than someone who doesn't know the answers to your questions or just doesn't have time to deal with them.  \\n\\nI started with the Crispy Calamari. I have had calamari in many places and I can honestly say this one is one of the best I've had. It had toasted pine nuts, jalepenos, arugula and lemon pepper aioli drizzled on top, not the average marinara sauce and banana peppers that every other restaurant serves that I am jusy not that crazy about. The squid was nice and plump and meaty. Not like the often paper thin barely there calamari that most places try to pass off. It was delish. My friends got a flatbread pizza to split for their appetizer, which they said was very good. I did not taste that. I was too busy with my Crispy Calamari.\\n\\nFor our main course I got the Pan Seared Diver Scallops with golden cauliflower & farm house  cheddar risotto, frisee, candied bacon and green apple salad, which was also wonderful. I left a smidgeon of the risotto there trying to save room for the dessert course. One of my friends had the Shrimp and Scallop Spaghettini, which was angel hair pasta with pan seared shrimp and scallops, lemon, white wine and garlic cream sauce. She loved it. I did not taste this. My other two friends had the Grilled Rustic Burger, which  came with handcut fries in a silver cup that looked like something you'd put pens in at work and the burger was presented open faced. I thought it was beautifully presented. It looked nice and juicy too. My friends enjoyed it. Just the presentation alone made me want to order the burger. \\n\\nFor dessert I ordered my absolute favorite Creme Brulee and I was not dissappointed. This came with fresh berries and some biscotti. One of my friends ordered the Capucchino Cheesecake, which was also very good and in a round shape, which you don't see too often. Usually it is by the slice. If I had one complaint it would be that they don't list the dessert section on the website.

I Yelped what was in the area and after realizing a location is closed down that was 500 feet from my office, I'm going to trek out and try something new.\\n\\nWhat a horrible, horrible idea.\\n\\nI ordered lunch specials with a co-worker of mine over the phone.  Now granted the menu I found may not be up to date on a 3rd party website, but all lunch specials were to come with a) a choice of  rice and b) TWO sides.  The guy on the phone gave me a little 'tude when I started telling him the two apps we wanted with each dish, same with the kind of rice (\\"WHITE ON'RY!\\").  Alright fine, then......but if you're going to skimp on my sides the dishes better be even better than before.\\n\\nThe pickup was easy and I didn't get any attitude when I got the food.  But after I got back I couldn't believe what I was looking at in my takeout container.  The General Tso's lunch special was SWIMMING in its sauce and also leaked over into my co-worker's dish which made him very unhappy as well.  I've been to Chinese places that will actually wrap your dish in a plastic bag if they know it may leak, common sense one would assume.  Strike 1.\\n\\nThe fiery looking red sauce is barely edible, it tastes more like ketchup than any sweet sauce I've gotten with my takeout before.  My broccoli was drowning in the sauce as well, screaming to me to get it out before the Heinz flavored concoction kills them.  Too late, the broccoli is already ruined by the sauce and this makes me leery that you may be covering up some freshness in my veggies.  Strike 2.\\n\\nThe chicken is not only smothered in the inedible sauce, but it is over fried as well and super chewy.  Strike 3.  UUURRRR OOOUUUTT!!\\n\\nThe rice was meh, should I even have to review plain, white rice and not expect it to be decent?  The beef teriyaki that the meal came with was the only saving grace, tender and flavored perfectly.

The valet is complementary and the young man who parked my car was very polite. The ambiance of Houston's is classy and even though it was busy it wasn't too loud and out of control. We were served by a very nice waiter, Derek who recommended we try the spinach dip as an appetizer. It was to die for! The dip was fresh and creamy with a lot of cheese and the tortilla chips were hot like they just took them out of fryer. I couldn't stop eating it!  For lunch I ordered the Barbecue ribs with fries and one of the seasonal vegetables which was the corn with jalapeños and zucchini. My mom n law ordered the Double cut pork chop with red cabbage topped with goat cheese. Now we are both picky eaters but when we smelled how good this food was, we knew we were in for a delectable treat. I must say for a place that does not have a barbecue pit in the back, those ribs were so smokey and tender that meat fell off of the bone! The corn was seasoned perfectly with hints of ginger and cumin spice and a little kick to it from the jalapeños. The fries were nice and crispy and not too salty just the way I like them. I tried some of my mom n law's pork chop and it was so tender and juicy it melted in your mouth. We were thoroughly impressed with our entrees. I would usually pig out on ribs but something told me to save room for dessert. So glad I did. I ordered the Apple walnut cobbler topped with French vanilla cream and we shared it ( after the first bite I should have ordered my own :) ). I was speechless after tasting it. The crust and the filling was so buttery and not overly sweet. The walnuts were not too hard and the apples were tender and had the right amount of cinnamon on them. You could taste the high quality ingredients in this dish and if I weren't in public I would have probably licked the bowl! The only complaint I have is that I should have ordered one to go!\\n\\nThe price is a little high, but it is worth every penny.

Moreover, the white marble bar, white tiled floors, and white washed walls all contribute to the clean, open atmosphere of this elegant hotel bar.\\n\\nDRINK //   My boyfriend and I decided to take two seats at the bar and ordered two drinks a piece and a few bar bites.  Although the cocktail menu had a number of great offerings, I didn't see anything that really caught my eye (read: nothing super fruity or sweet).  So I asked the bartender if there was something he could recommend, and he happened to make me two off the menu drinks using fresh fruits he had happened to have on hand.  My first raspberry + gin drink was the perfect balance of sweet + fruity, and my second ginger drink had just the amount of spice I was looking for.  \\n\\nFOOD //   I always get a bad case of the munchies when I drink, and luckily for me, the Hawthorne offers some great bar bites.  For $4 a piece, you can satisfy your late night bar food craving with some creamy spinach and ricotta dips.  Accompanied by fresh cut veggies (long stemmed assorted carrots, radishes, and cucumbers) and fresh hot tortilla chips, these dips are definitely a great bargain!  Unfortunately, I thought that the ricotta dip was pretty mediocre but devoured the spinach dip which was absolutely divine.\\n\\nSERVICE //   5 stars for the bartender for recommending two great cocktails."},{"name":"India House","address":"1038 SW Morrison St","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"I would say give this place a shot.

There is, and quite roomy too.  There was a window table open, which looked cozy and sunny, but we were seated along a glass-cubed wall near a rotating fan--a much needed purveyor of air flow in the warm room.\\n\\nMy Thai plate of choice is drunken noodles because it's spicy, features basil, and is usually mushroom-free.  Smile Thai is too fancy for that name, though.  Maybe it's because of their lack of booze that they don't use \\"drunken,\\" and instead go by \\"Pad Kee Mao.\\"  An order of fresh rolls was good, especially the end pieces because they didn't break apart jettisoning carrots everywhere, but the sauce was disappointing if you're a peanut lover.  Rather than a ground peanut sauce, theirs is sweet and dark brown, with crushed peanuts on top--not what I was hoping for.  My tofu Pad Kee Mao ($6.65) came with plenty of pieces of grilled tofu (I prefer fresh tofu, which you can get if you remember to ask), but not a lot of sauce, and even the noodles were hard to find under all the vegetables.  I'm all for vegetables, but I did think there were too many pieces of bamboo which I don't like and which weren't listed on the menu.\\n\\nMy companion got tofu with vegetables and ginger sauce, which she found tasty and well balanced.  They allowed her substitution, replacing peppers with broccoli.  She also ordered sticky rice to go with her meal.  Even though it's $1.50 extra, she told me it's an option many Thai restaurants don't have.  They forgot, and gave her regular rice, so she had to ask again and waited for a while.  Sticky rice comes in a little covered basket and looked like a creepy white patty, so I'm not sure what all the fuss is about.\\n\\nIf I'd really wanted to stuff myself, I could have had a lunch combo.  For $6.95 you get an entree, salad, soup, and choice of app.  And, as another reviewer mentioned, if you stick with water as your beverage, you really will get about 5 refills during your dining experience, which is great unless you're weak bladdered."},{"name":"Deschutes Brewery Portland Public House","address":"210 NW 11th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Great beer selection, nice atmosphere and the servers are very friendly.

The pickles were a little tart, but had a nice batter on them with a nice chipotle dip.  The hushpuppies were delicious even though they were burnt on the outside.  The corn bread was inedible due to its extreme dryness!  This was likely due to baking too long and/or not enough liquid ingredients.\\n\\nFor our main course we ordered a pull pork sandwich and a half rack of ribs.  It comes with a side of coleslaw, shoestring fries, and baked beans.  The slaw and beans were so so, but the fries were good.  The pull pork was moist and slow cooked well.

The Warm Artisan Cheese Salad was a home run.  Perfect balance of opposites (sweet/savory, warm/cool, soft/crunchy) made for a very well balanced and delicious dish.  I could eat a bigger version of this as an entree no problem.  The Shrimp Stuffed Calimari was good, but a bit pedestrian overall on the flavors.  The chorizo flavor was not very evident and while the dish was good it did not wow me as I expected it to when I ordered it.  \\n\\nThe entrees were both insanely good.  We had the Newfoundland Steelhead Trout, Smoked Salmon Tortelloni, Blue Crab Bechamel and the Sage Roasted Pheasant with Brown Butter Whipped Sweet Potato, Crispy Pheasant Croquette, Natural Jus.  The Trout dish was decadent and rich and could have ended up being a mess of heavy cream without the thoughtful hand of Chef Carvel Gould.  The real uniqueness of this dish was in the details, with the hints of dill and onion that really rounded out the flavor of this dish.  I was hooked from the first bite.  The Pheasant dish was totally different flavor but another rock star dish for sure.  Big, rustic flavors were the theme of this dish from the sage preparation on the pheasant to the decadent jus and sweet potato mash.  The croquettes were amazing.

Upon entering, the restaurant was to capacity (there were tables outside, but no one wanted to sit there) Their were two hostess and they both looked a bit frazzled trying to accommodate the party in front of us. We were finally acknowledged and told the wait would be about 15 minutes or so. We were sat in a corner of the restaurant after a silly mixup from the hostess that involved her sitting the wrong party ahead of mine first -_- Just something to keep in mind, the restaurant is not that big,  a majority of the tables are on the right side of the restaurant and are within close proximity of one another and it can get loud. We were given water and menus, our waitress Felicia was extremly kind and friendly and walked us through the menu. The sushi menu is probably their most extense and diverse. I ordered two rolls and they were delicious! Fun fact: this restaurant doesn't upcharge you for sauces (i.e. Spicy mayo, fish sauce, eel sauce) I found that so cool! We ate and enjoyed it thoroughly. Besides the small mishap with our service, Oudom is a well rounded restaurant with spectacular food. The Thai food looks exquisite as well, I found that menu to be a bit limited though so I opted for sushi instead. Don't regret it!

We went to celebrate our first anniversary and really enjoyed the experience. We dined as a community table at Rain Lilly Farms and got to know some really fun people. The one cocktail provided was delicious and the rest was BYOB, which they offered a few suggestions that we could pick up beforehand.\\n\\nJesse is a chef rock star and somehow manages to make the most delicious food out of seemingly meager offerings (at times). What I whole heartedly love is his dedication to the local farms and vendors. Just that one dinner educated me much about the local, seasonal food available in Austin. \\n\\nI love that I have been seeing Dai Due in my Bon Appetit magazine (and old Gourmet Magazines, RIP) so frequently. Jesse deserves all of this fabulous recognition and I hope that I get to dine at Jesse's table again sometime soon. Until then, I will visit him at the Farmer's Markets around town."},{"name":"Tan Tan Cafe & Delicatessen","address":"316 SE 123rd Ave, Ste A3","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Came here again good still.

Perhaps the best burger I have had in my life. My boyfriend said the same thing and, y'all, he always orders the burger. Always.\\n\\nAnyway, we went tonight sans reservations and, while we couldn't get a real table, were happy to sit at the counter at the window overlooking Ponce. The bar and communal table are also available for walk-ins. The staff were very professional and friendly and helpful -- no complaints there. I do wish the menu were a bit longer, though. The low point of the meal came early, which was the arancini with citrus and fennel pollen -- basically fried risotto balls with cheese in them. The citrus overwhelmed and was somewhat confused by a taste of licorice, from the fennel. We concluded that a) they were better eaten in one bite and b) the citrus needed to be toned way the hell down.\\n\\nBeyond that one misstep in ordering, the meal was magical. The burger was probably about 8 ounces, roughly as tall as it was wide, which made for a vaguely unattractive eating experience. But it was so worth it. It didn't need any toppings at all, but the Vidalia onions were an especially complimentary touch. The waiter told us that of course all the ingredients are local, the buns fresh-baked in house, and the patty  made from the restaurant's own special blend of beef brisket and pork belly, if I remember correctly. \\n\\nThe thing that first caught my attention as I read about Cakes & Ale was the \\"phatty cakes.\\" Up North they call these whoopie pies, little soft cookie-cream sandwiches, and here they are made with soft ginger molasses cookies. They sell them in threes, for good reason. SO DELICIOUS.\\n\\nI will definitely go back to Cakes & Ale, and I heartily recommend it to any lover of burgers or gingersnaps."},{"name":"Du Kuh Bee","address":"12590 SW 1st St","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"For dinner get there before 5:30 p.m. is the best bet!!!"},{"name":"Deschutes Brewery Portland Public House","address":"210 NW 11th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Worth taking people in for a visit when they come to town.

That was a nice touch.\\n\\nWe ordered our meal after hearing of the specials and the waitress's favourite items. She spoke like it was a memorized speech, but that's being picky.

Located near the busy Robson Street. Must walk upstairs to reach the front of the restaurant. It was pretty busy since it was a Canucks game but we managed to get seated quickly. Unfortunately we missed Happy Hour (3-7pm)\\n\\nThunder fries ($6.99): deep-fried yam fries aka sweet potato fries. Tasted good with the cajun dip. Also got random deep-fried cream cheese sticks which I was not fond of (I'm also biased against cream cheese).\\n\\nChicken karaage ($8.95): large pieces. Choice of 2 dipping sauces. Tasted better with the Cajun dip. Would order again.\\n\\nTsukune Don ($9.80): deep-fried minced BBQ chicken sticks with rice and poached egg. Not bad but not that great either. Rice was soft and flavorful from the yakitori sauce\\n\\nToro Inferno ($10.99): Not worth it. Seared toro does not taste good. Also thought it was a roll but it was essentially seared toro nigri. Disappointing.\\n\\nEnvironment/Service: popular as a birthday dinner place since they also serve a multitude of drinks. Many TVs to watch sports games. The cost of drinks were decent. The service was okay; nothing special. They make it easy to split checks with the portable machines. \\n\\nOverall, decent place to eat Japanese food. It's a bit expensive but the type of food, but I guess it's a hip place. They give you cough-medicine tasting candy after paying the check.
