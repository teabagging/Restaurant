Hit up this place on Friday night but I didn't know this place required reservations. We were willing to wait but the hostess couldn't give us a straight answer when we asked how long and we asked twice. She got us a table pretty quickly though but in the process of seating us told us not to come back without a reservation next time and that we could also go to the Roswell location next time... which is a stupid suggestion because the spring road location is about 4 minutes from where we live and it felt like we were being scolded to not come back. If you didn't want to seat us, just tell us reservations are required. I would have been happy to make one for another night and come back. Instead we got seated at a shitty table where wait was reaching behind my head grabbing silverware and salt/pepper shakers all night.  We never got our small glasses of water filled back up. \\n\\nAs for the food I got chicken fettuccini Alfredo and my boyfriend got shrimp penne a la vodka.  Mine was only okay. I think in the cooking process some of the fettuccini noodles got stuck together and created an uneven level of al dente throughout. My boyfriends pasta tasted pretty good though!  However I think the whole thing was way, way overpriced.  It was about $14 for the pasta and an extra $4 to add chicken. The penne dish was about the same but $6 to add shrimp (and they only added about 5 shrimp). Both plates were really small. I finished my entire plate. I can't remember the last time I went to a restaurant and didn't leave with leftovers. I'm only a 130 lb female but I definitely could have eaten more. \\n\\nThe other thing that was weird but not necessarily a knock against the restaurant was that they advertise live music but it was one dude standing next to the door with what was basically a karaoke machine. He sounded great but he's placed right next to the door which is a high traffic area and is awkward when you step right into the dudes space like that. \\n\\nI won't be returning here.

I'm not sure I'd say Bouchee does all of them well, but in general the food was decent - didn't ruin the evening or anything.  I'd definitely spend the extra few bucks to get an app because our food took some extra time to come out.  I wasn't sure why - I guess it was busy for a Thursday night but it wasn't full.  The dessert was nice.  It's hard to really mess up a classic French dessert.  \\nThe prices were not very impressive though.  About $45 a person with a glass of wine, shared app, dinner and tip.

With C and Raincity Grill doing well in a town that adores seafood and oceanviews, Kambolis took a risk by a) opening a dining establishment forty feet away from C and b) renting a space that is known for its high turnover rather than its apple turnover (or albacore turnover in this instance?). I read about Nu when it opened, and recently heard about Executive Chef Robert Clark's attempt at providing a 100-Mile Menu, so I supported this restaurant's bid in hosting our annual Christmas work dinner.\\n\\nI have noted in previous reviews that one should always be cautious of restaurants offering amazing views and/or convenient locations, as these draws often result in subpar meals. I should have heeded my own warnings when considering Nu, where it felt like our meals took a backseat to the loungey ambiance, the wonderful waterfront views of False Creek and the borderline gaudy decor. Speaking of seats, Nu has the most uncomfortable seats I have ever parked my rear in. Kambolis went for Saarinenesque cool over lumbar-supporting comfort.\\n\\nThere are some tasteful components to the decor, such as the brass-tiled ceiling and the marble counter tops. There are strong elements to be found in the menu, with its focus on local products and a classic meat n' potatoes format. There are also engaging features found on their website, with its virtual Flash buttons and updated menu specials. BUT...the decor is overdone, the food does not live up to the menu, and the website is choppy and distracting.

They also have bubble tea in an assortment of flavors. They have way more flavors than more pho places. I've noticed that the bubble tea at pho places tend to much more thicker and smoothie like than \\"milk tea\\" from boba places. I really like that they have a green tea and a red bean bubble tea! They also give you a lot of tapioca at the bottom for all you tapioca lovers.\\n\\nI ordered a vermicelli bowl (#61) and my partner order a stir fry noodles (#84).The presentation here is fantastic. I've never been to a Vietnamese restaurant where the presentation was actually thought of. Everything had it's own little spot. I thought my vermicelli bowl was above average. The grilled meat was cooked to perfection and the tad bits of fat really added some flavor. I was sad to see only three pieces of shrimp, but each piece was so succulent, juicy and fat. I love eating grilled shrimp with my vermicelli bowls! They give you a small sauce tray of fish sauce. You really don't need the whole thing unless you like your noodles to be drenched. The noodles mixed together with the veggies and meat make a really refreshing bowl of food.\\n\\nThe stir fry noodles was something we've never seen before on a menu. They tasted pretty average; just your typical beef flavored stir fry. It wasn't amazing, but the portion size was pretty good. I did like the veggies in this dish and the strong flavor of beef. There is another option to get crunchy noodles, although I'm not sure what that is or what it tastes like.\\n\\nService was excellent. We were taken care of very well by one waitress. She was patient, and very exact with our orders. She made sure that each person got precisely what they requested.

My friend was like,\\"Uhm, I'd like a table for three?\\"  That is why we were there, wasn't it?

Very nice place, concrete countertops, and you can see the brew kegs behind the bar.  Fairly friendly waiter.  I was a bit skeptical about getting a margarita at a non-Mexican restaurant, but my fears were quickly squashed.  They have Milago tequila infused with fresh watermelon and canteloupe.  They float it on top, and it is sooooo good!  I figured it would be really expensive, but was only 8 bucks.  AND it was strong.  Plus, the salt tasted wonderful... I don't know if they just rim the glass with lime juice or they use flavored salt...  another dining companion mentioned it later in the evening on how yummy the salt was and kept licking her hubby's glass.\\n\\nWe noticed they have happy hour every day, I think from 4-7 or so.  Appetizers under five bucks, 3 dollar ritas, and some other specials.

The garden & the river are a nice backdrop, and the restaurant seating is aligned to show this off.  Brunch has been a \\"never had anything less than 'good'\\" experience for me, but the duck burger, shrimp-crawdads-eggs-&-grits, & at least 2 different flavors of their eggs benedict have all been big winners that I recommend.

On certain days, they even give you shrimp for free, and they've got rice cakes and a wonderful array of limitless sauces (ESSENTIAL)/soups/desserts to choose from. Please, I'm comparing this to RockWok (which I gave one star in my previous review and which has now since closed thank god), but if you blind folded me and asked me to eat hot pot, this place would rate much much higher than the AYCE kbbq places in all of atlanta. \\nThis place has the food and concept going for it, but the interior decoration, looks of this place is TERRIBLE. It looks moldy, plain, drab, and the sauces just look unclean. Imagine eating a wonderful dinner in a bathroom. A great place to take tons of buddies to eat with (wouldn't recommend eating here with 2-3 people, unless they're voracious dinosaurs), but don't expect to be impressed with the physical looks of this place. If this place remolded the interior and moved into Breaker's, it'd get a ton more customers and people would be happy to pay $25+ for the food."},{"name":"IHOP","address":"5203 Kirkman Rd","city":"ORLANDO","stars":"2.5","text":"My breakfast was OK!

I'm not just saying this because I work there, but we do have a little something for everyone on our menu. To be honest, I don't even like all of the things on our menu but there are definitely some choices that I eat religiously.  Our pretzels are fabulous, where else in Austin can you go to get a mall sized pretzel along with some great beer. We have some good vegetarian options like our hippie burger, hummus and pita, hippie hollow pita wraps, or a cheese snack plate would be a great pairing for a nice cold brew... Speaking of Cold Brews, we serve our beer as cold as beer is supposed to be served. We do not freeze the hell out of it, because we embrace the flavors in the beer. Ideally beer is served between 38-40 degrees, if you like your beer especially cold I would suggest going for a bottle, since they are kept in the cooler and the glass bottle tends to get pretty chilly.\\n\\nThanks everyone for putting your opinions out there, other staff members and myself read these reviews so that we can keep up with YOUR standards!

I have to admit, I can't remember the last time I went to a buffet, so I was skeptical. Having never eaten here, it was the perfect way to gradually introduce myself to everything they have to offer. I think I over did it, but I still didn't feel uncomfortably full. \\n\\nFirst of all, this place is extremely authentic. The TVs have Bollywood music videos on, so it was entertaining as we waited for the others to arrive. Also, I'd say about 90% of the people dining here during a busy weekday lunch were Indian. This is a VERY good sign. Most people complain about Indian food (here in Austin, at least) not being spicy enough when it is designated the spicy version. Their food is SPICY. And when it says spicy it IS. And even when it is not labled spicy, it still IS. I loved the offerings on the buffet, especially the fried baby corn! My absolute favorite was the onion chutney, which I proceeded to dip everything in it. So delicious. With so much to try, I wasn't able to try it all but I liked everything I tried. \\n\\nMy only complaint about the food was that the naan was incredibly tough when I was there. It was a minor setback. All of it on the buffet was way too tough, not sure why. Secondly, it was very warm inside. I wasn't uncomfortable, but I wasn't....comfortable. My suggestion is to make sure you sit underneath the fans as we weren't because we had a table for 6. While I loathe being hot, and I'm not sure if it is always hot in there, it does not deter from my love for tasty, authentic Indian food, and their food was great. And the mango kulfi (home made Indian ice cream) was AMAZING. \\n\\nHowever, I don't understand the aura around dosas? Our buffet came with a freshly made to what you prefer (plain, mild or spicy). I found nothing spectacular about dosas, but this was my first one I've ever had. It had a tiny amount spicy potato inside it and the rest was empty. I saw others dipping the crunchy dosa in sauces, almost like a chip. But it seemed flavorless to me. I learned it is made out of ground lentils. If it did not come included with the buffet, I would not order it. \\n\\nI can't wait to try dinner, and I am excited to have been introduced to a great Indian place on the north side close to home.\\n\\nNote: They serve no meat here for lunch, dinner or buffet.

Kind of a scary thought but hey, we're a family of diners that don't hold back!  In fact, we should make a routine to ask for the largest table in the restaurant to capacitate the amount of grub that arrives at our table.  \\n\\nAMBIANCE: \\nModern industrial design with an eclectic (upside down lamps hanging from the ceiling kinda place) vibe - quite unique.

No worries though as they have plenty of table tops near the bar so you can order some drinks and apps while you wait.  \\n\\nFOOD:\\n5 stars:  \\n- Buttermilk Biscuits: I know, I know.  It's just bread but omg, it's the best biscuits I have ever tried.  My daughter described it as \\"buttery goodness\\".   I don't ordinarily go for biscuits but so glad I tried it here.  \\n-Grilled Corn on the Cob: Gluttonous perfection cut up into bite-sized amounts to share.  Order these pronto!\\n \\n4 stars:\\n- Deviled Eggs: Great simple starter and more of a staple as it was traditionally prepared.\\n- Hush puppies: Another decent starter and alternative to bread but if you're undecided, go with the biscuits! \\n- Smoked Salmon Toast: Very traditionally prepared.  I'm not sure why I expected it to be something other than the version I'd get from breakfast or brunch?  Maybe because it was on their dinner menu?  Hmmm....\\n- Mac & Cheese: My daughter loved the rich and creamy cheesiness.  Me...not as much.  I think you have to be in the mood for an overdose of pure mac & cheese to fully appreciate this dish.   \\n- Soft Shell Crab: Originally ordered the scallops that accompanied the succotash but they were out and prepared the crab with it instead.  It had been a while since I'd had soft shell crab and I did like their rendition of this dish but not dreaming of the day that I would need to come back order it again though.\\n- Bone Marrow: Group thought this was terrific and worth ordering over the ribs as a meat dish.\\n- Sweet Potato Hoe Cakes: Never heard of this before?  Neither have I haha.  Best described as some sort of a dinnertime pancake made with sweet potatoes (?)  Worth trying at least once just to satisfy your curiosity. \\n- Fried Chicken & Waffles - Seasoning was nice but it was slightly overcooked. It would've been a crowd favorite otherwise. \\n\\n3 stars:\\n- Fried oyster lettuce wraps: This didn't do much for me unfortunately and it was probably because the ratio of actual oyster (minus all the breading they used) to lettuce was very off.  Instead of \\"Where is Waldo?\\", it was more like \\"Where's the oyster?\\"\\n- Popovers: A favorite for many reviewers but not a hit with us for some reason.  It had something to do with the cheese and the pepper jam just not being the best combo.\\n- Ribs: Described by the meat eaters in my party as overcooked and super duper salty.  Tip: If you order these, make sure you tell them not to burn 'em and to handle the salt shaker with ease!\\n- Charred Broccoli & Pea Shoot Salad: Refreshing although the dressing was a little bland. It was nice to fit fresh veggies in somewhere though to counteract all the devilish damage we were doing with the other plates :)\\n\\nSo you can see what I meant when I said we ordered EVERYTHING.  Scary, isn't it?!   \\n\\nOverall consensus of this place?   We all agreed that it was a great time.  Loved the atmosphere and our server and bartender were great peeps.  Some of the food we ordered were awesome, some were very good while others could stand to be replaced.

It included all of their freshly baked pastries, which were the Georgia Pecan sticky buns, sweet and savory scones.  Just to be clear, the scones were either sweet (sprinkled with sugar) or savory.  My personal favorite were the pecan sticky buns, but a strong runner up was the savory scone!\\n\\nAccompanying the scones was an assortment of spreads, including a type of honey butter that was a hit at the table (man it was good!) as well as fruit spreads that all were tasty too.  I also got a chance to try the Zucchini & Pecan bread that came with a basil cream cheese.  Interesting take on cream cheese, but as far as pastries go, the zucchini bread was probably my least favorite of the day.\\n\\nThe duck N' beef burger came with wilted spinach, pickled onion and a sunny side egg on top.  There were issues with this burger.  another guest and I both ordered our burgers medium well, but both came out well done.  In all fairness, they did replace the burgers for a better cooked one, but I chose to keep the well done burger.  The flavor of the burger really.....wasn't.  It looked beautiful, but I found myself adding condiments to it to jazz it up.  I also didn't like that the bun was very hard, and upon biting into the burger, the burger insides got pushed outside more than once.  This was a complaint with the corrected medium well burger as well.\\n\\nI'd never had truffle fries, believe it or not, so that was a treat for me, and while the fries were beautiful, and good, I immediately came up with several fry orders that were tastier.\\n\\nThe show stealer for me was actually outside of the restaurant.

Willys Woodfired Pizza & Pub","address":"Progress Ridge Townsquare, 12345 SW Horizon Blvd, Ste 61","city":"Beaverton","stars":"2.5","text":"The first thing I need to say about this place is that it is a RIP-OFF. If I was reviewing on...\\n\\nprice/value alone: 1 star.\\nfood quality alone, isolated from price: 2.5 stars.\\n\\nI've was teetering on 2/3 stars for my review, because the interior and location is pretty nice, and at least the service I experienced on my visit was very attentive. Overall, this place probably deserves 2.5 stars, but I don't think that the value and quality here is good enough to warrant a full 3 stars.\\n\\nLet's talk about price: $20 for a 14\\" pizza. This might be the smallest 14\\" pizza I've seen, and with it's thin crust certainly the least filling. I'd call it a *slightly* over sized personal pizza, and I think most guys could easily (and I do mean easily) take down one on their own. For $20. That's some expensive pizza.\\n\\nNow if you know Portland, you know of the pizza gods in Portland: Apizza Scholls, Wy'east Pizza, Oven & Shaker, Pyro Pizza, Ken's Artisan Pizza, Give Pizza a Chance, Escape from New York Pizza. ALL of these spots listed (even the least of my favorites on that list) offer MUCH better pizza for MUCH cheaper.\\n\\nSure, we're in Beaverton, not the food utopia that's known as Portland. OK, fine. If you're used to pizza in this area, BJ's is better than Godfather's or Domino's, but ranks below someplace like Bellagio's or Pizzicato. However, they charge more than anyone else (even Pizzicato), probably because they use a wood fire oven and have a nice interior. But in my eyes, it doesn't justify it.\\n\\nReading the reviews, I came in with pretty low expectations, thinking my pizza would be a burnt, tasteless mess. This was not the case. We had a group of 8 people and all the pizzas we ordered came out with an appropriate amount of crust char (remember, this is wood fired pizza... some crust charring is normal). The flavor was nothing special and nothing to write home about, but I didn't leave feeling like I had a ton of complaints. It was just average pizza. Don't take that as a compliment though, because it's pretty hard to mess up pizza.\\n\\nI will say that Pyro Pizza in Portland offers very similar wood fired pizza that is WAY better, and gives you a similar sized pizza for less than HALF the price. Granted Pyro is a food cart, so if I compare to the very cool and classy sit down Ken's Artisan pizza, you get MUCH better wood fired pizza in a MUCH cooler environment for $11-$13/pizza. And Apizza Scholls, who has arguably the best pizza in the entire NW, serves up a massive pie for $20 that simply kills BJ's in both the quality & quantity department.\\n\\nWhich really just begs the question, why are they charging more than any other pizza place in town for mediocre pizza? Why are they charging more than the BEST pizza places in downtown Portland, and why would I ever want to come here and drop $20 on a small, mediocre personal pizza?\\n\\nOh, and side note: from our group of 8, I head second hand that the non-pizza items were not very good. One friend (who has VERY low food expectations and loves suburban food chains that I think suck) commented that their burger was disappointing. Which means I would probably hate it with the passion of a thousand firey suns.\\n\\nOh, and random 2nd side note: for a big restaurant like this, why do they have a one-at-a-time guys bathroom (and a TINY girls bathroom). Seriously? What is this, a coffee shop? There were 4 people in the hall waiting to use the restroom on a weekday night when the place was half empty.

There are plenty of street performers doing anything and everything from making balloon animals to break dancing to juggling to singing. I love strolling towards Quincy Market after some quiet time in the Commons for some infectious crowd action. Also, really, this is the perfect spot to be, with plenty of food options in Quincy Market (tons of small stands and vendors for variety of food) and quite a few restaurants near by. At Fanueil hall marketplace (which is essentially the same location as Quincy market), many large chain (e.g. Victoria Secret, A&F, AE) as well as small local stores sell anything from fashion to crafts to novelties.

Hawkers uses MSG, aka monosodium glutamate in all of their sauces and almost every dish. MSG is a FLAVOR ENHANCER that has been linked to ADD, Headache, Flushing, Sweating, Facial pressure or tightness,\\nNumbness, tingling or burning in the face, neck and other areas, heart palpitations, Chest pain, Nausea, Weakness and others (via the Mayo Clinic - http://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-living/nutrition-and-healthy-eating/expert-answers/monosodium-glutamate/faq-20058196). \\n\\nIt is very controversial and has been outlawed in some countries. Many restaurants label their establishments as NO MSG so that people know. Not only does MSG pose health risks, but it shows that the cooks do not know how to properly flavor a dish. They utilize flavor steroids for almost every dish. Our server explained to us that they even have a SHAKER full of MSG that they sprinkle/pour onto every dish. \\n\\nI found out about the MSG because my mom is highly allergic (gets crippling headaches) and we asked to make sure the restaurant had none. We were in for a disappointing and shocking surprise.\\n\\nOther than this glaring issue, the service is good, the tapas style is good, and the beer is good.

Sweet and spicy but not too heavy.  I had the rice plate with mixed meats and it was fantastic.

The brisket was just perfect, and really if you're going to call yourself central Texas BBQ then it better damn well be perfect. I was incredibly impressed with the ribs as well. The rub that they're using was just fantastic. Pulled pork had more flavor than most I've had and the chicken was solid. Really the only thing that seems to need work is the sausage.

We wanted a green vegetable and originally ordered the Snow Pea Shoots but they said they were not in season. Then we asked for the Watercress but they said it wasn't available.

The prices always seem to be more expensive than you would think-probably because the fries come in a way too large portion and are priced accordingly.  The ambiance doesn't lend itself to sitting down and enjoying your burger.  Everything about being here is rushed and chaotic.  Arguably, the store is way too small as seating is very limited for the crowd that is usually here.  Even though my burger and fries have always been tasty enough I feel perturbed every time I come here.\\n\\nFrankly, nowadays, I can get a similarly good burger at Wendy's if I want something close or quick...or I can go a little more upscale and get way more variety at a gourmet burger shop such as Pine 22 if I want to sit and take my time.\\n\\nVerdict on Five Guys (at least this location)...burgers mostly good with a fairly pedestrian range of options, fries very good but portions are too large and expensive... ambiance-nothing short of chaos unless a quiet roar is in your vocabulary...parking...mostly chaotic with lots of SUVs and trucks parking in the spots marked as Compact Vehicle Only....Is Five Guys worth the effort...Meh..."},{"name":"Giovanni's Pizza & Roast Beef","address":"62 Maple St","city":"Danvers","stars":"4","text":"Everything here is pretty much OK.

This is because Deschutes doesn't just offer great brews, but some very good eats. Parking is best found on the street and around the block. \\n\\nI came here to have an off-season sip and salad, and recall having been here a few times before as well. I figure balancing some of the good with the bad would ease the guilt. I went straight for the bar area instead of the restaurant to avoid lengthy wait times, and asked for their coveted Black Butte Porter Anniversary selection. If you haven't tried this before, whether it be in Washington or Southern California, I highly recommend searching for it at a local craft brew store. It is silky smooth with full bodied flavor, unlike many stouts. It doesn't boast that barrel aged taste over others, and is surprisingly strong. \\n\\nTheir menu is huge, but all of it seems to great. I highly recommend the garlic fries, or better yet the Inversion IPA pretzel. The pretzel is fresh and the perfect salty snack with  beer. They also have wines for those wishing to opt out of the brews. My favorite menu item is the roasted beers and burrata. It is fresh, and potentially can feed two among another small plate. It is very fresh, and the greens were better than anything I could have imagined. This may be that they source local produce or otherwise, but I found that the taste of burrata on walnuts, fennel, and granola croutons gave the salad just enough weight to make it feel like you ate something to keep you going for the day.\\n\\nPerhaps my bias is in being a fan of Deschutes before I even got here, but it was validated by the availability of some rare brews and great, great eats.

The chef sent out a birthday plate with cookies and a candle for the birthday boy, which was very classy and appropriate.\\n\\nEveryone who has been here knows that the patio view is beautiful. The garden is so pretty and peaceful, and after dinner my boyfriend enjoyed a post-dinner celebratory 18-year scotch as we strolled through and sat on a bench to hang out and watch the ducks.

This shopping center has a lot to offer, but much of it is tucked in such a way that you don't notice it from the road.  Even though I'd seen the CG sign, I had no idea of its size, its patio, its outdoor TVs.\\n\\nA friend had arranged for us to have the couch area in the game room.  This was perfect for my 10 month old son, since we could spread out a blanket and let him crawl all over while we watched the game projected on the screen.  Unfortunately, the screening quality of the projector wasn't all that great, so we were watching it in standard definition.  \\n\\nTo keep our hands busy, there were plenty of wings and towers of beer.  The medium wings were good, just spicy enough.  We also got an order of the KJ's Kickin' Wings, which has a sauce similar to a chunky honey mustard sauce.  Apparently many people don't like it, since the server specifically asked if the one of our party ordering had them before.  Or maybe people just expect them to be really spicy and they're totally different.  We also got an order of fries, but they took so long that the server brought us 2 orders.  \\n\\nParking can be surprisingly difficult since there are so many shops and businesses that share this shopping center.  Also, you can smoke on the patio, and with the doors open to let in the \\"fresh\\" air and the wind blowing just right, I could actually smell smoke inside.\\n\\n#Yelp365 - 294/365"},{"name":"Gustav's Pub & Grill","address":"10350 SW Greenburg Rd","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Me and my family have been coming here for over 10 years!

I was told it would be \\"a few minutes.\\" I paid for it and sat down to wait. Time continued to drag and I went back up to make sure that they hadn't lost track of my order. They said again \\"a few minutes\\" and it was obvious they were really overwhelmed. By the time my food appeared it had been 55 minutes.\\n\\nAt that point I was thinking that this would have to be the best Chinese food I'd ever had to make up for the wait. It most decidedly was not. My House Special Lo Mein was very average and my wife's \\"Cashew Style\\" Chicken certainly had a lot of cashews but precious few vegetables.

It was quiet when we were there, with only a few other patrons, and Bollywood tunes quietly playing in the background.  \\n\\nThe buffet itself is not the largest I have seen, though there is a decent variety of items, including a salad bar, soup, dessert, and the means to make your own Indian street food bites (add the chopped onions and such to the pastry, pour on the sauce, and eat in one bite).  The buffet has a lot of meat dishes but some vegetarian options too. \\nAll in all, a decent selection.   The taste and spice, though, is definitely geared towards an American crowd.  I myself am not a fan of super spicy curries to be sure, but even I found them to be a bit on the mild side. My friend definitely found it so.  That said, if you like your food hot, you might want to order off the menu and request a certain level of spice.  There are some interesting options available, including some wraps that sound quite tasty.  \\n\\nService was fine when we went.  Polite, efficient.  We had no problem getting baskets of fluffy, chewy naan or refills on our drinks.  \\n\\nOverall, A-OK seems about right.

I had the regular Angus burger and french fries.  The burger was cooked as I requested, but it had a strange aftertaste. The bun was of the plain white variety, and the thickish french fries had the texture and flavor of those that can be emptied from a freezer bag.  My friend chose the blue cheese burger and only finished half of it before he gave up. He liked the spicy blue cheese sauce, but we were both disappointed that the burgers were served with a pile of thinly shredded lettuce, which turned to mush quickly when smushed into the burger sandwiches. \\n\\nAll the burgers come with regular fries or tater tots, lettuce, tomatoes, and condiments.

So bland, it seemed like there was no seasoning to it at all. I ordered the eggplant parmesan and the sauce tasted like it came straight out of a can labeled tomato paste. It did NOTHING for me. My friend ordered the fried calimari. I would have thought it hard to screw up this order since the batter usually covers up most of the taste but even this lacked complete flavor and was the blandest crap I have ever tasted. \\n\\nAll and all, I will probably be back to this place.

Such a quaint little breakfast spot and I wish they had something reminiscent of this in NY. So everyone knows that Sunday brunch anywhere can be a dream and a nightmare. I ended up calling ahead just to see what the wait was like and they said about 30 minutes. When I got there the manager greeted me and the cafe was completely full and he ushered me two doors down to \\"stay warm\\" until there was an open table for my party-- which of course, I thought this was not only the sweetest but so thoughtful.\\n\\nAfter about 10 minutes we were brought over to the cafe and seated. Our waitress introduced herself and brought us the menus. They do things a little differently here and majority of their drinks are self serve -- which is super cool. So after a while I got up and proceeded to make my tea, grabbed an apple juice from the fridge and got a cup of ice water. They have a machine that squeezes the oranges for freshly squeezed orange juice but only the waiters can operate that. We ordered and within a few minutes large plates began to overtake our table.\\n\\nEvery time I go out to eat I seem to get all the stares from everyone dining because I always look like a greedy butt but what it really is is that I am so tempted to try so many different items knowing I don't have enough room in my belly to put it. Oh well -- YOLO .. We had banana fosters brioche french toast which was to die for. Banana pancakes that were about the size of my head. My daughter wanted this waffle and it had about 15 servings of fresh fruit piled on covered with powdered sugar and whipped cream. Eggs, bacon, toast, bagels, you naamme it! lol\\n\\nYummy yummy in my tummy .. I fell in love with this little place.

But it's true. You can also get items like the salads modified (no veggie X or Y) with no problems, and if you needed to mod some of the food spiciness, you can do that too, as well as pick different dressings.  Plus, they have a gluten-free menu. That aside: I have liked Tarka from day 1, even compared to more traditional Indian restaurants, because as I mentioned in my review of the Anderson location, I still feel that they tend to use fresher ingredients than any other Indian place I've been to in Austin. Yes, people may compare them to a Chinese Pei Wei (but for Indian food) but I'd rate them higher than that, as well. As long as Tarka keeps up their food quality consistency, I will keep going back. : ) \\n\\nThis location is brand spankin' new in the Domain's tiny 'Rock Rose' district/side street. My visit was super pleasant because for some reason everyone not at Tarka was in clones of downtown bars across the street from them. The interior is similar to the other Tarkas - open and spacey, with some seating outside as well, and once again, an interesting blend of musics on the house audio system.\\n\\nGood work, Tarka!

The waffle was crispy and just right, the chicken cooked nicely, and it came with this smoked maple syrup. I am *not* a fan of syrup as it's too sugary for my liking, but this syrup was TO DIE FOR. \\n\\n-Doughnut sliders: Much better than I expected. A bit of a quirky food but was tasty and fulfilling.

The perfect appetizer for such heavy foods. \\n\\n-Marshmallow cake: I believe this was a tiramisu (it must be seasonal - I can't find the name on the website). It was okay - the marshmallow was a bit much so we ended up just scraping it off and eating the rest. \\n\\n-Pancho Villa: Tequila barrel-aged in a barrel made of some sort of spiced wood.

The restaurant is fairly small so with their no reservation policy getting a seat may be a challenge at times. However on recent Saturday at 6 PM getting a table was no problem. Here is my take:\\n\\nParking: Street parking is easy to find plus there is a parking lot in back of Passport. A\\nAtmosphere: Unpretentious but nice. The large screen TV is a bit of a distraction and the back dinning area is a bit awkward while the bar area is comfortable.  B to B+\\nService: Excellent service. Our waiter was very knowledgeable about the menu. A+\\nDrinks: Large Beer, wine and liquor selection that contains some really exceptional values. They pour a solid drink and glass of wine. A\\nFood: As you might expect the food is the star of the show here. The menu is set up so you can pick from small bites up to more substantive meals. We ordered the olives and shrimp toast. I was expecting a standard dish of mixed olives. What we received as an incredible dish of olives cooked with garlic, herbs and lemon served warm. This dish alone was worth the trip. Everything else that followed lived up to the quality of the first dish.  Finally for desert we had a dish of graham cracker ice cream. While it made sound a bit odd it was incredible.

Now I realize this is a sensitive issue for restaurants, and being a part time restaurant employee, I feel especially timid around these situations.

This is pretty much a key item if you are hungover, need a nap, or want to have the best day ever. \\n\\nOther things that make this a fabulous heavenly experience: \\nThe bang-a-ranchero.

Fo' realsies folks. I can eat this on a Sunday and not need to eat for the rest of the day, it's that good and that much food. Biscuits and gravy are one of the reasons that brunch is only served on Sundays, if it was available to me every day, I would be 500 lbs. Or dead.

Just wow. The house charcuterie is so skilled. Every meat was perfectly made, full of flavor, and very different from the other offerings on the platter. Great housemade pickles (beets and carrots) give a bite of something bright to cleanse your palate. I'm afraid I can't list them all the meats, bad memory. But you definitely should order the meat  platter. \\n\\nFor our main, we shared a wagyu ribeye, potatoes Caroline, with a cool cucumber watermelon salad. The meat was an existential experience. So beefy and tender. This is beef heaven. If you love beef, try the grass fed wagyu here. It's hard to go back to HEB steak  after this. The salad was worth the trip alone. Fresh cucumbers (possibly pickeling cucumbers?) thinly sliced along with chunks of sweet ripe watermelon, decorated with roasted corn and thin wafers of salty Cotija cheese. This is summer on a plate. The potatoes are good but not great. They have a good crisp but I'm not crazy about the aioli or whatever the sauce was. This dish didn't really do anything for me, but it's not bad and it's prepared well, but I just didn't get into it. \\n\\nFor dessert (save room for dessert!) we had blackberry sorbet and pecan cake. I really wanted to share one dessert but I couldn't decide so we got two. The sorbet came with a scoop of soft flowery blackberry and a more solid scoop of what can only be described as the ultimate essence of mango. These are very fine sorbets. The pecan cake was delicious but I honestly couldn't tell you what the predominant flavors were.

Will definitely be back!"},{"name":"Bistro Niko","address":"3344 Peachtree Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Bistro Niko, as you probably know from the other couple hundred reviews here, is a French restaurant and  part of the Buckhead Life Group of restaurants, a group of restaurants known for their quality of food and service.  I use the ultimate card that they offer and usually charge it every winter as they usually have some offer then to discount the charging of the card.  \\n\\nSo I'm very familiar, I suppose you can say a fan of the group.  So my bias leans that I'm going to enjoy my experience every time, and typically they do not disappoint.  Bistro Niko does not disappoint.  I'm not sure everyone that comes in gets a waiter with a French accent but that's sure a bonus to set the scene - additionally adding bonus points for being animated, friendly, and knowing the menu.  Secondly, in the service he was prompt and attentive to our needs and I'd give this a 5 star on service. \\n\\nOne thing that I appreciated is that we decided to do 3 apps and share a main course.  The waiter did not even hesitate that this was an ok plan by him.  In order of greatness, the Pork Belly was fantastic, the lamb confit was crispy skinned and oh so juicy and tender inside, and the scallops - calamari app was our least fav.  Not that it wasn't done well, but I'm not a huge fan of French as I usually find that at times it can be a bit bland (I like spice) and I would say the app was a bit on the bland side.\\n\\nWe shared the pork chop, it was probably the thickest cut of pork chop I've seen in my life.  Cooked to perfection, grill marks perfectly laid on the outside and tender in the middle, this dish I would do over again if I go back.\\n\\nThe ambiance is really nice, it's not a typical French upscale interior, it has a mix of subway style flair, open court, and fine dinning.  The only drawback is the noise level.  Having done the patio for breakfast on one occasion I found the patio to also be inviting, as you can watch the busy street and people go by while getting that fine dining feel.  Also, to speak of the breakfast, the eggs benedict is divine!\\n\\nI will be back."},{"name":"Canoe","address":"4199 Paces Ferry Rd SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"If you're looking for a one sentence review: order the truffle fries for take out.

The only good food i ate were the truffle fries, which are amazing. My wife ordered the snapper and got food poisoning that night, on her birthday, and she couldn't sleep all night because of it. \\n\\nI ordered the duck and beef burger which came out cold and spongy. They did bring me out a fresh one at no charge but that was after everyone had finished and I was no longer hungry.

When you walk into the restaurant, check in with the host stand and let them know the number in your party and grab a number/ticket and wait. The wait is not so bad depending on the day. The dim sum is pretty good at Royal China. Service is spotty as it can be great sometimes and other times it's very bad service as it's hard for you to get any servers and other employees attention to refill your tea and water. I usually opt for dim sum plates like shrimp dumplings, pork/shrimp dumplings, fried radish cakes, rice noodle rolls (pork & shrimp), deep fried taro balls, fried sesame balls, egg tarts, pork spare ribs, and other items. The dim sum carts will stop by your table several times during your dining experience. Sometimes, they might forget to stop by your table so you might have to go up to the carts to order -- remember to bring your \\"ticket\\" so that they could mark what you order. As for drinks, I usually get ice water and hot chrysanthemum tea with sugar added. \\n\\nOverall, I will continue to dine at Royal China as there are not better options in Atlanta.

They offered dosas in the Buffett which seemed attractive. They didn't have any bowls for sambar, rasam or raita. We had to reuse our plates/bowls 2-3 times tired of waiting for them to get new from the kitchen. There are like 3-4 types of old plates in circulation, which was not flattering. Cutlery was different for each person. Jeez, just buy one consistent set from restaurant depot and stop re-using the old crap!\\n\\nFood- the variety was good but. I wasn't too impressed with the taste. South indian restaurants are raising their game in the Austin area, in general but Madras has some work to do. The big test is the sambar, which totally didn't cut it for me. It didn't have any flavors that stood out. The curries and vegetables were very oily and I felt super heavy even after eating not much. Of course they are using color and lot of oil \\nThe fried appetizers were nice but anyone can make good fried stuff. The dessert gulab jamun were probably the best from the lot. We ordered some dosas and they came out pretty quickly. However, soggy and no taste despite requesting crispy. I have had better at home with the store bought dosa batter. Masala was bland.

Tonight however was the worst restaurant service we have ever experienced. We had a group of 4 with two of us celebrating birthdays. With it being restaurant week we assumed it would be busier than normal so made a reservation. Our reservation was at 8 and although we were told we would get seated within 10-15 minutes of when we checked in, we weren't seated until 9:15 and were only seated after complaining about our wait. Once seated the waiter immediately took orders without us being able to look fully at the menu. Three of us ordered hibachi (two of which were from the restaurant week menu) and one ordered sushi from the restaurant week menu. The hibachi was incredibly rushed with none of the normal entertainment. It was very clear they were trying to rush through to get more people seated. After being given our hibachi meals the waiters disappeared. No one checked on the meals or refilled our waters or asked if we wanted another drink. We all had empty water glasses and had finished our beverages. The person in our party that ordered sushi did not receive his meal and after several attempts to tell waiters who didn't acknowledge us, I went out front to let the front desk staff know. At this point it was an hour after we sat down. He didn't receive his meal until after 10:20, long after we had eaten and the rest of the table had paid and left. They offered to comp his meal which was appreciated, but still no refill of water. When the check came we told them it was one of our birthday weeks (birthday deal on website says is valid for one free entree the week of your birthday). We had planned on telling wait staff this at the beginning of our meal but no one even gave us the chance. The waitress refused to honor the deal on the one non-restaurant week meal as they had \\"already comped a meal.\\" When I pointed out that they comped the meal that because he had waited an hour and a half for his dinner they said they couldn't \\"delete more than one meal.\\" We have never left a bad review or anything under a 20% tip, but this was horrible service. Hoping that this was just a (really) bad day and not the new norm at Osaka.

I personally decided to stick with the vegetarian options after seeing the large stacks of seafood sushi sitting without any temperature controls pre-made.   The service was actually pretty decent and the prices were not bad even with the quality in mind.   The way it works is you choose a plate of sushi that is labeled with a ring that is on a conveyor that travels around the entire restaurant.   The plates are different colors which indicate your prices.  After you finish eating your waiter will add up your plates and bring you the receipt.   There are also hot options, drinks, snacks and deserts.  \\n\\nAs others have mentioned, the cleanliness is questionable as well, lots of crumbs, stains and rice on the seats, tables and menus that were given to me.   \\n\\nSo overall - average to below average..But damn... the conveyor belt concept is just fun!"},{"name":"Banger's Sausage House & Beer Garden","address":"79 81 & 81.5 Rainey St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Absolutely a great time!

My ol man suggested Canoe. We went for a late dinner on 1/21/17, it was my first time dinning there and I was very impressed with the extensive menu. \\n\\nService: 5 stars: our waiter TERRY was fantastic. He was everything I could ever want in a waiter. He was engaging, knowledgeable, well traveled, adventurous eater, great sense of humor, made excellent recommendations, ensured our food would come out in a certain order (im particular), our drinks never went empty, and he knew that menu front and back. When I do come back I will be requesting him. I was on the fence about 3 dishes and I tried one of the ones he liked very much. \\n\\nAmbiance: 5 stars: we were sat with the view of the river (water) but it was dark and you really couldn't see it. The restaurant had nice decor and was dimly lit. There were a lot of people celebrating birthdays while we were there. Very calm and peaceful.\\n\\nAppetizers: 5 stars: everything was wonderful. We ordered appetizers of kangaroo (medium), 2 leek soups, and the crab cake. The crab cake was very moist and fresh, it wasn't weighed down with an oily taste. The leek soup was piping hot just the way I like it and very delicious especially when accompanied with the complimentary breads. The kangaroo was so effing good I contemplated ordering another plate to take home. Although cooked medium it had a nice peppery char on the edges. Kangaroo is very lean and tasty. I was skeptical to take my first bite but when I did the flavor exploded in my mouth. I would have to say kangaroo is my favorite meat besides lamb, it tastes WAAAAAAAAY better than steak or veal. Excellent, just excellent, I wish they had a kangaroo steak because I damn sure would've ordered it after having the appetizer. Next time I come I plan on ordering it rare. \\n\\nDinner: 5 stars: I ordered the duck cooked medium, being this is the second time I've had duck cooked medium, I think its nice but I think I will go for rare next time. The duck was very succulent, It took a long time for me to get into to duck because the skin is too human like. Working in a funeral home you see some things and it will turn you off from meat for a while lol anyhoo... I dared to get the duck and it quacked all the way to my tummy, very delicious. It also came with a duck leg croquet stuffed with sweet potato puree and Yukon gold puree and spinach with shitaki mushrooms, sumptuous meal indeed! My ol man ordered the rabbit. I thought is was very good, fork tender and seasoned well. It was accompany with swiss chard. No complaints with the food what so ever. \\n\\nDrinks: 5 stars: I wanted to order the Berlin mule but they don't have jaggermeister, Terry suggested I get the EN'JOY named after the inventor of the drink. It tasted like a spiked sprite with a hint of ginger. If you have a low tolerance for liquor it will get you tipsy with a slow creep up on you. My ol man ordered the TOM RIDDLE, that drink is meant to be accompanied by a fine cigar and smoking jacket. It will put some hair on your chest but smooth, diffinitely not for those who can't handle their liquor. \\n\\nDessert: couldn't order any because I was too damn full but Terry had me sold on the cracker jack dessert. They make butter popcorn flavored icecream from scratch and pair with house made cracker jacks. I was so full I thought I was going to pop, so I couldn't indulge in the deserts. I hope they keep that on the menu until I return. \\n\\nOverall: this restaurant has a upscale sophisticated crowd so you won't see any undesirables, riffraff, or the \\"income tax\\" crowd. I would recommend being dressed at least business casual. Not a restaurant to bring children but I did see a child there. I would call in advance to inquire about the children's menu or if they offer one. The food is great, the customer service was stellar, I did like how my ol man was addressed as mr. \\"Government name\\" by our hostess and wait staff. I have no complaints. I was a little concerned we would leave hungry because the food portions would be small, not the case! We staggered to the car like tweedle dum and tweedle dee full of exotic meats.

Fries are super tasty as well with a mixed up seasoning and crispy texture. Next time I will try the house made potato chips as I found out last time they are made to order. We also had a chicken sandwich that was spot on but we love the bomber too much to venture away from it. Woman with bowling pin tattoo was very welcoming on our first visit and is a bit part of the reason for return visits. The dudes that work there are super friendly and chill as well. Nice cold beer on tap, solid bloody and plenty of seating indoors and out.

It started off with the toilet. When maintenance arrived, they were not able to resolve it with equipment they had so they left to get more equipment. I left my room to go to the bar thinking by the time i got back, the issue would be resolved. Of course when i returned, no maintenance, and on the surface, it appeared to be resolved. Later that night, the toilet kept gurgling. It is like i would walk over to the toilet, and it would stop. As soon as I left the bathroom, gurgling came back. That was really weird. I slept through the night to wake up around 5a because the gurgling had returned. I flushed the toilet and sure enough it backed up again, shooting water out of the bowl. I called the front desk and they opened the room next door which was nice even though it was a pain for me. I was informed maintenance was would not be in for another hour so I went to the gym returning to the room at 7a. No maintenance yet. The toilet bowl of vengeance waiting my eager return. I thought I could at least take a shower....wrong. I started the shower, and walked away while it heated up. I realized after a minute, the water sounded awfully loud. I ran back into the bathroom, the water was backed up in the shower and the toilet of vengeance was gurgling again. I went back to the adjacent room to clean up. I chexked out shortly after 8a. I went down to complain again about the issue. There were 4 people there. Only the young lady who checked me out apolozied. But what should have happened is that they should have sent for the manager. The three other people who were just standing around listening, but i am sure were more experienced. They offered no help, no assistance. They failed. I had to call Marriott Hotel Customer service line  to get proper acknowledgment and resolution.

The food itself is really good - there's the classics like the Italian and the Heavyweight, but the meatball in particular is a standout - an open-faced sandwich of meat, spices, sauce, cheese and bread that's hard to resist.  The ingredients are clearly a cut above the Subway up the street, yet it's a real sweet-spot of quality and price, as the prices remain quite reasonable.\\n\\nAnd that segues into the other reason it's my favorite.  It's an everyman's sandwich shop.  You get construction workers, executives from Nationwide, people passing through the area for the day, and everyone in between.  And the owner will almost certainly know your name after your second or third visit - he even remembered me when it had been almost a year since my last visit, due to work reasons.  They get pretty busy during peak times - roughly 11:30 to 12:30 - but you'll always be greeted by name, and receive a fresh, delicious sandwich or soup.\\n\\nI don't make it down there as often as I used to now that I work a mile north, but I'd recommend it to anyone within walking distance, and still catch the bus down there occasionally myself."},{"name":"Royal China","address":"3295 Chamblee Dunwoody Rd","city":"Chamblee","stars":"3.5","text":"We really wanted to try out this new place; but such a disappointment after waiting for 45 mins for a table; the foods were cold and stale."},{"name":"Banger's Sausage House & Beer Garden","address":"79 81 & 81.5 Rainey St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Wow, this was seriously the best sausage I've ever had!

My boyfriend ordered the currywurst and fries! I cut a few pieces off of the sausage and when I bit into it, it was super flavorful, soft, and tender! It was so delicious. The currywurst was also tender, but didn't have as deep as a flavor, so I would recommend the bangers and mash.

So let's go ahead and work through some of Brioso's challenges so you can experience some deliciousness:\\n\\n* Parking:  It's downtown.  Just suck it up and do it.  It's worth it.  But here's a little tip - park down Pearl Alley right before you get to Brioso.  The meters there are longer, and there's almost always a spot there!  Also, Brioso has always been kind enough to break a dollar to give me quarters to park!\\n\\n* Crowd:  Don't go at noon. Seriously, don't do it.  Get there at 11:30 or don't go until 1:00.  Otherwise, you'll wait for a while and it'll be overcrowded with business people on their lunch breaks.\\n\\n* Restrooms:  They DO have them!  They're just hard to find.  Just go to the east side of the restaurant and head down the stairs.  \\n\\n* The grumpy girl:  She's kind of a bia.  And at first, it totally irked me.  Now, I find her endearing.  I play this little game every time I go in there; my goal is to make her smile at me!  \\n\\nNow that we've gotten those challenges out of the way, let's talk WHAT TO ORDER!  This is easy.  Get the fresh mozzarella sandwich!  Brioso bakes their own focaccia - that's not too dry or chewy and has giant chunks of salt on top!  Then, they pile on amazing fresh mozzarella and ripe, delicious tomatoes.  And the kicker?  Amazing homemade aioli!  This is seriously the best sandwich in Columbus.  \\n\\nWhat else to order?  Any of their soups.  They make them from scratch every day and never re-heat them!  I personally love their lentil soup.  \\n\\nAnd to round out your meal, get a peanut butter cookie.

Just get a damn cookie.  \\n\\nHave I convinced you to go to Brioso yet?"},{"name":"Ross Crepe & Cafe","address":"148 Chadwick Ct","city":"North Vancouver","stars":"2.5","text":"Standard box ice cream but great prices for the area.

Pizza sauce should have enough seasoning where it stands out but doesn't over power the rest of the pizza. I'm sure they use canned sauce. The cheese is bitter as well. I'm all for adding garlic powder on my pizza but how about a little salt and pepper next time too before you throw it in the oven.

Served with whipped basil cream cheese on the side.\\n\\nHouse Smoke salmon appetizer - although this was beautifully presented, it was my least favorite food.  The quality of the food was fine, I think there was an herb that I did not care for.  The description of the appetizer was not clear, so I'd ask the server what are all the ingredients before ordering\\n\\nGrilled Atlantic Salmon over spinach and spaghetti squash - the server was kind enough to split this meal into two dishes for me and my friend to share.  It was absolutely perfectly cooked and light sides to pair with.\\n\\nDessert - they have so many delicious sounding options that is was so hard to decide. I ended up getting the popcorn sundae because I've ready many reviews about it.  It was indeed delicious, how can you get ice cream, cracker jack popcorn and caramel wrong.

We came right after work on a Friday, I told the door guy a bunch of us were coming down and he told us that was no problem. When we walked in, we realized it is more of a solarium than a patio, with closed windows and really hot in there. It was still happy hour when we got there which was great, because this place normally charges like $9-$11 for a beer, so we thought we better get some orders while there was still a $5 happy hour option. The server wasn't around so I went to bar, and was charged regular price, to which I had to remind the bartenders it was still happy hour. This also created confusion with the server which was an unintended consequence. The server also told us we could get whatever beer we wanted for happy hour. So excitedly we put in another order. She then returned saying the beer I wanted was out, so I picked another beer. And then she came back another time to inform us that actually no, not all the beers were on happy hour.

This pod is nice, with a great selection of carts, though, I wish there was more covered seating.\\n\\nOn my maiden visit to Tidbit, I opted to try Ingrid's Scandanavian Food, having fond memories of the lefses at Viking Soul Food , now over on Belmont.\\n\\nAt Ingrid's, I ordered a lefse and the deep-fried meatballs.   The lefse has some pretty good ingredients.  Sheathed with a wrap (that is quite similar to a moo shu pancake), the inside contains cole slaw (or at least shredded cabbage), sausage and a creamy dressing.   This lefse was filling, and I especially like its sausage.  But the dill in the dressing was overpowering.  Also, when prepping the cabbage, Ingrid's left a lot of water behind on the cabbage.  This resulted in a drippy puddle quickly developing under the P√∏lse , and almost on my lap.\\n\\nMy order took a while to prepare, because the gal working there had to prepare a fresh batch of corn meal batter for the deep-fried meatballs.   But the tradeoff was that the five-star corn-dog like crust on the meatballs was fresh and tasty.  But to be honest, I did not like the spices in the meatballs.  At all.  They were strong and unrecognizable, perhaps faintly reminding me of cinnamon or cloves.   That was surprising because us Nordic types are rightfully accused of often preferring \\"bland\\" (or as I prefer, mildly spiced) food.\\n\\n3.3 stars."},{"name":"Habanero Mexican Grill","address":"166 Brighton Ave","city":"Allston","stars":"4","text":"I really liked this place.

My friend made a reservation and we were led to a large spacious table (even though we were only 2) which allowed us to take lots of photos for our Yelp reviews :) Dishes were tastefully presented and looked like each were given their due attention and care before being brought out to us. Service was prompt and friendly, and one of the owners, Wanda even came by to wish me a happy birthday. I still loved the uni pasta best although the tataki crudo was pretty good as well. the seaweed \\"chips\\" were quite unique.

Before I was able to sit down, and relax for a moment, the server asked for our ID. \\n\\nOrdinarily, this is not a problem, and doesn't happen as frequently due to the fact that I am 30 and my girlfriend is 32. Nevertheless, we fumble to get our ID's out, when my girlfriend realizes that she does not have hers because she switched her purse earlier in the day.\\n\\nThe server ushers us out of the bar as fast as she can, unapologetically telling us \\"rules are rules\\". We are a little caught off guard, but we comply to sit in the restaurant, where we are greeted by a new server... his name is Farmer and he tells us that we will be \\"all taken care of\\".\\n\\nHe asks us what we want to drink, and as we order.... none of us get carded. So we all order alcohol as previously planned, before our abrupt exit from the bar. \\n\\nWe order food and drinks despite the previous experience, and continued our conversation. 15-20 minutes go by when Farmer appears, and demands he see our IDs. We tell him that my girlfriend is 32 and does not have her ID and he takes the drink away and says \\"sorry, rules are rules\\". \\nAs we watch him walk away, we see our original server from the bar whispering to him as if she had solved the mystery and wanted to see justice. \\n\\nI do understand that there are rules and regulations in place for a reason. However, the unjust treatment, and disregard for service and hospitality was very unnecessary. We just could have been greeted in a better manner all around.\\n\\n\\nWe usually steer clear of mass produced establishments similar to this for many reasons.This lack of customer service, sincerity, and lackluster menu, reassures me that we are not missing anything.

Sure enough, right there, taped to the register, is an old, yellowed clip from the Statesman with the date cut out touting their Reuben as supreme.  The cook who took my order seemed to be annoyed he had to cook anything at all, but I felt a little better when I saw him smear the bread with mayo before grilling it.  The corned beef (which they brine there) and the sauerkraut all went onto the same griddle with the bread, and all came off at the same time.  Quickest damn sandwich I've ever ordered.  \\nNow, I should have read the menu a little closer and not just walked up and ordered, so its partially my fault, but when he rang me up for just the Reuben, I was hit with $11.67!  For a sandwich.  It was already made and sitting in front of me, so I took it, albeit with a scowl.\\nHere is the important part, though:  The fucking thing was sublime.\\nIt was huge, over a half pound, and I ate the whole thing.

What's going on?    People just have that much difference in taste or no taste at all?  Was the restaurant just having a rare bad day?  But on previous visits, I had pretty good experiences and would have rated this location pretty highly. So I am answering my own questions by admitting that now I understand.  Wednesday night's Door Dash delivery was just awful.  It was not the delivery at all which arrived faster than expected and the driver was so nice.    It was no fault of theirs which I thought originally.  I had just read an article which claimed 25% of food delivery drivers admitted that they have eaten some of peoples' food before arrival.  EWWW. But soon it was apparent that City BBQ just didn't care.  Here goes:  the worst was the side of baked beans, my favorite.  The appearance of the container made me gag and led to my first suspicion the delivery guy had gotten into it.  A dog getting into it would have eaten more cleanly.  No, this was the fault of someone who scooped it, spilled it, pressed the lid down on the container trapping the beans in the rim.  I will attach a photo of how it looked when it showed up.  There were very little beans because of the spillage plus there was a huge chunk of gristled, fatty pork lying across the entire bottom. They were cold.  In fact, the green beans were piping hot and delicious, yet the sweet potatoes, which were also sparse, were cold as well. The flavors were fine.  I also ordered sweet tea which was really too strong to drink.  And not cold.  Usually it's very good.  I'm still confused.  From my perspective, this location has gone downhill.  Or maybe there is just an employee who doesn't want to be there.  I went to Old Canal Smokehouse In Chillicothe which is, to me, what I wish City BBQ was.  The bbq is picked over and cleaned every morning - no fat, no gristle.  Their sides like the coconut onion rings are fresh and awesome.  Maybe it wouldn't hurt for the manager to take this crew on a field trip to show what pride in product, workmanship and a little caring can accomplish."},{"name":"Quincy Market","address":"4 S Market St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I'm so sad I only had less than an hour to walk around and check this place out.

This restaurant is designed along the lines of many contemporary quick-service (I hesitate to call them restaurants) places where you go to the counter to order your meal, step on down the line to pay your bill and collect your main dish, then move on to fill your drink cup and find a seat. This is a good one. \\n\\nJuan's features Mexican and California influenced fare, and everything is made to order right there behind the counter as you watch. Their appetizers range from chips & salsa (or dip) to chicken tortilla soup. They offer a ceasar salad and two chopped green salads, a number of items in the burrito, wrap, quesadillas and tacos categories, along with kid's meals, and a cookie is the dessert item offered.\\n\\nLea ordered the nachos, and I decided to experiment with the Thai Peanut Grilled Wrap, each of which was priced at 5.99. We also ordered self-serve fountain drinks (small 1.29, medium 1.69, large 2.09). Lea's nachos filled a full size dinner plate was piled high with cheese, chopped greens, black beans, sour cream, pico de gallo, and  guacamole. My Thai wrap was as long as long as the plate was wide, and either of the two could have fed two persons a light lunch easily. The wrap was shredded pork, rice, lettuce, crispy noodles and a delicate peanut sauce in a huge grilled tortilla. I was surprised when, after a couple of bites, I began to notice some heat in the back of my throat, but hadn't tasted anything spicy in the wrap. It was a delicious meal, and I enjoyed the delicate flavors in contrast to many of the overwhelming flavors often encountered in this type dish. \\n\\nThe facility itself was very nice; clean, not too noisy, and the self service counter where the condiments are kept was well stocked and clean. The cashier-host came to our table during our meal to see if we needed anything, and another young lady came from the kitchen area during our meal to see if we enjoyed the flavors of our meals, and any comments we might have to offer. It was a pleasant experience, and as we were leaving, we were given a frequent diner card with two meals already stamped. Buy eight, and get the ninth free (kids meals not included). It is worth a trip to give them a try. It's simple, fast, offers generous portions and is very tasty. We'll be back!\\n\\nThis restaurant is located in the Sunset Valley Homestead shopping center on Brodie, but if you turn off onto Ernest Roble Way, you can enter on the back (East) side of the shopping center, avoid a lot of congestion (and speed bumps), and Juan's is the first business on the right."},{"name":"B.J.

I'm here for the beer and all the rest is kinda secondary for me, mmk?\\n  With that out of the way, I can explain the ratings.The beer is great. Freshtastic. Sometimes amazing, even. But drinking the beer here, you are paying pretty much top dollar for Deschutes beer. You'd think they might have specials, or deals, or even reasonably priced pints, but newp. I guess I should back up a little bit and go over the vibe of this place.\\n  As soon as you walk in you notice the extravagant woodwork and extensive 'wood' vibe. In fact, lets call it WOOD, because holy christ they're trying to tell you how extremely northwest they are. \\"HEY, YOU'RE IN OREGON, HERE'S SOME WOOD!\\" Touristy is insufficient in summary but it'll have to do. Some people might enjoy it. If you can only make one brewery(ish) stop while in Oregon for your entire life, this wouldn't be a terrible choice. \\n  Once you look at the menu, and the food prices, you'll realize how they paid for all that nice woodwork. If you plan on eating a meal and having just a few pints it's going to top $30 a person. This is where I start to get grumpy, because the beer offerings aren't really that exclusive. They really aren't interested in their beer fans so much as their branding and that tourist dollar and I never really consider stopping here while out drinking beers in Portland because I can buy a 6 pack of 95% of the stuff they have on tap at Safeway. \\n  Oh, and they really don't brew an awful lot of beer here.

He didn't tell us about the sauce bar, then I read the menu again and noticed it talked about a sauce bar. So I didn't know about it until I was almost done eating. Also, as he was bringing out some of the meats that we ordered, some pieces fell off the plate onto the rolling cart or our table, and he used his bare hands to pick it up and put it back on the plate -- this happened at least 4 times. We also found hair on two different plates that we didn't notice until we had already put all the meat in our soup. When we brought it to his attention, he picked up the empty plate and casually just said \\"sorry, I can get you some more meat\\" but that shouldn't be the solution.

I rounded up for service, because the staff was pretty awesome.\\n\\nKeep in mind that the menu changes, so I won't go into detail about everything - you can look at my pictures.

Usually for deliveries I lower my expectations significantly, due to some terrible past experiences on Doordash, Ubereats, etc. I got my order from Doordash this time and it was perfect. Time said 50 minutes, but you know that means an hour, hour ten. Still hungry, I went for it. Ordered the following: \\n\\nGarlic Pita with Hummus or Tzatziki; \\nThe Doneras Platter\\nMeat Choice: Beef\\n\\nIt came around 50 minutes passed (surprisingly close to their estimated time), the driver was cold but the food was HOT! I expected the pita to be soggy since they didn't cut out a corner on the to-go container for the hot air to escape (essentially, steaming the ingredients inside; ruining them complely). I honesty prefer food to be cold than soggy, but somehow they freaking NAILED it. \\n\\nAn aroma of strong toasted garlic could be detected from outside the plastic bag I received said food. When opened, it revealed a potent aroma of garlic and grilled meat with strong notes of spices. The pita was thin but had that soft-carby texture you just want to BITE into. Maybe I was carb deprived, I enjoyed these a little too much with the tzatziki sauce (you can opt for hummus if you want). Opened up the beef platter. It consists of Beef on top of flavored rice with some tzatziki and salad. Constitution seems normal enough and pretty standard. The difference i noticed was in the salad. GREAT feta (no olives though.. sadface), FRESH produce. I usually pick out the tomatoes but it was ripe and delicious this time. To be honest, the rice, the sauce on top of the meat are really salty and overpowering (maybe you'll like it but sodium wise it's gonna be WAY over your daily values for one meal). If i had known before,I would have opted for just regular white rice and no sauce on top. Either way, now that I know - I can order it as such next time. I prefer less sodium-loaded foods because it makes you extremely thirsty afterwards.  \\n\\nI'm looking forward to actually going to the restaurant to enjoy their food on site. With the food-togo was this good, you gotta wonder - how good is it when its HOT and FRESH? and knowing the sodium factor, I can opt for healthier options next time. \\n\\nAlbeit saltiness, the food was excellent (mind you, this is through a delivery app). Next time I get a Mediterranean or Mid East craving, i'm gonna go to this place first. I don't want to talk crap about other places but... sometimes you're just throwing money away at garbage.

The result was a half cup of liquid and the rest foam, all the while less than welcoming service.

I asked about them being complimentary and the waitress said she cudnt fix the bill now. When she brought the samosas she said she wud return with the chutney, which she never did. Also on the buffet one item was labeled bengan bartha which is supposed to be eggplant. But it was chicken in a red gravy with no sign of any eggplant.

The beef briwat was served with a spiced tomato dipping sauce that added another wonderful layer of flavor. The merguez tagine had sausage, olives, eggs, and tomato sauce.

I showed it to my friend and he was looking through he pictures on yelp and he says \\"OMG everything looks so good! I don't know what to order\\". I didn't think much of it, I just said \\"Okay, let's go\\".\\n\\nSo when we get there on a Friday night, it was poppin' but we didn't have to wait for a table. I love that they have a pretty big parking lot to themselves as well. I was pretty skeptical because as we walked in, only the hostess was asian. I was thinking, oh no... we walked into a white-washed asian place, it's not going to taste good. \\n\\nStill with skepticism, I look at the menu and ordered a lychee black tea ($2.50) as my drink. YUM!! After I tasted it, I was like okay, okay. I have a pretty good start to this dinner. I was savoring it because I thought it wasn't free refills, but it IS! I'm happy!\\n\\nWhen come time to order, we had no idea what to get. My original plan was to go on a food tour of Orlando (meaning eat a little bit of this and a little bit of that from different restaurants). My friend ordered the Pad Thai, and this was where I gave him the lecture. \\"WHAT? YOU'RE GOING TO GET PAD THAI HERE? You can get pad thai anywhere, and especially back at home where it's more authentic!\\" So he wanted to change his mind but I told him to order that anyway and we can order other things that we don't normally see back home. \\n\\nWe first ordered the chicken wings with honey Sriracha sauce and pad thai and they came out. WOW, I must give it to him... the pad thai was DELICIOUS! I stand corrected. The wings was also good! Right now I'm thinking, I'm sorry I ever doubted you. \\n\\nWe also ordered 2 other dishes: Hokkein Mee and Malaysian Prawn Mee. Both were good but not as good as the Pad Thai. The Hokkein Mee is another noodle dish that wasn't spicy but pretty flavorful. I added chili oil and Sriracha to add a kick. The Malaysian Prawn Mee was a soup and it's pretty spicy (but not really). The spice got stuck in my throat and I kept coughing, it sucked. \\n\\nPrices were reasonable. DEFINITELY RECOMMEND THIS PLACE!

There's a salad bar and a counter where they make things like sandwiches. It would be one of my favorite places to go when I'm in Columbus. The reason it's not is because of the high prices.

I've been drinking Deschutes' stuff for years, and even though I still have no idea how their name is pronounced, their craft has been kind to me time and time again. So while we may not strictly be on a first-name basis, I'm a fan of their output. And when the opportunity came to grab lunch at their brewery, it seemed like a no-brainer, like making a pilgrimage to the promised land of liquid delight. That the food, service and experience all combined to make for a five-star visit is just an added benefit.\\n\\nWe stopped in here on a Monday during lunch, and the place was absolutely swamped. You could not really tell upon walking into the main entrance, but after peeking around the hostess desk, the bar and dining room areas were jammed with businessmen, tourists, students and every other walk of life you can imagine. But here's the interesting part from my point of view: despite there being approximately 70,000 people in the same room, you could still clearly hear yourself and whoever you were talking to - this was a far cry from many loud nights out in the DFW area. The hostess offered us a patio table and we took it. With a quick walk around the building to the gathering of tables, we prepared ourselves for the Deschutes experience.\\n\\nOur server, Dana (I think...?), was over to greet us and guide us through the surprisingly varied menu. Not only was he able to answer our questions about the menu (and the city), but he had a perpetually friendly energy about him, keeping him upbeat and engaging as he moved from table to table outside.\\n\\nBecause I'm a sucker for gimmicks, I had to order the Black by Hopular Demand in honor of the approaching eclipse. Like everything else this place puts out, the beer was phenomenal and I would be disappointed if I have to wait until 2024 to try this again if it really is tied to the duration of the next eclipse.\\n\\nBut the food was just as satisfying, too. Really, the most difficult decision was deciding what to order and what to put on the proverbial \\"rain check\\" list for the next visit. We started with a sausage appetizer that, while delicious, really came into its own when coupled with the mustard on the plate. Oh man, that was a tough opening act to follow. Nonetheless, we did our best with a veggie plate rounded out by a crisp and flavorful variety of bites, a spicy chicken and waffles plate that played tug-of-war between sweet and fiery deliciousness, and one of the best mac and cheese orders I have ever had. (Despite sounding like it was a heart attack on a plate, it was surprisingly light and not at all compromising when it came to tasty divinity.)\\n\\nAround this time, I hopped up to use the bathroom and I got a better look at the dining room behind the entrance. The entire area is wide open, with tables splitting off into every direction: booths, tables, high tops, etc. The kitchen area and line are along the back wall, and I imagine it gets a little hectic with the staff trying to run food and tourists like me wandering around trying to figure out if the neon sign pointing to the restroom is, in fact, where the restrooms are. (Spoiler alert: that's exactly where they are.) Honestly, the interior reminds me of a BJ's, only not trying as hard and brightly lit.\\n\\nIt's easy to write a place like this off as \\"good... for bar food.\\" I would not hesitate to say this is \\"good... for any food.\\" Yeah, you can toss back appetizers at the gigantic bar until the cows come home, but you could also have a low-key date night here, celebrate your parents' anniversary or stop by for a quick lunch. It's an environment that welcomes all kinds of visitors for all kinds of purposes, and the food, service and selection make it very easy to recommend."},{"name":"Xhibit Studio Kitchen & Bar","address":"1414 W Peachtree St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Honestly I wanted to like this establishment, especially since the Canopy staff was so warm and friendly. The only staff members at Xhibit that were friendly were a bartender named Britney and a gentlemen staff member whose name I didn't catch, but he was working the breakfast shift on October 6th. Very friendly guy. However, the server, whose name I don't recall... decided to hand myself and my husband our tab before we were done. She didn't ask if we needed anything or how the service was, she also didn't give the couple next to us their tab. Here's the backstory. My husband and I received 2 complimentary breakfast coupons and I was at the restaurant first and my husband came 10 min after me. I had told the nice gentle man I had a complimentary breakfast coupon for 2. I'm not sure if he relayed the message to the server who gave us our tab. But she gave us a receipt that had the balance of 0.00 crossed off and replaced it with the cost of one breakfast. Which was about 20 something dollars to which she wrote that amount by hand. Instead of her asking she assumed we were trying to pull a fast one on her and it made me feel pre judged and not welcomed. Next time... I'd appreciate if the servers communicate, greet, and provide proper service prior to assuming you are trying to get a free meal.

I went there for a quick, relatively inexpensive lunch that turned out to cost just as much as anywhere else in Brookline Village. If you're going to almost automatically add sour cream & guac, you should tell your customers that it costs extra. I know, I know, guac always costs extra.

Might as well have gone to Cutty's. \\n\\nSo being the adaptable human that I am, the next time I came I refused the sour cream & guac. What happened? They overcharged me! $18 instead of $8.

We were celebrating my friend's 25th birthday, and were introduced to a selection of the Specials and the Omelets and French toast as highlights by both Mike and our server. \\n\\nService: Our server smiled, was able to help my friend order an omelette with the added ingredient of chicken, and order side pancakes. I wish at this point he had emphasized to us how large the plates were going to be, because she asked for 2 side pancakes, which turned out to be almost 8\\" in diameter, much larger than her already large portioned omelette and sides of French Toast. \\nMy other friend and I each ordered the Chicken and Waffles and a side of French Toast (regular, not the delight) to split.\\n\\nFood: \\nChicken and Waffles ($12) - I was severely disappointed by this. As a special, I was expecting to be wowed, and I was happy to try the waffles that other customers had raved about, but honestly the chicken was so dry, with such poor stand-alone flavor, that it completely ruined the dish for me. I could not even taste the waffles after how difficult it was to eat the chicken. The chicken was a TENDER, and I wish it was a Boned Chicken, which I did not realize having only glanced up at the TV explaining the Specials. \\nEven pouring maple syrup (which I sparsely do), and adding butter could not save this dish, and almost made the chicken worse in my opinion. It was a sad experience, as I would have hoped for this to be a killer.\\n\\nBecause I had struggled to even finish the chicken and the waffle, I had gotten to my French Toast side after it had sat out for some time, and it was no longer warmed. The taste was mediocre at best and my mouth and taste buds were just so disappointed with the chicken, that I think the excitement for the french toast was just not there. \\n\\nI will admit, the French Toast was airy and texturally was sound, but it was not a home run to win me over the Chicken experience. \\n\\nMy friend also agreed about her chicken and waffles experience. And she simply packed up the french toast. My other friend with her omelette enjoyed it, but hardly touched the regular toast, and hardly made a dent in her pancake orders.\\n\\nEach of our plates came with a slice of orange, which was a nice touch, I will admit\\n\\nThings I would have wished for: \\n-At the end of eating, we did get boxes and bags for our many leftovers, but the owner Mike had come to our table before we even paid our bill (but after our plates were cleared) to ask if we had finished with our waters.

I personally was taken aback by this as most restaurants will wait to touch drinks until patrons stand up and exit. \\nI wish we were not rushed in this unusual manner.\\n-I wish I had known the chicken and waffles was a tender instead of on the bone, and that it was not as dry as it was.\\n-I wish our server had told my friends and I about portion sizes and to advise us on how much to order preemptively.\\n\\nTips/Takeaways:\\n-Honestly, based on my poor standing with the chicken and waffles and the fact that I traveled over an hour to reach this place, I would not particularly feel inclined to venture back again.\\n-Self-serve coffee, please feel free to go directly indoors to grab some as you wait in line under the heat lamps\\n-Would NOT recommend return\\n-Would NOT order an extra side based on how large a normal portion is"},{"name":"Basil Thai","address":"2501 W Parmer Ln, Ste 550","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"So filling and delicious!

I definitely appreciated the use of fish with no bones (other Asian restaurants tend to think the opposite *chokes*). The sliced beef in courses 1-4 was the same rare eye round meat that's served in pho (noodle soup). Everything was well-marinated and decent portion; spring roll ingredients were fresh.

My mouth was so full I couldn't answer him. I nodded and my daughter's boyfriend said, 'yes' for me.  I literally finished chewing the mouthful, reached for my glass of water to swallow the rice and the waiter flew in and grabbed my unfinished plate off the table and asked if we wanted dessert. We weren't over staying. I realize the place was busy, but this was kind of rude. We asked for the check and went next door for dessert. I don't know if I'd eat here again.

I don't expect anything more than to be served food at a Vietnamese restaurant but we got slammed with all 7 courses on the table while we were still cooking our 2nd course.  For those that had to cook they were unable to get to all of the food while it was still hot.  We also felt rushed by the rush of plates being dropped on our table.  In fact we had to grab food off one plate to make room for another while the server waited.

It's a family standard to head here Sunday afternoons for a big bowl of Pho and a huge, fried catfish.  The restaurant is small and pretty tightly packed but all that matters is the food.  \\n\\nMy go-to's are the fresh spring rolls, salt and pepper calamari, tofu salad for appetizers, and then a large Pho 2000 and a fried catfish for entrees.  The spring rolls are always perfectly balanced with shrimp, pork, vermicelli and mints.  The peanut sauce compliments it perfectly and these are always a crowd pleaser.  The calamari here is by far my favorite of any restaurant.  Lightly fried and tossed with spices and peppers, you get a good kick with every bite.  This dish is not too heavy and I recommend it to anyone that comes to Pho 2000.  I'm not a huge tofu fan but whatever they do to this tofu is magic.  The combination of the freshness of the greens and the seasoning/marinade they use on the tofu makes this dish packed full of flavor.  The broth in the Pho 2000 is the best I've had.  I'm a bare bones guy so I rarely add any Sriracha or plum sauce and the straight flavor of the broth is perfect for me.  They give you a good amount of meat and noodles.  This bowl is sure to make you happy and ready to take a nap.  The fried catfish varies in size but it is always a meaty, lightly fried catfish that is very fresh.  If you like to go above and beyond, they bring you all of the accoutrements so you can make your own rolls with sprouts, herbs, apple, etc.  I tend to eat the catfish straight with some rice and plum sauce but any iteration of it is delicious. \\n\\nYou can't go wrong with anything you get here.  The service is friendly.  Not always prompt but it's easy to flag them down or just go to the front so I can't complain too much.

If I had to nitpick, it would be that the red velvet cake has the wrong frosting. I know, everyone puts cream cheese frosting on their cakes these days, but it isn't as good as the ermine frosting. Just look at recipes from before the late 80s and you won't find a mention of cream cheese frosting on a red velvet cake.\\n\\nI have also gone to Southern Sweets for lunch a few times. My first sandwich was ok, but this last time I had a fried egg sandwich and I thought it was perfect. The balance of egg, bread and veggies was spot on. Most egg sandwiches omit the veggies and I think that is a mistake.\\n\\nSince I'm a tea drinker, I get tea there, but I don't find them to be a great place for tea.

But I really have to hand it to Osaka! \\n\\nThe Atmosphere\\n\\nFirst, this is not a place to go for a quiet, romantic meal, and I don't think that was the owner's intention either. \\n\\nThe place is loud and excited and the chefs are constantly yelling, \\"More Sake, More Fun\\" as they take a squirt bottle, filled with sake, and shoot it into the spectator's mouths as they sit while the chef cooks the food. At some tables, counts start and you can hear them \\"1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...\\" and I heard someone make it all the way up to 21. That's an impressive feat, mind you. And don't worry, you don't pay for the sake...it's complimentary.\\n\\nThe Service\\n\\nI read prior reviews before going and many people complained of their server's inability to speak English. Not only was that NOT our experience, our chef greeted everyone in Japanese, Mandarin, Spanish, and French. Oh, and English. \\nThey kept my water filled the entire time and were very efficient in bringing out food. The place was packed and I didn't sense any lag in service.\\nThere are a couple people here and there that had trouble with English (lady at the front) but right next to her was someone who spoke English fluently to help out.\\n\\nThe Performance\\n\\nLike every Hibachi place, the Chefs are fancy with their utensils, quick, and accurate. They do the typical \\"onion volcano\\" to show off their fire skills, and they also do the \\"spinning egg on the spatula\\" trick to break the eggs. Our chef also did the fake bottle spraying in your face trick. \\nWhere the chefs go above and beyond is in the rest of their performance. I already told you about the sake, but rather than start off just by doing fanciful tricks with their forks and spatulas, they begin drumming a beat. The songs they use vary. I heard the chefs singing \\"We will, we will, rock you\\" and then I heard one singing \\"Take me home tonight.\\" \\nSome chefs do more the more excited the table is.\\nGOLDEN RULE FOR GOING HERE: If you show the chefs that you are having a ton of fun, they will try that much more to make you laugh and be amazed. Our crowd was relatively boring and we didn't realize this until our chef went to the next table over filled with college students. HUGE difference.\\n\\nThe Food\\n\\nFor our meal, we ordered the \\"Filet Mignon\\" and the \\"Filet Mignon and Chicken.\\" (I know, a lot of variety there...). Each hibachi meal came with Salad, Fried Rice, cooked vegetables and a two-piece shrimp appetizer. While we waited for our chef, we enjoyed two pieces of high-grade Salmon Sushi.\\n\\nThe salad was good, but nothing out of the ordinary of your typical Hibachi/ Tepenyaki place. The Fried Rice was pretty plain, but tasted amazing. It contained egg, a tiny bit of onion, and rice and is cooked in front of you on the grill. The vegetables could have been cooked a little longer so they absorbed the flavors better, but they were still awesome.\\n\\nThe shrimp was pretty delicious as well, but I'm not that big a fan of shrimp so I will stop talking about that here.\\n\\nNow to my favorite food part...the steak and chicken. These Filets are no joke...they were big in size and the quality rivaled the best steak house I've ever eaten at in Texas. The chicken was well trimmed and tasted delicious. The chef's means of cooking the chicken allowed it to soak up a lot of flavor. With that said, I would likely just stick to the Filet next time...\\n\\nWe were celebrating a birthday, and so at the end of our meal they brought out a Fried Ice Cream dessert topped with whipped cream and a candle. The Happy Birthday song is simple and is in English. The fried ice cream tasted like any other fried ice cream that I've had, and I still can't find a way to describe it other than ice cream wrapped in funnel cake. The ice cream color is green, but tastes like vanilla.\\n\\nThe BILL\\n\\nThe Sushi was under $5. We ordered two cokes for a seemingly cheap price of $1.50 per coke. Neither of us got refills, so I don't know if they are free or not. The Filet Mignon is priced at $24.95 and the Combo Filet Mignon and Chicken is also $24.95. The fried ice cream was free for the birthday girl.\\nThe final total for two people was $66 (pre-tip). I tipped the typical 20% and called it a night. \\n\\nOverall assessment:\\n\\nThis is a great place to go and have FUN. It is not a place for romantics trying to have some alone time. The experience is heightened by your willingness to drink their free sake. You gotta try this out."},{"name":"Leroy and Lewis Barbecue","address":"121 Pickle Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Highly fatty, highly delicious.

Super popular brewery located in Bend, and this restaurant is literally always poppin, a good go-to if you're visiting Portland or friends are visiting to do touristy things. A little quick blurb about the brewery (they have beers sold like all over the country, and all the classics are served at their restaurant in Portland) - it's amazing! My favorite is the Black Butte Porter, and everything else they have is great too.  Honestly, if you dine here, there's a little something for everyone.\\n\\nHave probably been here 10-15 times, a solid place to take your family, chill in the bar area with your friends in the evening, I even took a professor here for a midterm evaluation conversation.\\n\\nDuring peak dinner hours, IT GETS PACKED - wait is about 45 mins especially on weekends - but earlier in the day it's not too bad. Outdoor seating in the summer is also really great, and they have garage-door type style walls that come up and let in some sun if you're sitting against the walls on the inside.\\n\\nI'll comment on everything I've ever ordered here (peep my pics for details)\\n\\nFor reference: I'm a 5'3'' Asian woman with the appetite of an average man. \\n\\nBacon & Bleu salad - very tasty - bleu cheese, arugula, bacon bits (that are actually super tender yum), strawberries, candied walnuts. SUPER GOOD, and you don't feel gross even though it has tons of bacon because well, it's a salad. The half size is a decent portion if you're trying to taste more food as well.\\n\\nFlights - I love getting the classic 1-6 (Pacific Wonderland, Mirror Pond Pale Ale, American Wheat, Black Butte Porter, Fresh Squeezed IPA, Twilight Ale) - especially if a friend who's never had Deschutes or has never visited Portland is trying it - it just has something in it for everyone (like if you don't really like dark beers, IPAs, etc, there's something in this flight for you, or even if you do!)\\nYou can also mix and match your own 6 to create your own flight from their beer menu. Peep my pic for the cute board it comes out in.\\n\\nI've had the Meathead pizza before - and honestly it's just okay. I personally don't think the pizza is the best thing at Deschutes, but it's an option you have if you're really set on pizza. It was just okay when I had it for dinner, and it was also just okay when i had it reheated the next morning (you know what I mean, sometimes pizza is super good the next day reheated).\\n\\nCharcuterie board - good and solid size if you're using it as an appetizer to split between like 3-4 people. They have really good mustard (still in seed form and pretty potent) that comes with the meat and cheese. I'm not a huge pickled vegetable person but it comes with some pickled carrots and other veggies, some great salami, toasted crackers, and cheese. I would say it's a solid 3/5 stars for this dish.\\n \\nVibes: Bar area can get crowded but waiters are super nice if you flag them down, if it's super crowded - bring your receipt up to the bar area, it's just faster. Also if you're waiting for your table, chill in the bar area so you can get some beers and order some quick food while you're waiting for your table. They're super nice about it if you tell your host to just transfer your tab over to your table.\\n\\nVibes: hip, fun framed and non framed decor all around, really bright and lively place, kind of the of a brewery but also tons more family and people in general. Super central location, so parking is a bit of a challenge, so I always ubered or walked.\\n\\nThey also sell merchandise here! Shirts/ sweaters/ bottles at the front near the host station. Staff is all really nice too, I've never had rude service here.\\n\\nAlso, I don't have a picture of it but the mac n cheese is DELICIOUS. The noodles are HUGE and it comes with sun dried tomatoes - hefty size and you'll def be carb full! \\n\\n$$: overall, I think the pricing matches what you're getting - it's solid food, really great service, clean bathrooms. There's a reason why it's always so crowded, and it's worth the 30 min wait (but maybe not like a 1 hour wait, Portland has so many great places where it's always okay to come back at a less busy hour!)"},{"name":"Mission on the Bay","address":"141 Humphrey St","city":"Swampscott","stars":"3.5","text":"Very good delicious place nice people delicious food one of my favorite things was the Thai ribs very recommended delicious also got a burger very delicious but pretty burnt other from that very good place and totally recommend for seafood lovers"},{"name":"Hawkers Asian Street Food","address":"1103 Mills Ave N","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"So far so fricken good!

They give you the option to choose your spicy level which is nice too. The chicken lo mein, fried rice, and cream cheese wontons are awesome too! I wish they would deliver a few more miles outside their designated radius. I'm like less than a mile outside of it so that's unfortunate for me but I still make the drive out there.

I ordered the summer tomato salad (remarkable!), a pork dish with \\"grilled\\" peaches, and the ever-popular (for me) lemon gingersnap tart.  Although the pork was of excellent quality and perfectly prepared, there was missing the signature flavor complexity of past dishes I have enjoyed at the restaurant.  No discernible acid component.  The peaches did not seemed to be grilled.  It was a good dish, but lacked for me the special something that one normally gets from a dish at this restaurant.  Also, what have they done with the wonderful gingersnap tart they used to serve?  And why did they serve that poor imitation instead?

My husband, step son, grandchildren, and grandson's girlfriend got to spend 2 hours together on a rainy Sunday afternoon having lunch and making jokes about the food and service mistakes. It was a very big joke. This is suppose to be an upscale place. What happened? Mussel app ordered as being shared by 2. Served as 1 with no share plate, no fish cocktail forks, and no  shell plate.  How to  share?  App of croissants ordered and delivered. Meh. Others in town much better. We ordered side salads and 2 out of 3 were good. Their blue cheese dressing is excellent. So sad salad dressing was high light of meal. We ordered 1 hamburger steak dinner with greenbeans. Grandson liked it. We ordered 4 cheeseburgers and 1 regular burger. All 5 sent back as way overcooked. Over well done. Took forever to get new plates and burgers still not correct but we ate them anyway. If you don't want to sell burgers at an upscale casual place then don't have them on the menu. Had a side of corned beef potato salad and it was tasteless. French fries were good but, not as good as the blue cheese dressing.So after spending 1 and a half hours having a mess of a lunch here comes the waiter with the usual offer of FREE dessert. We all ordered. Really took at least 15 to 20 minutes to get the dessert. Unbelievable! Husband had hot apple pie and ice cream and loved it. Stepson had ice cream, gluten free. They have nothing to make a sundae. The rest was brownie and ice cream.....take a cheap premade brownie product, melt a whole cheap Hershey bar on top, add a scoop of mediocre vanilla ice cream next to it in a cold bowl, hope the customer either has been drinking lots or doesn't know the difference and serve it after placing all of the dessert spoons into the middle of the table. A little self service for all.  btw...look over the customers and decide they don't know better, but I do. Send over a newbie trainer by himself to clear the table. He has no clue what to do.

Getting our food took forever too even tho the place was half empty. No idea how they manage to stay in business charging $60 for one meal and an appraiser and drinks, all of which are beyond disappointing...

I had heard so many great things and was beyond hyped to try it. An Instagram post showing off their double wagyu cheeseburger was what enticed me to finally come check the restaurant out. The burger looked incredible in the photo and I made reservations immediately. We walked in and were seated promptly. Our server was awkward to interact with at times and never really even asked us if we were ready to order. She made small talk and then gave us a blank stare which was followed by an uncomfortable silence. After 10 seconds or so we just started listing our orders to break the silence. Weird. When the burger arrived it looked exactly like it did in the Instagram post, which gave me high hopes. My hopes burned and went straight to hell as soon as I took my first bite. Both patties were cooked 5 levels over \\"well done\\" and were almost completely a charred black color. To make this worse, the entire burger was so salty that I physically could not force myself to take another bite after a while. I know for a fact this was not a one-off mistake because we ordered three of these and they were all identical. The fried potatoes that came on the side were really difficult to eat and were accompanied by an extremely confusing condiment that looked like raspberry preserves but tasted like corn. At the end of our meal our server actually forgot about the desserts we ordered, which turned out to be a blessing in disguise because we were ready to get out of there ASAP. I'm glad the food was a special price due to it being the restaurant's anniversary. I would have rammed my head through a wall if I had paid full price for such a low quality dining experience. Literally ANY fast food burger gushing with GMOs would have been better. The two individuals at the host's stand were so friendly but the rest of this visit was a complete nightmare."},{"name":"Dil Se Indian Cuisine","address":"1201 SW Jefferson St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Beautiful ambience.

Fair warning the omakase courses don't really change though if you ask the staff and chefs do try to make accommodations and substitutions. Make sure you make a reservation!! They don't have a huge amount of seating and they are very popular. \\n\\nFirst course was an appetizer of himachi, yellowtail in a wonderful soy sauce based liquid. \\n\\nSecond course was the rock shrimp two ways since we had two people. There were about four huge shrimp per serving, one was deep fried and the other was deep fried and then covered in a marinade a la fried chicken? This was actually the only course we weren't crazy about just because the shrimp was deep fried so I thought it masked the flavor of the shrimp a little and filled us up when there were still a lot of courses to go. The second time we went they actually were able to replace this with a scallop dish that was amazing! It came in a litte stone bowl over a little fire that cooked the dish in front of us. \\n\\nThird course was the main course of bass two ways a black bass and a chilean sea bass that had been pre marinated for weeks apparently and both were so amazing. This was probably the best fish I have ever had. The fish itself was so tender and fatty but the marinade was very delicate. Definitely savored these dishes and their melt in your mouth quality. \\n\\nFourth course was nigiri of a variety of preparations, a little more modern with little sauces on top of each nigiri. These were very interesting. \\n\\nI don't remember if there was a sashimi course... if there was it would be here.\\n\\nLast was dessert course, these are seasonal/based on what the pastry chef is making I think. First time was a plum based pudding type dessert. Second time was green tea flavor. Overall great experience, great service, great ambiance. If you think about the value of the meal it actually isn't that expensive.. We had about five courses for $120, if you were to order everything a la carte it would come out to be a bit more. \\n\\nParking is a little tricky because Umi is actually tucked into a building.

Most importantly, though, the food I got was underwhelming.  I got the vegetable pasta because it was the only vegetarian entree on the menu.  I knew I was in trouble when I saw only one acceptable meal and that meal was far less glamorous than the meat dishes (e.g., rabbit and north-GA trout).  It didn't taste terrible, but it did taste like something that could easily be whipped up at home.

The taste and texture is really similar to two toasted tortillas sandwiched together, it even bubbles between the layers like so. The cinnamon strips which are made from their signature crust really highlights the similarity to a tortilla. Essentially it tasted like a toasted tortilla with some sugar and cinnamon sprinkled ontop with a runny caramel dipping sauce on the side, maybe not their finest of concoctions. A deep fry would certainly change the game on that one. Otherwise the pizza itself tastes decent, nothing burnt, maybe a little conservative on the spread.

Joy's totally lives up to the hype! I see why they were voted \\"Best of Atlanta\\" and showcased on \\"Diners, Drive-ins and Dives.\\" I just hope they expand their restaurant someday because it gets pretty tight in there. It's such a tiny little establishment! \\n\\nWe decided to try our luck with Joy's for brunch after church on Sunday. I say \\"try our luck\\" because we've tried to eat at Joy's once or twice in the past but always got turned off by the long lines. But, this time finally, we got in the door. The hostess said it would be a 45min wait which is a very long time for me when I'm hungry and usually I would leave but I'd  heard such good things about JC I had to stick it out. \\n\\nI love that Joy's but only texts you when they're ready for you but you can also track your party's position online. I must admit we checked every five minutes or so. We waited almost exactly 45 minutes before our text came through. But when we got back to Joy's we still had to wait about 5-7 mins until we were finally seated in the back of the restaurant. \\n\\nJC gives their customers sweet treats to nibble on while they wait for the food. These treats vary. I saw some cinnamon rolls and other types of sweet buns on other tables , but we got two scones. The scones were good except the cranberries inside were tear-producing-ly sour, didn't enjoy that part but the scones themselves were tasty.\\n\\nThe food came out super fast despite the crowd. I was surprised when I got my order because the plate they put in front of me looked nothing like any biscuits and gravy I'd ever had. The gravy is a brownish-peach color instead of white; and after ladling the gravy on top of the biscuits, they add another layer of chunky sausage on top. Very unique. Turns out, the biscuits and gravy also tasted nothing like any I've had in the past either. It was mildly sweet and pretty spicy...bordering on too spicy for me since I'm not a fan of spicy food, but it was honestly delicious! I read another review that said you get used to the \\"sweetness\\" after a while and they were right. It was sweet enough to be interesting but not sweet enough to be off putting. I kept eating and found that I really enjoyed it. The scrambled eggs that accompanied the dish were cooked to perfection--not runny and not dry and overcooked--just perfect! \\n\\nMy wife ordered the shrimp and grits and couldn't stop raving about them. I tried her food as well and could see why. Grits were creamy and smooth and they were generous with the plump, juicy shrimp and sweet corn kernels they piled on top.The flavor was incredible!\\n\\nWe decided we couldn't leave without ordering a slice of the milk and cookies pie that looked so good on Yelp. We were not disappointed. It tasted like chocolatey cookies layered between sweet, fluffy clouds.

We knew that the restaurant was undergoing renovations but our local newspaper reported that Caf√© Margaux would remain open during remodeling.  We made an advance phone reservation for noon. We all found convenient street parking close by the Caf√©.  On arrival, we were instead escorted over to the Ulysses Prime Steakhouse, their equally outstanding sister restaurant also adjacent to Belair Courtyard.  Our table was set up for us inside Ulysses.  This was the first time that I have been to Ulysses so this was a real treat for me.  Ulysses is usually closed for lunch.    \\n\\nWe were graciously greeted at the entrance and escorted to our table, which was dressed in bright white linens.  The intimate dining area where we sat opens directly onto the street.  I did not see Ulysses' second dining area.   The interior is pleasantly appointed with a more masculine ambiance than the more elegantly adorned Caf√© Margaux with its heavy ornate drapes and multi layered dressed tables.  Soon after we settled at our table, our beverage orders were taken.  Two of us ordered a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon; the others shared a bottle of White Zinfandel. Our drinks were very refreshing and promptly served.   Jamie and Dragon were our servers and I cannot praise them enough for their professionalism, un-intrusive attentiveness and seamless exemplary service.  \\n\\nWe all ordered from the Caf√© Margaux Lunch Menu.  Four of us chose the Fillet Mignon B√©arnaise, $19; one diner chose Saut√©ed Escargots, $15 and another ordered the Veal Marsala, $19.  The entr√©es included either Soup of the Day or House Salad.  My Sherry Cream of Wild Mushroom Soup was served hot in a lovely bowl and tasted so incredible.  Three other women who ordered this soup were equally impressed.   Another diner said that her (award winning) Tomato & Basil Bisque Soup was so delicious.   The woman who ordered the House Salad said it was fine, too.  We were served tasty warm garlic bread in a basket with our first course and the server soon refilled the empty basket.  \\n\\nAccompanying my Fillet Mignon B√©arnaise, which arrived rare as ordered, were mashed potatoes and a unique side of shredded carrots mix.  The Saut√©ed Escargots entr√©e was served over angel hair pasta with garlic butter spinach, basil and macadamias.  Veal Marsala was veal cutlet in a Marsala Sauce with crimini, shiitake & white mushrooms. Everything was hot and so delicious; we all enjoyed our meals immensely.  \\n\\nOur server later brought out an artfully arranged platter of very decadent cakes & pies.  Although we were all full by this time, we were all tempted to enjoy some along with our coffee.  I chose the chocolate-topped cake with a peanut butter filling as did one other diner; others ordered the Almond Amaretto Cake.   Another diner ordered the interesting Blood Orange Key Lime Pie with bittersweet chocolate over a graham cracker crust.  Each dessert was beautifully presented on our plates - a feast for the eyes. In addition, several of us brought home desserts for our husbands - they were that good.  \\n\\nCaf√© Margaux is an excellent choice to celebrate special occasions, perhaps take out-of-town guests, or just dine with friends or family. I know that many a wedding or engagement has taken place here. Although prices are higher than other local restaurants, your meal will certainly exceed your expectations.  I have dined here three times this year and each meal was superb; you will not be disappointed.  The high quality fresh food is cooked to perfection.  Caf√© Margaux has been recognized in the industry; it has received several prestigious awards. The Caf√© was recently featured on Emeril's Florida on the Food Network and The Cooking Channel. They have been serving creative Classic European cuisine for over 25 years in charming Cocoa Village. Lunch is served 11:30 am-2 pm, Monday-Saturday; Dinner is served 5-9 pm.  The Restaurant is closed on Sunday. Caf√© Margaux is THE top restaurant in Central Florida..

All of the rolls tasted very fresh. The Avocado Roll basically fell apart so it wasn't rolled very well but the flavor was fresh and good. It hit the spot. We live quite near this spot so I imagine we will order takeout again. I added some panko to the rolls to give them some crunch and they were all terrific.

The name alone made us interested.  I was a little sad when we missed their breakfast by a few minutes. Nevertheless, we had a good selection for lunch options so we weren't too disappointed. The cafe is nestled beside the Oceanaire Seafood restaurant which I didn't know.  Upon entering, we were able to seat ourselves. We came around 10:30ish on a Monday morning so it wasn't a lot of customers dining. The customer service was superb. We were able to place our drink orders very quickly and the waitress was very helpful with what to order.  Known for their famous Fried Green Tomato grilled cheese sandwich, I decided to try it. I was a little hesitant because I wasn't sure if the tomatoes would be mushy but hey...why not. I paired it with their tomato basil soup. It didn't take long for our order to arrive and when it did, everything looked great. The sandwich I ordered was cooked to perfection and it also was topped with bacon slices. Everything came together wonderfully as far as the sandwich. Now the tomato soup was another story. It was very bland and lacked taste. I saw that my friend had ordered the baked potato soup and I opted for that one. This soup was amazingly delicious. Creamy, flavorful, and cheesy is how I'd describe this one. I tried to save some for later but that didn't quite work out. The prices were not bad either. Each sandwich is served with your soup, salad, or chips of choice. I wish they had unlimited refills on sodas but they only serve it by the can. This is a place I'd return to to try their breakfast options."},{"name":"Deschutes Brewery Portland Public House","address":"210 NW 11th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"After wandering around lost for an hour we found this place and we were so pleased!

My father in law had the ribs which were huge and came with two sides.  I believe each menu item should be comparable in size to the other.  \\n\\nI ordered the shrimp and scallop pasta. This dish could be great but flavors were not developed enough. I poured about a pound of salt on and a squeeze of lemon just to get something from this. Also, capers would be a delicious addition to really round it out. I believe the description said it was a cream sauce but I would say it's more of a broth with a touch of creaminess. Lastly, my pasta was mushhhhhhh. I'm not an al dente freak but the pasta was just overdone and they need to salt their pasta water. \\n\\nOh, they also give little ones a lunch box full of toys to play with.

The walls are an ass ugly color, making it seem even darker (bad lighting already making it so), and it just doesn't look clean.  Which, I LOVE my hole in the wall places in Austin, and the grime is part of it all.  But if service is also the worst, the band sounds bad and the food...  Not worth my time.\\n\\nThe food was horrible.  Just plain yuck.  Nothing tasted worthwhile.  I ate the bits on my plate I could handle and knew by sight. Again, couldn't see my hand in front of my face.  I like dark lighting, but not this dark when food is being served, by a waiter no less.\\n\\nI have loved this place, just for it's history.  I now look at it like a sore on my arm.  I don't want you there anymore and wish you would go away so something better can take it's place.\\n\\nFYI:  Just found out that this place has been up to no good:  A drug raid ended with15 people arrested for heroine, with intent to distribute.

One place that remains consistent throughout seasons is City Winery ATL. This place has the most extensive variety of wines that I've ever seen.   \\n \\nThey are the city's only urban winery, intimate music venue, restaurant, bar and private event space under one roof! Wow. I can't even recall how many times I've visited. Clients have met me here for lunch, I've caught up with colleagues over drinks here and I've enjoyed a few shows solo.   \\n \\nWith their vineyard just down the street, it's not a wonder why there are new wines added regularly. My mood will usually lead me to my drink of choice. Sometimes, it's a rose kind of day. While other times, chardonnay is calling my name. Either way I'm never disappointed with my selection.  \\n \\nI think the biggest misconception is that they are all about drinks. That is simply not true. Whether you're visiting for a comedy show or you make it in time for happy hour, there are many impressive food options. Meat eaters are always welcome. Many are pleasantly surprised by the vegetarian and vegan selections. They are very inclusive and cover all bases. \\n \\nRecently, I was invited to a media tasting event at City Winery ATL. While at this affair, I was introduced to their most popular menu items. The spread prepared for us was magnificent. Everything from fried chicken, salmon and their infamous flatbread were ready for our consumption.   \\n \\nI don't frequent too many spots that have good hummus. The hummus here is sensational. It isn't bland at all. It is perhaps the best hummus in Atlanta. It tastes homemade and I could really appreciate the blend.  \\n \\nBrussel sprouts were not my favorite growing up. What kid ate this dish willingly? They smelled funny and tasted even worse. City Winery ATL makes the best Brussel sprouts of all time! Between the feta cheese and the wine vinaigrette, it creates a melodious symphony you won't soon forget.  \\n \\nI was smiling from ear to ear when they brought out my favorite dish. The Margherita pizza. I get this every single time I visit. Sometimes I share with friends. Other times I enjoy it with a glass of bubbly. It's always a great choice.   \\n \\nExecutive Chef Nicholas Anderson passed through to drop some knowledge about astonishing creations. I was delighted to learn that most of the ingredients are locally sourced. That's so important. Chef also told us that he can be found any given day at the local farmers market getting fresh food for the restaurant. \\n \\nHead Winemaker Travis Green is Atlanta's only winemaker. His family has been making wine for generations. City Winery ATL was fortunate to get him. It was such a pleasure getting a tour of the winery from him. He gave a lot of insightful tips along the way. \\n #citywineryatl #ashsaidit #atlanta"},{"name":"Smoke and Bones","address":"999 Marine Drive","city":"North Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"The long wait for PNE summer Rib Fest is over.

The pra ram, basically steamed vegetables with rice and peanut sauce was also just okay. The veggies were nice and fresh and had a good texture - they were steamed perfectly.

We wait a good 35 + mins for our table..we see other people coming in and they get sat immediately assuming because they didn't ask for an outside table. We get our name called because we were sitting right next to the hostess. We go to our table and see they sat us inside. At this point I wasn't going to say anything but my friend mentioned that to our hostess and she said \\"well there's a big party....if you want a table outside it will be a longer wait\\" mind you that's what we wanted when we put our name on the list and waited so long for it. honestly she could give two fu*** about us so she walks away.Our server takes our order and we order our food. Our appetizer comes out in a timely manner and it was great. We wait on our food...wait and wait. 40+ mins go by and I'm not one to complain so we didn't. Everyone who got seated after us gets our food??? We still have said nothing because we assume they are really busy. I get it. The manager comes over and explains that the printer broke and our order was never made. He asked if he can get us anything at the time being and I said yes more bread please.

There are plenty of tables yet we weren't able to be sat outside????? When we waited over 30 mins for a table outside.....we were there for two hours. The people who sat after us got there food and were gone before we even got our checks. Yes I get it was a busy Saturday night but there was no comp on anything on our checks.I did work in a restaurant for 5 years and anytime the kitchen messed up we gladly took something off their bill to accommodate and make the guest have a good experience. My friend then complained to the manager explaining how we waited for specifically for table outside and how our food took forever.

When we travel for 2 nights we bring food as we dont want to go out every night. We booked this hotel because of the refrigerators in the room. When we arrived in our room we found that the refrigerator did not work. We called the front desk and they said our only option was to change rooms. Mind you that this was at 11 PM after driving 12 hours with an already sleeping child. they however said this was the best they could do. We woke up our child packed all our stuff back up and moved down 2 floors only to find another not working refrigerator.  if I was asking guests with children to move rooms at 11 PM I am going to at least check and make sure that the room I am sending them to has a working refrigerator before sending them. To top it all off there was a foul odor in our new room. I call the front desk again and they say there are no more available rooms and we are stuck with no refrigerator. They allowed me to put our food in the staff refrigerator 7 floors away from our room with the promise that maintenance would fix it tomorrow morning. Saturday came and went without anyone showing up for the refrigerator issue. I called the front desk again and they said it showed the maintenance guy went to our room. I was in the room and know that to be false. The hot refrigerator will say the same. We eventually are ready to leave our room on Saturday. We are in a line to leave the hotel every car in front of us puts their room key up to a sensor and the gate opens. we get up to the gate and our key doesnt activate the gate despite paying $15 a day for parking. I have to go back inside and they give me a validated ticket to exit not fixing the actual issue that our key doesnt open the gate. every time we tried to leave we had to go back in and get them to let us out despite being told our issue was fixed.

The lobster roll bun was hard on one side as if it was stale, and too soft on the other. You could taste the butter, but that was about it.

I had heard, from many people, that Ruth's Chris was absolutely the best steak they've ever had, and I had waited years to give it a try. I give the one concession that the hotel this restaurant is inside was under construction, so perhaps there were some glitches in general. But the first impression was that the restaurant was incredibly dated and old looking - not even remotely classy or intimate - more like a 90s hotel conference space. Our server was excellent, but assisting waitstaff were completely devoid of pleasantries and hospitality, and our first interaction was with someone who abruptly barked: \\"sparkling or ice water?\\" After ordering, our filets with shrimp came out shortly after our salads. The shrimp were rubbery and chewy. The steak, which I was excited about, was grisly, chewy and tough, and hard to cut with a steak knife. I've made better sirloins at home, and this was a filet! Also, had very little flavor and may be the first time I've ever had to salt a filet. Only bonus is that it was piping hot and cooked to the appropriate temperature. I'm honestly just sad that a restaurant I had looked forward to going to for a very long time was such a let-down. I'm hoping it's just this location and a temporary glitch due to the hotel construction, but it seems that everything from ambiance, staff and food quality are suffering.

Brown Rice, Roasted Red Peppers, Mushrooms, Double Avocado, Diced Tomatoes, Goat Cheese, EVOO & Aged Balsamic Vinegar. Cheese of the goat is really what drew me in.

This restaurant is better than I remembered or they've improved over the years. When it comes to dim sum in metro Atlanta, these guys are among the best, if not the best. I've been an Oriental Pearl loyalist for many years, but Royal China has changed my mind. Today, Royal China would probably be my top recommendation for dim sum in Atlanta (though I still like Pearl).\\n\\nAs far as Cantonese food in general goes (non-dim sum), Royal China has stiffer competition. It respectably stands up to, but does not surpass, some of my favorites which include Bo Bo Garden and Canton Cook II. Royal China has quite the dinner menu with several authentic, unique, and flavorful dishes. Their tasty dinner service can often be overshadowed by their more popular dim sum service and that's a shame. If you've never had dinner at Royal China, you should give it a try.\\n\\nThere can often be a wait for dim sum on the weekends so come early -- at or before 11am, if you can. If you do have to wait, it's usually not for long. Due to the quick nature of dim sum, tables turn over fast and you may be seated sooner than you think. As soon as you sit down, a pushcart with steaming trays of food is typically rolled to your table in prompt fashion.\\n\\nIn my recent return trips for both dim sum and dinner, I haven't had a single bad item. Some dishes have been OK, but most have been good or great.\\n\\nOverall, I think the dim sum quality and variety are great. I've enjoyed every dish. These include chicken feet, beef tripe, lotus leaf rice, turnip cake, pork congee, pork shumai (dumplings), rice noodle rolls, pork spare ribs, tofu pudding, egg tarts, and pineapple buns. Chicken feet was my favorite dim sum dish growing up. Royal China's version is the biggest I've seen. I highly doubt the chickens they came from were hormone-free. Royal China's chicken feet are thick and meaty and covered in a relatively heavy sauce, heavier than I'm used to seeing at other dim sum restaurants.\\n\\nThe flavor of Royal China's tripe is comparatively subdued, but still good with (in my opinion) an appetizing, firm, and chewy texture. Royal China prepares their tripe with small slices of daikon radish, which I like. Surprisingly, my favorite dim sum item at Royal China is the lotus leaf rice (another one of my favorites growing up). It's savory and addictively flavorful.\\n\\nTurnip cakes are served hot and fresh from a special dim sum cart with a flattop griddle. Pork congee and tofu pudding are scooped into bowls to order. The congee is topped with tiny slices of Chinese cruller (fried dough) and chopped green onion. The tofu pudding, which is made in a wooden bucket, is super soft and silky smooth. It's served in a sweet ginger syrup. It's not for everyone, but I really like it.\\n\\nThe egg tarts and pineapple buns are excellent.\\n\\nExpect to spend at least ~$15 per person, after tax and tip, at dim sum.\\n\\nThe dinner menu is massive. In recent years, Royal China unveiled a glossy new dinner menu with high quality, professional photographs of most of the menu items. It's impressive and reminiscent of Food Terminal's menu (though Royal China's came first). There's a little bit of everything when it comes to Chinese cuisine and it's not just Cantonese food. Examples include Hong Kong-style cold eel ($22.95), two lobsters cooked any number of ways ($35.99), geoduck clam sashimi (market price), two and three-course Peking duck meals ($36.95/$41.95), Hakka-style chicken ($15.95), sea cucumber with oyster sauce, crab, hot pot, noodles, spicy Szechuan and Hunan dishes, and much more.\\n\\nDinner items I've tried include the creamy minced beef soup, Hong Kong-style roast duck ($13.95), steamed whole bass, ong choy with garlic ($12.95), and sauteed okra with preserved garlic ($10.95). The \\"creamy minced beef soup\\" is West Lake beef soup. Along with morsels of beef, it contains a lot of egg whites and green onions. The soup can be made with a white fish instead of beef. It's warm, hearty, and comforting and tastes excellent with white pepper and a bit of red vinegar. The Hong Kong-style roast duck is only sold in halves. It's OK. I think better, meatier ducks can be found at other restaurants nearby like Hong Kong BBQ in the Atlanta Chinatown food court, but Royal China's version isn't bad.\\n\\nThe steamed whole bass is served covered in a pile of chopped green onions. It seems excessive, but I don't mind it. There's ginger too, but no cilantro, which is disappointing. The quality of the fish itself is decent. There are aquariums here so some of the fish are served fresh (some are frozen). The ong choy with garlic is yummy. The hollow, straw-like stems are crunchy and the green leaves are a lot like spinach, but tastier. This is one of my favorite Chinese vegetables along with snow pea tips and I recommend them. The garlic in the okra dish is pickled and delicious.\\n\\nService is usually good."},{"name":"City Winery","address":"650 North Ave NE, Ste 201, Ponce City Market","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"What a wonderful experience we had Saturday evening. \\nour only complaint is the parking situation, by no fault of the venue.

The reason this place got two stars from me was mostly due to service. \\n\\nI had heard really good things about this place from various people, so Wednesday night my boyfriend and I decided to check it out. They were on a short wait, so we went to the bar to get a drink. There were no menus on the table, and I ordered a glass of sauvignon blanc, as did my boyfriend. We get the tab, and then ask the waitress for a menu so we can peruse it while waiting for a table, That's when I notice that they have three different types of savignon blanc... and the waitress charged us for the most expensive one. I mean, at least ask me which one I want, or something. Don't automatically charge me for the most expensive glass on the menu. Rude.\\nStrike one. Minus a star. \\n\\nWe get a table, the ambiance is really nice. We get a booth which I like. We sit and finish our wine. And wait. And wait some more. Finally a waitress comes by, with like 15 dirty plates stacked and say she'll be right back to help us. Not the best first impression. She comes back and we order a bottle of wine and the homemade pimento cheese and she leaves. \\n\\nThe homemade pimento was great, really tasty. Good job JAK. \\n\\nWe order our entrees, on the specials menu it states that they don't allow substitutions. My boyfriend still asked if he could get fries instead of sweet potatoes (because he doesn't like them) and the waitress replies that \\"No. But you can add fries for $2!\\" This seems silly to me. This is when I started to get the feeling they were trying to just take our money. But whatever. He got his pork tenderloin on top of sweet potatoes and didn't eat them. They were thrown away and we were charged an extra $2 for french fries. Eh. Strike two.\\nThe entrees were good, I got the chicken fried ribs which were delicious, but there was a lot of fat on them. My boyfriend got the pork tenderloin special which was also really good. If only the service was equally as impressive, it was really, really, really slow. \\n\\nThen we get to dessert and this is where things completely took a turn for the worse. We both got amaretto straight up, like as an after dinner drink, and it was literally one tiny sip of alcohol. I don't like to complain about drinks not being strong enough or not big enough, but this was beyond ridiculous. We literally paid $12 for about 1 oz of amaretto between the two of us. We both have worked in the restaurant/bar industry, we know what to expect, and we almost complained to a manager it was THAT insulting. \\nWe also ordered the blondie dessert which is their \\"signature\\" dessert according to our waitress, and it was like raw cookie dough in what seemed to be a store bought pie crust. Not impressed with the pie at all. Minus another star.\\n\\nOverall, we might try this place again for brunch or with friends... but if I go back and get a similar experience, JAK will not be seeing me again."},{"name":"City Winery","address":"650 North Ave NE, Ste 201, Ponce City Market","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"We came for a birthday brunch.

The good vibes started with the cava that my girlfriend ordered for us, and I found drinking it to be one of those rare instances where a beverage can totally change your mood. That sometimes happens to me when I have coffee at Highland Bakery or Sierra Nevada at Atkins Park, but I usually can't predict what kind of drink will strike me like that. It thoroughly cheered me, and by the time the dinner was done they'd knocked off the price of one of the glasses. I dunno if this was on purpose, but it made me happy either way. \\n\\nDinner started with some bread that was remarkable for its subtlety _ which would be a characteristic of every dish we had. It seems to me that the bread even at a lot of good restaurants is made to be assertive through its salty or yeasty quality, but this bread was a lot more wholesome and understated. Its crust also had a pleasant char, reminding me a little of coal-fired pizza crusts in NYC. Next was arrancini, which had fennel pollen to give it some tang and not overpowering marinara sauce. I really enjoyed the burrata, which had a creaminess that went nicely with the arugala and proscuitto underneath. What would emerge next was the real showstopper of the meal: Our waiter's wine selection. \\n\\nI'm certainly closer on the wine spectrum to novice than conoisseur, but it's been rare for me to have one of those really transformative wine pairings where the wine's flavor jumps out after a bite of food like plugged-in Christmas lights. That's how this was. The wine (a grape from sicily that was moderately priced and not even on the menu yet) tasted almost nondescript by itself, but really leapt out after each bite of my steak. \\n\\nSpeaking of which, the steak was one of the best I've had recently. Again, nothing on the plate was overseasoned. The subtle flavor of the mild horseradish sauce really let the grassy beef speak speak for itself. It was well-seared but still cooked to the temperature I liked. The flavor made me wonder if they'd used some coffee grounds on the outside to amplify the char, which I've heard of some restaurants doing. \\n\\nThe one dish that didn't sing was the dessert of sweetpotato biscuits with apples and pudding. None of it was bad, but somehow the components didn't really harmonize like they were supposed to. \\n\\nStill, overall it was a great meal. I also loved the physical space there. The big windows and high ceilings make the place feel open and in no way cramped, but it's small enough to feel pretty cozy, too."},{"name":"Giraffe Japanese Deli","address":"81 SE Yamhill St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Cute little spot tucked away inside Cargo.

Although I do commend Krishnas on their service, generally speaking, and fast food-rollouts most of the time, I can't help but only find myself able to give them a 3*. \\n\\nWhen sitting in a booth, as we often do, the heat from the western sun permeates the all-glass wall next to your seat making for an uncomfortably warm and radiated environment. On a hot day, avoid the booths or window seats, if you don't like and/or can't take the summer heat. On a cooler day? This isn't an issue.\\n\\nAs for the food, you really can't go wrong with their Dosa Platter, that gives you a standard dosa, idly, vada, and some sauces to go with, all for around 12$. It's not that the food doesn't taste good; far from it. It's always a decent bite and the flavours are one point, whether you order it mild, medium, or spicy hot. The concern comes in with that recently raced up \\"speed\\". \\n\\nOnce or twice when we've gone in, the food has come out quicker than we've had a chance to settle in, with some portions of food being cut up or previously \\"handled\\", with the reason being that \\"someone cancelled an order so it was being reinstated for our meal\\". Read: \\"This isn't fresh, it's being reconstituted for you\\". When my Mum has spoken up the rare time this happens about the issue, she's been told that certain items are \\"not fresh, just being microwaved anyways\\", as though this should dispel any concerns about the quality or origin of the food...\\n\\nAll considered, the staff are friendly, the food is quick to the table, and tastes pretty okay. But any place that re-serves food or cuts cost by placing the business loss on the unsuspecting customer isn't worthy of a higher rating in my book. I would have rated a 4*, as I do often find myself going back for a well-priced and satisfying meal, but I do go in with the expectation and preparation for those occasions where I'm re-served someone else's cancelled order."},{"name":"Angelina's Greek Gyros","address":"112 NW Couch St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Falafel is too salty.

Parking may be difficult during peak hours. Luckily it was a little late in the afternoon so we didn't have any trouble and we got a table once we got in. The space inside isn't too big so seating can be a bit tight, but it has a nice homey feeling when you walk in.

I was able to try the gumbo, which was very decadent. I would definitely go back for it! My crab cake sandwich came out and as I was putting it together and getting ready to take a bite, the crab cake patty started falling apart.

But the patty was cooked to a good crisp and I got the remoulade on the side so I could add in how much ever I wanted. I usually don't mind the taste of sourness, but the mediterranean salad was a little too sour for me. \\n\\nAnd for dessert, we ordered their cookies and milk pie. One slice was enough for the two of us since we were quite full from our meal, but this was the icing on the cake.

The spatzle now is not browned in butter!! I was told the new recipe went into effect about 2 weeks ago when I complained. What people were dimwitted enough to decide that mushy spatzle with no browning was the way to go?! Who thought this was an acceptable change?!\\n\\nAlso your new menu looks like garbage, I got Red Robin vibes with the oversized one page, laminated menus.

The popovers were interesting - I liked that it was thin and that the pimento cheese was a good complement to it. The chicken and waffles were alright. I will never order it again. When I ordered it, I thought it would be a waffle with one or two pieces to it but it is basically the same amount of chicken if you ordered the 4 piece (which I guess makes sense since it costs the same price to order the chicken and waffles together and separately).  The waffle itself lacked serious flavor. I could've used more butter and syrup. And I didn't love the fried chicken. Th batter was so hard ... maybe too crispy for me.

It's kind of mix of turkey or chicken. Delicious. This is the one thing on the menu that never changes according to the waitress. Definitely worth trying once.

I'm not saying this place needs a dress code, but it could benefit from a clearer vision. \\n\\nAnyways, when I walked in, the receptionist asked if I had a reservation (I didn't), and she mumbled something about not being sure if she'd be able to seat me. I looked around and saw the restaurant was about 2/3 empty. Unless they were expecting a HUGE party in just a few minutes (which seemed odd), she was probably bs'ing. I should've taken this as a warning sign. I was seated at a 4-seater booth, and the wait staff seemed annoyed that they had to clear three other place settings, since I was eating alone.\\n\\nOn to the food.

The servers are extremely friendly and helpful. Sometimes it's busy but there are lots of steps and a park like area out back, so there are always seating options somewhere. It's dog friendly outside and they keep a dog bowl with fresh water there, and will bring water to your table also.

Keep in mind, I love this place...so much!! And I have been going here for as long as I can remember and always choose this place as my go-to when visitors come to town. My experience tonight changed my feelings towards this place so much that I don't think I can ever walk back in and give it another chance. \\n\\nA friend and I met for a quick dinner around 7 on a Tuesday night. Typically, the restaurant is full but tonight there were only 7 tables filled. We ordered the 3 combo + the chili parlor steak (medium rare) with mac and a salad. Every single time we come (which is at least once or twice a week), food is almost out before you can finish your salad. I'm talking QUICK, PEOPLE. After an hour of waiting + noticing tables that had been seated after us receiving their food, I kindly checked in with our waiter and she informed us that a new cook was slowing things down in the back. (understandable, but everything that we ordered except for the steak was already pre-made in bulk in the back). So we give it another chance and are greeted with chips + salsa in the meantime. Another 30 minutes goes by... I check back in and she assures us that it should be out soon. 15 more minutes later we FINALLY receive our food...food that is colder than cold and a steak that was so charred and well done I couldn't even cut it. As someone who hates complaining and feels so awkward doing so, I couldn't let this one go. I asked if they could heat up the chili and they just took away the steak. Didn't offer to make another (although I wouldn't have accepted this offer as I'm sure it would have taken another hour). Our waitress Emily was trying her best to resolve the issue and did what she could and we were appreciative. \\n\\nThis is where things took a REALLY sharp turn downhill. She asked if I would like to speak with the manager so of course I said yes. If I was in their shoes, I would of course love to hear customer's thoughts both good + bad so I assumed everything was going to be okay. Five minutes later, Russell the manager walks out and throws his arms on our table and leans over to get in our face. Please note the that below following was said:\\n\\nHim:\\"I get it yall are pissed. I'm pissed too. What do you want me to do?\\"\\n\\nMe: \\"We come here all the time and we love this place so much but I just wanted to share how disappointed we were with everything tonight\\"\\n\\nRussell: \\"Yeah, I love this place too and I'm here all the time. Again, what do you want me to do. If you got something to say then say it because I'm in a hurry and have to go back to the kitchen\\"\\n\\nMe: *jaw drops to the floor and am speechless*\\n\\nHim: \\"Well did you have to pay for it? (as he knows the waitress took care of it) \\n\\nMe: \\"that is the least of my concern...\\"\\n\\nAll in all, he continued to pound us with questions in the most aggressive form so I told him to forget it to end the discussion because clearly he was not capable of calmly listening and being understanding. We were not looking for a free dinner, we weren't looking to get our waitress in trouble, we simply just wanted to share our thoughts as we thought he would appreciate that coming from a valued customer. \\n\\nAs mentioned, I (we) really love this place and it makes me more sad than mad that this situation unfolded in front of us and the guests that we're watching. I'm embarrassed for this manager and I hope no one else is treated the way we were treated.

Despite asking to be notified of any availability, there were tables with a view that sat unoccupied for the duration of our meal while we dined in the dark main room requiring a flashlight to see in the middle of a sunny day.

The beef was cooked perfectly and the cup of shoyu broth that accompanies it is so good on a cold night like tonight. My little one had the kids chicken shio and really went for it.

In a way it fits - after all, treehouse makes you think of greenery, which makes you think of vegetables, which makes me think salad.  On the other hand, you expect a treehouse to have the comfort food and snacks that you hide from your parents in case you decide to run away, which would definitely not have been salad.   Regardless, I've been hearing about treehouse for ages, and finally got to go on one of the perfect fall nights we've been enjoying.  We had to wait a while at the railing, so I tried not to stare down anyone in my eyeline to intensely as I have been known to do when the patrons that are keeping me from my food are in plain view...\\n\\nWe ended up little table right up against the window of the bar, so close in fact, that at times it seemed as if the couple on the other side were dining with us.\\n\\nThough I'd heard good things about the pizza and sandwiches, I ordered the spinach salad with steak since I needed to max out on the iron intake to give platelets the following day.  I was a little annoyed when the salad arrived without steak, and I had to remind two staff members that I had in fact ordered it before it showed up 5 minutes later, but it was worth the wait.  The meat was perfectly cooked to my taste, right-sized, and an excellent complement to the other toppings.  It was the best salad that I'd had in a restaurant in a long time - just the right amount of greens to toppings with well-balanced salty, sweet, tangy, crispy flavors and textures. The importance and art of good salads are underrated.\\nSo when I had the opportunity to go back a week later, I jumped on the chance, eager to get some more delicious salad.  I considered many of the other menu items, and even asked the server for her recommendations but ended up with ensalata especial.  Mixed greens + pecans + feta + oranges + avocado = simple and tasty.  I was debating how healthy I wanted to be, so I ordered a side of fries to even things out...  The fries were somewhat undercooked, and couldn't hold a candle to the salad. \\n\\nI really like the atmosphere and wished I lived within walking distance.  Technically it's all neighborhoods, but it would be uphill both ways for 6 miles... and you need more than salad to fill you up after that!"},{"name":"G.

I have read the reviews and was given a personal recommendation to try this restaurant (our first Columbus dining experience).  We have now been on the road for three weeks traveling and dinning at some great local restaurants throughout the Midwest and Northeast (family of foodies, and I, a chef), only to end our last night before the drive home here.  Let me begin by saying that our waiter, David, and our cocktails, were lovely!  But that was it.  \\n\\nThe menu demonstrates an understanding of a professional dining experience in 2016.  Local produce, modern setting.  It was a Monday night.\\n\\nWe ordered what was described as chilled sweet corn soup with lump crab salad.  I imagine sweet kernels of corn swimming in a bisque of seasoned cream only to be garnished with big lumps of fresh crab... It was only cold cream. No corn, and pathetic off cuts of minimal crab stuck at the bottom.  I asked for more crab, but was served another shot of off cuts.  Inedible.  My mother went home feeling ill.\\n\\nWe remained optimistic as my husband and father rather enjoyed their shredded pork soups.  \\n\\nThen came the entrees. Cold. Really cold. Salads should be cold, mussels should not be cold.  My tofu entree (which was being showed off for restaurant week) was also cold, plate was dirty.\\n\\nWe told our waiter, he sent the plates back, the tofu returned reheated (microwave or salamander, couldn't be 100% certain), and overcooked. And the mussels, still cold. (Side note- calamari wasn't bad or cold).\\n\\nAt this point, we had had enough, couldn't stand to be there any longer.  Paid our check, left, only to return to a nauseous mother back at the hotel.\\n\\nEdit: I forgot to mention the head chef was not there.

Both times I have ordered the Porreca Piccante which is mildly spicy and great for those who just want a little kick to their pizza. The best thing though is the crust which comes out perfectly cooked with a slight chew. The crust is thin and not too soggy which some of these pizzas are susceptible to if you aren't good at what you do. The husband today got the make your own margherita which he loved.\\n\\nI know that being here in Atlanta, you have your choice of pizzas (I feel like a flight attendant) but Varuni is definitely at or near the top.

This is one of the best Korean/Chinese restaurants I've ever been. \\n\\nWhat makes this place special is because of the Spicy Jjambong. It's the best I've ever had, hands down. The technique of using the high heat wok to stir fry the vegetables before its dumped into the broth, is what makes this soup so different than others I have had before. It creates this multi layer flavor of spice and smoke, that is unlike any other Jjambong I have ever had. \\n\\nAlthough the Seafood Jjambong is most traditional, I think the star is the Beef Jjambong. The flavors were so deep and rich, its absolute must try when visiting. \\n\\nWe also tried the Seafood Jjajang noodles, which was excellent as well. I would say it's on par with China Jade's version. It wasn't anything spectacular like I've had in Korea but it was still very tasty and consistent.\\n\\nIf you go with multiple people order both Jjambong and Jjajang, the contrast of the two noodles make a great pairing of flavors. \\n\\nAnother staple we had to order when eating at a Korean/Chinese restaurant was the Sichuan Pork Tangsooyuk, which is pretty much a spicy version of sweet & sour pork. And I'll tell you what it was incredible also. Perfect balance of crunch, spice and sweetness.

He was really out of it, and slow, and he messed up our order (we were supposed to get a tamale plate, but he put in a single tamale.

My husband asked for the one pound pork chop, which they called me back after a few minutes and told me they didn't have any pork chops left, so I asked for the biggest steak they had as a substitute. When we picked up the order and got it home, it was less than the size of my palm, chalky and bland. We also ordered a double order of the smoked spiced sausage which is normally good, but these were burned to a crisp and tasted like icky fridge, like you know when fruit or vegetables go bad in your fridge and it makes everything else in the fridge taste really gross? That's what it tasted like, burnt icky fridge. I ordered the steak street tacos and the meat in the tacos tasted like icky fridge too which makes me believe their meat is uncovered in a fridge with something moldy, plus the steak was grey and cut into cubes which clumped together and the guacamole was not in the box either.

Don't get me wrong - the food is good but it's not nearly as good. The downtown location had chicken that was absolutely drenched in spices, giving it more of that hot chicken flavor. To this day I still think it was the best fried chicken I've ever had. The chicken I got from this location (tried it twice now) just tasted like regular fried chicken without a whole lot of flavor to it. I even went out of my way to ask for it spicy and was told it's always made that way. Didnt get that vibe at all. Not the worst I've had but definitely not the best.  \\n\\nI also was disappointed by the service. When we sat down it took about 30 mins before someone came by our table to ask if we wanted water. And then the order took over an hour before it came out with no one checking on us in the meantime. Don't get me wrong - I completely understand that some restaurants make their food fresh and that takes time, but it was strange to me that no one came by to see if we needed more water, apps while we waited, etc. \\n\\nAll in all, I'm glad this wasn't my first experience at Gus's because I probably wouldn't have come back!

Reservations were for 8 on a Satuday night, and the place was not even crowded. Granted it is a huge place boasting bountiful seating outside. We were seated outside in somewhat of a corner, but still got the full view of inside and out. I loved where we sat, it felt quite secluded. At one point a woman and began to play guitar and sing outside. It was nice, not too loud but good background music. \\n\\nAfter looking at the menu we came across some tiny writing on the back that offered a beer flight for $4.95 of 6 beers that they brew right there. I thought that was a great deal for those of us who aren't opposed to drinking beer or trying new things. But I still wonder why it was in such TINY writing, easily missed. We got our waters and waited for the beer flights. Once we got our beer flights thats when the service began to go downhill. Because our waiter was just nowhere to be found. It was creeping up on 9pm, arrived at 8pm and we were beginning to get grinchy and tired of waiting.

Gotta love her! \\n\\nThe beers came out in shot glass sizes which I was aware of. 4 were crisp and light, the other 2 were pale ales and one was a black ale. The 3 of us who got beer flights weren't fans. At one point I proclaimed the seasonal one which was some of the darkest beer I've ever had tasted like a tree. Someome else said \\"thats called earthy, its good for you!\\" I drank 5 of the 6, favorite and most interesting flavor was some bavarian one that had a hint of bananas in it! \\n\\nAt one point it felt like we had 2 waiters. 10 minutes after had placed our order our original waiter comes back finally to try and take our order.

It had some interesting pesto/mayo spread, with avocado and a really yummy bun. The fries were great, everyone was stealing them off my plate! Everyone else's food looked great, and I trired the red bell pepper mashed potatoes and they were GOOD! They looked so orange, I was dying to try these. Some got dessert, I regret not getting the irish coffee because it looked so damn good. My ballsy girlfriend who single handedly outted our original waiter ordered a dessert wine, an orange muscato. It came out in a tiny shot size wine glass, and she said \\"That cost me $6?\\" HAHA! He did try and warn her of the size. \\"It had better be the best damn wine ever!\\" I tried a fraction of the wine, and it was not. However I am not a dessert wine fan in general.\\n\\nOur service may have been pretty off and gripeworthy but I won't dock the overall rating because another waitress tried to redeem him.

There were only 2 servers so it was often hard to flag them down, but the staff was relatively nice. They are your typical Korean bbq menu, but it was relatively more in the expensive side, but they have a variety and combo sets. Also be careful with the side-dishes, after 1 refill they charge you which was quite disappointing cause they were not that big. \\n\\nAlso, after getting everything you've ordered they tend to forget about you and they don't stop by to check if your grill needs changing. Overall it's a decent restaurant!"},{"name":"WUBurger","address":"880 Main St","city":"Woburn","stars":"4","text":"I am a vegetarian and find it hard to go to burger places and find items that I would like.

I didn't mind the closeness. Our dining neighbors asked for suggestions after seeing our breakfasts, so it's that kind of place.\\nSince it was mid day, my dining companion and I enjoyed a mimosa and a bellini as we waited for our plates.

Some of the best I've ever had--- no hyperbole. Fluffy biscuits, luscious gravy, chorizo and cheddar eggs.

And since the greens from the burger spilled out onto the rest of the plate, I couldn't tell where the salad ended and the burger began.\\n\\nThe salad's ranch dressing was quite delicious with a robust garlic flavor.  But now, a word about spinach as a salad green.  Raw spinach has a fuzzy almost furry texture.  I can do without it.  Cook it and butter it and then I'll love it.\\n\\nThe hamburgers were blah and sort of mooshy, no bite or tang.  Also, the patties had that molded pre-frozen feel.

She recommended Deschutes as a place for pretzels. \\n\\nType of cuisine: A brew pub in the heart of Portland, Deschutes Brewery & Public House \\"continues brewing unique beers at the original location in downtown Bend and now at our new location in Portland's Pearl District - while serving the finest Northwest pub cuisine.\\" Brew fare at its peak, the kitchen prepares lunch pretzels, burgers, large-sized salads, pasta and anything else you could dream up at a pub. Everything is cooked and prepared on site (including salad dressings) and attempts are made to choose and serve local produce. \\n\\nAmbiance: Large interior space, which used to house an auto body parts shop, dons floor-to-ceiling windows, some of which slide open like warehouse or garage doors. Exposed wooden beams and industrial pipes line line the space as well as the ceilings. Dark greens and woods make up the plaid carpet and leather bench seats that resemble church pews, creating a very bachelor-esque space, where one might expect to see a salt and pepper haired man with a pipe, sitting in the corner and reading a classic novel, legs crossed. The bar area is somewhat small compared to the immensity of the establishment, but offers drinkers and diners a nice, removed spot from which to enjoy their drinks while overlooking the copper equipment in the distillery. Red walls with artwork mark the kitchen side of the restaurant. \\n\\nWhat I ordered: Both my dining companion and I ordered the pretzels ($8 each), served with your choice of side: the soup of the day, cole slaw, fries, sweet fries, or salad as well as a dish of creamy Monterey jack cheese dipping sauce with whole grain Black Butte Porter mustard. Our late-comer ordered house-made ginger ale, which gave us pure, light, sweet ginger enjoyment. \\n\\nWhat I loved: I loved the blue cheese dressing for the salad! I also loved the wreath-shaped pretzel, beautifully buttered and lightly salted, presented to us for lunch.  \\n\\nWhy I loved it: The food was delicious, the service quick and friendly and the space huge!  \\n\\nCost: Low to average ($8-$12 for lunch specials; and no tax for Washington diners means an extra 10% in your pocket!)"},{"name":"Highlight by Re-Up BBQ","address":"538 6th Street","city":"New Westminster","stars":"4","text":"My husband and I shared a fried chicken eggs benny and a beef brisket eggs benny.

This place has legit BBQ.  I got there at 1130 and the line was fairly deep and took about 30 minutes. I knew when I walked in it was gonna be good. The place was just permeating delicious Smokey meat aromas.\\n\\nIt's not a huge place but you can fit a decent crowd inside. They have several long wood tables that can fit a pretty big crew.  You wait in line then pick your meat and sides. They chop it all right in front of you which is glorious.  One of the most important things I look for in a bbq place that does brisket is making sure they ask if I want it fatty or lean which they do!\\n\\nI rolled with the brisket, pulled pork and ribs.  They had just run out of sausage. Yes, you need to get to this place early as they do run out of items. They are open until they sell out.  I few other items like the salmon, turkey and pork belly I'm definitely going to come back for.  The meat ain't cheap so be prepared to shell out some dough.  The sides are very reasonably priced.  \\n\\nAs for the meat.  The brisket is definitely within the top 5 I've ever had.  Great bark, nice deep slightly sweet and smokey flavor. It was incredibly juicy and the fat just melted in your mouth.   The ribs and pork were also very good but the brisket took the cake hands down.  The sides are pretty standard, good but nothing out of this world.  All the meat comes with homemade white bread which has really good flavor and paired with the meat well.

You see, there's a lot of myth and legend that surrounds this inaptly-named watering hole, and beyond the name alone, a lot of smack talking far and wide by those whose opinions I hold dear. When my friend scheduled a birthday get-together there, I cringed, but from loyalty grows willingness, and with a deep breath, I crossed the threshold. \\n\\nUpon exhaling and opening my eyes, I found that I was standing in a nice looking (yet dark) bar with some tables and chairs, a shuffleboard table along the wall (over which was hung an impressively large bee/wasp/whatever-inspired art piece), and a HUGE bangin' patio out back. The music was frenetic and at many times grating, but it wasn't loud enough to be overly offensive (at least a good 80% of the time). The staff at the bar was plenty friendly, and offered me up a 22oz bottle of Green Flash Imperial IPA for $7. Any bar (other than your standard ultra-beer-bar like CAH) that sells me a 22 and hands it to me to drink straight from the bottle gets a win in my book. Especially a DIPA. In fact, each time I approached the bar I was met with a smile and some prompt service. \\n\\nAs far as selection, they offer a full bar, 5 taps (3 of which were micros, one was German, and one was a macrobrew), and a pretty decent bottle list for micros, including the list of special 22oz's on the front bar wall. Overall, it has enough variety to keep me entertained for a while. \\n\\nI didn't try the food, and my group was inside, so other than a quick walking tour, the patio was not a focus of my experience, but on a quick glance, I was sold. It was definitely crowded out there, but I could see myself showing up on a sunny weekday afternoon for some good, solid day drinking on that expansive veranda. Oh yes. \\n\\nI didn't get a chance to try the food, so I can't comment on that. \\n\\nThe crowd? It was somewhat mellow and diverse (read - neighborhood crowd) when I showed up at 845 on a Saturday. Come 10:30, someone set off a keffiyeh bomb and the place was instantly packed with some tragic fashion choices and even more tragic hairstyles. As we vacated one of our tables (we had a group of about 20), a roving pack of denim-vest-clad folks quickly descended, snagging not only the table but batting clean-up on our appetizers (read - they finished our chips and salsa and whatever other food was on the table). We just watched, mesmerized. \\n\\nSo this begs the question - do you rate a bar based on the bar itself (space, service, offerings)? Or do you rate it based on the people that hang out there? Well, it's obvious from some bars that they're actively and aggressively courting a certain clientele, and actively shunning others. Those I would rate based on the clientele. Here, I didn't quite get the notion that the bar itself was aiming for this level of hipster crowd. The offerings were well-crafted and not ironic. The art, again, was nice and neutral. The lack of 3 or 4 trendy (read - PBR) macros on tap showed that their focus was serving good beer, not attracting... well... the type of people that descended on our table. Overall, while the servers were hipster-ish looking, they were super nice to me, and tossed no attitude. \\n\\nI liked this place enough and would, at the right times, hang out there. I'd probably avoid prime time, but really, it's the patio+good beer selection that I'd be coming for anyway. While I wouldn't travel the distance across town to hang out inside, that patio is probably worth traveling for.

Definitely recommend arriving early to enjoy walking around the surrounding gardens, chickens, etc. during nice weather, especially during sunset's golden hour. We got a table outside. It was dark and intimate, as the sun had set already so we could only see the food and each other by candlelight. We started with the cheese board which was nice, not anything spectacular. We ordered to have double cheese rather than meat. They happily made the adjustment. The cocktail I got, which is no longer on their menu, was way too sweet for my liking due to the amount of orange liquor. I really enjoyed the Beet Salad and of course we had to try the Smoked Salmon appetizer (our favorite thing of the night). My boyfriend got the Duck and I got the Chicken, both okay but could use a bit more flavor. We had high hopes and were left feeling like it was just okay, perhaps due to the late hour of our reservation, but the food entrees were a bit disappointing for the price and we felt a bit rushed to finish our meal."},{"name":"Tamale House East","address":"1707 E 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I'm torn between four and five stars...

The outside area is very nice with the gardens and being right next to the Chattahoochee river. I went at night so I can't really say much but I can see how this could be a pretty romantic spot for a date. I would come back for brunch just to experience it during the day. If you're a wine drinker, they do let you try the wine before you order which is nice because the wine is expensive (we'll get to that). That's pretty much it for the good stuff.\\n\\nNow onto the the negatives, the reasons why I gave it 2 stars.\\n\\nThis place is overrated. The food is way overpriced for what you get and the portions are tiny. I tried 3 different dishes and they were nothing special at all. There's not much flavor to their dishes. The basket of bread they bring out while you wait is just basic stuff you can probably buy at the grocery store.\\n\\nI ordered the $17 pasta from their dinner menu and ended up paying $25 for it because I asked to have the pork switched out for chicken (The waitress did not mention that there would be an $8 charge for chicken, which is ridiculous). The pasta barely had any sauce and the chicken was dry. Anyone could make better pasta at home. \\n\\nI also had the Duck Burger($17) and \\"Jumbo\\" crab cake($16). Again, nothing special. It was just a regular burger that they put an egg on top. You would never guess that there's duck in it because it looks and tastes just like a regular burger, which was just average. I've had better burgers from Chili's or Applebee's. They'll try to make the fries seem gourmet by naming all these ingredients in it but the fries are just overly salty and soggy. \\n\\nThe \\"Jumbo\\" crab cake, which was decent, was literally the size of about 3-4 chicken nuggets put together.\\n\\nAs I mentioned, the wine is expensive here. Do yourself a favor and google the brand of the wine before you order. My friend paid $10 for a glass of Merlot which turned out to only cost $20 for an entire bottle. Beer is about $5 for the regular stuff like Heineken, which is normal I guess. \\n\\nThe staff was generally courteous as you would expect from a fine dining restaurant. I never got a refill on my water, but everyone else at my table did so maybe they just didn't notice. Not a big deal.\\n\\nOverall, I didn't have a good experience and wouldn't recommend this place for dinner. The food just didn't meet expectations, especially for a restaurant of this caliber.

I am a regular at their Anderson location, and I was pleased to find the same level of quality here.  I feel like I could cut and paste most of my Anderson Tarka review here, as it was consistently good.  This is the first establishment on Rock Rose to open.  Pretty soon the street will be buzzing with a variety of local food options.\\n\\nThey embrace their brand, \\"Fresh, Fast, Flavorful\\", and it resonates through everything they do.  I have eaten at many Indian establishments around the world, and Tarka is authentic.Their food tastes fresh, is flavorful, and thankfully  lacks the heavy oil that predominates at other American Indian restaurants.  The Tika Masala is hands down my favorite menu option.  I love that no menu item is over $10, and they have clearly marked gluten free options. \\n\\nYou just go to the counter to order and pay, and then take away a number to wait for your fresh cooked food to be delivered to you.\\n\\nThis is a local, and family owned establishment.  They take great pride in their business.\\n\\nYou can order their food online to take away, or you can dine in.

Table was roomy but aisle pass was tight. not a big deal for those sitting but wait staff had to navigate. \\n Upon receving the menu's we were promptly asked for a drink order, it arrived within 10 minutes of sitting, plenty of draft beer selections including my Guinness ($7) and wine ($12). \\n We settled for two apps; the buffalo honey cauliflower and calamari both which didn't stand a fighting chance with this hungry crowd. Cauliflower was tasty and had about 10 good sized pieces. Calamari was also good and the fried jalapenos were a nice addition. \\n Food selections all looked good, we ordered a couple of chicken dishes ($19), scallops ($27) and steak tips ($20). All were delicious and everyone enjoyed. Steak tips were nicely marinated and the mashed complimented it well. Scallops were tasty and done perfect. Portions were averaged sized. We did not get it but the large thin crust pizza and large salad at the next table looked great.\\n The challenge here is with the noise level, it's a small room and conversations between guests at our table were hard to conduct. I hope that when the windows are open the noise won't echo so much. \\nNear the end of our meal, they had an acoustic guitarist which was very pleasant to listen to as we finished our drinks.  \\nSummary:\\nWait staff: hostess pleasant hello and seating. Wait staff right on and personable. \\nFood choices: pizza, steak, seafood, flatbreads and poultry. And then there's the Spaghetti Squash entree for those looking for other options. \\n\\nMy recommendations here are to visit midweek or off hours as the place fills up fast and gets loud.  If conversation or hearing challenged is part of your group, you may need to workaround that with seating arrangements or time of visit. Also between drinks, apps and meals, the cost came out to about $50 per person. Personally I enjoyed the meal, atmosphere and location. I will be back to try out the pizza with a house salad very soon.\\n\\nAlso I think I would come here with adults and pass on bringing the kids as it's a relaxed vibe and would be a good choice for a date or night out with the wife.

It came with 5 large ravioli (had to cut them into fourths to eat it comfortably). I probably could've skipped the extra parmesan as the sauce was seasoned enough. It was delicious, but heavy as it is mostly dairy. My boyfriend got the chicken marsala. It looked like a decent amount of food for me but he eats a lot so ordering an appetizer before the entrees would've been good. He gave me a bite and it was also delicious.\\n\\nAfter finishing our meals, our waiter told us the dessert menu. We opted for the creme brulee cheesecake.

The chicken liver tart however was one ten most unappetizing, in-tasteful dish I have ever tried. Having been to all the best restaurants in Atlanta, I have had my fair share of offal-based dishes. Not only did it have a pungent, lingering taste, but the severity of the gamey flavor was beyond compare. \\n\\nI decided to highlight these two dishes because I think that essentially, these two extremes sum up Staplehouse as a whole: overrated and unbalanced.

I think the bread was the best part. Also if you sit at the bar the doors keeps opening and closing and bringing in a cold breeze. So if it's cold out, I would say don't sit near the door. Overall I would give the food a 5/10 and the service a 4/10. The bartender did not ask, \\"how was everything\\"? Since it's a new restaurant and all, I would think they would like the feedback.

Now, I'm no vegetarian, I likes the meats, but that veggie taco looked fantastic, so I got one along with a bacon, potato, egg and cheese.  The veggie taco was my fave!  It was overflowing with black beans, spinach, grilled mushrooms and onions, and guac.  The bacon taco was also delish, however I'd requested sliced avocado that was missing.  I just put some of the guac on it and it was alllll good.  My grrl was super happy with her spicy migas taco and the avocado crispy taco that had delicious mystery meat on it.

The host and waiters are very attentive and polite.  For special occasions they offer a complimentary glass of champagne and a complimentary dessert to boot.  You don't see this type of service everywhere you go in Vancouver so it's a very nice change to have the entire staff be extremely aware of your needs and wants throughout the meal.  \\n\\nNow onto the most important part; food.  The Dungeness crab is nice and packed with seasonal flavours however the amount of crab that comes with the appetizer is a bit disappointing considering it looks more like a garnish of crab to a salad rather than the star of the dish.  I'd recommend getting the ooey gooey french onion soup that is full of melty cheese and bread that has been soaked in a flavourful broth.   \\n\\nThe scallops were cooked to perfection with zucchinis on the side however and I'd almost consider this a very light entree or even an appetizer considering it lacked a side that would be somewhat filling (starch, carb, etc).  If you're feeling extremely hungry, this is not the right dish for you but if you're looking for something light and bright with, once again, seasonal flavours then make sure to choose this dish.\\n\\nThe duck was cooked a bit more towards medium to barely medium-well  when typically duck breast is perfection at a medium rare.  Unfortunately the one flaw of the waiter was that he forgot to ask what type of cook I'd like and a flaw on my part was that I assumed if the question wasn't asked medium rare was the go to.  Regardless of the cook, you could still tell that the quality of the duck breast was great and once again the sides were delicious.  This meal was more fitting to the entree category.\\n\\nThe creme brulee is simple but delicious.  The decor is breathtaking and makes you feel like you're at a restaurant in Paris.

I was impressed with my short visit to Cakes & Ale.\\n\\nMy husband and I stopped in for a snack and a round of drinks, killing some time before dinner.

The bar was comfortable, and the bartenders both skillful and friendly.\\n\\nThe drinks were top notch, delicious and crafted with care. I had the Run to the Hills, a mezcal cocktail with white cacao, vermouth, grapefruit, and bitters. It was a great cocktail, the mezcal and white cacao a surprising but lovely combination. My husband had the Jimi & Janis, a drink with dry gin, Grand Poppy, Benedictine, lime, and bitters. I don't prefer gin, but this was a solid cocktail.\\n\\nWe shared a couple small plates to tide us over until dinner, and these were both excellent. The melon and prosciutto was simple and satisfying, with top quality ingredients--juicy ripe melon and silky salty ribbons of prosciutto. The burrata and watermelon was similar in spirit, an assembly of beautiful elements, impossible to botch. The burrata was soft and milky, and it came with colorful cubes of yellow and pink watermelon, sprinkled with holy basil, nigella seeds, extra virgin olive oil, and sea salt.\\n\\nI'd love to come back to Cakes & Ale for a full meal, where I can get a better sense of the kitchen's range.

Unfortunately, since they have moved down the road, things have changed for the worse. \\n\\nIf I had one bad experience, I'd just would've assumed it was a bad day, mistakes get made, etc., but this is not the case. The first time they sent me a pizza with no sauce on it. It was still ok I guess, but seems like a pretty big part to leave out. The next time they completely got my order incorrect, and I will admit when I called to ask what's up, they sent me another pie 30 min later. I could hear employees complaining though while I was on the phone when whoever answered my call asked them to make the correct order. At this point I should've learned my lesson. \\n\\nThe last time they were supposedly unable to reach me on the phone, which is fine since my apartment has a front desk with a person at it 24/7. Instead of asking the desk or leaving there though, the driver decided to leave it on the ground out front next to the trash. I'm no health expert, but I would assume that probably wouldn't pass as acceptable with anyone. \\n\\nWhen they're working good it's great pizza, but I'm going to say unless you walk in to pick up a slice and can watch them for yourself, it's not worth the crapshoot.

So I barely see Japanese people in Boston. But half of the table was Japanese people speaking in Japanese! I was thinking maybe this restaurant is a hidden place only shared within Japanese community.\\n\\nAnd the food was really good. These days it's hard to tell the difference in Roll - I would say many places do decent job. But appetizer and Udon were really special and very true to traditional Japanese cuisine - meaning not customized to American taste. Try tartar for an appetizer. If you like cucumber go with the avocado mayo one. It's DELICIOUS.\\n\\nI give 4 to this restaurant because the service is not too good. It's not because they are not nice, they are just not well trained I think. For example, my appetizer came after rolls. I mean, if you are going to serve an appetizer at the end why do you even bother to separate the section? Anyways, their sake selection is also big so it's worth checking out. Not a huge fan of sake?

We haven't quite finished our dine in food and we ordered a take out to go, which we been waiting for a long time, the manager came over and gave us the bill as if she wants us out.

The business is in the area between two buildings with easy access across one bridge from the covered parking deck - come to the 2nd floor and follow the sign.\\n\\nAs some of my friends know, I rarely give 5 stars and even more rarely give them for a first visit but wow - this place entirely blew me away. From the well considered interior design (modernist/industrial with plenty of wood and concrete surfaces), to the products (more on this in a bit) and to the service, this is/was one of the best first time experiences I've had to date in Atlanta. This is the first of many retail and food establishments to open in the converted dairy, with a soft opening this past Saturday (2019.04.13). My expectations were low only to be overwhelmed at each phase, from the initial greeting, to the menu, to the actual food and drink, and to the excellent service.\\n\\nI showed up shortly before lunch today with a few friends to a rather bustling crowd - the place looks to be able to seat 40-50 easily (more at tables on the \\"patio\\")  and there were at least 20-25 people there enjoying the many menu options. While the name and focus is on the cold-brewed coffee and tea, it was the many options of both in conjunction with the awesome super-clean food menu that blew me away. As the name suggests, they specialize in cold-brewed coffee and tea - but these are extra special and infused with carbonation or better, nitrogen, to add a quality that to me is similar to my second love, draft beer. The CO2 adds a nice effervescence to the cold coffee/tea that makes it very refreshing while the nitro adds a lactose-free creaminess that makes those drinks dreamy. What a great concept and way to make your products unique, especially with coffee shops sprouting everywhere you look.\\n\\nAfter an enthusiastic discussion with the proprietor (Michael J.) I managed to try just about every drink - they have sample cups so you can figure out what you like best. I had all of their regular and seasonal offerings with the Nitro Matcha Latte as my favorite. I also tried two of the \\"signature drinks\\" - a lime-citrus-tea, alcohol-free Moscow Mule analog and a alcohol-less Old Fashioned that were both similar and very different from the liquored up variety - both were awesome. I settled on freshly steeped whole-leaf Yakushima sensha and was not disappointed. I also had an espresso (served with fizzy water).\\n\\nThis place also caters to the specialty food market with dishes that account for just about every allergy and food choice, from gluten-free to keto, there's something on the menu for everyone. These were the dishes I tried:\\n\\n* Arugula Salad - organic arugula, house-pickled beets, wild mountain cumin spiced pecans, shaved radish, pecorino cheese, evoo\\n* Korean Pork Sliders - Hawaiian roll, Korean style pulled-pork, smoked paprika aioli, house pickled red onions\\n* Grilled Corn Avocado Toast - grilled corn salad, sliced avocado, paprika aioli, cillantro, radish, peppercorn blend\\n* Smoked Salmon Toast - Oolong smoked salmon, arugula, creme fraiche, granny smith apples, chives, cured sumac\\n* Cheat Day Bacon Egg Sandwich - crispy pork belly, egg, cheese, comeback sauce on fresh brioche - this was amazing!\\n\\nService was fantastic - you could tell the people here were genuinely  interested in seeing your reaction to each dish or drink and to the amazing flavors. Kudos to Dairies Coffeehouse for doing this right and providing an over-the-top experience. Also a quick tip added later - they have wireless charging at some of the tables and fast free WIFI!

I'll echo everybody else's sentiments on a few common points I see in reviews:\\n\\nParking: it's downtown, right in the heart of it all so yes parking is tough. And don't forget the Pearl Market also absorbs even more precious parking when its in season. Be warned; you will need to find a meter and walk a bit to get here. \\n\\nQuirky: yes, it's a local joint. There are wobbly tables and your coffee mug might have a chip on it, but that--to me--adds charm.\\n\\nCoffee: good. Very good. The staff knows their coffee and always makes great recommendations when I am unsure of what to get. I absolutely LOVE their seasonal beverage options. They usually feature a few hot and cold drinks, plus at least one caffeine-free option. My all-time fave is their Honey Lavender Latte or their Earl Grey Latte with Rose syrup. You won't find these flavor profiles at Starbucks (although they get plenty of my money too). I usually just get a mug of whatever drip coffee they're brewing and it's never let me down. \\n\\nFood: I've never had more than a bagel here so I can't speak much about the food.\\n\\nFinally, they offer rewards if you pay with your CC. Every month or so, you'll get a code for a discount on your next drink or a bag of beans.

It's very cozy and intimate. The chairs were a bit hard but even with that I was already planning to tell everyone about it and to come back. So, where did things go wrong? Okay, here we go...\\n\\nOnce we were seated our server came by said hello and took the order for the couple across from us. We weren't ready yet and were still perusing the menu. Once we decided what we wanted we waited for her to come back. She did not. Then the show started. The couple across from us had their food and drinks delivered (via food runners). Then our waitress (who neither my date or myself quite remembered what she looked like) attended to the table next to us several times. Walked past us multiple times. My date said I think that's our waitress, I said that can't possibly be her because, in my mind, why would she keep overlooking us? So, about halfway into the show, I ask one of the food runners could he please get our waitress. He said okay but she still never came. However, the same girl who we were thinking was our waitress walked past us several more times. At this point, we were really upset and didn't even want to order food anymore but my date still wanted a glass of wine at the very least. So, I pull another random food runner aside and ask for a manager. I explain to her that all we're trying to do is order a glass of wine. She takes the order but I tell her I'd like to still see a manager. \\n\\nSidebar: I can't tell you how frustrating it is when you're trying to watch an artist perform and instead you have to attend to things like this just to get a friggin drink! It really ruined our mood and the show which is unfortunate because Bilal really did put on a good show. Okay back to what happened...\\n\\nSo, now we are waiting for a manager and a glass of wine. The waitress came to our table to see how the people across from us were doing. We stop her before she leaves and ask did you get the wine order? She replies \\"yes, Pinot Noir\\" and walks off. I can't tell you how pissed I became because I couldn't understand why she wouldn't even acknowledge us especially when it had obviously been communicated to her. Not an, I'm sorry or I heard you were looking for me, my bad. Damn. Anything would have been nice at that point. But to walk up to our table and still not say anything to us was insulting. \\n\\nFinally, the wine comes. An older White guy came with 2 glasses of wine. I had not seen him before and he wasn't wearing all black so I figured he was the manager. I tell him we only ordered one glass. He sits one glass on the table and leaves. Hmm...okay so I guess he wasn't the manager. So about 15 more mins pass, still no manager and the show is winding down. The waitress returns and is handing out checks to everyone around us but not us. This prompted the couple across from us (who we did not even know) to ask her if she had a check for us. The waitress said okay and left. He turned to us and said, \\"Hey, it's the least I could do.\\" We thanked him. She brings our check. It's wrong. At this point, I'm seeing red. Actually what color is after red? Maybe I blacked out from infuriation. I explained to her that I need to speak with a manager and this is the second time I'm asking. I tell her the check is incorrect. She comes back with the correct check while I wait for the manager. The show is over and people are leaving. \\n\\nAn older Black guy also not wearing all black comes over. I explain the situation to him. The fact that we wanted to order food and ended up with one glass of wine. He starts telling me that it's 300 people in there and it gets really busy and basically making excuses. I tell him I understand that it's busy as I've worked in the restaurant industry and I'm not looking for 5-star service but I would like to at least be able to order SOMETHING especially when everyone else around you has been attended to. He then tells me that I shouldn't take it personal. I let him know that's kind of difficult when your waitress doesn't make eye contact or acknowledge you yet checks on everyone else around you. Or when some people you don't even know have to ask her for your check because she is blatantly ignoring you - it becomes difficult to not take it personally. And I want to take this moment to point out that we were a lesbian couple. I would really, REALLY, hope that in 2016, in Atlanta, GA that would not have been a reason to discriminate. I don't want to jump to that conclusion but it is a factor that needed to be said. \\n\\nSo, to end the story the manager comped the one glass of wine, basically told us it's busy so we shouldn't expect much in the way of service and don't take it personal. Nice job sir. I've never been so upset about customer service. City Winery should be ashamed and I will not be returning."},{"name":"Mikado Revolving Sushi & Hot Pot","address":"8371 International Dr, Ste 60","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"very good place to go ÔøΩ?i love hot pot and sushi so mach ÔºÅfood is great service is friendly"},{"name":"Bukowski Tavern","address":"1281 Cambridge St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3","text":"Bukowski in Cambridge has reopened as bizarro alternate-dimension Bukowski, with completely new decor, brighter lights, a completely new menu, new management, and the bar on the opposite side.

I can't read your life story on my phone before ordering from the menu.\\" \\n\\n[Time & Date of visit]: 7pm on a Saturday night.\\n\\n[Party Size]: 4\\n\\n[Location/Ambiance]: \\nThe restaurant is located in the center of the L shaped plaza, next door to quickly bubble tea. Since the grand opening of Little Sheep, there's been a boat load of more cars taking the parking spaces then before and is pretty limited on a early weekend night. There is parking in the back, though pretty shady looking. I would suggest, parking in Asian square and walking with another friend or with a group down the block. \\nEntering the restaurant there are tables to fit about 4 to a hot pot section, though the tables contain two burners, don't be afraid of being placed to share a table with strangers. I'm not sure how big of a group you would need for the larger round tables that are adjacent to the front entrance. After we arrived, there were smaller groups waiting for tables and crowding the front. Most patrons are Asian, specifically Chinese or Taiwanese, if that helps with how authentic the place is compared to what hot pot places you are used to.\\n \\nNoise level was average. Lighting is decent. \\n\\n[Service]:\\nHere's where it get's tricky. That night, there were really only two servers who spoke and understood English that provided attention to our groups table. We'll nick name them, tattoo guy and tall, chubby guy with glasses guy. The other servers really couldn't understand our request for some basics. Water refills weren't really coming our way. They do, some how get your order rotations with the colored pens correct though. \\n\\nNot everything is part of the AYCE menu, which is limited to 2 hours. And yes, your table is timed. And any meats and/or veggies that isn't in the broth or eaten, is charged to your table when you go to pay.\\nAs for ordering, we'll label these as courses. First course, you are given a specific colored pen. Mark your selections and provide a quantity. Then the server takes your paper menu with selections to the back, and sometime later they roll out a cart with your order. Second and third courses play out the same, but each time you are given a different colored pen to mark your options. So what if you're still hungry and it's the 4th, 5th, etc course? Glad you ask, you pretty much have to verbally ask a server for what selections you would like, a la AYCE KBBQ, and hope they remembered.  Once the soup starts getting low, they refill each side with the same broth with a large kettle, yes, even the spicy soup.\\n\\n\\n[Food Highlights]:\\n\\nTruthfully, I'm not that big on hot pot. So take my food section review with a grain of salt.... though my bestest would say I have plenty of it already. er.  Well anyway, beef and lamb are cut fresh with a meat deli style slicer, so it's thin enough to cook fast. The regular broth doesn't have much flavor, but the spicy broth has a good amount of chili oil floating on top. I poured half a ladle each in my own small bowl. For those of you who didn't grow up eating spicy food, I would suggest ordering a coke or something to wash the spicy broth down after. Most items are included on the AYCE selection, except for my personal favorites; tofu fish cakes and quail eggs. 4 orders of these, and I was pretty much paying for two people. Pay attention to items that aren't included or watch your bill jump up.\\n\\nFor anyone that wants a little more flavor, on the tables there are soy sauce, minced garlic in oil, hot mustard and I believe vinegar or more hot chili oil. I can't remember at the moment.\\n\\n[Total Bill w/ Tip & Tax]: Around $18 per person for the AYCE option. \\n\\n{Summary}:\\nJust like if you step into a Korean BBQ place where the servers really don't speak English, is going to be a challenge flagging down tattoo guy or chubby guy with glasses to get service. Maybe bring a friend who speaks Chinese would help out your meal. \\nThough they are the only ones who have done it so far for a AYCE hot pot, there are a couple of things that needed to be ironed out. For now, I'll give them 2.75 stars."},{"name":"Sckavone's","address":"4100 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Best tasting food.   The meatloaf was awesome!

This was my first time having okra, not fried, and it was top notch. I loved the fried onions on top. We had arrived at about 5pm and despite the restaurant being completely empty (aside from 1 table seated) we were told we could only sit at the tiny bar or outside.

While visiting our favorite city I was telling my wife that I was really craving sushi or kim bap. I have had this craving for about a week without the opportunity to give in to my weakness. While we were at the mall I remember expressing how badly I wanted sushi. Two minutes later we say this place, I laughed at the thought of getting something from there. I asked \\"am I that weak that I would venture down this questionable culinary alley\\" As soon as this thought came to mind one of the workers approached us with a sample of their special of the day which was their California roll, we were hungry and it looked good so we tried a sample. I have to admit, it was a very good California roll, so much so that I decided to go ahead and try them out. I will admit, I was skeptical to try anything with raw fish so I forewent that idea.\\n\\nTheir set up looks much like a typical modern day sushi joint, everything was made right there and looked pretty fresh. Like I said, I did not try anything with raw fish so I cannot vouch for that department. I ended up ordering their seaweed salad, a California Roll, & the Caterpillar roll. Were they the best rolls that I have had? No. Did it titillate my senses? Yes. I would say that it was as good if not better than most \\"conveyor\\" sushi joints. \\n\\nWould I come here again? If I am at this food court I would say more than likely I would. If I were to crave sushi again and had the freedom to go somewhere else I would.

I would have to say out of all that I've tried (besides the shoyu ramen), the chicken shio and spicy beef are my favorites. But if you want to try something a little different, I suggest you try the lamb tsukemen. Tsukemen is a ramen dish where the broth is served separately from the noodles, and you dip the noodles into the rich, thick broth. It's a different way to eat ramen, and makes for a fun dining experience. I believe Ramen Station and Momonoki so far are the only two ramen places that offer tsukemen in Atlanta, so it's not to be missed. \\n\\nAlso, don't miss out on their small bites.

I waited for a fresh pot which was nice and hot like it should be with a little more flavor. \\n\\nMy husband and I ordered the salmon eggs Benedict. It was good but also came to the table cold and the menu did not list potatoes as a side.. I can not have potatoes, therefor would of asked for a different side if I know that the Benny came with potatoes.\\n\\nOur friend had the burger with fries. Returning the fries because they were also cold. A restaurant that had food runners, upscale or not, should never have cold food delivered to their customers.\\n\\nOur server had a wonderful personality.....the restaurant is lovely and outside dining by the river is a treat but the hot food was a disappointment."},{"name":"Eagles Pizza","address":"2 N High St","city":"New Albany","stars":"4","text":"The pizza is incredibly dry. Your redneck friends' who have never had a great pizza with great ingredients that just explode in your mouth with each and every bite will tell you the food here is great though so watch out for that.\\n\\nSo much of everything just lacks flavor and it doesn't make you excited to eat it and it's just SO EXPENSIVE. I wouldn't mind paying these prices for a pizza but if I do no frozen grocery store pizza at 1/3 of the price should EVER taste better than the pizzas at a restaurant like what's offered at Eagles with their ridiculous prices. It's about $16 for the large.\\n\\nThey hardly use any pizza sauce which would be okay if the cheese compensated for the missing flavor explosion you expect but the cheese hardly stands out either. \\n\\nThe veggie pizzas are drier than the desert which seriously concerns me that they're either not being stored properly, or that they hardly use the veggies because they're not ordered much and that means the veggies are old, or they just buy the lowest quality veggie toppings.\\n\\nUPDATE:\\nSo a little while after eating Eagles pizza I bought a grocery store pizza made fresh at Meijers. Stuck it in the oven for 10 minutes and ate it. It was DELICIOUS, the cheese was fantastic! I spent $4 compared to Eagles where I spent $16 and got a lame pizza."}]`),O={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:z},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:H,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(n=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return n.name.toLowerCase().includes(e)||n.city.toLowerCase().includes(e)||n.text.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},E={class:"search-container"},N={class:"card-container"},R=["disabled"],D={key:0},j={key:1};function F(n,e,s,f,i,r){const u=p("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"üéâ Restaurant Reviews ü•≥")])],-1)),t("div",E,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"üîç",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=h=>i.searchQuery=h),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[v,i.searchQuery]])]),t("div",N,[(a(!0),o(y,null,m(r.filteredPoems,(h,g)=>(a(),k(u,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:i.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...h)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...h))},[i.isLoading?(a(),o("span",j,"Loading...")):(a(),o("span",D,"See more"))],8,R)):w("",!0)])}const G=c(O,[["render",F],["__scopeId","data-v-dbeaebef"]]),K=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotes/44.md","filePath":"quotes/44.md"}'),L={name:"quotes/44.md"},V=Object.assign(L,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(a(),o("div",null,[I(G)]))}});export{K as __pageData,V as default};
