As I said the girl that answered the phone was super nice and even though she said it would arrive in 30 minutes I would swear that it arrived even sooner than that.

Well here is the hard truth...the clam strips were a super let down, it seemed like they were all breading and I didn't taste much clam just fried batter strips in fact I didn't taste much at all and even salting didn't help. Good thing the tartar sauce was other worldly because I used it to also dip my fries in but I barely ate any of the clam strips yuck :( \\n\\nNow back to the good stuff...this roast beef...I was kind of saving this for the next day since I wasnt going to have time to pick up any food the next day for lunch but I knew I had to taste it hot and fresh like it was meant to be in order to properly judge it.

The atmosphere is intimate enough for a date but casual enough to bring a family. The lighting is dim and the interior is spacious and clean. The decor is simple yet fun and there is a small stage area for live music.  Our waiter was very attentive and brought us everything we asked for.\\n\\nNow on to the food... Their buffet is amazing and offers a variety of options such as fresh fruit, different types of salads, roasted pork, chicken lasagna, pasta, fish, etc. While this place didn't really offer anything that was super unique, it seemed like they found a way to elevate the normal rodizio-buffet options to something memorable and different. I found myself getting seconds of things that I normally don't touch at other places, such as the potato salad and the pasta. Our buffet dinner even came with a full plate of fried yuca, mashed potatoes and cheese balls. BEST. FRIED. YUCA. EVER. EVER, EVER, EVER. Did I mention EVER? The cheese balls were great too, explosive flavor with every additional bite. My only complaint: there were 4 and not a bazillion. \\n\\nBelieve it or not the meat was my least favorite part of this place. Yes, it is way less salty than all the other places. But I don't know if that's worth giving up the crispy \\"crust\\" on the outer most layer of the meats. To me, they were all too chewy and some of the pieces of beef that were cut off for us were suspiciously rare. I've worked in my fair share of fine-dining steak houses back in the day so I'm pretty familiar with what a \\"cool red center\\" is and a few of those slices were definitely not there yet. \\n\\nWe have been to our fair share of rodizios so we know what is typically offered. We ended up having to ask them to bring out the grilled pineapple and the chicken wings. (For some reason they just kept bringing out the same 3 options??) THOSE ARE TO DIE FOR. The grilled pineapple is juicy, tender and covered with cinnamon -- every bite is like a mouth full of warm pie. The chicken wings were crispy and juicy. OH and the chicken wrapped in bacon was the best I've ever had. Again, this is normally one of those things I never get because it's usually so dry. \\n\\nOn the way out we ended up grabbing a slice of strawberry cake and lemon cake to go.

I enjoyed the communal dining, we met some folks who were a pleasure to have dinner with.  The wine was very good.  The menu creativity was very good.\\n\\nBut, generally when I'm dining at a super-pricey, chef's-choice restaurant, I want a knock-my-socks-off-holy-crap-this-is-what-a-little-bit-of-heaven-tastes-like experience.  This should have been one of the best meals of my life, I rarely have the opportunity to have such a pricey meal.  Unfortunately, Beast did not deliver.  \\n\\nI understand this place is doing something different for which they're celebrated, but overall the entire experience felt rather undisciplined for such a costly affair.  The experience was Beast's to lose, for this level of eating establishment, high quality should be the baseline standard. Here's where I feel Beast disappointed:\\n\\nAesthetics:\\n- the chairs were awfully uncomfortable.  remember, you'll be sitting here for 3 hours.\\n- the decor (complete with silly anecdotes about poop written on the wall) including what the servers and staff were wearing was very casual and surprisingly scruffy.  I can get that sort of experience when I'm spending $10 a plate, not at a super-expensive dinner, thank you.\\n- pulling the paper towels off of the hot water heater might be cute, but again it's another place where perhaps Beast is 'original' but to me comes off as undisciplined.  We paid enough, now fix up the bathroom!\\n\\nThe Food:\\n- The presentation was sloppy!  I understand it's hard to make every dish beautiful but again, that's what I'm paying for.  Usually a hallmark of any high-end-cuisine place, the presentation was not consistent.\\n- Understand that the menu changes daily, so I'm sure on a different night that my experience might be different.  The night we went, besides the exceptions of a very delicious mixed green salad and a fabulous cream-of-celery soup, everything else was good, not great.\\n-Wine pairings were half-pour servings.  That was a bit of a turn off as well.  Is this what other places do?\\n-I guess the container which held the half and half for my coffee was aesthetically pleasing, but it was the sloppiest milk pourer of my life.  This is another small detail that is telling of the lack of consistency with Beast.\\n\\nUltimately, if this place were half the price, I'd probably be writing a rave review right now, but with the amount of hype and the price of this joint, I'm afraid I would not recommend it to folks looking for the ultimate dining experience."},{"name":"Buckhead Bottle Bar & Bistro","address":"268 E Paces Ferry Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2.5","text":"As I suspected, I still find these places pretentious and devoid of anything resembling personality.

I can't believe a Korean food cart just opened over the late summer. It started off as a corn cob bbq food stand, but I guess that didn't go way. So the Korean ladies that run it decided to run a korean bento food cart. Korean cuisine is usually meat based. Such as Kalbi (pork chop), Bugolgi (bbq beef rib), and of course, tofu. Bibimbop is basically a bowl of white rice, bedded with vegetables from spinach, mushroom, bean sprouts, and pickled relish and some tofu (usually served with meat). The lady who runs the cart is also really friendly. Everytime I eat there she always give me a generous serving of soup, or yam noodle salad, and sometimes hot tea. Bibimbop goes for $5.50 The most expensive item on the menu is $6. California rolls go for $4. Not too shabby.

I ended up ordering two vegan tacos with roasted potatoes. The tacos were good, but the potatoes were great. I also tried the Fiance's corn and it was pretty darn great. I think you can make a great veggie meal here using the 1 taco option and their GYNORMO sides. With that being said, I agree with another veggie reviewer that stated that they clearly spent a ton of time perfecting each and every taco and it seems like they took 17 seconds to develop the veggie taco with little thought about it.

I had to throw the sandwich away since the tomato was originally on it.  Then today I placed another order and the same thing happened with my sandwich.  They remade it but I am on a lunch break so with the extra time needed to correct my order that left me with no time to eat.

One negative to that, however, is the cost of parking now that they're charging. So, you're looking for some new fried chicken, right? And you're thinking to yourself how cool it might be to have your favorite new chicken spot located in the hipster-centric new PCM, yeah, you know who you are. For starters, it's good chicken, it's not bad chicken, it's your basic, pretty tasty, pretty greasy, fried chicken. A buck gets you a wing, a couple bucks gets you a drumstick, a few bucks gets you a thigh, and four bucks gets you a breast, get all of those (a half chicken for those of you not counting) for $9; yes, you save $1 by purchasing all of them together, and you'll save $3 if you buy the whole chicken at $17 versus $20 for all those pieces times two, a la carte. \\n\\nWas it dry? No. Was it tender and juicy? Yes. Was it greasy? Yes. Did I enjoy it? Yes. Was it well-seasoned? Sure. Are there sauces to choose from? Yes. In our case, we asked for three but were given two; we're not sure what happened there. The honey mustard was tangy and strong, and the frim fram was sweet and rich. We also had two of the four sides (well, three if you count the two buttermilk rolls which came with the half chicken purchase). We got the mac & cheese and coleslaw. They were fine, nothing over the top. The mac & cheese was a little more oily versus cheesy, so an improvement could be made there. The buttermilk rolls were good, small, but good. They were nice and buttery on top, and light and fluffy in the middle. We also each had a lemonade for $3 each. It was good, basic lemonade with no pulp, but I did like their size of crushed ice, and the cute beverage dispenser that it came from. The red and white striped straws were a plus, too. But, they gave us lids that the straws didn't fit in, they were more like coffee lids, not lids for straws, weird.\\n\\nI assumed that we would have been full after what we ordered, and although the food was good, it really wasn't all that much. I commented to my husband that one of us might have been able to eat all that food. We would have been stuffed, but it could have been done. That said, the portion sizes were probably, dare I say, appropriate. We're not part of the obese in the USA today, so we'll just keep it that way. It's definitely not a \\"must go\\" restaurant, but it's totally fine if you're at PCM and are craving a decent fried chicken meal."},{"name":"Rino's Place","address":"258 Saratoga St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Wait wasn't as long as last time.

The reddish sauce was incredible - slightly spicy with a deep savory flavor. And unsurprisingly, the mozzarella stretched irresistibly, and the fried egg had a firm white with a sauce-like yolk - just the way I like it.\\n- Fried egg and cheddar biscuit with smoked guanciale: I'd never tried guanciale (pork jowl bacon) before, but after trying it here, I'm a full-fledged guanciale evangelist. It was like bacon with the ideal balance of crispiness, fattiness, and smoked flavor.

The area that surrounds the pub is definitely questionable, but the pub itself is very safe and extremely welcoming. \\n\\nAlthough I wish they had more beer on tap, I found their selection very diverse and catering to nearly every beer bud. We started our meal by splitting the calamari, which was perfectly battered. It came with a Thai sweet and sour sauce that most likely wasn't homemade, but the batter more than made up for it. \\n\\nWhen our fish and chips arrived, I thought I was eating a piece of heaven. It was flaky, smooth, and every bit as delicious as it appeared. The fish neatly melted into my mouth and went absolutely perfectly with a tall glass of beer. The fries were pretty nondescript and seemed frozen, which made me slightly disappointed as I was hoping for actual potato wedges. \\n\\nIn addition to the food, the service is top notch. I really felt like I had arrived at a neighborhood pub where everybody knows your name. The service was excellent, attentive, and more than accommodating. Despite its distance from the city, this restaurant is one of Atlanta's best gems. Stop by before you take a flight or on your way back home. It doesn't disappoint.\\n\\nP.S.

Maybe not as much in the last few years, but certainly probably 2 dozen times for a variety of occassions and when Richard opened up the Jazz Bar, I was thrilled. But, last Saturday's episode will be my last. Prior to going to a concert across the street at The Cabot, I was in a party of four and reservations were made at least a week in advance. When I arrived, the table we were given could have fit six and was pushed into a corner right next to the front window so tightly that three out of four of us felt jammed in; no one could move. There was also a long table in the middle of this dining room that must have had 16 people at it. That accounts for why this table for six was pushed into the corner, I suppose. With that crowd, we couldn't hear half of was said. I'm not saying that they shouldnt have taken a reservation for 16 or so, but please, put them in the smaller dining room; their presence just overwhelmed the entire room. It was 50 something degrees outside and the air conditioning was on with the vent right next to two of us, blowing like crazy. OK, the room was crowded and perhaps someone on the far side of the room was warm, but a person at the table next to me had thier coat on the entire time. Two requests to do something about it fell on deaf ears, so we put two pocketbooks over the vents to survive. Nicole (spelling?) was our waitress, and she did nothing to make the evening any better. When presented with our menus we asked if there were any specials for the evening. She said she didn't know but would check. Shouldn't she know? She took our drink order and departed. She returned and mentioned two specials and said she'd be right back. We put in an order of two apps. When she returned we mentioned we had an 8PM show to get to. When we began to order, she tersely announced that the specials were no longer available. This was at 6pm on a Saturday night. No longer available? At 6pm? I don't get it. I won't address the food. Quality has always been top notch. Wonderfully inventive and fabulously prepared each and every time I've gone. It took an much longer time than usual to get our meals (perhaps due to the large party taking up the majority of the waitstaff/kitchen's attention?) and as she was clearing the table, one of us mentioned that we had a show to get to, she replied with an attitude: \\"I know. I heard you the first time.\\" Really? Dining is an experience, and overall experience, not just the food. I will miss the food bacause I'll never go back.

It's in the parking lot right across from the windows in the dining room and totally in view of customers. As a non-smoker I think it's pretty unappetizing to look outside and see various employees cycling in and out of the restaurant to smoke a cigarette.

Salad was delicious but the crouton in there was seriously some amazing croutons! Our donut came out next even though I wanted it last, oh well. All of our food came out after that. The bacon and the jerky on the breakfast board was definitely the best part. I love the tender and juicy steak that was on steak and cheddar egg.

My husband and I popped in here on a rainy Friday night.  First of all, insanely cute, very big, and a bit slow.  We stood in the doorway for maybe a few minutes before someone noticed us.  This may be a problem because we noticed several couples, even a small group of people, pop into the restaurant, wait at the \\"to be seated\\" sign, and then leave because no one bothered to check out the front of the house.\\n\\nThe waitress welcomed us and promptly left to go set us up a table next to a loudly shrieking baby.  Wait a minute - the restaurant is half empty.  My husband and I both agreed, there was no way in hell we were going to sit where she was setting us up.  There is loads of space in every direction - why would you sit us next to someone having a parent-child meltdown?  When she came back we asked her if we could sit literally anywhere else.  She looked confused so we pointed at a table with plush seats near the front of the house.  She obliged but said it would take time for them to clean that table.  That's fine, but lord this place is slow.  She could have just maybe waited two seconds before cleaning the first table when she greeted us?\\n\\nThe menu looks amazing.  When we started looking at our options we got dizzy with choices.  They have a seasonal menu with all sorts of regional goods - we saw salmon, wild boar, pumpkin gnocchi, oven roasted chicken, garlic bread.  We went with some garlic bread appetizer and both ended up ordering the wild boar over noodles for our main dinner.  And then we made the mistake of ordering tea to start us off with.\\n\\nThe restaurant has lovely tea cups.  There is a miniature tea pot that sits directly over your tea cup.  Brew in your pot, pour into your cup.  But when we wanted milk or sugar it took fifteen minutes of waiting before we just got up and asked a random waiter if he could just oblige us.  They put the milk in an espresso cup, which I guess this is a minor thing but it created a big mess - they didn't have a little milk jug or something with a lip/spout.  It's extremely difficult to measure out how much milk you want from an espresso cup, especially when they've given you one espresso cup for two people's worth of tea.\\n\\nAside from the mess we made trying to drink our tea, the food was amazing.  Not the restaurant's fault, but the shrieking baby in the middle of the restaurant continued to lose its shit for the entire time we were there.  The baby was there before we got there, and the family seated with it didn't look like they were leaving by the time we paid up and left.  It seems really inconsiderate, not just to other patrons but to the baby who is clearly suffering and doesn't want to be there anymore or might need something that can in no way be provided in a downtown restaurant.\\n\\nAgain the restaurant was a bit slow.  We thought about dessert and even told a waiter we wanted to see a dessert menu.  We waited and waited, watched a few people pop in and leave when no one sat them promptly, and then we realized it was probably best we stop while we're ahead.  The wild boar was so perfect we didn't want our evening to sour listening to a stranger's baby shriek for another hour.  By the time the waiter came back we told him it took them so long to get back to us we were ready to leave.  We paid a fairly reasonable price for our dinners (I think it roughly $15/plate, for some of the best wild boar I've had in ages).  We walked home in the rain and filled up on ice cream back at our apartment.  \\n\\nWe definitely want to come back again, maybe just sit down right away and tell a waiter later when they notice we're there.  I recommend showing up and being a bit pushy because the staff might forget you're there.  Order right away or go flag down a waiter the second you scan one in vicinity (probably they will be turned away from you, deliberately avoiding any and all eye contact).  Tell the waiter what you want and as soon as they serve the food ask for the check.  You will eat a superb meal and you can thank me later for the little trick I've just taught you. I'm sure Picnic House will ease its bumps in the road as it finds its place as a restaurant.  This is only the beginning.  I'm delighted to try what they serve me next."},{"name":"Burger King","address":"1 Jeff Fuqua Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"2","text":"I normally do not eat at Burger King. Not so much because of the food, but having experienced bad customer service at a few locations. Flying to Atlanta for the Christmas holiday, I did not have time to eat breakfast at home, since I had to be at the airport early in the morning. With not much of a selection at the terminal, I settled on the Burger King since breakfast sandwiches were available.\\nWith the large volume of holiday travelers, there was a long line at the counter. Juices and bottled drinks are available at the beginning of the line. From there, you get your tray and go to the counter, where wrapped sandwiches are served in a heated reach in window. Photos of the variety of sandwiches served are posted above the slide the sandwiches are served. Gives a whole new meaning to the term \\"slider\\".\\nAnyway, grab your sandwich and go. French toast sticks, hash rounds, and coffee are available further down the line. From there, you go to the left where there is another counter for the cashier.Jontisha, the cashier on duty, thanked every customer after their purchase and wished them a great day.\\nThe only problem experienced was a wait for the breakfast sandwiches. Obviously, this Burger King was short of staff. If someone had called in sick, I can understand. But if it is a case on cutting costs by making due with the least amount of staff, this is not the time to be cutting costs on labor. Especially with the large number of holiday travelers in the airport looking to eat. Otherwise, my food was served hot. Nothing like a hot breakfast to get you going in the morning. Two breakfast sandwiches and a orange juice cost $10.72.\\nOne problem I had at this Burger King location was from a previous flight, in which I arrived at the airport after 10:00 a.m., only to find that the lunch menu was being served, and that there were no breakfast offerings. It would have been nice to have a few breakfast sandwiches served to at least 11:00 a.m.\\nIf I am flying soon and my flight is early, I would stop in again.

The portion sizes were decent for a specialized menu offering, and the food didn't taste as if it had been rushed. My salmon was perfectly smoked / cooked, and the profiterole was quite impressive.  The waiter was just as friendly and helpful as if we were paying for a full-priced meal, which didn't detract from the service.\\n\\nThe second time around I ordered the steamed mussels with cream sauce, the grilled skirt steak frites with bearnaise sauce for an entree (medium rare), and the mousse au chocolat for dessert. Again, the waiter was courteous and even tried to entice my guest and me to order an extra glass of wine after we finished our first one halfway through the entree. I must say that the waiters have excellent marketing skills and know how to treat their customers well.

This new place along fairbanks gave me and my husband a not-so-nice experience with ordering.\\nMy husband had been insisting me to try this place since it Opened few weeks back, I had been reluctant because of the bad traffic where its at but last night, I decided to give it a try. I called and ordered to be pick up by husband from his work, the woman on the phone was in a hurry and had asked me several times which side do I want for the entrees, but she was able to get the order and gave me the total amount, Also informed him that its my husband will pick up & gave my husbands name. My husband came home with the food, he said at first they couldnt find the order because they couldnt find his name & also he did not know the food with it, they were able to find the order because of the amount I gave him in the name of \\"DAVID\\" well that's not my husband name so they screwed up. As I prepared the food on the table, I noticed that there is no rice, I called the restaurant and spoke with the same person who took my order and told her the rice is missing, she asked me whether I would like to come back and get it ( are you serious?) or will get an extra rice next time I order- I chose the latter. When my husband opened the food, he was looking for the lettuce as I also ordered a chicken lettuce wrap and it was missing! So I called again and this time my husband wanted to go back and get the missing food items! So my husband drove there again, I'd say its 8-10 minutes drive each way and he came back only to find out that we were given 3 tiny leaves of lettuce also the rice is not white but rather yellow- so I say not restaurant quality. The cashier is not even apologetic, as if they did not waste a customers time and effort for their own mistake. Their ordering system is a JOKE! The food is OK as well- we had mongolian steak on a noodle, bulgogi chicken supposedly with the missing rice and crab wonton. If there is Panda Express nearby I am sure they will have more patron than this one.

When it comes down to the burgers, they're pretty decent. not amazing, but certainly not bad for the price especially. I mentioned before I thought they were a downgrade from Flippin, but I think I can put that opinion to rest.  and it's worth noting that everything else about the place is a huge improvement over the previous establishment. It's pretty common to see a revolving door scenario with some places changing ownership frequently but never improving, but this isn't the case here. \\n\\nand yeah \\"counter girl\\" is a cutey.\\n\\n----------------------------------\\n\\nOLD REVIEW BELOW\\n\\n\\"Meh\\" about sums it up.  I've been to this place twice now, and considering who it replaced.. it's a downgrade.\\n\\nThis review will primarily be a comparison to Flippin' Burgers (the place that occupied this spot previously)\\n\\nOne thing I will say in their favor, is that they are quick. Flippin' could take 15 minutes to get a burger sometimes (or longer!).  Both times I've been to Lee's I stopped in, ordered, went to refill my parking meter, and when I came back the guy was wrapping up my order.  \\n\\nThe staff here is also very nice, and responsive, also a nice change from Flippin' Burgers, whose employees (with the exception of the pony-tailed cook) were as apathetic as is humanly possible.\\n\\nThe place is clean, and seems well organized, with a good workflow. also a nice change from Flippin'...\\n\\nBut!  here's the rub.  The food is just not that good.  Flippin' Burgers' patties were far juicier, and had some pretty killer flavor.  The patties at Lee's are just pretty average.  they're cooked.. well they didn't ask how to cook it, so i assume they try t aim for medium-well to be safe.  that's what i got anyway (and i like em medium-rare - medium).  Also no cheese options at Lee's, they serve american cheese, which is the most boring cheese you can put on a burger.  At Flippin' they defaulted to cheddar i believe, but also had a jalapeno cheese as well.\\n\\nThe fries are almost identical, so no problem there, they're pretty tasty, and it's a good portion.\\n\\nThe prices are comparable, so no issue there either really.\\n\\nThe only reason this place even got 2 stars was because they still have Flippin' Burgers' special sauce, which is amazing. (seems like just a blend of honey-mustard, mayo, and cayenne pepper maybe, but still...)\\n\\n--------------------------\\n\\nI know it sounds like there are more points in Lee's favor, but when it comes down to it, I was willing to put up with a sluggish chud of an employee at Fiippin' if it meant I was getting a frigging tasty burger!"},{"name":"Haley House Bakery Caf√©","address":"12 Dade St","city":"Roxbury","stars":"4.5","text":"Maple walnut scone is a little hunk of heaven.

It was dark inside and not a whole lot going on.  The fact that we were the only ones in there might have played a part in that also, since I think having a room full of people brightens up a place and makes things more interesting.

Hold the fruit in your non-dominant hand with your thumb near the top pole and your pinky supporting the bottom.\\n2.) Take the knife and cut toward you, slowly, through the peel.

The dish had great flavor with a small hint of spice, but nothing anyone couldn't handle (take it from the spice wimp myself!), and with a surprise sweet topping of apricots, which seemed to tie in well with the meal as a whole. My only concern was how hard and crispy the waffle was. I could barely cut the waffle with the knife at my table. The same goes with the chicken, even though it had a great crispy, tasty skin it was extremely difficult to cut, which means it was difficult to chew. The chicken seemed be dry and very thick. All this tied with the price of $18 for chicken and waffles, the place fell short for me, hence the 3 stars.

We had the rigatoni affumicati ($20) and chicken limone with penne pasta ($22), in an effort to try one pasta dish and one meat dish. Both were cooked well with ingredients that complement each other, but there was a general lack of flavor. Perhaps people in Sardinia prefer blander meals, but we thought it could've been better seasoned.\\n\\nOverall, the food is decent and quite unique, but overpriced for the taste and quality.

First off, this was my first visit to Maki Maki and I had heard wonderful things prior to my visit... Boy was this disappointing.\\n\\nWe had a party of 15, which isn't a problem assuming you have a staff that can comprehend how to organize accordingly. Which they don't. The waiter was rather confused, inattentive and bothered with our questions about the menu and immediately called the manager to help. Now an interesting thing to note for all those intending to visit:\\n\\nIf your party has a mix of buffet eaters and non-buffet eaters, they must eat separately. Literally this rule is enforced and not listed anywhere on their website. Apparently due to people abusing the buffet they decided regardless of who you came with, you need to sit separate in order to not share your food. And trust me, they watch you eat! How tacky.\\n\\nNow onto the food: my friend and I were forced to order from the non-buffet menu and found the food to be undercooked, tasteless and clearly rushed. The teriyaki chicken was still pink, the alligator maki had more cucumbers than meat and our iced waters were warm, because apparently they charge by the ice cube...So after all that fuss, a complete waste of money and time. \\n\\nMy message to management would be to be careful with their rules, especially when it isn't properly advertised anywhere on their website or restaurant. And honestly? If they're so concerned about money, you're going to lose out on lots of good customers. My party of 15 literally were forced to be segregated and frustrated prior to their meal simply because of a tactless policy the manager informed us of too late. Had we known, we wouldn't have come! \\n\\nIf I could, I'd give it 0 stars. Never ever returning, and I'm quite sure neither of my friends will."},{"name":"The Garden Gate Cafe","address":"7960 Niwot Rd, Ste B4","city":"Niwot","stars":"4","text":"This is such a cute little place.

I had the spinach artichoke dip and half Mediterranean flatbread. They were both fantastic. But the flatbread seemed like it had regular tomatoes on it and not the plum style listed on the menu which threw the taste off. Not a huge deal though. My first bite I hit a kalamata olive seed, no olive just seed, but that's something that happens with olives especially kalamata. The bartender was hot but didn't seem much interested in being there since he was texting regularly. Maybe I wasn't his type or he didn't swing my way, but regardless as a bartender you should make everyone feel wanted at your bar. The best appeal was the laid back environment. I walked into another restaurant and it was a loud obnoxious dj  restaurant turned club after 10 pm on a Wednesday I guess so i left there and found myself at this location.

I'll start with all the positives.  First of all the decor of this place was very unique and interesting. The beer list was off the charts and the other drinks on the menu sounded as interesting as the decor.  The food was delicious.  We had a wide variety of items from asparagus, to edamame with pop rocks, to pork cheek, to the egg and the pea, all of it was delicious.  I personally had the pork tacos and they were mouth watering.  \\n\\nUnfortunately, when the bill came my stomach was nowhere near full.  No one should ever have to pay that much money for a meal and walk away wondering if they are going to have to stop at P. Terry's on the way home.

My. Gawd. Becky. \\n\\nLook at my gut. \\n\\nIt is filled with the most delicious food put on this Earth. Where can you get this food? This feeling? How do you turn a curmudgeon into an elated curmudgeon? 4 little words: New Taste of India. \\n\\nI am terribly sorry other food carts of Portland. I want to try you. I'd love to support you. But YOU are not New Taste of India, my friends. And therefore I cannot physically eat at any of your stands. Seriously. \\n\\nThere are two locations for this wunderkart, one by PSU on SW 4th and another in a food cart pod on 5th right off the MAX yellow and green lines. I've been to them both, but I'm a major player down at the 4th St locale. However, I love them both equally. More importantly, They love ME both equally. \\n\\nFor $6 you get a biodegradable carton jam packed with tasty tasty food. I have what doctors refer to as a \\"healthy appetite,\\" and I still can easily get two meals from one container, and eek out three if I'm not hungover. For a few bucks more, you can get two crispy, flaky, sexy samosas and have dinner for 2 for under $10. \\n\\nYeah, so I like the value. I also really like the food. Everything I have gotten there has been as good, if not better, than fancy places with linen table cloths and Indian Pop playing in the background. Everything I have tried (most of the vegetarian menu) has been super fresh, aromatic and absolutely perfect. \\n\\nIn addition to the awesome value for awesome food, the people that own/work at these carts are truly amazing and nice people. This review is based on multiple visits, and nothing has ever varied. I have great experiences EVERY time. At both locations I am always greeted with a huge smile, and my food is ready to go when I am (due to short lunch breaks, I phone in my order. I recommend doing this if you are in a hurry or impatient. Since they make everything fresh and made to order outside of the lunch specials, you can expect to wait 10 minutes for your order--as with any food cart.) \\n\\nAs, always there are drawbacks. For New taste of India, I really don't think its fair that this grindage is not available to me 24 hours a day and it's also a shame that neither cart is not located in my backyard. But, I guess I can let those glaring oversights slide."},{"name":"Sweet Hereafter","address":"3326 SE Belmont St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"This is one of my favorite places in Portland.

After driving by a few times we decided to give these guys a chance.\\n\\nWe ordered a small pizza with bacon and olives and unlike some of the other local competitors there was no shortage of either topping.  You could actually see the the bacon!  The crust was golden and buttery but not greasy, and the sauce was a perfect balance of sweet and salty.\\n\\n The same was true with the potato skins, large potatoes loaded with cheese and bacon and a \\"real\\" amount of sour cream, not those little 2 dip cups. \\n\\n I ordered a Greek salad with Tuna.  The amount of tuna they gave me was perfect and delicious!  The lettuce was fresh, not brown, bagged, or water logged as other places have sent.  The greek dressing was fantastic as well.\\n\\nI know my review may sound a little excited but I am a professional chef and the other pizza shops we've been trying have been horrible with horrible service (One of the delivery men actually started yelling at me over the price that was on the slip that his glasses were not strong enough to read).

As someone who spent most of his life in California (LA and San Francisco) I was flabbergasted and repulsed at the nerve these people had feeding me this slop to put in my body. The WORST food I've had in Atlanta since I've arrived.. The absolute WORST. EVER. The first Moe's I went to was in Atlantic Station. I went there for a quick bite and as soon as I walked in I noticed the strong scent of cleaning chemicals while they were still open. The Staff must've been in a hurry to leave but the combination of the ingredients mixed with the chemicals made me nauseous so we turned around and walked right out. I thought I'd give Moe's a second chance so I went to this location. I walked in and thought I'd get nachos, I mean how hard can it be screw up nachos? Super basic right?  I'm going down their gruel line and strike 1: They don't have refried beans! What? AYFK me? What Mexican place doesn't have refried beans? FAIL. Strike 2: Lady asks me if I'd like queso sauce. Sure! They're nachos after all. She lifts up a ladle and pours this white, watery, Mac n cheese powdered mix, looking (and tasting) diarrhea inducer all over my chips. Great! Now my chips are gonna be soggy, thanks! FAIL. Strike #3 I'm eating my soggy slop nachos and notice the distinct aroma of roach spray while I'm eating... I'm done- I can't. I hadn't even eaten a quarter of my meal when I took the basket of slop and placed it where it belonged, in the garbage. I was seriously disgusted and offended that I even put this crap in my body. Needless to say I will NEVER EVER eat at any Moe's establishments again. EVER.

Next strips were just as bad, sent them back and then on the third try not much better and the rest of the breakfast was already consumed.

It's not that I'm all that picky but serving way undercooked bacon is a health hazard on top of tasting bad and being hard to eat. Had to ask for coffee more than once until it was refilled also.

Whenever I'm in Austin, I usually have my mind locked down on barbecue and any other food unique to the region.\\n\\nJester King is a bit out of the way, so you'll have to rent a car to get to the brewery.\\n\\nI loved that they were open late, so I was able to visit after dinner to pick up some of their rare beers. In Austin, you can find their beers at some craft beer specialty stores, such as Sunrise Mini Mart, but there are some beers that they brew that you can only taste and buy at the brewery.\\n\\nJester King is located about 25 minutes from Downtown Austin. You'll have to hop on the freeway, then take a drive through a small road to reach the brewery.  Thanks to Waze, I made it without getting lost. It was really dark and felt really remote driving there.\\n\\nI walked into the tasting room and went straight to the refrigerator to check out their selection. I was promptly asked if I needed any help and told that they have a bottle list and larger selection outside at the tent.  I ended up purchasing 4 bottles, bottles that Brian helped me select. I told Brian that I was looking for something rare and something I couldn't buy outside the brewery.  I also purchased a souvenir Jester King Brewery stemware to bring home. \\n\\nBottles I purchased:\\n\\nRepos√© - \\"Inspired by the dusty, hay-filled stone barns of the Nord de France that likely gave way to the rise of Bi√®re de Garde, we included a small portion of hay in the mash for this beer. Taking a further cue from the slow and steady winter fermentation of the style, we allowed Repos√© to rest in brandy barrels for almost a year. Unfiltered, unpasteurized, and 100% bottle-conditioned.\\"\\n\\nOl' Oi - \\"In Britain, what started out as young or \\"mild\\" dark ale was once aged in oak barrels to make beer that was likely similar to sour brown ales of East Flanders. Using a similar base recipe to Commercial Suicide Farmhouse Mild Ale, Ol' Oi is our tribute to that tradition.\\"\\n\\nAutumnal Dichotomous - \\"2014 Autumnal Dichotomous, our fall saison, explores the nostalgic aromas and flavors of fall. Longpepper and sage were used sparingly to accentuate the subtleties of roasted squash. Naturally occurring wild yeasts and bacteria impart a sense of place to this unfiltered, unpasteurized, and 100% bottle-conditioned beer.\\"\\n\\nGotlandsdricka - \\"Gotlandsdricka, meaning \\"Drink of the Land of Goths,\\" is believed to have been the beer of the Vikings. Our rendition of this ancient style is inspired by the traditional farmhouse ales once brewed on the island of Gotland, off the coast of Sweden. Unfiltered, unpasteurized, and 100% naturally conditioned.\\"\\n\\nAfter buying the bottles I did a tasting in the tasting room for a fee per tasting.  I also was curious to see the area where they brew the beers. I was given a quick tour of the facility and the brewing process at Jester King. \\n\\nI loved my experience here and highly recommend a stop here to bring some beers back home.  These beers among the best in the world. I was told that the brewer at Cantillon drinks Jester King Brewery beers while he serves their beers. \\n\\nTheir experimental beers are among the most sought after in the world and the best in the state of Texas. \\n\\nThey are the only farmhouse brewery in Texas that allows natural yeast to ferment their beers.

They finally opened yesterday and Juan and I decided to check it out. I find that this restaurant's layout is a bit annoying since Parking seems limited and cramped. However, we parked in the back and upon entering we were immediately greeted and given menus.  We quickly went over it and got in line. We asked a few questions about the menu items to the nice ladies that greeted us (while we waited in line) and eventually to our cashier. The three of them where a bit confused about some items, however, quickly found out the information we were asking about and made welcomed recommendations. Paying was a breeze and we were given a coupon booklet (Hooray!!). We probably waited for our food around 15 minutes, which I thought was fair, considering their food is made \\"fresh\\". We calmed our hunger with the complementary breadsticks they have at their \\"Roundtable of flavors\\". (This round table has sauces, garlic, parmesan cheese, jalape√±os, olive oil and other spices). Juan had their full \\"Cobb Salad\\"  ($8.79) with a side of their famous \\"Six Cheese Pimiento Mac  & Cheese with Bacon\\"($5.99).  I had their Margherita Personal Pizza ($6.85).

We were immediately served water and brought menus, and then asked about a cocktail order. Service was swift and professional.\\nThe best part is the food. I had the Mahi-Mahi special and it is to die for. Also had a Caesar salad and it was top flight.

We had a reservation for 12:10pm, so there was no wait for our table. The service was great, up until the very end when it took our waitress 45 minutes from the time we were all done eating to get us our bill, pick up the card, and get us out the door. That, in combination with the time it took between the first and last plate to be served at our table is the reason for my 4 stars instead of 5. \\n\\nThe atmosphere is very... Portland. There is moss on some of the walls, antique woodblock printing blocks embedded in moss walls and creating mosaics on other walls. There is a bear head with a bowler hat, some cutesy poems and sayings painted on the walls, and they bring your bill to you in an antique book. All of these \\"weird\\" things mesh together pretty well but there is a definite vibe that Picnic House is trying to \\"keep Portland weird\\".\\n\\nFor lunch, you can choose to have a combo of half salad, half sandwich, and cup of soup, or just two of those three options. I chose to do a combo of 3, to sample as many of their menu items as possible, since everything sounded really tasty.\\n\\nThe wild mushroom soup with white wine and thyme was probably my favorite. It was so good in fact, that I almost question if this item was vegetarian. The soup was full bodied and hearty, which made me wonder if there was a chicken stock base. I forgot to ask before and after ordering, but it wasn't indicated anywhere on the menu that there was meat in it, so I'm hoping there wasn't. I'm also told this place is pretty vegan friendly, so I'm guessing it was just ridiculously good soup.\\n\\nFor my half sandwich, I chose the grilled cheese with caramelized onions, aged cheddar, and fresh cheeses. This was really closer to a cheese panini than a grilled cheese, as I don't think there was any oil or butter on the exterior of the sandwich to brown it, and it had grill press lines on the outside. The cheeses and onions inside were good, but the winner in this sandwich was really the bread. Very crispy/crunchy and fresh tasting.\\n\\nThe salad I tried was the mixed greens with pickled blueberries, seasonal berries, candied almonds, feta cheese, and a fig butter vinaigrette. This was also really wonderful. Of the three, this definitely had the most complex flavor profile, and every element worked together. The fig butter vinaigrette was the one part I wasn't sure I'd care for, but it really complimented the pickled blueberries and greens very well. \\n\\nAll in all, the food was superb and I'd have no problems going back a second or third time to sample everything (vegetarian) on the menu."},{"name":"Turner's Seafood - Salem","address":"43 Church St","city":"Salem","stars":"4.5","text":"Great food, service, and hospitality!  4.5 stars.

No. I've been there twice and ran into the same issues mainly because we had the same server.

Only three other parties there and other staff was taking care of them.\\n\\n2. I ordered a decaf coffee, sausage, two eggs and  vegetables. He placed the order down on the table and quickly walked away. There was no: \\"can I get you anything else?\\"\\n\\n3. To which I would have replied: hot sauce, the sausage I ordered and my decaf coffee I ordered 25 minutes ago. Instead I was forced to get up and ask for my coffee.\\n\\n4. He brought the coffee over and said \\"oops this is regular coffee\\" and the brought decaf back over. \\n\\n5. When I asked if the food was cooked in olive oil he replied yes. Can't be certain but I'm pretty sure it's not. Do not yes me to death. Do your damn job. \\n\\nThis is not rocket science guys. Here's a pretty easy formula for customer service:\\n\\n1.

If it looks inedible don't put it in front of us\\n9. Bring the edible food to the table and ask is there anything else I can bring you?\\n10. Watch the table to make sure we look satisfied\\n11. Come back and ask how things are and if we need anything else\\n12. Take the plates away\\n13. Bring the check and say \\"whenever you are ready\\"\\n14. Run the card\\n15. Bring it back and say thanks for coming in \\n\\nJust something to strive for if you want locals to enjoy your spot. If you're looking for tourists for a one and done situation, you can continue to operate the same way, but expect more reviews like this.

I thought the food was pretty good. And the person who served our table was very helpful and nice.  He got a big tip. However, the customer service skills and sense of the bartender and the manager were odd.  My friend had parked at a meter right outside the restaurant and we used up all the quarters we had between us but only had enough for about an hour and 15 minutes.  My friend had a lot of change in dimes and nickels, so she asked the bartender to exchange $1 in small change for 4 quarters.  He made a strange comment about how it was going to come out of his pocket even though my friend gave him a dollar in change.  We had dinner.  We were having a nice time and had just ordered dessert when we realized that my friend's meter was going to run out.  We gave our waiter more change and asked if we could get two more quarters for an additional half hour so we could eat dessert, perhaps order more to drink, etc. without being rushed.  He came back shamefaced to let us know that the bartender had refused because it was \\"coming out of his pocket\\".  The manager came over and we explained that we couldn't understand why the bartender was being so unreasonable because we were not asking to be given quarters for nothing, but just asking him to exchange our smaller change.  The manager told us that he could sell us a roll of quarters for $10.  I pulled out a $20 bill and told the manager that this was ridiculous and not a good reason to upset customers who were otherwise having a really nice time.  We were asking for quarters in order to stay longer to spend more money at this establishment.  At that point the manager got very defensive and said we were yelling at him, which we denied.  He then took our check and, in an effort to make amends, adjusted our bill.  To which I said, \\"Thank you\\", paid and left.  The bottom line is that instead of giving us two more quarters, the restaurant ended up giving us about $15-20 of free food and drinks, and losing two customers who might have otherwise returned to try some of the other things on their menu.  Go figure.  If their parking lot in the back is full and you don't have a Somerville resident parking sticker, make sure you have a lot of quarters.  The restaurant will not help you. The meters only give you 15 minutes per quarter and they run until 8 p.m!  And the parking tickets are $40!"},{"name":"Pho Zen","address":"15936 SE Happy Valley Town Ctr Dr","city":"Happy Valley","stars":"3.5","text":"My favorite neighborhood restaurant.

I'm typically willing to pay $12-$14 for a good chopped salad.  But i don't care how fresh or tasty your veggies are if the service is terrible.  And the last 2x i've been there, it's been ridiculously bad.  Like \\"Am I on Punked right now?\\" bad.  Both times a friend and I ordered online (separately) and 30 min later, i went to pick up our food.  The first time i arrived and went to the \\"pick up\\" counter, but had to wait until three others (including one person who walked in after me) ordered and had their salads made.  So it took about 10 minutes of me standing there before anyone would hand me my already paid for food.  No one said \\"Hi! We'll be with you in just a sec.\\"  No one acknowledged me at all.  In addition, they forgot one item of our order.  Tonight i decided to give it another try, but the moment I walked in I knew it was gonna be the same thing--but i was wrong.  It was way worse.  There were two people waiting in line at the register to buy sodas.  I was behind them, and there were two people who walked in right after me.  There were four people making salads, but no one on the register.  Again i stood there, this time for 15 min, waiting to be helped.  None of us waiting were acknowledged.  What is the point of ordering ahead only to have to stand there and wait in line?  After 15 min, someone finally came to the register to help us.  But--they didn't make my salads yet.  In fact i was told the order(s) hadn't \\"popped up until right now\\".  So we had ordered 45 minutes ago and i still had to wait while they made my salads.  I wasn't even offered a glass of water while i waited--just a weak \\"sorry about that\\".  While my salads were being made, i chatted with the two people who were in line behind me (and now were waiting again since the register gal was making my salads and again no one was helping those in line).  One guy was dining-in with his wife, who had already gotten her food and had completely finished it, plus a glass of wine, and the dude's salad still hadn't come out.  He told the staff \\"My wife is done eating and ready to go.  Either you comp the salad and make it to-go, or I just don't want it\\".  He had been waiting over 20 min while she ate.  They declined to comp his salad, so he and his wife left.  He told me that they're never coming back, that it's \\"always like this\\".  The next lady had placed an online order and--you guessed it--the salads weren't made/the order \\"wasn't received until just now\\".  If you're going to accomodate online orders, then for the love of kale, you gotta have someone check the computer for the orders!  Other suggestions:  hire a dedicated register person and train your staff to acknowledge the customers waiting.  Oh and comp items when you mess up.  Also, i've eaten there 6 times now and have signed up for the super complicated \\"loyalty program\\"--i have received no points or credits for those 6 visits.  Why so complicated?   This place has the potential to be great if the owner accepts the feedback of her customers and makes some changes.  I'm undecided if i'll ever return.  \\n\\nUpdate:  after reading my review, the owner wrote me immediately and was very cool and used my feedback to improve their customer service.  They added a dedicated register person, and the last two times i went in, my to-go salads were ready and waiting.  My only complaint is they did also switch to smaller to-go containers, so portions are no longer huge but still pretty big.  \\n\\nFinal update:\\n\\nOk, i'm done with this place for good.  The service has greatly improved with regard to waiting for to-go orders, and it seems the crazy loyalty program has been fixed (though i still have no idea how to monitor my loyalty points, but you no longer have to tell them to add your points on your online order form).  But the salads have gotten tiny and the prices haven't changed.  Sorry, i'm not paying $13 for half a bowl of salad.  They used to use huge bowls that they filled completely, but then changed to these smaller bowls (of course prices didn't reflect the change).  But if you aren't even going to fill the bowl when my salad is 75% lettuce to begin with?  Total rip off.

In fact, if you bring in a framed photo of your dog (sorry, cat folks), your pup's face will be hung on the wall and you'll get a free appetizer! \\n\\nMy favorite thing to eat at Chuy's are the chips! The salsa is bland (they have several different salsas so keep asking for different ones until you find the right spice; we asked for \\"the hottest thing you've got\\" and it was still pretty mild) but the chips are magical! They are super light and crispy and are absolutely addictive. Come prepared to scarf down at least two baskets (they are unlimited and free). \\n\\nHubby ordered the Elvis Presley Memorial Combo, a ginormous platter of Tex-Mex favorites. As is the norm with Americanized Mexican food, everything was loaded with gooey cheese (this is not a bad thing)! I had the chicken fajitas and asked for my onions to be \\"well done,\\" and the kitchen sure did listen! My onions were so well done that they crunched like fried onions. I didn't eat them but hey, it was my own fault for ordering them that way, which I always do but the kitchens still never cook them enough. Well at Chuy's they sure do. I was super impressed with the huge bowl of fajita toppings that came alongside my meal. There was a crazy amount of shredded cheese as well as a scoop of sour cream, mediocre guacamole, lettuce and pico. \\n\\nEverything here is homemade and it's so good.

It's like those stupid food labels that tell you the calories and nutrients per serving and in tiny letters say that there is 3 servings per package. I had ordered 2 glasses in total thinking that my bill would be under $15 for both glasses. I got a bill for over $30. I was stunned. I asked the waiter and it was then that he explained that the menu goes by half glass/glass/half carafe. SERIOUSLY!! That is so stupid and it also was in milliliters. Who the hell orders in milliliters? It's not even the money that I am mad about. It's the fact that I felt intentionally deceived. And the waiter didn't even try to work it out with me since he was the one who didn't mention this messed up wine menu. So for that, I will never ever go there again. I am a wine drink and have been to restaurants and bars all over the world. Never have I seen a stupid menu like that. If you want to make money on your wine, just be up front about it like everyone else."},{"name":"The Picnic House","address":"723 SW Salmon St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Ok, we arrived to a half empty restaurant around 7pm.

Teas are international but free trade. From an ethical standpoint, I'm already in love with this place. \\n\\nThe coffee is great. Strong, but the strength is perfect for an iced coffee, which will mellow out as the ice melts. The Love Buzz is a delicious dark brew, with warm dark chocolate notes. The French Roast is decaf, but also tasty. I highly recommend a warm chocolate chip cookie to go with your coffee...they're huge and delicious. \\n\\nAs for the physical location, I get great vibes here. Upbeat music, bright lighting and colorful decorations make this a great hang out space, yet the rather secluded bar also makes for a good work spot.

The menus are at a stand right inside the door and there is no large board to have to look through.  The burger options are similar to a 5 Guys with a single and double patty and similar options for fries (you can also get Sweet Potato Fries).  \\n\\nI settled on the Black and Blue Burger (single) with small fries and a soft drink.  What I liked the most was the sauce bar with an array of ketchup (thai was my favorites), mustard and mayo flavors.  \\n\\nThe burger was good, with basic toppings and the fries were tasty. However, for a $12 price tag for lunch it was a bit steep for my taste. I can appreciate the new 'gourmet burger' options that are popping up.

The cashier was pleasant enough and processed the order with no problem, extra charge included. The food we ordered was ready in a flash, but we waited as the blue shirt clad employee (manager?) labored over our snacks (weeded? Confused?). After two minutes he placed them on the counter and I looked down to find that each cup was filled only half way. There were extra reeses, but the cup was filled with just enough vanilla soft serve that when you picked up the spoon which was placed inside the cup you just stared at the depressingly empty bottom. Typically, I tend to walk away before complaining, almost all of the time, but this was our second visit and my frozen frappe wasn't going to be a fail again! I motioned for Mr. Blue, hoping that once he saw what I was seeing he would capture the oversight and add more of the vanilla cream..but instead he replied, \\"yah, I did that so they wouldn't over flow.\\" Now I'm scratching my head, because there is at least a good five inches before that is even close to possible. Being in the industry I'm guessing the real reason is that he's almost out of soft serve and has absolutely no idea or desire on how to make it..but I just paid close to 10 bucks for half a cup in each! He sees the confusion on my face..probably because I'm trying to figure out how I lost more ice cream to have extra reeses. That's like me saying I used less vodka so I could put in more ice..huh??? Exactly. He surrenders and takes the cups back to add more soft serve, but not before he asks me to hold all three ice cream dripping spoons. Ummm forget it? \\"You sure??\\" he quips, hoping I oblige. I take the three back and get halfway to the door before I stop and think, no way forget it..I want what I paid for, just like everyone else does. I go back to the counter and call him over. \\"I'll hold the spoons, but I want the proper amount of soft serve. You can see the bottom of the cup, the ice cream doesn't touch the sides and it's only half full. For 10 dollars..I'm sorry..I can't walk away from that.\\" He takes the three back. I hold the spoons but he goes over to the sink, far away from the soft serve machine, and I swear I see him dumping some out of one cup. I stop him and ask what he's doing. \\"I'm just mixing it better.\\" You've got to be kidding me, I think. \\"Can you just add what's supposed to be there so I can leave?\\" He finally does..but just as I guessed when I get home, there's hardly any reeses in one of the cups. The fries were also old and the chicken mcnuggets tasted refried..obviously the only messege he's conveying to his staff is laziness at best. For better mcflurries, the McDonald's on the other side of rte 1, closer to Peabody, always rocks."},{"name":"Beast","address":"5425 NE 30th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I have to say, this was one of the two top meals I have ever had in my life - every course was awesome - loved that there were no choices to make, the chef made them for you and did a fabulous job!!!

And I agree, it blew me away.\\n\\nWe had the SA's Puffy tacos, Lockhart quail, Brasied Windy Hill goat shoulder, Korean BBQ flank steak, Springdale Farm Cous Cous, and Warm Brussels. SO GOOD. Obviously my friend is a big meat fan! But he let me order Brussels sprouts even though he doesn't like them, and he cleaned his plate. I was hoping for more vegetables with the cous cous, but it was pretty much all cous. Not disappointed because it was still delicious. I loved... the carnitas in the puffy tacos, everything about the Korean BBQ steak, and the tenderness of the goat shoulder. Hands down my favorite is the quail. Swift's does a good job with all the details around the main protein. I liked the cheese grits, cherry gastrique, and candied almonds much more than the quail itself! To drink, I had the champagne *complicated name*. Yes.\\n\\nParking downtown is always difficult, but we came on a Monday night so no problem there this time.

The chicken, freshly fried with a light batter, and extremely moist in the center. Fries were seasoned and had no shortage of flavor. You can even knock these back without sauce. However, the honey mustard and garlic Parmesan were winners for me.\\n\\nUltimately, the overall experience suffers due to unavoidable things like the wait times. Although the food comes out quick for the most part, we waited at least thirty minutes just to order. \\n\\nWith it being located in Florida, I wish there was more indoor seating to combat the heat.

My favorite so far is the Tofu Bun. This is good news for you vegetarians! I love the crispiness of the fried tofu and the fresh citrus flavor. I've also tried the Chicken Bun but it's not as good as Tofu. Probably because of all the hot sauce poured over it.\\n3. Apps! Our favorite shareable items are the Dumplings and the 'Fingerling' Fries! These portions are just enough for 2 people. The fries are served with house-made sauces and the Garlic Aioli is my personal favorite.\\n\\nWe have been to Little Trouble many many times and I think the service has always been good even on super busy nights.

I ordered CRAWFISH - my husband ordered fried shrimp.  Crawfish was my whole purpose for going here, let me point that out.  I asked for my crawfish to come out before my husband got his food because I usually order 3lbs with corn/potatoes and he often has to sit there for a while once he's finished his food.  Well, his food came out BEFORE I got my crawfish.  Got the crawfish, they weren't really red - hard to describe the color - I guess like a brown red.  Idk.  I tasted ONE and immediately knew it was a bad idea I ordered 3 lbs.  It was probably the worse crawfish I've tasted since I moved to Austin.  An avid crawfish lover, I know all batches can be different.  And I'll just assume, the cook wasn't as thorough because it was close to noon on a Sunday - maybe he wasn't in his element just yet.

Big mistake. \\n\\nWe finally got our order and the burger was fine. I got my usual topping on it nothing out of this world but the burger was something similar to what we make at home on a summer evening. Nothing too amazing like I have gotten from other burger joints. On top of that the bun was rather soaked even after getting it right of the line and taking a bite while there at the restaurant, disappointing to say the least.. Now the fries. Holy crap, I have never gotten so many fries in an order. I must of gotten a couple pounds worth and they were alright but man oh man greasy. I am glad to see a place actually make their own so kudos for that but I will never again order another order. \\n\\nOverall I would love to give this place more stars hearing that most people around me really like it but I think I have been spoiled by other burger joints.

The coconut strawberry rhubarb didn't please me as much. if you want Halloween in your mouth, try the Great Candicopia with homemade snickers, whoppers, reese's actual chunks. This was delicious. I also tried the candy corn and chocolate gooey brownie. Ultimately, I went with a scoop of sea salt with caramel ribbons and Cinnamon Snickerdoodle. I loved the Cinnamon Snickerdoodle the most - if I could change one thing, i'd maybe decrease the ratio of cinnamon to snickers (or increase the snickers flavor) but it was delicious.

The meat fat flavor on both was good and both were tender and served at a nice warm temperature (something that we've found is often a problem at BBQ restaurants). The problem was smoke flavor. While there is a smoker dominating the space in the small, open air kitchen, there wasn't much evidence of its use in either meat. Good BBQ will have a ping rink on the outside of the meat called the smoke ring and neither the beef or pork we got had any pink. This is often a problem I've found in  restaurants that serve BBQ. It is hard to hold meat at a good temp and maintain that core BBQ identity. Dickey's hasn't really figured that problem out. \\n\\nSides: We tried four sides in all - baked beans, mac n' cheese, baked potato casserole (just call it mash potatoes because that is what it is), and green beans. All except the mac n' cheese were decent. The mac n' cheese was awful; just one big loaf of soggy noodles hiding under way too much Velveeta cheese. My favorite was the green beans which are stewed with bacon and come in a light vinegar-based broth. Unlike, say, the baked beans at City BBQ, which I would make a meal of just by themselves, we didn't try a single side that was memorable or would bring me back.\\n\\nIntangibles: The staff was friendly, but service was very slow. We waited quite a while behind two other couples just waiting to place our order. The restaurant space is tiny and laid out in an unpleasantly awkward manner. For example, the menu board above the kitchen is curved such that you can't see a significant portion of it while you are waiting to place your order.

I've grown up on dim sum, and have had a lot of it in my life in Hong Kong, Vancouver, San Francisco, Oakland, NYC, Los Angeles, and here in Boston. This past New Year Day dim sum brunch with my family was about my 5th time here, and I think I have to say it - this ranks up there with the best dim sum joints in the world. It took me several times to get to this conclusion... it's not a proclamation to be taken lightly.\\n\\nFirst... everything is FRESH and brought to your table straight off the stove.  I have burned my tongue on something everytime I've been here... and it hurts so good!  \\n\\nSecond, this is straight up Hong Kong style dim sum. They give you menu cards on which to mark which items you want to order. I have had just about everything on the menus. You just can't go wrong. All of my usual fare - steamed pork ribs with black bean sauce, shrimp dumplings, chicken feet (they have a few kinds), beef tripe (they have  few kinds), sticky rice wrapped in lotus leaf, egg tarts, roast pork buns, and various fried goodies... it's all amazingly fresh and delicious, and comes to your table fast... the way dim sum should be!\\n\\nThe service isn't exactly the greatest, but hey Chinese food is about the food... and this is bargain, high quality food to fill you up for the day.\\n\\nBe prepared for long waits if you don't show up by 11:30 a.m. on the weekend. Also be prepared to sit at a table with other people if it's crowded... this too is HK style!  The space is small, but I wouldn't want it any other way because it allows the staff to maintain high quality. If it wasn't small like this it would be like China Pearl or Hei La Moon, and this is what I think of HLM: http://www.yelp.com/biz/hei-la-moon-boston#hrid:qfT8G8yR4oaI3fwn9aB4QA\\n\\nThank you Winsor Cafe for keepin it real - HK style!

Fries are exactly as fries should be: crisp, fresh, salty, thin. \\n\\nDessert also falls along the comfort food spectrum: the chocolate pudding, topped with whipped cream and a chocolate cookie, had a velvety-smooth mouthfeel and tons of bitter chocolate flavor.

I had the fish tacos (special on the day my wife and I went) and they were excellent.  As a main dish I had the fettuccini primavera, which were very rich and tasty and plentiful enough to be doggy-bagged for later.  My wife ordered the striped sea bass (also special of the day), which was also very good and came with a wonderful risotto.  Following the many recommendations, we shared the warm banana bread pudding for desert.  This was good, certainly a great combination with the cold ice-cream, but judging from how sweet it was, I'd rather not know the calorie count of that dish.

And what a great decision!\\n\\nThis diner is quite large inside, with charming *country* decor, and lots of booths & tables. We were seated immediately at 10:15am on a Wednesday in a roomy booth, but business was still brisk, as most tables were occupied. The host brought our drinks while we browsed the large menu.\\n\\nOur waitress was outstanding... maybe it was a prompt on their tablet app she used to place our order, but she actually asked how we wanted our hash browns: crispy or not. Of course I went with crispy. AND! Without my asking, she offered to bring me REAL butter for my grits! Maybe I don't look like a margarine kinda girl, but suggesting things I usually don't bother to ask for was awesome. And I do greatly prefer butter, over margarine or spread or whatever that fake plastic crap is called. She also brought extra napkins & a separate appropriately-sized left-over container for our sausage gravy.\\n\\nI ordered my typical omelette, their \\"Spinach & Cheese\\", choosing cheddar today. I probably could've added ham or another meat, but didn't ask. In addition to my crispy hashbrowns, biscuits with gravy (which I only get for hubs), I also added a side of grits. The omelette was one of those large but thin versions, with proportionally way more spinach & cheese than egg... and without the encumbrance of meat (as a carnivore, I can't believe I'm writing this), I actually really enjoyed this thin yet large omelette! The hashbrowns were indeed crispy on top & bottom (note: not burnt), and thoroughly cooked inside... just about perfect. And those grits... mmmm... creamy but not runny, and with a little real butter & salt, they were nearly perfect as well. Hubs got something with eggs and a lot of meats, so I had a bite of his bacon & sausage patties. The bacon was bacon - nothing memorable, but that sausage had an excellent initial flavor, followed by a sharp spicy bite. For me, that was too much; hubs loved it.\\n\\nI am so glad we made this navigational mistake & ended up here at Country Cookin Diner! Often I've settled for chain restaurants in Titusville for breakfast because of convenient locations, and I've been satisfied. But now I've found a local *chain* (3 locations in the 321) that offers an outstanding breakfast at very reasonable prices.

I would be all in favor of dedicated restaurant run by people who are, well, yogis, and deeply serious about health, wellbeing, nutrition, and sustainability. Chai understands the consumer opportunity in pretending to offer versions of such virtues -- but that's all you'll get, mood not substance.\\n\\nAnd I mean you have to be in the mood to find it groovy here, which it can be if you're willing to suspend geographic belief -- because they're a rather contrived vibe here of ethnic indulgences of the facsimile variety.  The staff looks like last year's grad class from Kits High: young, blond, and attic-room pale.  It's very vanilla, in flavor and skin tone, despite its pretensions to the mysterious Middle East.  They hit that theme a little hard, and the effect is more like a Victorian colonialist's diary than an evening in Mysore.  But that's their vibe: like or no.  This place markets itself as a distilled elixer of the Silk Road, more Aladdin's lamp than Akbar's own, and the paisley cushions and tree-trunk tables make it more appropriate to a Haight/Ashbury museum.  It's fun, if you're into it. Pretentious, if you're not.\\n\\nFood is very good:  not the cornucopia of discovered treasures of the mysterious east, as they want you to think . . . but more like \\"Fusion Cooking for Intermediate Chefs\\" kind of level.  It's tasty, with a handful of vegetarian options, but overpriced. \\nAt the end of the day, it's still basically kebabs, rice, and bread kind of basics. Vegetarians will do all right here. Vegans? Forget it. You'll have to be VERY careful. And what is beyond cloying are the cheap appeals to esoteric tantric knowledge: 'our chai is aryuvedic', I was told. Whatever that means? It has spices in it? Uh huh. Wow. I am bowing to your arcane knowledge.\\n\\nLive music is a plus: there's a top caliber sitar player here, and some passable flamenco.  Again, with the dimness of the room and the heavily perfumed ambience, it might be a fun date place. But it's not exactly cosy:  it's rather cramped and claustrophobic. \\n\\nOn a personal note which will be of relevance to some readers -- and undoubtedly a cause of nasty mirth in others -- I received very poor treatment on account of being a transgender woman.  Although staff knew my name (I was on the guest list), and it's quite obvious from my attire, my server insisted on calling me 'him', 'he', and 'sir' throughout the evening.  Some readers will find this amusing, no doubt, and I'm used to that, sadly.  But it wasn't cool.  You don't have to subtly undermine a person's humanity like that. When my really nice friend stepped in to say, \\"Erica is a 'she' \\" -- the server rolled here eyes in a mixture of disdain and disbelief.  It was extremely uncool.  It was definitely not cool. And when I first wrote a review about this incident on another site, a flame war erupted -- probably instigated by someone at said establishment -- that included me being called a 'tranny' and that people like me (ie: trans women) should pack up and leave the city.  It was in fact some of the foulest language I've ever had used against me in which my trans status was invoked as a negative: \\"It's hard to tell with you trannies,\\" I was told.   And it confirmed my suspicions: 'spirituality', as long as you can wear it or eat it.  Compassion? Virtue?  None of the Yogi's Benevolence like they make themselves out to be.  It's a shame: the food was reasonably nice enough that I would have returned. Obviously, I won't. \\n\\nI appreciate the last paragraph will be of little interest to the vast majority of readers.  But it was a degrading and dehumanizing experience that I would not wish on anyone.  There are plenty of Indian and Persian restaurants in Vancouver, with chefs who are from - you know - India or Iran.  This isn't trying to be any of those, however: it's niche positioned itself as a montage of ethnic 'encounters', and so performs as a tableaux as much as a restaurant.  Chai offers a Disney-esque kind of magic carpet ride, which will no doubt appeal to many who are too intimidated to venture outside of Kits.  A shame -- with a little more soul, and a lot less glam, it could be somewhere really intriguing."},{"name":"Clutch Prime Sausagery","address":"230 NW Lost Springs Ter, Ste 22","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"Cart now open @ SW Washington tween 10th and 11th.\\nHad a Pad Thai Chicken Sausage, great!"},{"name":"4 Rivers Smokehouse","address":"11764 University Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Probably one of the best BBQ places I've ever been to!

Double points for them because we happened to go in on an evening where all drinks and appetizers were half price. That in mind we ordered a key lime pie martini, margarita and one specialty drink for our group. They all were excellent. In addition to the drinks we also ordered their goat cheese platter, calamari and jumbo shrimp appetizers. The goat cheese platter was awesome. There were three portions of goat cheese on the platter - one roasted red pepper, a balsamic and a standard goat cheese. To accompany you had toasted pieces of baguette. I love goat cheese on it's own, so it was nice to have some delicious variations to choose from. The calamari was perfectly cooked and had a bit of spice to it which made it all the better. The shrimp had been beautifully butterflied and fried to perfection. I was very pleased with the opening portion of the meal.\\n\\nFor dinner I opted for their Chilean Sea Bass pan seared with broccolini as my side. The fish was well cooked and they seared it so the top of the fish had a nice crunch to the top but rest of the filet was flaky and tender.

I feel that the cooking here isn't really too complicated.  It's a fine assortment of great comfort food and ethnic dishes (probably more of a creative, yet casual, re-interpretation rather than a focus on authenticity).  What is amazing is that you could try dishes from so many international influences, yet it all ties together in a way that appears so seamless.  \\n\\n'House Bacon Burger' ($10).  \\n(Dish Rating, 85%)\\nhttp://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/VcI8npOTKdKN2KFS3H_HvQ?select=ADiEqegIoTF1q-nEV5kiNg\\n\\nYou get a choice between  Beecher's cheddar or smoked blue.  I opted for the cheddar, which is pretty light in flavor and almost resembled a Swiss. I ordered it medium rare, and it came out that way.  Beef patty is formed from chuck meat.  Fat distribution is wonderfully fatty, which allows for great flavor combined with the chuck.  The patty itself is a pretty reasonable size, maybe 7-8oz.  The only thing I would complain is that the shape of the patty is a tad thin, but it still works very well.  Texture is a good balance between being tender, yet still chewy.  This is a very good patty.  If I had to complain, I would say that the burger patty could be thicker.  Bacon could also be thicker and have more fat content.  Although the bun worked well and kept the patty together, it wasn't memorable.\\n\\nCondiments are very cool and well thought out.  The cheddar is melted in well, fairly light.  two slices of juicy bacon are added.  there's a moderate amount of grilled red onions.  pickles used are pretty light.  'Thousand Island' sauce, is thoughtfully offered on the side (for those who don't care for it).  It's light and resembles more of an aoili with thousand island flavor.  It isn't too sweet or filled with a lot of relish.  It works well in that it doesn't overwhelm the flavor of the patty, and you're free to apply as much as you fancy.  Everything complements the patty well.  It's a very balanced, well thought out burger. \\n\\nGrilled yams.  these are probably grilled or seared, and have a nice char.  they're served with some delicious sweet honey w hint of cumin.  the dish seems very Moroccan.  It's served pleasantly hot, and is enjoyable by itself, or as a condiment to other dishes.  it's almost  dessert-like.  The yam texture is soft, but not soggy.  Great dish.\\n\\nBaked cherries w tagglio & grilled bread.  I got the impression this was like a fancy jam, only served with hot cheese and freshly prepared cherries.  This is another awesome dish.  About the cheese, it's hot, goey & has a pungent tasty, nutty flavor.  I'm no cheese expert, but it reminds me of 'Camembert' cheese,  Instead of toast, it's served with charred rustic bread.  Excellent alternative to toast & jam.\\n \\nBreakfast Platter.  This came with savory items such as bacon, beets, chicken liver mousse.  There were also beets, strawberries, cream cheese, and more rustic bread. boiled eggs were also served.  Portions are generous.  The beets and strawberries were the best.  They tied everything together and were the most versatile element.  Bacon was a tad dry.  Chicken liver mousse wasn't gamy at all, but a bit coarse and the flavor was a bit muted.  Not bad.\\n\\nLot of their other dishes, such as the Shasuka Stew also worked pretty well.  If there was no egg added to the dish, you would have thought it was a North African dish or a Spanish tapa dish.  For some reason, Tasty & Sons' cooking works a lot better for me than the owner's somewhat similar 'Toro Bravo'.  Here, the ideas are more creative in that they bring together elements of American cooking and the brunch concept.  Flavors tend to be more balanced.  Dining environment is more comfortable and more organized.\\n\\nIf there's any complaints, I would say that it's really difficult to sample much if you're not in a large group.  Overall a killer brunch spot.  One of the reasons why Portland is possibly the best town for brunch in the US."},{"name":"Rino's Place","address":"258 Saratoga St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Calamari was excellent!

At first I thought it was somewhat entertaining, like having dinner and a show.  I placed my order (the gentleman who waited on me was very polite by the way)  and then I heard one of the two waitresses yelling, \\"well of course they sit at the bar because they're cheap!\\"  Now I understand she was probably irate because there were several people at the bar and not in the restaurant, which takes away from her tips.  And it is quite possible that she was talking about someone else and not me, but the fact that she is badmouthing any patrons in front of other customers is mindboggling.  Every single member of my family has waited tables and I work I'm a chef as well, so I realize how hard servers work for their tips.  Unfortunately this woman caused the man waiting on me to lose his at least 25% tip, because I don't care how good the food is you don't disrespect customers like that.

Not in the dinner-as-theater, blow your mind with service sorta way. Beast is uniquely Portland while managing to step up its dining game to among the highest levels in the city. It doesn't succeed on all levels, but there is absolutely nothing like it in Portland, and as such, it's worth seeking out this dining experience on your next \\"special\\" night out.\\n\\nFirst, the menu. Prix fixe with service compris, which means you pay one price of $102 (gratuity included) and get what they service you. Six courses that rotate weekly, depending on seasonal ingredients. The charcuterie plate tends to have some consistency to it, but the rest of the dishes are probably going to be different from what I ate. But the food is going to be top notch. If you're new to some of these flavors, just trust the kitchen. Everything will taste delicious, I promise.\\n\\nThe wine pairing costs $48 (so, dinner for two and wine pairings is going to run $300 out the door... and a quick side note, Beast just raised their prices. Like very, very recently. They went up in between the time we made the reservation and when we had our meal, which came as a bit of a surprise. This place is a splurge, anyway, but it was a bit of an unpleasant surprise nonetheless. However, now you know, so there you have it). They run from dry-to-sweet as you might expect as the meal goes on (very dry white at the top of the meal, very sweet \\"late harvest\\" white with a lot of residual sugar with dessert). It's about half a glass of wine with each course, so the $48 buys you three glasses total. We had five whites and a red, for what it's worth.\\n\\nNow onto the \\"communal dining experience.\\" There are other restaurants, like Clyde Common, that have communal tables, but I have never been to a restaurant that orchestrates the meal in such a way where everyone eats at the same time. The biggest advantage this has is that service is going to be consistent across the board. It's very hard to be inattentive when everyone is doing the exact same thing at the same time. So it's kind of a fail safe service system built into the experience. The meal will take about three hours, because it is a dining experience, after all. \\n\\nI do think, however, that the communal aspect of Beast takes away from the  \\"capital E\\" Experience because it removes intimacy from the evening. This is obviously a personal preference (but what isn't?), but if I'm paying $150 per person, I'm not really all that interested in sharing my special evening with the couple sitting next to me.\\n\\nIf you're out on a date, make sure you sit next to each other, not across. The tables are too wide to sit across from your dining partner, and you'll end up shouting your conversation across the table. And the chairs are not comfortable. For a three-hour meal, their furniture choices are very strange.\\n\\nThe vibe of the place is way more Portland chic than it is fancy dining. Open kitchen, chalkboard walls, think Toro Bravo or Clyde Common. It's a bit of a mish-mash of dining messages, because the meal is so expensive. \\n\\nSo, you might take to these details more than I did. You might find the vibe charming. You may meet some fun new people on sitting across from you. There is a near certain chance that your food will be delicious.\\n\\nWhat it comes down to, however, is this:  They go out of their way to stand out from the crowd and they succeed in that regard. There is no restaurant in Portland quite like Beast."},{"name":"Pastaria","address":"59 Spruce St","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"Love their ravioli and sauce. The price is worth the flavor.

I ordered one of their Chicken Fajita Cabana Bowls and a Chips and Queso. I took my ticket with my order number and sat down.\\n\\nThe informal dining area was crowded and noisy. Most Taco Cabanas do get very loud inside, but this particular customer sitting across the room facing me had a voice that could split boulders.

I arrived around 11:30 right before the lunch crowd and it was well worth the early visit because it got very busy at noon. I ordered the brisket platter with fried yuca and plantains. The yuca were large wedges and crispy on the outside soft on the inside. The plantains are coated with a raw type of brown sugar so they get sweet and crunchy on the outside and soft in the middle. The brisket was tender and you don't need much to break it apart. They don't smother it in salt like 4 River's does on their brisket. The balance of smoke is perfect. The garlic sauce for the yuca is really good. The sweet BBQ sauce is great for breaking up the smoke flavor of the meats. I really dislike smoke houses which put their sauce in the smokers. It's really dumb to double up on the smoke. You must have contrast between the meats and the other items on the plate. If you don't break things up you might as well just give people a gas mask and then connect it right to your smoker and then let them eat. The only thing they are going to taste is smoke. Yech!\\n\\nParking is limited so arrive early or later if that is your thing.\\n\\n(additional info)\\nI went back this evening with the family as my wife killed me when she learned I went with out her. We arrived around 5ish and found parking. We also arrived on time to avoid the crowd because at 6:00pm the place was slammed with a line wrapping around the building. This visit I ordered the chicken and brisket and my wife got the brisket.  The difference was the mixed veggies and the apple slaw. Both of which were really good. I preferred the slaw over the veggies because, again contrast, the veggies were grilled and had a flavor similar to the meat.\\n\\n(notice to the head chef or owner)\\nI'd like to see some consistency with the portions. When I had lunch the yuca was too much and I didn't have enough garlic sauce to finish it. When I arrived for dinner the next day my wife had twice as much sauce as me and I had less yuca than I had at lunch the day before. My wife also noticed that 75% of her mixed veggies were snow peas and green beans. We found ONE broccoli and a few carrots with no bok choy. Also the $1 extra for the small Chimichurri is DEFINITELY NOT WORTH THE EFFORT.

I'd say a fourth of my burger had to go uneaten because the lentils/quinoa bits were too scatted to get with a fork. \\n\\nIf I order something and my allergen requirement means not serving one of the sides or such a basic thing as bread for my burger, the server really should ask if thats okay.

It was good, possibly overcooked a tad but not too much, nice grill flavor and the pesto was delicious! My favorite part of the dish. Potatoes were thick but good, and it was nice to have a large mound of lightly dressed greens to offset the potatoes.\\n\\nFor dessert I had to try the bourbon bread pudding. It was good, not great-I'm not sure I tasted bourbon at all. The bread seemed to be basic white bread though, so I can't rave about it, just pleasant.\\n\\nSo, overall a good dining experience (if pricey), I go from 3 to 4 stars because of the oysters, as I mentioned.

So I ask if I can add on gorgonzola and they say yes but then go back and forth on whether it is actually on the salad or just in the dressing.  The 2 ladies up there at the counter were not sure.\\n\\nWhen I get the salad there was not traditional crumbled gorgonzola on it- I figured out after starting to eat it, that it is gorgonzola shavings on top.  Before I had realized that I had asked the waitress for a side of gorgonzola and she agreed to bring it.  She was also thinking that there was not gorgonzola on it by looking (no one seems to be trained on the menu very well here).  She promises to bring it back right away, but about 10 min later passes the table and says, don't worry she hasn't forgotten she is going to bring it ASAP.  I was hungry so I just started to eat the salad, and quickly figured out the shavings were gorgonzola.  She came back another 10-15 min later when I was almost finished with the salad and actually says, I know I'm the worst right now, but here is the side of gorgonzola.  \\n\\nGood news is, the salad itself: EXCELLENT!  I had added chicken to it which was delicious.  The gorgonzola shavings were actually good, I had been looking for crumbled gorgonzola, but this was a fine substitute in the end.\\n\\nOther items tried:\\nAvocado toast: shared it with my friend to start, which was good, definitely have had tastier avocado toast, but I liked it\\n\\nPumpkin muffin: really really good, had some melted icing on top, great sweet treat at the end.\\n\\n\\nSo, in short, I would return here again with little expectation for knowledge and service from the staff, but knowing I will get a great salad in the end."},{"name":"Tasty n Sons","address":"3808 N Williams Ave, Ste C, Hub Building","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Overrated, overpriced, mediocre Portland foodie haven.

I generally don't mind a bit of a wait, as it is usually a sign of good things to come but the server/hostess was guilty of a gross underestimation of our expected wait time...20 minutes turned into an appalling 50 minute wait outside on a particularly cold evening. With a party of 4, a party of 6, and a couple deuces ahead of us on the list in an already packed restaurant, I had a feeling that 20 minutes was unrealistically optimistic, but I ignored my better judgement, succumbing to tempting thoughts of tasty latin street food. \\n\\nThey suggested waiting on the heated patio where we could enjoy some pre-meal drinks but the server took 10 minutes to come out to take our orders and another 10 minutes to bring them out. After a painful 40 minutes outside, we were offered free popcorn, which were sadly on the extreme side of saltiness and offered little comfort during our uncomfortable wait. \\n\\nWhen we were finally seated...surprise - more waiting. Food arrived at odd, uneven times. My sister could barely suppress her disdain, and literally sneered at the food when it came (it was THAT laughable!) The portions were TINY! One of us had long finished her two morsels (tacos $6.50) by the time the rest of the table was served. My Carne Guisada Arepa $7.50 was slightly larger - a whopping palm-sized gargantuan of a dish (yes, that was sarcasm you detected). It was a bit bland, as if after all the spices they seemed to have forgotten the salt O.o Looking at the spread upon us (ehem, or lack thereof), our stomachs grumbled in protest. Tempted to order more, we passed knowing we'd have to burn a mighty hole in our pockets to feel remotely satiated. I think we all went home and rummaged through our fridges. \\n\\nThe atmosphere was lively but the music was just much too loud. I think I strained my voice trying to include the rest of my party in on the conversation I was having with the person next to me, to no avail. I definitely do not recommend this place if you're a party of more than 2 people and you actually want to hear one another - yes, I'm still yelling! \\n\\nOn a positive note, the wings ($13) were quite tasty albeit much too spicy for the rest of my group. They were crispy, piping hot, and doused in a sticky sweet, spicy, and savoury sauce - just the way I like it. It most definitely had a kick!  I think seeing the unhappy faces at our table, the server kindly brought us a chimichurri aioli (usually $1) on the house, which complimented the wings very well. \\n\\nThe only other redeeming quality was our server, who tried very hard to lift our spirits. She was friendly and cheerful but we never did see quite enough of her. It's apparent to me that there just weren't enough servers to give any table the proper attention and service. It's a wonder why people still come here. Seriously, she was great, but you know service is lacking when you're constantly craning your neck like a damn ostrich trying to catch a server's eye. Despite the freebies, our meal was an epic failure.\\n\\nGo get your latin fix somewhere else. La Taqueria's got much better tacos for the price, at $9.50 for 4, you can bet you'll get you're money's worth and won't walk away starved and feeling ripped off.

When the food came out we dug right in not even noticing that it looked as though our food had been thrown on someone else's dirty used dish. There were traces of nachos, queso, tomatoes and lettuce and we didn't order anything close to that.

It's no wonder that Chef Naomi Pomery made it as far as she did on Top Chef Masters.  Was anyone else watching that show?\\nAnd honestly, from a restaurant/cook's perspective, this is the way to do it!  They only have 2 seatings a night, it's a fixed menu and everyone is served at the same time.  It's like being at a dinner party at someone's house.  Talk about an easy night on the line!  Everyone was so relaxed and happy...just havin' a good ol' time singing along to the music, makin' some food.  No pressure to get the orders out, nothing to confuse or screw up.  It was awesome!  I want a restaurant like that!\\nEach course was set up on the huge island that took up half of the 'dining' room (which also contained the kitchen, dish pit and most everything else).   Like this:\\n \\nThe rest of the space was very cool and casual, too.  A couple of the walls are full chalkboard on which they have written a bunch of meat-loving sayings.  Things like, \\"If we aren't supposed to eat animals, then why are they made out of MEAT?\\"  Haha!  Hilarious!\\n\\nBut when the food started to arrive, it was clear that these women were NOT messing around.  It was all thoughtful and complex yet balanced.\\nOur first course was \\"Black Cod & English Pea Chowder with Fresh Dug Fingerling Potatoes and Cherry Smoked Bacon.\\"  Not that you can tell from the picture, but it was so many things:  creamy, smokey, fresh & deep.  Every once in a while you'd get a pop from some fresh herb or earthy oil.  I wish I could clearly communicate how truly delicious this seemingly simple chowder really was.  I guess you're just going to have to trust me on this one.\\n \\nThe charcuterie plate, too, was simple yet intricate.  I mean, you may look at this an see a bunch of tiny little bites but upon closer inspection, you'll notice that each little bite has some serious components.  Like the \\"Foie Gras Bon-Bon,\\" for example (which you can see at 12 o'clock).  Not only did they make that delicious, silky-smooth, rich, fatty mousse but they also made the shortbread that it sits on and the sweet sauternes gelee that pops with a sprinkle of sea salt.  Talk about decadence!  I wanted to fall on the floor, it was so good.  Or get up and dance... one of the two.\\n\\nThere was also a chicken liver mousse TDF (To Die For, really) with a pickled shallot and lard cracker, the brilliantly colored, house-cured Sockeye Salmon, spicy artisanal salumi and lightly tangy steak tartar with quail egg.  To counter the fatty richness of the plate was the classic mustard and cornichon along with the not-so-classic (in fact, unheard of) pickled green strawberry and red chard stem.  Interesting, huh?  Are you, like me, wondering just who in the hell thinks of these things?  Someone much more creative than I.  And in the center, to clear your palate between each complex, flavorful bite was a fresh, lightly lemony salad of shaved fennel bulb, herbs and micro greens with dainty, orange edible flowers for color.  It's so gorgeous that I made it my desktop wallpaper  .\\n \\nThe duck was fab, too, with its crispy skin and moist, pull-apart meat.  My fave, however was the asparagus, herb & cherry tomato salsa.  It was such a nice accompaniment to the rich duck&veal demi.  I also loved the slow cooked zucchini with green garlic that was soft and melty but not mushy and just salty enough.  Mmmmm....\\n\\nEven the simplest of green salads was spot on.  The \\"gathering together of early summer greens\\" was fresh and perfect, heightened by the light citrus vinaigrette and deepened by the finely shaved parmesan.\\n \\nA cheese course followed with something creamy, something nutty and a blue.  The honey and poached apricot were definitely yummy but even better was the cardamom shortbread and the most glorious Marcona almonds I've ever tasted in my life.  Why were those things so good?  Oh yeah, they were fried and salted.  Good thing I don't have those in my pantry.... I don't think I could control myself!\\n \\nLast, but certainly not least, came another summer specialty:  strawberry mousse.  The fruit's full flavor came at you singing in this creamy, soft pillow of summer love.  There to accompany it were its brighter, bolder friends... the macerated strawberries and a few tangy, unadulterated golden raspberries, just to give the palate something else to consider.  The loose Champagne gelee was no stretch in regards to flavor combos and I'm not totaly sure that I loved its texture.  But the buttery, caramel-y, black pepper tuille, on the other hand, lent some contrasting crunch and depth.  I hear that opposites attract.  I'll go with that... especially on this plate.\\n \\n*Full review with pics on the blog."},{"name":"La Moreliana","address":"1909 E William Cannon Dr","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"i have come here a few time to the food shack at the rear of the store. the food is delicious and never disappoints.  serving sizes are good for the price you pay.."},{"name":"Easy Tiger","address":"709 E 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Great hidden Austin spot nestled away off of dirty 6th street. \\n\\nBakery upstairs, beer garden below.

When they delivered the reuben, there were two sandwiches. They said that the gluten free roles they had that day were on the smaller side so they made two sandwiches instead of just one. Totally surprised us. The sandwiches were also piled high with fresh tasting corned beef.\\n\\nTo finish off lunch, we split a gluten free cookie. They have someone local that makes all their baked goods. The gf cookie was quite good and had both cinnamon and chocolate chips in it.\\n\\nBesides delicious food, the service was prompt.

Let's just say you find yourself STARVING. And it's almost midnight, and you're in Allston. What's there to eat? Well, there's McDonald's, but we all know that's a crap place. There's Kelly's, but that place is over-hyped and over-priced. There's Bravo- yuck. (my opinion- don't hate, don't hate!) There's Azama Grill (100 thumbs up), but maybe you're not in the mood for Egyptian yumness. Oh wait,  wow, there's this newish place on Brighton near the non-existant anymore Zaps (tears!) that's serving cheap eats now! And then you go in. That's the type of place Pizza Days is for. just that. Going in late at night. I give it a convenience star on behalf of my hungry Allstonian neighbors.\\n\\nI know this because my husband and I went in around 9 for dinner, really wanting to EAT. Wrong time to go at a place like this. Wrong time.I should have been hungover at 1 am in order to step foot in this place! Oh well! \\n\\nAnyway. \\n\\nThe decor is cozy. It's basically a cafe/pizza place in one. So it's not grimy and gross. So that's the second star there. And that's where the stars end. The owner/workers are friendly. For NOW! I've been betrayed before, so I'm not holding them to their friendly persona for long! :)\\n\\nPizzas are smaller than most places. A small/personal is 10'', a medium is 12'' a large is 14\\". Whatever, no big deal, it's nice to have small food sizes for once in this country. \\n\\nWe just ordered a simple pepperoni pizza (medium, in case you're dyyyying to know). And it was not good.\\n\\nThe dough was undercooked. The cheese was so greasy it practically disintegrated. The pepperoni was so crunchy it was practically deep fried bacon. Grease didn't over my plate  after eating a slice, though, at least, but it was still like eating a greaseball. I DO like grease on my pizza (I'm not lame! Pizza has grease! duh! but it's not supposed to disintegrate into the disgusting runny dough!) Maybe it was a bad night. Maybe. But it is enough to make my nose scrunch up at the thought of going back. It doesn't mean I WON'T go back, just that I'd rather eat fries at Kelly's and that's saying a LOT for what I think of as the quality of the food. \\n\\nAnd we didn't get one of those amazing-sounding tubs of garlic butter a la Papa John's, as the previous reviewer revealed! Not fair! I feel quite ripped off now. \\n\\nI WILLLLL say though that their cafe options seem interesting. I like what they say they serve for breakfast and perhaps their cafe sandwiches might be yummy. So maaaaaybe I'll unscrunch my nose to try something for breakfast, and it's satisfactory, I'll give their sandwiches a try. But definitely not their pizza! I am curious about their breadsticks. Are they real sticks, or is it flat dough that's cooked and then sliced (those are NOT breadsticks!). I'm so curious, but I'm afraid of the disappointment! I don't want runny doughy flat bread slices. If anybody tries it and likes it please message me! haha! \\n\\nAnd they have coke products!!!!! Yes they do! Huzzah!

This place has a great laid back vibe that is a bit country and a bit hipster.  Located a bit outside of Austin this large ranch style brewery is beautiful and transportive.  The indoor tasting room or the outdoor bar are serving some of the best beers in Austin and therefore the world.   All of this is in a fun down home atmosphere of picnic tables and dusty green Texas Hill Country vistas.  Bring friends, bring the kids, throw a party, meet new people, Jester King has so much going for it.  \\n\\nNo matter how great the vibe none of this works without the beer.  The beer menu is as thoughtful as an organic farm to table restaurant and the ingredients are just as unique.  From the Piglet with the smoked figs from Franklin or the Buddha's Brew which is blended with Kombucha each beer is unique among the brewery lineup and unique among beers in general.  I was happy that they offered up the 4 oz cups at $2-$3 which gave me a chance to enjoy so many of them.  They also have free hourly brewery tours, \\"how long are the brewery tours?\\", \\"about a half hour, it depends who is leading the tour and the people who are on the tour\\".  Yes, that is about as laid back of an answer as you can get.  If you are hungry, they offer fresh made from scratch pizzas.  With the care that they put into the pizza it seems like it should be amazing but it's only good.  However, it is perfect after a few beers.

The buns weren't overdone, just crisp enough to stand up to the sandwich - and you guessed it - they also came with some nice, cool slaw on top of the meat and sauce. YUM! \\n\\nThe sweet-potato potato-salad is delicious and very simple - nice and chilled and fresh tasting. \\n\\nThe Brunswick Stew...my friends, this is a MUST HAVE. Get a big serving of it and take it home for dinner, even if you have it as a lunch side. It's just that good. I cannot describe how delicious it is, but I can promise you that you won't be disappointed with a serving of it. Not sure?

The girl ordered a Bloody Mary (who doesn't like a good bloody Mary?).  She said it tasted pretty basic and was nothing to write home about (she's always on the lookout for the best Bloody Mary).  What annoyed us was the banter behind the bar.  The bartender (completely aloof of our presence apparently) started to loudly talk about how \\"Bloody Mary's are a sign of a true alcoholic\\" and proceeded to drone on about how it's a lame drink, only used to cure hangovers, only old ladies order them, they're a pain in the ass to make, etc.  I will admit the look on his face when the server took the drink 5 feet and dropped it off was a bit priceless....or maybe I just enjoyed making eye contact then raising my first beer, with the second sitting on the table and saying \\"To Alcoholics!\\".

We had to ask numerous times for water refills, it took forever to get our check, and there was a line of people at the door waiting to be seated with NO ONE there to greet them for nearly 10 minutes! One couple left, the others stuck it out, but didn't look happy. Not a good thing for a new place downtown...\\n\\nSo needless to say, the tip we left wasn't great due to the service. I'd probably eat there again although it wouldn't be my first choice. I would likely go back to get a grab n' go lunch or rent a picnic basket though. The food was good enough that if I didn't have to deal with the service issues and could just take it to go I'd be more likely to do it. :)"},{"name":"China Hut","address":"16721 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"2","text":"China Hut has really good House Special Fried rice and bbq pork is delicious!

If I could, I'd give them 3.5.  The decor is nice and trendy.  I like the feel of it and it's pretty cool that they have a guacamole bar.  We've been there a few times and thought the food was pretty good.  I had the pork, which was excellent, and the steak on a different occasion, also good.  So, why three stars?  Well, I think this place is having a bit of an identity crisis.  The last time we were there was on a Friday night (around 8:30 pm).  For some bizarre reason, the place was full of screaming children - some sort of birthday party.  And it wasn't just the party - it seemed like every other table had children seated there, throwing their food over the edge of the table and tugging at their mothers for their sippy cups.  We even encountered a parentless two year old girl wandering around, trying to run up the stairs.  Don't worry, I directed her back to her parents.  My mother would have died of embarrassment - but to each his own.  Now, I don't have anything against children, of course!  However, if you must bring your children with you to a place like this, after 8 pm on a Friday, then you should be respectful of those of us that didn't bring the kids along.  Children should not be seated at or anywhere near a taquilla bar.  Ever.  I thought that was just common sense.  And I don't particularly feel like sitting in the kids section while enjoying my $8 margarita on a Friday night.  It sorta felt like we took an extended journey to an overpriced Friday's.  That's just not cool.  Put the parents with children in one section, away from the bar.  That way, they can enjoy their meals and not feel bad about disturbing the others."},{"name":"Saltyard","address":"1820 Peachtree St NW, Ste 1","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"So first the positives (which are the only thing keeping this from being a one star review): the space is very pleasant and I liked the patio. Prices were also very reasonable.\\n\\nNegatives - lord the food. Everything was very bleh and uninspired. \\n\\nWe started with Oysters which were literally so dirty on the outside that every time I touched one, my hands turned black. Not very appetizing. They were also not well cleaned when opened, so there was shell in 2 of 6 that I ate. The mignonette was overpowering and not very good. Would definitely skip these if I ever came back (which I won't).  \\n\\nNext we got the burrata, which was fine, but overpoweringly sweet. Could also have used something crunchy somewhere on the plate. (and who wants fine?)\\n\\nAlso got the smoked salmon. First, the salmon they served was a greyish pink and not even of the quality you can pick up at publix. It was served with a smear of dill infused cheese, tiny oily potato disks (not the crunch potatoes advertised on the menu), and like 12 pickles. The pickles added nothing to the dish, didn't go with the flavors, and totally overwhelmed the subtle flavoring of the other items. Odd dish. Don't recommend.\\n\\nAfter being underwhelmed, we figured we'd try one dish other people had recommended: the shrooms on toast. Generally, the flavors were really good. there just wasn't much in the way of toast! It was served in a bowl with a gravy basically over a piece of wonderbread. Such mushy white bread was totally overpowered by the gravy, so while the flavors were alright, there were more questionable culinary choices being made. \\n\\nOverall, you can do so much better in Atlanta.

On a very busy Sunday at 10 to 1  ( which is important to note because at 2 p.m. you can no longer order from anything but the happy hour menu, so the clock was literally ticking)  we put our name in with the hostess and were told it was a 20 to 30 minute wait and had several people ahead of us, but things looked good as it appeared several tables were ready to vacate. And they did. The trouble was, you give the hostess your phone # and when your name is up, if you're not in the restaurant but say, outside or next door having a drink, they call you or whomever is up next, on the phone. This wastes a LOT of time.. This would probably not cause delays or be an issue IF the restaurant management in it's remarkable stupidity, did not also have the hostess bussing tables, re-setting them, greeting people and taking their names, answering the phone, all while trying to CALL people on the phone and seat people ALL AT THE SAME TIME. Un- f***ing-believable. How this plays out as that as the clock contnues winding down to 2, there were at one point 12 seats open, but the hostess could not seat them ( or us)  because she was trying to do five jobs at one time. The seats we were finally taken to which were 5 feet from us - it was like a mirage of a desert oasis when you're thirsty that you can't touch -  had been open for 15 minutes. 15 minutes they sat there empty ( all 12 for that matter)  - before she could people into their seats and  get us to the oasis at the bar. If the owner had been there to see this and had any business sense, he would have seen money hemorrhaging out the door since he could have turned 12 more covers at the full price regular menu if he had an efficient enough system to get asses in those seats, maybe more. Ridiculous. God I'm still pissed just thinking about it.\\n\\n   The good news. The GREAT news - the food  and drinks !!!!!  Their specialty cocktails are delicious - I had something with champagne and bitters and bourbon that sounds godawful but which was refreshing, delicious and beautiful in color - a great start. The Burmese stew was ungodly good with a perfectly balanced sweet and spicy, robustly flavored pork and pork fat that melts in your mouth served over sticky rice and topped with a nearly perfect sunny side up egg. I'm salivating now thinking about it. The Reuben was also sensational - crispy and smoky and rich ( my one criticism is that is is so intense in flavor it really needs a side of crisp slaw in addition to the Russian dressing that come with it,  to help cleanse your palate in between bites and cut the intensity  - I just couldn't finish it for it's overpowering flavors). The chocolate potato doughnut in creme anglaise was delicious but the panna cotta with grappa soaked berries was the star, and possibly the best panna cotta I've ever had. Perfectly silky - the exact texture and body you want from a panna cotta ( though it's traditionally served unmoulded and this was served in a ramekin sort of   like a pot de creme, oh but who cares - now I'm just nit picking). It was fabulous-  all of it. \\n   I thought I was going to hate Portland. The food here made me love it. We'll be visiting again to try some of the other restaurants we weren't able to get to this trip, and I will definitely subject myself to their hostess stand hell  if that's what it takes to get a bowl of that stew again, but god I hope the owner doesn't make that particular torture the price of every admission because it really is painful and frankly stupid.

No biggie, but odd. My husband ordered another drink while paying the bar tab. \\n\\nOur friends came; we sat down. The food was all perfectly decent and some was memorable.

Then our mains came while two of us were only two thirds of the way through our appetizers. A bit more annoying. Then several different waiters tried to clear my main while I was clearly still eating (were they trying to speed us along because a big party had booked the private room?). \\n\\nOther small points- I asked the waiter what Amari the bar had. I knew they had some since my earlier cocktail included Cynar. He had no idea what I meant and suggested I might like a strawberry cream and Baileys (?).

I'll start with the great things...(yelp only allows so many words, so I can't elaborate on all the dishes).\\n\\nBeast is a tiny, cozy space located in a fun neighborhood on North East Killingsworth with the experienced, renowned and  beautiful Chef, Miss Naomi Pomeroy. Chef Naomi has been featured in multiple magazines, received the James Beard award and the food she uses is fresh (not always local to Oregon, but kept to the west coast) \\n\\nBeast sits in Portland's *east side* where you'll find hip interesting folks that are down to earth. The restaurant is next door to the Japanese restaurant Yakuza, across the street from Expatriate (Asian fusion) and there's a super cool vintage store around the corner called Red Fox vintage. Inside, Beast is very clean, elegantly simple and stylish with two pretty and rustic solid wood communal tables that fit well with Portland's Pacific Northwest outdoorsy vibe. Because it's small, one table fits a party of 8, the larger fits a party of 14, and you must make reservations. The open kitchen is really a bonus to experience, and allows patrons to see their food being prepared up close (be sure you request to sit at the north side of the large table to get this view). Chef Naomi is not always present, therefore someone else may be making your food, fyi. The ambiance is nice - it really is a perfect relaxed setting without being too dark. \\n\\nThe menu at Beast is $110 for 6 courses, pre-fix and changes weekly. Be sure and check their website to know what you'll be eating. Descriptions of the selections always sound  a bit exotic and complex, and while the choices of ingredients may indeed be interesting, actually tasting them together  is underwhelming, especially when compared to other recognized and well known spots to fill your belly in Portland. Beast will accommodate those who are gluten free, but beware you may simply get a smaller entree, instead of an ample substitution or it will be something much less complex. I think Beast could collaborate with Cascadia, as an example,  to offer a gluten free baguette with butter before the first course, since everyone else at the table is eating delicious gluten-full baguette while the gluten free folks just have to sit their and stare at them, with an empty stomach. Servers most of the time did a fine job of describing to us what we were eating, but forgot to do so a couple of times. When I politely tried to snag their attention (always kindly and with a smile), I could see their high stress and felt they were inconvenienced by my inquiry. Both of our servers did seem to be rushed and about on edge, even though they were very polite all in all. I think at an establishment labeled as having a unique experience, could benefit from ensuring their servers have a good work life balance and are treated in such a way that makes them more relaxed with patrons. This is not something I believe the servers should be chastised or scolded for, but rather a remedy should start with management. \\n\\nOur dinner was the below: \\nVARNISH CLAMS\\nBABY LEEKS, FINGERLING POTATOES\\nSMOKED CABBAGE, TARRAGON & CHILI\\n\\n*Tasted very good. The broth had flavors of the cabbage and nice pieces of it (detected no smoke) a slight hint of the tarragon, wine and butter. I did not notice the chili. The potatoes were fine - nothing different than I can make at home. The clams tasted very fresh (I grew up on the Oregon coast eating them all the time, so I'm confident in this). There was no *fishy* flavor. I did bite into a bit of sand at one point, but it's next to impossible to Never have this happen. I received quite a bit of clam broth in my bowl, but for some reason my date had almost none, so I shared mine with him and he was happy to have it with his bread. It appeared they accidentally gave me all of  his. \\n\\nGORGONZOLA DOLCE CAPPELLETTI\\nWALNUT BROWN BUTTER & BELGIAN ENDIVE VERNACCIA-PICKLED FIG, CHERVIL\\n\\n**I am gluten free (not celiac), so I did taste a tiny bite of my dates dish, which was good but only because of the browned butter. Butter makes anything taste good, however, the butter is really the only big flavor I noticed, and my date said the same. He mentioned \\"it's ok, but I feel like it's something I can do at home.\\" Note neither of us are gourmet chefs.

Coordinated with their catering head, Sarah.  Between her, the waitresses and servers, it was a phenomenal experience.  The cocktails were unique, the food was delicious and plentiful, and the service was great.\\n\\nWe were a large group and I don't think anyone was ever lacking for attention, drink or food.  I wish I took pictures, but let me share what I can from memory and the menu:\\n\\n1st course: Shishitos, Cornbread & Melon.  Nice combination of sweet & spicy.  Just enough food to get us going on our tour de force.\\n\\n2nd course: Roasted beets, Grilled Cauliflower, Tomato Farm Salad.  Again, a great combination. The Cauliflower was not too raw or overcooked and had just the right amount of spice.  The beets were complimented with a combination of salt, yogurt and a dressing that really made it great.  And the Farm salad had a really nice cheese component to it as well.\\n\\n3rd course: Shrimp Boil, Bass, Goat Shoulder, Grilled Tofu.  The last item was off-menu as we had vegetarians in our group - we asked them to do something for them and they pulled together a really nice tofu dish that was just as good as the others and not treated as an 'aside' - in fact, they made enough for the whole table.  Good way to judge the quality here - different folks in our group had different faves.  I loved the Goat, my wife to my left loved the Shrimp and my buddy to the right loved the Bass.\\n\\n4th course: Dessert! - Popcorn & a movie, Commander Crunch, Funfetti Tres Leches.  I have a bad sweet tooth and I love chocolate, so I assumed the Crunch would be my favorite.  I liked it a lot, but the Funfetti ended up being my favorite.  Popcorn was ok - little salty for my taste, but others liked it.\\n\\nCocktails - unique offerings where they infuse an 'iceball' with the mixture of flavors/spices/mixers, and then pour the liquor on top.  Makes for a very strong cocktail to start, then once the ice melts a little bit, feels just right.  But don't wait too long, otherwise the big ice ball fully melts and dilutes the drink too much!\\n\\nPrice - Just an amazing meal for $50pp.  And with the cocktails, tax, and tip it came to $85pp.  We had folks in from NY, Boston, Philly, LA, and SF.  All of them considered it a true steal.\\n\\nIf you're going to be doing a group dinner in Austin, call Sarah and get it done."},{"name":"Thundercloud Subs","address":"2300 Lohmans Spur","city":"Lakeway","stars":"4","text":"The staff were friendly and helpful.

A friend of mine is subletting a place in Cambridge from a native Brazilian, and Muqueca's menu was the only Brazilian food menu in his apartment - we thought for sure we were headed to the right place. \\n\\nFirst - we made a reservation after hearing the stories of the long waits. No need really, they made us wait 30 minutes to be seated anyway. We showed up 5 minutes before our reservation time just to be safe. It's a tight space, so there's really nowhere to wait but to stand hovering over other people. Not so fun - especially for me since I'm 8 months pregnant. \\n\\nWe then make it to our table. It takes 15 minutes for someone to take our order. At this point, we're starving - 45 minutes after our reservation time we FINALLY get to order. Maybe they sat is in some in-between table and no one was sure who was in charge of taking our order...\\n\\nWe had long decided on the two dishes we wanted to split. One shows up before the other - we actually thought they did this on purpose because they understood we wanted to split the meal. Nope - they just never put in our order for the fried fish. After we finished eating that first dish, someone tried to take away our silverware. We tried to explain to her that we had another dish coming. Blank stare. My friend speaks great Portuguese and so then proceeded to tell the woman that we had in fact also ordered a fried fish dish. The woman then went to the counter and placed our order. At least we only had to wait 10 minutes for that to come out. \\n\\nThe food really wasn't anything to write home about. Maybe it was our menu choices (though my friend spent time in Bahia and picked things off the menu that she thought were representative of good Bahia food), or maybe Muqueca is just so well-loved because it's a unique offering of Brazilian food (every other place in the area seems to go quite a bit heavier on the meat options). \\n\\nTo make up for the order mix-up, a couple of chocolates for dessert were given to us \\"on the house.\\" A kind gesture, but the order mix-up was not as big a problem as making a quite obviously pregnant woman stand for 30 minutes when she had made a reservation and there were open tables. \\n\\nI'm not going back and I actually discourage my friends who have asked me about it.\\n\\nFood won't make you sick - but you might find a better way to spend ~$15 for dinner."},{"name":"Swagat Indian Cuisine","address":"4325 SW 109th Ave","city":"Beaverton","stars":"3.5","text":"TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE! barely acknowledged us and didn't even respond when we asked her for stuff. ive never left a restaurant so angry before. i went there with a group of 9, BEFORE WE ORDERED we specifically asked our server to make sure to split up the bill, she said that we could only use 5 credit cards so we said ok as long as each person knows what they owe, she comes back with a bill that was just a total, then we asked her to tell us how much we each owe. she said she cant so we split it ourselves and then gave it to her specifying the amount to be charged, she comes back charging 1 person almost the whole amount AFTER MORE THAN 30 MINUTES OF WAITING! i've eaten at so many restaurants this just didnt make any sense"},{"name":"Shoal Creek Saloon","address":"909 N Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Rarely, do I go somewhere in this town and experience a place with great food and bad service.

The pretzel with mustard was a good alternative to the typical late night taco or pizza associated with drinking. The jerky was also awesome, and our server was able to explain how it was made. Reasonably priced as well.\\n\\nBeer/drinks: Good selection of beers, but about a third of what we asked for was out. With 7 people and 7 different tastes, it was pretty disappointing. I'm hoping that just has to do with it being their first week in business. I would have liked to see more local beers as well, perhaps something they're working on. \\n\\nAtmosphere: I loved the aesthetic, I thought it was classy and casual. There aren't many (any?) other places on \\"Dirty 6th\\" that you can have a conversation without shouting, getting bumped into, and having to listen to loud music. Also not any that have good group seating. The outside was great, but it was a chilly Texas night for once and without space heaters it was pretty unbearable. I'll attribute this to the first week of being open as well.\\n\\nService: Pretty good. We sat down, were talked to within 5 minutes, and she knew everything about the beer and bar.

The chicken was served in lightly marinated, medium sized chunks.  The pesto was extremely tasty.  The arugula was crisp and fresh.  Blend it all together with cheese, and you get a superb combination.   Overall, the crepe had the right amount and ratio of ingredients.  My pancake was soft and just browned enough on the outside.  I got a fork and knife, but the crepe held together well enough to be eaten without utensils.\\n\\nVerdict: I can't speak for the regular menu, but my special crepe was excellent.

After purchasing a groupon (which isn't a good deal because of the high prices set), my mother and I decided to come here for lunch. This Korean BBQ restaurant replaced the Golden Dragon and it has the same exact tacky decor (dolphins painted on the wall, oceans, very island like). \\n\\nFirst thing we noticed was how this restaurant is owned and run by Chinese workers. It isn't that big of a deal, but that was already a sign that it is probably not authentic Korean food. After looking through the menu, my mother was quite confused how come they didn't have bulbogi (a thinly sliced beef that's marinated) which is a staple at every Korean BBQ restaurant. I ordered the Sirloin steak and my mother ordered the Skirt Steak. \\n\\nWARNING: This restaurant puts parchment paper on the grill!!! This totally defeats the purpose of Korean BBQ and it leaves the meat \\"grilling\\" in it's own fat. There is no grilled taste or char and it was just completely odd. Also, they use an electric grill. Authentic Korean BBQ has a grill plate over a flame, so this was just disappointing. \\n\\nWith the 2 entrees we ordered, we received the banchan (side dishes), miso soup, and salad with dressing. According to my mother she said the miso soup was very bland, however I thought it was just decent. Nothing special but it wasn't bad. The salad in my mom's opinion was the best part of the meal because of the dressing. I am not a fan of salad, so I can't weigh in my opinion here. The banchan was a bit disappointing considering the size and the amount you get. The kimchi was okay, the broccoli was very little, and the cucumbers were just sad to look at. Overall, not terrible so far. \\n\\nOn to the main dish, the meat! One positive I do have to say is that the meat is very well marinated. You can taste the marinade quite well. Despite this though, I am not sure if the quality of the meat was terrible or the fact that the parchment paper made it taste like rubber. The Sirloin Steak was chewy (I did not over cook it, in fact I like my steak a bit on the rare side) and very rubbery in texture. The skirt steak had a more pleasing texture, however, because of the parchment paper, it was just odd to eat. If I had to compare it to something, it tastes exactly like boiled steak except you dunked it in some beef blood and a little marinade. It was just completely odd. You do get some rice, zucchini, mushrooms, romaine lettuce (for wraps), and 3 pieces of shrimp on the side. To be completely honest, zucchini was the best part of the whole meal. Shrimp took forever to cook because of the parchment paper and at the end of the whole meal, the whole grill was basically a nestle of all the fat and drippings of the meat.

These prime brunch menu items made up an exceptional meal.\\n\\nThe chocolate potato doughnuts were sweet, sugary and doughy, and came with a cream dipping sauce that complemented the doughnuts nicely. \\n\\nThe Shakshuka was extremely hearty and flavorful. My fianc√© and I saw it pop up on a number of \\"Best Brunches in Portland\\" roundups, so we were very excited to give it a try. Add the lamb sausage to perfectly round off this dish. The mix of spices, tomato and bread made this stew-like dish very appetizing.\\n\\nFinally, the Steak n Cheddar Eggs. It took a while for this and the Shakshuka to come out because they're both baked to order. Despite this, the combo of steak medallions, cheddar eggs and cornmeal cake went together PERFECTLY. I especially loved the cornmeal cake with scallions baked in, and the honey jalape√±o butter that comes with this dish.

I am a bit torn writing this review though.  On the one hand, the food here is simply incredible.  The prices, although high for the neighborhood, are completely justified and not at all out of line for the quantity, and quality you receive.  I don't think I have gotten anything there that has been less than delicious with my favorite being the mushroom ravioli app, lobster ravioli entree and stuffed eggplant.  Also, there is a \\"regular\\" menu which I assume is what most neighborhood people, who go there regularly and not just for a treat, order from.  The prices are much lower and the fare is more standard.  I'm sure though that the food quality is the same.\\n\\nThe service is also above average.  I have gotten the same smart-mouthed, old school waitress three times and she is great.  She makes you feel really welcome in a truly Boston way.\\n\\nMy only complaint is with the rediculous hostess.  It is impossible to get a straight answer from her.  Their policies are ever changing (without notice)and she lacks any ability to estimate wait times.  To make it worse, there is no waiting area, bar or even a bar nearby.  It has been an issue every time I have gone and she has caused me not to even try to go at least 3 times.\\n\\nLast time I went with my wife we called at 5 and were told it was only a 30 minute wait.  When we got there, 15 minutes later, she told us the wait was an hour and a half with 6 parties on the list ahead of us.  I said 'it was only 30 minutes when we called 15 minutes ago' to which she replied, yeah, thats the way it is.  The place is tiny so as I walked out I looked at each table and could tell that something like 5 of the 12 tables were in various stages of eating their meals and 2 others had their checks.  I got outside and told my wife I thought 20 - 25 was more accurate.  20 minutes later we were seated.\\n\\nLast week I wanted to go with a business group and, although their website says they do take reservations for 6 ppl or more, she told us they didn't anymore and to call ahead.  Then when we called ahead on our way out the door, she told us they don't do call ahead and the wait was 1.5 hours.  She said next time we should make a reservation and I told her she already told us they didn't take them to which she replied \\"well, we are full with reservations for the month.\\"  Mind you this was mid way through August.  Needless to say, we didn't go.\\n\\nAfter doing some figuring (always dangerous), I think the deal is that they may over-state the wait on purpose to drive away tourists and keep spots open for the neighborhood people.  I know this is counter intuitive, but this is not exactly in a neighborhood your average tourist would wander thourh on their way to go shopping.  It is in the middle of a residential area near the airport.  2 years from now, when no one is talking about DDD anymore, this place will still have to pay the bills by servind their local following.  I get that.  I just wish I could get a straight answer... and that I knew the secret password."},{"name":"Maurizios","address":"364 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Remember the short movie \\"The Red Balloon\\"?  A red balloon faithfully followed a young boy.  Well, there was a painting at Maurizio's that reminded me of the film.  It was probably for sale if you are interested, as Maurizio's offers the opportunity for local artists to show their works on their red walls.\\n\\nAs Maurizio's is a Sardinian restaurant, I gravitated towards the dishes labeled as such.  We ended up sharing two appetizers and two entrees since the desserts, while likely freshly made, aren't made on the premises.\\n\\nMAZZAMURRU $9\\nClassic Sardinian peasant dish made with toasted bread, chicken broth and tomato sauce, topped with a poached egg and pecorino cheese and baked\\n\\nINVOLTINI DI MELANZANE $9.50\\nRolled slices of eggplant stuffed with ricotta cheese, basil, sun dried tomatoes and parmesan cheese, topped with tomato sauce\\n\\nLINGUINE NERE AL SALMONE $23\\nHomemade fresh black linguine with fresh and smoked salmon, diced plum tomatoes, scallions and fresh basil in a lobster tomato cream sauce\\n\\nSALMONE RIPIENO $24\\nPan roasted stuffed salmon filet with crab meat, lobster meat and ricotta cheese, over saffron risotto in a lobster brand cream sauce\\n\\nIn each category, there was an obvious winner.\\n\\nThe Mazzamurru was both interesting and tasty.  The mouthful of warm juiced up bread was surprisingly good, although I though the egg looked more fried than poached.  The eggplant was tasty, but had that unfortunate unpleasant taste that eggplants sometimes have, but is usually hidden by the frying of the eggplant.  Perhaps this version wasn't fried?\\n\\nThe baking of the Salmone Ripieno caused the outside of the fish to be a bit dry.  The stuffing was plentiful but I would have preferred the shellfish chunkier so that I could differentiate between the two better.  Both were worth ordering, but I found myself continually picking at the Linguine Nere al Salmone with its moister chunks of salmon and the saucy al dente black pasta strands.\\n\\nEven the bread course was good.  The slices of cool soft bread was addictive dipped in the olive oil - I quickly consumed my two slices!\\n\\nTwo individual unmarked bathrooms are located down the metal spiral staircase, where there was also a whole other larger room of dining space!

I visited the Manchester Arms based on its proximity and positive reviews.  We (I, my 3 twenty-somethings and elderly mother) , sat an outdoor table. When the sun dipped below our umbrella, we set about rearranging the heavy furniture. Rather than being annoyed, the waitstaff assisted us as did other patrons (love Georgia).  Our server was sharp and attentive, as were the back-up wait staff.  We gave them every opportunity to be annoyed with us (not ready to order, changing minds, water with less ice, water with lemon, etc.) but they remained unruffled and friendly.  The beer was cold, the food was very good.\\n\\nBut here's what separates the men from the boys: Two days later my mother couldn't find her wallet and was convinced that she had left it at the restaurant, so I called the restaurant to inquire. The manager, Anna Katherine Robinson, checked to see if it had been turned in (it hadn't), and was very concerned. Even though I told Ms. Robinson that I doubted very seriously that the wallet had been left there-  my mother is mostly blind, very absent minded, and it could be in her house right under her nose and she wouldn't know it- she didn't just drop it at that, as many busy managers would.  She promised to call me if it were found.  Well, the wallet was found at her home as I expected, but to my surprise I got a call at home in Seattle from Ms. Robinson several days later just checking to see if the wallet had turned up.

I was taken to this \\"amazing\\" place for lunch and went away thinking \\"whaaa?\\"  Let's start off with the good:  the food's decent.  Not superb, not fantastic, but pretty good.  Another good point, if you like an egg on top of everything you eat, is that there's an egg on top of every freakin' dish.  The possible exception might be the bacon-wrapped dates, but I'm not sure an egg wasn't harmed in the making of that flick too.  The something-or-other stew I got was, as before stated, pretty good... but how do so many people rave about a place that gives you big chunks of fat along with (in place of) the meat?  One huge chunk was just fat.  Oooh, that's what makes it tasty, my co-worker said.  No, that's what makes it cheap.  We shared 4 dishes, so I didn't just get the wrong thing.  The burger was pretty good, but not the best in town by far and not even in the top 10.  And what the hell is with this disturbing trend of community seating?

The kids had some grilled chicken with rice and beans and fries which were clearly not frozen and microwaved as other places do.  We were lucky to find a parking spot on the street right next to the restaurant, which was a huge plus, as I would say parking is the biggest negative of this place.  The restaurant is nice, clean but nothing fancy.  The only negative aspect from our visit (but not enough to cost the review a star) was that we asked to have a baby food container heated for our 15 month old daughter (who was not quite ready for black bean stew) and were told they couldn't do it for \\"liability reasons\\".

But whatever, it's in the same city...barely. \\n\\nJester King is located way out in practically unincorporated land. I cannot believe that it is still considered Austin this far out from the city, not Dripping Springs. If you make the trek out to Jester King, I highly recommend NOT driving your convertible as you will need to go offroading to get to the brewery. My little Z4 was put through quite the test making it over the driveway - thankfully no flats (doesn't come with a spare).\\n\\nOnce you park, you'll probably be amazed at how large the facility appears to be. There is a huge covered patio area where you can chill out and play cornhole, drink beer, and eat delicious pizza. In addition, there is the restaurant, Stanley's Farmhouse Pizza, the brewery (which is actually very small) and the coolship/barrel aging room. All of this on probably 5 acres of gorgeous Texas hill country land.\\n\\nYou can take a tour of Jester King which is approximately 30 minutes long. After you get finished, you'll feel as though you received a Ph.D in brewing because of the sheer amount of knowledge that the owners have (yes, one of the owners led the tour). It was insane the amount these guys know about beer. The amount of work that they put into crafting amazing beer made me feel less bad about purchasing a $16 bottle of beer while I was at J-King.\\n\\nThey have a great system for tasting the beers. You can buy a 4oz or 8oz glass of any beer of your pick. They range in price from $3 to $8 depending on size and beer selected. \\n\\nAs for the beer, I'm a huge fan, but consider yourself warned, these beers are not for the faint of heart. You must enjoy weird beers. You must enjoy sour beers. You must enjoy funky beers. Otherwise, you're going to hate their beers. Jester King doesn't brew your typical ales, lagers, stouts and ambers. They focus on Belgian style ales that use a lot of weird ingredients (wild yeast strains, raspberries, etc). The end result is amazing and inventive beer; there is a reason why they win so many awards, but the beer is not for everyone.\\n\\nOne last note, at Stanley's Farmhouse Pizza you can buy your more standard beers, so this occasion can be enjoyable for most. They also have Sake from a local Sake company.

Guy Fieri has visited this authentic Italian eatery on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives so i just had to go.  Apparently Rino's restaurant is no joke because there was a two and a half hour wait!  No thank you; after walking my butt off through sweltering hot Boston all day, I was not about to stand on the street side and sweat some more.  The only logical solution?  Take-out.  We ordered the famous lobster ravioli, a ground sausage, pea and mushroom ricotta tortellini and wild mushroom and sage ravioli.  My cousin, living above an authentic Italian restaurant, was not so sure Rino's deserved all the hype.  Then again, she is not a lobster fanatic.  Truth be told, the other pastas were mediocre but the super-stuffed and delicious sauced lobster ravioli was seriously stunning.  It is the dish Guy drooled over and it's no wonder why. \\n   It would've been lovely to have be so \\"lucky\\" to get a table here.  The hosts and servers were not very friendly and seemed to care less about their guests (at least those receiving take-out).  But again, that lobster ravioli was truly in a league of its own.  If I lived in Boston and didn't mind driving, I'd give these rude folks my business any day of the week for that dish."},{"name":"Salt & Straw","address":"2035 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"My boyfriend and I found Salt &Straw wandering around last night trying to find an open place that wasn't a bar.

I finally had the privilege to indulge at this amazing ice creamery called Salt & Straw here in Portland, Oregon this week and Wow! And again I say Wow! Michele R. Yelped Salt & Straw back in November of 2013 \\"which I bookmarked\\" and have looked for the opportunity to pop in to experience this highly celebrated and acclaimed ice cream institution. Starting a few years ago with a food cart on Northeast Alberta Street, Salt & Straw opened its first shop on Northwest 23rd Avenue, then its second shop on Alberta with a total now of three shops and a cart in Lake Oswego. Very Cool! Why acclaimed did you ask? Because over 39 top magazines from Oprah, Wall Street Journal, Living, GQ, and Sunset to name a few, have interviewed, written and photographed the cousins and co-owners Kim and Tyler Malek for their incredible creations and combinations from collaborations with Portland celebrity chefs using local, seasonal, fresh ingredients. Love this place! You know what is also cool? Salt & Straw was one of five nominated for \\"Best Restaurant Bathroom Award in 2011\\" and I know you're thinking -what? Kim and Tyler bought a postcard collection at an estate sale of a Portland, Oregon resident named Ms. Ada who collected postcards from her friends that traveled from around the world.  Her story is framed in the bathroom of the Northeast Alberta Street ice creamery with the postcards made into wallpaper. Amazing! I'll let you have the privilege of reading it for yourself, including the wallpaper postcards on the walls. How fun!\\n\\nWell, let's talk ice cream! I had a couple of Salt & Straw's ice cream wonders like Lavender, Coffee & Bourbon, while my colleague had the Pear with Blue Cheese which he said was fantastic. I can't wait to go through all the flavors and as I mentioned above, a lot of Portland's celebrity chefs have worked with Salt & Straw to blend some unique flavors for different events, and restaurants such as OX and Bamboo Sushi.  I can't wait to see what Kim and Tyler do next. Thank you Salt & Straw for the great memories and being a great part of my culinary community."},{"name":"Early Harvest Diner","address":"25 Broadway St","city":"Wakefield","stars":"4","text":"Awesome food and even better service!

A co-worker told me that they had a Yollar deal ($20 worth of pizza for $10) out for them, so I took this as my opportunity to try the pizza that's supposed to be out of this world.  \\n\\nWe ordered a large pizza with tomatoes, black olives, and roasted garlic.

I then re-read the reviews and realized this was their spicy sauce that most everyone raved about.  I didn't get it.

It is not cozy. The music is at the far end, away from the street. No one stops talking, so if it's not a big band it's probably going to be inaudible. The music is hard to hear, but the conversation isn't. So if you are looking for somewhere to converse without talking quite loudly, this is not the place for you. If there is a musical act - which there always is - they won't seat you at an individual table anywhere in the restaurant if you don't want full dinner service - in that case you get to sit at one of the long communal tables. So if you have anything to talk about that you mind strangers listening to, and you don't want the full dinner experience, or even one of your party doesn't, then this is not the place for you. This policy is despite the fact that many of the tables are nowhere near the music stage. The bar staff are serving drinks that some of them don't know how to make correctly. For example, Tequila Sunrise is meant to have a sunrise effect through how it is built in layers, but this was missing in mine.  Old Fashioned is served without a garnish. I would also counsel any young bartender that their personal life is less likely than more to be of interest to a mature patron; although I understand there are exceptions. On the positive side the staff are friendly and effective and doing their best to make the format work. In particular I found the female maitre'd to be quite engaging. The food is good, although someone I talked to mentioned that the French onion soup with ribs was strangely sweet.  All-in-all, Beat is not the place for  me. However, if, as many people do, you like to immerse yourself cheek-by-jowl and elbow-to-elbow in a hip and happening, noisy crowd, with good food and a hint of live music in the background, you will feel quite at home."},{"name":"Whiskey Dicks","address":"50 E Central Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"I can't recall anything about this place so i'll just give it 3 stars. lol I've must been drinking way too much when i got here."},{"name":"Celery City Craft","address":"114 S Palmetto Ave","city":"Sanford","stars":"4.5","text":"Little gem right here in downtown Sanford.

As soon as I took my fork to take a price off the end the meat was so tender that the slightest flick allowed the rest of the meat to fall off the bone. The meat was so tender and juicy I could not believe it, each bite had the perfect amount of flavor that will blow you away. I was hesitant to order the yuca frita with the rice and beans but I can tell you I will order that every time. My family is from the Dominican Republic and I can be very picky when it comes to Spanish food but I can tell you The yuca frita was so crisp and fresh and the beans accented the rice perfectly. My girlfriend ordered the \\"Big Floyd\\" I was only able to have a taste of it but in that one taste I knew I had to come back and order that. Originally the plan was for me and my girlfriend to share our food she would have half my ribs and I would have half hers but our orders were so good that we could not share our food with one another lol. The service was amazing and very welcoming! I would definitely recommend this place and will be going back very soon."},{"name":"Ironside Grill","address":"25 Park St","city":"Charlestown","stars":"3","text":"I would like to say that this place at least hit the spot.

Their website honestly says it all, as soon as you look them up you read: \\"Pasta Da Pulcinella strives to maintain a comfortable, cozy venue with cuisine that is unmatched in quality and care. This small, independent, quintessentially Italian restaurant embraces a unique clientele \\". This couldnt be closer to the truth. The service here was by far the best I experienced in Atlanta so far and I have been traveling here since February for work every Monday - Thursday. I also am Sicilian so I believe I know Italian food very well and for me to get excited about an Italian restaurant is for sure a rarity. The waiter gave great wine recommendations and was eager to provide his advice on food options. The offer gluten free pasta which is great for a small place and focus on local fresh produce/meat. I was with a coworker; she had the gluten free pasta with grilled chicken and mixed vegetables (so good!) and I had the tagliatelle verdi all bolognese. Soooo good! I think the make or break of any Italian restaurant is #1 how they make their gnocchi and #2 if they can make an amazing meat sauce! This is a must try. I am absolutely going to be coming back here again and would recommend this restaurant to anyone in in the area as as neighborhood gem and a must go to even though it is off the usual midtown strip, you will not be let down!"},{"name":"Q2 China Bistro","address":"472 Polaris Pkwy","city":"Westerville","stars":"4","text":"Very good food.

It was cold, had very little lobster flavor, and the cream sauce tasted like thick milk. A bowl of cereal wouldve been more appetizing. On my second visit I had the calamari again and the chicken cannelloni (spelling?) which was much better than the lobster ravioli. It had half mushroom cream sauce and half some type of tomato sauce. The tomato portion of the sauce was the most flavorful. The mushroom cream sauce was a few steps better than the lobster ravioli. I gave 3 starts because the food was decent on my second visit, but everything seems to be suffering from a lack of salt and seasoning. My boyfriend had the ravioli de mele (spelling?) which was very good! The ravioli was stuffed with sausage and apple with nice bold flavors. We also had a bottle of wine which was great. The prices are fair so I cannot say I spent so much on a disappointing dinner. Overall, I was not very impressed but I may come back to try other things because this place seems to be hit or miss.

My biggest complaint about most fried chicken establishments is that while the breading and texture is there, the meat will still lack flavor. Breasts are probably the most difficult to enjoy because of this.  Hops chicken had no problem solving this. Every bite was juicy, every bite had flavor and I wasn't left wanting at the end. I'm usually not crazy about bread or rolls with my chicken but their buttermilk rolls were a pleasant surprise and almost had a yeast roll-ish taste to give it a slightly sweet aroma. \\n\\nTo wash it down I had their sweet tea with a splash of their lemonade.

We got lucky and scored one of the last tables upon walking in without a reservation. I noticed they were featured on Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives; I'm not really sure what category Rino's falls into, because while simple inside it doesn't scream diner or dive (and certainly not drive-in).\\n\\nWe opted for two items off of the specials menu - lobster ravioli and frutti di mare. Overall, the specials menu is more appealing than the regular one. In hindsight, we should have seen if half orders were possible, skipped all bread and salad, and fasted before dinner. \\n\\nOur plates were enormous! The frutti di mare came in what I would consider a salad bowl (as in the kind you make a salad in, not the size you eat from). Of the two dishes, we loved the ravioli - finishing it off - and only liked the frutti di mare.\\n\\nIf I recall the ravioli was $24 and the frutti di mare $28, which were very good values. The ravioli, served in a pink sauce, was stuffed with chunks of lobster and had more lobster over the top of the dish. It was rich, but not overly so, and delicious. Coming from the midwest, where lobster ravioli is expensive and disappointingly sparse on lobster, this was a real treat. The frutti di mare was teeming with seafood, which was my favorite part. The only problem (a good one to have) is that there was so much seafood, it was almost impossible to eat the pasta with the seafood - it was buried under a mountain of mussels, clams, scallops and shrimp.\\n\\nBottom line: 4.5 stars.

Let me start off by saying I know it was a Friday night and pizza is probably a popular delivery choice for crowds but this experience brings home the gold for the absolute worst Pizza Hut around. I placed my order at 10:16 pm. I ordered two large pizzas, some breadsticks, a Hershey cookie thing, and a two liter. Pretty standard order. There was nothing special... besides the staff and pizza.\\n\\nWhen ordering they gave me an estimated deliver of an hour and a half. No big deal I thought. I'm hosting some new friends over for the first time at my new place and thought we would be ok for a couple hours. Well a couple hours went by and now my friends are starting to get really hungry and contemplating leaving. I'm despair I called the store to try and find out what was going on. After about 10 minutes on hold finally got someone to pick up who wanted to know \\"what did I want\\". Umm rude. But whatever. I informed them that I placed my order a while ago and just asked how long it would take. Honestly was just trying to get an estimate. I was told that the driver just left with an order and my order was next and that when the driver gets back he has to take another order first and then he'll take my order...... yeah. Doesn't make sense but whatever. I took it for what it was and said thank you. I begged my friends not to leave without dinner because I really wanted to be a great host.\\n\\nSo they waited. They waited for another you and a half. And then left WITHOUT the pizza.  Needless to  say the pizza showed up after 1. And what came was one pizza, the cookie, and the soda. I told him I ordered two. He denied that I had two. Went back to his car and literally just found it. Then I asked about the. Breadsticks and he returned to his vehicle to search for it. But to my chagrin none were found. He just said he didn't have any. Expecting him to make some effort to make it right, none was made. No refund for it, nothing.\\n\\nWhatever, it was crazy late. I hadn't eaten and I just paid $50 for a couple pizzas. I went to my apartment to dig in. Nothing like a late night pizza. Umm I would rather have eaten cat litter. The pizzas were obviously sitting in there for a while. Cold. The crust was hard. The cheese hadn't sort of congealed to confirm that it was cheap cheese but usually it's fine when it still hot because it kind of strings. This cheese was just like rubbery over cooked octopus that has to be washed down with liquid. At least rubbery octopus would have slid. This just kind of stuck to my throat. Whatever. The pizza sucked. Thought at least I'll have the soft cookie. Yeah. Thought wrong. It was like a rock. I literally bent a metal spoon trying to break into the damn thing. Not even dipping it in milk would soften that synthetic moon rock that Pizza Hut tried to pass off as a cookie. \\n\\nI literally LOVE Pizza Hut. Like it's my go to. Always has been. I seriously need to reconsider. I feel heartbroken about this and that makes me sad. Don't ever order from here. EVER.

He even had a sense of playfulness that really put me at ease. Who said service cannot be relaxed casual yet very welcoming. I was drawn to order everything he recommended.

I welcome that after this sandwich was wrapped it sat on the grill for a short period to crisp up, which made it easier to pick up and eat. It wasn't crumbling all over the place. The flavors and spices were profound and spoke volumes of this ancient recipe. Hummus was creamy and spicy.\\n\\nCombo #3 - Beef Shawarma, tabouli, hummus and salad platter. Tabouli was fresh and bright, the flavors literally bounced of the plate. Beef was a little crisp and got a crisper as time passed. But flavors were spot on. Hummus was creamy and spicy.\\n\\nMango Nectar - It's just a mango drink, right? Wrong! This little thirst quencher is made in Mexico from an Egyptian company and represents the Middle East very well. The creamy sweetness is pronounced in each sip.

So, I was very excited to see they offered tofu scramble for brunch! That is, until I tasted it...\\n\\nSeriously, what is this? It was doused in (what I think is) spicy bbq sauce and soooo soggy! They clearly did not press the tofu at all or even let the water steam off when cooking.  It was literally sitting in a puddle of diluted bbq sauce, which then the english muffin sat in and got gross. Plus the scramble was cold in some sections.\\n\\nOn top of the terrible tofu scramble, it was incredibly loud and made louder by having live music.  I'm all for music with brunch, but they were playing so loudly that people had to scream to be heard.  That's not what I want to be doing on a Sunday morning.\\n\\nIt gets one star for good lemonade and another star because my fiance enjoyed his biscuits with mushroom gravy.\\n\\nI'm going to come back for just drinks, because they do look good, but I'll probably never come back for food unless they change their menu.

I'm a big fan of both spicy and sour flavours, which they hit perfectly. My mouth waters just thinking about it. The tacos, however, were a little disappointing. The tortillas were decent, and the sauce for the pastor was great, but the pork itself was bland and a bit dry considering it was covered in sauce. The rajas were my big disappointment because I had read a great review for them, but they just didn't stack up. I think it was because there wasn't enough cheese on this particular one, which I think is the big draw. I'd like to give it another chance, though. \\n\\nAs for service, it was... fine. I was told by one waitress to sit where ever I'd like, but then waited for a menu from her, only to have another waitress ask if I've been helped or not. Nevertheless, the service was still good after that, and my waitress was very nice. \\n\\nI did take photos, but cannot for the life of me figure out how to post them here.

It's a little out of the way but definitely worth the drive. Our first visit was in November while our last one was in September. I sure did like the cooler weather in November since you are basically outside in a farmhouse setting with little place to escape the heat. Either way, the atmosphere is great with a very peaceful landscape despite the bevy of activity from discerning craft beer drinkers to families with kids playing around. \\n\\nThere is a separate building that offers pizza and salads which is not affiliated with the brewery, but mainly the wife and I are here for the beer. We lucked out on the first visit as they were releasing some funky sour beers, so that was cool. No such luck on the second go around, however we were able to take the free brewery tour. It was very informative and we got to learn about Jester King's unique approach to beer making. I only wish that they made more beer and therefore they would able to distribute it more.

Nothing was bad, but nothing was outstanding either.  All of us agreed that the food fell short of expectations.  The Shrooms on Toast was probably the best thing we had, but it was a paltry portion, especially for $9.  The prices were our other knock against Salt Yard.  I'm all for tapas and sharing and small plates.  But these are REALLY small plates with pretty hefty price tags for what you get.  We ordered 1 'biggie small' (the duck) and I think 6 small plates (for 3 people) and I was still hungry but had already run up a tab of $30 each.\\n\\nI'd go back for just having a drink.

The restaurant provides some old seats rescued from a Fenway Park renovation for this purpose. While novel, they're terrible to sit on, probably because they were ripped from their original foundations with a sledgehammer (and still bear the marks). Ambiance is great, with a selection of kitschy artwork on the walls. Menu is fairly traditional diner fare with a few quirky dishes thrown in. We weren't in a very experimentative mood. \\n\\nI had the Roughrider Omelette, which was advertised as having homemade corned beef hash. I was psyched, since homemade hash is hard to find. It was hard to find in this omelette, too. There were maybe a couple of ounces of well-hidden meat amid a mostly-potato filling. Dana had an omelette made of apples and Vermont cheddar cheese. It sounded delicious but didn't taste all that remarkable. I would have expected more cheese for $11. The breakfast potatoes were also unremarkable. My english muffin was grilled, which is a nice touch. \\n\\nI didn't find the prices to be as outrageous as other people are saying. I just didn't see much reason to return to Zaftig's.

It wasn't a negative experience. Order was correct and delivered on time.\\n\\nPizza: a little bland and undercooked for my taste. Crust was decent, cheese was good, sauce lacked flavor in my opinion. I think they were a little stingy on the pepperonis personally. But it's rare that a place will actually load up on the toppings. I think were I to order again, I'd ask for the pizza to be cooked well-done for more crunch and less of a spongey feel. Maybe double pepperonis to add more flavor. Not bad, just okay.\\n\\nHam & cheese sub: it came exactly how I ordered it: lettuce, tomato, onion, pickles, black pepper & oil. Vegetables were all fresh and good. Not my favorite ham, but I'll chalk that up to a \\"personal taste\\" thing? And the bread was soft and fresh and tasted fine, but PERSONALLY I thought it was a lacking. Kinda cheap maybe? It's probably a weird thing to criticize but it was just whatever, where as I know other places where I'm like \\"this bread is amazing\\", they just do not happen to deliver to me. Also, I felt like there could've been a bit more ham and cheese in the sub. And I'm someone who usually pulls half the meat out and gives it to the dog, I like a good bread to meat ratio.

Portions are decent to large, some of the other dishes around the room looked massive, but I found that I wasn't bloated after my entree, and wasn't still starving.\\n\\nFor dessert I did the bread pudding.  It's a massive serving even for a fattie such as I, and it was oh so good.

So our experiences may have made us all a bit extra happy/punchy etc.\\n\\nThat said, this was a perfect hangout for a late dinner and drink. The margaritas were some of the best I've had at a restaurant. They were a bit pricy but actually had alcohol and did not taste like a cheap mix. The rest of the table got strawberry margaritas which I never order anyway. They always taste like frozen mixes. These did not. I went with Hornitos and it was probably the best I've had other than at home (when we are buying pretty expensive tequila).\\n\\nThe food all tasted fresh and had wonderful flavor. The best were the chips and salsa. Our friendly waiter kept bringing out more chips (probably because me and my sister in law were ordering more margaritas even if the rest of us stopped).\\n\\nI ordered the taco salad. The shell was a touch dry and chewy but I wasn't hungry enough to finish it anyway. The actual salad was good enough that I was happy even without the booze... I think :p\\n\\nOverall I was very happy and would definitely be back if I were a local."},{"name":"407 Cafe","address":"9161 Narcoossee Rd, Ste 108","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Have now been here twice and have not been disappointed with either visit.

The pork was seasoned so well and was so tasty and tender. There were salted eggs in the stew as well as a fried egg on top. The flavors were extremely well balanced and it was just a top notch dish.\\n\\nI also had the Dutch Baby, with lemon curd and raspberry jam. The Dutch Baby is similar to a pancake but instead of cooking it on a pan, it is baked on a skillet. This provided a delicious and sweet end to my breakfast. \\n\\nI also must mention the service! My server was extremely knowledgeable and helpful in regards to the menu. There were a lot of options and he was able to provide the sizes of each dish as well as his own recommendations.

Service was very efficient and when the food came out, it was piping hot (so be careful!!).

The aioli that comes with it is to die for, I wished they gave us a side of it too! \\n\\nSkakusha - tomato stew with egg and bread. I thought it was pretty average, not too much of a tomato person but it was better than I expected. Tomatoes were actually very good and I love the bread and egg mixture! \\n\\nCorn Meal Pancake with Steak - probably my favorite dish out of all. It was my first time with cornmeal and it was surprisingly very tasty - the corn meal was soft and near gooey but almost like a cookie consistency. It paired very well with the eggs and steak, which to my surprise was VERY good!!! Cooked perfectly to medium rare, it was seasoned well and definitely was easy to cut through, not chewy at all. \\n\\nOverall, I thoroughly enjoyed the classy vibes that came with the farm-to table food experience I had here.

The duck wings were nothing special and kind of dry. The squid fries weren't anything special. When I went, they had a banh mi dish with foie gras and pork belly. I was slightly annoyed when it came out with pate instead of foie gras. Yes I know pate is made of foie gras, but if you put foie gras on your menu, I expect a hunk of foie gras. To give pate instead of actual foie gras disrespects the intelligence of your customers. Seriously not cool, and it wasn't even very good. While this review may sound like I was severely disappointed, what really brought the meal up was dessert.

My boyfriend expressed similar sentiments. The free chips and salsa were fine. I got the baja fish taco plate, which only had 2 tacos. It cost $13, so not a good deal. Granted, I'm picky and asked for everything on the side so that the tacos came with just the fish and sauce, but the portions of fish were really small compared to the other places I visit (those places give you 3 tacos with more fish for less than $10... But this isn't VA). My bf got a chicken taco plate, which seemed to have a lot more protein. But he said they were only okay.\\n\\nService was meh. I checked the outside menu before coming in and saw that there were different options than the menus given to us. I asked the waitress about it and she was confused, so I just told her what i wanted from the outside menu. She came back about 5 minutes later still confused about my order, so I showed her what I saw outside. Took her a minute before she told me that was the lunch menu. It would've been helpful if there was some indication of that on the menu that's posted, since there's a disclaimer on the brunch menu. Anyway, I told her to just give me the dinner portion. About 10 minutes later she comes back and asks my bf what he ordered, it seems as though she completely forgot.

For a few reasons. It's definitely not because of the food.\\nI truly believe that this restaurant has the potential to be a solid 4.5 - 5 star restaurant -*even in foodie Austin*- with just a bit of customer-focused tweaking. \\n\\nAs of right now, it's 3.5. Maybe.\\n\\nThe food itself is fantastic. Each time we come we find something new that's delicious and exciting. The flavours are bold, well thought-out, and beautifully executed. Surprisingly, the vegetable dishes are some of the greatest things on the menu... But all the food is terrific. Hats off to the chefs. You are superb. The concept of the restaurant, with its family-style dishes, is perfect. The decor is trendy and hipster- but so is Austin. It's pleasant. \\n\\nSo what's missing? \\nA few things that really crawled under my skin, and made me feel a little taken advantage of for a$150.00+ meal (for 2).\\n\\n#1: The ice ball cocktails. Folks- they're a gimmick. And not even the fun/good kind. The \\"concept\\" is that all of the cocktail's non-alcoholic ingredients are frozen into a ball of ice that will melt into your drink to infuse it. Then they tell you that the ball is good for 2 cocktails... WHICH MEANS: buy a second shot of the alcohol. \\nAll that meant for me was, I was left to sip straight vodka and prosecco while I waited for my \\"Strawberry Fields\\" ice-ball  to melt. It wasn't terribly good, and in order to make it better I was forced to sit there chipping away at the ball instead of enjoying conversation with my husband. If you want a pre-dinner drink, this is not the thing. I much preferred the wine with my meal. \\n The Manhattan ice-ball is truly subpar. They should focus on making a good, straight-up Manhattan instead of conceptualizing it.\\n The wine list is interesting. But they do serve the wine in the incorrect glasses. My pinot noir was poured into a white wine glass. (I fully admit this is wine-snobbery... But if you're only going to have one wine-glass size, it should be larger to better let it aerate.) \\n\\n#2: Our dinner reservation was for 7:45, and they had already sold-out of their signature/best-known/best-loved dish. (Pork cheeks) \\nWe had ordered it, and our server had to rush back to inform us that they had run out.\\n\\n#3: The Korean Beef. The good, the bad & the ugly: Okay Texas. Beef is your thing. The dish is delicious. The flank steak was cooked perfectly in the middle, but there were 5 small slices of beef, and two were the outside, over-cooked ends. This is one of your more expensive dishes. Those pieces should not have been served, or there should have been more beef. Most of the dish is rice cake, and while the rice cake is *fabulous*, I do feel taken advantage of, *again*, paying $25 for this small-plate. The mark-up is astronomical. \\nPlus, our neighbours had a fried-egg on their beef- we weren't offered this, and we would have happily taken the upgrade. We dig our fried-egg toppers. \\n\\n#4: The execution. We ordered 5 dishes. 2 came out almost immediately. Fantastic. \\nThen we waited for almost 20 minutes. \\n\\nGood thing I had an ice-ball to keep me busy?\\n\\nSo, I'll say this... I never complain or point out errors (I just take out my frustration on Yelp- passive aggressive, much? ) ... But when our server swiftly removed my husband's cocktail, while a quarter of it remained,\\n(Caveat: The Cuidado Piso Mojado is a *great* cocktail... Not an ice-ball in sight) \\nwe did politely mention it to her. She properly rectified the error. That was very-much appreciated- Thank-you! \\n\\nGo for the food. It's so, so tasty. We have yet to have a dish that we did not love. Forget (most of) the cocktails. They're not great. Get down to the eating & the wine & the company. \\n\\nBut please, management, make it a more customer-friendly experience. We may go back, once more, but it's sort of a last-try situation. There are too many great-food options in Austin to limit ourselves to mediocre patron appreciation.

Well, the entire location is just stunning, so that is no surprise.\\n\\nThere are a handful of stations you can order beer from.  The main tap room, and an outside tent.  You can start a tab at either one, and it will carry over to the other.  Though there is even a separate station to order bottles to go (the perks of a brewpub license).  That station is not connected with the other two.  So you are going to have two credit card charges, unless you bring cash for everything.

I think my favorite out of the three plates was the lobster ravioli,  It came out with a cream sauce that was delicious.  My veal and risotto was a little on the interesting side.  Being an Italian restaurant, I was hoping to get some pasta as my main dish and was disappointed I only got to choose between salmon, veal, and chicken.

The front desk staff that was dealing with the issue was impatient and rude. I asked what the charge should be on my bill once the charges were resolved and she kept telling me she didn't know and to call back in 7-10 business days.

I had the fried pork cutlet with a fried egg and sauteed spinach.

Also, the spinach was robustly flavored and the egg was orange-y yellow and runny. \\n\\nI scored a solo seat at the bar without a problem at 11 am on a Friday.

Great location(s)!\\n\\nYum! I think that's all I really need to say because if you've been here you know. \\n\\nMy husband is still comparing all other ice cream to this (all WAY sub-par in the Midwest) since our visit. He's hard to impress when it comes to unique food and flavor nuances, but this place just might put us on the fast track to a PDX relocation! (Thank you for that!)\\n\\nOn our two visits in two days, I had a salted caramel and something with almond crunch. I'd eat either in a heartbeat today, but would also not hesitate to try any other amazing flavor. The flavor choices are brilliant (if at times confusing). Allowing you to taste them builds confidence if you're thinking of going out on a whim. \\n\\nThe ambiance (at both Alberta and NW) were so darling I wanted to take pictures of all the adorable features-a mini photo shoot just for me.

Sure, it's a small dining area and yes, there is always a wait but every bite of food that Rino's Place serves is first-rate.  The menu is diverse; the quality and quantity of food is excellent.  And, when it comes to value, there are few restaurants that can come even close to this place.  In light of its exemplary food and in spite of the average service of its wait staff, Rino's Place has my highest recommendation.\\n\\nThe Ratings\\nOverall:  4.4 out of 5 stars\\nValue:  25 out of 25 points\\nFood:  5 out of 5 stars\\nService:  2.5 out of 5 stars\\nAmbience:  3 out of 5 stars\\n\\nThe Details\\nMy wife and I arrived just before 5pm on a weekday to find every one of the twelve, four seat tables full, except for a party of six or eight at the rear of the dining area.  The two patrons dining at the table near the entrance were departing so our wait for a table was less than two minutes.  The next seating was fifteen minutes later.\\n\\nFor my appetizer I chose rabbit sausage over broccoli rabe in oil and garlic.  The rabbit sausage was good, not exceptional.  The broccoli rabe, on the other hand, was one of the highlights of our meal; without question, the best broccoli rabe, or any other vegetabl I have ever eaten.  It was firm to the tooth and redolent in garlic, with a subtle bitterness.  We decided that the best use of the complimentary bread was to sop the sauce that remained after the broccoli rabe disappeared.\\n\\nA good salad comprised of a nice variety of crisp greens and sturdy vinaigrette arrived, soon after the last bit of broccoli rabe sauce had been consumed.  In retrospect, our salad was the only part of our entire meal that was anything other than excellent.\\n\\nMy wife ordered lobster ravioli.  Wow.  A delectable cheese and lobster meat filling that included many pieces of coarsely chopped lobster wrapped inside a flawlessly cooked fresh pasta dough.  And, to top things off, literally, there were chunks of lobster in the rich, well-seasoned cream sauce that covered the eight, large ravioli. There are no better ravioli, anywhere.\\n\\nFor my entr√©e I chose Frutti de Mare, a bounty of clams, mussels, shrimp and scallops saut√©ed in a clam, stock, and wine sauce served over a bed of homemade linguine.  The seafood was done to perfection ... that telltale \\"snap\\" and succulent center of the shrimp, tender meatiness of the mussel, and delicate softness of the sea scallop were evidence that the chef understands the art of cooking seafood to its properly.  But the star of this dish, like many of the offerings at Rino's Place, is the pasta.  From my experience most chefs miss the mark with fresh pasta.  Conversely, the pasta at Rino's Place is perfectly firm but retains the texture and flavor of fresh pasta.  I have eaten this dish, under a few different names, in many restaurants, across this country.  By far, the Frutti de Mare at Rino's Place is the best I ever had.\\n\\nAt the end of my meal my wife asked me what my favorite part of my meal was.  It took me a long time to choose but, ultimately, the fresh pasta won out, by the slimmest of margins, over the broccoli rabe.  Both were best-in-class but I chose the pasta because I have great respect for making such a simple food so damn good.  I have eaten a lot of pasta in my life and none of it has ever come close to that which Rino's Place delivers with ease.\\n\\nThe average salad notwithstanding, Rino's Place would have, easily, garnered the highest rating I have ever given a restaurant, except for one thing - service.  The dinner service, was, at best, average.  My water glass went unfilled, the time between plates was too long, and overall, I never had a sense that my server cared about the quality of my experience.  Basically, my server took my order, brought me my food and presented and processed my check.  Accordingly, the service at Rino's Place is a limit to an otherwise five star rating.  If I were the owners of Rino's Place I would correct that deficiency, at the earliest opportunity.\\n\\nOn the subject of value I can only make one remark - the portions are beyond generous.  Even in my 20s there is no way I could consume an entire entr√©e at Rinos' Place.  For example, a serving of lobster ravioli includes eight, large ravioli.  In most restaurants you would get four, of the same size.  My Frutti de Mare include ten little neck clams, a dozen mussels, two medium sized shrimp, six medium sized sea scallops and about a half of pound of pasta.  That is a lot of food, for $25.\\n\\nSo, although the food and the value receive the highest possible rating, Rino's Place does not achieve the highest overall score I have ever given.  Nonetheless, I most strongly recommend that you dine at Rino's Place; if I lived within a 30 minute drive of Boston you find me there every Friday or Saturday night."},{"name":"Easy Tiger","address":"709 E 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Don't let the technicality of its location on the dirty 6th scare you.

I dined here with my fianc√©e, her sister, and her husband and I could not have asked for a better experience. The atmosphere inside is that of a trendy Boston hot spot in the North End or the Back Bay. The entrance opens up to a cozy bar with a couple TV's while the dining room is a long and skinny (tables are close together but that just adds to the charm). The beer and wine list were nothing extravagant but they suited the place nicely. We started with the Pork Bracciola and the Mussels. Both dishes were great but the Mussels had another dimension to them......the SAUCE. The spicy garlic white sauce is a MUST and when you are done with the Mussels keep the sauce on the table and use it to dip your bread in! For dinner, we had the Pasta of the Day (tagliatelle with sliced rib eye in a cream sauce), Chicken Parmigiana, Stuffed Chicken, and the Pork Chops. All the dishes were great and the portions generous but our, hands down, favorite were the Pork Chops. The chops were huge, moist, and covered in vinegar peppers that were purely addictive. The same recommendation I had for the Mussels sauce goes for the Pork Chops. We ended our dinner with Cannolis and Tiramisu and then rolled (literally) out of the place.

Thus I follow the philosophy of compassionate dispatch by the inner martial artist. \\n\\nFirst the good. We were able to get a prime table on a busy Friday when all the other hot spots were booked for hours. The menu is compact but varied on the spectrum of meat to fish to vegetarian. The gazpacho, which is one of the dishes I experiment with at home, was excellent and inspired. It's finely pureed to orange, with garnishes of cherry tomato, scented oil and finely chopped hard boiled egg. We had a 3 antipasti choice, the stuffed squash blossom is a unique offering, the peaches and  prosciutto a great summer dish. \\n\\nTake advantage of the antipastoi. They have inspired deserts, the affogato is a double shot of espresso poured over a scoop of vanilla gelato with a biscotti for dipping. The waiter thoughtfully inquired caf or decaf. Yelpers could do no better for a romantic rendezvous with desert only, on an evening, if they are planning to be up with one another for hours, in the case of caf. Pleasure after pleasure. The semifreddo, a frozen custard, is also stellar.\\n\\nMy experience with the epic Genoa was a heavy, many course meal over hours with table staff who could recite every ingredient and the preparation of every dish on the menu in detail. The flavors were intense and saturated. Genoa was started by artists, and was democratic at sharing the tips equally with every employee including a friend who washed dishes there. Portland would not be the food capital it is today without Genoa.  \\n\\nNext, let me say I have not been to Italy, yet, so I am not representing authentic, country of origin, taste experience.\\n\\nBut I must say that the lamb bolognese tagliatelle needs some herding, and the entire menu would benefit from the self same analysis. The house-made pasta was cut more as a linguini rather than a traditional 1-1.5cm wide and thick- rolled tagliatelle. I'm an al'dente preferent, and this pasta was sadly weepy. The dish is healthily prepared with little salt, so the tables would benefit from salt and pepper being available without request. Bolognese has variations, the addition of carrots adds sweetness. If I were Accanto, I would review the spice profile and find a way for this dish to stand out. Same with the peaches and prosciutto, where is the uniqueness in spices? Do some competitive taste testing and up your game in a unique way. If you really want to be rad, have the waitstaff be able to recite the spice profile and query the customer if they want or decline intensity, make to order, then gather feedback on the results. \\n\\nAccanto has the capability to be the best Italian restaurant in Portland.

The space is perfect, with that kind of more than 100 year old Brooklyn interior look, but just built. They have done a great job with the recycled wood throughout. Because of the about 100% hard surfaces, when it's busy, the main room can be noisy. But you can step into the back room for that intense romantic conversation. \\n\\nHappy hour, 4-7, is $1 off drinks and entres, so not one of those too good to be true happy hour feed troughs. There was a good selection of rotating taps running toward the Wintery darks now. I wasn't super excited by the edamame mushroom burger, the patty is bean dry, though the bun is of good quality, it has a tasty wasabi mayo, and pickled onions are the garnish. Two soups and a desert are on the specials board. Almost every entr√©e can be made gluten free by turning it into a wrap, satisfying Portland's lust for the vegan gluten free happy hour. And the fact you can get broccoli as a side dish is outstanding. \\n\\nThe staff was great, though it runs busy, I wouldn't be in a rush. But that fits well with the low maintenance crowd.\\n\\nI'm happy the Sweet Hereafter is here now in this place, as if it has always been here.

But, my tastebuds are here to tell you that it is definitely a good idea to bake bread and serve beer all in the same place.  \\n\\nBeer: I would not describe myself as an avid beer drinker, but thanks to the interesting list of craft beers at Easy Tiger, there are lots of good choices.  For example, I just discovered the deliciousness that is Avery White Rascal.  Meanwhile, the bar also serves wine and liquor, but it IS a beer gardens, so the beer really is the main - and most exciting - event.    \\n\\nFood: The menu took a little bit of studying, but I quickly realized that the themed \\"Boards\\" where they give you a combination of meat, bread, and sides is the best way to get acquanited with their food.  Each of the boards includes an array of foods all in the same theme. For example, we had the New Yorker which included Pastrami (delicious), Corned Beef (peppery and awesome), a pretzel (chewy, yummy, but not quite warm enough), mustard (tangy), and Kraut.  I found the Kraut to be meh and well, dare I say, limp, but it is still a welcome respite from the meat and bread fest.  Meanwhile, the bratwurst was definitely a winner - it had good flavor and texture and the cute, little pretzel bun is my new best friend.  We didn't try it, but I am anxious to give the Antonelli's Cheese Platter a go.  \\n\\nBeer Cheese: whoever originally made up the name beer cheese could use a little marketing help because it sounds unappetizing.  But Easy Tiger's beer cheese is anything but ... in all honesty, I'm not sure that anyone at our table really knew what beer cheese was.  When it arrived, we all stared at the pretzel and what appeared to be a creamy mustard and, thinking that it was the something we did not order, we tried to send it away with the waitress away.  She assured us that it was, in fact, beer cheese.  We found out that she was, in fact, right and that in spite of it's crazy name, beer cheese is something we like - A LOT!\\n\\nAtmosphere & Accoutrements: somewhow Easy Tiger feels old-world European and modern all at the same time.  When you enter from 6th street, you are standing in the bakery and coffee shop.  The beer garden is downstairs and there are both inside and outside seating options.  By the way, whoever re-designed this place from it's former Habana Calle format deserves accolades because they managed to take a super-ugly space and transform it into a place that you actually want to be in!  The plastic-ware on which the food is served detracts from the new and improved fancy feeling a little more than I'd like.  But if you keep drinking glasses of beer, you will probably care less about the plastic forks and paper plates.  \\n\\nDessert: I couldn't find it on the menu!  They've got a bakery upstairs and a big ol' menu downstairs, so it would be super-exciting if they would put some of these things on the menu.  Or, how about some dessert-like beers?  Right now, Easy Tiger is a salty and savory oasis and a dessert Desert.  \\n\\nAll in all, this is a GREAT new option on 6th Street that's going to cause a few of it's neighbors to have to re-think their plan.  Easy there tiger!"},{"name":"Oriental Express","address":"7517 Cameron Rd, Ste 130","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"My coworker and I ordered delivery last Friday.

After hiking Multnomah Falls, my parents and I wanted something warm and filling. After reading the reviews, we decided this was the spot to try! \\n\\nWe ordered takeout: 2 orders of wings and 1 order of the Curry & Roti set #1. We also ordered a side of jasmine rice, but I didn't get to check my order before picking it up and noticed that our side of rice was missing. That's $3 I'll never see again! This is why I only gave this place 4 stars.. lack of attention to detail. \\n\\nThe wings and fried chicken was very good! It had a sweet and spicy flavor palette and the chicken was so crunchy on the outside but oh so gloriously juicy on the inside. \\nThe roti and curry was also a great addition to the meal!

The colors are neutral, but all the swirly lines draw my eye (when taking a break from people watching). The space is set up with rectangular tables on the dark end of the cafe- but taken over by the laptop crowd (this must be where the plugs are too). So I sat in the circular table section, near the windows. The other circular tables were occupied by various meetings. Setting up deals seems to be the popular thing here. And as I observe it's funny to watch people's posture change. At one table someone is always leaning forward expectantly- but the person keeps changing- like the tension/relaxation moves sporadically around the table.\\n\\nI would have liked to have sat at the window counter (one of my new favorite things)- but the stools didn't appeal to me. No backs (which isn't always a problem)- but today it wasn't for me. Also- the window view is a bit of a toss up. It looks out to the section of Granville being ripped up for the new Canada Line. I'm excited about the line. It says it will open in 2009. So I hope to get some use out of it. I'm not sure if Canadian agencies actually meet their timelines (unlike the American lazy-procrastinating-World Super Power agencies). We'll see. I'm semi-interested, semi-bored by the underground infrastructures. But I am glad to be a part of big city life- and I have an affection for the skytrain.\\n\\nOk, so the drink. I went out on a limb today and got my favorite drink- Chai- but this time I got it hot. It's been like a year since I've had a hot chai. I like them and all, but I love a good iced chai. So the hot chai... it had a decent foam on top- not the velvety stuff I like. When getting a hot chai it's customary for their to be some hot water in there- it brings out the concentrate's flavors or something. This one had more water than I'd like- or rather I wished it had a spicier or creamier taste. Not that it was bad- it was just average. In addition, the finished product is not topped with cinnamon. Not a standard feature- but it should be! Anyway, the condiment bar quickly resolves that issue.\\n\\nMaybe next time I'll get the iced chai or a hot white chocolate. mmm!"},{"name":"MJ O'Connor's","address":"425 Summer St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Three words: Steak.

Great brunch spot to try different dishes with friends.\\n\\n\\n[SERVICE]\\nService was great! Our waitress explained that the dishes were meant to be shared tapas style so everyone gets a taste of something. She gave us time and checked on us throughout our meal to make sure everything came out okay.\\n\\n[FOOD]\\n- Auntie Mae's French Toast (4/5) - The french toast comes in two sizes (the small and large). Had to knock it down a star because the large size is only four decent-sized slices and it was $12! The pear maple jam is absolutely delicious-- not too sweet but just a kick of the pear flavor, but a tad pricey for the portion you get.\\n\\n- Chilaquiles (4.5/5) - Roasted chicken, salsa verde, and two over easy eggs. The server that brought us the food recommended that we topped the dish off with lime, but the dish already had an overwhelming taste of lime. The salsa verde went great with the entire dish and the sunny side up eggs gave the dish a great texture! Would have given the dish 5/5 if the lime wasn't so strong.\\n\\n- Shakshuka w/Merguez Sausage - (4.5/5) Baked eggs and tomato stew with sausage and toast. This dish came out hot and still bubbling! Absolutely delicious, but a little runny for my taste. I'm not sure if it's supposed to be a little runny, but when you eat it with the toast it's an incredible bite! The sausage gives the dish a great flavor and has a little spicy kick to it!\\n\\n- Tasty Steak & Cheddar Eggs - (4/5) With a cornmeal pancake and jalapeno butter. The steak is served in 4 pieces and only medium rare. The dish is brought out on a hot skillet so you know the dish is freshly served! The steak and eggs were definitely great-- the steak was cooked great and who doesn't love cheesy eggs? The cornmeal pancake was good, but a little too sweet.\\n\\n[TL;DR]\\nGreat service, try the chilaquiles and shakshuka!"},{"name":"Swift's Attic","address":"315 Congress Ave, Ste 200","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I'd been looking forward to trying Swift's Attic after a coworker raved about it.
