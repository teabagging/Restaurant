The plin and burrata came in a tasty pea sauce with grana padano foam on top. Delicious! The beef shank was tender and I think it would be tastier if it had more sauce on it.

The steak was perfectly cooked (med-rare) and you can definitely taste the difference between the Prime Niman beef and others.  \\n\\n2x Crispy seared yellowtail with creamless creamed corn (AMAZING)\\nThe creamless corn was ridiculously good.  I don't know what the chef did but he must have put crack in it.  The fish was excellent also but the creamless corn was definitely the star of the dish.\\n\\nCoconut Cake\\nPretty good but nothing amazing.

For starter our group had the Gruyere biscuits (decent) which were buttery and fresh, flavorful shrimp tacos (delicious), pretzels(decent)  with beer fondue, and grouper fritters (tasty).  For mains: a beautiful steak and shoe string fries, perfectly cooked venison with truffle butter, gorgeous juicy grouper, and i had home made truffled pappardelle pasta (which was stuck together in clumps, a bit dry with no sauce to speak of, and cold).  We were delighted when presented with all of the desserts, my favorite was the chocolate pear truffle, decadent and rich but not overly heavy.  Tying for second were the pig tails (long thin beignets) and the creme brule.  My comrades raved about the \\"PB&J\\",  a delicate chocolate cookie with vanilla bean gelato on top, a blackberry compote and crushed peanuts, but it wasn't my style, and there was an apple bread pudding with caramel which was moist and texture was perfect, but the flavor wasn't quite stunning enough to overshadow the other desserts.  \\n\\nAll in all it was a nice experience, the dining room was not overcrowded or loud, even filled with people, and the staff was friendly and helpful.

The cashier was singing full out to the music while taking orders, although nice to see her enjoying her work, lacking at a level of customer service and some professionalism.

Now, not that I didn't give her one, it's wasn't the amount she believe she deserved. To be fair, she did mess up my order and she didn't check in very often and still I tipped for this level of service. After I pay she looks at me and says \\"Was there anything wrong with the service?\\" I was like, sorry? My group says no and lost why she would ask. \\n\\nNow, that's awkward. To make it worst. She came back to the table and gave everyone a Storm Crow Adventurers Guild Card and made it a point I didn't get one. I honestly didn't really care. Extremely childish. My group was lost why I didn't get one, and I mentioned to them she wasn't happy with the tip I gave. She over heard this, and then somehow came over and gave me one. \\n\\nHonestly, I love the place, though service like this, is just painful and awkward.

Dots has relaunched under new ownership !!! The changes are minimal. A scaled down menu, same velvet wallpaper decor and loud obscure-to-hypnotic music. Same ugly bathrooms (the one thing that should have changed) and virtually no physical changes I can detect. GONE are the dots signature cocktails including their delicious bloody Mary. BOO!  I asked them to make me an old \\"Dots\\" version and they tried, VERY close but no cigar.  So it was on the house. :-) The menu no longer resembles anything of its former glory (Oh how I miss you sad eyed puppies and kittens).  No more delicious multiple Mexican dishes or caravan platter. Goodbye tuna melt, veggie platter, spinach quesadilla and the famous Dots Burrito Bowl. :-( Although the vegan deluxe, gentle Ben and grilled cheese are still available and luckily the spicy tofu sauce survived the change.  A smaller menu consisting of 4 appetizers, one vegan soup, 4 salads, 6 varieties of hand cut Belgian fries with toppings like: cheddar, bacon, jalape√±o, garlic and herbs with tomato jam. Nachos, 2 quesadillas (black bean and BBQ) and 7 burgers/sandwiches). Although the prices are similar if not slightly less than its previous menu; the burgers do now come with fries, soup or salad. The small additions help its smaller menu: a cheese plate appetizer, new salad dressings like goat cheese honey and miso. A pineapple salsa and burgers on brioche.  They have a new POS system so no more hand written tickets. As for the staff: my understanding is that it's a whole new crew. Prior to its departure, a long time Dots server informed me that no one from the original staff was on board for the relaunched restaurant. So what's my overall impression?  If you are a long time Dots fanatic like I am, the menu may disappoint you at first but overall it feels just like the old dot's minus the familar faces we've come to love.  Thank God the fries are still available. The smaller and less impressive menu was in my opinion POORLY designed and looks like a novice typed it on MS Notepad.  It was single spaced and hard to read, didn't give you that confident feeling and I think that highly intoxicated people may have a hard time reading it.  But less options makes it easier to decide what to order I suppose. The menu now resembles a typical \\"Dive Bar\\" selection of burgers, nachos, salads and fries. Where as the old Dots menu had at least a flash of \\"This might be more than a bar\\" attitude. If you're looking for that kitch cooler drink or one of their signatures that you've grown to love; you may be out of luck.  Replaced is a new list of signature cocktails that sound absolutely fantastic.  I had the \\"Thorn in my Sidecar\\" and let me say \\"YUMMY\\".  All in All the food I had was delicious, the staff were uber friendly and the bathrooms still looked terrible. The smaller menu I will have to get used to but as a relaunch under new ownership I'm sure that if enough people request a certain item it may find its way back onto the menu. Most importantly I appreciate the fact that the true essence of \\"Dots\\" with its velvet walpaper, weird paintings and dark kitch decore were left alone."},{"name":"Arepazo Tapas & Wine","address":"93 N High St","city":"Gahanna","stars":"4.5","text":"My favorite restaurant!

We also got the BBQ shrimp and grits. Nice flavor but had a sort of flat aftertaste. And of course we tried the Frites... they were fries, nothing special. For our entrees we went with the pork chop and fried chicken. The pork chop was awesome! Great flavor with a nice black eye pea side. The fried chicken was good, but we have had better. The mashed potatoes that came with the chicken were creamy and delicious. For dessert, we split the Blackberry Cobbler and a scoop of vanilla ice cream which we had to order separate. Call me southern but cobbler should automatically come with ice cream. I would say the cobbler was more of a blackberry compote with some crumble on top. We were all really hoping for a nice crust but there wasn't any.

They had some brown spots where the tortillas got crispy on the grille, but that gave them a nice consistency and flavor.\\n\\nMy other friend got the Baja California Wrap - a wheat tortilla stuffed with grilled chicken strips, sliced avocado, shredded lettuce, roasted red peppers, baby spinach and spicy mayo. It sounded awesome and she said it was.\\n\\nWith drinks and food, the bill only came out to a bit over $100. Which is a great price for lots of food and drinks.

Also, there are occasional movie screenings on a big projector. Extra cold out? Grab one of the blankets from the shelf to the left of the door and cozy up!\\n3.

I approached the temptress cautiously. I had never been with a gastropub before so I'll admit, I was nervous. The night began with a ravenous pig old fashion. Nothing like some bacon infused bourbon to kick off a night of passion. This foreplay continued with an order of the roasted bone marrow. With every bite, I fell deeper in love. As I scraped the last spoon of marrow from the bone, I decided to take things to the next level. Things got hot and heavy once I ordered the pub burger. Melted blue cheese... Brioche bun... A side of truffled fries... Divine. The main course was now over, but I couldn't find it in me to part ways with her just yet. I had to have more. I ordered the pig tails to buy some more time.

I obtained my room through Hotwire, so I did not pay full price for my room. I am very glad I didn't pay the suggested usual price of $375 a night. I paid about $126.00.  I would and am quite pleased with the hotel for that price that paid.  At $375 I don't think I would feel the same. The room was large and the bathroom was quite lovely, with marble and nice bath products. The towels were fluffy.  I didn't find the mattress extremely comfortable, though. There was no fan in the bathroom, which was disappointing, it got quite steamy.  The double shower head was nice.  The TV was extremely small (about 38 inches I would guess) considering how far away it was from the bed.  We had to strain to see it. Fortunately, we weren't in the room long and weren't watching much TV, but it is worth mentioning, especially if you paid full price. The service was very attentive and we were given bottled water while we waited for our car to be brought up from the garage.  The garage valet was expensive, but what are you going to do? The hotel is nice, but feels a bit worn and thread-worn and in need of an update. Some stains in the carpet, etc. I would recommend this hotel if you don't pay full price.

I understand that this was a relatively new place when I tried it out, so things may have changed.\\n\\nWhen my boyfriend and I did visit, though, we had one of the worst dining experience we have had thus far in the greater Boston area. It has since stuck with me and inspired my first Yelp review.\\n\\nI really wanted to like this place having just moved to Cambridge and also having come back from a summer trip to China.  My boyfriend and I went for lunch on a relatively slow day and ordered bubble tea as well as dumplings. The place was small but cute enough inside.  Once we put our initial order in, however, two more tables sat - forcing the one host/server into a tizzy of sorts.  She became quite flustered and ultimately blamed a coworker who hadn't shown up for his shift on the slow/obviously poor service.\\n\\nAt one point, after waiting ~10 minutes for the boba, and still waiting for our first order of dumplings, Patty Chen herself came into the dining room to openly scold the server for her poor attendance.  \\n\\nWhen the three sets of dumplings ultimately arrived, they were only luke-warm.  While I can imagine that they would have been pretty good served hot, the experience had already been marred. \\n\\nFinally, when the bill came, it was on an iPad (a personal pet peeve, I can understand that restaurants may be moving this way).  The issue here was that the server had no idea how to split the bill.  We ended up over-tipping due to her lack of understanding (something we certainly had no intention of doing).  \\n\\nOverall, not an experience worth repeating.

It would have taken me all night to read through it all. It's a bit overwhelming, but you can browse by type of alcohol, then choose the drink you want, then the brand of alcohol.  I had a pisco sour, and it was pretty darn good.  Not the best ever, and the drink was a bit heavy on the ice, but it was a good size portion and only $10, as opposed to $12 at Pourhouse.  The wine we had with dinner was delightful, a syrah-viognier, but they kept running out of the more moderately priced wines, (were out of the malbec to start which was $8/glass, then ran out of the syrah-viognier which was $10/glass, so by the end of the meal, our options were the $12/glass of red wine or the more expensive options).\\n\\nThe food.  Oh, the food.  The bread and herbed butter that was comp was lovely.  And then my meal came.  I ordered the duck, and it was fall-off-the-bone tender and the large grain cous cous was flavourful and perfect.  My meal didn't look huge, but I was pretty full after eating it.  But there had to be room saved for the cheese menu, so it was a perfect amount of food for me.  I had a bite of my friend's cheese tart and wow, it was rich, filling, and so good.  \\n\\nThe cheese menu.  I am a cheese addict.  I love cheese.  I love the stinky, strong cheeses.  I love the delicate and mild cheeses.  I love it all.  So we tried 3 different cheeses, and got the fig jam to accompany.  We tried a roquefort blue sheep cheese, which was supposed to be the mild one, and was soft and lovely, but too strong for my friend.  It was spreadable and I ate it all.  We also had a mild, earthy, rind washed cheese from France, and a cloth-wrapped aged cheddar.  Both were good, though I liked the cheddar better, which was rather hard and surprising.  The fig jam had a very strong licorice taste to it, which was odd.  It went very well with the blue cheese, as the flavours balanced well, but it was too overpowering for the milder cheeses, especially the rind washed cheese.  That cheese would have been nice with some honey.  \\n\\nService was decent, and while the waitress helped us pick some cheeses, a recommendation on the jams and sides would have been useful.  We also had to ask for fresh bread with our cheese, which should have been a no-brainer.\\n\\nThe decor is cute, and I like the blue chairs (one of which they are raffling off), but as my friend mentioned, there seemed to be something missing a little from the atmosphere.  Maybe because it got so dark in the evening, I'm not sure.  It's a neat place to people watch, though.  The bathroom also left something to be desired.  It was tiny, cramped, and could have used a little cleaning.  And there were no bag hooks.  I really wish more places would put bag hooks in the stalls.\\n\\nOverall:\\nExcellent food, which despite looking small, was pretty filling.\\nCheese!\\nGreat drinks.\\nOkay atmosphere and service.\\nDisappointing that they ran out of the moderately priced wines on a Friday.\\nThumbs part-way down for the bathroom."},{"name":"Vanbarry's Public House","address":"4120 S Orange Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Casual, live music, good service but dang I was not expecting this burger.

The article in this weekend's newspaper really made me want to visit:  but after this evening, I don't think I will be returning again.  The manager did his best to try to make it right:  but it just wasn't.  This was a milestone birthday celebration and I wanted to go some place different:  some place that promised excellence.  I don't mind paying a lot for a meal:  but I do mind paying for something that I feel is not up to par.  We ordered an appetizer to share:  it was okay but certainly not great.  I ordered the carne asada as my meal and my husband ordered the pork chop.  My main course was $24:  for about 3 oz. of partly overcooked and partly tough meat with a couple of tablespoons of refried beans.  My meal was served before we had even finished the appetizer and I was done by the time my husband's meal arrived.  The manager gave us a gift card to make up for the inconvenience of not having the plates served at the same time - a gift card that could be used on the next visit.  But I just don't feel like I would want to go back again.  \\n\\nThe service was good - I will grant that.

They apparently give 10% if you give cash. Obviously this is so they don't pay taxes (yet of course if they get sick, they will use the healthcare system like everyone else, and when they get old, they will use social security). I went to withdraw cash, plopped down what I owed in twenties, which came to about two dollars more than the total, and though generally the advice is not to tip for take-out, I usually have a habit of leaving about 3-10% (more for less expensive items that take a little effort), so I stuck my hand in my change pocket to see whether I had a loonie or twoonie, when the manager woman (I just couldn't say \\"lady\\"), gave me a dirty look and said \\"You give some more tip. The cooks they cook until they are sweating\\". I was a bit taken aback by this, and though I was intending to top up initially, this attitude made me decide to just tell her to keep the two dollars of change. So she yells out to the cook \\"get the food for this person who only gave $2 tip!\\" So of course, after I took the food, I thought about it a bit and decided I probably didn't want to risk eating hork from a sweating, underpaid cook, so I dumped it out and just went to the Boston Pizza next door. Just a really horrible person. If they had told me when I ordered that there is an automatic service charge, that would be understandable. But there was no such thing, and if you want a tip, you ask nicely. I guess this woman probably hires illegal migrants and doesn't pay them a living wage and expects to pressure clients into making up for it.

I'd rate it a solid \\"good.\\"\\n\\nThe Things We Tried:\\n\\n- Escalivada (Roasted Vegetables) - a petite plate of ribboned roasted-till-soft eggplant and peppers.\\n - Roasted beets, arugula & goat cheese - lots of arugula with cubed red and yellow beets and a sprinkling of goat cheese.  We (6 of us) agreed this was easily the best plate of the night, but I wouldn't specifically seek out this dish at a tapas restaurant.\\n-  Piquillo peppers w/dungess crab - a petite dish ($10) with two pepper slices and a bit of crab in a delicious creamy soup (made with red peppers?)\\n-  Bravas (fried potatoes) - good, a \\"what you see is what you get\\" kind of dish.\\n- Gambas ajillo (grilled shrimp with garlic) - the second best thing we tried; the seasoning (paprika, garlic) made the dish.\\n - Grilled chorizo w/garbanzo beans and a chimichurri sauce - the chorizo came as a whole sausage (I had envisioned it mixed in with other ingredients) and was mildly spicy with good flavor.  The garbanzo beans in the chimichurri sauce were very tasty.\\n- Braised oxtail in a red wine sauce - a petite portion ($12) of meat over mashed potatoes.  It had good flavor.\\n- Arros Mediterrani (paella) w/ saffron rice, monkfish, shrimp & veggies with a Romesco sauce (large size).  Perhaps it was the type of sauce (made from roasted peppers, nuts and oil) that made the paella somewhat oily and missing was a nice crispy paella \\"crust\\".   The monkfish pieces were scant.  There were two whole shrimp adorning the top.  Mixed in with the medley of peas, carrots and potatoes was an assortment of olives which added some flair to the taste and presentation.\\n\\nI don't recommend coming here if you are a vegetarian and especially not if you are a vegan.  Guest: \\"what vegetarian options do you have?\\"  Server: \\"well we have the cheese plate.\\"  There are some veggie options on the menu, but given the portion sizes it would be hard to create a solid meal from the selection unless you shared the vegetarian paella.\\n\\nBonus: Free Garage Parking!\\n\\nAnd speaking of tapas here's a true story:  I was in Vegas and couldn't recall the name of the restaurant I read about and wanted to try, so I asked our hotel concierge if he knew about a good place to go for tapas.  He looked at me and my two girlfriends with an odd expression, gave pause, and then proceeded to tell us about a couple of good places to go see topless women."},{"name":"Concordia Coffee House","address":"2909 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I am really happy that Caffe Vita has made their move to PDX!

Not for those on a diet.  I really want to like this place more, but the management needs to get their act together with the service.  I was there twice in the past 2 weeks and was disappointed both times.  Went last night for a couple of beers.  They have one of the best beer lists in the city.  The place was not crowded, but the bartender took nearly 10 minutes to pour our beer after our order went in. We were in eye shot of her and she  seemed to be doing nothing (in slow motion).  They don't have a full liquor license so literally all she had to do was pour beer from a tap into a glass.  Our waiter actually had time to apologize for the delay 3 times and seemed embarrassed.  When she \\"poured\\" the beer, she put the glass on the bar below the tap and just opened it, never holding the glass, so we basically both got a pint of foam.  I'm still baffled that someone could have such a simple job and do it so poorly.  I actually wondered if she was in a bad mood and trying to piss off the waitstaff (and I guess customers too).\\n\\nMy brunch the previous weekend was no better.  35-40 minutes after our order a different waiter looked at our empty table and asked if we'd like anything else or if she could bring our check.  We informed her (and the host) that we hadn't been served any food yet.  Our waitress likely forgot to put in our order, judging from people near us getting food who sat after U.S.  This happens.  Not a big deal.  Just come by, apologize and maybe give us a piece of bread.  There were actually tons of servers and 3 separate ones asked if we were \\"all set\\", but when we said we were still waiting for our food, they went on to serve other tables.  The 2 hosts were looking at us the whole time, but never once came over.\\n\\nWhen it finally came, 3 of the 4 of us got food and the 4th (the breakfast sandwich) came 5 minutes later.  We had to ask for butter for the English muffins (they were dry) and sugar for the coffee.  The other food was very tasty (breakfast pizza, heart attack hash), but the experience made us talk about choosing other options in the neighborhood next time.  Too bad.

The portions are large and the prices reasonable, but the dishes lack flavor. You might find yourself scrambling for the hot sauce to add an extra kick to the food. That being said, Oriental De Cuba has some pretty interesting dishes (ie. Plantains stuffed with ground meat, Drunken Goat, Butt Steak), which gives it some variety.\\n\\nI had the shredded beef platter which came with a large portion of yellow rice and beans, sweet plantains, and some weird, flattened plantain cracker. The shredded beef came with peppers and onions in some sort of broth that I'm guessing was supposed to be spicy, but really wasn't. The beef itself was of good quality, and they give a substantial amount. The sweet plantains are probably the best part of the dish. They're lightly fried and have a subtle sweet taste.\\n\\nThe girlfriend had the roasted pork platter, which was just a whole lot of greasy. That sided with a huge mountain of black bean rice and yuka potatoes, and you got yourself quite a deal at $10. \\n\\nFor lack of better judgment, we also shared a stuffed plantain. Not because it didn't taste good, but because it pushed us both over into food coma heaven. It was actually very delicious, with just a small amount of ground meat mixed in with the plantain. Who would have thought the two would taste so good together, especially since the dish looks more like a breaded chicken patty than a plantain. \\n\\nProbably what stops this place from getting another star is the service. While very friendly, we literally waited about a week for the waitress to get our check. She disappeared at one point, which is pretty hard to do with the restaurant being so small. Plus the fact that some lady in the corner was clapping like a circus monkey for 20 minutes to entertain a baby was driving me out of my mind!

Although there were was still ongoing construction in the main entryway, the restaurant soft-launched last week.\\n\\nHudson Grille considers itself and \\"upscale sports bar\\", and the furnishings and surroundings of the place seem to support that. The place is beautifully appointed, with the bar and some seating on a main level, and a more elegant restaurant section up a brief flight of stairs. And unlike your typcial sports bar where waitresses adorn tight, breast-accentuating t-shirts and shorts (not that there is anything wrong with this), the staff at Hudson Grille wear shirts with collars and pants. Even in their first week, the staff was incredibly friendly and helpful.\\n\\nLike your favorite sports bar, there are flat screen tvs at every turn of the head, and the menu is much more sports bar than fine dining. The two sided menu is 50% appetizers, 25% dog/burgers/sandwiches, and 25% entrees/steaks/seafood. We started with an order of the chips and guacamole, and Little Steakhead and I made quick work of it. We also split a cheeseburger and an order of wings. The burger was great. We had two flavors of wings- wasabi/ranch and the asian Samurai wings. The wasabi ranch, while sounding interesting, was a horrible choice. First they look unappealing, with a thick yellow sauce. The taste was equally as uninviting. The asian wings were better, but if I want wings while watching a game, I will almost always go to the Taco Mac across the street.\\n\\nHerein lies their challenge. If you look at what I ordered, chips, a burger and some wings, I might as well have gone to Taco Mac. The thing that Hudson Grille has going for it, is it could be a destination where someone wanting to watch sports and get a good meal can go. If the menu pushes the apps, burgers and 6 flavors of wings, they are playing in Taco Mac's wheel house, and will likely lose. In fact, I went in leaning towards getting a steak, but was scared away because the price was too low at $15. Believe it or not, if it was priced in the low-20s, it may have instilled some confidence.\\n\\nI will go back to Hudson Grille to try out a couple of their entrees next time. I am also interested to see if they expand the menu at all. Being so close, I really want to see this place succeed. Upscale dining and sports would be a great combo for me."},{"name":"Tin Shed Garden Cafe","address":"1438 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Self serv water, coffee and tea.

The meat is dryer than it would be at a legitimate gyro shop so not the best but pretty solid for a pizza joint. Pizzas are great along with signature wraps and subs. \\n\\nAs for the salads, don't waste your calories or money.

The chicken was under cooked and tough. I truly believe that management was not prepared for the influx of patrons during the opening of the restaurant so they ruched to cook everything thus leaving yellow rice and chicken under cooked.

I loved the decor, similar to shoya with the classic Japanese influence.\\n\\nWe ordered two appetizers, the takoyaki and the fried squid legs. The squid legs were lightly battered and crispy. The takoyaki came out hot but it almost had a gooey consistency, the flavor was good but nothing amazing.\\n\\nFor the mains, three of us ordered spicy miso tonkatsu ramen with corn. For any ramen lovers out there, I highly recommend adding corn to your ramen as an extra topping it adds little bites of sweetness to the saltiness of the ramen. The ratio of ingredients though is what really kills this review for me, there was way too much noodles for the amount of broth & other toppings that were in the ramen. Also, I feel like the broth didnt have that depth of flavor you need in a ramen broth so that where it loses marks for me.\\n\\nMy friend also ordered the pork tonkatsu which came in almost like a lunch box set with miso soup, potato salad and the classic tonkatsu sauce.

This fantastic Scotch Egg appetizer is certainly is genuine and can stand side to side with anything you would get in a quality establishment in Britain.

Our two-top table was placed near other tables because the restaurant is small, but I didn't feel like I was having to hear others' conversation or that they could hear what I was saying.   The service was friendly, and because I couldn't distinguish what kind of accent the waitstaff had, Ipretended everyone was authentically Italian. The ambience definitely lends to a more romantic and intimate vibe.  \\n\\nNow onto the food, I ordered the Capellini al basil (hope I spelled that right).  There was yummy warm buttery bread on the table along with some olives and other vinegar-soaked veggies to tide us over until our food arrived.  I thought my pasta was good although maybe a tad over al dente, but definitely good enough to get a to go box because the portions were huge.  Also ordered the house Pinot Grigio, which was just that, a house wine to go along with our food.  I didn't have room for dessert but I'm looking forward to going back to try their Tiramisu."},{"name":"Vij's Restaurant","address":"3106 Cambie Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"I LOVE Rangoli and really want to like Vij's.

But then your server and the staff seem to take you on this journey and they describe how the food looks, smells, tastes. Where your mouth starts to salivate and you have to wipe your drool from the menu. \\nWe started off with the cheese board biscuits. The ravenous probably has the best cheese board in winter park. They give you 3 different types of cheeses. Each one of the cheeses hits a different part of your pallet. And the biscuits, well how can you go wrong with biscuits and Vermont butter on top of them ?\\n\\nMy entree was the bison short ribs, which if you look online at the menu it won't be there. Best short ribs i have ever had. The best part about it was the grilled watermelon underneath that gave the short ribs a meaty but refreshing taste. \\n\\nMy wife and mother in law both got the corn puree ravioli which to me was the best thing out of everything. They puree whole corn and combined it with a gnocchi risotto. With a shredded beef on top of it all. A smaller portion, which if your not that hungry then that's the way to go. \\n\\nMy farther in law decided on the pork porter house, which if you have never been here before. This is what you have to get. It's a 3 inch thick smoked pork chop that's cooked medium and it's simply amazing. You get this smoky, salty, buttery taste in every bite. And to pair with it was these lemon bacon potatoes which was out of bounds good as well. \\n\\nThe ladies stuck to wine. Where I decided on a Manhattan which isn't on their menu. I recommend it over the old fashioned. The way I got it was neat, with bullet bourbon. One of the best I've had. \\n\\nAnd for dessert we decided on the pig tails and donuts. Pig tails was good.

I sat at the sushi bar, but won't make that mistake again. I have good height, but the bar was still uncomfortably tall. I was swiftly greeted by my waiter Ken, who turned out to be awkward and slightly overbearing, but he was very attentive and seemed to genuinely care about my experience. The menu was simple, easy to understand, and had a nice mixture of traditional items and a few with a twist. I started out with the tuna tataki. On first bite it was very nice, but as I was making my way thru the dish it seemed to be one note. I kept wanting a citrus level to heighten the flavor and cut thru the monotony. For my entree I had their signature kitana roll and super rainbow roll. Both were decent, but nothing to really write home about. The fish used was served a little warmer than I prefer. the tempura flakes on the kitana roll were stale, and with the seaweed salad layered on top would have probably been more enjoyable if it were wrapped on the inside. I couldn't find anything with the brand name of the soy sauce they used but it was slightly sweet, and thicker than usual. The highlight came at the end of the meal with dessert. Ken suggested the tempura battered and fried ice cream made with pound cake and vanilla ice cream. It wasn't obnoxiously sweet like most desserts so I was very happy he mentioned it. So to sum it all up this promising menu and atmosphere were not lived up to in execution. It was decent but the only thing that would sway me to give it another go is Ken the delightfully awkward caring server.

The food finally came, but we were never given our taco appetizer. So while we waited for our server we started eating because we were hungry. My fianc√© cut her steak and she was upset to find it was med rare and she can't eat anything less than well done. So we had to wait for the server to come so they can cook it more. \\n\\nSo she had to wait more time and began getting crankier. My burger was pretty good and I was happy with that. So we finally got her steak and she liked it and the server came around and apologized for it.

We just said whatever and finished our food. \\n\\nOnce we were done, he came by and picked up our plates and said, \\"I know why I didn't put your tacos, it's because you need room for desert\\" and dropped off a desert menu.

A buddy of mine told me they had a Banh Mi taco, so I was VERY interested in trying this out.  \\n\\nI got there around 2PM(they closed at 3PM)and it was painfully obvious that I was new there because I was taking so much time checking out their menu!  The cashier was quick to address any questions I had and he recommended the Cowboy Taco and the Banh Mi taco and an order of chips n salsa.\\n\\nSat down and waited and noticed they served Maine Root sodas on tap! Nice!!  The tacos didn't take long to come out at all, and I noticed the chips were prepackaged in plastic bags.   Wasn't expecting that, but they tasted great!  Just wish they were warmed up.  I will ask them if they can do that next time.  I got their \\"Dona(pronounce DOH-NYAH)\\" salsa and it was GREAT!  Perfect balance of spice and garlic!  After about 8 chips I started to sweat from the heat but I couldn't put the chips down!  \\n\\nI took a bite of the Banh Mi taco and it was delicious! The pork cuts were juicy, hot and perfectly seasoned/marinated.  The pickled toppings and cilantro just just it all off perfectly.  Loved-loved-loved it!\\n\\nThe Cowboy Taco was just as good with tender juicy cuts of beef and guac.  The perfect signature beef fajita taco.  The only thing I would do differently is have the tortillas cooked a little longer.  I ordered them with flour and I like mine rather toasty.  I asked the manager if I can order them that way and he said absolutely!  So the next time I come in I will most definitely order them custom.\\n\\nIt's a little pricey for tacos, but you're paying for wonderful service and the top notch flavors that are packed into their tacos.

That's about the only good part. Service was so slow even though the place was empty.\\n\\nBubbles with brunch is pretty inaccurate. You MAYBE get 3 small glasses.

My parents love this place as well and it is pretty much one of our staples when we are looking for a nice meal. The menu is great, much more than your typical Steak and Seafood place. They have several other dishes that look great that aren't steak or seafood, but I love steak so I have always ended up getting a dish that had at least some steak. One of my absolute favorites here is the Filet trio, which used to be a special, but I'm assuming due to its popularity is now a regular on the menu. Three filet medallions with three different toppings- Bearnaise sauce, Maytag Blue cheese, and wild mushrooms. All are fantastic! On my latest visit I was craving some Salmon but wasn't willing to give up my steak so I got the Petite Filet Combo with the Grilled Atlantic Salmon and it hit the spot! The sides are great too, I usually get the White Cheddar Chipotle mashed potatoes which are delicious but I also tried the Lobster Mac and Cheese that my brother ordered and it was TO DIE FOR! I also very much enjoy the asparagus they serve with the entree. Asparagus is one of my favorite vegetables but they serve it with this little tomato salsa on top and it adds a fantastic touch. I haven't ventured out too much myself in ordering different things of the menu as I am a lover of steak but some of my dinner partners have ordered other entrees and no one has ever been disappointed. They also have a great selection of appetizers, a great wine list, and very tempting desserts! Oh I forgot to mention that the Maryland Crab Bisque is DELICIOUS!! If you are looking for a soup/salad, entree, and dessert try their Prix Fixe menu they are currently featuring for $34/pp. There are only two desserts listed as options but the servers are fantastic and have always let us choose anything we want.

I had previously given a bad review after coming in the winter and freezing at the front of the restaurant with a meal that kept repeating the same flavors.  Not this time. Will definitely go again.

I once had a guy offer good $$$ to buy that taco off of me after a long night out on Rock Rose... and I denied him.

And if fish isn't your thing, you can't go wrong with any of the pork tacos. The one drawback here is that the tacos are a tad bit on the pricey side - the poke taco is upwards of $7 after tax, and the average taco is ~$4. One taco is definitely not satisfying enough for a full meal, so most of the time my friends and I each order two.

The food is great, and service is good too. But, if you want gluten free- BEWARE. \\nYes, I am one of those customers. But, let me say, I rarely eat out because of it. \\nIt all started when I shopped too long, into lunch time, with my toddler & mom. We decided to take a chance and eat out, even if I always say I will never eat out because I always get glutened. \\nWell, we stumbled in here thinking I could order something super safe and all would be well. Well, to my pleasant surprise they had numerous items that were noted to be \\"Gluten Free\\". Most items, in fact. Awesome!! I ordered a few things for my daughter and I, and asked to make sure they were in fact gluten free. The waitress assured me. \\nI am very, very sensitive. As is my daughter. I was so happy to see they had gluten free items, and hours later I could tell they were in fact careful- we hadn't been glutened! I was so excited. Eating out is a real pain for us, literally. \\n\\nThree days later we were late getting home so I suggested we go out, my husband knows eating out is risky but I told him of this great place that I went and didn't get sick from. So we all drove the 30 minutes to Belmont to get Thai food. Halfway through our meal, of ALL gluten free items I started feeling it. I knew I had eaten gluten. My husband assured me that he also saw everything we ordered with the GF acronym next to it. The only thing I could think was the salt & pepper squid, since it is breaded. I asked the waitress and she said it was rice flour. I still felt sick, so when I was paying the bill I asked her again if she was sure NO gluten made it into our meal. She said \\"well the fried rice has soy sauce.\\" I told her it had a GF next to it, and she informed me that with the fried rice it is only gluten free if I request it. I told her that was absolutely ridiculous because nowhere on the menu does it say GF by request, it just says GF next to numerous items. \\n\\nShe apologized when I told her now we get to be sick for the next day and a half, including my poor 2 year old. \\nI know we should not eat out, but I really thought we'd found a place that was careful. I was wrong. Back to no more eating out. \\n\\nThat said, if you are NOT gluten intolerant then the food is really good. The fried rice with pineapple, salt & pepper squid, larb, green papaya salad, salad rolls and chicken satay are all really tasty. The salt & pepper squid was super good. \\nI won't return, only because I have to be so careful. And they are not careful enough. \\nYes, I am one of \\"those\\" people.... and I am afraid most servers/restaurants don't take this quite serious enough. I am not doing this to be a hipster, or be cool, or be healthy. I eat this way because otherwise I feel like shit.

When we got to our lane, we had to wait while the employee kicked people out of our lanes!  They were celebrating a birthday, had the cake up and everything.  So uncomfortable!  You know we're waiting, why would you not clear our space BEFORE we get to the bowling area?  \\nThen they told us our drink coupons (included in the price) could not be redeemed for bowling.  We had to walk across the entire venue to get to the one bar they have.  We could get drink service in the bowling area only if we paid for it (WHY?). Don't get me started on the bar.  The bartenders were working as hard as they could, but they were making drinks for the 50+ people at the (ONLY) bar, plus getting food, and making drinks for people out in the seating areas.  They could not keep up, and once they knew I was using the drink tickets, they did not want to make eye contact, even though I was tipping cash for drinks!  I tipped $5 for 2 beers and a cocktail, I don't think that's being terribly cheap. My friend ended up paying for a well drink I should have gotten for free, because it was just too hard to get them to take our orders if they thought we had the coupons.  People were giving up and walking away from the bar.

The first time I went was on opening weekend. I sampled a number of things that day and was unimpressed - overall everything fell short in execution and flavor.

I also read an interview with one of the owners touting their \\"Montgomery Burns.\\" He was talking about how decadent the ribeye was and how over-the-top the sandwich was. I walked in to Villains today and thought, \\"This is your last chance, hit me with everything you've got.\\"\\n\\nFor those that don't know, the Montgomery Burns is a glorified cheesesteak. It's by far the most expensive item on the menu, coming in at $15. My thought - for $15 this should be a bombastic steak. Not even close. This was the most ordinary, bland and tepid cheesesteak I've encountered. Decadent ribeye? No sir. That meat was colorless, bland and room temperature. It wasn't particularly beefy and certainly underseasoned - I'm guessing it was precooked which is disappointing considering it doesn't take long to cook and caramelize some thinly sliced beef. If someone had told me it was boiled, I wouldn't have known the difference. The cheese wasn't half bad and the bread is pretty good, but that beef? And 15 miserable dollars for a sandwich that is about 8 bucks elsewhere (no sides included either). Forget it.\\n\\nI've also had the Odd Job (KFC) and Kingpig (porchetta) and they both fell flat in the same way. I'm guessing those two weren't just opening week jitters.

The meat portion of the meal is always good but the side dishes are so disappointing.  When you meal is around $17 no tax  you expect to see the value for it.  Frites without sauce or any seasoning other than just salt should only cost a $2-3. A salad with pretty much no dressing is about $1 if you buy it from the store.   Now the Burger was good but we make the same thing (but better) at home for $5 a burger.  That's a meal with a $9 store price at most.  Yet the meal is $17, almost twice the store cost.

Gun to my head, the suadero tacos were my favorite dish of the night -- they don't look like that much, but they just explode in your mouth. I don't know if it's the \\"black magic oil\\" or something they do to the brisket itself, but these were truly amazing.\\n\\nThe chips and salsa were probably next, for me -- unlike any other variations of \\"chips and salsa\\" you'll see, and all the ingredients (from the chips to the salsa to the cheese) were really fantastic.\\n\\nWe loved the goat barbacoa too -- this was probably my wife's favorite dish of the night. The fact that it's third out of four for me is more a statement on the other dishes than on this one. It comes in a similar style as the barbacoa / duck carnitas at Cosme in NYC, with some hot tortillas that you fill yourself. The barbacoa itself was excellent, as were the accompanying sauces. Next time around, I'd be torn on getting this again, just because there are so many other awesome-looking items on the menu, but I'm sure my wife would want to.\\n\\nLast out of the four was the tlayuda, which, again, I really liked, but it just wasn't as incredible as the other three. \\n\\nOverall, amazing food and really great service.

(I had two hamburgers here last year during my initial visit. They were awesome, though I have no idea what overcame me last year during my first trip. I guess that the first one that time really was that good and I couldn't save myself from ordering a 2nd one.) The store is just as I remembered it - nothing at all fancy and with the only seating being along the right wall and down a hallway leading to I'm assuming a restroom and past the kitchen. There's signage everywhere describing the menu items/etc. There's a lot from which to choose (arepas, quesadillas, meat skewers and more), though I doubt I'd ever try anything other than a burger here. I don't eat hamburgers very often (though, oddly enough, I did have one yesterday, too ... so, that's two days in a row ... weird), so if I go somewhere that has a hamburger as its specialty, that's what I'm getting.\\n\\nThe store still serves apple-flavored Postobon soda, which I love.

However, there's usually  street parking around.  \\n\\nEstablishment: The interior is larger than it appears from the outside.  As it goes for HK restaurants, it is relatively modern in style and not the usual hole in the wall or cafe feel. It's kept up fairly well although I didn't check out the restroom (which is, unfortunately, usually a horror story in many Asian restaurants). \\n\\nFood: I tried the Spicy Seafood pasta dish while my friend had a beef steak. Both of these were in the lunch special menu and averaged about $9 each. While the pasta dish was nowhere near what I would call spicy it was still not bad. A bit too saucy for my liking but there was a decent amount of seafood in the dish. My friend said he liked the steak and thought it was tender for a thinly cut piece. Both dishes were filling and more than enough for lunch without going back to work and dozing off from a big carb crash. \\n\\nService: the wait staffs' service is average for a place like this: quick service when you get there, minimal service while you eat, service when they come and get your empty plates at the end.  \\n\\nOverall I'd say a solid three stars or \\"not bad\\" for this place."},{"name":"Tin Shed Garden Cafe","address":"1438 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"headed over here around 10:30 this morning to have brunch with a friend visiting from out of town. not only did we find a parking place in front but we were seated right away.\\n\\nour server was very nice and answered our menu questions initially.

I would have gotten coffee even if I had known that it wasn't free and it wan't terribly expensive ($2.50 I think? I can't remember) but I was sort of irritated. Again, just one tiny complaint.

On Thursday November 2nd, I woke up to two bites on my forearm. I had assumed that these were mosquito bites as I was at Disney the day before. That day, I didn't leave the hotel for even one minute as I was at a conference all day. I ordered room service for dinner and went to bed. On Friday, November 3rd, I woke up to several more red, itchy and swollen bites on my arm- the same arm where the bites from the previous day were and the same arm I happen to sleep on.  (pictures are attached)\\n\\nI went to the front desk to express my concerns of potential bedbugs. They told me they would file a claim and get back to me. Four days later, I got a call that the Ecolab results came back negative for an infestation. They told me that maybe the bites happened in a car or somewhere else or that some bug bites can take up to three weeks to appear. \\n\\nRegardless of what the report says, something was in my room and biting me while in bed at this hotel. The very least that should have been offered was for the hotel to offer to clean/steam my belongings in attempts to kill off whatever bugs were in that room (upon doing much research, I learned that most hotels will offer this if there is a potential for bedbugs). It has been a MAJOR inconvenience to assure that I didn't bring home whatever was in that hotel room. I have a newborn at home and the last thing I would want to do is to expose him to some type of infestation. I read that extreme heat/freezing would kill off any potential bugs/eggs. When I got home, I had to leave my suitcase in the garage and transfer all belongings directly into a garbage bag and directly into my dryer for one hour. I threw away all hygiene items and have items such as shoes/purses/etc that cannot go into the dryer, stuffed into garbage bags in my freezer.  \\n\\nThe hotel has offered to do nothing for the inconvenience and time wasted taking precautions before bringing my belongings in my home.  I certainly was not going to just walk into my home with my belongs that could potentially have an infestation and hope the report would come back negative 4 days later.  \\n\\nPlease check your rooms thoroughly before staying at this hotel."},{"name":"Greek Village Restaurant","address":"3577 Lake Emma Rd, Ste 111","city":"Lake Mary","stars":"4.5","text":"Cute family style restaurant in a strip mall in Lake Mary.

Unwrapping the leaves (after taking it home, of course), I discovered that the inside was filled with sticky rice, beans, cooked mushroom, baby shrimp meat, a miso egg and a small amount of pork, all nestled within this delightful little package.

He gave us our space while reviewing the menu, but it took him quite a while to return and take our beverage and food order.\\n\\nI'm a fan of the large martini menu, so I went with an espresso martini.  It was delicious.  As a side we shared the signature spicy fries.  I was quite impressed with them, thin, crispy, and tasty.  For lunch I had the hummus wrap and a side of corn salad, my friend tried the buffalo chicken tenders.  The hummus wrap was good but not note worthy.  My friend enjoyed his chicken tenders and I stole a crispy edge or two.\\n\\nMoJoe has a great patio and is perfect for people watching.  The prices are fair and there is a great martini menu to choose from.  The service was not outstanding, fortunately we were not neglected like my earlier visit.

The BBQ hasnt changed much since the original. They offer sliced Brisket, Pulled pork, bbq chicken, baby back ribs, and smoked sausage. Most of the changes have been with their sides, offerings that cater to chicks, and desserts. \\n\\nOverall its not bad, but its not the best either.

The food was amazing, the service was good, and the atmosphere was nice.\\n\\nSo, food: we split the tots(?) and they were AMAZING! Crunchy potato on the outside, melted cheese on the inside, and an awesome dipping sauce! What more could a girl ask for? I got the Ko-Jack burger which I thought was pretty good (regular burger with Gorgonzola cheese), and my friend got the beef sliders with sweet potato fries which she definitely enjoyed. The portions were adequate and not overwhelmingly large. And they have chipotle mayo, always an added bonus. My only sadness is that I wasn't entirely impressed by the beer selection, I ended up defaulting  to a blue moon. \\n\\nService: it was decently full, but we were still allowed to pick our seats, which I appreciate. Our waitress was nice and pretty attentive, although we did feel a little rushed at times. I must give her snaps for  getting our entire drink, appetizer and somewhat complicated food order (some substitutions and side things) at once, not writing it down, and getting everything 100%. Maybe I've had too many bad experiences with this, but I find myself always getting prepared for a little let down when I'm normally in that situation ...\\n\\nAtmosphere: lots of young professionals when we were there. It looked like a cool place to grab a drink after work, so that was nice. Music was a little loud though for 6pm, I could barely hear our waitress or even my friend who was sitting across the table.

Bar service was great, and our food - if a little pricey - was all tasty. Nod to the hot chicken - which wasn't at all hot or Nashville style, but was juicy and flavorful.\\n\\nThe comedy of errors began once we - after about 30 minutes of talking - realized they had been calling names - barely audible or recognizable over the PA. We went to check on our spot, to find they had called us - or maybe not - they weren't sure - but they \\"definitely wouldn't skip over us again\\" - asduming they had missed us already.\\n\\nAfter that, we listened extra closely but still couldn't make out any of the names being called. Dudes fix your PA.\\n\\nOnce we got a lane, (and the $30/hour countdown began - lordd charging per hour is gross at a bowling alley, just charge per game! even if you keep a high price! I don't care, I just want to bowl a complete game!), we bowled a frame, which was scored completely incorrectly (strikes when we rolled 6's, etc), our balls got stuck, and we spent about 30 minutes just waiting for a fix, going back and forth to the counter, etc.\\n\\nFinally we asked to switch lanes, were told we'd have to get back in the waitlist for a lane - but eventually they sorted us out without making us wait again.\\n\\nBowling worked, but our server (because we switched lanes, she said) couldn't order us new drinks, or something like that. Well, that's what she said about 30 minutes after we had ordered some. And we ended up getting drinks ourself from the bar.\\n\\nAnd, I can't conclude my list of critiques without mentioning the music. Lord almighty. I'm a white dude.

I don't mind bowling to some \\"carry on my wayward son\\" - it's kind of a given. If you go to a bowling alley, some fratboy looking douchebag will play it. But I prefer my douche tunes interspersed with some Young Dolph or Makonnen thank you very much. In the words of the lady behind the counter after the 4th in a row angsty white dude song about heroin or getting old and having your children leave the house droned on over the PA, \\"I know, I know... this place is DRAGGIN!\\"\\n\\nAll this said, the staff was very nice, the food was well above average, the bowling was a ton of fun when it worked, and we got comped a fair amount for all the trouble. \\n\\n5-star place coming into its own!"},{"name":"Rainbow Butterfly Restaurant","address":"1-2850 Oxford Street","city":"Port Coquitlam","stars":"3","text":"Delicious dim sum with English and Chinese on the menu!!

All I was looking for was to order some wings to go, which I heard were good from reviews on this site.  I went to the bar to order take out and after standing there awhile realized no one was going to help me.  I then went to a table that was being cleared in the bar and the person clearing the table asks me if I wanted to see a menu, which I said yes.  She never returned.  So I went back to the bar and waited for someone to help me.  Finally a bar tender asked me if they cold help which I said yes,  I would like to order food.  She gave me a menu, but never came back.  Another bar tender took my order.  While I waited for my order I thought I would order a Crown Royal on ice. \\n\\nAs it turns out the CR was as expensive as the wings.  It was $8 which normally doesn't bother me, but it does bother me when I pay that kind of money and the shot is measured- I watched them pour it. I am a part time bartender and that kind of money for that kind of pour is just ridiculous.   Maybe they don't allow free pouring here, but for $8 I do expect to get more than 1 oz. \\n\\nNow I am waiting for my wings which seems to be taking forever.  The place was moderately busy.  It was a Sunday night.  Order is taking a long time.  Finally a server, who was walking by and noticed me standing in the pickup area (not the one who took my order) asked me about my order.  I gave my name and he went into the kitchen and came back with the order.  Mind you this wasn't the bar tender I gave the order to.  \\n\\nIn the end, the service was bad, really bad all the way through.  It took three interactions before I could place an order and  no one, except my angel server (who showed up out of nowhere)  seemed to care about my order.

This is our second year at this hotel but we have been to Family Cafe for many years - last year everything was perfect. Not so this year. I am the Director of a non profit organization that trains and employs young adults with intellectual disabilities (www.scentsability.org)  We are a vendor every year at Family Cafe and bring our team with us to showcase the amazing work they do. Prior to our visit I called the Hyatt several times to confirm everything since we were traveling with ten young adults with varying disabilities and I needed to make sure all would go smoothly. Our experience was anything but smooth. We were promised a cot in two of our rooms since all the rooms were sold out and we needed an extra room. I called several times to confirm this information and to make sure that there were still no available rooms. After check-in we called the front desk to ask for the cots to be delivered to the two rooms and were told we were NOT allowed to have cots in those rooms!!! They said the Fire Marshall ruled that no cots were allowed in rooms with two queen beds. Why weren't we told that during the several confirmation calls? We then asked for a supervisor and spoke to Jason - who spoke to his manager Gary. Again told same thing. We are now in Orlando with ten young adults with disabilities and no place for two of them to sleep. We live over 3 hours away. We told Jason about our dilemma and he then finally offered what we thought was a solution. He said he had a room available (?? how did that happen) and it had a king bed, a sofa bed and they could bring in a cot. We were thrilled - thought we had our solution. That is until the evening when it was bedtime and the \\"sofa bed\\" was really just a sofa and not a bed! It did not open up! How deceiving!! The definition per wikipedia of a sofabed is \\"A sofa bed or sofa-bed, (in the US often sofabed, hide-a-bed, bed-couch or sleeper-sofa), is typically a sofa or couch which underneath its seating cushions hides a metal frame and thin mattress that can be unfolded or opened up to make a bed.\\". \\nTHERE WAS NO BED IN THAT SOFA!!! So we are now stuck at 11 pm with two of our young adults forced to sleep on the floor! Nobody should ever be sleeping on the floor of a hotel. Ironically the other rooms that all of a sudden became available had wires all across the floor from two lamps in the sitting area. The wires were dangling from the wall across the floor all tangled and a MAJOR tripping hazard. AND - the lamps did not even work so who knows what was wrong with these wires! How come the Fire Marshall approved that fire hazard but not the cots!!! I have attached a video of the exposed wires. \\nWe had several young adults on the autism spectrum, some with major anxiety disorders, OCD, Downs Syndrome and other varying developmental disabilities. Last minute changes are extremely difficult to process and several of our young adults had severe anxiety and behavior meltdowns ruining their long awaited trip. We work very hard to be able to afford this trip every year and thanks to the misleading information provided by Hyatt staff our trip was ruined. We asked Jason to work with us to split the cost of an extra room and he was not interested in helping us at all. The Hyatt houses this disability convention - you would think the staff would be trained on ADA regulations and issues. \\nMisinformation, rooms that all of a sudden became available when I had called countless times to find another room that could have avoided all these problems, lack of interest by the management staff, and disregard for our special young adults disabilities made this trip a major disaster. Two of our kids had to sleep on the floor - disgusting! Im sure if Jason or Gary's family was staying at the Hyatt they would NEVER be expected to sleep on the floor.

I have stayed in Hyatt hotels where we have literally wanted to purchase the mattress and bedding, so I don't think their beds are exactly the same as other Hyatt hotels. They did say that they rarely get complaints about the beds, so maybe we were just picky. But, I don't consider us picky. Either way, both rooms were very clean and the staff is great, so it makes up for it. The higher the room, the better view you get. We enjoyed the pool view from the 30th floor. It let's you see how awesome this hotel is compared to others around it :)\\n\\nSpeaking of the pool, wow. If you're there to swim and relax, you can't get better. We were there on a busy weekend where three very large conferences were taking place, and it was still easy to find a chair and not too crowded. There is another pool that is quieter, located in a different area of the hotel, but it's not as tropical, so we opted for the busier one just so we could enjoy the scenery. I do wish they reserved one pool for adults only, or at least had an after hours time for adults. We wanted to enjoy the hot tub, but after dark it was always taken over by lots of teens.  Coconuts, the little bar and grill in the pool area has awesome staff and great food and drinks. We had great service from Michelle, one of the bartenders, among many others that weekend. \\n\\nThere were many places within walking distance, but we chose Uber cabs to get around since it was so hot outside! You only pay $4-$7 no matter where you go, so you can't go wrong with that.

As restaurants grow, having consistency can be a big challenge. Taco Deli has it nailed at this location. I hope they note what they are doing here and bring it to their other locations. \\n\\nMy one complaint would be their tortillas could be improved. Taco Flats has nailed their tortillas with a much improved version. You can tell the difference in their taste, warmth, and texture. Taco Deli's, by contrast, feel exactly like HEB tortillas. Taco Deli and Torchy's could make big improvements in this area by upgrading their tortillas.

For a $6 burger I expected a big, fresh made, tasty meat patty but this was far from it. To spice it up, I added some of the garlic cilantro mayo and pineapple sauce. That really helped it out a lot but it didn't make up for the low quality beef. Honestly, I think Five Guys has better quality burgers than these guys.

I have never experienced a dining experience like this before in my time here in Atlanta.  Brunch must be newly added to the restaurant.  It was a busy day. Valet was extremely slow but hey, it's Buckhead so that's not the worse of this Sunday experience.  We called to let the restaurant know we were there but waiting to park.  This was the best of this experience.\\n\\nWe were seated and sat for about 15 minutes chatting and realized we hadn't been greeted by a server. So I asked one of the servers to help us. Hmmm so I'm paying for a meal and I have to ask to place an order.  If we were smart, we would have left there.  A manager approached and apologized for the wait and took care of our drinks.  Later she personally took our food order.  \\n\\nThe food order took some time (it's brunch time and busy) and like the other Sage locations it was delicious.  The craziness started when when we decided it was time to check out. Our checks and cards were gathered for processing.  After 20-30 minutes we realized, she never came back and most people in our area were gone. The manager approached and stated she sat down the cards to get paper for the machine and the cards were gone.  So okay, mistakes happen.  But, no one that has access to that area has seen them?  This isn't the worst of the issue yet.  \\n\\nDuring this time, the only thing was said was we're still looking.  No apologies or let me get more drinks for waiting or anything.  One of my friends even approached the owner and he had nothing to say but that's the manager issue.  Then, went on to say he was too busy to check the cameras.  So, it's good to frequent your restaurant and have a major issue and you don't have time to check the camera.  I guess he'll decide if he can be bothered for the next group of customers he loses because of his lack of customer service skills.  I hate to say, this experience has proven that SAGE ANY LOCATION is off our restaurant tour and I frequent Perimeter and Windy Hill often.

There is a Starbucks located conveniently in the lobby, as well, but the prices charged have about a 25% premium over the usual Starbucks (the closest one is located about 1-2 miles away).\\n\\nI believe this is noted in several other reviews, but if you pay the resort fee ($20 a night), you receive quite a few perks such as parking, TWO free water bottles (usually $3.25, I believe), free Wi-fi (good for up to six devices at one time), free shuttles to and from Disney parks and other amenities that will be listed out for you. Instead of paying for each item individually, it is a much better deal to pay the discounted flat amount.\\n\\nOur room had 2 queen size beds, a couch (not sleepable), a mini-fridge, and a large TV (I can't recall the measurements, but it is more than enough). There are many available TV channels to watch. The beds are comfortable with plush comforters and pillows.

It's walking distance from my apartment and provide the three essentials: food, coffee, and alcohol.  \\n\\nThe spicy fries are great for munching on if you just want a snack to go with your beer.  I also love the Greek pizza, but I miss the Mexican pizza, which they took off the menu recently.  The veggie wrap is a good sandwich, and the triple grilled cheese with tomato soup is also quite tasty.  I've actually never had bad food here, but those are my recommendations.\\n\\nAs far as coffee goes, I tend to go for the basics: regular coffee in the winter, iced in the summer, and Cup o'Joe does both well.  The coffee shop side also has a selection of desserts, which always look good, though I've heard on occasion they aren't always the freshest.  The wrapped cookies and rice crispy treats are always a good bet.  \\n\\nAnd that brings us to alcoholic beverages: MoJoe does a great happy hour, until 8pm during the week.  $1.50 domestic bottles, and $5.00 pizzas, and I think some other specials.  If cheap beer isn't your thing, they make some lovely martinis and specialty drinks, including the best mojitos in Columbus, but I'll only drink them on the patio when it's sunny.  \\n\\nThe vibe here is pretty versatile: lots of students, especially on the coffee side, but you'll see people working on laptops with a beer beside them on the bar side as well.  During the day, there are lots of business types who come in for lunch.  I actually saw the mayor here once, having a lunch meeting with a couple of other men in suits.  At night, you'll see lots of pretty people, sometimes rowdy groups, but more often, pretty laid back ones.  \\n\\nI've occasionally had bad service here, but the servers who stick around are excellent.  It's a little louder than your basic coffee shop, but if you can deal with that, it's a great place to meet some friends or just plug in your laptop and get some work done outside the house.\\n\\nOh, yeah, parking is a pain in this area, but since I walk, I almost forgot to mention it.

My friends ordered a Jalapeno Cheddar Fry after mine came and made sure to order \\"extra cheese\\". Theirs arrived looking like how I was excited for mine to look. Seriously, though...for almost $7, don't skimp on the cheese. If people want light cheese on cheese fries, chances are they don't even want cheese fries to begin with. It just won't ever happen. They're never going to be \\"light\\" fare, so please just let them stay the massive piles of greasy cheese that people order them for.\\n\\n- The music was just AWFUL. I mean, I can't even. When I tell friends back in Chicago what living in Portland is like, I would tell them about the chill diner where you could drink a beer and listen to entire albums by Leonard Cohen, Buffy St. Marie or Zola Jesus. Tonight I think they were using free Spotify or something (an ad played), and it was just wretched. A mix of Rocky Horror, Queen, The Strokes, some unidentifiable pop-punk, the only 2 Cure songs teenagers like, and The Pillows. It was like being in someone's older brother's car while everyone's getting high in 9th grade...except in 9th grade, I'd still be just as pissed about having to listen to such terrible music.\\n\\nOur waiter was really nice and told us that they're trying to keep the memory of the old Dots alive, but that things are gradually going to change and be phased out. I appreciate their concern for regular customers, but can't help but feel like something major is lost in translation. I feel like the music really explains it all- Dots was kind of a divey, artsy, queer sort of diner. I feel like some late 30s business-dudes saw a popular restaurant in a popular area and are probably eventually going to just have it be a standard Portland fancy burger place to cater to all the other late 30s business-dudes who are moving into the Clinton area in the hopes of recapturing their youth and meanwhile making it unaffordable for the people who like good music to live there. I hope I'm wrong. \\n\\nAnyway, don't let this review stop you from supporting them.

Below are the details of why I will not recommend this hotel to anyone in the future:\\n\\nThe Check-In (or lack thereof):\\nWe arrived at 11:00pm on Thursday night (tired and hungry) and after a delay of over 15min were told there were no rooms available for us . . the excuse being \\"we are overbooked, and sometimes this happens\\".  Having booked through Expedia we were not informed in any way of this change to our booking.\\n\\nWe were re-booked for a night at a hotel another 10min drive away, which is a lower level (only 2 star), business class hotel in not great area of town and not remotely comparable to what had been booked (in theory a 4 star).\\n\\nThis should have been a no-brainer for the Taj but we had to negotiate for them to comp the night at the sub-par hotel and to arrange for a taxi for us (it was now 11:30pm, 18 degrees and a 20min walk with luggage . . .needless to say not safe or comfortable walking weather).\\n\\nThe Rooms:\\nUpon returning the following day they had upgraded our room as promised to a park view room, which was appreciated.  However the rooms themselves are tired, dirty and old.  There were toys from the previous guest on the floor (a sure sign the maids were not very thorough), the carpet itself is stained and old, the room lay-out is dated and inefficient, with no proper sitting area, hard to find plugs and tiny bathrooms.  The walls, floors and even curtains were stained and shabby with obvious water damage and peeling wall-paper / paint.  All of the big and little details of luxury expected from a 4 star hotel were missing from the moment you left the lobby.\\n\\nThe Bar:\\nThe bar is a quaint little traditional Boston bar with wood paneling and cozy seating.  The wine is not half bad but steer away from any mixed drinks.  I ordered a traditional manhattan and was given an entire snifter full of bourbon with a few melted ice cubes and a dash of bitters.  It is clear that they are a wine and beer only type of place with none of the expected cocktail skills.\\n\\nThe Aftermath:\\nHaving returned home after the stay I find I have still been charged for all three nights at the Taj, even having only spent two. I am currently working with both Expedia and The Taj to get this remedied.  Adding insult to injury in what was truly a sub-par stay.\\n\\nSo in short this hotel did not come close to living up to the experience, quality or service promised in a 4 Star property and others visiting the area are far better off at one of the many other hotel options in the area."},{"name":"El Patron Mexican Restaurant & Cantina","address":"12167 S Apopka Vineland Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"This was some of the best Mexican food we've ever had, fabulous service, amazing margaritas and incredible food!"},{"name":"Rimsky-Korsakoffee House","address":"707 SE 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"This has been one of my favorite places since I discovered it six years ago.

The mushrooms however, were not what I'll remember most about this dish.  The gnocchi was like nothing I had ever tasted - each piece was soft and smooth and the red pepper filling added that something extra to set it apart.  I struggled mightily at the table to describe it to the Lady, so she tried it and agreed it was delicious.\\n\\nAfter a back and forth struggle with the Chocolate Torte I ended up choosing the Strawberry-Honey Financier, 8 Years Aged Balsamic for my dessert.  Our waiter described it as a something of a parfait served on a light biscuit with strawberries.  It arrived as a parfait served in a perfect cylinder lying down on top of the cracker like biscuit.  The strawberries were very flavorful, but I couldn't get around the shape of the parfait - it looked as if the yogurt had come from the play doh fun factory.  The aged Balsamic was barely present and I actually forgot about it until the Lady said \\"wasn't that the balsamic dessert?\\"  As far as the meal went, this was the only course that didn't blow me away - but it might have been that I was still thinking about the gnocchi.\\n\\nSide note, anyone know how to correctly pronounce gnocchi?  I was mentioning the meal to a co-worker today and she told I was saying it wrong. Is it Nokey or Nyawkey or something completely different?"},{"name":"The Wave... of American Flavors","address":"4600 N World Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Very nice restaurant.

Why?  Because if I come here with my laptop to work on a paper, or bring a book to read, etc. I always get far more done than when I have all the evil temptations of the Internet (e.g. Facebook) to wrestle with.  Besides, if you were some sort of working professional (as opposed to the dime-a-dozen neighborhood student/slacker/hipster) whose livelihood truly depended on it, you would probably bring along your own 3G internet anyhow.  \\n\\nAnd even with the by now well-known lack of free internet, this place is still packed more often than not...can you imagine how much WORSE it would be if they had free wi-fi?  There'd be scores of slackers (not to mention all the unruly high school kids who currently plague the Somerville Public Library for this reason) here buying a lousy $4-5 drink and hogging tables all day long. \\n\\nAnyways, this is an attractive place with a nice vibrant energy, good for people watching if you like that, or simply chilling and reading a book or working on your Great American Novel if that's your thing.  The coffees and teas are not cheap but good (although a bit small compared to the larger sizes available at Starbucks), and the food is your usual overpriced organic salads and sandwiches and pastries...CARB CITY, in other words, so I have never bothered with any of that.  If you do, my advice is keep your expectations modest.  \\n\\nYou are basically paying for the space and the vibe, which are excellent for the aforementioned purposes.  There are times when they play rather aggressive and intrusive music, alas, but that's why you should always have a pair of earbuds around to plug into your laptop, tablet or smartphone.  \\n\\nAll in all this is a unique and charming place...am glad that it exists.

We always get the platters (or are they dinners?) and not wraps, but I can't imagine that the food suffers when wrapped in their pita, which has just the right amount of tug and flavor.\\n\\nSometimes I think this place just blows most other cheap eats nearby out of the water because they, quite simply, use enough garlic. But that's not really doing them justice. They use enough garlic and do everything else right as well. Plus, they are friendly when we go in to pick up. \\n\\nOh. Wait.

The owners aren't doing anything wrong or outlandishly to seclude anyone or making any discriminatory references. Their name was explained in the papers when they first opened and it is just so happened to be a coincidence. I do not hold this against them. \\n\\nI came here for the Crafters' event and have to say that the staff is incredibly sweet. I do have to say that this location is definitely targeting a different audience. It's much cleaner than Diesel. The atmosphere seems a bit more contemporary rather than artsy. They have photographs hanging along their walls. The bathroom is actually clean! \\n\\nAlthough, for me the downside is that they have all this space, but they aren't really utilizing it. Where are the couches around here? I feel like it is a bit colder in here because they are so minimalistic, but maybe that's because they're still new. I hope they add some couches and make it more homey feeling, especially since they have the brick walls to help accentuate it. I'm not too sure how I feel about the bank vault. Although, I've seen a few people sitting in there, it just seemed kinda awkward to me. But I guess I will have to give that try the next time I come here. \\n\\nI also like the fact that they also have another serving bar built in towards the back, for overflow that hasn't yet happened maybe? I hope they will eventually utilize it. It's a certainly a great idea. I'm hoping to see Bloc 11 strive, as I see great potential here! They don't have it quite yet, but they will.

Not a good hotel for business travelers. They have a nice pool and even nicer children's pool set up like a mini theme park. The rooms are nice but 1/2 of them only have interior balconies overlooking the atrium. This means you get noise traveling up from the ground floor and very little natural light. Some of the staff is extremely helpful and some not so much which can be expected at most hotels. The first part of my trip was for pleasure and I was really happy with the service and the hotel in general. In fact, if I left after that part of the stay I probably would've given the quality and service Excellent rankings. The business part of my stay however was terrible. The only business office they have is attached to the FedEx in the resort. This means they charge you $0.55 a min for internet and .25 per page to print. I also had a package delivered that they charged my $20 to receive. I didn't find this out until after I checked out. It annoys me to be nickle and dimed to do simple business transactions at an already expensive resort especially as a platinum member of Marriott. If you are traveling on business there are plenty of other hotels in the area that will happily cater to your needs. If you have children and are looking for a resort this place isn't half bad.

Real dancers should get there early and dance the early sets before the hordes of stomp swayers with drinks in hand clog the dance floor like a zombie horde.  The waitress should get combat pay and a medal for being able to serve when the joint gets jumpin.

Cathay center on the other side of town sets the high end of the standard.   If only cathy pacific could borrow a cook and bartender from Cathay center.

Walking into Casey's is like a time-warp; with about eight seats at the counter, seating is limited, and the option of grabbing your meal from the take-out window is available too. Hot Dogs and Burgers are the focus here, and you can smell them a mile away. But I'm a burger guy (shocking I know) and only having a few minutes to eat, I was carefully instructed to order a burger with onions cooked into the patty, and don't forget about the bacon. What they do to the onions and bacon is what makes this burger; reminiscent of White Hut, it's all about the crust, the grease and the simplicity, the beef is not the star but it really doesn't matter.\\n\\nIt's a small burger and it costs around $3, but they don't serve fries, so if you're looking to be stuffed you'll probably have to order a couple of burgers or one of their signature hot dogs, the choice is yours. The bacon is carefully chopped and pressed into the patty, so you end up with bits of bacon running throughout the burger and that makes me happy. The onions are essentially treated the same way; chopped up and encased into the patty. Both condiments give the burger a fantastic crunch to an already crispy burger, all because it's cooked on a griddle that probably hasn't been cleaned in about thirty years. But that's not a bad thing, it's a greasy delight that fancier burger joints can't claim.\\n\\nOf course, there us such a thing as too greasy, and the Casey's Burger is borderline too greasy. It's that tricky play on \\"juiciness versus greasiness,\\" as a novice burger enthusiast might mistake an ungodly amount of grease as one juicy burger, this one falls somewhere in the middle. The bun is a very standard white grocery store bun that is ever so gently kissed by the griddle, giving it a small amount of crunch. Melted American Cheese is obvious but it melts perfectly, thus adding another layer of creaminess and fat. The beef is ordinary, but for $3 does it really matter? The unique crust via the bacon and onions are extraordinary, and enough to make a trip to Casey's Diner more than worthy.

No complaints. But tonight! I was highly disappointed. Usually when I bowl, a server comes over in a reasonable time and asks my party would we like to order. Not tonight. I had to get my food and drink from the bar. When I got the bar, no one acknowledged me. I said excuse me to the bartender and she ignored me. I said it louder and she said \\"yes.\\" Not \\"what can I do for you\\" or \\"how can I help you.\\" I said \\"is the bar closed or something?\\". She said \\"no.\\" She said \\"what you want to order something?\\" I shook my head furiously like yes that's why I am inquiring. So instead of stopping to take my order, she has an obviously inexperienced trainee come take my order. To even place the order took several minutes because she was unfamiliar with the menu and portal. But my qualms are not with her, she tried her best without any real guidance.  So after going back and forth to the bar to check on if my food was ready and squandering sometime in my bowling hour, someone in my party noticed that the people in the section across from us had been served. So we asked when our server would come to our table. He replied \\"I don't know. This is not even my section. Let me go get her.\\" 20 minutes later she arrived to take a simple order for fries. 45 minutes into our wait we informed a manager of the poor service and that we did not get any fries. 1 hour and 20 minutes later and no fries,  we had to complain again to the manager in which he promptly went to get fries from the kitchen. During that time, someone else got up and went to the bar instead of waiting for a bartender. The manager did give us three hour long game cards for our troubles which we appreciated. But we just wanted service, not free stuff. We did not see the server again until it was time to leave. She happened to be coming out with a plate of fries for other customers.

There are about a bazillion TVs and you can find every game on here. There is so much going on that its sensory overload for me. I had a difficult time keeping up with the games because my attention was drawn every which direction. Not only were the number of TVs a distraction but this place is great for people watching. I believe the capacity posted at the front is like 600 something. Yes, 600. This place is huge. Somehow I always get seated in the dining area that is closest to the restroom. People are constantly walking back and forth and my attention wanders. If people watching is your thing this is a great place to do it. \\n\\nSince this place does seat so many people be prepared for noise. It is super loud in here...so loud that its difficult to have conversation. But with so much going on I don't think this is really the place you come for great conversation about anything other than sports. I have seen a ton of kids here which is sort of surprising since it is a sports bar but then again its located smack in the middle of Brookhaven. \\n\\nNow, on to the food. It's not the great. I have had a salad in which they left off half the ingredients on accident. I could have easily made the same salad at home for a fraction of the cost. I had the nachos. Not impressed with those either. They were just so so. The nacho portion is huge so this is a great option if you want to share with the table. I shared with two other people and there were still some left. I sampled the burger my hubby ordered. I believe it was the Makers Mark. It was decent. Burger is a decent size but the side of tater tots that accompanied it was weak. Plus service isn't all that great either. It's slow but most people probably don't notice because their attention is pulled in so many other directions. \\n\\nI'm sure we will keep coming back since the location is convenient for us (even though parking can be a nightmare) and my sportsfanatic husband loves it here."},{"name":"Volcano Sushi & Grill","address":"1991 E Hastings Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"I know there are a lot of places in Vancouver to eat sushi but this place kicks ass hard.

I read some of the reviews and decided to give it a try! Met a friend of mine for an early dinner. I got there first. The hostess was on the phone when I walked in and the lady on the other end was apparently chewing her ear off because I stood there for about 5 minutes before she finally hung up the phone (\\"Call about 30 minutes before you come in to put your name down...Yes we have space for that many...Let's see...we can fit about...[looks around the restaurant]...\\"). To be honest I felt a little put off by that, but luckily the rest of the experience was entirely positive. \\n\\nThe space is awesome and the restaurant has a great atmosphere. It can fit a ton of people and got real crowded while we were there, but it didn't feel crowded or too loud (which can really make or break the experience).\\nThey have you order your food like your at a sushi restaurant which is kind of a neat idea. They also have a card system (if you need something from your waiter, you slip a dragonfly card up on a stand and they come over), which is also a neat idea but totally unnecessary because our waiter at least was incredibly attentive. We didn't use that system once. \\n\\nHere's what we ordered:\\nChips & Guac: (read on another review that they're generous with the guac and I have to say I disagree...pretty standard amount and for $9 kind of pricy). The guac is delicious, just white onion and chunky avo. The chips rock. They give you 4-5 full tortillas that are salted to perfection. I've never seen that before!\\nTacos: baja fish, portobello, tuna tatako, shrimp 'bahn mi', pork belly.\\n\\nA different waiter delivered us two plates that looked like it was our order, but turned out to be incorrect. Our waiter found the correct order immediately and let us keep the four tacos that had been delivered first (BONUS)!

We also tried the beef short ribs appetizer.  The short ribs are marinated overnight, thinly sliced, and grilled.  They were much better than we expected.  We then tried the spicy conch roll, key west roll, godzilla roll and kodiak roll.  All of them were delicious and the fish was very fresh.

Tonight, we were meeting my in-laws driving in from Amarillo and just as tradition, we were going to meet at The Texican! The food has always been great and it's become a tradition for us. My wife and I were very excited for the delicious fajitas! \\n\\nHowever, tonight was the last time we will ever attend. \\n\\nWe arrived at 7:30 and were told there was a 30 minute. However, the host said if we see a table in the bar or outside on the patio, then grab it! So we waited about 15 minutes, saw a table outside, and grabbed it.\\n\\nFrom that point, our experience went downhill. Not exaggerating, we waited 20 solid minutes before we were ever acknowledged. No water, no chips or salsa, no drink order, nothing! When we finally got a drink order in, we waited another 15 minutes for the drinks to arrive. By this time, we so hungry that that I had to stop the waiter from running away and say that we have to order! We got the order in (thank god) which came out wrong with 2 of our 4 orders. We never saw the server again and we were so hungry that we just decided to just eat and deal with it.  \\n\\nIt was obvious that this was a bad experience so I wanted to let a manager know about what had happened. I went to the host stand and said I would like to talk to a manager. She said \\"Well, that's the owner standing right there, would you like to talk to him?\\" I said \\"Absolutely!\\" I would think that him above anyone would love to hear about this!\\n\\nThe \\"owner\\" reluctantly approached and I told him that we had dined here multiple times (30 at least) and today was disappointing. I told him that I ever received a plate for my fajitas and I had to use my napkin as a plate! Trust me, I was upset about this too but I thought I would tell the owner! His response: \\"Hey, you need to shut up! I don't believe you! There is no way you ate off your napkin!!\\" \\nI said \\"Sir, I would love to show you my napkin(plate) where I just ate dinner!\\" He said \\"you are a liar and I don't want you ever to come back here!\\" I said \\"I have been here so many times and have loved your food and it really sucks that you just told me to never come back.\\" He walked away and that was that. \\n\\nI returned to my table and my family defeated. Because we were on the patio, I saw the owner walk out of the front door. I said \\"Sir, I would love to show you my napkin (plate) since you don't believe me!\\" He kept walking. \\n\\nWe watched as he got into his Range Rover, or Land Rover, honestly I can't afford either one of those and can't tell the difference between the two.

I know the owner is hard to deal with, but I'm sorry. The owner just TEXT me and wanted to apologize!?!?!\\" What?!?! Seriously?!?! This guy is in his Range Rover, I can see his car running, and this is how he deals with it?? Ugh......\\n\\nI know this was a long review but jut wanted to get it out there.

Couldn't beat a cheap glass of house wine with the sun full out on a Saturday afternoon. \\n\\nMy wife ordered the Potato & Corn soup and I ordered the Scallop Waldorf salad as my starter. I usually don't like waldorf salads as the mix of sweet and savory usually isn't my cup of tea but this dish was really well balanced substituting scallops instead of chicken which was a nice, light starter. The soup however was out of this world and was served table side with the broth being poured separately (I'm a sucker for that) over a medley of fresh corn and what looked to be fried onions. The broth was rich without being heavy and the onions provided a nice contrast in texture and flavor. That's definitely something I'll be having again. \\n\\nFor mains, the missus had the pan roasted trout with leeks and potatoes while I had the smoked duck leg with lentils and pickled radishes. \\n\\nOf the fish that my wife was willing to share with me, it was moist with a really nice creamy mustardy kind of sauce that complimented all the veg and potatoes. It gave me a bit of a German vibe and was just a great all around dish. Luckily the portion was so large she couldn't finish and I ended up having a bit more at the end. \\n\\nAs for my entree, the duck was AMAZING! and honestly a steal at $18?!? There really aren't many places you can get a meat entree for under $20 bucks these days and you get a full thigh and leg portion here. It was smokey and tender and crispy and had a separate jus/gravy which you could pour over the meal (again nice to be able to control that aspect of the meal as some like it drenched in sauce while I like it portioned out) and mix with the lentils. The radishes were nice and sharp and sour which provided a nice balance to the rich duck meat. \\n\\nDespite being close to stuffed, we decided to gamble on dessert as well and we were not disappointed. We ordered a chocolate earl grey cake and lemon meringue pie expecting your run of the mill slice of each but what came out looked like a work of art. Both came deconstructed with different components but when eaten together came together to create a delicious flavour profile. \\n\\nThe chocolate cake had a moist chocolate cake base with a creamy panna cotta, early grey jelly and the most delicious orange sorbet that I've ever had in my life. The missus remarked that it was like eating 'pure orange' melting in your mouth. I'm not normally a fan of the chocolate/orange combination but this changed all that. This is honestly up there compared to any dessert that I've had in any restaurant in Vancouver, no lie. \\n\\nAs for the lemon meringue pie, it came out with two kinds of meringue (dehydrated and charred), blueberries, lemon curd, thin cookies for the crust, lemon/lime sorbet which all honestly looked like a painting. I was a little worried as sometimes these types of desserts look better than they taste but honestly all the different components again only enhanced the experience.\\n\\nAll in all, it was a fantastic meal with really great service throughout. It felt like fancy restaurant with the decor, the service and the presentation of the food but it was still extremely affordable with the price range closer to an earl's/cactus club type level. I'd come back here for special occasions, dinner or even just a coffee and dessert to watch the sunset. \\n\\nI'll definitely be back and look forward to what they come up with from season to season."},{"name":"The Busy Bee Cafe","address":"810 Martin Luther King Jr Dr SW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Man, this place is so on point!!

I knew exactly what I wanted and seeked out this place, and from the name it sold its self I didn't even bother to read the reviews. (I kinda expected the service to be bad since its a Chinese resturant...sorry no offense but this is my personal experience. I gotta say I'm use to it and expecting it)\\n\\nIt took them about 15mins to get back to me after I  seated myself. I ordered the roasted duck congee, she left came back with some tea. After another 15mins she came back to tell me the roasted duck wasn't ready or available. Ok that's fine, I'll picksomething else. I already had a plan B, but before I could open my mouth like a flash the waitress was gone. Ok, this time I dont care who took my order I just want it! I'm sick, I'm wet, and I'm hungry! So I flagged down another waitress and order the Steamed chicken Congee. 5mins later it appeared, steaming and simply appetizing. It was PERFECT! Silky smooth, light in flavor, and the chicken was steamed perfectly too! Not over cooked yet it tore of the bone easly. Flavor was delicate and not too fatty even with the skin still on. \\n\\nI wish I lived in Vancouver so I could come back and try all the other combination of Congee thats offer here. Although this lovely soup is not for everyone some find it boring or bland. I absolutely LOVE for that fact! SO simple you can pair it with other more flavorful side dishes. It settles well and sustains you for a long time, being sick it goes down easy too.

It really adds something special and exciting to Commercial Drive for me and it is one of a kind. While we were there they were playing a dvd of Rocket Robin Hood which I used to watch as a kid so it warmed my heart a little more. The only downside is that I went a week previous and they had a lot of awesome games. When I returned on Friday they had disappeared (I checked all the other tables to make sure). Don't know if they were stolen or taken off the shelf for some reason but I hope they get more. Build Your Own Eldergod was quickly becoming a favourite of mine.

The staff was very friendly and, I felt, attentive (my husband felt like the service was a bit slow, but I didn't have a problem with it for a special occasion meal). I ordered the \\"Sweet and Spicy\\" drink, a combo of ginger beer and blood orange juice, which was delicious and my favorite part of the meal. The bread was also very tasty.\\n\\nThe so-sos: Pretty much all of the food. We ordered the baked brie appetizer. Although the fruit compote was good (it tasted like the inside of a fruit pie) the brie itself was nothing special. We were brought a small tasting sample of something with pineapple and peppers that mostly tasted like a mouthful of straight salsa. My husband ordered the duck and felt like it was okay but not great and a bit overcooked. I got the burger, which promptly fell apart as soon as I picked it up, so I ended up eating it with a knife and fork. The burger was pretty good but I'd been looking forward to the paprika aioli and could barely taste it. We ordered the \\"chocolate decadence\\" for dessert which, again, was okay but not amazing. The best part was some kind of sauce that was smeared on the plate.\\n\\nThe not goods: The sweet potato fries that came with my burger were just strange. They had a decent flavor but the texture was dry and mushy, almost like they were reconstituted from potato paste or something.\\n\\nSo overall, I'd say our experience wasn't objectionable, but it's probably not something we'd go out of our way to repeat, especially given the price."},{"name":"Tin Shed Garden Cafe","address":"1438 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Tin Shed has wonderful food, a great atmosphere and a fun menu.

Also known as \\"longevity noodles\\", this is dish is known for being easy to eat because of the soft nature of the noodles. As expected, there's not much flavour in this dish but that's usually to be expected for this type of dish.\\n\\nThe dim sum dish that I was expecting to have a bit more flavour was the Truffle Siu Mai. Unlike the ones at Chef Tony, there wasn't much truffle essence detectable in these large and plump dumplings.\\n\\nOne of my favourite dim sum dishes is the Chinese Donut Rice Roll. True to form, the Chinese donut inside the velvety rice roll was nice and crunchy giving a good textural contrast with each bite.\\n\\nFor the most part, I enjoyed the Steamed Tripe with Special Sauce. I did, however, find that some of these honeycomb tripe pieces were more tendony than I usually enjoy.\\n\\nLast up was the Steamed Beef Balls.

The ambiance is really nice inside the restaurant, you can see the chef making your pizza and fresh pasta right before eyes. The 3 of us shared the margherita, prosciutto and ricotta pizzas.

My truck will not be able to squeeze by the little car coming through the lot. So I pulled into the parking lot far enough to be out of the street, then waited for the little car to go by. But it didn't. It backed up. Looking over, I realized that the SUV in front of me (and slightly to my left) was backing up. About this time my friend and I both noticed that some people sitting in Thai Ginger were admiring my truck and watching the soon-to-be fiasco taking place (we shall call them the Trio). The SUV was having a hard time pulling out of its spot (did I mention this parking lot is COMPACT?), so I pulled forward into the loading zone in front of Thai Ginger, allowing more space for him to back out. By this time I realized the small car had disappeared so I would be next in line for the spot. Score! As the SUV was pulling out (it took them a VERY long time), I noticed another car had come in off the street and was behind me, blocking the sidewalk and my ability to back up. The SUV pulled out, and the little car pulled right into my spot. By this time the Trio was no longer admiring my truck, but instead laughing at my predicament. I was a bit frustrated with the impostor car (as it shall be referred to from here on). As I was pulling through the lot, SUV #2 decided to pull out, so I stopped to wait. Meanwhile, the lady in the impostor car was out of her vehicle, walking around it like a crazy woman, throwing her purse back in, acting confused, and pointing around at God-only-knows-what. She wasn't upset with me or even addressing me. I don't' know what she was doing. It was odd.\\n\\nAnyways, the Trio was still laughing and watching me wait for SUV #2 to pull out. After about a 12 point turn, SUV #2 got out of the spot and I pulled right in. 5 minutes to get into a parking lot with three people making fun of your predicament...I hoped it was worth it.\\n\\nAnd it was. A few years ago, I swore off Papa Murphy's because every time I went I either got sick or was sadly disappointed with the quality of pizza. Not anymore. I don't know if it's just this particular Papa Murphy's (because the one I swore off was the one on Lombard), or if it's just that they've gotten a lot better, but I am lovin' my Murphy.\\n\\nThey have this new Chicken Bacon Artichoke DeLITE that is to die for. It's sooooo good. And only $7.99 for a large!!! Chicken, garlic, artichoke, bacon, spinach, all on a thin crust....can someone say \\"MMMMM!!!\\"? I can. Even the finicky teens I brought some of this to liked it. The pepperoni is good too. My tummy's still full.\\n\\nThe service was super great. Very friendly, and the place was nice and clean. Don't forget to say hi to my friend Whitney. She's a sweetheart and kept us occupied with conversation while we waited for the pizzas.\\n\\nThree pizzas richer, my friend and I walked back out to my truck, praying to God that the lot wouldn't be so full, and that the Trio was no longer sitting in Thai Ginger, fully prepared for more laughing.\\n\\nAs I pulled out of the not-quite-as-full parking lot, I looked over just as one of the Trio noticed we had returned...they started laughing."},{"name":"Ginger Exchange Symphony","address":"250 Huntington Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Had a great weekday lunch here today.

Otherwise... \\n\\nFirst of all, don't order from here midweek. Seriously, for whatever reason, food ordered here midweek is dry, tasteless and frequently burnt. It's like they cook everything fresh on the weekends and then store and reheat leftovers for the rest of the week. \\n\\nAlso, don't eat in. The atmosphere in this place is a tad creepy. I've had closets larger than the dining/pick-up area of this restaurant, but they somehow manage to fit in no less than 6 security cameras. It lends an unsafe air to the place that makes me wonder why they feel like they need all those cameras. I can't help but expect a group of Triad heavies to walk in and get blasted through the window by the pixie-haired cashier girl and the sawed-off shotgun she has hidden behind the counter. \\n\\nOne day, as I waited for my food, I noticed a large cardboard box on the floor of the kitchen (which is fully visible from the closet-sized dining area). The box was heavily stained with grease from the bottom up most of the way. When I looked to see why, I realized it was because it was full of chicken fingers, which had obviously already been fried and were simply waiting for someone to order them. I, fortunately, had not made that mistake, and never will. \\n\\nThere are more little things, like the fact that they only seem to have one cutting board and one cleaver for cutting everything and that I once saw an empty pony keg-sized barrel of MSG sitting in the trash outside which all add up to a generally off-putting view of the restaurant, which is only dispelled by the taste and convenience. \\n\\nOverall, the food is still pretty tasty and definitely fills the Chinese food craving when I get it. But if I can wait, I'll put it off until I can make it to Davis Square and can get to Dragon Garden. The food there is better, and at least their equivalent to the cardboard box full of chicken fingers is hidden behind a wall so I can pretend it's not there."},{"name":"Westerville Grill","address":"59 S State St","city":"Westerville","stars":"4","text":"Just left this place.

But this piece of heaven on earth literally melted in my mouth. The porcini reacted with an already generous cut of niman flat-iron steak and produced a marvelously sumptuous delightful culinary nirvana. The steak was tender, juicy, , and perfectly medium rare. Combined with a glass of A to Z \\"Chemin de Terre\\", Blend, Oregon '06the cow could have jumped over the moon and I would still be eating. Another order please! Sadly, the fries were over salted, but the ramps aioli was very earthy and delicious.\\n\\nCrepes--Zellwood corn crepes, florida blueberry compote, vanilla ice cream.\\n\\nI did not really feel the crepes. They were a little on the thick side and just a tad under cooked. The blueberry compote was great with ice cream.

He was very knowledgeable on the menu and was just the right level of attentive throughout our meal. \\n\\nIn terms of the food, it was great. We were started off with some sourdough bread, which definitely fit the Pacific Northwest vibe of the restaurant. Artist Point also has a  special water filtration system, so those of us that had water were served that free of charge. Since ice is not filtered in the same manner, the water was served chilled, but not with ice. \\n\\nFor an appetizer, I had the crab cake which was my favorite part of the meal. High on crab and beautifully presented. I had the vegetarian entree, which was a lo mein with tofu. It was good, but a little salty for my personal taste, I believe from the broth. My entire party was too full for dessert, but Izzy let us celebrate our \\"un-birthdays\\" and brought us the berry cobbler to share!! It was delicious, with just the right amount of tart and sweetness!\\n\\nOverall, a fantastic meal and a restaurant I would love to visit again."},{"name":"The Pool Hall","address":"30 Irby Ave NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"So they don't have pool tables anymore which sucks if you came here to play pool but they did redesign the place so it's nice looking and clean and the drinks are cheap and the bartender, I think her name is Corrine was the sweetest person.

I ordered the breakfast club sandwich, and the chicken itself was perfectly fried and juicy, but unfortunately the waffles were slightly soggy.  My better half had the chilaquiles which was also decent but not outstanding. We also split an order of tator tots, which actually might have been the best thing that morning.

We got there around 3pm for the 4pm game and the place was packed. I had come to late to get a seat, so I ended up going to another local sports bar to watch Colombia put the smack down. I decided to come back to La Casona the next day, and I am glad I did. I started off with some of the natural juices they had. The mora and maracuya juices were great. We then ordered our meals not knowing the portions that were about to come our way. The food was fantastic, there were no complaints from anyone at our table. The portions were enormous!! I had no idea that a restarurant could  make money selling a meal that big at those prices. It really makes me wonder how much these chain restuaraunts are making on each meal they sell.

Suerte is the currently hot & new place to dine at so naturally I found myself there on a Saturday evening around 830PM. Bonus is there is complimentary valet however also street parking if needed. I was told there was a wait of 45 mins to upwards of 1 hour but we actually probably only waited 35 mins, which was awesome. During your wait, a lovely staff member does offer a drink menu + brings em' to you, BONUS. \\n\\nI did start with a watermelon rose sangria, which was delicious. Its super refreshing and light.  \\n\\n2/2 - Food\\n1. We started with the aquachile prawns, and the ceviche. The aquachile prawns were out of this world. The prawns were fresh, and the chili sauce was full of flavor and depth. Next, the ceviche was good but it wasn't anything to write home about. The sauce was mild and did not overpower the fish which was lovely, it was more modern ceviche versus your yams + corn one. Our entrees included the  green chorizo tlayuda (white bean refrito, quesillo, almond, pumpkin seeds) and the suadero tacos (confit brisket, black magic oil, avocado salsa cruda). The tlayuda + tacos were MAGICAL. The tlayuda was crispy, refreshing with all the greens. The brisket was soft, tender kickin' with flavor. \\n\\n0.5/1 - Value \\nEverything was priced appropriately however I felt that a $16 ceviche deserved more than 4-6 pieces of fish. While the ceviche was ok, I would skip out on it for the price point. \\n\\n2/2- Service \\nService was phenomenal. The hostess did seem a bit overwhelmed with the amount of people coming in for a table though. Our server, Jackie, cute as a clam, gave the best recommendations. After our apps, we ended up waiting approximately 20-30 mins for our food, which is quite long. Jackie handled it, and the manager, Aaron, came over and spoke to me about it. He ended up comping our entrees, which to me went above and beyond. \\n\\nOverall, it was just a positive experience. 100% one of the best restaurants I've been to in Austin, and I'll definitely be back again. \\n\\nHappy eatings!"},{"name":"Miel Brasserie","address":"510 Atlantic Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Service and the  view are excellent.

Dot's is friendly and chill, with a divey sensibility that seems to fit just right wherever your evening may be going, be you looking for something low-key, someplace to recharge, or someplace happening and fun. With its big tables and spacious booths, it can accommodate groups really easily, but its lighting and decor makes it feel far cozier than most places of its size.\\n\\nFrequently when I go to Dot's, I go for simplicity--a tallboy of cheap Mexican beer with a wedge of lime and some salt, for example, or perhaps a G&T. But their cocktail menu, while not exactly fancy, has a number of neat options that I'm quite partial to as well. Of note is La Cruda, which is dangerously refreshing considering the amount of tequila it contains (the cucumber and Aperol are a great combination!), and also their cardamom whiskey sour, which is a cool variation on a standard I love. I can also vouch for their Irish Coffee--it's quite the pick-me-up.\\n\\nDot's serves good bar food food late, cheap, and in huge quantities. The menu is massive! I'd recommend the black bean nachos, which are smothered in melted cheese, beans, chopped jalape√±os and onions, sour cream, and guacamole. Messy and delicious. Edamame are a nice option here, too, if you're looking for something salty and snack-worthy, but not majorly filling. \\n\\nThis place is very easy to love. The vibe seems to always fit your night, the drink menu can satisfy nearly anyone with its divey simplicity and Portland creativity, and the food appeals to vegans and omnivores alike, whether they eat like birds or pigs.

I don't know if you'll end up liking it, but it's an experience you need to have, if you know what I mean. I personally enjoyed it - it kind of reminded me of the house parties with all sorts of eccentric people that I used to go to in college, but with ice cream and low conversation instead of loud indie music and Pabst Blue Ribbon. \\n\\nSo you might have some trouble actually finding Rimsky-Korsakoffee since it's literally just a house, but once you rock up and get inside there shouldn't be too much of a crowd. Make sure to bring cash as they don't take cards. The dessert my boyfriend and I shared (I believe it was a brownie sundae?) was really nothing to write home about. There will be plenty to look around at while you eat/drink, which was the main point of the experience, for me at least. The whole place has a really cool ambiance - kind of unearthly.

What I ordered:  The steak was perfectly seasoned and prepared, the vegetable side was crisp and flavorful, and those fries - wow - delicious!  The other dish ordered at my table (tacos) were reported to be very good, as well.  The only errors were that the waitress forgot to substitute the fries for salad in the taco dish, which she promptly corrected, and that she brought out regular Coronas instead of the Corona Lights I ordered, which I really didn't care about.

We arrived 9 am on Christmas Day, and were promptly checked in.\\n\\nLocation: Superb! Directly opposite the convention centre, and just a few minutes away from Universal by cab. International Drive is teeming with restaurants and attractions - including \\"the world's largest entertainment Mickey D's\\", not that we're fans, but just saying ;-) \\n\\nRoom: Panoramic city view from the 27th floor - overlooking the lakes, we could see as far as Universal Volcano Bay and Epcot! Some furniture pieces e.g. desk & chest of drawers were a tad dated and (gently) worn. The bathroom was a dream, with loads of toiletries right down to after-sun gel & terry slippers.\\n\\nService: Unparalleled hospitality throughout the humongous resort! Thumbs up to Jarline (housekeeping), as well as the numerous staff members we encountered in the club room, lobby, bell service & valet.\\n\\nRegency club: Extensive gourmet breakfast offerings (continental & hot dishes e.g. omelettes & quesadillas), all-day snacks & beverages, delectable evening dessert.  Loved the festive iced cookies on Christmas night! The pre-supper hors d'oeuvres were substantially filling. Overall, it was a tranquil place to retreat, away from the chaotic scenes at the theme parks. Bonus: spectacular views from the 26th floor!\\n\\nAmenities: Terrific! Vast array of onsite restaurants, multiple pools adjacent to both towers (heated, resort-style & lap) , hard-court tennis court, fantastic gymn with steam rooms.\\n\\nConclusion: For a four-star establishment, this hotel exceeded expectations.\\n\\nTips:\\n- Regency club is undoubtedly worth the upgrade! It certainly makes economic sense for 2+ travellers.\\n\\n- Request a room with a view before you arrive - regency club rooms occupy the high floors in tower 2.\\n\\n- Check out Fiorenzi Italian Steakhouse at the hotel.

I can afford it, it is just that I am opposed to plastic bottles, I felt like I was being squeezed.

Also staff was awesome and friendly but a bit unknowledgeable and/or inexperienced and/or worried about being open during the aftermath of Irma.\\n\\nStaff was great tho! Don't get me wrong. Just...hesitant. Place is welcoming and inviting and has a great low light ambience. We chose to sit at the bar as this was an impromptu visit after the hurricane because we missed our anniversary and couldn't really make reservations. Was not dissapointed!\\n\\nSat down at the bar- ordered a sidecar and both bartenders struggled to know what it was. Don't worry, Miguel MORE than makes up for it later! Recipe found and an overly sweet sidecar arrives for both my boyfriend and I. We already know we're doing apps and small plates instead of the full-on steak dinner, and peruse the menu. Miguel was honest and helpful while we asked questions- something I loved. He mentioned he wasn't a lamb fan and so couldn't tell us if the lamb was a worth it or not, but recommended other dishes. I love that he was so honest without steering us away from something we might enjoy even if he didn't personally.\\n\\nDecided on the carpaccio and ravioli to start. OMG the carpaccio. I would eat this as my final meal. Toast points have crusty melty cheese on it, the sauce is to DIE for, and it was seriously perfection. The mushroom ravioli was super tasty but nothing to die for. \\n\\nWe then gave our personal wine preferences to Miguel and he came out with three great wines. I only said I like \\"peppery\\" reds and he gave me a taste of an amazing Zin. My boyfriend mentioned liking pinot noirs and having spent time in Willamette valley, and Miguel pulled TWO Willamette valley pinots. \\n\\nDecided on shrimp and scallops with cheesy grits and lamp chops next. \\nGET. THE. LAMB. CHOPS. \\nComes with a carrot-pepper mash and this amazing orange-shoyu sauce that I would literally do shots of. \\n\\nEnded the night with a port recommendation AND a sparkling wine recommendation from Miguel that we were both pleased with, alongside the creme brulee. Comes with a whole bowl of chantilly cream. So effing delicious.\\n\\nFleming's was an amazing experience especially considering most places in orlando were not ready to cater to frustrated orlandians after Irma!!!

I've had a lot of their food but my staples are their Greek Chef salad, spanikopita, chicken pie, and my favorite, skordalia. \\n\\nThe Greek Chef is great - it's a standard Greek salad but has gyro meat on top. The feta is delicious, their dressing is superb, and it comes with pita and tzatziki. \\n\\nThe Spanikopita (spinach pie) is perfect. Nice and flaky phyllo dough, spinach, and feta. Delicious!\\n\\nThe Chicken Pie is like a chicken pot pie, but in phyllo dough instead of a savory pie crust. They make the filling from scratch and there's lots of white meat chicken and veggies in there. Very tasty!\\n\\nThe skordalia is my favorite thing on their menu. It's a potato and garlic dip, about the same consistency as hummus, and it is a garlicky delight! It comes with lots of warm pita to eat it with. Warning: You won't want to eat this unless you'll be alone for the following 12 hours, or unless your partner also eats it, because your breath will be atrocious. Even if you brush your teeth, you'll still have garlic breath. \\n\\nThe decor inside is old and dated, but you're not there for the ambiance. You're there for the delicious homemade food!

I was not alone, there were several others eating at the bar that night.   For a starter I tried the small salad of fresh lettuces, radish, goat cheese and a light refreshing vinaigrette.  For the entr√©e, the Barrel Fish was recommended and when paired with a Pinot Blanc was a perfect match.  The entr√©e came with farro and winter radishes.  Nice flavor combinations.  What I really liked were the reasonable portions, prepared to perfection with mouth-popping flavors.  The wine list is exceptional and affordable. There were well over 40 wines by the glass, with numerous varieties and origins.  By the bottle most were $35 to $50, with some others in the over $100 category for the real oenophiles.

Dead serious.\\n\\nI have no idea why the DJ (or whoever was in charge of the music on Christmas night) was playing the most nightmarish mix of reggaeton/dancehall/dubstep at an excruciatingly ear-splitting level. I had to literally scream at the top of my lungs to my boyfriend, who was sitting right next to me. AND I was meeting his sister for the first time. Way to go for introductions. We were all yelling at each other like lunatics, and every 5 minutes pointing at the speakers and rolling our eyes, just to affirm the obvious: THE MUSIC WAS SO F*CKING LOUD.\\n\\nOkay, now that I have established the insane decibel-level that our poor ears endured during our 2 hour dinner at Ale House, I will say that the food was very good. It's always good. When you order a platter of fried anything, it's usually pretty damn tasty. At least my stomach was happy.\\n\\nSo, in summary. I like the Ale House. I, however, do not like to eat delicious onion rings with a side of thunderous, headache-inducing Sean Paul songs.\\n\\n-------------UPDATE--------------\\n\\nThe Director of Marketing sent me a lovely message apologizing for the music. It's nice to know that corporate has their eye on Yelp and unsatisfied customers. With that said, I hope it was apparent that I was reviewing my experience on one particular day.

My friend, who has worked in the restaurant business, complained that the deep fryer needed to be cleaned or the oil changed.

I still asked for the bloody mary, and was sorely disappointed by the concoction, especially for the high price. Even so, I do appreciate the attempt at meeting my needs.

It took about ten to twelve minutes before our server came to our table. \\n-I ordered soup and McCobb Salad. Soup didn't arrived in 15 minutes and it wasn't served hot. The soup had shredded cheese and it didn't melt. That's how luke warm it was. My salad followed along with my soup. The salad was nice but I really wanted to have my soup first.. \\n-Lastly, the check was slow. We asked for it and the server didn't come back for 5 minutes.. She knew we were in a rush since we asked for it in the middle of our meal. Once she grabbed it, it took another five minutes to transact. Five minutes to us customers can seem like an eternity especially we've been waiting for it. \\n\\nLikes\\n+Interesting decor, paintings, and colorful interior.

Midtown Bowl has pitchers. Get pitchers.\\n\\nUnlike Midtown Bowl you receive full wait service instead of ordering at the counter. This is nice in theory, but it took us 25 minutes to get someone to come over to take our order after we hit the 'request waitstaff' button on the bowling system - and that was because we got up and physically found someone to help us. Granted, it was opening weekend so it may take them a little while to find their service groove. I hope they do.\\n\\nThe food was really tasty but the portions for the white bean dip were a little off. It only came with only 3 pieces of fried pizza dough but ample dip. Dough is cheap, throw 2 more in there to make it balanced. The garlic knots had fresh basil on top, which was a nice touch.\\n\\nThe lanes are shiny and clean, as are the shoes and balls. The bowling OS is fun, you can select different themes/animations for your scorecard.

I can't imagine it getting much better than this.\\n\\nThe long: For everyone below who's talking about bad service, get over yourself. Most buffets are self-serve. Also realize that for $21 you're getting endless meat and seafood, brought as fast as you can eat.\\n\\nI have to say I am really impressed with this place. I make hot pot at home all the time and sure, making it yourself is cheaper, but there's no way I can make it like this.\\n\\nFirst off, they have like 5 different broths and offer bi-chamber hotpots. So it's awesome for spice lovers and the weaklings who want chicken broth.\\n\\nThe clutch feature is this place offers literally like 20 meats. Probably more. I've never had some of their offerings before, such as beef tongue (your choice of front or back), fried pork skin, and a couple others. Sure, they're not all to my liking, but I order what I like. They even offer fatty vs lean cut on some of the meats. How often do you get that kind of choice in a buffet!!???\\n\\nThey offer a lot of other bonuses. Quail eggs, beef tendon, and like 5+ types of mushroom.\\n\\nThe veggies are always fresh, never wilted or the least bit suspect of being old. Again, pretty impressive for a buffet to not have one bad piece in the quantity we went through.\\n\\nOK and finally, the service isn't even bad at all. You have to wave your hand at them to come over, but that's NORMAL. They were even real chill when we submitted two orders instead of one and ended up with double the food ordered. They canceled the accidental order. Yes I know, it's free, but they didn't bring out the food and waste it since we told them it was a mistake.\\n\\nAnd for those of you complaining it's not \\"authentic\\" I assume you're talking about the lack of flavorings for your own personal bowl? Well, I asked for raw chicken eggs and they gave it right to me, and same goes for some other spices and flavors that weren't at the table. So don't keep your mouth shut.

Sicne about 45 people were there, it was no problem, and we ordered some food and encouraged our friends to get dinner there (we could have food served to us in the back and it would count to the bill). It was also nice because it wasn't one bill - everyone had their own tab and it was just the total at the end of the night that was important.

The patio is painted the same bright blue of many of the homes on the restaurant's namesake island, and as soon as we walked in we were welcomed and felt comfortable.They had a decent selection of wine and beer, and we each chose a draft beer and ordered dinner at the bar. The menu is smaller, but I think it's an effort to make a few items well, rather than offer too much selection at the expense of quality. We started with a plate of hummus with pita bread. The hummus was delicious and the pita was toasted nicely, brushed with olive oil and was soft and delicious inside. Our dinner came and both entrees were delicious. She had the lamb gyro plate, and it was the best gyro I've had in town. The lamb was sliced generously, seasoned perfectly and came with a salad, more pita and 2 dolmas.

Secondly, the ribs were surprisingly good.  The were fall of the bone and the dry rub used before saucing really knocked them out of the park.  They ended up being only around $10 too which is insane. \\n\\nFor sides I got fries and added a caesar salad, both of which were decent.  Also samples the wings which were plump and well sauced.\\n\\nIf you need a nice sized meal for a good price I suggest stopping in here because it beats most other food you will find in the touristy parts of Orlando."},{"name":"Tin Shed Garden Cafe","address":"1438 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"If you don't have 2 and a half hours to burn, don't go here!

I am addicted to the bean and cheese nachos now! My only issue is their chicken. Everytime I have ordered a chicken sandwich, the chicken has been dry. I have coworkers that have not had issues with that, though. So maybe it's just me, but I dont feel I can give 5 stars because of experience with the chicken. Their burgers have always been cooked fantastically in my experience, though! The wait for your order is decent. It's not too short (like it's been sitting under heat lamps), but it's not too long either. If you tried them yet, I say give them a chance! They have a good selection of options!

Most of the food is consistently good. I absolutely love the chicken wings.\\n\\nI admit I strongly dislike some of the chicken dishes, like General Gau's or orange flavor chicken. The quality of the chicken seems poor in these, like scraps of leftover dark meat.\\n\\nThe interior of the restaurant is really clean, including the kitchen, although the seating doesn't look particularly inviting. Prices appear a little high, but the size of the portions seem to match. There tends to be a trend of overestimation on delivery times, like an estimate of 45 minutes to an hour turns out to be more like 30 minutes."},{"name":"Maudie‚Äôs Hacienda","address":"9911 Brodie Ln, Ste 900","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I love this place. It is a place that my family has been going to for years. The thing that keeps us coming back is that the experience is exactly the same every time you go (excluding longer wait times occasionally). The service is good whether you are a party of 2 or 13, I would highly recommend this location for a larger party (10ish people) during the slower times because it isn't the largest place, but isn't too small either. They have a nice outdoor area for people to sit on with wind protection, fans and heaters based on the time of year. \\n\\nThe Mexican Martinis are my favorites, so I recommend getting them when you go. \\n\\nThe food is great, I wouldn't say it is my all time favorite, but I really enjoy it.

Took several minutes to have a waitress greet us and take our drink order.  Nearly 10  minutes passed before she returned with our waters.  We placed three orders of pancakes and a reuben sandwich.  After 20 minutes, the waitress returned to verify our order -- she had forgotten to place our order with the kitchen.  Rather than push our order to the front, we waited another 15 minutes for dinner.  The pancake batter was obviously not prepared correctly, because the buttermilk pancakes were inedible they were so sour.  The kids refused to eat.  The other waitress offered to get us something else -- the first hadn't been back to check on us -- and we switched to french toast.  Again, we assumed that this would be a quick option for the hungry and impatient kids.  Another 15 minutes passed before our french toast was served.  Neither waitress apologized for the mistakes, delays, and confusion.\\n\\nWe asked to speak to a manager when our check was brought to us; however, there was no one for us to speak to regarding the significant issues with our dinner and service.  Again, no one offered an apology for the number of issues throughout our dinner.  We will likely not return any time soon.

The pizza was too wet where all of the toppings literally slid off the pizza and the Hawaiian pizza had wayyyyy tooo much cheese, where it didn't even taste good. And I love cheese. The pizza crust was good, had a nice texture to it . We also ordered the garlic parm wings, AMAZING. It's oven baked so it takes longer than pizza to cook, but so good.

At first glance, the menu doesn't really seem free of animal products, but most of their options can be made this way if you just ask their super friendly staff!\\n\\nI ordered the beans and rice, which sounds relatively uninspiring but is anything but! The jalapeno black beans are incredibly flavorful, with just a slight amount of spice and they're perfectly complimented by the rich and sweet coconut rice. They generously top the beans and rice off with a mess of spicy cumin tofu and some refreshing avocado slices. $10.50 seemed kind of expensive for a rice bowl, but it was quite massive (and admittedly, I finished the entire thing).\\n\\nMy girlfriend ordered the South of the Border (I think this is what it was called), which was a creamy cumin pasta topped with tomato and chicken (she subbed tofu).  It was a little heavy on the cumin for me, but she really likes it that way so I can't really knock them for that. I probably wouldn't order it myself, though.\\n\\nAll in all, the food is really solid, the staff is quirky and pleasant, and the ambience of the place is pretty welcoming.
