We started with the Hiramasa Sashimi salad .  Fresh and light slices of fish with a unique salsa mixture on top with a yummy vinaigrette.    My entree was the duo of veal.  Cooked perfectly and the pieces just melted in your mouth.  My bf opted for the hanger steak.  Again perfectly cooked,  though a rather small portion for the price.  We ended the meal with the special dessert of the day.   Homemade ice cream with a wafer like cookie, that was just ok.\\n\\nNow for the Bad:\\n\\nWhen we walked in there was a party of 4 in front of us waiting to be seated.   The restaurant is not very big and there was really no place to stand without getting in the way.   The hostess was very melancholy and though greeted us well enough, didn't even smile.   After settling in at our table we were pleasantly greeted by our server.  The pleasantness soon ended as my sleeve (and my bf's) kept catching on the edge of the table.  There are white tablecloths on the table but then it is overlaid with a white piece of paper.  The paper is just a smidge bigger in area of the table.  So unless you rested your arms on the table, each time you reached for your glass etc it would snag.  It got to be very annoying and I almost wanted to ask the server to remove it.  \\n\\nAnd here's the Ugly:\\n\\nFirst, even with the 'bad',  the deliciousness of the food may have convinced me to come back.   Unfortunately the next thing I write will most definitely keep that from happening.\\n\\nThis restaurant has a cozy, casual yet refined atmosphere about it.  The kitchen is completely open so you can pretty much see all the food being prepared as well as hear what's going on.   Sometimes it got a little loud but wasn't too, too bad.   Ready for the ugly?   From where I sat I had a pretty good view of the kitchen.  Right in my line of site was this chef with a trimmed beard.   He wasn't preparing any food at that moment but I watched as he scratched his face, chin, front and back of his neck.  Without washing or wiping his hands I continued to watch as he began preparing an entree.   I kept a very watchful eye to see if his hands would touch any food...it did.  I watched a few minutes more and saw again and again as he touched food.   He wasn't tossing a piece of food back and forth in his hand but he touched it significant enough that I finally turned my head away not wanting to know if that was my entree he was preparing.  Not too long after this happened our food did arrive and I was very tempted to send it back.  My bf reminded me that if we were not privy to their kitchen we wouldn't have a clue who's hand may have touched are food and just decided to let it go.   \\n\\n\\nSadly,  although I enjoyed the food, it isn't just the food that makes a patron want to return."},{"name":"Arhiboo Shawarma","address":"4865 Memorial Dr","city":"Stone Mountain","stars":"4","text":"Excellent falafel sandwich!

I will be going back to check out the bar on a Friday or Saturday night soon though, because it seems like it would be a great place to hang out and have a few drinks.  It seems like a pretty fun place to be at night on the weekends.  The Cuban sandwich is enormous and very delicious.  I am a huge fan of Cuban sandwiches and this place has one of, if not the, best Cuban I've had and I've tried them from all over the place.  Their pricing is very fair especially considering how large the portions are.  I've brought family to this place and everyone loves their food, no matter what they ordered.  I haven't ever had a sub-par dish and neither has anyone I've gone with.  This place is huge inside and as the other reviews mention, it has a very cool nightclub vibe with color-changing LEDs all over the place, a sizable dance floor, a couple of bars, and a low-light atmosphere that gives it that nightlife feel no matter what time of day you're visiting.  It's a pleasant surprise when you first walk in the door, it's not what you would expect on the inside when you view it from the outside.  I would love to see this place stick around for years to come since I work 2 minutes away and I love their food so much, I've been recommending it to everyone to try to help fill the tables a little more.

We went here on a whim with two friends and were promptly seated outside. Not that they had a 1-2 hour wait for indoor tables. Outside was plenty warm as they had both heaters and blankets for us. We started with a bottle of wine. While most options range 40s-50s there are several in the low 30s. We got one of their more affordable bottles and loved it. They brought out fresh bread with oil while we decided on our meal. For tapas we got a three cheese plate, patatas bravas, steak, octopus, potato pancakes and beet salad. Literally everything except the beet salad was a winning dish. The steak was cooked to temp and served with a wonderful sauce. The patatas bravas are such a typical tapas dish I usually stay away but these were probably the best I've had. Fried perfectly and seasoned with a bit of spice that's immediately calmed by the velvety aioli they're served with. The octopus was slightly over charred and small portioned for the price but nicely tenderized. The one miss was the beet salad.

Dine Out Boston, previously Restaurant Week, has introduced different set prices for fancy-pants pre-fixe menus.  Ruth's in particular offered a three course menu for at lunch time for $20.\\n\\nSince there were two of us, we got to try both the soup and salad, picked the obvious choice of a filet mignon for entree, and both got the only option for dessert, whiskey bread pudding.  \\n\\nThe tomato soup and basic salad with vinaigrette were unspectacular.  Not impressed.  However, the filet mignon was by far the star of the entire meal. It comes out on a sizzling hot plate that the waiter specifically tells you not to touch to prevent burning yourself. The 10 oz filet is covered with herb butter that melts immediately, giving the meat the perfect amount of flavor. One bite into the steak itself is like heaven.  Like the butter, the meat melts in your mouth because it is so tender.  It is even easy to say that it was one of the best steaks I've had in my life.  The garlic mash definitely stood out as the better side accompaniment.  The bread pudding wasn't overpowering with whiskey flavor as I was expecting and came with fresh berries that helped to complete the meal.\\n\\nFor this one occasion, we sat at the bar area and arrived rather early without reservations and the place was already packed. If we were to come again, we would do things the same way, arrived early and sit at the bar area. The waiter was quirky, the area felt casual and we left satisfied.  \\n\\nCheers to Ruth's Chris for doing steaks just right.

Very creamy with few mushrooms which confused us as it was listed as a mushroom risotto on the menu. The gnocchi and red sauce were good, my dad finished the entire portion!

If they had better sides I would give them 4 stars.  Salt Lick gets in all the top 10 lists. So we had to try them. They are way south of Austin.  The place is huge on the outside large parking lot. The place feels like a ride you are about to go into.  They get  very busy we had a 35 min. wait on Friday at 1:30 pm. Someone told me they have a 3 hour waits sometimes.  Had to wait outside so if it is hot or raining it will be muddy and not fun.\\n\\nAfter going inside you sit at large picnic tables.  You order at the table. The service was good and fast. You don't wait long for the food. I had the 2 meet plate brisket and ribs. Very Good ribs. The brisket was thick cut which I liked. And very moist the sauce is a mustard base flavor it was OK. For me I like the dry rubbed better. And the sweet spicy sauce better. I did not like the sides the potato salad was not good very plain. Beans are OK but they gave me very little and the coleslaw was also plain.\\nThe cost is a few dollars higher then most BBQ joints.  You have to go next door to buy beer very strange set up. \\n\\nOver all I like the BBQ meat but did not like the sides. The atmosphere is a novelty with the big round pit inside for show.

The Twister Ride (which is specific to Orlando) was broken. The Simpsons Ride was fun as always.

I was delighted to find that it was very tasty without being overly salty and not greasy at all. I have only tried a few things so far but all have been good. It is not a fancy place, cafeteria-type  concept, but pleasant and clean, with a few tables for dining in. We have only done take out on days I didn't feel to cook. It's great for that. They have the food displayed cafeteria-style in vats behind glass from which you choose what you want and they share it out for you. You can also just order from the menu which is also displayed as well as their specialsl. The fried whole fish was really saltwater snapper (not Tilapia which I hate), crispy-skinned and moist inside. The prices are very good, I'd say in the \\"cheap eats\\" category. The stewed chicken, rice and beans, mofongo, Chicharones, pork and yuca were all quite good and at the right price for a weeknight pickup-dinner for the family. Portions are huge as well. There is a bit of a wait sometimes depending on what you order since I believe they cook some things to order. The servers I have encountered also spoke a little English so it was fine ordering plus the food is right there so you can point to it, but it would be easier if you are bilingual.

Service was also attentive and quick, even during a busy lunch service. On that note, there is both outside and inside seating, both of which were equally busy during my visit. Regardless, my dining partner and I were seated immediately and greeted by a friendly Cuban server who was very knowledgable about the menu. \\n\\nThis was my first time trying Cuban food and I thoroughly enjoyed my meal here. I ordered the Plato Cubano (Cuban pork roast simmered in creole pork gravy) with moros & cristianos (the Cuban version of rice and beans). The pork was extremely tender and went really well with the gravy. Although a somewhat heavier meal, it didn't feel overwhelmingly heavy. This was due, in part, to the fact that the gravy was a bit thinner than traditional gravy. I also liked that there was a side of beets with the dish, as this helped to brighten up the other rich flavors on the plate. The moros & cristianos were also wonderful! Although it's just black beans and rice, something about the seasoning made this side really tasty. This dish cost $8.75 and was definitely worth it. It was both super filling and delicious! My dining partner ordered the Camarones Enchilados (prawns in a savory tomato sauce with mild chili peppers and West Indian spices). Although I didn't get a taste, he mentioned that he was very impressed with all of the unique flavors and the overall brightness and freshness of the dish.  \\n\\nI will definitely be back soon to try their empanadas and croquetas, both of which looked great.

Their \\"authentic\\" Mexican version is more like Asian fajitas. The chicken and vegetables were soaked in soy sauce, of all things, creating a taste like a chicken stir fry. There was no hint of Mexican flavor at all. The chicken had a rubbery consistency and the vegetables were over cooked and swimming in sodium. It was inedible. We proceeded to order desert in hopes of something better, but were quite disappointed.

Standing there I'm feeling bad for parking outside their business for hours, and then I'm thinking they must be going through hard times to be welcoming coffee addicts into trying out some hummus so forwardly.\\n\\nAfter trying all the flavors in front of me, my taste buds begin to take over. My train of thought goes from resisting the man's sales tatics to, this hummus is just too damn delicious!\\n\\nThere's a reason this tiny treasure has five stars overall, and just like Baristadors, small and unheard of by most, the customers who know of these places feel a special connection and can enjoy their coffee and hummus for the taste and not for convenience. The price for the hummus is also cheap, two units has lasted me two weeks, and that's $5 a unit. They usually only accept cash, they have a weak internet connection and it's difficult for them to use cards, even though my card was accepted.\\n\\nThe owner's name is Muhammad and he is a very courteous and respectful man. He even offered me a part time job. The Hummus Stop is worth stopping by with out a doubt. Just be careful because there is a business across the street that sales hummus, and they have been known to tell customers they are The Hummus Stop."},{"name":"The Salty Pig","address":"130 Dartmouth St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Charcuterie realness!

It was a Monday afternoon at 2:30 and that is the time to go if you don't want any lines and easy parking.  Also, the attitude was tuned down a little because they weren't having to be rude to so many people.\\n\\nBefore I justify my 3 stars I want to clarify what I think is some misperceptions regarding some of the low (1 and 2) star ratings.  One, charred burnt crust.  This is what comes with wood fired ovens.  The truth is for wood fired pizza it was not charred enough.  Look at videos of wood fired pizza making and you will see they are usually more charred.  Now that said, it is perfectly fine if people don't enjoy a wood fired pizza.  Having been raised on NYC slice pies I know where you're coming from.  Two, PROSCIUTTO.. many comments on how the prosciutto was not good.  Well, it ISN'T prosciutto crudo or prosciutto di parma (like you get with melon slices) it is prosciutto COTTO which simply means cooked ham or like you get in the Kroger deli, boiled ham (it might be baked but it seemed pretty moist to me).  It is just ham and cheese sandwich ham.  \\n\\nPROS:\\ngood ingredients\\nvery tasty\\nunique (in a good way)\\n\\nCONS:\\nnot cooked enough (inexcusable for a top rated pizza house)\\nexpensive\\narrogance\\nsausage (that stuff that looked like dog poop on your pizza) too thick and big\\n\\nNot cooked enough: this is because the ovens are not hot enough.  They write that they are 850F, and they told me 1000F (when I asked) but I'm positive it is 650F or well under probably closer to 600F.  They probably heat them initially to 800 but for the entire time I was there (and I lingered a long time to study their operation) I never once saw them tend the fire, couldn't see the fire, they never swept the hearth for ashes, never pushed back the fire.  Their WOOD FIRING is almost 90% for marketing because they use a cool oven.  \\nNot cooked enough: they use very wet ingredients which makes it soggy.  It is a sloppy pizza.  I'm an experience pizza eater, and in general a pretty neat eater but I came out of there with about 7 big sauce spots on my shirt.\\n\\nI might go there again only because they do do some things very well, but I wouldn't get the tattoo."},{"name":"The Brewer's Table","address":"4715 E 5th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Visiting from Florida.

My girlfriend and I arrived around noon, and the estimated wait time was 20 minutes. We waited indoors for about 20 minutes without hearing our name, so I asked the hostess about the remaining wait. Good thing I did, because they had crossed our name out and were about to move onto the next group. I have no idea how quietly they must have said our name that we didn't hear it from about 5 ft away...\\n\\nWe decided to share a single entree and ordered the Southern Style Benedict (I forget the exact name) and a cup of coffee. The Southern Style Benedict consists of two biscuit sandwiches, each with a single sunny side egg and turkey bacon, all drenched in gravy. It was okay. The eggs and turkey bacon were good, biscuits were okay, and the gravy was slightly disappointing. The biscuits are standard, so nothing special to say. The gravy was very light and watery? Nothing like the gravy I want on my biscuits. The only good thing about the light gravy was that I didn't feel super gross after the meal. On the other hand, the coffee was surprisingly decent.\\n\\nAlthough the wait for a table was only about 20 minutes. The wait for food was pretty long... There were a lot of tables seating customers without any food. Service was slow, but our server was nice. When I requested a to-go cup for my remaining coffee, she brought me a to-go cup filled with more coffee.\\n\\nA decent option for brunch in Atlanta. There's free private lots in the front and back, which already gives me a reason to choose the location over many other Atlanta restaurants. If the time between ordering and eating was shorter, I'd probably choose Atlanta Breakfast Club over many other breakfast places that have ridiculous weekend wait times. However, the total wait time ends up only slightly shorter, so there are definitely better brunch options in the area.

I've been there on a Friday night, on a Wednesday night, on a Sunday night, and on a Monday night and every time the place has been just as crazy and packed.  \\n\\nThe very first time we went, we were unprepared.  I had tried to look at Yelp beforehand, and while many reviews mentioned it was BYOB, I had a bad experience once back in San Francisco when we brought beers into a place we thought was BYOB and were told we couldn't drink them (it was TRAUMATIC I tell you!)  Anyway, so we didn't bring booze to Antico.  And of course saw that EVERYONE had come with booze.  Plus, the place was a MADHOUSE and I was worried that I'd have to eat standing up, and all this without any alcohol.  AND we accidentally ordered the Bianca (which does not have red sauce and which my rudimentary Italian skills should have tipped me off to but oh well) and while we could tell that the pizza was objectively delicious - the crust was perfection, with a little bit of yeastiness, a little bit of toothesome chewiness, and one look at the ridiculously legit looking Italians making the pizza and you know this shit is gonna be authentic - we just didn't like the toppings we'd ordered.  No red sauce on pizza makes my husband feel stabby.  And did I mention we forgot alcohol?\\n\\nThe next time we went, we were smarter.  We got a bottle of wine and ordered a pizza with red sauce and anchovies.  The red sauce was fresh and tangy and perfect.  And I was more mentally prepared for the free-for-all that is the table situation, so I didn't have a panic attack (only a mild fluttering of the heartbeat.)\\n\\nThe third and fourth times, we brought out of town guests.  The third was with my parents and we made friends with the people sharing our table and at some point (for someone's birthday, I can only assume) multiple poppers went off and streamers got all up on my pizza and in my wine and it was great.  The fourth time, we lucked out and got a corner of the one nice-ish communal table in the front part and were intelligent enough to order the Fra Diavola, perhaps the best thing that's ever been put on a plate, set in front of me, and put in my face.  \\n\\nSo here are the essential things to know:\\n*Bring alcohol.  Preferably red wine.\\n*Know that it will be crazycrowded.\\n*Know that a spot to eat will most likely not immediately present itself.  But keep heart - I've never not been able to sit down when I've eaten there.  And even if you have to stand, there are many surface on which to place your pizza.\\n*Which brings me to the most important thing: this will be some of the best, most authentic pizza you will have outside of Italy.  \\n\\nBottom-line: It will be worth it.  And hell, if you're prepared for it, the lively, convivial atmosphere can even be super fun.  And BYOB is always friendly for the wallet.  \\n\\nPlus, I think it's probably a great place to bring a date to see if he or she is going to be mega rad and fun, or mega lame.  Which is always good to determine as quickly as possible."},{"name":"New India Cuisine","address":"2304 S Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Seems like they got a new menu, or a new mojo, over the past six months.

Easily got seats at the bar at approximately 7:15 which is a shocker for a Saturday night... until you experience the horrible service provided by the bartender and realize why it's so empty. We sat down and waited to be greeted, having conversation. Bartender acknowledges us after a few minutes saying she'll be with us in a moment, perfect, no issue there. A few moments later she comes over with menus (after barking at us from across the bar asking if we're having dinner or just drinks) and asks what we want to drink. No smile, no \\"Hi ladies how are you?\\", nothing. So we order beverages and she rushes us into making an order, which we were not yet ready for. We all have open menus and we're all speaking amongst ourselves about a non-related food subject, which she was aware of because she interrupted our conversation with a resting bitch face to ask for the order. Since we were not ready at her convenience, she simply decided not to come back and take our order. About 15 minutes later, her coworker realized we were still waiting and came over to take care of us. Thankfully, she was nice. Also not overly friendly or smiling, but polite and attentive. Food was good, but certainly not good enough to make up for the first bartenders bitchy attitude. You're a bartender, you're supposed to TEND to your guests needs. But I guess it's rude to not be ready to order 2 minutes after you've been handed a menu to a restaurant you've never been to. Sorry to have inconvenienced you. Hope you're catching the sarcasm there. We asked the first bartender for the check since she was closest, which she did in complete silence. She dropped it off, no words spoken. No \\"thank you ladies\\" or \\"come back and see us again\\", or \\"have a good rest of your weekend\\"... nothing. We dropped cards immediately and said \\"we'll just split it please\\" to which she saw/heard as she was bending over to get something out of the well, but preferred to walk away and send her coworker over again, which was also done in a timely manner. Again, sarcasm. We tipped 20% because the second bartender has to deal with enough crap from her coworker.. Long story short, we will most certainly not be back. I suggest that management gives this girl a serious reality check about her awful attitude. Your customers pay your bills, and you don't build regulars by showing your misery at work. When you're behind the bar, you are on stage. Leave your problems out the door, put your mask on, shut up and count the money. That's the industry, and if you can't perform it,  which you can't, at least don't drag the business you work for down with you. And just so management knows who to chew up, in case you care about your clientelle, the nice bartender was the one with the bun on top of her head. Miss bitch face had her hair down.

She then turned and finished her conversation with the other hostess, while we stood there staring at the 3 of them. When they were done that's when they decide to seat us. The hostess who sat us said absolutely nothing to us.. except\\n\\"Your table is that one one in the corner\\" then she walked away.  We stood there waiting for the hostess to come back with the high chair, big surprise she never came. We had to ask our server for the chair and kids menu and crayons for the kids. (Dinner and server were good) when we left the hostess just watched us leave. Said nothing.

We knew from reading the Yelp reviews and having walked by several times in the past that this was normal, and we ended up waiting until about 6:30 before we were seated. The restaurant itself only seats maybe 20-30 people in a very cramped area. Normally this would have lost points with me, but truthfully it ended up lending to the charm. Because of the open kitchen set-up and the casual attitude of the staff (our waiter - Tony - asked us \\"What do you kids want for supper?\\" when he took our order), it almost feels like you're at your aunt or grandmother's house for dinner. I come from a large family, so this did not phase me at all; it felt almost relaxed and normal to be in that atmosphere. \\n\\nThe menu is simple - appetizers, entrees, a simple wine list, one beer (right now they're serving Sam Adams Summer), and some soft drinks. No dessert - but truthfully with all the Italian pastry options in the North end, it's not necessary. Besides - once you eat at Giacomo's, you'll understand why they do not have dessert. They KNOW they have a line outside, and dessert/coffee only makes people loiter. I've never seen any restaurant turn over a table as quickly as they do after people clear out to get the next people in. Never mind the fact that your food comes out pronto - hot, quick, and delicious. It's almost like a fancy Italian dinner diner in terms of speed & service from the staff.\\n\\nAnyways - the food. The freaking food. It was amazing overall. To start, we ordered the fried calamari because the Yelp reviews raved about it. The calamari is served with a side of red sauces and some fried/battered peppers (jalapenos?) mixed in. Our order of friend calamari had minimal tentacles and was slightly overcooked (but not too rubbery) which was awesome for me because I like my calamari slightly overcooked and HATE the tentacles. The sauces was hot and it was a perfect compliment to the calamari. I would say it was *good* calamari, but truthfully I worry the Yelp reviews are overhyping it.  \\n\\nThen it was on to the entrees. My husband ordered their Fruiti de Mare with the Giacomo house sauce and I partook in one of their specials: Gnocchi stuffed with roasted red pepper & goat chese cooked with chicken, mushrooms & basil in a tomato marscarpone sauce. I can't speak to my husband's dish (but you can read his review - he's Steve A.) but I will say that mine was phenomenal. The sauce was absolutely to die for; the sweetness of the marscarpone is a great balance to the tomatoes. The gnocchi was about perfect and unlike some restaurants I've been to - they did not skimp on it at all. Too often I've seen restaurants skimp on the gnocchi when they serve it up with other things mixed in with it. There was a good amount of basil without overpowering the dish, and the flavors were just out of this world. \\n\\nSide note - they do offer bread with what tasted like a high-end olive oil on the table. The bread itself is your average crusty bread. \\n\\nOne other tip (and why I say this is not for those with severe food allergies): There didn't seem to be a ton of wiggle room on the menu  - what's on the menu is what you get with the only switch out option being if you get seafood entrees you can pick your own sauce - and when your food comes out they immediately dust it with grated parmesan cheese. There was a sign someplace that said something about inform your server if you have an allergy, but with some of the folks I know having severe allergies to one thing or another - I wouldn't risk it if you do. Just my thought, I could be wrong though.\\n\\nAnyways - overall this place was awesome. I felt comfortable, right at home, I loved our waiter Tony, I loved how the staff interacted with each other and the patrons, and I absolutely adored the food there. I could not think of a place that I would willing wait 75-90 minutes for on a second occasion, but I would ABSOLUTELY wait that long for Giacomo's again.

My sweetie and I came in early Saturday evening a couple of weeks ago and we were one of three tables.  The waitresses were very friendly and helpful.  We were waiting for two other people to join us.  In the meantime, we ordered some wine and tapas.  We had the shrimp and grits (spicy/oily version that is fairly good), tortilla espanola (pretty tasty) and the samosa (solid effort).  I would not bother with the cheese/fruit plate - just two kinds of cheese and melon in a container.  As the place got more crowded and once we formed a party of four, our evening went downhill quickly.\\nWe ordered wine and food that never came.  We waited patiently.  When we followed up, the waitress asked us what it was we needed, again?  We got one of four glasses of wine.  We waited awhile longer and asked a different waitress.  We eventually got a spinach dip but no bread.  Finally, I went to the front bar and asked to talk to a manager.  The \\"manager\\" was also waiting tables and was not impressed that we had not received our wine and food.  In fact, she had the attitude of \\"Hello, it's Saturday and we are SUPER busy...and your waitress is new...and I cannot be bothered to apologize.\\"  She did say she would comp us a few tapas.  Ok.  Except when we finally got our bill, we were charged the full amount and had to ask for them to comp us.  The experience just left a bad taste in my mouth.

I know it might seem harsh, but cold over-cooked eggs with bland hash and oily potato strings is not a good breakfast by any measure.\\n\\nLet's start with \\"Phantom Gourmet\\", the television show that I can only surmise takes bribes to write reviews.  I have gone to nearly a dozen restaurants over the past four years based on Phantom reviews and I can assure you they have no relation to the actual quality of the food or service.  This place is rated as the best brunch in Cambridge by the Phantom, but I would contend you would be better off eating donuts from 7-11 than going here, or maybe just skipping the meal all together.\\n\\nOkay, so that was a bit strong.  The food is made for Facebook/Instagram folks.  It's very pretty and the plating was nice.  For the 15 seconds I saw the food coming to the table I was very pleased.  That was the highest point of the experience.  The coffee was okay but oily, like it had sat out and been re-heated (this needs to be said as that is a key part to any brunch in my eyes).  I know someone out there is going to argue \\"You just don't know good coffee!\\"  Well, maybe.  I've been at MIT for 4 years killing myself with the stuff and I know what I like.  I drink coffee everyday, 3-6 cups of it, and I drink it from almost anywhere I can buy it, and never have I had such a gross cup of the stuff, that is except for when I make the mistake of re-heating it in a microwave, and surprisingly that is exactly what this tasted like... \\n\\nI ordered the hash, thinking it would be a nice simple meal.  I need to state that I have a deep love for diner corned beef hash, it is to me simply the best hangover/drinking food known to man.  What came to my table was a concept of hash (meat+potatoes) redesigned by an art school freshman thinking that piling things on  top of each other made them better tasting.  Served in a pristine white bowl with ~1/2 the total food volume consisting of deep-fried shoestring onions.  These \\"onion rings\\" were incredibly chewy and greasy, I had to use a knife to cut through them so that I didn't end up dragging the whole woven mess onto my shirt (which was pretty difficult due to the bowl they were all piled in).\\n\\nThe egg was stark white, the yolk was a hard yellow disk of jelly.  It was prepared over easy I guess (until that point I hadn't realized that they did not ask me how I wanted it, I would have said over easy, but still).  It's pretty easy to cook eggs so they're hot when they reach the table, so it was a real surprise to bite into a cold egg, especially one so over-cooked as to have a solid yolk.\\n\\nIt ended up a good thing that the yolk was so hard though, as the \\"toast\\" they put in front of me was the hardest, most stale and oil soaked brick of bread I have ever touched.  This toast would have made great breadcrumbs.  I however made the mistake of biting into it only to find it wedged around my teeth gouging the roof of my mouth.  With greasy oil dripping from my hand I had to rip the bread out of my face (weird phrasing, but this bread was epic bad!).  As an aside here, they didn't ask me what type of toast either.  I usually go for wheat or rye.  This was an italian bread, very airy with an incredibly tough crust.  Not really appropriate for breakfast foods.\\n\\nNow for the hash!  Is it hash if home fries touch steak?  Is it hash if french fries rub up to ham?  No.  Hash is a delicate mix of meat and potato and spice that makes a man's mouth water and is belly rejoice.  What they made was a mix of fancy sounding meat (tongue and cheek, literally those parts) with skillet fried potato cubes.  That was it.  No co-mingling or mashing or flavor swapping.  Just a stack of small fried cubed potato with some flecks of fancy meat.  The meat was basic in flavor.  Cheek is supposed to be very tender, but the way they had prepared it made it dry and flaky.  The tongue was chewy with some serious browning on the edges.  The size and shape of the meat and potato medley made it such that I had to skewer a few pieces at a time by fork to eat them.  2 pieces of potato, 1 piece meat, chew, swallow, repeat.\\n\\nI tried to work in the egg, that was like wrangling a rubber tire with a pitchfork.  Oh, and those damned onion rings.  They didn't go with anything.  By the time I was half way through with them I was having to chug the dank coffee to get the greasy feeling down my throat.  I ended the meal about half way through the food, which is really impressive when you consider the whole lot of it was probably the size of my fist, making it the smallest brunch I have ever been served.  \\n\\nI paid my bill (~$29 after $5 tip, that's for only 1 person too) and walked out.\\n\\nIn summary, this was the single worst brunch I can recall having.\\n\\n\\nTL;DR  -  Bad hash, bad coffee, not worth it."},{"name":"Simplicity Wine & Eats","address":"4801 Burnet Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I finally visited Simplicity late on a Sunday afternoon and was pleased that I could order off the Brunch Menu.

For dinner I had the eggplant parm because it's one of my favorite dishes... It wasn't heavily breaded or oily/greasy which was great but again the dish was nothing special... My husband ordered the special which featured homemade fusilli with lobster meat and shrimp. He chose the giacomo sauce which was absolutely delicious - finally some flavor!

Well one thing that I'm not a huge fan of is the seemingly chaotic system of ordering, waiting for your sandwich and paying for it.  For example, if you order a hot sandwich you have to wait until your sandwich is called by the cashier but if you order a cold sandwich then you can proceed to the cashier once your sandwich is built.\\n\\nNot only that even waiting for your sandwich requires your absolute attention and you have to listen for your sandwich and tell them what you want on it.  It's not like ordering at burger king where you say what you want and then a few minutes later you get it.  So this is not the place where you can just talk on the phone and wait for your sandwich to magically appear.\\n\\nDespite that shortcoming I love this place and my absolute favorite meal combo is a double reuben on pastrami with a half pound of mediterranean salad.  For the price it offers absolutely delicious sandwiches.  I know that it might seem expensive but try finding a place with premium cuts of meat on fresh bread for less than 8 dollars.\\n\\nAnd if you don't like crowds try to get there before 11:30 otherwise wait til sometime after 1:30."},{"name":"Row 34","address":"383 Congress St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Pretty hip restaurant, has a nice industrial feel to it with lots of concrete, metal and exposed beams.

Superb quality cold cuts and cheeses. Their bread is very good, too.\\n\\nHere's how it works: You walk over to Broad Street from your office. Or, pull into one of the 15 minute loading zones conveniently located nearby. Don't worry. You'll be in and out before parking enforcement even notices you. If you're smart, you'll take lunch a little late or a little early because it's very busy between Noon and 1p, although the line moves fast. Get in line, but be ready to order (meat on bread, i.e., \\"corned beef on rye) when you reach the colorful character who is responsible for the first step in this super sandwich assembly line. Need some suggestions? My favorite is the Classic (Turkey, RB, Pastrami, Slaw, Russian dressing) on Kaiser Roll. Too much? Keep it simple. Even the basic turkey and swiss is a standout.\\n\\nOrder in? Now slide down the counter. When your sandwich reaches the assembly guy, tell him what you want on top. Then circle around to the cash register. Your sandwich (wrapped in butcher paper with a dill pickle) will meet you there. Grab a Black and White cookie (if there are any left). Joke with the owner. Whatever he dishes up, give it right back to him. Pay (and tip!) and the only decision you have to make now is whether you want a bag to go or a tray to eat there (it's spacious, but when the line snakes through the restaurant, I'd rather eat at my desk or on Broad Street if the weather is nice).\\n\\nI don't order their hot sandwiches, because it takes a bit longer (don't go past the sign), and because simple is definitely the way to go here. I had the lobster bisque once. It didn't thrill me. But, a soft, tasty kaiser roll stuffed with quality cold cuts and consistently good service makes Reuben's an at least once-per-week stop for me, and, more importantly, makes it easily one of the top delicatessens in all of metro Atlanta."},{"name":"Boneheads","address":"4511 Olde Perimeter Way","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Nice staff, but this place has some of the worst food I have ever had.

Wish there could have been more noodles.  Was left with a big bowl of soup at the end - could have used more food, especially given the long wait.\\n\\nCash only as others have mentioned.  Noticed that the table next to us all sent back their food, complaining that the noodles tasted very wrong.  They got new orders within 5-10 minutes and apparently were much happier the second time around.  Our food was fine but made me nervous with all the reports about possible food poisoning.

When I walked into the store I was immediately slapped in the face by the delicious smell of popcorn... I seriously wanted to roll around the floor... screaming POPCORN POPCORN... but I refrained from doing so.  \\n\\nI've looked at the menu beforehand many times, but I was still surprised by how few flavors there are.  I would think with popcorn the possibilities are endless and they would have more than the five or six flavors (can't remember if the plain butter flavor was in the shop as well as available online), but hey it works... The salty caramel is definitely my favorite.  \\n\\nI was offered a sample in the shop and tried the pimento cheese flavor... It is definitely cheesy, but not for me, I've never been a fan of any cheesy popcorn.  So with my mind made up I got a small bag of caramel popcorn and a sample bag of the spicy bbq popcorn since I was given a business promotional card for a free bag at the last yelp event.  \\n\\nI'd planned to eat my popcorn while watching movies at my friend's house but didn't put a dent in either bag that night.  This popcorn is not to be trifled with lightly.  It packs quite a punch!!!  The caramel popcorn was crunchy, sticky, salty, chewy, and sweet.  After eating a few handfuls, I realized why there were individual little flossers on their front counter in the store.  That caramel stuck to every part of my teeth it could find and I loved it but could only eat a little.  \\n\\nThe spicy bbq was a different story...  Let's just say it was very well seasoned...  I guess you can say it's more like a dry rub bbq spice.  It's not bad, but strong and I could only eat a few pieces at a time.  \\n\\nOverall, I had good customer service, and I enjoyed the popcorn.  I reckon I just can't eat alot of it at once.  I will definitely be back to try the s'mores flavor I heard is coming in January... I think.  It's a cool spot (I'm not even going to mention the nightmare that is the Peachtree Battle parking lot... just be careful) and I hope they keep dishing out great popcorn."},{"name":"Kika Tapas","address":"5 Broad Canal Way","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3","text":"I came by with my coworkers and we really enjoyed the experience!

I've been to about every poke bowl place in ATX, so I confidently say that this place is better than Poke House, even if by a very minut fraction.   They offer many options for the bowls, including kale, vegetable dehydrated chips, and many different toppings and flakes.   I can't finish a bowl to myself,  that's how big they are!  Also, the poke avocado toasts are a must try!   So delicious!!

They are generous with the mayo so if you don't love that, make sure you mention it. And I recommend the wheat bread because it is delicious.\\n\\nAnother update is that I tried the chocolate raspberry trifle, finally!

I prefer simpler rolls to be able to taste the quality of the fresh seafood.  I don't like sushi that is surrounded by fried stuff, spicy stuff, heavy sauces, cream cheese and especially cooked fish.  They did let us  order a rainbow roll and tuna roll even though they were off the menu.  Not sure what the point of taking those rolls off a menu if they can still make them and if people like them.  They also used to give you a complimentary little cucumber salad but tonight we didn't get that so I'm guessing that they're phasing that out too.  It was such a nice little gesture.

We were not disappointed.  We came in on a Thursday evening around 7pm and were seated right away.  We started out by  ordering the beef and cheese & potato empanadas for appetizers.  The cheese & potato empanadas were delicious!  For entrees I tried the Arroz con Pollo and my husband ordered the Cubano sandwich.  Both dishes were very good.  My dish came with Maduros which I love. The chicken was very tender and the saffron rice was a good compliment to the dish. To top the meal off I also ordered Banana Spice batido.  It was very filling.  In the end I was too full to try one of the delicious looking desserts on display in the case towards the front of the restaurant.\\n\\nI love the decor of the restaurant.

While in Columbus on business, my co-worker and I went for late lunch on a week day. We walked in to a sign that said seat yourself. So we saddled up to the front window table top and reviewed the menu. The place does a cute homage to the era of saloons with dark wood, low lighting, the long bar to slide a sarsaparilla down and the the slightly creepy pictures of skeletons on the walls. It definitely gives the Saloon #10 in Deadwood a run for its money for decor! Now for the food! The nice thing is this place offers a lot of veggie friendly options, including their chili. I ordered the lunch special which includes a half sandwich, soup and my childhood favorite of \\"Fritos\\". I chose the veggie sandwich as my half sandwich. When my plate arrived, I was pleasantly pleased. The veggie chili looked good, loaded with cheese and dollop of a spice sour cream. The taste was light and flavorful. The veggies sandwich was fresh and crisp with veggies and in a very well toasted slice of bread. Also to my surprise, the portions were generous for a lunch combo. I actually left some food behind. My co-worker ordered the Shells and cheese and loved it. Again the portion was huge, so she had to leave some behind. BUT, we were not leaving without trying the \\"red velvet\\" cupcakes. The cupcake was in a word \\" cute\\". It was covered in a large spread of cream cheese frosting and a Maraschino cherry. The icing was very creamy but a little too much, we both had to scrape half off. The cake itself was √ºber moist. I would definitely come back for coffee and cupcake on my next visit. The best part was the price! Our bill for two was around $25. For the price alone, I will be back. This is a great place with a fun atmosphere, good comfort food and great prices. The one ding I would give is the service, which many other yelpers have commented on. We sat at the table for 10 minutes before a server came by to take our order. We had to order water vs the usual expectation of it showing up. And our actual meal took a while to get to us even though the place was not crowded. Now we did come after a usual lunch time, so perhaps the staff had checked out for their lunch, but they should just amp the presence a smidge for late eaters like ourselves and provide water without asking. But for that \\"glitch\\", I give it a thumbs up for veggie folks traveling to Columbus and want to lunch in the Short North!\\n\\nChitown Veg Gal"},{"name":"Rocco's Tacos & Tequila Bar","address":"7468 W Sand Lake Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"This place has some of the best tacos I've ever eaten.

Wonderful location & great place to take out-of-town guests for a true Texas experience, but not even close to being the best BBQ in &/or near Austin, in our group's humble opinion. Will acknowledge that the BBQ itself was exceptionally tender, which is the main attraction for any BBQ restaurant, but none of us liked the BBQ sauce, & we all ranked the sides (beans, slaw, potato salad) as the weakest of all the other BBQ places we have visited. The potato salad has some seasoning to turn it reddish in color, but other than that there is nothing else in it. No onions or pickles. Just potatoes. The beans tasted like they were right out of a can, with zero added thought given to improving the recipe.  Like the potato salad, the slaw was nothing but shredded cabbage. Nothing else. Both sauces were really thick & exceedingly sweet for our taste. $17 for a 1 meat platter is fairly pricey compared to most BBQ spots. We would definitely NOT stand in line 45+++ minutes as we have encountered on prior visits, which is why we have never eaten there until this visit, when we were seated immediately. We had good service, & we like the place, but were very surprised to have been totally underwhelmed by the sides.  With all the great BBQ in Spicewood, Austin & Lockhart, we won't be drawn back to Salt Lick, but are happy for their success, & glad there are so many other folks who do love it. ."},{"name":"Rocco's Tacos & Tequila Bar","address":"7468 W Sand Lake Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Excellent margaritas with house made sour mix.

I've been here many times and have tried many different items off the seasonal menu.  The seasonal menu always has something I want to try.  But what I love most is the appetizers, small plates and salads.  Sometimes you just aren't that hungry and sharing these items allows you to satisfy any little craving without leaving stuffed.  If you don't know what you want just talk to your server for suggestions.  The server with the curly brown beard (I forget his name) has recommended some great things to my wife and I.  His tip... Beer cheese soup and an order of spent grain bread.  AWESOME ON A COLD NIGHT!  \\n\\nNow as I have said I have been here many times.  Have I experienced a problem with an order?  Yes.  Twice.  \\n\\nThe first time an order of spent grain bread did not come out and when I asked about it midway through the entree the server went to find out what happened.  Now they were packed that night and the server comes back and tells us they are out and more needs to be made which will take awhile since the dough needs to proof.  We were asked if we would like something else buy we declined.  No big deal.  Next thing you know a manager comes out to apologize and immediately comps me a beer and offers to comp any other appetizer.  Since we weren't very hungry he recommended the soft pretzel.  It hit the spot.\\n\\nThe second time there was an issue it was under cooked chicken on a salad.  The server took it back immediately and a manager came out.  Before we said anything he apologized and comped my drink and the salad.  Now comping the salad is excepted but comping the drink was not necessary.  However it shows great customer service from people take pride in their restaurant.  \\n\\nAs someone who homebrews I really enjoy the beers here.  Ask to taste a beer before ordering a pint.  Not everyone enjoys all styles.  Personally I enjoy the cask ales.  They are just so different from what you can get elsewhere.  I have not sat in the bar area.

We ordered our drinks (2 cocktails and their blend of  coffee) both of which were quite good, then after several minutes our order for our meal was taken. We waited for about 40 minutes without any acknowledgement of the delay and then were finally told it would be out in 2 minutes (no apology was offered). It finally came about 10 minutes later. We ordered the hamburger, lamb crepettes (sp?), and the beef tongue hash. The Hamburger was quite good and cooked rare as requested, the lamb was not that flavorful and dressed with some old greens but it was fine, and the beef tongue hash was quite rich (as it should be) and egg cooked correctly so no complaints there. \\n\\nThe waiter asked us if the food was ok in a very defensive way knowing we were annoyed about the long delay to which we said it was fine but to ask us again after we had finished.

He called him a \\"fat f@!#\\" and \\"I'll take your fat a@@ outside right now and beat you up.\\" Everyone was stunned as he walked away and nothing happened for several minutes.

The first waitress I had complained  (rolling her eyes and gasping in exasperation) about the bags I had with me (I was on my way to the airport, and hoped to spend a few pleasant hours at a cafe).  The bags were small enough to carry on to an airplane, and fit under my seat, but she insisted on  moving me to a different table. A friend who came to join a few minutes later didn't even notice I had them with me.  We stayed about an hour and a half, during which time none of the tables around us (or my original table) were occupied; there were no space issues. \\n\\nFor some reason, we got a new waiter when my friend arrived (maybe the exasperation on the part of the first waitress was that she was covering for the scheduled waiter who came in late?)  He seemed awfully put-out to take our order, and seemed anxious to have our table empty.   He swapped our orders (gave me my friend's order, and him mine), which is no big deal.  But he felt a need to correct us, no, he was quite sure that he had it right.  We didn't see a lot to be gained by arguing with him, but we got a good chuckle out of it. \\n\\nI really don't know how someone can stay in this cafe and work.  That was exactly my plan when I went in, hoping to spend a couple hours working before heading to the airport.  I was made to feel so unwelcome that I headed out as soon as we finished breakfast, and went to the nearby Pavement cafe, where nobody complained about my bags, and while they made a mistake with my order, they cheerfully fixed it, and I was able to use the internet for a few hours in an engaging and vibrant atmosphere.  \\n\\nSorry Trident, I'll go somewhere else next time."},{"name":"Antico Pizza","address":"1093 Hemphill Ave NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I have spent two summers in Italy, and have never found authentic Italian pizza in the United States until my husband and I ate at Antico!

There were times when it felt like the line was never going to move again, but we did have the opportunity to speak with the couples in line around us. Eventually we got in, and the dining room is quite cramped. But there was something about it, some sort of vibe that you could tell that the food was being taken seriously.\\n\\nWe never got a menu when we sat down - there's a giant chalkboard on one side with the regular menu, and one on the other side with the specials. Also, there's one small paper menu outside, that you have time to read about fifty times before you get inside, so menus inside are completely irrelevant. I will say ths: Giacomo's has a simple menu. I think that's a good thing. There's nice variety on it, but not enough menu sprawl to be paralyzing.\\n\\nWe ordered a large calamari appetizer, and it was pretty good. It comes with some pepper slices deep fried with the squid. The flavor was good, but it was a tiny bit on the chewy side, so it was a tad overcooked. I would order it again, both to see if it they get it 100%, and because it was still good, especially with the sauce they bring it with. Also, the bread they bring out is decent, but nothing to go crazy over. The olive oil on the table is very good though, with that nice peppery edge that fresh olive oil tends to have. Bland crap from a chain it is not.\\n\\nSo, when our server - Tony - came by and asked us \\"What do you kids having for supper\\" I ordered the Frutti di Mare, and my wife ordered the Gnocci which was a special. We also both ordered a Chianti with dinner.\\n\\nBoth meals were fantastic. The seafood in my Frutti was cooked as well or better than any seafood I've ever had before, especially the scallops. My goodness, the scallops were beyond good. They were exceptional. I had it in the Giacomo's sauce, which was excellent, because it's lobster based. I ended up with a bonus lobster leg in my meal. Oh, darn. :-) My wife's meal was very very good, but I didn't have more than a bite or two, because I was so infatuated with mine.\\n\\nHere's the bottom line about Giacomo's for me. We ordered: Large Calamari, Frutti di Mare, Gnocci special and two glasses of wine. The total check was a reasonable $58. Let me repeat that: $58. In the North End. In Boston. Boston, Massachusetts. I cannot go to the Olive Garden and get pre-made and reheated food for that price. And Giacomo's is cranking it out in an open kitchen.\\n\\nThey don't serve dessert. They want your seat for the people still standing in line, so we went to Mike's. Perfect.\\n\\nThe service wasn't white-glove, but it was prompt, attentive and very inviting. I felt like I was eating in Tony's home - and that's a great feeling when everyone working at this particular house is uber-Italian. \\n\\nSo, while the price you pay for the food is tempered somewhat by the potentially enormous wait to get inside, you simply won't be disappointed. The value is incredible, and the food is incredible. The only thing that I would change is that I would ask for the Fra Diavolo and Giacomo sauce mix for my Frutti.

It's great that someone is always at the front desk! The elevator was tiny & was creeky, so we took the stairs the rest of the time. The bed was comfy, the curtains blocked out all the city lights at night which helped, & the hallways were really pretty decorated.

The Arena District had not yet gone in, let alone the Bridge.  Gallery Hop was still Columbus' best kept secret, and I just about lived at Barley's and The Coffee Table (may it rest in peace).  But once the floodgates opened and the numbers started rolling in, I pulled up stakes and ran for the hills.  Some of it was for good reason: I felt that it was a turning point for the Short North in that it finally gained proper recognition and capital for new startups, but with it came a vanilla-flavored hustle bustle that was a bit off-putting.  But with this transformation came a few notable businesses that reflect the quirky eclectic flavor of yesteryear.  Yes, Surly Girl, I'm looking at you.\\n\\nCharacter in a business is earned over time, piece by piece, and is demonstrated by the fact that there will never be another CBGB's and why Hard Rock Cafe expansion stores are such a joke.  In spite of this, Surly Girl's decor and layout does a pretty good job at approximating genuine character right out of the box.  Think two parts western and one part psychobilly, with feminine touches throughout.  Add to that some off the beaten path choices on the jukebox and yeah, I'd call that character.  Reminds me of Seattle's Lava Lounge.  A tight fit during prime time, so large groups may want to look elsewhere, but wonderfully cozy for 2-5.\\n\\nThe menu is decent, though a bit limited, and a tad overpriced.  My workaround is to focus more on the appetizers and impressive list of microbrews -I recommend Bell's Two Hearted Ale highly if you are a fan of IPAs.  And the waitstaff is surprisingly non-hipster; rather they are no-nonsense pros who know how to turn on the charm.\\n\\nThe bottom line: not as much a nightly hangout as a fun \\"on the way to\\" stopover.

The service here was flawless, but the food was just okay, except for a few stand out dishes.  I went here for restaurant week lunch with my parents and we all shared everything.\\n\\nService: The service here was impeccable.  Polite and accommodating servers, and we received gracious care when something terribly wrong with my dad's food.  They cleared the crumbs between lunch and dessert and water glasses were always filled with cold refreshing water.  My dad's meal was a complete disaster (more later) and they handled the situation with grace and kindness.  The waiters brought out fresh sides when they messed up his steak and the manager even came out to apologize when they messed it up a second time.  He was ever so apologetic and even comped the meal (as it should have been).  However, our extra meeting with the staff just confirmed how professional, kind, and on top of things they really are.\\n\\nFood: \\n\\nApps: My dad and I started with the spicy tortilla soup.  This soup had a good flavor, but was way too spicy, and I love spicy food.  I had one bit, and left the rest for my dad to nibble at.  He is more of a chili-head than I am and thoroughly enjoyed the soup.  But I repeat that I love spice, and can tolerate quite a lot, but this was just over the top.  So, I didn't get to enjoy my appetizer at all.  My moms Steak House Salad with House Vinaigrette was excellent however.  I had a few bites and the salad was mixed greens and quite flavorful with a delicious tangy vinaigrette on it.  There was the perfect amount of acid and salt in the dressing and a good amount of dressing on the salad without being over-dressed and soggy.  It was really one of the best simple salads I've had in a long time.\\n\\nEntrees:  I had the Sizzlin' Blue Crab Cakes: Two jumbo lump crab cakes served sizzling with lemon butter.  These were excellent, full of crab with barely any filler to speak of. In fact, I couldn't see any filler but I don't think it's possible to make crab cakes with just crab meat, but if so, they did it.  I did miss the lemon butter though, there was none on my plate, so there were just 2 crab cakes, no accompaniments, kind of a bummer because even though the crab cakes were so good, a sauce would have been nice to moisten them up a bit.  My parents both got Filet: The most tender cut of corn-fed Midwestern beef broiled expertly to melt-in-your-mouth.  Both were ordered medium-rare.  My mom's came out perfectly cooked and was juicy and delicious.  My dad's came out still mooing, it was literally cold in the middle it was so raw.  So, he sent it back.  When he got it back, the outside was cooked more, but the inside was still extremely rare.  Strike 2.  At this point my dad just ordered the crab cakes and enjoyed them just as much as I did.  However, to go to a steak house and not be able to receive a properly cooked steak that you wanted is a huge disappointment.  The staff throughout this ordeal were extremely gracious, brought out extra sides, and the manager came to speak to our table and apologize, he also comped my dad's meal, as it should have been, but a nice gesture none the less.  \\n\\nSides: Like any steakhouse, you get sides separately.  We got creamed spinach, garlic mashed potatoes, and the special sweet potato casserole for a $4 upcharge.  The creamed spinach, one of my favorites was a let down.  It was creamy, but so bitter that it negated any good taste the creamed part of the dish might have had.  The garlic mashed potatoes (another one of my favorites) were also pretty disappointing.  They tasted like powdered box potatoes, definitely not fresh, and there wasn't a hint of garlic to be tasted.  The sweet potato casserole, however, was yummy.  The sweet potatoes were smooth and luscious, with a mouth-watering brown sugar walnut topping, that made them sweet, but not over the top.  One of the best dishes of the night.\\n\\nDessert:  There was only one choice, Key Lime Cheesecake.  I don't like cheesecake, so I'm not a good judge of this, but I did have a bite for reviews sake.  It was okay, but not great, a little fake lime tasting and not super creamy.  Also, it round and about the size of a half dollar coin (a little bigger than a quarter), so there wasn't much even if it had been good.\\n\\nOverall, there were a few good dishes on the menu, but the bad outweighed the good.  My dad's experience with his steak really spoiled the lunch, even though the staff handled it extremely well.  I would not return here, even on restaurant week, as the food just wasn't that good in my opinion/  Also, the prices during the year are just astronomical for what you would be getting."},{"name":"Potluck Cafe","address":"7 Knapp St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Definitely some authentic Cantonese dishes with dirty cheap price in Boston.

Their service BLOWS! \\n\\n1 star off because their service is ridiculously slow. We're eating lobster rolls high in sodium and cholesterol so you know we're downing water like we had just journeyed through the Sahara desert. Our glasses were the size of my pinkie finger and it would take them at LEAST 20 minutes to refill our waters. \\n\\nTakes another 30 to get your food--which I can't totally be mad at because I'd like to think they're fetching the lobster from the sea and cooking it within that time frame.\\n\\n1 star off because of DANNY. I SEE YOU DANNY THE SERVER! I. SEE. YOU. I totally get it. Servers hate when other tables ask them or something when it's not their table. But come on bro. You could've said, \\"I'll let your server know.\\" Nope. Clearly us tourists are rude and unwelcomed so he thought it would be a good idea to LIE TO MY FACE that there wasn't any bread when I asked for another round of bread. So, PELASE MAKE SURE YOU ASK TO NOT GET SERVED BY DANNY. I guarantee that if he is a liar to me. He'll be a liar to you. Certainly won't give you the service experience you need. \\n**I know he lied to my face because when my server came I asked for bread and he gave it to me.**\\n\\nFOOD (4.5):\\n\\nI got the LOBSTER ROLL and in my opinion it isn't as great as Neptune Oyster's. Neptune's is bigger, the lobster is chunkier, and of course more buttery. \\n\\nUNI BRUCHETTA TOAST: This is AMAZING! If you are a fan of uni, I recommend this. Even if you are not (like me), I still recommend it. It is definitely a fun gastro/italian twist to preparing uni, and the dill sauce really helped balance out the strong uni taste. Some uni fans prefer to have uni pure. I defer to your preference. \\n\\nTUNA CRUDO: It is also AMAZING! The balsamic aioli sauce is really what takes the cake. I licked the plate clean of the sauce and I honestly loved it so much that I asked for extra sauce to dip in my bread that DANNY SAID WAS OUT OF.\\n\\nI appreciate our server Peter because he went the extra mile to give our table extra bread and extra aioli sauce. So thank you Peter! (He also gave us recommendations of places to go)\\n\\nDefinitely a great bougie, hip place to go for a date or with a group of friends for an occasion. \\n\\nExpect the wait to be an hour, but all s good because I recommend going down the street to Lucky's to grab a drink and enjoy jazz music.\\n\\nYou could totally sue me for high expectations but the service standards in Vegas-- even at the most local restaurants-- are phenomenal.

In addition to the filet classic meal ($49), my crab cakes appetizer ($20) came to the table with the sauce still bubbling hot. My Caesar salad was scant on tomatoes and croutons, but the lettuce and cheese were ample, and the dressing was rich without being overpowering. \\n\\nOrdering my filet medium-well did not compromise on its tenderness at all, though next time I'll know to order the filet medium. My side of green beans was accompanied by large cloves of roasted garlic.\\n\\nThe standard \\"Classic Meal\\" dessert is key lime cheesecake, but they wisely give you the option to substitute any other dessert on the menu for an additional $4.

I was curious to try something I had not heard of, so I ordered the \\"Satan Gold\\", described as having a \\"hoppy, toasty finish\\".  That was a mistake.  My wife ordered a \\"Fruli\\", also a mistake.  Fruli was listed under Witbiers, but they neglected to mention that it is beer mixed with strawberry juice.  So, nothing like a witbier.  Fortunately it was okay despite tasting much like a wine cooler.  The Satan Gold, on the other hand, was not okay.  Satan Gold bills itself as a strong golden ale, a style pioneered by the excellent beer Duvel.  My first sip of Satan was so watery as to elicit surprise, I had to try again- yes, it really is that thin and void of flavor.  Wow, this was truly a poor beer.  Not contaminated, not \\"off\\", simply little to no character beyond the slightest hint of a Belgian yeast strain and a lot of fizz.  \\n  So the waitress came around, and asked how the Satan is.  I replied that it wasn't very good.  She then asks what i didn't like about it.  In an attempt to impress upon her that I was not an inexperienced beer drinker, I mentioned that I had brewed beer professionally for years.  I explained that I was disappointed they had taken up valuable space on their beer list for such a bland beer when there were so many excellent representatives of the style.  The waitress was floored.  She said \\"oh, it's a great beer, and we have lots of fans, but can I bring you something else?\\"  I ordered a Rochefort 8, which she promptly ran off to fetch\\n  She returns not with Rochefort but instead a small sample of their house draft beer, \\"Sham Bar Ale\\".  She said that the bartender didn't want to open another beer I wouldn't like, and to see what I thought of their house ale.  It was as bland as the Satan, but lighter in body.  I told her so, \\"This is bland too.\\"  She then said something to the effect of \\"Oh, so that's how you are\\" and then informed me in a scolding manner that \\"I would have to pay for the next bottle they opened\\".  Really, that's how it works?  At that point I had no interest in supporting this establishment any further, even if it meant no beer with dinner.  \\n  Dinner, by the way, was pretty disappointing too.  The frites were mediocre and the traditional mayonnaise accompaniment was replaced with a lackluster anchovy sauce.  Various components of our dishes were either over- or under-seasoned, and the lamb shank was quite dry.  We also found the atmosphere stuffy, loud, pretentious, and garish.  And way too expensive for all that.\\n\\nP.S.  I did some research (belatedly) and found that Satan Gold is the lowest-rated Belgian strong golden ale on Ratebeer.com (22nd percentile) and also holds the distinction of having the briefest description of any beer in Michael Jackson's \\"Great Beers of Belgium\\": \\"malty and slightly sticky\\".  Fruli, by the way, landed in the 24th percentile on Ratebeer.  In my one trip to Belgium (post-Sham bar), I noticed that Satan Gold was only on a few beer lists I saw, and only at the establishments with exhaustive selections.  I'm pretty sure that's not because it's a rare treat.  More like it's rarely enjoyed."},{"name":"Chung Shin Yuan","address":"183 California St","city":"Newton","stars":"3.5","text":"I love this place, great flavor and it's high end Asia cuisine!"},{"name":"Super Burrito Express","address":"10506 SE 42nd Ave","city":"Milwaukie","stars":"3.5","text":"Sorry guys.

Got to love a place like that.\\n\\nIndeed there is one of the largest selections of craft beers I've ever seen at a restaurant. This is probably to compensate for the fact that they don't have a full liquor license. As a result, they are allowed to offer just one alcoholic specialty drink per evening. The night we were there (the day before New Year's Eve) the special was a sweet peach ice tea with vodka (a little light on the vodka), but tasty nonetheless.\\n\\nThe menu is not much like anything else in Boston right now. Their take on which came first--the chicken or the egg, with deviled eggs stuffed with chicken liver mousse--was clever and tasty. Their cornbread with maple butter is as good, if not better, than promised. Cornmeal crusted oyster salad is good, but just not exciting--a salad with about eight oysters on it. A standout main course is the duck leg confit with oyster (again, corn meal crusted) etouffee. With my back to the window, it felt as though I could have been in New Orleans.  \\n\\nThe desserts were not run of the mill either. A softball sized red velvet whoopie pie was tasty, although a bit on the dry side. The peanut butter pie was surprisingly good, tasting more of bananas than peanut butter, which pleased those of us who do not like peanut butter in our desserts.

It's in a great location in Inman Park so it's easy to get to whether you are driving or walking on the BeltLine. \\n\\nThe bar has more seating than you'd initially think when you walk in. The main bar area is fairly narrow with several booths and room to sit by the bar. Behind that main area is a whole other seating area with more tables. The ambiance is fairly dive-bary. Though there is definitely some ambient noise from other patrons and the music playing, I've never had a problem hearing the group of people I'm with.\\n\\nWhat's really nice is that the Albert has all the cheap but delicious beers that you go to a dive-bar for but they also have a really great list of cocktails, such one with gin and elderflower. All of the cocktails are less than $10 for the most part. \\n\\nThe Albert does offer a decent food menu with options that range from wings to hot dogs to salads. Last time I was there I got the \\"Albert Burger\\"...I'm a sucker for anything with pimento cheese on it... and a side of the mac and cheese. The burger itself was okay...nothing amazing but nothing bad. The mac and cheese I was less of a fan of (but to admit I am a tad of a mac and cheese snob when it comes to ATL restaurants). The mac and cheese was kind of watery and very reminiscent of just plain old Kraft out of the box. Overall I felt kind of \\"meh\\" about the food.

When I saw the bartender I did have a brief flash of hope that he'd yank me across the bar and ravish me in a historical-romance-type-fashion.  Alas, all he did was ask me what I wanted to drink.  \\n\\nI ordered the chicken egg rolls and my friend ordered the pulled pork sandwich with french fries.  The chicken egg rolls were good and the orange sauce that came with them was a good offset to the slight spice of the egg rolls. I ate one of my friend's french fries, and they were yummy. (I forgot to ask my friend if he liked his sandwich. My bad.  But he did eat it all.)\\n\\nWhen I first arrived, I liked the music in the bar.  It reminded me of what I think you'd hear in an after-hours spot in the 1950s.  But as the evening grew late, it got louder and there was more rock music which made it hard to talk and hear. \\n\\nThere are two rooms in The Albert.  The room on the right has a couple of pool tables, and the room on the left has booths along the side of the wall.  There are a couple of high-top tables as well.

I don't go to any bars enough to have \\"reg status\\" and always wonder at such establishment stalwarts.  \\n\\nThe only downside to The Albert is the smoke.  I'm not a smoker and when someone lit up at the bar, I couldn't breathe. Thankfully, the smoker could see how choked up I was because he moved the cigarette so that the smoke didn't waft into my face, and I was grateful.

The pizzas were incredible; we got the governatore (sweet and salty all in one) and the margherita (a delicious take on a classic pie). But what blew us out of the water was the rigatoni we ordered. With a couple of different types of mushrooms, this pasta is probably the best I've ever had. It was creamy and tasty but not heavy or overbearing.

I don't know where to start with this. For the second year in a row, we've celebrated our anniversary here. We went for the 6 course chef's tasting menu both times.

Just put your little palette in Chef Maw's hands and let him delight you. You'll wind up trying something new and unexpected and you'll love it all. \\n\\nUpon making our reservation, we let the hostess know Brendan has a gluten allergy and that we wanted the tasting menu. Craigie was beyond accommodating. Here is what we had:\\n- Three bites on one plate: squid noodles in an Asian vinaigrette; house smoke waloo; salmon rillette with caviar and micro-greens.\\n- Tuna sashimi with avocado and sugared lemon\\n- Wild Australian Travalo (I tried Googling this fish, but couldn't find it) cooked in chicken schmaltz (fat) with a roe and horseradish mayonnaise. And on top of all that, chicken schmaltz powder which feels like confectioner sugar but tastes like the best part of the chicken. This fish was caught that morning and you could still taste the seawater.\\n- Soft-shell crab tempura over pureed stinging nettles and white beans. For such a exquisite dish, it was recommended that we just use our hands. It was Brendan's first time having soft-shell crab and now he loves it. Also, stinging nettles!\\n- Wild mushroom ragout with blood sausage and poached farm fresh egg. I normally do not like wet eggs. But this year, and last (served with farrow), I have thoroughly enjoyed this egg. Don't ask me why.\\n- Veal two ways: sweetbread; veal loin wrapped in pork fat over greens. This is one of those times when you just gotta eat what you're given and ask questions later (recommended for any tasting menu). I enjoyed the taste of this and that may not have happened had I known what sweetbreads were.\\n- Mango sorbet with fennel for me; blackberry sorbet with candied kumquat for Brendan.\\n- Sour milk panna cotta with housemade granola and brown sugar powder (made via the same process they use to make the chicken schmaltz powder). I LOVED this dessert. I could not get over the creaminess of the panna cotta. Brendan had rice pudding with pina colada sorbet.\\n- (The thickest) hot chocolate (I have ever had) flavored with Ancho (?) chili.\\n\\nWhen it comes to cocktails here, you have to order an Old Cuban, a refreshing rum drink with mint. Since this was our anniversary (and we had gift cards), we also decided to get a bottle of wine. The wine list is extensive, so I'd recommend asking the server (and feel free to say that you have a budget. They can work with that info!).

For $10 you got a huge amount of prosciutto di parma.  It came with fresh mozzarella that you could tell was homemade and arugula.

It's a neat concept, but I'm not sure it totally worked.  The chefs were very busy all night.  We couldn't really interact with them and it made it hard to talk to the servers because they were in a rush to get out of the way and it was kind of loud.  I think I would've preferred to sit at a table and really discuss the food since we felt timid critiquing the dishes in front of the chefs who were preparing them.\\n\\nI liked a lot about the meal.  The dedication to fresh ingredients is evident not only in the quality of the dishes, but also in the preparation that highlights the individual components with simple preparations.  The quality from dish to dish was very high, there's obviously a lot of skill in the kitchen.\\n\\nAll that said, I had some issues with the meal.  We ordered the full chef's tasting, and it was A LOT of food.  Too much really.  I've had meals with 20+ courses and not felt as full as I did at Craigie.  I think this had a lot to do with the arc of the meal.  Many of the early dishes were spreads or charcuterie that they served with bread.  Even the fish was served on a bed of cous cous.  We were pretty full when the last dishes came and they were total overload.  First they served a steak and eggs dish that, though delicious, really needed some bread to sop up the creamy eggs.  Then they served four, fairly large chunks of quail with a side of bone marrow that we ordered extra (not knowing it would come at the end).  The marrow was excellent, but much too heavy to serve at the end of the meal, along with a quail entree, and naturally with a side of toast to spread it on.  I've never had marrow served after the appetizers and this really was a detriment.  I was too full (of bread) to really enjoy the last couple dishes, and honestly, I wanted nothing to do with the three dessert courses they brought out.  I was basically eating out of politeness at that point (another issue with being next to the kitchen).\\n\\nNonetheless, the cuisine is hitting at a high level.  There were some real highlights to the meal, but if I'm to return I'd do the smaller chef's tasting and avoid any of the add-ons (though the locally foraged mushrooms were terrific).  I should also mention that I thought the meal was reasonably priced and the service was excellent.

The window sills, windows, booths, table cloths, etc. had not been cleaned or even dusted in quite a while. Coming from a restaurant background this isn't something I'm comfortable with. If this is what they are comfortable presenting to their customers, what kind of care do they take where the food is prepared that we don't see?\\nThe restaurant was also very hot and humid and the water served was warm.  Perhaps they were having issues with AC or lack of ice after the storm?  While unpleasant, especially coupled with the heat of the food we wanted to enjoy, this didn't factor into my review. We just ordered less than normal and left as quickly as possible due to the uncomfortable temperature.  Maybe just a fluke that day.  What does factor is the cleanliness though- it is clearly a habit and how they operate. Even the dishes coming from the kitchen were served sloppily with food running down the sides, torn tinfoil broil base, etc.  The chutney dish- I didn't even want to consider the last time it had been cleaned.\\nSo, the food tasted good, no one got sick, if I had ordered takeout I wouldn't have known and been happy with it.  \\nBut I didn't- and if an establishment shows lack of care for their restaurant- why should I?\\nIf it was an inexpensive food stall or street food- that's one thing.

I initially recommended to so many friends and coworkers. I'm giving a 3-star, however, because each time I have came (about 3-4 times) I am put off by the waiters. The tipping point would be within a 7 party table. For those that have been servers before, it is expected that a large top table will take some effort. Naturally, one side needs something and the other side something else all at the same time. Essentially, this is what happened at our table and unfortunately, the waiter came with attitude. One of us asked for a spoon and the response was a diva remark \\"Can I get a minute please\\"?. Unappreciated, I quickly responded to it. \\"You don't need to get an attitude\\". He went on to explain that well, he was supposed to get off at 3 but was still there and thus my concluding comment was \\"And what does that have to do with us?\\". It could be that he thought no one would catch on his remark of frustration since the table was speaking in Hindi, however, we certainly did and I am too honest and offended to let it slide.\\n\\nThis was the tipping (or non tip should I say) point.

For Sushi Special, you get to choose 3 items out of 30 rolls/cones and a bowl of miso soup for $6.95. I chose a Spicy California Roll, Dynamite Roll and Chicken (Teriyaki) Roll. Miso soup tasted pretty good, and I was glad that it wasn't salty or bland. Spicy California Roll was nothing but a California Roll (crab meat and cucumber inside) topped with spicy mayo. It doesn't mean that it was missing on something. It still tasted pretty good. Dynamite Roll was rather below average because the size of prawn tempura was too small to taste anything. The batter was thicker than the prawn itself.

What i do have a problem with is multiple members of waitstaff walking by you while waiting at the hostess stand,  crossing by without acknowledging your presence (I've never even gotten an \\"I'll be with you in a moment\\" type of response from a server). The most recent time I went, my friend and I waited more than fifteen minutes for the server to pick up the check once we had put the card in (and I made sure the card was completely sticking out so it'd be visible). The restaurant was not that busy at the time but the server was busy alternating between polishing glasses and texting (not okay at any establishment I've ever worked in, by the way). Boo. Management definitely needs to increase training of their servers. I'd come here all the time if I thought I'd get halfway decent service."},{"name":"Aquitaine","address":"500 Legacy Pl","city":"Dedham","stars":"3.5","text":"In addition to realy great gnocchi, they have a really good brunch.

Smoked meats should be able to stand on their own without sauce.  My suspicions were correct.  I got the combo platter with the ultimate testing choices: pulled pork, brisket and ribs.  The pulled pork was just saucy, no smoke flavor to the meat and no bark. The brisket had no smoke ring on it and while it had less sauce so I could taste it, it had very little smoke flavor.  The ribs were not bad, good bite to them yet didn't fall off the bone (a good thing).  However, they were drenched in sauce.  It was almost unbearable and required that I get a napkin to wipe them off.  The brunswick stew isn't bad but also is missing the smoke flavor that should be coming from the pulled pork.

Ambience was fun. Decor was authentic feeling but made more modern than traditional Spanish. The welcome was excellent. They were genius to create a wrap around patio given how popular patio dining is in Atlanta and Inman park, and they've created a lovely one. We sat in a perfect spot right on N. Highland with a perfect people watching view, but could still see the inside and hear the music. The music was eclectic and not too loud. They actually had Cake playing when we walked in. Our server, Diego, really knew the restaurant and menu, as he was from one of the Connecticut locations and quite expert. \\n\\nAs for the wine, we chose a Rioja (one of my favs) with a great price and it was perfect, delicious! I am not a wine expert, but their list is long enough for any connoisseur.\\n\\nWe chose 6 tapas including mostly vegetarian options (yes, authentic vegetarian friendly tapas). Mushrooms with goat cheese were a 10/10, Spanish tortilla (a.k.a. omelet), patatas bravas, roasted pumpkin, and citrus soaked olives. The roasted pumpkin was a great and unique idea, and well executed (I was skeptical of pumpkin tapas, but my wife loves pumpkin so we tried it). The patatas bravas were the best I'd ever had. Not so for my wife, she had one better once before, in Barcelona, Spain!  The gambas (shrimp) were recommended by Diego, our server, and were as good as advertised. They accidentally brought us a second serving of patatas bravas, and when we pointed it out they left it anyway.\\n\\nFinally desert. I am part-Spanish (father's side) and even I recognize that the Spanish are not the best at deserts (there are a few good ones but it's not their forte), but we had a dulce de leche crepe that was ridiculously good.\\n\\nWe spoke to the manager and told him how much we loved the place. We like a block away and plan to go back again and again. \\n\\nThe only downside - the prices are not great. For two people we spent almost $100 (with tip), though we could have chosen more carefully and spent less. Also, we ordered them using a \\"combo\\" price that was meant for the heavier tapas; the vegetarian ones are much cheaper. This caused us to accidentally over-pay by $20 or so. That was really the only negative. We felt that we got what we payed for, a wonderful evening and fun and delicious dining experience.

I spent several days in the real Barcelona, Spain last summer eating paella and drinking sangria like it was going out of style and I have to say - Barcelona Atlanta comes pretty close to the real deal. We sat in their tapas lounge inside but they also offer al fresco dining on their wrap-around patio. The interior held a warm industrial ambiance with plenty of wood and urban accents - fits right in with the contemporary Inman Park.\\n\\nI immediately flocked to the traditional dishes I enjoyed last summer but the four of us ordered enough to feed an army and I didn't taste anything I didn't love.\\n\\nThey had a pretty extensive wine menu and the waiters were happy to help us navigate. I opted for the sangria and was not disappointed!\\n\\nWe were practically lusting over the entire menu so we ordered way more than we could handle. I will say these are true tapas - definitely not enough for a meal unless you order a few. My favorites included Patatas Bravas - potatoes in a spicy tomato sauce drizzled with garlic aioli and Gambas al Ajillo - shrimp saut√©ed in garlic, sherry, and hot pepper.\\n\\nYou simply can't go to a restaurant named Barcelona without ordering paella, am I right?! Emily and I split an order of the Mariscos Paella and this was the stuff dreams are made of. It was a traditional seafood paella with prawns, squid, mussels and clams.

The salsa is not your \\"normal\\" salsa you would get in a Mexican restaurant.  It is complete liquid with no chunks of veggies in it and the color is kind of an off putting yellowish brown color.

The Salty Pig does not take reservations, unless it is for groups of 6+, but I decided to send an email to see if there's any possibility of making a reservation for two. It was my bf's birthday and I wanted to surprise him to a nice dinner. The manager, Ines, was kind enough to make an exception and even told our server beforehand that it was his birthday!  The best part was that they gave us a complimentary dessert on the house with a candle. So sweet of them! He was totally surprised! Do I get the sweetest/sneakiest girlfriend award?\\n\\nThe food is here definitely savory, delicious, and definitely worth the price! As a grad student on a budget, I found the portions to be extremely generous and we were almost full after we ate 3/4 of our charcuterie board. As told by our server, you should get any of the items that have \\"SP\\" written next to it, as that item is made in house! I also love the sides that came with it, like the pickles. I'm usually not a fan of pickles, but the way it was marinaded/seasoned made it so yummy! It balances the cheese and cured meats so perfectly. I also recommend ordering the jalapeno and fig jellies to harmonize the plate!\\n\\nWe managed to stuff our face with The Salty Pig pizza... oohhh the crust was so fluffy and yummy, and I love how unique the pizza was. Rather than using tomato sauce, they used a mustard base. It was topped with prosciutto, salami, a cooked egg, and arugula. Yum! Paired with a glass of beer, you have striked gold!\\n\\nKeep in mind the food does take awhile to come out... but that's ok, with good company, you wouldn't mind the wait! Beware, the food is a bit on the salty side (I found the additional seasoning on the meats a bit unnecessary), but afterall it is called The Salty Pig, haha. So that's why I recommend the jellies to go along with your food.\\n\\nTo top off our dinner, or server surprised my boyfriend with a chocolate cake and lavender ice cream. Omg, the lavender ice cream was AMAZING! The flavor was intense and I've never had lavender ice cream like that.

The place has a great neighborhood vibe, full of very good looking Cape Verdean men laughing and having a grand time. But we felt quite welcome. The waitress was a sweetheart. But be forewarned; service out of the kitchen can be slow. You just have to go with the attitude that this is an upstart neighborhood ethnic hangout, not some traditional professional restaurant operation.

This is true whether one is talking about cocktails, comforting pork dishes, sashimi or service.\\n\\nI've been dining at Craigie since it originally opened in 2003 at its original location on Craigie Street.  So this review is based on eight years of experience and I dare estimate 125-150+ meals at Craigie over that period of time.  But you don't have to take my word for it.  In addition to the fact that his restaurant is absolutely packed at 9pm on a Sunday night (when you can hear crickets at many other establishments), Chef/owner Tony Maws has recently been awarded the James Beard Award for Best Chef Northeast (an award for which he has been nominated since 2009) and is regularly lauded in local, national and even international media as a chef who always offers the absolute best for his loyal patrons.  If that's not enough to convince you, then you should have a chat with some of the notable chefs that have dined at Craigie like El Bulli's Ferran Adria.  If Julia Child was still alive and residing in Cambridge, I could easily imagine her sitting at the end of the bar, fingers and lips wrapped around a Craigie burger!\\n\\nSo much can be said and has been said about the food at Craigie, but so much more needs to be said about the people who make the magic happen at Craigie.  If you've never had the pleasure of chatting with members of Maws' fantastic staff (or Maws himself), I suggest that you do.  They come from varied pasts such as 3-Michelin star restaurants and local Cambridge eateries, but they all bring a single,  uncompromising level of service to your table that is without parallel in Boston, to say nothing of beyond the environs of Boston.  Their care for the customer is genuine and it shows.\\n\\nMy advice to you: go in with all guns blazing and order the 6 or 10 course tasting menu.  Maybe open with a cocktail or two and throw in a bottle of wine.  Over the years, I've brought in dozens of friends, family members and colleagues for this experience and all were absolutely delighted.  Without prompting, many of them still talk about the happy experience months and years after the fact.

No, Joanne Chang doesn't work here and you can't get your Half Double Decaffeinated Half-Caf with a twist of lemon (tip of the hat to Steve Martin.)\\n\\nOh, and if you're looking for a good bagel in Boston, I'm sympathetic, but you're already fighting an uphill battle my friend.\\n\\nNo, this right here is a local bakery that's been serving local customers for a long while.  Customers who probably like that it's had the same decor for decades.  Customers who have their favorites and like to stop by and get those favorites and not have to wonder whether this bake shop is doing something with Meyer Lemon like every other fancy bake shop just because they saw it last night on Food Network.  Or Bravo.  Or read that Martha Stewart uses it.\\n\\nThis is a bakery that makes great donuts.  And I'm going to repeat that: Great Donuts.  The best I've ever had in Boston.  Very likely the best I've ever had anywhere.\\n\\nThey are light, but not too light.  Sweet, but not too sweet.  The cake donuts get that great crispy-crunch taste when you bite into them.  The marshmallow creme donuts are classics, like what I used to have at my Grandmother's kitchen table in Brighton on Sunday mornings.  The Strawberry frosted are beautiful and simple and cheerful.\\n\\nThe Maple Frosted donuts, drizzled with chocolate frosting, are among the best things in the world.  They are worth a trip all the way over there.\\n\\nThe rest of their baked goods are between decent and good.   The jelly rolls are a tasty throwback, the half-moons are respectable, the cookies are pretty good.  But if you go there, go for the donuts.\\n\\nOhlin's is the perfect example of \\"it is what it is.\\"  It's a local place that makes perfect donuts.  If you don't like what they have, it's because you wanted them to be something they aren't.  And I will always love them for that...being what they are and not trying to be what they aren't.  \\n\\n(And if they aren't what you want, there's an Athan's in one direction and a Whole Foods in another.

Crowds of people linger on the sidewalk with their faces pressed against the warm windows, counting down the moments until they too can enjoy the large plates of succulent pasta.  While on a recent business trip, I thought an unseasonably warm Monday evening would be the perfect occasion to brave the potential line.  I was shocked when I arrived and was informed of the 25 minute wait on such a typically slow weeknight evening.\\n\\nWhen my brother and I were finally ushered into the cramped space, we were stuck with the only free table, right in front of the doorway.  The tiny dining room was overwhelmingly loud, making it hard to hold a conversation.  In addition, the daunting line of patrons kept the servers busily dashing all about the space.  My chair was constantly getting knocked into, and each time a new group of diners entered or exited, I was hit with a blast of cold air from outside.  The rude staff and constant activity was distracting and stress-inducing, which tainted the enjoyability of meal.\\n\\nAs if that was not enough, our nasty waiter had forgotten to put in our order, causing us to linger at our table longer than most.  He did apologize and grant us a free bruschetta, but that did little to ease my anxiety.  \\n\\nOur entrees were rather tasty, but the cuisine was still overrated in my opinion.  The Fruitti Di Mare only contained a few shrimp, scallops, and clams, but was heavily induced with calamari and mussels.  The fresh shellfish was fantastic and was served over perfectly cooked pasta, but its red sauce was bland, dry, and scarce on the plate.  What could have been a typical Chicken Marsala was jazzed up by added strands of spicy prosciutto and plump, fresh mushrooms.  This added kick was much appreciated, but sorely missed on the accompanying side of pasta, which was mismatched with a marinara sauce.  \\n\\nGiacomo's provided a meal full of fresh, home-style Italian flare.  However, its uncomfortable space and tense dining conditions should discourage you from joining the lengthy line.

I don't eat hamburger, so I substitute chicken for the hamburger.  It's only an extra 50 cents.  The chicken is now VERY tough and chewy.  The texture is just deplorable.  I have tried the chicken sandwiches 3x this summer, and I'm done, and will not be trying it anymore.  The last time my dining companion I went, we both both ordered chicken sandwiches, and he had a huge piece of gristle in the middle of his sandwich.

Sadly, the examples of greatness in the under $10 burger category are shrinking it seems, or maybe it was never that strong to begin with. Options are limited for the classic burger and fries combo, even more so when you take into consideration my ridiculous standards. Estelle's, right on the corner of Mass Ave and Tremont, has East Coast Grill alum Eric Gburski at the helm, and a Southern-tinted menu to boot. Although they tout the lunch menu to be a \\"daytime burger joint\\" there are surprisingly very few twists and turns or options to an otherwise pretty basic burger looking menu. There is only one beef based burger (two if you count the \\"double trouble,\\" essentially just a double burger with extra cheese) to go along with a turkey, catfish and vegan burger option, not exactly pushing the limits on all things burger if you asked me. True to form, I order the the Estelle's House Burger, a very straight-forward sounding sandwich with American cheese, lettuce, tomato, onion and house-made bread and butter pickles. Served with house cut fries, it's the basic burger model in the most basic of ways, but for $7.95, how can you complain?\\n\\nThe first thing I noticed was how similar this burger looks to the iconic Shake Shack burger, no problem there; a trend that more and more restaurants seem to be doing these days but not a lot of them are really trying to bring anything different to the party. Much like the popular burger at Abigail's (another East Coast alum in the kitchen there, Chef Jason Lord) this burger certainly looks the part of the typical griddled burger, but it's what's inside that counts. Starting at the top, a very fresh, soft and squishy Martin's potato bun holds it all together, it's heavily buttered and toasted, treated the best way a bun can be treated. There is quite the abundance of lettuce, tomato and raw onion, which are easy to pluck off since I don't find they add much value to the overall burger. The tomato is most notably a disappointment; it's mealy and tastes more like an out of season winter tomato than the in season right now flavor one would expect in August. The patty is thin like all good griddled patties are, it's got a hint of a crust and is sort of close to being on the dry side and also in need of more salt. The beefiness is modest, and overall too shy on the big flavors I was hoping for. However, the American cheese has a lovely melt, creating an even lovelier sauce in a way that only American can do, creating a lush, creaminess that is sorely needed. Three sauces come along for the ride: a mild, medium and hot sauce that all appear to be mayo-based and are fairly standard across the board, with nibbles of Sriracha and Russian dressing as basic influences and ingredients. French Fries appear to be fantastic, but an initial poke yields a flabby fry that begs to be crispier. They might need more salt but the skin-on, legit potato flavor is pronounced and not a total bummer.\\n\\nOverall, after dismissing the majority of the lettuce, tomato and onion, the burger and bun are a good fit and it's a mostly enjoyable product. It may have been nice to add more of a Southern flair or do something different to stand out, but Estelle's went with the most basic burger possible. Its biggest benefit is the price tag, there aren't enough faults to be fully dismissive, it's got some good flavor mostly coming from the bun and the cheese and the sauces are a nice touch, but in a world where beef is king and fries are the queen, they fall a tad short on overall burger respectability."},{"name":"Raglan Road Irish Pub","address":"1640 E Buena Vista Dr","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"Had a 9:30 reservation.

I told our waiter and he said they'll make me another one, told him to just wrap it up to go. He returns 10 minutes later and says sorry they already turn the grill off. The waiter offered us desert instead, I asked for a brownie sundae and received a pumpkin cream dessert that didn't taste good at all.

I also did not mind the slow service or the limited menu items.  Several things on the menu were not available.  Here's the thing, though...I didn't think the food warranted more than 3 stars.

She might have various people step in and help from time to time, but it's her deal and often times she's doing everything from taking orders to cooking to cleaning to settling the check.

Even if you can't find a spot close buy, enjoy the walk and see all the interesting stores and people as you walk to the bar. \\n\\nINTERIOR: From the outside, it will seem like the place is tiny.  It's a part of a huge building and the entrance (front part) of the restaurant looks like a very narrow strip of a big building. Even when you walk in, it feels small... but as you walk in further, you'll notice there are a lot more spaces in the back and plenty of tables and booths. But as you walk along side the bar to get to the back, your attention will be grabbed by its 30+ draft beers. It's quite a sight and the beer lover in my got super excited when I saw that.\\n\\nBEER: Expect 400+ choices, each bottle comes with its own pint glass and ton of high gravity (7% + )  beer selections for as low as $4 bucks. Drink away and you will not be robbed!\\n\\nFOOD: I loved their number of items on their menu. It wasn't too little and it wasn't too much. They also have a separate page for specials to choose from. On my visit, our table ordered the Belgian Fries to start with, Buffalo Po Boy, Fish and Chips (fries), and Shrimp and Grits. \\n\\nWe ordered the fries as appetizers because the pics looked amazing. However, if you are planning to order fish and chips or the po boy... I recommend ordering a different appetizer since your main entrees will come with plenty of the same fries. We had a fries overload at our table.\\n\\nThe Po Boy was on the above average size. A solid amount of fried shrimp covered in buffalo sauce (a bit soggy so the fried batter fell right off without any crunch) and the bread it came on was not your typical sub bread. I enjoyed it very much as it paired nicely with my beer. \\n\\nThe Shrimp and Grits and the Fish and Chips were slightly under the average portion size (compared to the po boy). Smaller portion but both decent. Other than that, not much to say because I didn't taste these dishes but from my friends, they both seemed to enjoy it.\\n\\nSERVICE: Not too intrusive, came just the right amount, refilled our glasses at the perfect times, and had a solid knowledge of the beer menu which seems to have over 400+ items on it. Ordered per his recommendations on food pairings and they complimented each other very well. \\n\\n\\nFor a very down to earth, old pub feel (wooden booths, old paper menus, and pint size mason jars for water/ mixed drinks (each beer comes with it's own glass with the beer's logo on it), definitely check this place out. I believe it's currently listed as #6 for Best Matches Restaurant in Atlanta on Yelp and there's a reason why it's up there. \\n\\nGo Go Go!"},{"name":"Antico Pizza","address":"1093 Hemphill Ave NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I've traveled around the world eating pizza and this place is still in my top 3 favorite places.

My companions got sandwiches and soups, and there was praise for all of that from them.\\n\\nNow on to the pasta, which is probably a less frequently purchased meal. It lasted two meals for me, and in the end I was full from both. The pasta was cooked perfectly. Now this is a big issue with me. I hate HATE HATE overcooked, chewy pasta. Since I know how it should taste (toothsome, al dente), it really bothers me when a place can't cook noodles properly. It's not that hard, and it actually takes less time to cook them if you're doing the proper time. So as far as pasta, it was good pasta. Really good pasta, even. I was actually impressed.

Not that that it was bad, it was quite good, i just would have preferred it a little jucier. The house salad was quite decent: served with a nice blue cheese with real chunks of blue cheese. The chocolate mousse cheesecake I also found disappointing. Hardly worth eating considering all the calories.  I was very impressed with the mashed potatoes and the side of creamed spinach, however. I loved the super hot  plates (500 degrees, I believe). They kept the steak warm throughout the meal. I might consider going back here for the steak and the sides. However, I would certainly skip dessert. Also, the decor did not live up to my expectations. I thought it would be a bit nicer, but it was very generic. It's nice if you get a table overlooking the graveyard, although, perhaps some might find that kind of creepy. I don't know. Service was typical of most places at restaurant week: rushed.

I mean, how could I not when the lowest rating here on Yelp was a 4 star?!\\n\\nThe menu was broad enough to cover all the comfort food favorites. I settled for the grilled cheese sandwich with the tomato soup. I even opted for bacon on the sandwich--a rarity for me but I figured one strip of bacon won't do too much damage. Talk about grease overload! Oil was seeping out of the sandwich as the server placed it in front of me. I could only finish half of the sandwich before pushing my plate away. \\n\\nSASarah ordered the Cool Columbus Veggie, the other option I was eyeing on the menu.

Zeek's Meat Chili 3-way looked anything but appetizing, but the portion size sure was quite reasonable.\\n\\nStill hungry yet on the verge of feeling somewhat sick from all the fat ingested within a 20-minute sitting, I ordered the chocolate cayenne cupcake. I've heard friends rave repeatedly about SGS' heavenly cupcakes that I only hoped it would make up for the rest of my lunch. Again, I was disappointed by my dessert.

I'll never forget when my mom ventured downtown to buy my studded belt at the since-closed S&M shop Throb.  It's not quite so fringey anymore, but what's great about little 5 is that it's still pretty unpretentious.   You don't feel like everyone's too punk rock or hip.  It's a pretty good mix of folks.  And Porter was no exception.\\n\\nI met up here with my wife, my brother and his wife, my sister visiting from New York, and her friend who recently moved here from NYC and knows not a soul.  Being the only one who \\"claims\\" to know this city there was a lot riding on my choice, real or imagined.  And I was glad to finally visit the place with all hype I've been hearing.  I'm a definite beer snob and there are far too few places for those of my kind.\\n\\nOne thing i'll say off the bat - this place is much bigger than it seems.  If you poke your head in and think \\"too busy\\", make sure you head toward the back since the restaurant is shaped like and L, with the majority of the seating in the back.\\n\\nI recently read a review for the Porter (creative something or other) that suggested (or downright protested) that the salt and vinegar pop-corn here simply must be a crude joke.  If that is the case then it's my favorite joke, and i want to hear it twice.  We ordered the popcorn as an app (two, seriously) as well as the stuffed jalapenos.  I think you know how i feel about the popcorn already, and the jalapenos were pretty dope, too.  My sister has already attempted to replicate the pop corn in NYC to no avail.  Malt vinegar, you are not the secret ingredient.\\n\\nOur service was polite and relatively attentive.  We were being social on a weekday so i didn't need someone offering me another beer every time my glass was nearly empty.  Entrees included salads, shrimp and grits (mine, yum), pot roast (also yum) and hamburgers with the most scrumptious garlic fries.  Nearly as intense as the popcorn.  And nearly as good.  It's safe to say that the quality of the food far exceeded everyone's expectations given the quirky, no-frills atmosphere and half broken tables.\\n\\nBottom line - I was really impressed with Porter.  I think if you read back through older reviews it seems like they've fixed a lot of the earlier shortcomings.  Anyway, everyone left still believing that I'm their go-to for unique dining experiences (as if this one was really that much of a secret), so i can't complain.

We waited for over fifteen minutes before we were approached by a waitress at our table. We had been told to sit anywhere by a man at the front. I expected to have fun, but it was not. Disappointing. The light up drink menu was nice to look at though.\\nThe teenager said his Daddy burger was really good. It looked great. His funky monkey milk shake tasted like bananas and chocolate, really good, and started to fill him up, an amazing accomplishment. \\nThe onion rings were really oily. The deep fried pickles were great but the sauce not so much, I have had better. The pickles even reheat nicely in a toaster oven. They were great. \\nThe wings were just awful! Do NOT order them. We had ordered a flavor that was like Thai curry. They did not present it well. The wings were dry and sitting on top of the sauce. I took a wing and tried to wipe it in the sauce so that they would have flavor. Problem was that the sauce was placed on top of waxed paper which tore into the sauce if touched. The wings ended up with waxed paper mixed into the sauce, it was either that, or eat them dry with no flavor. I picked off the paper pieces I saw on the wings and I explained to the waitress. I said that the wings had been dry but I could not scoop up the sauce because it caused the paper to break apart and mix into the sauce. She brought me more sauce that was COLD. I tried the new sauce but it was really COLD on my dry wings. It looked like pink mayonnaise. Sad because I had liked the flavor of the tiny bit of waxed paper sauce under my wings. \\nThe waitress said she hates how they put everything on waxed paper. \\nI ordered the chocolate tuxedo, a chocolate mousse dessert. I don't know, I never got to try it, she forgot all about it and never brought it to our table. I paid the high bill and took the left over pickles home which were great. The onion rings made us sick because they were so oily. The valet person was very nice.\\n NOTE: We did not enjoy eating paper, did not receive good service from the start, and were never given our dessert.

The soup had a good amount of chicken, shrimp, mushrooms, etc. in it, but the flavors I usually associate with this soup - lemongrass, kaffir, fish sauce... were barely present.\\n\\nNam Sod (ground pork, mixed with peanuts, chili, lime juice, ginger, etc., served with cabbage) - like the Tom Yum soup, I would give this a B-/C+ as well... and for the same reasons:  lack of adequate spices/intensity of flavors.\\n\\nSo, it seemed to me that a pattern was beginning to emerge... and then came the main course:\\n\\nRed Curry Chicken (chicken with various vegetables cooked in coconut milk/coconut cream infused with red curry paste/chili/fish sauce/et al spices) - And once again, just like the other dishes.... bland, lack of spices...  The Red Curry Chicken was the worst offender in the group, being the least flavorful curry I've tasted in quite some time. Grade:  C-\\n\\nSo what is the sum of all the parts food-wise?  Answer:  AMERICANIZED THAI (more below on this)\\n\\n\\nService:\\n\\nThe service staff was attentive and efficient.  No issues here....  One thing to note.... food comes out FAST and they like to keep things moving.  \\n\\n\\nAtmosphere:\\n\\nA small dining room, with many tables in VERY close proximity to other tables... Little Bangkok is trying to cram as many people in as possible.   \\n\\n\\nOverall:\\n\\nAs I was *not* enjoying my dinner at Little Bangkok, I began to look around the dining room.... And, as I soaked in the demographics, it all became clear to me.  The ENTIRE dining room, with the exception of one lady who looked to be of Asian-American descent, was filled with a white middle and upper middle class clientele (disclaimer:  I am a middle class WASP as well).  And age wise, it looked like a range of 35-65 was the norm....  Take that, combine it with a fast-paced meal in a crowded, cramped dining room and the complete picture comes into focus:  Little Bangkok has a white middle class ITP clientele base, and to cater to the 'taste' of that clientele, they are Americanizing the food.  Also, they want to turn tables and put as many butts in the seats as possible to maximize their profits (and nobody can blame them for that)... And, this may be a good business model for Little Bangkok - it looks like it's working for them.... But, at that same time, it sure doesn't work for me.  Take my advice: If you want real, authentic Thai, served in a less hurried, less formulaic setting, you are going to have to look elsewhere."},{"name":"Kiko Japanese Cuisine","address":"110 S Semoran Blvd","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4.5","text":"I am glad to see this place getting good reviews because I am pretty much in love with their sushi. \\n\\nWhen I tasted the sushi here I was pleasantly surprised that the fish tasted as fresh and good as the best sushi places I went to while living in San Francisco (and I just went to their website to look at the menu and lo and behold the chef is actually from San Francisco... small world). \\n\\nThe chef knows what he's doing and I love seeing what he includes in the \\"chef's choice\\".

I decided to have a birthday dinner here with some of my close friends and we were very disappointed. First off, we arrived at around 8:30pm for a party of six and were told that the wait would be ten minutes, which is fine, they didn't have a waiting area or really anywhere to stand, and we were told to stand against the wall in the walkway to the main dining area. and just to mention for those who have not been here, the walkway is about 2 1/2 ft of space right behind a bar with seating. The space that all of us were lined up against was so tight and cramp, we were all literally breathing over the necks of the people sitting at the bar. So after the uncomfortable wait for nearly thirty minutes,  a waiter came to seat us at a table for four ....there was another empty table right behind us and we asked could we put the two together, and we were told no because then we would have two separate waiters. They  did, however, let us have another table nearby. It's was a nice gesture but it made the birthday gathering completely uncomfortable and awkward. After getting settled, I headed to the ladies room, as I passed by, I saw a table large enough for six, possibly even eight. I asked to move there, and the waiter said no, again because we would have two seperate waiters......\\n\\nSo fast forward to the meal. We ordered two dish of Mac and cheese, cheese fritters, and Belgian fries. The fritters were good. They weren't \\"amazing\\" as some say. They taste like breaded and fried cream cheese sticks drizzled with honey. Nothing spectacular. The Belgian fries were tasty. Not sure if we had a bad batch, but the were soggy and not that different from the regular fries served with some of the meals. The Mac and cheese were decent, nothing to complain about but nothing to remember. Because of all the apps we got, I only ordered the crab ravioli. It had a vague description and I was not expecting the dish I received at all. To start off, they were not pasta raviolis, but were more like crab meat in between two slice of radishes. It also had this honey or simple syrup drizzled on top and candied higher slices everywhere. I could not finish my dish, and that says a lot seeing how there were only six \\"raviolis\\". Some of the other dishes we ordered were the fish n chips(nothing spectacular), the 48hr braised short ribs (inedible due tithe saltiness, when asked the waiter, he said \\"it's supposed to be salty\\"...really???? Is it supposed to be salty so that we could order more beer?  Shrimp po boy, verdict, extremely salty. Burger nothing unique. Overall, we were all very underwhelmed by the food and service.

Good for them!\\n\\nBUT (and it's a big one, if you can't tell by the capitalization), once you get past the nostalgia and support you may have for a store like this, you dig up a bunch of flaws that have left me with a sour taste in my mouth.\\n\\nMy friends and I went here last weekend for a nighttime snack looking for a place to sit, eat and chill. Sitting wasn't too much of a problem; considering it was a Saturday night during the holiday season, the place was busy and we were lucky to be seated right away.\\n\\nThe food on the other hand, gets, at best, a mixed review. The sweet potato fries were good, if expensive. The same goes for the good selection of tea. Maybe I should just get used to paying upwards of five dollars for a small pot of tea. I don't order tea that often, but this seemed expensive to me.\\n\\nThe worst was the order of hummus and pita we ordered as a table. When it first arrived, I could see the glisten of grease on each of the pita triangles. And besides the fact that they were sort of slippery, the pita was extremely stale. I wasn't sure whether they served us old pita, or tried to heat some up in a fryer and failed miserably. The hummus was the saving grace though. That was fresh and worth eating. I try to avoid sending food back as often as possible, and the fact that I was willing to finish the hummus prevented me from doing so.\\n\\nAnyway, maybe my review will change once I get a chance to check out the book and magazine selection.

Bottles of wine and conversation were flowing freely until we finally noticed that it was almost 9pm, had been seated for well over an hour and the food was not our yet. Our waitress informed us that  it was getting plated and so we waited....for another 25 minutes. At around 9:45pm, she was very sorry to inform us that the computer had screwed up our order and somehow lost it and it would take a bit longer to get the food out. Which begged the question...What the hell then had they been plating for the past 25 minutes??? Finally the food came at around 10:15pm...but it was two orders short. We had to share food with those missing theirs. We requested to see the manager/chef/owner who came out to address our grievances at around 10:45. I'll spare you the shouting match details.

Your choices of cannoli are with or without chocolate, and filled with either ricotta or custard. I'm so happy that the filling actually tastes like ricotta and not just cream. The shell is equally perfect - not too hard and not too soft.\\n\\nI also took home some of their homemade Marzipan and holy crap I was totally taken aback by how good it was. The consistency was fantastic, halfway between cake and paste. I'm also pretty sure they use amaretto in them given that they have a slight liquor aftertaste.

The tables are community style, and the place is very loud, but it's still a fun atmosphere. I admit that had we not gotten here early, I might have been frustrated by the seating (or lack thereof). Pizzas come out VERY quickly, so there's not much time to wait for a seat. If you're coming with friends, I'd suggest grabbing seats, then sending one person back to order. It's definitely not the sort of place where you can sit and hang out for ages, if not for the volume, then because you'd feel sort of crappy for holding on to the seats while people are waiting. One of my lost stars is for the seating.\\n\\nI knocked off the other star just for the staff.

The grilled brussels sprouts is one of my favorite appetizers there next to the burrata cheese.  It's topped with a soft boiled egg and grilled to perfection!  The sausage and peppers appetizer was quite tasty. The sausages were cooked well and it was the right about of spice.  I had to personally order the lasagna that night because I liked the idea of Chef Linda using two kinds of meat. Coincidentally, I haven't had lasagna in ages so really enjoyed my order. The lasagna was soft, creamy and the seasoning was just right.  Other fan favorites from the table were the lamp chops, shrimp risotto and the wild salmon dish. I definitely want to return and try the Cibo burger soon!  \\n\\nI'm looking forward to our \\"girl's night out\\" dinner later this month and can't wait to introduce new friends to this lovely restaurant.

Unfortunately, for me, it was a disappointment.  There were a few highlights, I liked the deserts and one of the salads and the juice they served with the main. The cocktails were good. The food though, I'd heard stories of amazing duck and steak and other meats. All we got was fish on fish on fish on fish that tasted like fish.  I know the menu changes monthly and I'm sure others loved it.  I'd love to go back and give it another shot since I've heard so many amazing reviews but the idea of dropping another $100 to do so will likely keep me away."},{"name":"Great Thai Chef","address":"255 Washington Street","city":"Somerville","stars":"3.5","text":"Walked by this weekend, there's a note on the window stating that they are relaunching the menu and renovating as part of their 10 year anniversary.

Rice is also the staple food of Filipinos. Which is why I found the rice to be the best part of our meal. Adobo rice was a full meal unto itself!

The ambience was very opposite of modern as described on their website. I requested a table that was romantic, as it was my wife's birthday, but we were seated next to the bar area  in which the noise level was very loud.  It was similar to a TGI Fridays. From the moment that we asked what kind of sparkling water they carry, the server had to ask another colleague of hers because she did not know. We were presented with two servers that would take care of us during our dining experience, and we asked one of them what a good recommendation for an appetizer would be. Hee had mentioned that everything was good and did not have an opinion. We ordered the corn bread to start off with and when we asked the server how large of a portion was she mentioned that it was very small. We asked if we should order two and she said yes, but when it came out, one was large enough for two people to share. As our appetizers came out, we noticed that  Chef Norman was there and was greeting every single table except for ours. The appetizers were bland and mediocre, and the Caesar salad was ok. We weren't even sure if we should order dinner with how the food was at this point. We ended up ordering the burger, but decided to take it to go as the the noise level was getting louder.

We ate at a place in Naples and the owner told us about a place his friend just opened in downtown Boston. We couldn't believe our good fortune that after dining on authentic Italian food for 2 weeks, we'd be able to return to Boston and continue our tour of Italy right out our front door. \\n\\nThe food:\\nPizza -- crust is crispy and filling without being too bready. I love seeing the masterpieces the chef creates for special occasions (if you friend them on Facebook, you'll be amazed). \\nArancini -- 5 stars. Just perfect. It's creamy, it's cheesy, it has a pinch of sauce, and it's a little ball of heaven. I once went on a trek through the North End trying to find a place with arancini and now I've found MAST'. \\nRagu -- homemade pappardelle pasta and boar ragu reminds us of one of our favorite meals while we were on our honeymoon in Chianti. Flavorful, hearty, and homemade. A true winner. \\nParmiggiana di melanzane -- I started my love affair with eggplant only a few years ago. Since then, I've come to appreciate a well-made eggplant parm. Not squishy, but soft; not crunchy or tough, but firm. After splitting the arancini and eating half my eggplant, I was full and never so excited about leftovers. \\n\\nThe Nutella Pizza -- That's right. Nutella. Pizza. Hang onto your hats. Every single time I think about this concoction, my mouth starts to water. And we had this for dinner about 4 months ago. Nutella spread over warm pizza dough so it's gooey and shiny, just daring you to attempt eating it without a napkin. Little dots of whipped cream are interspersed on the Nutella, making it beautiful as well as delicious. \\n\\nOur waiter the last time was Filippo and the man knows his stuff.

Personally I like tofu a lot and I wonder if next time I can swap cabbage for more tofu.... hmmm. Oh and yes, I am the queen of substitutions. The pork was really tender and quite flavorful.\\n\\nOh side note. They have sticky rice here which I prefer to the normal rice used at most korean restaurants so, props for delicious rice!

Very disappointing.\\n\\nGlazed:  Hard to mess up a glazed donut.  This was a perfectly fine donut, but it did have a greasy aftertaste.\\n\\nOld Fashioned Glazed:  A cake donut that's glazed.  This was the best of the bunch.  Very, very good, but again, a greasy aftertaste.\\n\\nChocolate Glazed:  A chocolate cake donut that's glazed.  Not nearly enough chocolate taste and it wasn't surprising, given the pale brown color of the donut.\\n\\nThe people who work there were VERY nice, but the donuts were truly disappointing.  My quest for a great donut continues."},{"name":"Trident Booksellers & Caf√©","address":"338 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I wanted to love brunch as much as I love the concept of a bookstore/food joint (see: Tres Gatos), however, anything above three stars would be incredibly generous.

I agreed after seeing the free offer for a tequila shot on yelp. \\nOnce we arrived to the restaurant it was apparent that this was much more of a bar atmosphere. We had to shout to each other to hear over the intense music. There were middle-aged couples making out against the bar and screeching women at the table next to us. The restaurant was packed. \\nWe asked the waitress what qualified as an entr√©e, as the yelp coupon stated that your tequila shot would be free with the purchase of an entr√©e. We ordered our entr√©e according to her specifications and presented her with the coupon. She stated that she would have to ask her manager if it were valid. Apparently during the month of October they require that you make a five dollar donation to breast cancer research in order to redeem your coupon. This is false advertising and it seemed that they were attempting to disguise their deceptive business practices behind it charitable organization. They were in competition with the other area Rocco's tacos to raise the most money and it just made the whole thing feel very sleazy. However, we are fairly non-confrontational, so we just said OK and ordered a pitcher of margaritas instead. The waitress was very apologetic, despite my boyfriend and I making very little fuss over it. \\nThis could have been a small hiccup during the evening, but then our food was served and it was nearly inedible. The shrimp taco tasted like food poisoning and the chicken taco was a soggy, watery slop. I left my tacos on the plate after my first bite of each. Our premium margaritas weren't even good. They tasted like straight tequila, but didn't didn't get me nearly drunk enough to forget how bad the food tasted. \\nLater in the meal, the waitress offered us a free desert to apologize for the fake coupon. It seemed that even the waitress thinks that the restaurant's antics are inappropriate.\\nThat poor server needs to find a new job. And as for anyone considering to eat at Rocco's tacos, I would suggest going elsewhere. If you are a middle aged man who wears his dress shirt buttoned only halfway or or a slightly past-her-prime woman looking to get shamelessly wasted, this might just be the place for you."},{"name":"Mozart's Coffee Roasters","address":"3825 Lake Austin Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"This is a pretty famous cafe.

I was working with some peeps in Dripping Springs (already a separate world from Austin) when they offered to treat me to the best BBQ there is. The place was still quite a ways away from the already removed Dripping Springs. When we got there it felt like we were pulling into a massive complex. It was a huge gravel parking lot with a monstrous outdoor seating area and the restaurant itself. \\n\\nWe were sat as soon as we entered. The guys I was with told me to just chill back, they would order everything we need. They ended up getting some sort of family feast deal. We got two huge plates that featured ribs, brisket, pork, and sausage. We also got a monster platter of all sorts of side dishes and pickled vegetables. Everything looked incredibly good and my hands were washed and I was ready to dig in. \\n\\nNow, usually I have no problem with family style dining. Still, I was dining with 7 other people that I didn't know, all of whom were in construction, and all of whom had the dirtiest most trifelling (sp?) hands that I've ever seen in my life. I made it a point to dig in first before those donkey's got their filthy hands on those succulent juicy saucy delicious ribs. Unfortunately, I was still hungry after my first round and had to indulge in the tainted meet. No joke, it was even better the second time around with all the dirty man hand germs. \\n\\nAfter eating for a while the 8 of us finally pummeled our entire side dish. So, when my boy asked for more the waiter simply walked over to a dirty table, took the platter off of it, and then served it to us! I've never, in my young life, seen anything like this.

The cabbage was very soggy; it must have been boiled for too long. I would not order this dish again.\\n- BURGER: This is what we came here for, the burger. The patty was very thick, and we got it cooked medium rare. However, the patty was definitely over seasoned and peppered, because the saltiness of the patty overpowered everything else in the burger, from the buns to the cheese and little greens in the burger. It was a great size, but the balance of flavors did not work well. Also, the potato wedges varied from under cooked, overcooked and burnt, to some well cooked pieces.

Unfortunately it was a MAJOR LET DOWN. \\nFood: was cold and mediocre...nothing mind blowing...My sister, friend and myself had to send back our COLD tacos\\nDrinks: are OKAY...\\nThe waitress offered water AFTER we got our food. My friend also found a piece of meat in her water...Nonetheless, there were a few tables surrounding ours whom received way more attention then our table did. To think I had this reservation since Mid-June. We spoke with the manager who seemed rather eager to help us and gave us a discount off the bill.

Unacceptable for an establishment that boasts and advertises craft beer and in the middle of Boston.

Now it's not named the Salty Pig for no reason, the meat is salty however it is good and the cheese was good as well. \\n\\nWe ordered another round of beers, the same ones since we didn't want to play the game of what beers they had, and enjoyed the delicious food.\\n\\nTook a half hour to find the server again who apparently disappeared and when we asked for the check, they didn't make eye contact, didn't even say thank you or good night, just passed off the check like it was a toxic football."},{"name":"The Salty Pig","address":"130 Dartmouth St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Have been excited to try Salty Pig since it's recent opening.

Split the clam pizza which was really good-- although my boyfriend felt the dough to topping ratio wasn't quite right (too much dough, not enough toppings), it was still tasty. \\n\\nOverall, we were happy, the location is convenient, vibe is great, food is excellent.

I appreciated the jalapenos.\\n\\nOne tip for eating at Giacomo's: you better come HUNGRY. This is not a little pretentious tapas bar; here, you get exactly what you pay for. Quality. Portions made to feed two. And why must you be super hungry? Because you will have a days' worth of pasta to eat in 20 minutes before the impatient line outside starts staring at you to make you uncomfortable. \\n\\nYour meal will be quick, maybe rushed, so remember to plan for post-dinner festivities.

Last night, I had the slow-roasted chicken and I can almost still taste it.  The chicken was so tender, I didn't need a knife, and with every forkful I picked up the beans, spinach, and puree served with it.  All of the flavors worked so well together (the sauce was rich but very light), and the textures complimented each other perfectly.  This entree is a hefty portion, so about halfway through I forced myself to slow down to ensure a leftover lunch large enough for today.  Of course it helped that we had started with the grilled octopus, ended with the gingerbread pain perdu, and padded the middle with bread and a bottle of wine.  We spent way too much money, but were too happy and full afterwards to care.  \\n\\nThings we commented on throughout the meal: the attentiveness of the staff, their knowledge of the menu, and their passion for the food and wine; how we saw a different server for each course of the meal; how the exposed kitchen was surprisingly calm, cool, and collected which made us feel comforted and well taken care of; and how most of the customers were twice our age and we should have had our parents take us there so they could treat.

We got the mussels appetizer $11, pie of the day (chicken) $19, and the bangers and booz $17 over lunch. Yeah that's no penny farthing there, but at least the food was pretty decent and they were pretty fast with the service. The lady who helped us out was very friendly, and we were in a little bit of a rush and she accommodated us perfectly.\\n\\nThe food itself wasn't bad. The mussels were probably my favorite, followed by the pie of the day and then the bangers and booz. Interesting twist to things with a little Guinness tossed into the dishes: the traditional olive oil and bread was instead olive oil with honey and a Guinness reduction and Irish soda bread (bread a little too crumbly for me, but interesting sweet taste), and the bangers and booz has a hint of Guinness added to its creation as well.\\n\\nThe MUSSELS have a nice coconut curry taste to it, that is complemented really well with this slight sourness to it that was perfect for dipping bread into. The actual mussels themselves were also rather large, although perhaps not great in number. Still, rather tasty.\\n\\nThe CHICKEN PIE was pretty well done: chicken was not dry at all, great flavor, nice crisp to the crust and yet still soft and flaky. Comes with a side of salad with vinagrette as well, which was refreshing.\\n\\nThe BANGERS AND BOOZ, while in third place, was still not bad. The mashed potatoes and the beef stew were done really well. Meat fell apart and the marinade/stew worked really well with it and the mashed potatoes. The banger (sausage) was so-so, lacked flavor and the texture was different from usual so maybe that threw me off, but that said, over all a decent dish.\\n\\nWould I come back? Most probably if I was in the area. In general the service and decor is great, the drinks are pretty solid and well-priced there as well, not to mention that I'd like to try the fish and chips there someday, but it's probably best not to make too many trips to Downtown Disney for the sake of your bank account."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"I have been here many times.

The midtown location is kind of small and the seating is first come first serve, at family style tables.

The dressing was bla, although they did have fresh shaved parmesan cheese, the croutons were from a bag, small and tasteless.  Hey, if I'm going to have that many calories it better be good.  The appetizer of fried lobster was saturated in Asian dressing.  Although it was good you couldn't taste the lobster.  Finally the steaks were lathered in butter.

With 3-4 different Italian meats and topped with arugula. SO good... Thin and chewy/crispy crust... Yum!"},{"name":"Antico Pizza","address":"1093 Hemphill Ave NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I had only previously eaten at Antico once before and it did leave me wanting to eat there again.  To be fair the first visit was a to go order that was eventually reheated prior to eating an hour later so it wouldn't be correct to review in that scenario.  I do love the authenticity of pizza as it does feel a bit closer to the real deal.  My first \\"real\\" pizza was the traditional Margherita on a trip to Italy a decade ago.  The American version is of course sauce heavy and has more cheese than a Justin Beiber / Brittany Spears concert tour could offer.  I'm certainly a fan of the American version but I do like something a little more \\"legit\\" from time to time.  \\n\\nThe one thing that didn't quite hit the mark for me was the dough.  The imported ovens do a fantastic job getting that char that just smacks of \\"real\\" pizza but I did find that the dough although charred in spots the way it should be was left a bit doughy and soft.  Perhaps it was just a busier than expected random Tuesday night and the dough hadn't properly been set.  The taste of the dough was excellent as I had remembered it but still missing that little bit of crisp - even to the point of soggy which was disappointing.\\n\\nThe sauce is fantastic however.  I had read at one point that the tomatoes were imported from Italy weekly and perhaps this is a factor.  It could very well be just leverage for the steep pricing as well but wherever they are sourced the sauce is quite good.  We had a Margheria and the San Gennaro which was a great sweet and spicy balance.  \\n\\nI do somewhat enjoy the \\"in kitchen\\" atmosphere (though we sat in the front room) though I do think the constant eyes on your progress from both the staff and those waiting for seats do make me feel a bit rushed.  Still it is very lively and a bit of a lark to break the \\"table for 4\\" status quo.\\n\\nMy primary complaint is not one that most will agree with but I do find it a bit annoying that any requested deviation from the menu will be met with dagger eyes from the counter when placing an order.  I spend a good deal of time in a kitchen myself and do give my guests a bit of grief when they request any sauce for a burger coming off of my grill but this is only in jest.  \\n\\nA simple request such as no basil (for my kids pizza for example) should not be met with such disdain.  I realize that there is a model and a recipe standard but to have my request to keep the (rather skimpy portion) of 5 basil leaves off of the pizza should not result in the staff staring me down like I just ordered a stuffed crust Meat Lovers.  These are the kinds of things that make educated diners in particular cringe.  These kinds of responses are the things that can eventually wear down a base and cause some pretty negative word of mouth (which is one of the driving forces behind Antico's current success).  This is a top down attitude so I can't fault the staff.  Behind every employee who refuses to honor a simple request is an chef/owner who falsely believes the \\"Soup Nazi\\" routine will always be acceptable.\\n\\nOverall Antico offers great taste, good atmosphere and is worth a splurge every now and then.  The bloated pricing and unwillingness to make any modifications to the menu make it difficult to consider Antico for a regular spot but a good place to satisfy an occasional craving."},{"name":"Barcelona Inman Park","address":"240 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Tapas tapas, taste a little order a lata!

If you want large portions of pretty good food for $14 to $20 per dish, with a 45 minute to hour wait for a table, then this is the place for you.\\n\\nI'll start by saying it isn't a bad restaurant, but why it is so popular is a bit of a mystery.\\n\\nThe restaurant basically specializes in large portions of food that tastes fine but are really not true Italian dishes.\\n\\nI, however, prefer to taste the components of a dish, have my pasta al dente, and for the chef to compose the dish rather than allowing me to pair the pasta, protein, and sauce.  Seriously, I thought about walking out when the waitress asked what kind of sauce I wanted and gave me a card with an option of six, one of which was called \\"giacomo sauce.\\"  I knew at that point that I was not about to have a fine dining experience.  The giacomo sauce was basically alfredo sauce and marinara mixed together.  The alfredo sauce was poured out of a pitcher.\\n\\nThe majority of the menu is seafood based, so my girlfriend and I tried the \\"house specialty\\" zuppa di mare.  NOTE: this is the \\"house specialty\\" not the house \\"special\\" and I double checked with the waitress that it was something that the kitchen was proud to present.  It was huge, with a ton of poorly cooked shellfish (lobster, overdone; muscles, overdone; clams, overdone; scallops, waaay overdone; calamari pretty well cooked).  It was advertised as dinner for two, but easily could have fed six. Again, not my thing, but if you like large portions you may enjoy it.  Overall, the taste was decent, it just wasn't anything special, and I find it offensive that sooo many people told me how great this place was after I expressed that I had been disappointed by many North End Italian places in Boston that I considered to be faux Italian.\\n\\nThe wine list is small and consists mainly of mediocre California wines, none of which are truly appealing. Also, the restaurant itself is just hot.  It was 15 to 20 degrees warmer inside than outside, which made it about 102 degrees while we were there.  It probably lends some authenticity, but seems more like a ploy to keep turning the tables over and get people in and out of the door.  Additionally, the table behind me was a four top, and none of their food came out together.  The first pasta dish was delivered to one of the diners at the table at least 10 minutes before the last entree was brought out.\\n\\nMost of the diners were eating pasta, which was cooked roughshod on a flat top boiling pot, and often left on counters for far too long to maintain the integrity of the pasta or the texture.  Basically, al dente is not going to be an option.  None of the pasta is handmade, which I understand, but they should at least try to cook it properly.\\n\\nThe staff is very friendly, but after quietly inviting each table to join in, they did sing happy birthday to a customer. Had a bit of a Joe's Crab Shack feel about it. \\n\\nBasically, if you want a lot of food go there.  If you want truly good, authentic Italian food, go someplace else."},{"name":"Liquid Art House","address":"100 Arlington St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"This place is my new go-to for entertaining out-of-town visitors with discerning tastes. I met a friend here for dinner, made a reservation, and arrived really early expecting a crowd. LAH just opened for the night and was pretty empty, so I took advantage of the beautiful front-and-center bar and ordered a cocktail while I waited for my friend. The bar - and cocktails - were so great that my friend and I abandoned our table and stayed in the lounge. We ordered the raspberry rhubarb dessert to share and it was like eating summer. Utter bright, airy perfection.\\n\\nTips for future visitors: LAH seems to get busy around 8 pm, so arriving earlier is ideal for a more quiet experience. It's also definitely ok to arrive snazzily dressed, but you certainly won't get booted out the door if you're not. Finally, this place is beautifully wheelchair accessible, unlike a lot of other trendy, up-and-coming restaurants in Boston.\\n\\nMy verdict: Go, enjoy, and be immersed in art of the visual and culinary kind."},{"name":"Craigie On Main","address":"853 Main St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"My labmate James and I went on a whim on the snow day here in Boston.  The scene was busy, but still very intimate.  We arrived around 6 and were the first table seated, and didn't feel rushed at all even though we enjoyed our meal over 3 hours.\\n\\nWe decided to have a pig fiesta.  Appetizers: pig's tail and rye fusilli with pig confit ragout, entree: the pig's head for two and desserts: valrhona chocolate cremaux and the creme caramel.  Drinks: Northern Lights, Orchard Mule, Plainfield Swing and the Martinez.  The pig's tail and the pig's head were amazing:  confit done perfectly, crispy skin, succulent flesh, and yes, fatty, but overall very enjoyable.  I agree with the other reviews that an acid would have helped cut the richness of the pig's head, but  even without it was a great dish.  In our ignorance, we expected the pig's tails to be the cartoon-style curlicues but instead it was more like oxtail - fatty tender meat on the bone.  The drinks were also fantastic, intriguing flavor combinations that didn't overwhelm any of the food.\\n\\nThe desserts left a bit to be desired - great textures, but the anise of the Chartreuse in the chocolate was a bit overwhelming and the creme caramel was tasty but not something to write home about.\\n\\nThe service was a definite highlight:  our server was very charming and knowledgeable, and steered me away from drink selections that wouldn't pair well with the food being served."},{"name":"The Proper Pie Company","address":"145 Ridge Center Dr","city":"Davenport","stars":"4.5","text":"After reading prior reviews, I knew I had to get here asap and very happy I could carve some time out to get here.

The food was delicious -- very comfort food-esque. Flavorful, hearty, and down-right great! I recommend the Mafe (traditional Senegalese dish) --- if you enjoy lamb you should definitely try this. The only reason I didn't give Teranga a 5-star rating is because the service was so-so (took them quite a long time to take our drink orders or to even come over and greet us at our table), and the front door kept being left open and the place was pretty drafty -- they need to get one of these entrance-protector things for cold weather. \\nOveral, I highly recommend Teranga."},{"name":"Upper Deck Kitchen and Taphouse","address":"1239 Davie Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"Wow, what an adventure.\\nWe went in for brunch and I was blown away by the service - or lack thereof.

I've just downgraded my review from five to three stars because of the noise level at peak hour and the unwillingness of our waitress to pass on objective feedback. When I tried to show the decibels on my phone, she got obviously irritated and said she had many tables to wait on. 94.5 decibels at peak is an objective measure you can remedy, and more useful than a subjective complaint. A fine dining experience is incomplete without conversation, and when you can't hear each other, that's a problem. If the owners don't respond to feedback that's worse. Luce is a small, boxy room with all hard surfaces. The sound system was playing \\"atmospheric\\" music with trumpets that forced everyone to speak louder to be heard. Too bad.

They were sitting so close, we might as well have been sharing a bread basket.   \\n\\nAs it turns out, Condescending-Braided-Hair Woman was our server. She pointed to the chalkboard instead of briefly going over the specials and rushed through everything. I understand that there is a long line outside, but it would have been nice to not feel like her goal was to turn as many tables as she could. Her braid kept swinging around and brushing up on my arm. I wouldn't be surprised it it's been brushed up against, or in, someone's meal.\\n\\nThe menu is a decent size. For some meals you can pick and choose which sauces, pasta, and/or protein you'd like. I chose the lobster ravioli. It was cooked just right and was overall really enjoyable. \\n\\nWhen the waitress came to check on us my friend asked if they make their own pasta. Turns out they don't. It's purchased from a distributor. \\n   \\nI'm glad we finally tried it out, but I can't say that I'll be back. I could have went to my local grocery store and picked up some Buittoni pasta.

We were a little late and I called to let them know, and they were very nice over the phone and thanked us for calling.  We were seated promptly and politely, and a very nice and spacious table at the back of the bar area.\\n\\nOur server was very polite and generally attentive, though my main issue was the timing of the service.  The bread came promptly but it took quite a while for the appetizer to come after that.  The main course came promptly after the appetizer, but the waitress came to ask us how the meal was before we even had one bite (too soon).  The main course was cleared at an appropriate time, but after we paid it took overly long for them to come take the check, and we ended up leaving the money on the table (thank goodness we paid cash not with a card, because that could have taken forever).  In general the service was polite and the servers were knowledgeable, but the timing needs a bit of work.\\n\\nMy boyfriend had the octopus appetizer, and they switched from chorizo sauce to carrot jus when he asked for this.  He enjoyed the dish very much.  I had the burger for dinner, and it was juicy though I asked for it very well done and there were areas that were quite pink so I would have called it \\"medium well\\" rather than well, and it was certainly NOT very well done as I would have liked.  Other than this, the salad was good and the fries were very tasty.  My boyfriend had the chicken, which was moist and very tasty as well.  \\n\\nOverall this experience was much better than the previous one, but I think the restaurant still has some kinks to work out in terms of the service timing.  Also, the prices are quite high for the overall experience.  It is a very nice restaurant but I would not call it one of the BEST restaurants in Boston, so I don't think that the prices should be as high as they are.

Other than fancy restaurants, I wish ALL places were like this and House Pizza, etc.\\n \\nI have had about 5 or 6 dishes and all were very good.  Their specialty is coastal Indian food, which is hard to find in Austin, since most places serve the creamier and heavier north Indian food. I like that food also, but it gets a bit boring time after time.\\n\\nI haven't tried the lunch specials yet, but they seem a great deal.\\n\\nMy only recommendation for them would be to somehow re-steam the rice a bit better before serving, so it would be a bit more fresh and fluffier.\\n\\nOther than that, I think it's a very nice place with lots of options for meat and fish eaters, vegetarians, and even vegans. If you like eggs, try the Konkani egg curry. \\n\\nAs with places like Simplicity Wine and Eats, I hope they start serving food on \\"green\\" biodegradable plates and forks.  Naturally, that would add to their and our cost, but I think since eating out in Texas is so cheap, it is worth it.\\n\\nAlso, they nicely accept the Go Local card for 10% off, so remember to get/take yours.

Then I challenge you to go try this pizza and try NOT making the trek the next time you want a kick-ass pizza. All those \\"build your own pizza\\" places popping up everywhere are great ... if you only demand a pizza a step up from Round Table. But, this dude's pizza is RIDICULOUS!

So although I would love to be able to travel over there every week and grab a pizza, obviously that's not possible. Finding La Sorrentina has me questioning my devotion to my little pizzeria treasure in NJ. La Sorrentina's pizza is thin, HOT, melty, drippy, perfectly saucy, foldable, and INFUSED with flavor. I asked about the mushrooms, as their flavor was SO DELICIOUS and deep, and I was told it's the pizzaiolo's secret (I'd keep that secret to the grave!!) The first time I ordered one of these pizzas, I couldn't eat it fast enough. Instead of taking it home, I sat in the parking lot, hovering over it like Gollum, (My Precious ...), and just devoured it! I wanted to consume it so fast, the thought of blending it up and drinking it crossed my mind! Ha ha ha ha I know, I'm truly sick.

Sometimes there is a small mob outside waiting for the doors to open at lunchtime. \\n\\nOnce inside, there's only 2 registers, so there's usually a bottleneck getting your order placed, though the pizza comes out quickly, as that is the nature of tasty dough with toppings thrown in a wood fired oven. \\n\\nBYOB, or order a Peroni, munch on your pizza sitting at your communal picnic tables.

I don't even care that you make me wait hours outside in the open air, just as long as I can have you. Does this sound a little like a love story? Well, it should, because I love food.\\nEven if you live in the Austin area, driving out to Driftwood for BBQ seems a bit insane, unless you've ever eaten at Salt Lick BBQ and then you will understand and never question the out-of-the-way drive again. Why else would people drive so far, wait hours on end out in the elements, all to be seated with an entire table of complete strangers? Because the BBQ is that good. I find with food, as in life, if it's worth having, it's worth the effort. \\nBy the way, don't wear you're pretty new shoes or any type of clothing that might possibly get stained. This isn't fine dining, it's BBQ, which means a sandy dirt lot for parking, old dirty picnic tables to sit on outside (if you can get a seat), and messy finger lickin' food inside. Save the pretty new cowboy boots for a city night out. Don't worry about the parking because there's plenty to go around...just like their BBQ. Some BBQ places close early or don't have enough BBQ to go around, but at Salt Lick, you will never experience such a thing.\\nThey do not take reservations, so when you show up, put your name on the waiting list and like all of the others waiting to eat, you go graze out in the pasture with the rest of the herd until your name is called. If by chance you forgot to BYOB, next door to the big food shack is their little matching shack that sells their own vineyard wine...because wine goes so well with BBQ. Personally, I think they would be better off creating their own distillery or brewery to complement their food.\\nOnce you've finally made it inside, they do a small quick walk tour of the place before whisking you right to your \\"reserved\\" spot along the many rows of family sized picnic tables. I would highly recommend to not get up and \\"sight see\\" the BBQ pit area or any of their memorabilia until after you've eaten just to be courteous to diners waiting, because you just waited hours to eat too. \\nThe difference here that most BBQ places around Texas don't do is that they send a server to your spot and they bring you everything from drinks to dessert and everything in between. The service is fast since they're goal is to turn over tables as quickly as possible, but they are still courteous while they do it. Menus are provided to you as soon as you sit down, but you can always ask to look over a menu while you wait, which makes the process so much faster and you get your food quicker if you already know what you want to eat.\\nI ordered up the brisket, sausage, turkey, sweet tea, potato salad, cole slaw, and blackberry cobbler. No, I didn't eat it all by myself; I actually split it all with a friend, except for the drink and dessert. The obvious loves are the meat, of course, but that's because Salt Lick has been slow smoking their meats for decades...they know what they're doing. The bark on the brisket is really good, flavorful, with good smoke and charring, but the meat is a bit drier than I would prefer to have. The sausage and turkey were both perfectly smoked with lots of flavor and still tender on both.\\nThe potato salad was tangy and the traditional Southern mustard variety. The cole slaw was just meh, but I'm not really a fan of cole slaw anyways. The cobbler was out of this world good; we're talking little Southern church lady good, and I would go so far as saying better than my grandmother's cobbler. I was sad that I didn't order more of the cobbler because it really was a beautiful finish to a great BBQ dinner.\\nIt's a bit of a drive for anyone to get out to Salt Lick, but you absolutely MUST eat at the original location simply to feel like you're dining with the legacy of so many great BBQ smokers and experts. Half of the experience here is the drive and the tourist-like surroundings inside and outside of Salt Lick. If you miss this part of the experience, then you've missed the adventure altogether. If you're looking for good Texas style BBQ, then Salt Lick is a must-try on your list."},{"name":"Harvard Gardens","address":"316 Cambridge St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"A relatively mellow bar/restaurant combo, HG apparently gets really busy during weekends.

I was wrong. An hour after I ordered the medium rare burger, it finally came out. It was room temperature after blatantly sitting under a heat lamp for the majority of my wait time. The cheese was transparent and sweaty. The burger was cold and cooked to medium well. Gross. I never send food back, but I wasn't about to eat it and I decided to wait even longer for them to make a new one. The same exact burger came back 5 minutes later, cooked beyond well done. I won't even comment on what the cheese looked like. \\n\\nI know this is not the server's fault and I should mention she was friendly and apologetic. I attribute the one star rating to the way she handled the situation, otherwise I would say this place deserves zero stars.

Very fresh and a wide variety if you are picky, like me!  Overpriced, but hey, that's Disney for ya!\\n\\nIf you are not a fan of Irish food, I will say this is not the place for you!  I went in there (pleasing the hubs, of course) on the notion that surely I'd be able to find something that was more American-style and I was sadly surprised.  Their menu is big, but there are very few things that are non-traditional Irish.\\n\\nI ended up with the Kiss Before Shrimp.  I do have to say that it was excellent.  I wondered why they delivered (what felt like) 2 loaves of bread with the dish.  You have to be ready for some real spice!  Mouth was on FIRE!  The shrimp were rather small, but they were tasty.  Can't say that I'd be ordering it again, but I wasn't totally disappointed with my menu choice.\\n\\nOf course besides the beer, the entertainment is great.  We were there for probably an hour and the entertainers performed for a good portion of the time that we were there.  The dancers were great.  They are so talented.

Two dancers came to our dining room but we couldn't even see their dancing feet. Complimentary bread service was a tasty Irish soda bread. For entrees, we had the Irish stew and the butternut squash risotto. The food was lackluster - which was even more disappointing given the price tag. The risotto needed some salt, and was a smaller portion than I expected; the dish it was served in, while wide, was shallow so it was a like a illusion. Sadly, the beef in the stew was not so tender. However, the vegetables were nicely done. I resorted to eating more bread. I would not come here for lunch or dinner again.

We thoroughly enjoyed this privacy in a hibachi setting.  \\n\\nI ordered the calamari steak hibachi dinner with fried rice and a side of shrimp and he ordered the chicken, steak and shrimp hibachi dinner with fried rice.  The food was very good!! The starter miso soup was a bit on the peppery side, but still really good. The salad contained a very good thick ginger dressing. Probably the best ginger dressing I've had at a hibachi spot in a long time.  \\n\\nOur chef was really nice. He didn't do all of the tricks and talk to us the whole time, which was great! There weren't any kids at our table so there wasn't a need for the extra stuff.  The fried rice was really good! They use the larger rice grains and chop the egg in slices so that you can taste it in the rice. No soy sauce was needed for extra flavor so that's a plus.  The calamari was awesome! The calamari is thicker than the cut of calamari at Benihana! Absolutely delicious. The yummy yummy sauce that goes with it was really good as well. And the shrimp were jumbo and pretty tasty. They give you a large serving for a side of shrimp.  \\n\\nI forgot to mention that along with the grilled vegetables you also get a serving of noodles cooked on the grill. Those were pretty good as well!! \\n\\nThe boyfriend thoroughly enjoyed his meal as well. His steak was cooked really well along with his chicken! We had a lot of leftovers, which were just as good the second day!!\\n\\nI would highly recommend this place for date night and birthdays.  They do a really nice song with drums for birthdays.

While the Congolaise style is their most popular, I prefer my mussels in the simplest sauce -- that way you absolutely know the mussels are fresh.  Absolutely delicious, plump, perfectly cooked, lots of broth to enjoy, and served with crispy fries and mayonnaise.  I order the duo of sablefish and pork belly as my main ($30).  This almost could have been two entrees -- generous portion of both the fish and pork.  The meal was quite rich, but I suppose that is the nature of both sablefish and pork belly.  Beautifully plated.  For dessert, I had Le Nico Fume, which sounded fascinating (Chocolate scotch cake, bacon caramel, burnt milk ice cream, milk crumbs), but was disappointing for $12.  It arrived in a cup and was served in parfait format.  Interesting, but I was expecting a slice of dense cake.  \\n\\nService 5/5: Excellent.  Our server was attentive, friendly, knowledgeable, gave us plenty of time to peruse the menus, didn't rush us.
