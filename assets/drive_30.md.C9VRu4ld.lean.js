It's not Aquitaine, you yuppie.  They don't care to figure out your wait time, and there is no goddamn list.  If it's too cold, go home and make yourself a Boboli pizza.\\n\\n2) Once you get inside, don't stare at the locals as you walk to your table.  They don't like you.  They never have.  They never will.\\n\\n3) The waiter will give you a menu.  Please, for the love god, don't open it.  It's a trick to spot amateurs.  Just order a lamb appetizer, a sausage appetizer, a garlic and sausage pizza, and a garlic and cheese pizza, and a round of Labatts or Molsens.\\n\\n4) Don't ask for anything dainty.  My friend brought his prissy girlfriend here once, and she asked for coffee, and the waiter said, \\"honey, we don't got coffee.\\"  And then she said, \\"what about tea?\\"  And he said \\"no tea either.\\"  And then she asked, \\"do you have anything hot?\\"  And he pointed to himself and said \\"you're looking at it\\" and walked away.\\n\\n5) Finish everything.  Leftovers are for wimps.\\n\\n6) Bring cash.  No credit cards accepted.\\n\\n7) If you come here with me, and you don't rave about the pizza in between every bite, then you suck, and you can consider it the end of our friendship.  Delete my number from your phone and my e-mail address from your blackberry. \\n\\nGood luck!"},{"name":"Bertucci's","address":"533 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Now, I'm one of those people that truly believes there's only pretty good pizza and great pizza, but Bertucci's was able to change my mind in one night.

Yes, it is small so you will have a long a** wait. Yes, the tables are communal style bench tables so privacy is not an option. Yes, the food portions are small so you better not be hungry. And, yes it is pricey so you better plan to drop a couple Bens for two. But, who cares about all that when your taste buds are going to be given an experience that rarely happens.\\n\\nI don't even know where to start reviewing the food because it is all so damned good and so damned inventive. But I will start with some advice. Get there early and put your name on the list, or get there after 9. Both seem to reduce the wait time. I will say that the times that we have tried to eat there around 7 or 8, the wait was 2 plus hours. Even for a small party of 2 or 3, so follow the above advice to reduce your wait time. Also, you can call them and ask what the current wait time is before you go to help you plan. I did this once and it worked well. \\n\\nSecond piece of advice...if you do have to wait, a new cheese bar opened next door. Get out of the heat and have some wine and cheese. But if you do have to wait outside the door, ask the host/hostess for the drink menu and order a nice cold beer to beat back the heat. Try not to do this for more than 1/2 hour if the Sun is still out because it will heat you up fast!\\n\\nNow, as for the food, keep in mind that the food is served communal style in small plates (very small portions), so if you find something you absolutely do not want to share, just remind your table mates that you will stab a b***h if they touch your scallops. It seems to work pretty well.\\n\\nWhen it comes to ordering, nothing there is bad, but I love what they do with seafood. The shrimp is awesome, but the scallops will leave you absolutely orgasmic. The quail is awesome. And, remember to order both appetizers and desserts. Trust me, you will have room.\\n\\nI'm going to be honest and tell you that Hubby and his buddies do not love this place. Their wives do, but they don't. It seems that while Barley Swine food is great for the Austin hipster, it just isn't enough food for the big, 'ol Texas Marlborough Man. He'd rather have a great big beautiful steak somewhere. So if your hubby is the Texas Land and Cattle type, my last piece of advice is to hit up with your girlfriends.

Blueberry Muffins - nothing special, just a regular muffin that I found a bit too 'hard' on the outside. I don't know how to explain but it wasn't a moist muffin. Just, more on the dry side.\\n\\n4. Ham and Cheese Quiche - my friend ordered this and she loves it, she says that it is one of the best quiche's she's ever tried so far. They are pretty generous with the amount of ham that they gave.

Though I arrived at noon, I was able to get seated immediately.  Service was prompt and efficient.

Lunch items are available too.  \\n\\nI asked for sides of bacon and biscuits and gravy.  I'm leery of gravy having overwhelming spices, so I asked my server what spices the gravy contained.  She checked with the kitchen and reported back that the seasonings were straightforward:  salt, pepper and rubbed sage.  Rubbed sage is a fancy way of saying finely ground dried sage.  Presentation of my brekkie was excellent.  I liked that they went ahead and put the bacon and biscuits and gravy on the plate with everything else.\\n\\nFood quality was adequate.  But you gotta be careful what you wish for.  I didn't want rosemary-riddled biscuits and gravy, and I didn't get that.  Fortunately.  But besides being cold, the gravy had no flavor.  I was happy to see that they had a blackberry (or at least some kind of dark berry) jelly to go with the toast.  However, I was disappointed that this jelly had no flavor and was totally lacking any sweetness.  Yet, the thick (but light) poppy seed-topped whole wheat toast was outstanding.  It deserved better than the jelly on hand.  The orange juice was just fair.\\n\\nHowever, I did like the grits.  Garnished with a light sprinkle of paprika, the grits were great, possessing a nice level of spicy heat.\\n\\nMusic (a selection of 60s/70s top 40 hits) was played at a good level that allowed conversation.

I didn't even get to finish it all because it was just too much. But damn was it nice. I think it could've been a bit more tender and juicy, but for the portion size it was still damn good, especially with their sauces on the table which I thought were fantastic. The sausage was good but nothing too special about it. The Mac and cheese was super cheesy and creamy which I like, and being from Georgia, im a sucker for a good peach cobbler and theirs didn't disappoint!\\n\\nDrinks: I should title this beer, because it's beer galore!

Punjab Palace displays a wide variety of flavorful sauces, including the traditional masala, korma, and curry. Recommend trying a few dishes medium and at least one dish hot. \\n\\nUsually this reviewer prefers a protein other than chicken, but Punjab Palace cooks it very tender, including of course, in the tandoori style without drying out. The chicken curry (with onions and tomatoes in a thinner sauce) and the chicken kadhai (with onions, peppers, and mushrooms in a creamier sauce) are stand-outs. The saag is heavier on the spinach and less creamy than elsewhere, while the dal (lentil) provides an even blend of vegetable and sauce. The chicken channa masala, although on the less adventurous side, is delicious in a creamy tomato sauce with tandoori chicken and chickpeas. Prefer this dish hot. The lamb bhuna, a similar style to the curry, provides generous hearty chunks of lamb.\\n\\nTried many dishes at Punjab Palace, you can't go wrong with any of them.

I ordered THE COOP scramble, which was scrambled eggs with diced chicken tenders mixed in and while that might strike you as kind of gross, I maintain that there's not much on the savory side you could mix with scrambled eggs that would ruin them.  And these delicious bites of flavorful chicken studded throughout the eggs far from ruined them.  The grits were nicely flavored and the biscuit was too enormous to finish. \\n\\nMy brother in law ordered the Winter Park Classic (eggs however you like, potatoes or grits, and a biscuit or some other choice) with a side of bacon.

Next time I dine there my sole request may be for a plate of bacon. With a side of bacon.\\n\\nMy beau ordered a simple plate of biscuits and gravy and though the gravy was on the skimpy side (also, as I mentioned, the biscuits are huge.  Maybe the size of a very big man's closed fist) it was the best sausage gravy I have ever tasted.  When I go back and order my lone plate of bacon, I will have to order a dish of gravy to dip it in.\\n\\nWe also ordered a side of sliced tomatoes and pimento cheese, which in retrospect might have been just over the top.  By the end of that meal I was starting to feel like the gentleman in the Monty Python movie who exploded when he was offered the wafer thin mint. And honestly...though there was nothing wrong with this pimento cheese, I have had better elsewhere. We could have skipped it and still had a wonderful meal.\\n\\nI loved the mismatched wooden dining tables and chairs, and the whole atmosphere was one of casual comfort.

The vegan dishes were clearly well thought out and were delicious. Most restaurants claiming to be vegan friendly will have maybe 1 item on the menu, but Kyma's vegan menu actually has a number of dishes (starters, entrees, and sides). It was nice to actually have some options for once! Our waiter was extremely attentive and had a great personality.

I had to pay an extra ($1?) to add avocado, which isn't unusual. Unfortunately, when it came out, I had to laugh at the pathetic amount of avocado that $1 gets you. I'm talking about a quarter-sized little sliver of avocado on each side of the sandwich, beneath a sliver of cheese the same size. They covered, at best, 1/8th of the sandwich. To their credit, when I brought it to the counter they generously scooped more on. I didn't bother mentioning the cheese (which isn't something that comes on a Torta, usually, anyway). The meat was seasoned very well, though there was too much fatty gristle chunks than I'd have liked.  The cook should spend an extra 5 seconds separating the inedible parts of the meat. While not as bad as the avocado and cheese, for the size of the sandwich it was lacking in quantity for every ingredient -- not enough meat, not enough lettuce, not enough tomato, not enough beans. It was a bread sandwich with some delicious hints of torta. For the record, I'm not the kind of person who usually complains about the quantity of food. But the proportions for this sandwich were just all wrong.\\n\\nMy wife ordered the Chicken Carnitas, which was fantastic, authentic, and well portioned (though suffered from the same issue of too much fat gristle). I regret ordering the torta, which is unfortunate given that I expected it to be their best item.\\n\\nFor those two entrees, chips, and a soda, we paid $18. Truthfully, that seems pretty over-priced for what is essentially a take-out joint. The food was served on red plastic trays (for $18, I'd like a plate, thanks). The salsa is freely available at the condiments counter, but the only containers for it are thimble-sized. So you'll need to fill about 30 of those, which is a joke. They don't have a fountain, so my soda came in a 20oz bottle, and I had to ask for a cup of ice -- which was also ridiculously small.\\n\\nI feel like they need to figure out who they're trying to be. This place has the food quality (if they weren't so skimpy with things like meat, cheese, lettuce, tomato..) and the price of a higher-class place than a take-out joint, but they need to at least give you plates, cups, and a salsa dish."},{"name":"Desta Ethiopian Kitchen","address":"3086 Briarcliff Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"This is one of the best Ethiopian restaurants I've ever eaten at.

So why a four-star? Because, honestly, I think that's what it's worth for what it is, and I know many, many people enjoy it (and my reasons for not are more about me than about the restaurant). AND SO, this review's content is primarily meant as a warning for others like me, and yet, the stars are reflective of the fact that I don't think the restaurant deserves to lessen their average just because they don't suit my personal tastes. Make sense? Cool. \\nLass uns anfangen, meine Freunde!\\n\\n  You know when you go somewhere like Epcot Center and you visit one of their \\"Fine Dining\\" restaurants ... and ... it's \\"good\\" ... but it's still all just a little ... well ... \\"created\\"? Like, if Baudrillard were in town, he'd use the restaurant as the cover to his latest book on simulacra? \\n\\n That's how I'd describe Schmidt's. It's like something straight out of Epcot's \\"World Showcase.\\" Or, if you've never been to Epcot (or experienced, say, the Eiffel Tower ... in Las Vegas), then perhaps, \\"like a German version of a 10% less-authentic Cracker Barrell.\\"\\n\\n  The decor isn't German so much as it's \\"this is our collective idea of pre-war, sausage-swallowing, dark wood Germany.\\" \\n\\n   Similarly, the food is less \\"eat like a German\\" and more \\"Sample Germany's most famous culinary Greatest Hits.\\" \\n\\n  In short, the place is kitschy, but not tacky. The food is predictable, but not bad. In truth, if that was the only issue with it, I'd probably not pick it with so many other amazing restaurants around, but I'd happily go along with others who wished to go. HOWEVER, that's NOT the only issue with it. \\n\\n  For anyone who struggles with crowded spaces, with negative reactions to over-stimulation, or who recoils from loud environments, be aware that THAT aspect of Epcot is here as well. The place is regularly packed--and by \\"packed,\\" I don't simply mean busy. I mean, they have managed to monitize every square inch of the place with tables.The wooden floors and walls mean that the noise of the crowd tends to have a very \\"live\\" bounce back, adding to the cacophany. Standing at the front, near the display cases, things can't help but bottle neck and people squeezing by one another. Now, I am WELL aware that many people LOVE that sort of \\"energy\\" and \\"community\\" atmosphere, and hey! More power to 'em! If that's you, c'mon down to German Village, because you're going to love Schmidts! \\n\\nOn the other hand, if you--like me--have a very hard time dealing with such things, then beware this place pretty much all the time, and ESPECIALLY during peak tourist times."},{"name":"Gus's World Famous Fried Chicken","address":"117 San Jacinto Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"This fried chicken is so spicy  chicken is  crunchy and steming hot the potatoe salad, macaroni and cheese, are truly southern classics full of flavor,  best fried chicken in Texas love this place the sweet tea and lemonade is always on point the pies are incredibly delish this place is a must when Ur in Austin"},{"name":"T'Kilas Tacos & More","address":"1248 Clairmont Rd","city":"Decatur","stars":"3","text":"This location is a part of a chain of your standard \\"Americanized\\" Mexican restaurants.  If I am in the mood for this style of place, this is where I go.  Los Loros doesn't attempt to be a totally authentic hole in the wall or an upscale fine dining establishment so don't expect either of those.  But for this type of restaurant it is very good.  \\n\\nThe chips & salsa arrive quicker here than any other place I've been (they also bring water as well - smart move) and is pretty decent.  The queso is good.  \\n\\nMy entire family swears by the enchiladas verdes, but I come here specifically to get the tacos de carne asada.  Other things I've had (like the quesadilla rellena) have all been good, but just can't beat the carne asada tacos.  These steak tacos are pretty unique for tacos de carne asada - the steak comes in strips that seem to have been stewed in a delicious red sauce.  It is fantastic and different than all the other tacos de carne asada I've had (other places usually just give you a thin, crappy little burnt steak with onions on it for you to cut up and tortillas for you to assemble on your own).  The tacos come with refried beans and rice that are probably the best I've had at this type of restaurant.  Unfortunately, the last couple times I have been these tacos seem to have changed for the worse - it has been just chunks of steak that don't appear to have been really stewed in that sauce.  Also, much saltier than before.  It has been incredibly disappointing and I hope the last few times have been random flukes rather than a long-term change.  They need to get their act together with this one because it is one of the best things on their menu and keeps me coming back.  \\n\\nAnyway, I think a number of these reviews are way too harsh though I'll admit the menu is so large that there are bound to be things that aren't good on it.

It could be the eerie silence each time I've come in, the predominant sound that of the whir of the refrigerator. It could be the decorless interior feeding those vibes to me. It could be the meat packing dishes used as plates. But what I am also not feeling is much soul in the food. The food is cheap eats, but I have to compare it to its brethren, which I see as pretty similar in price rather than the truly cheap eats that others seem to express it as. They offer a smaller size burrito, which seems to be the only difference, whereas the pricing of tacos, burritos, and nachos are fairly comparable to the other taquerias about.\\n\\nHaving had the burritos and tacos here, the food seems to be trying its best to accomplish its goal, which does not seem to be to please the diner, so much as avoid offending the diner. The salsa is just tomato mixed with a small bit of cilantro, seemingly afraid to add other possibilities to avoid issues with those who can not stand the taste of onion relatives. The sour cream is extremely light, almost milky, to avoid offending those who do not want an excess of dairy. The meat is simmered in broth, but seemingly with little in the way of pepper or salt. And I feel as much kick from the hot sauce as throwing a dash of Tabasco into a souffle. It is lower priced than its local competitors, but not that much. The large burritos are $.70 less than at Burritos Express, which load to the brim in flavorful ingredients whereas the ones added to the burrito as 'everything' (rice, salsa, protein, hot sauce) seem light on everything, not in quantity (which is, in Maria's Taqueria's defense, very reasonable for the price), but in flavor. Herrera's, El Triunfo, and Burritos Express seem to not mind offending the occasional customer with their flavors.

My husband and I actually had a \\"date\\" for the first time in months! With the kid hanging out at a friends house, we decided to give The Melting Pot a second chance. Forget about the third time being a charm--this was it for us. \\nWe started with the Cheddar Cheese Fondue which includes Granny Smith apples, veggies, and bread for dipping pleasure. This is the most basic of the cheese choices, but a nice safe bet that compliments the rest of the meal. This is where it starts to get fun. A few pieces of cauliflower drift off your stick, taking a solo swim. As you try to figure out how to stab it, scoop it, grab it . . . desiring that piece over all of the others, you begin to laugh and loosen up. You have to work for your food here, and that's actually what makes it interesting.\\nWhen choosing the Entree cooking style, the Coq au Vin isn't their best seller for nothing--the smell is not overpowering like the Mojo (our first time around) and the flavors are subtle and complimentary to the rest of the meal, which was duck and shrimp and packed with flavor. \\nThe Melting Pot staff is friendly and helpful. They actually seem to enjoy their jobs. Cheers to our fantastic server Jayson, who has been there 7 years! He gave great suggestions on everything from the cheese to the wine to the Cordials & Cognacs. \\nThis relaxed, pleasant atmosphere makes for good times with friends, a perfect first date, or even that five-hundred and forty-third date with an old flame."},{"name":"El Chilito","address":"2225 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"For a quick delicous taco or salad....or taco salad, I'll stop here.

Nothing was terrible, but nothing was good. Went here on a Friday night. Service was friendly, but slow and a little neglectful. I suspected we were going to be disappointed with the food when we got the chips and salsa -- tiny dish of salsa (which didn't get refilled after we asked) and chips that were not fresh and crisp. Our entrees were all disappointing. The tortillas on the enchiladas were mushy and lacking flavor. Fish tacos consisted of fried fish nuggets on a tortilla that fell apart -- no salsa, no slaw, no pico, nothing but fish. It may be this restaurant is aiming for an inoffensive, Americanized version of Mexican, and if that's what they're after, they are close to hitting that mark.

It's these more unusual styles that have got me most excited to see what they're going to do next, but rest assured, if you're a fan of more basic styles, you'll love those beers too.

I was immediately struck by how dark it was -- having worked in a restaurant, I understand why the lights are dimmed, but it felt like midnight in there! I also thought the place settings, although cute, bordered on the cheap side: empty tea containers filled with chopsticks, paper napkins and paper menus. \\n\\nMy friends and I ended up getting soups, a few appetizers and three entrees.The waitress recommended we order to share, since the dishes are served as they are ready. This was a good decision -- my friends and I were able to try a lot of the offerings on the menu this way.\\n\\nThe parsnip and white miso soup was creamy and sweet and had crispy parsnips on top for crunch. I ordered the hot and sour soup: It was hearty, flavorful and had just the right amount of spice. We also ordered the grilled razor clams (succulent chunks of clam with butter and grapefruit -- a really interesting combination) and braised pork belly buns (soft buns with fatty pork belly and pickles -- I should have just ordered five plates of those). \\n\\nFor my entree, I ordered the wok-charred udon noodles. They had a beautiful smoky flavor from the charred soy sauce and a lingering heat from the chili flakes. The bok choy, noodles and chicken were all cooked perfectly. I just wish the plate was bigger! We also ordered the stir fried clams with fermented black bean sauce, which had delicate vermicelli underneath the clams. Lastly, we got the Korean BBQ sloppy joe -- it was indeed sloppy. It had a wonderful sweet BBQ flavor, but it was a little on the greasy side. We ended up eating it with a fork and neglecting most of the bun. Since I can't pass up dessert, I ordered a slice of the coconut cream pie. It was cool, creamy and the perfect way to end the meal.\\n\\nAll in all, I was not disappointed with Myers + Chang.

The ribeye was pretty regular - little cubes marinated and cooked to perfection with some peppers and onions. The collard greens were not too dissimilar from the Southern kind, except less greasy with a bit of heat and sourness which I couldn't quite identify. Not stringy at all either, great stuff. The ater was essentially a really good split pea soup.\\n\\nOur server was kind enough to give us a big basket of injera (bread) to go along with our food.

The staff was very helpful (it was early and uncrowded) and they took us 1/2 an hour before our reservations.  The decor is perfect, warm without being over the top (not your typical greek spot).  We were greeted by name (incidentally EVERY time we were approached they used our names - big points).  We got the meze plates + fish deal for $44/person.  The spreads were good, not what you expect when your med experience is the gyro-hawking greek spots.  Not liking eggplant, I found that one a bit sweet, likewise the red-pepper was a little sweet too.  The grilled octopus, like other reviews note, is spectacular.  The Athenian meatballs were quite good too, the beans that served as a base for the dish quite tasty.  I particularly liked the zucchini fritter and thought it was well-balanced with the tzaziki.  The tuna dish was relatively unremarkable.  It was prepared well, but it lacked something to make it stand out.  I am not a fan of vinegar and found the mushrooms under the tuna a little \\"too pickled\\" for my taste.  My friend loved it.  The calamari was a mistake.  It too was well-prepared but boring and we shouldn't have ordered it.  The tomato sauce that came with it lacked in flavor.  Lastly, the fish (turbot) was dull.  I've never had a caper before with so little taste.  The fish had no real flavor of its own and the butter/caper/lemon combo didn't really do anything for it.  That dish was quite disappointing and we had expected it to be a whole, grilled fish vs. the fillet.  On the whole, everything could have used salt or flavor.  We had a mistake with our bill (the gift card we used came out only showing $20 vs the $75 we were told it was).  Our server graciously went back, researched it and found that we were correct.  The service was outstanding, potentially the best I've had.  And despite the fact that the restaurant was crowded by the time we left, the manager still was stopping by each table.

The decor and food and service had not been settled on and things were still getting together.  I visited again last night and was very pleased with everything new and improved.  \\n\\nI placed a togo order and took a look around.  The place looks great.  A very comfortable dining room with just enough space to keep the crowd big even if you are the only one in the room (which was not the case).  The servers and bartenders are all nice looking ladies (get it? Hottie Hawgs!) who seem to have a grasp on things.  I was a bit worried though that if the place was packed, my bartender might not be able to handle it.  She was a bit confused on which tab was mine and could have been a little more efficient.  No big deal though.\\n\\nI order the pulled pork sandwich on texas toast with spud fries on the side and an order of the smoked wings, dry rub flavor.  While I waited I had a glass of the sweet tea with a hint of peach flavor.  Very tasty and here is where I nit pick.  The bartender poured the glass with not enough ice (we are in the South and ice is required to make ice tea just the right temperature. too little just does not do it) and did not put a lemon on it.  I assume these things to happen when I feel like I am receiving 5 star service whether it is at Hottie Hawgs, Chick-fil-A or Chops Steak house, it's the little things.  So like I said, no big deal, but I just sense the lack of attention from her may multiply when times are busy.

Winter had come early to Boston, the wind was doing a great job whipping through the narrow streets to blow its cold into the crevices of my jacket. I walked briskly to catch up with my friend as we powered through the biting cold. \\"Wait, where is this street? I think, yes, there it is!\\"\\n \\nA tiny restaurant, almost hidden in the folds of the windy street, comes into view. Cozy exposed brick. Large windows that looked into the tiny dining area. 10 tables at most. Most filled with diners, bent over their giant plates of pasta, or engrossed in conversation over bottles of wine. We blew into the restaurant with the wind, and shut the door tightly behind us. We were half an hour late for our reservation, but they still had a table for us. We sat in a tiny two seater up against the window. There was some shuffling around as we peeled off layer upon layer of wrappings while trying not to knock into any of the other diners or knock the delicate wine glasses off the table. \\n \\nWe finally settled into our seats, and while sipping the complimentary Proseco, decided upon an appetizer - fresh buffalo mozzarella lightly breaded in buttery breadcrumbs and fried, served with an assortment of olives and marinated vegetables. I really liked the feel of the restaurant - the new Coldplay album playing in the background, the comforting clink of silverware upon dishes, the low conversations of our fellow restaurant patrons, all highlighted by candlelight and white table cloths. I also liked the way they served their wine - bringing individual carafes for each of our selections. \\n \\nAnd then... the entrees. I ordered their homemade pasta tossed in their marinara with clams. The noodles were... heavenly. Perfectly cooked, and tossed in a delightful red sauce. The clams lent their briney taste to the sauce, and they were also fantastic - cooked just right. Unfortunately the clams did add just a smidgen too much salty flavors to the sauce, but that didn't stop me from eating every bite (so much for having leftovers the next day...), even though the portions were gigantic. My dining companion ordered their mushroom ravioli with a sage butter sauce. I had some serious dish envy... too bad for my lactose intolerancy, or I would have been fighting him for every last bite of that. The smoky meatiness of the mushrooms were complimented with fresh made ravioli wrapper (ravioli pasta?), and the creamy consistency of the butter sauce. I had to close my eyes to capture every heavenly moment.\\n \\nAnd yes... it was heavenly. We finished our leisurely meal, savoring each bite and each sip of wine. A great way to reconnect with a friend. I was loathe to leave the warm folds of this place, but I left with visions of how pasta should be, as there was definitely a lot of love and attention put into my meal.

That's insanely good and something I've never had.\\" I had two that night! My brief conversations with the owner when visiting my table tell me he gets it, knows what he's looking to achieve, and will stop and nothing to deliver greatness. Give Bauhaus time to season its staff, operations, and wine list, and this will be a tour de force in fine dining in Vancouver."},{"name":"Common Ground Coffee Roasters","address":"1727 Revere Beach Pkwy","city":"Everett","stars":"4.5","text":"This place was right by our hotel and we walked over for a late lunch after arriving in town.

The wait for Friday lunch was not bad. We arrived at 12:45 and was told to come back in 30 min (1:15PM). We got back as told and was seated within 5 minutes. Great wait system! Service was also a plus. \\n\\nThe menu covers a good variety of options, including a bunch of Mediterranean ones. We ordered:\\n¬∑Le Complet (4.5 stars) - medium-rare (beautifully done) flatiron steak + 2 sunny-side up eggs + caramelized onions + goat cheese on foccacia crostini + large bed of salad with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. Is it too heavy to have steak for brunch/lunch?? Not if you are starving after 5+ hours of flying. That said, the steak was tender and satisfying; the runny eggs were so yummy as a dipping sauce and binded everything together - all the flavors worked well together. \\n¬∑Harissa \\"burger\\" (4 stars) - preserved lemon and harissa-spiced ground beef inside a grilled pita (like a thin Chinese pancake) + tomato salsa + baba ganoush + hummus + 2 sunny eggs + salad. Initially we didn't seen any beef, we asked the waiter whether we got the vegetarian version. She explained that the beef was inside the pita HaHa. We found the beef and proceeded to really enjoy it. Our only complain was we wanted more hummus/baba ganoush as sauce (you get a little bit of each smeared on the plate, not enough!) \\n\\nMy boyfriend tried the General Pour Cocktail, that day was the \\"Rusty Cage\\"- it was $12, but $1 goes to some foundation for kids. The cocktail had rye whiskey and maple syrup amongst other ingredients. I'm usually not a fan of whiskey cocktail, but this one was good, not too much alcohol, pleasant and enjoyable (for someone who likes fruity cocktails). \\n\\nTip: Come before you get too hungry, and be prepared to eat some delicious MEAT"},{"name":"Bijou Cafe","address":"132 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Vegetarian options that are LEGIT.

The cr√®me brulee also had a nice 'shell,' in a different way (hard, like the top of a cr√®me brulee), but the booziness of the Cointreau was too overpowering and ruined it for me. The bacon on the maple bacon was not cooked enough at all and was kinda gross. It should be really crispy for better texture. $13 for three donuts.

When asking the cashier if she could check on our order she said No, we had to talk with the manager. Back to the counter and a second manager was there. He could not find our order on the screen. He then yelled to the staff behind the counter to get him 2 burgers. A woman pointed at 2 trays  that had been pushed out of the way on the back of the counter and yelled that our order was there.

The $8 portion is right for lunch. Portions are generous imo. This is a vegetarian paradise but they also serve plenty of savory meat options.

I'm giving SKD a 4.5,  but rounding it up to 5 because it's as good as it gets in Portland! \\nWe picked from the combo menu (seafood soft tofu soup + spicy chicken). It was all really good, except for the banchan (side dishes)... which can be improved. \\nThere are different kinds of soft tofu soup flavors you can choose from like beef, pork, and seafood. The broth is the same for all of them and you can choose the level of spiciness. Warning: Soondooboo (soft tofu soup) is normally spicy to begin with.... even the medium was pretty spicy.  You also have the option of an egg... the server will crack it in for you, but don't worry because it will cook right away due to the hot stone pot. I like the egg because it neutralizes the spiciness.\\n\\nUnlike the previous soft tofu soup place, Hosoonyi's (which I wasn't very fond of by the way), SKD serves rice in the hot stone pot.  So for those who aren't familiar with the whole stone pot deal, here's the 411:  The server will take some of the rice out of the hot pot and transfer it to a normal bowl and leave the rest of the rice that's on the bottom. He/she will pour hot water in the pot and you're supposed to let it sit for awhile. Towards the end of the meal, open the lid of the pot (with a napkin..it's super hot), and enjoy the warm rice/water. The rice will be golden brown. You can finish off the rest of the soondooboo with the rice/water in the hot pot. I remember reading a review awhile ago and this man was complaining how a korean restaurant he went to burned the bottom of the rice in the stone pot blah blah blah... uhhm, well, it's supposed to be like that! Usually that happens when you order bibimbap (mixed rice) in the stone pot. the bottom gets crispy and you can either eat it like that or add water (it's called nooreungji). \\n\\nThe place was super clean and everything is brand new. They even have Korean BBQ tables - I'll try this next time. The service was prompt, but even if they aren't, don't wait around to catch a server..  just ring the bell on your table for service!\\n\\nI liked the soondooboo and the taste wasn't heavy with MSG like some other soft tofu places I've eaten at. I heard all the BCD chains in LA for instance, have changed everything to organic and got rid of the MSG. Hopefully SKD will follow suit!\\n\\nOverall, a great K-restaurant to try out.

In fact, her comments very much reflect my take on this place.  My girlfriend and I live in the neighborhood and have really wanted to give this place a chance on a number of occasions as the area lacks something in between Cambridge Common's pub fare and West Side Lounge/Temple Bar's more expensive dining.  We like the decor, the music, the concept but that is about all at this point.\\n\\nToday, we went for brunch and had a pretty awful experience.  My girlfriend ordered pancakes and I ordered a Mediterranean omelet.  My food was fine if nothing to write home about.  My girlfriend's pancakes were, as she described them, more like \\"biscuits.\\"  They had a hard outer shell and were barely warmer than room temperature, despite our fairly simple food taking nearly 30 minutes to come out to us.  It then took another 10-15 minutes for our server to ask us how we were and to notice that the pancakes weren't being eaten.  In our waiter's defense, she had just started and really tried to make things right when she found out.  At that point, my girlfriend changed her order to an omelet.  This was fine, although accompanied by home fries that tasted no better than Shaw's frozen home fries.  Perhaps the coup de grace, though, was when we got our bill and we had been charged more for the omelet rather than just the price of the abandoned, original pancakes.\\n\\nI don't want to sound nit-picky.  My larger point is this: this place is, while not extremely expensive, certainly overpriced for consistently mediocre to poor service and consistently sub-par food.

Portions are very southern hospitality sized and the coffees are great. The only thing that put me off was how hard the biscuit with my breakfast was. I was really hoping for a more moist and soft biscuit, but otherwise everything else was great. The cornbread was also phenomenal, and had that moist/soft component to it that I like with my breads."},{"name":"Phara's Mediterranean Cuisine","address":"111 E North Loop Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I don't live in Austin and picked this place based on my fellow Yelper reviews.

The location on Blake St. gets it perfect, but the one on Hampden isn't so great either. I'm not sure why. It mostly has to do with presentation. Maybe the people at these two locations lack the passion. However, I'm only talking about the salsa that comes on the side of a wet burrito, which doesn't really have an effect on the overall flavor, so this location and the Hampden location are still pretty awesome. I give this one 4.5 stars as well, since it just doesn't match the quality of the Blake St. location.

I wanted to like this place right from the start. We were greeted warmly, and even through some minor seating issues the staff was gracious and made us feel welcome. The atmosphere of the restaurant is really cool, sort of urban, funky, European. Very nice.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the food is where everything fell apart. We started with bread, olive oil, and an assortment of salami. Simple. How can this go wrong. The bread was burnt. Not extra crusty artisan, just burnt. I thought maybe it was just bad luck we got a burnt loaf, but from our table I could see the bin where the bread was kept. Every loaf was blackish grey. The olive oil (I believe we ordered the fruity variety) had a strange bitter flavor. The salami was fine. So, we salvaged what we could of the interior of the bread and paired that with the salami and soldiered on to the next round.\\n\\nWe ordered lamb, rabbit, and potato pancakes. The potatoes suffered the same fate as the bread, burnt. Slathered with sour cream. I'm guessing to disguise singed potatoes. The lamb was so tough that much of it wound up discarded in our napkins. The rabbit literally had us begging our server for extra water. I don't think I've ever suffered through meat this dry before, including some pretty wicked bad turkey dinners at family Thanksgivings.\\n\\nNow here's where I made the biggest mistake of the evening. I held out hope that dessert might offer some sort of sweet redemption. So we ordered the red velvet cake, which I really liked the idea of. It wasn't some fancy deconstructed version of cake complete with foam or chocolate air or whatever people are doing now. Just cake. Cool. It wasn't terrible, but sweet redemption it was not. The texture was a bit oily, and the flavor was just off. Maybe lemon or mint or food coloring. I still can't identity it. The cake did put an exclamation point on our trip to Portland.

It was fun to watch but since our table was right next to the bar, it can get too overwhelming as people start bumping into the tables and waiters squeeze themselves in between the crowded walkway.\\n\\nService: The service seemed really rushed and the waiter at our table, at first, did not seem so happy to give us the recommendations. But as the night proceeds, he became friendlier. However, our water was barely filled and we would always have to flag down some other waiter to get our waters. I don't like the fact that my waiter held the glass by the rims - your hands aren't that clean, I'm certain. I didn't want to make a fuss about it so I just let it be.\\n\\n2 surprising things that happened during the night: we got an extra grilled hanger steak because the kitchen \\"made too much\\" and  also a free crepe dessert because the kitchen \\"messed up some orders\\". Not quiet sure why they would offer it to us - but that was nice of them, I guess.\\n\\nThe food, overall, was OK. I'm not the biggest fan.\\n\\nWe ordered quiet a few dishes:\\n1. Hanger Steak with Truffle Vinnegrette - cooked perfectly, medium rare with the perfect sauce pairing. The taste of truffle was strong and the meat was really tender. This was the best dish I had at the restaurant - can't have enough of it (10/10) ** Order this! **\\n\\n2. Chorizo with Sweet & Sour Figs - Some sausage with some sweet sauce that came with it along with 3 pieces of figs. I really liked it and I'm not the hugest fan of sausages but the meat was so good. The only thing I wish they could do was give more figs! There's not enough for all the sausage pieces (9/10) **try this**\\n\\n3. George's Bank Sea Scallops - The scallops were cooked perfectly, it was sweet and soft with an interesting sauce on the side. The sauce was really creamy but if you ask whether it's worth the price ($11.50) I wouldn't say so, there are places that make better scallops. The outside of the scallops weren't as crispy as I hope it would be like other restaurant's (6/10)\\n\\n4. Roasted Bone Marrow - This was a disappointment because we did not taste the bone marrow at all. It was more like a pie where the crispy flour was on the top of the bone marrow and under it were minced meat (I think?) and it was over cooked. (1/10) **don't order**\\n\\n5. Jam√≥n Serrano  - This was alright, they gave 5 slices of meat. The meat was a bit too dried , as if it was left out for a while. The ones in Toro were much better (3/10)\\n\\n6. Some Grilled Lamb - Forgot what it was called, the lamb was soo hard and chewy. I hated this dish the most, I can't even cut through the meat, it was so dried and tasted really bland (1/10) **don't order**\\n\\n7.Paella Mariscos (for one) - I was allergic to squid so I didn't get to try it. My friends said that the one in Toro was more flavorful but Barcelona did give more seafood than Toro. They rated this a 7/10.\\n\\n8. Crepe - the crepes were amazing, the crepe very soft and plenty of cream/nutella (i think) stuffings. They were generous with their chocolate sauce on top (9/10) -- Try this!"},{"name":"Schmidt's Sausage Haus","address":"240 E Kossuth St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"This has been a favorite stop for us in CBus!

Especially the egg rolls. They were big and crisp and had a very nice filling of veggies and pork. We also had the pot stickers and they were also very good though I wasn't a fan of the sauce they came with. For my entree I had the bourbon chicken which I was told would be spicy but I didn't really detect any spice to speak of. It was very tasty just not spicy which would have been nice. The chicken itself was in big chunks with a nice light tempura type breading and there were plenty of fresh bright veggies in the dish. My husband had the crispy honey chicken and it was good though the sauce lacked dimension for us. You couldn't really detect the honey or any other flavor besides just sweet. It wasn't bad by any means but the bourbon chicken was far better. For dessert I had the trio of sorbets and they were really good especially the raspberry!

All those times have been for dinner, and I usually get there after their initial dinner rush. It's nice they have longer hours so you can show up at 10:00pm and still not feel rushed. \\n\\nYou can sit inside, or take the slightly more open outside patio area in warmer months. I honestly haven't paid too much attention to the decor, but just the look of it feels like a log cabin for some reason. But very open and airy. It does have a hip vibe, and always seems to have a decent gathering of customers. \\n\\nFood wise, I've gotten the meat tibs + 2 side tems most of the time. You can pick from a wide variety of meat dishes, served with various sides. Most meats are cooked with onions and peppers, and well seasoned with some spices. Lots of flavor, and the meat is savory and not overcooked. If you don't know what a certain side dish is, their menu has a glossary of terms on the side to help you out. I really like that feature! Some of the side dishes I can vouch for are the miser (stewed lentils), gomen (suateed collard greens), and ater (split peas). If you've never had it before, I would almost liken it to Indian food, except maybe less use of milk or butter. You will also receive their signature injera, which I could only describe as a spongey pancake roll that you use to \\"cup\\" your food (if you want to eat the traditional way with your hands... oh, and PLEASE wash your hands first. They have some extra sinks for that). \\n\\nDessert wise, I've had their baklava. It's a very sweet and flaky pastry, and you can get it hot or cold depending on your mood. It's good, but I would suggest the Napoleon cake first. It too is flaky, but filled with a light cream, perfect amount of sweetness. Everything is just really balanced, and you got a nice sized portion too. And although I haven't had them, there's a few types of cheesecakes available too. If you're lucky enough to sit by the one seat that's right in front of the cake display, you'll get an upclose look before deciding on which one you want. \\n\\nI would also recommend you go with a few friends and try sharing a platter. Most recently got the 3 meat platter. It'll get you in the spirit of communal eating, as everyone takes a little bit of each dish and enjoy a good chat with one another. It's a different experience than most restaurants you'd go to where everyone has an individual order. \\n\\nService wise, I've never had any complaints and the servers are glad to answer questions or make suggestions. I think pretty much everyone who works there is Ethiopian too, so they have a good idea on this stuff is supposed to be. \\n\\nIf you want something a little out of the ordinary, that is full of flavor, definitely check out Desta!

It wasn't, it was a turkey patty on a bun. Perhaps that was my bad since I was ordering from a burger place after all. My friend ordered no mayo but got mayo. I ordered an alcoholic drink, he checked my ID and said it would be brought to me. After receiving our food 20 minutes later I still didn't have my drink. Asked the waitress about it and she said she would check. She never came back. After looking at the receipt I see that he never even rang it up. At least I didn't pay for something I didn't receive, I guess. Had to ask for a to-go bag at the bar since our waitress never came back (even to let me know there wasn't an order at the bar for my drink) and was busy at a table of men for more than five minutes while putting her number in their phone.

My three star rating is a reflection that I am giving them the benefit of the doubt that as a new establishment they are still working out some things.  Ultimately I left with a \\"eh\\" kind of feeling and if it wasn't for the fact this we a weekday, I would have headed to West Side or Temple Bar for their brunch menu.  After reading the reviews on Yelp I am noting a patter that perhaps brunch/breakfast is just not their strength.  People seem to be more upbeat about their evening/afternoon meals. \\n\\nPros:\\nIt's the only sit-down place on this stretch of Mass Ave serving real breakfast everyday. Good spot for early morning meetings before the workday.\\n\\nDownside;\\nThey open at 7am and we arrived at 7:15 and the door was locked --though there were people inside. Easily fixed by knocking on the door. \\n\\nI had higher expectations of an organic menu and was surprised to receive an egg white omelet and hash browns swimming in  grease/oil. I dabbed it with my napkin. I would have sent it back but the server was having a rough enough start to a day between not having coffee (the only choice was lattes or espresso)  and a few other breakfast staples missing from their inventory that I decided not to push on the grease bit. It seemed like they were genuinely surprised anyone showed up for breakfast.\\n\\nThe vibe needs to be worked on. The space echos the awkwardness of its staff; everyone trying to be something but not sure what that is supposed to be. I haven't researched the establishment but I am left with the impression this is someone's first time owning and running a dining establishment. Essentially they are trying blend a cafe atmosphere with full bar vibe. Find your core purpose and things will probably start to fall into place better. \\n\\nI plan to go back to try lunch.

It has to be one of my all time favorite things to eat in Austin. I will drive out of the way just to get an order to go sometimes and get two so I can savor it over a few days. The huge succulent chunks of chicken breast are perfectly marinated in a blend of yogurt, garlic, ginger and other delectable spices and served sizzling on a buttery platter with caramelizing onions and a side of marsala sauce for dipping. I like to think of them as Indian fajitas. A close second is the Jhinga sholay, which is basically the same dish but made with shrimp. One can't go wrong with either. \\n\\nTheir signature dish the Khuroos-E-Tursh are meltingly tender medallions of chicken simmered in a decadent cashew/almond cream sauce that will guarantee an extra few miles on the treadmill, but are worth every step for such sinful creaminess. While we have also tried the classics such as vindaloo, korma and coconut curry (always ordered extra spicy so my eyeballs almost start to bleed), I can't stop going back to the kabobs. Coupled with a fluffy onion naan- you just can't go wrong.

Use your imagination to put in whatever Yelpers you wish. Kind of like radio with printed words, or, oh, what do you call them.....Books!)\\n\\nWe had made a very good plan. Meet up with several other Yelper couples to try out Barley Swine. None of us had been there before and we were all anxious to try it. With a no reservation policy, we knew getting a table for six would be a bit of an issue, and since one couple was coming from the North side after work we knew we wouldn't all be together until 7:30 or so on a Friday night, but we are Yelpers and don't know the meaning of despair.  So it was decided that we would meet Yelper couple 1 (YC1) at Barley Swine at 6:30, put our names in, and then go to a nearby bar to wait it out, and Yelper couple 2  (YC2. What? It would have looked odd if I hadn't done it) would meet us for drinks and we'd all saunter back to Barley Swine and revel in their novel and unique dishes. \\n\\nThe plan worked flawlessly at first. We met YC1 and their lovely friend who was joining us for drinks, put our names in, and the very nice hostess even took YC1's cell number and said she'd call us when the table was close to being ready. Great! \\n\\nSo we toddled off to the horseshoe Lounge, secure in the knowledge that dinner was going to be great.  The Horseshoe was fun, but I wanted a glass of whiskey and Horseshoe is Beer & wine, so we toddled on to Black Sheep where we parked on bar stools and avoided being stabbed by dart throwers while we chatted and waited for YC2, who arrived right on time around 7:15. The combination of Liquor and danger made this part of the evening very exciting. We had more drinks at Black Sheep and chatted away and in general had a wonderful time. Then, about 8:30, the cell phone rings and the helpful hostess is on the other end. Woo Hoo! We're all a bit hungry and so we walk rather quickly back to Barley Swine ready to be wowed. This is where the plan fell apart. \\n\\nWe squeezed in the door and the very helpful hostess said it would just be a minute. The other party had paid their check and was getting ready to leave. Time crawled by. Barley Swine is a nice place. Smallish. Actually that may not be properly descriptive. Little may not even be the right word. Tiny. Infinitesimal. And a group of six standing at the doorway takes up all the available space in the room. Every time a server came by I had to bump against the back of the man sitting next to me at the nearest table. It was awkward and I mouthed or murmured 'sorry' several times. His dinner companion turned out to be Drew Barrymore, who just turned and smiled at me. Lovely woman. Her smiling at me was the high point of this period where we stood around like day laborers outside the Home Depot, hoping to be chosen. \\n\\nTime dragged on. Our table's occupants felt no great pressure to leave. We became intimate with the servers brushing by us. I began to look forward to one's hip action in particular. The very helpful hostess was very sympathetic. Hunger became an issue. \\n\\nWe were seated at roughly 10 pm, much to the relief of Ms Barrymore's dining companion I'm sure. And the food was ordered. Barley Swine's dishes are essentially large tapas sized and meant to be shared by the table so that everyone gets a few bites. Thus you order a lot of different plates. I ordered everything on the specials board. YC1 & YC2 ordered most of the menu. We were hungry by this time, and a bit grumpy from waiting so long at the door. \\n\\nThe food pace was slow. I'm sure they meant us to savor the plates, but our hunger overrode that. Also, between six people, the plates represented a bite or two each. Nothing wrong with this at all, just something to note. \\n\\nI remember the roe and melon plate, the pork belly plate, and the two dessert plates. Don't misunderstand, all the food was good and presented beautifully, but it was food at that point, not an experience. This is too bad. I liked Barley Swine, in fact I probably liked it more than everyone else in our party, but I didn't love it because we had to wait so long to eat and because the pace of the meal was too slow, again probably because we were so hungry we wanted food to appear quicker. The drinks were good, the servers were knowledgeable and friendly, and a good effort was made to serve us well. The timing just blew. \\n\\nThe bill was I believe $310 before tip. Not terrible for six people and roughly two drinks apiece. Overall, the size of the place creates turnover issues and that became the thing I remember most about the evening after how much fun I had talking to YC1 and YC2. I'd come here again, although I'm not sure my companions would agree.

The decor was just so on point: not because it was a recreation of those kinfolk-vibe wooden table 100% instagrammable restaurants where people wait in lines to have brunch in (alright, I'm really thinking of Puritan&Co. here) but because the inside looked like an ironic, incredibly cool version of a typical Chinese restaurant. The huge pink dragon that adorned the wonderfully modern glass walls was a good start, and as we went in, we were met with cool aluminium tables like the ones found in Chinatown or a Singaporean Kopitium, but underneath the metallic golden lightbulbs they felt clean and chic. Red paper chopsticks were found in aluminium tin cans with the words \\"Jasmine Tea\\" printed on their sides, whilst from the open kitchen a flash of fire rose up as the chef brought something to the flame. \\n\\nThe food at Myers and Chang was everything that I expected, which was good. The sweet and sour brussel sprouts were crispy and a little too oily for my taste, but my were they good. I mean, I love brussel sprouts anyway, but the seasoning and the little shallots they came with made it a sinful pleasure. Speaking of sinful pleasures, the pork belly baos came in buns that were so soft that I took a tiny breath as I picked it up, because I felt as if I was touching something delicate and babylike and I didn't want them to ever leave my hands. I can't say I was quite as taken with the flavor of the baos themselves, but they were so cute I can't say anything bad about them at all, even if I tried. The true standout was the kimchee quinoa bokkeumbap: with soft, flavorful bulgoki beef and deliciously seasoned quinoa, perfectly paired with broccoli and crunchy pistachios, it was a dish that makes me want to come back and try every one of Myers+Chang's entrees."},{"name":"Blue Star Donuts","address":"1155 SW Morrison St, Ste 102","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Perfection!

Although this place is rather temperamental (aka: hit or miss), they manage to nail some key Chinese menu items that a lot of places fail at. This includes everything from rice noodles to steamed fish to sweet and sour pork.\\n\\nHowever, my favourite menu item has to be their specialty lobster with sticky rice. It is served in this mega-sized bamboo steamer and it comes with a whole lobster, scallops, and prawns. It is so delicious! The seafood is always perfectly cooked, the rice is sticky as ever, and the flavours melt together in this beautiful concoction. \\n\\nIn terms of service, keep in mind that this is a Chinese restaurant so the servers won't waste time with pleasantries. That being said, their service is far superior than many other Chinese restaurants that I have been to. They are ever attentive and always notice when you need a new plate.\\n\\nAll in all, a family staple.

They have a range of cocktails and a wider range of sandwiches.  I feel like the sandys here are a hit or a miss, yes famous chefs have spit out their unique creations just for this cafe but not everything is good.  Let's start with the good: The Regal Regis by Susan Regis (Upstairs by the Square)- the sliced flank steak marinated in soy embedded between white bread is really juicy and not dry at all.  The potato salad goes so well with the sandwich- the tartness of the salad balances out the meaty sandwich.   Okay the bad: Rowdy's Famous Chicken Sandwich was dry chicken, melted cheese and roll.  Yes, not going to lie the aoli sauce was yummy but not enough for me to say the whole dish was too.  Both dishes were super filling, it is a lot of food.\\n\\nThey are open a bit later than other eateries so it's definitely a place to chill without getting kicked out at 12.

I have returned to this Cactus Club a number of times and found it to be hit and miss on service but consistent for the food until the other night. I had family visiting from out of town that had food allergies, so we looked at the menu ahead of time and even called the restaurant to confirm that the food allergies could be accommodated.  They assured me that it would not be a problem and to let our server know about the allergies and they would be taken seriously.\\n\\nWe arrive at the restaurant about 30 minutes later and are seated immediately. After a few minutes the waiter returns with our drinks and takes our order.\\nMy mother ordered the Feenie burger with a gluten free bun after we once again confirmed that it did not have garlic in it. We were very specific that she had allergies to Dairy, and Garlic and needed to have a gluten free meal. I watched as the waiter clearly wrote these facts on the ticket that was going to the kitchen and he assured us none of these things would be a problem. \\n\\nThe burger arrives and my mother looks at the man who brought it and asks \\"You are sure this is a gluten free bun?\\" He looks at the burger and says \\"No, this is not a gluten free bun\\" STRIKE ONE!! So he takes it back to the kitchen after asking if it is necessary to remake the burger or if they can just take the existing burger and put it on the gluten free bun. My ma not wanting to be a bother says \\"no problem just put it on a gluten free bun no need to remake it.\\" The manager returns a moment later to offer his apologies and offer her a free drink while she is waiting. STRIKE TWO! Do you really think you can make it right by handing out some free booze? This is a food allergy that can have detrimental health effects on someone. We politely decline the drinks and then she asks \\"Can you please confirm the mushrooms were not sauteed in butter?\\" He says yes and heads back to the kitchen. 2 minutes later he returns and confirms the mushrooms were indeed sauteed in butter. STRIKE THREE! At this point I get cranky and step in demanding he personally go to the kitchen and supervise the remaking of the meal with no dairy, garlic, or gluten products. He tries to assure me that this issue is being taken seriously and is being used as a training opportunity. He then offers some free appetizer while she is waiting for the burger to be remade. She accepts and he brings her some Edamame. \\n\\nThe burger finally shows up and the manager is now very apologetic and assures us it is done correctly. He asks if there is anything else he can do for us and then steps away. At this point I recall being there  two weeks before and being insulted by the waitress. My wife had asked if there was any specials that day and with as much attitude as she could muster the waitress said\\" No I'm sorry we don't sell discounted food here!\\"  That night we were tired and hungry so chose to let it go but did not leave any tip. I wrote it off to being tired and hungry and went back the following week and had a good meal with good service. \\n\\nNot sure if it was my loud mention that it was my intention to write a scathing review of this location while the manager was in ear shot but he then sidled up to the table once more and told us our meal was on the house because of the multiple problems. He then introduced himself as Thomas and once again apologized for the mistakes. \\n\\nNow in my mind there is fixing a problem and then there is making it right. He did indeed fix the problem but until that point he had not made it right. My kudos to Thomas for doing his best to handle a poor service experience and for making things right not only fixing the mistake.

The main issues were:\\n1. When we walked in, there was no host/hostess to seat us. Instead, there was a woman sitting at a reception desk on the phone who failed to acknowledge our existence despite me trying to make eye contact with her multiple times. After about a minute of this awkwardness, one of the waiters finally flagged down the host.\\n2. The chicken fajitas for two was very unimpressive for multiple reasons. First, it was more like a single serving of chicken (about two breasts), and the peppers and onions were almost raw. It was actually not surprising that they were almost raw, since there was not one iota of steam coming off of the platter when they brought it out. It's amazing to me that they went to the trouble of buying the iron skillets, but they aren't even using them for their intended purpose.\\n3. The waitress had no idea what she was doing. First, she brought me and my wife two different sizes of bean/rice/lettuce plates to go with our fajitas (my wife's plate was normal size, and mine was about half that size). When I said something, at first she tried to brush me off, but upon my insisting, she finally brought me a normal size plate. Second, at the end of the meal after she had swiped my credit card and I had signed the receipt, she came by and picked up the receipt while we were still sitting there. Everyone in the restaurant industry knows this is extremely impolite, because she was effectively checking to see how much we had tipped her while we were still in the restaurant. Luckily, I'm a good tipper.\\n4. The bathroom was a disaster. First, there was an oily substance on the floor, so I almost slipped on the way in. Second, the toilet was nasty, with urine all over it.

I won't even go into the fact that there were random wires sticking out of holes in the wall.\\nAs I said, this place is not worth going to in its current state.

Of course, when the wife and I packed our bags, moved out of Austin,  and headed out west, we just assumed that we'd be saying 'goodbye' to the fantastic mexican/tex mex food we've come to know and love.\\n\\nOur first stop was San Francisco, where we lived for a little over 2 years.  San Francisco has the Mission District, of course, known for it's small carts and numerous burrito joints.  Sure, there were some diamonds hiding in the rough, but it still didn't capture the essence of what we'd left behind.\\n\\nAfter growing tired of paying our rent in gold and first born just to survive, we decided to head north to Portland, Austin's so-called 'sister city'.  Of course, we assumed the 'sister' would be still quite lacking in food of the mexican variety.  Comfort food?  Oh, yes, the PDX has got a plethora of that for certain. \\n\\nBut what if you're craving that a little bit of brother Austin?  \\n\\nEnter La Superior.  No, it's not Austin, and it's not really trying to be.  What it is, though, is just simple, good, honest mexican food.  I've had the breakfast a la mexicana, which is fantastic.  Nothing like homemade corn tortillas with your meal to give you a warm, fuzzy feeling inside.  And, let's not forget the salsa bar with some decent varieties--verde, tomatilla, and Rojas.  Now, the salsas are...ok.  Nothing to write home about, and I guess that's where they fall just a little short in comparison to what the wife and I are accustomed to back home.  \\n\\nAll in all, this place is a find, and it will surely make those trips back to Texas not seem quite as urgent as they used to be."},{"name":"Myers & Chang","address":"1145 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"It's really not that authentic of Taiwanese cuisine.

But we didn't feel like pigs for doing so because of the small plate/community format. Three to four plates are recommended per person (the dishes are fairly rich so that is ample for a big appetite) and we sampled seven of the nine savory dishes and two of the three sweet offerings. \\nThe grilled broccoli with shaved apples, garlic chips, green onion creme fraiche with crushed duck egg and goats milk ricotta was a hearty, clean start. Then followed a cauliflower (raw and grilled) with a masa dumpling and chile sauce in which little cocoa nibs spiked each bite with a deep chocolatey spark.\\nThe chicken fried chicken atop green garlic grits and romanesco was one of my favorites. It's true artistry to marry a perfectly soft cooked egg to a uniform, crunchy, tasty fry.\\nTime to bring on the swine. Sweet potato, grilled bacon (the kind that is like one of the cubes in a Rubik's cube and one half is salty, thick meat and the other half is soft fluffy fat), candied pecans, crispy kale with chipotle and a cooling scoop of yogurt, was a sublime introduction.\\nThe special was a plate of various prepared pig parts. Most notable was the ankle (sort of like a crab cake, but not- interesting yet yummy), the tenderloin- best I've ever had, and here I must suggest you embrace the efficient concept of using the whole animal- while thanking it for it's nourishment and generosity- as the face was the most compelling component on the plate. Literally a collection of meat from around the face and jowels it came together in harmony, texture and flavor beautifully. \\nFor dessert, we had the hemp seed brownie with peanut dust (?.....!) and banana ice cream and the pumpkin pot de creme. In short, both were delicious and curious at the same time. Each dish at this place is more like an event, a topic of conversation with the diners bringing out their inner culinary detective to dissect each component in front of them.\\nOur server Cassie (really more like our friend and tour guide) was an enthusiastic educator as well as a bit of a hoot. And thank goodness, because we certainly put her through the ringer with our questions, conversation and photoging.\\nFrom the bar, it seems we could see the whole operation and it ran like a well-oiled machine with happy, professional yet down to earth people in every role and high integrity on every front.\\nAnd look out for their next restaurant The Odd Duck coming soon.

It's tucked far away from the hustle and bustle of downtown Friday night in Austin - it's in a run-down 'strip mall' (a term I'm using loosely because when this place was built, the strip mall concept had thankfully not hit Austin yet). \\n\\nOur party of four was seated outside at a table in a little gazebo area. The only thing that Phara's could have done to make this better was to add a fan or turn off the heat outside (e.g., the sun). We picked a hot and humid day to visit as it turns out, but this place is BYOB, so we tore into the wine right away to forget the possibility of heat stroke and get to the business at hand (eating, drinking and laughing). \\n\\nWe decided to eat family style - not really referenced on the menu, but that's how we wanted to roll that night. We tried the hummus (best stuff since - gasp - the Alligator Grill's!) and the beef and chicken kebobs. I think the chicken kebabs were my favorite. We also had some mango ice cream for dessert. The owner, Phara, came to our table several times to talk to us and ask us if she could get us anything. I thought that was really nice and genuine. I like when owners come talk to us little people. The wait staff was also totally accommodating and had great attitudes. \\n\\nThen the party got started. \\n\\nA belly dancer (I think her name was Imara) came out and danced. She had on this pink \\"I Dream of Jeannie\\" outfit and a smokin body. I watched in awe and thought to myself how it would be a great core workout. Later that night, she came to the gazebo and gave us a couple of lessons. Also, she was very nice and it turns out, she does give lessons somewhere in South Austin. \\n\\nFinally, our group decided to smoke a hookah. I thought they would bring out a menu of flavors a la Amsterdam style, since our waitress rattled off about 50 combinations. We chose the melon-mint flavor. They brought \\"Big Bertha\\" to the table (that was the name of the bong) and they gave everyone a sanitary mouth piece.

I can't wait to show them off to more friends and out of town visitors, as though I had a hand in their singular excellence! \\n\\nFirst, the catfish po' boy... Oh boy! Therre were so many succulent, perfectly, which is to say, lightly breaded filets filled this little gordito, that I actually had to remove several of them in order to fit them into my ever gluttonous aperture. That's like the ice cream shoppes that let you have the stainless steel cup that mixed your milkshake, w/all the extra that couldn't fit into the regular milkshake cup. Unbridled joy! The only complaint about the po' boy, and it is admittedly a pretty small one, is they should consider looking at more robust hoagie rolls, as this sandwich was exploding into mulch between my fingers after only a couple bites into the beast. Look for something like at best baguette- that's fluffy on the inside, but so delightfully crunchy and crispy on the outside, strong enough to hold the delicious innards of your po boys....\\n\\nEvery side dish I tried at Southland I greatly enjoyed, including the greens, the shrimp and grits (decadence thy name is Southland), and the tasso sticks w/the gorgeous chunks o' jamon and grits provide such a pleasing mouthfeel. It wasn't too long into this meal that I realized we were dealing with some highly skilled craftsmen who knew what they were doing.

We were hungry when we got there, and after somewhat slow service, we devoured our appetizer of fried bread stuffed with beef (sha phaky).

As we waited in line we were given a number for our table and after ordering and making our way to the table, a party of four people were sitting there. No big deal, there was an empty table for two right next to it and I notified the girl who gave us our table number that somebody was in our seat and we would take the next table. This would not have been a big deal except our drinks were sent to the table next to us and they were as confused as we were when we asked them kindly to hand over our drinks. \\n\\nMy husband ordered a classic burger, well done with no mayo. I ordered the Llano Poblano well done with no mustard. His burger arrived with mayo literally dripping out of it and my burger was pink throughout. By this time it was to late to ask anybody to correct the order, because there really are not any waiters or waitresses once they bring the food out. The table next to us asked us on more than one occasion if we were sure that the burgers given to us were not theirs, and we figured out that they were not. The french fries were weird almost sour cream and onion tasting with some other kind of mysterious seasoning that tasted like body odor smells.\\n\\nIt was also incredibly noisy on a Tuesday night and was not the best choice on my part for a date night. Whether it was my poor decision making to go there on date night or Hopdoddy's lack of organization, we will not be returning. Their chocolate milkshakes were insanely good and the guy who took our order was super friendly. That is all I got on the positives of Hopdoddy.

I had the chopped salad (without salami or prosciutto) and the braised brussels sprouts in balsamic reduction. I am in love with brussels sprouts again! These were amazing. The wine, an Italian sauvignon blanc, was good. Husband had a scoop (a real scoop, not a little bite) of pistachio ice cream for dessert. For $2 this is the best ice cream deal in town. The only complaint was the piped music from circa 1962-1965. Unfortunately I knew the words to all the songs from my late latency-early adolescence. I guess it is part of the charm of the place.

Shoyu - dark and playful for those who want to flood their taste buds with the heaviness and salty soy flavor, best aftertaste imo. Miso - creamy and rich for those who truly want to take their ramen slow and enjoy every single bite, best with combination of extra nori and negi to balance out the thick and rich soup base.\\n\\nToppings: You gotta come back over and over again to go through their topping list. Not because there is a lot, but it is because you want to try different combinations that make their ramen great!\\n\\nSizes: variable which gives YOU control over what you're eating. Even the broth has different flavor levels that the chef can modify to fit your need. This just shows the knowledge that the workers behind the scene possess, catering to your needs while maintaining the integrity of the ramen dish.\\n\\nSummary: Go go go go go here! and be careful of the spicy and killer meat ;)"},{"name":"Shorty's","address":"201 W 5th St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Stopped here last night after imbibing at Antone's.

Honestly, it tasted like something from Luby's...or from a frozen dinner.  The veal sauce with mushrooms was quite tasty.  But overall, this was just not a fine dining experience.  And I believe it was priced at $22.50.  My boyfriend ordered the stuffed trout, which was approximately the same price.  He said it was a nice piece of fish, and he enjoyed it.  However, the crab stuffing had very little crab in it, and they left the skin on both top and bottom of the fish.  The butter sauce with capers overwhelmed everything on the plate, and was more than puddling by meal's end.  The fish was served with mixed vegetables (swimming in said sauce) and fried cubed potatoes (!) which tasted as if they had been seasoned in some mixture, like a type of fry in a fast food restaurant, and prepared ahead of time.  \\nI've always enjoyed their olive oil with parmesan for dipping bread, but the bread this time was an undercooked loaf of some onion-flecked dough.

The interior of the restaurant, and especially the aesthetic of the menu, feel quite standardized, in the corporate kind of way that mediocre chain-restaurants are known for (think Applebee's kitch with a thick gloss of pretension on top).  To start, the host seated my friend and I in the back portion of the restaurant, next to two other women whose children were running loose around the restaurant.  On one side were screaming children, and on the other was a steady stream of gym-goers headed down the staircase to Bally's, giving us long looks as they passed.  Not the nicest atmosphere for a leisurely Saturday brunch, but nothing to ruin the morning, to be sure.\\n\\nThere breakfast menu is a bit limited (no goat cheese, for example), but it does have the standard American fare.  I ordered the three eggs breakfast which comes with, of course, 3 eggs, bacon or sausage, toast, and potatoes.  I opted out of the meat, asked for my eggs over medium, and chose an English muffin for my toast.  The eggs were fine, but only the middle was was done over medium: one of the eggs was cooked over easy, the third yolk was hard.  I'm not quite sure how the cook accomplished this.  The English muffin was barely toasted, and for any of you who have tried to eat an under toasted English muffin, you know what an egregious cooking error this is.  Instead of a crisp, crunchy bite, you're left with a soft, mealy texture.  Yuck.\\n\\nThe other problem was that when my food arrived, the plate was missing potatoes.  Not a huge problem--I'd just ask the waitress to fix it.  instead of being apologetic or helpful in getting the side of potatoes, it seemed as if I was putting her out by asking her to serve what my meal was supposed to come with.  At the end of the meal, our waitress didn't return to clear our plates and we had to flag her down to get the check.  \\n\\nThe atmosphere was lacking, the service was grudging at best, and the food was much worse than what I could have cooked up in my own kitchen given a few minute's time.

While we waited, we took our seats out in the cool back area that instantly transported us to Not-Boston.

They are just as amazing as the food, and make the dining experience so much more than just that.  \\nWhat Matt Barros and Joanne Chang do in the kitchen is nothing short of absolute magic! By now, I think i've tried almost everything on the menu. So I can safely write, everything is exceptional.  Some of the staple dishes I order when I go there or take out are: tea smoked spare ribs, sweet potato fritters (when they're on the menu. Joanne, Matt, you both know those are our favorite please bring them back soon), any noodles especially the dan dan, udon or chow fun (very difficult to choose), the lemon chicken, any dumpling (I'm partial to the shrimp) all to be complimented w/ a side of the red miso carrots.  Now to do something a tad bit different, maybe slightly adventurous, depending on your palate try: the tiger's tears, baby octopus, or the alaskan king crab legs. If you have room for dessert, unlikely but they're worth the stretch, try the orange ice parfait or the secret chocolate dish. i know I've recommend a lot but after you've been going there for years like I have, it's very difficult to choose.

I was carb loading for the Disney Wine and Dine Half Marathon happening the next day, and I wanted their whole wheat pasta I had had the previous year for a similar race, and remember liking. \\n\\nOf all the Italian type restaurants I've been to, only Macaroni Grill and Olive garden seem to carry wheat pasta, and it's a shame, because it's very rare to find at non-chain places..\\n\\nWe were a party of 6 and decided to sit on a table that fit us in the bar area, because we didn't want to wait 20 minutes for a dining area table.\\n\\nFirst off, the service was pretty good for the bar area, even though we were waited on by a server in training. For some reason though, the bartender was also helping him and ended up ringing us up at the end.\\n\\nSomething that threw me off was that the menu format had changed from the year before. Last year they had a lighter side menu, that advertised their wheat pasta, and I remember really liking what I ordered there. This time had no such part, plus there was no mention of the wheat pasta.\\n\\nI decided on the Pollo Caprese, with the Bib and Blu salad as a side (Btw, this salad comes with bacon and onion strings, which isn't mentioned on the menu, but would be useful for someone avoiding bacon or a vegetarian). I tentatively asked for the wheat pasta and was relieved they still carried it. \\n\\nAll our meals came out fairly quick. I would say my meal was good, except I felt they skimped on the tomato sauce. The grilled chicken breast tasted ok, but looked oddly not like a chicken breast (maybe because it was flattened...I'm not really sure). The arugula salad was just there and not that exciting.\\n\\nFor dessert, I had an Amaretto Apple Crumble Pie with its scoop of vanilla gelato. It was a big size I wanted to share with the table, but everyone was too full. I somehow ended up eating the whole thing.

It is so new it doesn't even have a website yet. But I say, go go go!\\n\\nFor those of us who have driven by the place and wondered \\"What's going on in there?\\" the transformation is fabulous. It's a restaurant, and a cool looking one. Owner is from Europe, and wanted to open a small place that has good (Albanian) food at good prices, where people can enjoy themselves any time of day (he plans to be open for breakfast as well). Really really nice upgrade, chandeliers and tablecloths. The walls are a trip, in a red-castle kind of way that is much much less kitschy than that sounds...\\n\\nWe stopped in for lunch last week. We weren't even sure if they were open, but my guy wanted to see what was going on, and the door was open...we were warmly greeted, even though I kept asking \\"Are you sure you're open?\\" (The no-doubt Albanian guys at the bar were clearly friends of the proprietor and were having coffees, so it was not a clear indication that the place was, in actuality, open.)\\n\\nWe were the only two, but no matter, the entire menu--except the pasta dishes--were available to us. Guy ordered short rib something or other (the vegetarian in me has learned to stop paying attention to that kind of thing) and I ordered a house salad and a spinach pie. \\n\\nOwner came out, shook hands with us, thanked us for coming, told us all about the sign that was coming and the guy from Holland who was going to do the website and the food photographer from Quincy and the chef who trained at Cordon Bleu in Paris (although one has to wonder if the chef thinks going from Paris to Roslindale is trading down). He was friendly and excited, and apologized to Guy because the chef doesn't come in until 3 and the owner didn't \\"know where he put the squashes.\\"\\n\\nGuy liked his food. My salad was an eye opener--no lettuce! But it was really good without the lettuce, just tomatoes and peppers and onions, with fresh dill and fruity olive oil. My spinach pie almost made me cry, it was so good. Not the Greek version, this was lighter, with different flavorings. It was a perfect lunch for me.\\n\\nThe espresso was great as well.\\n\\nArbri is still in its soft opening, but you should go so that you can meet the guys behind the place and get as warm and enthusiastic welcome as we did.\\n\\nNote on the food: Don't let the moniker \\"Albanian food\\" scare you off.  It's all food you will recognize, a little bit of a cross between Italian and Greek cuisines. I think.\\n\\nNote on the booze: right now they don't have their liquor license, but they do allow you to bring your own bottle; they charge a corking fee, but I don't know what it is."},{"name":"Terra Terroir","address":"3974 Peachtree Rd NE, Ste C","city":"Brookhaven","stars":"4","text":"One of my favorite places for lunch.

Fifty minutes later, we decided to eat at the bar. Nobody from front desk communicated that it may be a longer wait, which would have been courteous. \\n\\nDrinks: nicely poured, bartenders were busy but a little aloof, especially to take our order once we decided to eat.\\n\\nAppetizers: corn chowder was smoky, creamy, thick, with sweet crab meat. We ordered a bowl and got a cup instead. Ahi tuna tacos were fresh, with slightly spicy mayo and a crispy taco shell, generous on the tuna. Menu said they come with avocado, maybe just not for us?\\n\\nCaesar salad: pretty much your basic romaine lettuce and shaved parm. No croutons. We opted out of anchovies. Salad was mostly fresh, a few yellowed bits of lettuce, tasty dressing that wasn't too heavy, lots of cheese.\\n\\nMains: we ordered the 12oz filet medium-well and 16oz ribeye well done. The filet was slightly overcooked and was just... adequate. The ribeye was undercooked. To be fair, they did ask me to cut it to make sure it was to my liking and checked on me again. I was so hungry, I didn't want to send it back. It's not a bone-in ribeye. It was salted/peppered to within an inch of its life and was chewy. I didn't finish it. The ribeye is moderately priced ($40) but not worth even that.\\n\\nDessert: lemon cake. Do not order this if you're eating solo unless you're a lineman or planning on leftovers. It is a massive chunk of cake that could easily be split among three or four people. The lemon sweetness/tang was pleasant, and the buttercream frosting was not too cloying, but was dry.\\n\\nOverall: Totally meh. With drinks (2 beers, 1 mixed), tab was $142 and there was nothing particularly memorable or rave-worthy. Add to that the very mediocre service, and we won't be back.

Local ingredients are key here - if something's out of season, don't count on them bringing something in from out of the country (by example, right now is the best season in ten for Chanterelle mushrooms; they'll do Chanterelle's in your omelette - and on a lot of their other dishes - for not a lot of extra scratch.)  Get yours with a salad (they do a pull-no-punches Champagne vinegar/Dijon mustard dressing); as in the photo, there's a baguette involved.   Portland Roasting's coffee and orange juice fresh from their own kitchen will complete things nicely.\\n\\nWarning:  It's not Denney's-cheap; you're paying for some of the best kitchen and front-of-the-house talent in town; go there twice, and they'll remember your name.

We split the whole-grilled Carolina trout, which was cooked with a mild lemon vinaigrette and wild greens.  This fish was the best I've had in a long, long time, and certainly in Atlanta.

It was a lentil soup flavoured with cumin, green onions. If you've ever had West Indian style lentil dahl, you'll have a pretty good idea of what this dish is like. (That was a long winded way of saying it was FAN-FREAKING-TASTIC)\\n\\nFor our mains we shared the meat platter. We figured it would good way to try a lot of items on the menu in one go. The platter comes with a stewed lamb, beef with potatoes, stewed chicken, and a minced beef dish. While each dish was comprised of similar flavours (onion, garlic, chillies, cumin, cinnamon ...) they were each very very unique. The lamb stew was the second best lamb dish I've had in the lower mainland. Next time I'm here I'm getting the full sized order of this. With most of the dishes, they struck me as being almost Indian-esque in the flavouring, but yet it's completely different. If you enjoy Indian food, I'm dead sure you're going to like Ethiopian food. \\n\\nWe also figured that eating only meat wouldn't make for a great dinner so we got an order of the satueed spinach. This was also a huge winner. It was made, like the other dishes, with the same set of spices, but again a totally unique taste. \\n\\nI've set myself a goal of making through every item on this menu and I think you should to. \\n\\nP.S Enjeera rocks!"},{"name":"Donut City","address":"1880 Mountain Industrial Blvd, A1","city":"Tucker","stars":"4.5","text":"These donuts are the best I've tried so far.

Tonight was spent at Desta, a small Ethiopian restaurant in Atlanta, above Midtown.  The outside has two small patio tables, which aren't really large enough to hold more than a couple of beer bottles, which is pretty much what they're used for.  Inside, there are a few two-person tables and one larger round table on the right side, and the left side with more two-person tables.  All in all, a bit crowded and noisy, yet still intimate.  Decorative items from Ethiopia and elsewhere adorn the walls, along with their awards and recognitions...And for good reason.  You absolutely cannot beat the bang for your buck at Desta.  The food is delicious, satisfying, kind of sexy, and damn cheap.  \\nI started off with the shiro fit fit (crushed chickpea, tomato, bell pepper, in a tomato and oil based sauce with pieces of injera, the Ethiopian flat, soft, bubbly, bread...uber addicting) and the sambusa (like Indian samosa but filled with lentil, jalapeno, and onion).  The shiro is served cold and you have a decent sized helping despite being a $6 appetizer.  Full of fresh flavor from the raw tomato and pepper, the injera still has that bubbly mouthfeel, but has soaked up a fair amount of the sauce, each chew bursts with tomato-y goodness.  The samusas are 2 for $2.50, and are served crispy with a tomato chili sauce.  It's a tad drier compared to a samosa, because the stuffing is lentil instead of potato, but it's a nice nutty quality and interesting combination of soft and crispy textures.  Going along with this was a bottle of Ethiopian beer, St. Georges...pretty standard fare lager, good to try, but I'd try the other 2-3 choices they have from Ethiopia next time.  Moving onto the main course, I went with the chicken tibs...Food was prompt in service, despite the large gaggle of twenty-something year old girls celebrating a birthday.  The plate of chicken tibs was a very narrow but long shallow dish, with small chunks of chicken, slivers of red onion, tomatoes, all cooked up with spices, tomato, onion, and spicy Ethiopian butter, which has just the most appetizing rich aroma, warmed by the piping hot chicken.  Next to it is some house salad, which surprisingly has a nice dressing on it, not loaded on, not something creamy and fatty, just simple, coating the lettuce a little, and pairs well with the richness of the chicken dish...Also came with the chicken, more injera.  Except this time there were 4 rolls of injera, all innocent looking...how wrong I was.  Ethiopian food is similarly eaten as Indian food with the best utensils in the world...your hands.  Food always seems to taste better when it comes off your fingers, or someone elses...hence my remark about this food being sexy...Taking a special someone here, especially if it's their first time, and giving feeding each other?  You tell me that's not stirring up some bow-chicka-wow-wow.  Chicken tibs are just bursting with flavor with each juicy morsel.  Not one piece is dry or tough, but tender and rich and creamy from the butter and tomato.   One dish of chicken tibs and 2 injeras later, I was feeling the button imprint forming on my stomach, satisfied and loving the flavor.  At this point, I've only spent 21 bucks, not including tip...Now we got a problem...I have to make it to 50...So, after packing up 2 extra chicken tibs, 1 vegetarian fit fit, a crapload of injera, and something else that I lost track of after the itis began to set in, I walked out with a full stomach, a big smile on my face, and enough food for a week.  For the price and the amount AND quality of food you get, you can't go wrong.  Now if you'll excuse me, I need to take a nap..."},{"name":"Myers & Chang","address":"1145 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I have so many things to say about Myers + Chang. So many. I have defenses against it's evil critics, helpful advice for those wondering whether to visit, and general self-indulgent blithering because I'm so f-ing thrilled with this place. \\n\\nThe hubs and I go almost weekly, sometimes bi-weekly. It's a little outside our radius in the winter time, but the mussels are so good that I dress up like an Eskimo and make my way down Berkeley knowing that if I can just get there, everything will be right. \\n\\nFor anyone who hasn't been paying attention (or doesnt have deductive reasoning skills) Myers is the venerable Christopher Myers of Boston culinary gems Radius & Via Matta (though no more) and Chang is the lovely Joanne of Flour Bakery. (The very thought of that kind of love and deliciousness being applied to Chinese food makes me giddy.) The two opened this dynamo Chinese diner as a way of showing people what authentic Chinese cuisine was really like. Joanne is, after all, really Chinese. There is no MSG, the ingredients are top-notch, the variety amazing, and quality unbelievable. \\n\\nThe plates vary from the smaller to the more filling and you can work with your server to order just the right amount. (Or, if you're on my team you can way over order, get sickeningly full, and then roll home with your leftovers.) The price point is super reasonable. I will say that I've been shocked to hear Yelpers bitch about the price. I suppose if you'd like the dregs of a sad chicken coated in gluten, deep fried by illegal workers, and covered in MSG for $7 you could cross over 90... From what I understand the avg price per person is less than $30. They even have a date night menu during the week that'll feed you and a special someone for $40! \\n\\nIn addition to the food (a few of my favorites include: the mussels, five-spice tofu buns, the slammin' salmon), there is a dessert menu that gives you what every Asian restaurant in the history of the world has been lacking: post-dinner deliciousness. The Flour love is alive and well in the coconut cream pie, bittersweet chocolate cake with espresso. Even better is that the desserts each have their own eastern-flair. So fun. \\n\\nThe servers are a hoot. Everyone's having a great time and the vibe is great. Creative cocktails, good wine list, and you get a little cooler every time you go in-- even if you don't have the requisite forearm tattoo. \\n\\nI encourage everyone to give M+C a go, but do yourself a favor and open yourself up to experiencing Chinese the way it was meant to be."},{"name":"La Quercia","address":"3689 W 4th Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"If you're lucky enough to get a seat, try the 10 course mean for $70.

For the choices of Indian food in Austin this is not half bad, we do seem to take most of our out of town guests to this place if they want to eat Indian food. However it is what we would call Americanized Indian food. I don't mind the mild spices as long as the food is fresh and tasteful, which it is and that is the only reason this place probably sees repeat business. I had taken my parents to this place for their anniversary while they were visiting Austin. I had an anniversary cake which the restaurant refused to serve without a charge; they wanted a service fee which I think is a bit ridiculous. So we decided not to even bother with all that. Service is the same like in most Indian restaurants, so--so...I have had some good waiters when I was there on not such a busy night, but overall nothing that really stands out. Price wise it will run you up a good amount of money to have a decent meal at this place; I usually order off the menu for dinner and have not tried the buffet.

The reason we ordered two buffalo chicken pizzas was because these babies used to be delicious, hand made small pizzas that were generally good for one or two people. Now the pizza they serve is completely different: it's a typical bar style pizza that has 100% been frozen and re-cooked. Blech! There was hardly any sauce and the cheese tasted like it had freezer burn. The boneless buffalo chicken wings were disgusting. The wings they once had were great and slathered with sauce. These new boneless wings? Again, totally frozen, pre-cooked BS with no buffalo sauce on them at all. The celery sticks on the side were even worse. They were BENDING back and forth like rubber. Not crispy or fresh. My friend wasn't happy with the Caesar salad, but said the fries were OK so at least they got that goin' for 'em.\\n\\nThey had a really weak selection of beer on tap, two of which were kicked, which happens, but was definitely a bummer.

We've been to a Baby Acapulco before, though different location, and thought it was pretty good. I wish I could say the same about this one. For starters, its noisy as all get out with vaulted ceilings and nothing to dampen sound throughout the restaurant. Secondly, the food was not prepared very well and certainly lacked flavor. Lastly, and most importantly, it was dirty. The massive pile of dead crickets in the waiting area should've tipped us off. I understand that in Texas, sometimes we'll have more bugs in certain seasons than in others, but this was gross. The ENTIRE evening, we were fighting to keep bugs out of our food. I had a moth land in my iced tea and dozens of crickets were constantly jumping on to our table and the tables of neighboring customers. Bugs typically don't bother me, but this was while I was trying to eat and wondering what kind of condition the kitchen was in if the dining room was this bad. It doesn't take much effort when you're in the restaurant industry to keep a clean facility and stay relatively bug-free. This place was infested with crickets and they were clearly just ignoring the problem. When we asked the waiter to get me a new tea with no bugs, he brushed it off like I was over reacting to the situation. Definitely will not be going here ever again and may call the health department after what we saw."},{"name":"Myers & Chang","address":"1145 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Barely a 4, but I'll round up.\\n\\nFirst, the wait.

We did, however, call the restaurant ahead of time and were told that at most it would be a 45 minute wait.  when we got there, the hostess told us it could be two hours.  that's not okay.  I know it can be unpredictable, but they should have a more realistic idea of average wait time.\\n\\nwe waited and waited.  it was over an hour.  luckily some people ahead of us gave up.  the bar was really small and crowded and there wasn't even a good place to stand.\\n\\nwhen we were finally seated, everything on the menu looked good.  we got the papaya salad and a herb and beef salad, both of which were very spicy (a good thing, for me)!  luckily they came out first and the following dishes calmed our tongues.  we then had the pork belly buns, some dumplings, and something else I'm forgetting.  the small plates are nice and let you try many things, but they add up quickly!  everything was delicious, though.\\n\\nthe restaurant is very crowded and noisy.  we were seated at a table by ourselves, but some people seemed to be grouped together.  we sat back by the cooking area which was entertaining.  people kept rushing past us with large trays of glasses for the bar that they literally had to lift up over our heads to get by.  I can deal with this is a crowded, bustling restaurant, but I could see many people getting seriously annoyed.  don't plan on being able to have intimate conversations, and I wouldn't recommend large groups at all.\\n\\nIn an nutshell: don't come here unless you're in the mood for loud and crowded, and if you are, make sure you have a reservation.  order a lot, you'll like it all, but be warned that they really do mean spicy.  also, be prepared to feel a bit underdressed unless you're sparkling and towering in heels, but there's really no need for that."},{"name":"Tassili's Raw Reality","address":"1059 Ralph D Abernathy Blvd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Okay, first impression walking up?

The servers who work there are nice, but just like Wildside, the Hangar is always understaffed.

Just yesterday we sat outside on the patio, and a server inside gave us a head nod, as if to say \\"I see you and someone will be right out.\\"  10 minutes later not one staff member had come out to the patio.

It was still good and the shrimp were plentiful and large.\\n\\nDesert did take forever but was well worth the wait. We ordered the fried won tons.  I also wouldn't give too much extra credit for the service.  Our waitress was average, but certainly not on the same level as other Disney servers we encountered this week. \\n\\nOverall, it was a good meal and if you have the time and ability, I recommend giving them a try.  Manage your expectations, you are not getting super authentic Asian food, but good food in a replication of a non-specific Asian style."},{"name":"Clay Pit","address":"1601 Guadalupe St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I don't come here when I want Indian Food. If I really want Indian Food, I'll go to Swad. Or maybe, if I feel really extravagant I'll hop on the airplane and visit my Mom in Boston. No, I come to the Clay Pit when I want a nite out, a tasty meal  and some creative bevs all with Indian-ness lightly waved over it.\\n\\nYes, this is not an On-Fire Indian Experience. For that, you need a stripmall, not the classy old-timey Austin Bertrams Building, which to my eye always seemed like an old Train Station.\\n\\nTo be sure, the meals are creative and maybe a little westernized. But make no mistake, the indian flavors ARE there and many of the dishes ARE traditional. Just not the kind the real people of India would eat on the streets or in their homes. For instance, the Khurus-E-Tursh:  a chicken breast stuffed with spinach, mushrooms and a sort of cartuja sauce. As you enjoy this tasty dish, you get the feeling of perhaps sitting in a 5 start cricket club somewhere in Punjab, looking over the rolling foothills in the distance with your 10 closest ex-pat friends in tow.\\n\\nThe curries are heavy. This is often the case with Northern Indian cooking, though you'll feel more cream than oil in your belly. The example I gave above fits the bill as do the Khorma, Coconut and Tikka Masala curries, the latter being too salty for my taste but the first two being very tasty, especially with the huge fragrant Cardimom pod I got. Maybe I just fell for the oldest trick in the Indian Cook Book, but I like it!\\n\\nSo, get about 1/2 as many entrees as you normally think you'd need and split it with appetizer, naan and maybe a small dessert and you're through.\\n\\nThe main downside to this restaurant is that the menu is pretty much fixed. I think, given the style of the restaurant, it would do much better to have some rotation as a vehicle to deepen the creative aspect. Short of that, we just don't go very often. But when we do, we appreciate young, hip service, we get to reconnect a bit with the Mother Ship without feeling just thrown off the boat, and quite often we walk away with pleased bellies (if we avoid pairing the recommended mixed drinks with the spicy food).\\n\\nThis place sits in it's own niche (like Mars Used to) and should be tried.

It was a weekday so I had not expected full cart service but he promised me it was a traditional restaurant and he was right!  Lined with round tables with the familiar decor found in so many restaurants in New York City's Chinatown, I felt right at home when we went into the restaurant.  I was extra happy when I found the staff speaks my dialect (Cantonese)!\\n\\nWe were seated very quickly and the familiar card for the cart handlers to mark off was put on our table.  However we were also provided with a paper to check off dishes to order fresh.  The result was a combination of carts bringing you dishes you had ordered and the wait staff bringing other dishes.  Of course, should anything on the carts tickle your fancy, you could order right off the carts.\\n\\nI wound up eating *way* too much because I wanted to sample several dishes.  First off, it is important to note that the size of the dumplings in this place are *massive*.  I could not believe how huge the shiu mai and other dumplings were.  One of my favorite dumplings had scallop and roe on top.  If you see it, get it!  Also huge kudos for their baked goods.  The egg tarts were absolutely delicious and flaky.  Meanwhile the roast pork buns were very tasty.  This is one of those places that is so good, even as you're stuffed you wish you could order more.\\n\\nThe restaurant and facilities were clean and the tables were not mashed together too closely.  We had a large party sitting at several tables around us and we never bumped into anyone or got in anyone's way.  \\n\\nThe staff was very nice and were even willing to help take a photo of my friend and I.  I would recommend Golden Swan to anyone looking to have some great Dim Sum in Vancouver."},{"name":"Whiskey's Food & Spirits","address":"885 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"2.5","text":"I know, I know.

We went in with reservations of course, and were taken in the back room booth. The atmosphere is definitely nice and quiet to connect and catch up with friends or family, and dim lights to cozy up with your lover. Would I recommend going there daily? Not necessarily. Would I recommend going there for a special occasion or event? Most definitely. \\nI also forgot how they make you \\"work\\" an appetite for your food..I completely forgot that you are the one stirring and pouring your food in the pot. It's definitely an interactive experience but therapeutic nonetheless as you watch the food cook and the smoke and heat come off as you catch up in lengthy conversations while time passes and you don't feel it..as opposed to waiting for someone to just bring your food. They are definitely organized and well prepared for you to have a great experience with  the right utensils, cook settings, and timers, and the waitress was a great guide. I was really happy to see that they have a veggie course option. So it's vegetarian friendly for the veggie lovers. Oh, and before I forget, definitely go for the 4 course experience!

You get to try more in a cost effective way. \\n\\nOk, now Let's talk about the salad dressing...their house sweet and tangy salad dressing there is the BOMB!

You could customise everything from the thickness of the noodles to the oiliness of the broth. The spring onions helped to balance the heavy broth and the eggs were well made but could be more flavourful in my opinion. The noodles and the pork slices stole the show. Both were tender and tasty. You could top up noodles halfway into your meal but the menu says you have to save enough soup for the extra noodles. Haha. I like the small touches such as having seats which doubled up as storage.

I eat here every time I come to Austin. \\n\\nNow, I have to admit that I have only had the fish tacos, but they are so good that I can't bring myself to order anything else. Also, they pile on the guacamole for a mere $.35, which rocks because a lot of places like to give you a tiny, tiny little thimble-sized portion and charge outrageous prices for it. I understand that avocados can be pricey, but, seriously, come ON. Anyway, continuing with the low price theme, I can eat here and get full on two tacos and beans for about six bucks. That's the way to this girl's heart, for sure.\\n\\nAdditionally, the frozen sangria is ridiculously potent (though it is possible that I am just a lightweight) and once I got drunk off two of them (granted, they were the bigger ones), which rules, especially when you are a poor college student like me. They also have cheap beer, which once again appeals to my frugal (ha) nature. \\n\\nLastly, once I came here and while waiting in line got to play with the world's most adorable Dachshund-mix puppy.

I mean the chili cheese sauce tastes like a good nacho sauce - just not what I was expecting.  They should just call it Nacho Cheese sauce.

Well, now that you ask :)  I tasted my friend's veggie burger and it was good.  It was moist and had a really good taste.

I let my mother pick a lunch spot out of basically anywhere in the greater Orlando/Kissimmee area, and being that it is at Animal Kingdom, and we had already been to Rainforest Cafe there, she picked Yak N Yeti. I was really not amused, nor interested. I was in fear. I felt it would be, at best Rainforest Cafe like, which is decent, yet expensive, and really just all about the where, not the what.\\n\\nI was wrong. Again. It is a beautifully decorated restaurant, with Thai, Indian, Himilayan, British all kinds of artwork, all mish moshed together. We were able to be seated right away (I think that has a lot to do with my positive reflections....I have read quite a bit about hour plus waits for tables, and really, No food is worth that) We shared the (can't remember its \\"authentic\\" whimsical name) appetizer sampler, which was steamed buns, potstickers and 2 kinds of shu-mai, all were very good. Our entrees were the Ribs for her, which were EXCELLENT, seriously suprisingly good, and came with a cabbage salad that was good also, and some fried rice I did not try, because just as I am the 1 in 100 who barely likes cheese, I am not a fan of fried rice. \\nI had the steak and shrimp, which was a piece of thin charred steak (I LOVE nearly burned meat) and a couple tempura shrimp, with a large portion of stir fried vegetables, and steamed rice. It was all very good, everything was totally fresh, and well presented and well prepared. The portions are HUGE also, even sharing, and being pigs, we left a lot of food on our plates. Especially if you get an appetizer, sharing is a really good idea. We could have shared an entree and still had some leftover. \\nService was really nice, and prompt, as is the Disney way.\\nKinda Expensive (I think it was close to $70 for lunch for 2) , even with Premium AP discount, so its more of a place I would go with visitors, rather than for a random lunch out, but still will definitely be back."},{"name":"Monica's Trattoria","address":"67 Prince St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Monica's is known as one of the best restaurants in the North End, but because of the recent renovation I didn't get a chance to try it until last month. I was pleased with everything. We started with the buffalo mozzarella and prosciutto. Both were very fresh, and I am very particular about the freshness of both of those things. I got the squid ink pasta with white wine cream sauce and scallops as a main, and it was perfect. The portions were on the smaller side, like they would be at an actual Italian trattoria (Americans are to blame for the large portions at Italian-American restaurants), but we didn't want leftovers or to overeat, so that was fine. We also ordered bread, which filled in the gaps for the \\"smaller\\" portions. It was a bit pricey, but it's the North End so that is to be expected. It was still cheaper than Neptune, which I love, but can only afford to go to once a year. You could technically get a meal at Monica's for around $20 if you didn't order apps, though I think ours was closer to $50 each because we split a bottle of wine and an app three ways. Still worth it, in my opinion. You could spend just as much at any of the tourist traps nearby with half the value.\\n\\nI should note that we went at 9 pm at night, so there was no wait and the service was excellent, because not a ton of people were there that late. Now, that is not indicative of the average dining time for most people in the U.S. BUT anybody who lives in Boston knows that at any restaurant in the North End, it will be noisy and crowded at regular dinner time, and you will probably have to wait even with a reservation. I've waited for hours at other restaurants, that are so small there's no way they can guarantee a table at the reserved time. This place is a little bigger so can't be quite as bad (30 mins on top of a reservation in the North End is something you should simply allot time for). \\n\\nSo I recommend weekday evenings and very early or very late dinner times on the weekends if you want to go to the North End at all. This applies to all restaurants in the area. I always have a backup plan for cocktails and apps if there's a really long wait, too. It's worth it."},{"name":"Myers & Chang","address":"1145 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"The flavors in the food were too strong.

From the food to the service, everything was perfect. Definitely come here in a group of four or more people. That way, you can try more of the tapas. The serving sizes are meant to be small so that you can order more items to share. At least, that is what one of my friends who had been to Spain told me. Basically, they never order thing for themselves in Spain- they share food family style.  I had gone to Neptune Oyster the previous day, and realized that you don't need to wait 3 hours to enjoy a great meal. Or, maybe we were lucky?! We came here on a Tuesday night after work and it was busy but not too crazy.\\n\\nWe ordered the potato tortilla, which is more like a potato quiche, the serrano ham, pork belly, seafood paella, and the pork loin paella. What we didn't expect was that they graciously gave us some bikinis (it's a dish with a bunch of truffle butter sandwiches and not the swimsuit). corn, potatoes, and fried squash while we waited for our paellas to come. Since this is a wine bar, definitely order some of their wine. We got a red wine, but I forget the name. The waiter gave us a recommendation, and it turned out to be really good. I always wondered why they let you have a taste of the wine before they pour it out to all the guests. The waiter explained to us that you can actually ask them to switch out the wine if you don't like it or if you find out that there are pieces of cork in the wine. Only the snobby restaurants won't allow you to switch the wines, and I appreciate the service. \\n\\nOverall, a really solid experience and I would recommend coming here again. Looking at the other reviews, I would probably try to make a reservation on busier days such as the weekend or Friday.

He began with, \\"water is a given, what else may I bring you to drink\\" as her poured our glasses. The runners, bartenders, cooks and door staff were also clearly well-trained and generally seemed like good people.\\n\\nWe started with milkshakes - I got the Captian Crunch w/PB foam, which I thought was the best of the bunch. Pure heaven that I didn't really want to share. But, I did for a taste of the Nutella Roasted Marshmallow (good, but a bit too chocolatey for me since I don't like chocolate ice cream) and the Peach Melba (also good but not as memorable as the Cap'n).\\n\\nBurgers - The portion size is perfect. It is clear that whoever designed the menu knows you're going to try a milkshake and at least a couple of sides, so they leave you room to do that. (Thanks!) My FAVORITE was the burger with blue cheese, caramelized onion and red wine jam. The flavors melded together for a salty, savory, juicy and PERFECT burger. We also had the local, which had really nice heirloom tomatoes and was perfectly cooked, and the turkey burger with avocado, sprouts and some other goodness. We licked every plate clean. I think I was most impressed by the coca-cola ketchup - its SO much better than you would guess.\\n\\nSides - not as memorable as the burgers but good, and a different twist to the typical french fry. We had fried zucchini that came with a gremolata mayo dip, topped with parm and chives (yum), chipotle sweet potato tots (again good but could have used a touch more flavor) and my favorite side, the cherry tomatoes with walnuts, celery and blue cheese - this one was light, tangy, and just the right contrast to the burgers. \\n\\nFlip - I will be back the next time I'm in the ATL.

If you are looking for better BBQ in Austin proper I hear you have to go to Franklins and there's no way in hell Im  waiting in the line to get it, so just go here instead. A tip for people coming to Terry Black's: my GF and I arrived at black's at about 7:30, and they had a sign on the door saying they were out of brisket. Upon seeing this sign my heart nearly broke. I still went into the establishment to eat all the other good stuff they have there. It Turns out they still had some brisket behind the counter. If u see that sign, just ask someone who works there about what's left  & be cognizant of the amount of brisket behind the counter. Now I must lay down and enter a brisket induced food coma."},{"name":"N&P Saigon Subs","address":"1185 N Main St","city":"Randolph","stars":"4.5","text":"Simply put we adore this place.

Some fancy gourmet style shit here. You can definitely taste the difference from their use of high quality ingredients. Apparently they also use some classic French brioche recipe for the dough.\\n\\nThe old fashioned's are delicious, moist and cakey. However, the exterior lacks the slight crunch that I prefer from such places as Top Pot in Seattle. Still, the flavor almost makes up for that shortcoming.\\n\\nThe glazed and the cinnamon sugar raised are just fabulous. They aren't oily in the least and the toppings don't overpower the flavor of the donut. The meat of the donut is unusually light and airy, even for a raised, and they taste like fresh, sweet milk. For some reason they reminded me of Winchell's raised donuts I had when I was a wee tyke about 30 years ago.\\n\\nThe chocolate crunch topping of the chocolate crunch donut didn't really do too much for me, but the filling was like a cloud made of cream misting a gentle rain of sweetness on your tongue.\\n\\nThe hazelnut dulce de leche is also a notable choice. I was delighted to find that the dulce de leche topping was not cloyingly sweet. It had the consistency of peanut butter with a very subtle caramel flavor. A fine choice that actually didn't taste quite sweet enough.\\n\\nThe blueberry basil I didn't care for too much as I'm not a huge fan of fruit. The basil flavor was interesting and not especially offensive, but isn't something I'd purposely seek out again.\\n\\nAnyways, point is, this place is good, if a bit pricey for friggin donuts."},{"name":"Gus's World Famous Fried Chicken","address":"117 San Jacinto Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Great food for a great price.

Even if it looked a tad spendy at first, the serving was generous - I'm not kidding when I say \\"platter\\" - and there was a generous amount of meat and seafood toppings. On the flip side, it came doused in oil, so much so that there was a pool of it by the time I was done with the dish (and I'd had enough of the greasiness that I simply didn't finish, which is extremely rare for a glutton like me).\\n\\nService is extremely friendly here. Folks who appear to be the owners manage to take and fulfill orders reasonably efficiently while simultaneously maintaining conversation with frequent guests.

The increase in price point is also concerning (we used to average $50-$60 per person for the whole menu) and now it is $75 per person before drinks.

I'm a GRITS (girl raised in the south- for those who don't know). I use to hate grits coming up due to an unfortunate experience with a cold at 4 years old. Anyway, didn't touch the stuff until about 3 years ago. I LOVE the cheesy grits.

He's not into soul food but he really enjoyed the meal and wants to go back if we're in town again. \\n\\nThe red velvet cake (although poorly presented to me in a box and the icing not crisp white between then layers of cake) was still to die for.

They managed to have one table member's order come out wrong twice and service just wasn't good. The restaurant was, if I'm generous, maybe half full and I just can't figure out why we then watched another table that came in and ordered after ours (we were both 4 tops) have their drinks refilled twice before ours came out. The Bloody Sally/Mary I ordered took the entire meal to arrive (in fairness I ordered when the food was delivered) but at no point was there any acknowledgement by staff that our drinks had taken so long (11min wait for a Bloody in a basically empty restaurant). The Bloody was hopefully a fluke and it's normally good but it tasted like straight up shrimp cocktail sauce. I like a spicy or even unique take on a Bloody Mary but this isn't it - whatever their 'made from scratch' recipe is needs a rework."},{"name":"Pattycake Bakery","address":"3009 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"I wanted to really like this place because its cute-- cute name, cute cupcakes & creations, & a very friendly staff, but it just wasn't super. Now, I do want to put in a side note that I just tried one item from the bakery, the pistachio rosewater cake. I went in & asked for recommendations, this was one of the, because it is a special & not always around. I thought why not try it, sure sounds different. The woman behind the counter said it has a flowery taste, but paired with the sweetness of the icing & saltiness of the pistachios, it's good. Well I agree with the flowery taste. If you like the rose flavor, then maybe you'd like this. The icing was not very sweet, it just tastes like more rosewater. Also, I couldn't taste the pistachios! ): maybe their cookies or sweet-focused cupcakes would be better. I'm not a vegan or gluten-free, so those factors aren't important for me, but this place has a lot of good reviews so I thought I'd try it out. \\n+1 staff\\n+1 selection\\n+1 uniqueness\\n-1 lack of sweetness\\n-1 cost (I know organic is more expensive, but $4.50 for a slice of cake?!

My choice was the campfire burger, which came with cheese, typical veggie toppings and BBQ sauce in between two soft and sweet buns. Fries were awesome, too.

The food averaged alright; she enjoyed her bruschetta and caesar salad, I thought their \\"Italian Job\\" pizza was passable but unimpressive.\\n\\nWhat sabotaged our visit was the terrible service. We were seated at a central table in clear view of the host's podium, away from the bar and the other patrons, and then ignored for the most part. The waiters were brusque and unfriendly. When our food was delivered an older man who appeared to be supervising the staff walked towards our table saying something about \\"family values\\", made eye contact with us, then took a sharp left and strode off when I asked him if he was talking to us.\\n\\nMy friend apologized to me, saying that this was the worst service she'd ever gotten. She usually eats there with her mother, and the staff had never before been this unfriendly or failed to bring the wine list to her. The waiters and hosts hovered around without addressing us, only swooping in to take away plates the instant we appeared done with them. We were definitely being rushed out of the restaurant, and at times it was obvious that the staff were talking about us. We wondered if we had been taken for much younger than we were, or if we were somehow underdressed (though some of the other patrons were in jeans), or if there was something else about us that made them think we were going to skip out on the check. It couldn't have been that they needed our table, over half the tables were open.\\n\\nHalfway through our meal we realized what must be going on; we had been taken for a lesbian couple! This was confirmed when we left and the hostess and two of the waiters standing by the door were obviously gossiping about us. From what we overheard it was clear that they were relieved that us \\"lesbians\\" were leaving!\\n\\nI just couldn't believe that the staff would be so rude. To be clear, my friend and I are not even actually lesbians! If we received such scrutiny and terrible service because we were somehow perceived as a couple then I can only imagine how horribly an openly gay couple would be treated!\\n\\nSome of the waiters did give us guilty looks and the hostess's gossip did not sound malicious. I suspect that our treatment was caused by a single bigoted supervisor, possibly the \\"family values\\" man.\\n\\nAside from the rudeness, the decor in the inside dining area is ridiculous. The motif is definitely \\"mock-worthy attempt to be hip and also vaguely Italian\\". Somebody painted one wall orange, the other cream, and then went to town with a regrettably limited stencil collection and a disjointed spraypaint pallet. Picture Mona Lisa heads in taupe and beige repeating across a wall, interspersed with large and occasionally overlaid graphics of a woman gnashing her teeth at a cardboard-stiff piece of pizza. Some swathes of the ceiling were also hung with what looked like folds of an umber tarp. My personal favorite touch was the small electric blue spraypaint hanging out near the host's podium. It seemed to be an armless version of Michelangelo's David with black streaks hovering near its stumps. Upon closer inspection the streaks were revealed to be from another spraypaint stencil, shaped as arms holding a wine glass and I think a beer bottle.\\n\\nI don't think I'll be bringing any dates here, regardless of their gender or sex."},{"name":"Truva Turkish Kitchen","address":"60 Andrew Young International Blvd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Food and service was great!!

The NY Strip Burger was really juicy and very flavorful and the Shrimp Burger was personally my favorite. It was crispy on the outside, it didn't have such an over powering \\"shrimp\\" flavor that I thought it would & it held its shape very well alongside the condiments. We also ordered Jam Jars and Asparagus on the side. I was not happy with the asparagus. It honestly needed more flavor! The Parmesan shredded on top did not do much for me. Also for the price, I felt like I did not get a full serving. Customer service was good when I went there.

We ended up hitting both, this one on my last night in Boston. It was fine, but our first dinner was a home run, this was more like a double (maybe). \\n\\nThe restaurant is cute and cozy, with colorful chairs and intimate tables, and a bit dark. As in, if my parents had dined here, I could picture my dad asking for a flashlight to read the menu. I wasn't jazzed about being seated at the community table, especially when there was at least one open booth, but we were fortunate to get it to ourselves for the majority of our dinner. Even when others were sat, they put them at the far end first. \\n\\nWe ordered a carafe of sangria while we perused the menu. I'm usually a fan of sangria, but wasn't wild about this; it was too sweet and all the fruit was trapped in the bottom by all of the ice they piled in. For dinner I got the Atun, seared yellow fin, arugula and sun-dried tomato vinaigrette with toasted pepitas, and my date ordered the Pabellon Criollo, shredded beef, white rice, plantains, black beans. \\n\\nI liked, but didn't love my dish; if there was supposed to be some latin flair with this dish, I missed it. This yellow fin was great, well cooked and seasoned and the sauce on the side of the plate was good. The salad portion of my meal didn't work. The greens either were not arugula, or were possibly baby arugula. Either way I felt like I was eating a plate full of shamrocks, which is not easy to do in a dainty fashion. Mouthful of shamrocks aside, the dressing was devoid of any flavor other than the oil in the dressing. My date enjoyed his meal, although he played it safe and got something he'd had before. \\n\\nService was pleasant and attentive throughout our meal.

I came here with a colleague for lunch and we showed up at 11:30 and didn't get seated until noon. The ramen is super tasty. I got the Negi-goma Ramen combo. \\nThe combo was an extra $3.50 but you get 3 pieces of gyoza and a choice of side. I chose the soft boil egg. \\n\\nSo the difference between negi-goma ramen vs the other ramen is that negi-goma is made with sesame oil where as the other ones out of lard. Not sure which one is healthier but if I were to guess, I would guess sesame oil. \\n\\nSo how Ramen Danbo works is that you sit down and you get the options to pick how you would like your ramen.\\nfor the noodle you get the options: thin or thick\\nfor the chashu - fatty and non-fatty\\nFor the other ramen other than negi-goma, you have the option of how much lard\\nand lastly, you get to choose the spicy level.\\n\\nThe place is very similar to fast food concept. You sit down, order and it takes about 30 mins for them to prep the noodle and for you to consume it. The noodle comes out super fast. \\n\\nI like this place and definitely will come back.

I don't know how else to describe it. The dim sum brunch is expensive, bland, and mostly boring. Let me get specific, with the list divided into things to get and things to avoid.\\n\\nGet\\nMama chang's pork + chive dumplings are 3 for $6. While that does seem like a lot per dumpling, they're one of the better items on the menu. It'd be great if they were 4 for $6 (hint hint M+C), but alas. They're crisped up really nicely and are full of flavor. Not exceedingly unique yet still delicious.\\n\\nThe wok-charred baby bok choy w/shiitake mushrooms was great. Everything it should've been. Except price and/or quantity. $6 for a small amount. One of those should change.\\n\\nThe hakka eggplant was kind of awesome. It's the only dish that completely exceeded expectations and blew me away. I'd get this and only this if I ever come here again. Though again, price and/or quantity should change.\\n\\nIt's slightly disappointing that two of the best dishes were the veggie ones.\\n\\n\\nAvoid\\nThe crispy salt+pepper calamari and jalapenos is $6 for maybe 6 pieces of calamari that are average. The best thing on this plate are the peppers.\\n\\nThe chawanmushi- silky egg custard with mushroom + bottarga was way too salty and way too small for $5. A few spoonfuls and it's gone. The sodium content completely ruined any other flavors.\\n\\nThe \\"nirvana\\" chicken congee was bland. So bland I almost forgot we ordered it. At least it had enough to make it seem like a steal of a deal compared to other items.\\n\\nThe bbq pulled pork bao and braised pork belly bao are $5 each for only one small bao. Everyone expects great things of pork belly, and that has always been the case everywhere else it's been had, but apparently it can be served sub par. Dry and chewy. The bbq pork was better but still lacking.\\n\\nHopefully M+C is better at dinner."},{"name":"Mr G's Pizza & Subs","address":"474 Lowell St","city":"Peabody","stars":"4","text":"I have loved this place for 37 years!!!!not only is the menu plentiful but the food is always fresh ..Kat and the whole staff are wonderful. .the best syrian bread in town!!!

In all fairness, they recently opened this past weekend so I am sure that they are trying to work out the kinks.  \\n\\nWe decided to visit for lunch and as expected they were pretty busy.  They have a lot going on with the menu. They have wings, burgers, fish, seafood, cheese steaks, club sandwiches etc.  Its almost like your one stop shop for food.  It almost seems as if they are confused as to what they want to be.  I honestly thought they were more of a fast food place that offered various combos etc but after looking at the menu they appear to be a regular restaurant. Meaning most items are ala carte.  Some do come with fries but none include a drink.  \\n\\nWhen you walk in you place your order at the counter.  I asked if there were any lunch specials because the menu didn't show any.  Well the cashier proceeded to rattle off about 8 different things and I was taken aback because she said it so fast I missed it. I ended up ordering the fish on the roll with fries and a drink and my friend ordered the cheese steak with fries and a drink.  We got our drinks and found a nice little table over in the corner which was nice.  The atmosphere is super cute but it almost seems as if they have too many tables and chairs for the space given.  It can be a little hard to maneuver.  \\n\\nIf you are in a rush then give yourself enough time.  We waited 20 minutes for our food to come out which was ok because we weren't in a hurry.  If you dine inside, they bring your food to you.  Our food came out nice and hot which was a plus.  You could tell that my first had just come out of the fryer.  I was so excited to try it out.  Well lets just say I was a little disappointed.  The fish nor the batter had any seasoning or flavor.  The bun was nicely toasted and it came with lettuce, tomato and tartar sauce.  I actually got up and got a packet of malt vinegar to try to help it our but it was useless.  The fish itself looked really fresh but with the right seasoning it would have been a perfect sandwich.\\n\\nMy friend ordered the cheese steak sandwich and honestly I do not know how he ate that sandwich.  It had absolutely zero seasoning. No salt, pepper nothing.  It tasted like they pretty much took the meat out the package, slapped it on the grill and that was it.  He ended up putting may and mustard on it but there was no hope.  \\n\\nOne plus is that the staff is super friendly and they are all working to provide the best experience they can for customers. \\n\\nSince they are new, they apparently have some work to do so I will give them a month and revisit at that time.

Sister T explained in her slow, soft-spoken voice that she had been sampling so much of it within a few hours that she lost her taste buds and didn't realize how spicy it was.

I have only braved this location a handful of times out of sheer cravings and stubborness, but will usually go to the Anderson location and brave the lines there without as much of a parking sitch headache.\\n\\nThat being said, I do love me some Hopdoddy and my craving for an Ahi-Tuna Burger and fries with chipotle ketchup somehow prevails.\\n\\nThe food here in general is just outright delicious! The Ahi burger is my handsdown favorite and the fries here are amazeballs as well with the equally delish chipotle ketchup, you can't go wrong! They seem to have a wider beer selection here than the Anderson location and the goblet'o'beer is always FTW. \\n\\nAs with the Anderson location, the only other thing about Hopdoddy that puzzles me is the weird seating set up...so you stand in line and order at the counter cafeteria style, but while in line a person will come up to you and give you a table number based on the number in your party on a piece of paper that you give to the order taker at said counter with some vague directions as to where you table is located. Sometimes you don't get a table number until the last possible minute, but somehow they always manage to seat your party. Everything is self-serve going through the line, but your food is brought out to you and you inexplicably have a \\"server\\" that will check on your table periodically to bring you refills or whatever you may be in need of. This setup just doesn't make a lot of sense to me as they should either be a cafeteria self-serve setup or a sitdown restaurant setup; so, for me, the odd hybrid setup took some getting used to.

I've been to more Chamorro Village nights than I have Labor Day sales at JC Penny's. I love Guam's local flavors because they are diverse, with influence from the  Philippines, Japanese, Malaysia, and some other small asian country's influence I can't remember the name of right now. You could find half my ship's staff at the local village party every Wednesday night. We didn't go for the cheap tye-dye shirts, or Bob Marley posters, we went for the food. \\n\\nIn Guam, the red rice was sticky, tasty, and colored with a mysterious ingredient. PDX Six Seven One's red rice is dry, flavorless, and sprinkled with a mysterious spice I could identify either. I was so very disappointed when I tasted it. I had been looking forward to getting my Chamorro red rice fix for days! \\n\\nIn Guam, the lumpia is delicious, with vegetables, pork sausage, and noodles. On island they also give you a small container of sweet red sauce just for lumpia. At PDX 671, the lumpia is overcooked, has too much sausage in it, and all they give you for dipping is regular old soy sauce with chives in it. \\n\\nIn Guam, the meat is barbecued over a fire, and makes anyone walking by instantly hungry by the beautiful scent it makes while cooking. At PDX 671, I couldn't smell anything but the cinnamon rolls from the neighbor cart (Which are delicious btw!!). My boyfriend ordered the chicken and it was good, juicy, and the right flavor. I still wish there had been some open fire grilling though. \\n\\nI'm am so disappointed in PDX Six Seven One. I've been stateside for three years now and I miss Guam, and her local cuisine. My hopes and expectations were high for a local Chammoro cart in Portland, & to have them be thrown in the trash with my left over red rice is depressing. For people who have never been to Guam it is a poor representation of the island's food.

I had the Double which is two angus beef FLIP patties, double bacon, double cheese - white american, diced onion, pickles, yellow mustard.  This is a LOT of beef and its not inexpensive.  Honestly, without the double patties, I think the burger size would have been meager.  Most of the selections are not doubles.  Double is probably too much for most people but a single is too small for most adult males.\\n\\nI know a lot of people who crave a greasy burger.  This was not that.  But it was very moist still without a lot of excess fat.  However, the bacon was covered in excess grease.  Put the bacon on a paper towel once before adding it to the burger please!  The bacon was otherwise exceptional however.  \\n\\nI did not read the menu carefully to notice that it included mustard or I would have asked for it not to be included.  There are no traditional condiments on the table.  I had to ask for ketchup when the burger was served.  And after 5 minutes, still no ketchup!  When our server came by she asked if everything was alright and we asked her again for ketchup.  BY this time, I had already started eating my burger without it.  She had no recollection of being asked previously.\\n\\nI asked for my burgers to be cooked medium.  One of the two patties was, at best, medium rare.  \\n\\nWe ordered the lunch deal which comes with a beverage and a salad or fries.  We both ordered the ceasar salad which was very tasty but a bit over dressed and too wet for my taste.  But the smokiness of the anchovies in the dressing made for an exceptional flavor.  By ordering a salad, we assumed that we would be served it before the burger.  However, they serve their salads at the time your burger is served.  Had we known that, we might have tried the fries.  We ordered the salad because we thought it would be quick.  We should have asked.\\n\\nOther than the ketchup incident, the service was fine.

So why only 3 stars. I almost gave it two.The ordering reminds me a little bit of Starbucks, the way they want you to say tall, when you want a small. It didn't completely make sense.  We each ordered a burger and shared fries and 2 shakes. Th salty caramel shake is amazing. A little on the pricey side, actually everything was. I didn;t pay but I believe it was about $30 . In my book $30 for burgers, shakes & fries is on the high end for two people. Here is where everything went downhill. I ordered the goat cheese & mushroom burger. I love goat cheese. The girl at the register even repeated it back to me. So when the server dropped off something and said here's you Poblano burger. I had to practically jump up and say, hey I think you brought this to the wrong table. Nope it just got entered wrong. I get that mistakes happen and that wasn't the thing. They said they would get me a mushroom burger. 5 minutes, 10, 15. By now my partner has slowly eaten his, and I have eaten too many fires and finished my shake. By now I am kind full. Finally my burger comes and i tell server I am a bummed it to so long. And really I figured they would just get me the next burger up and put my toppings on. Heck they could have scraped the toppings off the one they brought me originally. For $30 I want to eat at the same time as my partner. I manager did come over and apologize and give me $10 towards a next visit. I may stop in and gets another caramel shake.

Some have been okay. Because of that, I cannot in good faith give Fuji a 4-though I really want to, because the management here is awesome. I do feel, however, that a 3 rating is relatively low, and a 3.5 more adequately reflects my feelings about this place.\\n\\nThe fried cheesecake dessert, though not exactly low cal, is probably one of my favorite things on the menu and quite possibly in this world.

The coconut pineapple cake was decent.  \\n\\nAgain, I enjoyed that there were lots of options that were NOT the typical amusement fare for the adults.  In fact, all of animal kingdom had options that aren't the norm from the rest of the Disney resorts, and I so appreciated it!!"},{"name":"Bukhara Indian Bistro","address":"3698 Washington St","city":"Jamaica Plain","stars":"3.5","text":"I've been eating here regularly for 7 years and it's very tasty Indian food (especially for the price).

Once we got inside it was another long wait for our pizza and an even longer wait for our steak tips.  It's not a \\"quick bite to eat\\" kind of place... \\n\\nBut the pizza was good.  Way better than any delivery place i've ever ordered from. They put the topping UNDER the sauce and they don't skimp.  The sauce they use is great!  Makes other pizza seem inferior.\\n\\nALSO, they only take cash.  There is a ATM inside, but it looks like one of the ones that charge a gazillion dollars in fees.

I ordered a Jack and Ginger to start off.  The Ginger Ale was flat and lifeless, and the drink was overall not good.  When I asked if the bar served real ginger ale the server told me she didn't think their ginger ale was very good (Oh now you tell me.) For dinner, I had the Cesar salad and Calamari.  The Romain lettuce was not green and the dressing was not flavorful.  The Calamari must have been frozen and not fresh.  It was not lightly fried or well seasoned.  The server did not ask how my food was until I ordered a cup of clam chowder.  The chowder was ordered since the first two items were below par.  The chowder was good but served lukewarm.   Overall, not a good experience.  The server did take the cocktail off the bill."},{"name":"FLIP burger boutique","address":"1587 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Amazing burger joint. Came on a Sunday during lunch time. Opted for the bar seating since it was completely empty, not to mention there wouldn't be any wait. I'm not going to lie, there was an hour wait.

I still had 3 onion rings left that you could clearly tell I was STILL enjoying it. I didn't mind the burger plate being cleared, but I was still eating my appetizer! I felt like I was being rushed.

It was not too busy either.  There was a lot more choices other than pizza to choose from.  \\n\\nWe ordered the whole Prima Pepperoni deep dish pizza ($19.99?).  It consisted of extra pepperoni with chunky tomato sauce, mozzarella, and Romano cheese.  There were plenty of toppings that sat on the pizza.  I am a fan of deep dish pizza to begin with so I liked all the cheese that was present as well as that crust.  My biggest complaint was the chunky tomato sauce.

After 15 mins waiting to put my drink order in I saw him walk past us for the 3rd time since he greeted us and didn't stop. So I said excuse me! ....And he didn't like that.
