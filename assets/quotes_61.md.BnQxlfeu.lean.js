Traffic was obviously heavy on the first day but I was easily able to find parking within the garage on my second visit.  In a word, this place is incredible and I hope that they are able to keep it that way.\\n\\nI had previously gotten a Wegman's card a few years back and my first interaction with this Wegman was speaking with the worker at the card kiosk at the front of the store.  She helped me checked that my card was still active and I was pleasantly surprised that she helped my put in an order for those small key cards as I had never gotten those years back.\\n\\nWalking around the store, we saw that this place was huge and that the food court could be a place of its own with all the cooked food options and the ample seating areas.  On the other side of the store was the alcohol section.  Even though I've never brought a bottle of alcohol before, I was tempted to try buying some due to their vast selections.  In particular, the bottle shaped like a crystal skull was particularly interesting.\\n\\nThe meat section is decent and the first time I've encountered vacuum packed raw pork / beef in this state.  I've seen other Wegman stores have vacuum sealed chicken but I haven't found it yet here.\\n\\nThe produce section could be better.  Even though they have a very diverse selection and they were fresh, their prices seem higher.  For example, the conventional apples are much more expensive here than at Market Basket.  Still, there were some produce items that I've never seen before such as the lobster mushroom that peaked our interest.\\n\\nI'm loving their seafood section so far.  On our second visit, we were dazzled by the butcher cutting up a swordfish such that we brought a package ourselves.\\n\\nIn summary, we are quite impressed with this store so far and will definitely try to return this weekend to either shop or eat at the food court.

This restaurant has slowly increased from 2 stars to 3 stars to now 4 stars for me.  Fellow Yelpers Kevin C. and Marty J. joined me here for lunch yesterday.  Just after noon, not a seat in the house was open.  Wow.  I come here for lunch occasionally and have never seen it so busy.  If you come for lunch, I'd try to come a little bit early (or later) so you don't have to wait.\\n\\nJinbei has a new chef in town, Chef Kondo.  Kondo-san has worked as a sushi chef at other Japanese restaurants around town and is known for his box-style sushi.  Maybe that's why Jinbei is doing better business these days.\\n\\nKevin, Marty, and I all decided to order noodle soups for lunch.  The restaurant offers two types of ramen: shoyu (soy-based) and tonkotsu (pork-based) for $9.90 each.  They also have four types of soba and udon ($7.90 each).  If you want noodle soup with meat, then go with the ramen because the soba and udon do not have any meat in them.  The best you're going to do with those is tempura \\"crunch\\" (made from powder) or slices of tofu skin.\\n\\nRegardless, and since I've already tried the ramen here (not bad), I decided to try a bowl of kitsune udon.  This bowl of udon has two strips of fried tofu, chopped scallion, and dried seaweed flakes on top.  It wasn't bad and certainly better than some of the other udon I've tried around town, specifically Umezono just a short drive south.  Umezono's udon reminded me of Nong Shim instant udon you can buy at H Mart.  Jinbei's udon noodles were appetizingly chewy and the broth was light, yet still flavorful.\\n\\nI've yet to visit Jinbei for dinner, but would like to at some point.  They seem to have a respectable and authentic Japanese menu.  The lunch menu is available Tuesday through Friday from 11:30am to 2pm.  I do think the noodles are maybe a dollar or two overpriced, especially when you compare them to ramen-stalwarts Umaido and Raku.\\n\\nI think I'll try the soba next time."},{"name":"Mary's Cafe","address":"3209 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"The chicken bacon ranch wrap was wonderful, but next time I'll order dessert first!

It did not. As a previous reviewer stated, the Dorset Custard Tartine was underwhelming. So was the Mahi-Mahi (sadly swimming in a sad broth) and the Angus Beef Bavette (medium rare does not mean it needs to come out cold... barely room temperature). Dessert was a completely deconstructed and molecular gastronomic wannabe Red Wine-Strawberry Semifreddo, which was a punctuation mark of letdown on the meal as a whole. I know, I should have known better when the menu item said \\"foam,\\" but I do expect that a restaurant that trades on its use of local and seasonal ingredients would, you know, have actual strawberries on its one strawberry-season dessert. Even the espresso was disappointing; it came out simultaneously (and impressively) less-than-hot and underextracted.\\n\\nThe only thing we enjoyed was the cava (El Xamfra, Brut, Sant Sadurni D'Anoia, Spain).

We were a fairly large group (the place is pretty small), so had to wait about 2 hrs so we went to have beers at the Italian place on the corner.\\n\\nThey \\"close\\" at 10:30pm, but as long as you get on their waiting list, they will keep the kitchen open for you even if a table opens up after their official closing time.\\n\\nThe lobsters rolls come with HUGE chunks of lobster - it's like eating actual lobster claws sans the hassle of breaking thru the shell. OMG soooo good! FYI the hot lobster roll is dipped in butter, and the cold is mixed with mayo - I personally like the hot better.\\n\\nOther things we got:\\n* Cioppino: DELISH! Fresh seafood + excellent broth = can't go wrong. \\n* Clam chowder was the watery kind - which is supposedly the authentic version. Was good, but not the creamy type I'm used to...\\n* Oysters: got an assortment, all fresh and tasty.\\n\\nWe went to B&G to compare - B&G is more of a date place, whereas Neptune is a bit more relaxed, B&G has really small portions and only has the mayo lobster roll (chunks aren't nearly as big as Neptune's).

We saw one server, clearly overwhelmed, running back and forth, but not a lot of food coming out.  No matter, we had time before game time.  Our server took a drink order from the table next to us, then came to get ours.  We're about 20 minutes in at this point, so we gave the full order, four drinks, four sandwiches, four waters.  The waitress thanks us for our patience as, \\"With the game, we're slammed.\\"  Actually, most of the inside seats were open, as were several of the outdoor tables.\\n\\nThe number of people outside dropped as one table left, very angry -- they had not yet been given menus and they arrived ahead of us.  A second four top cleared leaving their browsed menus.  We pondered whether we should bother to wait for the order we placed as, now 35 minutes in, we still had no drinks.  Just shy of the 40 minute mark, our drinks arrived... but no waters.  Our waters came ahead of the food and we requested another round of drinks with the food.  All beverages arrived ahead of the food.  \\n\\nWe were past 60 minutes when three of the four sandwiches arrived.  Fries were cold.  Sandwiches were cooling as we waited for the fourth in our party to get their veggie burger (you know, the thing that doesn't actually need cooking?).  It was a bit more than a 5 minute wait.  Bbq sauce had been requested on the side, but was on the sandwich.  A minor thing, except the plan was to dip fries in bbq sauce.  When the waitress was asked for a side of bbq, she responded (with a bit too much sass) \\"didn't they put it on the burger?\\"  Her sass prompted the response, \\"Yes, but I WANTED it on the side for my fries.\\"  Somehow, that took longer than it should have even though we watched the process as she filled the bbq sauce from an outdoor cabinet.  \\n\\nMy hell burger was reasonably okay, but overcooked (medium is not that hard).  It was not nearly as hot as suggested, and the flavor was... well, lacking, like the service.  Four sandwiches, 8 drinks, $117.

First off, let's get started with the 5 star margaritas. These are the BEST margs in all of Boulder. The mix is house made and is the most perfect margarita mix I have ever tasted. I prefer my margs coin-style with no mix, just tequila, orange liqueur & fresh lime but this mix is light, not sour and effervescent. I would love to get my hands on their recipe. I usually go with the White Lightning marg and trust me folks, these margs don't mess around. I usually can barely finish 2. \\n\\nSecond, the atmosphere is a little divey and \\"diner-like.\\" It is your lucky night if you get a booth where you have your own private pleasure palace. This is one of my favorite places to go with a friend or friend(s) to tuck away in a booth, drink margs, eat chips & salsa and laugh the night away. \\n\\nTip: Show up early like 5:30 or 6:00 if you don't want to wait half an hour to 45 mins for a table. Esp. if you have little ones. \\n\\nAnother Tip: Although their red salsa is great, ask for the verde if you like spicy. It pairs perfectly with a side of guac to curtail the hotness. \\n\\nMy two favorite dishes here are the chicken fajitas and the blue corn enchiladas with chicken. You have to order a side of beans & rice with the enchiladas because the dish comes without. Also, if you are a Huevos fan try the Spanish Huevos Rancheros. They are delicious! \\n\\nI do not eat pork or beef which can be challenging at A LOT of Mexican joints but Efrains has my back. I can even eat the refried beans because they are made with vegetable oil and no lard.

The location cannot justify the price. Everything was $5.5 per piece there was no differentiation based on the cost of the good. There is no ambience or atmosphere. \\n- the serve alcohol but it is a horrifically generic list for the quality of fish they are serving. And the wait staff have no clue what they are. We had a very awkward yelling conversation exchange with the head chef after I asked about 'yoshis special' which I assumed was a special sake of the day. She went to ask him and he yelled from the kitchen to us about 30 feet away over multiple Tables of customers.  He also clearly didn't know about the sake.  Turned out it was a generic bottle of 'yoshi sake' not a special. \\n-it is more expensive than Maumi and the same price as the raw bar at the fairmont pacific rim and I guess that is the problem. You go to a hotel raw bar and you get your $20 cocktail and expensive sushi. Going to east van to a quiet street and getting the expensive sushi in a restaurant with table next to table (a la a regular sushi join) doesn't feel nearly as elegant. The vibe just isn't there \\n\\nIf you're super rich and don't care that you spend $250 on a sweatpant night.

I had the Roasted Macomber Turnip Soup with a Rag√∫ of Pancetta, Chestnuts, Lobster, and Mushrooms as an appetizer and the Scituate Skate Wing with Kohlrabi, Leek, and Fingerling Potato Chowder as an entree. Both dishes were very well conceived and executed and the portions were quite large. My girlfriend also had the turnip soup, and had a very generous and delicious half portion of the Laying Hen and Noodle Stew with Roasted Onion and Aged Vermont Cheese as her entree. We split a dessert called tangerine dream which was a perfect combination of sweet and savory flavors.

Today, I went to meet a friend for happy hour, and it was a nightmare.  They weren't very busy, but we only saw our waitress two or three times.  The first time my drink came, there was a fly in it, and all that they did to take care of us was to pour a new drink.  We had to ask twice for the bread, and when we asked for just rolls and no cornbread, she brought us a whopping two rolls.  (Logic would be to increase the amount of rolls to replace the pieces of cornbread not being given to the table...)  When the bread finally arrived, the spiral/conic container it was in was filthy - crusted in something along the bottom.  I would have loved to talk to someone about this but our waitress appeared to be the only person on staff actually working (everyone else was sitting at another table chatting).  Eventually, someone from the back brought us our check so we could get the hell outta dodge before something even grosser happened.

My friend and I arrived at 5:30 and the restaurant was already nearing capacity. It was packed...with ladies. I counted only three guys in the entire restaurant. Fortunately, we were able to get one of the few remaining tables without having to wait (as we were leaving we heard the hostess tell parties coming in that the wait would be over an hour). I had been to Match before (see previous review) and loved the atmosphere, darkly lit with beautiful, real fireplaces on the walls. However, immediately after entering, I was put off by the very LOUD and BAD music they were playing. We are ladies. We cannot be satisfied with just looking at each other all night. We want to have a conversation. While we could communicate a bit, it was difficult to hear each other. We were just in time to take advantage of their Happy Hour $1 burger special. I was pleased with the lamb burger I had but the regular burger was almost inedible. The meat was a bizarre combination of raw and tough. My entree, however, the blackened salmon with risotto was excellent, and certainly a great deal at $5 for the ladies. Their cocktails are all pricey at $12 or so. Also, when I first visited Match back in 2006 they served the cocktails in little martini shakers (you can see a photo of the shakers in a photo somone else posted here) and often they were generous with the amount of cocktail in the shaker, so you'd get one and a half or two drinks for your $12. Not so this time. No shakers. Moreover, our waitress brought me the wrong drink. I wasn't going to complain since the drink she did bring me wasn't bad and it was insanely busy, but I was not too pleased. Also, my friend ordered a steak and was not given a steak knife. Also, they charged us the regular price for one of the $1 burgers. Although they promptly corrected the error when we inquired about it, stuff like this never adds to your dining experience.

The place is bright and lively with a simple chipotle style line up to pick out the ingredients for your bowl. You get choices for your base (carb), protein, veggies, add ons like cheese and avocado, and then sauce. I chose to get a 6 bowl (two bases, two proteins, two veggies, and a sauce) because everything looked so good! They let you try the foods if you ask. I got a bowl with sweet potato noodles, coconut rice, sesame green beans, sweet potato, teriyaki tofu, baked almond chicken, and creamy white ginger sauce. Woooof what a hefty bowl that was. Definitely not a light meal, though now knowing what a like I can go with a 4 bowl. I loved the sweet potato noodles. These are cold noodles with some sort of seasoning on them (sesame? Not sure). The baked almond chicken is super crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside. Sesame green beans and sweet potato were reliably good, as with the coconut rice and teriyaki tofu (super flavorful, soft). I didn't really touch the creamy ginger sauce, since the bowl with al it's flavors (that somehow went together super well) didn't really need anything extra though it was very fresh and gingery when I tried it. \\n\\nI also loved the black currant tea mixed with strawberry Fresca. Just a touch of sweet to the drink which was exactly what I wanted! My friend got the zucchini brownies to share, which were delightful. Super moist but not dense. A light dessert that was plenty sweet enough! \\n\\nI'm curious to try the no moo milk (almond milk type of drink) and the juices, though a meal can get a lil pricier for a casual meal with those. \\n\\nThe service was great.

While she finished every last morsel of it, she was stuffed and couldn't eat lunch and wasn't hungry again until dinner.\\n\\nSo when 5 of us went a couple days later, we decided to share a few things, so we'd have room to try all of the other yummy things that Portland has to offer.  So we ordered:\\n\\n*The Reggie Deluxe\\n*Pine State Fried Club\\n*Andoulle Corn Dog\\n*Large side of Gravy (this is a must!)\\n\\nThe amount of food from these three dishes was perfect!  If you go to Pine State's website and take a look at their pictures, you won't need any further description from me, on any of our choices.  I do have to say that it's definitely worth trying the Andoulle Corn Dog!! When else have you had an andoulle sausage in a corn dog?!?! Then served with their mustard?

Friday night 5 pm and hardly anyone is in the place. I made  reservations through Open Table and did not realize that Friday night was buffet night (I don't usually eat at buffets). There was not a huge variety of food. The salad bar was nice: fresh fixings and leaf lettuce-not iceberg. My biggest complaint was with the entrees and veggies. They were all at room temperature or cold. The green beans were almost raw. The hush puppies were soft, the hot chicken sliders were not crispy, and the beef was dry but tender. The best part of the meal were the desserts. There was this Nutella cannoli that was wonderful and a tasty bread pudding. The salad and dessert are the only reasons I'm giving this place two stars.

Anyway, this is how we ended up with seven hundred dollars in appetizers.\\n\\nThe server suggested a \\"shellfish\\" appetizer and she also suggested adding the in season crabs, actually she suggested it multiple times before we agreed. Foolishly we didn't ask, but we had all assumed the shellfish appetizer meant a few muscles, clams and oysters. So you can imagine our shock when a two big dishes of king crab, rock lobsters, shrimp, stone crab, and yes, oysters came out. \\n\\nAll of these are technically shellfish, but not what you would expect when ordering a shellfish appetizer and not the portions you would expect either. Our server never explained any of the \\"shellfish\\" that came out, so I have to assume it was the largest and most expensive portion of king crab, rock lobsters, shrimp, stone crab and oysters that Big Fin offers.\\n\\nWe had just come off an international flight and everyone was tired and this was a business dinner, so no one wanted to start a fuss. I guess our server saw an opportunity to make a killing on the upsell. The server was successful too because after the meal my colleague, who is a quiet Japanese guy, just paid the bill without saying a word. Actually I just find out about this outrageous bill today.\\n\\nSo here is my critique of Big Fin, based on the fact Big Fin sees itself as a restaurant that can charge hundreds of dollars for appetizers. Also keep in mind we came in around 6pm on a Monday.\\n\\nMediocre Service:\\n-Besides the \\"shellfish\\" debacle, our server described every entree as \\"good,\\" and \\"it's very fresh.\\"\\n-We were tired and indecisive, but she would only give us about 10 seconds to order before saying \\"ok, I'll come back to you.\\"\\n-The server knocked my colleague's jacket to the ground twice.\\n-A drink order came out wrong, and one was forgotten.\\n-We were all wearing dark suits, but we were given white napkins. Midway through the meal our server asked if we wanted black napkins. *This should have been done without asking. **We never received black napkins.\\n\\nMediocre Restaurant:\\n-The tables are cramped and too close to neighboring tables. We had a table in the corner, but during the meal the staff couldn't reach our clients so we had to pass drinks and dishes to them. We had made a reservation so a better table could have been provided for our group.\\n-The menu is a large laminated sheet, much like Red Lobster.\\n-The food is a plain, no frills affair. Actually our server was correct, the food is \\"good.\\"\\n-The ambiance is nice, but it doesn't look like the kind of restaurant that is charging 3 Star Michelin prices.\\n\\nAt a different price point none of these things would bother me, but for a restaurant charging nearly $700 dollars for appetizers it's unacceptable.\\n\\nYou have lots of seafood choices in Orlando, don't go to Big Fin."},{"name":"Scampo","address":"215 Charles St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"It all started during restaurant week, only it wasn't actually restaurant week.

The fact that I'm not done looking at the menu, or am not ordering dessert, does not worry me in the slightest. You worry me.

A platter entirely too large for me it has a huge arkansa rib, two memphis ribs, two texas ribs and the brisket. The ribs were delicious but it was hard getting the meat off the arkansa rib. The other two ribs were delicious and fall off the bones. The brisket was very smokey and a little too dry - has to do with the thick cut I think. The ribs came with a choice of sauce - I chose the hot bbq. It was delish! It came with two sides - beans and coleslaw which I replaced with succotash and collard greens.

Absolutely loved it.  Now, I think it's just OK.  The decor is very cool.  Service is often good, sometimes exceptional, like the time we wanted over 40 minutes for lunch, so they gave us many coupons.  Or the time they got my whole car hop order wrong, so they sent me a $50 gift certificate.  And I still have an entree, balsamic glazed salmon that I love here.  I think the appetizers, drinks, and desserts are the reason to go.  Skip the salads, pizzas, sandwiches, & entrees (for the most part).  Also, they always, always forget my sparkling water when I order car hop service.  Is it that hard?  It's on the way from the cash register to the door!  I do think it's one of the better chains (can't really stand Applebee's, Friday's, Ruby Tuesday's, Chili's, Bugaboo, Outback, etc.).  However, if you do not live in the 'burbs, there's no real reason (convenience & actually liking one entree that way it is without making changes being the major ones for me) to go here.

It wasn't as salty as the menu described, but the buttery finish just smooth out the fresh taste even more. The steamed mussel appetizer was probably as delicious and worthy as a seafood dish gets. The broth with peanuts was creamy but not overwhelmingly rich, and it went perfectly with the bread doll. Since we went on a Monday, they served the legendary lobster spaghetini. It definitely deserved a two thumb up.

Yes, I understand its cruel and controversial, but the duck gets eaten anyway. The liver is amazing, slowly melting in your mouth as it oozes out a delicious and mild duck flavor. The pineapple jam adds a great contrast and the remainder can be devoured with the piece of toast. Absolutely splendid.\\n\\n- Tandoori Rack of Lamb ($22/Half): Two massive lamb chops cooked medium rare and marinated in tandoori spices. They did exactly what I despise about lamb in American restaurants. Charred black on the outside, red on the inside. Lamb should be slow cooked and medium-well throughout. The flavor is outstanding and the way they marinated it is great, which almost makes up for not cooking it right.\\n\\n- Duck Duck Potatoes ($8): Deep fried potato wedges, creme fraiche, and a runny duck egg.

WARNING  !!!!!\\n\\nIf you do not get to the restaurant by 7:00 pm, you may not get seated - that's how busy this place is.  I am not joking, I watched them turn away more than a dozen dining parties because they were booked for the night.  They do not take reservations, either.\\n\\nNow that that's out of the way, let's talk food.\\n\\nI was in Boston this week for a convention and decided I wanted lobster.  Friends from home suggested I go to \\"Legal Seafood\\", but after asking some locals their opinion, the consensus was that Neptune Oyster was the place to go.\\n\\nSo I checked Yelp and the reviews said I had to try the lobster roll.  Now that I had a plan, it was tune to set out and get my dinner.  Fortunately my hotel is only a 15 minute walk through a very nice section of town to the \\"Little Italy\\" area where Neptune is located.\\n\\nI arrived at 7:10 and put my name on the list.  I was told that there would be \\"at least an hour wait, maybe longer\\".  They took my name and cell number and said they would call me when my seat was available.  The restaurant is small, maybe 10 tables and the bar seats maybe another 15 people.  This explains why the wait is so long.\\n\\nWhile I waited, I walked around Little Italy.  What a nice, charming area!  I haven't been around a nice community like this in a long time.  Lots of other restaurants, bars, and shops to check out - I wish I was going to be here longer...\\n\\nAnyway, I was called at 8:15 and was told my seat was ready.  I sat down at the counter in the 1st seat by the door.  I had a great view of the oyster bar and the street, so dinner and a show!\\n\\nThe waitress was quick to bring me some water and a menu, but I already knew what I was going to have....clam chowdah and a lobstah roll!  I placed my order and waited anxiously.  I didn't have to wait long and my chowdah arrived.  This was some very good clam chowder with BIG chunks of clam and potatos, and some very small diced celery bits.  This chowder was thin (think mikly, not the thick creamy stuff that comes out of a can).  The waitress even asked me if I wanted fresh ground pepper in it (yes, please!).\\n\\nAs I was finishing my soup, the lobster roll arrived.  No before we get to the lobster roll, I need to talk about the fries that came with the dish.  Normally I'm very 'meh' on fries - they're always soggy, or greasy, or blah.  THESE WERE THE BEST FRIES I'VE HAD IN AGES!!!  Hot, crispy (but not greasy), and they had a nice TASTE to them - not that typical 'meh' taste that requires a ton of salt and/or ketchup.\\n\\nNow for the lobster roll, and we'll start with the 'roll' part.  Again, rolls to me are usually kinda stale, tasteless, and usually the worst part of a sandwich.  This roll is baked fresh at a local baker about 4 blocks away (I think that's where she said it was).  It was incredibly fresh, SOFT, buttery, and delicious!  It was about 7-8\\" long, and STUFFED with lobster.\\n\\nI opted for the hot lobster and butter combo (versus the cold lobster with mayo).  The lobster is Maine lobster, and there are HUGE chunks of tail meat and claw meat in there.  This brings us a good point - this is a messy eat.  If you're wearing a suit or dress shirt - roll up the sleeves or you'll get lobster meat and butter all over them.\\n\\nAll I can say is this was fastastic!  The lobster was fresh, the bread was fresh, and the fries were crispy!  If I ever make it back this way, I will probably try the Crab Coctail instead of the chowder, but I'm definately having the lobster roll again!\\n\\nNow go forth and have the best lobster roll you'll ever eat - you'll thank me later.\\n\\nOh, and don't forget to go early!"},{"name":"Hooters","address":"1143 Broadway","city":"Saugus","stars":"3","text":"I knew this place was legit just by the way the parking lot was filled.

I've had beignets from a dozen different places and each gives their unique variation on the consistency, size and shape.  Of all of them, I might prefer Tibby's which comes out layered as though they probably folded the dough in a manner akin to how croissant dough is formed (except I conjecture they use shortening instead of butter).  In contrast, others seem more like a pate au choux cut square and plopped into hot oil with pockets of large bubbles -- still tasty, mind you, but Tibby's is probably the best.\\n\\nTheir Shrimp and Andouille Cheddar Grits are superb.  They serve it with a red wine sauce that reminds me of a sherry sauce: rich, brown, intensely flavorful. Its excellent flavor comes through when eaten with the buttered bread served with the dish.  Tibby's sauce was a nice surprise.  Most cajun & creole restaurants serve shrimp & grits with a red eye gravy, usually delicious, but Tibby's superior red wine sauce sets them apart.\\n\\nFor lunch I had \\"Maw's fries\\", their spin on Poutine, a French Canadian dish of fries covered in gravy and cheese.  Looks disgusting, tastes delicious.\\n\\nTheir crawfish pies were mostly dry, flaky pastry -- couldn't taste the filling very much.  Would have been improved by a rich sauce -- which Tibby's has proven they can make well.\\n\\nThe roux in their √©touff√©e is sadly quite bland, which is remarkable since it should be made from butter.  It's somewhat spicey but despite a lot of macho chest-thumping about hot sauce, capsaicin provides heat but lacks flavor.  Probably the blandest √©touff√©e I've ever had.\\n\\nIf you've had shrimp and alligator cheesecake elsewhere (such as at Jacque-Imo's in NOLA), you'll find Tibby's disappointing; it's more like a casserole with overcooked, chewy meat.  It inexplicably also contains panko breadcrumbs, which makes this dish more like a casserole than the tender, mildly cheesy souffle it should be.  At $11 for a weird (in a bad way) take on what at other places is a cullinary revolution, skip this appetizer at Tibby's.\\n\\nTheir Tibby's style shrimp po-boy with remoulade is adequately flavorful and has a nice crunch.  I had it with their New Orleans Potato Salad which (with sausage, bacon, olives, pickles and onions) sounds more flavorful than it tastes. I'm not sure how you can make something with bacon and pickles not be packed with flavor but they managed it.\\n\\nService has been consistently above average.  Wait staff are attentive and accommodating without being intrusive or cutesy.  For example, when I ordered a single order of shrimp & grits, they presented it on 2 separate plates.  More often than not, at casual restaurants they don't provide these common courtesies, so I was pleasantly surprised.\\n\\nDuring Sunday brunch they had a live jazz band.  It was a little too loud for my preference (which is, admittedly, something closer to silence) but tolerable.\\n\\nIf I could wave a magic wand, for Sunday brunch I would have them offer more breakfast items, akin to the menu of Lucile's in Boulder and Denver: Pain Perdu and poached eggs with hollandaise, on a buttermilk biscuit with sausage with sausage, or comestibles to that effect.\\n\\nDecor is an ostentatious jumble of color and shapes including snapshots of Louisiana in hand-painted frames and \\"sculptures\\" that probably rode on Mardi Gras parade floats.  It suits the place.\\n\\nTibby's gives a tasty, distinct sampling of some traditional Louisiana dishes, with good service and fair-to-high prices for most dishes, but they excel mostly at shrimp & grits and beignets."},{"name":"The Beignet Connection","address":"349 Decatur St SE, Bldg 1, Ste C","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"I read about this place on the AJC and was very curious to try them as I LOVE cajun/creole food.  I had the oyster/shrimp po boy and a side of gumbo.  The gumbo was TO DIE FOR, But the sandwich seemed under-dressed with very little condiments or sauce on it, so it was mostly bread and very dry.  The shrimp po boys only had five shrimp on them, which contributed to the bread to filling ratio.  The food came out relatively quickly but had to wait for our order to be taken, which was frustrating because the place was empty besides us.  All of us were left hungry by 3:00 pm.  One of the pickier guys that was in the group called and asked if five shrimp in a sandwich was standard and he was told that it was.  He was also told we should have received coupons for our next visit that we never received, so that was frustrating too.  I also got an order of Beignets, and was a little underwhelmed.

My friend's birthday was yesterday, and she had never been to PCG so another friend and I wanted to make it special for her. We made reservations for 6:30, but were instructed to arrive 30 minutes early if we wanted a window seat -- absolutely fine with us, because the view is one of the best parts of the experience. Upon arrival at 6:00 we were told there was a 45 minute wait for a window seat, but we could sit in the bar and wait for a free table. We were starving and ready for appetizers, so we found a table in the back of the bar and ordered some drinks and food. A while later, our food had been delivered to us and before we could even put a piece of anything in our mouth our table in the dining room was ready. One of the hostesses came to take us to our table and I asked if someone else would be able to take our food and drinks for us or if we had to carry it ourselves. With horrible disgust in her reply, she said we had to be responsible for our orders as if we should know that already. What if we had ordered multiple plates? Am I supposed to whip out wait service skills that I do not have on my resume experience? Although hesitant, we followed behind and walked through the bar and the dining room with our belongings, our food, and our drinks all the way to our table with every single person in the dining room watching us. I cannot tell you how belittled and embarrassed we all felt. Is this normal for Portland City Grill? Is this how customers are supposed to feel? I wonder if we were only a few years of age older if this young lady would have made us carry our food all the way across the restaurant. Fast forward a little bit to when we were actually sat down at our table, one of the other hostesses would walk around the dining room and keep record of the tables that were open (I believe this is what she was doing) and every time she would walk by our table she would look at us and glare. How much more unprofessional can this experience get? I wish so badly I got both of these girls names, because I will absolutely be contacting management.

The chocolate covered candied bacon is absurdly good.  It's no gimmick that's riding the bacon craze, and I'm not one of those \\"zomg-ahhhhh-it'sbacon\\" kind of people.  It's art.\\n\\nThe deep fried sandwiches *scream* late night snack.  The fried sriracha grilled cheese is good, but probably better enjoyed when intoxicated.  The fried PBJ is legitimately delicious, especially when they have a jalapeno strawberry jam.  The jelly changes pretty regularly.  The fried marshmallow-nutella sandwich is perfect for a chilly night, after dinner (perhaps pizza at Via 313?) and you want something sweet... really sweet.  It's so good, though probably doesn't quite hit the astronomical expectations I set for it in my head.\\n\\nThe deep fried Oreos are so much better than regular Oreos.  They get warm and the cookie part gets soft, and it almost melts in your mouth.  Highly recommended to share as a dessert appetizer.\\n\\nPerhaps the best thing on the menu (other than the bacon) are the deep fried brownie bites.  I can't explain it.  But you really can't explain transcendent experiences.  I ordered them alongside the deep fried cinnamon buns, which are topped with their usual icing, and the brownies blew the cinnamon buns out of the water, er, oil.  \\n\\nThe fries that I had were good.  They are hand-cut in the trailer and fried to order.  You get a great potato flavor and help cut all the sweetness from everything else.  When I had them they spent maybe 30 seconds too long in the fryer, so they were a little dark, but the flavor was still there.\\n\\nLast up was the funnel cake, which you can get as a \\"skinny sister\\" or \\"fat brother\\".  The skinny sister is a crispier, more spread out funnel cake whereas the fat brother really takes advantage of living in a 3-D world.  It's get tall and fluffy.  I think they're good, but not the best thing on the menu.  There are lots of great toppings you can add to them, so get creative!\\n\\nI haven't tried a corn dog yet, so that's pretty much all I haven't had.

Who would have thought right?  Yea, me too, I was amazed when I tried it.  \\n\\nThis place is small and expect to wait no less than 30 minutes when you go, unless you go right when they open.  Also expect to be cozy with the other diners because again, it place is small.  We went for dinner on our trip to boston and I thought we wouldn't have to wait that long since we arrived at 5:00 ish, boy was I wrong.  When I got there, there was a line and we were told that the wait would be approximately 45 minutes.  BUT the hostess was very nice and told us that if we leave our number they can call us when our table when be 10 minutes from being ready so we can get back to the restaurant in time.  \\n\\nWhen we finally got to sit down and eat, we ordered the Neptune Plateau and some additional oysters, which weren't included in our Plateau.  The descriptions of the oysters on their oysters were dead on!  They described the taste of the oysters to the tee and they were amazing and fresh.  Aside from the oysters, their crab, lobster, and shrimp salad were SUPERB.  Each salad had big clumps of meat in them and I left this place STUFFED.  I had originally intended to just stop here for appetizers but I could not eat another bite afterward.\\n\\nOne thing we really wanted that we weren't able to order that night because it had already ran out at 6:00 PM!!! were the cherry stone clams.  I guess this is another good reason to go early because their food items run out quick!\\n\\nNow how did I come by the burger?  As I said earlier, you're very cozy with your neighboring diners.  We sat next to a family having dinner and the woman kept raving to her dad about how great the burger was and that she had to have the burger again (she'd obviously eaten there before).  So when the waitress came to take the order, her dad ordered the burger and when she ordered it the waitress apologized and told her that her dad had ordered the last burger!  I was in disbelief and so was my bf, after we had dinner there, we both couldn't stop thinking about the burger.  \\n\\nSo what did we do?  We ditched one of the other restaurants we planned on eating at and went back to Neptune's or lunch right before we headed back to NY.  And guess what?  This burger was just about the BEST BURGER!  It was sooooo juicy and the bun was just perfect.  And I usually eat my burgers with everything catchup, mayo, mustard, tomato, etc.  But I did not add anything additional to my burger.  It already had some kind of mayo on it and it was just perfect.

Well, a year after my opening-night 5 star review, some of the shine has worn off. \\n\\nLet's start with the good...\\n\\nLocation. I love that this restaurant exists and is where it is. This stretch of West Broadway needed something like this and that hasn't changed. Much love for that. \\n\\nService. The servers have always been very good and very friendly. It always helps to have people on top of things and this has been an area where Lincoln has shined in my visits. \\n\\nFood. The burger is still great. The pizzas have been getting some glowing reviews and are still pretty good despite my displeasure on recent changes (more on that below). Plus, let's not forget about brunch where if you want a boozy morning meal, this place delivers.\\n\\nSo what's not so great...\\n\\nNoise. This place is LOUD. REALLY LOUD!! Its actually pretty obnoxious. I came here with my parents and almost couldn't wait to get out. You literally have to yell to be able to talk to someone diagonally across from you. This is a product of all the hard surfaces in the place. It looks great but lets get some softer surfaces somewhere to absorb this noise. Foam on the ceiling or something. Anything. Please. \\n\\nNightlife. The set up of this place doesn't really seem to be conducive to getting drinks with a bigger group of people. If you have a dozen friends and want to stand near the bar, you're probably going to be out of luck. There's just not enough space here. Not that this stops people from trying. Which makes navigating around the place nearly impossible. But you know, maybe I'm just old. (Don't get me started on the lines to get in.)\\n\\nCost. So I've been trying to figure out the pricing of the menu items since this place opened. I thought management just needed to settle into a groove or something, but this isn't the case. Half the appetizers are more expensive than half of the rest of the menu. And a side of fries is 2/3rd the price of a burger and fries. There are a couple items I stick to on this menu because by comparison everything else is a ripoff. And that's sad.\\n\\nFood. Sometime around the late-summer 2013 they changed around their menus here. Portions got smaller. Their egg and cheese brunch sandwich started to get served on a weak biscuit. The benedict seemed to shrink overnight. Even the beloved pizza here went from a wood-fired thin crust to a wood-fired THIN crust. I mean, this is no joke. I didn't even know it was possible to roll dough this thin let alone hope it will stand up to cheese and toppings. Its all very sad. The food is still good, it just seems to be getting worse instead of better and that's obviously not good.\\n\\nAll in all it pains me a bit to write this update. So much potential here and instead of getting better as the place grows up it seems to be taking advantage of its popularity. I'll keep coming back here but as more and more restaurants open up in the neighborhood (hi Stephanie's in Southie!) Lincoln is going to have to start thinking of ways to step up the game instead of stepping back."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Incredibly hard to get in, but if you can, DO IT. \\n\\nBurger was uh-maze-ing.

We patiently waited knowing our patience would be rewarded with the artichoke sandwich.  10 minutes later, it was our turn. My friend ordered her meal first, followed by me at a different cashier...same order, different cashiers, one minute apart.  Another 10 minutes go by, and they announce my friend's name.

It was especially surprising since the menu online still reflects its original Malaysian heritage.  It is now another Chinese restaurant in Chinatown serving noodles and rice, rice porridge and a variety of seafood, chicken, beef and pork dishes.  Sure, dim sum is served all day (starting at $2.75), and they offer lunch specials on weekdays, but I was hoping to pick up something different for my lunch.\\n\\nMaking the best out of the situation, I took the opportunity to try their scallion pancakes (I love that stuff!) $4.50 and also ordered the Chow Fun with Beef Brisket $6.95 since I figured that crispy Pan Fried Noodles wouldn't stay crispy all that long in a box.\\n\\nThe wait wasn't bad despite the hopping dining room (good thing though since there really isn't a good place to wait there).  Paying with Levelup for my first time ever though, I found out that they were going to charge me 25 cents for charging under $20.  This was their business practice.  (Although according to the small print on their take-out menu, they have a $15 minimum for credit cards.)  Well, at least this was explained to me rather than just tacked on without informing me - for that I would have cried out foul and called my credit card company to complain.\\n\\nThe Chow Fun was basic and good, but as for the scallion pancake, I found it nice and chewy with an exterior crisp.  Eight triangles to an order, most of which went into my belly.  Another diner commented that it was likely one of those commercially made and bought and cooked up in the kitchen, but I still liked it well enough... although a nice sprinkling of salt as it was cooking would have hit the spot.\\n\\n\\n*** 2/2014 dim sum visit ***\\n\\nA dim sum menu with wipe off capabilities presented along with a marker - great idea!\\n\\nMost dim sum items were fine.  The roast pork bun not so much - it tasted wrong somehow.  And they were missing my favorite, the panfried dried shrimp rice noodles - sadness...\\n\\nPS - the bathroom is no longer gorgeous.  Although the purse hook is still cute.\\n\\n*** 7/2016 ***\\n\\nA friend told me that they had silver needle noodles here at Bubor Cha Cha, and so I had to come!\\n\\nThis is called Stir Fried Pearl Noodle (dry) $9.50 under their Noodle menu, and my childhood recollections of it was at China Pearl for dim sum.  It would be pushed over in a cart neatly nestled on a plate beneath a clear glass bowl.  Thick rice noodles in the form of fat cylinders that came to a point at either end.  Nice and chewy.  Like udon noodles, yet not.

The table that was sat before us actually was greeted in a reasonable fashion. After 10 minutes passed we decided to leave and we let another server know. We also asked about the Hawaiian Opah(I specifically came for this fish). Mahi-Mahi was used in replacement for this fish at the same $38 price point. When we spoke to a server as we were leaving, she mentioned this was the same as the Opah. I am well versed in the difference between these two fish and this is far from the case. In addition, Mahi-Mahi is easily available on both coasts while Opah is a Pacific fish(it is also called the moonfish). \\n\\nThere is absolutely no reason for this location to keep the $38 price point for this dish and switch to a much \\"cheaper\\" fish such as mahi-mahi which is of much lower quality than Opah. \\n\\nIf you change your menu, it should be updated on your website.

Once we found where to park, we were super excited to try this place after some of the reviews we'd heard from some of the locals. \\n\\nWe followed the sign instructions that told us to \\"Seat Yourself\\". We found a nice place to sit on the patio outside and began our waiting to see a waitress. Yep, kept on waiting....and waiting...and waiting some more. 10 minutes later, as I had hit my limit of waiting, my husband went and FOUND a waitress and basically said \\"Um, hey! Customers waiting outside.\\" We got our drinks ordered and we began to browse the menu. We told our waitress that it was our first visit and asked if she had any recommendations or if there was one thing that was her absolute favorite. The recommendation was the tuna tacos, so that was what I ordered. My husband ordered the brisket and my daughter ordered the chipotle something taco (her words, not mine). \\n\\nThe portion sizes are absolutely huge! My daughter was not able to eat more than half of one of her tacos before she was full. My husband had to stop eating his tacos because there was so much grease from the brisket that it was inundating every bite. He said he wanted more beef, less grease. The tuna tacos were good, but not something that I would personally choose again. \\n\\nOverall our experience was very \\"Eh\\". The service was mediocre at best and I give it that because we sat for so long without ever seeing a waitress and then having to go find one on our own. While she was nice, my suggestion to other young waitresses who are waiting on families, don't ever, ever pay more attention to the father than you do to the wife or even the teenagers in the group. When you attempt to shove your pretty, young body on the father in front of his family...all you're successfully doing is making darn sure that the wife/mother is NOT ever going to come back.

We waited about 35 mins and got a seat at the bar.\\nOrdered a few diff types of oysters based on the menu description and all of them were excellent!\\nFor the entree, ordered the cold lobster roll and a seafood stew. The lobster roll was filled with large, tail lobster pieces mixed with a light mayo dressing. The flavor was basic, to the point, pure lobster heaven. The bum was nicely baked and brushed with butter. The seafood stew was outstanding. Fresh mussels, fish, and other seafood cooked in a very light fish broth with rice. Again, simple flavoring, fresh ingredient perfectly executed.\\nNow the reason for 4 stars rather than 5. First, this past weekend in Boston was steamy with temp reaching to the low 90's. The restaurant had no AC and it was very hot, humid, and uncomfortable. With the addition of alcoholic consumptions I am surprised no customer fainted or passed out from heat stroke. Also, being there are lots of raw food on the menu, I do not know how long the food can stay fresh once they are served. Everyone in the restaurant all have red, flushed faces.

Great flavors as well (we tried the apple fritter, vanilla bean, orange pistachio, dark chocolate, caramel bacon, and almond joy-nut. all yeast types). The almond joy-nut was surprisingly good (I don't usually like filled doughnuts), but the almond filling was so light and airy that it complemented the chewy texture of the doughnut.

We received a $100 gift certificate from a friend and were excited to have a celebratory 24th anniversary dinner..\\n\\nI was wearing a dress and my husband a suit.  After all, this is the \\"nicest restaurant in Portland\\".  Upon arrival, we realized that even in the most highly recommended and finest restaurant in Portland, we were overdressed.  How disappointing - no dress code.  Patrons were wearing everything from cutoffs to sequins.  \\n\\nAlthough we had a reservation, we had to wait 20 minutes for our table.  We went to the bar for a drink.  The view is fantastic and so were the drinks and bar service.  Very relaxing and friendly.  Unfortunately our food did not follow the same pattern.\\n\\nWe ordered an appetizer and entrees.  Service was a hair slow but acceptable.  We were granted a window seat which was lovely.  Little confetti Happy Anniversary signs were on the table - great touch!  \\n\\nMy husband ordered a sirloin steak medium rare.  When the food arrived he cut into his steak, it was cooked like ahi tuna: flash seared and completely fleshy and still cold in the center.  I didn't believe him so I touched the center of the steak - incredibly disappointing.  Unfortunately the waiter didn't return to check on how the meal was until I had finished my plate.  Of course at that time it was too late to correct the steak as my husband would be eating alone.  Nothing pisses us off more than not cooking the meal correctly the first time.  And why should you not expect this from one of the highest rated restaurants in Portland?\\n\\nThe waiter finally stopped by and saw the raw, fleshy meat.   He offered to recook the steak (really???? after being off the grill for 10 minutes?) however my husband declined and left dinner-less. Anyone that cooks knows how steaks turn out that are cooked, taken off the grill, cooled completely and then cooked again.  Is this what you expect from a $40 entree?  Ridiculous.  This was not a s\\n\\"special\\", but instead was a menu item.  We asked for the check.\\n\\nThe head chef came to our to our table prior to our departure.  He said that he heard our steak was unacceptable and offered his apologies.  My husband asked, \\"Did you see the steak?\\"  The chef said no.  How can a problem be corrected if the leader doesn't care to even view the error to know what to correct????  \\n\\nWe received the bill with the steak dinner remaining on the tab.  REALLY?  We will not be back to use the balance of our gift certificate, we will not return for another meal, and we will not recommend this restaurant to any of our friends or visitors.\\n\\nThis is one of those restaurants that rides on their prior established reputation making all believe they are eating at an iconic establishment.  Don't think this place is wonderful just because it is supposed to be.  Obviously they could care less whether or not you are their customer.    I can recommend you a dozen  restaurants in Portland who take great pride in their establishment, their food and their customers.

It was big which was nice and I was able to split it 3 ways with my party. The presentation looked very appetizing as well! But the thickest outer layer was sub par and honestly a bit dry. Like biting into the outside, the entire piece tasted dry and mundane and lacked that soft smooth taste and texture. The gooey middle was very yummy(hard for any cinnamon roll to not have a delicious middle)! What also made it less than ideal for me was the small bit of Bourbon Caramel around the outer layer which, once you cut into it, stayed on top and because it was a thin layer to begin with, my bites consisted of just cinnamon roll dough and not much else. There was one spot that did have a good amount of frosting which can be seen dripping down the side in my photo. I don't expect that they completely submerge the cinnamon roll in frosting but I would of liked to have a little bit more at least spread around the edges so at least you get more of that real, hearty, nostalgic cinnamon roll taste and feel with each bite.\\n\\nIt's worth stopping by and eating here if you're in the area.

Also, I almost keeled over and died, the creme brulee was so good. Their brisket enchiladas and queso were solid (not sure they could do any wrong with the brisket). Their salsa is fine but not particularly special.\\n\\nBecause so much of what I've had was so good, I'm giving Garrido's an extra star. What would bring this place down to a 3 for me is the service. I just haven't had good service once, and being on the pricey side of Mexican, that's something of an issue. Most recently it took more than 15 minutes to get water after being seated. Another 15 to get our drinks from the bar. Later that night, the server would come and get a drink order from one person, and then walk off quickly, not bothering to ask if anyone else at the table would also like another drink (the answer would have been yes, unfortunately for the other 5 of us). And it's never been busy when I've gone, strangely enough.\\n\\nI will be back because my husband still hasn't been and has had to listen to me rave endlessly about brisket tacos, and also because the patio looks amazing and it's finally cooling down, but we'll probably go for lunch to spend a little less.

The bar is set high here, and my list of favorite restaurants in town is long.  Tasty N Alder is at the top of my list.  \\n\\nIt's really pretty hard for me to improve on, or add much to, the review from Viclaire S  I've experienced the same sort of \\"problems\\" she mentions in her review.\\n\\nThe biggest problem I have whenever I go to TnA is that I want to try everything.  Almost everything here is good, but I'm a hopeless addict when it comes to the Radicchio salad.  I promised my wife that the next time we go I'll only order the small plate order, but I'm already wavering.  I really hope I can keep that promise.  The hush puppies here are flat out the best (by far) that I've ever tried, and duck egg potatoes are to die for.  I could go on and on, but what's the point.  Some things are better than others, largely depending on what your tastes runs to.  I think a pasta dish we ordered one time wasn't mind blowing (it was good, but then everything here is good).  \\n\\nOne of the cool things about this place is that you can order a lot of small plates, and so you can try a lot of different things (and so get a feel for the range of the kitchen's capabilities).  In theory, that should also help to keep the meal from being too overwhelming with a lot of rich food, but this never works out very well for us (invariably we order more food than we really need).  The wine list is pretty decent here as well.  I wouldn't call it fabulous, but there are a sufficient number of selections that we can always find something delicious to go with our meal.  Likewise, service has always been very professional and gracious.  At least the times we've stopped in, I've always been more than satisfied with the service here.\\n\\nThe only real problem with this place is that it's so damned popular.  Consequently, waits for a table can be considerable at times (they don't take reservations, unless you have a particularly large party).  However, the last couple of times we stopped by, we got here right around 5:00 when the dining room opens (and so our wait was pretty brief).  \\n\\nThere are a lot of really good restaurants in Portland.

I didn't bother looking online or reading any reviews, which would've mentioned the wait or the atmosphere, so we trotted right in at 7:30 on a Thurs. night with our one year old.  The people there must have thought we were crazy.  After putting our name on the hour-and-a-half wait list, we were lucky enough to find a couple of seats open up at the bar right before we were going to order our waiting drinks, and I wondered why everyone else at the bar was only drinking and nobody was eating burgers.  Then after we put in our order and their food started showing up, I found out - you have to wait a really. long. time to get your food.  We stayed entertained feeding the baby (food from home) and looking at the money hanging everywhere, bumper stickers, etc., occasionally shouting over the really loud music, and eavesdropping on some of the servers' conversation, which is always fun, and finally our food came out. \\n\\nWe had decided to split a full order of wings (12 I think) and a Thurman burger.  Good choice...I could not imagine eating that whole thing myself, and that's not even the BIG one!  The wings aren't split like they are at most places, so you have two joints to finagle, which means yes, they're huge, but they're also impossible to eat with one hand, like when you're holding a baby, just so you know.  Our server recommended the Cajun sauce, which was amazing!  Lesson learned: trust the staff recommendations here!\\n\\nI thoroughly enjoyed my half of the burger, though it too is very difficult to eat one-handed while holding a baby (but I persevered...I have talent!)  Hubby thought the ham was unnecessary on the burger and distracted from the yummy beef, but I thought all the flavors complemented one another nicely...I mean, it's a giant greasy burger; why not have ham, right?   \\n\\nThis is a true one-of-a-kind experience in Columbus.  Having no idea what to expect except for great food, we were surprised by the long wait (to get a table, and then again for food), but not crabby about it.  We showed up with a one year old and probably seemed crazy, but we made it manage.

When we tried to ask the server, she didn't seem to understand our question or have any recommendations. \\n\\nFor sushi I ordered the Princess Maki - Wrapped with soy paper, lightly battered and deep fried with unagi sauce. It was tasty enough and I should have stuck with this exclusively. Aside from the maki I also ordered the Spider Tempura, and Pork Katsu which came with Miso Soup. My friends ordered the Big Mountain Sake, beef teriyaki (appetizer), gyoza, and green tea/red bean mochi for dessert. We arrived starving, ready to eat everything. The Spider Tempura was edible but I realized it was a mistake when it tasted mostly like fried batter than anything resembling a crab in taste rather than appearance. The Pork Katsu again was hard to discern a taste other than fried, the sauce reminded me of A1 steak sauce. I couldn't finish it so I ate it the following day for lunch. As for my friend's beef teriyaki, it was such tough meat that the sauce could not penetrate it in anyway. It tasted dry and unappetizing.\\n\\nOverall the service was fine since we and another table were the only group in this small restaurant. The restroom was relatively clean, albeit a bit dark.

It was the most disorganized event I've ever seen - we got there pretty late and none of their VIP tables that were promised were ready; we waited 20 minutes before just putting a table together ourselves in the back of the room.  When we finally got some service, instead of the bottle of champagne and 2 bottles of hard liquor that were promised on the ticket, we got 3 bottles of champagne so we ended up having to BUY our own bottles, spending another few hundred on top of the already overpriced ticket. \\n\\nAs if that wasn't bad enough, one of my friends got kicked out because someone had told security that she was throwing up in the bathroom; not only were we devastated b/c this was our night to have a good time, having not seen each other in a few years, but my friend wasn't even sick at all!  She tried explaining (she wasn't even close to being sick and was one of the most INOFFENSIVE ppl at the club), we tried explaining that it must be a mistake but the bouncers would have none of it and kicked her out without even a jacket, cause it's not like it's freezing outside.  It was the most ridiculous thing ever, considering OUR NIGHT WAS RUINED FOR NO REASON AT ALL.  It's one thing if she was sick and they didn't want to jeopardize the mood but she was perfectly fine, just standing in the washroom waiting for our friend.  I have never dealt with tyrants who actually choose to be unreasonable because they can.

The restaurant has posted their menus for other occasions in the past, but not this time. I called the day before and the woman who answered said the menu was \\"similar to the regular one,\\" but no specifics. \\n\\nThe restaurant was very chic, it had a working fireplace, very clean, and very friendly staff. The menu was a 5 course meal. The recurring theme was lukewarm and mushy. We had a wine of merlot each.\\n\\nSashimi & Citrus: the presentation was great, but after having tasted this elsewhere (aka Deuxave), this was a bit of a let down. It was only decent after dunking it in the sauce they brought, something that tasted like soy sauce.\\n\\nNext, we got bread. At first I thought they were giving it to us because we barely touched the sashimi, but it turns out everyone got this. It was very good...especially when you're hungry.\\n\\nDashi: We got this interesting concoction that had a runny egg (they claim it was poached) and crunchy seaweed. The soup was lukewarm. I've never been a fan of soup when it gets cold, so I didn't eat much of this either. The flavor wasn't bad and I bet I would have liked it had it been hot.\\n\\nRoasted duck: It had a crispy outside and a rare center. After the sashimi and runny eggs, my stomach was looking forward to something cooked. And while the plate it was served on was warm, the food was cold. \\n\\nBlack amazake: I later learned this was a fermented rice pudding, it was served with blue cheese on top. The flavor wasn't bad, but again, lukewarm and like any other rice pudding also mushy. \\n\\nApple sorbet and bee pollen: a scoop of ice cream. Probably the best thing on their menu.\\n\\nTea & honey with milk custard: And we are back to another mushy food. Tasted good, but by now all I wanted to do was go home. \\n\\nIt pains me to have to give such a negative review to such a nice restaurant with a friendly staff, but no one should have to pay what we paid for what was served. My advice to them is to post their menu beforehand and to give some alternatives to the raw or rare dishes.

It encouraged on the website to make reservations.  When we walked in at 6:40 for our 7:00pm reservation we were the only ones there.  It was a Wednesday night so I can understand things might be a bit slow.\\n\\nWe sat down and as we were sitting the waitress proceeded to fill us in on all the food items she was out of.  One appetizer and one main course.  \\n\\nOk, so then we both love pinot noir so there was an Oregon version and a California version.  So, we opt for the Oregon version the waitress leaves to obtain it and returns only to tell us.  She's out of that too.\\n\\nWe get the California pinot which is good but left us both wondering about the Oregon pinot.\\n\\nWe ordered the Swiss cheese fondue.  It was very tasty but we weren't quite through with that when the main courses showed up.\\n\\nSo, we started eating.  It was very good.  The thing I didn't care for was the waitress would remove one plate if you were finished but maybe your dinner partner was not done so you sit there with no plate and the dining partner is still eating.  I think that is lop sided and somewhat 'not done' typically speaking.\\n\\nShe then listed verbally all the desserts.  I said \\"do you have all of those\\" she agreed that she did.\\n\\nWe settled on the chocolate fondue.  Having dripped most of the cheese from the aforementioned Swiss cheese fondue in my lap.  I figured what the heck.  Let's go for the chocolate. :)\\n\\nIt was tasty they served it up with apples, vanilla wafers (straight from the box-I chuckled) and lady fingers.  It was tasty and I managed to drip chocolate in my lap to go with the cheese. Heehee...\\n\\nIt was a good time and good atmosphere.  I rated it down because they were out of everything and the pacing of the meals, etc., needed work.\\n\\nThey do not punch your Entertainment card so that you can come back and use it.  So, that's a bonus if you carry the Entertainment card.\\n\\nI would probably try it again.  It wouldn't be the first thing on my list.

It's a sad day with the departure of Lovely Hula Hands.  Mississippi will miss it dearly.  Last night I went to Fifty-Fifty with a friend for some pizza, wine, and laughs.  Starting with the beer list, it was a little disappointing as there were no draft options.   The options that were available were a touch pricey.  I did like that they sold Laurelwood 22's, but for 8 bucks... That's a little much.  Maybe my price radar needs to be readjusted after being out of the country for a few weeks.  Thankfully on the wine side there was the carafe option.  Obviously we jumped all over this train.  Pretty decent stuff.  No complaints.  \\n\\nThere were some great options for pizza.  I went with the sopresatta with chilies and arugula.  It was good but super salty.  And I like salt, so this was even a shock.  My friend had the chanterelle mushroom with gremolata, which was also good but very salty.  We both agreed that it was the dough that almost tasted like a salt bagel.  The crust was decent, a little hearty which was nice, but still thin under the middle.  They aren't on the level of a Ken's or Gladstone's or Apizza Scholls.  That's not to say that they won't be.  But right now, it's just not there.  With the hefty price tag, I'd rather just venture down to Mississippi Pizza.  That being said, it does serve a purpose.  It's a nice restaurant that is very kid friendly.  And  I do love the idea of a farm fresh egg as a topping option.  We didn't go that route but I could see it being done and being done well.  \\n\\nFinally, we wrapped things up with two servings of ice cream.  The mint stracciatella and the chocolate.  The mint was hands down much better than the chocolate, but that might have been due to the lingering effects of the salty pizza.  Still, it's worth getting a scoop or two.  \\n\\nThree stars for the ice cream, salad and wine carafe option.  Two stars for the pizza and beer list.  Unfortunately, we came for the pizza and left a little disappointed."},{"name":"Ichiro Sushi","address":"538A Adams St","city":"Milton","stars":"4","text":"Always good food and great service.

There was a few managers on the floor but it seems that they were preoccupied with other things than making sure the customers are happy or satisfied since I don't recall any of them approached us and also our waitress never came to check on us after the food was brought up.

At 3pm on a Monday, my boyfriend and I dropped in and were seated within the first few minutes of standing around. Although, that was after we were asked to get up from the empty seats at the bar just to be re-seated there a minute later. So note to self: don't sit down anywhere unless the hostess or bartender allows you sit in that area. But in the end, the service was great and our bartender/waitress was awesome. \\n\\nI had a field day at the raw bar and tried almost everything on their list. My favorites were:\\n* Kumamoto - small oyster but don't underestimate how delicious these are. They're extremely plumped and super sweet, with a creaminess that just melts in your mouth. It's description says that the Kumamoto gives a honeydew melon finish and it does not disappoint. Hands down my favorite of the bunch.\\n* Kusshi - another oyster not to underestimate or overlook due to its size. The cucumber finish was immediate, and the description of \\"low salt and sweet\\" was defined correctly. \\n* Shrimp Cocktail - this was huge! It filled me up 100%. I didn't think the shrimp was as tender as others that I've had but it was SO HUGE, I am not holding anything against it.\\n* Jonah Crab Claws - MUST HAVE. I can't even put in words how delicious the claw was... it was just that wonderful!!\\n\\nI say skip the clams. Not worth it, and the littleneck clams taste so much better in a clam chowder, but not by itself.

It's kind of funny that the main street sign for the restaurant actually advertises that the place has breakfast tacos, not barbecue. The building itself looks pretty old to say the least. Anyways, the place was completely packed during our first visit at around noon. You can tell right away it's a restaurant that gets all of its business from regulars and word of mouth. Memorabilia from local high schools and community groups line the walls, and the interior is just as rustic as the outside. The menu is short and simple, and all of the plates average about $10-$11. I've tried the brisket and sausage plates so far, which come with the choice of coleslaw or potato salad, the choice of green beans, corn, or beans as your second side, and the usual free pairings like white bread, pickles, etc. If there's a line, it should go by pretty quickly. If you've ever been to Rudy's or a similar establishment, you'll know what to expect.\\n\\nAustin has more than enough barbecue joints, many of which are excellent. I would say the brisket and sausage are both just pretty good; that's probably the only compliment I can give the meats here. However, Vic's has a few other things going for it: the history and sense of community you'll immediately notice, an extremely friendly team, and probably the fastest barbecue experience you'll have around here. I've always loved hole in the walls. When you see a full house inside a pretty rundown spot, you immediately know there must be a reason why that's the case. Well, hopefully I'll get the chance to try some of their breakfast tacos one of these days. Otherwise, I'm sure I will be back for more barbecue during lunch as the weeks go by."},{"name":"The Thurman Cafe","address":"183 Thurman Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"It's pretty good.

I was hoping for some new interpretations of delicious southern food and was bummed to see something more akin to what you would eat at a picnic. We bought tixs for a Monday night dinner. I think it was $30 per person and included the following for our meal:\\n\\nCornbread- the bread was baked in a Madeline tin and unfortunately lost that soft center that would be there if cooked as a muffin. I also thought it was lacking that delicious sweet corn flavor that I love about cornbread. The ham accompanying the bread was too salty and the whole thing was a miss for me.\\n\\nSalad- iceberg lettuce with a buttermilk dressing. This felt like a very \\"I'm going to a picnic salad\\" and I think that's partly what was so disappointing. I liked the fresh radish, but the salad was super boring. Iceberg lettuce is the worst and there just wasn't enough flavor in the salad to make it interesting. The salad was also way too overdressed. \\n\\nThese were served together:\\nCollard greens- I liked the flavor, but there was nothing interesting about this dish. I would have loved to see a new interpretation of collard greens, while still preserving those great southern flavors.\\n\\nPimento mac and cheese- this was really delicious. Hard to eat for me as it was just too heavy for me, but I'm sure this would make any Southerner proud.\\n\\nFried chicken- this should have been the star of the show, but the batter was fairly flavorless. I liked it once I put some hot sauce on it, but I wish more spice and flavor were incorporated into the batter itself. The meat itself was very juicy and tender.\\n\\nDessert- banana pudding. this was my favorite. I've realized I really love banana pudding. I could have eaten a whole bowl of this. In fact I wish all the cream on top was replaced by more pudding. The pudding was just very tasty. I'm also not sure what to think of the crumbled nila wafers. I think they were store bought wafers and it really would have been so wonderful to have a small homemade cake (or maybe a homemade wafer) with that delicious pudding.\\n\\nAs far as logistics go, the pop up is in the back of Old Salt Marketplace. It's rather drafty in the room so bring a jacket. It's also BYOB which is awesome. You're warned to bring your own stemware if you don't want to drink out of small mason glasses.

That said, in this paritcular instance, I just don't understand the hype re: Neptune Oyster.  First, our party had to wait 3 to 4 hours on a Saturday night...beyond obnoxious.  It's a 38 seat restaurant, and the servers allow tables to linger until the patrons actually choose to get up.  If this is some kind of marketing ploy, fire your strategy agency because it only made me walk into the restaurant with a negative vibe.\\n\\nLet's move to the overall service after the 3-4 hour wait.  I was with a group of 4 that put it's name in at 6:15PM and was seated at 10PM.  Now, if I wasn't from out of town, I would have never stayed, but we had a gift certificate to use. Once we sat down, we ordered some beer and some wine, and then we ordered our meal.  8 different plates (including raw bar)...delivered in under 35 minutes total...with an average price of $25+ per plate, including appetizers.  Let me get this straight, you're gonna make me wait 3-4 hours to eat, and then try to rush me out in under and hour because your wait staff wants to go home at the end of the night?  Poor, poor form.  \\n\\nNow, the food.  Let's go 1 by 1 thru the dishes.  Blue Crab Cocktail...don't be fooled, it's a dip more than a crabmeat cocktail, which is what we were expecting.  The DIP, while tasty, was completely shredded and mixed with mayo, jalapeno, chive, and herbs.  While good, it was a dip, not a cocktail.  And for $24.95?  Pass. Enough said.  Dish 2...\\"made to order\\" Clam Chowder.  Really?  It arrived at the table within 90 seconds of ordering it.  And it was straight slop.  Heavy cream, which was not even closed to infused at all with the other ingredients.  The belly clams were quite tasty, but they were a standalone in the dish.  Everything was haphazard, nothing meshed, and the potatoes...what a total disaster.  The potatoes were hard.  Not crisp, really hard.  To the point of inedible.  Dish 3.  The fried belly (ipswich) clams.  Excellent.  Cooked perfectly, sweet, served with an excellent, spicy / lemon aioli.  Well executed.  Dish 4, raw bar.  Tough to screw this up as the chef can do nothing, other than to ensure the freshness of the fish and the temperature at which it's served.  Good on both counts, although the top necks that were shucked for me at the Farmer's Market outside the Union Oyster House yesterday were of better quality.  Meatier, more flavorful, same great temperature, and kept whole when shucked...sound crazy, but I am a clam connoisseur.    Fact.  Oysters (6 total, 3 West, 3 East Coast variety) well done.  Shrimp raw bar...overcooked to a rubbery consistency, plain and simple.  Terrible execution.  Dish 5 was the Yellowfin Tuna appetizer, which came out almost like a bruschetta...it was outstanding.  Yellowfin was a very high quality and portioned appropriately with the right amount of avocado as the other main ingredient in this dish.  Home run here.  Dish 6 was the Buttermilk JohnnyCake, which was sold to us by our waitress.  My reaction to this dish (and I like smoked fishes, caviar, etc)...what the f**k are you thinking?  Get this thing off the menu!!  It's basically a sweet cornmeal pancake w/ a slight balsamic glaze and a lump of smoked trout salad and sturgeon caviar on top.  First, the cornmeal pancake overpowers everything else in the dish.  Second, even if the trout salad and caviar could penetrate the ridiculous sweetness of the starch, there was nowhere near enough on the plate to offset the proportionally ridiculous size of the Johnnycake.  Fail, fail, fail.  Remove.\\n\\nLet's go to the 2 main courses.  Warm Lobster Roll.  Outstanding.  Cooked perfectly, great flavor, delicately separated meat, zero filler.  I'm more a cold lobster roll guy (with little to no filler), but this was outstanding.  Other main...Cippino, which was talked up by the waitress.  Only OK.  Good broth base, but zero seasoning.  The \\"saffron\\" rice was definitely in the long-grain category, but had zero saffron flavor...honestly, I'll point blank call the restaurant out here and tell them that I think they ran out of saffron and didn't use it.  Seafood was OK, nothing special.  Just a blah kind of dish, but what really rubbed me the wrong way was after ordering the dish, the waitress came back to the table and asked us if we wanted to \\"add\\" lobster to the dish.  We said no (because we were getting the lobster roll), and she kind of sighed and just walked away.  Everyone just looked at each other, and the expectation (true) was that the dish couldn't carry itself on its own.  Our suspicions were correct.  \\n\\nSo there you have it.  We heard great things and read great things about Neptune.  Sorry to say though, it is very overhyped from both a food execution and overall service standpoint.  Even if the wait was 30 min instead of 3-4 hours, I wouldn't return."},{"name":"Joey D's Oak Room","address":"1015 Crown Pointe Pkwy","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Went again for my birthday & great as ever.

However, we each decided to order separately, and the food came out a lot faster than expected. The bim bop with bacon and eggs (Korean dish) which is their twist of bibimbop. It was a bit salty, but very tasty as well. The dish consist of bean sprout, egg, kimchi, pork that tasted like bulgogi, and rice. The tasty steak and cheddar egg was the #1 dish.

However, I will draw the line at their \\"Joyscream\\" (dairy free) and \\"Nicescream\\" (vegan friendly) options -  as far as I'm concerned, removing the dairy from ice cream is tantamount to removing the bread from a sandwich. As I've said before, let's stop the insanity, folks. \\n\\nFood: As others have already noted, the ice cream at Jake's isn't as creamy as most people have come to expect for the dessert. However, it's still perfectly palatable and the flavor options are typically novel. The portions are also very generous relative to other ice creamery's in the area. During my last visit, I opted for the animal cracker, which consisted of vanilla ice cream with pieces of glazed animal crackers in it - overall, it was quite flavorful and a nice deviation from the standard options you typically find elsewhere. My only major complaint with Jake's is the lack of topping options - although I understand that most of the flavors are unique enough to stand on their own, it would be nice if they offered some toppings beyond the standard sprinkles and nuts. \\n\\nService: Friendly, but not the epitome of expedience. There usually only one staff member working, so the wait times can get long on weekends and periods of nice weather. However, both the staff and patrons typically handle the rush with relative stride. \\n\\nAtmosphere: The atmosphere of Jake's is really the only aspect that leaves somewhat to be desired. The Irwin St. Market itself is dilapidated and some of the seating appears as if it was just recently procured from a dumpster somewhere in Bankhead. I understand that it's part of the market's whole schtick, but from a sanitary standpoint, I'm not a fan. It's also usually hotter than hell in this place. \\n\\nCost: Reasonably priced. Two scoops of ice cream will cost you less than $5. Jake's also offers a fee-based membership program, which entitles the purchaser to various discounts, free toppings, and other special offers throughout the year. Credit cards are accepted. \\n\\nOther: Jake's ice cream is located in the front section of the Irwin Street Market, which is also conveniently located at the beginning (or end depending upon your perspective) of the Eastside Beltline trail. Free parking is available in the lot directly outside the market, as well as across the street in the unpaved lot at the corner of Irwin and Krog Streets.

When I heard about them I was just thinking your standard Ore-Ida middle school cafeteria tater tots, but they were done up well wish cheese sour cream and chives.  The fried pickles could have been a bit more crispy, maybe keep em in the fryer a bit longer next time.  The boneless wings were tiny but the flavors were good, we got samurai and cajun.  Cajun wins.  Seriously though, I would hesitate to even call them \\"wings\\".  I would describe them more accurately as tiny chicken cubes.  The 50 bones wings were ordered \\"hot\\" but believe me they were \\"not\\".  I had to douse them in Hooter's tableside hot sauce just to get a little heat into the mix.  The wings themselves weren't even as good as I remember.  Keep in mind it's been a good 5+ years since I've eaten Hooter's wings.   I think the last time was when they still had one on Friend St. near the Garden.  I didn't get any dessert but had a bite of my brother's key lime pie which was decent.  Very limey, but not my bag I guess.  \\n\\nI'll tell you one thing, they keep it like a MEAT LOCKER in there.  Wow!  I felt like hanging myself up on the coat rack like Carbone in Goodfellas.\\n\\nDo yourself a favor in the future and pay an extra buck to get all drumsticks if you get boned wings.  Also skip on the buffalo and get them cajun style."},{"name":"Commune Kitchen","address":"203A Broadway","city":"Arlington","stars":"4.5","text":"Excellent house salad & delicious pizza.

My server was a Vietnamese dude who was not at all interested in explaining dishes served there.  I asked what was in a vegetarian spring roll and he replied 'salad' without even looking in my direction.  I pressed further and he said 'vermicelli'.  The food came out fast, as would be expected for the dish I ordered - the standard pho noodle bowl.\\n\\nMidway through my meal, I unexpectedly hear a clack on my table.  I glanced up as I chewed off noodles still being consumed and see that the check has been placed on my table, without  my having asked for it, nor any indication that I might be in a hurry to leave, or even prompted by the server whether I might like anything else.\\n\\nAs I finished up the meal I placed my payment on the edge of the table along with a nearly empty cup of tea.  I slid the cup well beyond everything else on purpose as a last opportunity for the server to earn his tip.  Once payment was taken and change received, I finished off the last sip of tea and turned it upside down on top of the plate of bean sprouts.  Perhaps he might notice that he had failed to refill the tea even once.  The more likely scenario is that as he sat in an empty booth the check the latest updates on his phone, the busboy had already cleared it, and hopefully taken the $1 tip I left, as he clearly did more work than the server tonight.\\n\\n*Adding this several minutes after original post*\\nAfter leaving the establishment I went to a local bakery to pick up something sweet.  Had my tea been filled I would have ordered something at the restaurant to satisfy the sweet tooth.  Not to mention perhaps giving this place another chance.  But such will not be the case.\\nAlso note to my server, who would very likely know who I am if he reads this ... Tips are to be earned, not automatically expected.  Most restaurants would rebuke servers who sit in a booth fingering their phones during working hours, not to mention right next to diners who would see them doing it.  Some would even fire them outright.

This afternoon they were very busy with crowds ranging from a group of young college students chatting away with their sparkling wine and cheese and meat board to grandparents having a nice one on one lunch.  This place is very informal as you seat yourself and order at the bar.  Service was somewhat slow considering I was just a single diner.  I think it took about 20 to 30 minutes to get my sandwich.  A bit long despite how busy it was but nonetheless the sandwich was tasty and not too heavy.\\n\\nI would recommend giving the Cheese Bar a try if you like nice quality cheeses, meats, and great sandwiches.

Ordered two pizzas on a busy weekend with an understanding that it would take about an hour for delivery. I thought that artisan pizza was worth the wait and ordered a great deku and sturbuck. Both pizzas were mediocre. In fact, I am still wondering of how one can screw up a basic tomato mozzarella pizza...but here are some specifics:\\ncrust--dry cardboard, not chewy, super dry, and crumbled. Even the center of the pizza was not moist. When i took my first bite, it made a crunchy noise\\nred sauce--non existent on this pizza. It looked like someone just painted a crust with a brush\\ncheese-a bit of asiago, either forgot the mozzarella or had one piece spread per large pie\\nsturbuck pizza was better, but the beer dough was burnt on the bottom and bitter in flavor. Ham was a deli style--very thinly sliced pieces. I was hoping for more of a Nieman Ranch cubes. The ratio of pineapple to ham was off too. We ended up eating cheese and pineapple off the pizza and called it a night.\\nOverall, the unique concept, idea behind it, and creative names are cool, but it has to live up to its premise.

I'm talking about the meat, and the meat here is not up to even mediocre Southern standards. The pulled pork is dry and lacking in flavor. The sides are good but not that good, with typical Boston sausages, dry cornbread, and overcooked okra.

The Pork Belly was crispy but so tender it melts in your mouth and the beef rib was huge and delicious, served in a dark and subtle red wine reduction.

Chinese goods parading as Star Spangled.  \\nI waited at the bar for my guests to arrive and sat right by the service area.   Lots of joking around between the staff and very little customer interaction.  I now know the very intimate details of several employees lives. Yawn, man. Place was bustling but wholly inefficient which seems to be praised in that town.  20 minutes later I had a cocktail in hand.  Noticed one waitress in particular that got her cocktail before I got mine.  Not for her table, mind. Her cocktail.\\nWith our party complete we were sat and began ordering. After asking a few questions I quickly observed that the fare here is very-near-zero organic with a very organic pricing structure.  Whoever owns this place is running a business and there's a lot of wool over the eyes in regards to how things are presented and what the product actually is.  All said- I really like the way the food comes but calling it family style is misleading. Timing is erratic at best and only serves the dealer when taking convenience into account.   Seems like a way to absorb the shortcomings of the kitchen and waitstaff. \\nNow our waitress, who I had seen down at least one drink at the bar, was getting more and more friendly with my guests and didn't possess the tact to realize this was a working dinner.  Conversation was interrupted more times than I can count so she could crack a joke or interject some of the more free spirited bits of her personality. It was when she SAT DOWN AT THE TABLE that I lost my mind.  Now I understand that times are changing', that social niceties are being eroded on the daily, but I've already ordered $700 worth of dish and this is entirely not what I'm paying for.  I casually excuse myself and make for the hostess to speak to the manager, hoping I can salvage some of the time with my clients.  No dice, my waitress IS the manager.  The thorn in my side is both ruining my dinner and is running the Tasty show.  How can I take this place seriously when the woman who I could talk to to resolve this issue is also the central figure in my predicament? After a few unanswered calls and unreturned messages this is the only avenue I have to air grievance. Hopefully any one who's read this far can realize what a gamble it can be.  \\nFood tasted fine, unfortunately that's not all I expect when dining out."},{"name":"Jake's Ice Creams & Sorbets","address":"660 Irwin St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Disappointing experience.

Thumbs up for knowing how to treat your regulars, AC.]\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I discovered this place back when it was the Roadhouse - it was never crowded (unlike Publick House) and was a solid spot for a craft beer (the food, not so much). When it changed to American Craft we were happy to see that the beer selection was still a big part of the draw of the place, and the food had been upgraded as well.  We live within walking distance so it's quickly become a favorite neighborhood hangout, even though it's become quite a bit harder to get a seat at the bar since the reincarnation.\\n\\nA+ for beer selection, although if you're more into Belgians you'll have better luck with Publick House.  There's a nice range of things to suit anyone's taste from Wachusett Blueberry for your friend who isn't a big beer drinker to big imperial IPAs and stouts.  Definitely a great place for a beer geek - I love trying new beers every time I go.  Generally $5.75-6.75 for a draft...some may say it's a little pricey, but considering I know plenty of bars in Boston where you pay $5 for a Miller Lite, I really can't complain.\\n\\nIs it a bit overpriced? Yes. Like many people on here have said, the amount you have to pay for \\"extras\\" on a burger can quickly bump in up into the $18-20 range, which is a little ridiculous. Some of the sandwich options are a bit better, my boyfriend raved about the new short rib sandwich which was $12 - much more reasonable there. The chive fries with beer/blue cheese fondue are to DIE for - definitely not for those on a diet but absolutely delicious as an appetizer or bar food.    It sometimes seems like they're trying a little too hard with the food but I've never had a meal I really disliked, so there you go.\\n\\nThe service is definitely on the laid back side, if you're looking for a peppy server who's going to ask you how things are going every 2 minutes (I am not) you're not going to be a happy camper. I actually enjoyed being able to have a conversation for a bit before getting my meal - it seems so many places these days your food just flies out of the kitchen in 5 minutes and the whole thing feels completely rushed.

The place was pretty crowded with people all having a good time. \\n\\nThe staff were all very friendly in a comfortable not pushy way.  Our server was obviously well trained on the menu items and able to answer questions about the food. \\n\\nWe tried the following items:\\n--appetizer of \\"crispy\\" cheeses.  Enjoyable surprise, manchego cheese, I think, crispy on outside but not lots of breading, light honey/orange flavor.  We both liked this. I think about $7.\\n--assortment of olives for $3.  These were fine, although they were pretty cold and I prefer them closer to room temperature. \\n--corndogs, with I think shrimp maybe inside.  These were great!  Watch out though, the mustard sauce is spicy but they have regular mustard too. \\n--Husband had the \\"steak frites\\" for $19.  The steak was cooked to the right temperature and the fries were good.  We both decided the better value looked like the burger though for $10, which looked tasty and big. \\n\\nLimited desserts - some lemon curd thing, some butterscotch thingie and a cheesecake with chocolate sorbet.  Husband had the cheesecake and I had a few tastes - it was good.  Coffee also, which our server fresh brewed for me. \\n\\nThey served a carafe of ice water which was very nice. With just soft beverages, the total tab was just under $50.  The expected \\"book\\" of beverage offerings has no choice for those not wishing to imbibe but LOTS of options for the beer drinker.  One page of white wines, one page of red wines.  When I asked if they had anything interesting that was non-alcoholic, the answer was no (i.e., iced tea, soda, some juices).  \\n\\nService was friendly and reasonably good for a first night.  Iced tea glass was empty for quite awhile before we finally asked for a refill.  Since I ordered only the 2 appetizers, and my husband ordered one appetizer and a main course, it would have been better if the server asked when I wanted my food to arrive.  Without asking, my 2 appetizers came first, then his appetizer, then his main course.  If asked, I would have had my appetizers arrive at the same time as his main course so I didn't have to sit and watch as he devoured his steak.  \\n\\nManager stopped by, asked if we lived in the neighborhood, etc., but didn't really ask for any specific feedback on the food or service, although we politely said everything was great (which it was--any small issues identified here were small areas for improvement). \\n\\nThey posted their hours on Facebook:\\nMonday to Thursday: 11 AM to 2 AM. \\nFriday:  11 AM to 3 AM\\nSaturday: 5 PM to 3 AM\\nSunday: 5 PM to Midnight.\\n\\nThis place is  welcome addition to the neighborhood, adding to the options of Cypress Street and Escorpion, and definitely expanding the options available in the direct Tech Square area after 9 PM."},{"name":"City Barbeque","address":"2261 Stringtown Road","city":"Grove City","stars":"4.5","text":"Decent food for a chain.

My sister-in-law ordered a guava and cream cheese empanada. Seating is very limited, but they do have tables set up in the back of the building. We ate our meal at the back of the building. It was so funny, as we both took a bite of our tacos, we both commented, \\"That is delicious\\". We thoroughly enjoyed our tacos and then my sister-in-law shared her empanada with me. I have never had a guava and cream cheese empanada, let alone a hot one.  It was so yummy. We were also offered free chips and salsa, presumably as a grand opening special.  The parking is a challenge. There are three spaces in the front in about 10 in the back. But I did find, that I could park on the side street in the housing complex next door.

Fair enough. Tasty n Alder was by far our longest wait, clocking in at nearly two hours. While waiting we were able to walk to the Sunday market across town, come back, and do a sipping chocolate tasting nearby. No joke.

Our waitress was super friendly and explained the menu to us in great detail. We put our drink order in. By the time she came back to us to put our order in, our drinks hadn't arrived. She had forgotten to put them in. D'oh! Finally our drinks arrived. I ordered the Elizabeth Taylor. It was a gorgeous purple champagne cocktail. Really delicious.\\n\\nHere's what we orderd: \\n\\nChocolate potato donuts with cr√®me anglaise - these came high recommended by our server. I found them to underwhelming.

It came doused in manchego cheese, \\"six minute egg\\", and superb slabs of bacon.\\nPotatoes bravas with fried egg and aioli - I had read online that these were not to be missed. I did not enjoy these. I've had other versions of these dishes and prefer them to be much crispier. \\nHangtown fry - this came with fried oysters, bacon, and a buttermilk biscuit. The biscuit was great and flakey, but I found the remainder of the dish to be pretty flavorless.\\n\\nLooking back, it seems odd to me that the highlight of this brunch was salad.

I ordered off of the blue menu which was the specials or temporary one, I guess?  I got the Hummadilla for an appetizer, which was so amazing.  Like a quesadilla, but hummus instead of cheese.  I'm kind of hungover and it's two days later, so I can't really remember all of the stuff in it but my favorite ingredient that I could eat with anything - avocado - was included.  Awesome!  My husband even ate 1/2 of it and liked it, which was a shocker because he doesn't eat hummus.\\n\\nFor dinner, I got the Gorgonzola pasta with shrimp.  Huh-whoa!!  Lots of creamy Gorgonzola cheese, (Portabello?) mushrooms, red bell peppers and shrimp with buttery garlic toast.  I had to save 1/2 of mine, just couldn't eat it all.  But, I just had the leftovers (mmmmm...leftovers) right now and it was just as amazing reheated.\\n\\nMy husband got the super nachos with chicken and loved it.

We were told 45min but ended up being like almost double that, but we understood.  Small place that's really popular, it happens.  We ordered a hot lobster roll and the clam chowder.  The lobster rolls are so delicious and much better served hot instead of cold because to me,  I don't taste much of the lobster and instead mostly mayo.  So I 100% recommend getting a hot butter lobster roll if you are having trouble deciding with which to go with because it gives you a chance to enjoy and savor the luscious lobster meat! The clam chowder was also really good but it was just a bit too runny for me.  When I think of chowder,  I think thick and creamy and although it had great flavor and tender clams, just wasn't the consistency I desired. The reason I gave it 4 Stars was because since it's always packed, the door is constantly being left open with people waiting and It gets freezing while you're eating.  The waitress did her best to accommodate her tables as well as control the amount the door was being opened AND phone calling people to let them know there's a table ready.  She had way too much to do but she did great and had a really positive attitude and never once acted like she was getting overwhelmed. I wish I got her name to give a personal shout out!

One short skim through Yelp and it had been decided that we were going to the land of White Russians and wonderful profanity.  \\n\\nUpon walking up to the counter, and a healthy convincing of my buddy as to why it's okay to eat in a bowling alley, I say to the gentleman manning the grill, 'Word is y'all make a good burger.'  Without missing a beat and looking me dead in the eyes; he says, 'We have the best in town.'  That was enough for me.  I order the Walter, it's just as big as it's namesake, with tots and a Sweet Tea.  Wilford Brimley status sweet tea, but it was perfect.  We sat at the bar and between watching Law and Order and Shrek (they were on two tvs, but Law and Order and Shrek would be an amazing show) the door opens and two Mount Everests surrounded by tater tots walk through the door.\\n\\nThe only question I ask myself is how the hell do I attack this thing?  I finally found a suitable starting point to sink my teeth into, and I can tell you without a doubt that the burgersmith that made these towers of perfection is no liar.  Now I am into the whole brevity thing, which is my reviews tend to be better written than those stupid essays I had to write in school.  This burger was juicy, seasoned perfectly, and it had REAL BACON on it.  Bacon that had texture.  The bun was buttered and griddled which is the ONLY way to properly prepare a burger bun.  The tots were crispy and had the right amount of salt.  Even the queso was worth the trip alone.\\n\\nAfter polishing off this engineering marvel, I toss my plate away and give the most satisfied burger sigh that I've done in a very long time.  The guy behind the counter even remarked that he didn't even have to ask how I liked it.  The sigh was enough evidence.  Not only is the burger on point but the people run it are just as passionate about their craft as any chef that would be manning a Michelin star restaurant.  That's what I like to see in a burger place and we will be back.

There are two rooms.  The first one you enter hosts a 50ft long mahogany bar with booth, caf√© style, high table and bar dining.  All working in a beautiful vintage look harmony with each other to give that old Tavern feel.  No pomp and circumstance, just a good old (modern day) tavern.  \\n\\nWe arrived around 6.30pm on Thursday to an absolutely packed establishment and a long line waiting at the hosts table.  We put our name in and decided to head straight for the bar.  No room at the front bar but found standing room at the back area with a little more breathing room.  \\n\\nThe menu offers a selection of comfort foods with a twist, wood-fired pizzas, burgers and snacks if you just want a nibble of something.  They also offer a late-night menu until 2.00am.\\n\\nOur waitress came over and introduced herself; again there was a genuine smile for everyone.  I asked her what her favorite dish on the menu is and she said the Short Ribs and the Seared Scallops.  Not being a huge fan of red meat, I opted for the scallops and my friend, Kerry picked the Pumpkin Ravioli after a further recommendation from our waitress.\\n\\nBefore our entr√©es we started with the Tuna Tartare.  Mild and fresh tiny bites of tuna combined nicely with a crunch of not too sweet pear.  A sneaky little kick of paprika added something special and it tasted even better on the thinly sliced crustini.  This appetizer is perfect for sharing and very light. \\n\\nMy scallops arrived with divine aromas that made my mouth water.  Small seared slightly spiced scallops rested on creamy, beautifully whipped potatoes with crunchy green beans and sweetcorn, smattered with salty crumbled bacon.  This is an absolutely lovely dish.  I did try to avoid most of potatoes but it was so hard given how good (fattening) they are. \\n\\nI tried a taste of my friend's Pumpkin Ravioli and know it will definitely be on my must have list for my next visit.  Sweet pumpkin filled large pillows of nicely cooked pasta with a lovely marsala sauce.   \\n\\nTo our surprise an extra dish was brought out for us to try.  Rather than just a small taste each, I felt that we were given a full portion of the Short Ribs.  A nice surprise from the Chef.  I don't really eat red meat but I did try these short ribs, which were just falling off the bone succulent pieces of shredded meat. My friend thought they were amazing.  However the best part for me was without question the truffled mac and cheese, which had me at a loss for words, it was that good.  Definitely worth an order on its own. \\n\\nWe were checked in on often and always with a smile. When asked whether we wanted dessert, I almost laughed - we had eaten two entr√©es each!  There was seriously no more room to try anything else, especially not dessert so we just sat for a while enjoying another glass of wine while watching the new and loud Lincoln crowd.  \\n\\nWith the place being so packed and with very high ceilings and an open restaurant, it is very loud so you find yourself shouting in order to be heard.  There is also a problem with people banging into you while constantly trying to get past or just people leaning against your chair. This may be a back room problem only.  I had heard they are going to try and fix this by putting booths against the back wall (not 100% sure.)  I think the issue could easily be fixed with a low wall between the bar and restaurant similar to the front, although I am sure that is not the look and feel they want.  This is just a tiny complaint for a restaurant and bar I am so excited to have joined us in Southie and it will definitely not be long before I am going back and I am sure this is going to be one of my locals.\\n\\nAs it is still early and there is a huge buzz around Lincoln, I would suggest either going early or expecting a bit of wait both inside and outside, especially if you are arriving late.  We left around 9.30pm on Thursday and the line outside was a long one. I think being able to make reservations in advance would be a huge help to people being made to wait for long periods of time.\\n\\nDisclaimer...  Luckily for me (and I do feel very lucky), I recognized an old friend who very kindly introduced me to the new manager and we got a table in the bistro-styled back area very quickly.

(Sandwiches, Dessert, and Soup.)\\nThis review will be helpful for readers who have similar taste as me.\\n\\nI've been there around 10 times now. When I first went there i had The Crawford, because I like my sandwiches with avocados. So I order The Crawford most of the time. I tried their other Sandwiches such as The Irving, The Dana, The Kirkland, and The Broadway. It was ok. Their The Broadway would probably be my second favorite. However It seems more plain and simple that I feel like $9.80 was a bit over price compare to other sandwiches. \\n\\nTheir soup was ok. I had quite a few different kind, i'll say my fave amoung their soups is chicken noodle soup but it was ok. Some of you may like their other soup but for me I dont like. If you like chili you might like it but i am not a fan of chili. My type of soups are Cream of mushroom or corn, Broccoli cheddar, or New England Clam Cheddar...etc.\\n\\nI never had their coffees and other beverages. I am only there for the sandwiches.\\n\\nTheir Dessert have quite a nice look and it tastes not bad. I normally dont like sweet, the only sweets i ate is chocolate favorite such as chocolate cake, ice cream chocolate favorite, or somewhat close to chocolate like coffee favorite. I rarely get sweets and i get their sweet 3 out of 10 times which is a lot for me thanks to their good looks.\\n\\nAs for their service, well goods and bads.\\nThe good: They have a female server there with a dark frame glasses. She is always energetic and positive. Could be a bit clumsy times to times but overall a good customer service. She mostly work in the afternoon or evening time.\\nThe Bad: There is another female server who works in the morning shift. She has a long dirty blond hair with no glasses. At first she has good customer service. She smile and ask what she can get you. After your order and you paid that's when things got worst. There are a times when my food was ready and she totally ignored putting my food inside the bag. She just put the bag next to my food and walk away...\\nYou probably will say she is busy, but she is not. Even if she is that is part of her customer service. Maybe this is not big of deal to some of you and yes it is not until you are there. So basically after she took my $$ she just totally ignored me and not even bother bagging it, like i was invisible.(maybe becuz i didnt tipped her!?) I thought of not going there a few times and now i rarely go there since I'll probably getting The Crawford most of the time and you'll get tire of it after a while.\\n\\nOverall they have the ability to do great customer service, but they did good customer service. Sometimes decent and sometimes not so good. The food was alright but its on a bit pricey side for some food. Maybe a more variety of soup for more reason to go back. Also they can try to sell ice cream since the summer is coming. I mostly will go there for meal, but they only have sandwiches. If they can also sell some grill and fried stuffs that would be nice. But then again, they will probably need to acquire a new license(s) for that... They are mostly selling continental food.

There is typically a line just to speak to the hostess, but once you do, she will let you know the approx. wait time and take down your phone number to call when it's almost your turn. The call does not mean your table is ready immediately but gives you time to walk back in case you wandered off in North End. We arrived right after the restaurant opened and had a 45min wait time. The restaurant is very tiny so you will likely be elbow-to-elbow with the next table.\\n\\nObviously, you need to get the lobster roll! Neptune's is the first place I've gotten the choice of cold with mayo or hot with butter, and wow! I personally never loved lobster rolls before because of the mayo. The hot butter really brings out the flavor of the lobster meat, which is super fresh and really piled on the roll.

I would also say the same is true with their duck. I don't love their BBQ pork. I find it to be a little dry most of the time. I love all these meats over rice cause they put the sauce and scallion mix on top and it is soooo good. This is Chinese comfort food to me. I would advise getting these BBQ meats with their noodle soups because it gets soggy and the meats lose some of their flavor and all of it's crispness.

This restaurant has not really found it's identity yet.  I draw a parallel to a teenager.  Teenagers are great, but haven't quite figured out who the are or who they are going to grow up to be.   Upon walking in the place, it feels a little upscale.   When you head back to the bar you get a weird vibe.  It feels a little industrial with a twist of sports pub finished off with some blue collar charm.  This place is trying to cater to multiple demographics and in doing so struggles solidify any type of identity.  \\n\\nThe menu is not very inspired.   Standard appetizers, salads, pizzas, pastas, and a few steaks.  When looking at a menu, I always try to find a signature dish.  Something that pops and sets a restaurant apart from the rest, my reason for coming back a second time.   \\n\\nMy party decided to start with several appetizers and go from there.  We went with philly cheesesteak egg rolls, buffalo chicken dip, and potato skins.  To be clear, nothing was bad, but nothing was memorable.  We all agreed that we had much better versions of these apps at several other local restaurants.   Everything was bland and basic.  There was no experimentation with flavors which led to some boredom.   \\n\\nAfter being disappointed with appetizers, we decided to skip forward to dessert.  The turtle cheesecake was small and underwhelming.  The creme br√ªl√©e was basic and came with a few rotten blueberries.   The dessert course was similar the appetizers.  Very basic flavors without inspiration or excitement.  \\n\\nOverall, nothing was bad, but I am left with no reason to hold West End Grill above any of the other dozens of similar pubs and grills on the South Shore.   West End is new and still has time to grown up and decide if it wants to commit to being upscale or go the sports bar route.  Above all, they have an opportunity to experiment with the menu and create some excitement in Randolph.  The last thing Randolph needs is another uninspired pub.   Time to find yourself West End Grill.   \\n\\nOn the plus side, our waitress was friendly and very prompt.   She kept our drinks full and offered some great conversation.

The menu is tapas style so you really need 2 dishes per person to feel full. I had the salmon, tilapia, brussel sprouts, and mouclade all of which were delicious albeit in small portions. The sauce in the mouclade was so good would it have killed them to throw in a few more potatoes and carrots? While the food is delicious, it was quite agonizing to get the food one dish at a time. The meal ended up taking 2 hours! I guess this is nice if you want to soak in the ambience and enjoy your time, but when the dishes are so small and you're hungry, it can get a little frustrating. On top of that, there's only street parking, which depending on the time could be difficult in Winter Park.

The average wait time is 1.5-2 hours consistently. Put your name down at 3:30pm, walk around North End, get some dessert at Mike's Pastry, go shopping at Faneuil Hall (it's not too far of a walk), then come back just in time for dinner. \\n\\nDisregard the fact that the lobster roll is $27 - you get an amazing portion of lobster. I split it with a friend, and this was more than enough for me. Freshest lobster you've ever tasted, covered in hot butter and laid in a crunchy roll. Every piece was gigantic!\\n\\nI also dunno what the heck johnnycakes are still, but it was the next best thing there. A hot honey pancake with smoked trout on top. The taste was amazing! It's really hard to describe but the flavors mixed so well together.\\n\\nOysters were the freshest I've had and were on par with the ones I've had in San Francisco.

It took over 45 minutes and multiple phone calls to settle everything.  \\n\\nTo my own fault, I did not specify that I was paying with a credit card when on the phone so the driver just left the food with us and told me that Lilly's would call the next day for payment...except they didn't.  I called multiple times over the next few weeks to not only get a receipt for our order (never received it) but to actually pay them.  As a result of all of the chaos about the meeting and poor delivery execution, the owner did extend a generous discount to my office.\\n\\nThe food and portions, in my opinion, were average.  We ordered pasta, chicken, and broccoli and a tray of salad.  The bread was plain white, Italian bread.  It was soft, but as bland as it could come.  The pasta was slightly cheesy, and had a proportionate amount of chicken and broccoli in it.  Thankfully they did not skimp there.

My trip to Boston was shorter than I would have liked it to be, but before I left I was on a mission to have the lobster roll at Neptune Oyster.\\n\\nMy last few hours before I boarded my plane back to Los Angeles, I made my way to North End.  Upon entering the restaurant, I noticed the charm and appeal that it had right away, but it was smaller than I thought it would be.  That being said, I was very glad to come by during lunch and not dinner like I previously planned.  I later found out that there was a two hour wait for dinner the night that I wanted to go.  By the way, they do not take reservations so keep that in mind.  Lunch time at Neptune Oyster has a manageable number of people coming through, so you don't have to wait long at all.\\n\\nIn any case, I sat down at the counter and was immediately greeted by the friendly wait staff.  I was given a menu and asked if I'd like anything to drink.  That's when I noticed that they have mircobrewed beers on tap.  I then said to the bartender that I'd like to order the Maine Lobster Roll with fries and asked if I could sample the beer.  She put in the order and gave me my samples.  The beers were good, and they would've gone well with my meal, but I ended up getting the Guinness.  I made the right choice because it was the perfect drink to wash down my amazing lobster roll.\\n\\nThis meal was my last in Boston, and it was my absolute favorite of all that I tried in the city.  They serve the lobster roll on a toasted brioche bun with the option of hot with butter or cold with mayo.  I got it hot.  This is one of the many times I wish the internet could allow us to taste and smell what we see in pictures because I do not have the ability to convey how much flavor this lobster roll gives off.  On top of that, they are no where near stingy with the portions of lobster.  I was full well before I got to the end, but that didn't stop me from polishing off the whole thing.  I do have to mention that the lobster roll is priced at $27, but it is well worth the price.  Additionally, the fries were a good compliment to the roll, but the next time I go I will be asking them to make it a little crispier.  All in all, go to Neptune Oyster.  It's worth the trip.

So even though I was ordering the crab benedict, I could basically be ordering two crab cakes, two eggs, a side, and some hollandaise sauce on the side. So I asked if I could have one of the crab benedict served normal and the other one could be separate. And that's what I did. My hubby ordered one of the specials, a 3-egg omelette crab florentine. It didn't take long for the food to arrive and it looked and tasted marvelous. \\n\\nThe entire brunch was fabulous. Our waitress was very attentive and so nice.

Having a black American man serving us Mexican food made me a little apprehensive about authenticity, but overall, everyone was pleased with their food.\\n\\nThe downside is the price.  For half the price, you can eat the same thing and get free chips and salsa all over town.

The lobster roll looked like your normal lobster roll with big chunks of meat inside and a buttery roll for the outside.

Finally, when I asked for the fourth time, a young chef came, and listened to my comments in a rush, and gave me a full priced check. Tbh, the Macdonald's I had later that night was even better!\\nMe and my boyfriend went there for new year's eve and was very unsatisfied with the restaurant. We posted both on google map and on yelp. On google map, because the owner can reply to the review, he/she posted that we wrote fake reviews and we've never been there.

I guess everyone has different taste and there are clearly many raving Revolution fans.  I'm just not one of them.  The yeast doughnuts are not my taste at all.  Big, kind of bready, no real flavor.  The cinnamon sugar one reminded me of some weird cross between bread and a marshmallow Peep (which I hate).  I tried a bite of 3 kinds of yeast doughnuts and felt the same about all.  The cake style was closer to my liking but still, still just blah and way too sweet for me.  \\n\\nMaybe it's familiarity, maybe my doughnut palate isn't that sophisticated (though I have had a few from sublime that I loved) but for my money, I'll take Dunkin Donuts anytime.\\n\\nThe store is very cute.

They either give you too much food or not enough. Unfortunately the ones that don't give you enough food usually charge 2-3 times the money, which doesn't make any sense at all. On the contrary local Portland restaurants usually do a good job with delivering excellent food, and just the right portions at a reasonable price. \\n\\nFratelli's has good food, but gets the portion and price wrong. Actually I wouldn't even mind paying a little more for the food here if they would just give you enough to eat.

The cocktails were refreshing and made us all happy. Our server was very knowledgeable of the items on the menu and came to refill our water glasses frequently. Empty dishes were also cleared out almost immediately too.

Our friends told us about their experiences, which included having the owner approach their table to suggest menu items, to describe the meticulous approach to making each item in-house and to share stories of Oviedo history.  We were thankful to have the same experience.  The owner and his wife were very pleasant.  Their descriptions of the menu items lived up to the hype.  I had the tuna steak, which was marinated and seared as they prepare their steaks.  The marinade is to die for!  My wife had grilled mahi-mahi, which she loved.  They offered us a sample of the seafood bisque, which was also amazing and featured large chunks of lobster.  Every detail was worth raving about.  The array of menu items will surely keep us coming back.\\n\\nOn this visit, we ordered the \\"King of Oviedo\\" dessert, which lived up to the name.  For just under $7, we enjoyed a fried pastry, topped with a large scoop of fried vanilla ice cream, garnished with mounds of whipped cream, almost 1/4 cup of cinnamon, and streaks of honey glaze.  This dessert could easily have satisfied 4 guests.  I challenge someone to invite me to try a dessert that would compete for this title! \\n\\nI plan to frequent Jesup Bay.

It was the place to go when there was nothing else to do, whether you were hungry or not. \\n\\nI went through a phase (freshman-sophomore year of college at OSU) where I wouldn't dare set foot in the old Dube, too paranoid of running into people I no longer talked to since starting college. I knew they were in there, along with all the memories and sillinesses of all the time I'd spent there. \\n\\nEventually, I came back to the Dube, both with old friends and new. It never really changes, although the new jukebox is certainly a hideous travesty, and the smoking ban made it less of a health hazard (sadly.)\\n\\nThe food is good. I have honestly never eaten anything bad here and I have been hundreds of times. It's pretty standard bar/diner food but it's really not overly greasy and there's a wide variety of comfort food--you should really try their lentil soup and their chicken pita if you want something healthier. You can, of course, always count on decent coffee, spicy curly fries, a great turkey burger, chicken fingers, or just a piece of pie with ice cream. \\n\\nDelicious....ridiculous......totally necessary. Always full of hipsters and the mirrors on the walls make it possible to check yourself out at the same time you check out everyone else.

I love the whole farm to table approach and local farming. It does get crazy busy on the weekend so I would suggest going during the week. Or be prepared for a long wait (45-1 hour). Cocktails are good here as well and pretty reasonably priced, love the bloody mary. We did visit very recently during their \\"bar only\\" hours. We sat at a table at the bar and ordered drinks but were undecided on food due to lack of veggie options.

Well, you haven't lived until you try a burger from Thurman's. Seriously, OMG, they are amazing. Not only are they huge, but they are delicious.\\n\\nFirst I'll talk about the burgers. They look as if it takes a whole cow to make them. They are as big as your head. Or bigger. For me, they are at least two meals worth of burger. If you can eat a whole thing, congratulations.\\n\\nThey are high-quality burgers, and while they're greasy, they aren't greasy in a cheap way. And the toppings! Each burger option comes with all kinds of fixins so you won't be bored. The A-1 burger is the first thing I tried. The burger itself is cooked in A-1 sauce (and yes, you get to choose how you want your burger cooked) and it's topped with lettuce, onions, tomatoes, and swiss cheese. And those onion straws. Heavenly. Heart-attacky, but heavenly.\\n\\nBut my favorite burger in the world, not just at Thurmans, but ever, is their Bacon Cheddar Ranch Burger. Seriously, I love them so much but my heart hurts after eating one. Imagine if you will: A think juicy burger, smothered in melted cheddar cheese, topped with lettuce, tomato, onion and bacon! And then, of course, smothered in ranch dressing. But that's not all! This particular burger comes with a side (a very plentiful helping, by the way) of those onion straws I love so much. Did I mention they give you a lot of onion straws? Most burgers come with chips, but I love this one so much because I can't get enough of those thin, crispy onion straws!\\n\\nI am not a fan of Thurman's fries. They don't really have a lot of flavor and there really isn't anything special about them, and they are more like potato wedges than fries. Nothing compares to those onion straws for me. \\n\\nThurman's is great because they are so cheap! Their burgers range from $7-9, and considering the portion size, that's pretty amazing.\\n\\nI've experienced Thurman's two different ways: dining in and carryout.  I gotta tell you, go with the carryout option! The dining area in there is tiny, and I'm talking small, and the place has always been packed when I've been there. The last time we ate there we waited for over 2 hours. It turned out to be an all day affair. I mean, the food was worth it, but why wait when you can just pick it up and go home? Plus, when you're eating those things you kinda just wanna spread out and give yourself some breathing room. It takes some effort to eat those things. And the restaurant is cramped and busy and you don't feel like you can stick your elbows out without bumping into a server running by. \\n\\nWe didn't find the server we had to be too friendly, either. Granted it's probably stressful to work in such cramped quarters, but we were cranky from waiting for so long and it rubbed us the wrong way. Our server was even a bit rude while getting us the check, but we were on a burger high, so it wasn't a huge deal.\\n\\nThurman's fit a full bar in there, somehow, and it's kind of neat to look at the decor. Random signs and messages cover the place, even the ceiling. And behind the bar is a collection of dollar bills with messages on them covering the wall. They must have figured that if you have to wait hours to eat, they might as well give you something to look at. Much appreciated.\\n\\nBut carryout rocks. That way you get the phenomenal food without the wait. Parking is street parking, not too hard to find something pretty close by. It's a pretty neat location, tucked away in German Village. I wish I'd known about it a long time ago. Honestly, I don't know how everyone isn't raving about these burgers all the time. They are famous, I guess. Damn. Now I want a burger. \\n\\nAlso, be warned that the buns cannot contain the awesomeness that is a burger from Thurman's. You will get messy. You will have food on your face. You will struggle to consume it. So don't wear nice clothes and maybe consider getting carryout if you're worried about shame, so at least that way no one can see you try to scarf one of these babies down. It's not pretty. I suggest wearing sweats. That way your stomach can comfortably expand to contain the burger and no big deal if you make a huge mess of yourself. You will feel very fat after eating here. Thurman's is not for the faint of stomach."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Certainly renown for it's seafood, but I declare the Neptune Burger is the best in the Commonwealth.

The beer selection is top notch and it's always fun to go in and see what's new on tap. I'm a big IPA and stout fan and they almost always have something I haven't tried. \\nWhenever I have friends up from home, they demand to go to Redbones. While southerners may complain it's not authentic BBQ, when pressed I'm sure they'll agree it's the best around. When having a full meal I'll usually go with one of the sandwiches, pulled pork and brisket being favorites (comes with your choice of BBQ sauces: hot, mild, sweet, or vinegar). The sausage and catfish are solid as well. As for lighter fare, I love the fried pickles and jalapenos; introduced a year or two ago, they've improved by being thicker cut. The mac 'n' cheese is satisfying if not outstanding and anything drenched in their hedonistically buttery buffalo sauce gets an A+ (especially the shrimp).\\n\\nAlthough it tends to get really busy on weekends, the food comes out amazingly fast and the complimentary cornbread is a tasty starter.

Even better because it comes with a bar, a bartender, cooks and a hostess. How much more does a girl need?\\n\\nAnother Glowbal Group incarnation, one of the older ones, depends on your definition of older, older than Coast and Black and Blue, younger than Glowbal and Sanafir.\\n\\nI started going to Italian Kitchen when my life was dedicated to silly, shallow pursuits like invite only cocktail parties and events hosted by Mercedes Benz where no one gave a damn about you, just what you were wearing and that you noticed them. This lifestyle is still very prevalent in Vancouver and thankfully it did not last long for me and I managed to save my soul from irreparable degradation and come out with some great outfits.\\n\\nItalian Kitchen is still the spawn of this but by nature of having gone there in its heyday I have a fond spot for the place, the pasta, the meatballs, the bar and the staff. \\n\\nI always have the meatballs, its a de riguer starter with a bottle of wine. You can order the meatballs individually, I am not sure that's stated on the menu, but you can. Their wine is best by the bottle not the glass, and best in the $80 range. Yes, ouch, sorry, but if you can afford to eat at IT you can afford $80 in wine.\\n\\nThe truffled pasta and meatballs is sinfully rich and tasty, one cannot go wrong with truffle, cream and cheese in your pasta. Well, your arteries can go very wrong, so just wash it down with that $80 bottle of wine. The ragu is also excellent if you feel like a triple bypass could wait a few more years. Carbonara... oh my decadent carbonara, no need to say more, just eat it. I am also a fan of their prawn pasta, sans the capers and it seems of late they've thrown in olives too, which I also want to remove. However, my partner thinks this dish is \\"bleh\\", so maybe stick to the heart stopping dishes.\\n\\nTheir meats, I see a lot of people order them, and when I have come with a group of red meat hungry men, invariably there is a platter of dead meat on the table. I find all their meat salty. Having sat at the bar, I know why, the chefs throw that salt around like its DDT in a mosquito infested swamp in the Amazon. If you're heart's going to go, may as well salt up the blood pressure to go along with it, go big or go home! All of the above mean, I say pass on the bloody salty cow.\\n\\nThe bar, I love the bar. I've sat at the tables above and below. If you're with a big group and you're making all the noise its fun, if you're a twosome you can't hear yourself think, let alone talk. Though, if you go back to paragraph one, if you're only there for your outfit and make up to be seen and not heard, hurrah, you're good. I prefer the downstairs to the upstairs for noise volume but it does depend on what day of the week you're there and how busy they are.\\n\\nBTW, unless you are Vancouver royalty you aren't getting in on Friday or Saturday without a reservation or an extended wait. Or, your name is in the computer as a VIP, which happens after you have dined there so many times and you get flagged in their system. Lesson to be learned, always make a reservation so you got bonus points in becoming a VIP.\\n\\nService, I have heard good and bad, I have only had good but it may be that I've been there enough to be familiar. They have always gone above and beyond as well as stayed late to fuel our late night pasta and wine binges. Aaaahh, we always drop a big load of cash and a substantial tip so that may have something to do with it.\\n\\nTheir desserts are OK, I love dessert and I can actually pass on theirs. I adore tiramisu and I can pass on theirs. It's good, just not amazing enough after a carb and alcohol load to find the 4th stomach to kick in the diabetes.\\n\\nAmbiance, trendy. You can dress up if you want. I wouldn't show up in shorts and a t-shirt you might have a long wait. I think the ambiance plays a large part of why I am there, coupled with the service. You won't find the Godfather in here for authentic Italian but when all aspects come together, it's a good place to call my kitchen.

I had a great experience with them the first time. The second time, I almost died due to a lack of care, intelligence and complete irresponsibility. I'm not sure how many times I have to tell someone that I am SEVERELY allergic to eggs and nuts for them to actually understand that. I ordered food on UberEats last night from Teji's and they called to let me know that something I ordered, they were out of. So, as I'm trying to figure out what to replace the missing item with, I mentioned to not one, but TWO different employees that I am severely allergic to both eggs and nuts and to replace my missing item with something that does NOT contain either ingredients. I told both of them this exact thing probably 3 or 4 times each, thinking, I've mentioned this enough so this shouldn't be a problem. Well, it was obviously not enough. I received my food, looked great, had two bites of it and instantly knew something was wrong. Long story short, I spent all last night trying to keep myself alive since I had just ingested the flaming death of me. I was legitimately terrified as my entire mouth was so swollen it looked like I had gotten punched in the face by a UFC fighter and my throat so swollen that I sounded like a 70 year old who has smoked their entire life. Needless to say, I did not have a very good time last night and the restaurant refuses to own up to this, which is absolute bullshit.

We ordered the several orders of the tonkotsu ramen, spicy tuna crunch roll, tempura shrimp roll and an assorted sashimi platter amongst ourselves.  Let me first say that the tonkotsu broth and egg noodles were nothing short of spectacular.  However, the amount of actual pork they gave us left a lot to be desired.  The menu said that the ramen is supposed to come with an egg as well, but all we got was a ton of noodles and about 3 small pieces of pork each.  Really disappointed with that since it was about 13 dollars for a bowl of ramen.  The sushi was disappointing to say the least...the rice was soggy and the spicy tuna was not fresh.  The sashimi platter was decent with the exception of the salmon which wasn't fresh either.

They use dark meat chicken and it was chewy and fatty and I felt kind of ripped off that I paid that much for dark meat chicken. If they switched to white meat I would feel very differently.\\nI also don't each much red meat so I though about getting vegetarian, but instead of doing something like fajita veggies, they offer this really gross sounding vegan ham. I wouldn't even want real ham.\\nNext were the toppings. The veggies were very good and I must compliment on that. I really like Thai Basil which I was surprised to be offered.\\nI also had a problem with the sauces. It is always nice to have a variety of sauce options. However, all of the sauces were pretty spicy. I thought there should have been a few different options that were less spicy.\\nSo all in all, I think with a few minor changes Phat Wraps could be a pretty decent place. Their green initiative is nice, but they need to put a little more thought into the main options (steak, chicken, vegan ham).

There's no question what your getting with each oyster type as the ordering sheet gives an excellent description of each flavor profile.  Their mignonette was an excellent accompaniment to wash them down.\\n\\nIf there was one food experience you shouldn't miss in Boston it's this hot lobster roll.  This thing deserves 6 stars, maybe even 7!  The roll is generously buttered and tossed on the grill to get those nice grill marks and then overloaded with a heaping pile of sweet, buttery local lobster.  I'm sure the seafood pastas they serve are delicious, but I'm not interested.  At a pricey $27, you might scoff and say it's just a sandwich.  After you eat it you'll be willing to pay more.\\n\\nI will certainly be back!"},{"name":"SuperChefs Breakfast & More","address":"199 E Broad St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"The HULK was just soooo INCREDIBLE!

We walked in, didn't see a hostess, and the bartender told us we could sit anywhere and someone would help us. So we sat outside, and the minutes ticked by. After 15-20 of no acknowledgement, we flagged a waitress down - I hate when you have to resort to that. She said she'd get us menus,  take our drink orders and get our real waitress - who had been within a few feet of us serving another table but had never seemed to notice we were there. False promises, bartender.\\n\\nAnyway, one of my friends ordered a Makers 46. The gal returned several minutes later to say they had just run out. So he ordered a Basil Hayden. She returned several minutes later, sheepishly, to say that they were out of that too. It was ridiculous. So he settled on Makers Mark, which the actually did have. \\n\\nOur actual waitress was nice.  I do give her props for giving some tips, like when my friend wanted to order the chicken soup, she said, \\"Customers have been complaining today that is way too salty today.\\" A little weird, but appreciated. She wasn't very attentive though - we ran out of waters, had to ask for enough silverware (the first gal brought us 2 sets for 5 people...), and one beer my boyfriend ordered never arrived. The food took FOREVER - we were starving and asked a few times to make sure it was actually coming.\\n\\nThe most hilarious incident when was my friend who wanted the chicken soup, who had a cold, tried to order some hot tea. The first girl seemed confused by this - \\"Like, tea with no ice in it?\\" We tried to explain more and crossed our fingers. No one was surprised when she brought a glass of iced tea with no ice. We confirmed with our waitress that they don't serve \\"like a hot-cup-of-tea tea.\\"\\n\\nFinally, there was an error on the bill - I knew I'd have to check it after all the shenanigans and sure enough, there was an extra charge. So we had to send it back and get a new one. Oddly, this place requires an 18% gratuity for parties of 5 or more - usually it's 6.\\n\\nThe only saving graces were that the food was pretty good (I got the Surfer Girl taco special), and the outdoor seating area has a cool ambiance with a giant TV (comprised of several screens). This place is super close so I'd like for it to be good, so I'll give it just one more chance."},{"name":"Pita Int","address":"6720 Perimeter Loop Rd","city":"Dublin","stars":"4.5","text":"Update: Have gone back a few times, because it's my closest (by far) option for this type of food. Now 4 stars, because I feel like I just ate my redemption meal. Lots of veggies, super crispy non-oily falafel...soooo good. AND I realized you can get a half hummus/half rice bowl. Game-changer! Can't give 5 stars yet though, because I've now had 1 terrible, 4-5 okay, and just 1 awesome meal, so not sure about the consistency. Might just depend on the day and person prepping it? And also, prices still seem high. Newest pics were $10.50 each. \\n\\n\\n8 months prior: Very oily--rice, toppings, and falafel. Also, DON'T call in orders. They put less than a teaspoon of garlic sauce on my entire rice bowl and the veggies were minimal. Did not make it seem worth the price at all. When I ordered in person previously it was much better in terms of the amount of toppings and sauces (still oily), but don't think I will be back, which is sad, because I absolutely LOVE Naf Naf Grill (similar concept) and was hoping this would fill a void, since I do not live close to a Naf Naf.

This is one of our regular haunt and with good reason, kinda Teak-lite for Northwest Orlando."},{"name":"Bistro 2110 At the Blackwell","address":"2110 Tuttle Park Pl","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"So the food isn't bad, the service was ok but the prices are high even for hotel fine dining. One thing I really did not like when I visited here the first time is they gave me the menu for the student dining plan. They assumed because I was young that I was a student and not someone who was just staying in the hotel. Second issue is they placed me in the tightest corner booth they could cram me in and refused to move me even though there were only 3 groups in there. Again I think this is because they assumed I would be young and rowdy. Not a great place but not horrible either. Could use some customer service improvements but it wasn't bad."},{"name":"Luke's Lobster Back Bay","address":"75 Exeter Street","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Overpriced!!!!!!!!!!

It was our first time at our restaurant and it really was quite enjoyable! Mr. Favelli was quite gracious and it obviously runs in the family as Christian his son is just as charming! The service we had was top notch - we ordered a round of drinks all which were quite nice. We had champagne with our starters and then onto Barolo for the mains. Wine list is quite diverse and is quite good...starters were all very good - had the carpaccio, mushroom with goat cheese, and calamari. The calamari was not fried but was grilled and in a wonderful pesto sauce! Very good! Carpaccio was so tasty - I could have had 3 orders of it myself! For dinner we had mushroom soup which was fantastic, duck breast which was good but was slightly overdone for my taste. I would actually get it again but would be clear on how I like it! Dover sole was excellent - my husband got that and he loved it - I stole a few bites from him! he had a side of pasta which I had a few bites and it was very nice - as expected! One of our friends is vegetarian and lactose intolerant and they were very accommodating - she loved her dish!  We did not stay for dessert as we had to be somewhere afterwards. \\n\\nA few things to note - they have a small bar which is nice. It is in the basement of a condo - which is probably why we have not been there before. Northern Italian influence. Crowd is slightly older and there seems to be a lot of regulars. We were there really early - 5:30 pm - and it was pretty empty but was full by 6:30!!

Just two years ago my sister and I really enjoyed the Rose & Crown but this time............. Because I was dining alone I was treated to a nasty little corner table out of range of the outdoor fans. I made a few simple tweaks to my order: salmon with carrots and mashed potatoes. (Same thing two years prior, mind you.) What came out IN A BOWL was a scoop of old, cubed carrots clearly scraped from the bottom of a metal cafeteria pan, tasteless texturally bland mashed potatoes and a blush-tinted portion of salmon the size of a toddler's fist. And not a large toddler either. It was clear the salmon hadn't been seared but I hoped for the best. And was quickly punished for my optimism by the sight of shiny, slimy fish flesh. Reminded me of my former employment at the Florida Correctional Institution. Can't quite remember why.  On one of her fly-bys, I asked the server 'Kitty' for the check. She hadn't had time to ask whether the meal was satisfactory. Or palatable. Or apt to test my reverse gag reflex later that evening. She confidently whisked the barely modified 'food' back to the kitchen and brought the check. I paid it. Yes, there was a moderate tip. And on the way out, I asked to speak to a manager. What I got was Cinderella. From Norway. (I'm not kidding. That's what was on the nametag.) Cinderella assured me that she checks every entree before it goes out. Uh-huh. Cinderella also assured me that every piece of salmon is cooked 'medium.' Well, not this one. She offered me dessert. She offered me a drink to go. Very possibly the 'to go' part was the one she was hoping I'd agree to. And speedily. We compromised by agreeing that when I returned, she would comp the meal.  (Just so's you know, I took the long way around and went to the food court at The Land where I dined cheerfully and happily on lean and tasty pork tenderloin, fresh green beans and the same mashed potatoes, except these weren't cold. And the meal was a third of the cost.)  Oh, and I'll update this review when I return to the Rose and Crown for my promised free meal. If Cinderella's word is of similar quality to her culinary output; I'll probably get the boot."},{"name":"Not Your Average Joe's","address":"109 Chapel St","city":"Needham","stars":"3","text":"Just an average typical american restaurant.

Between the four of us we ordered a couple banh mis, a couple vermicelli bowls, bubble tea, and I had some goi cuon (rice paper wraps).  The first thing we noticed is how utterly rude the person who took our order was.  You place your order at the front before you sit down.  We didn't realize it was cash only and when I took out a credit card she looked at me like I was an idiot.  I think nicely saying, \\"I'm sorry but we are cash only\\" would have been the more acceptable route.  She also gave my boyfriend a total and when he took out cash, she changed the total.  He was like, what?  You just said something else.  She kind of gave him a surly look and said I forgot to charge you for the xyz.  There are much better ways to go about this.  Oh I'm sorry, I forgot to charge you for your bubble tea, the total is actually....  Not act like it was our fault for not knowing you made the mistake.\\n\\nThe next thing we noticed is that stuff was dirty.  The table, the water jugs.  I was thinking, if the stuff that is out for people to see is dirty, what must the kitchen look like?  We ate our food and I had no complaints.  It was reasonably priced.  But honestly, with other options, why would anyone choose to go somewhere that they are treated like the dirt on the water jug?

This is were the seed of my love of pho was planted and began to flourish.  Stick with me while a talk about pho first and then I will get on to my latest bowl, this morning at Pho Pasteur.  Please keep in mind I'm a white boy from Idaho and my pho experience is limited but growing.\\n\\nThere is nothing in the world like pho broth, nothing.  The rich beefy stock with aromatic sweet spice of star anise, cinnamon and others is ambrosia to me.  I know that's a bit romantic and over indulgent but it's just so damn good.  Add the basil, some sriracha, and a drop or two of hoisin, oh, and fish sauce if you like, it makes every inch of my body smile.  No matter how you like it, with raw sirloin, beef tendon, meatballs (a must), or tripe, they only compliment the foundation and that is the broth.\\n\\nNow, onto Pho Pasteur, since it is the first place I entered the world of pho and vietnamese food, it has a special place in my heart.  It is always busy so I feel comfortable that there is a decent turnover of ingredients which equals fresh.  The atmosphere is very stark and the service is institutional, but I don't go to places like this for impeccable service.  I want a hot, fresh decent bowl of pho quick and that is what you get at Pho Pasteur.  \\n\\nThe broth is ok.  It's flavorful, seasoned right ( not too salty) but a bit muddy.  I have since had some fantastic pho elsewhere where the broth is rich and full like a good homemade stock should be.  Pho Pasteur's lacks this fullness and so it is just ok.  The vermicelli are tender, the basil and sprouts are quite fresh, and the tray of condiments are what one would expect in a decent Vietnamese Restaurant.\\n\\nThis is my go to place whenever I have a layover in Boston and judging by the popularity, most people are satisfied."},{"name":"Philly Connection","address":"2980 Cobb Pkwy, Ste 200","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"**ALERT** If you are expecting a \\"PHILLY CHEESESTAKE\\" just because its in the name you are a twit, its the name of the sandwich for christs sake!

At least on the weekends there are two places to order, the express line and the regular line.  Unfortunately when things are busy it is impossible to determine which line is which.  Then when you add in the people waiting for their orders, things become a bit of a mess.\\n\\nSpeaking of waiting, that is one of my biggest frustrations.  While the coffees come out quickly, the food is terribly slow!  What takes 15 minutes for a toasted bagel, I'll never know (the cream cheese isn't even on it!  It comes on the side!).  \\n\\nI've learned that there is generally a limit of one order per person.  When I go with the lady-friend and we order together, we've not once had the order completed 100% correctly.  Either the cream cheese is wrong, the bagel is poppy instead of sesame, one order forgotten, etc.  It's turned into sort of a game at this point:  what will go wrong this time?  We finally took to ordering separately, and things got much better.\\n\\nThe food is tasty, of course -- that's the only reason I've continued to go back.  The bagels are good, the sandwiches are pretty rockin'.

Honestly, I've been dying to eat here on a Sunday for a few years now and was so excited to finally try a gluten free buffet. Where else can you find that?? But I must say their execution was quite poor? Or underwhelming maybe? When I first went to the counter of all the food, I was so ecstatic. Gluten free french toast??! YES please. Gluten free biscuits? Yes please! Gluten free fried Chicken?? Yes please!! and it goes on as my eyes became wider at each selection. Of course I filled my plate. \\n\\nBut at the first bite of the french toast, it was cold - quite chewy/dense - and wayyy too sweet. Fried chicken was the same, cold - chew - seasoning/batter was bland. The rest was either meh or okay. Biscuits were good with gravy (but i like mine with jam/jelly - which they didn't have) . But hey I haven't had a biscuit in years so that was like omg-let-me-stuff-my-face. Their migas was quite good but drenched in what looked like nacho cheese (but if ur lactose intolerant - u might want to hold urself back). And strangely enough they had bbq pork ribs next to the migas LOL. And that was good even though it was cold. No vegetable dishes at all. The only dessert they had was a bowl of melon variety - (was hoping they'd sample some of their well known baked goods , ya know what i mean? like why not??) \\n\\nMy main problem other than feeling underwhelmed with presentation (cold food - not quite a workable selection of brunch food - there was no bacon!) and taste, was that there was no labeling of the food! As a 100% gfree establishment , there's gonna be many patrons with other dietary restrictions, so you really gotta let us know what is in what! And not sure if there were those heater candle things underneath but maybe you guys should have a real buffet heater bar? Food was soooo cold. And the french toast! that made me mad the most b/c i love french toast, and i never get to eat it! I think they used some sort of cake batter, but not their own slices of bread they sell?? It just felt so dense. OH wait I guess the other thing that made me mad was the price! for two of us with tax/tip, we spent around $35+? AND had NO IDEA the buffet came with free OJ/Mimosa or Coffee! Server never told us. I didn't even know until I read some of the reviews on yelp. We j ust ended getting water. I kind of regretted it after the end of my 1.5 plate meal.

The atmosphere in the restaurant is lovely, and the employees are always friendly and knowledgeable regarding ingredients. \\n\\nI would also like to say a huge thank you to Jenn, for allowing me to customize my bowl with half portions of certain items and providing impeccable customer service. \\n\\nFor the bases, I love the sweet potato noodles and cauliflower potato mash! It is like thanksgiving in a bowl. For the veggies, the mushrooms are my absolute favorite! I swear they taste like heaven. I also enjoy the roasted sweet potatoes. As for vegan proteins, they only offer tofu and it is very flavorful. Sometimes I heat my bowl up since the noodles and tofu are chilled and the food tastes great both warm and cool. They also offer two vegan sauces, the coconut sriracha and the balsamic vinaigrette. The balsamic is a bit too tangy for me so I always go for the coconut sriracha. My one complaint is that they are often out of this, which leaves me with a sauceless bowl (or with a sauce I don't love so much). \\n\\nMy non-vegan mom has accompanied me to FK a few times and is now a huge fan as well! She loves the noodles and mash, the barbecue chicken, tuna poke, parmesan broccoli, and the roasted mushrooms. She also loves the ginger sauce! Claims it's one of the best dressings she has ever had!

Most of these seem to be about Sound Table as a restaurant, or as a bar - so let me add one about Sound Table as a dance/DJ spot. \\n\\nFirst, let me say The Sound Table, like other spots in Old Fourth Ward, is cool because of the mix of people. Black, white, some in their 40s like me, many in their 20s, hipster, frat/sorority, office friends blowing off steam, a good mix. It's a tiny dance space, which makes it hard to truly dance much - mostly just a groove-in-your-spot. But that adds to the charm of the place because it's hard to get into your own corner there; you're kinda forced to mix and mingle, which is pretty cool. \\n\\nDJ Kemit does a great job with his set, blending mostly 60s-80s soul, all on vinyl 45s, with just a little non-soul mixed in. He's got crowd-pleasers like some Prince, Earth Wind & Fire and James Brown mixed in with more obscure stuff. (My favorite tidbit in the mix tonight was about 45 seconds of the great old Otis Redding/Carla Thomas track, \\"Tramp\\" - that brought a smile to my face mixed in briefly amidst the more standard, bass-thumping dance fare). \\n\\nI had a fun time and felt plenty comfortable there and in the neighborhood, despite what other reviewers have written about the sketchiness. It def is sketchy, but it's OK. Just be alert, know what you're doing, and you'll be fine. A recommended venue, and a recommended DJ set."},{"name":"RusTeak Restaurant & Wine Bar","address":"1568 Maguire Rd","city":"Ocoee","stars":"4","text":"Fantastic start with a huge drop in service towards the end (lunch).

Since I'm aware of the situation and I actually anticipate it, it's now a form of entertainment for me. But if you don't approach it that way, you may find yourself annoyed there. Recent examples:\\n\\n-I was at the bar. A gentleman sitting near me at the bar politely asked the bartender if they could put the baseball game on. The bartender said they would ask their manager. About ten minutes passed with no baseball game put on and no comment from the bartender. The customer then politely asked a second bartender if they could put the baseball game on. The second bartender said they would. Another ten minutes passed without the channel being changed. The customer then asked the original bartender for the check. While the bartender was off producing the check, I asked the customer \\"didn't two different staff members tell you they would put the baseball game on for you?\\" and he replied \\"yeah, that's why I'm leaving.\\"\\n\\n-I was at a table. A server basically stormed up to me and slammed down the water I had requested (after waiting ten minutes for someone to take my drink order), almost spilling it, then stormed off in a hurry while another customer a table over said \\"excuse me, could you do me a favour?\\" I laughed and said \\"apparently not.\\" The other customer and his friend left shortly thereafter.\\n\\nIn both instances the place was quite dead, so it was not an issue of them being overwhelmed.

I have eaten here numerous times in the past year or two and one of my favorite things has been the appetizer mussels. However, at my most recent visit, the mussels were different and somewhat disappointing. I think the mussels were larger in size and definitely smaller in terms of overall portion size. Possibly related to the larger size, the mussels also tasted much fishier and chewier than I remember in the past. We only ate about half of them when usually we devour them in minutes. One of my favorite entrees is the braised short rib with the truffle Mac and cheese. I ordered this dish and again it was more disappointing than I had remembered in the past. The meat was very fatty and chewy. The truffle Mac and cheese was just as good as ever. The rest of our groups entrees (salmon quinoa bowel and burger) were absolutely delicious.

Larrison, Bug Salad and I met at Cuatros at 24th and San Gabriel.  Larrison had good things to say about the food, and she said it was cheap, so I was psyched.\\n\\nI arrive at Cuatros a little after Larrison and Bug Salad, so they have already gotten drinks.  We sit and wait 20 minutes (seriously) before the manager walks by and realizes we have not been serviced.  A waitress begrudgingly comes over and takes my drink order and our food order (as we've spent 20 minutes staring at the menu) and disappears.\\n\\nI get my soda in good order, but the waitress informs us they are out of the fried pickle appetizer we ordered.  No problem, we'll take chips and salsa instead.  Our dinner comes out about 10 minutes later, minus the two orders of sweet potato fries.  We mention this to our waitress, and it quickly becomes evident she forgot to order them.\\n\\nFive or 10 minutes later the fries come out, and the waitress gives us this terrible lie about how they said they were out when she placed the original order, but when we said they were missing she went and checked again and found some.  A New Year's Day miracle!  The only problem was that she forgot the dipping sauce that goes with the fries.  She comes back two minutes later with one teeny tiny cup of sauce.  For three people with two orders of fries.  We let it slide.\\n\\nEverything is going well now that we have all our food when Bug Salad notices something in her salad.  You guessed it...a bug!  A big fat antennae-having bug covered in ranch dressing.  This beast clearly did not land on her salad at some point during the meal.  It was disgusting.  If I had been eating it, I might've thrown up at this point.\\n\\nNaturally, our waitress is nowhere to be found.  We grab a different waitress and point out the bug in the salad.  She grabs the plate without saying a word and disappears into the kitchen.  No, \\"I'm so sorry!\\" or \\"We'll fix this right away!\\"  Nothing.  She reappears a few minutes later and walks right past our table without saying anything.\\n\\nFinally, the manager comes to our table.  He apologizes profusely, comps our whole bill, and mentions the restaurant's health department rating (97/100).  We are happy again at this point, and go back to our meal (looking more closely this time).  The bad news is, Bug Salad never received a new salad.  She hadn't even eaten half of the original one.  It was also like pulling teeth to get any attention from our waitress once the bill had been comped.  We were becoming unhappy again.\\n\\nAs we are getting ready to leave, our waitress appears out of nowhere and asks if we'd like to see our bill, even though it was comped.  Yes, she was hinting that we should still tip her appropriately for her horrible service.  We decline to see the bill, but still left a few dollars on the table out of courtesy.\\n\\nNeedless to say, I don't think I will be going there again.  It would've been one thing if the service had been terrible and there was no bug in the salad, or if the service was excellent and there was a bug in the salad, but the combination was just too much for me.\\"\\n\\nTwo stars instead of one because they attempted to resolve the issue, but continued to treat us like second class citizens."},{"name":"Stanford's Clackamas","address":"8416 SE Sunnyside Rd","city":"Clackamas","stars":"3","text":"This place has gone way down hill!

They have been SO incredibly wonderful to me as I've been ordering 2 over-easy eggs, and they make it for me EACH time I ask  (the Allston Cafe people told me I could only order that when it's not busy....) but now that they got this new 'egg mixture' for the scrambled eggs, I'm afraid they'll do away with the REAL eggs.
