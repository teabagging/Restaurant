Tell them what you like and your price point and they usually come in under on the price and bring you something amazing you would've never though of ordering.

The building is historically relevant as it was John Hancock's  old office on the water AND still contains his safe as well!  The building still has much of what would match that time, but elegantly modern as well with great light fixtures, dim & romantic lighting, and neat artifacts!  It is quite a site to behold.  The patio seating is a plus too, once its summer.\\n\\nNow the food.  Honestly, the menu offerings aren't terribly high in price....but we of course were there for restaurant week so the general price of 38 bucks for 3 courses was what we went for....and it was absolutely perfect.  Seriously not a damn flaw.  We started with a perfect cup of clam chowder, about the size you'd get in any other restaurant for about 5 bucks....and it was damn good too, made a run for other's money in the city of the best clam chowder available.  The Wine list was impressive if you were looking for bottles...but the glass offerings still seem disappointing by comparison....then you have to remember all restaurants do this to ya....anyways, the pinot Noir I had was out of this world for 9 bucks...better than ones I've had one and a half times that price....so also a plus.\\n\\nNow the main courses....the waiter suggested the Shrimp tossed on angel hair, among a baked fish, a flavorful chicken my girlfriend got, and a Prime Rib.....Not sure how any good red-blooded American would deny the Prime Rib....so order it I did, and medium rare at that.  Well it came out promptly after we finished our chowder with a few minutes to digest and it was PERFECT.  Medium rare...not medium, not rare, MEDIUM rare.  Perfect to a T.  flavorful garlic Mashed potatoes with the skins still in it, and the steak juice to dip it in.  My perfect meal combination was just completed.\\n\\nBut no, we still had dessert coming!  We chose opposite dishes to try together, being the Mini godiva lava cake and Mudpie, respectively.  The only flaw may be my lava cake was just tiny by comparison to the pie.....but it was damn good so it made up for it.

I find that it's not too busy either--many times, good restaurants are filled with people lining up, but I have never had to wait for more than 5 minutes for a table at Gami. I'm guessing it's because they are in a more hidden location, and that they haven't been around for too long as well.

Even with the knowledge though, you will most definitely have more troubles finding parking when you arrive. Situated in the midst of an open air plaza with a poorly designed one-way ridden parking lot, high traffic is part of the price you'll be paying for dinner.\\n \\nThe glossy, book of a menu features appetizers, salads featuring meats and exotic fruits, pho, bun (rice noodles), rices, as well as hearty family style mains. Despite there being a \\"vegetarian\\" section, many of the options here come with meat/seafood or at least their sauces. The fried tofu, rather than being crunchy on the outside, is served age dashi-like, extremely soft in the centre and delicately coated in crumbs. The spicy stir fried noodles, which is very much like a pad thai, is fully flavourful and extremely generously portioned. Baked oysters in garlic sauce come attached to their own half shells. A fruit shake is a thick and creamy must to wash (or push, rather) everything down with. \\n\\nThe space is surprisingly large and consistently filled with mostly Chinoise families. The seating options range from spacious booths to large round tables for parties of 8 or even more cozily. There are many places in and around the city to get better pho, but if you've got a big group in tow, West Lake is a cheap and cheerful place to try a bit of everything family style .

What makes this one the winner is their golden broth. In the world of pho the best broth wins and at Pho Jasmine this honey colored tonic gets its flavor from the savory tones of chicken (simmering bones again) and copious amounts of garlic. The result is a rich yet not stringent broth that leaves your breath smelling sweet instead of harsh. The other thing that makes this pho stand out is their use of thinly sliced breast meat to top their gorgeous broth and delicate rice noodles. Most pho ga can be found swimming with dark thigh meat or a hodge podge of what fell off the bone when cooking the broth- not so at Pho Jasmine it's nothing but juicy, lean white meat.\\n\\nOther stand-outs on their menu (which includes a variety of Chinese stir fry and tasty salt and peppered squid and shrimp) are the veggie pho (fresh veggies steamed to perfection floating in a super flavorful broth with tofu), a seafood version and the ultimate, My Tho Special, a Seafood and Chicken combo which uses the same dreamy chicken broth and is loaded with plenty of tasty calamari, shrimp, chicken, and slices of fish cake- Yum!

(Mac and cheese was on point...I refuse to say fleek)  \\n\\nLet's just say if I hadn't paid the extra $1.50 for loaded, I would have been seriously ticked off and asked if it was an appetizer.  I don't consider paying $9.75 for 2-3oz of meat acceptable for anything other than an app!

I tried a piece and it reminded me of those turkey loaves.  Not bad, just not what I expected.  The yeast roll was excellent though.  He got a slice of carrot cake and I tried a bite and it just tasted like spice cake mix, which I love but again, not a stand out.  I could tell he was eating it because he paid for it... no sinking back in the chair in ecstacy experience for him.

It wasn't until the day before we were to leave did I randomly check to see if we could get something and we did, at 11:00 pm! Our waiter, he was probably the best part of the experience. He was very nice and other than a little slow with refills, he was great. The food.... we had the deluxe plan so we had some great meals all week, until we got here. It was so disappointing because it wasn't even as half as good as places like Cinderella's Castle, The Brown Derby (Hollywood Studios), and Coral Reef Restaurant (Epcot). I had the French Onion Soup, Sauteed Shrimp and Scallops, and The Grey Stuff (I will get to that later). My husband had The Assorted Cured Meats and Sausages, Roasted Lamb Chop, and the Strawberry Cream Cheese Cupcake. All of the food (apps and entrees) was merely okay... nothing fantastic and that would make the hassle of getting the reservations and meal worth it. The Grey Stuff was the metaphoric cherry on top of this feast of disappointment. I understand that they need to make a lot of them so they do not run out because that would probably ruin some princess's experience but all the grey stuff was is a VERY STALE BROWNIE WITH NOT THAT GREAT OF FROSTING (like part butter cream and part whip cream)...

I guess if really pressed, I could probably guess it would have a seafood slant and I'd probably be kinda thinking of Venetian/northern Italian style seafood tapas places (think Pesce in San Francisco).\\n\\nThe artisnal, crafted with love salumi craze is showcased here but i have seen enuf of that (sorry fra mani) so went strait to the Frico Caldo ($7) for starters--it was like the most decadent butterylicious latke ever and was great with the 1/2 glass of brut (so so).   At this point, I'm thinking of my girlfriend who told me that eating here was not an over the top rich make me feel sick later experience and wondering if she misheard me when i said where I was dining.\\n\\nMoved onto Primi (i wish they'd lose the little speach about how many courses one should order)....had 1 crudo, which changes I believe but on this day was Japanese yellowtail w/fennel, okra and horseradish ($12).

The tiny diced yukon potatoes, anchovies and parmesan vinaigrette made me see ahi in a whole new light.  \\n\\nOK, the crudo was great too - maybe the best dish of the night; it did taste like something right from Cyrus.  Since I love that restaurant, that's not a bad thing.\\n\\nThanks again to the same friend who said \\"without fail, get 2 things: whatever crudo is on the menu and a chocolate dessert\\".\\n\\nSeeing that we'd finished our 1/2 glass of champs and kept glancing over at the bottle of red that awaited us when our entrees arrived (we can't drink that with crudo, right?  nah, we can't), uber manager comes over and super tactfully, asks us if we'd like for him to split a glass of Soave to enjoy w/the fish course.  Appropriate Soave / Ruiniti (no, that's not the same wine but they are both reminiscent of white men with afros circa 1978) jokes follow, and we then agreed to and thoroughly enjoyed what was more like 2+ glasses in a carafe of the creamy white.\\n\\nSecondis were the house made tagliatelle with veal sausage and tomato sauce ($21) and the Cappone Breast (de-sexed rooster, in Italian) w/creamy farro and kale ($26).  Tagliatelle, A+, Cappone, B- and mostly cause the farro and juices were so good.  Oh well, always a risk w/poultry.  I'd never had a Wapsie and figured this was my chance.\\n\\nA service note that actually kicked off the evening on a high note....the menu indicates that only 21 orders of the pasta are available each night.  Upon hearing us talk about how good it sounded, uber manager, again, with perfect timing (vs. creepy eavesdropping), inquired \\"would you like for me to ask the kitchen to hold an order for you? what is your name?\\".  Awesome. \\n\\nI'd add the hand made pasta to my friends reco list....so that's crudo, pasta and a chocolate dessert.\\n\\nWith our mains, we had a really nice bottle of modestly priced tuscan red -  2000 Carpineto Vino Nobile di Montepulciano.  It was $52 (just under 2x retail-fair IMO) and the somm recommended it over a bottle $25 more.\\n\\nDessert...................maybe for the first time, i had little interest in the cheese course - not that I didn't order it anyway (service note: no explanation of the cheeses--definitely an oversight) - b/c the chocolate milkshake (really, mousse) with little chocolate balls that came with the warm chocolate cake was one of the best things I've come across in a long long time.\\n\\nOur tab was $200 for 2, 3 full courses plus 1 extra.  That soave?  zip.  thank you uber manager.  that was not necessary but much appreciated.  I know this is one of the more expensive restaurants in boulder but I gotta tell you, it seemed like a very fair deal indeed. Furthermore, I can see grabbing seats at the bar (be European-dine at 10 pm) for pasta, a glass of wine and leaving for much less, still happy.\\n\\nOh yeah, that uber manager turned out to be the co-owner.  I am guessing he makes everyone feel like the most important customer that night, as he did us.

Since it was our first time visiting this restaurant, we were given free samples of the homemade sauces and meats on the menu. Plus, we received complimentary chips and salsa as soon as we were seated at our table. Not only is the customer service excellent, but the menu offers a wide selection of different Mexican and vegetarian dishes at reasonable prices.

This place is TINY. If you like to stretch out and put your feet up on the seats, forget about it. I'm going to crush your dreams of laying spread-eagle across an entire table while you eat your biscuit concoction into the dust. You will be lucky to find a chair, but you might be better off eating your meal in the car so the entirety of Portland doesn't see your O face. One other potential downside (if you're lame) is that everything on the menu is made of biscuits. If you don't like biscuits, you should walk, not run away from this place. Actually, you should probably just walk off the planet, because life isn't worth living without a healthy love of biscuits. The word's in the name - if you don't want a biscuit, don't go here.\\nThe d√©cor in Pine State is... piney. There's a big old blackboard at the front of the restaurant announcing the delicious biscuity fare, and a counter where you order your food. There is a table, or maybe two, and a small counter at the back. That's about it. The atmosphere is sparse, but the flavors are big.\\nAnd really, with flavors so epic, we didn't mind cramming ourselves into the tiny counter seats to wolf down our food. It' hard not to, everything we ordered was top quality. You can tell the folks at Pine State put love and care into their food. From the compostable \\"corn cups\\" to the flavorful sweet tea, every part of the meal felt like someone who knew what they were doing really gave a crap about what was being sent out. It's a good feeling.\\n\\nThe portions at Pine State are ample, and the prices are tiny. Abbe and I got so hungry while writing this review that we started to leave to go there, only to find out that this leavened heaven is only open until 2 on weekdays, though the Alberta location does have late night hours on weekends.

This is definitely a step-up from the standard Peets/Star*ucks Corporate Coffee Mindfuck that we know and hate in this area. \\n\\nThey have been too timid to really make the transition to a real Euro-style cafe.  Art is important. One of my favorite cafes in Berlin which has a suitably upmarket feel has a fresco of some monkey fucking a person in one corner of the cafe (or is it the other way around?). This little demented touch is not really for the patrons. Clearly someone sometime thought it would be cool to put a fucking monkey on a wall. Patrons be damned. Now I am not suggesting Harvard Square is ready for zoophilia, but could we go a little beyond the Starbucks coffee safe corporate culture photos on the wall to perhaps make a more personal touch in this place? The upstairs feels much worse, and not comfortable at all.\\n\\nThe furniture has the same feel. Cheap, semi-IKEA. It's not the sort of stuff I would want in my house, so why would I feel at home in the this cafe? \\n\\nThe food looks potentially good (not sure about portion sizes) so that's definitely a plus.

I'm really glad we did!\\n\\nAs a midwestern transplant who grew up eating awesome Mexican in Las Vegas I jump on every new place with the potential to satisfy my never-ending craving for the good stuff. And now, at 8 months pregnant, my desperation has reached near-epic levels... so much so that even a restaurant named after the most boring city in California piqued my interest. (Seriously guys? Bakersfield? What were you trying to evoke, middle-of-nowhere-dullsville?)  \\n\\nI found the environment simple and attractive, though I could see how it might get cramped at night/ on the weekends/ as a bar. Luckily we were there for lunch on a Sunday, so we avoided the problems mentioned by other Yelpers. Got a table right away, service was great, and there was no line for the bathroom (very important when there's a baby squashing your bladder). Sadly, margaritas are a no-go for the next few months, but they looked soooo good. Isn't that always how it works when you can't have something?? They did have grapefruit Jarritos, so that was some small compensation. (The beer selection was pretty good too, fyi.)\\n\\nWe started with the chips and guac, and while I usually don't care for the chunky-style, this was so tasty that I didn't mind. The flavor was excellent- fresh and bright- and the chips were warm, crispy and perfectly salty. I tend to push all the onion bits to the side when I eat guac (annoying, I know), so perhaps the chunkiness just made it easier to dig them out? In any case, I kept mixing it with the (delicious) salsas- a roja and a verde- and could have happily enjoyed a meal of just chips and guac. But then I would have missed the excellent tacos!\\n\\nBetween three of us we ordered at least one of each type of taco, and I tried all of them. The tortillas were spot-on-- perfect flavor, perfect texture. They should use two per taco, though, so they don't bust open. Five of the eight tacos had to be eaten with forks or fingers off the platter because the torts had split. A bit of advice for those who are not fans of raw onions: don't avoid the pickled red onions! The taste and texture is nothing like you expect. They're softer, sweeter, and a little tart-- lacking the sharp pungency and crunchy bug-like texture of raw white onions. I had to talk my daughter into trying them, but she agreed they were a nice contrast with the rich flavor of the mole.\\n\\nHere's my taco ranking, in order of tastiness:\\n\\nRajas-- Classic after-school-snack taco. It's hard to go wrong with chilies and cheese. I put extra of the roja salsa on this, and ordered a second one. I love me some poblanos. \\n\\nFish-- Crispy fish, yummy sauce, and made even better with added salsa and guac. The slaw was pretty wet, and the tortilla was sopped through, but it was otherwise delicious... and made with cabbage! Fish tacos are a favorite of mine, but 9 out of 10 restaurants screw them up. Mayo? Soggy fish? Iceberg lettuce?? Boo! But Bakersfield did fish tacos justice-- they tasted like Baja.\\n\\nShort Rib-- These lived up to the hype for me. Moist, tender meat with excellent flavor. I skipped the raw onions and asked for extra radish (for crunch). Adding jalapenos would have made this even better.\\n\\nCochinita Pibil-- I suspect this one is delicious with the habanero salsa... but I had to skip it, sigh. The pork was moist, with a nice grassy flavor and a strong hit of achiote. In fact, the pork was so good I think this taco would be best with minimal toppings. Just meat and cheese, or just meat and salsa, to let the pork and spices shine. Maybe the pork on a tostada with some lime crema?\\n\\nMole-- I love all varieties of Oaxacan mole, and this did have a nice flavor, but it was missing something. Depth? Heat? Richness? I think that (since Bakersfield seemed to be aiming for authenticity) I was hoping for something closer to a rojo or chichilo mole, and got the more common (in the states) and sweeter negro mole. My daughter really liked it, though, and if I had been able to load it up with the \\"house pickled jalapenos\\" it probably would have moved up to third. \\n\\nPastor-- The pork was very good, but I skipped the raw onions and I think that threw off the balance of flavors. The pineapple sweetness needed something to push against. Again, jalapenos would have helped. Darn preggo heartburn!\\n\\nPollo Roja-- This one was just ok for me, but hubby and daughter loved it. The guajillo salsa was yummy (and if I had tried this taco first I would have asked for extra for the fish taco). But the chicken was kinda dry and didn't have much flavor.\\n\\nHuitlacoche-- Not bad, but not awesome either. Needed a lot of salsa, or maybe more poblano, to amp up the flavor. It makes a pretty decent vegetarian option, but I would opt for the Rajas over this one every time."},{"name":"Sugidama Soba & Izakaya","address":"260 Elm St, Ste 106","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"I was very unimpressed with all the choices that we chose on the menu.

Nothing special.\\nYakitori - All the yakitoris were seasoned okay but were not hot.

They provided you a pho size bowl of dipping sauce (really salty) for very little soba.  There was only a few pieces of duck.  I was very surprised when this dish came out because many restaurants I've been to had cold soba with a cold temp sauce.  It isn't cold soba anymore if you are dipping into hot temp sauce.  The difference between cold and hot soba is having them put the soba into the sauce.

I ordered the grilled cheese (again, how do you screw up grilled cheese) which came out so oily I felt like I was eating the cast of Jersey Shore... it had a decent flavor but was not nearly worth the $14 it costs (once I was charged $4 to add cheese to my tots... came out with all sorts of crap I didn't order placed on top as well)... point being; if you like beer AND BEER ONLY... and will not need a snack or helpful wait person... this place is for you.

None of these places offer anything you wouldn't find in a Beaverton Winco for deep discount.\\n\\nWorld Foods sets itself apart. It is neither stymied by the fear of the mundane, it offers your expected selection of chips and essentials, eliminating the need to label it a \\"specialty foods store\\".

In my review of the latter, my main gripe about AD (Delk Road) was the inability of the proprietors to get the sanitation grade to an A. Thinking last night would be different, we sat out in the pouring GA rain on our quest for some great wings.  Finding American Deli still sitting at a B grade, we decided to try out a new player on the block.\\n\\nIn N Out Wings is located next door to the Delk Road Kroger, in the same plaza as Little Ceasar's (yuck!) Still a little disappointed by AD's inability to raise their scores, I wasn't expecting much. When I was walked into the neon-lit, immaculately clean restaurant, I was greated somewhat halfheartedly by the counter attendant who reminded me of a hybrid of Fantasia Barrino and Keyshia Cole.  The menu is what you would expect from your typical wing hut- wings, burgers, fried rice,  the usual philly/chicken philly, and sides including fried okra and mushrooms. Coke products come self-serve from a countertop fountain, or cans in a cooler.\\n\\nI settled on a 10-piece combo all drum- half Teriyaki, half mild. Baby opted for a 10-piece fried extra crispy- lemon pepper and mild. The combo comes with fries and a drink  Not bad for $8.29 (extra upcharge for no flats).  The wings were huge and juicy, not the anemic, shriveled up wings that I'd been use to getting from other places, and the fries were ok after adding the seasoning salt on the counter.  My only gripe is that the cook could have drained off some of the teriyaki sauce before adding the fries to the container. By the time I got home, half of my fries were swimming in the sauce and soggy.  Also, there was no celery in either of our orders-and I love dipping celery into the ranch sauce.\\n\\nOverall, the place gets a A in taste, and I was pleased to see a perfect sanitation score of A (100) posted right up front.   Work on better customer service (the cashier tried to wait on too many people at once, and got baby's order wrong at first-but promptly corrected things).and  In N Out will be a formidable competitor in the Cobb County Wing game.

They could probably crinkle cut your burger, if it wasn't against health laws...you know, to use the same machine to cut potatoes and raw meat.  Speaking of the meat, according to Mighty Fine they use only \\"Coleman all-natural chuck that contains no antibiotics, hormones or preservatives. Coleman beef is always strictly vegetarian-fed\\"..but you can't get a veggie burger here.  Maybe they could form a patty from the veggies they serve the cows.  Someone should put that in the suggestion box.  So, the meat tastes really fresh and...meaty.  I guess it's the all-natural meat they use, unlike other places that probably use meat \\"from heroin-addicted hooker\\" cows \\"with herpes,\\" (quote stolen from my favorite blogger).

Often times we see managers present in the room but  not engaged; however, she was definitely in command of the evening's activities. \\n\\nThe sad part for us was the food quality. The beef tartare was overly spiced. The consistency was correct, but the amount of additional ingredients took away from what should be an understated and refreshing dish. The tuna tartare was actually too sweet. Again, the freshness of the tuna was overshadowed by a glaze bordering on syrupy. We picked at both of the dishes but were not inclined to finish either.

So keep in mind that you can expect heavier, wheat-or-rice-based noodles, heavier dumplings, and spicier food (similar to si chuan food) that is characteristic of the region (as opposed to the lighter noodles and dumplings that you will be familiar with if you eat Cantonese food or dimsum).  And truly, he cooks like a mom or dad would in China.\\n\\nI'm a picky westerner :), and my favorite dishes are similar to those mentioned already:\\n--beef rolls (amazing!)\\n--cold noodles (liang pi) (amazing! and so authentic and must be tried at least once.. but unless you can really handle spice, ask for less heat)\\n--spicy green beans (gan bian si ji dou)\\n--cut noodles (dao xiao mian) (very authentic, just like my wife's mom makes them)\\n--ginger beef\\n--chive pockets (jiu cai he ze)\\n\\nThe servers are great -- we love chatting with the son and daughter, and they're always happy, prompt and informative.

We then proceeded to wait another 10 minutes before we were acknowledged by our waiter who informed us he was too busy and would have to send someone else over.  ??

After everyone had picked at what they wanted the waiter came by and was surprised to find I still didn't have my meal....great service.  A manager did come over and explain that my meal had actually been given to someone else at the table, and it was really their order that got mixed up.  Not quite sure how that made it better.  They did say they'd bring me my meal, but I just requested that they pack it up to go.  Oh, and they comped my meal.  Wow.  Then they brought the bill stating, once again, that they comped my meal and they were giving me a $10 gift certificate to return, however, they would apply it to my bill if I wanted.  After looking the bill over, we found that they had charged me twice for my meal - but they did comp one.  ???  Not quite sure how that works.

Every time that we have passed by, the line has been insane. This time it was slightly shorter, so we decided to make the line. Well, \\"slightly\\" shorter meant 45 minutes. In the heat. Under the peak afternoon sun. Fun! We started making wagers as to whether or not we would be completely melted before we got inside. The cast members give you menus for you to peruse while you wait. We decided what we wanted to order while we waited. Unlike others.\\n\\nFinally! Hurray! We crossed the threshold and into A/C! Whoo hoo! We then continued the line inside to place our order. There are digital menus along the Armor hallway as well so, you know, you can figure out what you want to order. When you reach the front, a cast member will direct you to an ordering station and hand you a rose if you do not have a Magic Bands. Of course, we shared that station with another family. They obviously did not bother with the menu that was handed out outside nor with the menus inside either. So we waited, and waited and waited while they bickered back & forth and decided what they wanted. All this while people just kept passing us by.  But I digress.\\n\\nYou place your order and they scan your rose or Magic Bands then you're free to sit wherever you like. We chose the darker West Wing. There is also the Ballroom and the Rose Gallery. Your food finds you by the chip in the Rose or your Magic Band. So, maybe you should wait til after you eat to wander around. Our food arrived no more than 5 minutes after we ordered. It is quick service after all.\\n\\nThe food itself is good. My husband and I each got a French Onion Soup, you know, because it's so cold outside. We also shared a Roast Beef Sandwich and I had a Strawberry Cream Cheese cupcake. The soup was good, actually better than expected. The sandwich was enough for us to share and it tasted fresh. Is it worth $12? Not really, but we must remember where we are. They originally had a steak sandwich on the menu for under $9 which sounded really good, but that is no longer an option. The cupcake was really good!

I can't begin to explain how tremendously disappointed I am that a mistake had occurred. Though I am wholly grateful the staff from today had tried their best, the over-encompassing issue here is that it was meant to be a special gift--but it was ruined due to an /avoidable/ mistake made by one of the members of Paris Baguette's staff if they had been more wary of their task.\\n\\nIn addition to the missing message: they made the wrong cake.

Fine, so I helped myself to look for my business partners by the bar. After 10 mins, no one ever came to me and ask if I would like to order, so I waved down a lady server named Brad to order. I told the lady that i would like to order beer, so i asked her what kind of tap beer they have in the house. It should only take her 10 seconds to answer but the lady simply gave me a weird look and just told me to check the tiny menu on the table, and never came back and ask if i want something. It was only my second time at Joey, the first time was great coz I brought my employees to celebrate one of my staff's birthday. This time I totally felt that Asians are not so welcome there. I even told other nicer lady server about the problem but the manager were never showed up to solve the problem. At the end, one of my business partner paid the bill.

Not happy at ALL with my experience here. Came here for a fast dinner with a friend for \\"burger night\\" and they hit you left and right with other fees. Everywhere advertised says $5 for one of the burgers on their menu and fries or tots. The first thing our bartender says to us when we sit down and order a water is \\"are you getting a drink or just waters?\\" We had literally JUST sat down, didn't even open a menu yet. My friend was planning to drink but i just wanted a water for the night since i had to be up at 5am the next morning. So she replied \\"I am ordering a drink\\" when she comes back to get her drink order, my friend ordered a wine and i told her i was just having a water. We assumed she had asked us earlier if we were ordering drinks because we were sitting at the bar. Than she tells me i HAVE to order a drink to get the burger $5 special. Either a soda or lemonade. I wasn't trying to be cheap, i genuinely just wanted a water because i don't drink soda and i didn't want something super sweet. I pointed to the menu where it does not indicate \\"purchase of drink required\\" for the special. Literally just says $5 burger with fries or tots and she replied \\"yeah that's because our menu is stupid\\". Sorry but i genuinely don't care how \\"stupid\\" your menu is. It should state the restrictions to get the special and i shouldn't be forced to order a drink if it doesn't say and i don't want one. Than when i proceeded to order my burger the one i wanted was $6 instead of $5 when i asked why she said because of the sauce. I asked if i could get it with no sauce and she said no. Very disappointed that i couldn't just order what i wanted. Anyways i ended up ordering a lemonade with half lemonade half water because it was so sweet and i didn't want something super sweet (hence why i had ordered a water from the start). Cost me $3 for a half lemonade half water. I must say the burger was good THANK GOD and the fries were delicious. At least something came out okay from the night.

At one point we had two waitresses, one who was quite over-eager.  As mentioned in other reviews, they brought us veggies (red pepper, baby tomatoes, and squash) with an aioli dipping sauce.  That dish could be representative of the whole meal:  a good focus on fresh food, pleasant presentation, and a dip that was good but not great.  It lacked a little flavor.  I would say the rest of the meal went on from there - we had 4 appetizers: the mushrooms with quail egg, the chicken drum sticks, the edamame chilled soup, the coconut shrimp, and one entree: the eggplant scampi.  All are good, but not great: the chef has the right idea, but the execution lacks in ways that are hard to pinpoint. I wonder what kind of thickeners they use on their sauces.  That could be what drags everything down a notch.  I had a glass of sangria, which was pleasant.  My friend had a glass of wine.  The bill was around $60.

And I experienced a couple of cases of being placed on hold without being told so. I wanted not only daal instead of gravy but also something else (daal or naan) instead of rice, which I don't care for with tandoori chicken. This seemed too much for the folks on the phone to handle. They didn't clarify this, but I discovered that each order of chicken (4-5 pieces) includes one free naan (not enough if you plan on ignoring the rice). So any naan you order is in addition to that. Either way, enjoy the food and try to ignore the bad service.\\n\\nUpdate. During my most recent visit, the person on the phone was accommodating of my requests and the manager/owner was there to ensure my satisfaction.

My husband and I are a big fan of their beer selection and appreciate that they offered a 6-beer flight of 5 oz pours for $13. We each ordered three samples but sipped each others to get the full picture of the brewery. Their saison was solid and so was the pale ale and Scottish ale. The bloodthirst wheat was hands down my favorite which was surprising because I always pick the saison. The blood orange flavor with the perfect wheat haze just put this beer over the top for me. My husband tried two IPAs and also enjoyed them. For a brewery, they also have a fantastic menu with reasonable prices. We ordered the pork tacos and quesadilla as appetizers (but really for dinner) and were impressed with the unique flavors and sauces that made these stand-out from regular bar food.

We've eaten at Sanaa and Boma and thought this restaurant would be the best of the three. Not so for us, I'm sad to say.  First, we were seated at a booth, which is normally what we prefer. However, the seat was too far from the table and there was no way to pull it closer to the table, so we couldn't sit back and eat. I asked if there were any bolsters or pillows and our waiter said, \\"No\\" and just turned and walked away. Okay. So we had to scoot ourselves up to the table like little kids, which was alright for a bit, but it's nice to sit back and relax.  Then, when we ordered, we started with an appetizer, which was delicious [I've forgotten the name, but there were 3 triangle-shaped dumplings, for lack of a better word]. We each ordered a drink - I ordered a Cosmopolitan, my go-to drink, but it didn't taste like any Cosmo I've ever had. When our waiter asked how we liked our drinks, I told him that I didn't particularly care for it but he just said, \\"Oh\\" and walked away. No offer to get me something else or anything. Our entrees were the fish - which was amazing - and the lamb shank, which was a huge portion, and while it was extremely tender, it wasn't anything special, and I love lamb. We also ordered the vegetables [we love vegetables and there were some African selections], which sounded very interesting and from the description I thought they would be presented in separate containers or bowls, but they were just mixed together, and had the look of a can of mixed peas and carrots. I mean, it just wasn't what we were expecting - I guess our expectations were too high. They tasted okay but again, the dish wasn't anything special. \\nOur waiter was, for the most part, missing in action. When he did show up, he asked how we liked our food. My daughter didn't care for hers and, again, our waiter wasn't the least bit concerned. He was concerned about his tip, however. We just hurried and paid our bill and left. So, we spent top dollar for a so-so dining experience. \\nFor me, Boma is the best restaurant with the best service at Animal Kingdom Lodge. I realize it's a buffet, but the waiters there [we've been multiple times] are very caring and friendly and want you to have a great experience. My suggestion for a great dinner is to go to Sanaa and have the full bread service as your appetizer.  It's incredible!!!! Wow! Go in the early evening so you can enjoy watching the animals - ask for a window table. You may have to wait a bit for that seating, but it's worth it.  And then go to Boma for dinner. \\nAs far as cost goes with Jiko, it's pretty much on par with Monsieur Paul's in Epcot, which is an amazing dining experience!  If you haven't eaten there, do yourself a culinary favor and treat yourself to a fabulous meal and evening out! Oh! And ask for a window table so you can watch the fire works! You'll love it."},{"name":"Zaika Indian Bistro","address":"442 Main St","city":"Woburn","stars":"4.5","text":"I went to this place on a Saturday night and this restaurant was suggested by one of my friends and the Yelp reviews looked great too. Unfortunately, I wasn't really happy with the food that was served to me. Me and my friend had non-veg platter and chicken biryani. The meat in the platter was too chewy and inedible. Also, When the biryani came and I tried eating the chicken I found out it was raw. Hence, I returned it and luckily not charged. I had this feeling that maybe due to holiday season the chef was not available. My first experience was  extremely bad but I will probably give another chance based on the reviews."},{"name":"Zyka","address":"1677 Scott Blvd","city":"Decatur","stars":"4","text":"My husband and I went recently for Iftar here.

We have everything there and it's all fine dining with amazing food. \\n\\nBefore heading here my husband warned me that it's sort of 'different'. I realized why once I picked up our food. It's more like a cafeteria sort of feel. Haha they serve you in plastic plates and in plastic trays. It was just so weird to me. It's all self serve which is really not a big deal. Just something I need to adjust to. \\n\\nSo now to the food part. \\n\\nWe ordered the following:\\nChicken Biriyani- which was maybe a 8/10. It had a lot of masala and was very flavorful. It came with raita so that was good. \\n\\nChicken 65: well before going to the restaurant I did look at reviews and read that they had the 'best' chicken 65. Since it was my first time having it. I was expecting it to blow me away. Sadly it didn't. My husband however, enjoyed it. He eats everything. \\n\\nLastly, the Nihari: it was really good but spicy. But good. Tastes really good with all the garnishing and filled me up to the top! \\n \\nI also had the matka kulfi while my husband had chai. Again they were both average.

Though I was not a regular customer of JoPa I always enjoyed eating there a couple of times a  year.  I had high hopes for Joe's as an alternative to Raccoon Lodge and McMenamins, but I am back to the drawing board.\\n\\nThe burger patty was as thin as McDonalds and the lettuce and tomatoes completely overpowered the taste of the meat. I would not mind the thin patty if it were better balanced against the veggies.  The fries were thin, crisp and tasty- no issues there.  My son ordered the chili dog and could barely eat the chili, and he is NOT a picky eater.  We ordered the calamari and it tasted like it came out of a frozen bag from grocery store.  The quesdo fundito bean dip tasted like nothing more than a can of refried beans mixed with a little cheese.  \\n\\nWe ordered a glass of both red and white wine and had to send the glass of red back- totally undrinkable.\\n\\nThe new atmosphere is what baffles me the most.  The whimsical decor of JoPa has been stripped down to a bare bones sports bar feel.  There are plasma screen televisions hanging around the perimeter of the dining room that, I assume, are for watching sports.  A high school football game was being screened when we dined on Friday night.  \\n\\nNow here is the interesting part:  if this new venture is trying to bill itself as \\"fun and entertaining\\" environment where you can come and watch the game... why is it NOT open on Saturday and Sunday afternoons when most of the games take place?"},{"name":"Tijuana Flats","address":"3331 S.

While the soup was definitely still hot by the time I got back to my office, I was really disappointed by the portion size.

The food is amazing and this place has earned every star and all the praise that people have given it.\\n\\nI was on top of it this year and called exactly three months before Valentine's day to score us a reservation during prime time.  The staff was very helpful and accommodating.\\n\\nThe Valentine's day menu was extraordinary.  When I first saw the menu I was not sure how this was going to go because there were a number of items that were foreign to me.. Vellutata Friulana?  Bottarga?  It definitely all worked out.\\n\\nI think where Frasca is so extraordinarily successful is how they manage to make such high cuisine while still keeping it approachable.  For example, the appetizer was a broccoli and lobster dish that was unique and just out of this world, but it would remind you of a good lobster and broccoli chowder.  The best one you've ever had and then more, that is.\\n\\nBouchon in Napa will live on as my wife's least favorite and most expensive culinary experience.  I loved the place.  However, French isn't her thing (she doesn't eat pork and that's part of most of the best French in my opinion).  However, she LOVED Frasca.  It takes that French style and makes it familiar.\\n\\nThe biggest downside of our experience and what made it imperfect was the seating.  We ended up seated against the wall, nice and snuggled up to our neighbors.  When you spend a few hundred dollars on a special occasion dinner, it just feels less special when you're packed in next to another couple and can hear everything each other are saying.  A little privacy would be nice for a romantic dinner.  I guess next time we'll make that request to have private seating.\\n\\nOther than that, this place is top notch.

I live in the neighborhood and I'm a sucker for a great cafe. I originally started coming here back in 2008 shortly after they opened.\\n\\nAnd sure -- there are some bright spots. The gazpacho soup and the tomato bisque are both super yummy. The grilled cheese is pretty good, if you manage to get it in less than 15 minutes and/or still warm (though it is a tad on the pricy side, as far as grilled cheese go).\\n\\nHowever the downsides to this place just seriously outweigh the positives. Over the past few months I've gotten increasingly sour and dour service from the cashiers (and yes, I understand it gets busy and life is hard, but does it hurt to acknowledge me when I'm smiling and saying hello and trying to order?).  A lack of policies about seating means that I'm never able to find a seat (Crema is not the only cafe with this conundrum). However what really annoyed me enough today to write a review about it was the fact that they NEVER have the items I want or need (that are on their own menu!) when I come to eat them. Case in point: plain bagels. I have come to Crema more than a DOZEN times to be told (after waiting in a super long line) -- \\"Oh, we only have cinnamon raisin right now. We ran out.\\" And no, I am not a fan of lox on a cinnamon raisin bagel (gag).\\n\\nOrder enough supplies to last you, hire some new cashiers, figure out what to do about the delay in food production (18 minutes for a small bowl of gazpacho to go?

The waitress advised us that they had to \\"tone it down\\" because most of the customer feedback prior to our day there was that they don't want it spicy.\\n\\nSo the food:\\n\\nI had a Crawfish Pie and a bowl of the Artichoke & Oyster Soup\\n\\nCrawfish Pie:  Not much filling in the pie itself, but what is in there is good.  About the size of a small empanada, mostly crust.  Since my benchmark for crawfish pie are the ones I get from Hebert's in Houston or Louisiana that are chock full of crawfish and cheese and wrapped in flaky pastry, I have to say this was a bit disappointing.\\n\\nArtichoke and Oyster Soup:  This was actually pretty good.  Artichokes swimming in a white wine broth.  Oysters, while from one of those plastic buckets you find in the grocery, were still fresh.  Very good in my opinion (not served cold as in another reviewers comments)\\n\\nFrog Legs with Crawfish & artichoke \\"hushpuppies\\":  The Frog legs themselves are quite delicious, and the batter around them was cooked perfectly, just bland.  I am going to push my thoughts on the legs to a follow up review because I did not adhere to the rule above when ordering.  So Fresh meat, perfectly cooked, bland batter for now.\\n\\nNormally they serve this platter with hushpuppies but they had run out of the batter and the owner was not present to make more for some reason.  But the alternative that they offered up sounded way better anyway so it was a win win as far as we were concerned.\\n\\nThe alternative Crawfish and artichoke \\"hushpuppies\\" were fantastic.  It is not really a hushpuppy and I am not sure what they called them, whether it be a \\"ball\\" or something else.  Essentially it is crawfish, artichoke, mayonnaise, spices and a binder of some sort rolled into a ball, covered in panko and deep fried.  They are pretty good.\\n\\nOyster & Shrimp Po'boy:  The good news is that they allow you to mix and match so they let my daughters get both oysters and shrimp on their po'boy.  Some places don't let you do that, so their flexibility did not go unnoticed.  The po'boy is pretty standard, Fried oysters & shrimp, lettuce, tomato, and their particular mayonnaisse \\"secret sauce\\".  Shrimp and oysters were again cooked perfectly and the bread is actually decent.  So the po'boy was average to just above average.\\n\\nRegular size is around 8 inches, large 12.  It is a decent size so you won't be hungry.\\n\\nWould I go back?  sure, no problems there.  Unfortunately they have some big issues to overcome, and I hope they make it.  First, I think they need to find that happy spicy medium between Atlanta and New Orleans.  Second, they need to prepare a little bit better if they use a social networking site for advertising with that much of a following (but I can forgive that as most businesses that use scout mob or group on tend not to understand what is going to happen).  \\n\\nHopefully they can work out the kinks and make it cajun enough to appease the masses but not turn away those of us that really don't mind real cajun food."},{"name":"Jiko - The Cooking Place - Temporarily Unavailable","address":"2901 Osceola Pkwy","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Jiko was one of the best meals I have ever had. \\n\\nThe ambiance is very cool, relaxing and dark lit at dinner. \\n\\nWe didn't wait long for our table & had a drin while we waited (some sort of martini that was wonderful. \\n\\nOur service was top notch, we wanted for nothing. \\n\\nI ordered the grouper and was delighted!

We came in and took a table for four, we started talking and it was a little while later that we had to wave down the waitress (as we found out later she was the only waitress working that night and her duties included, waiting tables, helping out in the kitchen, mixing drinks as well as taking ALL the Togo orders and packing them up).\\n\\n So we ordered and talked among ourselves the table next to us ended up flagging the waitress down to let her know that they no longer wanted the bottle of Sake they ordered and they just wanted the check. \\n\\nThis was the first Red Flag that we should have noticed. After they left we saw about three or four orders leave the restaurant to be delivered to some lucky person down the street. I would have to say that at least 20 people got there Togo orders cooked and delivered before we got out first dish and it was not even the appetizer we order (spring rolls and a fried salmon collar) it was the last bowl of miso soup in the whole restaurant and we had ordered two of them (RED FLAG #2). \\n\\nSo we waited about 5 minutes thinking that we would get our spring rolls and salmon collar, oh no... Nothing was brought out until about 15 minutes after that. (I know what you are thinking why did you not get up and leave or make a scene or something) As I said at the start of this we really liked this place, we thought oh maybe they are busy having a bad day something is going on but the amazing food we have come to expect will be delivered hot and fresh to our waiting taste buds.... \\n\\nNOPE, that did not happen someone dropped a bucket of simply green or some other cleaning product because the whole place started to smell like the end of the night and people are cleaning up to go home! I don't know what happened did it get all over our order and they had to start from scratch cooking it... I don't think so!! because a Togo order left the building. \\n\\nIt was about an hour and 20 minutes before we got one order of Pad Thai Spicy. At that point another unfortunate couple came into the restaurant they must have never eaten there because after about 20 minutes and two rolls of salmon being delivered to our table they got up and left and we could not take it anymore and asked for the check and the rest of our order to be cancelled the spring rolls, salmon collar, the other half of the dinner combo a California roll and 3 pieces of sushi.\\n\\nIf you cant prioritize the people in the restaurant on Valentines Day over the Togo orders something is wrong. I don't know what happened to this place but they used to be great.\\n\\nAll in all it was only three people working and one of there friends helping out.

Only to be forgotten about by our waitress and seated at a table infested with ants. Needless to say my outdoor experience was ruined. We asked to be moved inside and the hostess quickly brought us inside to our table. \\n\\nOverall, the ambience and the experience is 5 star. The restaurant offers a perfect date night experience with low lighting, and live music toward the evening. \\n\\nI ordered the cod fish fillet with a crabe cake on top ( I forget the name, sorry!) and my boyfriend got the scallops. The seafood was so fresh but not worth the steep price tag! \\n\\nOur waiter was oddly and obviously very pushy about us spending extra on meal add ins or additional drinks. Even if we politely said no he would bring it up again...and again. \\n\\nOverall, it was a good date night. But seafood was unimpressive and the waiter was too pushy  I definitely recommend this location for date night or girls night."},{"name":"Brick & Fire","address":"1621 S Orange Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Best margherita pizza I have had.

I left 3/4 of my chicken tortilla soup in the bowl, it tasted like something that I'd get from an awful elementary school tortilla on the \\"potluck\\" day. Salad was swimming in greasy vinaigrette and functionally inedible - I picked off the figs and blue cheese and nuts and left everything else. Whichever of the cold drinks I got (which they say are made from scratch) tasted like a gross Kool Aid. My companion ordered a sandwich, hard to mess up, right? He said his was not good either.\\n\\nWe agreed as we left we would have been far happier with the Greek or Five Guys restaurants next door...and actually had a delicious \\"make up\\" dinner there, since our F2O food was inedible.\\n\\nBeyond the food: the patio and the chairs at this location are nice, and very pleasant to sit out on in the evening.\\n\\nStaff on the patio was attentive and helpful. Inside the location despite the fact that there was no line the guys at the two cash registers were very impatient for us to order, we stood 10 feet away looking at our menus and one guy asked us \\"Are you ready yet?\\" five times before we were ready. (We took perhaps four minutes to choose what we'd eat - again, no line, no one else waiting).\\n\\nOnce we were actually ordering, the guy lowered his voice and we had to ask him to speak up several times or repeat himself as he reeled off the food options.

We walked in to the main dining area which looked like the ballroom from the movie. While we were sitting I had trouble listening to my family talking to me because I was more focused on looking around. The details were spot on. \\n\\nWe get our food and it was good, it came out in a timely manner, and was exactly what we were expecting. The staff was very friendly and attentive to all of their guests. They called my brothers princes which gave me a laugh since they are teenagers and think they are too mature for it. \\n\\nThe only thing I would suggest is how the seating arrangement is. It is like a cafeteria style where people just sit wherever they want. It a good idea for a small family (there were four of us) but not a good idea if there's a party of 10 or more.

You know it, and I know it. This place has a little bit of a snooty booty vibe to it. But it's not overly pretentious. I didn't think our waiter liked us at first. Reason being, that when I asked what was in the punch, he started rattling off various liquors and absinthe, I lost count after say, four. Then I said, \\"Reminds me of college.\\" He said, \\"You drank this fancy of a cocktail in college?\\" I hang my head and say \\"No, but...\\"  You know how it is, you dump everything you have, add some random punch and various other stuff like kool-aid to the mix and you have your jungle juice. But then he said not to get the punch after happy hour because it just sits, they make it once per day and when it's out - it's out. \\n\\nI thought about getting a wine. I heart riesling, so Bryan (our waiter) poured me out a little sample. Still not sure if I should go the wine route or try a fancy mixed drink,  I opted for the recommended Kavalier and Clay. So so so tasty. Probably the best cocktail that I've ever had. I would definitely order this next time I'm in town. If you're a tequila fan, you'd probably love it too. Just such a nice refreshing flavor with the perfect amount of citrus. \\n\\nThe late-night food menu is awesome, $3-$6 for a small plate. French fries were a hit, as well as the baguette and nutella with jam and hazelnuts. But then again, you could put nutella on anything and I'd eat it. Mmmm, nutella. \\n\\nIt should be noted that the seating is shared. There are a few very long, beautiful wooden tables where you sit with people that you've never met before. Think hibatchi style, but not quite. It doesn't necessarily foster the lines of communication, though you may be sharing a table the individual groups and clusters stuck to their own group and didn't intermingle with other patrons. Kind of cool to just be a people watcher in this situation. \\n\\nC.C. is awesome. Just go. The interior is beautiful as well, I love how it is decorated and I love the open kitchen style.

Before we entered the bar we seen a group of multicultural persons leaving the bar and giving us a forewarning. One that we did not pay attention to and we thought it was just a bunch of drunk drivel. However, upon entering Bar BQ Bar the door man was sitting down and eyed us from head to toe with deep distaste, he was also hesitant to approach us, and we did not receive any greeting. We lined up in a single file line so he could easily check our Id's, trying to make it accessible for him because he was so disarming and meanwhile he was looking at each and every one of us scornfully and rolling his eyes. Immediately I thought, well maybe he's just having a bad night but he definitely left a bad taste in my mouth. Sweeping it under the rug, we walked towards the bar hoping for a better experience and customer service that was not given, unfortunately. The bartender gave us an unwelcoming welcome and we felt a lot of tension in the room, I told my friend I am not receiving a good vibe from this place and I feel uncomfortable so I did not order anything. He proceeded to order a drink when she finally acknowledged us again and the same friend decided that he wanted to go because of the hostility and we agreed. He told the bartender our plans to leave and that he no longer wanted the drink and she reacted with so much hostility it would've resulted in a bar fight if we had not kept our composure and acted like civilized human beings in a seemingly uncivilized setting; someone had to conduct themselves properly and professionally because apparently you can not expect this from a business. He asked to speak with a manager and she replied and said she was the manager and he kept calm and said we'd like to leave and she disrespectfully dismissed us, fortunately for her we were already leaving.

Unlike most people, my trip to Taste was during lunch time. I say unlike most people, because my girlfriend and I were there for about two hours and a couple that came in and sped through their meal, we were the only customers there. Therefore, our waiter was very attentive (almost too attentive at times) and we had no trouble getting our orders taken or the food arriving in a timely manner... but I can't speak for times when there are a whopping three or more tables. \\n\\nWe ordered a lot of food for two people. We actually asked the waiter for his advice on whether it would be too much, and he described the food as tapas style so it just right. Well, we ended up taking one whole dish home... but I digress. We started with the Mediterranean White Bean Spread. The spread was very good, kinda like hummus, but I wasn't a fan of the flat bread crisps. We had their lentil soup with potatoes, which was pretty good. We also split the Hass Avocados and Hearts of Palm Salad and the fish tacos. Both were delicious as well, and I would definitely get the fish tacos again. We also intended to split the Rosemary Tarragon Chicken Salad sandwich, but we were too full to even touch it. I took it home and had it for dinner that night and found the salad to be too heavy on the mayo, a bit on the bland side (aside from the taste of mayo) and the bread was extremely dry (but maybe if I had eaten it at the restaurant it would have been okay?). \\nOf course, when I saw we were too full to eat the sandwich, that didn't mean we were too full to have dessert! We opted to split the Banana Triangle with vanilla ice cream. It wasn't bad, but it also wasn't anything special, so I left feeling that maybe I should have saved my calories for something else. \\n\\nIn the area of ambiance, I felt that it was a little too dark for my taste. Perhaps that works at night, but during the day I would have liked it to be a little brighter. I do like the fact that they've got two \\"party room-ish\\" areas, so it could be a good place for private parties and groups."},{"name":"wagamama - prudential","address":"800 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I have been to Wagamama at the Pru dozens of times.

The lobster was split and prepared table side, no bib necessary, all of the work was done by our server.  For our dessert we shared a Raspberry Creme Brulee, this was also no joke, as the dish came closer to retirement, things began to get territorial.  I recommend getting one per person, to avoid these minor disputes.  Since it has been nearly 12 years since I had last been here, nothing has changed.  From what I remember the food is just as good now as it was when i was younger.  The Chart House made such an impression on me growing up, that my family and I traveled up to Boston, strictly to go to this establishment to celebrate my 13th birthday.

The spring roll wrappers were a little dry tasting, but the peanut / hoisin sauce made it all better. My soup was great, with a huge assortment of vegetables: green and red pepper, baby carrots, little mushrooms, onions (green and white), celery, and some other stuff I'm forgetting. The noodles were larger than vermicelli I've eaten, and were pretty slippery, making the use of chopsticks impossible by themselves. Enter spoon. All better. Hubby's beef soup was great, and buddy's beef special was good too, but the presentation was really funny. The special looked like a dessert, with cubes of beef  surrounded by fresh fruits and wait, what's this? A maraschino cherry!

I don't recommend the sushi bar because it's not fresh. I usually go here for just the crabs and clams. I don't like that manager here because he keeps track of how much people eat and when he starts to see that you ate alot, he tells your waiter to not service you anymore like not taking away dirty dishes and not getting you some water. They used to have a sign that they post in the restaurant \\"Extra charge for eating over two hours.\\" That's when I stop going.

Inviting, great place to meet friends for a casual meal. \\n\\nThe service: When the two of us arrived shortly after noon on a Tuesday, there was no one else there except for a couple of girls on their way out. The waiter told us that we could sit anywhere. We chose to sit at a four-top. Almost immediately, he told us to move. I asked nicely if it was possible to stay, since we would be ordering a few dishes. He declined, muttering something about it being more difficult to clean or manage. We had to move. Then when he brought out hot water, two different saucers for the mug and refill kettle, I removed the saucers because there was very little room on the table. At this point, he came over again to indicate nicely that I needed to use those saucers. Understandable. At this point, we asked again if we could please move to the four-top as we would be more comfortable there and the dining room was completely empty at the time. He grudgingly obliged this time, saying \\"Fine, go ahead\\" in a very rough voice and made no effort to hide his disdain as he rolled his eyes. \\nTo be fair, maybe because he realized we were going to get a fair bill and maybe pining for that tip, he did become more friendly and nice later on. Still. Not wanting to seat two at a four-top is understandable, but not when the dining room is empty and definitely not when you voice the concern being inconvenience. \\n\\nThe food: \\n*Escargot (12): First concern is presentation. I have come to expect escargot to come in an escargot plate, the ones with small round compartments. Not here. In addition, and maybe because of the serving dish, they were swimming in a salt laden olive oil. They tasted fine, but it was overpowered. \\n*Charcuterie: You will notice it is not a board. There was no board. I do feel there is something to be said regarding presentation and it was lacking. Came unimpressive on a plate. Tasted as unimpressive, something I could have made from a trip to Central Market or Whole Foods. \\n* Steak Frites: Cooked well with good flavors, but a little thick on the seared crust; some fries were burnt on edges. \\n*Seafood Cr√™pes: Spiciness was nice flavor, fluffy cr√™pes, could use vegetables? Also felt it might have been a little oversauced. \\n*Croque Madame: Best dish, even then personally could use more bechamel. Maybe I have been spoiled by too many delicious ones. \\n*Croque au saumon fum√©: Underwhelming again. Salmon definitely felt like grocery store. \\n*Desert Ile Flottante: Light, fluffy, sweet. Good finish to an overall average lunch. \\n\\nThe conclusion: Food was good, not great overall. Nice atmosphere. Many others reviews call this one of the most authentic French places around. Not sure where they were eating, but we disagreed. Maybe if our experience was better in regards to the service, we would want to return. As it was, probably not."},{"name":"Erin McKenna's Bakery NYC","address":"1642 E Buena Vista Dr","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"5 stars for their awesome soft serve!

You have to walk around until you find it at a service station in a bucket. Your food is wheeled out in a cart. Each table shares a plate of pastries which is inconsistent from table to table. (One of our pastries was a raspberry danish, but the table next to us had a yummy cinnamon bun in place of this. I was jealous.)\\n\\nI ordered eggs florentine, with the country ham and plum tomatoes.  I hate tomatoes and asked for them to be removed, but they refused. My eggs came in an oversized puff pastry with 1 sprig of spinach and half a teaspoon of sour cream.  Although the eggs were fine, it advertised cheese (no where in site) and I savored that 1 piece of spinach for that florentine taste. The ham was the smallest and driest piece of meat I've ever had. Close to pork jerk and almost inedible.\\n\\nAll the entrees were served on china, and the utensils were metal. So why were we forced to drink coffee out of styrofoam cups?

I came here with my family, many of whom are picky eaters, but everyone found something that fit their tastes here, so definitely don't be scared to try it if you're not a foodie. The food was outstanding and I would totally give it a 5-star rating...if it wasn't for the service. For one of the more upscale restaurants at Disney, I was incredibly let down by the quality of the service here.\\n\\nIt started when I asked our server to describe the cheese platter and got the response, \\"Well, it's cheese on a plate.\\" Me: ***Blank stare**** She continued, \\"...uuhmmm...I don't know what the cheeses are. I'll get you the list.\\" She then brought the list and just handed it to me and said, \\"There's like 5 or 6 of them on there.\\" Yes, the cheese list had descriptions but...couldn't she just have described them to me using the printed list as a cheat sheet? We did end up ordering it, and each cheese was paired with a fruit/nut/jelly...but since the plate was just plopped down in front of us unceremoniously, we had no idea what any of them were (I volunteered as the guinea pig to try the pairings, especially a weird translucent cube that I believed to be apple gelatin...still unsure?). By contrast, we were at the California Grill two nights later and got a similar cheese plate, but had a full description of all the cheeses and their pairings.\\n\\nWe had a similar issue with the wine at Jiko. My aunt asked for a wine recommendation and the server just tossed four bottles and a glass on the table and told her to try them all, then walked away. Even worse, apparently one of the wines was rancid (said my aunt, and agreed the server). Gross! Finally, while they have a gluten free menu (for my aunt), there was a lot of confusion between the food runners and the server over whether her dish was indeed gluten-free or not, which was something we stressed was of supreme importance. The lack of attention to detail was innapropriate for a high-end setting, even if it is in Disney.\\n\\nThankfully, after we let the server know that we were disappointed by the way my aunt's gluten allergy was handled, she really tried to make up for it and do everything she could to make the situation better, which is why I am not going to let all the service issues detract too much from my rating. When just considering the food, I was extremely impressed. The short rib was all kinds of slow-cooked amazing and served on top of a bed of truffled mashed potatoes. I don't like chicken, but those who ordered the chicken dish seemed to be a little bit obsessed with it! Also loved the sweet potato and pineapple soup.\\n\\nAnd the desserts! Because of the issues surrounding the first half of our dinner, we were comped two bowls of the parsnip creme brulee which was divine, it kind of had a pumpkin pie flavor. I had the coconut bread pudding as well and it was SOOOOOO GOOD! The toasted coconut ice cream on the side tasted like Lucky Charms! Why? I don't know, it was weird, but I loved it! Just get it!! Honestly, nothing I put in my mouth at this restaurant was anything short of perfection.

It was incredibly difficult to try and break up the chicken while eating the soup and I would have much rather had it in pieces. I found myself eating around the chicken piece; but the broth was incredible and I did enjoy it for the most part.

The fries were tasteless and not fresh at all. My bacon cheese burger was fine but my daughters cheese burger had a bun so hard you could throw it around like a frisbee.  The burgers at best are comparable to Wendy's burgers which isn't favorable considering you can get the same meal for half the price at Wendy's.  Oh and apart from the long wait time and subpar food quality we had an annoying fly hovering over us the entire time.     I'm a big believer in customer service and one aspect of that is maintaining professionalism in front of customers.  While we were eating I couldn't help but overhear someone from management yelling at someone in the kitchen for about a good 2 minutes.  Not good considering the kitchen is open to the front counter and restaurant.  Saw 2 managers just hanging out at one of the tables near the soda machine chatting and taking selfies.

Would have never known it was there unless someone mentioned \\"You know, I think there's a place over here that serves breakfast.\\" \\n\\nWell while I was retreating to my 2nd home in the Vinings Sunday we decided to grab breakfast. The weather was freezing as we made our trip to J Christophers in the Vinings. My friends and I got lucky the day before at Highland Bakery as far as no wait and the place being comfortably busy, but on Sunday no such luck at J Christophers but that'll be another review. Once they told us the wait was 45 minutes + we were out the door and on our quest for another place to feed our hungry bellies and prepare our minds for the tasking day. \\n\\nWhere else is there to eat? I Hop? No. Waffle House? No. Hmmm? \\nThen we came upon this place. Nestled in a shopping center off of South Cobb and the East West Connector (I think). They opened at 11 but it was 11:05 when we arrived and there was no sign on. That should have been a warning. If you've got a business be prompt and prepared. We went in to find that they were opened and we were immediately seated. Atleast there was no wait right? Once we were seated our drink orders were taken. It took I would say 10 minutes to get our glasses of orange juice. I think they were milking the oranges. lol I have to point out we were a table of three and there was only another table of two seated behind us with a staff of 5 or more. \\n\\nOver all the staff was very friendly, but unfortunately very slow. And also if you plan on visiting this place and you order orange juice be aware that they serve the orange juice with ice. Some people don't tend to like it that way so heads up if you go. \\n\\n****I'm not done yet so please keep reading*****\\n\\nWe've discussed the slow service. Now lets take a look at the food. \\nIf you have an appetite O-M-G you would love this place!!! I would highly recommend it if you like to eat, you are not concerned with the beating your arteries are gonna take when you're done, and you are just ready to enjoy a great breakfast. Simple, but very good. \\n\\nI ordered the southwest omelet filled with green peppers, onions, monterey jack cheese, and served with a side of salsa and sour cream to top it off. The omelet was HUGE!!! It was also served with a side of breakfast potatoes and a bowl of bacon, and we're not talking 2 or 3 slices of bacon but like almost the whole package of what you'd buy in the store. Ok, maybe not the whole thing but atleast half of the package, and 2 slices of toast. lol  \\n\\nMy fiance purchased the french toast covered in Strawberries served with maple syrup, 2 eggs, and a side of bacon and toast as well and our friend ordered the same as I did. The french toast took up a whole plate. I mean there were a minimum of 6 pieces of french toast on the plate, the bacon was served the same as mine and then 2 eggs. \\n \\nIt has been a long time since i've seen a meal take up the entire table. There were only 3 of us and we ordered just 3 meals. No appetizer, no dessert, no extras period and there was not a space on the table to even place your fork. My tummy was very happy Sunday. None of us could even finish our meals. \\n\\nI would recommend this place because the food , once it arrived, was great and plentiful and not to mention affordable. The atmosphere was ok. It was Sunday morning, but I will say I would definitely revisit this place for a night out. The bar looks fully stocked and seems like a good place to hang out and there are t.vs in every direction. I mean each wall has t.vs from one end to the other, even above the entrance ways of the bathrooms. If you love sports and hearty food you'd love this place i'm sure."},{"name":"Xinh Xinh","address":"7 Beach St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"**2.5 stars**\\n\\nNot sure how the Viet food selection is in Boston, but my friends and I came here on a very cold day to warm up with hot soups.

It's a little on the expensive side as I paid a little over $7 for 2 \\"breakfast burritos\\" which were normal taco sizes in my book.

Extraordinary attention not only to flavor but to texture and color as well.  Each dish was a new and marvelous invention.

Grilled sardine was delicate in texture but strongly flavored and among dollops of aioli, kale, and capers -- like having the Mediterranean on a plate.  Next was veal tonnato -- a fish salad topped with little croutons of deliciousness and woven with baquerones.  Char belly was on a chick pea pur√©e bed, with a delicious rust colored oil at the fringe and a skin on the char that was perfectly crisp and decorated with husks of roasted chick pea.  The cocktails were inventive without being precious and the wine list was deep and rich with unusual selections -- not a thing obvious about it, but not too geeky either.  Service was friendly, attentive, quietly enthusiastic, and occasionally amusing.  We were sent off with a dessert Tokaji on the house, a wonderful touch.

It's a large park in the middle of a bustling city. It is the urban, edgier sibling to Piedmont Park. It even happens to have a zoo located in the middle of its forest. It's great. The coffeehouse across the street? Meh. Not so much.\\n\\nI used to train a goat at the zoo (yep, you read that right) for a semester when I was a student in college. I always noticed the small coffeeshop across the street and wanted to check it out, but it was always gearing up to close by the time I was done working in the pen. So, on a glorious day in February, I decided to march on over and try it out. \\n\\nFor one thing, there is very limited parking. I'm talking no dedicated parking for the coffeeshop, so you have to fend for yourself on the side streets or Cherokee for street parking. I found a spot not too far and walked on in. This place is tiny. Super tiny. I think my bedroom might be bigger than this place, and that's saying something. It was also very stuffy (no central AC) and the porch seating was rather...err...dirty? There is very limited seating inside, so if you're thinking about getting some work done, go elsewhere. The staff was nice. Well...to me. There was a child who was confused about not having chocolate ice cream, and one worker was just not having it. I can understand that, but being rude to a clueless 4-year old is probably not advisable.\\n\\nI sat down with my house brew, which was delicious, by the buckets of ice cream. This was the only seat available, and it was a mistake because of how close it was to the booth. I had a few families get a little too close trying to look at the ice cream.\\n\\nOverall, I ended up leaving after 15 minutes. If you want to come here after a long day at the zoo, it might be nice. Otherwise, you'll be better off elsewhere."},{"name":"Chile Verde","address":"4852 Sawmill Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"I went to Cafe Verde on a Friday afternoon after reading about it on Yelp.

I got the Signature Fajitas, which were basically chicken steak, and shrimp fajitas. \\ni think they could add a little more variety to the fajita menu. All they have are the three meat options, or the signature, which is almost $15.\\n\\nWhen it came to the service they were excellent. I cam in parched after a long night of drinking, and they probably filled my glass up five times. I also was asked numerous times how my meal was, which is always nice.

The carne seemed as if it was made of good meat, but it also was seasoned oddly, not at all like New Mexcican carne adovada.

I didn't believe this until I ordered my meal and felt that maybe I could have personally made that meal better than how it was made in the restaurant. \\n\\nI'm glad I did try it because without trying the place I'd never know what I like and don't like in town. What won my husband was the Chocolate Suffle which was a warm chocolate brownie looking thing with Jeni's Goat Cheese Cherry Ice Cream on top. He also wanted to say that if you like spicy Louisiana food his Pasta Vesuvio meal will entice you next time you come in here.

I waited for EVER to get my Cuban. Upon receipt of my Cuban it was basically charred and hard as a rock, they also ran out of the bread that it is advertised as and everytime i took a burnt bite into it all the fillings slid out, too much mustard? I am really into Cubans, fine, but I am also not picky about eating, especially when I m hungry and Ive been waiting, basically, I had to throw most of it away as it was inedible. \\n\\nCuriously enough, while I was in line, there was some lady complaining about the length of time that it took to get her food out to her. A few minutes later another woman stepped forward and was answered rudely when asked if her food was ready. Then some girl at the counter thought she heard her name when her food was called and when she asked if they had called her name, two people practically shouted \\"NO\\" at her. If you ask me, the customers should have been the angry ones, but it was the youngish hipster girl and boy behind the counter that were angry and rude. \\n\\nif it wasnt for the last time i came here and got a rediculously delicious chicken salad sandwich i would rate this place with 1 star, I hope it is never like this again."},{"name":"pho d'lite","address":"4415 Skyline Drive, Suite 2","city":"Burnaby","stars":"3.5","text":"Super friendly staff and quaint place tucked away behind the buildings. \\n\\nI've only had the veggie pho which was great and had lots of veggies in it but what really takes the cake is the fact they can serve me a soft egg on the side.

We waited about 15 minutes for the noodles to arrive and another 25 after that for the potstickers. For a Chinese restaurant, that's a damn long time to wait for your food.\\n\\nThink that take-out is a faster way to experience Peaceful? Wrong. The last time I ordered food to-go, the kitchen was so behind on its orders that I waited in excess of 30 minutes before my food was ready.  It's pretty clear that the biggest problem at this restaurant is the slow turnaround time for food orders. \\n\\nDespite the long waits, the staff is generally polite and helpful, which is a plus considering that you'd often be lucky to get a smile or a \\"thank you\\" at some other low-budget casual Chinese restaurants. They speak both English and Mandarin, too, which is handy. \\n\\nDepending on what you order, the food is pretty good, and their beef rolls are excellent. I'm also a big fan of their hot and tangy soup dumplings, which is deliciously spicy and packed with umami. I will say that I've had better potstickers; the dough wrapper is a bit too thick for my liking.\\n\\nIn the end, Peaceful is worth a try, but just make sure you have lots of time to wait for a table and for your food.\\n\\nOh, and bring either cash or your debit card -- they don't take credit cards."},{"name":"Mighty Fine Burgers Fries & Shakes","address":"10515 N Mo-Pac Expy, Ste 105","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"There were no vegetarian burger options in the food truck.

You can go from No Spice (white) to Extra Spicy, which arrives a deep, dark red from all the gochujang. The soondubu combo is a fantastic deal: for ~$20, you get a small tofu soup and a small accompanying dish (bulgogi, bibimbap, galbi, etc). I've only ordered the soondubu, bulgogi, bulgogi noodle soup, and bibimbap, so I can't comment on anything else, but those four dishes are pretty solid.

New ownership! To echo another reviewer, we really, really want this place to succeed. Here's a few hard-nosed suggestions from someone who hopes to avoid more of the same.\\n\\nIt's been under new ownership 3 times since opening just a couple of years ago. None of them seemed to be pros. For a short, pricey burgers-and-fries menu, it was always food cooked by high school kids and served by high school kids. \\n\\nFirst, you need to rethink the Flatty and Fatty branding for your burgers. Why? Waitstaff spends too much time making sexist jokes about the orders? Makes food sound undersized or unhealthy?  Nope.  Basic statistics.  \\n\\nJust because the first guys liked to call the burgers that, doesn't make it right.  Nor is it right for over half of the world's population, or the 1/3 of the United States who are obese (per CDC 1/13/11).  My wife will never order a fatty, even if it's the best burger EVER.  As the name for a novelty burger, sure.  But as your signature dish? Why not just call the place \\"Fatty's\\" and let them know you mean it?  There's only one \\"Dirty's\\" in town for a reason, amigos. Considering your customers and location, just let it go and focus on good service and good food.  It's good food that makes a place, not the name of the food.  \\n\\nSpeaking of good food, I hear that the burgers have improved, all natural beef, etc. so good on you guys for that. More than half of your patrons won't order a fatty on principle, so how about a few decent alternatives as well?  Again, consider your market.  You had a Cobb that had just turned the corner into something really good.  It's like the cook saw Gordon's Nightmares and had a moment of clarity the next day at work after school.  That salad was at least on par with any Cobb in town.  Now it's back to sub par, and here's why ...\\n\\nShredded lettuce is a topping, not an ingredient. NO ONE will continue to order any salad that's got the look and taste of wilted boogers. Seriously, that's why no place but Tex-mex restaurants uses it for salads.  We all know the shredded lettuce and tomato salad is just a garnish on a plate of cheesy enchiladas (except one of the other reviewers of this place, apparently.  Oops.)  Same goes for the bacon - it's an ingredient, not a shredded topping.  Please don't spend money on good beef and ruin another quality menu item in return.  If you're calling yourself \\"Fatty's\\", then by all means go for it.  I'm not going to Fatty's for the salad.  Salads are scorned at Fatty's. But not in Northwest Hills.\\n\\nYou've got a great patio, very kid friendly.  Parents and pets like it, too.  But parents can't wait 20-30 mins for a burger with the kids in tow.  Nor can they wait 20-30 mins for a call in order, as in the past. Faster service & good food =  happy customers = more $$$.

The breakfast menu is not nearly as good as lunch or dinner. Plus you can get pastries, eggs, bacon almost anywhere so take advantage of the french cuisine at lunch/dinner. \\n\\n* Speaking of which, lunch is Quick Service and dinner is sit-down style. We were on a time crunch so we opted for the lunch reservation, which was perfect! \\n\\n * Try the grey stuff for dessert. Lumiere was right.

I had a croque monsieur, which my picky self thoroughly enjoyed. The food was good enough where I would not hesitate to come back in then future.\\n\\nThe theme and decor of the place is beautifully done. It's majestic and detailed and it feels like you're really dining in a castle. Very picturesque. \\n\\nOverall, I would definitely recommend eating here.

I ordered the Reggie and was loving the fried chicken, bacon, cheddar, and gravy goodness.  The fried chicken alone was excellent...juicy white meat in a well-peppered crust...super.  The poster who claimed that KFC is superior needs to drop the crack pipe.  Another excellent option is the grit cakes sampler.  The best topping here being the ham/cheese...smoky, salty, cheesy and delicious (as were the grits)--the fried green tomato in this dish was not spectacular.  My least favorite was the sausage/egg/cheese combo biscuit, although it was still good.  Also, they have Stumptown coffee.\\n\\nSo why only four stars?  Two reasons:\\n\\n1.  I have had bisuits as good, though these are very good.\\n\\n2.  The tiny size of the place.  It is charming, but the anxiety of ordering food to stay and then hoping a table opens up is a bit unsettling.  Especially when some hipster wanna-be is sitting there leisurely picking at her food while everyone else at her FIVE TOP was long since done.  This went on for 30 min or more while many were actually waiting for a seat.

Upon arrival, since we had reservations we were able to check in quickly, and only had to wait like 10 minutes. \\n\\nMy first impression when I walked into the restaurant was how amazingly close to the movie the decor and setting was of all the rooms, especially the ballroom it was breathtaking. Although growing up Disney, I have been out of the Disney loop for quite a bit and seeing the setting I was dining in, and knowing that it was Disney made me have a somewhat high expectation for the food.\\n\\nAs we were being seated we were lead to the right, past the ballroom into the newer section which was Belle's Library. It didn't give me that \\"oooh-ahh\\" feeling as if we were to dine in the West Wing or even the ballroom but it felt like we were dining in a cafeteria and for the price, it definitely was not that. \\n\\nWhen we received the menu, there wasn't a huge selection it was very limited. I ended up ordering the salad and chicken while my husband had the french onion soup and pork chop. Both were pretty sub par and the other family members ordered the shrimp & scallops and the chicken as well and felt the same. Service was meh, I can't recall when I saw him.lol\\n\\nWhen the food arrived it looked good, but my chicken and most meals were lukewarm. It felt like what they offered for dinner was lacking in taste and somewhat in quality. Sad to say, I came out pretty disappointed, although our son had the kids Grilled Steak and that was pretty good!. We all had desserts and I had the strawberry cream cheese cupcake. I'd say, it's not really a cupcake but like angel food cake in a cup...cake wrapper.\\n\\nWhile we were dining we were able to catch a glimpse of our host, the Beast himself. He would pop in the doorway and wave for a few seconds and then disappear. Although after finishing our dinner, we were able to go by each room to look around and before heading out we were able to take a picture with the Beast in a small room.\\n\\nOverall I was happy for the experience but I would rather dine where the kids get more interaction with the characters, like the Crystal Palace. But I will say, check out this restaurant for lunch as the quick service seems to be a better experience, from what my sister in law says.

I would try it again maybe for lunch, and just because it is Disney. \\n\\nObviously, this review was just my experience, hopefully next time it will be better!.

I didn't eat in, so this is based off the delivery and the stuff I got based off of that so mostly focused on food. I mean, lets put it this way:\\n\\nI didn't finish my cannoli. \\n\\nAnyone who has read any of my Italian restaurant reviews know how much I love cannoli. But I didn't even finish my cannoli. So, I guess, here goes my description of the food:\\n\\nI got some breaded shrooms. No sauce--but hey, that's fine, maybe the shrooms stand up to life on their own, I think to myself -- before I take a bite. The breading is soggy (which, okay, it's fried food delivered to a hotel, of course it's going to be soggy), and SUPER salty. To the point that I immediately had to take a swig of my water because the salt literally overwhelmed anything else in my mouth. I took a shroom out of the breading, and found out that the shrooms themselves are also overwhelmed with salt, so it's like two just...totally salt-laden things in one.\\n\\nSecond I got the spaghetti with meatballs. Turns out that I didn't get spaghetti--but penne. Which, okay, maybe that's nitpicky. The sauce was...well, the sauce had a lot of red pepper seed in it to make it spicy hot, which I'm okay with, but was so extreme it masked any other flavor that may have been there (which maybe I should be grateful for considering all the other foods).  The noodles all clung together, the sauce was disgusting, and the meatballs were all gristle. I'd take a bite, and end up having to spit it out because it was just--so full of gristle. So...that was disgusting.\\n\\nAnd the cannoli. My beloved cannoli. I opened it, and was like \\"Well, this actually looks like a cannoli should,\\" and when I picked it up, I thought everything seemed good. But then I took a bite, and...well, the chocolate chips had melted in to the cream in a weird sort of...globule, and in my first bite, I literally got  what must have been half a teaspoon of nutmeg into one bite, so thick and -- ugh. I put it down, drank a lot of water, and then I decided to give it another bite hoping it might just be a bad thing. Took a bite. And nope--another wad of nutmeg. (Or cinnamon, or something, the flavor was so overwhelming I couldn't manage it).\\n\\nI didn't finish a single thing I got. I didn't even get halfway through a single thing I got.

Also, the service is pretty bad; they rarely mess up orders, but they perform their work without enthusiasm and a general appreciation for the customer.

I've had about 1/2 of the flavors and I've liked all of them. The french toast bagel is a guilty pleasure that comes out more like a dessert. The bagel sandwiches are fantastic too, and are loaded with fresh veggies and toppings. \\n\\nThe bagels are made on site and are really good. In addition, the prices are really cheap. A bagel with cream cheese is less than $2, and a bagel sandwich is around $5.50.

The Tay-Doi was just the way my poh-poh use to make it -crispy on the outside and soft on the inside with just the right amount of red bean on the inside.  The egg tart was also exceptional. Three nice size tarts with warm sweet custard in a flakey shell. We also had the rice noodle roll filled with an ample amount of shrimp. You could taste the freshness of the rice noodle by the smoothness of the noodle. Then there was my favorite dim sum dish, tofu skin roll, that was well stuffed with pork/veggy filling rather than just tofu skin. \\n\\nConcerning service, as a Chinese American, my experience is to not expect much in the way of service at Chinese restaurant.  We go to Chinese restaurants for the food, not the service or the atmosphere. However, at Continental Seafood, not only was the food exceptional, but the service was better than expected!

On the other hand,  it probably makes you happy if you're in trying to eat a quick sandwich with a friend.  \\n\\nSecond,  I went on a Sunday during a very busy time and ordered a cappuccino (or, more accurately, I had Sarah G. order one for me--gotta love weaseling a free drink out of your significant other).  After waiting in front of the drink station and seeing person after person get their drink after me for 15-20 minutes I asked the barista if there was a cappaccino for Sarah being made.  She said no but very quickly made one for me.  I understand that things get backed up, but if you see a customer waiting  for that long clearly in need of a caffeine fix, I'd maybe appreciate a quick \\"are you waiting on a drink sir?\\"  Maybe I'm just spoiled.\\n\\nAs a disclaimer, I have not eaten here, and the sandwiches do look quite good.

We get in line behind a Mandarin speaking customer. He orders his drink in Mandarin and I notice that said employee is fluent in Mandarin (Sidebar: this seemingly inconsequential detail seems extraneous-- I know-- but will provide context later). Ok, so my friend and I order two drinks in English. I get taro and my friend order roast milk tea. Employee nods along in English, confirms the order. We pay. Give a one dollar cash tip. All is fine. We wait 6 minutes.\\n\\nOur drinks are ready! Yay! I walk to the counter.\\n\\nEmployee serves up one taro and one milk tea (sans \\"roast). I read the label and one of the drinks was incorrect, so I calmly advise in a very polite manner (in English) that \\"I believed that we ordered roast milk tea.\\" Employee immediately overreacts in tone, mannerism, and volume. Curtly says \\"THAT'S NOT WHAT YOU ORDERED.\\" \\n\\nWhaaat?? I thought to myself-- how could what I said elicited such a hostile response? Afterall, I thought to myself: \\"roast milk tea\\" and \\"milk tea,\\" could have been miscommunicated or misheard, no big deal. Simple mix up, right? Could have been a communication or language issue, I thought. Great, let me try communicating this again. So, being a reasonable human being and a paying customer, I try again, this time, slower and more articulated because I thought employee Dude could have had poor language issues and didn't hear me correctly: \\"Hmmm... so...  I think we ordered roast milk tea, not regular milk tea... do you think we can get the roast...\\"  I get CUT OFF by Dude with hostility again! Dude interjects: \\"That's NOT what I heard! You should have CHECKED when you ordered!!!\\" \\n\\nAt this point, several things are clear. First, Dude doesn't have a language issue. He heard me quite correctly. Second, Dude has an attitude problem: he has decided not to accept the possibility that he made the wrong drink when he has, in fact, made the wrong drink. [Sidebar: so that early detail about the possibility of language issues earlier was relevant in that it shows that I gave the Dude the benefit of the doubt of miscommunication or miscomprehension]\\n\\nWe argue back and forth for a minute arguing about who heard what and who said what. Since Dude was being majorly boorish, I looked around to see if other customers heard what was happening to try to get some empathy from other customers who have overheard the entire thing; sadly, no one was paying attention (womp womp, no one cares when you need them to!). \\n\\nThis story didn't end well. We end up walking away with only one correct drink. In sum, you might like this place if you like to:\\n\\n(1) Engage in an argument with an employee that will try to fight tooth and nail for a $3 tea made wrong due to no fault of your own;\\n\\n(2) Observe or even participate in a case study of what NOT to do with your customer when you run a business.\\n\\nPure.\\nUnmitigated. \\nIntemperance. \\n\\nWon't be going back.

My friend Carrie and I ordered a bunch of appetizers and small plates, and it worked out to be more reasonable than two dinner plates AND we got to try more ! It was great!\\n\\nSo here goes, in no particular order:\\n\\n1. Service - excellent. Our waiter was friendly, helpful and attentive. He had a \\"waitress in training\\" with him, and she also pitched in, and was very friendly and helpful. We were seated immediately on the patio on a lovely evening.\\n\\n2. Drinks - my friend and I had the sangria. White wine, red wine, grand marnier, and fruit. Don't know what fruit, but it was good!\\n\\n3. Food -\\na. Flatbread with the avocado skordalia - basically imagine avocado/garlic/potato/pine nut puree.... SUPER tasty, and the flat bread was perfection\\nb. Pork pincholita (sp) - grilled marinated pork skewers. Perfectly cooked, wonderful flavor. Perfect in their simplicity.\\nc. Fennel sausage on flatbread - came garnished with a green herb (cilantro? lemongrass? chives?) and apples (!) - perfectly cooked, with melted cheese. Large portion! Amazingly good!\\nd. Fried goat cheese with honey and red onion jam/garnish - THIS SHOULD BE ILLEGAL IN THE LOWER 48 STATES. Seriously - you could cause world peace by sitting everyone down and having them eat this. Tangy goat cheese, crispy tender crust, perfect honey, the red onions were carmelized to perfection. Amazing, simply amazing.\\nd. Bittersweet chocolate cake with vanilla creme and chocolate sauce - there was sea salt as a garnish - and MMMMMMMMMMM GOOD! Whowouldathunkit? Apparently the chef did. Amazing. Not too sweet, but O SO CHOCOLATEY.\\n\\n4. Location - lovely, convenient, beautiful part of town. Bonus points for the parking garage.\\n\\nAll in all.... amazing. Best bistro / gourmet food I've had in a while, and not at a too outstanding price. Before the gift certificate, our total was $55... not bad for 4 plates and 4 drinks and dessert. And we walked out happy and not over-full.\\n\\nSo, I give this place 4.5 stars. The -0.5 is only because the seating is uncomfortable in places - if you have a big ass or purse - or are just bigger - its hard to squeeze into the place comfortably.

No congealed cubes of pig's blood, no pig's feet--though there appeared to be an occasional piece of ankle.\\n\\n* Vermicelli Combo (#51) -- Loved it!  It's not a hard dish to mess up, but golly.  It was the perfect dish to snuggle up to on a cold, rainy Sunday evening.  Eating this combo felt like getting a tangy, chewy, meaty hug.

Not the best prospects for a one-week trip.\\n\\nUndaunted, my dad and I decided to arrive when they opened at 5:30 to try to grab the limited walk-in seating (two 2-tops) they have.  This was an excellent idea.  Unfortunately, several other people were slightly smarter and had already lined up by 5:20.  So we missed a table, but managed to score seats at the bar.\\n\\nThe extensive wine menu had lists of bottles from various countries and regions, but with just the two of us we decided we wanted to sample more than one.  The bartender offered us something called a tajut, which apparently meant a half-glass.  I haven't seent his offered anywhere else, but it was very nice.  I tried a few, including a tasty Nero d'Avola, an Italian type I'd had once before, and a German Riesling.\\n\\nThe menu is broken into three courses - Salumi, Primi, and Secondi.  There were only a few options for the first course.  We split a \\"Frico Caldo,\\" which was a sort of potato cake with cheese, topped with what tasted like a lemon-shallot vinaigrette.  Fairly good, I thought, but not extraordinary.  They brought some bread as well, slices of the standard soft, sweet dinner loaf one usually sees.  Again, decent, though the butter accompanying it was at room temperature, a minor detail that so many restaurants manage to get wrong.\\n\\nThe second course, now, that was divine.  There were several choices for this, plus they offered half-portions of the main course pasta dishes as \\"primis\\" as well.  I chose the \\"Toc,\\" a very rich dish consisting of polenta cooked with milk and cream instead of water, giving it more of a porridge-y texture.  It was topped with what they called Escolar \\"Conserva,\\" which is white fish that is cooked, then soaked in garlic-herb oil for a week or two, plus some crushed egg.  The flavors went together wonderfully, and the fish itself was outstanding.\\n\\nFor his primi, my dad chose a half order of a pasta dish called \\"Riso Superfino Carnaroli,\\" which was risotto with Maine diver scallops topped with a pickled green tomato gazpacho.  The scallops were lightly seared but very tender, perfectly cooked.  My dad said the sauce tasted similar to Antoine's Rockefeller sauce (a famous old New Orleans restaurant).  Very good, and quite a bit lighter than my dish.\\n\\nFor the main course, I chose the roasted Atlantic halibut, which was served with carrot puree and pea shoots.  It was well cooked, with delicate flavors that went well with the wine.  My dad, however, was the winner on this course.  He opted for the sliced pork leg with fingerling potatoes, cipollini onions and cherries, topped with some jus.  This was incredible.  I stole as many bites of his as I could; it was just that good.\\n\\nThe portion sizes seemed fairly reasonable, leaving us room for dessert.  (As if there's ever not enough room for it...)  We split the huckleberry torte, a chocolate cake with vanilla bean buttercream and huckleberries served with a side of valrhona dark chocolate gelato.  We both love chocolate, so we couldn't really have picked anything else.  The torte was good, but that house-made gelato was the winner for me.  I wish ice cream always tasted that good.\\n\\nThe service was impeccable the whole time.  The staff offered suggestions on the wine and food, but weren't pushy or overbearing at all.  We had at least four people helping or talking to us at various times.  It was a really great experience.\\n\\nI highly recommend this place to anyone.  It isn't cheap, but you are getting what you pay for with food and service of this quality."},{"name":"Sweet Carrot","address":"1417 W 5th Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"I took my family of four late on a Friday.

If you need a family friendly brunch shop, this is the place. Families everywhere. Kids everywhere.

I think it's the carpeting in Cantina Laredo, or maybe the booth/combination booth and tables near the U shaped bar. I don't know, I just feel like I'm in the restaurant of a hotel. Not the best feeling in downtown Austin, but okay if you're lugging around kiddos. \\n\\nThe mexican food includes beef and chicken fajitas, migas, some other tex-mex egg options, made to order omeletes, and some carby sides I can't remember. It's not bad Mexican food, it's just Mexican food from a franchise. The bloody mary is okay. The mimosa is good. The bartender recommended the skinny margarita. I tried it. It is okay. It is 11 dollars. That is not okay. Waaaaay overpriced.  I really enjoy the watermelon agua fresca.

Out of those ten, I have ordered the same dish 7 times. It is NEVER the same. Sometimes, it's perfect. Sometimes, slightly underseasoned. Sometimes the broth is deep and flavorful. Other times, it's like dishwater in a bowl.  Sometimes there's a lime, sometimes there isn't. I can never say what I am going to get till I get it.  I keep coming back because there is very little competition in the area and the hope that these are just opening kinks they are working out.\\n\\nFor gluten-free folks, they do offer a lot of options. So, that's a positive. I did have one mediocre discussion with a manager. One time, I ordered the GF option on their ramen. It was literally water - no flavor, no nothing. I complained to the manager and his response was, \\"Well, with GF, we have to take out everything that gives the ramen flavor.\\" First, this isn't true - I had the GF option before and it was great. But, second, if it's going to suck as GF, please don't serve it. He did comp my meal though so that was positive.\\n\\nI don't know if I will keep hoping or eventually give up...

The pimento cheese \\"spread\\" (see the show for details) was outstanding, not yo' momma's pimento cheese, please!  And even though I am getting really tired of Stumptown coffee, this brew was not acidy at all, smooth and less bitter than most around town.  I wanna like Stumptown coffee, I do I do!

Reading the reviews gave me a good idea of what to order - their pho beef satae, one of their spicier items, and a mango shake to help balance the heat.  Would have gotten spring rolls, but dinner prices are a bit more than lunch prices.\\n\\nThe pho was pretty amazing, definitely a broth full of flavor and with enough kick to loosen my sinuses and make me start sweating within two spoonfulls - and that's without sriracha, btw.  Sadly, my tongue was not quite as cast-iron as I had thought, and a few more spoonfulls later I realized I had to compromise.  Two 'round-the-bowl squirts of hoisin later and the broth still had a great kick, but now had a nice sweetened taste to balance it.  The noodles and meat and random other veggies in the pho were delicious, and the mango shake was thick and refreshing.\\n\\nA special nod has to go to the service I received, which honestly went above and beyond what I've had at any other pho restaurant.  As soon as I walked in the door, the waitress grabbed a menu and directed me to a table.  When I finished leafing through the menu, I looked up and she came right over to take my order.  The food came out not 5 minutes later.  Had to ask for a napkin, but she apologized for not brining one over earlier and brought it right away.

I sat at the bar and started with a nice glass os ros√© and an appetizer of shredded pork on toasted baguette. It was fine, portion was good, the pork had a nice cinnamon flavor but it was a little bland.\\n\\nNext I had the pappardelle with lamb. Once again, I have to say it was a little bland, it had chiles and goat cheese in it and seemed better suited to a fall or winter menu than a summer menu. The presentation was a little lacking, I thought it could use a sprinkle of color but the noodles were great, chewy and a little firm, the portion size was great for $10 too. I switched over to the pinot noir, a little pricey at $12 a glass but delicious and the bartender was happy to let me try all the wines on the list before I settled on the pinot. \\n\\nI tried some other small plates and simply didn't try anything I found to really excite me. I sent my salad back because it was far too acidic but it was no problem to have it removed from my bill. All in all, for $70 for one person, I didn't think it was the greatest meal but I think it would be a fantastic place to go for drinks and appetizers.

The wife and I decided to each get one of the Pine State staples and share. She got the Reggie and I had an Eightball with a side of scrambled eggs. I have to say that the fried chicken on the Reggie was the star of that brunch, but I was impressed by the side of eggs. It was plentiful and cooked just the way I like 'em.\\n\\nI personally think that the prices are a little high for the amount of food you get.

An example of this was the fatty lamb, which was so fatty, fat was squirting out across my plate when I tried to cut it in an almost comical way. Maybe their butcher was having a bad day? But that combined with the highly oiled bed it was on made it all less than appealing.\\n\\nOther times, the idea behind the recipe seemed solid, but the execution took a lot away from it.

It was karaoke that brought me in on a Tuesday night at 10pm, driving all the way out to NE Portland after picking up my date in Beaverton. Set up in an old bowling alley (from whence it takes its name, presumably) the Spare Room is the very embodiment of a dive bar. (Beers on tap: 3. Two of which are Bud Light and Pabst.)\\n\\nIt's a label they have claimed and made their own, however, and they wear it proudly. My date, seeking to recreate a drink of her own creation, asked if they had any raspberry puree. The bartender replied, \\"We're kind of a dive bar, honey.\\" As such, the replacement vodka lemonade arrived in due time and, wow, was it a kick in the pants. A glass of vodka with a shot of lemonade. It was enough to make my date overcome her nerves and actually get up and belt out some Adele on the karaoke floor, so mad props to the bartender for making that happen.\\n\\nPortland is an interesting town: a living, breathing dichotomy of foodies and mixologists who are inherently too casual and don't actually want to ever dress up or work too hard. Perhaps this is why we have so many fantastic dive bars. The Spare Room, I can safely say, is the monarch of such establishments, offering an expansive kingdom that includes two bars (one might not actually be operational), a large dining area, stage, and dance floor. Its denizens hail from all walks of life, representing various ages, creeds, colors, and vocal abilities. If you've never been there before, its seeming attitude of willful ignorance toward all things classy may initially strike you as unsettling--but you will quickly warm up to its nonchalant charm. And by your second vodka lemonade, the large, bearded man to your left is suddenly your best friend. He will then grace you with a rendition of Barry White's \\"You're the First, the Last, My Everything\\" that will restore your faith in the human spirit.\\n\\nTruthfully, I have never been so impressed with a place that was trying so little to impress me.

I was afraid to try the slush because I was thinking it was going to be a nasty sugar water concoction like from 7-11, boy was I wrong!  I can't really describe it beyond that it was perfect.

They have menu's located both inside and outside. We were looking at the outside menu's and were asked if we needed any guidance with what to order. Once we came inside to place our order, the staff were again helpful and attentive. \\n\\n2nd Star - The atmosphere is very nice. Lime is located in the middle of Winter Park Village. It's the perfect place for a casual dinner before a movie or a great spot to grab a bite and people watch. There are a large amount of tables so finding seating is not a problem. \\n\\n3rd Star - Quality of food for the price. We went on a Friday night and made it just in time for happy hour (4-7pm BOGO adult beverages) which was a nice surprise. Their menu is very affordable. I had three taco's for $6.99 - can't be beat. Also, all orders come with bottomless chips. There are not a lot of chips served with the meal, but the meals are filling and I didn't see the lack of chips to be a problem. \\n\\n4th Star - The salsa bar is a wonderful service to provide for customers. I enjoyed the salsa bar a lot. They have quite a variety and everything we tried was delicious. They also had large to-take-with-you cups so you had enough for your whole meal. \\n\\n\\nAlthough I love, love, love hot sauce with my taco's I didn't care for how they had their hot sauce displayed. They weren't organized by type or flavor. The hot sauce bottles were sticky and I wasn't sure if you were allowed to take them to your seat or if you were supposed to bring your food there. \\n\\nAll in all, Lime was a wonderful dining experience and I'll definitely come back again with more friends."},{"name":"The Medford Deli","address":"460 High St","city":"Medford","stars":"4","text":"Hmm I love this deli and am a bit puzzled by the reviews about the bad service.

What a wonderful place this is the staff were all very friendly and our waitress Doreena was the most hospitable and accommodating. We started off with cocktails and Dynamite Scallops as an appetizer,they were very tasty and the basil drizzle was a perfect compliment. Our entree was the Mixed Seafood Grill this gave us a sampling of Grilled Citrus Salmon, Shrimp Scampi and a Jumbo Lump Crab Cake the three were sided with Golden Yukon Potatoes and Grilled Asparagus. These were a perfect combination and made for a wonderful meal. We shared their signature desert of Hot Chocolate Lava Cake it was absolutely decadent in richness and complimented with vanilla ice cream and crushed Heath bar. \\nThe place has a wonderful old world decor with wooden floors and large ceiling beams, that comes with a 200+ Yr old building, but still gives provides you with the comfortable relaxed setting to enjoy a special dinner.\\nThis is one place we would definitely recommend to anyone making the trip to Boston."},{"name":"Barney Fanning's","address":"99 Broad St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Great place to have a drink and eat!

Was kinda hard to put in place.  It wasn't fancy but it had this fancy uppity vibe to it.  They have tons of drinks and different whiskeys and bourbons. They told us a wait for a table was going to be 45 min but ended up to be about 15-20! Cool! So we got some cocktails and then we sat down pretty fast.  We were stoked.  Unless you know a shit ton about food and flavors. the menu is a bit intimidating.  but being in the service industry myself, I figured our server would be happy to help explain things.  The server didnt come by for a while.  someone came by and gave us water. then we waited. more.  Finally he came and asked if we wanted apps.  So we put those in.  He wasnt very personable and wasnt friendly.  I tried asking him questions but he wasnt good at explaining any of the ingredients.  Also, I know it sounds stupid to say they dont have black napkins, but they dont.  I never knew it was such a big deal til I wore black pants out and used a white napkin! eww lint everywhere! So I am glad the restaurant I work at has black napkins. but the level of fanciness here made me think theyd have some but they didnt.  We got asparagus app, and almonds and olives.  Everything was good! I ordered the squid ink pasta which had chorizo in it.  I should have asked a bit more about it because the chorizo was very strong flavor and the scallops were microscopic.  I thought maybe they'd be the nice big ones.  So the chorizo was overpowering.  I was debating between the halibut and the pasta and the server coulda mentioned the strongness of the chorizo. so enough about the chorizo! haha. my friends got another pasta that had wild boar in it and I wish I got that! I mean, pork is the shit in anything! I shoulda known.  So Over all the food was good. I think the server coulda been more helpful.  I suggest you go there for happy hour and sit at the bar.

I lived right up the street till recently. It's the perfect place to go after I get out of work from the Farber and want a drink and/or food. Their menu has changed recently, and it's for the better I think. They have weekly specials now and a lot more variety on their menu. Favorites include their fish and chips, nachos (ask any of my friends and they would tell you I usually get nachos and a beer), brushetta, mini sliders, and sweet potato fries. I mean, I basically like everything there but these seem to be the ones I order regularly. I'm very health conscious can't you tell? I'm a huge beer person so I love the fact that they have a pretty good selection. It rotates frequently, which has allowed me to try so many different beers over the past 3 years.\\n\\nThe staff is amazing and will take care of you when you're there. It's a fantastic spot right after work. It's like 95% Longwood medical area folks. It's casual, as you will usually see more people in scrubs than not. And their brunch??? Love it. I rolled out of bed quite a few times to come for brunch when I hadn't had time to go grocery shopping. Come to think of it, I did this for dinner too.\\n\\nI can safely say I've been here 50+ times, but realistically I know it's probably way more.

The shrimp was a bit too thin on the siracha sauce, no doubt from fear of molesting the timid American palate. \\n\\nThe fried chicken five-spice nuggets are amazing. A must order. Hot and sour soup was good, but the flavors clashed with the rest of the items we were sampling. I recommend diving into a bowl, finishing it and then moving on to the rest of the meal. \\n\\nThe owners are SUPER nice - a father and two son team.

Your jacket WILL smell like Mexican food for a week after your visit. We went for a friend's birthday before seeing a movie at the AMC. Even though they were busy, we got a table fairly quickly. We brought our own cake, and the waiter was more than willing to allow us to store it in their refrigerator while we ate. We ordered chips with queso and guacamole before we realized that there were complimentary chips and salsa. What took so long to bring those over??  Like another reviewer mentioned, I wish the fajitas were served 'sizzling' on a hot skillet for the sake of authenticity. Either way, the steak was delicious, though the meager portion of pico de gallo was not even enough for one tortilla. Our waiter was slow to refill waters, but I drink like a camel so he's partially forgiven. The margaritas were strong! The men's room was supposedly out of order and there was a huge line to use the single-person handicapped bathroom. Some guys used the men's room anyway: \\"didn't notice anything wrong in there\\" someone said as they strutted on by me while I waited 15 minutes. The manager was nice.

This restaurant might seem like it would be formal and fancy but it is more of a cafeteria style restaurant if that makes any sense you grab your own drink and silverware. The decor is another story, it is absolutely BEAUTIFUL! you seat yourself so we choose the rose gallery it was amazing it felt like the real thing.

He told me no, you can't make a reservation unless it's 2 hours in advance, and offered no resolution. I then asked if there was even a wait to sit outside, and he told me no. Okay.. that would have been nice to know when you told me I couldn't make a reservation and we considered going somewhere else..\\nOverall though the food was good, we ordered about 6 sushi rolls.

The food is great! In my opinion the best hot pot in Boston, comparable to the authentic ones in China. \\nI'm writing this review as I sit in the restaurant finishing up my meal. So upsetting that I couldn't wait to write the review. Basically after a very satisfying meal, my friends looked for deserts. The server simply told us that the kitchen was closed. From my perspective, why weren't we given a warning that we can't order food any more.\\nKindly a Chinese waiter recommended that we tried out the cotton candy in the front. Then we asked our waiter Denis again to teach us how to use the machine to make candy. It took him a long while until he finally gave us some sugar, but told us that we can try it out on our on. ( we asked for sugar three times)\\nWe tried and we failed. We came back to the table. Until we finally had Denis again to check out what's going on with that machine, he came to it and simply said (in not so patient manner) that we poured in too much sugar, it won't work any more. Well, we then apologized for not knowing how to use it properly, and asked for help to make it work. His answer was simply we messed it up. The only way to fix it is to wash the machine, and he won't do it until they close for the night. So the answer has no value to us as customers, as end result is that we dont get desert and we can't use the candy machine. My problem is that his attitude is just so wrong! Almost like as customers, we have to do our best to accommodate his work style in order to get what we want. \\n\\nIf only the service was better, I would recommend this place.

Dreadful.  Yes, I guess I'm being too subtle, but those are the first words that leap to mind.  Like another reviewer here, I used to really like breakfast at the former Grove Inn (where this place is currently located), and apparently so did many other people. because it was always pretty hopping.  My boyfriend and I decided to give this place a shot, even though we should have suspected something was up when we walked past it yesterday morning and it was 100% empty (on a beautiful Saturday morning on Denman Street!).  \\n\\nToday we went there for breakfast.  Now, before I write what I'm going to say next, I thought maybe breakfast was simply not their \\"forte\\" (that's being kind) and specialized in the other items on the menu.  Apparently not, because every Yelp review here hates the place--they can't do ANYTHING RIGHT.  \\n\\nThe place is expensive as all hell considering the quality of their fare, and should be ashamed of itself for charging the prices they do.  My boyfriend ordered the $11 pancake patter--a LOT of money to charge, so we reckoned it would come with a stack of hotcakes, a plateful of food, etc.  Nope!  What he received were TWO (count 'em) very small, bland pancakes, two little breakfast links, and two rubbery, poorly-made eggs that weren't even free-range (for that price, they should be).  That's it!  All on a large plastic plate.  Eleven dollars!  No toast, no hashbrowns, just those few items, and not even that good.  Again: this was an eleven-dollar \\"pancake platter\\" that, at most, should have cost $3.95.\\n\\nI didn't want breakfast food, so I got a tuna fish sandwich that came with either fries or a salad (it took about 2 full minutes of speaking with the server to convey which one I wanted).  The sandwich was literally sliding apart because of the quantity of mayo oozing out of it, with barely-discernible tuna fish mixed in there.  The sandwich was ininexplicably garnished with two slices of strawberry.  My salad was hilarious: a tiny dish of iceberg lettuce, some minced cucumber pieces, 4 tiny silvers of carrot, and 4 tiny slivers of tomato--not even chunks, SLIVERS.  This winner was a grand total of $7.  I munched my way through the \\"salad\\" and managed two bites of sandwich before I took it home.  The server actually put the untouched strawberries right on top of my sandwich after she packed it up.  The sandwich is still in my fridge--after reading some reviews, I'm terrified I'll get food poisoning.\\n\\nThey use cheap plastic plates and bowls and cups and this only enhances the ghastly experience.  \\n\\nSo, Sunday morning breakfast was a disaster at Fusion Bay.

Tiny portions that are more like tapas?  Mainly raw?  A selection for vegetarians/gluten free?  Gastropub offerings?  Fanciness?  Well... to be honest, this restaurant has it all, which leaves me a little confused about who its trying to please, but from what I saw, I think this restaurant really could please all palates (sorry, actually not sure about gluten free).  Now, the waitress said that food would come out when it became ready ... and based on what we ordered, it would have been terrible if it came in any other order (maybe restaurant needs to be intentional about this).  Also, we were told to plan to sharing dishes.

Nice snack starters if you're looking for small bites to satiate while you wait.\\n\\nPLATES:  More pricey, more food than apps side of the menu.  Fried smelts, mackerel \\"fried rice,\\" plates go for $14-20.  We shared the fried rice, which was more mackerel than rice, but was beautifully presented and filled with some nice umami-rich flavors (miso).\\n\\nPIZZA: 12-inch at $15-18.  Good selection of flavors, seafood featured... if you're in that kind of mood\\n\\nPASTA:  If you know how much I love pasta... then you'd understand what I mean when I say it's a solid portion for a Shaina sized meal (if I were to eat it without other dishes); but because these are intended to be shared, the $22 price for the uni bucatini (DELICIOUS and loaded with buttery yum) wasn't so bad.\\n\\nROASTS:  Okay, maybe it's a bit aggressive to spring for the $75 lamb shoulder or the $55 branzino, but if you're feeding 3 people, these dishes would be the right way to go.  Dave and I ordered the 10 oz rib eye, which was the right size with a ton of fries ($36).  Would have been fine without the other orders, but we wanted to try a bunch of flavors.\\n\\nWINE:  if you're really going for flair, you can get caviar service and order from their wine reserve menu consisting of wines marked-up to $140+ per bottle.\\n\\nBEER/COCKTAILS:  More expensive side... $13 cocktails.  $7-10 beers.... Risky move.  But then again, it's Cambridge.\\n\\nOur food in order was:  ME oysters, mackerel fried rice, Uni bucatini, and steak; no dessert because we were full and we were 2 hours into the meal.

Neverland is an adorable tea room, complete with pretty chandeliers and a large variety of antique tea cups and saucers. The tea salon itself is has a decent amount of tables, but in such a high traffic location it is highly recommended that you make a reservation. Each reservation is for 1.5 hours of table time, which I assure you is more than enough time to have a relaxed high tea. The waitresses are quite good here, so you won't feel ignored. \\n\\nThe high tea itself costs $38, and comes with five savoury finger sandwiches, 4 pastries, and a scone with jam and Devonshire cream. During the holidays, you could upgrade the high tea to a bubbly high tea for $5, which meant your tea came with a glass of prosecco or sparkling rose. The standout savoury sandwiches on the holiday high tea platter (and are thankfully on the regular high tea menu as well) are the slow roasted pulled pork and the spanish grilled cheese. I would have happily eaten a meal size version of either sandwich. I thought the pastries were okay, but they were definitely out-shined by the finger sandwiches and the scone.\\n\\nA huge bonus of going to Neverland Tea Salon is the never ending tea. You can order as much tea as you would like during your seating. Neverland brews the tea for you and delivers it in an adorable silver kettle, so you don't have to worry about your tea being over-steeped. You are also able to try different tea flavours during your seating, so don't feel limited to just one! The waitresses are also really good at getting you a new cup when you switch teas. I tried both \\"Berry Me In Champagne\\" and \\"Peter's Promise\\", both of which were very good. \\n\\nIf I had any complaints about the high tea, it is that the amount of food you get feels significantly less than other places (particularly La Petite Cuillere and the Fairmont Vancouver Airport). All three of our high tea servings came on one tray, which would indicate the portions are quite small. While they do make up for it in richness, I felt a bit disappointed, especially given the higher cost (equivalent high tea's in Vancouver are between $25-35). \\n\\nAnother downside of the Neverland Tea Salon (although not really their fault) is the parking situation. Since it is located in such a high traffic area of Kitsilano, your options are metered street parking, or the parkade a block east on West 8th avenue. We ended up being 10 minutes late for our reservation because we couldn't find parking (which is how we learned about the parkade), but the waitress said this is very, very common. If you take transit this isn't an issue, but it is something to note.\\n\\nI really liked Neverland Tea Salon, and I think their unlimited tea deal is brilliant. I would recommend checking it out for a nice afternoon."},{"name":"Lombardi's Seafood","address":"1152 Harmon Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4.5","text":"Great customer service, and always a good selection of fresh fish.

Go when you wanna treat yourself to something nicer than a $10 golden corral meal.\\n\\nThoughts on other reviews. \\nWell done: My meat was not all well done (hehe, my meat). I like to eat medium rare and most of my meat was given to me medium like. If it came well done on the outside slices, I just keep asking for slices until I get the raw-er inner slices. They came by every 3 minutes and after 1 hour, I basically ate all the types of meats I could handle. So, i was happy with the rate of meat given. \\nBad service:  The service and guys are a bit nicer than Fogo. Here's why i think so. At Fogo, if I request an extra slice, they all do that split second hesitation, sigh, and then give you a slice. At red/green, if I said to give me the entire skewer of filet mignon....they do it, happily! no joke. When the guys came, we would ask them to go ahead and slide off all the meat on the skewer to us.

All I get is a plate full of jalapeno peppers and eat meat till I pass out. Quailty is less than Fogo.

Ate a lot and drank a lot of beer both times - late evening mid-week, alone.\\nThe good:  Wait-staff (mostly);  GREAT beer selection;  Pretty good food & quick;  Decor;  Atmosphere;  Clean.\\nThe bad:  Overall customer-service (billing, restroom, food shortage, beer service, lacking coat rack/hooks), mildly over-priced food (entrees) & beer.\\nSpecifics.  Waitresses are zippy & attentive yet not personable/friendly.  Mashed potatoes:  How can an Irish-themed joint (large shamrocks floor to ceiling) run out of mashed potatoes - a few days before St. Patrick's Day!?  There's a Stop & Shop across the street!!  I wasn't even offered a reduced price for having to settle for rice instead of MPs.  (I was informed of the calamity only after a couple and an appetizer;  I believe the waitress' claim the timing was the kitchen's fault.)  Late evening, some appetizers are offered at reduced prices;  but don't count on being billed the reduced price.  (The computer's fault.)  The men's room's sink's faucet needs several adjustments:  one has to caress it for water - water that is non-aerated & freezing cold.  How could this be?  The staff and customers share the restroom.  Also, the MR is so small the hand-dryer is above the sink.  The draft beers menu indicates price and % alcohol (ABV) for each (~20) yet indicates volume served only for certain/higher-ABV beers (~5; each, \\"12 oz\\").  That's right - the menu doesn't indicate volume served for most drafts.  The first night, upon my inquiring, my server informed me all the drafts are 12 oz.  And indeed they were - each one (incl. higher ABV) came in a thick-walled, ultra-thick-bottomed 13 oz. mixing glass (I know my pub glasses).  The next night (different server and bar-tender):  chaos.  The server and/or bar-tender gave me two different stories before sticking to their third!!  First, upon delivery of a higher ABV draft, when I noted the glass was different and smaller (tall, slender, stem, 10.5 oz), the server said the glass was 12 oz - like the mixing glass.  Second:  when I demurred, I got a redelivery - in the mixing glass (filled properly), a subtle/tacit admission that I was right, and an explanation:  the menu was wrong:  the higher ABV are 10 oz.  (The issue why I was getting - improperly - a 12 oz. higher ABV draft was not explicitly raised.)  Third:  upon ordering a second of the same higher ABV draft, my server informed me - after returning from the bar empty-handed - I had to have it in the stem glass because the stem was, in fact, 12 oz. whereas the mixing glass was, in fact, 16 oz.  I again demurred, of course, but was told that that's the way it was or I could speak with the bar-tender/manager.  So, I cancelled the draft and ordered a 12 oz bottle.  I got it with a mixing glass:  Perfect!!  I poured it and showed how perfectly it fit in the, \\"16 oz.\\" mixing glass.  My server concealed well - but not completely - her chagrin.  Yet another issue arose, however.  The bottle was way past (2 months) its, \\"drink by\\" date;  So I explained I would neither drink nor pay for it.  My server uttered doublespeak when I suggested asking the bar-tender for a fresher bottle.  (Perhaps she didn't want me at the bar educating staff about date codes.)  I let that faux pas go, though:  promptly ordering a bottle by a different brewer.  (It's my experience that bottles', \\"drink by\\"/\\"born on\\" dates are well-worth heeding.)\\n\\nThe joint has potential indeed.  It needs a 1-quart measuring cup, at least.

While the food was certainly good and the pleasant staff worked hard to replenish buffet items and keep things fresh, I have to say this is not a five * Indian restaurant.  There were two vegetable curry preparations, both tasty but not layered in flavor as outstanding Indian food is.  The chicken tikka masala was quite good but the sauce was sort of one dimensional.  The fish pakoras were basically fried tilapia pieces in a chick pea batter. Well done, but I'm not a fan of this often musty tasting fish.  The basmati rice was perfectly cooked.  Yellow lentil dal was spicy and one of the better dishes, at least to our taste.  The made to order Nan was very good, as were the veggie samosas.  Masala chai is included with the buffet which is a nice touch but it was not at all spiced... more like hot milk and tea. I've been to India so I was a bit disappointed with this restaurant based on the mostly glowing reviews.  Certainly not a bad choice... and maybe the cooked to order dishes at dinner are more nuanced and delicious. I wouldn't go out of my way, but if I was in Woburn at lunch or dinner time might stop there again. I would rate this a B to B+.  For $8.95 the buffet is a very fair deal."},{"name":"Sweet Carrot","address":"1417 W 5th Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"So here's the deal there's a bunch of positive here and one, very specific negative.

It was a bagel crisp cracker with smoked salmon and a dab of cream.  Amazing. We split a scallop and potato appetizer that had green apple. It was delicious. The 3 breads were homemade--sour dough, cheese, and pretzel. I tried each and had seconds on the cheese puff. We each ordered the dover sole in a croissant pastry stuffed with lobster and scallop, served with green peas and mushrooms. It was good, but not great.

Parking is valet at the St Regis Hotel (the restaurant is on their 2nd floor and is lovely in an old school wealthy way) and once we validated our parking, it was $2 to park (which basically meant the valet got a $3 tip instead of the $5 I expected to tip him).

Never did it occur to me that it was a part of a chain, never mind a larger group (Landry's Inc.) that includes McCormick & Schmick's and Morton's (both of which I was aware were chains) among its companies.\\n\\nTheir Restaurant Week lunch menu ($20.14) was the draw for this inaugural visit.  Speaking of which, their RW menus (oh, make that Dine Out Boston, RW's new moniker beginning with Winter 2014) are upon request only, rather than being offered to all diners alike as at other establishments.\\n\\nThe weird thing was, I was given only the RW lunch menu and their oh so expensive dinner menu, although they do have a regular lunch time menu according to their website.  Mulling it over afterwards however, perhaps since I had asked for the RW menu, the hostess had provided the dinner menu only for the wine list on the back?  She did direct my attention over there upon seating me...\\n\\nService was quite pleasantly and politely provided by the youngest staffer in the room.  Unfortunately, however, the food wasn't quite up to par.\\n\\nThe clam chowder ($4.50 reg), though creamy and nicely filled with small diced potatoes and clams, was just too salty.  I ate but a few spoonfuls, and when I had the chance I mentioned it to my server.  He was appropriately apologetic (although it wasn't his personal fault, of course) and said he would let the kitchen know, however, nothing was otherwise done to improve the situation.  I wasn't sure if it was because he was relatively young (perhaps inexperienced?) or if perhaps this restaurant does not empower their staff?  I figure that an empowered staffer would have brought over or suggested another RW appetizer offering (in this case, the Chart House Chopped Salad, as they only had two options) to replace the basically uneaten, too salty chowder.\\n\\nAs I waited for an opportunity to discuss the high saline content of the chowder with my server, I noticed my entree sitting at the ledge by the kitchen.  By the time it was served to me, it had been resting there for a couple of minutes.  Fortunately, however, I found that the bun was still warm and the fries hot and crisp.  I couldn't say the same for the three sweet potato chips that were tossed in with the thin crisp fries - they were a bit leathery and put up a bit of a fight when I bit down on them.  Sad, since I so love sweet potatoes, but the delight from seeing them on the plate was turned into a severe disappointment upon consumption.  Either improve them, or omit them is my suggestion to Chart House.\\n\\nThe lobster roll (normally $20.99 at lunch) was tasty enough, and had some claw chunks intermingled with the more shredded flesh and a scattering of small diced celery.  The dressing was a bit thin and so dripped out some, but the lobster salad was separated from the bun by some lettuce.  That was smart, but it was quite a bit of lettuce rather than just a single large leaf, which I realized made for a smaller portion of the primary ingredient than I had initially estimated.\\n\\nThe entree was, however, the highlight of meal, as dessert was as stated (Mud Pie, Coffee flavored ice cream in a cookie crust, topped with homemade chocolate sauce and diced almonds), but nothing special.  It was also served with a spoon.  But since the crust was thick and rather hard to break at times, perhaps a fork would have been better.\\n\\nThe Chart House at three levels was quite large, and pleasant with white table clothes and lots of exposed wood & brick.  They have stairs, but due to the perceived age of the structure (and given that we are in Boston), I'm not sure if they have an elevator in the building.  It wasn't busy at lunch, and they had a high chair available for a neighboring party with kids and a baby.\\n\\n*** 3/2015 RW ***\\n\\nFor this RW lunchtime visit, I hesitantly inquired about the saltiness of their chowder, to which my nice but rather casual waiter said if I didn't like it, he could easily dump it.  Sampling it, I found it too salty for my taste (perhaps I just don't care for their particular recipe?) and my cup was easily swapped out for a plate of fresh caesar salad.  Though a bit overly dressed, it was much preferred of the two first course options.\\n\\nThe Chicken Romano - Parmesan breaded chicken topped with tomatoes and lemon shallot butter, served with grilled asparagus and garlic mashed potatoes - made for a pretty picture with the golden brown crust of the flattened chicken breast as the foundation for the red diced tomatoes and mound of skin on potatoes for the twin spears of green.  Other than noting that they were majorly skimping out on the asparagus, the dish was a tasty one, with the crisp breading a good contrast to the tender meat within.\\n\\nThe mud pie wasn't too frozen so it was a bit easier to poke at with the spoon.  But again, it wasn't anything special, so I wish they'd come up with a different sweet way to end their Dine Out Boston meal."},{"name":"Clyde Common","address":"1014 SW Stark St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"The beau and I stopped for drinks.

From first glance the views and the menu convinced me that I was going to be in for the brunch of my life...I was not.\\n\\nThe wait took very long and there were many open tables it was not until our party mentioned that we would squeeze an extra person for seating that we were finally sat. We were missing two sets of silverware, took awhile to even get those. Our order was taken and we waited an extremely long time for our food. When it finally arrived I began to eat my salad. The first few bites were pretty good until I saw something moving...\\n\\nIt was a large green bug with antennas in my salad. I screamed out loud and dropped my fork. This was not some bug that was flying around outside, it looked as if it had come from some place tropical. It was hard to get the attention of the wait staff over and they took away the plate. As they took away the plate they simply stated that it probably fell in the food as it was walked outside. I can assure you it did not. I watched as they brought the plate inside and I saw them laughing about the situation. I for one did not think this was funny at all.\\n\\nThe waiter came out and offered me another meal for which I got an omelette. The rest of my party became skeptical of the food checking it before we ate it.

I was curious to see this Magic Kingdom eatery adaptation of one of Disney's most popular movies. What a spectacular job they did creating this establishment to replicate the castle. From the bridge approaching the castle, to the three dining rooms based on the movie, including the enchanted rose in the West Wing, and the windows in the main dining hall with snow falling in the background, the designers were able to capture most of the key aspects. The Christmas decorations only ehanced the overall look of the space.  \\n\\nI know I am placing a lot of attention on the decor but, that is the main attraction here. The food was average. My roast-beef sandwich was good, my sister in law's braised pork was good, and everyone enjoyed their lunches, which consisted of the French onion soup, and nicoise salads but other than the desserts, nothing really stood out. I was a little disappointed that tea was not brought out to the table as is would be served in the castle or in a kettle resembling Ms. Potts. It's a self-serve process. The servers are not taking your orders, but they do make sure you receive what you ordered, the way you ordered it. \\n\\nWhen making the reservation months prior to our trip, we were notified that we had to order our meals prior to arriving at the restaurant. When we arrived (12/30/14) nothing we ordered was in the system so we had to do this process all over again with the cashier. Good thing we had fast passes so this was just a little wrinkle in a very brief wait. Our fast passes, which I highly recommended, prevented us from standing on line for hours, on a line that stretched deep into the park, in the pouring rain. If you are reading this, and was one of those people drenched the rain, please don't hate me. After waiting online for hours, patrons are placed in a room to order their meals on the touch screen. Now I am come close to losing my sanity when I go to Chic-fil-a or Wendy's and the mother is waiting for the 6 year old to decide what he wants of the menu that hasn't changed; in years.

I enjoy it for the relaxed, vintage bar atmosphere and the fact that it truly is just a bar. When you walk in right away whether it's a crowded Friday or Saturday night or a week night, you notice right away the abundance of space and size of the bar itself. These are both pluses, considering that it allows for people to both mill around and drink and also for people to GET a drink in the first place. But considering it, there aren't really very many tables because of that, save for a row of booths off to the left hand side and a few other tables scattered around. \\n\\nTVs placed strategically around the bar are usually playing some sort of cult classic film. One of the walls by the booths is lined with old assorted bumper stickers, regular stickers, concert tickets, and other memorabilia.

A few other Yelpers have mentioned this already, but I would rather review each place separately, simply because they don't have the same vibe really.\\n\\n\\nTip: Don't forget to check out the vintage photo booth off to the right hand side when you first walk in!

We were seated immediately at the sushi bar near the rear of the restaurant.  There  were no more two person tables.   I could see some people not liking this, but I love the sushi bar so this was fine by me.  \\n\\nAtmosphere: 2/5\\nThe atmosphere has a more modern and simplistic feel to it.  I love the wood floor and exposed structural and MEP elements.  The lack of a ceiling also makes the place look  much larger.  One issue was the lighting.  It was VERY bright and had a bit of a \\"fast food\\" feel to quote my date.  It felt a little like they were trying to rush you in and out.  I hope they tone down the lighting to give a slightly more romantic feel.  The floor  plan is very open to begin with so more spot lighting and dimmer backgrounds would be nice.  Because I was coming with a date  (and not a friend) the fast food feel and lighting had a large impact on my rating for atmosphere.  If you were just two friends, this would probably be a non issue.\\n\\nService: 3/5\\nThey immediately came out with water and our hot green tea followed a few minutes later.  We were the first to order food and then a couple next to us ordered sushi and soba noodles and the individual on the other side of us ordered soba noodles.  For some reason, we received our food last.  This was an issue and was exaggerated by how hungry we were.  They also do not serve alcohol (assuming they are working on that permit or this place won't last long) so we couldn't sip on a cocktail waiting for our food.  Aside from the timing issue, they were very courteous and checked on our food, but were not intrusive.    \\n\\nFood Quality: 4/5\\nThis was the primary reason we came here.  My roommates had been here once and swore by the food...said the quality was excellent.  I have to agree.  I got the sashimi appetizer with a spicy tuna roll.  The sashimi was excellent and some of the best I have had in Boston.  The spicy tuna roll was good although when I order spicy tuna I prefer the mashed up kind.  This is made with sliced tuna and spicy mayo which was still excellent (she preferred that to the mashed up version).  My date orders a avo-cue, california and spicy tuna.  All were excellent and I especially liked that she couldn't finish all of it...More food for me :)\\n\\nPresentation:  5/5\\nThis was awesome, yet not really that important.  We loved the tree slice platter that her rolls came out on which included a fake bonsai tree.  The couple next to us had a special roll  come out on a slate service plate which a light under the shaved radish which had this interesting glow effect.  \\n\\nOverall, a good place and worth a visit.  I will probably hold off going back until they have some sort of liquor license.  They are still in their soft opening phase so I am looking forward to what slight changes they make.

Promised my boyfriend that this would be good, as I had read about CC's quality hamburger in numerous publications. It looked to be pretty busy in there, but our hostess and the bartender were on top of it and got us to both seats and beers very quickly. The beers were tasty and the ambiance cool. I expected the dining experience to be similar.\\n\\nI was wrong.\\n\\nOur server, a casually-dressed young lad, approached our table and got right to it: did we know what we wanted? Alright, they're busy, fair enough. I grinned and said I wanted a burger but that I didn't see it on the menu. He replied, while snatching up both our menus, that it is always available if you just order it And then he marched off. Good thing my boyfriend also wanted the burger and was not a devout vegetarian! Unfortunately, we had wanted a starter, but it was clear that our SERVER did not want us to dick around with his menus or time any longer.\\n\\nThe food came out looking very pretty: soft seedless buns amidst a bed of thin fries with dijon and ketchup/aioli for dipping. I was so ready to wipe the server from my mind and enjoy the burger, Yelp. Really I was. But upon my first bite (of a burger ordered medium, mind you), I thought: BURNT. \\n\\nI took another bite. And another. Yep, char. My boyfriend said the same about his burger. When we looked at the burger we saw deep char lines and the outer flesh was tough and rubbery. The inside WAS medium, however.\\n\\nOur server then, for the next ten minutes, did the most fantastic job ignoring us that I have ever seen performed by anyone.

I was almost instantly embarrassed; I've never been shamed about liking or not liking food before!

This time we tried the specialty pizzas this time, we got the Holy Shitake, Maui Wowie and Marguerita. The Holy Shitake was the best. Delicious. Order this if you love mushrooms like I do, There was a dusting of Parmesan or similar cheese which was a bit strong but overall had great flavor with the aoli, oil and garlic and shrooms! The  next best was the Marguerita, but would probably try something different next time. The Maui Wowie was the least favorite on our table. It actually wasn't bad but next to the other 2 it didn't shine. Maybe also because we are Jamaican, we knew that the jerk chicken flavor was off mark. The pineapple on it was yummy though.\\n\\nThe Magic Mushroom soup was huge! It was good, but the cheese in it was a bit too sharp for me, but others at my table all liked that about it, so I guess its a matter of taste. To me it overpowered the rest so I wouldn't call it a mushroom soup for that reason, because it makes you expect more of a mushroom flavor and a little disappointed when it doesn't live up to that.\\n\\nService this time was fast and friendly.\\n\\nOverall the pizza was good.

Make sure you ask for a few tortillas to go with it so you can make your own tacos.\\n\\nIf your looking for a little different side item, try the fried plantains, or the Flan or other deserts they have near the register.

I might've graded it on a curve but - after having NYC-quality Italian, pizza, and sushi in the last two months - I don't see why Austin can't compete with NYC in any category.  (Especially since Fino is priced like a NYC restaurant - prepare to drop $40 a person if you're going to try a couple things)\\n\\nAmbience and service are both nice.  Really liked the second floor outdoor seating area.  On to the dishes I've tried...\\n\\nFried Goat Cheese w/ Red Onion Jam & Honey ($8) - If you've never had this before, it's worth a try but this is just a so-so execution.  Not sure what this lacked vs. the great ones I've had.  I recall it being sweeter (more honey?) and better texture.  The Red Onion Jam felt superfluous and sounds better suited as the house band for a bar on 6th street.\\n\\nEscalivda Empanadas ($9) - I love empanadas but this peppers/garlic-tomato confit/black olive yogurt concoction was just so-so.  Could've used some chicken or chorizo in there.  Plus, the breading was a bit heavy - the last thing you need if you're not putting any meat in there.\\n\\nBlistered Padron Peppers with Sea Salt ($5) - Dug these.  Recommended.\\n\\nHarissa Beets and Apples ($8) - This is a cold salad.  My GF picked this out.  If you're going to charge $8 for cold beets and apples, it better rock.  This barely Lite FM'd.\\n\\nScallops & Pork Belly w/ Saffron Risotto ($25) - This is like a super-trio who might not play that well together but you still have to see..  Scallops and Pork Belly were both cooked well and had nice flavor.  I like my risotto to be molten vs al dente (as this one was) but I liked the flavor.  Note that you're paying a stiff premium for this dish - it may be entree-priced but it's closer to a tapas portion.\\n\\nWine - Our Malbec/Merlot was solid.

In all of the other places I've been to, the protein is mixed in with sauces and your choice of onions, etc before being placed on top of the rice. At Poke Station they just scoop everything into a pile in a bowl and call it a day. I noticed that the person scooping my crabmeat didn't even give a whole scoop (did he even know how to use the scoop?). Essentially what you are going to get here are ingredients all piled up on top of rice in a bowl. The sauce is just slapped on top.\\n\\n The ingredients themselves aren't bad per se- the greens are chunks of iceberg mixed in with a modest spattering of spring mix- but there really doesn't seem like much care was put into the preparation.

What's to like about them you ask? Here's my (not so) short list.\\n\\n 1. The staff - I've been going to this particular location for at least 8 years, and love that there are employees that have been there just as long. I've watched the young ones move from high school to college and stay employed here. That's pretty awesome to me. The staff is friendly, sometimes sassy, and almost always adorable. \\n\\n 2. The brisket - seriously, is this not the best brisket you've had??!!  It's so delicious, tender and scrumptious. Grab a couple of sides and Texas toast - oooh chile! You'll be eating good!\\n\\n 3. The sides - Speaking of sides can I shout out the green beans with pork?!  I'd be remiss if I didn't talk about the mac and cheese, mashed potatoes, fried pickles, and collard greens. I could legit just order sides and be content.\\n\\n 4. The Fries - Yes, yes, the fries are sides, but if you do it right the fries can become your meal! Add some cheese, get a side of meat or throw on the bacon and dig in. Absolutely the best fries in Columbus for me. \\n\\n 5. The Lemonade - It's made in house. It's tangy and delicious and goes great with vodka. SOLD!  \\n\\n6. The Drinks - This feels like a perfect time to talk about the bottled beer and soda. I am especially found of the ginger beer (non-alcoholic). There are also fountain drink options and that sweet tea on tap! \\n\\n 7. Buck-Bone-Tuesday - While the bones aren't truly a dollar anymore, this was one of the coolest marketing schemes for me and I still call it Buck-A-Bone Tuesday even though its more like almost two bucks a bone. \\n\\nPro Tip: Ask about the Insider's menu."},{"name":"Laseters Tavern at Vinings","address":"4355 Cobb Pkwy","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Good atmosphere and trivia night is fun.

We tried to make a reservation months in advance but was unable to find dinner reservations until a week before (so keep checking!). The experience is definitely worth the checking; we did find a few lunch openings once in a while which we kept had until we got the dinner option.\\n\\nKeep in mind that even if you have a dinner reservation, it still takes a little time. We arrived on time except there is a long line to check in, and there is a wait before being seated. However, once you're inside, it definitely feels magical. The castle itself is beautiful and there is freedom to walk around and look at things (they explicitly told us to so don't feel awkward!). The Beast also walks around but we're not a big fan of the characters so this didn't matter much to us. \\n\\nAs for the food:\\n+MARSEILLES-STYLE MUSSEL: A big bowl of many mussels with great tasting broth. Also appreciated the crispy crostinis that can be dipped in it. This was actually great value for what you get.\\n+ROASTED LAMB: We ordered this medium rare and it was cooked perfectly. The sauces create a nice pairing.\\n+SHRIMP & SCALLOPS PASTA: The dish came with 3 scallops and lots of shrimp. Overall pretty tasty and good portion.\\n+\\"GREY STUFF\\": This is a cookies & creme grey stuff that came on top of a custard creamy tart. Really tasty.\\n+/-CHEESE PLATE: The portions of cheeses are really small but it comes with some delicious cool pairings, such as honeycombs and preserves. The cheese options weren't super unique but it was okay. Probably good if you really like cheeses but okay to pass. \\n\\nThe service here is also really great, though we saw our staff kinda sparsely (I'm not sure if this is intentional). We waited a long time to order but they also might've been giving us time to look around. The staff are also really nice when we wanted a few pictures as well.\\n\\nOverall, Be Our Guest is a fantastically-themed Disney restaurant. Since you don't get to see the inside of the castle unless you dine here, it was a great experience. It was also nice to have a sit-down dinner.

The food was good and the atmosphere was relaxing--couples and families connecting with one another on a rainy weekend afternoon. I had the Venison & Vegetables scramble with a Black Thunder, and really enjoyed it. The toast that came with my plate was really good. My wife had some sort of turkey sandwich that was huge, but also really flavorful. However, one thing really bothered us: she ordered a French press coffee for $4.00. We make French press coffee at home all the time, and thought it was a nice option at a restaurant, instead of drip coffee. However, while they made the coffee in a French press behind the bar, they served it to my wife in a single mug. We thought they would bring the whole French press to the table. So whether it was made in a French press or not, it was still a $4.00 cup of coffee--which seemed like a lot to us. But this is a minor point.

The restaurant was packed but it is bigger than it looks and staff was managing the crowds well. The bartender was not very attentive but that's expected on a busy night. We tried the summer kolsch and pale ale, both were good. They specialize in German beers and I think they hold their own compared to other local breweries with a similar style.

I stood in a very long line, to get to the first stations, where the meat is served. Our server was very friendly, and I asked if I could get the \\"jungle juice\\" at night, and he said, \\"sure\\", and it was very good. The items on the buffet that were very good, was the oxtail soup, chicken corn chowder, chicken and the steak was okay. On the desserts, the zebra domes were great, the coffee tarts were great, and there were some little Oreo cream tarts that also tasted very good. I tried the watermelon rind, and it reminded me of pickles, with a burn at the end. (cayenne pepper??) Different, but not something I really liked. I also got the meatloaf with egg, and didn't like that either. Yes, there is a huge selection, but with the exception of the desserts, nothing was excellent regarding the meat and veggies. Getting to one of the food pods, was very difficult at times. Having the food served to us at Ohana's, was so much more relaxing, and in my opinion, the food was better. A funny story as we were getting ready to leave.....there was a family that sat down beside of us, and mom and dad told the kids (boy and girl around 13 to 15 years old) that they could go to the buffet while they ordered the drinks.

This is a bustling bar on the short north, and an essential stop on any bar hop. The crowd is young and hip, so I find that I fit in nicely. The only downside is that it is impossible to get a table after 5pm Thursday through Saturday. It can be loud in the evening but this gives it a good night feel. During the day it is still bustling but feels a bit more relaxed. \\n\\nFood 6/7\\nI give the food a tentative 6, I was leaning towards a 5 but I'm trying to put my personal bias aside for a moment. The portions are small, I could eat approximately 12 tacos. That's my only complaint. I'm not a millionaire, I can't afford 12 tacos. This is why you gotta fill up on some tortilla chips. The guac is great and the red salsa is incredibly good, the red salsa brings a perfect blend of roasted chipotle, tangy tomato and spices and just a touch of heat. I always get the tostada as it is a decent amount of food for the price. \\n\\nDrinks 7/7\\nThese margaritas are the best I have ever had. I have no idea what is in them but they are fresh tasting and very strong. These are not your typical sweet margaritas that give you more of a sugar buzz than an actually buzz. These are the real deal. If you really want to blow your mind, get a spicy jalape√±o marg. The heat blends perfectly with the burn of the tequila. Even if you are not a spicy food fan a guarantee you will love this. They also have a pretty decent craft beer selection, with local drafts and a few other good breweries. They actually switch the drafts out and don't just have the same pedestrian brews all year round. I'm sure they have wine and other drink selections but there is truly no reason that I can think of to stray from beer and margaritas.  \\n\\nOverall 7/7\\nThis is one of my favorite places to grab a beer, some chips and a taco.

No one mentioned any entree-only meal which might have been more satisfying and a better value after a long drive.   \\n\\nThe room is not quiet, but does allow conversation. Seating's a bit uncomfortable and the table needed leveling, kept jiggling.  We left $250 lighter after two tasting menus, 3 cocktails and tip.  As others note, the tasting menu is more reasonably priced on Monday only.  Expect high-priced, old-style precious servings, and not many green vegetables here. \\n\\nAfter ordering, we expect dining privacy.  If something is wrong, we'll ask for help;  otherwise, please, no \\"server surveys\\" during or after each course.  The place is packed and well-worn menu sheets indicate firmly established offerings, so why keep bothering us?  Over-reporting to servers becomes an unpaid job for diners trying to relax.  \\n\\nAs is often the case with local, high-rated dining, Frasca shines in some areas, such as prep skill and effective touches in scallops, pasta, cocktails, and lovely coconut gelato; but there's also ordinariness or just lack of interest in some dishes, like the bland crudo, desserts still heavy on sugar, chocolate, cheese and flour.\\n\\nWe've noticed that fine restaurants often begin well, instantly become too popular, and then succumb to the temptation of reduced standards, or rely on a single, very profitable angle or limited offerings (tasting menu).  In many ways Frasca was a similar experience to Fruition in Denver, in terms of seating, lack of privacy, overly-present servers, and price; but to its credit, Fruition offers excellent entrees, if also ordinary baby-green salads served cold in winter, etc. \\n\\nAfter 10 years in Denver, we're still looking for simple, fresh, vegetable-rich, organic, locally sourced, go-to dining, at a reasonable price.  We have to go downtown for anything close to this so far. \\n\\nWe've enjoyed occasional extraordinary, truly high-caliber meals in big eastern cities, at roughly the same price as Frasca, with consistent, uniform excellence, and no nuisances.

The espresso junkie in me is jumping for joy right now. The espresso has a mildly sweet taste to it, and the ratio of espresso to flavored syrup to milk is done very well, as to compliment the great taste of these four shots without taking away from the authenticity of a latte. While this latte was surprisingly delicious to me, I still think Taste Coffee House beats it out by a smidgen, especially when considering the barista skills of the Taste guys... the latte art and overall taste couldn't quite compare.

Someone got the hummus appetizer and I don't know what kind of chickpeas they are using in their kitchen, but I'm fairly sure there is crack in it. I know hummus is hummus but this app at Barley's is delicious. Overall a great time and I will definitely be back!"},{"name":"Mighty Fine Burgers Fries & Shakes","address":"10515 N Mo-Pac Expy, Ste 105","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"These days most restaurants have a secret menu, well at Mighty Fine it's called a Locals Menu and it isn't so secret. My personal favorite is the order of Fring, half onion rings half crinkle cut fries. I also love to pair any meal with one of their fresh squeezed strawberry lemonades, it just hits the spot.\\n\\nIt's a simple and consistently good meal. I always know what I'm going to get, and if you are in a rush it is a quick in and out (just be mindful if it's around lunch there can be a line). With all the Austin locations, there is usually one close by, and if not-- you can always Favor it!\\n\\n\\"Dine with Shayda reviews Mighty Fine Burgers Fries and Shakes - a local favorite founded in Austin offers a classic Texas burger plus not so secret menu.\\""},{"name":"Via Napoli","address":"EPCOT World Showcase - Italian Pavilion, 1510 Avenue of the Stars","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"Delicious food...our favorite at Disney!

That said, they still have a great panang curry.  My favorite thing on the menu is the Pineapple Fried Rice, but it's also one of the priciest things you can get for lunch, so watch out!  No free parking, either.  But at least it's walking distance from most places downtown."},{"name":"Rose VL Deli","address":"6424 SE Powell Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"My favorite soups from the lovely and talented Ha!

There are no processed foods, no shortcuts in the cooking and nothing that doesn't taste good.  This is not one of those places where you are eating a healthy meal while sacrificing taste.  The veggie burgers taste great because of the attention to detail in the ingredients and because the  bread is not your usual big thick, bready bun but rather more like a flavorful flat bread.  Add to the tasty, real food:  the ambience is conducive to conversation and the parking is plentiful.  The location is central and the owner is delightful.  We met Aimee when she came to our table and talked with us.  She is passionate about serving good food in a beautiful environment.  We plan to return to check out the all day breakfast menu and the salad and soup options."}]`),N={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:z},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(n=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return n.name.toLowerCase().includes(e)||n.city.toLowerCase().includes(e)||n.text.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},j={class:"search-container"},E={class:"card-container"},H=["disabled"],R={key:0},F={key:1};function D(n,e,s,f,i,r){const u=p("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"üéâ Restaurant Reviews ü•≥")])],-1)),t("div",j,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"üîç",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=h=>i.searchQuery=h),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[v,i.searchQuery]])]),t("div",E,[(a(!0),o(y,null,m(r.filteredPoems,(h,g)=>(a(),k(u,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:i.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...h)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...h))},[i.isLoading?(a(),o("span",F,"Loading...")):(a(),o("span",R,"See more"))],8,H)):w("",!0)])}const L=c(N,[["render",D],["__scopeId","data-v-44c7b705"]]),V=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"sponsor/31.md","filePath":"sponsor/31.md"}'),G={name:"sponsor/31.md"},Y=Object.assign(G,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(a(),o("div",null,[I(L)]))}});export{V as __pageData,Y as default};
