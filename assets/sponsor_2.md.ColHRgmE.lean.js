Ever since moving from NYC, I have been in the search for good authentic Indian restaurants and in the course of the 3 years that I've been here, I must've tried every single Indian restaurant in the Boston/Cambridge area and many in the suburbs...This beats them all hands down. I have a very high benchmark for Indian food being that I am of Indian background and was brought up in India and then there was NYC that had a nice group of authentic Indian restaurants that I got used to from my time in NYC. Notes:1. Friday and Saturday nights are packed...especially with Indian patrons (always a good sign). I look for this in Chinese restaurants too. If you go there these two nights, better be patient. Our party of 8 was there for hour and half, but we didn't notice because we were enjoying the food and chatting away. 2. Try Indo-Chinese & South Indian items like Dosa, especially if you have never tried them before. 3. Ask them to make everything spicy. It doesn't come out 'hot', but rather comes out very flavorful. However my spice tolerance might be higher than average yelp reader.  ;-) 4. Try Indian beers!!!! Flying Horse is my favorite! 5. Hariyali kebab was awesome to go with beer.

Unfortunately for Vino Venue, my last experience leaves a lot to be desired.We had a table of about 8 people and had some difficulty finding a seat during Dunwoody Restaurant Week. Understandable so we bought cards which allowed us to purchase wine. They have cool machines where you insert your card, pick your wine glass size (taste, half, or full) and play sommelier with all of your friends. While the decor was welcoming and the atmosphere cozy, the wait staff and food were disappointing in comparison. While a small restaurant, our waiter could be found anywhere but where our table was. He seemed more interested in chatting with other staff members than assisting us.Our three course menu consisted of an appetizer, entree, and dessert. I chose to start with the garlicky goat cheese with toast points. It was smooth and creamy but the garlic overwhelmed the cheese. I had a few bites and was satiated while over half the jar was still full! Definitely one to share. It paired well with my wine and I could take it for what it was.My entree however was a different story. Ordering the lobster mac and cheese I pictured ooey-gooey cheese with perfectly al dente pasta and tender lobster. Unfortunately, I got the opposite. The only lobster in the dish was the piece on top garnishing it. The cheese was congealed a bit (mostly because there was way too much oil/butter used) and the panko on top just provided a mouthful of dry breadcrumbs.For dessert, I chose the pot de creme. It was orange and dark chocolate and probably the best part of the meal. A drawback though was that our whole table wasn't served at the same time and one of the diners had to flag down our waiter to let him know she wasn't served hers.With so many up and coming wine bars in the area I'm definitely interested in seeing what others have to offer."},{"name":"Joey Ds Italian Grill","address":"114 Pleasant St","city":"Marblehead","stars":"3","text":"We recently moved from Newton Corner to our new home in Marblehead and after a couple of exhausting days of moving, we stumbled upon Joey D's - thank goodness - and have been ordering from there since at least once a week. The value for Joey D's is incredible. Huge portions, very reasonable price - the $8.95 pasta dinner comes with not only a side salad made with mixed greens, but also delicious garlic knots. We always have enough for lunch the next day. The coupons are great, and we get our food in under 25 minutes with free delivery in Marblehead (the delivery guy is super nice) - and our order has never once been wrong. We do tend to get more takeout from Joey D's, but have dined-in. The restaurant itself is spotless and while there are not draft beers, there are options with wine and bottled beer. Joey is a really nice guy and has been in the business for ages. He is willing to turn the TV to most any sporting even you'd like to write and always asks us numerous times if our food is okay and we have everything we need. If you are looking for Lucca or Giacomo's - this is not your place. But having come from the city, we have paid a heck of a lot more for an overcooked pizza from Upper Crust. The food quality is a lot like The Chateau in Waltham but $3/entree lower in price, and much better garlic knots. If you are looking for 5 star gourmet, head downtown.

But I must warn you - consume one of these, and you'll be full before you eat a single bite of the rest of your meal!I can't say enough about the rest of the food here, either. I'm no southern BBQ expert, and I don't pretend to be, but everything I tried here was dee-lic-ious. Their lunch menu is pretty simple. You can either order a sandwich or a tray. I'd go with the trays, if I were you. First step is to choose your meat. From pork belly to pork ribs to brisket and more, you really can't go wrong. I got the brisket, and it was perfectly tender, not too fatty, and not too chewy. Perfectly cooked and seasoned. Your lunch tray also comes with a pile of onions and pickles and your choice of one hot or cold scoop, which is their version of a side. I got a scoop of their potato salad, which is topped with bacon bits. Yum!!By the time you've consumed all of the aforementioned food, you may be full to the point of bursting. Sadly, this was the case for me, so I wasn't able to try any of their scrumptious sounding desserts. Root beer chocolate cake? Yes, please! But that's not a problem.

Omg! What a piece of delicious steak. It cut smooth like butter and was just juicy and tasty, despite me liking my steak medium well. My husband has the 20oz cowboy ribeye. He said it was just the best steak he's had as well. For sides, we had the brussel sprouts and the mashed potatoes. Very tasty as well. Only complaint is that they could prob make a tastier bread for the table. For a place that has such good food, their starter bread was a bit underwhelming. And the Mac and cheese kinda sucked.

There were literally 2 couples seated inside and a table of 8 or so just leaving outside... not busy at all. It was a bummer that they couldn't accommodate the reservation they made 3 days prior but whatever... seat us outside and we'll be fine. Or so we thought. It took almost 20 minutes to get seated in an empty restaurant. We sat down and placed our orders fairly quickly. It took almost an hour to get 4 plates of eggs. Maybe they had to wait for the hen to lay them?!? How do eggs take that long in a dead restaurant... or even in a slammed one for that matter. An HOUR?!? Apparently it doesn't always take that long because the only other table seated outside was seated about 20 min before our food came and got there 3 egg plates the same time we did.

I ordered more bread to sop up the leftover sauce -- yummy.Atmosphere was perfect  for romance and family. I appreciate a restaurant that can go both ways. Our bottle of wine for the table was accompanied with a sparkling juice for the 7 year old.

When people talk about differentiating yourself from the competition Motomachi truly understands this concept. The main theme of the restaurant is clear, serve good healthy food with ramen. I've gone here three times, and the first time I tried out their charcoal ramen. Charcoal detoxifies the body and is actually used in hospitals. But it's not just this dish that makes it stand out, it's the fresh organic ingredients that are used. They provide a different type of sweetness that comes from fresh vegetables and organic chicken. For myself I rated this 4 star because of personal preference to a heavier style and thick soup base like Kintaro. But the beauty of their particular ramen is that is meant for people who like a cleaner, lighter taste to their soup and to their ramen without being drenched in the taste of pork fat.The place is a little small, and can get cramped at times. But I highly recommend that any foodie to go and try this ramen out for themselves. And that's because it is delicious and serves good wholesome food. And truthfully, I love Kintaro a lot. But if Kintaro is too busy, there's no doubt in my mind, that I go to Motomachi.

Wow, when I stepped up to the counter, I faced about a dozen different kinds of meat simmering on their steam table, which made me unsure of what to order.  I told the lady behind the counter that this was my first time there and I wasn't sure what was what.  She pointed out things to me and gave me a sample of the carnitas.  It was nice and tender.  I asked if they had al pastor, but they didn't.  I decided to stick with things I knew so I ordered carnitas and chipotle chicken for my two tacos.  The meats were scooped up from the steam table and served directly onto the tortillas, so the tacos were damp and runny.  That was disappointing since I prefer meat that's grilled a bit before it goes into a taco. . .I do like taco meat that is finished off with some grilled crispy edges.

The Broadway location is great but they don't deliver, which is a shame. The two problems I encountered were:1. Delivery order was wrong \\nI ordered the Sichuan String Beans and I got some other pork dish instead. I asked the person who took my order, to repeat it (just in case). She got it right but it's not what arrived? I may have accidentally gained by getting a meat dish instead of a veg dish, from a dollar-value perspective but I kinda really needed that vegetable dish in my lacking diet. :P2. Consistency in food among locations \\nMy favourite dish at Peaceful at the Broadway location is the Cilantro Lamb - it's absolutely the best! - I phoned the Broadway location and found out it was the 5th Ave location that delivered. I asked if the menu and food were exactly the same as with 5th. They said \\"yes, same.\\" What came was not the same Cilantro Lamb as that of Broadway. At $15.95, I was really disappointed with this version. Drowned in sickly sweet bean sauce that I couldn't even taste the lamb or the cilantro, it simply wasn't good. Not anywhere near the Cilantro Lamb I was highly anticipating. On the plus side, hence still some stars:- They were polite and friendly on the phone. \\n- They didn't \\"over promise\\" on the delivery time. It was realistic and I appreciated that. \\n- The delivery guy, although he had to call me mid-way to try to locate a not-difficult-to-find address, was also very friendly and polite.\\n- The delivery time really wasn't terrible considering the rainy evening that it was. Note: If they were slammed that night due to weather, then the mix up with the String Beans is understandable (but the disappointing mess that was supposed to Cilantro Lamb was NOT cool)Overall conclusion, I should get off my ass and just go to Broadway and let go of my Peaceful-Cilantro-Lamb-delivery-right-to-my-doorstep-dreams."},{"name":"Gigi's Cafe","address":"6320 SW Capitol Hwy","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Don't go for espressos if you're asking for a standard \\"long espresso\\"... they are puzzled!

For instance, order the Country-Fried Rib Eye and you'll hear him out in the kitchen, pounding the steak thin. Battered, fried crisp and covered with cream gravy, it's the most tender chicken-fried steak you'll ever eat. The Duck Confit is cured with lavender from Boggy Creek farm, then braised till it's falling-off-the-bone delicious. Both dishes are served with chunky house-mashed potatoes. This is rustic comfort food done well! Caesar salad featured crisp baby romaine lettuce, fresh-shaved leaves of parmesan, and real caesar dressing with a hint of anchovies. The goat-cheese and arugula salad used toasted sourdough as its base. You spread the lemon-zested cheese on the toast, then pile the greens on top for a nice flavor combo of tangy cheese with peppery greens. The Old-Fashioned Pot Roast is just that: tender, well-seasoned and served with a delicious broth to spoon over your mashed potatoes. The food deserves five stars, but don't expect a fancy place.

This place serves dishes typical of interior Mexico, where black beans, white rice with carrots and peas (not orange rice) is typical.  It's not the best spot to get chips & queso... but sorry folks, that's not really an authentic dish.  I'd suggest the Sopecitos de Chorizo if you want a starter..  Cochinita Pibil & TIkin Xic are among my favorites as are the Enchiladas de Mole (almost as good as mom's) and this is the only place other than my motherland I'd order Empanadas de Huitaloche.

Ordering is simple, we can choose to re-order our last order, make notes, get discounts with promo codes. Love this system!The food is great...not quite China Buffet good, but close enough. At the time of this writing, we have ordered from China Palace almost ten times now. I still always get the Sesame Chicken with Wonton Soup and an Eggroll. My girlfriend usually changes it up every order, she is not as happy with the food as she was with Sunhing. The portion sizes are really good and you can even order a side of Sweet and Sour whatever for an extra $3...which my waistline loves! Nothing has a weird flavor or is out of the ordinary from how I normally like it.This place has done a great job of filling the hole left behind from China Buffet.

The food did arrive in about 5-10 more minutes but we were missing an entire meal and a side of bacon. They told us the meal should be right out but there was no explanation of why it was missing to begin with. We asked for our check because we needed to catch a bus and we were charged for every item (including items we had not received) at this point everyone else at the table had eaten their entire meals which were cold when received and had been mediocre. We requested to speak to the manager at this point who took off the missing items and our drinks. They assured us the missing meal would be right out for us to take to go.

We waited a total time of a hour and 15 minutes from the time we placed our order to the time we received the last meal that was packaged Togo because everyone else was done- which is unacceptable.

That said, I like the place.  The staff members seem friendly and \\"alt\\" enough for me to be happy, the food is adequate if not halfway decent, and the coffee's fine enough.  I'd still prefer to have a Gorilla Coffee (Park Slope, BK) here.  The two major drawbacks of the place, imo are:a) The entitled attitudes of a few of the patrons that I've encountered.  I mean, the place is often crowded yet people look at me strange when I ask them if seats next to them are taken. Mind you, I'm not talking about booths!  I mean seats at distinctly different tables.  One woman (a student) was actually \\"saving\\" an extra table on a Saturday morning by placing a drink and her gloves on the table next to her.  This, so that she and ONE friend could spread out on two tables as if they were at home or something.  Whiskey-Tango-Foxtrot?!!  She even have me a little attitude when I asked if the table was taken.  Unbelievable. b) The second gripe is a bit touchy.  Recently, I was sitting there around 11 p.m. (actually, tonight) working on something for my job when I saw a MOUSE run across the floor in the front of the cafe.  This little guy (or girl) ran over to the Naked Juice machine and proceeded to peek out every few minutes, as if to see if (presumably) the area near where I was sitting (near the wall) was free.

I opted for that- $9.95, and I got to try a few different things.The salad fixings were fresh and good.  Soup of the day was corn chowder, which I love, and which they did pretty darn well.  Thick, creamy, full of corn and other veggies and with a bit of pepper kick.The wraps seemed pretty plain so I tried two of the hot sandwiches, with some house-made potato chips.  The chips were stale.  They were probably okay when fresh.  And the sandwich buns were hard and dry- maybe due to sitting in the warmers, or maybe stale too.  A build-your-own sandwich bar might be a good idea, so that the buns stay fresh and the other ingredients are hot, instead of everything being lukewarm...  Anyway, I had a patty melt, which was pretty good besides the bun- beef, onions, cheese, you know what? Comfort food.  I also tried the chicken (fiesta chicken, I think.)  Meh.

Aside from the food (which I will get to momentarily), all else in this restaurant is \\"meh\\". The venue is not dirty, but it's not clean. It's not appealing, but not appalling. Servers/Service isn't friendly, but it isn't rude.Just \\"meh\\".As for the food, I tried the \\"Combo A\\", which is inclusive of california rolls, sashimi, sushi, tempura, miso soup, salad, and a crab cake.Shame on me for hitting up a Japanese place in Atlanta, and further shame on me for ordering sushi there. Words cannot describe how awful the food was.Let me start with the miso and salad, which come out first before your main course. The miso has old, stale noodles in it (which I assume is because they sell \\"noodles in miso\\" and pass it off as the \\"shoyu ramen\\" on their menu). The soup has an unclean scent to it, and it is overall unpleasant. The salad is your par for the course sesame oil-based dressing that you get at teriyaki restaurants. However, it is obvious that the salad is not fresh (probably made in the morning, and served throughout the day all the way through dinner).The tempura and crab cakes are awful. I literally took one bite, and wanted nothing more to do with it. The crab cake is imitation crab mixed with mayo, and then deep fried. Honestly, don't ever get this.The tempura again tastes like the base ingredient (shrimp for the shrimp tempura, veggies for the veggie tempura, etc) are not fresh. The texture of the said ingredient makes this obvious. Limp, moist, and slimy.Now for the sushi... holy shit the sushi!First, just look at the color of what they call \\"salmon\\" \\"tuna\\" and \\"yellow tail\\". What fish is neon pink, hot orange, and pastel white in their natural state? Second, just like the rest of their menu, the sushi here is not fresh. Everything smells very fishy (like an uncleaned fisherman's tool box, if you will), and the texture is vomit inducing. Calling what they serve here \\"sushi\\" is like sbarro pizza \\"genuine gourmet italian cuisine\\". the only difference there is, at least sbarro is actually pizza.Awful place, complete waste of the $24 that my combo cost, and definitely never coming here again."},{"name":"Zesto","address":"2469 Piedmont Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"The buffalo chicken quesadila and the peach sundae are great!

It was for the incredibly appealing decor (inside and outside!). The patio is just too pretty, and the inside is equally as relaxing and clean. I went with two girlfriends for a lunch. I got pad thai, while one friend got vegetarian sushi rolls and the other got lettuce wraps. Our server was, honestly, amazing. He was so nice and so fun to talk to. He was incredibly friendly and helpful with any questions we had on the menu. He knew everything. And even when my pad thai was covered in sprouts (I asked for no bean sprouts), he immediately noticed when it had come out and insisted he take it back and they make me a new dish. But I really didn't want a huge plate of food to go to waste, so I insisted that it really was ok! The pad thai portion was so huge that I had to take it home. It was good (no real complaints on my dish) and I really enjoyed the overall experience. My one friend liked her sushi rolls while my other friend wasn't incredibly happy with the taste of the lettuce wraps. I also tried a little bite and it was just a different type of flavor.. I can't quite pinpoint it. But not as flavorful as the ones you would get at pf changs, for example.It's nice that they have a private lot - it says \\"valet\\" but really you just park there and it's free. I do remember being slightly uncomfortable with the seats inside - I don't think they have backs to them and you're more sitting on a glorified bench, but it was all going with the theme of the room. There's a huge floor table at the front of the room we were sitting in, which I assume is one of those tables you sit at for a birthday dinner or with a large group of people. Kind of like the outdoor table with the white flowy curtains around it - it's a beautiful looking table where you would want to sit when having a nice dinner with a group of 8+ people.

Yes the restaurant is pretty casual with the whole \\"school lunch tray\\", but I love the lighting and all the decor.  I have yet to hit up the bar (next mission), but the menu had a diverse list of beers and lots of fun mixed drinks (don't forget the whiskey).

The pork had a smokey tenderness to it that kept me going back for another bite.  My suggestions, the one meat tray is more than enough food for one person, or three depending on your typical appetite.  Don't expect to leave this restaurant still hungry (unless you are a vegetarian/vegan).  Reviews suggested the broccoli casserole for the hot side...\\"meh\\".  It was ok and didn't wow me...I wish I had gone for collard greens.  But, the carrot and raisin salad was delish!  It also made a great combination with the pulled pork in my to-go baggie.

(Looked that way for years.) Welcome to Rockwood/Gresham ladies and gentlemen! There's a CSL Plasma donation center next door full of desperate crackheads trying to make a quick buck. It's rather depressing, however once you realize it's just Gresham, you understand a little more. They make their tortillas and tortilla chips fresh daily! They also make your burritos ready to order in front of you. Their salsa bar is a bit messy, but you get a good idea of which is what, etc... The cactus has made me a fan, their churros are so addicting and delicious when freshly made and still warm, and I think their carnitas tacos are some of the most authentic and best marinated around!!!The watermelon agua Fresca is the best!!! A bit on the spendy side, however totally worth it and the quantity is always on the larger side!

Somehow, I felt like Beijing Noodle House would be the only place that could potentially have it, but alas.  None were to be found.  Still, it had been a while since my last visit, so I didn't hate myself too much for picking this place.The beef noodles ($7.50) were alright.  The soup didn't have that much dimension to it, but the noodles were good.  The beef was not tough, but I would have liked them to be a bit more tender. Many people seem to order the dumplings, so we, too, ordered the bok choy and pork dumplings ($7).  There were so many! The wrapper on these were a bit thick for my preference, but I recently heard someone enjoy thicker wrappers? I can see how it can be more filling, which is good, but I still like near-translucent thin wrappers more.  I did like the filling inside of these though.  I have contemplated coming here by myself for a plate of dumplings.  Is that weird?I originally wanted the shredded pork with wrappers (second last photo from this post on Dinesty), but somehow a miscommunication led to us ordering this.  I think it's supposed to be something similar to Buddha's Delight, but with pork ($12).  We ordered wrappers ($2) anyway since we didn't have any carb based dish to accompany it.  This was disappointing.  Not just because it wasn't what I had wanted, but it was so greasy, and there were so many vegetables.  It was a weird meld of scrambled egg and vegetables and shredded pork. The stir fried rice cakes with preserved vegetables ($7) was alright. The rice cakes were not as soft as I would have liked them and the preserved vegetables were a bit weird tasting. Can't really put my finger on why.Overall the meal was a bit disappointing, with the dumplings that were just alright but decent beef noodles.

I went on a Friday afternoon (6/01/18) to place a to go order and the restaurant was mildly busy. While my order was correct, the pure ignorance I saw on display during my brief time was shocking. First, a customer tried to pay for his $22 meal with a $100 bill. The manager told them he cannot take it because they don't have change. This location is less than 5 miles from Disney, and is inundated with tourists who use mostly cash. I find this unacceptable. The customer said he's not going to incur international charges on her card so what solution do they have. The manager said he has to wait there until they take enough cash to give him change. I was in the location for approximately 15 minutes and he was still waiting when I left. While waiting, a customer behind me ordered a chicken salad. They brought him out a taco salad. The customer let them politely know that \\"I ordered a chicken salad not taco salad\\" to which the manager got huffy and personally went to the back and made a salad. He came back out and gave the customer the bag and said \\" have a great night there you go have one now one later.\\" The customer looked in the bag and realized he now had TWO taco salads. He let the manager know again and the manager said no you told me you wanted a taco salad. The customer said but you gave me a taco salad why would I complain if it was correct? And then then the manager proceeded to huff and puff and make a chicken salad. Then he took the two taco salads back. Finally, a customer had a coupon for a burger, fries, and milkshake for $3.99. Upon getting her receipt she let the waitress know it wasn't applied. She got the manager involved who said there's nothing they could do since it was rang up incorrectly. The customer had given the coupon beforehand. This is not the customers fault. She ended up having to pay full price. Again, I ordered 2 kids meals and they were correct, but I thought I should share my experience at this location.

Now, you have a different menu - it's mainly steaks, and some sides, but gone are the wonderfully sharable appetizers (fried pickles, cornbread).\\nLet's break it down:\\n-\\n1) The music doesn't quite fit the bill.   For a place called \\"Bogie's Place\\", fast-modern-jazz isn't quite right.  As we said \\"it's not music you can drink to\\".  Jazz is fine, but it felt \\"off\\".

I don't know if it was worth $33, but at least it was a good size.  The baked potatoes were underwhelming.  I thought the crispy-pigs-ear on top was a nice touch, but overall it was bland.  I wish it had butter or cheese in there.  Instead it was just sour cream, some green onions.  It was underwhelming.  I had the bone marrow as a side with my filet, and it was all right.  I've had better - this was \\"fattier\\" (?) than other bone marrow I've had.  It wasn't that smooth consistency I've seen elsewhere.\\nThe molten chocolate lava cake is excellent, and defintiely worth the price.

However, considering that I come here almost once a week for lunch or dinner, (some of the staff remembers me by my order, so i'd consider myself a \\"regular\\") it's unfortunate that there are times when I still have issues with my meal.... For my custom order, it is only 3 ingredients on top of plain lettuce to create a salad. There have been multiple times where the waiter has taken and confirmed my order perfectly, but the chefs in the kitchen sent out an entirely incorrect meal. From instances where they sent out a completely different salad with all the works on top, to accidentally putting croutons on my simple salad and then telling me \\"the chef tried to take them all off but there might still be a few in the dish\\" (rather than just remaking my salad since I'm allergic to ingredients in the croutons). To some this may not seem like a big deal, but for people with allergies, just a sliver of an allergic ingredient getting left on a plate could cause a reaction. I went in a couple weeks ago and was told they are starting a new allergy watch program, and another staff member in a white shirt and tie came out to confirm my meal order, and all went fine - other than the fact that they served me a side salad rather than a full salad. I was happy to see that they were starting to put these plans in place for a better system. But when I went there the following week, it was back to the way it was before and they had no such precautions. I believe that their staff needs to be trained to work more cohesively together between the waiting staff and the chefs, and the chefs need to learn and understand the importance of the meaning \\"allergy watch\\" because this is not something that should be taken lightly."},{"name":"Asia Express","address":"438 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Terrible!!

You would think that by now almost 2 years later they would have their collective sh*t together enough to 1- have the doors unlocked by open time and 2- not be out of English Bacon.  3 - Offer their customers water.  The last time I went here, 6 months ago, they didn't have English Bacon - ok no sweat - it happens - but today was the same thing. I got the same excuse as last time, \\"the supplier was out\\" followed with a defensive \\"I could go to a different supplier but it wouldn't be as good, should I do that?\\"  If you don't have the authentic products for the  concept of your restaurant then what do you have?  Nothing that I can't get at the grocery store.  (Except of course the English Bangers)  I can make roasted tomatoes, fried bread, eggs and mushrooms.  Oh, and water.  I guess they were all out of water as well because I was never asked what I wanted to drink and I didn't ask.  Yes, a little passive aggressive on my part, I guess I was testing them.  I should also mention that the guy at the register mumbled something to the effect that I didn't have to pay.  That was weird. I turned him down because I can not be bought by free food.  I think he just wasn't ready to ring me up because the cash register wasn't turned on.  I stepped away as he fumbled with the register - I'm sure I was making him nervous at this point, so I suggested that he keep my credit card and ring me up when he got things going.  I go sit down and a few moments pass and the kid brings me some electronic device that captured my credit card and that I am supposed to sign with my finger.  No receipt - they could email it to me and no place to add a tip.  As I had no cash he got no tip.But wait!!! Here are 3 tips\\n1. Open on time.  And find a different lock for your door other than a padlock & chain - it looks like crap.\\n2. Don't t run out of your concept product. \\"ENGLISH BACON\\" in case you forgot.\\n3.

But Kung Pao Wok is the best. No matter what you order, you simply can't go wrong. But don't take my word for it. Let's just say that there's a good reason why this place has the longest lines in the food court. Their food is simply scrumptious!I've noticed that a lot of food court places overcook their chicken, and when they do, it's not pretty. You basically get stuck with this hard, rubbery chicken that tastes like soggy rubberbands. But at Kung Pao Wok, their meat is always moist and flavourful. I usually alternate between the Spicy Chicken and the Kung Pao Chicken (my two favourites) and you honestly can't go wrong with either one. Their rice noodles have a nice, slippery consistency. And the rice and chow mein are nicely done as well. Their mixed vegetables are fresh, with large portions of broccoli and green beans (yum!) and no MSG added. Service is always speedy and friendly, which is especially important when you hit the food court during the busy lunch times hours.If you don't mind having your meal a bit later in the evening,  you can get the 2 items + rice/ noodles combo for a few dollars off the regular price (just go an hour before the mall closes). This practice just makes good sense, business wise. I would never even have tried Kung Pao Wok if hadn't been for the closing special. But once I tried their food, I was hooked!

Ribs were tender and fell off the bone.I had the brisket with potato salad and mac n cheese.  The brisket was a bit dry (my husband agreed) and the mac n cheese tasted a bit chalky (if that makes sense).

I am a LOVER of potato salad and this was so tart and vinegary that I couldn't eat it.  It looked good on the platter with the bacon bits, but not that great of a taste.Staff was great, great ambiance, etc.  My suggestion would be to add in a kids menu.  BBQ is a family kind of food.

I discovered when I got home that there were only beans and cheese inside, a sloppy mess. My order was also to go, I sat at a table and waited for quite some time and finally noticed a bag on their front counter. I had to ask if it was mine and the man that took my order just said \\"yeah\\" in response and turned away.

He brought our food out to the table along with utensils and \\"better\\" forks, more sturdy I guess. We both got falafel dinners, I got fries and my mom got taboleh.

I ordered The 101 because I figured for a grilled cheese restaurant, this sandwich would be top notch.  Nope.  Also, I'm a huge fan of grilled cheese sandwiches.  \\nThe 101's toasted bread was tasty, but the cheddar was bright orange, waxy, and had little flavor.  The price for The 101 is $5, a bit steep for the quality.  That is why I later asked if one can exchange the cheese on sandwiches.  \\nThe soup is good.  The mac-and-cheese had more flavor than the grilled cheese, however there is a tang to it that over powers the cheese flavor.  I couldn't tell if the tang (sour like) was from one of the cheeses or if something was added to \\"brighten\\" the dish.  I like that they grill the top of the mac-and-cheese, however the toasted area did not have an increase in flavor like I expected, you know, the flavor of the cheese that melts onto the pan when you're making a grilled cheese sandwich.\\nService was young, cordial, and awkward.

Pretty casual, there's no hostess or any server taking you to your table which was fine - I like picking my own table anyway! The tea wasn't too hot and was drinkable which I liked. I think it's awful when you're almost burning off your tastebuds trying to enjoy a [boiling] hot cup of tea. I ordered a small brisket and beef ball pho (#5) which arrived within 10 minutes, so fairly quickly. The broth was full of flavour and the ingredients tasted fresh. The meat wasn't as tender as I would have liked it to be. I like to add a lot of hot sauce to my pho, but I made sure to taste it in all it's glory beforehand. I didn't realize this place was cash only, which is a downside since I pay for everything by card.Aside from the funky smell, the delicious bowl of pho made up for it.

The waittress went in the back to get me another steak, and it was the same thing: burned--nice and black. No way!! I sent it back. Nothing fancy about this place too. You get better steak and  atmosphere at a franchise like Chillis, TGF, etc. This place is way over rated simply because it's been around a long time. You want good steak?

The fish on the sashimi platter was not cut thin enough and was too big to put into your mouth for one bite - in particular the tuna, salmon and escolar.  Conch and octopus on the platter were OK.  The wasabi was not made fresh that day as the kick of the wasabi was not happening and that is what wasabi is all about. Sake ok, prices ok. The Japanese waitresses are beautiful and welcoming with their lovely kimonos. The place is pretty ugly - in a  strip mall.

This is exactly what I was looking for. It's too bad it's so far away from my house. But I will indeed be making more trips out this way to patron this location. Although there is no table service, they certainly make up for it with their atmosphere, their patrons, and their food. I had the cashier recommend a sandwich, since I was completely overwhelmed by the chalk board listing of all their foods and drinks. I had the Autobahn which was probably the most delicious turkey sandwich I have ever had. Loaded with turkey, pesto, tomatoes, and pressed with a panini grill - this sandwich was FAN-tastic! Their iced vanilla chai put me over the top. And a tip for all of you folks who are not willing to pay for the wi-fi such as myself, sit in the back - you can great signal from Best Practical Solutions, where they will let you jump on their wireless, just don't abuse it otherwise it will cut you off and you will need to disconnect/reconnect. I will most certainly be frequenting this location on a regular basis to get my caffeine kick and studying done. Thanks Somerville for hosting such an awesome hangout!***** UPDATE 10/7 ****** \\nI HEART DIESEL!!!! I've been back here multiple times and have yet to be disappointed. Yes sometimes the food and drinks are a little slow, but can you blame them? The reason why is cause they have great staff who puts in the time to make that awesome sandwich or drink. You don't want some low quality stuff now do ya? When ask for that sandwich to be grilled, it's gonna be grilled, not some cold, unmelted, half grilled thing. So yes, appreciate the fact that they are a little slow to turn out your food or drink. Another reason might also have to do with the fact that there's a ton of people ordering food and drinks at the same time. Give these guys time. They work hard. I don't feel like they give you attitude or neglect you at all. Also, you can't really have more than 1 person working at a station, even though YOU feel like there should be more staffing. Simply put, you can't have people stepping on each others toes. Ever heard of too many cooks in the kitchen?

The chips were heavy, heavy deep fried chips which were almost pastry-like in texture. The Thai Chicken Wraps were actually much worse. The chicken/sesame filling was made from ground chicken which resulted in a rather unappetizing looking goulash (Couldn't just dice up some chicken and saute it?). Served with Bibb lettuce and a dipping sauce which was also very bland. A nice sampling of sprouts, peanuts, noodles, peppers, and red cabbage tried to save the day to no avail.

That's when the show started.  The bartender was all over the place.  It seemed like she was trying to put on a show rather than serve the guests.  She would do some dancing to the music and lip syncing and then go into what I can only describe as dancing I have seen at gentleman's club.  As she was with the guests close to me I noticed what might be the issue.  She was taking shots with the guests.  My family has been in the bar business for a long time and I have never seen a successful bar that has employees drinking on the clock.  Plus the bar was full of empty beer bottles and dirty dishes.Then my sandwich came out.  The bartender had it in her hands for quite sometime before it came to me.  She even asked other quests if they ordered the chicken and then when I was the last person she thought to ask, you could see it in her face that she suddenly remembered it was my order.  Once I got it and started to eat, I noticed that the chicken was stone cold but the fries were piping hot.  This tells me that the chicken breast was precooked then chilled.  It tasted fine since it was cooked through but not ideal at all.  All of this occurred while I had an empty beer.At some point the bartender went on what  I imagine was a smoke break. She was gone for about 20 minutes while some guy from the back started to clean up the bar area.  It took him quite a while to get the bar looking like it should again.  What a shame really.  If I were the manager or owner I would have been embarrassed.  To be honest it just did not seem like anyone really cared about the business or the guest's needs.  It was all just a show and that only goes so far in the real business world."},{"name":"Yakuza","address":"5411 NE 30th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"We had heard the burger hyped, but it was okay.

Service is good and generally fast at this location, and the restaurant is clean.  When I do go, I usually get the two taco special on Tuesdays, which include two tacos, a small drink, and a choice of beans and rice or chips and queso/salsa.  I usually end up going for  one fish and one chicken taco with black beans and rice.About half of the time I go there, there is no fish in the warming pan, but it just takes a few minutes for them to heat one up.  It is frozen pollack, so do not expect anything too fancy.  The fish tacos are a little better than what you would expect at a fast food location I suppose, I  think that they are a nice alternative to other fast food tacos out there.   I once made the mistake of trying a shrimp taco at Taco Bell this summer...ugh...what was I thinking?Another nice thing is that they have a punch card, one punch for every 5.00 spent there.  Once you get 10 punches, you get five bucks off of your next meal.  Sure, there are better Mexican restaurants out there, but I would take Taco del Mar over Taco Bell or Taco Time."},{"name":"Toco Grill","address":"1658 Lavista Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Health inspectors in house now.

After spending some time along the Gulf Coast I came back home craving the deliciousness that I had experienced in podunk Mississippi and Louisiana -- that kind of savory, tangy, spicy, sweet, perfectly crisp and fatty pork that both melted in your mouth and still required you to chew.Then I found Sweet Cheeks which emulates Southern food ALMOST to a t. The biscuits have never disappointed - flaky, buttery, peel-apart layers of carby goodness that don't leave you feeling like you need to wipe your hands off. The honey butter is inexplicably delicious but I imagine that this honey butter is what got Paula Deen hooked on butter in the first place.The pork, the brisket, the chicken - it's all incredibly cooked. Buttermilk fried? It's got the perfect amount of crunch and flavor with a moist piece of chicken underneath. The pork and brisket are so terrifically smoked that you can add the varieties of barbecue sauce to them...if you want to. You don't really need to, but I add a combination of all three sauces they leave on the table. Nothing's as great as vinegary tang and sweet spiciness combined. Mac-and-cheese is rich and savory, cole slaw is tangy and crunchy. Drinks are great, too - the bar is pretty vast but still keeps Southern roots at its core. I'd keep going about how wonderful this place is, but I'm already craving it and it's only 8:57 AM. Just go. Eat. Wear stretchy pants.

Overall really like the cozy and friendly service and I always come back.FYI if you happen to be a fan of the Arizona black and white tea this is one of the few places left that sell it. CVS and Walgreen's used to carry them but they phased them out. I was super excited to see they still carried it because its the only tea in the Arizona line that doesn't use high fructose corn syrup...

Ok -- expectations high. We also ordered the sausage, ricotta, tomato and fontina pizza. Here's the problem. The flat bread style thin crust, which my friend described as a dried, flavorless cracker wasn't substantial enough to hold all of the toppings. Hence it was a bit messy. The crust was not tasty on either pizza. Another problem is that the lobster was overcooked, and the corn seemed flavorless too. I was just disappointed. I kept salting and peppering it thinking it would get better but it didn't. The sausage pizza was spot on. Chunks of sausage and ricotta. You can't go wrong (except for the crappy crust). The setup is very chill and inviting, but I wasn't impressed with their wine options, though beer choices faired better--quite a few local brews. When I asked about a particular beer the waitress just stared at me blankly.

I was expecting to see more farmers' stands there based on what I'd read, but there were only two farmers and one baker stand. There were probably 40 to 50 tents set up that day. Most of the artists were selling gemstone jewelry or baby quilts -- things I didn't have to bother looking at to know that I didn't want or couldn't afford. However, there was a sweet old man selling pressed flower earrings (just like the ones I bought from an artisan in Argentina last year!), and the tents with the vintage gear were a pleasant surprise. I almost bought a bright red 70s trenchcoat for $30, but realized I'd have to carry it around all day and declined. I did get a beautiful pair of silver lotus flower earrings from a guy who says he travels to Thailand every few months to handpick these treasures from the locals. That probably means that he paid less than a dollar for them and I paid 20, but oh well. I bought some veggies from one of the farmers and some lavender cranberry lemonade from another stand (surprisingly delicious and refreshing!).

Florida's Mecca for great Asian food and also home to Florida's only Little Vietnam and Chinatown, however, I'll proceed to my point. The green tea patbingsu was delicious and refreshing and it had lots of green tea flavor. The cornflakes, mochi, and condensed milk gave it an interesting, but delicious twist. Snowbean is reminiscent of the hipster U.S. west coast Asian dessert cafes and it also has a sleek ambiance with a mix of Orlando hipster vibes mixed with we are not in the touristy part of Orlando and proud of it vibes. The location is great, there is a deck on the lake with seating that offers great views. However, the location is hidden. You have to make sure you're in the right lane on colonial eastbound and turn where there is a sign for Izziban Sushi and BBQ because Snowbean has no signage.

I was there before the meters were covered up, before the valet parkers were there, and it left a bad taste in my mouth.

Some greens and a couple strips of steak does not equal 20 bucks no matter how you slice it.  The outdoor seating is what Steph's is known for and I guess to some people, it feels very cool to see the crowd walking by Newbury and be seen.  To me, its just tacky to sit and pose while eating.

Two words. Yuu Poutine! I love my fries and I love my cheese and I love my Japanese flavours - So this poutine has it all. Crispy fries topped with melted, gooey mozzarella cheese, fine flakes of seaweed and dancing bonito flakes. The flavours were sweet, savoury and salty. Love love love!I also ordered the Hot Stone Beef bowl with cheese and sweet corn ($12.95). It was a huge sizzling stone bowl full of rice, minced beef, cheese, seaweed, and corn. Once all mixed together and you let it settle on the hot stone, the cheese and rice begin to caramelize and you get that delicious sticky, hard sweet layers. The dish also comes with average miso soup, a 3 mini sides of pickled radish, edamame and bean sprouts. My sister ordered the ramen, which seemed to be a popular item since 75% of the restaurant patrons were slurping away at, even with our 18¬∞+ weather. I tried a bit from my sister, the noodles were chewy and the broth was pretty good, the egg was done very nicely.The wait for food was around 10-15 minutes and service was nice (besides from a snarky whisper I heard from the waitress about another customer's cheap tip). Parking was atrocious as expected on a Richmond weekend but if you're wiling to walk a little, you can usually find a few parking spots on the lot further away. Cash Only!

I can come here and roam the isles and showcases for hours and have a blast! Today was no different, no furniture needed, but I did come here with purpose in mind. I wanted to buy a plant, yes a plant. I consider myself to have a fairly green thumb, I have an avid interest in the flora of things. A while back, coming to Ikea, I saw this really cool looking plant, but at the time I was funemployed and couldn't justify buying this wondrous natural creation. This particular want never really left my mind, so once me and some friends decided to come here, I knew that I was going to purchase this particular shrubbery.

The host was really condescending and rude, we asked for hot pot and he said it would be a 30 minute wait when there were 6 tables open. We were seated in the way back and our waiter had over 5 tables to take care of on his own. He was very short and rude with us, forgot drinks, forgot a big part of our meal, and then the manager proceeded to walk away with my phone to use the Groupon for 10 minutes. He handed it off to our waiter at some point and I watched my phone go to 4 tables when he was setting food down for other customers. The food as always was fantastic, the service sucked a lot.

Even when coming from a mediocre diner, if it's there, there's just something about that extra egg that hits the spot. But BurgerFi has changed the game with its right balance of maple.  Most times it's not too much, not too little, but just right (except for the last time, but I'm forgiving you). Then there's the Hippie Burger, which is a part of their secret menu (although it's actually right there in the menu under \\"Secret Menu\\") and is made with a quinoa patty.  Yum!  My first time trying a quinoa patty was in BurgerFi, and it totally tops other veggie patty or black bean patty options found in other restaurants.   As far as ice cream goes, it's not spectacular, but it has the right thickness to go with your burger and is available in red velvet or peanut butter chocolate, as well as your other traditional flavors. I enjoy the service here. They're super friendly and cool and don't mind changing the channel for me when there's a particular non-Boston game I want to see.  They're so cool that I think they add to the relaxed, yet bright aura that BurgerFi is going for. The fries are all right. The garlic parmesan fries look better than they actually are.  Also, their Chicago Hot Dog does not do the actual kind justice. Sorry. But overall, BurgerFi demonstrates its message well. Messages of sustainability are everywhere and it's done in a clean, stylish way. Also, with the grassfed and free-range options for meat, I feel better about spending my college budget here and not elsewhere for my burger fix.

The pizza was good. Everything else was too oily or just bland. Our server was cold and the service was slow. Our water glasses went without being refilled. He said he was going to get more water and instead started setting up for a large party. We ordered the Polenta Fries as an appetizer and they were horrible and perplexing. They looked and tasted like fried tofu. Completely bland. And the tomato sauce for dipping tasted like Ragu. They only became edible when we doctored them up with lots of seasoning and parmesan. Our entrees took way too long to arrive, especially considering it was after the lunch rush on a weekday and there were only a few other tables taken on the patio.My vegetable panini was so oily that I felt as though I needed a shower after handling it. It literally had a pool of oil underneath. Finally I just gave up on eating it like a sandwich and decided it was necessary to deconstruct it and eat it with a knife and fork. The flavors in the sandwich were decent, but it was nothing to write home about. And the olive and pepper salad that comes with it was entirely too spicy for comfort. My lips felt as though they were swollen and burning after just a few bites. I'll end with the one positive: The margherita pizza was delicious and very genuine. When I tried it, it occured to me that it tasted familiar to pizza I had experienced a lot of before. Where? Italy.

They even have bentos! Sushi, galbi, and bulgogi are the current options for lunch and dinner bentos. I have only tried their hand rolls, a couple of regular and special rolls, and sushi burritos. They really pack it on! It's delicious. One sushi burrito can definitely feed two people. The sushi rolls are fulfilling too - they don't skimp on ingredients here.

Thus, we visited on opening night.First the good: the decor has remained mostly the same with some big improvements.  The staff is very friendly, and the Thatch regulars came out to support them in a big, big way (the place was packed).  Also, it seems like they put in a new ventilation system, so the smell of year-old fry-o-later oil is gone (Yay!).  I was glad to see them add the \\"Suffering Bastard\\" to the drink menu (every Tiki bar should have one), and it was excellent.Now, the \\"meh\\":  the Mai Tai is not as good as the one we used to get at Thatch, and it's more expensive.  The staff behind the bar is slow.  I mean, really sloooooooow.  In fairness, it was really busy when we went, but we sat at the bar and watched them make drinks, and it was way, way, way too slow.  The other drinks ordered were OK, some were better than the original Thatch, and some weren't.  I agree with Steve R.'s review in that measuring every pour is a waste of time and money.   Good bartenders know how to make accurate cocktails without the constant use of a jigger.So, despite the speed of the bar staff (or lack thereof) and the other opening night hiccups, I believe that Hale Pele has the potential to become a Portland standard.  I expect that the drinks are only going to get better as the bar staff gets their feet under them, and the new owners are pretty cool.I will continue to come back and get my \\"Tiki\\" on.

Their bar menu, or \\"street menu,\\" has heavy Japanese influences, with touches of Chinese and Korean. If they really wanted to go street food, you should really go beyond just Japan.Their happy hour food menu has only a couple of decent deals (happy maki, fish and chips), everything else is priced comparably to the regular menu. The happy maki was pretty tasty, it's basically a spicy minced tuna roll. The fish and chips are battered lightly with tempura, served with sweet potato fries, faux tartar, and tempura sauce. Honestly, the fish and chips were probably the best thing there, but I was hoping for tastier treats that aren't American derived, so Tasting East (bar) was a bit of a letdown here.Their drink specials included many draft beers and well drinks for fairly cheap. I was surprised that none of their regular specialty martinis were discounted for happy hour. I guess they prefer people eating more and drinking less?Service deteriorated after the bar got full, which made it very difficult to leave for our movie on time. A part of our party remained and said that they were pretty much ignored for the rest of the evening, despite wanting to order more food.Overall, decent food, but poor service once it gets busy.

They were usually overcrowded, overpriced, laid out oddly, not so friendly, and with very inconsistent service. Once Goldberg's opened across Toco Hills Plaza, market demand for Bagel Palace plummeted, and I never went back. Today, at the urging of a friend, I returned to Bagel Palace for a taste of the old days. It did not taste good.Actually, the funny thing is, it tasted pretty good. Just like it always did. But the clear inadequacies in almost every other area are just non-starters for me. I do believe many businesses and service organizations have learned that they can simply just keep eating away at the quality of their product and trust that their lazy consumers won't budge.Sorry, Bagel Palace.

I cannot imagine she was much of the problem. 25 minutes later, we had 2 sides of sliced cucumbers in front of us, the restaurant had emptied out quite a bit, and I was still sitting with a fifth of a cup of cold coffee. We spoke with the server and she promised to check. Another 10 minutes later, I went to the register and spoke to the owner. I told him we had been waiting for over 30 minutes for our simple orders and we were not happy. He said not a word, but nodded and went into the back. About 10 minutes later, the food is served. Bagels, a knish, lox, eggs and onions, an omelette, all fine. The server apologizes and offers to comp out beverages (Huh?? At brunch? It's coffee and sweet tea!). The owner does not appear, does not apologize, does not offer an explanation, and clearly does not want to retain our business. And so he won't.I look forward to the final market exit of Bagel Palace. Maybe Goldberg's will open a sister location!

We also had a margherita pizza, which was the best part of the meal, in my opinion.  The beer *was* delicious ... they offered a variety of in house brewed beers that just taste better than your everyday domestic brews.  The CBC beer was a little more potent as well.  We did have to ask the bartenders for everything -- for menus, to order, for refills, to clear our plates -- and they were not slammed busy, so that was kind of a let down, but they were friendly and welcoming when we did get their attention.

I had the wagyu flatiron while my 2 friends split the porterhouse for two. We split a cheeseplate and the melon and prosciutto appetizer to get started. There were 3 types of melon which was a very nice surprise. The cheeses were all highly artisanal and similarly delicious. We then moved into a salad course which I bypassed, but my friends had a classic wedge salad which they raved about. We also split 3 sides, the mac n cheese which is topped with fresh scallions and candied red onions, the smashed potatoes which were smashed red potatoes with cheese, bacon and scallions. (Think mashed potatoes with the skins left in plus the aforementioned.) and their fresh cut fries. All of which were really excellent.

Miraculously, it is also a 2-minute walk from my house. How did I get so lucky?!The owner/chef is incredibly sweet and hard-working. He once chased me down the street after realizing that he forgot to include my dinner's accompanying chutney! (it really is delicious chutney). He knows that I like things extra spicy, so he always confirms this with me while working his spice-tastic magic over the stove.Yesterday my friend chatted with the owner in Punjabi for a while, and I discovered that it is really not nice to walk in at 8:45 and order a full meal (with chapatti or paratha, dal, and raita in addition to the entree and rice). Since we came in kind of late, we just ordered ala carte stuff (comes with rice and chutney).The owner also told my friend that if he ever wants samosas, he should give him a call beforehand so that they can be fresh (while some yelpers have given the samosas positive reviews, realistically they were probably sitting in that case for a while). I am unsure if this offer applies only to native Punjabi speakers...I also like that the owner laughed at my friend when he said that the spicy dish was for me and the mild one was for himself. Past hits here:\\nChicken Vindaloo\\nChicken Tikka Chile\\nChicken Tikka Masala\\nChicken SaagThe full meals are a great deal (just don't order them at 8:45!!), since the dal is oh so good and hearty (I think there are a lot of cloves and other earthy spices in it) and you can't go wrong with either the chappati (cooked in ghee on 1 side) or the paratha (cooked in ghee on both sides). Er, I might have those two backwards, but, regardless, both bread choices are delicious.Good fresh mangoes are usually available here also.Credit card minimum of $10 (Visa and MC)."},{"name":"Shoestring Cafe","address":"4611 No 6 Road, Suite 180","city":"Richmond","stars":"4.5","text":"Seems like this Yelp app doesn't want to post the reviews I upload sometimes.

It was succulent soft off the bone juicy good.  Nicely finished in the oven to give it that warmth feeling, that a bit of roasting can only do. \\nMy brother had his steak NY cut Chicago style.  He likes his meat well well well done.  Poor guy. But, he did enjoy it much.  My baby had her pasta which I helped by nibbling er sampling I mean. To see how the carbonara sauce tasted.  It was good, lots of cheese.  You could definitely taste the salty Parmesan, which I love BTW.   Mmmmmmmmm creamy yummy salty and saucy!  I just love it! My Aunt who can be as picky as a French Food critic from Gourmet Magazine from the 60's loves this place.  Now I had to see how good it was at lunch.  Knowing it's a lot busier during the weekday lunch break.  Lunch.\\nCame with some colleagues but decided to come a bit earlier as the waiter suggested during one of our dinner meals there. \\nWhen we got there, only two tables occupied with a big table reserved for 8.  When we sat down checked the menu and the daily specials on the board.  It started to pile in and get busy.  Ordered up our meals and waited for the food to come.  The chefs experience brought the food out in a timely manner. Colleague 1 ordered the special curry dish. Too spicy for her even though I told her it was spicy.  And her eyes popped out at how big her dish was. Quickly offered me some.  She liked it, but would have enjoyed it more if less spicy.  However I did sample and the spiciness was just the right amount of heat for me.  Oh!  Forget her dish came with a regular sized bowl of soup.Colleague 2 ordered vegetarian curry and rice. It too was decent sized.  Both took #doggybags home. Moi?  I had the NY steak trio with salad and soup.  My trio was a good size.  With smaller portion of soup and salad.  Steak was dine medium rare and nicely seasoned.   Hmmmm.  I wonder if he worked at Carvers or Some steak house before.  I had his rib eye which was very nice. His lamb, even better.\\nI rated my dish another decent 4 and my dinners lamb a 5 based on price, serving size and service.  Lunch, they have a larger menu and bigger staff.  This is where they do most of their business.  It's their prime time. I can now faithfully say this is a good rock solid eatery that is here to stay.

Based on the exterior I wasn't sure of the restaurant's greatness, but immediately upon entering I could see what a beautiful and special place Guadalajara is.The entire staff is friendly and makes you feel very comfortable.  They provide excellent service by replacing items (like the delish complimentary chips) and refilling drinks (like their exquisite margaritas) without even asking; they are observant and focused on delivering excellent customer service.The \\"mole poblano\\" is a unique chicken dish that has a spicy chocolate sauce.  I felt like trying something new and was quite pleased with my choice.  The chicken was moist and the sauce was unlike anything I've tried before.  Overall, it was a delicious meal.  Recently, I brought my friends from out of town to the restaurant because I have been so pleased with the food and service.  They were also extremely pleased with their food and margaritas and compared it to other Mexican restaurants they love. Guadalajara is now one of the best authentic Mexican restaurants they've been to.Again, I love the service.  The waiters we've had have been so attentive and pleasant.  They make us feel extremely welcome.

I had the eggs Benedict and they really need to chuck their recipe for their hollandaise sauce. The biscuit was tough as if it was frozen and they defrosted it in a microwave and the eggs were way over cooked and dry.Their orange juice is a bit over priced since she poured it into my glass from some store brand bottle and she also gave me my check before I even got to my grits. Which tasted more like gruel. Also, through my whole meal the waitress never cleared some of the dishes from the previous diner. Or wiped down the counter.

My only complaint is that it is freezing sometimes, but they do provide some fleece blankets for you. The one thing that I will keep coming back for is the patbingsu, which is probably the most authentic one I've had in Orlando. The staff is also friendly and attentive. The reason for this being 3 stars is mostly due to their prices. I do not understand their pricing structure as a small (12 oz) is about $4-5, while a medium (16 oz) is $7-8. The price per ounce is significantly higher with the larger size. Also, they import their pastries from Atlanta, so they are not made fresh daily, which is probably why they keep it so cold in there. While the taste and texture is still retained for the most part, they are still very overpriced compared to the bakeries in other cities that do bake fresh pastries daily (such as Paris Baguette). Finally, they do sell some popsicles that are also severely overpriced. For example, a Melona bar is $4.50 for one, while a box is available for purchase at an Asian supermarket down Colonial for just a little more than that."},{"name":"Chopstix Chinese & Sushi Cuisine","address":"4300 W Lake Mary Blvd","city":"Lake Mary","stars":"3","text":"Ordered delivery from here.

Now the noodles were flat and not like any other lo mein noodle I've had before, but they were great. I liked them a lot. And the meat itself tasted good. But the lack of meat turned my beef lo mein into a bowl of noodles. And that's not good. The white rice came free and tasted like any other white rice. I mean, it's plain white rice. What do you expect...\\nOverall the price was decent. Totaled $15 for all the food (small bourbon chicken, large beef lo mein, side of white rice, and a can of Pepsi) but there is a 3 dollar delivery charge added on plus tip if you're feeling so inclined.

I must have had some glittery notion that you would be my elusive, unique BBQ experience I've searched for. Redbones doesn't have high quality food, but simply a good time, great beer selection and interesting downstairs bar. Blackstrap is great, but no atmosphere to be enough of a draw. The \\"real thing\\" down South was a little too homestyle for me. Considering all the hype around this place, and the fact that it always seems packed, I guess I was hoping for some kind of suave atmosphere, good food, exceptional service and an interesting take on the BBQ phenomenon. Well, Sweet Cheeks, you were a bit of a disappointment. I will try to mitigate my rating by offering some context: it was my birthday and my first time at this restaurant (maybe putting these two factors together was a gamble, but I figured, what's to lose? The biscuits are supposedly to die for and there'll be mac and cheese!) My brother immediately commented that he was surprised I picked this place for a birthday dinner, as he had dined here before. At this point, however, I had already been thinking the same thing, perusing the menu and noticing the clientele (unmistakably hipster-heavy) and bare -- although somewhat rustic  --atmosphere. Not that there's anything wrong with these things. It just bordered on hokey (tin mugs for drinks, long wooden picnic-like tables for dining and buckets...lots of buckets) and I had something different in mind. Anyway, the service was a bit disorganized and no staff had any personality whatsoever, creating a rather bland experience. Honestly, the food wasn't super-memorable except for the biscuits, which they charge $10 for (a bucket of 4). Also, this:Me: Can I have a Jameson and ginger?\\nServer: We are an All-American bar, so we only stock American-made beverages. Boo! Ok, I'll respect that. I ended up with a decent cocktail (that cost $11) made with bourbon. But, if you've read my reviews, you know I give credit to places that craft a menu (including cocktails) as this is the establishment's way of putting their best out there. If you say you can make an $11 bourbon cocktail extremely well, I will believe you and try it. In this case though, the Jameson and ginger probably would have been more interesting."},{"name":"El Cubo de Cuba","address":"SW Alder St & Sw 10th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Best Cubano sandwich in town.

She asked me to taste mine and make sure it was what I asked for. In no way did this look like a mojito but it did taste like someone added coconut liqueur to rum, so I said it was fine for now.

I've eaten here for years and the ladies at the counter are very sweet and welcoming. My order is rarely wrong and I could even say almost always correct. There is lots of window light and it's a great morning spot to get a bit of work done.......Except:) every single time I'm here, the back of house team(cooks,prep etc) are always(I do mean always) operating at the \\"volume and tact of a construction crew working on the highway with broken radios\\". It used to bother me but has now become something that I look forward to! I think I enjoy it because it is so bizarre and life can be predictable at times.At this moment one of the gentlemen is practicing his chewbaca impressions and it's taking a while for him to feel like he's nailed it. Another, moments ago was referring to some form of anatomy(undisclosed) to which he described as huge, like Tucan Sam. Even though the content is consistently unbelievable, volume is the thing that is most impressive. Anyone can rap for 12 minutes while making sandwiches, but not everyone can do it at full blast. It's not \\"a bit\\" loud \\"sometimes\\". It's quite loud and constant every single time. And if you enjoy absurdity as entertainment, you should definitely stop by this location in the morning. 4 stars with headphones, 1-2 without.I've got to go!

Since we walked by this place on the way to Kintaro, we opted for this place instead. There was no wait for 4 and we were here on a Saturday night around 7pm.I loved the Miso Ramen here! It's a pretty big bowl so I think it's plenty to share with 2. There is like a $8 minimum per person, however, so I suggest ordering a ramen and then some side dishes like gyoza so that it equals about $8/per person. The menu here is very easy to read. They have pictures and describe the broth and toppings very well so you know exactly what you'll be getting with no surprises.This place is run by Japanese people so you know you'll be getting some authentic ramen. Although I thought the ramen was good, I didn't really think it was amazing....The seats are wooden stools, so if you don't have a big butt like me, you might start feeling uncomfortable by the end of your meal. Also, there are hooks along the wall where you can hang your jacket, but there definitely aren't enough hooks for everyone. We had to hang 3 jackets and 2 handbags on one hook which was inconvenient.Since there are many other ramen places in the area which have great reviews, I will most likely be visiting those instead next time I'm in town."},{"name":"Frank's Steak House","address":"2310 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"I met my dad for dinner in Cambridge, as has become our custom on my trips through New England. Tonight we decided we were in the mood for steaks. Since I still had to drive to Maine after dinner we decided to go to Frank's Steak House since it's near his apartment and wouldn't be a drawn out dinner like one of the High End Steakhouses. On walking in I noticed the decor was going for old school steakhouse, but it was a little too old school. It could definitely use some updating. It wasn't falling apart or anything, just dated. After we were seated we found we were in luck, wedge salads were on the daily specials menu (and at $3.75 a deal) and I love wedge salads before I get a steak. The wedge came out and was large, fresh and smothered in Bleu Cheese and Bacon. So far so good. We both got a cup of New England Clam Chowder as one of our sides (since a house salad didn't make sense and the wedge couldn't be substituted in). The clam chowder was good, not the best I've had, but good. For our entrees we both decided to order the same thing, Frank's Special a Strip Steak dubbed \\"The Sizzler\\" because it's served in on a sizzling hot cast iron skillet. This idea I really liked, honestly it reminded me a little of Peter Luger's and their steaming hot plates you can actually use to cook your steak more if desired. The NY Strip was a decent size and cooked perfectly (even if the waitress did reverse my medium with my dad's medium rare, costing me a bite he had quickly consumed ...) The steaks were both juicy and flavorful. I was definitely happy with my meal and plenty full. Our waitress was extremely attentive and quick with refills and staging our meal. Finally the price really couldn't be beat. For the 2 of us the bill was $52 before tip. You'd spend more than that at a chain steakhouse for 2 steaks, drinks and an appetizer. I definitely got a good meal for a good deal at Frank's Steakhouse."},{"name":"South End Open Market","address":"375 Harrison Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"A fun way to spend a Sunday....I dragged my boyfriend to this, and honestly ladies just leave your guys at home.

The prices of course varied, but for the most part everything was affordable. I found jewelry ranging from as low as $6.00 to $100.00. the artwork ranged from $35 to a couple hundred. Not as much of a variety of food as I was expecting, but no real complaints. I also expected more music to be going on, but it could just be the weekend I was their.

It was your basic fare.  And it was good!  I had the House Special Tofu and the boyfriend had the shrimp in some kind of sauce.  He liked mine, I didn't try his. The vegetarian egg roll was super good.  In fact, it was super stuffed.   When I bit into it, stuff fell out.  Yum!  It was so good!  I loved it.  They brought you quite a bit of food.  I took at least half home, and I was super full (and this is coming from a not small girl,  Believe me, look at my pictures).  The best part was that is was priced normally.  Mine was $7.25!  Can you believe a price like that in Austin for a meal?  I think that is a normal price, but by the looks of everywhere else, I have lost my mind in thinking so.  We spent less that $20.  Amazing these days!My only gripe (which is a small one) is that no vegetarian option offed in the dinner special section.  However, all the dinners where served with a vegetarian egg roll.  Odd,.  Or maybe not.  Just something I noticed.All in all, yummy Chinese (or Americanized Chinese) food at an incredibly reasonable price.  Service was quick.  It was very quiet!

The menu - you can get anything from a good burger and buffalo tenders  to a very fancy special. The CBC also seems to cater to my vegetarian friends, so that makes picking a location to meet up quite a bit easier. The beer - my god, the beer. There are 4 brews made year round, and they all have their merits. My personal favorite is the Cambridge Amber. The novice beer drinker may be turned off by the deep reddish brow color of the brew, but it's actually quite an easy beer to drink. I could drink this brew till the day i die and be happy. My 2nd favorite has to be the Charles River Porter. A nice porter, with a hint of chocolate - it won't disappoint. Next up is the Tall Tale Pale Ale, easily one of the best local Pale Ales. Perfect in the summer time. Last, we've got the Golden - and unfortunately  i rarely order this brew, as it seems to be geared towards the less adventurous beer drinker.

We couldn't decide on entrees so we ordered 3 for the 2 of us. Carnitas, beef tenderloin skewer and chiles en nogada.The food arrived fairly quickly and we dug in. Carnitas were authentic large pieces of pork cooked in pork fat. The beef skewer was very tender, cooked medium rare with a nice grilled taste. The chiles dish, the most expensive at $16 was truly traditional and well prepared.

I think I've found my new happy place.So, full disclosure, I'm kind of a grilled sandwich fiend. In early college my sandwich press was all that kept me from wasting away in a mountain of books. So, few things make me angrier than a mediocre pressed sandwich. Luckily, Toasted took my notion of a flavorful grilled sandwich and humbled the heck out of it!These guys and gals know how to flavor a sandwich!! It was hard to pick from the amazing variety (including seasonal sandwiches!), but I went with the Blackberry Melt. This behemoth of flavor was filled with Fontina cheese, applewood smoked bacon, blackberry mash, and the always-good addition- arugula. I liked the saltiness of the bacon pieces with the acidity of the blackberry mash, though I'm a sauce girl, so I might ask for extra mash on the side for dipping!As much as I liked my order, I must admit that the ol' boyfriend won. I got to try his Fig & Goat sandwich (one of Toasted's signature dishes) and nearly fell of my chair it was so good! It was filled with Havarti (my favorite cheese! So buttery!), Goat cheese, mission figs, basil, and honey. ~sigh~ This. Sandwich. Was. The. Jam. (Pun very much intended.)But wait! There's more! Do not, under any circumstances, leave without ordering the rosemary truffle fries. The owner let me know she sprinkles them with nicotine, which gives them their strangely addictive power. LIES.

Diner on Wheels has allowed me many firsts, on 1st street (pun, hehe): 1st to review, 1st time to eat New Mexican flavors from a trailer, and 1st time I have ever squirted chicken juice in my nose.  For these firsts, I am thankful.  I did wish that they did not run out of their best-seller green chile stew.Diners on Wheels does what most trailers find a way to do in some fashion or another: offer unique trailer food.  The specialties gear toward spicy flavors and green chiles.  The food is amazingly cheap, and the flavors are great, but the textures could use some tweaking.The green chile-cheese turkey slider was not bad.  They must form these patties by hand because my turkey had nice herbs mixed in, and it was the size of a slider... I do not know of any manufacturers that spit out 3 oz. portions of herb ground turkey.  The American cheese and zippy green chiles gave it a definite New Mexican flare; sadly, the meat was slightly dry, and the bun was very stale.The sweet potato tots (if they were homemade, woohoo!--I could not tell) were unique, but they were bland and lukewarm.  They could have used salt and some extra frying.The chicken wings were really juicy, and as mentioned before, I bit into one right out of the fire, and my nose started burning.  Yes, the juice was hot, but it was also a testament to the fiery rub they put on the wings.  The wings were alright, but nothing special.Go check out DoW if you are one of those trailer hounds.

The beans were a little soupier than I prefer but had that deliciously pungent white cheese, like you get in Old Mexico, on them. The tamales were good but were light on the pork.

It's almost like you're visiting a little corner of Japan, rather than an unassuming, hidden gem in a random Walmart plaza.The service is fantastic.  They really make you feel welcome and they are very attentive.  With that said, make sure you always reserve, because we made that mistake the first time we went an hour after they opened and it was packed full, with groups waiting outside.It is a tiny establishment, with like 6 tables and a dozen seats on the sushi bar, and the environment is relaxed and almost like somebody else's home, so nobody is feeling like rushing through their food to get out.  On the contrary, time will pass and you won't notice it.The food is great, and unlike any other Japanese food I've had, even the good ones from Sushi Katana and Izziban Sushi.  I've been wanting authentic ramen for ages, and that's exactly what drew me in here.My girlfriend and I have gone four times here, so we've sampled quite a bit. Here's the rundown of what we've had:GYOZA APPETIZER - very good but they only give you like five or six tiny gyoza.  I guess that equal two big gyoza from other places.  It just looks a bit pathetic when they bring it out, still, my girlfriend loves them.UDON - great!  even if you don't like fishy things, the broth is outstandingly tasty! Best freakin' Japanese broth I've ever had!RAMEN - disappointing, compared to the udon. Stick to thick noodly goodness!GYUDON RICE BOWL - Fantastic!  They might go a bit crazy with the ginger at times, but even then, it is very, very tasty!PORK KATSUDON BOWL - good enough, but the sweet profile of the pork cutlets is weird, if you were not expecting it.  I was tired of it by the end of the bowl.DRAGON ROLL SUSHI - the one with avocados on top.  Very refreshing and tasty.LADY FINGERS SUSHI - just okay.  This one didn't rise to the expectations I had for it.FRIED ICE CREAM - Great!Even though, we have not found everything to be amazing, if we were to stick to the udon and gyudon rice bowl, we'd be in Japanese cuisine heaven every time.  I am adventurous enough to try new things here and there, but it's good to fall back to the favorites, and I do that often.This is our favorite Japanese restaurant in Orlando right now, because it does feel like we're stepping into foreign soil and sampling their foods, every single time we go, even when they recognize us as regulars now and it kinda feels like a friend's house at dinnertime."},{"name":"Cambridge Brewing Company","address":"1 Kendall Sq, Bldg 100","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"I give 5 of these stars to the CBC just because I like beer more than you and I know better and perhaps I will only concede if you agree with me and admit that you (yourself) likes beer as much as I do and we can see each other as equals.

I do like thick burger buns, but they need to be soft, not dry like three pieces of sandwich bread packed together on top and then underneath the burger contents\\n2. meat, not much flavor, though I like knowing that the meat is fresh and not frozen, I still don't really taste anything\\n3.  mushrooms didn't have much taste, not sure why that became part of standard fixings here.  and I didn't really like the sauteed or something white onions, didn't have a taste either.\\n4.  cajun fries were regular fries with \\"cajun seasoning,\\" the seasoning is a little spicy, maybe there is cheyenne in it or something, in addition to the little of other seasonings they have in their shaker.  i want to say paprika is in that shaker too, but I can't put my finger on the rest of it\\n5.  toooooooooooo many signs about how they're the best burger or best fries in various cities, one sign said something like the willy wonka of burgers?I did not stray from the basic hamburger with regular fixings, because I like trying the basics first before getting into complicated things.Needless to say, I shant come back.  I'd rather go to McCormick & Schmick's for happy hour and pay $1.95 for their burger.  Bun, beef patty, lettuce, tomato, red onion.  A  bigger width-wise than Five Guys, the bun bread is nice and soft, and the meat has actual flavor.  I don't even need to put ketchup or mustard on it.\\nAnd well, I'm a Pterry's fan, so it's hard to not support local even though I am on a college budget.  All the signs boasting about how they're the best in other cities, was actually a complete turn-off.  Call me uppity if you wish, but I prefer supporting local.  I'd just rather have a double with cheese, and the skinny fries from Pterry's.But, I do like thick cut fries, I just didn't like how greasy they were at Five Guys.However, Pterry's is not the best burger I've had so far in Austin (still hunting).  So far my #1 is the Z burger at Z tejas, whatever they use for bun bread is pure genius.  #2 is the tony burger at Magnolia.  #3 is McCormick's.Haven't tried the Zee burger at Chez Zee, but I'm looking forward to it.\\nI still have many more burger places to try before I make a final decision."},{"name":"Tortas El Guero","address":"5415 Cameron Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"These are great tortas.

We booked a birthday party there recently (for a group of 16), and everybody reported having a great time.  The atmosphere is relaxed, the decor is welcoming, and the sommeliers are happy to give you as many (or few) wine details/insights as you would like.  There's an obvious passion for both wine and food and the artful pairing of the two.If you go there for dinner, some of our favorite menu items include:\\n * Sweet Peppers Stuffed With Honeyed Goat Cheese -- everyone everyone seems to love these.  They go fast at a party.\\n * House Pimento Cheese with flatbread cracker -- not at all your typical pimento cheese spread, this stuff is amazing!\\n * Candied Bacon -- this was a choice on the event menu and a favorite by our group.  If you've never tried candied bacon, you're in for a real treat!\\n * Chicken Lollipops -- all of the flavors are good, though our favorites were the sweet wasabi soy and the chimichurri parmesan.\\n * Slider Quartet -- of the 4 flavors, my two favorites are the housemade chorizo and the lamb slider.And let's not forget the wine tasting.  Though several types of wines are available from the bar, VV has a wide selection of wine available through their Enomatic wine machines (card purchase required).  This is a fantastic way to get a taste, 1/2 glass, or full glass of an expensive bottle of wine at a fraction of the cost.I fully endorse VV and would encourage anyone to check it out for a date or a group party.

Finding a deal on Yelp sealed the deal as far as choosing a place to dine at!The ambiance was very casual. Inside was cramped and dark. You order at the counter and then your food is brought out to you. There weren't any tables that were designed for parties of 4 or more inside, so we had to sit outside. Not exactly ideal given the sweltering heat at noon, but it could have been a lot worse!The menu is designed so you pick your meat/filling, then you pick what you'd like it in (sandwich, plate, etc). There were some house specials as well, but I was interested in trying some staples. The prices were reasonable for the amount of food you got-- in the $7-$10 range, but I would like to see some cheaper options for a lunch place! Maybe I'm just old fashioned and dreaming of the days where I could get a lunch for $5, who knows. While my group was waiting for our food, someone brought out some orange slices for us to snack on and a Turkish dessert to try (the name escapes me right now). It was a very nice touch! The dessert was a little too sweet for the table's liking, but we are all somewhat odd when it comes to those sorts of things.The consensus at the table was that the food overall was tasty. I had the chicken kebab sandwich and got a side of falafel. I felt like the food in general was somewhat bland, particularly the hummus (a few others at the table agreed). It wasn't bad, per se, I just think it could have had some more spices added to it. The chicken was well cooked though and the pita was delicious. The falafel was pretty standard, not anything different from other Mediterranean places I've tried in the past. The portions were generous though, so we all had to take things home in a box! Always a bonus. The food was not heavy at all and even though we all had a lot, I think everyone left feeling refreshed.Service was excellent. Our food came out in waves, which was understandable, but everything came out quickly and was perfectly cooked. Also, all of the people working there were very friendly and kind. The only thing I wish were different was the way the drinks are handled: you have to get up and walk inside to the soda fountain, but if you order water you only get those tiny plastic cups, so everyone was getting up frequently to get refills.That being said, the overall experience was a good one. The food was decent, the ambiance fitting, and the service excellent.

We were pleasantly surprised by the complimentary bottled water (choice of sparkling or still) and loved our appetizer (grilled octopus wrapped in Boston Bibb lettuce leaves with a spicy dipping sauce).  Our seafood entrees (including the whole grilled trout), drinks and desserts all hit the mark.  Warning to diners who park on Crescent Street...

They came with some tomato sauce, pesto and a generous amount of shaved Parmesan.  Tasty but not special.  The mushroom bisque is delicious, served with a crostini and local wild mushrooms.  The salads are generously sized and super fresh, probably sourced from the garden that's right outside the hotel.For our main courses, we tried some pasta and the veal Osso Bucco.  All the pastas are house made and fresh.  The fettuccine with lobster and shrimp was delicious except that the shrimp were over cooked.  The shells with basil and mint pesto was light and herbaceous, very tasty.  The veal Osso Bucco was was unfortunately a disappointment.  A shame that a dish renowned for richness and savoriness was bland and unrewarding.  Where were the pan drippings?  Where was that rich sauce?  The meat is served on a bed of creamy Parmesan polenta which was nice but there was no sauce.  Come on!  I had to ask for salt which came out of the salt shaker in such small amounts that I must have looked comical shaking it and shaking it over my plate.  Plus, there was a small fork placed in the shank bone for getting the marrow out.  Note to restaurant - it's supposed to be a spoon.  Hard to scoop marrow out of the bone with a fork.For dessert we had the warm chocolate lava cake - budino - it was very good though the fresh mint ice cream was sort of toothpaste-like in flavor, like spearmint, definitely a whoa! moment in a bad way.Not having a 1/2 star option for reviews, I rounded up to 3 stars.

Either I continue throughout the store and realize they were still behind me. Everytime I looked at an item, they would stop and talk or pretend they are looking at something. It's when I realized I was being followed. I finally get down to Self-Serve and thought they went their own ways after not seeing them. I head to urinate to the restrooms, when I walk out, there they were waiting for me from a distance pretending they weren't looking at me. So I decided to get the hell out of there.

The restaurant was nicely decorated on the inside and they were playing PBS over the intercom, which I strangely enjoyed. The food was decent but a little overpriced in my opinion. There's a lunch special sign for $6 lemongrass chicken which was why we stopped in (and because Little Bangkok was closed) but apparently that's only Monday-Friday. I had the shrimp bun which was my least favorite of the entrees. Too little fish sauce so everything was bland except the shrimp itself. The chicken pho was pretty good pho and the bo luc lac was better than some other places I've tried. The salad it came with wasn't a traditional vietnamese salad, more more americanized with the dressing, but it was good nonetheless. Pretty good portion sizes on everything but again a little overpriced. If they lowered their prices by about $2-$3 per entree I think I would be much more inclined to come back."},{"name":"Shabu & Mein","address":"148 1st St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"This restaurant looks great. The food is just about ok BUT the service is terrible. \\nMy wife and I showed up for the first time last week. Upon entering the restaurant: The server asked if we were there to eat \\"Ramen\\" or \\"Shabu\\". We weren't sure yet and asked what we should choose (needing a little refresher course on ramen).We felt very unwelcome when the server just turned away to take care of something else. Saying \\"oh give me a moment\\", or \\"let me tell you about Ramen and Shabu...\\" would have been normal.  We settled on ramen and were escorted to the way back of the restaurant. \\nThe server took our order of cocktails and food. No greeting, no water, no utensils.Our food came first... still no utensils. My wife asked about our cocktails, and mentioned that they should usually come before our food. We also ask for utensils. Cocktails arrive, no utensils. We ask again, utensils finally arrive, with some water and cocktails again! This place is very disorganized and places little value on the customer.

Pros:1. THE FOOD, OF COURSE. I had the Sea Island Pea Shakshuka with Egg, Fennel, Turnips, Tomato, and Roti (on the side with ghee). Delicious! The Shakshuka was earthy and warm and delicious! I would definitely order it again! My friends tried the Egg Sandwich (with tomato, onion, shiitake aioli, half scramble, and English muffin), Creme Brulee toast (with whipped creme Fraiche and Steen's Cane Syrup), and the Pork Tamale (wrapped in cabbage with refried sea island peas, soft poached egg, and roti). Everyone liked what they ordered, but I would say that the Egg Sandwich left my friend a little underwhelmed! 2. For brunch, the dim sum cart becomes a pastry cart! We tried the cheddar, shrimp salt scone (really interesting, salty, and soft - more like a biscuit than a scone!) and the lemon tartlets! The tartlets were good, but I couldn't stop eating the scone!3. Beverages - two of us had mimosas ($7 a piece), which were okay, but nothing too special. They had a gorgeous mescal guava cocktail when we were there, but at $14/piece, neither of us could justify upgrading from the mimosa. One of us got coffee. The coffee set was super cute, coffee was strong, and refills are free. 4. Amazing decor (definitely modern looking inside). Bathrooms were very nice (although - and I say that as a loyal NPR listener, the NPR in the bathroom stalls was weird and taking hipster a little TOO far). The bad? They were running a bit late on service - we had a reservation for 12:45 on Sunday, and we didn't get seated until closer to 1 - and there was no where to wait! The restaurant is VERY tight - we had to wait for our table outside (luckily it didn't start pouring until AFTER we got our table)! All in all, it was a great meal!

In general that's pretty good and for a Friday night, even better! (I do wish their online ordering through Beyond Menu included an ETA though.)I ordered scallion pancakes, crab rangoon, the orange chicken bowl with shrimp lo mein instead of rice, and one piece of suzuki (I'm a pig, I know. But I've got leftovers!). Scallion pancakes were very flavorful but a bit soggy since they come in the plastic containers. The crab rangoons were nice and crispy but nothing special inside. The orange chicken bowl was great! So much food for the price! I hardly got to the lo mein but what I tried of it was good. Since it's all in one bowl, be aware that the orange sauce will be all over the lo mein--I don't mind, but some people might. Lastly, the suzuki was delicious. The rice was soft and the fish was tender. Makes me want to try their signature rolls.All in all, very good value. You get a great amount of food for the price.

I must say I enjoy the decor of the restaurant. Right down to the mini mason jar glass ware they serve cocktails in. Just as an FYI the platters can feed two people and I suggest against it for a single person unless your starving.  The sandwich's are open face and definitely give you an opportunity to taste the delicious beef though the chicken sandwich is dry it's still pretty good especially if you add sauce. The biscuits are something that you have to have.  They are as big as your face, when you add the honey butter it just makes your younger wanna slap your brain. But be careful as these things are filling. So if your going to jump into a full meal don't over do it with these delicious morsels. The one down side for me is the fact it's just reeks of swine. I don't eat pork and the smell of swine has always bothered me,but even with me having that small issue it's totally worth it. And from what friends told me the pork belly is a must have.

The store is on the small side, and the selection is not comprehensive, but damned if they don't make some tasty cakes.  The presentation is great--all brightly glazed fruits and decadent cocoa coloring.  And the taste is spot on for the Chinese palate...never cloyingly sweet or thickly iced.  (Caveat: for those, however, who like their desserts on the sweeter side, the items here, like other good Asian bakeries, may be a bit too bland.)  Their mango mousse cake is the type of thing you take one bite of, and then spend the next 5 minutes embroiled in an inner struggle between wanting to stuff the whole delicious thing in your mouth at once, and slowly savoring each sumptuous taste.

My advice:\\n  Enjoy dinner and drinks on the 2nd floor.  We have done both and many of the specialty cocktails are only on the menu there and they have some great ones.   According to the bartenders downstairs, they don't have the equipment to make some of the \\"upstairs\\" drinks. In the first floor bar they will make or concoct what you like and drinks were good but not like upstairs.\\n   If you are going on a Thursday, Friday or Saturday, make reservations or go early like 6 p.m. early.Attitude adjustment??  Maybe.  I have read several of the reviews that mention this so I will add my 2 cents.  My take is that they like to give people a bit of a hard time maybe to convey that they are booked all the time..  Went to make reservations for a Saturday night in February 2016 for 5 people. Called 2 weeks in advance.  First they said to call back since they couldn't take reservations until after 3.  When I called back they said to call back the next day.   One Saturday evening a few weeks ago my husband and I walked in at 6:15 and wanted to sit at the bar.  Now there was no one sitting at the bar but they still said they had to check their book.

Since I was in one of the main sushi districts of Vancouver, I thought I'd find out what the \\"new\\" place was brining to the table. On first glance, I was wondering if I made a mistake of coming, since the restaurant was pretty small, had only one table with 2 people at it and many of the chairs and tables were mismatched.  I'm glad I stayed as the quality to price ratio was great!  It should be noted the sushi bar looked very new in comparison to other parts of the restaurant.  Not just new, but very clean, which I think is absolutely mandatory for a sushi restaurant.The food offerings were plentiful and looked great on the menu. A dinner bento box will run you somewhere from $5-7, with one of two boxes being around $9.  I ordered their big sushi box (I can't remember the number or exact name), but it was the most expensive box on the menu at $9.50.   My girlfriend ordered one of the traditional bento boxes for $5. Like most sushi places, we were given complimentary tea with the meal and miso soup before the sushi arrived.   Both were standard sushi house tea and soup, with no complaints.  As soon as we were done with our soups the sushi arrive.  My option arrived on a raised plank presenting the sushi, while my girlfriend's was in a traditional bento box. My sushi plate had a lot of sushi on it - at least 8-10 sashimi pieces, and another 8+ pieces of rolls (the board was packed).  To add to this, all the sushi was tasty, with not one item tasting off or having bad texture.  This was very pleasantly surprising, since I was going in with a slightly pessimistic mind set and expecting something to taste a \\"little pre-packaged\\" or tougher since the price was as low as it was.  My girlfriend got veggie tempura with 2 large prawn tempura, chicken terriyaki, rice, 4 giant pieces of California roll and a small mixed green salad.  As I was, she was also very happy with her choice.  With each of us sharing, we could not finish all the food.At the end, with a good tip the price was less than $20.  This is pretty darn good for two people to be completely stuffed and with good quality.

After reading a bit of the menu, we ordered 2 medium pizzas and garlic fries to be picked up.I'll start with the garlic fries, which sounded really good, but was a big let down. At first, it didn't seem like the fries were even seasoned with garlic at all. The fries did taste like they were frozen. After a few, we found that all of the seasoning for the fries was at the bottom of the to-go dish. The garlic seasoning was decent tasting, we just had to pick it off the bottom and sprinkle it over the fries ourselves (after we had added garlic salt ourselves).The pizza itself wasn't too bad for me (I had the pepperoni, sausage, and olive). It came with a good amount of toppings for each. The crust of the pizza was fine for me, wasn't too greasy either. My fianc√©e had a chicken, garlic, and feta pizza. The flavors of it were really good but the crust of the pizza wasn't all that great at all, was bland and seemed like it was frozen.Overall, not a bad experience, I'm not sure if we'll go back, maybe if we were in the area again, we would.

Smoked pico, crispy garlic and a thin stream of buttermilk brought all the flavors together and micro-cilantro provided a finish that was perfect.\\n2nd Course - Barbecue Prawns served \\"heads on\\" which showed how righteously fresh they were provided a messy challenge to peal that was more than rewarded with the incredible flavor.  The prawns were served in a small bowl with jalape√±o-corn pur√©e and two pieces of toasted French bread (thankfully) because all four of us scrapped the bowls sparklingly free of the tasty pur√©e!  If I had to pick a favorite course it was this one, or maybe the 3rd! :-)\\n3rd Course - Scallops & Pork Belly. Two huge fresh scallops with two matched-sized pork belly squares.  The plate was finished artistically and tastefully (both senses of the word) with smoked maple polenta and apple butter, all topped with crispy potato strings.  The most inventive pairing here was a pickled strawberry half on each pork belly cube - this should be required for all pork belly served in the future!\\n4th Course - Brownie Sundae.  A fudge rich chocolate brownie topped with a small fried homemade banana ice cream scoop, coconut creme and sugary cornflake clusters with peanuts.  Any one of those parts would have been great but together - words fail me!!Waitstaff\\nEven in friendly Austin, the friendliest I've experienced.  Very helpful and timely with water and wine pours as well as hand wipes and fresh cloth napkins required after the shrimp peeling.  Also, a personal hang up of mine, when we thanked any of the servers they all responded appropriately with, \\"my pleasure,\\" or \\"you're welcome!\\" instead of the ubiquitous response of \\"no problem,\\" which drives me crazy.

The people watching was fantastic, of course, and I was amazed by the large group of people getting down on the dance floor.As she mentioned, the pizza is good... no frills good but I have no problem eating off a paper plate. It's nice and crispy with just the right amount of cheese and really hits the spot after a few brews. Speaking of the brews, again, no frills here. As self-professed beer geeks there was nothing here we were too excited about but I was happy grabbing a seasonal Sam Adams brew (Rebel IPA on this trip) and then for purposes of nostalgia (read: college), enjoying a Miller Lite.Bottom line, it was a good time and I was impressed by the cleanliness of the place and the friendliness of the staff.

There were no other customers, but somehow the guy at the cart still managed to forget that he had two sandwiches to make. My friend had to go remind him. Possibly this is due to the fact that\\n--A very small child was taking orders. She was adorable, but also literally 4 or 5 years old. Not sure I'm so comfortable with that...\\n--When we finally got the sandwiches, they consisted of a few veggies that hadn't really been pickled, no jalapenos despite the fact that we were specifically asked if we wanted jalapenos, and what appeared to be RAW TOFU. Like, just cut off the block into slabs and slapped onto bread. For the benefit of people who don't know how to prepare tofu, the answer is, \\"Not like that!!\\" And the thing is, while I'm obviously all for carts and restaurants offering vegan options, you need to either know how to do it right, or not do it at all. Half-assedly slapping raw tofu into a piece of bread is NOT making a vegan sandwich.So...$4 for an absolutely revolting sandwich, but it did fuel the ride back to my apartment. And $4.

I think both are a little overhyped and there's not a lot of payoff. Often with both, they're the only choice you have-I don't consider Coors/Bud/Miller genuine beers. I was pleasantly surprised with this place though-both the place and the beer. My friend also happened to be flying out so we went and got lunch in the terminal and Sweetwater sounded better than the other options. After reading the reviews about the awful service I braced myself for the worst. I was pleasantly surprised to see that our server was friendly, came to check on us frequently and did I say friendly? Because he really was. Likewise, their winter brew, the Festive-ale, was a nice surprise. I don't like the 420 as an IPA, and I don't like IPAs in general. The festive, was a nice malty dark ale with a lasting finish. This beer made me change my mind about IPAs just being nothing but bitterness. I got a steak sandwich which was just okay-I mean, it's an airport restaurant so it's not going to win any awards but it was a decent one with a lot of upcharges for bacon and onions but it's okay-it's an airport, after all. I would stay away from the orzo salad, my friend was starving but maybe took 5 bites out of it. The dressing they put on it is cloying and it ruined the dish and her appetite for it.

The moment I stepped in and was greeted by the owner I felt a connection that went beyond customer and proprietor. This was a \\"welcome to my home, please stay a while\\" kind of feeling.  The owner is a persian man with a smile of gold and gleaming eyes. He loves to talk about his culture and food. He will turn you on to his turkish delights, which I had avoided up until that point because of condescending words like \\"soapy\\" and \\"awful tasting\\". I don't know what these people were trying, but it sure wasn't the delectable rose and lemon flavors I was savoring! No matter if it's a quick buy or a long sampling affair he always gives a genuine smile that says \\"I look forward to your next visit\\", and I return with a smile that says \\"I will be back sooner than later\\".I always buy from the great deli counter selection. Their baba ganouj is the best I have tried in the city with just the right kick of smoky and mint aromas. Their persian olive, walnut, and pomegranate tapenade is such a unique combination of contrasting flavors that work all too well. The tabouleh salad, dolmades, falafels, feta, halvah, etc. There are so many amazing treats to try that this already too long review would become unbearable.This is the kind of store I had been looking so long for. The kind of store that shouts \\"this is MY neighbourhood!\\" because you know you have found a most unique place that does not exist elsewhere in the city.

The fried okra was on point and will probably be a regular item I order there. I've also tried the hush puppies there (unimpressive and kind of dry) and the biscuits ( good biscuit but has nothing on the biscuit at island creek oyster bar down the street).Then came the main course. The brisket, pulled pork, and pulled chicken were all moist and delicious. But the real star for me were the ribs. The ribs have just enough fat and are perfectly smokey. The sides were pretty good as well. The Mac and cheese is good: it's creamy with a crunchy crumb topping. We also tried the collard greens and cole slaw which were decent..So the down side- I'm not a fan of their sauces and I'm big on sauces.

Unfortunately, after two tries I have to say Frank's is not very good. I've had better steak from a regular bar like Tavern in the Square. The last time I went I ordered the ribeye. I know a little about cuts of meat and stuff like that, so I get the relationship between a ribeye and prime rib. What seemed to happen when I ordered the ribeye was that they sliced it off of already coooked prime rib, put it on the grill to get a few marks on it, and there ya' go. What this meant was that I got a ribeye that lacked resemblance to anything that I like about this cut. I love prime rib, but only when I order prime rib. When I want a ribeye, I want a ribeye. Also, the meat didn't seem to be particularly good quality and was absolutely flavorless to boot. All in all, I've done better on my own with a steak from Whole Foods.

Inside a dark, modern Japanese casual restaurant with touch of traditional decor, a booth in one corner, tables lining a long wall, and a narrow L-shaped counter edging the kitchen area. The air is filled with tasty smells that put your senses on high alert. We started with the Agedashi Tofu - a tasty fried tofu in a shoyu sauce served with freshly grated ginger and green onion - a nice treat to begin with. Next, we moved to the house-made pork gyoza, perfectly soft and crispy at the same time, served with a sauce of rice vinegar and soy. Next another small plate: eringi to chingensai - stir fried bok choy with eringi mushrooms and thinly sliced pork - a perfect melding of flavors and textures in a soy-based sauce. Our main meal was a couple of different ramens: a shoyu ramen and their signature Kakuni ramen - both generous portions and enough for a full dinner plus some on their own.  The soups were completely different bases, but both very tasty. If you would like a table, perhaps call ahead to see if they are taking reservations.  The menu is full of small plates to explore and the perfect bowl of noodles that will warm up even the most rainy day.

We were very disappointed. Our waitress was rude and the service was horrible -- we waited a full hour just to receive an appetizer. Upon bringing out our appetizer an hour after being seated, our waitress informed us they were out of one of the menu items my boyfriend had ordered, so he had to order something different (which also meant they had not yet even began to cook our main dish). Sometime after that and before our main dish came out, our waitress approached us again and told us they were also out of the Creme Br√ªl√©e we both ordered, so upon another staff member's suggestion, we ordered a different dessert. After finishing dinner, that same staff member brought out two Creme Br√ªl√©es. We were confused, and before we had a chance to say anything, our waitress came out, whispered something to her coworker before stating aloud that we had received the wrong order. Instead of simply allowing us to have what we had originally ordered, she took one of the Creme Br√ªl√©es, of which we had not yet touched, to give to another table inside. If I had discovered that my food had been sitting at another table in front of, and possibly even touched by another customer before it had been brought to me, I would have been so disgusted. To top the night off, after finally receiving our check almost two and a half hours after being seated, we waited an additional thirty minutes for our waitress to return before we finally went inside the restaurant to find her and pay. We found her leaning on the bar, talking and joking around with the other servers, as if she had forgotten we were still outside. At this point the restaurant was empty; we were amongst the last of the parties dining that night.It is not in my nature to write in-depth, negative reviews for any type of business, but after this experience, I found it almost necessary.

This place is such a hit or miss. When they are good, we do enjoy the pizza and it arrives hot and the drivers are pleasant. But the last few times have been misses and I just can't waste time dealing with this every time we order pizza. We got our pizzas tonight, both burnt and way overcooked. We tried to eat 1 slice and it was like eating cardboard the crust was so chewy, overcooked and edges burnt. We got fries which was very small in quantity compared to what we used to get. Last time we called about this and they told us they were using another vendor for the fries so therefore, it wasn't what we are used to getting. They said it was temporary and they'd be going back to their old vendor. Well it's all BS because we got our fries tonight and it's still the same small quantity with barely anything in the box. Last time we ordered, the pizza toppings all slid off to one side of the box. It's like every time we order now, there is some issue. Tonight we were going to netflix and chill and I decided to order pizza since my husband had worked all week and I am home with a newborn baby. Instead, my husband is driving to the Papa Ginos right now to drop off the two burnt pizzas and then picking up the pizzas that hopefully are made right now by the manager. We paid for the food and a delivery charge of $2.50, tipped the driver, only to get crap pizza and go pick it up ourselves. What a waste of time!!! So much frustration for PIZZA!

I feel better about buying here because they use local, ethically sourced milk. It seems like the food case is always down to its last bits when I'm in, but I'm sure that has something to do with the fact that I tend to visit fairly late in the evening. Even then, if I'm looking for a snack there's always something appetizing. The savory scones never disappoint. The staff can be little impersonal, but never rude.

I have honestly never been crazy about it. Well, I went back after a few years away to see if I was missing something. We were lucky and got there right before the lines started forming. It only took a brief exchange with our waiter to realize he was in over his head. He ran off to tend to another table while we decided on our order. Ordering was bit frustrating and troublesome because it took him 3 tries for him to write down our order of latkes, matzoh ball soup and a corned beef and pastrami sandwich on un-toasted rye. I thought to myself that they must be short-staffed and brushed it off. But the worry turned to dread as soon as I saw the looks on my neighbors' faces. I was having brunch in the middle of one big clusterf**k.After a good 15 minutes, our soup arrived. Moon had no silverware and tried to flag down our server, but got up after five minutes to ask a waitress who handed him a teaspoon. As I was eating what has to be the blandest and saddest matzo ball soup I have had in a long time, I spied a food runner come out with our order, which our server nervously sent back. My heart sank. That food was officially on its way to reheatville and its homecoming was not going to be a joyous occasion. After clearing our soup bowls, the waiter brought out a plate of latkes that were burned around the edges and our sandwich, which was on toasted white bread--not rye. We sent it back because no self-respecting Jew and New Yorker would ever eat pastrami on white bread. The hockey pucks, I mean, latkes were dry and gummy, but we ate them to tide ourselves over and contemplated making a meal out of the promising cookies from the bakery case. Our sandwich finally arrived and it was not good, people. Stiff pieces of toasted rye resembling rice cakes and dry pastrami and corned beef that tasted more like salami. We attempted to salvage it with a lot of mustard, but it quickly became clear that it was beyond repair. We abandoned all hope, begrudgingly paid the $35 bill without the slightest glance at formerly tempting bakery case and fled to Buford Highway for guaranteed salvation."},{"name":"El Arroyo 5th Street","address":"1624 W 5th St","city":"Austin","stars":"2.5","text":"Hiked a while to get to this location under no ones fault but my own so was very thirsty when I got in.

The concept is tapas style, shared plates at Vino Venue.  We ordered brussels sprouts, spinach dip, and mushroom tartine (gluten free version).  Since the mushroom tartine would take extra time to prepare, the server brought out truffle popcorn to munch on while we waited.  The popcorn tasted like the truffle flavor that was added to it, yummy.  Unfortunately after that everything else was just average.  The spinach dip came in a cast iron tapa pan and after taking our individual portions, I noticed pool of liquid/water at the bottom of the pan, unappealing.  The brussels sprouts were sliced in the middle and filled with sliced apples.  The only thing we tasted in the sprouts was acid; I was surprised because our server said it was one of the best sides.

I hope people realize that the rolls they're usually used to having, are technically americanized rolls to begin with, making it not traditional.I love the nigiri, the traditional (! the ones where you can actually focus on the taste of the fish, not fried-ness and sauces) rolls, and the hand rolls.  I also love the Americanized rolls to pieces too though.A place with good americanized rolls, is a place that can offer roll innards that AREN'T JUST imitation krab, and shrimp tempura.  It's a big turn off to me, when a pricey sushi place touts itself, but all their rolls have the same insides as a california roll, or just shrimp tempura.  GRANTED, I'm deathly in love with the Chorishi's fire roll at Mikado, and I do know there is shrimp tempura in the roll, but what is sitting on top of the roll is what makes it unforgettable.So there is variety to what you're getting inside non-tradiTop Americanized rolls you can't leave without having:[Absolute #1]  South Sider, yes it's $15, and it's wrapped in rice paper, not even seaweed, but have it with yellowtail, and it's just the absolute best.[#4]  Evil Knevil.\\nIt must be the lemon zest and the other things on it, that make it just perfect.  For most of these things, I cannot describe the taste, I can just tell you that you have to try it at least once.[#4] Marylin Mon-roll or any of the Ozzy rolls.  \\nThe eel is always fabulous at musashino.  I don't know how to describe bad eel, but once you've tasted bad eel, it scars you.  I've had that at Maru and a couple of other places on non-weekend days.  But at musashino, you never have to worry about being scarred.[Quiet sleeper]  Rainbow Roll.\\nIt just melts in your mouth, and no matter where I have been, there is NO OTHER PLACE that has a rainbow roll as good as musashino.  Why?  The freshness of the fish, just doesn't match, otherwise, other places could have better rainbow rolls.  I mean, it's a pretty standard american sushi roll, isn't it?+ Asparagus Roll, nice and clean minus the fact that it is tempura asparagusIn my personal opinion, the flavors and freshness of the fish, is excellent.  I have no idea who or  what owns/runs the place, but I don't really care.  My former manager used to have excellent, excellent sushi in LA, and this place is her absolute favorite in Austin too.  I have another friend who has eaten here with me, but I could tell she didn't really like the place.  I have some other friends, who'd rather not spend the extra money to have the deliciousness offered here.  To each their own.  I know people who love this place (other than me), and I know people who don't HAVE to come back to this place.\\nI loveee their entrees, but I wish it wasn't so expensive for so little food for the entree.  It's more like a tapas portion.  (What?  I actually think something here is expensive?)I don't do drinks, I can't tell you anything about their drink list.Green tea ice cream, I love green tea ice cream with red bean!  I know exactly where it comes from, better than most places, but I can also buy the same exact brand at the MT marketplace on Lamar.  I kinda wish I didn't know exactly what the container looked like, to know that it's the exact thing I buy from the asian supermarket.  But I still love it.But while you're waiting to be seated, feel free to have the black and white roll from Chinatown, upstairs at the bar.

We left talking and tripping about the incident on the way home like 'how do you go into a place and lose skin off both of your elbows!???' Perplexed, but thinking it was just some type of unfortunate accident at the table, later Saturday night after work I was talking to my mother, who thought maybe it was the chemical they clean the table with that maybe too strong... its now early  Sunday, elbows hurting to the touch of Anything-shirtsleeves , you name it.. I now feel like I  should have ...asked management to look@ my elbows that night??? Really??? MAYBE... But at the time i was just plain perplexed and trying to figure it out myself.

Even with new additions, the things that Tony Roma's always did good will remain intact, including the always delicious Romarita's.Getting back to what made the brand famous, is of course ribs. So it was time to put some spin old favorites, like these all new Pastrami Pork Ribs that have been marinated for 48 hours in agave mustard glaze.One of my favorite new rib entries that I tasted, was the Crispy Pork Ribs that have been deep fried and and tossed in a fiery Buffalo sauce. Frying Ribs is certainly out of the box thinking, and these were pretty amazing.Along with some unique rib options on the Bones & Bites menu, guests will also find  items like the Bison Slider made with grass fed bison patties, American cheese, caramelized onions and sweet pickles. In the appetizer section of the menu is where you will find the all new Chicken Lollipops. These are Frenched wings with fiery Buffalo sauce and bleu cheese coleslaw that are as unique as they are tasty.If you need some roughage in your life, the entree salads have been redone too. This is the Chicken Caesar Salad which we really enjoyed. Other new salads include the Roasted Chicken Salad and a Kogi BBQ Steak & Noodle Salad.Of course the World Famous Baby Back Ribs are as good as they have ever been. After all, this is what put Tony Roma's on the map. Succulent, juicy and just fell right off the bone. Something new to the American market is the Tender Marinated Lamb Ribs. These ribs have been very popular at Tony Roma's in Malaysia. The lamb ribs are flame grilled in signature seasonings and finished with a savory reduction of honey and plum combined with fresh juice and hand cut ginger. I love lamb...in every form, and this lamb centric rib serving was just plain awesome.\\nFinishing out our evening we sampled two desserts. The first of which was the Crispy Brownie Bite Sundae with fried brownies topped with ice cream, caramel, fudge and strawberries. This dessert was chewy, sweet, crunchy and ridiculously good.

This seems obvious but I always come in during lunch and there are 10 people in the right line and 2 in the left line.  Second,  the first guy just wants to know what type of item you're getting (quesadilla, plate, burrito) so don't waste his time by running down your list of additions.  Once he knows what wrapper he's working with he will want to know meat type.  After meat you get transfered to guy #2 and then comes beans and rice, you have to be quick about it if you want refried beans or no rice...they start scooping right away.  But I would recommend refried over pinto for sure.  Then you can get into all the accoutrement.  Commonly overlooked ones include the cilantro mix and jalapenos.  Also, if you really like guac just get a side of it.  They don't really throw a ton on the burrito and it tastes better when you add it yourself.

And I was not disappointed at all. A wonderful blend of Cheddar, Asiago, and Roman cheeses tucked beneath a warm blanket of bread crumbs and packed with shreds of bacon mixed thoroughly in the macaroni - this entr√©e is not for the vegetarian. I ordered the variation with the prosciutto and truffle oil - and while mine is not yet a refined palette, I was very appreciative of our waiter who'd recommended those extra touches. The portion was just right as well, if you've had a late lunch and would also like to pack a bit to go. Our waiter noted how it would make a great left-overs-meal for the next day and was very much like pizza in the sense where it's great heated and even better cold. If I were to go back I'd tip larger, because I found it to be true the next day. (This made up for the fact that we had to ask for our bread basket.)Stephanie's recipes can actually be found on their website. While I don't plan on cooking anytime soon, this is a file I'd like to save for when I feel like picking it up some day:www.stephaniesonnewbury.com/recipes.pdfPatio SeatingLike many restaurants with patio seating, if you make reservations (I always opt for OpenTable - more opportunities for points!), they are only good for the indoor dining areas. On a perfect Bostonian evening (roughly 7:30PM) in early June, there is nothing better than sitting outside where it's bright without the direct sunlight. Stephanie's patio seating is particularly nice because the tables are comfortably spaced out and the width of it places the inner row of tables far enough from the sidewalk where people can't curiously stare at your meal as they walk by all-too-closely, but are close enough for you to get that outdoor-patio feel. (I'm particular about seating.) It's worth showing up and waiting for the first-come-first-serve patio because the indoor space is just a very different feel and a bit too dark (more of a place where I would go for a dinner in the Bostonian winter as a shelter from the snow)."},{"name":"Wine 4 Oysters","address":"1957 S Alafaya Trl","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Cute little place with amazing oysters and prices!

You'll think to order the smaller size, but order the larger size. Make it count.The ramen is great, but I think it's a better option to do Shabu-shabu with pork, the tonkatsu broth and a side of noodles. It's just as satisfying (if not more satisfying) than the ramen. Splurge on the prime rib- you won't regret it.

Definitely wasn't homemade but it was good nonetheless. We both got the regular Gyro Sandwich and it was awesome. The Pita bread was warm and soft, the kind where you just want to eat it by itself, that is until you take a bite of their oh so flavorful gyro meat, it was sliced just the right thickness, tender and moist and not shy about their serving size. Also I love the fact that it came with the feta cheese and they didn't charge extra for it. \\nDefinitely a great meal, also had some fries on that side that were thick cut and very tasty as well.

I had the chicken teriyaki pocket, the ladyfriend had what I believe was the Cape Cod wrap.  We split the sandwiches and both were pretty awesome.  Chicken Teriyaki wrap lived up to the billing, everything tasted fresh and was full of flavor.  The cranberry mayo on the Cape Cod wrap was excellent.  Both sandwiches were prepared well and didn't fall apart near the end.  You'd think that wasn't a big deal, but a lot of places can't get that right.  Someone in the kitchen gives a damn about the little details and that goes a long way.With our sandwiches we split a garden salad with balsamic dressing, which was way different than any balsamic I've had...in a great way.  The salad was big for a side salad and full of good mixed greens.  The ladyfriend got a side of baked beans with her sammich and I have to say, I could have gone there for those alone, this wasn't just a can of Bush's.  Highly recommended side for your sammich, if that's an option.The $2.50 PBR pounder did me just fine, didn't check out the rest of the menu.

Way too often I have made the mistake of going by myself to get a larger item and it can be hard to get the boxes off the shelf and into your cart without throwing out your back. Then I get to the parking lot and getting it into the car is a whole other challenge! PS Ikea is cheap cause there is NO ONE there to do your heavy lifting for you!You also get what you pay for, the materials are heavy cause they are all pretty much pressed wood chips with a laminate on them. Items scratch really easy which makes moving way more stressful then it already is cause all your Ikea wears WILL get damaged.As I get older I am trying to get away from Ikea a bit and into some real wood furniture that will last but if you need something in a pinch or your style changes every couple years Ikea is great!

If I am going to eat sushi in Austin, it is either here or Uchi (interestingly enough, Tyson Cole (owner of Uchi), used to work the sushi bar here). Tomo can be good but is too inconsistent to make my list any more. Anyway, Musashino has a more traditional Japanese style feel to it inside. They also have a full bar and a lounge area upstairs, which is a nice place to hang out while waiting for your table (they have TVs up there too). Once you are seated, you'll notice that every waitress is pretty cute and Asian - it has always been this way. Service level varies depending upon who you get, but generally ranges from acceptable to good. The sushi menu is much more traditional than Uchi, and is typical of what you'd see at most higher end sushi restaurants. They have very fresh fish and serve your normal nigiri pieces and sashimi as well as hand rolls, traditional rolls, and some speciality rolls. Pieces are priced per one and are on the higher end of the spectrum (think $3 and up for most pieces, much more for super fatty toro, etc). Rolls are generally $8-15 and are very good. My favorites are the Southsider, Texas Roadkill and the Spider roll, although the caterpillar and ozzy ii are also really good. They don't really have any fusion style dishes like Uchi, so if you are in the mood for that kind of stuff, I'd go there instead.  For traditional sushi though, this place is very good and typically doesn't have as long of a wait. As mentioned, full bar along with a good sake and beer selection. They have a Chinese restaurant upstairs and if you have friends who don't like sushi or are just getting into it, this is a good place to take them as they can order cooked items from upstairs and get started with easy eating sushi like Ebi or Unagi."},{"name":"Los Amigos Taqueria","address":"1743 Centre St","city":"West Roxbury","stars":"3.5","text":"I was pretty disappointed since the reviews were so good.

I'm not really mentally prepared to write any sort of a review, but I swore that I would be better at doing this when I've had a very pleasant experience and I've been woefully remiss. So - ready or not...\\nThis was my first time at Lure. It's Cinco de Mayo so why not show up at a seafood restaurant? I had wanted to try it - not really a regular fish/seafood person but I was interested in the attempt at sustainability, and that's where my group wanted to go (9 of us - some very picky eaters in the bunch also). Our table was on the patio - which made for a very pleasant evening. Spring nights like this are largely what keeps me in the south! Our server was Colleen - she was wonderful and handled our group with aplomb. She was very accommodating with requests and the occasional small substitution, and had some great recommendations both with food and wine. \\nI agree with other posters - pretty decent wine/beer selection and some interesting cocktails if that's your thing. I went rogue from the rest of the table and did my own thing food-wise - didn't really participate in the shared plates and ordered a random mix of things that looked interesting from different sections of the menu. Main dishes are priced at $18-$30 and there were some delicious looking options (even for the 3 in our group who don't eat fish at all). \\nWe started with a few orders of bread and a smoked fish platter, moved to a smoked salmon spread and calamari (I don't eat cephalopods but the rest of the table seemed to enjoy it). I was pretty obsessed with the applewood-smoked Rainbow Trout pate with creme fraiche & dijon that was part of the smoked fish platter. My meal (remember weird combination of menu items): seared smoked scallop with lime crema and shaved artichoke ($7), herb & lettuces salad with candied ginger, pumpkin seeds and lime vinaigrette ($8), New England-style clam chowder ($9) and grilled Vidalia spring onion with romesco and hazelnuts ($5). What I loved: the trout pate, the smoked scallop, the salad. I could have eaten those three items all day long. Really, really nice - and perfect for the outdoor, nice spring night with happy go lucky friends vibe we were in. The chowder was nice, lighter than most with nice thick cut bacon pieces. The Vidalia onion was fine - but I would have sworn it was steamed and not grilled - I was thinking it would have a little char on some of the edges (which I like). My biggest complaint - there was some heavy-handed salt action on some things that were not really expected or necessary, and then some dishes that really could have used a sprinkle were oddly lacking in seasoning. The pan-fried sole fillets were very well received although I didn't get a chance to try them. The grilled hanger steak was gorgeous and made me rethink my order for a second - but I got to try a piece and while the temperature was right up my alley (med-rare) it was one of the items that could have used a dash of salt. For dessert I got the Earl Grey & chocolate pot de creme with toasted marshmallow & walnut-toffee tuile ($5) - the \\"shot glass\\" sizing was the perfect size considering the richness. Other dessert orders were milkshakes, blueberry crumb cake and key lime trifle. \\nAll in all a very nice evening with really solid food. I would definitely go back.

They were also talking very loudly during this time so my gf and I had trouble holding a conversation.Some things I would recommend: teach all employees about hygiene and if a light goes out don't attempt to rewire it while customers are trying to enjoy a meal. It would have been completely fine leaving that one fixture off for the rest of the night, it would have still be plenty bright.Food deserves 4 stars, service deserves .5, hence the 2 stars.

I had the 2-slice-pepperoni lunch special, with soft drink.  Which, on the surface, looked to be very fairly priced at $4.99 + tax.The pizza was soggy and dripping with grease.  The crust had no rigidity, so I had to use both hands to support the slice as I was eating.  The cheese and pepperoni toppings were not well-adhered to the crust.  What I mean by this, is when I take a bite from a slice of pizza, I hate it when all the toppings slide off, leaving you with a piece of crust in one hand, and a gooey mess of toppings hanging from your mouth.  I prefer pizza with a crust that is rigid enough to hold in one hand, and does not fall apart when you eat it.  Due to the grease and issues with the toppings, I needed enough napkins when eating this pizza to kill a tree.Okay, it's pizza, it's going to be a little messy.  I could overlook the above if the taste itself was exceptional; but I found the flavor to be very ordinary.  Not bad, but nothing to make it stand out from say Sam's Club. Oh, and my soft drink had two dead bugs (ants or gnats, I couldn't tell) in it.   Or rather, I saw two bugs remaining after I drank it.

We started with the world famous biscuit.  Basically,  it's just a really big biscuit that didn't really have any other redeeming qualities. The honey butter that it came with was enjoyed. It should probably be marketed as \\"World famous honey butter with a huge biscuit. \\" Besides that I had a brisket sandwich and mac&cheese. The Texas toast that was sandwich was on was very buttery but otherwise flavorless. The mac&cheese was fine. No complaints there. The brisket was surprisingly dry considering how many fatty pieces I had. I don't mind fat on brisket as thats usually some of the best parts, but there was way too much. The non fat pieces were pretty dry with little flavor.  Overall, little I was a little disappointed. While nothing was completely bad, there was a lot to be desired.

This place disappointed me because-- it was just plain disappointing.Pluses: DRY valet parking...in their garage. Thank goodness cuz it was pelting. Atmosphere...though loud, it's an attractive space.Minuses: Strange service. The wife and I were with another couple, we didn't want to be rushed, and Heather sure was great with that. On the other hand, she was a little M.I.A. Neither us or the other couple are flag-men, but we could have used one to get her attention.Food? Well, I want to be blown away when I go to a fairly expensive restaurant like Watershed and I wasn't. I chose the soup of the day which was a scallop and tomato bisque. There were 3 or 4 small pieces of scallop and they had a fishy flavor, not the kind you want either. The soup base was fine, nothing special.The wives had the veggie plates for dinner. My wife thought the eggplant was great, the cornbread with pimento, too. The rest? Boring. I had the redfish with crab imperial. It indeed had decent-sized chunks of crabmeat but the whole thing was very bland. I think I enjoyed the asparagus it was served over more than the fish.After a two-hour workout earlier in the day to be ready for great dessert, I opted for the hot milk cake. Blah. I thought it might actually be warm but-- disappointed again. Though a great *looking* dish, it is basically a piece of yellow cake the size of a stick of butter, with a caramel sauce on top. I tasted 3 or 4 pieces of sea salt somewhere in there. The sauce was \\"okay,\\" what's not to like about a sugary sauce...but it was far from a wow-thing...and the cake was boring and dry. My wife had the very good chocolate cake in a jar. I would say it was more like firm mouse, VERY rich, and probably a better bet if you're a chocoholic which I am not.$300 including for two couples, with a glass of wine each, is not over-the-top compared to, say, the Second Mortgage section at Rathbun's. However, it IS pricey for a restaurant that really failed to deliver on the hype. As my wife and I drove away, I observed that I'm not sure Watershed knows what it wants to be. Is it a trendy chic-chic restaurant with some southern flair? Is it a trendy restaurant that wants to hold on to a little bit of it's predecessor's funky vibe? I think if they figure it out and put both feet in which ever they choose, they might get there.

We cooked the tarte Tatin however, it ended being more of an undercooked apple pie. The recipe for the tarte was in correct and totally jumbled.

I think that statement is sick on it's own. We asked to speak to the manager and when the manager came out she said it was in their policy(which she rudely pointed out) that the customer has to pay unless the restaurant makes the item wrong(the item was made horribly wrong). She said tuna tare is mashed up tuna, which is false from my experiences of eating it at restaurants. My friend said he knew another manager so if he could talk to her maybe they could resolve this and she rudely pointed out that she was Rusan's daughter and that it didn't matter if he knew the owner or not.

Unfortunately, they've lost all of their Austin charm due to overpricing and underserving and after a recent visit I felt like the joke was on me. Drinks are delicious and beautiful,  but pricey and underserving on the alcohol content. Service is incredibly slow, even if you are the only patron in the entire place. It's as though you're interrupting the wait staff's own personal party. Food is ok, but incredibly small portions for the price. The place was empty and the decor, while lovely, just can't create enough vibe on its own. Of note, Do512 listed an all night HH that turned out to be inaccurate/false advertising the night we went. Not sure who to blame that on, but again, felt the joke was on me. Justines and Native Hostel on East side do such a better job at giving you sexy atmosphere and hip yet -professional- service at a price point that feels appropriate for the experience. Ironically, the cocktails at those spots aren't quite as inventive but you leave feeling better about the experience on the whole. In turn those spots naturally have a buzz Bc everyone is charmed and lining up to share the experience. In a city of constantly opening new local spots and fantastic old favs, you simply can't survive as a pricey cocktail joint that isn't professional and committed to providing a great experience at its core. Unless they clean things up, spend your $14 on a cocktail at a joint in town that truly cares about its patrons. Management- would love to re-try the place if you could improve the cost - benefit ratio of the experience you're offering. Patrons lose out too much at present. Please ensure no false ads on all night HH please. Faster and more attentive professional service is expected with the price point you're asking. If you want to bring the vibe down to a casual local hipster hang out, bring the prices down and do larger portion food truck style food."},{"name":"101 Steak","address":"3621 Vinings Slope SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"This is one of my favorite steakhouses in Atlanta.

The only problem with Ru Sans is that there is an obvious lack of quality relative to the higher end sushi restaurants.

We had a guest in town for one night and decided to take her to McMenamins. We had 6 people in our party, we're greeted right away, got a table right away, our waitress was attentive, and our drinks always had refills (without asking). Great start to the evening. Then our food came (30 minute wait)....all 6 orders were cold (room temp) and the lamb in the gyro were so over cooked that you couldn't even bite through it. The waitress apologized and had the gyro remade but the rest of us were so hungry that we ate our dinners as-is.  Interesting how heat doesn't change the flavor but can definitely impact your enjoyment. I digress. The manager came over quickly to apologize and did the right thing by offering to reduce our bill (vs. offering a dessert or waiting for us to ask for compensation off our bill), However, he did try to make a lame excuse that a door was open in the kitchen and that was probably why our food was cold. Nice try but this isn't my first bad restaurant experience.A word of advice to all restaurants - don't lie or make up excuses to your customers. We are smarter and more savvy (well most of us are) than you think. With a smile and positive demeanor own up to the mistake, apologize, make it right and move on.

I did talk to a manager about it a few days later when I was walking by and explained that there are basic acoustic treatments used to quiet restaurants.

He starts ringing me up and I ask, \\"Bacon bun too?\\" Oh yeah...he returns with it. I ask casually if the plan is to keep the olive buns next to the bacon buns in the future (as it has been in the past). I tell him that the last time we got the buns, a cranberry walnut bun made it's way in. I told him if they can separate the nut buns from the non-nuts, that would be helpful, as my kid has a pretty bad nut allergy (we carry epinephrine pens and benedryl just in case). Right away he interrupts: \\"If you have a nut allergy, you shouldn't even be eating here. Everything is made on the same trays...You shouldn't even be eating stuff baked here...\\"Okay first of all, we've been eating here for years, thank you very much. I take precautions, check foods, etc. Your noob approach to assuming I don't know how things operate and are separated is pretty presumptuous...The last time my husband mentioned that an olive bun may have gotten in (he wasn't fishing for anything - honest!), the gal who helped him apologized profusely and offered us 3 buns to make up for the mistake earlier. She said they have tried to change the look of the buns and would try to ensure they kept things separate, etc., etc. Yay! Great customer service, not presuming I'm trying to send my kid into anaphylaxis or anything, being accommodating over and above what was needed. New guy could take a lesson from this gal.Second, I wasn't accusing *him* of putting said cranberry walnut bun in the bag. I didn't do due diligence in looking closely at the bun at the time - my bad (in my defense, cranberries look a lot like those bacon bits). Just was asking if this was a new policy for how they were arranging things on the old bread wall...if there are nuts in something, a separate bin would be much appreciated.Third, I presume the staff *washes the trays*. I'd like to think that if they are making a nut based something or other, they may run it through the dishwasher before they make a load of other stuff. If not, maybe it's something they should think about...The prices and lines were keeping me from being a regular anyway...."},{"name":"Lure","address":"1106 Crescent Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"The bf brought me here for dinner and it's a cute spot.

I like my wings a little crispy on the outside. I don't expect the wings to be perfect on delivery, that's impossible if you think about the cooking process and how steamy it gets in the container in route to delivery. I cant help but laugh at all the overly critical people that expect this, that, and the other from a pizza joint. I find that Sarpinos is better than Pizza hut, Dominos, and the Papa's. Please believe, im not an employee or the manager, Ive used this location for a year and a half if not more and readers are not required to agree with me but Id recommend it over other places nearby."},{"name":"Danketsu","address":"11425 Lake Underhill Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"I love this place.

I have two breakfast usuals from EB:  the spicy Elmo breakfast wrap (a whole wheat wrap with eggs, bacon, green chiles, and a spicy sauce) or the bagel with lox and cream cheese (I get the everything bagel toasted).  The breakfast wrap is very filling and holds me over for hours, which is good while traveling.  The bagel with lox and cream cheese come with onions and capers.  I order the lunch portion so I can get a side of potato salad.  Yes, potato salad may be weird at breakfast, but, whatever.Einstein Bros. is nice because it has some lower-calorie options like egg whites and bagel thins.  They have a decent coffee bar and you can get lattes and mochas and they typically have a seasonal flavor or two.Service tends to be pretty quick--you order at one end of the counter and pay at the other.  They have a deal that if they fail to give you a receipt, you get a free lunch.The one thing that EB has been slow to warm up to is having wifi in its cafes.  This may be a good decision, however, to decrease the \\"lingerers\\" that other bagel shops like Panera tend to attract--get the customers in and out.  I'd prefer the wifi, since I sometimes go to EB alone and it would be nice to surf the web while I eat.  I think more cafes are adding wifi.All in all, a solid breakfast choice with a number of menu offerings to suit whoever you are with.  Pair with one of their coffee selections and you're off to a good start for the day."},{"name":"AFURI ramen + dumpling","address":"50 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Ramen was incredible.

Buns should melt in your mouth, these tasted like day old bread.\\nWe will be back though, the ramen will just be our main focus. \\nTip: Ask for the homemade chilipaste. It took everything to the next level."},{"name":"Tasca Restaurant","address":"1612 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Brighton","stars":"4","text":"Pros: - Affordable and delicious food. We've only ordered a few dishes that we didn't like.  - $5 tapas nights (advertised in their e-mail newsletters) and for $10 bottle of wine or pitcher of sangria nights (Mondays- Thursdays). - Three kinds of sangria to choose from (red, white and pomegranate) and it serves 5-6 glasses for a pitcher, which is pretty good when it's on a $10 evening! - Cozy and quaint atmosphere, especially on Spanish guitar night. - Most servers are knowledgable and friendly. The servers/manager always promptly correct any mistakes and aren't quick to argue with you. - They have valet! It's usually only one person, but it's still pretty convenient considering finding parking in the area is almost impossible without a local permit. \\nCons:- Cramped space. We really hate when we're seated at one of the two-seater tables. There just isn't enough room for two people and multiple plates of tapas, especially if you're squeezed in next to another table. I often can barely back up my chair without bumping into someone.- The silverware never really appears to be clean (every time I go).- I've found bugs in my food a few times over the years. The worst was when our sangria was served to us TWICE with flies in it- yuck! The service was great, though, as we've always been brought a bug-free sangria or dish promptly and they always comp the dish or drink that had the bug in it. Just keep an eye-out just in case! ;)\\nDishes we love:- Patatas Bravas\\n- Sizzling Garlic Shrimp\\n- Fish Taco\\n- Petite Filet Mignon\\n- Roasted Duck Leg\\n- Escargots\\n- Calamari (the aioli is divine)\\n- Goat cheese empanadas (we always get this dish)\\n- Salted cod fritters (ask for a side of aioli, this can be too dry for some)\\nTips:- Sign up for the e-mail newsletters. They give you information on their $5 tapas nights, $10 sangria and bottle of wine nights and $10 off food for your birthday month. If you're lucky you'll be a \\"Lucky Draw\\" winner and get $10 off your food order during one month. We've won the \\"Lucky Draw\\" dozens of times, so it's not a rarity! There are also good deals for valet in the e-mails should you need to drive to get there (such as a coupon for free valet for the evening). - Make a reservation if you can, especially if it's a weekend night. This place can get pretty busy on the weekends and you can end up waiting for a long time. Wouldn't be a big problem if you enjoy waiting at the bar, but it's a small bar with about 6 seats so it's often unavailable."},{"name":"Toco Grill","address":"1658 Lavista Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Great food with nice customer service.  The place can get cramped when there's a rush of people making an order, but definitely worth it since there's an ability to personalize your pita.  I recommend the falafel pita and the grilled chicken pita.  One thing to watch out for is the chili paste they put in the pita....don't put too much otherwise your pita might be soaked by your tears while your mouth is on fire.  Food is definitely worth having especially for a weekend stop for lunch."},{"name":"Rogue Eastside Pub & Pilot Brewery","address":"928 SE 9th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Just a note to say that the summer small Brewery event continues - it has become a welcome event ~ and is small scale enough you can relax and chat with friend while you sample.  I'm so proud that the best beer last time I was at that fest bore the label Oregon Brew Crew - an Imperial Stout worth getting 2nds.I hope everyone is aware that Rogue now has their own Brewery Staff working there, operating equipment as The Buckman Brewery.

The Haven, tucked away on Perkins, may just be the antidote! They have an extensive list of Scottish beers and some signature cocktails. I tried the Fernet Bru, which was Fernet Branca, bitters, and the \\"other\\" national drink, a bubblegum-orange soda called Irn Bru.  It was definitely interesting!  The woman next to us got several glasses of the mulled wine, so I'm guessing that it was pretty delicious.We started with the bridies (puff pastry stuffed with squash and goat cheese), which were tasty, but not worth $8.  My husband got the Sassitch & Mash which he ate every last crumb of and raved about the entire time (he is not generally effusive with his praise).  I got the Fish Dinner--battered/fried fish, thick chips, and minted mushy peas.  The fish was incredibly fresh and flaky, the batter crisp, and the serving generous.  I am not a fan of thick-cut fries, but I used them to sop up as much of the homemade ketchup as possible.I was too full for dessert but the mars bar, mince pie, sticky date pudding, and scotch coffee are all on my list of things to try.

The tongue was alright and was crunchy and dark brown on the outside, but tasted a bit grassy. Maybe that's a good sign for freshness, but I'll have to eat more at varying locales to get a good idea of what really constitutes good tongue. The carne asada was pulled: nice and tender and with the sides: green salsa, radishes and lime, I liked this one quite and bit and will have to get a few of these or try it in torta form next time. As mentioned elsewhere the menu here is a good deal more limited, but when I was there I saw a couple of Mexican guys eating under the tent while a couple more came up to order some in Spanish. I'll have to head over to the truck across the street and see if there's a big enough of a difference to make me stick with one over the other.

I remember when it had first opened and it was fairly quiet but at this point, word is out and there was a short wait for a seat at the bar.Food first, we orderd the pan-fried pork dumplings which were nice and juicy with a thick wrapper. There were only two of us so we then shared the seafood fried noodle. It was really tasty with a good amount of seafood--prawns, white fish pieces and squid. I was a bit turned off when we could see the bottom of the plate and it was so very oily. I normally order the blade-sheered (thick) noodles in a soup and I think I'll stick with that.I know that I tolerate some poor service for good food sometimes but they really need to pull up their socks here. There were only three servers and they were flustered to the point of indifference. We were not acknowledged at all upon arriving and I would imagine this would become a huge problem if it were even busier. Our water was never refilled and our empty plate from the dumplings sat on the counter for over half an hour without being taken away even when the noodles arrived. In addition, the food took a really long time to prepare....there is one cook at the front making the dumplings and cooking the noodles. I believe there is another kitchen at the back for frying the noodle dishes and putting together the soups.The only thing that arrived promptly and without being requested was the bill! Even the simple noodle houses manage to seat their guests or get them on a list and the food comes quickly, even if service is not super friendly.I love XLBs and beef rolls but there are other places in town to get them.

They've got ~2 dozen beers on tap at a time, and you can get beers by the pint or by the tower (see pic)! The towers are a better deal, but they're mainly just amazing units of beer consumption. Good selection of pizza, burgers, and sandwiches. What stood out the most for us though was the nachos, which came in an enormous serving (see pic) and at a very reasonable price.

However, they are rosemary truffle fries, which I  found the rosemary a bit over powering. I would suggest to relax on the rosemary.  I like rosemary, but I'm not that into her. She is however gluten free for your gluten free nuts out there (Eat more gluten. I promise, it won't kill you. This does not apply to those who have genuine allergies. Only those nut bags that heard from some chick in yoga class that gluten is bad for you). I had the Braised Brisket grilled cheese. It was excellent. I typically don't go for toasted sandwiches as they have a tendency to tear up the roof of my mouth like a huge bowl of cap'n crunch does, however the bread wasn't toasted to that extreme. I paired it with a side of truffle fries and a concoction I made from the coke freestyle machine they have. Although I like those Coke machines, I hate them at the same time because people take forever to use them.

The menu is good and serves traditional international favorites: Shepherd's pie, bangers & mash, fish & chips, etc. I've had the fish and chips several times now and highly recommend it. They have sandwiches and burgers as well. I've had their black & bleu burger and loved it! They do serve typical bar-type appetizers as well (wings, nachos, etc.) The drink selection is great...several beers on tap, plus a full bar. They have flat screen TVs throughout the place. They have the NFL & MLB ticket packages, and I've been there several times to watch a game that wasn't nationally televised. This being a \\"international pub\\", they also always have on a soccer or rugby match as well. The staff does a good job of spreading out the games on all of the TVs. There's patio seating out front where they have pool tables as well. In the back is a fairly new beer garden and stage area where bands perform frequently. The entertainment inside is great!

We were seated quickly at a cite window seat, but became blocked in and overcrowded by the tables around us as it started to get busy. My Fiance's seat was positioned between the wall, the window, and the backs of 2 guests from another table. We were annoyed, but just rolled with it. When we left he had to ask the other guests to get up and move so he could get out. He was literally trapped! I was really excited for the Sangria, but it was terrible! It tastes like boxed wine with OJ added. NBD, I'll just stick with wine. The food was ok, a little bland, a little sad, and not really spanish, but it was warm and not terrible. The last two times I was there was enough to make me never want to go back and I won't. Once on a Friday and the other a Saturday.  Both times I had a reservation and still had to wait a long time. Once over an hour (close to an hour and a half), and the other about 40 minutes. WITH A RESERVATION. Walk ins were being seated before us per their policy \\"walk ins get seated after an hour of waiting.\\" What is the point of taking reservations?  We were told both times to have a drink at the bar whole we wait, but the whole upper dining area was crowded shoulder to shoulder. I felt terrible for the people eating there! It was super busy and really crowded. The amount of people they force into the bar area is probably illegal. I dont know how they're legally allowed to seat some of the tables they have or why anyone would agree to sit there. Many are boxed in and crowded by other tables. I was lucky enough to get a booth once. I tried to reserve one once but got annoyed that I had been waiting for 30 min and just took the next table which was a terrible idea. Both times the service was slow, food and drinks. Our food came out sporatically some dishes cold. The servers acted as if they wanted to get us out of there asap. I dont know why people like this place so much. The prices are fair but the service and food is dodgy,  the reservations and sangria are bull.Nope.

My fiance split a peanut butter brownie with his sister and they loved it. The raspberry lime rickey is also really good. The staff were pretty quick and friendly which was great. It's definitely busy which can be tough if you're looking for a seat. Also, I get that you bus your own table but the tables could still use a wipe down here and there.

But I've never been blown away, until last night. The quality at Sweet Cheeks is several notches higher than other well-established BBQ retreats such Blue Ribbon and Redbones.That said, you will find lovers and haters slopping BBQ sauce and pork grease all over their faces here, and I'm no different.So, how do I know I love this place? Three words: Berkshire Pork Ribs. They were part of my $26 Fat Cheeks tray and somewhat of red-headed step-child compared to the tray's companions -- pork belly and brisket. My first foray into the 14,000 foot peak of meat focused on the pork belly. Our server recommended that dish or the Pineland Farms Short Ribs. The belly was tender and juicy, easily carved by my simple table knife. However, I found it a bit bland and lacking the pallet-explosion elements of the other two meats. Would I recommend trying it? Absolutely. Would I sprint through crowds of women and small children to make sure my taste buds were satiated? Probably not. Thus, the first thought traversing my synapses was one of delight but not sheer stupefaction. The smoke ring was visually impressive.I next delved into the brisket. Absolutely an improvement over the belly and laced with the salty and smoky crust I had hoped for. It didn't melt easily in my mouth, but wasn't causing my molars to crack left and right either. Worth noting is the fact that the specific brisket cuts bordered on burnt ends; therefore, the aforementioned characteristics are absolutely expected. Mixed with a moderate helping of the restaurant's BBQ sauce, there were absolutely enjoyable. Recommendation worthy.Until this point, I had ignored the ribs. Ribs of any kind typically do not find themselves on my plate. Instead, many of the other pork variations are typically aligned at right angles on my plate. Not having thought of them up to that moment, I clamped down and easily pulled some meat off the bone.Wow. Enchanting. Covered in a rub formulated by BBQ gods and seasoned with exactly the right amount of salt, I couldn't get enough. They were by far the best component of the tray and the only thing I finished. Like a lunatic, I demanded that the server ensure the bones were kept in my carry-out box. But I don't have a dog. A small batch of stock will need to be created from their expertly crafted internals and external layering. Recommendation worthy? Hell yeah! In fact, I would strap a jet-pack on my back and fly over the crowd of women and small children to try just a single rib. The most telling fact is what I could conclude would happen during subsequent visits -- focusing exclusively on the ribs and ordering no other primary meats. Really.Of course, one must consume a beverage while partaking in BBQ debauchery. An Otter Creek Black IPA was my companion. Another reviewer commented on the lack of IPA choices and I echo that opinion. There aren't many. But if you like more whiskey variations than you can remember, you're in luck."},{"name":"Maher's Restaurant & Pub","address":"352 B Ave","city":"Lake Oswego","stars":"3.5","text":"Went to Maher's quite a bit this past winter and was happy with food and service.

The whole concept of a shop that serves the all american reinvented grill cheese sandwiches is genius. Btw, they got over stuff too. The store is full of fun filled cheesy goodness - textured wall that looks like cheese, cheese graters as lamp shades, and the you can miss wall of cheese 'chemistry'. (Hmm, how many times can i use the word cheese in this review???)This visit I had the pleasure of trying \\"As Gouda As it Gets\\", which is a sandwich prepared with spinach, pulled chicken, smoked gouda, and red peppers. It has a great crust - that distinct crunch and the gooey meltiness from the gouda. I was a little disappointed the pulled chicken wasn't seasoned enough and the smoked gouda wasn't strong like smoke gouda but a more milder version. None the less real tasty. The second sandwich was one of their specials. It was a pulled pork, cheddar, and MAC & CHEESE! Yes - pasta and everything! Surprisingly delicious. Every bite was effortless even with the pasta. Their BBQ sauce is different in that its a little tangy which is great with all the richness. Like I said earlier, they got other stuff too like salads and burgers but I didn't get a chance to try any of that. I'm not sure if I'll ever get there because the sandwiches are too damn good."},{"name":"Olive & June","address":"3411 Glenview Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"The food was amazing. We sat outside, it was beautiful. You sit under a massive tree feels like your in the middle of a resort not on a busy Austin street. It was lovely, they had enough fans for it not to be too hot but I can foresee in the middle of summer it getting a tad bit uncomfortable. The bruschetta which is an item that's on a million menus managed to be not only delicious but different from the rest. I had the Bronzini which was to die for, a bit spicy which I love I even ate the skin it was that good. I ordered a side of braised white beans which could have been eaten on their own as well as the kale. Just absolutely fantastic.\\nThe only downer was the service. We closed our bar tab to move to our table which was a booth, we realized it would be impossible for us a party of four to have an active conversation with one another because of the way the booth is set up. Because its a side rectangle the two people at the end of the booth are a bit far from each other and would be left out of the conversation or only be able to converse with the person just beside them you add the noise of an active restaurant and its impossible. So we decided to ask for a traditional table. The host/floor manager seemed surprised and annoyed that we didn't appreciate the table we were given and was not at all friendly about making the change for us. Was he rude? No. But definitely gave us the impression he was not happy with us. Felt like I was being reprimanded. However he made it happen and we were told it would take another twenty minutes for traditional table to open, we were happy to wait. So we returned to our originally bar table and ordered a bottle of wine for the wait. When we were again told our table was ready we asked that our bar tab be transferred to the table. Its one thing to pay out cocktails but another to pay out a bottle of wine. Nobody wants to have to pull out their credit card three times in one night. At this the waitress became annoyed and ran to get the bill to present it to us even though the hostess made it clear we wanted it transferred. It wasn't until we told her that we left her a couple of dollars on the table that she seemed satisfied to let us transfer our bill. Once seated the waitress asked us if we had any questions.. we did. How is the rabbit tagliatelle prepared, which was a special of the night, she was stumped. Instead of telling us to hold on and ask the chef she began to make up her own recipe. Said that it was baked then shredded and tossed in the pasta. I had to step in and let my friends know that was highly unlikely it was more likely braised in some sort of wine and veg then shredded to give the pasta some sauce. I then I asked her to confirm that with the chef and she did and I was right. My friend ordered the polenta which she said was amazing rich and creamy served with a perfectly runny egg but wasn't given a spoon to eat it with so half of it ended up on the table.None of these encounters on their own are too bad but when you add them up it was a bit much. We still had a great time but I think it did detract a bit from the overall experience."},{"name":"City Landing","address":"255 State St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Party of 9, we all ordered either the steak frites, NY strip or buffalo meatloaf.

My first impression was that their seating area is quite spacious for a fast food place. . .well, I suppose it needs to be large to handle the kind of crowds they got.  I know people love the chicken sandwiches there because of their good quality and the chicken is cooked fresh when it's ordered.  Anyway, NOW I realize that I should have ordered some type of regular sandwich on a bun instead of a wrap because the chicken on a sandwich would have been freshly cooked and hot.  I was (unwittingly) trying to limit my carbs and ordered the less \\"bulky\\" grilled chicken wrap.  I was disappointed that the chicken in my wrap was cold, so obviously it wasn't freshly grilled.

Almost 2 decades later, I stopped in for lunch.I settled on a Chili Dog combo ($5.15) with a sub of Onion rings for fries ($0.75 to sub) and a drink ($6.37 total)The chili dog was kinda small, and the chili just wasn't what I remembered it being back in the day.  It was just a strip of brown flavorless stuff on my dog.  I'd probably select something else if I go back.The Onion rings were pretty decent, sweet Vidalia, and generous in size and serving, without being overly greasy.  Not the best rings i've had, but these were the star of my lunch.If you're open to it, Zesto's has a daily lunch special with the following, that offers things like Chicken Filet baskets with fries/slaw, Gyro combo or Steak Burrito Grande with a drink, all for less than $6.   I didn't see a paper menu, but no worries, there's a big wall of photos that include prices and selections to choose from, so you wont be lost, and from order to walking out the door, it took about 5 minutes, so they're speedy.Parking is pretty easy, but good grief it's hard to get out of the lot, and it's probably smart to exit out the back (take a left) to get to the nearby light.Is Zesto's going to be your new lunch go to?

There's free parking right outside the place.Each order comes with a side. On our first visit, we got the Ssam burger with lotus chips and the Kimcheese burger with sweet potato fries. Since there was a Scoutmob deal for a free boba drink, we also got the green tea matcha boba and hibiscus black tea boba. My bf thought the green tea matcha boba drink was on the sweeter side, but both of us liked it a LOT more than the hibiscus b/c it was just too sour/bitter tasting. The boba itself was not bad either, we were kinda impressed with the green tea matcha boba drink at a non-milk tea primary making establishment.We both liked the Ssam burger more than the Kimcheese burger due to the ssam sauce. The bun itself is very enjoyable too. The lotus chips were also addictingly good, but we could not finish the sweet potato fries because it was too filling. There was a nice bathroom in the place to use. The lady who took our order, who also may be the owner, also came around to us to ask us about the food, but we forgot to use that opportunity to tell her about the sour hibiscus drink.On another visit, we got the Saigon, the Seoul, and the Kinnoko. We all liked the burger patty, but the stuffing  in the Kinnoko was too strong for one of our friends, and the spicy mayo in the Saigon became too burnfully painful for me to handle.

There are a couple of tables where you can sit and eat, but most of their business appears to be take-out. They do make their own bagels on-site, and they boil them (which, for the unaware, is the proper/authentic way to make bagels).They had about 10-15 different types of bagels, but mostly the classic flavors: egg, salt, garlic, sesame, etc. I had an everything bagel, toasted, with jalapeno cream cheese. The bagel was awesome- crunchy crust and chewy center. It didn't have that bread-like texture that grocery store bagels often have. The cream cheese was the real star here- instead of being jalapeno-flavored, it had actual slices of jalapenos in it. Great place to run in and grab a bagel.

A great concept so badly executed.Let me explain. We paid $250 for 2 appetizers, 4 main courses, 1 gl. red wine, 1 gin&tonic, and 1 dessert. I start with the price and continue with the description to illustrate the lack of relationship between price and quality.Food was ok -but on the average side. Nothing special. Only the desert was kind of memorable. Steaks were fine, appetizers boring, sides meh -besides french fries but how wrong can u go with fries?Ambience was great. Nice jazz music, quiet classy secret-ish spot, located at the back room of jm curley.Huge issue: Our server. Although he was a nice guy and I'm pretty sure he was doing his best, he had no clue about offering good service. He was hyperactive, running between jm curvey and bogie's, was speaking so loud it was really annoying given how quiet the place was, and last but not least he was refilling our glasses of water after -literally-  every sip of water. And he was doing that while rushing up and down between the two places. Also, he was refilling my mother's coke before she was even done drinking and without even asking. Finally, when he was not serving us, he was having loud discussions with some friends(?) at the tiny bar at the corner of the room about how expensive it is for him to get wasted (how classy!). You would expect the servers to fit the vibe of the place, but they weren't.Overall: This place suffers lack of identity. It's a classy place within a very casual restaurant/gastropub. In other words, a restaurant within a restaurant. This is a very well known and successful concept in new york. However, in new york 50% of the success of these places stands on the change in the vibe and service once you enter from one place to another. At  Bogie's, it's like you enter jm curley and they tell you \\"Hey dudes, you have another $100 or more to pay for dinner? Come at the back side to show you our expensive version!\\"Would go again?

I booked through an app and for most the event was prepay $75 per person including 3 courses and a glass of champagne. \\nCopious is located in the legal district of German Village just south of the courthouses on High. There is a marquee with the restaurant name. They have a bar off of the dining room and a jazz bar called Notes in the basement. There is also a second story for special occasions. \\nWe arrived on time and it was a full house. They had valet but we found a spot close to the entrance, the two men at the door were talking to eachother and therefore didn't open the door for us two ladies. With our reservation we were seated immediately. They had a jazz band playing which further accented the romantic atmosphere; hardwood  floors, dim modern lights, and highback booths.\\nAs I stated the had a prix fixe only menu so I can't speak for other items on the standard menu. I ordered the French onion soup, 10oz ribeye with potatoe gratin and creamed kale, ending with a cheese platter. My girlfriend had the French onion soup, salmon with orzo and asparagus, and Apple crumble with vanilla ice cream. \\nIt took a bit if time to get our orders mostly because the manager was called over due to me wanting to sub the creamed kale for asparagus, I just don't do alfredo sauces. When the food finally came it looked tasty...even the creamed kale. The manager pulled a miracle and included an order of asparagus (with the prix fixe subbing is not an option). The ribeye was huge and tender but too pink to be medium well. I ate the fully cooked parts and requested they fully cook the rest. Yes, I know medium well still has pink in it but only a hint of pink not raw meat. This was more like medium or medium rare in the middle. Once properly cooked it was perfect. The potatos gratin was layered like a lasagna with thinly sliced potatoes. My meal and my friend's meal were both very satisfying. It was clear we paid for the vibe as well. The meal was slightly overpriced as I would have expected to pay more like $60 per person at comparable establishments but remember this was a holiday and special event. \\nAfter our dining we went to Notes in the basement, to bring in the New Year with a dance party hosted by O-GEE. All in all we enjoyed yourselves, both food and venue. The ability to park once and have both dinner and a party in an upscale environment is rare in Columbus.

This location is still decent, but the other Orlando location has completely revamped their menu and it is AWFUL. That said, here's the details on my most recent visit to the International Drive locale.I was in Orlando for the weekend and as always I decided to hit Tony Roma's. Got the usual Baby Back Ribs with the Blue Ridge Smokey Sauce and for the first time in all the times I have been there, the Ribs were tough. They were Dry and not nearly as meaty as they used to be. Even the Blue Ridge Smokey Sauce did not taste the way it used to...almost as if it was \\"cut\\" with something else.The service was still decent and overall it was still edible, but this place used to be fantastic. I will give it another shot the next time I'm in town this May, but this place has slipped quite a bit over the past two years. I'm getting kinda worried that Tony Roma's is going down the tubes as brand...especially in light of the changes made at the other location in Orlando over on Semoran."},{"name":"Musashino Sushi Dokoro","address":"2905 San Gabriel St, Ste 200","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I am not a roll person, I am a nagiri girl bb~\\nIf you love nagiri like I do, you will love Musashino.The sushi bar is cramped but it is hypnotic to watch their gaggle of chefs go at fish with such artistic hands. What I tried:\\nNama Sake - svelte. If this sushi was a woman, she would be the classy kind who melts at your touch but leaves you begging for more. Inexpensive - 2.50\\nSake Tatake - spice is a bit too strong for my palate and left my mouth stinging but the fish was still just right\\nUnagi - I was actually disappointed in what is usually my favourite after Sake. But you cannot win them all.\\nKama Toro - the most expensive item on the menu. One piece is 20$. Let me tell you, it is worth every cent and more. Huge, amazing, and literally breath taking. My eyes watered up from its full flavour and felt near overwhelmed with its freshness. Generous portions, the pieces are almost the size of your palm.\\nFast sushi bar service.\\nNext to zero waitress service.\\nNo wait for one to sit at the sushi bar at 6pm on a Friday.Their bathroom has only one stall that locks and closes properly.There were a few screaming babies, this is seriously not a place for kids, leave them at home.Dimly lit and very beautiful.

It is $5 cheaper at lunch than at dinner, and over my dead body would I pay $19 for half a rack of ribs that were reportedly not very large.In literally five minutes, not the promised 15, my order was ready.   But, there appeared to be only one side dish container so I asked where the other one was.  They forgot to include it... and it took them at least 10 more minutes to package a single order of farm salad. Glad I asked where the other side dish was, or it would not have been until I got home that I realized there was a problem.  Everyone can goof, but for a dish that always is served with two sides, someone just wasn't paying attention.  The hosts were most apologetic for the mixup, however.While waiting for the salad to be delivered, I wandered over to peek into the kitchen. I happened to land at a spot where there was a large apparatus with boiling water and what looked like clear cryovac sealed bags of sliced beef brisket being heated. Don't know if that is what it really was, but it made me wonder if the brisket was really made on premises or brought in.  Or maybe it was premade there, packaged, and then heated?I am a fan of SMOKED ribs where you see the pink smoke ring in the meat.  Too many places either don't smoke their ribs at all (Redbones) or don't smoke them enough (Larry's House of Q).  Tiffany smoked her ribs nice and pink, and the meat was fall off the bone tender.  The latter quality is not necessarily good, because I prefer to have to work at the ribs a little bit to get the meat off (the way Soulfire serves theirs).Unsauced, the ribs were nearly tasteless. And as others have said, you had to wonder if they were dry-rubbed at all.  Three containers of  unmarked sauce were included in my takeout bag.  The one I thought that was the hot sauce tasted very much of cayenne pepper, and I didn't like it.  Then I tried an orangy colored  sauce, and IT was the HOT one.  Wow.  Not for me.  Then there was another orangy sauce, almost translucent, like duck sauce, and I have no idea what it was supposed to be.  It was not particularly vinegary.  Unfortunately, like all the other sauces served at the aforementioned restaurants, my old standby KC Masterpiece (or Bulls Eye) beats them all.The ribs with KC Masterpiece were fine.  Each one was about 5\\" long, much less meat and smaller than Soulfire.  Soulfire easily provides twice the meat for $14.99.The farm salad was a variety of vegetables that mostly I could not identify, and unlike other commenters who said it was \\"to die for\\", mine was okay, if not a little soggy.  It needed maybe some more vinegar, but it was okay.The collard greens was the standout dish.  While I have only had Soulfire's greens which are very good (and tasted Larry's, which were not), Tiffany outdid herself on this.  Just very very flavorful,and a large portion..  The pickle slices and onions were a bit odd in that they were not marinated together (onion not at all), so unlike the really tasty nibble that almost everyone does well, this were not.  And the whitebread is useless.  The restaurant should donate it to a homeless shelter where it might be appreciated more.Bottomline: I'd tell a friend to try Sweet Cheeks Q at lunch to save money, but it would not likely become their go-to place for barbeque."},{"name":"Rogue Eastside Pub & Pilot Brewery","address":"928 SE 9th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Last night a group of my friends and I decided to meet up here. What a horrible choice. We arrived and found a table towards the back and got a couple beers from the bar. We knew we were going to want food but had not been approached by anyone that worked there. I proceeded back up to the bar where a waitress was passing by. I asked her if we could get some menus, she said she would need to find someone to get them for us. Next the bartender comes with menus. A couple minutes later we order and I let him know we are going to have more people arriving shortly. 30 minutes later our appetizers arrive with our entrees. Not a big deal. I ordered the mac and cheese along with a cup of chowder and wings to share. The only thing I ate were wings. The mac and cheese tasted like it hadn't been seasoned with salt or anything else for that matter. Pene pasta drowned in a tasteless cheese sauce. The chowder was no better, it tasted strongly of lemon. I honestly don't think I've ever been somewhere that could possibly mess up chowder.  My friend got the Kobe burger and a salad, never asked what kind of dressing for his salad so when I asked for a side of ranch I was promptly told it would be 50¬¢. When our friends arrive it was like the bartender/waiter went awol. A couple of friends went to the bar to get beers. I went and grabbed a couple of menus for them. When the bartender finally got to our table my friends ordered drinks. He comes back with them and informs us that one of the taps ran out and gave my friend a half glass of beer for free. They order their food and we all continue to socialize. We got there at 7 and would be heading to another engagement at 9. 8:30 rolls around and my friends still have no food. Finally the bartender comes and says that somehow their food tickets had been \\"lost\\" and that their next round was on the house and he would put their orders in right away. 8:45 rolls around and we finally just tell him to cancel everything. It's a Friday night, why wouldn't you staff your bar?  I honestly am not sure why I paid my $51 tab for food as I left the majority of what I ordered there as it wasn't edible. Staff your bar, sample your food, and learn how not to lose people's orders!

This, unfortunately, was another lesson learned where \\"you can't believe everything you read in the papers.\\"Its a great specialty cheese shop, but the restaurant and cafe is in desperate need of an overhaul if they intend to stay in business. The atmosphere was good! A converted house with wood floors and built in bookshelves for the wine and the showcase for the cheese in the far end of the dining room were great features. That is as far as the good qualities get in this establishment. I ordered a coffee which was my first mistake. Even though there was a unique process in making a single cup I was astonished to get my cup of jo ten minutes later! No grinding beans, no operating a special espresso machine just pouring hot water through a filter, and it took ten minutes with no line! Not to mention if I wanted more than my ONE cup of regular coffee I would be charged another $3 or so for another cup!!! So its a good thing the water was self serve.I will say that the food was good, but nothing that would make me come back every weekend to check out the new menu. I had the croque madame.Service....HA!!!! Yeah there was none of that. I agree with a comment made in an earlier review \\"it left us feeling really awkward\\". The logistics of the whole experience made me so confused that we had to flag down the waitress delivering coffee's and ask her how it worked. Then we flagged down what appeared to be the owner as his attitude was snippy with in explaining why our food was taking twenty minutes in the kitchen. We believe he failed to put the order in period, as it came out within five minutes after. Its a ham sandwich with an egg on top, and a french name. Regardless it was as if the wait staff was afraid to approach tables as they would pass by drop off food and walk away without a word. As far as the children in the establishment, there were plenty. If you want this food and to be treated by an arrogant staff, you will have to put up with the kiddos. In a matter of a few months the only patrons of this place will be the dwellers of the neighborhood.

We were always looking for a good place to grab lunch -- quality food, good service, and price that matches the quality and service.  In times past, we would go to lunch in the Back Bay and then meander our way down to the aquarium area.Well, look no farther.  I found City Landing on Yelp and after going back and forth with Hubs about lunch, we finally said, \\"Okay, let's give it a try.  Why not?\\"During the summer, the outside seating area is great because it is rather shady and stays cool and the people-watching is fantastic.  Yes, it gets a little loud because of the traffic around the area, but overall, it is pleasant.So, on to the food.  I had the chicken sandwich with bacon, avocado, lettuce, swiss cheese, and their basil mayo.  The mayo was a little much and made the sandwich just a little too hard to eat, so next time I will be sure to leave that on the side.  Plus, instead of fries, it came with a huge bed of greens tossed in a lemon-y vinaigrette.  It was certainly filling for lunch, if not, a little too filling!  Hubs had the fish and chips and even commented that in all his 30+ years of living in the Boston area, it was the best fish and chips he's ever had.  The fish was flash fried in a buttermilk tempura which had great flavor and didn't flake apart when eating.  At the end of the meal, we were both completely stuffed and in need of a serious nap.  With tax and (+20%) tip, our meal was $50 which is a little pricy for lunch, but the quality of the food matched the price.  Our server, Michael, was totally awesome and was patient with us as we decided whether or not we wanted to order a few apps to share for lunch or lunch entrees.  So now this is our go-to spot in the area for when we are entertaining our guests from out of town.  As members at the Aquarium, we go there not only for basic admission, but to attend special events and we can't wait to go back to City Landing.

Since it's supposed to be a German restaurant, it's especially bad that the wurst was absolutely flavorless. I enjoyed the German potato salad and the sauerkraut, but the ambience and the service left me with no desire to give this place a second chance.We went very early on a Friday to catch the restaurant before it got crowded for happy hour. There seemed to be more servers than there were patrons at the time we got there, but our server was not at all welcoming and ignored us as much as possible without refusing to come by the table at all. The noise level was also atrocious-especially considering how empty the restaurant was. It felt as if the Architect made every effort to amplify the noise instead of to control it so that you could enjoy a conversation with your table mate. Not for me. If I want noisy German food, I'll brave  Schmidt's - at least the servers are friendly and the food is tasty."},{"name":"Agora Sports Bar & Grill","address":"84 East Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"2","text":"This place has potential, but they need to get it together.

They had some football game on cranked up so loud it was almost impossible to carry on a conversation. The service was so so, the kid was obviously trying but was either brand spanking new, or getting screwed over by the kitchen. Probably both. Water glasses were empty the whole time, and considering we were the only ones there, soggy fries and a gyro plate shouldn't take 90 minutes. Food itself was actually okay. Like I said, soggy fries, and when you order a feta plate, you get just that. No hummus, no varieties of feta, not even pita bread. Just a slab of cheese on a plate with a tomato and a few cucumber slices. The gyro sandwich itself was actually pretty good. Nothing out of this world, but definitely yummy.

A couple of people I had yet to meet were in town visiting and had heard about the Sinferno Cabaret on Sunday nights, so I decided to trek down and see what all the fuss was about. First off, the band playing prior to the Cabaret was absolutely terrible. My ears bled just having to suffer through it. I tried to drink as fast as I could to make the screeching banchees sound even remotely tolerable, but it just wasn't working for me. Then, as for the Cabaret itself. Unimpressed to the fullest possible definition of the word. The two girls standing on stage between acts reminded me of a Motley Crue video. Each song they would gyrate in the same rhythm and take off one article of clothing.  The acts themselves? Meh. Half-arsed and nothing too grand. I've seen better fire performances in friends back yards. May all sound a little snobby, but really, it wasn't all that cheap to get in and after all the rave reviews I heard about it I expected more. Especially somewhere that has half naked gals. I mean, that right there you'd expect a good time.The beer was pretty cheap and the pizza was gigantic for such a cheap price. Albeit I've had better pizza at a gas station at 3am.

I got the newbury and my mom got the pear martini. They were fine, nothing impressive. We ended up getting a second round after the meal and I think my second one was pretty much all limoncello.  We were brought to a table and waited for someone to come by. And waited and waited and waited. Finally a manager was walking around and by the expression on our faces figured out that no one had come over in quite a while and had a waitress came over. The second she tried to help us our waiter magically appeared to finally greet us. He was rude the entire rest of the night to us, as if we'd gotten him in trouble with the manager, no matter how friendly we were (and we were. Yes we were originally annoyed to wait 20 minutes for our waiter to even bring water/greet us, but we got over it immediately and there was no need for him to be rude). \\n \\n All of that said- the people who say the mac & cheese is mediocre are lying because of the bad service.

First time I was here was with one other friend and we sat at the bar and grabbed a few small plates and some drinks, it was a quick in an out. Second time I was with a group of 18 and we had a preset menu made just for us and it was a long leisurely evening. Two things were consistent on each visit, the great food and the bad service. Each dish I've had here has a lot of obvious thought behind it and always delicious. The presentation is beautiful, the ingredients are unique and the flavor is bold. Some dishes are better than others and I wouldn't say the whole menu is spot on, but it's a solid choice for a great culinary experience...especially one that is a little more  upscale on Rainey. The service however is the only thing that kept me from giving this 5 stars. Sitting at the bar the first time around the bartender wasn't very engaging, had little knowledge of the food and wine and just seemed to care very little about us being there. Luckily his shift was ending and another bartender took over who was amazing! I wish I had remembered his name.  The large group dinner was a disaster in terms of service. We had one waitress for the entire group of 18 which is just poor planning. So drinks were slow to come out to say the least, yet the food came out almost too quickly. It was a coursed meal and we barely had time to dig into one coarse before the other one was on the table. Overall, I would absolutely come back here in hopes that their service kinks get figured out as the restaurant gets comfortable.

I went with my sons on a weeknight- and there was a party on one side so seating was really limited. We sat outside. The waitstaff is truly hardworking and very pleasant. Now for the outstanding stuff. On this visit we had the black eyed pea dip with addition of three falafel balls. Really tasty dip- and the pickled okra was just the best thing ever. Tons of veggies on the plate to dip as well as some really nice soft warm pita. The falafel didn't taste traditional- more cumin and garbanzo heavy than I'm used to- but it was really fresh and very very good. The boys both got burgers- which looked wonderful- they loved them- and my older son who usually orders sweet potato fries and doesn't eat them slammed down almost the whole order. I had a very nicely grilled chicken sandwich and the most incredible green beans on the side. Better than fries.

He set the phone down and asked me if I was eating there or ordering food to go.  I stated that I would go ahead and eat there.  He seated me in the back (which I didn't understand because the place was pretty empty) and asked me what I wanted to drink.  I replied, \\"Water is fine.\\"  He told me I could go ahead and help myself to the buffet.I got a plate and got some Sesame Chicken (even though there were no sesames), a little fried rice (no flavor), a little lo mein (no flavor), a chicken wing (excellent), and a chicken on a stick (excellent).  After picking at my food, I looked around wondering when I would get my water.  I was extremely thirsty and was thinking to myself, \\"The poor service might be why this place is empty.\\"  After a while, I saw an older woman refilling drinks.  She looked over in my direction and asked, \\"You don't want a drink?\\"  Hmmmmmm, I didn't see a place where I was supposed to pick one up on my own.  I was a little confused on her comment and replied, \\"Yes, I asked the young man who seated me for a water.\\"  She apologized and said she would bring me one.  As soon as I received my glass of water I guzzled it down because I was THIRSTY!  After I had my water, I decided that I would try out the soup.  They were in the wrong place, because I know what Hot and Sour Soup looks like, but it was labeled Egg Drop Soup.  Other than that, I grabbed another one of those chicken on a stick things because I really like the flavor of the chicken.The soup tasted like pepper and I didn't care for it.  I ate my chicken on a stick and looked around not knowing how a person checks out of here, so I walked up to the front and told the young lady that I had one buffet with water.  She told me the price (it was something like $7.35).  I handed her a $10.  She handed me two $1 bills and some change.  I walked back to the table I had been sitting at and left a dollar and the change and kept my other dollar so I could get a candy bar from the vending machine at the job.Walked out to my car, got in, and started it.  Then I looked in my rear view mirror and saw the older woman coming around, so I thought maybe I left something in the restaurant.  I rolled down my window and she said, \\"You forgot to pay.\\"I said, \\"I paid the girl at the front desk.\\"She shook her head no and stated, \\"No, you didn't.\\"I was appalled that I was being accused of \\"stealing a buffet.\\"  I rolled my window up, turned off my car, and at this point was extremely pissed off.  I told her, \\"Let's go inside so we can get this straight.  I can't believe I sat there with no water until my meal was damn near over, had crappy service and food, but out of courtesy left a tip and you are accusing me of not paying?\\"We went in and the young man was still on the phone.  I asked him where the young lady was that was just at the register and she comes from the area I was seated at.  I asked her in a loud voice, \\"Did I pay you for my meal?\\"  She replied, \\"Yes.\\"  I looked at the woman in disgust and left.  As I was leaving, she stated she was sorry.  Sorry?  Did that make the ordeal that I just went through better?  HELL NO!  I can understand why this place isn't packed and I've been telling everyone what happened to me.

To begin with, it's a quaint little house, utilizing all rooms for dining.  The uneven floors and small rooms only add charm and helps block the noise level.  All four of us ordered from the $25 menu - which was packed full of choices.  I ordered the beet salad with goat cheese infused with chives (yum, yum, yum!) , the mussels were good and my creme brulee, perfect.  What makes me rate the restaurant 3 stars and not 4 is the service. While our server was attentive, she often interrupted conversation to get our orders, rather than waiting for a pause -- and let's face it, it wasn't terribly busy, we were the only people in our section!  She practically thew our silverware on the table and often reached across me to place something on the table without saying, \\"Pardon my reach\\".  She also wasn't terribly friendly or helpful with our selections when we asked what she recommended.  Parking is valet only.  Bar is fair. The bartender played double duty also as a  hostess - so had to be reminded of the specifics of our drinks.  Food - 4 stars; Service - 3 stars.

Our waitress (the same as the other two tables) didn't even take our drink order until after she'd taken orders from both tables, and brought food out to one of them.It then took an HOUR AND TEN MINUTES to get three bagel sandwiches, an omelet, and a single pancake with two scrambled eggs (I think three of us had hash browns as well). During the hour and ten minute wait, our waitress filled beverages once. Just once.When the food came out, all of it was cold, except one of the sandwiches. I assume the kitchen messed that sandwich up, and instead of just bringing us our food while it was hot, and explaining the issue, she left it on a windowsill or perhaps in a fridge. Then she tried to take my still full soda from my hand to refill it. I waited tables at a breakfast joint in my younger years, and really do understand the challenges presented by a Sunday rush, but this lady was inexcusable. For the first time in my life (and hopefully the last) I wanted to leave zero tip.

Instead, the menu has fewer carefully selected options.  You can select from either a poke bowl or a sushi burrito  Protein selection is either tuna or salmon and there's only one choice for protein amount.  Same with sauces - there's either an \\"appa\\" sauce or a \\"umma\\" sauce, where \\"appa\\" is spicy and \\"umma\\" is savory.  If you don't care for a bowl or burrito, you can order regular rolls or hand rolls.  Roll options include vegetable, California, avocado with tuna, salmon, or eel, spicy tuna, spicy salmon, spicy yellowtail, and shrimp tempura.  For the most part, the special rolls are essentially California rolls or spicy rolls with more fresh fish on top.What I Tried:\\nSalmon Poke Bowl with Appa Sauce ($13) - One of the advantages I've found with restaurant-designed poke bowls is that the ingredients tend to go together better.  The salmon bowl came with sauce, cucumbers, romaine lettuce, avocado, a small scoop of seaweed salad, cabbage, roasted seaweed, masago (fish eggs), and tempura flakes.  There was a nice pleasant crunchiness that came from the cabbage and the tempura flakes.  I really liked the Appa Sauce - it has a nice punch of spice that is more prominent compared to the spicy mayo at other restaurants.   Salmon is decent - I like the salmon at other places a little better but it's definitely not bad.  Another minor critique is that the rice is so sticky a lot of it sticks to the bottom of the plate, but this doesn't have a huge impact on the dish as a whole.  There's a decent amount of food in the bowl, but not as much as you get at some other restaurants at lower price points.  In a $13 bowl here, you'll get 1-2 scoops of protein. Verdict: Appa's poke bowl is a solid 4 stars for me.  I like how the menu is simple.  The ingredients go together well, although I do like the protein quality and quantity more at other places that also happen to be a little cheaper.  It's cool that you can also order hand rolls here.  If you appreciate good texture in a poke bowl and a sauce with a respectable level of spice, however, I'd recommend you check Appa's out."},{"name":"Sinju Japanese Restaurant","address":"7339 SW Bridgeport Rd","city":"Tigard","stars":"3","text":"First visit we ordered some of the specialty sushi rolls.

The drinks (and I sampled quite a few) were all delicious and fresh and fruity (and in some cases, on fire) everything you want a tiki drink to be. Our bartender was friendly and gave us some special perks when he found out we were celebrating a birthday, and the atmosphere was fun and warm and perfectly tiki! It was worth waiting out in the cold for (and I don't say that lightly because I hate waiting almost as much as I hate being cold).Finally, the food I tried was great- I had poke which was super fresh and delicious and had all kinds of goodies mixed in: pomegranate seeds, herbs, spices, maybe flowers??

Stop.\\n Go.\\n Wait.\\n Stare...Stare some more... \\nCheck out......Oh; it's green-Sometimes it seems like the drop into a new life season is a leaning in; over the cliff's edge of a nine-month waterslide. Submitting the weight of endeavor, to the building momentum of a new career or relationship or belief change. Submitting to new synergies... Evolving.I hadn't been in a coffee shop, other than Starbucks, in years. I'm talking about a \\"Stauf's-type\\" of place. A local hub for hipsters, CEOs, grad students and starving aspirations; taking form in baristas, memorizing the drink of some and suffering the patronage of others.The worn rubber corners on their tires, worn thin from special instructions, teetered, beneath the surface of quivering epidermis twitches; eyelid spasms, releasing pent-up aggression, still hidden; and everyone would acting like it wasn't happening.  This isn't Starbucks.Laughter, life and relationships blossom in the background, as gentleman banter, keyboard jazz notes jiggle and students break out of the typical academic competition to absorb more of the culture promised to parents paying.Wandering couples stroll out on the sidewalk, window-shopping the various vignettes, each vicariously set up inside the window.  College work-study groups hover over their encroaching laptops attempting to fit onto tiny tables. Girlfriends \\"coffee\\" together.  Singles focus, peaking up at attractive passers-by.  My coffee cup slowly empties as my pen transfers intrigue onto paper.  An old friend journals in the corner.  We don't notice each other in the hum of it all until the end.My head down to paper, Red tennis shoes pass through my peripheral vision.  I crunch into a hot toasted garlic bagel, schmeared with melting cream cheese.The bouncing red visual movement invades a cold November 23rd trance that keeps warming minute by minute.  Everyone is definitely appreciating this unordinarily warm day as we transition from a frigid & ice-laden atmosphere of only 12¬∞ hours ago into a sultry 61¬∞ outside here at noon. Inside the coffee shop, a thick 95¬∞ cloud is forming from steams released by each froth and every espresso's majestic creation. Milk palettes swirl upon dark canvasses of coffee, stretching into forms at the touch of each artist; his pull; her twist. Some to go, some to stay, but each cup, drawn to perfection, without a complaint, meets it's eager fingers, waiting to be warmed. It's addictive if your love language is touch.The ambience is completely quaint and strangely calming as 100's become caffeinated within the intensity of the dense brain trust that Stauf's creates a clearing for, allows, catalyzes and contains. A Harley rolls by; red light now green in front of me.

The lamb shank was very tender, but the sauce was a little too tomato-ey for me - personal preference, nothing against the food.

There's a section that they mix your choice of fish with some toppings (I got the OG soy sauce, jalape√±os, edamame, corn, cucumbers) From there, you can choose from an array of toppings. My bowl toppings included pineapple-mango salsa, seaweed salad (MY FAV), pickled veg, picked daikon, and pickled ginger. You can choose from different cream sauces to top it off. I tried the wasabi cream, spicy mayo, and jamaican cream & they were all REALLY good. Everything was so so fresh & so much yum.I also tried their pineapple/orange mixed dole whip and it was everything I dreamed of and more! No more having to go to Disney when you get the cravings hehe. The staff were very friendly & calm, cool, and collected on their opening day.

Many patrons were still in the bar at this time, thus I don't understand why I couldn't take my final sip in peace. When I expressed this to the waitress she took the beer and then proceeded to yell at me from across the room (what she said was unintelligible).

One little restaurant stand, one very impressive BIG chicken wrap.  That was amazing.  I came in today wandering around the food court, unsure what I wanted.  Wasn't really feeling food court grease but was getting hungry and impatient.  Made my way back here after I passed the first time, trying the sample of chicken that the uber-friendly sample guy was distributing.  On my return, he asked me where I was from and then insisted I try the chicken wrap.  Freshly made pita bread, lots of chicken, fresh veggies and amazing sauce, he said, it would be the best $4.99 I spent while in ATL.  In skeptic disbelief, I took on the challenge and ordered a chicken wrap, not really knowing what I was getting myself into.  As the guy behind the counter began to prepare my wrap, I slowly realized that I had ordered a mammoth.  It was seriously about the size of a Chipotle burrito.  I took it back to my office, pleased that I'd only spent $4.99 + tax on this wrap.  It could've probably lasted the normal appetite two meals.  I got through 3/4 and wanted to stop, but I forced myself to finish the rest of it.  AMAZING.  I don't know if it's the best $5 I'll spend in Atlanta, but I was impressed.  It was the perfect blend of moist grilled chicken (they weren't stingy on the meat as I'd predicted), veggies, salad, lettuce, tomatoes, and honey-mustardy-mediterranean-influenced-ranchy sauce wrapped in a giant fresh pita bread.  I probably didn't need to eat dinner today.  In fact, after I finished the mammoth, I continued to burp for about five minutes afterward as my stomach was trying to figure out what just happened.  I know, TMI, but seriously... foodie heaven.Other things:\\n- Unsure what people are talking about with this free cookie.

Seating inside is also very limited, I think that this needs to be addressed.So orders started to get called..guess what, no one knew whose order was being called.  Luckily there were only 3 ahead of me, so mine was the 4th..  The bread is shipped from Philly, and the meat was very moist and tender.After the crowd subsided and all orders were filled, the owner/manager came out and spoke to the guests and apologized for the delay, and said this was the first time they had a \\"rush\\".  He also was receptive to my feedback and said that next time he would have lettuce and tomatoes. I will definitely be back, and hope he has fixed some of the items in the review.#Yelp100"},{"name":"Diesel Cafe","address":"257 Elm St","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"Coffee is okay, but overpriced.

(You see what I am saying?) Contrary to what it seems that people are wanting in a coffee shop, I love the fact that this place has a pool table. It opens up the options of a casual afternoon hangout spot where I am not asleep by 7pm after an afternoon beer. You have to pay for the wifi here, which I think is kind of clever. While pricey, this definitely serves as a great method for crowd control. If you want to get out of your house to be productive, the last thing you want is to roll into a coffee shop where all the tables are taken and 90% of the people are online shopping or surfing social media. While I have been that person before, I do like the feeling of getting out of my apartment to get some work done as well, from time to time, and Diesel Cafe is a conducive environment. While the music may be a little loud, at least you can get some work done as well and not have to climb over 100s of people to do so. There are accessible outlets for your laptop (a good sign when you charge for using internet). (This is not to say it doesn't get crowded, which it does, they just have many seating options available and people are gracious and have made room at the communal table for me!). I took off one star for the food. I got the oatmeal, which, while the portion was enough to feed me for 3 days, was stick to your ribs thick and had no memorable additions other than a hard lump of brown sugar on top. I think you can pay for dried fruit, but I would prefer a toned down portion with more sides. The drinks are delicious, coffee is good and not too strong, and their soy London Fog perked me up and was not too sweet.

One of the owners/managers saw us doing this and immediately told us to have a seat, because he was going to take care of us - and he certainly did! He kept a running mental list of the wines we tried and took the time to explain each wine to us whenever he brought over a new one. I'm not a fan of reds, but there were several on the list that I really liked and even considered purchasing by the bottle.

First the good. The service was excellent, very friendly and easy going. But the food was only so so. I took my vendor to this place after reading all the reviews but they must have had an off day today. The drinks were very good also.The length of time the food came out from the time of ordering was very good also. We didn't have to wait too long but just long enough where we were happy to see them bring out the food.The oysters were also good with good variety.Next the bad. First the shrimp cocktail was not cleaning properly. There was still some guts on it so it was sort of grainy and slightly bitter. I'm OK with eating shrimp guts but definitely at this price point it should be cleaned properly. We had the clam chowder which had lots of good ingredients, but was a little bit watered down and not thick and I didn't get any clams at all. Tasted like clam juice and bacon soup. It was not that bad but just watery. It is a chowder not a soup. Next was the pan fried sole. The flavor was good with proper seasoning, but dry. Not extremely dry but dry none the less. I think they over cooked it while trying to make the breading crisp. The crust was crisp, but so was the fish. :( Then came the chicken. Once again dry. Good flavor, but dry. I understand the focus on crispy skin, but you can sacrifice the meat for the skin. At this price point I'm kinda disappointed. I can get moist chicken for much less than this. Summary:\\n- good setting\\n- great service\\n- great drinks\\n- good flavor\\n- shrimp could be cleaner\\n- but dry food ( come on guys you can't cook fish this much, you guys run a $$$ restaurant.

I'm assuming because we edited our meal with the no vegetables. Later I heard her say, she's never seen me go in with my husband again this was in Thai. I know she's recognizes me. Then I over heard another waitress complained about another customer of him smelling like cigarettes of course in their language. No one likes the smell of cigarettes.

I understand that it is common for restaurants to do this, however when you reach a certain price point it's reasonable to expect you'll receive a freshly made meal. My husband did say he was happy with the taste of the lasagna, so had it been warm he probably would have loved it.

We had the Pork, the Chicken and Dumplings, the Iceberg Salad and the \\"Very Good Chocolate Cake.\\" Some cocktails and wine. The pork was not very tender and IMO could have been cafeteria food. The Chicken & Dumplings is soupy -- with small shreds of chicken dominated and outnumbered by humungous, heavy dumplings in an average-tasting broth. Very much enjoyed the Iceberg Salad -- it's a good portion, cheesy, and an enjoyable start to the meal. The \\"Very Good Chocolate Cake\\" was not very good -- cold, cheap-tasting, and I wonder if it was even fresh. I did enjoy my cocktail and I think the Wine List is strong. Great options for by the glass. Service was a little bit stiff and unwelcoming. Getting the waiter's attention for ordering wine and dessert was more of a task than it should ever be for the Watershed price tag. You should try Watershed one time to experience it for yourself.

We decided to go out to dinner for my friend's 31st birthday and celebrate at Haiku.  We were seated and the server came over and put the waters down and asked if we would like anything else to drink.  Several in our party were fine with water, but one in our group said he would like to order a cocktail.  The server walked away without taking the order.  It was not very busy inside where we were sitting, so it wasn't like he could not be heard.  We were the only table on that side of the restaurant.  When the server returned, I ordered a spring roll and several others in the group did as well, along with some edemame.  The edemame came and all the spring rolls but the one I ordered.  After waiting for the server to return to check on us, I reminded him of the spring roll that I ordered as well.  He seemed annoyed at my reminder and said nothing and walked away.  The people who ordered drinks finally got them after, no less than, 30 minutes.  I had ordered a salad and two rolls for my dinner.  The salad came, but the rolls never came.  Everyone else at the table got their rolls.  Towards the end of dinner (he never came back to check onus or bring us water) my boyfriend told him to forget the rolls I never got because I did not want to wait any longer.  I asked him to just take them off of the bill.  When our checks came the rolls that were never received were still on the check.  My boyfriend went to the host desk to ask for the manager and the server was standing there.  He proceeded to argue with my boyfriend that I got my rolls and there were on one of the plates.  I am a vegetarian and the rolls that I ordered were most definitely NOT on any plate on our table.  The server had a rude, apathetic attitude from the moment we sat down.  I have not had worse service at a restaurant.  Arguing with a customer?  COME ON!  The server NEVER apologized once for any of his mistakes.  Waiting 30 minutes for drink, having to ask for my spring roll, never getting my sushi rolls, arguing with the customers?

It was really unfortunate because I had invited a group of people out to celebrate a friend's birthday.  The waitress told us they could not make sushi for a member of our group because they had a food allergy-avocado.  According to her the chefs use the same knife for everything and could not wash it off between rolls.  So what happens when they drop a knife on the floor we asked?  Do they not wash it then- I wonder?  In addition our waitress said they did not serve cocktails when 2 minutes later a table got several martinis delivered front and center.  She forgot our orders of hot tea and avoided any hint of etiquette, like telling us her name or even smiling.  After addressing our concern about the worst service we had all experienced in quite awhile, they credited a couple rounds of drinks and a free birthday desert for our friend to the house.  That made up a little-or it could have been the multiple rounds of Saki from that point on.  I have really loved the sushi and service in the past.  I truly feel the food is of the best in Austin.

I had a flashback to my unforgettable butternut squash ravioli at Giacomo's last month, and I had made my choice......except when it was time to order, I was told by our server that it wasn't available anymore. This shouldn't happen! I don't blame them so much for being out of a popular item, but she should've let us know before I set my heart on it, right? One of those \\"100 rules for restaurateurs\\" touches on that, doesn't it? (I won't start with that list...)Anyway, we decided to go with the ahi tuna salad and the fish & chips. The ahi tuna was quality, and the dressing had a great balance of sweetness wasabi spiciness.
