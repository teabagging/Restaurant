Then she says \\"well this is my section so I would really prefer it if you order from me\\". Ok...fair enough I guess...I have had jobs as a server so I understand, but I still think it's dumb and ruins the chillness of standing at the bar having a drink (especially when she seemed slightly annoyed that she would have to split the checks that many ways..that was the whole point of us ordering from a bartender duh).

Not worth the money!  The nutella milkshake was a poor chocolate milkshake with nuts on the bottom and roasted mini-marshmallows on top.  I could've made that milkshake for so much less at home.  As for the pistachio milkshake I guess you might like it if you like pistachios.  I'm not a huge pistachio fan.  The pistachio shake came out with liquid nitrogen on top that you mix into the shake.  Be careful when you mix the liquid nitrogen into the shake because it will jump out and burn you, or at least that's what happened to me.  :)  Again, I didn't think it was worth the money.

Since there was no signage, I drove right pass the restaurant and had to turn back to find it. \\n\\nI ordered Pollo Adobo with the gnocchi. At first bite, the gnocchi tasted oily, but after a couple bites, the flavor of the mushroom shined through. The chicken was well seasoned, but on the dry side. My friend ordered the night's special, ribs in pineapple sauce. It was a huge disappointment. The ribs was not marinated long enough so the meat was not flavored. My other friend ordered the lamb dish and that was the best dish of all the entrees. \\n\\nThe arepas was quite a bit of disappointment. I ordered the pork arepas and the pork was good, but the corn pocket was difficult to bite in. I do not understand why the waitress would recommend that as an appetizer to share if I was unable to cut the arepas with a steak knife. However, the arepas' dipping sauce is amazing. It was extremely flavorful with a hint of spiciness. \\n\\nFor dessert, we had the molten chocolate cake and it was a delight. The dessert is small, but it is made with very rich chocolate. 7 people sharing that one dessert was enough for all of us. \\n\\nThe biggest failure of the restaurant was its deep fried dishes. My friend ordered the fried plantains and the plantains were extremely raw and the fried coat was a bit on the overcooked side. The fried potatoes that accompanied the ribs entree was undercooked and the potatoes were not cooked through enough. \\n\\nThe restaurant is decently priced and has redeeming qualities, but I don't think I will want to go back again."},{"name":"Wilfs Restaurant & Bar","address":"800 NW 6th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Amazing!

My friend's car was vandalized in the parking lot while we had dinner. My work bag with my computer, iPad and other items were stolen in what is known as a \\"smash and grab.\\" From what I learned from the police officer and others is that thieves make their way up and down this road robbing  establishments and vandalizing cars. Although there is a camera in the lot, the police officer who responded to the call said the camera is useless. Making the situation worse was learning from the person who had pulled up in the parking space near our car (after the burglary) that he reported the broken car window to management, yet no one notified the restaurant patrons to find out whose car was broken into. The thief had at least a hour to flee with the computer and iPad and steal information from it before I could lock my computer via iCloud. The response from the manager a few days later was indifference when I report that no one announced or went to each table to inquire about the car damage and likely theft. His response, \\"we wouldn't announce this, but we would go table to table.\\" That didn't happen. No responsibility from management either. My advice to those considering this restaurant- READ BACK through the reviews and you'll find other customers who have had similar situations (car breakins). Sounds like Flip Burger needs to hire a parking guard or institute valet parking. Customers should expect more from management, especially since as a visitor to Atlanta I've learned from law enforcement that Howell Mill is a high crime area."},{"name":"Parish Cafe and Bar","address":"361 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Stopped in with a colleague at lunch time and wow, this place was slammed.

Maybe my expectations were a bit high but I was still very  pleased.  Did I think it was as good as Estragon in Boston?  No.  Why the rating difference on Yelp?  I blame location and expectations.  \\n\\nPinxto Pincho has very good tapas but the portions are TINY.  Most plates are made for 2 people and only give each person a couple of bites.  While menu items look cheap, it's because you will order at least 8 dishes to be content.  If you're in a group of 4 you would probably have to order 2 of a lot of the smaller dishes which is kind of a bummer.  \\n\\nThe food is very good and seems authentic.  We loved the spanish omelet recommend by the staff.  We ended up ordering a 2nd slice.  Made fresh there that day and kept at the bar.  Reheated slighlty before serving. Shrimp in Garlic oil (6 small shrimp) was tasty and we used the oil for bread dipping.  The spanish ham was another standout full of flavor. I agree with other yelpers that the kale and leek croquettes are very good.  Skip dessert, it was just OK.\\n\\nThere were a couple of things that made Pinxto special.  They do true to Spain pinxtos where with each drink you order you are served a complimentary pinxto plate with your drink (3$ with no drink).   This included the seafood ceviche which was really good. Also, the service was great.  The staff offered us recommendations, made a little conversation, and asked about almost every dish we ordered.

I had the lamb burger medium rare with fries.  It was served perfectly and the condiments that went with it were really tasty.\\n\\nHowever, I'll probably not visit again.  Not because the food wasn't good, but for me personally when I cheat and want a burger I want a big, greasy Angus beef burger that weighs a pound and is covered in cheese, grilled onions, bacon, mushrooms and blue cheese.  The burgers at FLIP are really fun and interesting, but they're more \\"foo-foo\\" burgers (if that's a legitimate description).  They're relatively small and nicely decorated and pretty...but afterwards I was still hungry.\\n\\nI also tried both the toasted marshmellow/nutella and krispy kreme milkshakes.  One word: Meh...  It was a chocolate milkshake with some tiny marshmellows that were toasted with a blowtorch before serving.  The other was a vanilla milkshake that had some pieces of krispy kreme donut blended in it.  They were good, but nothing to scream about.\\n\\nNonetheless, I think it's a great date place that serves up a new twist on an old favorite and worth a visit."},{"name":"Render Coffee","address":"563 Columbus Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"I wished I lived closer to Render.

Granted I'm sure the phone orders were overwhelming, and there were people coming in and out the whole time I was there, that still is extremely unacceptable for anyone to witness/deal with. At one point I even noticed other customers sitting down noticing how loudly the person was yelling. I even heard him at one point say 'I'm the boss I know what the **** I'm talking about'\\n\\nThis made me want to wrap up the rest of my sub and go home. I also felt bad for the staff which seemed to be doing just what they needed to do! \\n\\nOn the other hand, each and every other person that I've spoken with has also agreed that the food here is great, which I also agree with. I'll still recommend this place, but I just hope they got their yelling over and done with TONIGHT so no one else has to be that uncomfortable."},{"name":"Cherrywood Coffeehouse","address":"1400 E 38th 1/2 St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"The place looks nice inside.

Coming from central New Jersey, where I have access to dozens of Indian restaurants and have dined at many, I have to think hard about a local place which would equal the Clay Pit in delectable offerings, all served in a lovely renovated space of an old house/store.\\nI had a very generous serving of lamb biryani, accompanied by excellent raita, chutneys and naan on my first visit during a week-long business trip in early April, 2016. It was so good that I returned a second time, where I sampled their weekday lunch buffet, which offered a variety of chicken and vegetable entrees and fresh salad items. It was uniformly well-prepared, unusual for most such buffets.\\nThe one and only downside of my visits was the service on my second visit - the server, a young Indian fellow, was quite obsequious (embarrassingly so) to patrons at the tables surrounding me (I was the first person to be seated in the dining room) but was indifferent to rude when taking my order, with zero provocation from me. When I received my check after the meal, I found he overcharged me. When I made an inquiry he challenged my assertion, only to be found HE was wrong and had to make the correction, but with no apologies.

This burger was good... it was not great. It is far from the greatest burger place ever. The patties are small, but almost all of the burgers are doubles, so there is plenty of meat. A couple of slices of melted American cheese and a couple of strips of bacon combine for a good burger overall. It's a plain and simple burger. The type you can could make in your backyard on the grill or order from Wendy's ( I couldn't help but notice an uncanny resemblance between Shorty's burgers and the bacon jr. cheeseburger on Wendy's dollar menu).\\n\\nThe fries are the thin cut shoe string style.

The Summer Shack is close to the T so it's easy access. My coworkers and I head here after we have a meeting at our regional offices that gets out at 5 PM and we need to cool our heels before fighting traffic.\\n\\nThe good: Lots of offerings. The menu is huge. 80% of the offerings are classic New England Style deep fried food. Which is done well but not as well as other places. This time I ordered the fish tacos. The fish was cooked to perfection, on a bed of cole slaw and topped with a chipolte ranch dressing and wrapped in a flour tortilla. The tomatoes that topped this were fresh and tasty. There was simply too much of the chipolte sauce. I had to remove my fish and scrape the sauce off so I could taste the fish and the rest of the ingredients. \\n\\nMy beers were served ice cold and they had a decent selection on tap, including Harpoon's Leviathan! Additionally they had a decent amount of bottled beer. My coworker's  burger arrived perfectly well done and huge. I mean massive, she couldn't finish it. \\n\\nNow normally my coworker's and I head to the sports bar and I wanted their gravy, cheese and bacon smothered fries. These are normally only available at happy hour and in the bar. The waiter gave us a little bit of a hard time but the kitchen said they would make them. These were worth the argument. Fresh cut fries, melted cheddar, brown gravy and bacon. OH MY GOD GOOD. Heart attack on a plate, my doctor would not approve. And that with a beer is what makes them so damn tasty.\\n\\nThe bad: Everything is fried, it's slightly overpriced and the wait staff is just okay. The waiter instead of just saying he'd get us the fries gave us a hard time about it. It took 20 minutes to get my beer refilled. The kitchen was really over zealous with the chipolte ranch dressing and it's loud. \\n\\nI enjoy the small sports bar in the back better than the main restaurant, it's quieter, the tables while high are narrower so you don't have to yell over people and the happy hour specials are very good and more reasonably priced.  I wouldn't take a date or anyone I'd like to impress here but If I've got an hour or 2 to kill before fighting traffic on 128 it's a decent enough spot to cool my heels.\\n\\nOne final note, if you don't like eating with kids and families this is not a good place to go. Every time I've been in the main restaurant it's been packed full of kids and families.

We were around the Boiling Point neighborhood and thought to give it a try. We usually bring some food along for our daughter incase the food in the restaurant don't have any kids' selection. It was around noon when we were seated. My daughter was hungry and asked for food. So my wife took out some home made rice and fish for my daughter to eat first. After a few minutes the waitress came to check on what my daughter was eating. We explained to the waitress that food was only for the little one, the waitress seemed okay with it and left. After ordering the waitress came back and told us that they don't allow outside food. I explained to the waitress it was our first time trying this restaurant and we weren't sure if she can eat the food on the menu. We apologized many times and the waitress seemed to be okay with it but reminded us we shouldn't do it next time. ¬†We thanked the waitress for making an exception for us this time. A few minutes after our food was served and we started eating, waitress came and told us that we had to put the food for our daughter away right the way. My daughter was halfway done with her food. ¬†How can you justify taking food away from a child while she's halfway eating it. This was upsetting to a parent. How do you explain to a 2yr old child she has to stop eating in the middle of it. I asked to speak to a manager but the head waitress told me that the manager was away. The head waitress told me that it's the restaurant rule and no exception is allowed. I had no choice but to take our food home. This is the most kid unfriendly restaurant I've ever been to. I understand restaurant needs to make money from their customers and I don't want to be an unreasonable customer. However, the restaurant shouldn't tell us they'll allow it first then suddenly change their mind. This backed me into a corner with no choice but leave the restaurant. In the end we paid and took our food to go. We ended up feeding our daughter in the car.

Honestly, I would have totally missed that if someone did not point it out to me.   The stand is set up like a Chipotle (like many other reviewers have said) so it can be intimidating to put something together yourself.  When I got up to the counter, the cashier recommended a pre-reciped laffa and I went with his suggestion. A \\"laffa\\" is basically a flatter, chewier, stretched out pita that is stuffed with ingredients and wrapped like a burrito.  My laffa had chicken shawarma, baba ganoush, hummus, Israeli salad and other fresh toppings.  It was HUGE!  Two people could have easily split a laffa (and that is what I will do next time around).

You can even get a burger at Perry's (a fine-dining place downtown) for a couple bucks more, and that burger is totally worth $14."},{"name":"Clay Pit","address":"1601 Guadalupe St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Clay Pit has a wonderful lunch buffet.

Then I said \\"don't you close at 8pm? Why are there no donuts?\\" He says, \\"yeah or whenever we sell out.\\" That answer was just not acceptable for a business listing closing hours at 8pm.

Anyways, I used to go to Emory for Law and am going back this summer for Nursing School (yay career change), and have been to Los Loros a few times. \\n\\nFirst: The food's not great. I'd go so far as to say it's not good (at least compared to the \\"equivalent\\" cheap places in DC). All those people talking about the super-salty cheese stacked on everything in these reviews? That's dead on. Another reviewer here talked about the fajita meat having some sort of \\"frozen\\" texture? That's also dead on, and a better descriptor than anything I'd have thought up. The fajitas are brought out to you nice and sizzling, but you definitely aren't getting the best cuts of meat. \\n\\nThat said: This place isn't the horrible unsanitary abyss a few other posts suggest. The food won't make you sick (unless you have a really low tolerance for grease and/or salt, both of which it has too much of). The place has always been clean when I've been there, and it looks surprisingly more cheerful inside than the little strip-mall shop area it inhabits..\\n\\nThe chips and salsa are ok. I've had better, and they don't always serve warm chips, but you can't really knock freebies. And even if it was just mediocre, I've still had plenty of chips with margaritas. Those two go together well. The margaritas are probably one of the big draws here, actually. They're cheap, and not half-bad. In fact, everything on the menu is pretty cheap. You can get a substantial meal for under ten dollars.\\n \\nMy servers haven't always been impeccable, but they've always been nice people, and that counts for something too.\\n\\nI'd give it 2.5 stars if I could... I'll round up to 3 stars on the assumption that you're going to it aware that you're not going to get great food, that you want something cheap, that you want something nearby, or that you want a good margarita or two. Definitely not a destination restaurant, but if you're in the area and are in the mood, it's not a bad stop. Other, better, Mexican food can definitely be found in Atlanta, but it takes some adventurous driving and parking .

If you're a fan of Chinese green onion pancakes, give \\"Sha Phaley\\" a try.  The \\"Phingsha\\" (Beef with bean thread noodles cooked with black mushroom and potato, ginger and garlic) was an oily but definitely a hearty and satisfying dish.  I prefer the flavors of the \\"Tsel Duluma\\" (Oven roasted eggplant cooked with spices, onion, tomatoes, ginger and garlic) which was also oily, but hearty and satisfying.  Two of my friends who dined with me, ordered the \\"Momos\\" (Dumplings) and according to them, it wasn't worth it.  The \\"Deshi\\" dessert (Sweetened rice with raisins, nuts, and coconut) was a warm, fluffy, and not overly sweetened.  First timers of Tibetan cuisine should definitely try this dessert.  The Tibetan Tea (flavored with butter and salt) was unique, but I wouldn't order it again.   \\n\\nService (7.5/10) = Service was good.  The waitress was very helpful when providing recommendations for certain dishes.  \\n\\nAmbiance (8.0/10) = The decor of this restaurant is very unique.  Traditional Tibetan dresses can be seen hung on the walls, and photos of various elements of the Tibetan culture are posted throughout the restaurant.  There is a table towards the back of the restaurant, which holds many books about Tibet and its culture.  \\n\\nOverall Opinion = Since this is the first time I've had Tibetan cuisine, I can't really say if the food here was good Tibetan food.

They have a variety of different options, ranging from meat-lovers to vegetarian dishes. Tbh, some of the vegetarian options were better than the meat ones, meaning this place really knows how to cater to both sides. Everything is truly authentic and they even serve Ethiopian alcohol! \\n\\nIf you've never had Ethiopian food before, I would HIGHLY suggest eating all your meals with the injera bread. I know the rice option might be tempting, but hey, if you're going to travel all the way down here just to eat Ethiopian food, might as well eat it the correct way, right? It's a spongy bread that you wrap all your food in. You essentially use it as your utensil. Trust, it's very good and addicting.\\n\\nThe only downside is the speed of the service.

The pretzel is very small, be warned. It's probably a 1 person appetizer or a small 2-person one. With the four of us, there wasn't much to go around. Still, it was tasty. The potato skins were delicious, but nothing you can't make at home. They hit the spot though so no complaints! They have many other intriguing appetizers that I will definitely partake in next time.\\n\\nMy kids got burgers and fries- these were no typical fast food burgers. There are Portland-style: hand formed organic beef patty on a fabulous bun with organic, real ketchup and salty, greasy made-from-scratch fries. They proclaimed it all the best they'd had in a long time and ate every bite. Score! \\n\\nI cannot remember what I ordered and do not see it on the menu so it must have been a special... doesn't matter. I know I loved it and was impressed by the fresh ingredients and simple flavors. My husband got a veggie patty and he thought it was fantastic too. Overall, this place was a big hit with the entire family, and we liked that it's cute inside and very friendly!

Absolutely no offense,  it is great that people of different cultures try Chinese food; but honestly, when even Chinese don't even eat at a Chinese restaurant, that is almost an equal sign for REALLY bad Chinese food.

The donuts on the savory entrees are not glazed or frosted, so they are basically just a standard fry-bread.

It's a perfect lunch destination if you work in the downtown area. Give yourself a little bit of extra time on that lunch break though, 2-4 people is usually a 10 minute wait.\\n\\nMost people get the buffet at lunch and you should too. You get a little bit of everything. They have a salad that doesn't really require any additional dressing. They also have an egg salad, that is very similar to potato salad, but it lacks any kind of mustard taste to it. I actually found the egg salad to be rather bland.\\n\\nThat's really the only complaint I had though. The buffet includes an amazing Masala selection. Grab some of that over some rice and you are good to go.\\n\\nThey even provide some Naan bread which tastes good dipped into the Masala sauce. The Naan bread really tasted like puffier pita bread to me. It was almost a bit sweet actually.\\n\\nThey also have some delicious tandoori chicken on the bone. Sometimes they switch the choices around in the buffet, but it is always satisfying.\\n\\nOverall, I really like this place. It's close and within walking distance to UT.

In addition, I had asked for a side other than the bacon as I don't eat pork, and the waitress was like, um: what do you suggest?  Since she clearly had no idea what I could substitute, I scanned the other sides, and asked if I could just have a side of strawberries mixed with bananas.

Every restaurant that occupies this space seems to go out of business in less than a year.  Ca Dao retains the same look and feel as its predecessor Pho Pasteur.  Very spacious with plenty of tables and seating.  Booths along the walls, tables in the middle, two flat panel displays on either end of the restaurant, and a bar in the back.\\n\\nCa Dao offers a typical menu of authentic Vietnamese fare including appetizers, pho, and rice dishes as well as boba tea.  One of their unique dishes is (IIRC) #71 on the menu - burnt rice with slices of roast pork.  I've never had anything like it and actually learned about it through former Yelper Kit F's blog (http://friedchickenlips.blogspot.com/2010/08/ca-dao.html).  The rice is heated in a pot and intentionally burned to a light yellow/brown crisp and cooked with egg in the middle.  The result is a very tasty and crispy rice entree topped with savory slices of roast pork and fresh cilantro along with a small side of pickled raw veggies.  Definitely something to try at least once.\\n\\nTheir large bowl of pho is $7.50, so it's about a dollar more than the dedicated pho joints up and down Buford Highway.  The pho dac biet (pho with everything) was listed under their specials for $7.99 for a medium size.  Kind of odd since you can order dac biet on the standard menu at almost any other pho place.\\n\\nWhen we inquired with the server, he said we could get a large bowl of dac biet without meat balls for $7.50.  Apparently adding the meat balls and decreasing the size from large to medium costs 49 cents?  Not a big deal, but definitely confusing.  The pho was large, authentic, and meaty.  The slices of roast beef were a little chewy.  Basil, culantro, bean sprouts, etc. were fresh.  Broth was relatively bland, but overall, the bowl wasn't bad and certainly did its job filling me up.  Service was good.  Both server and owner seemed nice.\\n\\nI've visited this restaurant, both on the weekend and during the week, and each time, business seemed slow.  I blame the bad location.  It's located in one shady strip mall.  Next door to the restaurant is a pool hall (always empty), \\"B Spa\\" (where the blinds and curtains are always closed), and a travel agency.  All these empty businesses, yet the parking lot always has at least a half dozen cars.  The pool hall and/or spa have got to be a front for something.\\n\\nAnyhow, Ca Dao is one of those restaurants you want to see succeed and one of the reasons why Yelp exists (to help small businesses like this succeed).

Next, please.\\n\\nAfter a bit of a disappointment, we were finally transported to Foodie Heaven with the \\"Smoked Duck Red Curry\\" dish. I can only say good things about it. The flavours of the smoked duck married with the red curry, pineapple chunks, and soft-boiled egg was a winner - spicy, sweet and salty.\\n\\nAn even brighter light came calling in the form of \\"Dark Chocolate Pot De Creme\\". The ingenuity in the combination of this dessert is the reason why dishes like these could be priced accordingly. For a restaurant serving authentic Thai came a fusion of sourness in the Tamarind Semifreddo sitting on top of a wafer waiting to fall on a bed of dark chocolate custard. That's Thai-Italian-French altogether in one tiny glass.\\n\\nOverall presentation was lackluster. And while Thai condiments should come for free in each table, were being sold at CAD2.00 each.\\n\\nAnd that's essentially why I'm giving it three stars. In fact I find that there was more potential for the Chef in creating fusion Thai dishes to justify in maintaining the same price point."},{"name":"Champions","address":"110 Huntington Avenue","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"They have plenty of room and TVs. \\n\\nTheir food is relatively reasonable.

My daughter had broken her leg 2 days prior and was still adjusting to her crutches, so getting in was a hassle. However, we were sat immediately because they were nowhere near busy. They had ample staff and the 5 of us were seated in a large booth. That's pretty much where anything positive ends. We sat, and four of us took turns going to the restroom. And then we sat. And we looked at the menu. And waited some more. And then we looked around at the people sat after us. The people who had drinks from the bar and appetizers delivered. We watched as staff stood around and talked with each other. And we waited some more. And finally after more than 15 minutes we decided to leave. So we stood up, with our toddler, and our clumsy kid on crutches and we made our long walk to the door very obvious given our group. And still, nothing. We walked to the door, two people at the hostess stand just stared at us, as we held it open for the kids to exit, and still nothing. So my husband went back in and told a manager that we sat all that time and never once were we greeted or were any orders attempted to be taken. However, every table sat after us had food and drinks on their tables. Incredibly negative experience and we won't repeat our visit when we are in Austin, which is often. I think that between the hostesses, the manager and the waiter, it is inexcusable that no one noticed that we were without drinks or chips and salsa.

Sambusas where the choice, with minced beef. Very crisp, meat was very well seasoned, plus the dip pulled it off nicely. After a ton of questions about the menu, we all decided on what to get; since my wife was with us, and I wanted to try a little of everything, the meat lovers was perfect. Allowed us to pick in between 3 different types of meat, so we chose Ribeye, Filet Mignon, and Salmon. Oh, it was hella delicious; Tender cubes, well seasoned, even the vegetables were delicious!

The tacos we ordered were pretty good as well. We tried the baja fish, the mahi mahi, the chicken, and the pork belly. They all were good. The baja fish was fried - I typically don't eat a lot of fried food and would have liked to know that before, but nonetheless it was still good. The tacos range from $2.50 to $3.50. They are a little on the smaller side, so you'll have to order a few more if you're hungry.\\n\\nThe drinks were where things kinda hit a sour note, literally. The margarita was very sour on the first attempt. I don't send drinks back but this one was absolutely undrinkable. They remade it (I guess adding more sweetness to it) and it was better.

This drink was literally filled with lime wedges and mandarin oranges. It was one of the most difficult drinks I've ever tried to drink. Pulp kept getting stuck in the straw, the fruit wedges were in the way. Since I don't send drinks back, I suffered through it. The way we found out was because the waiter asked if we wanted another and we said no because the MARGARITA was too much work to enjoy, in which he said those weren't margaritas.

So, bummer because I had already paid for a dessert and never got to eat it.\\n\\n2. We like spicy food, but order medium because, well, we know better at an Indian restaurant.

When we walked in the line was almost out the door, which again almost deterred us away because we were all on the brink of starvation and didn't want to wait. But since we already parked in the garage and everything, our driver made the executive decision to just stick it out. Gotta say that has been the smartest decision he has ever made in his entire life ;). \\n\\nWith the long line in mind, it actually went by pretty quickly. We came during lunch hours so obviously the place was busy and bustling with business. They had menus at the entrance so you can decide before you get to the register to place your order which was lucky for us because it was our first time and I'm pretty sure I changed my mind several times before making a final decision on what to eat. In my defense, they had a lot of tasty sounding options to choose from and any foodie knows that this is a VERY crucial decision to make. I was having a hard time choosing between The Goodnight and Primetime and then I saw they had interesting milkshakes, not your everyday chocolate or strawberry milkshake that has become the standard at other burger places. Mexican Vanilla? Raspberry white chocolate? Caramel & Sea Salt? Or Nutella & chocolate pretzels? My head was kind of spinning there, the unfortunate consequences of loving food so much I guess. As we were getting closer to the counter I saw that they had mexi-colas on tap. That was a game changer right there and completely botched the final decision. Milkshake or soda? I decided to get both because you only live once, right? Or at least that's what everyone else has been saying these days . In the end I ended up getting the Primetime burger, the Kennebec fries, a caramel & sea salt milkshake and a blackberry soda. Also, they tag and hold your table for you after someone goes up and down the line to ask how many is in your party. We had six people in our party and were seated outside but luckily it was a really nice day to enjoy some Austin weather and eats.\\n\\nNow for the food, I'll start off by saying that it was like I have never eaten a meal in my 23 years of breathing. So, in other words, it was REALLY good. Let me start with the milkshake because that was the first thing I went to when our food came. Oh, my gosh that was probably the best milkshake I've ever had in my life. It was sweet and salty but not too sweet and salty. You can also taste how fresh the fries are and since I decided to be crazy and just order everything I wanted, I also decided to try all three sauces - the BBQ chiptole, their special ketchup that I'm obviously blanking on right now and their \\"sassy sauce.\\" My favorite was decidedly (since I absent-mindly kept going back to it to dip my fries in) the sassy sauce, which has horseradish, honey mustard and something else in it. As for the burger, I think \\"good\\" is an understatement. The combination of the Kobe beef, truffle aioli, caramelized onions and steak sauce is pretty much what perfection between two freshly baked buns sounds and looks like. One of the best burgers I've ever had hands down. \\n\\nWe will definitely be back when we visit Austin and I'll use my next visit to try some of the other things on the menu that I had a hard time choosing between. But don't worry, if it's your first time and you end up having the same problems I had with indecisiveness and second guessing your food order because everything sounds perfect, I'm almost certain that any decision you come to will be the right one. There are no wrong choices here. And finally, the staff and service at Hopdoddy is wonderful as well.

I got there when the line was pretty long so it took awhile to finally order. Once I got up there to order the staff was really friendly. There was an option for a regular mimosa or a \\"Pint\\" mimosa. Of course I got the Pint. Once you order you get a number and if you've ordered and alcoholic beverage then you wait over by the bar for it, until they call your name. It took awhile again to get my drink, but they were busy and the bartenders never stopped moving. Once I got my Mimosa Pint, I went and sat down to wait for my food. The inside was pretty crammed but outside there were a lot of great places to sit. I'm pretty sure my friend got us the best table out there (by the Garden District Sign) which was a Bonus.\\n\\nNot too long after my food arrived. I went traditional with the American Breakfast, scrambled eggs, biscuit, bacon and hashbrowns. You might think it sounds boring but it was so tasty, perfectly portioned and not too expensive. I cleaned my plate and then went and got my friend and I another Pint Mimosa. She got the breakfast sandwich. It looked so good. From friends who have been there many times, they recommend the Sol Taco. I also want to go back and try out the Crawfish Omelette.\\n\\nThe atmosphere was very hipster, but lot of families were dining there as well. It was a well-rounded & unique place that felt very Austin Texas. You can dress fancy to casual and parking wasn't too bad. I recommend you giving it a try."},{"name":"Myers & Chang","address":"1145 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I really don't have the words to explain how amazing this restaurant is. Everything that I got was incredibly tasty and my server was super knowledgeable about all of the offerings that were on the menu and made great recommendations about how to manage a dinner order for just one person. I was seated at the kitchen bar which really meant I was seated right in front of the walks that the chefs were cooking in which provided me with a really great show and I was very happy to be seated there. It might not be the best place to be seated if you are not a party of one just because it's a little difficult to shift and hold a conversation with the person next to you as I noticed for the party next to me. I started off with the Thai pork lettuce wraps which they obligingly left the cilantro out of and got the charred octopus and grilled corn as a main. This was really more than enough for one person and if you are two, I'd say adding another entree would be more than enough. My server talked me through all of the options and was patient with me as I dallied through the menu. I got a drink that had pink peppercorns in it and was a really nice refreshing Counterpoint to the heavier octopus.\\n\\nI received a complimentary starter which was the pickled vegetables and those were amazing perfectly tart and sharp and a good refresher to the palate after day of heavy eating and too much. The pork lettuce wraps are do it yourself so you received a plate of meat and a ton of veggies and it's an easily splittable portion which they will do for you if you indicate that you are only one person dining and would not be able to eat the whole portion. The charred octopus and corn was fairly well-balanced but I think a bit heavy on the corn which was served on the cob so that was a bit messy to eat. I believe in might have been charred or coated in butter so that also made the entire dish just a little bit heavy so I would not recommend getting it if you were getting another meat dish like I did. It's probably a better match to a vegetable starter or to have by itself. I did not order dessert but was served some meringues that came with my check. \\n\\nThe food was delicious the decor was perfectly kitschy and the servers were amazing. certainly a place I would return to if I lived in Boston"},{"name":"Xian Sushi and Noodle","address":"1801 E 51st St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"For authentic hand pulled Taiwanese noodles, this is the place.

We had ordered a fairly large (sounding) plate of sushi but there was very little actually served. For around $30 we thought we'd get enough to feed 2 people but it was barely enough for one! And I was underwhelmed by the flavor. Cowfish presents a theoretically interesting blend of sushi and unconventional ingredients (especially beef). But neither part really stood out.

It's also pretty spicy, like one of those lingering burns that don't go away. That's not the biggest problem though. The dish's main weakness in the overabundance of one flavor. The peanut sauce was way too peanuty and sweet, making it very one dimensional. Don't try to eat anything else after a bite of this 'cause the only thing you will taste is sweet fiery peanuts.

Little did I know that we had already reached our high point of the evening. \\n\\nThe entrees were lackluster.  We had ordered the Chilean Sea Bass, roasted crisp, and the Swordfish Steak.

The topping on the swordfish had almost no flavor, and the broth with the seabass had no flavor. At this end of the dining spectrum, you should not have to reach for the salt shaker to flavor your food!\\n\\nLuckily we had also ordered a side dish- the Crab Fried Rice. Unfortunately, it was awful. For starters, a good fried rice is made with short grain sticky rice- not long grain rice that remains seperate.While it was garnished with crab meat, and did have the advertised mushrooms, it was lacking in flavor. Unless you count an overly generous application of soy sauce as flavor. It was very close to inedible.\\n\\nDessert was good but not great. ordered the Chocolate Mousse. Got a little concerned when forks appeared before it was served. When it arrived, the mystery was solved. The Mousse was more of a solid consistency served in a wedge shape. I think that if you are going to call something a Mousse, it should be a Mousse! I was expecting a light fluffy dessert that is eaten with a spoon, not the dense and very heavy one that was presented.

Don't let the price fool you that was the most expensive burger on the menu but it was well worth it.

They finally seat us -- next to the door to THE SMOKING PORCH, with the disgusting stench wafting in with each party going in or out. I would have been LONG GONE by this point if I were alone, but my party had intentions for Hooters. NOT ME. We got moved to a different table -- just as another party was being seated, who then had to be moved elsewhere. One in our party ordered wings medium; they came mild. I asked for no butter on the bun for my Mahi sandwich; it came soaked in butter. The waitress had it replaced -- with a bun that was raw, not even toasted.

The eggs are steaming hot (and they make them to order), and the size of the burrito will fill you up for breakfast. I wasn't a huge fan of the refried beans, and the ranchero sauce overwhelmed the other flavors a bit, but in general I liked it. I've eaten the other stuff there too: the taquitos, the torta, drank horchata. Personally I like El Pelon's torta better because tortas deserve better bread than the subs used at Herrera's, and I think El Pelon's hot sauce is spicier. But Herrera's is definitely the best Mexican I've found yet in downtown. The restaurant is clean; the workers are friendly; they play great Mexican music; and it has nice seating.

Everytime I go here I end up going \\"oh, I'm just going to have a small meal\\", to \\"wow, that was good, maybe I'll have a little more\\", to \\"do you have an extra bottle of wine somewhere that will go with these 10 dishes we ordered for three people?\\" It's a vortex of super-good flavors and my money! \\n\\nSo this time, I wanted to stave it off. I was meeting a friend before he went back to Hong Kong and wanted some Italian (he's from Vancouver originally so he's also been here too). We agreed on having the Chef's choice 7-course meal (3 antipasti, 2 pasta, 1 main, 1 dessert), for $45/person + tax/tip. Altogether, it's quite a good deal, and my friend had the same problem as me. \\"I just had dim sum three hours ago!\\" he warned me beforehand, but still agreed to have the same meal. \\n\\nWe're gluttons. But hey, food is to be eaten! \\n\\nThe first antipasto was a platter of cured meats and other little olives and dips. It was expansive with some nice homemade touches, including pickled mushrooms and canned vegetables. Overall, a solid starter.\\n\\nThen came the fun. There was a parmesan souffle with mushrooms which was excellent - it was like floating on clouds. Only water sucks compared to parmesan cheese, milk and eggs! So I had uber-clouds. \\n\\nFinally, the appetizers concluded with a platter sliced pork with tuna (a clone of what's at La Ghianda), which was very well done. The saltiness in the tuna accented nicely with the pork, which was a boiled variety and thus very light whilst a bit heavy with the marbling in the meat. \\n\\nThen came their primi. Their pastas were a porcetta tortellini, which was great - tortellini firm and chewy, which accented the salty and slightly crispy porcetta nicely. there was a bit of cheese in the filling too, which helped to mild out the potential for a bit too much of a pork infusion. There wasn't much of a sauce other than some olive oil and maybe a slight herb, which really brought out the prime ingredient of porcetta and made it center stage. \\n\\nThere was also a tagliatelle with mushroom ragu and more pork, which was a lovely light sauce on top of a hearty feeling pasta. It accented the tortellini very well, though at this point I was wondering if we were going to have a pork chop for secondi. \\n\\nThe main was hangar steak with a salad to top it, which was absolutely phenomenal. I was already starting to feel stuffed and the main slid down perfectly - the meat was perfectly cooked and well-flavored, and the salad was dressed the right amount so as to give it a good tangy flavor but nothing overpowering. I loved the addition of raw hazelnuts to the salad, which allowed there to be a refreshing crispness with the unique flavor raw hazelnuts have - that pronounced sweetness that's more evident than with other raw nuts, which accented the salad and the hearty saltiness of the steak very well. \\n\\nDessert was a trio of items. There was a flourless chocolate cake with a prune, which was decadent, slightly rich and the sweetness balanced the bitter cocoa nicely. Then there was a chocolate ice cream which was more relaxing, with a succulent sweetness accented by the presence of candied coffee on top to give it a crunch and a kick. Finally, there were peaches in cream, which you can't screw up. If you do, you're really doing something wrong. In a word: exquisite. \\n\\nThe service was also excellent. We had very attentive servers that were quite good at chatting as well as making sure you were appreciating your meal. The decor is lovely - classic and unobtrusive. \\n\\nWhat else needs to be said but perfetto?"},{"name":"Oaks Bottom Public House","address":"1621 SE Bybee Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Stopped in for a quick drink on our way to Jade after seeing Star Wars.

They were presented nicely, but still cold in the centre. We sent them back to the kitchen since they seemed underdone. \\n\\nThe gorkhali khasi was too salty for my liking.

My first trip to Blue Star was eye opening. Every donut shop I've been to in my life has pretty much been the same. Same variety, same flavor. Varying degrees of freshness. Blue Star is truly something unique and special. They keep all the sweetness in the glaze. I found myself, for the first time, not reaching for a glass of water or desperately needing to brush my teeth after eating a donut. There is no shortage of sweetness, but they let the unique ingredients flavor their donuts, not the sugar!\\n\\nMy top three favorite flavors are the Blueberry Basil Bourbon donut, Passion Fruit Nib, and the Rosemary Raspberry. I prefer the classic fluffy yeast donuts over their cake donuts. (The cake donuts tend to be a bit harder and greasier.

I went back and forth from a steak n cheese to a meatball sub w cheese. Eventually after much debate I settled on the meatball sub.  Very glad I did. It hit the spot times 3.\\n\\nThe sauce was very hearty and had a bit of hot sauce added into it. The meatballs weren't your typical rolled up balls, these were more like slices of beef cooked with their homemade sauce. The roll was perfectly toasted as well. You need a toasted roll when having a meatball sub or it gets messy.  My girlfriend got the steak n cheese and I took a nice big bite and it was very good. Not very tough and it was cut perfectly and melted w cheese.  Her friend also got the meatbal sub and another got the Chicken Parm which looked awesome.

We started off with a chicken wing appetizer and did the half/half (half spicy and half soy garlic).  I found the chicken to be moist, the breading to be just the right amount of crispy deliciousness, cooked to perfection.  \\n\\nWe also split a Tteokbokki appetizer (spicy chewy rice cakes that look like little logs in a generous portion of red sauce.) I've never before had it with mozzarella cheese sprinkled on top, and I can't say that the cheese was a necessary addition.  There was also vermicelli noodles mixed into the sauce, which I just found bizarre. Certainly Bon Chon has its own spin on this dish.  The sauce and the spice in this dish is something I crave, and I'm so happy I can now get it on a regular basis.\\n\\nMy husband had the Beef Bulgogi.  The meat, rice and vegetables were delicious.  I had the Stone Pot Bibim Bap.  I've eaten this dish at a number of restaurants over the years and I would rank this as \\"pretty good\\" in comparison, but not the best I've had. Our stone pot was actually so hot that instead of just crisping the rice, it actually burnt it! I am not Korean, but I don't think that is supposed to happen.  I did like that they gave me my own bottle of the spicy sauce to mix into the dish, as normally when I ask the waitress for extra of this sauce (and I always do) they seem annoyed at other restaurants.  \\n\\nThe service was impeccable.

Two different crowds. Two different groups of workers. It's really crazy.\\n\\nFirst off, the outside patio is very large! I think they could fit some more tables out there so that more people could enjoy. The interior is large as well and divided into two spaces, the main area, where you order and there are tables every where, and a more secluded area - nice for working or studying. They have a little station of books and kid toys off to the corner which is a nice thought. I appreciate that they change out the art pretty regularly, some is awesome and some is not - pretty standard for any coffee shop. They seem to host regular community events, which is nice. We hope to hit up a movie night in the near future. \\n\\nWe love this place for breakfast - the cuban con leche is delicious, iced or hot. The dirty chai is sadly not. Their breakfast tacos are sizable and delicious. The pastry selection is nice. We love their hash brown style potatoes they include in some of the tacos. Morning service is friendly and helpful. Crowd watching is great - it's the whole shabang: hipsters, parents, kids, rich, poor, empty nesters, cyclists, runners, college students, hippies, everyone. It's become our Sunday morning tradition.\\n\\nNight time has a whole different vibe - live music outside, beer and wine, and a different crowd. More hipsters/college students and less empty nesters. We got some coffee and smoked cigars while watching some decent live music in the courtyard. It was nice. I didn't totally feel like I fit but it wasn't uncomfortable. No kid with me so I could pretend that I wasn't a mom at all. Just out on a date with my man.

This was a moment built up by everyone in my office and all the friends I've met since moving to Austin - basically everyone I know would have a foodgasm at the mention of Hopdoddy's. That's a big name to live up to. \\n\\nMonday night is the time to go. There were five people in line when we arrived, and quite a few tables open. Without a ridiculously long wait time like all the reviews up here, I'm worried I didn't get the full experience. Never fear. I got the classic burger, fries, and a salted caramel milkshake to make sure I wasn't missing out on anything. \\n\\nFirst, the burger. It was a fantastic burger, I really can't complain. Worthy of a foodgasm? Nope. It was good, but it wasn't out of this world. Try Argentinian meat and tell me you don't die and go to heaven. This experience wasn't quite as good as that. The bun was a little dry and didn't quite compliment the meat. This could be fixed by looking at the hamburger as a whole package and picking the proper bun for the experience you're looking to create. After a few bites, I took my bun off.\\n\\nThe French fries were phenomenal. Thin and crispy. I added a little salt and dug in. Delicious. I also tried my friend's truffle fries/truffle sauce. That was good too, but I wasn't impressed enough with it to make it worth the extra 5 dollars. \\n\\nThe milkshake: I had a discussion at the register with the cashier to make the big decision - salted caramel or the Nutella pretzel option. Both sound amazing. Normally I lean toward chocolate. As a virgin hopdoddy experience, however, I chose the classic option. It was absolutely delicious. I would have no hesitations about getting that again, but I might try the Nutella one next time, just because chocolate. \\n\\nThat brings me to the end of the review: the verdict. I'll be back, for sure. The food was great and nothing about the experience disappointed me. The only caveat I have is that I won't be waiting in a 3 hour line to eat...it wasn't THAT good.

We had fled the lines at Pine State and Genie's, our stomachs growling with hangxiety. Since we were on our way to Purrington's Cat Cafe, we decided to find a place to eat near there instead. We drove by Bridge's, which looked very unassuming, and after we drove for several more blocks, decided that it was the best we could do for now. (Plus, a quick lookup on Yelp revealed that it may be better than we expected.) If you have also driven past this fine establishment and wondered what it's like--wonder no more. Go in. \\n\\nWe got two of their homemade baked goods to go, which, as we knew they would be, were really good as well. I can't wait to go back for more catfish hash!!!!! Really good prices for the food as well. \\n\\nThe actual place itself is a little small; I think they might be better off with more 2-person tables (there were mostly 2-people groups when we were there, which left some empty chairs because the tables were meant for 4).

I ordered pepperoni and mushroom for myself and my friends that I am staying with in Austin and they deliver this to me? 3 slices of pepperoni and mushroom and 5 slices of cheese pizza. When I call to inquire I ask for the manager and a guy comes on and says his name is Ale. I proceed to tell him what happened and he starts seriously playing games with me. Pretending to look up my number while talking over me and saying things like oh it's 444 or 999. Rude and honestly astonishing. I've never experienced being treated like this. Check out the photos I uploaded. I tipped them 15% too so it's not like I tried screwing them over.  Like WTF who does this ??! He tells me that the order came through like this and that he can send it to me. I respond by saying I have a copy of the order and mine states that I didn't order a half order ( which by the way even if I did order that they totally gypped me on my order! - see uploaded photos ) so I kindly ask him to send me his copy and that I'll wait on the call with him to receive it. Needless to say, he couldn't seem to be able to send it over to me. He then claims he is sending me a new pizza which surprise surprise never arrives . Wow. Whoever owns this place should fire everyone involved in this scenario. Someone who treats your customers like this doesn't give a crap about your business. \\n\\nUpdated review: Admittedly I was wrong and he did actually come through and bring me a new pizza. It wasn't the same size but at least he sent me a new one, with the correct toppings. This one was actually much fresher than the original one which made me wonder- Maybe they thought they could give me someone else's order and I wouldn't notice ? Anyway, I'm glad I at least got the right order. I'm not a hater as I originally had a one star review but I updated it because at least he came back and gave me the right order.

The cool and creamy Tzatziki is the perfect compliment to the hot meatballs, which have a slight crunch to the outside, while remaining tender on the inside.\\n\\nThe portion sizes, even for appetizers, were quite large. We struggled to finish everything we had. Matter of fact, I think the scallops were the only dish we did finish.

The American cheese was...too cheesy in a cheap way, while the bacon and ketchup were way too sweet.  Arugula was not fresh; clearly a couple of  days old.  The sweet potato fries that came were not that warm or crisp; clearly they had been sitting around for a while.

This was my first time here and I was hoping to love this place.

The service was very friendly, order at counter and they bring to your table. I could see at least 4 people behind cashier working in kitchen behind counter. They have a display case with specialty pies (I'll try one of those slices next time) that looked good. The interior? Not particularly impressive, but no big deal. My pizza wasn't bad, but wasn't great. Although I liked the flavor of the sauce I felt there was too much off it. When I picked up my first piece all the cheese and roni just slid off pizza onto my plate, so I opted to fork and knife it instead. The bottom crust didn't cut too easily and on a paper plate, again messy. The outside crust I'll say was quite fresh and not over cooked.

The meat in the sauce tasted a bit off so I only had a few bites, also the sauce was really watery.

Although they did use fresh garlic, not the minced type from a jar.\\n\\nOur final bill came out to 30$ plus tax and tip (this was after the discount too).  Had our pasta come with some house bread and a small salad this would have been a fine price for a mom and pop pizza takeout joint.   But seriously people they charge more than Broadway's pizza or Giovanni's and are a lower calibur.\\n\\nThe only reason I gave this place three stars and didnt complain about our pasta was because our waiter was so nice , the garlic was fresh, and the cheese on our pasta was nicely browned.\\n\\nWho knows maybe this was an off night , but weird tasting meat (on a Saturday, which should be a busy night) and no salad means that I won't be back."},{"name":"Hopdoddy Burger Bar","address":"1400 S Congress Ave, Ste A190","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Find me a place that's significantly better at burgers than Hopdoddy's.

I guess if I knew I was going to roughly get tipped 18% basically because each check comes to roughly $100 I would drag ass too. \\nThe price: I think the prices are high for this place considering ruths chris lamb chops are a hell of a lot bigger for only $3 more. Ok cool you get fish flown in daily from europe, but who can tell by taste?! You could've taken a cab and brought it from the ga aquarium and who would know the difference?!! I asked the server for some additional sauce that accompanied my lamb chops, he brought me out a small dish after 15 minutes of waiting. I finished my dinner and when we received the check my companion was charged $5 for the damn sauce!!! Really dude?!!! I had to wait 15 minutes for the shit and at that point the crowd had died down smh that really soured my experience because you as a server should have said the sauce will be an additional charge of $5 is that ok? Hell they do it at wendys, they do it a Chinese take outs, YOU CAN'T TELL ME 2 TABLESPOONS OF TAZAKI SAUCE IS $5?!!! I would've then said hell no, finished my lamb chop, and not missed my movie screwing around waiting on the server. \\n\\nWould I come back....... maybe, the food was good I can't deny that but $120 for dinner and fogo de Chao next door is all you can eat (I'm a meat eater not fish eater unless it's sushi) for the same amount damn near.  I would really have to have a taste for the food to come back. I enjoyed the experience being it was my first time here on a date night but they need to fix these issues. Oooh!! Valet appears to be manditory, it's a $2 fee and that's not considered a tip. So clean you vehicle up before you come here. Highlights of the night was seeing an older \\"John\\" with a call girl, it was hilarious that everything on the menu had to be explained to her by the waitress and he was looking at the call girl like tonight I popped that viagra so eat up that shit you cant pronounce because your brown suga ass is mine!!!

Our group of friends went into Press Club with our toddlers (who have been eating at Press Club since they were newborns), and the young lady behind the counter visibly cringed throughout our meal.  Afterwards, I went up to say hi (because she was so obviously uncomfortable with having kids in there I wanted to check in with her, since I knew our toddlers acted like...well, toddlers, even though they weren't loud) and she said, \\"We don't have highchairs in here for a reason.  Babies are disruptive to other patrons and I was uncomfortable the whole time your group was here.\\"  When my jaw dropped (it's a neighborhood place, we sat at the back table away from the main area, we took the kids to play at Piccolina between ordering and getting the food to minimize the wait time, and our toddlers were not acting up by toddler standards), I managed to say...\\"but...but, I've been here when there was a baby up on the bar (the owner's kid) and he said it was OK to have babies here. She said (and I quote), \\"I don't believe you.\\"  And then went on about why babies didn't belong at Press Club, and said again how babies made her feel \\"uncomfortable\\" in the restaurant where she works.  Really?  Because being that rude to a regular patron who sends you tons of business (friends, neighbors, visitors, mom's groups, business associates) is a terrible business strategy in a neighborhood where every other house has kids. \\n\\nWow, I'm really sorry that I and my friends, all of who were weekly (or more than weekly) regular Press Club patrons before having kids committed the major sin of trying to have a sandwich out after having a baby. We've sent Press Club thousands of dollars of business in the past because they make a mighty fine sandwich, but I won't be doing that again.  I agree, Press Club isn't designed for toddlers...but there's a difference between not being baby-friendly, and being so rude that I felt like they didn't want our business.   They were rude from the moment we walked in the door with our kids.  Hey, maybe she's forgotten that even rude hipster servers were babies at one time.  I'll miss the excellent iced coffee and tasty sandwiches...but even more, I'll miss feeling welcome in our neighborhood sandwich place.  We're a nice group of moms and dads who won't be going back.\\n\\nUpdate:  I talked to one of the owners today, who said that while of course everyone of all ages is welcome at Press Club, they are really not set up to accommodate toddlers, particularly when they do unruly toddler things like walking on the stairs, dropping things and putting their feet on the table.  Fair enough, our babies did do those things ...and I'm not one of those moms that thinks toddlers belong everywhere, so I get that as a choice.   However, given that it is a sandwich shop in a family neighborhood, he was very VERY intolerant of any toddler behavior.  (For example, the owner told me in the shocked tones that might be more appropriate for someone who tried this at a museum exhibit at the Smithsonian, \\"Your baby...put his feet...on my table. And stood up.  I saw it.\\")  However, he said he had a \\"productive conversation\\" with the staff member about how to handle similar situations, which don't arise that often, since they don't get a lot of toddlers at Press Club.  I still feel like she was a LOT ruder than she needed to be, but apparently she felt backed into a corner when I went to talk to her after the meal, since she felt like our toddlers were disruptive and we weren't controlling their behavior enough.  In our defense, the kids were never left to run loose (one of the adults was never more than six inches from them), they were not in the main dining room area and they were quiet, so we thought that was good enough for little ones, but both the owner and this staff member felt that we let them behave in ways that were not appropriate for the Press Club.  The owner said he hopes to keep our business in the future, and to see us back at Press Club when our kids get older.  It was a weird interaction, since he was essentially saying we didn't supervise our kids enough, and we usually get people coming up to us and saying what good restaurant babies we have, and what a good job we do keeping them busy.  If they felt our kids were out of line at Press Club, they should have come up to us and let us know while we were eating, and we would have been happy to adjust what we were doing right then, since we know that toddlers can be difficult.  Plus, we are huge tippers (20-25%) when we travel with toddlers to compensate for toddler challenges.  Though the owner said they welcome people of all ages, as a parent of a toddler, I would strongly advise that you go elsewhere until your kids are elementary school age or older, since Press Club (and definitely their staff) is NOT toddler or kid friendly."},{"name":"Cup O'Joe","address":"627 S 3rd St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Stopped in on the way to work for an Almond Moo & bagel.

Emphasizing this point, one only need to hear that the brand has a location in Japan. Though reasonably unknown outside Portland except to foodies, hip enthusiasts, and the Japanese, Blue Star is a Voodoo-killer in my opinion. There are not as many options, and the donuts may not reach the same level of insanity ingredient-wise, but there are crazy flavor combinations available and many have garnered a following. There are donuts here featuring ingredients rarely found in pastries, for example, raspberry and rosemary. The combination actually works well. \\n\\nBlue Star makes a small amount of donuts every day and sells-out day after day. If you come here only looking for one flavor, you may just find yourself out of luck should you get here long after opening, especially on a weekend. \\n\\nThis place is certainly worth a visit if you love donuts. One will not see these flavors or ingredient combinations ever again, potentially. And the classics alone are worth the visit. The old-fashioned buttermilk, for example, is one of the best I've ever tried. In general, the buttermilk offerings are too-notch. Some of their donuts can have a very un-donut type of texture, which can be surprising, off-putting to some. The biggest negative though, and many would say the only negative, is the prices.

The space is actually Sully's breakfast cafe in the mornings and Gaucho's by night. Same business, different options depending on the time of day. Gaucho's doesn't open until 8 pm on Saturdays. The interior setting is quiet and has a few gaucho decorative flourishes and they have Argentine folklore classics playing in the background. Seems like a two-person shop with the lady cooking and the guy taking orders and serving the food.\\n\\nThe menu isn't huge but has a very representative sampling of Argentine staples. Lots of milanesas/supremas, sandwiches, pastas, etc.  I was starving so I ordered the empanadas (beef) and a entra√±a (skirt steak) /molleja (sweetbreads)/chorizo. They were out of sweetbreads so they offered to swap it with some hanger steak. While I waited I got a huge piece of fresh bread on a cutting board along with some chimichurri. The empanadas came with a small side salad and were fried (as opposed to oven-baked).  I thought the small salad was THE side salad, but when the beef came out there was another huge salad that accompanies that dish. The portions are very, very generous for the price. I am a sucker for empanadas fritas...most restaurants here just make them in the oven.\\n\\nThe main dish itself was served on a wood tablet like you'd get at an Argentine parrilla (nice touch.) The beef was awesome. Really well prepared, \\"Argentine style,\\" which is difficult to explain. Not pink, not \\"well done,\\" and definitely not dry. It manages to be well-cooked but still juicy and delicious. Even the way the meat is cut is very \\"authentic.\\" If you buy skirt or hanger in the U.S., you usually won't get the same pattern of subcutaneous fat that sits right underneath the meat, but you see it on every cut in Argentina. I don't know where Gaucho's gets their meat, but it was delicious.\\n\\nA great place and I hope they make it.

Portions are small - hence you need to order sides. Sides available are fries or chicken fried rice and egg rolls. Fries and fried rice are only 3.99, Egg rolls are 3 bucks and change for one, 5.99 for two. They are good sized egg rolls.\\n\\nHOWEVER........you get way more vegetables in an entree than at a typical counter service place. We had never been here, so we ended up ordering 2 beef teriyaki bowls (for us) and 2 Korean BBQ bowls (for the kids - since they like my Korean BBQ/Bulgoki). Kids ended up liking the beef in the teriyaki bowl, but not the chicken (it wasn't like my MY Bulgoki chicken, so that's kind of a compliment?) It tasted like a \\"not too horribly sweet\\" version of a sweet and sour chicken, with lots of crisp tender peppers, onions, snow peas, and thinly sliced carrots, and pineapple. The beef teriyaki bowl had the same - just no pineapple. \\n\\nNaturally, the kids rejected all the vegetables, which was fine - I figured I would eat them, and give them my chunks o' protein. Bob anticipated that this might happen, too and figured there might be more veggies than protein (which rarely happens at Disney, but did THIS time!) so we bought two orders of fries too. So I ended up donating all of my beef from my meal to the kids, and Bob did the same. He got the chicken and some of the kids vegetables and one of the egg rolls, I got the lions share of the kids vegetables, MY vegetables, an egg roll, and my rice plus some leftover rice. The kids ate the beef, and most of their rice, and a bunch of fries. My youngest had one of the Frozen Lemonade cups. She has a big healthy appetite, and could only finish half of it. This is a good dessert, but there is enough in one of these to satisfy two school age kids. Heck, probably enough for two adults. \\n\\nAll in all, it worked out, and probably the healthiest option available to me in pretty much any of the quick service places. Disney has good food, but it's tough to get enough vegetables at a quick service place. We all got out of there full. \\n\\nThey also have honey chicken, which I have been told is super mild, and an Asian chicken sandwich. We didn't try them. I saw someone else get the honey chicken and the chicken fried rice - both looked good. However, I think we will probably end up at Restarauntosaurous next time. Bigger portions, so you don't have to order sides to bulk it out. Restarauntosaurous has a veggie burger now, so that's fine.\\n\\nFor most families with kids who are too old for the kid menu (they have cheeseburger, chicken nuggets, and Uncrustables) and don't LOVE vegetables? The kids aren't going to be happy. However, if you don't need huge portions, and like getting a LOT of vegetables? This is the place for you. \\n\\nSeating is outside, with not a lot of shade.

Here I tried the beef rib, thinking back on the ones I have enjoyed at Salt Lick.  Yes, the meat literally fell off the bone here, which makes you wonder why you pay for the bone too, by weight, in contrast to say Salt Lick where you just pay a standard price.  So I guess I am not partial to beef that falls apart amidst large quantities of fat that need to be trimmed away.  Nor do I enjoy the taste of heavily marbled beef because the fat permeates the meat no matter what you trim.  So I've come to the conclusion that people who like Blacks must like lots of fat and marbling.  I see from some of the other reviews I am not alone in this regard.  Doesn't even compare to Franklin meat for flavor or texture (though I did not have the rib there).  I would not take anyone from out of town here for BBQ unless they told me that is the kind of beef they prefer, so I am not likely to return.  And the other negative is the price of almost $30 for a rib and two sides, plus tip.  Salt Lick is far more reasonable at what I think is $17 for a one rib platter, and $22 for two with sides.  \\n\\nOn the positive side, the staff were very, very friendly.  The rib was taken out of the hot box, as opposed to sitting out on the counter like the brisket, so I was very pleased to have beef served very hot.  The clientele seems pleasant and the building and atmosphere are fitting for a nicer BBQ place.  Lastly, these Black's experiences have saved me a trip to Lockhart."},{"name":"Shake Shack","address":"4400 Ashford Dunwoody Rd, Ste 3025","city":"Dunwoody","stars":"3.5","text":"This is my second time here.

Nice atmosphere"},{"name":"Wild Chix & Waffles","address":"7714 Burnet Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"The interior design drew me in and though the no wifi policy put me off my husband and I decided to play along and even brought our own books - though we didn't read them because I spent the whole time there typing out this review on my phone (using data of course) and he tired of the place before I finished.\\n\\nBasically I can sum up my thoughts on The Factory with this: it's going through a weird time in its life where it really doesn't know who it is or wants to be. It's in a new place where it doesn't really fit in and it's trying way too hard. \\n\\nLet me explain. This place kills it in the design department BUT it is totally misplaced on a coffee shop with a menu selection I just can't figure out (mostly waffle food options, gourmet pop tarts, Asian inspired drinks, carbonated tap water???). From the iPad ordering system to the food and drink presentation (plastic cups of sparkling tap water excluded) to the hip/upscale and eclectic/playful interior design, to the thumping nightclub music being played, it screams boutique hotel lounge bar. Aesthetically that's what it tells me it is. \\n\\nBut then there's Andy Warhol graphics on the door and at the order counter telling me that this is a place to connect with other people and have an actual conversation. *scratches head* But you just had me order my latte and matcha on an iPad (thanks I've already had chicken and waffles at an actual hotel today, and no that is not a joke or embellishment), and you let me choose to be TEXTED when my order was ready with the humorous alert \\"99 problems but hunger/thirst ain't one. Please pick up your order at the counter.\\" Mhmm, so at The Factory they want you to talk to people, just not to the people that work there. Yeah, okay. \\n\\nThere is a mural spanning the wall above the order counter which proclaims \\"Cafe with a soul\\". And yet as I decode the illustrated faces I see they are mostly celebrities (from New York it seems) - though I can't discount the Asian family at the far left end providing stark contrast to Justin Bieber, Donatella Versace, The Beckams, Jay-Z and Beyonc√©. Which leads me to consider that maybe there is a play on words happening here: soul/Seoul??. I'm not sure. But what I am sure of is that as much as I love Leonardo DiCaprio and David Bowie (rest in peace), most of the faces staring down over patrons in no way affirms the message The Factory wants me to buy into, nor does the rest of the atmosphere. I'm not feeling the soul in here. I am feeling the identity crisis. \\n\\nMy husband called it before I did when he said he thinks someone from New York is responsible for this mess. From the mural to the book beside us titled 'Humans of New York\\", to the cultural mash up not usually seen in Austin this place is some failed attempt at blending NY with ATX and it needs to quit, and not because I have anything against culture mashups (as a mixed race woman I am one). But don't tell me you want to facilitate the human connection or whatever (which is great and I do love the intention) but then create a place that in so many ways where it counts is sending a totally different message. \\n\\nBut hey if you really like waffles, are fine with no wifi, don't mind paying $2 for almond milk (wtf!!!), and appreciate the quick jaunt you can make around the corner to Walmart, then I'm sure you'll be thrilled to have a fancy spot in the West Anderson area to grab some coffee. My prediction is that this place will go down just like the adult accoutrements store in the same parking lot that is now a pet supply store. So it might be smart for them to start seeing what new Austin boutique hotel they can re-home all that fun furniture to. I'd make an offer on the face chair but I really don't have the space for it."},{"name":"Bijou Cafe","address":"132 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Best omelette that I have ever had.

In our case the line wasn't too long (we came at 9PM on a Wednesday) but the restaurant was definitely still full of people. We were a little confused on how the seating worked, but this is how it was done: a host will come by you, while you're in line, and ask you how many in your party. Then they will come back and let you know what table to sit in once you have ordered and give you a little slip. The cashier will then ask you what table you were assigned, and voila! Your food will be brought to the table. \\n\\nWe both ordered a Shroom Burger (angus beef, pesto, basil, tomato, mayonnaise, goat cheese and lettuce). The burgers were definitely really good. The patty itself was a little drier than I would have preferred, but the flavors mixed really well otherwise. \\n\\nWe also ordered some Parmesan truffle fries and those were definitely the highlight of the meal. The fries came with sauce (something garlic-y) that was absolutely delicious. Enough fries come for two to share, but be warned, you might be left wanting more! \\n\\nFor dessert we ordered the Nutella pretzel milkshake. The milkshake was also great, the saltiness from the pretzels offset the sweetness of the Nutella for just the perfect blend.\\n\\nOverall, a great experience and great taste.

Anyone can throw large slices of mango and avocado on some crab meat.\\n\\nThe Bond Herb Roasted Chicken Salad by Mark Sapienza of Langham Hotel ($12.75) - The proportion of seasoning (thyme and tarragon) on the chicken was just right. It was a bit hard to eat with the tumbleweed of fried onions on top. The potato salad was heavenly.\\n\\nThe Spicy Tuna Burger by Tim Cushman of O Ya ($19.25) - This was very interesting. The yellowfish tuna was fine chopped, formed into a patty, and then grilled. The combination of spicy mayo, pickled ginger, and kabayaki drizzle was a mouthful, but worked somehow.\\n\\nThe Coppa by Jamie Bissonnette of Coppa/Toro ($12) - This sandwich sounded like a heart attack in a bite (pork belly + mayonnaise + melted cheese). Thankfully, the creaminess was offset by the bite of the raw jalapeno peppers.\\n\\nThe Regal Regis by Susan Regis of Upstairs on the Square ($14.25) - Succulent is how I would describe this sandwich.

I like the original style crust here, it's not quite thin, but not a large deep dish crust.  They have thin crust and deep dish which aren't bad, but i always go for the original these days.  We like damn near all the specialty pizzas here, which is rare the wife and i can agree on the same pie without going al super special order.

At most restaurants if your entire party is not present, you will not be seated.  But, here, that is not the case.  Thus, be prepared to have people cut in line - at the direction of the hostess!

The manager did take the steak off the bill and give us a $25 gift card, which is useless because we won't be returning.  This was to be a special evening celebrating a graduation and an engagement.

Best for it's steak, french fries, Jonah crab claws, and Bananas Foster.\\n\\nStaff:\\nThe bartenders are comedians in disguise. It's really fun to come and sit at the bar here just to listen to their jokes with fellow patrons.\\n\\nThe table service is also more down to earth than at other high-end restaurants, although their mandatory uniform still gives the place an air of refinement. Everyone who works here is friendly, knowledgeable about the menu, and quick when you need them to be.\\n\\nFood:\\nThis is still the best place in town if you're craving a steak. If you want to impress any out-of-towners then order them a Tomahawk. It arrives with a bone the length of your arm which seems to really excite meat-eaters. \\n\\nI also love their french fries (best in town) and their crab claws. This is actually the only restaurant in Austin where I eat crab claws as Eddie V's has consistently nailed this dish to perfection. They never have a fishy flavor, always arrive just slightly chilled, and the dipping sauces are well-prepared. \\n\\nThe menu is predominantly meat or fish, so if you're a vegetarian, you will find some things on the menu but you might also try asking for specially prepared meal, which the chef is happy to accomodate. \\nIt's also a safe restaurant choice to bring parents with finicky palates.\\n\\nDecor & The Bar:\\nI prefer the downtown layout more, however, this location is a classic high-end steak house in the fine-dining area, and in the rest of the place there are either regular tables or high-top tables to choose from. \\nIf you choose to sit at the bar you can either enjoy your meal alone, with your date, or you can socialize and make new friends since the crowd here is really a happy, talkative bunch.  \\n\\nThe crowd is also slightly older here than at the downtown location, but the way I see it, the stories are better too. I always meet some of the most charismatic, funniest people in Austin at the bar here, so if you're really looking to meet nice people and have a few laughs over drinks, this location wins.\\n\\nHowever, it doesn't have live music like the downtown location, so if you're looking for more action to celebrate with some friends, then drive downtown. \\n\\nOverall:\\nYou will have a very good meal here since most items are well-prepared (there's just a few dishes that could be improved on) but overall, you won't be disappointed. Also, the bartenders know to change up how some of the items are prepared, and I've taken their advice, and really enjoyed the dishes much more."},{"name":"Blue Star Donuts","address":"1155 SW Morrison St, Ste 102","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"OMG\\n\\nIf I were a heroin addict, this would be heroin.

My husband and I drove 45 minutes to get here and were seated immediately. We sat for about 20 minutes watching the servers chat and laugh amongst each other. No one ever even took our drink order! Two other couples came in and were immediately seated with drink orders placed. When we saw their food come out we decided to get up to leave. Our server came as we were leaving and said they were in a meeting which we believed was an absolute lie as we were seated in clear view of them. We asked for a manager and was told by one server there was no manager there. She offered free mango juice for us to stay, but we wanted to speak to the manager. Finally, someone named Tee came to talk with us. He said that he is in charge of the front and a head chef. That is quite odd as he was dressed as the other servers and chatting with them when we came in. He said they were not in a meeting and apologized for not assisting us. It infuriated me even more to be blatantly lied to for being ignored. The damage has been done. We have been here several times and even brought our family for the amazing food.

But I won't ever be going back because of two factors: horrible customer service and a noxious environment. I was there late in the afternoon 11/9/17 and they started using some strong detergent to clean the coffee machines. There were still customers in the shop, but I guess they didn't want to stay after to do the housekeeping so they started cleanup 90 minutes early.\\n\\nThe detergent fumes were horrible. I waited for them to go away but they just got worse instead. Not just to the point that it made my order taste and smell like detergent, but to the point that they made my sinuses, lungs and throat burn. I have severe athsma. I don't know what the hell I was breathing. But it's a very small cafe so the fumes were inescapable. Out of sheer concern for my health I left, ditching my half-finished coffee and pastry.\\n\\nI complained to the barista, who just said \\"sorry,\\" and told me that they use it every day and she didn't really notice it, which is great for her but doesn't change or make up for my experience in the slightest. That seemed to be all she had to say about it. I left the cafe but a few minutes later my lungs/throat/sinuses still were burning, so I went back and complained to the manager, getting exactly the same responses. This was their response to a longtime regular customer. By the time I had told him what was on my mind my eyes were watering as well.\\n\\nTheir entire reaction was a shrug and a blank stare. They seemed to think that a) I was imagining the whole thing and b) it wasn't any big deal and c) \\"they use that detergent all the time: lots of places do\\" -- as if that made things better instead of worse or as if that fixed my respiratory distress. Just a bland, bored, \\"I'm sorry that was your experience,\\" and nothing else, even when I told them I had athsma. Nothing, no concern or even a refund of the coffee I didn't get to finish. I suggested they could at least wait to use the stuff till customers left, but he just said he didn't think it was that strong, they used it all the time, and ended with the flattest, most insincere \\"I'll take it into consideration,\\" ever, which was WEAK as far as having any concern for a customer. Guess it's more important to them to get out of there early.\\n\\nMy lungs and throat are still burning as I am writing this, 20 min after leaving, and my eyes are starting to water as well as burn. I don't know what they use to clean their cafe, but they clearly have no intention of stopping use or even waiting until the customers have gone. \\n\\nIf employees want to risk their health that's up to them. But I think they also risked my health and that's far from OK. I think OSHA and the health department would agree.\\n\\nBottom line: for something that serious affecting their customers, apparently nobody there cares. I won't be coming back and I'll tell the friends I used to bring here to stay away.\\n\\nSuper, super disappointed that folks who make such good coffee are so awful to their customers."},{"name":"Cherrywood Coffeehouse","address":"1400 E 38th 1/2 St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Open mic night is great and so is the live music here.

I had received some coupons in the mail for free stuff (a free iced coffee, a free breakfast sandwich, and a free smoothie) so I came in to redeem one of them for my wife and get myself something also.The place was slammed, with easily 30 or 40 people waiting for food/drinks. The people making the food were moving really fast, and were putting food out almost as fast as orders were coming in. The people making the drinks however, were moving in slow motion. Three blenders were sitting on the counter, but the girl was making the smoothies one at a time. And you can argue that they're new and they're still learning, but at least they've been training for a while, so even though this is the store's first day, this isn't their first day. Plus I've been to another store's grand opening, and service was nowhere near as slow as this. And even more frustrating was that a black shirt (a shift supervisor or something?) was literally just standing there leaning up against the wall. The only way that he could be any less productive was if he was in fact the wall itself on which he was leaning. After 14 minutes, I contemplated leaving without my wife's smoothie since it was free anyways, however I had also ordered another drink for myself which I had paid for. So I continued to wait. I finally was handed my two drinks 24 minutes after ordering them, only to get to the car and find out that my wife's strawberry smoothie was in fact a strawberry-banana smoothie. Good thing the wife likes bananas, because I was not going back in there again. Obviously, I'll come back again when they've been running for a while, and see if service improves.\\n*****\\nI received a \\"compliment\\" in regards to this review. Scott D. wanted to make sure that I knew that these employees had only been trained for two weeks prior to their opening day, and that it was my own fault that the place was so busy because people such as myself were \\"looking for free stuff\\". Well, Scott, if Wawa didn't want people to come in \\"looking for free stuff\\" then they shouldn't send out coupons for free stuff, and if people coming in to redeem coupons that they were sent in the mail is enough to put you behind as an employee, then maybe you should find a slower paced job. And if two weeks of training isn't enough to prepare you to run more than one blender at a time, then again, maybe you're not competent enough for a job inside a gas station drink bar."},{"name":"Vancouver Christmas Market","address":"1055 Canada Place","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"Never again! $8 per person to get in, $8 to park for 2 hours.

Got to the actual restaurant around 11 and was told that the wait would be about 1.5 hours. Seeing that I was only a party of one, the hostess said that if I sat at the bar, there would be no wait. \\n\\nScore!  I took a seat at the bar - mostly filed with either parties of one or two. Based on the Yelp reviews, I already knew what I was going to get: the fricasse and hopefully save some room for a Belgian waffle. \\n\\nIf you're into coffee, it looks as if Cafe Medina really knows its stuff. The bar serves as the coffee bar and waffle making area. I'm not personally a huge coffee aficionado but it seemed popular here. \\n\\nThe fricasse came out in a cast iron skillet and with a side of foccacia bread. There's all sorts of goodness in the iron skillet. You get two sunny side eggs - fried perfectly so that the yolk is still runny but the bottom of the egg white is slightly crispy and golden yellow around the edges. There are also pieces of boneless short rib that seem to have been slowly cooked because, like all good short rib, it basically melts in your mouth. There are also chunks of roasted potato. The best and probably most interesting touch was the sliced apple slivers that were sprinkled on top of the skillet. It added texture and also contrasted the deep rich savory tastes with something refreshing, simple, and sweet. And a shoutout to the sauce too! I used all of my bread and then asked for another piece to soak that goodness up. \\n\\nThe downside is the price. It's about 17 dollars for your skillet and they also decided to charge me an additional two dollars for the piece of bread. You don't leave super full so I don't think the portion justifies the price. And it's not so unique or refined that the mark up seems worth it. \\n\\nI finished my meal with a waffle. I loved watching them make it here from the bar. I ordered dark chocolate as my dipping side. It was very good - kind of dense and served warm. It's a tiny thing and again comes with a price tag. Even the dipping sauce costs a dollar. These were extremely popular. Almost everyone got one, and everyone was taking pics of the waffle stand on their way out. \\n\\nService: oh so friendly. The baristas and waffle maker were attentive and served me with a smile. Even though they were crazy busy, they took the time to make me feel welcome. \\n\\nBottom line: decent food but comes with a price tag.

American kobe beef was cooked to order (a legitimate medium rare) and topped with brie, caramelized onions, tomato, lettuce, and a homemade sauce.  And while the Magic Shroom burger's meat was noticeably of a lesser quality than the primetime (yet still very good), the toppings are indeed magical.  The field mushrooms would make any burger, but the pesto aioli takes the experience to the subliminal.  I'd strongly suggest seeing if you can substitute the Akaushi beef into the burger.

My girlfriend who has a very high spice level, actually surrendered to its  merciless spice, I made the analogy of her to that dish as zimmerman is to durian...But overall Punjab Palace is a great place and should check out."},{"name":"Mix'D UP Burgers","address":"2371 Hosea L Williams Dr SE, Bldg 3","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"I never thought that I would try Mix'D UP Burgers because I assumed they didn't have a veggie friendly option.

YAY!\\n\\nMy partner and I stopped in on a Friday and placed a to go order. We got the Santa Fe Burger, which is a gluten free black bean burger. It is served with cheese, ancho mayo, and avocado puree. We also ordered some Italian fries, which are their classic french fries with garlic, parmesan cheese, and herbs. Luckily we shared both- the portions are huge. The food was very good and I would recommend checking them out. \\n\\nThe location itself is also a lot nicer looking than the Grant Park location. They have a full bar with both bar and table seating and ample parking in their lot in the back. \\n\\nThe service was meh when I stopped in. It is counter service only, which is fine with me but the person at the register wasn't very warm. Not rude, just kind of not interested in customer service.

We used to be big big customers at their \\"sister\\" restaurant, India Quality (or I think it is related). I politely asked if it was too late to order. The guy kind of teased me in a very polite way about being last minute. After we joked around for a minute he went to talk to someone, came back and took our order. He even said he was dropping it off on his way home! Gosh. I love these people. We were and just got in from a long trip so it really was awesome. We TRIED to call Rangoli first actually to get delivery but they opted out. \\n\\nAnyway... We ordered the vegetarian appetizer platter. Hm. Not as good as India Quality.... tasted re-heated in a microwave--- but I was expecting that so late at night to be honest. If I order again and they're fresher next time I'm giving them 5 stars instead of 4.\\n\\nI ordered Malai Kofta, which is log shaped vegetable and cheese \\"balls\\" with a dense, tender dumpling kind of texture. It was in a creamy sauce that seemed like Korma. I loved it. It was yummy, the flavors stood out, the \\"balls\\" were delicious and it was awesome. I asked for it Mild and it was perfect.\\n\\nWe also ordered Chicken Manchurian... which to be frank was a risky move since the description made it seem almost asian in nature: white meat chicken cooked with garlic, ginger, tomatoes, soy sauce, corn starch and spices. Upon smelling it, it seemed like it could be an indian version of general Gao's chicken, but... thankfully it really wasn't sweet at all. The person who ordered it wanted it spicy and it WAS! They loved it and would order it again. Definitely not typical indian fare but not asian really either. \\n\\nWe also got Chicken Tikka, it was good. A bit heavy on the seasoning, which I personally would have liked, but we ordered it lightly seasoned for the person it was for and he thought it was still rather heavy. Also it was clearly not that fresh--- again our fault. \\n\\nFinally we finished up with some poori. It was supposed to be coconut poori but I couldn't taste it at all. It was really really dense and also didn't taste fresh. It was truly disappointing, but I'm hoping next time its better. And again, if so, 5 stars. \\n\\nThe nan was delicious and generously portioned out. \\n\\nWe also ordered to bottles of soda which arrived cold and refreshing. \\n\\nAll in all, aside from some freshness issues, which I can't help but reiterate, were our fault for ordering at the last minute and ordering fried items without thinking... it was scrumptious and we can't wait to try more unique things on their menu like that chicken manchurian. \\n\\nFor any vegetarian, the malai kofta is a nice change from the usual \\"mixed\\" veggies thrown into whatever sauce your ordering. But note, if you are vegan you'll have to skip it since has cheese in the balls and cream in the sauce. In any case its highly highly recommended if you like the sweeter Korma-like curries."},{"name":"The North End","address":"","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Simply the best.

Sensory overload! They have this incredible patio area with heaters and roll up garage doors that allowed the overflow crowd to spill out. Moving inside, the central feature is a really cool U-shaped bar, where we enjoyed a mojito and a sangria while waiting for our table (less than 30 minutes for 2 on a Friday night). The ambiance in general has that trendy, yet rustic feeling in keeping with many of the other establishments in the area, but still has a unique feeling to it.\\n\\nThe food was great too. We got fried oyster, chorizo, and shrimp tacos, grilled corn, slaw and guacamole, all of which was clearly marked as gluten free of the menu. The three sauces are pretty good, but I don't love it when I only get two bites of a taco and also have to experiment with how much of which sauce needs to go on it. Which brings me to my biggest complaint: portion size! Being admittedly cheap, I found it difficult to pay as much as we did for the tiniest tacos I've ever come across even if the sides were a bit more generous. \\n\\nOverall, I think the quality of the food, the good drinks, the cool atmosphere, and the really friendly service makes this a good bet for a casual dinner."},{"name":"Thierry","address":"1059 Alberni Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"I came here due to a friends' recommendation and was disappointed.

This place gets loud, it's a dull roar with all the conversations and it can get hard to hear someone.  \\n\\nDrink menu is a mix of beers, wine and cocktails.  The cocktails were fairly well crafted and were good (I enjoyed my Smoke).  The food menu is a mix of daily fish (nigiri or sashimi specials), a regular sushi section, hand rolls and plates.  Though having a predominantly sushi based menu, I really didn't feel that this place was as much of a sushi restaurant than it was a Pacific Asian restaurant that had sushi.  \\n\\nWe tried an assortment of things: madai, kurodai, nama hotate, handrolls (negi hama, ume shiso, crab butter), marinated yellowtail, soft shell crab, wagyu rib eye.  [Side note:  if you get in later in the evening - be prepared for them to be out of dishes - as we discovered].  Overall, the experience was pleasant.  The nigiri pieces were good, with the nama hotate being the standout.  Crab butter handrolls were good. The ume shiso is good if you like the really sour/tart bite of the ume - if not, this is definitely not your roll.  Personally, I felt the strength of the restaurant was in the prepared plates.  The Marinated Yellowtail was well done, as was the Soft Shell Crab.

The chain?! \\n\\nWell, credit to Bertucci's then for going to the lengths required to meet these standards set down by the true geniuses of pizza - the Neapolitans. After all, it was the Naples folk who took the ancient Greeks'  flat-bread with herbs and cheese pizzas and started adding the exotic new fruit ' the tomato' back in the 1700s. Suddenly pizza was THE thing and the world's first and oldest pizzeria still stands there now and is nearing 200 years-old.\\n\\nSo what ARE the standards of 'The Associazione'?\\nApparently.. \\"the pizza must be baked in a wood-fired, domed oven at 485C for no more than 60 to 90 seconds; the base must be hand-kneaded and must not be rolled with a pin or prepared by any mechanical means and the pizza must not exceed 35 cm in diameter or be more than a third of a cm thick at the centre.\\" They also only recognise marinara and margherita as acceptable pizzas.

Anyway, I get to the cashier and order the Llano Poblano - it was noisy enough that I had to repeat myself 3 times before she got it.  And, look - firstly, I'm Italian.  Secondly, I'm from Pittsburgh, PA originally.  I'm fickin' LOUD and people are always telling me to be quiet, so I know it wasn't me being mousey.  I don't know that there's much they could do about this aside from relocating the cashiers.\\n\\nSo, you place your order and get a number.  The theory is that another host/hostess will put that number on one of the tables in the front and you have to go find it.  This is not an easy task when 80% of the tables are full, and in all honesty just not a very good system.  Not a huge issue overall though - I just asked the hostess.  However, it even took her a minute to find the table even though she had put the number there less than 3 minutes before.  They could use tablet pcs or something to help keep themselves organized.  I'm sure the turnaround is relatively fast and they're putting numbers on tables like mad, so I get the mild confusion, but the restaurant should do something to help them organize and make this flow better.\\n\\nThe burger was delivered a bit faster than I would have expected, which is good.  Overall, with everything that was on this burger, I was expecting a veritable explosion of flavor.  Didn't happen.  the burger itself was damned tasty - plenty of good beef flavor, but look, poblanos have a ton of flavor (not heat, but flavor) and I couldn't really taste it at all against the burger, which is a damned shame because it would have really complemented the beef.  Chipotle mayo?  I wish.  I think they waved a chipotle at a 5 gallon tub of mayo.  The fries were better than expected - good level of seasoning and a decent level of crispness.\\n\\nNow, look, I'm not saying the burger was bad - overall it was definitely headed in the right direction.  I was just a bit disappointed that what sounded mouthwateringly good actually came across as \\"better than most, but not earth shattering\\".\\n\\nEven though it's comparatively a sh*t-hole, I would go to Your Mom's first, although with just a bit of tightening up their order/seating flow and tweaking the burger ingredients a bit hopdoddy could easily shoot to the top.\\n\\nI should also note that I couldn't connect to their wi-fi - couldn't get an IP address.\\n\\n***EDIT***\\n\\nBeen back a few more times and I do have to say that my subsequent ventures were much better than my first.

No greeting and when we asked her to take a photo of us, she gave us a rude face, but took the photo. Since we always like to share, we asked if the $40 filet mingon could be spilt two ways for two different styles: medium and rare. The waitress\\nwas so rude and told us that it can't be done, as she blamed it on the chef. She didn't even ask him? So\\n what she suggested is that we get it rare and then cut it at the table and\\nreturn it to the chef for more cooking?? Seems like a hassle  and a waste of time for a late dinner and a hunger customer, right?  We acted very nice and didn't make\\n a scene because we never do so that the wait staff doesn't spit in our\\nfood. We held our disappointment for this review, so we agreed to her suggestion. It was  terrible\\nservice, if you pay $40 for a small piece of meat, I think the Chef can\\n definitely accommodate your requests be it anything the customer wants! That is what a good company does. \\nAlso, my friend asked for a meat sauce which the waitress brings over late and after poor girl had to return her meat to be cooked more, the waitress bring it\\n FROZEN?

The beer list is still quite wonderful. And it is a whiskey joint after all, seems unfair to criticise the beer list. \\n\\nWe started with the Blue Cheese and Bacon potato chips and it quickly became a favourite. I've never really been a fan of Blue Cheese, but my love of bacon won me over. It was incredible. The blue cheese fondue was, quite simply, creamy perfection. And the bacon...oooh bacon. We're not talking breakfast strips. There are big, crouton sized chucks. I will be definitely having it again. \\n\\nAs for our meals, I had the happy hour Pulled Pork Sandwich and it lived up to the standard set by the appetizer. The BBQ sauce is tangy and sweet and the slaw that is on it is the perfect compliment to bring that tang to the forefront. There was enough sauce so that the sandwich was not even remotely dry, but not so much that the bun becomes soggy and falls apart.\\n\\nMy girlfriend went off the happy hour menu and got a couple of Put Ups.

He ordered the classic with fries and I had the Janis Joplin with fries. The Janis is their veggie burger option and is a pretty flimsy patty topped with avocado, some sprouts, cheddar, tomato, white onion, and possibly something else I am forgetting. As veggie burgers are wont to do, it basically fell apart into mush after just a few bites. I gladly would have picked it back up, pieced it together, and proceeded to eat it except it just wasn't that great. Definitely not worth the extra effort. \\n\\nAs for my meat-eating companion, he prefers his burgers less rare than what their (monstrous) kitchen is serving up. Now, this isn't by any means the fault of Hopdoddy (it just happens to be my friend's preference) but it seems like they could at least prompt the customer upon ordering to specify how they would like the cow cooked.\\n\\nThe fries were perhaps a 7 out of10. Good flavor, cut thinly, but a bit too short, lukewarm, and soggy. A waitress brought out some chipotle ketchup before we were even brought any of our food. It was a nice take on the classic.\\n\\nThe overall atmosphere is laidback and friendly and I really appreciate the emphasis on local ingredients and eco-friendly products (though I also appreciate the irony of using disposable eco-friendly products...but that's a review for something else entirely). The service was friendly but not by any means prompt. They seemed to have a whole army of hopdoddians milling around, cleaning the incredibly sticky apothecary jar full of pickles (like the jar, didn't like the mess), busing tables as if lives depended on it, and so on, yet only one person taking orders??\\n\\nI would go back, perhaps, at the request of others, but I won't be initiating any further trips.

I got the wings, which were ok (breaded and a little soggy, but the sauces are good). The guy behind the bar made an amazing Bloody Mary and passed out samples. It was fantastic, and I don't normally like them.  Well drinks were about $8 apiece which is a little more than I expected.

My mid-20's birthday came up and my parents convinced me to try this place out.  I was excited as I have heard only good things about this place, but small plates?  Ingredients that I've never heard of?  Wine pairings?  This is an alien world to me, and I could only prepare not to embarrass myself.\\n\\n== Begin ranting ==\\nI made a reservation for two for the chef's tasting menu in the typical Barley-Swine-take-the-wheel fashion.  It's overly harsh that failing to cancel chef's tasting reservations less than 24 hours before will result in a $50 fine per person.  Their website also mentioned that this fine will turn into a credit on your next visit, but I called and apparently that's just not the case.  All that being said, do make a reservation, cause if you haven't heard, this place is pretty popular.\\n\\nOh, parking is also a pain.  It was a rainy night and I did myself a favor and just did the complimentary valet.  A $100 fine is on the line, and I'm not going to be 15 minutes late because I was stubborn and parked 3 blocks away.\\n\\nOkay, ranting done.  On the to the fantastic part of the night.\\n==\\n\\nProtip: get a counter table with a view of the kitchen.  My first experience of dinner with a kitchen view was at Sway, and it was incredible.  Tonight was no different.  The hustle and bustle of the kitchen was mesmerizing as the chef shouts out the order and the different stations work in complete harmony.  Every time the grill emits flames and sears the meat, my face also gets a (much lighter) wave of heat.\\n\\nPrices: I'm not sure how often the chef's tasting menu changes, but tonight's was a 10-course menu at $90 per person with a $55 wine/beer pairing.  The wine/beer pairing was optional and can be shared.  Might as well go all out.\\n\\nAttire: This place serves one of the most fancy dishes I've ever been to.  Behind me, a man in a nice dress shirt.  Yet, just a seat down, you see someone in a T-shirt, jeans, and a backwards baseball cap.  Only in Austin.\\n\\nAppetizers consists of the first four dishes.  The Beet cured mackerel with pandan was delicious and the best appetizer of the group.  The mackerel sashimi had wonderful texture and wasn't overpowered by the blanket of beet.  Also one of the more colorful dishes.  The meat of the Ember roasted squash tasted great and with a soft texture.  The \\"barbeque sauce\\"-like topping was a bit heavy though.  A much thinner layer would've been more preferable for me.\\n\\nThe next four dishes were the entrees.  The Red shrimp, cauliflower, calamondin came first and was definitely the biggest WOW factor of the night.  The shrimp meat had an excellent snap and the center was almost raw.  So incredibly delicious!  The Dry-aged (35-ish days) Akaushi ribeye was a close close second, and my mouth is salivating as I pull that dish from my memory.  Just look at my picture of it; ugh so tender and delicious.  The beef broth it sat in was refreshing, and the seeded loaf was also pretty interesting as it was dense, but flavorful being cooked in beef fat.  The Pork belly dish that came after was my least favorite.  I felt that there was too many components in this dish that I was mostly confused on what I was tasting.  It just felt that there was no obvious main ingredient.\\n\\nThe final two dishes were the desserts.  The Pine panna cotta, beet, grapefruit dish was extremely refreshing and felt like eating an icy sorbet.  Finally, the chocolate ganache was the perfect dish to end the night: heavy, yet portioned perfectly.\\n\\nI definitely recommend the chef's tasting.  it takes the work away from you, and honestly, I never would have even considered ordering six of the ten dishes I had tonight, and that would've been a huge shame and loss for me.  The service was wonderful and knowledgeable of all the dishes and pairings.

This location is closest to my home and the one I frequent most often.  Time and time again I leave feeling disappointed and this is not how I should feel leaving my favorite restaurant.  In the past three months I've eaten at the Polaris Barn and Grill, the Gahanna Location, and had the lunch buffet at the 5th Avenue Location.  With the except of the waitress at the 5th Avenue location forgetting to bring us our drinks the food and service have been exceptional while the service and food at Sawmill has been disappointing.  \\n\\nProbably two months ago my entire meal at Sawmill was free.  I never complained once, never said a thing, and would have gladly paid supporting this local business, but it took over an hour for our food to come out on a night that wasn't busy in the least.  I think that the fact my two toddlers were hungry and getting upset is what tipped them off that they were dropping the ball.  The server just came out at one point and told us everything was on the house, I declined since I was afraid they would take it out of the servers check when it was clearly not his fault.  He assured me they wouldn't, and I made the manager assure me of the same thing before accepting the comped meal.\\n\\nWe were eating here just the other night and I realized what the problem is...they must have to pay too much rent for the Premium Sawmill location and can't afford to hire as many servers as they need or bus boys at all.  We were here during prime meal time, arriving just in time to order half price appetizers.  Our server was swamped and running around like crazy.  He was even forced to bus his own tables, heck, even the hostess was busing tables while the bearded manager was delivering food.  What kind of crap is that?  Who does the schedule here?  My drink, premium priced lemonade at $2.99, sat empty for more than 40 minutes...my biggest pet peeve--having an empty glass for a long time.  I need something to drink while I eat.  I pretty much only got one refill, I need to take one from my wife's page and always order a water with another drink.  \\n\\nThe chef who's picture is now on a huge poster as soon as you walked in, also dropped the ball and overcooked my wings which had basically no sauce, served old looking celery with it, and watery blue cheese.  The one thing he did get right was the onion rings.  Since this location opened they can't cook the onion rings properly, they are almost always too battery and dripping with grease vs. crispy and cooked such as the way I was introduced to the amazing side at the original Linworth location over a decade ago.  Perfect on the onion rings, these are famous to my friends and family so I was very pleased that something was done right.  We also had pigskins and as always they are to die for, Applebee's and Friday's Potato Skins have jealousy issues when it comes to these king of the hill onion rings.  \\n\\nBut this was the last straw, time after time, problem after problem.  Whether it's the service or the food being prepared wrong or poorly, waiting 5 or 10 minutes for someone to great you when you arrive, or making you wait 15 minutes to get a seat in an empty house there is always something wrong at this location and it seems to be the norm.\\n\\nI hope Hoggy's management takes these Yelp and Urbanspoon reviews seriously.  Look around, Hoggy's isn't doing so well in Columbus especially on Yelp.  These website can drive a ton of business too or away from their restaurants.  I know when I go to somewhere unfamiliar or if I\\"m looking for something new or good I look on Yelp and it never lets me down.  If Hoggy's would stop letting its fans down then I think Yelp would bring it some new business. \\n\\nAnyway, next time I eat at Hoggy's I will probably go to the Polaris location as I know that they do well and I've never had a problem there.  I might try the original Linworth location that has reopened...haven't been there since it closed, but one thing is for sure I am done with the Sawmill location, I can see it closing like the once beloved Grove City location."},{"name":"Milestones Restaurants","address":"2425 Cambie St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"2.5","text":"It has been quite a while since I stepped into a Milestones and the latest promotion convinced us to return: 3 Course Meal for $25.

Returning just often enough, it's amicable and respectful service. \\n\\nNow on to the Pastry Donuts of Prophecy, and they're just about alright, and definitely suited for a sweet tooth. The location has a pub feeling, and with a good paired drink, would probably be great; on its own however, and it's simply a rush of sugar and no leveling off until after you crash. If you really want a good treat, and have a mostly empty stomach, definitely sample different flavors and find what suits you the best, as they have a LARGE variety. \\n\\nOverall, the visit here is worth the experience, the ability to say, \\"Yeah, I went to Gourdoughs!\\" Youll make your friends from all around Texas jealous. Is it going to be your bragging point for years to come? Maybe not, but you won't forget it when the situation arises."},{"name":"Gus's World Famous Fried Chicken","address":"117 San Jacinto Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I'm not a fan of spicy food but my husband is. This is what led us to get Gus' while we were visiting Austin. I have to say, the chicken was delicious. The coating was just right. The chicken was tender and juicy without being greasy (which was likely due in part to the use of peanut oil in frying). For the cost, the portions were appropriate, especially the amount provided for the sides, even substituting fried okra for the beans. \\n\\nMy only complaints are a rather limited kids' menu (per our server, the chicken on the kid's menu is still spicy) and a rather underwhelming decor. \\n\\nStill, it was worth the short trip from our hotel to experience some good, authentic food."},{"name":"La Mongerie Bakery & Bistro","address":"265 Ponce De Leon","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"If I could subtract stars, I would.

I'm currently going through a period of coconut-pie obsession, so when I saw Schmidt's had it, I was a little freaky-elated to chomp down a few bites. \\n\\nSad face. It tasted like sugar with a consistency of pudding/elmers glue. A few flakes of coconut (nothingness) roamed the Crustland. The coconut flavor was nowhere to be found, possibly out for the evening getting drunk at a karaoke bar. Not sure... I was eating a sad sugar pie, and it wasn't even that good at all. \\n\\nNote to readers!: A few days after this German-eating escapade, I learned from a lady at another homemade-pie-bakery establishment that Schmidt's uses homemade pudding in their CCPs (coconut cream pies). They make up the pudding on the stove and dump in the coconut shreds while the pudding's still hot. What's wrong with that? The heat essentially draws out the coconut flavor, and your left with, um, not much. You get the gist. \\n\\nThe meat was good. Well, the plain brat, that is. Coupled that with a scoop of their homemade chunky applesauce (this had a good apple taste, hints of tart confirmed it's made from scratch), and With those two items, my stomach was satisfied.

We checked out the restaurant website in advance and saw several items that we liked, and noticed the existence of a bar food menu that looked interesting. \\n\\nUpon arrival, the space looked great, but it wasn't too busy. We quickly went up to the bar and found a couple seats. We reviewed the bar menu, which was a bit pricey; drinks ranged from about $12-16 and were good, but not worth that price. We asked for the bar food menu available online, but the bartender informed us that there is no bar menu, and the dinner menu is the only option. This was disappointing, as we weren't starving and wanted some smaller plates. We noticed that they provided a restaurant week dinner menu, which contained some of the items shown on the dinner menu on the website. We asked if we could order certain of these items a la carte without ordering the full restaurant week menu, and we were told that we couldn't, which was really annoying. The only item I really wanted required that I pay $38 and also select a salad and dessert, neither of which I wanted.\\n\\nUltimately, our entrees were very good. I ordered the short rib, which was a bit fatty, but the chef allowed for some customization of the sides. My wife ordered from the restaurant week menu, and she loved her burratini, but she found it disappointingly small. She also loved the pasta bolognese, which was a good portion and delicious. After bringing us the wrong dessert, they replaced with the correct one, which was uninspired and a strange combo of textures, with sticky caramel corn atop panna cotta and cherries. Not our favorite. \\n\\nOverall, the food was pretty good, but I would have liked to see more flexibility to offer food as advertised by the website and more dedication to our experience."},{"name":"Hopdoddy Burger Bar","address":"1400 S Congress Ave, Ste A190","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I literally love this burger bar.

Honestly, all the burgers are amazing (Llano Poblano is another good one) and can be subbed with a black bean patty if you prefer a vegetarian burger. The lines to get in are long if you go at regular lunch and dinner hours however you can order a shake while waiting in line and they also offer cucumber lemon water. The only complaint I have is that the burgers are small. It's the perfect amount for me however, it's not enough for a guy.

The only reason I am giving it any stars is because are server was so good and we liked her so much. I have been here maybe 5 times over the last 15 years and the experience has always been the same. Hosts suck, management sucks,  kitchen sucks, server is awesome but has too many tables. You would think at some point they would realize that this location is always busy and properly staff it but I guess they figure because of the location getting so much traffic they don't have to provide good food or service. They don't need your business and it shows.\\n\\nHere is the plan, birthday dinner at Hooters for my stepson so he can watch the UFC fight and eat buffalo shrimp and hot wings. \\n\\nI called ahead to try and make a reservation because this location is always busy and the woman on the phone was not friendly, I wouldn't say rude but she had a \\"we don't need your business\\" attitude, I then asked about preferred seating which they don't do, I then asked if they did anything for birthdays, which she said they didn't do. I then asked what the wait currently was, she told me 45 minutes, I asked if I could be added to the wait and then I could walk down from my hotel. She said no, I had to be there in person. Then I asked if I could walk down and put my name on the list and walk with the kids and come back, she said no \\"I had to be sitting there waiting\\" At this point if my stepson didn't want to go to hooters and see the UFC fight for his birthday dinner we wouldn't have gone but I love the kid so I snatched my littlest one up and walked from the Marriott by myself with the baby, through downtown (which was crowded due to a concert so I felt safe enough) to the Hooters to get put on the list so the bigger kids could enjoy the pool a little longer. Once I added my name to the list, He asked how old each child was and then I asked if I could wait outside (I was concerned because I was told I had to be right there waiting on the phone) the gentleman told me just to \\"come back in 30 minutes\\", which if I had been told I was able to do that on the phone I would have waited on the rest of my family before walking down. \\n\\nWe got seated a little quicker than they said, mostly because other parties left. I think people were putting their names on the list at more than one place and then going wherever they got in first. They sat us at a high top table and put a booster seat on a chair for my baby. Luckily the servers here are better than any other section of the FOH or BOH staff and quickly cleaned off a lower table and got us a highchair. It took our server a few minutes to get to us but she came by at let us know she got 3 tables all at once and that she would be right there. She was wonderful and once she got caught up everything she did was on point after that. Truly beautiful professional woman, she looked like Haley Berry. I wish I could remember her name. Bathrooms were nasty, no changing table, trash cans overfull, bad smell. The big complaint is that we came to see the UFC fight at 10pm, which they touted on their website and facebook as a special event. Only after waiting over 30 minutes to be seated and having placed our food order did we find out that the UFC fight was only being shown on a tiny patio with smoking, so the kids couldn't watch the fight and my husband didn't want to see the fight bad enough to go out with the smoking WHICH IS WHY WE PICKED A NON-SMOKING VENUE. Food came out and was the right food but most of it was crappy, fries cold, fried foods mushy but we just wanted to eat and get out at this point so we didn't complain. No manager every came by.

I did come on a weekday for lunch though, so maybe it's usually busier.  As soon as you walk in, you get that local Bostonian vibe and it feels welcoming.  \\n\\nService was sort of slow.  What's nice is that you can order half and half pizzas if you're sharing with someone and don't want to order two separate pizzas.  I got the meat lover's pizza (cheese, pepperoni, sausage, and ground beef) and my sister got the vegetarian option for her half.  \\n\\nThey must've driven out to the farms to get fresh milk from the cows then come back to freshly make the cheese, because that's how long it felt before we got our food.

We had reservations and was seated at a table near the bar. The place was not too hectic considering it was a Friday evening at 8:00 PM. Our waitress came over with menus and made a few recommendations for cocktails. I am a fan of sangria a but didn't get one because I am on a no sugar diet so I passed. My friend got a Jack Abby. Drinks took a while to come but they eventually made its way to our table. \\n\\nWe ordered the steak and cheese egg-roll for an app and for entrees, the filet and the short rib. Twenty minutes later, our entrees were delivered but our app was no where to be seen.  The person offered to take out entrees to be held in back but we were not going to have our steaks under a warmer while they made us our app. To compromise, we told him to cancel the egg rolls and replace with a Caesar salad thinking a salad would be quick. We also ordered another beer. We started on the entree and neither the salad not the second beer ever came. The waitress walked by us a dozen times and never once refilled our water. \\n\\nWhen we were done, she finally shows up and as she was picking up out empty plates, commented that she liked to see empty plates. It took every ounce of restraint on my part not to blurt out that we were so hungry since we didn't get our app or salad. \\n\\nAnother waitress came to refill my water and I could not help but asked her to send over the manager. It took the manager about 10 minutes to make his way to our table and we told him what happened. It is always awkward to complain but it was even worse when a very tall guy is standing over your table while doing so. I get he had no control of his height but he could have knelt and be more at our eye level when we were talking.  \\n\\nHe offers us a free beer but we refused because we didn't complain to get a free beer or anything else. He leaves to figure out the disconnect and came back with our check along with two coupons for free apps ( with the purchase of entrees, so not really free). \\n\\nPeople often go to certain restaurants for the food as well as an expected level of service and this place definitely fell short on service. Food was ok but the service left a very sour taste in our mouths. \\n\\nNot once did the waitress come over to apologize for the lack of service and lack of what we ordered.

This is more of a lunch place and by the look of all the Hispanic speakers, very popular with that crowd. I'd rate this as slightly above fast food - more like what you would receive at Willy's or other lunch-counter order places with better quality ingredients and minimal service.\\n\\nLas Tortas translated means something like \\"cake\\" or \\"pie\\" and it's apparently slang for a sandwich - perhaps something a bit foreign to many Latino cultures. These sandwiches remind me a bit of the famous Cuban pork/ham sandwich of which I'm a huge fan. We hit this location (a group of 6 or so) during lunch - there was already a line forming up at the counter where you order - the menu is on a board above the counter. Roughly divided into: Tortas Sencillas, Flautas, Tortas Especiales, Tortas Combinadas, Tortas Locas, Tacos, Burritos and Pambazos. We tried a variety of items to get a feel for the place, most things on the menu are super cheap.\\n\\nWe started off with a fairly decent horchata - if you haven't tried one of these rice-based drinks with vanilla, cinnamon and milk, they're basically the equivalent of a milkshake, with less cold.

Well I am a big fan of the bavarian creme or the boston creme. A real good bear claw or apple fritter never hurt anyone. Although the waist line may be affected. Let me be frank, to me the all time best donut place in the Portland area is Joe Donuts on the way up to Mt Hood. If there is a line you know its open. \\nI am not a fan of the multi topping Voodoo Donuts. If I wanted the topping I would go for the topping and forget the donut. \\nBlue Star concentrates on the donuts. The quality and the quantity. I don't know why but recently going into a donut shop is like going into a shop on the East Side of the Berlin Wall. Small selection and all spread out to make it look like there is a lot of quantity. \\nBlue Star always seems to have both and are always making more. To me that sends the message of freshness. I like when others have them delivered early in the morning, I dont like when they dont have the ability to continue making them. It doesnt give me the odor of baking and increase the pleasure senses like smelling a fresh rack coming out of the oven. I want flavor in the donut not on top of it. Blue Star delivers. Price is an issue. It cant be a normal stop. $3-4-5 a donut is a little out of control but if you want the specialty flavor I guess the market demand is there."},{"name":"Ristorante Serena","address":"18 Lebanon St","city":"Malden","stars":"4.5","text":"My wife and I went here for dinner tonight.

Excited to have multiple restaurants within easy biking distance.\\n\\nI ordered the Lamb Burger, aka, the ROCKIN' HERO and classic fries. I was asked how I wanted my burger cooked. I said \\"medium.\\" My burger was decidedly overcooked and incredibly dry, which is such a shame with lamb. My shoe-string fries, while seasoned nicely, were soggy and mediocre. My significant other ordered a black-bean burger. It was decent, but also dry and underwhelming. We both agreed that the buns used for the burgers were too large and dry and overshadowed the patty, which to me, is a mistake for a place specializing in burgers. Maybe their style just isn't mine.\\n\\nWe each ordered a single beer with our meal, and the total came to $47 rounded up including 18% gratuity, which I believe was the only option besides none and 20% gratuity, when checking out. You are not waited on at your table. This is an order at the counter, go sit down with a number, have your food brought to you, serve-yourself (drinks, condiments, etc.) establishment.

Fries lukewarm. Classic burger lukewarm to the extent that the bun almost seemed a little stale around the edge.  Beef patty was standard thickness and texture for higher end burgers, but seemed dry and lacking flavor.  I guess it really really needed cheese.  Vegetable toppings were lean, and there was not enough interesting sauce to give it any positive sensation.  In contrast, I have never ever been disappointed by a burger or piping hot fries at In and Out, P Terry's, or Mighty Fine.  \\n\\nThe only positive things I can say are that the ambience is hip, the beer was served in a frozen glass, the queue hostess was great, and the service seemed decent, expect for what I imagine was the server leaving my order sit for too long after it was ready to go.  With that said, I'm not completely averse to another shot here with a completely different type of burger, as the choices do look appealing, but the prospect of waiting in a long line to get served tepid fries may temper that urge.

As a lover of great trailer food in town, I became a fan of Chef Bryce Gilmore's Odd Duck. When I heard that they were going to open up another restaurant in 78704 and that the concept was to be a gastropub, I was excited. This new place is called Barley Swine and I'm not going to mess about: It's epic. Featuring an ever-changing menu that combines rustic ingredients from local farms, they also have a focus on local craft brewers. I had a chance to visit with Jason and talk about this perfect upscale gastropub and he said I'd be in for a treat. Let's elaborate a little.\\n\\nThey're located on South Lamar, just north of Oltorf, so I can practically walk there from my house. When you walk in the door, you immediately catch a whiff of pork creations coming from the kitchen. This is always a great way to welcome me into your place. The restaurant itself is small, yet intimate in the right way. Tall tables with high-back stools are the seating around six positions. To the left is the bar that stares directly into the open kitchen. I love that. It's inviting and enticing when your guests get to see the magic happening in the kitchen. Dishes are best shared among friends and I recommend just ordering everything and passing plates around the table.\\n\\nOnce we were seated, I quickly ordered a pint and studied the menu. At this point, i was anxious to get a taste of everything they had to offer. Take the time to enjoy a sampling of most of the menu and order a few pints. As you can expect from me, I started off by ordering the pork belly. It was perfectly grilled and served with pickled mushrooms & celery root pur√©e. It was just crisp enough on the outside yet succulent and tender on the inside. Next up were sweetbreads with a light garlic pur√©e, almonds, Brussels sprouts & bacon. The flavor profile was impressive and brought together a brilliant blend of the elements. In this first round of ordering, we also enjoyed the fried Brussels sprouts with lemon & capers. I'm really on a kick for these sprouts lately and these babies didn't disappoint. Just the right crispy texture and not overly seasoned.\\n\\nAnother pint was ordered and so was a second round of dishes. This one started off with beer braised rabbit stew with barley, chard, carrots & grits. If you're going to call yourself a gastropub, you have to offer a proper stew and this one was perfect. It was rustic, hearty and delicious. We went ahead and ordered another dose of the pork belly too. It was that good. The finale was the apple and foie stuffed grilled quail with red cabbage. Wow. Just wow. This dish was the perfect way to complete the feast.\\n\\nI was fortunate to experience a place that instantly goes up in my top five restaurants. It was that good. To take the chance on opening up a gastropub in Austin, Texas of all places, you have to be great. Barley Swine is just that. I was blown away by the ambiance, the service experience and most importantly the food. I kid you not, Gordon Ramsay would approve of such an establishment.\\n\\nMake the time to pay them a visit and prepare yourself to be impressed.

This guy has definitely shosen the wrong job, bless his heart.  But he seemed really mean so we were reluctant to say anything.\\n\\nNow on to the food.  We were a group of 3.  We started with the fried pickles and fried oysters.  Both were simply divine.  I had never had a fried pickle before and really trhought it was just a gimmick,but they were really really really delish.  It's a sweet pickle chip (maybe a bread and butter chip?) in a tempura batter and then flash fried.  The sweetness of the pickle juxtaposes marvelously against the crispy fried crust.  Serious, people.  Get this appetizer.  It's good.  The fried oyster app was equally delish and could easily have served as my meal.  The oysters are dredged in polenta and then fried.  They were perfectly crisp and were topped with some kind of red pimento concoction (hint of sweet) that paired beautifully with the brine of the oysters.\\n\\nFor the entree, I got the There burger, one of us got the bison burger, and one of us got the housemade sausages.  Everyone was delighted. My There burger was made of the most flavorful beef I've ever had in a burger.  The owner stopped by and told us it was made of ground up short rib.

Much, much better - especially on the weekends, which is when I tend mostly to eat here.  Even one of my favorites, the mac n' cheese (gouda) has somehow gotten better with better melting of the cheese.\\n\\nThe biggest improvement to note since my last review is they have changed the service a bit, evidently paying attention to some other reviews.  At least on the weekend there is now a hostess who help facilitate better attention to the diners from the rest of the staff, good addition.  Also the [free] mimosas on the weekend have gotten significantly better - to the point where I really only want one or two if I hope to walk straight on the way home.\\n\\nStill room for improvement with regard to some rather simple things, making sure guests get water refills and checked up on frequently enough, but excellent progress and the new specials menu is a great idea.\\n\\n---\\n\\nI live right by this bistro (I suppose it is called a bakery but I have yet to try their desserts yet, I hear they are delicious and fully anticipate once I've tried them I will agree).  I have eaten here now three times and I want to emphasize more than anything that I agree with pretty much every post that I have been able to read for La Mongerie on Yelp.  The food is delicious, well-prepared and I have no complaints to register along those lines.  Their mac 'n cheese, furthermore, is something you should know about ahead of time - it is absolutely fantastic (Gouda), but it is also something you should only indulge in every now and then as I am sure the amount of cheese will give your cardiologist reason to protest.  They also offer a 10% discount as far as I have eaten here for residents of the Camden properties.\\n\\nThe downsides, unfortunately, are also exactly what people have listed here - I, too, have noticed the berries that once adorned my water glass are becoming more hit-or-miss or randomly distributed.  It's an elegant touch, honestly, for such a cozy place - but it only raises eyebrows to have them yanked and then suddenly reimplemented again.\\n\\nThe larger complaint, which is more prevalently cited here, is the service.  It is not that anyone is rude or that I have any incorrect orders - it is just terribly slow.  I was actually the only table at one point during a recent visit and it took at least 12 minutes to pay my bill.  As this is a potential lunch spot for me and others in Midtown, they could use to make service/turnaround much faster (even appreciating that everything is \\"made-to-order\\" - the food time was OK) so that local professionals don't feel the need to run back to the office.\\n\\n...\\n\\nLong story short, the management should really push their employees for better service because they really have a lot going for them and could make a killing in this location... or they could just as easily let this one get away from them.  Here's hoping some changes are put in place, I love the food.

The sangria had a tang that the wife found off-flavored.  This being the reason for 4 stars and not a perfect 5.

I got a lamb dish that was definitely in the top 5 lamb dinners I've ever had.  The Cordero tradicional.  Encrusted with a mashed pistachio/plaintain mixture that held in the juices and added to the flavor.  It was also served with the same salad that came with the empanada.

However, they're mostly ambitious. The storefront is just like any other donut shop with a few window seating, self-serve water or coffee, and sometimes free samples. I love the social media chalkboard wall at the top of the back wall, but I'm amazed they don't have Yelp! on the list. Again, those are points for decor and just something I haven't seen at other cafes or restaurants before. \\n\\nMy favorite donuts are the blueberry bourbon basil and the marionberry pepper jam with peanut butter powder. You can taste each component in each donut, which is rare in most multi-flavored donuts and they each work well together. Neither are too sweet or too rich, which I love. \\n\\nIf you REALLY love passion fruit (and you really really have to love it), there's the passion fruit cocoa nib donut. Although i didn't like it because it was too much passion fruit in one sitting, but I mention it because it was unique. It's a rich tart and sweet passion fruit with cacao nibs to balance the sweetness.  \\n\\nPricing wise, the donuts are a bit more than your usual mom and pop shop, but the foot traffic is nonstop. It's easy to spend $20+ on a box of donuts and is actually an easier way to share donuts with friends without stuffing yourself with one type of donut.

I was a fan of almost everything except for the broccoli, it wasn't charred at all, it was steamed at most and still very soggy. For dessert, we ordered some kind of chocolate crepe dish (sorry, I have no idea what the name is).

Not only that, but they were happy to do it. The food came out impressively fast. My favorites were the patatas bravas, truffle bikini and jamon and manchego croquettes - probably because they all had the garlic aioli (of which I was obviously a huge fan).

Truly the best burger I've ever had, and the boyfriend thinks so too.  \\n   Luckily, we arrived right at 5PM.  Too late for the lunch and right before the dinner crowd hits.  When we sat down with our burgers the line was just started to get long so perfect timing.  Since we had never been it was a little confusing at first but there are waiters there to direct you on how everything works and where to go so no big deal.  I had a Goodnight Burger and the BF had the Terlingua Burger (essentially a Frito pie on the burger), and both were absolutely amazing.  We also split an order of Kennebec fries with the truffle sauce.  The fries were really tasty, nice and crispy and potato-ey.  The sauce was good, but I think I enjoyed the free condiments better.  They have ketchup, chipotle ketchup, bbq sauce, and honey mustard.  I'm pretty sure they make them all in house.  Really good, especially the bbq and honey mustard.  The bun is super fresh and baked there on site.  You can choose from an egg bun or whole wheat but we both went with the egg on the first time around.  I'll try the wheat bun on another visit.  The meat is juicy and tasty and everything added to the burger is a perfect complement.  If you are looking for a giant hamburger patty this isn't the place for you.  This is a place for quality over quantity.  They use local ingredients and make as many things fresh and in house as they can.  As for price, I found them to be pretty reasonable, especially for the quality you receive.  I'd much rather have a quality burger with delicious complements to it over a giant patty on an old crappy bun any day.  Two burgers, an order of fries, a fountain drink (the fountain drinks are all made with real cane sugar), and one bottled beer was around $30.  We wanted to try the Tres Leches shake but knew after seeing one come out that there would be no way we could finish it.  I've tried a lot of burgers but this one was the best tasting one overall.  Everything on it is meant to complement the overall taste.  You don't taste any one thing just a biteful of total awesomeness in every single bite.  I finished mine even before the bf did.

Just about everything here is made from scratch, and it all screams \\"quality.\\"\\n\\nThere are a variety of burgers here, ranging from the classic (very good) to the Ahi Tuna burger (which is also very good, but frankly, consists of ingredients that I'd much rather enjoy separately than combined into a burger).  However, the star of the show is the Magic Shroom. This burger is simply sublime. This combination of beef, goat cheese, pesto, and wild field mushrooms sounds odd at first, but it is a truly unique flavor that is not to be missed.  If you have no other reason to try Hopdoddy, try it for this.\\n\\nThe fries are also homemade, and come sprinkled with a salt/herb mixture.  They are good even when cold, which is a difficult feat.  I recommend pairing them with the chili cheese sauce, which has a flavor that is difficult to describe, but unique and delicious all the same.\\n\\nAre there cons to all these pros? Just a few minor ones.  It's loud, and the cool glass-and-concrete building design serves as a nice amplifier to the volume level.  It doesn't particularly bother me, but for some it might.

It's what any aspiring \\"great\\" restaurant must have in both food presentation and ambiance to be successful. BJs has both. Love a place that has a splashiness about it? Tell you one thing...it was packed pre-lunch hour. That tell you anything. It certainly falls under the same category as the old saying about what separates a good Chinese restaurant from a poor one. If there's a line outside waiting to get in the food must be aces. No line at BJs put the joint was jumping with celebratory and business-oriented (I suppose) conversation. The open bar is all the way open. Just enter and look to your right. In the right spirit for spirits? A colorful array of beer and booze enablers await you. After hearing my mother brag about the quality of the food on more than one occasion I had to make a point of stopping by. That's a use of at liberty time any Veteran's Day holiday observer would be proud of. The only places I can recall being this inviting from an interior standpoint would have to be Dave & Buster's and Pappadeaux's. They spare no expense to roll out the full red carpet of culinary enticements. The decor whets your whistle for what you'll soon be ordering. There's a long aisle full of booth space. You'll even notice candelabras off to the left. \\nOnward and most definitely upwards to the food we go. I went with the safe bet house salad. Cucumbers were beefy. The carrots were a thinly sliced visual feast. The balsamic vinaigrette salad dressing had some classy zing to it. One thing I noticed about the croutons that isn't usually a given with most salads of this persuasion. They weren't overly crunchy. Your teeth sort of sink into the soft level of crunch. Fine by me. Gives me more room to savor the whole grain flavor. \\nOn this day the main course was plucked straight from the old reliable section of the menu known as SANDWICHES. Be prepared to either have ample leftovers or a best bud with a hollow leg who doesn't main doing his fair share to both satisfy his own cravings and keep those dollars rolling into the national economy. Exhibit A was the grilled chicken club. This monster's a two-handed job for sure. The marinated chicken breast was blissfully tender. The bacon was suitably crunchy. Don't take that last reveal for granted. I've had bacon-filled sandwiches in some establishments where the bacon was tough and overly stringy. Those aren't two traits I like in my bacon. If it crunches and you can taste the beads of grease forming on your tongue I'm the proverbial happy customer. I'll forgive the line staff for not omitting the roasted garlic mayo as I requested in my lame ass attempt to show a little restraint. It added something divine to the overall taste. The grilled sourdough bread it's served on at least in terms of appearance reminded me of the grilled cheese sandwich grill marks Mom made for me as kid. Trust me the sourdough is the perfect flavor match for what's sitting in between. All the sandwich possibilities that don't answer to the name of \\"Burger\\" come with either wedge-cut or thin and crispy fries. I ordered the latter. Time to get that best bud to, as you seem to always see articulated in the Sports section during crunch time moments, step up. Generous doesn't even begin to describe this heap of slashed spuds. You could pick your teeth with them to dislodge the sandwich remains. They're that thin. What they lack in size they make up for in taste. Neato with a capital N. Had I eaten them all there would have been no room in my gullet for...\\nDessert. Your physician shudders at the word. Your ultra-sensitive side seeks it out with Pavlovian regularity. I don't want to be part of a world where the possibility of partaking of it doesn't exist. BJs has you covered. I'd have to have \\"dumb\\" writ large on my forehead were I to refuse one of their noteworthy Pizookies. Just say that word and you're six years old again. Two dessert classics I humbly bow down to are Cookies 'n'  Cream ice cream and Oreos. You wouldn't be considered quackers if, upon polishing off the Cookies 'n' Cream Pizookie, you'd officially claimed you just had a religious experience. Heavenly Oreo cookie, yummy be thy name, thy reason for being, let yourself be adorned by 3 scoops of vanilla bean ice cream and Cookies 'n' Cream mousse. Infidels need not enter the kingdom of decadence. Wasn't it Billy Joel who said \\"I'd rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints?\\" LMAO.\\nThe waitstaff was on its game. Finished plates were taken away on the spot. My server, upon noticing I wasn't quite finished with dessert promised he wasn't trying to rush me. How often are you made to feel like a valued customer and not just a link in the table turn over chain? That merits three stars right off.\\nBJs is way more than OK.

Guy at register was really nice too. During our visit on a Sunday afternoon, a lot of their things were run out though already, such as their cold brew and some of their donuts. It was a bummer, but hey.. it happens, especially if the place is solid and popular, but the guy was really nice about it. We opted for the hard apple cider fritters and the OG donut though, which we both really enjoyed. The dough here is so soft and the glaze and stuff on the donut is definitely of good quality and none of that overly sweet overpowering stuff.\\n\\nWith all that said, YUP - I am a believer.

I also appreciate all the different substitution options hopdoddy offers like gluten-free buns! Pro-tip would be to add a fried egg to any of your burgers. Yum.

Plain noodles with choice of meat!  Scrambled eggs!  Carrots with butter!  There is pretty much always something that my kid is happy to eat, and all of it healthy and freshly made.

It is one of the dishes I look forward to on Easter Day (after forgoing meat for Lent), or at the end of a bad day or week, or after an event worth celebrating. There are not a lot of things I enjoy more than biting into crispy fried chicken skin and moist, juicy chicken meat.\\n\\nWhen I visited Memphis, I made sure that Gus's was one of our stops, and I fell head over heels in love with their fried chicken. So when I found out that there is a Gus's in Austin, I made sure that we would visit. \\n\\nThe restaurant readily reminded me of their Memphis location. The service was good and the server was friendly. They have neon decorations and folksy signs, and the table had the same checked tablecloths. However, the heavy fried chicken aroma that seemed to permeate the very walls of their Memphis location was noticeably absent here. I know that that cannot be helped considering the Austin location is fairly brand new, but that fried chicken scent added a whole lot to the ambience that I fell in love with. This is not a knock to the Austin location: it is just a simple observation.\\n\\nWe ordered the fried green tomatoes for our appetizer. We ordered the fried chicken with a side of mac and cheese, beans and greens for our entree. The food was delicious! The fried green tomatoes were seasoned and cooked perfectly. The chicken was seasoned well with the skin crispy and the meat moist and perfectly cooked. The sides were above average. On their own, they hold really well. But if I were to compare them to their Memphis counterpart, I would say that the skin was not as crisp (which was really disappointing to me since that crispy skin is what made an instant fan out of me). However, if I were to just comment on Austin's version, i would say that they have really good fried chicken.\\n\\nIf I want good fried chicken in Austin, I would go back again. On that next visit, though, I would be sure to shed my bias for Gus's Memphis and just enjoy what  their Austin location has to offer."},{"name":"Yalla","address":"99 Krog St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Unreal, I had the shwarma laffa, and made the mistake of adding extra chicken...needless to say, it was the biggest thing I've ever seen!

I am not sure of the names of each but I liked the darker sauce since it was a bit sweeter.

We tried the palak paneer naan, the jalepeno and cream cheese naan, and the regular naan.  All three were served steaming hot and fresh. The regular naan was good and complemented our entrees well. The palak paneer contains spinach and paneer. I can only say that while writing this, my mouth doesn't really water for another. It was good but nothing memory invoking. The jalepeno and cream cheese naan was great. Cheese provided a nice texture with the bread. The jalepenos offered a slight spiciness. Consider this warning, the jalepeno and cream cheese naan is very filling.\\n\\nThe entrees ordered were chicken tikka masala, paneer tikka masala, and the beef korma. The tikka masala sauce was buttery with bits of spices. The korma was full of flavorful herbs. When the food was delivered my nostrils were in heaven. I ate to a point where my tummy almost blew up.

Yes, the food isn't spicy enough because it has to suit the tastes of the masses, but there is something truly delightful about getting to sample so many different dishes...and sample them until you are ready to fall asleep at your table. Or, come for the dinner, and have them add some heat (though they never seen to add enough). The lame Indian restaurants lining Mass Ave. between Central and Harvard can't touch Bukhara. \\n\\nThe food is excellent, the aforementioned lunch buffet is the bomb, the waiters are pretty insane and wonderfully entertaining, and this one dude who works there always takes a shot of Budweiser as their lunch service is coming to an end. Once, I saw one of the servers find a pair of ostentatious sunglasses that a customer had accidentally left behind, and put them on and do a dance of sorts. I mean, all of this for like $12? That's a pretty good deal to me. The dinner prices are reasonable, for the quality and quantity too; my boyfriend and I split two entrees and an appetizer, and had enough leftovers for one, filling lunch the next day. I'm officially obsessed with their okra. The check was only around $30 (before tip), too.\\n\\nI've also seen the owner/manager pack up a little plastic container from the buffet and give it to a homeless man on a few occasions.

Today these places exist but either they've gone to mostly pizza or they aren't that special anymore.\\n\\nSerena brings the best of traditional Italian home cooking with sophistication diners expect today. \\n\\nChef/owner Giovanni Longo opened Serena a few years ago after running another place in Medford. Medford's loss is Malden's gain. In a most inauspicious location, you enter Ristorante Serena through a shared doorway with another restaurant. PIty the other place! It's elegant, cozy and inviting. Some of the tables sit under archways jutting out of the walls. It's small but not cramped.\\n\\nThe menu is extensive with so many choices of apps, salads, pasta, and main courses featuring meats and seafood. \\n\\nOur delightful waiter explained the food is consistent but if we had any special requests they would be happy to try to accommodate us. We went with the Linguine Frutti Di Mari which was just perfect- lots of shrimp, scallops and a little fish  surrounded by mussels and clams in linguine with the requested moderately spicy al diavolo sauce- not so spicy as to obliterate the taste of the seafood. The other entree was Penne Al Granchio- crabmeat and shrimp in a vodka pink sauce. The fusilli was replaced easily with risotto- generous portions of crab and shrimp and a light and not too creamy sauce. \\n\\nRistorante Serena offers a reasonable wine menu with bottles starting in the low to mid-20's.

We were 5 people, and we didn't feel cramped at all... again- it was pretty dead in the North End... perhaps because it's been snowing tonight. \\n\\nI'll get into food in a second, but I gave the service 4 stars because of the waitresses general un-classiness and attire. I've been to many restaurants in the North End, and I expect a certain level of professionalism that was somewhat lacking here. There were two waitstaff that tag-teamed us, and they were not unpleasant... If I were paying the bill, I would have erred on the side of 15% instead of 20%. Their uniform were black t-shirts with the restaurant's name, and it felt more like a chain restaurant uniform than North End Italian.  \\n\\nWe had an awesome bottle of wine from Puglia- I don't know how much it was- Dad paid- but I've heard the wines here are priced very reasonably. \\n\\nFor apps, we had the two different antipastos (meat/cheese/vegs and roasted vegs). ALL of the comments and praises were directed at the roasted veggies. It's a MUST. We also had the olive tray and the bruschetta trio special, but I didn't try either because olives come straight from the devil's butt and I don't really eat cheese. I didn't hear anything negative. \\n\\nFor our main courses, pretty much everyone cleaned their plates clean. SO GOOD. I personally had the seafood risotto special. Again, I CLEANED MY PLATE. Fantastic flavor and fresh seafood- and a good balance of risotto vs. seafood. \\n\\nWe also got the nutella bread pudding for dessert- I again didn't partake because I've got issues- but it was gobbled up in a matter of seconds. \\n\\nAll in all, I definitely recommend, but I can definitely see how if this place is crowded, you might have a different experience.

It is safe to say that I have eaten here well over a dozen times, so I feel very comfortable about writing a review.\\n\\nThe number one reason why I keep coming back to Orinoco is the food.  Between the shredded beef and eggs for brunch, the empanadas, and the mojo sauce, I really have never tasted anything less than excellent here.  I absolutely love their cocktails; their coconut mojito, spicy mojito and sangria are all delicious choices.  I have even been to the Orinoco that is located in the South End of Boston and just feel like the Brookline Village location reigns because of their full bar.  \\n\\nHowever, every time I have dined at Orinoco, the service has always been a little slow.  I even found myself making excuses for Orinoco--it may be slow but once you sit and eat the delicious food, you forget about why they may have pissed you off in the first place. \\n\\nThis past Saturday night, me and four others came to dine here.  One friend being from out of town.  We talked up this place so much, he was so excited to see what the food was like.  And then came the night that completely turned me from ever wanting to come back to Orinoco.  \\n\\nWe waited two hours to be seated.  TWO hours, after we were told the wait would only be one hour.  After seeing tables of two's and four's right next to each other open up (the hostess could have slid the two together to make a table for five), we watched as the hostess gave away table after table to people just walking in the door.  After reaching my threshold, an hour and forty-five minutes into our wait, I asked the hostess what she could do for under estimating her wait time on the \\"one\\" table in the house that she planned to seat us in.  We couldn't sit at the bar because those seats were reserved for diners.  It turns out, the table she had in mind for us was there for a Birthday and she didn't know they had brought a cake.  Her response was, \\"I can't help it if they take longer.\\"  Perhaps you can't.  But having a backup plan and communicating with the servers is necessary.  As a hostess, you do whatever it takes to graciously handle the situation.  Let me tell you, there was no grace. \\n\\nTHEN, after the restaurant had died down, at about 10:30, we had to wait twenty minutes for a re-fill on drinks!  When my boyfriend went up to ask the server if we can have another round, he found our server fidgeting on her iPhone!!  We didn't leave the place until about 11:30.  A 3 1/2 hour dinner?  Worth it?  I don't care how great the food is.  In the most generous way to say this, this is by far the worst service I have ever experienced in my life.  \\n\\nBelieve it or not, there was no manager to help rectify the situation.  No manager on the busiest restaurant night of the week?  However, the bartender was very nice, and offered to pay for our appetizers.  In any other situation, getting free apps would absolutely settle my anger, but after we were ignored by our server, our razor-sharp emotions flooded right back.  \\n\\nNot only have I recommended countless people to visit this restaurant, but we took someone from out of town here, on his last night in Boston, and we ended up having a three and a half hour dinner.  It was not three and a half hours by choice!  By the time our actual entrees came, our entire table was silent because at that point we were starving!\\n\\nTo the manager, owner, waitstaff...whoever is reading this and the other reviews about the poor service, what does it take to get your attention?

Funny, since Gusto! is basically next door & even has a sign out front that says \\"OUR CHIPOTLE IS BETTER,\\" bc they have a bowl option that is incredibly similar. And their format is similar. Only it IS infinitely better, as is the service, & cleanliness. (It just costs more.) So I ended up here at 10 til close after never getting waited on at Tomatillos in East Atlanta, not intentionally showing up somewhere at the last minute. I came here bc I was starving and trying to save the $ I should've spent on Gusto! instead. I walked in & asked for a burrito bowl for here. (I always finish in under 10 minutes, as I did tonight.) The girl promptly listed off a BUNCH of ingredients they were \\"out of\\" (read: they decided to stop \\"making\\" it for the night; no way whoever does inventory didn't have all that stocked in the store to basically heat up & dump in a vat), in a tone that clearly conveyed her hope it would encourage me to turn around and exit in frustrated side-eyeing disappointment, rather than have her go through the effort of scooping ingredients into a bowl one more time (for, you know, her income/employment). I told her I was starving so I looked at what was left and figured out a way to still make myself a satisfying burrito bowl, albeit sans two of my usual ingredients (or lettuce - the \\"out of\\" included brown rice, corn, lettuce, and I think some meat option(s)). She looked disappointed but obliged, although she oddly had me repeat my choices of black beans and chicken. Then the cashier, instead of saying, \\"Anything else?\\" or \\"Anything to drink?\\" said, avoiding eye contact (chatting with the security guard), \\"That's all?\\" and started to tell me my total. So I had to say no and tell her what juice I wanted. Then she said, \\"That's all?\\" and rung me up, again with no eye contact. I went to sit and quickly eat my food, and the tops of almost every interior table were filthy. Which maybe explained why all but one customer was eating on the patio? I was going to photograph all of the nastiness, but just as I sat, the cashier started cleaning up - in order to leave sooner. At 5 minutes til close, she was loudly announcing to the security guard, in the dining area in the presence of me & another customer, to lock the door \\"at 10. Not 10:01, not 10:02. TEN.\\" Yeah. I've worked at Starbucks and other such jobs. This is not how you are being paid to behave with or around customers. So I guess they'll enjoy their search for new employment soon when they succeed at stopping their customers from returning, and pushing us all over to Gusto!, where they will definitely never be hired. Oh - second star is only because the food was fine, the price is fine, parking lot, and I assume their health score was probably okay, but I could be wrong there. Oh, Willy's and another Mexican-style place are also within a stone's throw, next to Starbucks.

While I can't comment on all of TB's offerings, I can say that the beef rib is superb.  Magnificently juicy, with a salt-based seasoning that surprisingly makes the rib taste like a great 'fatty' brisket.\\n\\nI visited mid-January on a Sunday afternoon while wanting to see the Austin Roller Derby across the way, so there was no real line.  This is a large, family-friendly operation with a nifty BBQ-shack style.  Definitely a contender to take an out-of-towner to, given its convenient location, easy parking, and lack of the trademark Franklin four-hour wait.\\n\\nService was fast. You pick up a tray, get your own sides as you follow the serving line (cafeteria-style), and then pick the meats you want by the pound.  The beef rib we got was a bit over a pound, which was a nice deal considering the delectable meat-to-bone ratio.  Once you get your drinks and settle in, like TB's says: Smile, because you're in Texas and you're eating BBQ!\\n\\nBoth the mac n' cheese and the beans are pretty good, though I like mine with more zip.  The peach cobbler has a wonderfully fruity zing, though the dough at the top was a little under-cooked.  I know, minor grievances when eating great BBQ - who cares all that much about the sides? \\n\\nThough I prefer to eat BBQ straight, letting the meat, spices, and smoke speak for themselves, they do have BBQ sauce in Original, Spicy, and Sweet varieties.  I gave each a shot with a dip of beef rib and they're actually quite good, if a little runnier than I'm used to. Definitely a great pick if you mix the Spicy and Sweet sauces and put a dollop of the result on BBQ pork.\\n\\nThis place scores a 4 out of 5 on the 'CTJ Scale', as noted below.\\n\\n5 out of 5 stars: Come-to-Jesus good.

They were brought to the table by a food runner. Before he ran away, I asked him which were which- we ordered Wellfleets, ones from Cape May and a third one. He vaguely points that 'those six are wellfleets, those six are Cape may, those six are'.  What? There are a dozen oysters, not 18. And, unfortunately, they are not shucked cleanly. There were broken shells in a few of them. Our dinners were yummy- I had the siracha lobster mac and cheese, my Constant Companion liked his fish tacos, and our guests liked the warm butter lobster rolls. \\nSo my mac and cheese was salty( in a good way- it should be!). I finish my beer, and water and wait for our server to notice for over ten minutes. I think she may have had 3 parties at this point of the evening. Finally, I ask Constant Companion for his, as I am parched. Finally, she remembers us and asks us what else we need. \\nI like the vibe and the menu here.

You want to get mad at him but he's still pretty fun to hang out with. You're just not sure you want to invite him into your fantasy league or loan him $20.\\n\\nWhen I was a young college kid Whiskey's was like Disneyland. The waitresses were all hot and scantily-dressed, they had cheap beer (at the time I think it was $2.00 Coor's Light or something), and they didn't know the meaning of the phrase \\"shut off\\". The place was mobbed almost every night with young people out to have the time of their life every night. It brought in the cool girls, who were still as hot as the club girls but actually preferred the bar scene and wanted to talk.\\n\\nI can only assume they toned it down since the '90's but, not unlike that tuxedo-t-shirt wearing cousin, Whiskey's might not know when to hang it up. Of course, Whiskey's also has the advantage of 800K new students a year coming into the city so to them it's probably the same wonderland it was to me.\\n\\nAs I got older and realized I couldn't just chase women and drink for a living Whiskey's offered me solace in my enlightened years. Also $.10 wings. Solace and $.10 wings. And still pretty cheap beer but by then I could afford to move down the tap bank to the IPAs. But you realize that after work drinks with co-workers isn't the end of your social life, it's the beginning of a new chapter of trying to meet girls and eat $.10 wings at the same time. \\n\\nBut don't lose track of time. Never lose track of time. Because inevitably your fun but suspect cousin with the tuxedo T-shirt will come barreling through that door to ask you to hide the photo he stole off the bathroom wall in your laptop bag (now where did I put that anyway?) and before you know it it's well past your bedtime and the girl you've been talking to for two hours is closer to your nephews age then to yours. \\n\\nSo the moral of the story is: you already know Whiskey's. You grew up with him and you remember him trying to steal you uncles Playboys. It was fun back then, but he's still doing it even though he's quite old enough for his own subscription. For those out-of-towners that were maybe \\"duped\\" into going there, that happens. You're the tourist. Sometimes you get the tour and sometimes the tour gets you. If you've lived here for a while, why blame Whiskey's for being Whiskey's? He's not gonna change now. Just wish him well and tell him you'll see him at Gramma's 80th birthday, wearing his tuxedo T-shirt."},{"name":"Terry Black's Barbecue","address":"1003 Barton Springs Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Was excited to eat here for the first time.

We finally decided to visit Yak & Yeti on our 4th trip to the park and it being my birthday weekend.\\n\\nHere are my ratings based on different criteria:\\n\\nQuality of food: unimpressive/forgettable. We really wanted to love this place. From some of the blogs that we had read and the pictures we had seen, we thought we would have some of the best food imaginable here. I'm sad to say that wasn't the case at all. We shared an order of pork egg rolls and the crispy honey chicken entree. The egg rolls were nice and hot but nothing spectacular. The honey chicken was mostly rice and not much chicken. It's just hard to describe it but if I had to sum up my review of just the food here then here's how it would be...a blind tasting of food from my local $6.99 Chinese hole-in-the-wall joint and the $29 ($10 for egg rolls + $19 for crispy chicken) food that I had at Yak & Yeti, I really would not be able to tell them apart! Sure, the food at Y&Y was served to look prettier but when it came to taste it just was very much a \\"meh\\"!\\n\\nDecor: amazing. The true reason to visit this place is for the decor. There are two levels to the restaurant and each level has an amazing variety of authentic decors, wall hangings, and statues.\\n\\nCleanliness: good. No complaints. The tables were kept clean.\\n\\nService: mostly friendly. Even though our wait time was supposed to be 1 hour, it took more like 1 hr and 15 mins. The front desk folks were not apologetic for the extra wait. The girl that took our order and the server that seated us were nice and took care of filling our waters and taking our orders. The server even got me a Disney birthday pin and a free cupcake!\\n\\nSpeed of food preparation: quick. The food came within 15 mins of ordering.\\n\\nPrice: expensive. For sharing an appetizer and an entree, our bill was around $38 with tax and tip.\\n\\nIf you're craving the food served at Y&Y then I would highly recommend getting it from the quick service place next to it. The food is half the price and taste just the same from having talked to some of the folks that ate there. The only reason to visit this restaurant is for the decor. The food was unimpressive and very expensive for both quality and quantity."},{"name":"Rangzen Tibetan Place","address":"24 Pearl St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"I love the veg momos.

I've been here 3 times (I decided to give it a 2nd chance after the 1st bad exp. & lastly I decided to try something new from the menu) each experience I've had was BAD and provided by \\"Chef\\" DERRICK. He has such an angry bitter face expression and horrible energy,maybe he doesn't like his job? he is not friendly at all and lacks customer service 100%! I recently ordered the chicken laffa for the first time, I tried to watch him make it (even though it's hard to see them build your food together as the set up isnt the greatest). I saw they had radish & asked the lady if she can add some to my laffa, she look scared to ask derrick as she hesitated to ask. She eventually asked him and he told me very cut,dry and reprimanding me saying,\\"next time you need to tell the cashier up front\\" and gave me like 4 thin slices in my giant laffa and a dirty look. The last time I went I ordered a pita with everything and a Shouk bowl with no spicy sauce. I got my order and noticed they did not put spicy on the pita,I asked derrick for the spicy harissa sauce (which doesn't look like authentic israeli harissa) & he tried to charge 50 cents for a side! he eventually let me have it as he realized they forgot to put it on. Next,I asked derrick if the water machine next to their counter was his and he said NO, I asked if they serve water in a cup and he said NO, NO. Then he slightly bumped into the trays and was upset & cursed a loud\\"fucking trays!!\\" he seems to be angry and he completely ruins the experience of enjoying the food here.

Full bar (with a huge beer variety). Hip, young vibe. Casual ambiance. Oh and free wifi. Yes, please if you want a unique take on plain-old-lunchtime. \\n\\nService: We dropped by Parish Cafe Sunday afternoon, with no reservation. The wait time was a reasonable 15 minutes. The turnover rate for the tables both inside and on the patio seem fairly fast. Our waitress was friendly enough. She had a good knowledge of the menu and kitchen goings-on, refilled our water glasses, and check on us several times. \\n\\nFood: Parish Cafe has a varied lunch menu of unique sandwiches, salads, seafood, and entrees. We ordered the 1/2 size onion rings for appetizer. The onion rings were exactly how I liked them--thick and beer-battered. The dipping sauce, a chipotle aioli, added just enough punch to the tasty rings. For lunch, I ordered the Zuni Roll with a side of potato salad. The Zuni Roll presentation 5 stars. Flavor 3 stars. The tortilla was incredible--crispy on the outside and fresh. The turkey breast however was super salty, grocery store lunch meat. That was a definite turn off for me. For $12, I was actually expecting to get real meat. The portions are also pretty large. You could definitely split a sandwich and be comfortably full. Wish they had a 1/2 size option for their sandwiches...\\n\\nPrice: Sandwiches range $12-15.

I love all the dark old workwork. \\n\\nBUT--the bar service wasn't great.
