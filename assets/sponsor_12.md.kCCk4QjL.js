I'm a steak guy but I wasn't particularly impressed by their steak tacos; they were, however, pretty good on the first visit so I am not sure if they changed something or what.  Their \\"Casa Corn\\" was something I loved on the first visit but that too isn't as good now, particularly because they no longer cut it in half when they give it to you (so good luck sharing this with someone even though it is on the \\"shareables\\" menu).  The chips and salsa and/or dips are very average - they really need to up their game on that.  Given the quality of what you get, the pricing here is too high as well.

That's actually surprising as I'm pretty easily spellbound when submerged in a new urban environment for the first time.  \\n\\nAfter a delayed red eye flight, a van ride from hell, checking into our terrible/scary/shady/gross hostel in the Bowery, and our guide walking us to the subway and saying \\"well, see you tomorrow\\" my classmates and I looked at each other wondering where in the heck to start and what we were in for the next week.    \\n\\nSomehow, and to this day have no idea how it happened exactly, we ended up in the smack dab middle of Central Park. Being in that atmosphere as the fall leaves were just starting to appear made us all relax a bit.  The rest of the trip was amazing.  \\n\\nPeople react well to parks, studies have been done that those who are doing some form of work (be it in an office, at home, in a hospital healing, etc) and have a visual connection to nature are more likely to be more effective with the use of their time and energy.  They have the ability to look up, away from the computer or paper, and reconnect with nature, giving the mind a time to relax and refresh from the tedium \\n\\nso it's no wonder that including the idea of a park setting is a business results in an instinctively comforting thing.  Such is the case with Gray's at the Park. Located across from Esther Short Park it's a fine dining restaurant inside the Vancouver Hilton.  Storefront windows line the entire length of the dining area looking out on the revitalized area of the city - sweeping views of old oak trees intermixed with new developments and impromptu entertainment venues.  \\n\\nFor a location inside a hotel, and one of the more well to do spots in town, it's usually pretty quiet.  I've always made reservations but they never seem to be necessary.\\n\\nThe staff is small and knowledgeable about everything on the menu: \\"We get to test everything out\\" one waitress told me once.  It's a northwest flair where everything is served a la carte and sides are big enough for 2-3 people.  It can be a fun experience trying new takes on classic cuts of seafood, poultry and red meat.  You don't leave hungry either.  \\n\\nThere's a full bar, a nice wine list, and the coffee... to tarnish it with cream or sugar would be a crime.  \\n\\nWhile it may not offer the most spectacular views, or plushest of plush environments, it's a well crafted dining experience."},{"name":"China Palace","address":"6605 Airport Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I LOVE China Palace.

Of course, this is a burger shop in America, so they were salted with an appropriate amount of the seasoning. \\n  I liked my food enough to look forward to ordering it again, but it was also good enough that I'd like to try more of the menu.\\n  The service was on point for what is basically setup as fast food. We were greeted as soon as we walked in. The girl behind the counter went over the menu with us, and was going to give us time to think about it, but none was needed. Neither of us knew what to expect, so I think we both just ordered at random.  The food came out quick, the girl brought it to us, and we ate. Despite not appearing to be a full-service restaurant, the same girl also came by and refilled my drink for me, and took my empty tray when I was done.  \\n  The atmosphere is somewhat like a blend between Bob's burgers and Chipotle, but cleaner and more friendly.  \\n   Eating here made me wish that I still lived across the street, and I will definitely be back next time I need food on that side of town.\\n   If there is anything to nitpick about, it is that maybe some people might not think the sweet tea is syrupy enough. It tastes like it is made from water, sugar, and tea; which I think is good, but I don't actively try to acquire diabetes like some southerners do.

Short of walking to the gas station for scary burritos, I was stuck ordering dinner, and even though it's never cheap, pizza was the best way to stretch what little money I had.  And then I found Sarpino's.  With no minimum order and no delivery fee, and with their very fairly priced calzones, I was all set.  And over that time I was ordering so often, they got to know me well enough that when I called, they just asked me if I wanted the usual.  Sure, it probably wasn't the healthiest diet, but I'm guessing it was better than whatever was in those gas station burritos.  \\n\\nThat was 7 years ago, and I've been ordering off and on from them ever since, though now days I usually order some dessert or salad as well, so I'm no longer killing them on the delivery.  I especially love that they have REAL desserts, not whatever sugary crap they can throw on a pizza crust.  Tiramisu, chocolate mousse cake, cheese cake... and it's all awesome.  They've only ever messed up my order once, giving me marinara on the side instead of the garlic butter I'd requested, but it wasn't enough of a problem to ruin my meal. I ordered again tonight, and my still-warm dinner was delivered in just over 20 minutes, so I guess it's safe to say that Sarpino's is still at the top of my don't-feel-like-cooking-dinner list!"},{"name":"The Chubby Chickpea","address":"588 Washington St","city":"Canton","stars":"3.5","text":"Love having a middle eastern place that is fast and delicious.

A great deal seems to be merchandise (stuffed animals, cards, a wall full of miscellaneous gifts, and scattered art pieces (which I believe were by local artists).

One area is has seats up at the window along with some scattered tables and chairs while the other area is full of tables, couches and a fireplace.  Both seem pretty cozy whether you are there to chit-chat, use the free wi-fi, or to do some work.

Well, we found two dishes we liked and both were served hot, with generous portions of vegetables (our preference) but also enough protein that no one could complain of being cheated on that front.  Tasty.  Portion size was average -- not the oversized amount one might expect from a hole-in-the-wall place trying to compete on quantity.  \\n\\nOur biggest problem was using the restaurant.com voucher we had bought.

I have been a few times over the past year prior to said last visit, but I tell you what I wish I could give this place a -Zero but not for the food. I had Fried Whole Chicken Wings and they were very good! I would give them a 3 Star for the wings but I CAN NOT give them a good rating due to the incidents that have occurred here.\\n\\nIn the interest of time I will just briefly tell you of the WORST incident. My BF and I stopped late one evening. As we were standing in line a young man asked him if I was his wife. He said yes. Then the guy smiled and said \\"You a lucky MF. My N\\". Okay. WOW! Soooo We went back to looking at the menu and waited on him to finish placing his order. I noticed another young man that was initially standing with him asking every person int he restaurant for money. Now mind you, his friend just ordered about $40 worth of food so I wasn't sure what the pan handling was about. As we finally got to place our orders the second young man asked \\"I really need some money. Can y'all order less food and let me have like $10?\\"...Oh yes he did!...So before I knew it I snapped and my BF had to literally step in between the two of us and tell him to hit the road. I asked the woman taking the order's if this was acceptable behavior in this establishment and all she could say is \\"I just work here!\\" So she tells the people cooking and they just look up and say \\"Sorry. Sorry!\\" I assume the cashier is there to take a bullet while the owners run out the back after hopefully throwing hot grease up at anyone trying to hold them up. I would not want to have that \\"Front Line of Defense\\" position that's for sure.\\n\\nWe sit down and wait on our orders to be prepared and wouldn't you know it, these guys continue to ask people that come in if they can give them money. And not just as they sat at the tables but while they were at the cash registers trying to pay for their food. So the bf had me sitting with my back towards them so he could get a good view of what was going on. They got their food and continued to ask for money. Apparently they needed gas money to get back home. As one young lady came in and told them to bring their \\"A's\\" on and they better have enough gas money to make it back home. \\n\\nSo that's enough for me going to this place. There were two cops that pulled in and went over to the gas station. I don't see why the owner's didn't go over or call next door or send an SOS them or something! LOL....But I'm done with this place. ZeRO!!!!!"},{"name":"Toasted","address":"1945 Aloma Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"Bread? Check. Cheese? Got it. Creativity? Loads. Problem?

The french fries ($7 pomme frites) were not hot and the Brussels sprouts drowned in a not great Asian sauce.  \\n\\nTo his credit our server acknowledged right away that the steak was over.

Oh... they just season the burger. There is actually just a bit of seasoning on my ground beef; false alarm.\\n\\nNormally, the \\"grease drip\\" that falls onto your parchment paper in which your burger is held is grounds for the thought of \\"wow, they cooked this awesome.\\" In this case, it merely means that they actually season this patty. Oddly, the burger was not juicy, yet my burger dripped some cajun-colored fat. Good indicator of \\"unique\\" flavor; but the proof was not in the puddin', as there was no source from which the grease came into fruition.\\n\\nThe grub was cheap cheap, a full meal at this non-nationalized establishment will run you just about $7-8. It is not fast food, but it is not quite a sit down. With 3 different sizes of burgers, there is surely a satisfying portion for everyone. The small is probably 1/8 lb, the large is probably 1/2 lb. The medium? Take a wild guess... Anyway, the meat and bun combinations are definitely affordable.\\n\\nI did not stick to the American staple known as \\"plain cheeseburger\\" but rather the enticing jalapeno cheese burger should have assumed pickled peppers cheesy good seasoning on burger somewhat like a McDonald's patty\\n\\nThe sides review can go a little faster.

They don't take reservations for two people and they won't seat at the multiple open four person tables just in case a number of larger parties come in. This is usually fine, hot pot is a social meal, but we came here on my husbands birthday, after I called to try and make a reservation, and they wouldn't seat us despite half the restaurant being empty.

Also, all ingredients taste very fresh, even in the dead of winter when fresh vegetables can get pricy.\\nThe only reason I hesitate to give Piada 5 stars is a slight lack of consistency.

(We will overlook the fact that, like many other Mexican places in town, the menu's been almost directly cribbed from Guero's.) Still, I am, and here's why (all based on my most recent dining experiences):\\n\\n1. Service. While I of course understand that freshly cooked meals take a while to prepare, taking nearly an hour -- on a recent brunch day when the restaurant wasn't even half-full -- is inexcuable. (They also forgot my tortillas altogether.) Even our drinks typically took a good 15-20 minutes to arrive. Our chips and salsa, over the course of a two-hour meal today, were replenished but one time.\\n\\n2. Disappearing menu sections. For reasons apparently known only to the owner, both the taco and brunch menus have been permanently excised -- which *might* make sense if this place wasn't specifically open Sundays for brunch! (never mind breakfast - do they still get a menu with actual egg items on it?) When asked about this mysterious absence, our waiter said they could still cook up anything on the old menus, and somewhere he conjured up a copy of the old menu (which btw is, as of this moment, still on their Web site, even though it's essentially been chopped in half in size). Sazon formerly had bottomless mimosas for brunch, but I assume those have been done away with as well; there was certainly no mention of them on any of the three menus we perused (new food menu, old food menu, cocktail menu).\\n\\n3. Mysterious discotheque transformation. Yes, you read that correctly. Sazon ostensibly closes on Sundays at 3pm. We lingered well past that, and to our surprise encountered a large table being seated around 3:45pm. We were seated on the patio -- thank you, Austin, for delivering an 80-degree January afternoon! -- and were even more shocked when, during our departure a little after 4pm, the inside had just as many people as it did when we arrived, coupled with loud dance music that wouldn't be out of place on Sixth Street. WTF?\\n\\n4. Parking. Again, the restaurant was half-full; the parking lot, in contrast, was completely full. Worse still, the adjacent body shop (closed on Sundays, naturally) has large \\"WE WILL TOW\\" signs all around, when it could easily handle the overflow parking. Any reason Sazon's owners couldn't offer to lease it out on nights and weekends, much like the Black Sheep Lodge has done with its own adjacent service station? (now a valet lot) Next to it is what used to be an ironworks facility but is apparently now being transformed into the newest branch of the Torchy's Tacos empire, so that lot's now autom√≥vil non grata as well. There's also no nearby street parking. We finally ended up having to park at La Feria across Mary St., making sure to keep a constant eye out for potential tow trucks.\\n\\nAgain, the food here is great, as are the drinks (though not as good as Guero's), and I've yet to encounter a menu item I'd consider subpar. It's also one of the few places in town that's entirely smoker- and dog-friendly on its patio (dogs are allowed inside the patio, and smoking is allowed even under the covered portion; I can say neither about, say, Polvo's and its notorious patio). Still, the four \\"black marks\\" listed above are seriously dissuading me from continuing my semi-regular status here."},{"name":"Stephanie's On Newbury","address":"190 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"i'm going to keep this one short and sweet.\\n\\n2 quick tips:\\n1) make a reservation beforehand\\n2) get the caramel apple bread pudding for dessert!!!!\\n\\nthat's all, folks."},{"name":"Rolling In Thyme & Dough","address":"333 W Hwy 290","city":"Dripping Springs","stars":"4","text":"This is a charming cafe with both indoor and outdoor seating.  \\n\\nYou can order food and/or espresso drinks, and if you are in a hurry and can't tolerate the line (which there is often a very long one) you can buy your coffee with cash on the honor system.\\n\\nToday for lunch I had a  1/2 sandwich and cup of soup combo.

The pastrami was tough and full of un-rendered gristle.

The beef wasn't flavorful. Didn't have that savory flavor that beef and broccoli should have.\\nLast but never least my beloved crab rangoon. They give you 4 for $4.95 (I think they should give you 6 for that price but I digress). The crab rangoon lacked... crab. It was just fried cream cheese, they were fairly small compared to other Chinese restaurants. All in all, I paid about $30 (it was $29 and some change to be exact) for a meal but it was subpar.

We've been ordering from you for many months now, have spent more than $30 each time, always tipping the driver well. There's been a few issues along the way but nothing too bad. Now, last time we ordered, the pizza was very undercooked. We informed the owner of that and was offered a replacement. We declined that because the pizza was edible and I'm just not the kind of person to get free stuff. Then we come to tonight. I call to order food for delivery which we've had done many, many times. I was told they don't deliver to our house. After telling the woman that we have ordered many times she again says they don't deliver here. I tell her to double check because I know that to be a lie and she tells me it's a new rule that they don't deliver here at night. Again ridiculous, I ask her to look up my address because I'm literally two miles from them and she said the driver and manager said no. I ask to speak to the manager and she says there isn't one on duty tonight. So she lied to me. I ask what manager will be there in the morning and she tells me there won't be one. I ask when the manager will be there and she tells me they come in at night. Again a lie since she said at first that managers aren't there at night and aren't there tonight. Basically telling me there is never one there and I can just call to check daily I guess? If you have a business that doesn't ever have a manager in duty, you are doing a pretty crappy job all around. This sucks because before we began eating here, I hated pizza.

From the show of the action in the kitchen to the oustanding service and the wonderfully tasty food, you just can't top it.  We shared 6 dishes off of the regular menu and 3 items from the dim sum and one dessert.  Out of those ten dishes, not one was a miss.  The Red Shrimp dish was one of the most outstanding bites I have had ever.  The Yellow Squash Lazagnette was a very flavorful vegetable presentation, and the Durum Spaghetti Cacio de Pepi is so good that it would be worth a return trip for that dish alone.  My favorite bites from the dim sum were the beef tartare and the tempura green beans.  Our dessert selection was the Salted Caramel Panna Cotta with Burnt Honeycomb and granola.

And since I live in Austin, my standards are high.\\n\\nHere's my judging criteria:\\nQuality of the Margaritas\\nYum factor of the Queso\\nOverall food tastiness\\nChill-factor of the restaurant\\n\\nSazon scores pretty high marks for all of them. Let's start at the top.\\n\\nMargaritas\\nThere are 3 places in town I'll drink Margaritas: Sazon, Curra's and Gueros. There might be others that are worthy, but I doubt it. My fave at Sazon is the Huachinango (Spanish for Red Snapper). It's got tequila, an orange liquor, fresh lime juice and a splash of cranberry. A couple of these and you don't care if the service is slow, you're in for the long haul (see requirement #4 for a good Mexican food restaurant).\\n\\nQueso\\nSazon is not Tex-Mex and their queso reflects that. It's not your standard-fare orange cheese-like substance. Not that there is anything wrong with the standard-fare, it's just that's not what Sazon delivers. Their queso is a creamier, sharpy cheesy goodness. Not sure what's in it but it goes well with the Huachinangos (see above).\\n\\nOverall Food Tastiness\\nThey hit this one out of the ballpark over and over again. My faves include the camarones, the tacos al pastor and the to-die-for Chile en Nogada.\\n\\nChill Factor\\nWhat can I say? I love this place.

Here's why:\\n\\nA friend and I arrive around 6:30. Granted, it is Thursday with $1 margs so we expected a bit of a wait. We added our name to the list and were told it would be about 10-15 minutes. 25 minutes pass by and I go up front to check where my friend and I were on the list. I see my name and a star in the left hand margin. A bit confused as to why my name was the only one with the star, I asked the host how much longer I should anticipate for our wait. He asked my name, I replied, he found it on the list and said, \\"oh! you were the name that got moved from the other list. I'm so sorry, I'll move you to the top of the list.\\" He had mistakenly put me way down the list. A complete accident, fine...just seat me.\\n\\nI then call my friend to come up as I imagined we were going to get seated very soon. The host leaves and a different hostess comes to the stand. In the time that we stood there (roughly 10 minutes) SIX parties were seated!!! I had to follow up with the hostess and explain that the other host accidentally put us on the bottom of the list when he transferred the names. There was even an arrow next to the star that pointed UPWARDS on the list. After her somewhat thinking I'm just trying to move up in the line and me defending myself, my friend and I finally get seated.\\n\\nLong story short, we order drinks and food. I got the al pastor tacos and my friend got a quesadilla. Altogether, the food was completely average at best. The flavor was just really off. The rice was kind of dry yet greasy. They forgot to bring my beans out and a sauce that goes with the tacos (the waitress brought it out when I was down to the last 1/2 of my second taco).\\n\\nTO TOP THIS ALL OFF, a group of three fratty UT boys sit at the table behind us that had just been cleared. They were not seated. They sat. My friend and I could overhear their conversation and it went along the lines of, \\"I wonder if they'll notice. Probably not!! Let's get them to turn the TVs to ESPN for the game!\\" Sure enough, they didn't notice. \\n\\nAltogether, I waited 35 minutes to be seated only to eat lackluster food. And frat boy 1, 2, and 3 did not wait at all. All of the contents of my dish were not immediately brought out or prompt at that. While I enjoy occasionally stopping to get my morning tacos from here (they've messed those up too! given me a taco I did not request only to find out when it's too late to turn back and I want to get my day started!), I don't know that I could return after the series of unfortunate events.

This place is seriously amazing. Today there were four of us and we had Carnitas Tacos, Conchita Pibil (a shredded pork baked in achiote and other spices), the chalupas lunch special, the ceviche and queso. Every single one of them elicited many oooohs and ahhhs from everyone in the group as we all tasted everything.\\n\\nIn addition, the owner was our server today and he was fantastic. He talked to us about the dishes and told us what they loved and how it came about. Please, please, please, don't let this place slip by you. It's quickly becoming my favorite Mexican place in Austin.\\n------------------------------------------------------------------\\nI pass this place every day, at least twice and have been curious about it. So was my (heterosexual) life-partner, so today, for Mother's Day, we headed out to try it with her daughter (and looking oh-so-much like the cast of The Girl-Child Has Two Mommies, Not That There's Anything Wrong With That).\\n\\nThere was no wait and the place was pretty much deserted but we didn't care, we'd both heard good things and you can always satisfy that kid with a cheese enchilada and the promise of a sip of Coke if she eats as much as she can.\\n\\nA server came to us straight away, followed by another one when she went back to get our drinks. She was perfectly nice, but the second one was charming and funny and quite chatty. \\n\\nThe menu looked fantastic and includes information about the dish, where it's from and also includes a glossary of terms. I went with the chilaquiles (tortilla strips simmered in your choice or red or green sauce, I chose red, and eggs cooked to order along with sour cream and queso fresco). These were outstanding when I slopped them all together in a flour tortilla and also added some of my (heterosexual) life-partner's creamy avocado sauce (YUM!).\\n\\nShe had the flautas which were offered with chicken or beans and cheese. That surprised both of us, we don't see bean and cheese flautas often. The rice looked kind of boring--white with carrots and peas, but she claimed the flautas to be outstanding.\\n\\nThe chips were your regular variety and not made in house (I saw the bags of them in the kitchen), and the salsa wasn't really amazing or anything. Both of us, and the girl-child, liked what we had (well, it's hard to tell with the girl-child, she just wanted that sip of forbidden Coke).\\n\\nWe plan on going back for lunch soon as we both saw other things that we wanted to try on the menu as well. \\n\\nOne thing that really stood out to me is that they seemed to have created something new because they brought it out to an empty table near the kitchen and all of the staff sat around tasting it. They all seemed very passionate about what they were doing, which could be seen on their faces as well as in the care they have taken in writing the menu descriptions. They seem to know what they are doing and really want to share it.\\n\\nGo here because it's really good and I want to make sure that they get business and stay open! They're in one of those \\"kiss of death\\" locations and I'd hate to see Austin lose out on what seems to be a really good place to eat."},{"name":"Al Hawr","address":"3500 SW River Pkwy","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Both of my parents are middle eastern.

Firstly... service here is really bad, especially considering it's proximity to Disney. The problem isn't in the kitchen (who I regularly see churning out dishes like pros), it's the front of house wait staff, and the problem seems to start at the top with the managers, who I've watched running around, rather than taking things in hand and managing when things get out of control.  I've eaten there a bunch of times and have sat at the counter and watched dishes pile up for over 20 minutes with no one noticing till CUSTOMERS finally had to point it out to them .... another time the girl sitting next to me was someone I knew worked there as a hostess and she couldn't be bothered to pitch in and run dishes that were stacking up cause it wasn't her job -- yet she kept asking her friends on staff to get her things. (So clearly, they don't function as a team.) With regards to the food (assuming it's still hot when you get it) the Ruben is horribly overpriced especially considering it has the LEAST corned beef think I've ever seen in a Ruben... the Cincinnati Chili is misnamed (it's 5 way chili using Cincinnati style chili - which has a lot of Cinnamon in it) but the taste is ok, the beef stroganoff is very salty and to be honest I think the frozen stuff from Stouffers is better; Chicken fried steak is ok but it's better over at Bob Even's, and the turkey dinner -- you can get it better and cheaper at Denny's."},{"name":"Musashino Sushi Dokoro","address":"2905 San Gabriel St, Ste 200","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"This is my favorite place to get sushi in Austin.

In Italian, \\"un casino\\" which means \\"a mess\\". As soon as my host and I walked in and saw the owner and two other employees standing together and staring wordlessly at us, I wanted to leave.  For a moment I really did think I was in Italy- but at a store in Florence where the staff stared at me because my shoes cost less than $400.00 .  When one of the Nido staff deigned to speak to us, we were not asked if we wanted to stay inside or go out to the terrace.  Instead we were taken outside where the only other diners were.   But at least it was a fairly warm night.  \\n\\nI had read a review of Il Nido during the summer in one of the free newspapers and now I see why the reviewer didn't mention the food but focused on the romance of the terrace.   The terrace could offer a view of an alley wall unless you are facing Robson or Thurlow streets.  I believe the most romantic terrace in the city, with climbing vines and flowering plants, is at Adesso.   We started with Orange Salad, which was a bowl of uninspiring greens with a few pieces of orange cut so small that they disappeared and some goat cheese.  I then had the osso bucco , the most expensive item on the menu, which was fairly dry and quite tasteless.  Remarkable for a dish which should be braised in brodo, vegetables and wine.   My friend had fish, which she described as \\"forgettable\\".  \\nThe performance of the all-female staff and the owner made it crystal clear to us that being a waiter or waitress is not something just anyone can roll out of bed one morning and do.  You don't realize how \\nImportant a sense of timing is until you are left alone for all of 90 seconds after having been given a dessert  menu.  The employee tottering on her heels and showing her thong seemed to have been around purely for entertainment until she and another staff member started re-setting tables around us for the following day.  Suddenly I was transported to a Denny's.\\n\\nDespite the website's assertion, this is not \\"inventive dining\\" -it's a mess of flavours which are either mismatched or seemingly gratuitous; as if someone had decided to make a fish dish \\"Asian\\" by adding ginger.

Her face was stunned, and she says, \\"I guess\\" in a tone of total bewilderment and disbelief. No \\"I am sorry the dessert was not to your liking\\", nothing. I then ask her again for two waters.

I always order the skirt steak, beef brisket, pork belly and short ribs. Their meats are always farm fresh - you can taste the difference. Their side dishes are pretty typical but compliment everything well. Their sauces are subtle but deep in flavor. Their bone soup is also a favorite for my kids. One of the things I love is their ventilation system - it's built into the grill so you don't leave smelling like other Korean bbq places. I appreciate that the food is always so consistent."},{"name":"Brookline Lunch","address":"9 Brookline St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Don't understand why this place gets so many glowing reviews and attracts a line out the door. Service was slow and inattentive - we asked for a check three times while they were too busy seating new customers to hand us a slip of paper. My Denver omelet was disappointing - ham was completely missing and the vegetables and cheese were just lumped on top rather than cooked in the eggs like, you know, an omelet. Home fries were not at all what I was expecting, full of odd vegetables like carrots, broccoli, and cauliflower. I've eaten brunch in probably at least 30 states and a dozen countries, and this was the first time I've ever had to chew through almost-raw cauliflower on a breakfast plate. I'm not saying that it's a bad dish if you're looking for a vegetable medley and scrambled eggs topped with fajita vegetables - but if you're going to experiment with the classics so much, at least say so on your menu so that those of us with different expectations can order something else..."},{"name":"Winflo Osteria","address":"1315 W 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"Worst italian food ever, anywhere.  FOH operations ranged from poorly organized to downright smug and snarky behavior (hostesses especially, just rude).  Wine list looked intriguing, but our server didn't seem to have any knowledge so we tried cocktails.  My cocktail was good, even though it boasted a house poached cherry which instead was a preservative ridden grenadine that belongs in a 5 yr. olds shirley temple.  The wifes aperol spritz was the worst one I've ever seen/tasted.  Now our pizza arrives, for which I had high expectations.  These guys are in the process of receiving an italian pizza certificate so this must be their strong suite.  WRONG AGAIN!!!  Worst pizza we have had in Austin since we tried south side flying pies.  The dough was so poorly proofed it wasn't thin or crispy like a neopolitan pie should be.  Next we had the misto, definately the worst thing we had.  They all tasted like the cheapest garbage ingredients that olive garden or carinos might use.  Our salad was okay, which is why we were practically competing for each piece of lettuce as finally something was edible.  I ordered myself bulleit on the rocks for the rest of the night, but my wife hadn't given up on their cocktails yet.  We get her a sazerac.  I guess for an everythings bigger in texas twist, they chose to not use pernod and just use real absinthe.  Sounded cool until it arrived.  It was made so improperly that is was nearlly pink from the amount of peychauds and had way too much simple syrup in it.  Obviously the cocktail is made by someone who is totally foreign to this cocktail which is probably the explanation for why they don't even know to use pernod.  Our entrees arrive, my wife had the fish, and I the cavatelli.  Her fish was okay at best, small and quite overpriced.  My pasta was drowning in a sea of overly rich sausage cream sauce.  \\n\\nI was attracted to this establishment because of its asthetics, it gorgeous, but I can't eat them.  I also waited as I had heard from friends that bits and pieces of their experiences were good, but that the place was new so it's still trying to work out the kinks.  It still felt like a brand new restaurant, full of people who are brand new to the restaurant business.  They need to hire a FOH manager who can train the staff, because Austinites expect more from their dining establishment.  Also the kitchen needs to figure it out, from what we heard, to what we had, I doubt I would ever go back; unless for a bottle of nice wine and just to drink."},{"name":"JuiceLand","address":"7329 Burnet Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Ninja bachelor party is my addiction - the flavor is not always as consistent as I would like, but it's never been bad.  The daily specials seem pretty repetitive but are a decent value.  Sometimes I feel ridiculous for paying $10 for a big glass of juice, but then I compare the nutritional and health value to a $4 milkshake or $8 ice cream and it makes sense.  They have an interesting selection of vegan/vegetarian fare; their cookies tempt me every time.  Service is generally excellent."},{"name":"Kobe Japanese Steakhouse - Orlando","address":"5605 S Kirkman Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"I've been coming here forever. They recently remodeled, so its pretty nice in the Kirkman location. I love this place, except for the wait. Its a great place to come for group dining.

White sauce on everything!!"},{"name":"Felipe's Taqueria","address":"83 Mt Auburn St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Wow, I really like these burritos. I love them actually.  \\n\\nI don't know too much about what is and what isn't authentic Mexican food, but I do know that I love anything with spice and flavor. Thankfully, Felipes has a plethora of salsas that put their burritos over the edge. The salsa bar was love at first sight for me. I put just about everything on my grilled veggie super burrito, which was a nice vegetarian option with great grilled flavor. The other ingredients--rice, gauc, and standard salsa--were good but nothing to write home about. But those salsas, they really are awesome. \\n\\nFlavor makes me pick Felipe's over Chipotle in terms of favorite fast food Mexican in Boston. I haven't tried Anna's as of yet, so I can't say how they compare to Felipe's. Cheapness is also a big draw. Felipe's knows how to make one big, cheap and delicious burrito."},{"name":"Tasca Restaurant","address":"1612 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Brighton","stars":"4","text":"Service was above average and so was the food.  We ordered 10 items from the tapas menu.\\n\\nThe escargot was disappointing to everyone.  I liked 7 of the other nine items, and others at the table liked the two I didn't.\\n\\nThe one real down point was the wine.  Someone else at the table ordered (and tasted) the dry red wine.  Although the taste of the wine was fine, the temperature had to be in excess of 80 degrees.  This was the warmest red wine I have ever been served at any restaurant.  If I had been the one tasting, I would have sent it back and told them to put it in the freezer for a few minutes.  Even though I hate the idea of doing this to a good red wine, I was forced to take an ice cube from my water glass and put it in my wine glass."},{"name":"Cactus Club Cafe","address":"1085 Canada Place","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"My boyfriend and I went here while visiting Vancouver and loved it.

She pointed out an \\"open\\" neon light hung on a dark window and said that was it. Once we pushed opened the door, we were instantly greeted with warm welcomes.\\n\\nFood was great! We had the cold tofu with green onion and ginger. Was a great light starter. Then we moved onto the deep fried lotus root with shrimp. Excellent! The consistency and crunch were perfectly paired. Lastly, we ended out meal with tonkatsu curry. The curry packed a light kick and the pork was cooked well. Only downside was the pork was just slightly dry.\\n\\nService was excellent! Our water and tea cups were always filled."},{"name":"Piada Italian Street Food","address":"1315 W Lane Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"Took my 19 year old daughter to Piada for her first visit.  She is not a big Chipotle fan.  She noticed right away the similarity in the 2 concepts.  She tried the piada, and I had the pasta bowl.  Very fresh protein choices, great vegetable, lettuce options, all made to your order.  Nice clean atmosphere.  My daughter said it was really good food.  I agree!"},{"name":"Tasca Restaurant","address":"1612 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Brighton","stars":"4","text":"Tapas are one of my favorite types of food.  Tasca is a place to get decent tapas in the Allston-Brighton area.  \\n\\nI've been here several times and although the food is good, it just doesn't compare to Tapeo (or Dali or Solea, I've been told).  My favorite tapa dish and benchmark is the Garlic Shrimp and they're just okay here.  The garlic flavor doesn't come through as much as at Tapeo.  Same for the Goat Cheese Fritters with tomato.  However, the chicken croquettes and trio of sausage tapa are pretty darn tasty.   The sangria is also hit or miss.  Sometimes it's perfect and at other times, slightly watered down.\\n\\nTasca is a great date place, but beware in the winter.  It was freezing yesterday and those space heaters they have scattered throughout the restaurant aren't very helpful.  \\n\\nYou'll probably want to spring for the $6 valet parking as there is a lack of visitor parking in the neighborhood.  Otherwise, you can take the B line.\\n\\nI really think this place borders on 3-3.5 stars, but I am adding an extra star to make it four because the owners Dan and Kim have this great gift certificate program in place.  You can sell them on behalf of a school or other organization and a portion of the proceeds goes to the cause.  This was a unique way to raise almost $200 for one of the non-profits that I volunteer for . . .  I know they have also hosted fundraising events for Boston Cares.   Any establishment that is active in the community gets bonus points in my book!!!  Dan was a pleasure to work with too and sent our organization a check promptly."},{"name":"Tasca Restaurant","address":"1612 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Brighton","stars":"4","text":"How is it that I spent 4 years down the street for college, another 2.5 years living down the street in the other direction after college, and yet I never set foot in Tasca until now?\\n\\nIt's true that the location isn't the most convenient in the world if you live outside of the Allston/Brighton/Brookline area, but having now finally experienced it, I can say that it's well worth the trip. The atmosphere is warm and inviting, the sangria is delicious, the tapas portions are huge, and the menu is very reasonably priced. Particular highlights: the mushrooms with sherry cream and crostini, goat cheese empanadas, and short ribs with root vegetables and mashed potatoes. While we stuck to the sangria, the mini wine flights (for both red and white) looked like they offered some appealing options.\\n\\nGreat experience, and I will definitely make a point of going back."},{"name":"Carrabba's Italian Grill","address":"11590 Research Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"First time to a Carraba's and it was great.

My coffee was amazing.  I had the Butternut Latte with an extra shot of espresso.  It took about 5 minutes for it to get into my hand but was worth every second of waiting.  My entree was the egg basket and it was delicious with a side of bacon that was thickly sliced and extra crispy (as requested).  If you are need of a great cup of coffee, good breakfast, and some Austin nostalgia then head over to Austin Java.  It is true that parking seems hard here, but I've had good luck nearly every time with parking in the front lot facing Lamar.

That's okay, I want them to take a little time to do it right.  And they did okay.  I had my usual baseline Chinese test items: crab Rangoon and Mongolian beef (well, okay, neither are really Chinese, in name or origin, but they give me some idea of how a place does things.)  The Rangoons were frozen, but decent- cooked up fresh, with a few pieces of \\"krab\\" in them, not just cheese.  The Mongolian beef was a very solid version- plenty of beef, decent quality, with lots of onions and green onions.  The sauce was flavorful, not too salty, and just right for pouring on rice.  I got fried rice, which turned out to be an oddity: yellow, but not really fried, and with just some onions and sprouts mixed in.  Not a fan.  \\n\\nThe menu is the typical Chinese-American standards; I didn't see an \\"authentic\\" menu.  For decent Chinese food, mainly to-go, this is a good neighborhood joint.  Clean, comfy enough.  Slightly brusque service, but they were busy with takeout orders.  Flimsy forks, canned pop.  Not worth much of a detour, but satisfying."},{"name":"Nar Mediterranean Grill","address":"3402 Technological Ave, Ste 112","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"The manager is super nice and friendly and the food is great.

I just didn't feel it had that pop of flavours,  that a real top quality place has. \\n\\nI had the eggs Benny and french toast, both very average. French toast was just lacking something. It was a bit dry. I didn't like the ham on the Benedict, it too lacked in a pop of flavours. If I could have a do over, I would have asked for normal bacon. I personally think they need a good chef to come in and just give their place a menu facelift, add that touch, that special flavourful touch that really makes a breakfast joint standout."},{"name":"Nayar Taqueria","address":"5919 SE Foster Rd","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"This place is wonderful!!

From the staff, to the wine, to the starter, all the way through the meal. \\n\\nWe started with a bottle of Tuscan red wine from that was $44 per bottle and worth every penny. Then we got the crab dip as a starter which I cannot recommended enough. Our waiter, Patrick, who was so sweet recommended the trout and the bbq shrimp. We decided to trust him and we're so glad we did. The bbq shrimp was spicy, but it's a very manageable, slow burn. The trout was cooked to perfection! Unfortunately, I'm one of the 14% of the population who, when eating cilantro, it only tastes like soap and the trout is loaded with cilantro. HOWEVER, the trout, carrots, and granola are cooked so perfectly, that for once the cilantro soapy taste didn't effect the integrity of the dish at all, and that's saying something!! I mentioned in passing to Patrick that they maybe should mention the cilantro in the menu and he asked several times if I was sure I didn't want to send it back. No way was I sending jt back regardless!

They have a very spacious & clean dining area, but it's usually pretty empty.  And though staff is typically friendly, the service & kitchen are SLOW.  As in 45+ minutes for food to be served.  I've tried the drive through another 4 times on top of dining in, and again wait 10-15 minutes before your order is even taken.  Call ahead maybe?  Same results, close to an hour for food to be packaged. It's within manager's hands to make improvements rather easily just by increasing kitchen staff.  Aren't items like brisket, pork & ribs slow cooked for hours in advance?  So why does it still take so long to serve?  And honestly, you run out of ribs more often than you should considering it is a signature menu item.  My experiences are more favorable at the Winter Park location, perhaps that location manager can give you tips how to keep things moving along, and you can serve & sell more food per night?

This time we chose to dine at Carthage Cafe.  Needless to say, an evening with my Queen was second to none, but the food at Carthage was not...\\n\\n*Something worth noting, because it was Valentines day we were given no choice but to have the set menu (which was a tad odd).  We only found out about this once we sat down (this could have been comunicated to us when we made the reservation).  Nonetheless, we were there and the ambiance was nice so we decided to order some appys and split a set menu.\\n\\nThings started off nice, we had:\\n\\n- Morroccan Tea - (nice warm Rosewater type beverage.  Had two of them).\\n- The Mussels (appys not on the set menu.  Pretty good, in a tasty blue cheese cream sauce)\\n\\nThen things went downhill from there.  We proceeded with the set menu (ie: had to order)\\n\\n- The Butternut Squash Soup (mediocre)\\n- Escargot ( it never came for some reason )\\n- Veal with whipped mashed potatoes and a few veggies ( Veal was leather & we make better mash at home)\\n-Upside down apple tart with ice cream (not bad - not great).\\n\\nBill came to $145 with Tip. Yup, that's no booze.\\n\\nHonestly, our favourite thing about this place was the ambiance.  Cozy, pleasant and what a romantic restaurant should be.  Mussels werent bad either, but we couldnt just order those and we were frowned upon for asking.  We had to order off the set menu, which was a HUGE mistake because the cooking wasnt good (we cook a better piece of meat at home for a 1/4 of the price and twice as thick - like butter in your mouth).  \\n\\nTalk about overpriced and to boot we didnt even get all of it!

The outside seating area looks like a cafeteria; then I went inside and the ambiance was pleasant and all I could think was that the food was going to be amazing. I was right. The food was excellent! I sat by the sushi bar and saw how my sushi was prepared which was a wonderful quick show. Had some nigiri, the Marilyn Mon-Roll and the Road Runner Roll - both of them were excellent. I was tired from being in meetings all day and wanted to eat dessert, but I wanted to bring it back to the hotel and eat it in bed. The hotel was about five minutes away from the restaurant, so I decided to order the tempura ice cream. They refused to make it to go. They kept saying that it would melt too fast and that they didn't want me to eat something that wasn't served the right way. I kept telling them that I was five minutes away and that it was okay if it melted a bit. They had to speak to a manager and the manager refused as well. The waitress approached me and said they could make it for me but that I had to eat a few bites in the restaurant first and then they could pack it up for me. WHAT? I get it! It's ice cream and ice cream melts if you don't eat it right away. I was okay with that. I was so confused and disappointed. I ended up ordering Tiramisu with a Japanese flare. I ordered it to go. They didn't have plastic hardware either. They said they don't usually have to go orders. The Tiramisu was just alright. They really shouldn't say NO to a customer.

Nothing special and a little boring.\\n\\nI thought the egg sandwich was pretty good.  The piece of ham was nice and thick.  The home fries were good and the colorful mixed veggies were a nice touch to the dish.\\n\\nThe total came to $12 which was about the same price as Mike's City Diner and The Paramount considering the added cost of blueberries in the pancakes would have brought the total near $14.\\n\\nThe place is run by a hard working immigrant family (legal I'm sure) which is always nice to see.  I found the service (which is the wife) to be good where everything came out exactly as I ordered and it came out fast.\\n\\nI found the tables and booth layout to be very efficient where everyone had enough room to relax.

The crab rangoons are delectable and I've sometimes pretended to want to eat dinner just so I can have them as an appetizer. They recently updated the decor downstairs and it's a major improvement. I usually order the hot basil rice w/ chicken and it's always fresh and fantastic. In fact, everything I've ordered has been great!\\n\\nI never expect great things from the service though. 'Nuf said. It's never been terrible. Just not great. Sometimes weird. \\n\\nThe comedy club is...AWESOME! \\n\\nWord to the wise: if going on the weekend you must must must reserve (you can do this online). That way you can get a table seat and not be stuck trolling for one of the uncomfortable chairs in the back. Table seats are really close to the stage, though, and so if you don't want to be a part of the show you should request to be put in the middle or the back of those seats. \\n\\nIt's open Wednesday through Sunday, I think. You should check out their website to be sure. On Tuesdays they do a magic show. My fiance went said it as pretty good. I've never been. \\n\\nRick Jenkins owns it and is the host. I've been there enough I could probably deliver his jokes for him, but he always cracks me up. He's a super nice guy and totally helpful w/ the reservations and any questions you got. \\n\\nThe comedy is always on its game. They've got some regulars I don't find too funny, but you never know. No accountin' for taste. \\n\\nBathrooms are a little sketchy. Kinda so you can't tell if they're clean. But to be honest everything else about the place is so awesome I can't really dwell here.\\n\\nBest part is you can eat chinese food while you watch the show. Fresh from downstairs. Pretty awesome.

I went back to the hostress and by this time she was pissed off and demanded us to sit down as the manager will be here 'shortly'. \\n\\nI feel strongly disturbed by her behaviour and wanted to vein my frusturation out on her. It seemed the manager was nowhere to be seen and finally showed up after 30 minutes ( later found out he was doing deliveries). My girlfriend voiced her frusturation of the way we were treated and the dissatisfaction of her dinner. The manager agreed to comp her dinner and was apologetic of the pitful service we encountered. \\n\\nJust think twice before you come here because if you want good service, then forget about this place, you will be pulling your hair out like weed as there are much better place to choose from!"},{"name":"Leonardo's Pizzeria","address":"16505 SE 1st St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Best friggin' pizza in Vancouver.....period.

Motomachi is a tiny place with maybe 20 seats, but the atmosphere has a Japanese Charm that makes you feel comfy and welcomed.  The servers are super nice as well.  The prices are a bit higher than Kintaro, but not by much and the lines are considerably shorter.  We had the classic spicy chicken ramen and the Charcoal ramen.  Both were excellent.  The spicy chicken had a wide assortment of crunchy vegis and a broth with a little kick to go with the fresh ramen.  It was very light and refreshing.  The charcoal ramen had a very rich bold flavor and felt like a more stick to your bones dish.  The Japanese have been very keen on the health benefits of charcoal products and this dish fits right in.  The noodles for both dishes were quite good-perfectly cooked with a little snap with each bite.  Nothing worse than mushy ramen and this place certainly doesn't do that.

The bags do not have any ticket attached to the outside with the customers name and what was ordered so it's no surprise that I don't receive what I order and pay for.  When I arrived home, some of the Mirza (eggplant dish-it was not spreadable and was in large pieces) had spilled out of the container into the bag, some salad dressing had leaked and rice had spilled out as well.  Everything was very poorly packed.  I call to speak with a manager the next day about the bad experience and an associate tells me the manager is busy and can't speak with me.  I brief the associate about my poor experience with the wrong order and leaked food and he was rude and didn't care to hear about what went wrong.  I speak to him how the packing of the food needs be improved so the food is still in the containers and not spilled into the bag when traveling and he hung up the phone on me.  I was appalled.  I hope the owner sees this review because he needs to know how his wait staff is treating customers and the poor service that is being delivered from his restaurant.  Reading other reviews with similar problems lets me know that getting the food out as cheaply as possible and not sending what is ordered is how this restaurant operates.  \\"To Go\\" orders need to be checked before leaving the counter and then held while traveling or you will have a mess on your hands.

I ordered the Vegetable Platter at $16+ and my husband ordered the Shrimp + Scallops. I could see why his was priced in that range, it was marinated and the shrimp were clearly prepped and very clean. But $16 for a plate of sliced veggies I am cooking myself?

We were seated at one of the big tables near the bar. Just the right size for an intimate dinner of friends.\\n\\nFirst thing to mention is how pleasant it was to work with Jason the owner. Over the phone he conveyed that sense of a person wanting you as a customer. That is a skill that many can learn but you can tell when a person is a natural. Jason is a natural host.\\n\\nJason was glad to make the reservation for us. He was comfortable with the size of the party changing and made it easy to communicate with him when the party increased in size. The restaurant also welcomed us to bring a cake and offered to keep it on the prep table. They provided knife and a candle (what's a birthday cake without a candle?). Jason and his staff were perfectly accommodating.\\n\\nThe food was spot on. Roasted chicken which was moist and flavorsome. Crispy skin. The rumblethump cake (a fantastic name) was tasty and satisfying. The seafood appetizer was beautiful and could take you to a Scottish stream fishing for salmon. Two guests were vegetarian. The vegetarian option was several side dishes. But a side dish is just a name. The combination made for a beautiful presentation, variety of flavors and satisfaction of a good meal.\\n\\nOne guest had the haggis. Based on his opinion I may try haggis next time I visit. That goes for the Scottish deviled eggs. As the saying goes in for a penny in for a pound. The white pudding sassitch and mash also looked awfully good. \\n\\nOne thing that separates a fine neighborhood restaurant from others is the atmosphere. There are so many factors that go into an atmosphere, including music, lighting and layout. Here the music was never too loud and sometimes may have stopped altogether. That alone raises the stock of this restaurant. Understanding that guests are not there to hear music but to enjoy a meal and each other. To enjoy each other guests need to converse and sometimes just enjoy the companionable quiet of each other's company. So many restaurants refuse to respect that. The Haven understands this (although they do have events so check out their website to see if there is a event going on). The lighting is comfortable and the overall ambience is spot on.\\n\\nAdding to a perfect night was the fact that rain poured through the day. So The Haven took on more meaning by giving us a haven from a rainy windy day. \\n\\nA friend described The Haven as comforting that is just a little bit exotic. JP is lucky to have such a comfortable and fine restaurant. Once in a while we get to enjoy an experience where all the factors come together in perfect proportion. A rainy day, a warm inviting haven of good food, good company all creating a sweet, satisfying and memorable meal. That described my first meal at The Haven."},{"name":"The New York Pizza Company","address":"3158 Bill Beck Blvd","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"3.5","text":"Aye what do you want?

Indeed, as I write this, I am sitting at a little desk from Ikea, drinking wine out of a glass from Ikea. So, given my positive experience, I decided to buy a mattress and box spring from Ikea - something that would need to be delivered.\\n\\nI went to Ikea having done my research and narrowed my decision down to two mattresses. I went alone, thinking that customer service would be able to help me if needed.\\n\\nHere's where it went wrong:\\n\\n-The woman in the mattress section told me delivery cost $59 for the mattress I was buying. It was $69.\\n-To purchase the mattress, I had to put it on a cart and bring it through the till. Not a big deal, but there was only one of me, so I needed help getting the mattress on the cart. The guy working in the furniture \\"self-serve\\" section was blatantly pissed off about having to help me, and told me to \\"wait over there\\" while he chatted with his friend. I could hear them. They weren't talking about work. (Tall, skinny, blonde guy with longish, greasy looking hair. Avoid him.) After I \\"waited over there\\" for a while, I went back and asked again. *Loooong sigh* he came to help me load the mattresses.\\n-I then proceeded to navigate the cart with the mattress and box spring, alone, to the till. Notice again the one person, one set of eyes challenge. I was clearly struggling, and would have very much appreciated help at this point. \\n-Till closed while I was in line. No explanation. Proceed to move mattress and box spring to another till.\\n-Delivery. Here's where I learn the cost was $10 more than anticipated. BUT, they could deliver after work, between 5 and 9 pm. Great - I'll pay $69 + HST for that. \\n-Day of delivery. 11 am. While I'm at work, I get a call saying they are outside my house with the mattress. The Ikea dispatcher had messed up the order and given it to the delivery guys too early. Of course I can't accept it at this time. I ask \\"Can they deliver it later?\\" Maybe.\\n-Maybe!? I called Ikea themselves, and they guarantee that the mattress will be delivered between 5 and 9 pm.\\n-4:55 PM (note: NOT between 5 and 9) - I've rushed home from work to find the delivery guys in my hallway. They've disturbed my building manager to get inside. Here's the thing - I don't blame them. The IKEA DISPATCHERS made them wait outside for 6 hours. I was mortified at having been the cause of this, and angry at Ikea for having such a blatantly we-don't-give-a-f*ck attitude. \\n\\nClearly, poor customer service and a blatant disrespect towards employees and suppliers is endemic within the organization. Sure, I got my mattress fine. Will I ever buy something big from Ikea again? Not a chance. Overall, it was a terrible experience."},{"name":"Kobe Japanese Steakhouse - Orlando","address":"5605 S Kirkman Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"It was my wife's birthday on Sunday and we decided to try Kobe Steakhouse. We looked on Yelp for the best one and I think we found it. The Kobe on Kirkman road was quite possibly the best Japanese steakhouse we've ever been to. We got there for the Sunday specials that start at noon, and were promptly seated. The drinks, soup, and salad were paced nicely, even with 3 joiners to the table, no one felt rushed or too slow. Then the show began. Our chef was very good at what he does. He was throwing knives and food all over the place. He cracked jokes, and not just the typical \\"egg roll\\" one. He really interacted with our table, which is very nice because the last one that we went to the chef was watching the soccer game the whole time. There was too much food for all of us to eat so when the show was over the server actually grabbed each plate and boxed it up individually, which I thought was nice. Like I said, we went on Sunday, so there were lunch specials AND it was my wife's birthday and they give $15 off for birthdays. We ended up walking out for $30 after a pretty hefty tip(worth all of it). The only thing I didn't like is their sushi chef didn't work until five o'clock, so no sushi for us.

I found a few things I liked and I've stuck with them.  Also, I'm a vegetarian, so I don't do fish.  But, there are four reasons I love this place: 1) The harvest roll is a roll made with rice paper instead of nori, fried mango, avocado, cream cheese and topped with mango sauce and sriracha (It's seasonal, but they made it for me tonight!).  It is delicious!  2) The creamy asparagus roll, which has asparagus and cream cheese is also delish.  3) Inari!!! Inari is a pouch of sweet fried tofu stuffed with rice.  I fell in love with inari on a trip to Japan and this it the only Japanese restaurant I know that has it around here.  4) The patio!  Sure it's not open right now, but when it is, I love to sit outside to enjoy my sushi in the warmth with the koi pond and the sounds of trickling water.  Haiku also has a great decor inside, including one of those cool tables at ground level, but with a big hole for your feet, so you have the fun of sitting at a Japanese style table, but you save your knees.  However, I took one star off because every time I've been to Haiku, I am overwhelmed by the stinky fish smell, which I hear is not a good thing (fresh fish shouldn't stink)."},{"name":"Rocket Breakfast","address":"5235 NE Sandy Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"Rocket is probably the best breakfast one can buy on the west coast.

The first trip was spontaneous; the hubby was taking his Scottish-American friend out for a bday meal.  I popped in to wish him well just as they were being served their haggis and sausage, so I got a wee taste of both their dishes. The haggis was lovely. Our friend, who has had many a haggis, said it was delicious, though not as spicy as he would've liked it. Jason said, \\"let us know next time you're coming in; we'll spice it up for you.\\"  That's the kind of guy he is; a very professional barman and restauranteur. Always says hello and goodbye. He's very attentive (we like to sit at the bar) and eager to please, wanting to know how you like one beer, or suggesting another.  The hubby's sausage was wicked flavorful.  This past trip, he order the burger -ginormous! Very flavorful with the onions etc...it's the type of burger that you need two hands and several napkins to eat it with. Its also the type of burger that is hard to put down because it is so juicy and delightfully messy that you think, \\"why bother? I'm just gonna get filthy all over again!\\"  The home cut fries, which my husband could not finish (a first!) were also outstanding.   My dish, the Tikka Masala (invented in a Glasgow Indian restaurant) was dee-vine.

I ate here on the 22nd of september and I had a very horrible experience.

Went into first door and waitress did greet\\n-we told waitress that we were planning to order food and we had a groupon which she said we could sit anywhere and even suggested the roof top. we decided to sit at the rooftop because volume of bar/dining area was too loud(mix of music and tv). we got to the rooftop and the waitress tells us after about drink specials that we can't order food up there(after being told we could less than 5 minutes ago). My friend gets her margarita (which was really weak) and we head back downstairs. We sit at the patio furniture and had to try to signal someone for service. We asked what she recommended and she couldn't tell us. She had literally just started working that day and was trained by someone else the day prior. We ordered the chicken skewers and two lamb burgers with fries. Our chicken skewer was one single chicken skewer and it was uncooked chicken!!! We immediately told them and my friend(who is a doctor) was just sickened by it. They gave her a free drink to compensate and another appetizer. We got the feta plate which was served on a sad little tiny dish. Looked like an after thought. Our food was served on what looked like cafeteria trays. My friends burger was a bit overcooked...while my burger was completely charred, no seasoning, and bloody grease coming out. I didn't even bother to try to finish eating..it was horrible. The chef came out with another skewer and apologized but we didn't even touch it. We also had one of the owners come up and ask us about our food. In which i gave my opinion and was thus told that i should of eaten their gyros. they are much better. Well, last time i checked when you put food on a menu it should be held all to the same standards and be good!! don't put it their if its not the best you can do!!!\\n\\nAlso, the owner should really stick to one thing. the lounge up on top, the patio, the bar/dining area do not work at all. The entire time we sat there, we saw a bunch of people confused on what to do, where to go and especially stairs for roof top aren't labeled. One last thing, the dress code for the waitresses was horrible. Not everyone can wear short shorts. And I don't feel it is appropriate. It just looked trashy especially when your building conveys that they would seem to be better dressed than that. \\n\\nIt is not a repeat and be aware you could get food poisoning!

A decent amount of people dining but we got seated immediately.  The waiter was friendly, funny, quirky guy who took care of us the entire dinner.\\n\\nMenu was ok, nothing out of the ordinary, kudos for using \\"local\\" Berkshire meat.

First taste....well the meat was a big letdown!  Looked good, fairly tender but tasteless.  I could see the pink smoke ring but couldn't taste it?  Dry rub? Where? on the meat?   Both the pulled pork & brisket were tasteless.  So tasteless meat, throw some sauce on it.  Nope, the sauces didn't do it for us.  BBQ was a bit too tomatoe-y, ketchup-y for our liking.  The vinegar \\"North Carolina\\" sauce was tangy as the waiter said, but not that good.  The hot sauce was hot with no taste.  Sides were ok, not bad but we've had better.

There wasn't anything special to these at all to me...\\n- Mussels:  Read even better reviews and these tasted almost like they tried too hard to make it fancy.  Whatever happened to \\"keep it simple stupid\\"?  A little white wine, some garlic and butter and bam, they would have been just fine, perhaps even better...\\n\\nMain Course\\n- Scallops:  I had told my wife I had read that the portion sizes were small.  To our surprise the appetizers, though I personally wasn't a huge fan, we're actually quite good with regards to portion size...  Then came out her scallops.  This review is receiving 3 stars instead of a 2 because I have to admit the scallops were pretty good.  But because of the portion size, could leave you craving for more.  Now don't me wrong and think that I am looking for a gigantic family style course at what appeared to be an upper end restaurant, but for the price of the meal I would have expected more than 4 or 5 pieces.\\n\\n- Sole Fish:  Had read the best reviews bar none about this dish.  Our server even sold it to me as the best meal on their menu.  Some other guy's review I had read saying \\"I would leave soiling myself in joy after eating...\\"  not even close.  The fish itself was good but nothing spectacular.  If you can afford some cheap tilapia, butter and some breadcrumbs, then you can pretty much mimic this dish.  It is not my intent to bash this dish or the place, just what I had read and heard hyped it so much that maybe I came to expect more.\\n\\nDrinks\\nOne word:  Amazing.

I like kids, but I don't always want to hear them while I am trying to enjoy a fabulous meal. \\n\\nWe started with cocktails and saganaki (which I call Opa cheese).

Outside of my time in Chennai,  I have only been to a handful of places this tasty. \\n\\nWe arrived late in a Tuesday evening -  last ones in before they closed the doors.  We ordered 3 items: fish tikka,  saag paneer and navratan korma.  These are very basic dishes,  usually OK but predictable and without distinct personalities. \\n\\nWhoa!  Not at Haveli!  The saag had a velvety richness borne of much ghee and a fine melange of spices.   The paneer was firm,  yielding to the teeth without falling into powdery mush. \\n\\nNavratan Korma is a coworker's favorite but,  truthfully,  a dish I usually avoid.  Too often,  the veggies come from a frozen food bag,  the sauce is sweet tastelessness and the cashews stand out like a bag of nuts was accidentally dumped into the pot at the end of the cooking.  At Haveli,  each bite yielded complex flavors,  a mix of veggies all cut so as to blend and never deposit its lone character on the tongue. There was one ingredient that was clearly a vegetable, or maybe fruit, yet I would swear,  by texture, was chicken.  A fine mystery. \\n\\n\\"Fish tikka\\" - what an unassuming name for succulent swordfish in a stunning melange of spices.  We tried in vain to identify the flavors.   In the end,  we exchanged a lovely conversation with the chef.   I learned I would never have identified  mix of mustard oil and two or three varieties of mustard seed that formed an ephemeral basis of a flavor that tickled my senses then vanished to reveal the succulence of perfect swordfish. \\n\\nTwo stars?

What is it that has business owners thinking that their customers have unlimited funds, and, therefore, should contribute to their employee's salaries?  Their website's explanation for the fee pits the FOH (waiters) against the BOH (line cooks, dishwashers. . .), stating that FOH salaries are much higher because of tipping.  The explanation is written to make the reader feel for the low paid BOH, which it does, but I'm sorry Tiffany, your employee salaries are your business, and your customers should never be burdened with (or made to feel guilty about) your inability to pay them a fair wage.  I'm just floored that you would even consider it appropriate, so, with that said, I won't be returning, and I urge others to to do the same (I know, but what about your addiction to those biscuits. . .).

No question. I usually order a double mushroom or a bacon and mushroom and there is nothing like it. The crust is thin, the cheese tastes like cheese, and the toppings are distributed quite well. The only issue is the cutting style. It's a circular pizza but not cut into wedges but a combo of parallel and perpendicular lines. \\n\\nThe salad is good, but a bit oily. You have to eat all of it because it does not keep like the pizza. The sandwiches are okay, but nothing I would order again. The menu has other \\"Italian\\" style foods, but it's a pizza place. Get the pizza.\\n\\nThe staff is pleasant at the counter. When I bring my kids in to pick up a pizza they give them pepperoni slices, which they think is \\"awesome\\".

I've had breakfast here a half dozen times, and dinner once. For breakfast I lean towards the sweet stuff, mainly the short stack strawberry pancakes. If you can handle all the food the toast is a great accompanying item. The jam is different every time. I'm generally not a fan of jam or jelly, and I usually don't do more than try it because I don't need more sweet with the pancakes, but the jam is always great. There are days I wish I just had two orders of toast, one with jam and one without. I have also had the scrambles, which are great as well. My wife prefers these. For dinner I had a special pesto pasta dish that was amazing.\\n\\nThe line can get long. There are complaints that the staff is slow. I have not found that to be the case. They are extremely friendly, so maybe that slows them down a bit, but that's a good trade off in my opinion. If you go at off-times (I sometimes go there on weekday mornings) you'll have your food ordered and in front of you in record time.\\n\\nI'll add that I'm gluten and dairy free, which is a contributing reason to why I like Harlow so much, but I'd go here even if I wasn't.

They kept  the decor pretty simple with darker more subtle tones and lower lighting for a taste of slightly refined ambiance. \\n\\nNormally I hit up Mozart's brunch menu, but with a new location I wanted to switch it up, so I ordered a chicken schnitzel sandwich. It was A-OK, but nothing to write home about. I have to say though... I was VERY disappointed with their potato salad.. It lacked any kind of flavor and the potatoes were just off. It wasn't the best I've ever had. \\n\\nLuckily for Mozart's their delicious desserts saved the meal. Their Moonlight Sonata Cake is really delicious. I highly recommend it for chocolate lovers and even for the not-so chocolate lovers, because it's not overly rich. The Vanilla cake in between sets it off perfectly. \\n\\nAlso their Marzipan is some of the best in Columbus! You really MUST give it a try!\\n\\nService was good, quick and efficient, but nothing overly remarkable.\\n\\nThe thing I really like about Mozart's is that it's a place where you can come in looking UBER nice, or you can come in fairly casual and you won't be judged. Don't let the pretentious look of the place and piano scare you off...  It just has that Clintonville easy going vibe. \\n\\nAs much as I would LOVE to give Mozart's a four or five star review..

I'm in Short North all the time and have been to just about every restaurant surrounding this place, but for some reason, I just never gave it a shot. Well, I was craving sushi the other night and as tempting as Akai Hana is every time I want sushi, the girlfriend and I decided to try something new. It was pouring raining and thunder and lightning, so we had to deal with that walking from the Hub garage. \\n\\nNote: It costs $5 for valet parking in the parking lot next to Haiku; although I'm not sure why, since they don't do anything. It'll cost you less to just park at The Hub parking garage right across the street.\\n\\nI always knew they had a huge patio, and it's partially covered, so you can actually eat out there during the rain, but I had no idea how large the inside of the place was. We were seated at a table toward the back, and our server was incredibly nice and helpful. \\n\\nI started off with the hot and sour lobster soup and a spring roll. The broth of the soup was pretty tasty, but the lobster pieces were pretty small and didn't add much to the dish. The girlfriend and I both liked the spring rolls.\\n\\nFor the main course, we went with with two of the specialty rolls and a spicy tuna roll. One was the Urban Meyroll (so clever), and I forget the name of the other, since it's not normally on the menu. They all were really good and fresh. The spicy tuna roll was one of the better ones I've had in Columbus, and the salmon on the other rolls was great as well. As far as the sushi alone, Haiku way exceeded my expectations.\\n\\nThis is a great place for a date, and all of the employees I encountered, were very nice and welcoming.

I think the general idea is great, but after all the raves on Yelp and other sites, I feel like the expectations were set much too high for what I got.\\n\\nAs people have mentioned, it's basically the Chipotle model applied to Italian food (though the freshly made piada dough is a little firmer and crunchier than a burrito wrap). You decide if you want the namesake wrap, a salad, or pasta, then pick your meats, sauce, and a mix of sauteed and fresh veggies. If you get the piada, they'll also put a little bit of pasta into the wrap. \\n\\nI've been twice, once at dinner hour, and once closer to lunchtime. On the good side, they're doing great business - the line was almost out the door both times I went in. The downside is the staff seems to be trying to push people through their line as quickly as possible, and as a result I felt rushed when trying to order, and I've noticed that the actual wrapping of the Piada can range from \\"OK, but a little loose\\" to \\"Total structural collapse as soon as you take it out of the foil.\\" Be mindful and open up the foil wrapper with care. I've also noticed that the saucing can get...interesting. Sometimes it's been added evenly so you get the flavor through the whole wrap, and sometimes it seems to be concentrated at the bottom.\\n\\nA little more attention to detail would go a LONG way here.\\n\\nFor side items, the fried calamari with slices of battered hot peppers is a nice side idea, but the dipping sauce it comes with tastes more like cocktail sauce than anything special, and the stuffed \\"piada sticks\\" are a neat variation on breadsticks, stuffed with pepperoni, veg, or cheeses, but the \\"Parmesan dipping sauce\\" they come with basically tastes like a big cup of salty salad dressing. I think it would be better if they offered a warm cup of one of their pasta sauces instead.\\n\\nMy last complaint is that the piadas seem -really- greasy. I expected some grease when I ordered an Italian Sausage wrap. I really was unpleasantly surprised to taste just as much grease when I ordered  chicken instead the next time I was in.\\n\\nI realize Piada is fairly new, and it's a learning experience for everyone involved, but all things considered, there are a lot more misses than hits for me.

I *like* Starbucks. I go there when I want tea and free wi-fi to check email. If you want Diesel to be normal, go across the street to Starbucks. Or down the street to Mr. Crepe. \\n\\nHowever... Diesel.\\n\\nDiesel, like many other independently-owned coffee shops everywhere, has a niche. It serves thoughtful, vegan- and restriction-friendly food alongside a large selection of coffee and tea. I don't drink coffee, so I go there for my Somerville Smog (Earl Grey latte) and other sundry libations. I go there for yummy breakfast bagels. And, when I'm feeling stressed, the occasional cookie. But I REALLY go to Diesel to find and hang out with people I know. Or to work in an atmosphere that, while unabashedly strong in its hipster-fu, is welcoming and familiar. You know, like a version of Cheers, but where Norm would be a queer, fashionable artist who likes to sketch robots wearing Hawaiian print bondage gear. \\n\\nWhat I'm saying is that Diesel is not for everybody. But Diesel is Diesel (witty, no?). \\n\\nI have always had a good (slightly expensive) sandwich at Diesel. I've always felt a friendly vibe from the staff there. A disproportionate number of people at Diesel set up camp for several hours, often one single person per booth (I've been glared at when I asked the person to share). Obviously, this takes up space that could be used for customers who would pay for a meal and offer the space more profit-generating turnover. But I'm guessing Diesel's staff is comfortable with this dynamic; otherwise, there would be signs (like Panera Bread) indicating that people working on laptops should engage in nice-nice. \\n\\nDiesel's legacy is a welcoming place for GLBT-friendly groups to meet, for artists to network, and for people to gather in a familial environment. To this end, Diesel is perfect. However, as a coffee shop and cafe, it's often far too crowded and loud to enjoy a meal. Thankfully, Davis Square has many other options, but I like to sit in a place where, on any given day, I might run into people I know or strike up a conversation with a woman who makes art out of used tea bags.\\n\\nI love Diesel.

Not much of a selection for salads...nothing bad, just your solid fare. But they did have a fish special that night that sounded amazing.\\nSo I order the fish special. \\nHere is where the night turns...i never got the fish dish. I waited for over 20 minutes until the bartender noticed that I haven't received my order. He went back to the kitchen and returned, saying it would be only a few minutes. I waited at least another 5 minutes before I just cancelled my order. Pretty ridiculous since the guys sitting next to me got their burger in less than 10 minutes. \\nNow, I do not know if the bartender forgot to order the dish or the kitchen lost the order. But a bummer for a place I use to frequent quite a bit when I lived in Area 4.\\nAnyway, I am giving 3 stars. The bartender was fairly nice and pretty good service. The beer was good. Too bad the dinner did not come out though because I already had a beer in mind for dessert. The bartender ended up comp-ing my beers so I tipped $10 for the service and beer. Not that I will avoid the place, but there are better places that I will go out of my way for.\\nThe positive out of this negative is that I was hungry and headed to Emma's Pizza (see my review on Emma's)."},{"name":"Buffalo Wild Wings","address":"2860 Cumberland Mall SE, Ste 1630","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2","text":"First of all I love Buffalo Wild Wings more than life.

Also saw they had the usuals: IPA (which is fantastic, btw), 420 Pale Ale, Blue (the wife likes this one) and a summer seasonal called Road Trip.

I have never give such a low rating before, either.  To begin, I had been really wanting to try this place out since it opened.  So, my friends and I made reservations for 8 of us at 7:00 pm on Saturday evening during Atlanta Pride.  We arrived on time and were seated outside on the patio.  Our server came to our table, immediately, and took our drink and appetizer orders.  Some people ordered wine and four of us had a special vodka drink in a glass that would light up with various colors.  The wine and appetizers came out in a reasonable time, but the server brought out four Moscow Mules, which was wrong.  A friend told the server that it was wrong and had a bit of an attitude about it.  We were all very clear about what we had wanted with me specifically saying I wanted the drink that lights up.  Then, it took a good 20 minutes or so to get the correct drinks.  By that time, it was 7:30 pm.  For appetizers, we had the cheese and meat tray (Good) as well as the garlic bread (OK).  So, we decided to order our dinners (at 7:30 pm).  Two people ordered spaghetti (Good), four people ordered various pizzas (Good) and two of us ordered calzones.  So, about 45 minutes later, the spaghetti only comes out.  During this time, our server had come nowhere near our table and was very absent the whole time.   There were so many periods of no contact that it was very frustrating.  The pizzas came out about 15 minutes after the spaghetti.  This puts us at 8:30 pm, 1 hour after ordering our entrees.  Next, the first calzone came out another 15 minutes later, 1 hour and 15 minutes after ordering.  One friend had become frustrated and went to the bar to ask for the manager twice.   The manager came out on the second visit and spoke to him and apologized, but not convincingly.  My friend said the manager was in the kitchen rolling dough.  The first calzone was mine and it was the four cheese calzone.  It was not even good.  I had never had such a bad calzone, ever.  Then, the last calzone came out another 15 minutes later.  I'm not sure which calzone he had, but he was so over it by that point that he just asked for a to go box since it was so late.  He told me the next day that the calzone was not good, at all.  For the bill, we had 8 different cards for 1 bill, so I expected it to take a minute.  Then, he brings the bills for each card, drops it off with 1 pen.  I really do not like it when servers do that.  It's so inconvenient.  There were several tables around us experiencing the same problem.  I saw several tables sitting there for 45+ minutes and nothing but water.  And, I saw one table get up and talk to the server about not receiving anything and being so slow.  This was honestly the worst restaurant experience I have ever had in my life.  There were so many issues with the evening that I will never be back and I would not recommend anyone to ever go there."},{"name":"Sweet Cheeks Q","address":"1381 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Adding to my review.

Marriage of that length for relatively young whippersnappers is something of importance, and I thought (due to my previous experience with the restaurant during a friend's bachelor party) that Haiku would work well for this.  It didn't let me down.\\n\\nJenn had gone into the evening expecting and hoping for Thai food, which wasn't something Haiku's menu necessarily caters to, being generally of the Japanese and pan-Asian persuasion.  I admit that I may have fudged on details a bit to get her in the car and through the door of the place, but I knew she'd like it.  When I pulled into the parking lot at 6:30PM (on a Wednesday), there was a valet (sort of) in place to take my keys and park my car.  He was actually sitting in his car, and as I'm honestly not too used to such extensive parking treatment, I simply parked the ol' RAV-4 myself.  He then took my keys, and handed me the ticket, leaving me wondering what I should do to actually get those keys back at the end of the night (you can see how much of a valet novice I really am).  Once inside, we were quickly seated by a friendly hostess in the main dining room.  At that time of the evening, the dining room only featured a few other couples (and I do mean 'featured' - more on that to come), and we settled back to enjoy your time.  Our waitress (I apologize for crappy memory with names) was friendly and informative, answering my wife's questions about the menu with grace and aplomb.  \\n\\nTo begin with, I ordered us the lettuce wraps (seasoned chicken, lettuce, vegetables & hoisin sauce - $8.50) and two bowls of the miso soup ($5.00 total).  Wrapping the chicken and veggies in the lettuce was both fun and delicious (making us question why we don't use this approach to sandwiches more often), and the miso was, as before, absolutely wonderful.  We followed the appetizers by ordering the Kani Su Crab (crab, cucumbers & seaweed seasoned with vinegar - $7.50) and the Spider Roll (soft shell crab, avocado, cucumber & masago - $7.95).  I'm admittedly not a crab connoisseur, so I have no idea whether or not it was surimi (fake crab) or the real deal, but the Kani Su was thoroughly enjoyed by both of us despite the crab reality mystery.  The vinegar was sweet and tart, perfectly complimenting the crisp subtlety of the cucumbers and interesting textures of the seaweed.  At one point, I half-jokingly referred to wanting to drink the remaining vinegar - I'm not necessarily into the idea of pickling myself, but the stuff was so dang good.  The Spider Roll was also tasty, but with it being (at least in our case) at odd numbers (5), it made evenly splitting it interesting (Tree Country Bistro in Cleveland has a Spider Maki roll that does easily put it to shame, however... just sayin').  If we'd sat and given all of this time to digest for a bit, I'm sure that we would have been happily content, but occasionally we get rash in the hunger department.  As a result, we ordered the High Street Roll (tuna, salmon, avocado, cream cheese & masago topped with spicy mayo - $7.50) to finish things up.  It was pleasant, but the thick combination of cream cheese and avocado didn't necessarily score massive points with me.  At this point, our waitress, having seen that Jenn and I were reading through our vows that we'd put together nine years ago, asked if we were reading for pleasure or business - when informed that we were celebrating our anniversary, she congratulated us, cleared the table, and returned to quietly ask us if we were interested in a celebratory cocktail or ice cream.  It could have been just a smooth upsell, but we said yes, ordering some strawberry mochi (rice paper-wrapped strawberry ice cream - no price listed).  We'd never experienced mochi before, and loved it, commenting on its unusual, fun texture to our server (who suggested we head over to Trader Joe's to pick some up afterward, which we did).  In total, our bill came to approximately $38.00, which I found to be reasonable considering the amount of good and varied food that we'd consumed.  We didn't order from the broth noodles, noodles, or large plate menu, however - doing so would have likely kicked up our bill by $10-15 per person.\\n\\nThroughout the course of our meal, Haiku had gradually filled to brimming with couples and groups of trendy, beautiful people (quite a number of whom appeared likely to have had some artificial assistance with attaining said beauty - I'm no judger, however, so let's just say everything was natural).  With the high number of matching Coach purses and shoes marching through the door as the evening progressed, we felt fine exiting when we did (circa 8PM).  Our keys were returned by the valet, and with stomachs that were nicely full, but still relatively light and at ease, we set out to hunt down more mochi at Trader Joe's.  All in all, a fun, scrumptious experience."},{"name":"Buffalo Wild Wings","address":"2860 Cumberland Mall SE, Ste 1630","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2","text":"The staff were very nice but the food wasn't.

The changes to the water feature were nice, but overall, I'm not sure why it was closed as long as it was.\\n\\nArrived at about ten to six.  Waitress didn't take our orders until after six, so no happy hour discount, which was too bad.  Drink menu is fine - traditional tiki drinks + some originals, but a $3-4 increase over the Thatch menu.  Kind of sad to lose the $5 Mai Tai happy hour, since that was a nice way to start an evening.  A $7 happy hour drink doesn't have the same hook.\\n\\nDrinks were incredibly slow to come out.  There were only four other patrons in the bar, and it still took 10-15 minutes to get drinks.  I tried the Nui Nui and a Cobra's Fang.  They were good, but not life-changing.  As far as food, we tried the Hawaiian Bread, which was tasty, but tiny portions.\\n\\nOur waitress was not nearly as friendly or interesting as any of the old bartenders or waitresses.  Might go back, but the $3-4/drink price increase is hard to justify.\\n\\nAlso, what happened to the music?  Thatch always had a nice mix of Esquivel, Yma Sumac, Martin Denny, etc. going.

Having a Shawarma place right in the middle of the financial district is fantastic.\\n\\n- Food: \\nI had the lamb Shawarma to go. And it was so good. The quantity/quality vs price value is on point. The rice and the chopped meat was the majority of the plate and then there was salad and hummus. Everything was fresh and tasted really good. For someone who likes spicier food and more on the hotter side, I asked if they had a hot sauce. And they did. I got a good spoon and a half of this really hot, red chilli sauce which really was kind of icing on the cake for me. It completely transformed my meal and made it even more better than it already was.\\n\\n- Timings:\\nI especially like the fact they are open so late in the night. Especially when you are out and about in downtown and it's very late, I always wished there was Shawarma place that is open that late. And this one does. Even the weekends. I love the 11 to 11 time window.\\n\\nOverall, I was very happy with my 1st take out meal from Boston Shawarma.

I ordered the prime beef brisket sandwich ($12), which comes on a choice of hot griddled texas toast or a bulkie roll. I chose the texas toast. The sandwich came on two warm, buttery, thick slabs of toasted bread (the bread was delicious, but almost too buttery) and was packed with an ample amount of brisket. The brisket was moist, juicy, tender, and melt-in-your-mouth, and definitely one of the better briskets that I have had in Boston. I also tried their biscuit ($3), which was huge, warm, and so, so buttery. The biscuit itself was made with so much butter that I had to slather on some more of the honey butter just to dilute the butter taste with some of the sweetness from the honey (never thought that you could solve too much butter by adding on more butter...) Despite the fact that this was probably a 900 calorie biscuit, it was very tasty and I can see why it is so popular. My friends at the table tried some of the trays, including the pork rib tray ($24) and the fried chicken tray ($22). The pork ribs were tender, fall-off-the-bone, and well-seasoned, but a little undercooked for my taste. The fried chicken tray is probably the best bang for your buck, since you get around 6 large pieces of fried chicken in addition to two sides.\\n\\nOverall, I thought the food was good, and some of the highlights (the biscuit, the brisket) were downright delicious (although somewhat pricey, especially for the trays). However, I didn't like the service. I'll recount the story below:\\n\\nAt the beginning of the meal we were perusing the beer list, and saw that four types of beers were listed under the buckets (4 beers/bucket): Miller High Life ponies ($11), big can party $19), hometown heroes ($19), and hophead ($27). I told our server that we would like two of the \\"Miller High Life buckets\\", assuming that we were ordering the Miller High Life ponies for $11/bucket. When the bill came, we noticed that we had been charged $38 instead of the $22 that we were expecting. When we brought this to the attention of our server, she said that she had given us the bucket with 4 Miller High Life tallboys instead of the ponies, and these were $19/bucket instead of $11/bucket. Since we drank them, we were responsible for the higher cost. We were confused because the only Miller High Life bucket on the drinks list was the $11 bucket, and we didn't think it was fair that they would give us the tallboys (without even asking for clarification if we meant the tallboys or the ponies), and then charge us for them. The manager came out to speak with us and wasn't very friendly. She tried arguing with us that we essentially should have known better and that we shouldn't have drank the beer if we didn't want to be charged for tall boys - but honestly, we had no idea that the beer we were drinking was different from the bucket that we thought we ordered, since it said Miller High Life on the can and no one at the table was familiar with the pony terminology. At the very least, I think the server should have clarified with us whether we meant the ponies or the tallboys if there are two options for Miller High Life buckets (which is not obvious from the menu). In any case, the manager did end up reducing the cost of the beers down to the $11/bucket, but only after arguing with us for several minutes. To top it all off, when we received the updated bill, there was an added automatic 18% gratuity charge which wasn't present on the previous bill. I'm not sure if this is their policy for large groups (although that was not mentioned on the menu or anywhere that I can find on their website), or if they decided to add it to our bill because the manager was unhappy with us and wanted to ensure that we paid 18% gratuity. In any case, I was dissatisfied with the service element of the meal, and I hope that they can improve upon their customer service in the future."},{"name":"Diesel Cafe","address":"257 Elm St","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"Each time I visit Boston I HAVE to frequent Diesel or else my soul cries.

It started off with a pita with toppings while I looked over the menu. I selected the Al Hawr saled (which I found out later to be a shareable dish). The salad was crisp and came with a fried flat bread wrapped around sauteed onions and sumac. The cherry tomatoes were firm but soft, and bell peppers were fresh and crispy. The dressing, a pomegranate molasses and evoo, was a shade on the bitter side for my liking, but still delicious. I then had the falafel. The outside was firm with no trace of oil. The inside was warm and tender. It was served with a pita, garnishes, and a dipping sauce. I don't know what is was, other than delicious. With my meal I enjoyed a glass of Arak Brun, a Lebanese wine made of grapes and anise. The anise played with my taste buds for a while, but after the fourth sip or so, I became accustomed to it. It isn't a sweet wine, but it is still tasty and I urge you to try it if you ever get the chance. For desert, I had a microbrew beer. I should have gone for some actual desert, but my belly was full, my tongue was happy, and I was content. I highly recommend this south waterfront spot for a night out.

Honestly, I like Hong Kong and have had positive experiences there in the past. The food is good and they have some great cheap drink options have alongside whatever dish(es) you choose. However, on my last visit, they turned me off...probably for good.\\n\\nTonight, after a visit to Oberon for The Donkey Show (a wild, but fun time full of disco, lights and some impressive outfits), my girlfriend and I decided to swing by Hong Kong for a late bite to eat following a great dance session. We got there early enough and were fortunate to get a table right away near the door.\\n\\nWe ordered and had some waters on our table for a while before the food arrived. The table next to us had a massive bowl of food delivered, which made the wait a bit tougher (though on a busy night, understandable). We soon found ourselves surrounded by a few small groups patiently waiting for other tables to open up. The lady and I were of course, pleased with the french fries and couple of orders of dumplings we ordered. Shortly after we started eating, a group of 5 or 6 younger guys (college-age) came in and said hi to a few of the bouncers and wait staff, and seemed to be working on squeezing in ahead of the line to get a spot in the dining room.\\n\\nWe waited again for a bit to ask for the check and have some food (we didn't finish- the dumplings were massive!) wrapped up to go. Our waiter picked up the plate and headed back towards the kitchen. On his way, one of the guys in the same group from before stopped him, leaned over to say a few words, picked up a handful of our leftovers and ATE THE FOOD OFF OF OUR PLATE.\\n\\nI was, needless to say, initially shocked that someone would act like this. I confronted the guy verbally, who proceeded to ignore me while chomping away on our food. Finally, he responded, asking if I was going to do anything about it while continuing to munch away on what was left of our order. His buddies joined in the conversation and seemingly wanted to \\"commence negotiations outside,\\" when all my girlfriend and I really wanted initially was to take our food and go home. \\n\\nFinally, a bouncer stepped in and got some details on the situation. He asked the young gentleman who committed the act to leave and he obliged. Despite this action, the guy's entourage kept up the chatter, shouting some non-wittily crafted phrases across the restaurant at us. The waiter finally brought our check over, minus the food we didn't eat as a result of the classy actions of the starving bro who couldn't wait to order his own food. That said, there was no other reconciliation, and when we finally walked out the door, the perpetrator was waiting outside for us to leave so he could reenter the building. \\n\\nNeedless to say, after this experience I will likely never be going back. It's a shame because while they do cook up some tasty morsels, if the staff of Hong Kong don't respect their customers enough to stick up for them, it definitely isn't worth it."},{"name":"Brookline Lunch","address":"9 Brookline St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Brookline lunch is the definition of a greasy spoon brunch spot.\\n\\nTheir pancakes are delicious, big, and covered in a slab of butter.

I go there just for the calamari.\\n\\nThe bad: They're way too expensive for what you get. The service is hit or miss. I've had a really nice waitress, and then one that took forever to come by and we were the only people in the restaurant! Plus, the owner was sitting at a table and didn't even come over to say hello. I had the ravioli and it tasted like there was sand in the sauce. When I asked the cook about it, he said it was just larger pieces in the pesto. Bull! I think they didn't wash the basil before grinding it. Either way, I was not offered a remedy, a new dish, or anything after clearly stating my dissatisfaction with the dish.

Had the Saut√©ed Steak Burrito (5.50) and was pleasantly surprised. Nice flavor (even the rice), generous portion of steak and overall size was your normal size food truck burrito (slightly larger then a chipotle burrito). Only down fall (for me anyways) is there were a little too many green peppers for my liking (I hate peppers tho.. so if you like peppers you probably wouldn't have a problem). Next time I'll remember to have those excluded from my burrito. Service wise the worker wasn't overly friendly or engaging but was very nice. I asked him what he'd recommend and the 1st thing he said was the burritos which that's where i was leaning anyways so it tipped me totally to that direction and obviously was a good choice. \\n\\nThis truck is worth a shot if you're in the mood for a burrito and are growing tired of Chopollos or that other place.. dang it... can't remember the name.. tequila something i think.. i dunno.. it's right next to chunky subs.. whatever..."},{"name":"Epicerie Cafe & Grocery","address":"2307 Hancock Dr","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"This place has great ambiance.

Santiago's' hot green chile is indeed insane - I CAN eat it, just so as not to be labeled a wimp, but I'll be crying out of all of my orifices while doing so.  The smothered burritos are totally smothered; you need a spoon, a fork, AND a knife and you will still get sauce all over yourself.  And they're stuffed full of real, fresh flavor as well.  When you're done, you have a satisfied feeling, like, 'damn, I'm glad I ate that.  That's REAL food.'  Unlike lots of fast food where you are like... 'why did I crave that, that shit's disgusting.'  Santiago's may be fast, but it's not 'fast food', and I love that about it.\\n\\nMy only beef with Santiago's (the joke will become apparent in a second, har har) is that they don't put much meat into their breakfast burritos.

I'm talking funky umami overload here folks. It's so good I would eat it in 90 degree FL summer weather, no joke.\\n\\nSalmon teriyaki: Our country boy ordered this, a step up from his usual chicken only selections at Asian restaurants, and he ate the whole thing. He doesn't talk much but this tells me he likes it!\\n\\nIf I had to pick a negative it would be that the service was somewhat slow after arrival. It took a significant amount of time to put in our food order. I can't blame the server however because she was the only one there servicing several large tables and handling carry-out orders. Her attitude and the food more than made up for this minor indiscretion. After we ordered another girl showed up and started providing drink refills in a timely fashion, including several refills of my green tea which was perfect with no additions.\\n\\nI am very sad we don't have a restaurant like this is MD.

Like every place in Orlando, there's a schtick. The Old Hickory Steakhouse has a quaint bayou feel (as much as you can get with the decorated the ground floor of a hotel space), but in Orlando, they're good at it (complete with live turtles and alligators swimming in the moat).  Restaurant-wise, it's classic steakhouse.  Impeccable white linen tablecloth service, complete with cheese cart and crumb scrapers, all set in an ersatz fishing shack.  We had a rather large party of 8, space was a little tight, especially after all the food came.  We got pretty much every cheese out of the cart.  Def ask the Cheese Sommelier for descriptions, some were familiar and rather commonplace (Spanish manchego, Vermont cheddar).  Everything was cooked to the perfect temperature, except for the unfortunate drum, which was ordered \\"well done\\" (that was the diner's fault, just let the kitchen do what it does best).  The classic starters did not disappoint either.  Had the Lobster Bisque (actually had lobster chunks in it), French Onion Soup (piping hot, plenty of melted cheese and caramelized onions), Wedge Salad (cool, crisp).  Also, had a small plate of the Pork Belly with Slow-cooked Collards and Black-eyed Peas.  Pork Belly was long-cooked, tender, then the skin crisped with a sticky sweet and savory glaze, delicious.  We were going to get the Chocolate Souffl√© for dessert, but were told the kitchen was having trouble with the souffl√©s rising, got the Grand Marnier Souffl√© instead.  Presentation was splashy, a grand display of cr√®me anglaise poured from a high height into the cracked open top of the souffl√©.  It was a beauty to behold, light as air, mildly flavored, soft and creamy (and I'm not really a big fan of souffl√©s).  If you've got the cash (and you probably do, if you're staying at the Gaylord), def a nice way to spend an evening (generally fewer kids in a pricier restaurant like this).

After they moved on, I stepped up and ordered a Ropa Vieja, flank steak box with brown rice and sweet potato fries. What I loved about the dish was it was really flavorful. The meat was sort of in \\"ropes\\" and incredibly juicy. The beef with the rice and fries really made a great meal and I'll definitely come back for more great Cuban food here."},{"name":"Little Big Burger","address":"1630 E 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Great addition to the neighborhood, \\"right\\" sized burgers and fair prices."},{"name":"Gari Japanese Fusion Brookline","address":"187 Harvard St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3.5","text":"midrange sushi at high-end prices\\nthe small, cramped seating and lack of coat rack didn't help things\\nasked for a large, warm flask of midpriced sake\\nit first arrived cold, then was redelivered half-microwaved, with a tepid top and cold bottom\\nbasic nigiri standards (salmon, tuna, yellowtail) was 5.50-6.00 per 2 piece order!

No frills, no house made ketchup or vegan mayo-- just classic diner fare. \\n\\nMy husband loves this place, so we go somewhat regularly. It's totally fine for a place that's across the street and serves some very filling plates with healthy options (egg whites, veggies, and wheat toast, anyone?). A lot of their menu is focused on middle eastern or Mediterranean fare, which isn't my cup of tea, especially in the morning. So I don't quite *love* it as much as other people seen to-- but it's a matter of personal preference. \\n\\nGenerally, I don't think it's worth waiting in line for.

Sorry to say you'll want to avoid this place on a hot summer day, since it's totally sweltering inside. \\n\\nThe prices are good and the food is good, but it adds up quickly for a very basic meal. Two egg entrees, two coffees and a juice with tip ends up being over $30 for a simple breakfast. \\n\\nI wish I liked this place more! It's so cute. But just not my jam.

Congrats, Mezzo, for being my first 1-star review!\\n\\nThere is a teeny bit of good to say, so let's get that out of the way first: Mezzo has a lovely staff, attentive and friendly servers, a gorgeous patio, and a surprisingly large wine selection.  None of this makes up for the the bland, boring, and just plain bad food.  (Except maybe the wine--see below.)\\n\\nMeezo provides free appetizers of bread, flatbread, and salty butter.  They MIGHT have been trying for a garlic and herb butter spread but after choking down the first bite and draining half my water I wasn't keen to investigate further.  Savor the salt, though, because it will be the only hint of seasoning throughout your meal.\\n\\nFor a real appetizer, my dining partner and I ordered the \\"Mezzo Tasting Trio,\\" which actually includes 4 different samples: fresh mozzarella fritters, meatballs, crab stuffed bacon wrapped shrimp, and fried polenta.  Waste.  Of.  Money.  Everything on the plate in color, taste, and texture was bland, and if not for the sauce the food would have melted into one brownish pile of mush.\\n\\nDuly disappointed with the appetizer, we started in on our entrees.  My friend had been singing praises for some veal medallions, though we discovered they had been removed from the menu so we opted to try the pizzas.  He had the (Allegedly) Peppered Chicken and I had the Verde.   Somewhere in my mind I had convinced myself these pizzas would be contenders with BonoToGo.  Not a chance...Bono would wipe the floor with these sorry excuses for crust and toppings.  \\n\\nFor the Verde, Mezzo somewhat impressively managed to pair the least flavorful pesto I've ever had with the most horrifically overpowering asparagus in the tri-county area.  Impressive, but not exactly delicious.  The (Allegedly) Peppered Chicken was surprisingly dull and my dining partner had to empty half the salt and pepper shakers onto the pizza to make it edible.  After a few bites, though a mouthful of cheese and disappointment, he said, \\"This tastes better drunk.\\"  (See above, re: wines.)\\n\\nWe passed on dessert and I seriously considered telling the server to toss out the 3/4 of the pizza I didn't eat.  However, we graciously paid our bill and accepted inedible boxed pizzas.

For $$$, I think the oyster appetizer ought to be six large fat bivalves instead of three little skinny bivalves.  My injustice meter buzzed for a second.\\n\\nAnd this is partly self-imposed, partly not.  One food allergy and one food preference (don't eat pork) narrowed my choice even more than the menu did.

All the tables for two were taken, but a few bigger tables were available.  Soon more couples came in.  Still no one was seated.

Their flagship up in Maine remains the benchmark for this wonderful creation by Melissa Kelly.\\n\\nHaving dined here over several years I can tell you that the food is generally excellent, the wait staff always outstanding, and the ambience elegant.  We were told last night that the onsite chef had changed since our last visit (Melissa Kelly remains as Executive Chef), but I noticed some inconsistencies with the taste of the food compared with previous visits and also compared to the Maine and Tucson locations.  IMHO all the restaurants should be able to stick to Melissa's preparations with a high level of precision, allowing for some latitude for local ingredients.  With that, our group of four started with one of the pizzas (always great no matter which one you get) and the cured meat and cheese platter (good, but not anything special...have had much better elsewhere).  The farmer salad, previously an impressive portion with multiple lettuces, croutons, soft boiled egg, etc., was a pedestrian salad that looked hastily put together, a smaller portion with just romaine lettuce, fewer and smaller croutons, and a sloppily made soft boiled egg that lacked any visual appeal, particularly when served in the same dishes (no more wooden bowls) used for every other course...this was disappointing.  The lobster on brioche was good.  The spaghetti and meatballs was good at best: very good marks for the pasta itself (nice extra thick homemade spaghetti), but the meatballs were just good, and the sauce just wasn't very special...it was both watery and thick on different parts of the plate.  The rigatoni was okay.  The pork saltimbocca, which I get more than half the time I dine there, was very good except for the fact that it tasted much saltier than on previous visits.  \\n\\nThis visit only earns 4 stars (I'm being generous because I'm a fan of Melissa), but has been 5 stars on all previous visits here and at the other locations.

Hot, fluffy, huge they were, and the sweet soft butter melted gloriously against the biscuits.  They were tasty, but I did not hear angels sing.  Still greedily I accepted a share of the remaining carb and dairy to take home for breakfast another day.\\n\\nOur selected onsies arrived alongside the fried chicken on its tray, all set in little piles.  In my meat order of preference from tops to bottom: fried chicken (4 pieces, tender meat, crispy coating), brisket (two fat slices in a 1/4 lb portion for $4.50; tender though with a thin fatty layer), ribs ($3.50 apiece; just not as tender as its tray-mates).  The farmer's salad beat out the mac & cheese, no sweat, but you have to like brussel sprouts to really enjoy it.  Sure, the pasta wasn't overly soft, but even with the crumby topping, it wasn't much of a standout from the supermarket one in the blue box.\\n\\nSeating options were your normal joe private tables, bar seats, the window side counter seats we populated, and a couple of long communal tables.

I expected our waiter to be a little bit more on top of getting us our check since he made a point to ask what time our movie was when we ordered.

I admit that I am late to realizing that they're back, along with old favorites like Black Tiger. My loss, but it can be your gain!\\n\\nListen, you can go just about anywhere for an ok cup of joe. There's an empire in Seattle who learned a few of their chops with Jim and Patty way back in the day, or so I'm told. Apocryphal or not, this should tell you how long they've been in the game. The thing to remember is that your average cup of joe shouldn't be expensive since, at best, it's average. There's nothing average about Jim and Patty's Coffee. Long before there was the now almighty Stumptown, you could get outstanding coffee from Coffee People. It got big; it got bought, and it disappeared. Now, though, those glorious days are back!\\n\\nAfter loving the coffee, you begin to look at all the pastries and food, too. There's this little secret breakfast treasure that must verge on illegal, the pig newton. While I admit that I've only tried one variety, it's about the best thing for breakfast. The version I've become enamoured of is the super pepper jack. For those afeared of the spicy nature, it's really well balanced with the cheese and biscuit wrapper, so be afeared no longer! Better yet, there's a gluten free version for those who shrink from the evil wheat protein! I've also indulged in the hipster bowl. It's really, really good, but probably only will enter my gullet after way too much liquor the night before, but if you're looking for an over-the-top breakfast, you can, and likely will, have much worse at some highly rated hipster joints around town (I'm looking directly at you, Pine State). I'm not a pastry kind of guy, so I likely won't choose to indulge in their myriad offerings, both full of the current evil, gluten, but also gluten-free options for those so inclined. I have yet to have anything less than outstanding here, so I think you can't miss with any of their food offerings!\\n\\nI should note that because of a long-standing personal health thing, I've been drinking milk alternatives since the only thing you could get was rice milk (ugh). Jim and Patty's has a whole range of milk alternatives and I'm hippy enough that I regularly opt for the hemp milk, which is outstanding.\\n\\nWhen I finally discovered Jim and Patty's, not only did the heavens open up, but I swear, there was some guy there with a long flowing beard, surrounded by a retinue of Rubenesque people who appeared to be wearing their backpacks inside their robes?!

Yet no mere mortal fast food burger would do but then again it WAS a Sunday and I was lazy and didn't feel like driving far. Then like a light bulb it went off GRAFFITI BURGER! To make things even better the Clintonville location \\"just\\" opened and somehow I hadn't been yet. \\n\\nSo about a half hour later (for a lazy Sunday that is good) I finally made the less than a cigarette journey. Walking in I was not shocked to see the typical graffiti sprayed on the walls and the similar lay outs to the others. I looked at the menu for some silly reason and ordered a Graffiti burger, fries and a drink to go. The worker (manager I think) was mega nice and made normal small talk as the transaction  came to an end. I grabbed my coke and waited the normal Graffiti Burger time to get my food. One thing that I loved is that they had malt vinegar in packets for my to go fries. \\n\\nAs I got home I was happy to see my fries in a bag and burger in its own container. As I grabbed my vinegar packets and napkins out of the bag I noticed something that almost seemed to not belong, a long sorta spherical sorta odd in shape thing wrapped in paper. Curious I unwrapped this odd present and EUREKA it was a pickle! Now it may seem odd that I get so excited about a simple pickle because it comes with their burgers when you eat in but this was to go they didn't HAVE to include this pickle in fact I didn't think that they would, I wouldn't have been upset if it wasn't there, I wouldn't have called and demanded my pickle, I would have eaten my burger and fries and gone back to watching random tv on my lazy Sunday. Anyways moving on from my happy pickle discovery.

Long story short...my girlfriend and I decided to eat here for once rather than our other Fenway staple. We sat in the 'beer garden'. She is not much into BBQ, bacon, ribs, steak and such. I ordered their fantastic buttermilk fried chicken dish and she ordered the cobb salad.  She asked for no bacon on the salad, but they gave her the bacon anyways. As if the bacon and soft boiled eggs weren't enough protein for that salad, the line cook/chef included a dead grasshopper, as well. We were definitely distgusted by the bug, but it is a salad and bugs love leafy lettuce as much as we do, so my girlfriend quietly and politely went up to the outside bartender and told him there was a roach in her salad. He thought that was crazy and gave her a look. Came to the table to confirm and after a minute of staring he corrected her and said 'looks more like a grasshopper'. We didn't care much what it was (roach or grasshopper), just that it didn't belong in our food and it has kind of killed our afternoon. He made a comment that it may have jumped up into her salad because we were outside. We didn't like that comment much either. The bug was clearly dead and at mixed in with all the ingredients. He took the salad back to the chef. After about 15 minutes of sitting there and totally losing our appetites, we stopped the manager and asked him about the situation and he had not been told of the bug. So we had to tell him the story and he also thought the grasshopper could have jumped into the salad. We were pissed that the bartender never told his manager when he said he was going to and also that we were being told that 'bugs are bugs and are everywhere, so watch out' rather than a simple 'our bad, we're terribly sorry. what can we do to make this right'. After a total of about 20 minutes and appetites totally shot, the manager came back, said the chef denies that it came from his kitchen (prob came in the bagged salad from their distributor) and offered my girlfriend another salad and when she declined let us know that he would take care of the salad, the app we ordered and her drink. We were still on the hook for my drink and my barely half eaten meal. Oh well. All in all, i like this place, i'm moving into the neighborhood in 2 weeks and will probably only venture over for their drinks after this experience. A non-attentive bartender, an unapologetic manager and a chef in denial is what I am taking from that day. Accountability is too much to ask for from a group of employees that were not at fault for a dead grasshopper being included in their lettuce delivery. It happens. Oh well. 1 star was given for their service. 3 stars for food (would be 5 if not for dead bug) and 5 stars for their drinks."},{"name":"Samurai Sushi On Fraser","address":"6428 Fraser Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"I ordered take out around 7pm which did not take long maybe a 10 minute wait for a Chirashi Don and a Maki Combo B (California roll, BC roll, and Spicy tuna roll).

I brushed off the slight and I gave the servers a pass for their wrinkled, dingy white shirts.  Anyway, we get seated and five minutes pass without anyone coming over to welcome us or to offer us water.  Then I notice that the two couples who were seated after us had already had their water glasses filled.  So, we waited another few minutes, figuring it was a minor oversight.  After almost another five minutes, we got up and left.

However, it's not THAT much better. \\n\\nThey were out of one of the beers listed on their website (Punjabi Pumpkin) and then also kicked out of the Old Mother Hubbard, so we were left with ordering a tower of the Great Pumpkin Ale. Unfortunately, the taste of pumpkin was pretty subtle, and the beer was pretty dull overall. When I ran out of beer, I opted for a non-CBC beer instead. Why does a brewery offer several beers from other breweries? I'm not quite sure, but my Dogfish Head Punkin was delicious.\\n\\nThey also offer a pumpkin ravioli for a steep $17. The dish itself is rich, and delicious, but quite small compared to some of the sandwich deals. I think either a side needs to be offered, or charge less for the entree. Luckily though, I admit it was very good. The cream sauce was rich and very flavorful.\\n\\nCBC seems like a fun option if you live nearby, but quite frankly, I don't think it's necessary to make the haul if you live on the Boston side of things.

Both my mother and I have to eat Gluten Free though I don't like to be obnoxious about it. But since the menu states there are options I went a head and asked. Our server looked at me like I was a big pain in the ass and started to give me a half assed explanation about what someone who can't eat gluten should eat. \\"Stay away from flour.\\" Are you kidding me? So my mother says \\"So we are basically on our own.\\" And he says, \\"Yeah.\\".  We didn't make a deal about it. Just smiled and ordered our drinks. Five minutes later we order our food. Fifteen minutes later he comes back to ask me what I ordered. Which meant he had not yet even put our order in. Unbelievable. 45 minutes after we sat down we had our food. This was after the place had cleared and tables that were sat after us had their food or had already departed. He made an excuse (blamed my mother) that because she ordered fajitas - that's why it took so long. Please. We're from Texas. That's the first and faster thing to order. Give me a break.

Each of the salsas had a distinct flavor, the best being the sweet and wonderfully spicy mango-habanero salsa.\\n\\nI ordered the chicken and yams enchiladas.  I really wanted to love these, but they fell way short of my expectations.  The problem arose I believe from the fact that the 'yam' aspect of the enchilada actually featured the skin off of the yams, which if anything detracted from the other flavors.  The rice and enchilada sauce were also somewhat bland.  The butter beans accompanying the dish though were pretty tasty.  Wife had the rotisserie chicken, and was also disappointed with the lack of flavor and the taste of the tortillas (she did however really enjoy her Mojito).\\n\\nFor dessert, we had the churros, which were a crowd pleaser, but I couldn't get behind them (they tasted too much like Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal).\\n\\nAt the end of the meal, we learned from the manager that all of Centro's offerings are gluten-free.  I doubt however that the lack of gluten impacted my impressions of the meal, but perhaps.

I have however been working my way through their lunch and dinner menus. Let me make some examples: the Ruben is horribly overpriced especially considering it has the LEAST corned beef I've ever seen in a Ruben since the New York Deli in DisneySea in Tokyo -- but Japan's price for beef is ten times what it costs in the US, so they have an excuse, other than outright greed. The Cafe tries to hide the fact by grilling the corned beef till it approximates crispy bacon forcing the pieces of impossibly thick bread apart so that if you don't look too close you'll think there's more meat than is actually there; That said, and there's a much better/cheaper Ruben at the Irish themed bar next to Celebration's Publix; the Turkey dinner's turkey was very dry, and came with the smallest servings of potatoes and stuffing ever, and instead of the promised chutney I got 2 tiny cinnamon apples, the homemade potato chips promise to be \\"blue cheese chips\\" which I've seen done around the orlando area to varying degrees of success (this wasn't the worst, but close to) ... and I could go on.

We had a wonderful waitress who was above and beyond when recommending dishes for us on the menu. We ordered their specials where you buy one of the selected pastas, you can take one home. We were eating on a budget, but wanted to eat somewhere nice, so this was perfect. The bread was warm with the parmesan and extra virgin olive oil dip. We ordered the beef paperadelle and chicken alfredo pastas. It was extra charge for chicken added to the alfredo pasta. Pasta did not disappoint and it was an adequate amount to keep us full. The bread is refillable and the dessert was tempting. I just ordered a small kid's sized ice cream that we could share. We didn't have more room for the decadent desserts such as tiramisu and cheesecake. Towards the end, they accidentally charged us a different amount by mistake, but the waitress was so polite that it wasn't a bother.

Eating the Piada like a burrito didn't feel right to me. I had the chicken (consists of white and dark meat) with pasta, pancetta, parm, mozz, roasted peppers, grilled veggies, arugula, and tomato relish (Italian salsa). This was a tasty combination, but I only saw once piece of pancetta (there may have been more hiding) and there was not much of a chicken portion. However, the vegetables were in good proportion to each other. \\n\\nAvoid the Cannoli chips as they are almost $3 and just not worth it. They are broken Cannoli shell with a tasty marscapone dip, but the chips are very dry and mild flavored and really not all that satisfactory as a dessert. \\n\\nI chose to order online and pick up, which worked out really well. There was no line and the pick up was pretty efficient for it being a new operation. My order was totally correct.

I was able to eat mine within 10 min of pickup and it was already rather soggy and the bottom busted out.

The restaurant washes over you like relief as you enter to soft tones of the Avett Brothers, and a large rectangular bar that is larger than most in the city. The open layout and organic feel of driftwood, moss, and fresh clean sinks stuffed with chilling sodas and wine give you the feel of being outside while in.\\n\\nDrinks are clean and fresh - spirit driven like all of the cocktails in Atlanta these days. i always gravitate to wine at Watershed, but surprise myself with the dirty martini because I'm a sucker for a blue-cheese stuffed olive. Later, a glass of viognier delivers perfectly. \\n\\nThe menu feels like Watershed is all grown up. Crawfish pie is packed with nuggets of meat and encased in flaky, buttery crust which stains the parchment with a tad bit of oil as you devour it. \\n\\nWanting to take my new relationship slowly, I order the vegetable plate which too feels all grown up and cleaner and healthier in a good way. The old vegetable plate felt like a smattering of meat + 3 sides, and had as much bacon fat, chicken fat, eggs and cream as most heavy entrees. This one showed restraint - buttermilk braised fennel took the edge off the strong stuff; pimiento cheese cornbread was colorful but classically southern in its avoidance of sugar. The sauteed mushrooms were only slightly enhanced by butter and I could have eaten double their portion. Zucchini was slightly boring and reminiscent of my own. \\n\\nI'll be back - because Watershed fills a spot in my restaurant line up that no other place can.

We started with two appetizers - the mussels and the brushetta.  The mussels were tasty, with a nice big loaf of crusty bread and decent marinara.  The brushetta had fig, goat cheese, proscuitto and a balsamic glaze on it.  The portion size was ridiculously big, and overall it was pretty tasty!!  For a second dish we had the pasta with short ribs, which could have been good had the fresh pasta not been so al dente.  Again the marinara was decent, but the pasta was chewy.  We complained to the waiter, and he said \\"this is the way we cook it.\\"  \\n\\nFor entrees we ordered the rib eye, mashed potatoes and kale, and the pork loin with white beans.

Something changed a couple of years ago and it was horrible and we stopped ordering. Tonight, I thought I'd give them another shot and I'm really sorry I did. First off, the chicken parm is no longer available for delivery. Ok, I went for the chicken parm sub. And there were \\"Hershey's sticks\\" on the dessert menu that sounded yummy...I love chocolate! So I placed my order online and waited. And waited. And waited. About an hour after I placed the order, my cell rang and when I answered I was hung up on. They called again a few minutes later and the young lady on thenothernend seemed completely confused about my order. It was apparent they had not even begun assembling my order. She promised it would arrive shortly. About 45 minutes later thenguybfinally gets there and quotes me $20. Even though my ACTUAL total was supposed to be $18.47. I'm capable of deterring what I'd like to tip my delivery person, thanks.\\n\\nOk, so onto the food. Gross is the only description I can come up with. The sub? More like sub-par. The marinara was watery and this made the bread soggy. The taste of the marinara and cheese was ok but the chicken was sparse, bland and not breaded at all. It was all just blech.\\n\\nThe \\"Hershey\\" sticks? I don't know where they get the Hershey part from. Hershey would imply chocolate, right? Or am I just making a silly assumption there? What I got was a rectangle of dry, stale, chewy, hard pizza dough slathered with a marshmallow cream glaze. There was nothing chocolate about it. It was just...gross.\\n\\nI'm not sure how they're still in business. It's really a shame. They used to be awesome and I had hoped that they'd be awesome again but that's just not the case.

A man who looked to be a manager behind the counter never said hello when we walked in. We waited a few seconds before we were seated. It was Sierra who greeted and served us. She was very nice and polite. \\n\\nI ordered breakfast while my boyfriend ordered lunch. We were the only ones in the store, yet it took so long (30min) for our food to be served. We were seated fairly close to the kitchen. There was a blonde cook who didn't start cooking nearly twenty minutes after our food was taken. Again, there was nobody else in the place, so I must ask why the food came out so late. Sierra came by and updated us that the food will be right out. \\n\\nMy boyfriend loved his burger while my hash brown looked so undercooked that I didn't even bother eating it. I did hear snippets from the kitchen from the blonde cook saying that she didn't know how to cook hash browns and Sierra shouldn't offer breakfast anymore. Again, I was confused. If the blonde cook had been hired for the position, she should've been taught to cook the entire menu. So why offer breakfast when the cook doesn't know how to prepare it?\\n\\nI know that the delay in food is caused by the kitchen, not the server. Again, Sierra was prompt. It wasn't her fault. It was the cook who decided she doesn't want to start cooking until she's ready, which happened to be 20 minutes later. Also, the manager at the front could've done something to acknowledge our presence. Instead, he only stared down to us and went on to counting the change in the register. What kind of manager is that? Sierra seems to have more customer service than him.\\n\\nFinally, when we went to the front counter to pay, there was no one there (Sierra was in the bathroom). The blonde cook ignored us but she could've informed someone to help us. But I didn't even expect that from her. Judging from the voices in the back, there were at least 3 other people in the back of the house. \\n\\nAs we waited to pay, two other patrons came in. They asked us if the food took long. They stated they were here two nights ago and the service was very slow. And I warned them that they're just as slow today. They came in already very angry from their previous experience and I can see why. Then, they started yelling into the kitchen for somebody to seat them. The patrons told us to just walk out without paying since nobody wants to help us. Haha, but we didn't.\\n\\nWe paid and left an hour later. I do like the food. It was my first time trying their breakfast and it will be my last. It was foolish of me to think that I could get fast service in a place where there was no other people.

He then took our order, my boyfriend ordered chicken parm and a salad, i ordered from the chef's tasting menu (4 small plates of different items).  My boyfriends entire meal came at the same time as my first two small plates (a couple ravioli and a small side salad).  The waiter did recognize that he should have put the entree to come out as mine did, however, even after multiple times of his saying that he was going to check on the food, it took about 30-40 minutes for my final plate to come after my boyfriends food was already cold.  When the waiter came back for the 4th time he explained that he went to check on the food, but was yelled at by his manager for asking questions(which I do not believe).  Finally, when the check came he said he would pay for a dessert himself, which we declined as we didn't want to wait there any longer, I still hadn't received my dinner, and he said the best thing he can do then is take $5 off the bill.  When the food finally came I had gotten up from my seat and at that point the waiter made a comment to my boyfriend about how \\"his friend\\" was clearly frustrated and he didn't know what else he could have done.  A bigger discount, or a manager coming to speak with us would have helped.\\n\\nNeedless to say, it was a very disappointing (lack of)dinner. There are plenty of places in the same shopping center to eat at that are much better.\\n\\n*Disclaimer: I came to find out, from calling another Romano's that the water glass is standard for the house wine, even so, the comment made to us during our meal made it seem like we were not worthy of wine glasses and he took what he could find most quickly.  The other location also said that they generally share the reason behind the water glass with customers which would have made a huge difference."},{"name":"Hanami","address":"3211 Grant McConachie Way","city":"Richmond","stars":"2","text":"Good Chinese food!\\nI haven't tried the sushi or Japanese dishes, so I have no comment on that.\\n\\nIt's located in a perfect spot to have a last meal with an International passenger after they've checked in.

For those of you who use to go to the tiki bar that was there before, you may remember that the ventilation system didn't work very well. It was usually smokey from the pupu platters and kitchen food. At times, it made it hard to breath. This is a thing of the past!

Even with only 6 cocktails to choose from it was hard to decide which ones to go for. With the full menu featuring 20 drinks and having 5 rotating specials, it will be even harder to choice in the future. I guess that just means we will have to come back. Many times! In the end we decided to just work our way through the menu until we had tried all of them between the two of us. \\n\\nThrough-out the night, we made it through the rest of their drink menu tasting the Beachcombers Punch, Suffering Bastard, Jaspers Rum Punch and the Nui Nui. Many patrons loved the Suffering Bastard, but my two favorites were the Jaspers Rum Punch and the Beachcombers Punch. These are not your mom's bridge club punches! They both have incredibly sophisticated palettes with the Jaspers Rum Punch having a bite that sneaks up on you a few seconds after you've taken that first sip. The Nui Nui is always an all time favorite and continued to live up to it's reputation. \\n\\nAll in all it was a great evening.

The music is obviously of that era which I love and not too loud unlike some other places like this. Check out the pics. I ordered the Buddy Holly burger which has bacon, cheddar and BBQ sauce. I also ordered a coffee and that was good too. Each booth has one of those old table top jukeboxes which is a demo only product. Too bad :(  it is empty in here and I'm the only person in here right now. The floors are clean the place is spotless. There were a few tvs but they weren't on and that's just fine by me.

The bacon is still crispy. And the melted cheese is well melty. Is that a word. It is now. The side of coleslaw was actually quite tasty. I needed a few napkins for this beast.

My wife had some quasi lasagna dish that was not sure what it wanted to be when it wanted to grow up.

Basically a glorified flea market. I like checking out the locally-produced honey, maple syrup, produce, and pastries.

To preface: he is a barbeque nut, having told me countless tales of his visits to Dreamland, Jack's Stacks, Pierces, etc.  He was the one who convinced me to drive into the middle of no-man's land Texas to experience Salt Lick.  By default I have become quite enamoured of smoked meats with tangy sauce.  We actually made a special trip into Boston to do the Phantom Gourmet's BBQ festival (where he had Virginia BBQ and I had the Texas, we ate and compared notes).  \\n\\nThat being said, we agreed this is very good... for the North.  My husband insists for the North this is a 4 star joint.   Atmosphere wise this was right on.  The decor was well thought out with reworked iron chair, metal platters, jelly jars as glasses, etc.  The meat was cooked perfectly: our brisket was absolutely fork tender, the pulled pork was moist and tasty.  The pork belly. . . was good. . . a different offering from the usual bbq fare.  As per many many other yelpers, there was a decent amount of fat on the brisket but it still was very tasty.  \\n\\nThe biscuits were superb, order just one per person because they truly are the size of a softball!  We actually shared a \\"fat cheeks\\" platter, had two biscuits, and were more than satisfied (THE PORTIONS ARE VERY GENEROUS).  The collards were well cooked and seasoned.  The potato salad was fresh and light.  They had a nice offering of side dishes, including many fresher, lighter things (like carrot salad).  \\n\\nThe sauce is where I take off my stars.  My husband says I am being harsh, he is the one who loves to slop up his sauce with the white bread (which they do provide here, along with pickles and onions).  It's nothing special.  The mustard based and pepper varieties on the table were good, they did spice it up, but overall we were not impressed.  The bland sauce is very problematic because this is Texas style bbq where you accent your meat with the sauce.  \\n\\nAll in all this was VERY good, very well cooked, an adorable location and a well thought out concept.  Our server was friendly and attentive, the beer selection was great, and I wished I was less full so I could try more of the snazzy cocktails.

Their samosas are a consistent crowd-pleaser with my friends. The reason? They're only mildly spicy, they have an excellent breading-to-filling ratio, and they're 75 cents a pop. Samosas are always requested at any friend-gathering, and while I've brought over many different types from many different restaurants, Dhaliwal's are the #1 crowd favourite. For their samosas alone, I would give them 5 stars. HOWEVER, their service is AB-SO-LUTE-LY TERRIBLE.   T E R R I B L E.    It doesn't matter how in advance I order, they're never ready when I come to pick them up. I could order them 4 hours in advance and they still wouldn't be ready. The last time I ordered, I was told 20 minutes. We showed up 40 mins later and they still weren't ready. Not only that, but their debit machine had been down for a few days and they failed to mention this over the phone. We got there without any cash and had to run to the closest bank to withdraw money. Sure, not a big deal, but it is a big deal when you're getting dinged an extra 3 bucks to take cash out of an ATM. \\n\\nAnother issue I have is that they're started skimping on the chutney. I always order 40 samosas and a large tamarind chutney. Now, instead of a large container of chutney (which costs an extra $4), they give you two tiny containers and insist that it is the same amount as a large container. It isn't. I've just started buying chutney from another restaurant instead of dealing with their BS.\\n\\nI can't comment on anything BUT the samosas... but my boyfriend and I are getting pretty sick of their crap despite how good the samosas are.

So I was excited when they opened a location in my neighborhood - surely the delivery would be faster, right?  I ordered for the first time tonight and was told it would be between 35 - 45 minutes, which as it was Saturday night seemed totally reasonable. An hour later I call to ask if the pizza is on its way and am told that I shouldn't have expected it under an hour as they had been \\"super busy\\" earlier - then why the hell was I told less time?! \\n\\nAn hour and ten minutes after I ordered, the pizza arrives - and they've put the wrong ingredients on. I asked for bell peppers and instead they slathered it with hot peppers. If I had only said peppers when ordering I'd cut them some slack but I specifically said bell peppers to avoid just this problem. When I called to complain they reluctantly offered to send me another pizza in 30 minutes - um, right - or give me a credit for a free pizza at another time. Great. I'll make sure to plan ahead well in advance of when I'd ACTUALLY like to eat to place my next order. I'll also add that something similar happened once with the Back Bay location, except that time they switched my order with another persons.\\n\\nI've come to realize that location has nothing to do with it - these people just suck at organizing a business that can make and deliver pizza in under an hour.

But my first experience was bad enough that I don't think they deserve the benefit of the doubt. \\n\\n1. The food isn't very good.\\nI'm not from Texas, so I can't speak to whether the food is authentically Texan, but as a Southerner who misses the real deal, I did find it just generally disappointing.  The whole meal was like a heavy, greasy dessert: there was butter and sugar on everything, from the $7 hushpuppies (which had a weird oily taste--they were more like beignets than hush puppies) to the pulled pork.  It wasn't the worst Southern food I've ever had, but I would put it up there with the kind of stuff they serve at Dolly Parton's Dixie Stampede or at like a Ryan's steakhouse.  You could tell that there was some effort to be culinary and the presentation of the food was quite nice looking, but it just wasn't good.\\n\\n2. The food may have made us sick.\\nWithin half an hour after leaving, my stomach was incredibly upset.  We were seeing a movie at the Regal Fenway across the way afterwards and I had to leave the movie twice to dash to the restroom because I just felt awful.  My husband seemed to have escaped unscathed...until his stomach revolted the next morning.  It's possible that we both got into something else, so I won't say outright \\"the food made us sick\\"; however, I think it's the most likely candidate as by far the greasiest, heaviest, most buttery food we ate all week.  I also had to wonder about the cleanliness of using the same trays for food service.  I couldn't tell whether the trays that serve as plates were getting washed between use, or if they were just putting a new piece of wax paper on top.  If the former, disregard; if the latter, I have to wonder how sanitary that is, because the food leaks through the paper / touches the edges of the tray and that's gross.\\n\\n3. Their prices are INSANE.\\nWe had no idea how much the place cost, coming in.  Once we sat down and saw the menu, our eyes popped.  $7 for sides?!  $4.50 for a lemonade?!  $18+ for an entree with two sides?  WHAT IS THIS?!  But by the point we saw the menu, we were already seated and we had been wanting to try Sweet Cheeks for a while, so taking a deep breath we decided just this once, we'd give it a shot.  Never again.  $60 for two was insane for a casual dinner place and I don't care where it's located or what kind of hype it's getting.  It's extortion. (Our bill contained: 1 lemonade, 1 order of hush-puppies, a pulled pork platter and a pulled pork sandwich, each with two sides included; plus 20% gratuity for service--no alcoholic beverages or desserts).\\n\\n4. If you're not there at five, be prepared to wait.\\nThe first two times we tried to go here (at 6 and at 7 on a Friday and Saturday night, respectively), we ended up leaving because they said it would be a 2-3 hour wait.  We came back at 5 this time and were seated and served right away (but the place started filling up by 5:30.\\n\\nThey get one star for service which was pretty decent (not to mention Yelp won't allow you to give a place 0 stars).\\n\\nI seriously recommend taking your business elsewhere if you're looking for a pre-movie meal and especially if you're missing good Southern food...."},{"name":"Toasted","address":"1945 Aloma Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"I came in a few days after the grand opening and ordered the pesto chicken grilled cheese sandwich.

On the rare occasion she actually did come to our table, she was in dire need of a personality. Our wobbly, unbalanced table had more than she did.\\n\\nThat said, she wasn't the only thing that could use some help in the personality department. The sangria here was decent, but not great, and had little to no fruit in it. We also ordered the black bean crabcake, which was indeed a single entity, and it had very little flavor. Not to mention the fact that it came flooded with tomato juices (a tomato salsa is more than just chopped tomato and vinegar). I wanted to enjoy the short ribs (all two of them), but they didn't have much to them either. The chef's salad was decent, topped with nuts, apple slices and a (very) light dressing. The most disappointing of all was the sausage (Three Amigos). A picture of Martin Short, Steve Martin and Chevy Chase would've been more interesting, even if it were as soggy as the accompanying bread. \\n\\nThe only thing that caught the attention of my taste buds was the pesto garlic hummus that came with our complimentary bread. Yes, the one thing we didn't pay for was the one we remembered most.\\n\\nOn top of all that, the plates were all too big and didn't fit on the table very well and the fake candle inside a real candle was just tacky. I suppose the atmosphere was nice, if you could ignore all the lack of fashion sense in the room. Did any of the patrons here realize it was a Saturday night, and this wasn't Boca Grande?\\n\\nIf you want good tapas, a memorable meal, and attentive staff, I'd highly recommend avoiding Tasca.

The okonomiyashi was slightly disappointing. It could have used a bit more cabbage and less dough. I personally think that udon was pretty normal, it tasted like Asian stir fry...    I think the biggest disappointment was the fried ice cream, it was basically two pieces of toast with ice cream sandwiched in between and put into a deep fryer. I mean it wasn't too bad, but it wasn't what I expected.\\n\\nThe service was not too bad. Our server didn't really understand English really well.

The menu for this night was exceptional and the service was even better. Our reservations were for 8 and because of this, we entered 15 minutes early with a hole in our stomach. To our delight, the host sat us right down at this really cool oblong table. To stave off our hunger, we ordered the house made breads! Oh my god, so good. My wife and I were both really stoked, because had we not entered the evening so hungry, we probably would've missed some of the softest, freshest, tastiest breads we ever had. \\n\\nAfter just the perfect pause in the playlist, the waitress brought out our next dish...the Albacore Tuna Crudo. The combination of peaches, radish, pepperonata, edible flowers and of course tuna, was not only one of the more visually striking dishes we've ever had, but ended up being an incredible bite of summer. \\n\\nFor our main courses, we had sausage stuffed squid and Chili Gemelle with a side of eggplant. Starting with the eggplant, my wife and I both expressed extreme astonishment at how they were able to pack SO much flavor into a ****ing eggplant!  Yumm. You really have to go there to try it, because any attempt to explain would be doing the dish a disservice. \\n\\nFinally, for the main event, I can't quite decide which dish (sausage stuffed squid or Chille Gemelle) was more memorable because they were both so tasty. The squid ink was a very unfamiliar flavor (in a good way) and even more unfamiliar looking dish, but it was so equisite. A must try.\\n\\nFinally, the Chilli Gemelle had the chilli folded into the fresh made pasta, giving the pasta a red hue. Made with Polpettine, peppers and fennel pollen, it would not be hyperbole to suggest it was one of the better pastas I've had. Perhaps not the same dramatic flavors as the previous dishes, but my wife and I remarked that if you paired it with the fresh made bread and the eggplant, you could probably get an incredible, filling meal for 2 for $35. \\n\\nOverall, I don't think I'd rate it higher than Langbaan and I'd have to revisit some of Portland's old favorite (Le Pigeon, Beast) to given an appropriate rating on whether it should be \\"Oregon's Restaurant of the Year\\", but given the choice for an incredible sub-$100 foodie experience in Portland, this would have to top the list."},{"name":"Winflo Osteria","address":"1315 W 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"I really like the atmosphere.

Not to mention 400 beer choices, and every one I've had, I've liked.

Not cool, Green Dragon.  Also, because I pay for it, every single time, I can tell you that their BBQ sauce is pretty decent.  Argh.\\n\\nSecond, and I issue a heartfelt apology to the waitress ALWAYS working in the back near the second bar, who is seriously overworked but who is always really nice: it takes 30 minutes to order anything.  They need to get more staff at this place, pronto.  This one really nice woman is always running around to her 43 tables, shuffling beer and food, and there's just no way she can get to anyone faster than 30 minutes between beers.

My husband and I moved to Austin a year ago and tried this place for the first time last night. It started out alright. We were pleasantly surprised at the cheap margarita specials they run on Thursday. Since there was a bit of a wait we grabbed margarita out front and waited for about 20 minutes. The margarita was alright. Nothing special.\\n\\nOnce we sat down, we waited, and waited. And then waited some more. \\n\\nEventually a shorthaired blonde waitress came up to us, there was no real greeting, we weren't even offered waters or another margarita to start. We were asked if we were ready to order. Honestly, my husband and I were a bit surprised so we said we would like a queso but we weren't ready to order. \\n\\nChips and salsa were delivered. The person that delivered it sloshed our salsa all over the patio floor before setting it on our table. Lovely.\\n\\nThen our queso came out. The same person that delivered our salsa and chips, sloshed the queso all over the floor again, said \\"oops\\" set it on the table and then walked away again!! Seriously? I can only imagine how many times that happens in a day and never gets cleaned up. So filthy. I will say that the chips, salsa, and queso were pretty delicious though. \\n\\nOur server eventually came back and took our order. I ordered the taco salad and my husband ordered the quesadilla. 45 minutes later our food came out. The quesadilla looked pretty standard...no complaints there. As I went to take my first bite of my taco salad, I realized my salad was sitting in a bowl of water (please see attached photo). My salad had more water/liquid in it than lettuce. Well I would assume it was water, but maybe that is giving them the benefit of the doubt? Who knows what it was. \\n\\nI continued to wait for the server to follow up with us on how our food is.  She never came back. I eventually asked a bus boy if there was a manager around. The manager came over and immediately saw what was wrong with my salad. We told him we just wanted to pack up my husbands food and go. The manager was nice. You could tell he was super flustered and it had been a bad night (same with our waitress). For some reason he thought we were wanting a whole new taco salad. Honestly, I was over this place at this point as did not want to wait for another salad. Our waitress never came back over.

While he never left us in any want of water or bread, his general demeanor was of one who looked like he had better things to do than serve us and his tone when talking seemed very impatient. While my boyfriend and I always like Simon (we try to request him all the time too) tonight we probably would have been better off with someone else.\\n\\nGrilled Salmon: there were bones in my salmon filet, and it didn't help that I only discovered the bone once it was stuck in my throat.

I've had all the meats on the menu, and they've all been what I wanted them to be. That's job number one for a barbecue joint, and they do it right.  The biscuits have also always been fantastic; huge fluffy and delicious, well complemented by the honey butter.  The other sides were extremely bland at first, but they improved the seasoning after a while and they're risen to the pretty good level now.  Personally I get the mac and cheese and the potato salad most of the time, but that's what I get at most bbq places I go.  The sauces have never been very good, and I almost never see anyone use them.  But right thinking people know properly done bbq doesn't need a sauce.

It is no longer a sports bar with food....its a restaurant whew you would be comfortable taking your kids and watch your favorite sports team at the same time! There is this cool like nook when you walk in that has gaming systems and comfy seats for the little kids (or big kids), to play while you wait or all night if you want! It's so cool! \\n\\nMy large party got there around 6:30 and we were seated within 15 minutes. The group of hostesses were very cute and so friendly. Our waitress Ally came right away and was full of smiles and energy. Our drinks came out in good time for a large group. Ally was on it. She constantly checked on us. Not only did she check on us but other wait staff and runners continued to check on us through the entire time we were there. \\n\\nThe Food: Can you say DELICIOUS. There was not one thing that we tried that was not good! \\nHere is what we got: \\nAppetizers - Buffalo Chicken Dip. Pita Nachos. Loaded Potato Soup. BBQ Pork Potato Skins.  \\nDinners - Cheese Pizza. Garlic Cheese Bread. Santa Fe Bowl (GF). Thai Bowl (GF). Rib Dinner. Garlic Shrimp Pasta. Garlic Parmesan Boneless Chicken wings. Various build your own burgers. \\nCan I just tell you that ALL 12 people in our party did not have ONE complaint about the food. All you heard was \\"Oh My God this is so good\\" and \\"Delicious\\". \\nNot only is the food good but the prices are so cheap! You can totally take your family and it's so affordable!   \\n\\nThe Drinks/Cocktails: They have a cool menu with a beer, shot, drink and pitcher of the month special. \\nI got the Harry Buffalo mixed drink pitcher. It was really tasty but I'll be honest not worth the $15, but I like things a little strong.\\nThe Hair of the Dog pitcher was not my cup of tea but everyone else loved it!\\nWe got Little Beer shots and they were made perfectly!  Their shot of the month for February was just ok. I wasn't a fan. \\nThe drinks came out quickly which is usually what you wait long for at a restaurant. My hats off to the bar. As a fellow bartender they did a great job with the drinks. \\n\\nOne of the owners Lee came over when he could see we were almost done eating at the perfect time to not interrupt our meal. He was so friendly and talked to us for a while about the process and the changes that are still to come for the outside and banquet room that they haven't even had a chance to work on yet. I am excited to see how it turns out! \\n\\nHands down this place is 100% worth your time and money!

First date? Perfect. Parents in town? Good for that too. Need good food before heading over to the Behan? Not a better place around. Next time my mother-in-law is in town we are taking her here. Next time my brother is in town we are taking him here. It's that sorta good. I wanna take everyone here just so I can go again.\\" \\n\\nReplace Zon's with The Haven and it all still applies. And, not to sound sacrilege, because I dearly loved Zon's, The Haven does everything just a little better. \\n\\nFirst, the service. Always lovely. Always warm. I met the owner, Jason, before they were even close to opening because he was selling a bunch of leftover Zon stuff. I now have Zon's old dining room chairs, nicely refurbished, in my dining room. His excitement about the new place was contagious- I couldn't wait for it to open. And it seems that excitement trickles down to the rest of the staff as well. \\n\\nSecond, the food. Oh my god, best fish and chips on this side of the pond. The mushy peas! The homemade ketchup! The perfectly crispy fish! It's UK heaven on a plate! And, yes, Husband says the haggis is really good too. Not that he can compare it to anything not having been to Scotland and there only being one Scottish restaurant in the area. He says it's got that umami flavor that makes you want to keep shoveling it in your mouth. Get the haggis omelet at brunch. \\n\\nAnd finally, because it's so good it deserves it's own paragraph: the deep fried mars bars. Full context- I'm not a huge dessert person and I hate mars bars. I don't like chocolate that much and I don't like caramel and I really don't like chocolate and caramel together. Unless, it seems, they've been battered and deep fried.

A quick peek at the menu made us excited, and we were staying in NE anyways, so we drove over and found parking easily a block away. (As an aside, why is the parking here so complicated?! One stretch is for 15 min parking only, another stretch of the same block is for 30 min, and yet another stretch of the same block might be for 2 hours!)\\n\\nWe went in and it was a pretty full house but the wait would only be approximately 15 min, which was not bad, and allowed us to thoroughly review the menu while waiting.

Obviously my order was already running late. I called their store at 10:45 to check on my delivery since it hadn't arrived and the manager said he would call the driver. 15 minutes later I still hadn't heard anything so I called again. The manager said that his driver was lost and that he told the driver to call me for directions. When I expressed concern about my food being cold, he told me to call back if it arrived cold and he'd \\"take care of it right away.\\" So, after another 15 minutes of no call from the driver, I called again and once again spoke to the manager. When I questioned whether our order would even be arriving at all this evening, the manager told us it would be free when it got here and the driver (apparently his first night of work) should be here shortly.

I had to get up & go to the bar to request condiment.\\n\\nThe girl brings the checks (we're supposed to have 2). My daughter is paying for her & friend & I'm paying for the rest of us as we stated when she asked in the first place. We pay cash because the way she's explaining to how to pay with cards sounds like we need a tech degree on their table machine. I'm sure its not that serious but she was a mess explaining. So while we're getting our cash together the server is standing there hovering over us like we're trying to dine n dash or something. I was kind of stuck where I was seated, but as I was able to get out I dropped the cash on the table in front of her & she gave me a snide \\"thaaaaaannnnnks\\". \\n\\nThen our little group is standing outside chatting before parting ways & out comes our server in a very accusatory manner saying that we didn't pay for one of the guests & was very rude about it. Finally (to make a long story short) it gets figured out that she split the check 3 ways instead of 2. The friend didn't notice & neither did the rest of us because we were only thinking about 2 checks! So the friend pays her for the missing meal, but wow this girl was so unprofessional.\\n\\nDefinitely won't be back."},{"name":"Rain Pearl Bubble Tea and Play House","address":"2586 Commercial Drive","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"came here with a friend seeing how it is the only bubble tea bar close to my area, and was pretty disappointed :( I ordered a fresh fruit avocado shake and could barely taste the avocado, it was really watered down with milk and had very little ice. sort of tasted like milk with sugar.

Los Amigos had a row of counter seats along the window, and a patio table set out front.\\n\\nI went with the fish taco - 2 for $7 ($7.49 after tax).  It arrived hot in a styrofoam take-out container lined with aluminium foil.  Good thing too since the salsa didn't have the juices strained from it.  I nudged aside the shredded lettuce and salsa to get a gander of the fish - a sizeable, yet thin fillet.  I have no idea why they cut their limes into these half segments which make it tough to get the juices out, but I did what I could and manhandled these double tortilla-ed bundles into my mouth.  The tortillas ripped here and there along the way, and the juices dripped through my fingers as salsa and lettuce dropped onto the foil.

I'd been here several times but surprisingly not in the last few years ... too many new restaurants to try! But this place is good - definitely one of the better & more authentic Cantonese restaurants in Atlanta. \\n\\nWe ordered 1 soup & 5 dishes for 6 people - and it was the perfect amount of food. Picked dishes that had gotten good reviews. Everything was delicious.\\n\\nFISH MAW & CRAB SOUP - $8.95 \\nMenu says the bowl of soup serves 2 people but if your party is fine with just a small bowl for each person, 1 soup served 6 people perfectly. Honestly I'm not a soup person so I thought the portion was perfect - plus I just wanted a sample anyway b/c all the reviews were raving about the soup. The soup was perfect comfort food for the cold weather, and had the same thick consistency & similar taste of egg drop soup. Only 1 piece of crab though ... we gave that bowl to the birthday girl :) \\n\\nPEKING SPARE RIBS - $12.95\\nYum, the coating for these ribs tasted like candy :) It's only b/c the spare ribs were deep-fried that I didn't eat more. I loved loved loved the flavor of the sauce. Probably my favorite dish of the evening. \\n\\nSNOW PEA LEAVES WITHOUT CRABMEAT - $12.95\\nMenu has \\"snow pea leaves with crabmeat\\" for $19.95 but you can custom order w/o crab for $12.95. Take note - this dish is different from the \\"snow peas\\" which is also on the menu. Yum - this dish has always been a favorite, and theirs is no exception. Dish was wiped clean.\\n\\nPAN-FRIED SPICY SALTY SQUID - $12.95\\nThis is probably Canton Cook's most popular dish: salt-n-pepper squid. Nice size pieces of squid. Just slightly spicy. Served w/ jalapenos too if you need an extra kick. Yum.\\n\\nBLACK PEPPER STEAK - $12.50\\nAnother very tasty dish. Also served with green pepper & onions. This was a favorite, and this dish was wiped clean. My friend pretty much licked the plate with her finger. I'm serious. \\n\\nMAPU TOFU W/ MINCED PORK - $8.95\\nAnother good dish.\\n\\nAll of us enjoyed the food very much - and the food comes out pretty quick.

I think it was perfect timing, because it was right after the initial early dinner rush, and before the 7:30pm dinner rush.

Lucky us!\\n\\nI was here on a ramen mission, but they have a few sobas that looked really appealing. Next time, next time.\\n\\nYou get a little bowl of edamame to nibble on while you wait for your food, it was a nice touch! No charge for tea, awesome.\\n\\nI got the Cya-syu-men with the Ton Kotsu broth and switched the thin straight noodles for the thick curly noodles. The pork bone broth is perfect. The chashu pork was very tender, and it definitely came with more than 3 slices, so props to that. They give you sesame seeds and minced garlic on the side to add as you please. ALSO: as someone who doesn't like bean sprouts, the ramen did not come with any. Hooray! No need to pick around it.\\n\\nMy friend got the Kakuni Ramen, which was also made with pork bone broth and had pork belly instead of chashu. After a taste-test with her consent, the broth was as equally delicious as the Ton Kotsu broth, and the pork belly just melted in your mouth - they must have been cooking it for a very long time.

The blonde woman cook across from us was on her game. I wish I could have paid more to get her. Oh, and watch for the Asian lady that seems to stand in the shadows and watch the cooks. She was staring at the blonde cook like she was waiting for her to screw up or something. It's a shame if I'm right about that because being a Teppan chef myself I can tell you that she was laser focused on cooking each item to perfection. Unlike the talentless blob cooking at our table.
