Even if I was a racist, even if my best friend wasn't as black as Tae Diggs, how the hell could these girls even imagine they weren't going to catch some backlash for talking like that in public? I called them some very crass but appropriate names, and went back to the private room. \\n\\nThe waitress took over and hour to bring me back my card. I had to bug her, her coworkers, and her boss, none of which I enjoy, just to get it back so I could leave. Finally she brought it, and I tipped less than I normally do, out of drunken anger and frustration. The waitress immediately opens the checks we wrote (four of us did this, she was so awful), and accosts all of us about giving her more money. On top of the 70 dollars I paid for 4 drinks. \\n\\nSeriously, don't go here.

During both visits, I enjoyed excellent service and good food, making this a reliable and acceptable barbecue joint. The fried pickles and jalape√±os offered as an appetizer are a tasty, if not unnecessary, way to start off a meal (though, honestly, the smaller pickles that dominated my first order were preferable to the larger cuts prevalent during my second visit). For entrees, I've tried both the pulled pork sandwich and the fried catfish sandwich, both of which were quite satisfying. The pulled pork was tender and infused with an excellent mix of spices while the catfish was fried perfectly in a batter that didn't try to mask the fish's delicate flavor. I ordered the former as a plate while opting for the \\"solo\\" option for the latter, and a decision I ultimately regretted as I was still hungry after finishing the sandwich. Considering the quality sides that accompanied the pulled pork sandwich, I was disappointed that much more by my choice. Don't repeat my mistake unless, of course, you're certain you will be too full to try even a small sample of the sides a plate includes.\\n\\nThe first floor's decor is reminiscent of Southern barbecue restaurants I've visited, but descending to the lower level, you would be forgiven for thinking you've entered a different restaurant bedecked in a hippie surfer motif. Thankfully, having two levels allows this extremely-popular restaurant to reasonably accommodate the capacity crowds it regularly attracts. To this point, almost any time I pass Chester Street on a weekend, there are people waiting out front for tables. Should you find yourself in the area with a barbecue craving and some patience, a visit to Redbones is well-advised."},{"name":"Jam On Hawthorne","address":"2239 SE Hawthorne Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"In reality a 3.5 star rating, but, I like to round up ;)\\n\\nPer a friend's recommendation we chose to come to Jam for brunch. We came on a Sunday around 11AM - which, as you know, is prime brunch time. There was already a hefty little queue forming outside of the door and down the outer walls. They provided chairs and tables outside for the hungry waiters to sit at as well as a bottomless coffee stand ($2.75 per mug, bring it back to your table). Unfortunately, due to the large crowd, the coffee dispenser was frequently empty. The staff did try to refill it constantly, but there was only so much they could do.\\n\\nTurnaround seemed pretty quick because the line was constantly moving. By 11:41, the hostess came to retrieve and seat us. To us, a 41 minute wait is not that bad (compared to the occasional 1.5-2+ hour waits in SF, if you were to arrive at the same time/day). Major plus.\\n\\nThe menu has your usual brunch items. We settled on an eggs benedict and corned beef hash. We also ordered the famous maddie cake (lemon ricotta pancake, blueberry compote). The boyfriend also ordered a bloody mary.\\n\\nOverall, I felt that the food was very much okay. Nothing stood out to me as spectacular and particularly memorable. Eggs benedict was nice and yolky, but there was no 'WOW' factor (hollandaise sauce was okay). Personally was not a huge fan of the corned beef hash actually. Pancake was probably my favorite part - but nothing I haven't had before (similar at La Note in Berkeley). I want to iterate - the food is good, but theres nothing amazing about it.

The place is rather more upscale than the Mexican restaurants I usually frequent, and it was a welcome change. (Though I honestly love the cheesy decor at many Austin establishments.

(Supposedly, you have to pay $1 or $2 for chips and salsa, but we weren't charged. Do with that what you will). The house margarita I ordered was delish AND strong, so I only ordered one.

While tables were available indoors, my wife had requested a patio table, and we chose to wait.  We took a seat at the beautiful bar and were treated like the most important people in the world by our bartender, who went through the ample list of house specialty drinks with us and made recommendations.  He even modified the recipe for one of the drinks a bit to accommodate my wife's taste for something a bit less sweet.  She had the modified Belvedere Sparkle, and I had the Ginger Walnut Manhattan, which was complex turn from the traditional Manhattan--not sweet, slightly bitter, and lots of flavors made it a perfect pre-dinner drink.\\n\\nWe were still working on our cocktails when we were greeted by the hostess, who ushered us to our table at the back of the patio, near the fountain.  The patio was full of patrons enjoying the beautiful Ohio evening.  The patio is filled with plants and lit by gas lights, with the fountain and pool providing a nice level of white noise to cover the voices of the other diners.\\n\\nWe stuck with small plates from the ample menu, although when we go back (and we will), we will have to try one of the entrees or paella.  We opened with the Chorizo Picante, a plate of spicy sausage that perked up our palates, along with Queso Idiazabal, a delicious smoky sheep's milk cheese.  Next, we had the Gazpacho, a cool blend of tomatoes and cucumber, and the Ensalada de Judias Verde, a wonderful green bean salad with feta and pistachios.  I would recommend all of these choices.\\n\\nFor the main course, we selected  Costillas (short ribs in mushroom sauce), Mejiloones (mussels in an indescribably delicious spicy cream broth with chorizo), Ensalada de Coles de Bruselas (cold Brussels sprouts) and Aguacate Relleno con Queso (avocados with tomato vinaigrette).  The short ribs were melt-in-your-mouth tender.  The Brussels sprouts were a nice side dish. The avocado was \\"meh\\" (our only real disappointment).  But the mussels.  Oh, the mussels.  I awoke later that night in my hotel dreaming of them.  My wife asked for extra bread from our wonderful server just for the purpose of soaking up the spicy, creamy broth.  I could have eaten myself into a stupor with them.  We accompanied everything with a bottle of Zerran, a Spanish Garnacha blend red wine that was a great complement to the meal and a good value.\\n\\nFor dessert, we shared lavender apple pie and coffee.\\n\\nI am usually not so effusive with praise for a restaurant, but both my wife and I love Barcelona, and we look forward to the opportunity to eat there again.

To our dismay, the place was pretty busy, so we had to sit outside under a covered patio area where seating was still available.  They had fans blowing in our direction, but life could have been cooler.  Anyway, we were thankful to get a place before we collapsed from exhaustion!  One perk at sitting outside though, is that you have a nice view of the lake where fireworks happen every night!  \\n\\nI couldn't wait for our waters to be served while we ordered additional beverages.  I got the \\"Magical cocktail\\", while Joe ordered an English dark lager.  My drink was fruity and refreshing!  Unfortunately, I don't remember what kind of alcohol was mixed in, but it really hit the spot!  Another nice touch, is that with certain signature cocktails, you get a free lighted \\"ice cube\\" in your drink.

I prefer fruits, vegetables and salads.  But I was pleasantly surprised to find on their menu, not only salads, but vegetable pie!  Needless to say, I just had to give it a try!  Joe K ordered the traditional fish & chips with a side of Yorkshire pudding.  He seemed to enjoy his food, but complained that the Yorkshire pudding was not what he expected.  It was overcooked, tough and dried out!  In fact, by the looks of it, it didn't even represent what it was supposed to be!  I on the other hand, had one of the best meals I have had in a long time!  The pie was filled with a creamy mixture of carrots, peas, pearl onions, mushrooms, and topped with cheesy mashed potatoes!  The whole combination of flavors was delicious in every spoonful!  My only disappointment was that it was too small of a serving!  I probably could have eaten two of them!  But at least I was able to share some of Joe's fish & chips.  \\n\\nAlong with the food and drinks, our server Natalie, catered to our needs in a friendly manner, and gave us great service through our whole visit!\\n\\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ntkCWXFwflw\\n\\nI feel compelled to ad a concern of mine that doesn't necessarily have to do with this review in particular.  But while we were eating out on the patio, I noticed a tower like structure nearby and wondered what it was at the time.  A bird decided to land on it to rest and look around.  I thought it was cute and took a photo.  Not thinking much more of it until later, when Joe and I stayed for the big fireworks display at another section near the lake.  As we waited for the event to happen, I realized these towers turned out to be huge torches that lit up as soon as darkness fell.  My heart stopped, when I suddenly remembered about the bird that had perched on it during the day.  Although it did fly away, I started to worry about what if other birds had ever been on these torches when they burst into flame?  I just hope that Disney World is aware of this and have placed preventative measures to warn wildlife about this impending danger that happens every night!

I was in Boston area for business for a few days and had a few meals here and there but nothing really blew my mind or was worth noting. On my last day in MA I was in the area and decided to stop by! \\n\\nThis place is nice and small... but the wait is insane! From what I heard from the servers, this place stops taking names for dinner on weekdays typically around 8:30 (they close at 9:30 on weekdays), and on weekends they told me its not unusual for them to stop taking names around 7-7:30 (they close at 10:30 on weekends!)!!!\\nWho does that?! lol... so this already shows how amazing this place is.\\nLuckily I came by myself and snatched a bar seat!\\n\\nFrom what I heard, MA is best known for the lobster (or lobster roll) and clam chowder. By that time, I had already had a lobster roll from another well rated restaurant known for their lobster roll (and I don't really like lobster all that much!)... so by the time I got to this place, I really wasn't feeling another lobster roll. However, upon the recommendation from everyone in the restaruant, I deicded to give it one more go....\\n\\nSo starting off with the main entree, I got the lobster roll... and boy am I glad I got that!!! It definitely knocked my socks off and made me rethink liking lobster (as I'm more of a shrimp guy)! The lobster was hot and succulent. The meat tasted like they just picked out a lobster out of the sea, cooked it in a tub of butter, and got all the meat out... all in one go!! I don't think I've had lobster this good before and I was flabbergasted at how good it was! If I had more money and if they let me, I would've tried to take one to go (too bad they don't do to-go orders though because of how busy they are). The lobster was very buttery, hot as it came out to me, and cooked to perfection. You could taste a bit of the sea left in it as well!\\nI'm not sure if they make their own rolls but would not be surprised if they do! Because their roll held up pretty nicely as well and was the perfect partner in crime for all those huge chunks of lobster!\\n\\nAlso got their clam chowerder and had to try some of their oysters as well. Their clam chowder was a bit different from the west coast clam chowder it seemed... The chowder tasted a bit more... \\"ocean-like\\"? if that makes sense... probably doesn't but it was really good. I was impressed. Their oysters were probably a little less excited just because I've had some amazing oysters already. I got the island creek (from Duxbury, MA), and the Beausoleil (from Shippagan, NB) from the recommondation of my server. The island creek was better but was not super impressed in that arena (not to say it wasn't good like I said, but I've had amazing oysters already on west coast already). \\n\\nOnce you sit down, service is great and food comes out reletively fast (if you aren't in a huge group or anything). So all in all, a fantastic last dinner at Boston MA. I am very glad I took the effort to drive down-town to get this meal. I can't imagine anyone getting a better lobster (or lobster roll) better than this place. The price and wait are def worth it. Therefore this place gets 5 stars in my book!

The restaurant ambience was soothing and calm; perfect for the occasion! The service was excellent and very attentive. The appetizers, grilled oysters and alligator bites were delicious. Overall experience was great. A bit pricey and menu selection a bit limited but different then normal restaurants. I was a bit disappointed because the servers knew it was my wife's birthday, yet no surprise little cupcake with a candle or complimentary desert sample at the end of the meal. After paying over two hundred dollars between drinks, appetizers, and meals, I think the restaurant should offer (even if I have to pay) a little token of celebration (I'm not referring to have all servers come and sing because I find that to be too much) such as a little acknowledgment  desert sample or so forth.

He looked at me like I had 5 heads or something.  Just so you're aware in NC you eat hushpuppies with a side of butter or a side of butter packets for dipping.  There isn't any other way to eat them there.  They might be served with vinegar in another part of the country like TX or TN or something that I'm just not aware of.  When I got the side of butter, I picked up one hushpuppy and attempted to dip it in the butter and it disintegrated immediately.  They were really dry so maybe that is why they serve them with vinegar.  I didn't like them at all.  \\n\\nNext I tried a combo platter with ribs and pulled pork.

The Santorini comes with a fair amount of ingredients and having them add some gyro meat bolsters the flavor.  \\n\\nThe lamb shank - a special on Thursday nights -- is excellent and the portions are very large.  Gyros are decent but their tzatziki sauce is a under-spiced and comes in a skimpy portion.  The Athens potatoes, which come as a side with many entrees, are flavorful but sometimes come out cold or barely lukewarm, which is something that both the servers and kitchen should watch more carefully.  \\n\\nMost of the time, the service is good, even when crowded or serving a group of people at the table.  Servers are almost always cheerful, friendly and outgoing, and try to do their best to stay on top of things, even when the place is busy.

First let me say it's been over a year since we last (attempted) to eat here. Hubby bought a Groupon to take me on a surprise dinner date. So incredibly glad that 1. we did not bring the kids 2. it was not full price. Food that should be hot was room temp and food that should be cold was warm. The appetizer was awful, the \\"roasted\\" garlic was raw. My pasta dish was oily, as in an excess pool of oil and excessively salty. My husband ate his dish without verbally complaining to me but the look on his face and the stomachache shortly after we left said it all. The up side was the server, she was friendly.

They all stepped up in a major ways too. The beer wagon had dropped off and plugged in to keep the kegs cold the day before we got married. The day of the wedding it was discovered that the electrical to the field we were getting married in had just given out. Zach  went and got enough dry ice to take the temp back down to ideal drinking temps (down from 65 degrees!).

But the smoothie was in a mini-cup at a normal-price, which made no sense to me. That makes me re-think everything, honestly. It's like their trying to make more profit off of you. You deserve that regular sized smoothie cup when your paying 4.50 for a smoothie. Or maybe it's all organic so they have to put it in small cups to save money? I don't know.. (trying to be open-minded here...)\\n\\nTo the food... I got a small bowl thing (since I ordered a smoothie with it, I figured I would only need a small bowl, since I figured that the smoothie would be in a regular sized cup). Boy I was wrong--cause the bowl was tiny! The small size should've been called \\"tiny bowl\\" because I finished it and I was left hungry. It was more like a cup than a bowl. The dude recommend me to get both sauces on it, and it was awful, really. They drenched the rice and beans with the sauce(s) to the point of asphyxiation. It was honestly really difficult for me to eat it because I really found it unappetizing. I can honestly say that I rarely get food where this happens...where it's actually difficult for me to finish it. But, I did finish it cause I was starving--and I hate wasting money. I could've made a bean/rice thing at home for way cheaper--and organic! And they put some little salsa on top that was yucky salsa (I've lived in southern California-border of Mexico, people), and then topped it off with some olive things that just didn't mesh well with the beans and rice. I don't know.. I wasn't expecting olives and crappy salsa to be on top. I'm still sorta grossed out from thinking about it.\\n\\nI'm sad to write this review because these people were so sweet, but only a certain type of person can eat here--and it's not me. Eat here if you don't mind spending extra money for food you can make at home better. Eat here if you don't mind buying a smaller cup smoothie (but good) at regular smoothie price.

We went because I had purchased a Groupon for the place. However the highlight of the night was their flavored Naan. Yum! You can choose between 10 or more different flavors and they use that for their Naan. Think - bruschetta naan, sweet dessert like naan, spicy naan, etc. I don't know any other place that does that. \\n\\n\\nHowever since then I have been there probably 3-4 times for their lunch buffet with coworkers. And I really like it. It's not as cheap as some Indian buffets but the quality and diversity is better I think here. Vegans beware - they put butter (ghee) in their rice. Weird, I don't know any other Indian restaurant that does that. However some of the entrees on their buffet are vegan and usually their soups are vegan. They always have fruit for dessert + another dessert (usually not vegan like pudding, etc.). However because they know that their rice isn't vegan, they will make vegans a special type of bread which is awesome. I really do like that special touch. \\n\\nYou will leave the buffet super full and in an food coma after wards, regardless of your diet! \\n\\nBest part about the whole place - their crazy decor and bathrooms.

I'd heard a lot about this place but had never tried it, except for a very small sample I had at the chili cook-off in Baldwin Park earlier this year. That small sample wasn't enough for me to form an opinion, plus I'm a chili fan (vegetarian or otherwise) and I'd heard much about Chili Daddy's varied menu, so I was overdue for a trip here.\\n\\nThere's much to be had here - the menu offers tacos, chili by itself, chili dogs, sides and more. I wasn't feeling super-adventurous when I was here, so I opted for three tacos. At least one had the mango chicken in it, and I know I had a pineapple/ginger chicken one, as well. All were tasty and filling. I would definitely try each again, though perhaps if I make it back then I'll have to try at least one chili on its own. I'm curious to give a few others a shot. My mother makes a very good chili, and in the past I've had many other ones that are just as good, so I'm into trying new chilis and experiencing the different spices, ingredients and flavors. There's a lot at Chili Daddy that I'd like to try (I didn't get to try the Frito Pie that I've read so much about), so hopefully I'll be back sooner rather than later.\\n\\nThe prices are a little high for my liking, so I'll have to be a little more selective if I make it back here. I wanted to try a few other things, but I'd already paid I think maybe around $8-$9 (?) for the three tacos and a soda, so I didn't want to overdo it.\\n\\nGive this place a try if you like chili or would like some unique tacos. Chris R. recommended the tacos here, and that's what I had, and I didn't leave disappointed or still hungry.\\n\\nOne final note: There was a shaker of ghost chili pepper up on the counter. I was tempted to try it, but Chris R. advised against it. I'm morbidly curious to experience it, but maybe I never will. Chris said that even one sprinkle of that on a taco or anything else would require a person to have lots of water, milk and some other stuff handy afterwards. I think he even mentioned a defibrillator or something like that. I think he was just joking about that last part, though ...

I ordered some sort of Quesidillas and they were okay, but definitely nothing special. I think I have had better at Taco Bell. Also, maybe it was just because we went during a busy time, but the service was pretty darn slow. AND they forget two parts of order. Lastly, I must say that this location just doesn't compare to others I have been to.

Unfortunately, the Cubano turned out to be a poor choice.  The bread was toasted poorly and it was rock hard (as in that raw feeling on the top of your mouth after you eat hard).  The meat was good but the pickles were not bread & butter pickles.  A proper Cubano (at least how I always like/eat it) needs the bread & butter pickles to add the sweet component to the sandwich.  Instead, the sandwich included dill pickles that just did not work with the rest of the sandwich.

Let me get this out of the way first.  I guess I'm just not a fan of fusion cuisine.  Vindalho is NOT an Indian (or any other nationality in that region) restaurant.

My partner and I had heard about, whilst also read some fantastic reviews about this place and definitely thought we would pay it a visit on a trip to Portland. Upon arrival we were informed about the 'happy hour menu' but were told we would have to wait for two spots at the bar which was honestly fine by us! A lady came and asked us if she could help us with drinks twice while we waited for two spots but we decided we would wait until we were comfortably seated. After around half an hour a lady on her own left and we headed over to claim the stool, unfortunately there was only one stool. I spotted more stools on the other side of the restaurant and asked whether it would be possible to grab one and place it for my partner to sit down. Apparently this wasn't possible for some reason that it was a service area however the previous customer had been sitting there just moments before! This was a huge disappointment after waiting for so long.  It was just one extra stool so we both would have been sitting at the bar together and this was denied, how ridiculous.

However, I told them I was pretty hungry and they gave me complimentary bread and a soda! How is THAT for first-class service that only Disney can provide?\\nSo... if I had to rate the SERVICE here... 5 stars. Hands down. The staff is great. I was especially fond of RAVEN. She was simply magical with my son and offered all she could to ensure we had a great night. \\nAlso... 5 stars would be for the VIEW at this restaurant.

Service!\\nSo why 4 stars?\\nI am just not so impressed with the food. :( \\nBread service? Blah. Sour sough and butter with salt on it? Where is the unique-ness? Where is the creativity.

We were at The Clyde Common sitting at the bar discussing dinner options with our bartender. A man sitting next to me recommended we try Little Bird after we mentioned Le Pigeon.  We walked in around 8:30 and the hostess kindly told us it would be about a 20 minute wait and asked us if we'd like a drink while we waited. We were actually sat within 5 minutes. We started with a half bottle of champagne and a dozen fresh Shigoku oysters on the half shell. Delicious start! We then moved on to a beautiful plate of charcuterie which included potted duck liver gelee; rich and buttery and melted in your mouth instantly. We wanted to try the glazed pork cheek next but we couldn't possibly fit it into our charcuterie filled belly's. For our final course I had the duck confit and my boyfriend had the roasted pork shoulder. I normally wouldn't order the duck, but I love brussel sprouts and salsify. The duck was tender, the brussel sprouts perfectly cooked, however the salsify puree was a bit salty- my only criticism. I ate practically the entire dish. The roasted pork shoulder was also excellently executed. Soft, succulent, and the crispy egg was the perfect addition. Our server was attentive, knowledgeable of menu items, and was able to give us good recommendations on wine. She did not rush us and everything was coursed out very nicely. And when our server had been phased she let us know appropriately and told us the bartender would then take good care of us and he did. We had a wonderful dining experience. We will definitely recommend Little Bird to friends and we hope to dine there again soon!"},{"name":"Redbones BBQ","address":"55 Chester St","city":"Somerville","stars":"3.5","text":"Great BBQ with an even better beer list."},{"name":"Cheese Bar","address":"6031 SE Belmont","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"This is a pretty great spot for cheese.

I don't know if the restaurant didn't read my Open Table reservation, but they didn't honor my request for a more private, romantic table (we were seated very closely between two other couples--so close it was as if we were dining with one of them).

It would have been nice to have a white wine and/or rose option on the wine flights beyond bubbles and reds.  The vibe was a bit pretentious.  It felt more like a big-city hotel restaurant for out-of-towners and business clients than a Portland neighborhood restaurant.  The menu is limited.  The portions were small (which we expected) and pricey.  $5 for dinner rolls seems excessive.  Keep in mind everything is served a la carte with no sides.\\n\\nPositives: The cocktails were fabulous (the widow's kiss, especially).  The wines-by-the-glass list is extensive.  The food was delicious and beautifully presented.  The sturgeon was the best I've ever had--incredibly tender and flavorful.  Our server was accommodating and attentive.

I like popping into Flour for a treat, whether it's a cup of coffee and a pastry, or an indulgent lunch sandwich.\\n\\nThe two big problems with this location are:\\n\\n-Flow. The layout of the restaurant doesn't handle crowds well, and Flour is ALWAYS crowded.

I don't think I've ever experienced such a level of oozingly outstanding decadence - I may just keel over into cardiac arrest any day now; nothings like butter and cholesterol to do you over...\\n\\nNeptune's is known for two things; their raw bar and their lobster roll... but it was our last day in Boston, so my BF and I went all out... oysters, shrimp, clam chowder, *johnycakes*, and their oh so coveted hot buttered lobster roll.\\n\\nThey have a list of 10-15 different items on their raw menu. They were out of the one oyster I was eyeing, but we still managed to order a selection of different raw oysters and clams, as well as some giant sweet shrimp... It was fun knocking them back and getting a taste for northeastern oysters. They were all smaller than I imagined them to be, but.the champagne hinted one was definitely my favorite... \\n\\nWhen in Boston, get clam chowder... right?? The clam chowder here was stock full of fresh clams... but it was also very runny and less creamy and typical chowder-texture like than I prefer. Id prob not recommend the chowder from Neptune's - head to Quincy Market instead? \\n\\nPer recommendation of the people sitting next to us at the bar and our waitress, we got the **Buttermilk Johnycakes** aka honey butter, smoked trout tartare, and Little Pearl caviar on a cornmeal pancake. If I were to give a dish to describe decadent, it would be this one... it tasted as if a whole stick of butter was put into it, and it was divine! There was a hint of acidity to each bit of sweet and salty, and it had a great sense of textures... If I were given whatever I wanted in my last dying meal, this would definitely be on that list of my dying last bites. It really is THAT good, and I would definitely recommend it!\\n\\nThe HOT buttered lobster roll... I'm typically not a huge fan of lobster; I prefer my crab and shrimp and raw seafood... but if lobster we're to be done any way, it should be done the way it is here at Neptune's: piled high and oozing with butter. Its over the top and definitely gonna require a few extra notches on your belt, but worth the go at least once if not more for the die-hard lobster fans.\\n\\nOverall an exceptional meal worth every penny.

I sent an email to a manager but received no response so I'm writing this review. I had made a reservation for 6 a few days beforehand to watch the World Cup and I specified inside. The gal I spoke with initially wasn't even sure they were taking reservations and certainly implied she didn't think it would be busy at that time. I was worried it might get crowded so I asked what time they would open that day. I was told 10am and to just arrive at 9:45-9:50 which I did. When I arrived, it was a madhouse with line out the door and apparently they had opened earlier. I also called the night before to update our reservation to 8 people. Both times the person I spoke with put me on hold to speak with a manager and then came back and confirmed the reservation. Since I had a reservation, when I arrived, I went up to the hostess/host booth to check-in. I was told I would need to speak to a person who I assume was the manager--a guy with very short, dark brown hair and broad shoulders who was wearing a white button down shirt with avocados on it. Right off the bat, he was very rude to me and I had done nothing provocative. I was completely taken aback. I merely told him that I had made a reservation and he told me I'd have to get in line and when I asked if I needed to get in line if even if I had a reservation for 10am, he gave me a total death stare. Mind you the line was very long and the game was about to start and I had 7 other people arriving momentarily. Anyway, I asked if my reservation would be honored once I got to the front of the line and he told me curtly to hold on. I stood there for what seemed quite awhile, 15 minutes I'd guess, no communication, no apology, no \\"we are working on it,\\" nothing. I wondered if he was hoping I'd just get frustrated and leave. Finally, we were seated outside in the worst table (no overhead fan) on this very hot day. I certainly understand that it could have been unexpectedly hectic and thus, stressful and I would have been certainly understanding. What I can't overlook was the unnecessary, rude treatment.

I don't have anything against children, or the people who choose to have them. However, they don't belong everywhere - particularly when they're borderline feral and shrieking at decibels that would make a harpy cringe. Unfortunately, there was no shortage of said type of children during my Saturday afternoon venture to Seven Hens. Of course, management has no control over who patronizes their establishment - nonetheless, positioning a business as family friendly can be a double edged sword. \\n\\nFood: Seven Hens is a casual eatery that serves various manifestations of chicken. The menu options are compiled using a three step process: first you choose your desired country (American, Mexican, Italian, French, Chinese, Indian, or Traveler), followed by style (baguette, wrap, platter, or salad), and finishing touches (spreads/sauces, dressing, toppings, cheese). Sides are also available in varying sizes at an additional cost (fries, coleslaw, cucumber salad, hummus, salad, chips). The default chicken preparation is breaded and lightly fried (schnitzel), but grilled, dark meat, and tofu are also available. I opted for the Italian baguette with a side of fries, while my dining partner ordered the Chinese. Both were decently flavored and made from fresh ingredients - neither sandwich was particularly mesmerizing, but both were perfectly acceptable.\\n\\nService: There is no table service - all orders are placed at the back counter and patrons pick-up their food once it's prepared. The two gentleman working the counter and kitchen were friendly, eager to please, and working as quickly as they could. However, it appeared as if they were overwhelmed but the onslaught of Scoutmob patrons. There was no wait when I first arrived, but by the time I left the line was at least 6 deep - they could have used an additional set of hands to operate the register so the remaining staff could concentrate on manning the kitchen. \\n\\nAtmosphere: The restaurant is clean and welcoming, but small and decorated in a manner that's mildly reminiscent of a commercial chain enterprise - the walls are plastered with posters of people engorging on each of the seven menu options. The clientele during my visit was predominately college students and families with children.\\n\\nCost: Reasonably priced. Baguettes and wraps are $7.49, platters are $7.99, and salads are $6.99. Only the platter comes with two sides, but a side and fountain drink can be added to the other options for $2.50. A la carte sides are $1.49-$2.25. \\n\\nOther: Seven Hens is located at the corner of North Decatur Rd and Clairmont Rd - in the same plaza as Mattress Firm and Mediterranean Grill. The restaurant use trans-free canola oil and all natural chicken. Hours of operation are Monday-Saturday, 11AM-9PM, and Sunday, 11AM-8PM."},{"name":"Pho Pasteur","address":"682 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"My husband had been in Boston just last week and heard from a number of people that he just had to go here.

I can't complain about double-layered corn tortillas, though.\\n\\nI was happy to find both a red and a green salsa at the bottom of my bag, though I wasn't a fan of either of them.

We arrived at around 3:00 on a Saturday afternoon, and were told a table would be available in an hour and a half.  They called our cellphone after half an hour, which was OK, and just before we were about to order an iced coffee at Modern Bakery in Hanover St.  A good thing.  The Neptune is tiny, but inviting, and the service first rate.  Now for the food and drink.  We began with prosecco and oysters; at B&G we had cremant de Bourgogne with our oysters.  The B&G wine was vastly superior--more brut-ish, less sweet.  They cost the same.  As for the oysters, both places were excellent, though on balance I preferred those at B&G, and the mignonette and cocktail sauces were better.  Moving on, we preferred the lobster salad and skate wing at B&G to the crab salad and warm lobster roll at Neptune.  The lobster roll while very good and meaty would have benefited from a piece of lemon.  The french fries were past their prime, thin and very dark, with ketchup as a condiment.  As for the ambiance, B&G won hands down--we sat on their terrrace on a glorious day, shaded by a large awning, not in a tiny bar-like interior cooled by fans (there is no a/c).  Also, you can park near B&G, and the meters don't require feeding on Saturday after 2:00.  That said, we would return to both, possibly choosing in accordance with the weather.

As I told you during our previous exchange, the taste of our coffees were so poor (we had both different ones) that we ordered more, thinking something went wrong when you prepared them.  So in total 4 different coffees and different brews.  And I could tell when we left you could guess that we were not impressed by our drinks.  We even asked you what kind of feedback other customers had for you, telling you it is \\"interesting\\" without a smile.

You can also sit at a table outside, behind the building, surrounded by trees, it is very pleasant (do not let your little ones wander around though, the road is still very close.)\\nThe menu offers a variety of coffees, with the description of the different roasts.  The owner seems passionate and eager to share his knowledge about his craft.  He warned us that it would take a few minutes to prepare our coffee and I have no problem waiting if that means the coffee will be good.  \\nWhen our coffees arrived, we were surprised by the color, not black but brown and quite light.  After all, Turkish coffee is brownish too, so why not.  But then, when I tasted it, and tasted it again in disbelief , I could not find the expected coffee taste.  My friend had a the same experience (she had ordered a different kind of \\"black\\" coffee.)  We really did not know what to think, this was more like hot water slightly flavored with  something you can't even call coffee .  There must be a mistake we thought, that can happen, somehow, he got the proportions or whatever else wrong.  \\nSo, we decided to give him another chance, the guy is so friendly and seems  to have such expertise in the area of coffee. This time, I ordered an espresso and my friend another kind of black coffee.  \\nHer coffee came once again as light as tea, my espresso was darker, but so bitter, it was impossible to drink.  My friend's cup of coffee was as tasteless as the previous ones.  \\nSo, I really don't understand all the great reviews about the coffee at Precision Pours.

My all-time favorite comfort food (Grandma's mac and cheese that could compete with any good chef's version) now has competition. Sure she used sharp cheddar, and fresh, sometimes farm fresh milk (and none of that added color junk).  But then I tried The Soup Peddler's Cassoulet.\\n\\nTheir cassoulet a dish primarily made up of the dreaded white bean -- something I couldn't stand as a child (along with duck and sausage). It may not look like much, but it saves all it's power for the flavor. And flavor packed it is.  I've never been a big fan of beans outside of chile con carne, but the Soup Peddler's cassoulet is amazing.With the duck and the sausage, it's incredibly flavorful and satisfying.  We're talking lick the bowl good.   \\n\\nAnd the their other meals aren't exactly lacking, either. I may be an omnivore but I've never been enthusiastic about all veggie soups, but the Soup Peddler has made me a convert. I even like their lentil soup. And their Fassolatha, a greek bean soup is amazing.  The only soup I've tried so far I didn't love was the brocolli and cheese and that may have been more because of the way cedar fever can wreak havoc with taste buds than the food itself. \\n\\nThe only downsides I've seen is the insistence on a cooler with ice or cooler packs inside for the home delivery (which is free). I work from home so a simple knock on the door would save on ice.  And to find the daily menu for the south austin kiosk you have to look at the @juiceboxaustin's twitter feed, not @souppeddler, which seems anti-intiuitive.  But when you're food's that good, it's easy to overlook. And if you really want a soup at the kiosk, get there early."},{"name":"Gin Thai Brasserie","address":"3176 NW 185th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Delicious!!

Horrid.  \\n\\nI returned the hummus/tabouli and ate the garlic bread from the spinach dip, yep, THAT BAD.\\n\\nOn a side note.. the waiter replacing sugar?

The Johnnycake appetizer was amazing (I literally dream about it) and the Scallop entire with brussel sprouts, blue cheese and pork was a combination that I had never seen before and really loved.

I ordered the fried rice with tofu, since I didn't feel like having breakfast, and/or mexican style food, I asked her if the tofu was firm, she said \\"well just like any tofu, if it's cooked it wont be that hard\\"  WRONG, if you know nothing about your food, just save the excuse and bad explanation for someone else.  I ordered it anyway, and it was disgusting, the rice was super mushy, and the entire entree was \\"wet\\" with a musky smell that didn't even let me have a second bite.  It tasted like moldy clothes.  I would never normally return my dish, even if I didn't like it, but this was just impossible to eat.  I told her to give me the veggie burger instead.  It was \\"decent\\" at that point anything would taste better than what I had just tasted on that rice. \\n\\nSo, you get my point, this place isn't any better than your normal diner, and has poor service, the type of service that would make you say to the waitress, really, how hard can it be to earn a good tip by being nice to your customers! \\n\\nThats my review, Austin has a lot of good places, awesome food, and lots of things to do, just avoid this place if you can."},{"name":"Burger King","address":"2610 Spring Rd SE","city":"Smyrna","stars":"1.5","text":"Don't frequent Burger King often, or fast food for that matter .. but have had a great, quick burger from here.

She reawakened a distant memory of having seen their famous \\"sticky buns\\" being made on a Food Network show.  This location was within a 10 minute walk from our hotel in Copley Square so I was more than game to check it out.\\n\\nIt was a sunny morning when I went to Flour and I think it really enhanced my experience.  Flour is located at the base of a building and it has glass windows and walls on two sides allowing the light to flood in.  Inside is a seating area and a bar along the edge of the cafe with bar stool style seating.  Most of the space is taken up by the long counter where the left half is devoted to their sandwiches while the rest is for the cashiers and baked goods.  Above the counter is some lovely wood paneling and a friendly looking menu was mounted on the wall behind the counter.\\n\\nThe staff is incredibly nice and friendly.  They were super patient with me when I got curious about pile of handheld devices on the counter.  It turns out for the busy times they use these devices to take orders and if you're paying by card, they swipe you out ahead of time so all you have to do is pick up your order and you're all set!  I thought this was super cool and efficient all at the same time.\\n\\nThat morning I got to try their French Toast which is made from their bread baked in-house and it was absolutely wonderful.  Light, delicious with a great chew.  A bit of syrup on top made it perfect comfort food.  Of course I tried their sticky bun too!  Think of a Cinabon but nowhere near as killer sweet.  Instead it's just the right amount of sweetness, chewiness and crunchiness from the pecans all combined into one dessert.  It really is quite a treat!\\n\\nI also tried their \\"Fiery Hot  Chocolate\\" which is a wonderfully sweet and soothing hot chocolate mixed with some hot spices that really give it a lovely kick.  The sweet hits you first, but then the \\"fire\\" kicks in and it's awesome.\\n\\nWant to know how much I liked this place?

I've only been to Mantra once and trust me i will never go back.\\" Because my review is starting the same way: it earned negative stars and I'm never going back. \\n\\nI'll be honest, after checking out the reviews from my fellow yelpers this morning I was less than excited about going, but I figured it couldn't be that bad. So I went with my bitesboston.com card (half off!!) figuring I could only be out $6 instead of the normal $12 for the buffet, and it was a really nice day for a bike ride over to downtown crossing. I should have listened to my fellow yelpers, and hopped on my bike to go to Chacarerro or Sam Lagrassa's or any of the other fantastic lunch places in my old Financial District stomping grounds.\\n\\nOK, now on to the actual review. I had high hopes once I got into the restaurant, it looked very nice, with cool decor, table cloths and nice table settings. The host greeted me and seemed very surprised that someone came into the restaurant alone, which I found strange since half of the tables were solo diners and the other half were large groups. I waited for a minute in that awkward buffet first moment, wondering whether I need to be greeted by a waiter or just go get food. I decided on the food, since I was hungry, so I got a veggie samosa, chick pea salad, Baingan Bartha, Mattar Paneer, and Chicken Tikka Masala. The only thing that had any flavor whatsoever was the Tikka Masala, but it was super creamy and there was no chicken in the dish when I went up for seconds. The food just had no flavor, which is ridiculous for an Indian restaurant in this area and at that price point. \\n\\nNow on to the service. I was there for a buffet so I don't expect much. And I didn't receive much either. I got a glass of water about 5 minutes after I started eating, and a basket of naan about 10 minutes after that. When I was done eating, it took about 5 more minutes to find a waiter to even call over to ask for a check. Having been thoroughly disappointed in every facet of my lunch, I was relieved that at least it would be a single-digit cost. But alas, that was not to be. The entire restaurant had not heard of bitesboston.com (not surprising since that's the second time I've tried to use my membership and the second time I've been denied by the restaurant). After the manager checked twice with the marketing department who wasn't at work apparently, he offered me a discount the next time I came in. I politely declined telling him there was no way I'd be back, not even for a free meal. Instead of trying to convince me otherwise, he acted offended and pointed around to the other people eating as proof that their food is good, to which I lauged.\\n\\nI paid my $15, and walked out, taking one last look at the restaurant I will surely never be in again."},{"name":"FoMu","address":"481 Cambridge St","city":"Allston","stars":"4.5","text":"This place has become a weekly treat after band practice.

We sat on the patio, which was amazing. The raw scallop remains one of my favorite things on their menu. \\n\\nToday, however, I went there for lunch for the first time, and was super excited to try the lobster roll. I love lobster rolls, but I could not eat this at all! I'm pretty sure many chunks of lobster were raw or extremely under-cooked - they just tasted off. The other seasonings and bread were pretty good. I left giant chunks of lobster on my plate and ate the bread, because I was so hungry! I didn't want to say anything then because I was with people, but looking back, I probably should have. Also, the servers could have asked, seeing as how the lobster roll was praised, and I clearly didn't eat much of it. We also had the campanelle and tomato salad, which were good, but not memorable.

Garridos allows you to call ahead and put your name down. This gets a +1 star from me. There is a small waiting area, but you can wait at the less crowded restaurants nearby. \\n\\n The decor is hip and modern and open so it can get pretty loud. I would not call this a romantic kinda place, but rather a great gathering place with friends before a night out downtown. The tables and chairs are comfortable and the drink menu is long. Don't let the cuisine give you the impression that it's a mom and pop Tex Mex kind of place where you can eat on the cheap. They call themselves modern Mexican cuisine. The prices, in my opinion, are consistent and expected for a hip restaurant in downtown. The Mexican margarita was a litte sweet, but very good. My drink of choice is the cucumber and kiwi martini with Hendricks gin--they offer Hendricks gin martini! +1star. \\n\\nAnything can be ordered a la carte. The tacos are a bit pricey $5/ea, but let me say they are the best tasting tacos! I had the snapper, oysters, and shrimp. Each was different, very good, and of very high quality. I also had the beef and shrimp chile relleno---delicious! The flavors were nice and nothing was overly salty.\\n\\nThe service was OK. They were really busy.

Is it the best in the world?  No, but definitely top tier, easily.  They have a LOT of selections.  We went for two of their special styles:  Audrey II with prosciutto, arugula, and balsamic drizzle and we got a Dumbledore:  also with prosciutto (we're prosciutto lovers, if you didn't notice) and burrata.  On the Dumbledore we substituted walnut pesto as a sauce base over Alfredo (which we like but didn't want TOO cheesy).  There were more toppings on the pizzas than what I mentioned here, but these are the items that stood out to us, and boy were they tasty.  We both enjoyed them.  Audrey II was decidedly the favorite for each of us, but we didn't have trouble polishing off the Dumbledore either, that's for sure.  It might be worth noting we altered the Dumbledore and maybe that's why it wasn't quite as stellar.  Next time I may just trust the chef, completely, on our choices.  Still, I'm so glad we had the option to make modifications as we chose!  They had an extensive and eclectic beer list so hubby was happy.  I got a local gluten free ginger beer, always eager to support local stuff.  They even have a cider from right at home in Salem, so I'm going to try that next time.  Our server was speedy and reasonably attentive and warmed up quickly enough to us.  I wish I got her name, we'd be happy to have her again!  Down to Earth and accommodating but not a helicopter server or trying to push us out the door.  Nice balance.  We polished off two pizzas and had three or four drinks between us and I think it came to about $50 with tip.  That is beyond reasonable for two for dinner in our area!  Quality, taste, service, speed, and value is all there.  Funky surroundings too.  We enjoyed looking at the hovering space craft.  Definitely a place worth checking out.  If you're gluten free and in the area and in the mood for pizza, I'd go.  It is head and shoulders above your everyday gluten free pizza experience, that's for sure.

While there I discovered the deliciousness that is the Italian Beef.  There's just something about that darn sandwich that is, well, magical!  Seriously, I often daydream about an Italian Beef from Portillo's (a famous Chicago chain).  You can find them here in O-town, but from my experience, they don't compare to what you get in the Windy City.  Any-who, I was excited when I heard about Chi Phi.  It's a pretty cool concept - they offer well known grub from both Chicago and Philadelphia.  And they have, you guessed it, the Italian Beef!\\n\\nHubby and I went on a Friday around 4.  It's small, but cute on the inside.  You order at the counter, take a number to your table, and they bring the food out to you when it's ready.  They don't serve alcohol, but the place is connected to a bar (The Basement), so you can grab a beer from there and bring it over if you choose.  For food we of course had to get an Italian Beef - dry w/ gravy on the side, hot giardiniera and cheese.  We also got the Roast Pork sandwich and seasoned fries w/ cheese sauce.  Aside from my obvious excitement regarding the Italian Beef, I was also looking forward to trying the Roast Pork sandwich from Philly.  I had seen this on Food Network before, and it looked delicious - Roast Pork and provolone cheese topped w/ spicy Broccoli Rabe.  When the food came out, I noticed neither of the sandwiches had cheese on them.  Kinda weird, but not a big deal.  We let the guy who brought our food know, and he apologized and took them back.  He added cheese to them and returned.  Unfortunately the cheese was not melted or even warm, so that was a bit of a bummer.  The Italian Beef was pretty good.  Was it as good as one from Portillo's?  No, but I have yet to find one that is.  The bread was lack luster and the giardiniera had green olives in it, which through me off.  But it definitely satisfied my Italian Beef craving.  The Roast Pork sandwich was okay, but nothing amazing - the Italian Beef outshined it.  Hubby and I both really enjoyed the fries w/ cheese sauce.\\n\\nOverall I thought Chi Phi was pretty good.

The Grand Marnier French Toast sounded pretty amazing.  It is made with challah which is the only way to make a true french toast.  It is also topped with marionberry sauce and served with real maple syrup.  Probably one of the better french toasts I have had in this town.\\n\\nService came with some sarcasm which I appreciate.

I was hoping the reviews were wrong -- unfortunately they were not. It was expensive, the service was horrible, the food was barely edible. \\nFirst the vibe: you come in off the street and the sign in the front of the building is advertising two restaurants ... you have to stop, look around, notice that one sign goes one way and the FOB somewhere else. But when you look to the left, all you see is a bar and no area to enter ... hardly. It is like stepping into a neighborhood bar where no one knows your name, and you are not sure if you are in the right place or not. Once through the door, you do see a wait stand, but there was no one there ... we walked up and waited for a few minutes, and were finally seated. \\nSecond the salad bar: it is small, and not much on it. It is advertised as hot and cold, but really I did not see anything hot on it. The salad was a couple bowls of ... I got a crab salad, was fake crab meat and tasted funky ... and a shrimp salad, but I saw no shrimps in it at all ... maybe it was mislabeled, not sure. \\nThird the meat: this is why you come to these places. Really, most of the time, I come to these places, I have eaten too much from the salad bar with the cheeses, and heart of palm, salmon and all of that that I do not have room for much meat ... in this case, that did not happen. The first meat was chewy like a piece of rubber and had about as much flavor. The next meat was nearly raw ... it literally was dripping blood all over my plate as the server cut it off. The third meat was a chicken wrapped with bacon ... normally this is chicken breast meat ... in this case it was like the top of a chicken wing, wrapped counter clockwise with raw bacon ... if I had not cut into it, I would not have noticed it had a great big chicken bone in the middle. Then they disappeared ... for a long time. Our glasses (we drank water) were only filled once all night, and with great difficulty in finding someone to do that. \\nThey came around again ... the smoked turkey was good ... really good. My friend had declined, and after eating it we told him it was awesome. We flagged someone down and requested more of the turkey ... it never came. No one came. Eventually we got someone to bring the check, she literally stood until we gave her our credit cards, then she went away came back and watched us fill out the slips ... like she was inspecting to see what kind of tip she would get. So ... the reviews are accurate. There are much better places to eat in the same block ... don't waste your time and money here."},{"name":"Havana Kiss Cuban Cafe & Restaurant","address":"5726 W Irlo Bronson Memorial Hwy","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"3","text":"We had a variety of meals!

When we sat down at the bar it was still filthy from the person before; there were dirty plates and drink glasses with used napkins on the table. It took a long time before anyone even noticed that we sat down and it took me raising my hand and waving someone over to get a menu. However, before we could even order he was off. So there we were 20 minutes later, with a dirty counter and menus that were tossed at us. We hoped that this was just a fluke and the night would get better, but it only got worse....\\n\\nAfter waiting for what seemed like forever, we were finally able to put in our drink and food order. The food was outrageously priced for what it was. The portions were small and the food came out cold. Nothing seemed to be prepared fresh.

I can hardly believe I've been the only one unlucky enough to have a bad food experience here.\\n\\nWe booked in Bondir with one week advance. It is small and demand is high, till here everything fine. \\n\\nThe place is cozy, romantic, service is friendly and attentive. My experience with the food unfortunately is the opposite.\\n\\nWe started with a beet salad, which was ok, we took ideas to do it at home, but for the price, I expected something a bit more impressive, either for the look of it or, preferably, the taste.\\n\\nThe chicken liver mouse was plainly too salty to me. The mouse (closer to pate) dominated the plate and the small bits of sweet were not enough to contrast the taste of the pate. All in all, good intention but poorly executed.\\n\\nWe continued with the roasted littleneck clams, in this case the grease of the sausage or  the one used to cook the dish killed the flavor of the clams. The mix of flavors made no sense at all and the grease made the plate disgusting for moments.\\n\\nFinally the cassoulet sur assiette was again a failed dish, the flavors were ok (if it wasn't, again, for the salt) but everything mixed weird together. The final decision of including the lard used to cook the casserole as decoration to the dish was a bad, bad idea. Unless properly cooked grease doesn't absorb the flavor of the other components and it is disgusting to eat, at the least.\\n\\nWe commented a few of our objections to our waiter who was kind enough to offer us a chocolate semifredo, which was ok.\\n\\nThe dessert was cheese (after the dinner we didn't want to risk with something more complex) and the pear crostata, which was ok, but not brilliant as you would expect in a restaurant claiming to be among the best in Cambridge.\\n\\nWine and liquor list is good although I miss something stronger than the port for the dessert.\\n\\nMy conclusion is food too elaborated with little attention to the mix in the dishes. Probably good components that didn't add together in the plate. Each ingredient was ok, but all together in the plate were less than the individual parts.\\n\\nOur sentence for choosing Bondir was two upset tummys and little sleep that night."},{"name":"The Barrelhouse","address":"22 5th St N W, Ste B","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"So I went to The Barrelhouse this weekend for a networking event.

The food is always consistent, the scallops are my favorite in town, and they have one of the most beautiful patios in the city. But, this experience went above and beyond.\\n\\nNow, I expect any restaurant to be happy to help when you say you want to propose to your girlfriend there, but Barcelona's management really did exceed my expectations.\\n\\nHere is how it happened: I called and told the hostess about a week ahead of time that I was going to have some very special requests. She told me to go for it and she would take notes. After making all of them I was told that she would have to have her manager call me back because she couldn't approve all of them. No problem.\\n\\nNext day, after some phone tag, I get back with the manager. He is happy to help me with my requests which were: a patio table (they don't do requests for the patio, ever), prosecco to be brought out immediately after the proposal, flowers to be kept in their fridge that I dropped off then brought out with the prosecco, and, here was the odd one, they agreed to hand out notes that I prepared which told the other patio tables what was going on and asked them to take photos with their camera phones and send them to her number. \\n\\nThe requests were only a small part of the success of the evening. The real expertise showed that night. Not only did they save us a patio table, but they saved us THE patio table. Smack dab in the middle. The server we had was fantastic, never giving it away with even an eyebrow. The flowers and prosecco went flawlessly. It was even fun when I went inside to use the restroom and the manager is buzzing about when I was going to do it. The comic relief was much needed. The best part though was that not only did they hand out notes, but they shared more details about our night to other guests. One table bought us our prosecco, one woman brought her a handkerchief, and ever last table, at the moment, at our moment was completely focused on her, on the proposal, on us. The energy from the other tables was so tremendous that it is hard to describe.\\n\\nThe topper from management was that the manager who set it up with me stayed late so that he could take photos too with his iPad. He had told me earlier in the week he was going home at 4:30 but he was there till we left nearly 3 hours later. \\n\\nI want to believe that other restaurants would have been as willing to help and pulled it off flawlessly but I do have to wonder. Barcelona's rare combination of management and food excellence is second to none and I would, with as high of a recommendation as I can give, encourage you to patronize them with your business. After the night they delivered to both myself and, especially, my new fiance, they deserve nothing but good things going forward.\\n\\nThank you Barcelona, for a night worth remembering."},{"name":"Tommy Want Wingy","address":"94 Rainey St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Love this place!

I went with a friend on a Monday night, arrived around 6 p.m., and was told there would be an hour wait. Not a problem as we expected this, and I appreciated that they called when seats were ready so we could walk around the North End.\\n\\nWe sat at the bar, and I ordered the clam chowder and a hot lobster roll. The clam chowder was delicious and unique - lots of very fresh, yummy clams. I love clam chowder and you just don't see that many fresh clams in a bowl too often. Unfortunately, when I neared the bottom of the bowl, I found a piece of a shell - about an inch and half wide and sharp! This could have been really dangerous if I swallowed it. I hoped this was just a fluke and went in for another spoonful and found even more tiny pieces of clam shells. I told the waiter and appreciated that they took the chowder off the bill.\\n\\nWhen the lobster roll arrived, I was excited but it was soooo rich that I found it to be difficult to eat. Don't get me wrong - the roll was packed with lobster which was great but with all the butter loaded on there, it was hard to eat too much without feeling stuffed - and a little sick - to my stomach. Granted, I do normally order cold lobster rolls so maybe that's more what I'm used to but after hearing the rave reviews of the warm ones, I wanted to give them a try. As some other reviewers mentioned, the fries were excellent. Very crispy and delicious.\\n\\nOverall, Neptune Oyster was good - despite the shell incident - but not worth the wait on this particular night.

The downside is that this place gets PACKED and it fills up early. If you plan on doing dinner, obviously get some reservations. We usually just drop in and try to find a spot in the bar which is really hit or miss. Last weekend we got extremely lucky and right after we walked in happened upon a table next to the window that was being vacated.\\n\\nThe appetizers were fast and tasty and I was surprised at how quick the service was since it was standing room only.

I enjoy dipping the bread in the yummy shrimp broth much more with a little crunch to it. If you ask them to toast the bread, this results in slightly warm soft bread.

The same can be said regarding the drinks (and dessert and my date's entree, yes he permitted himself to order food of actual substance): average, and I would have had to have many more of them in order to get over the Tarzan dresses and the general vibe of this place, nevermind my psychotic date. \\n\\nNow, I weigh under 100 pounds and am 5'4\\"--it's not like I'm dieting.

I really like mochas and the option of real chocolate is something I appreciate.\\n\\nIn past months following the Olympics the service here was sometimes poor in terms of how well a couple of the staff would handle my orders to get food grilled and my drink prepared while needing to greet the next customer in line. A good attitude has never been a problem, it was the teamwork and prioritization which would result in having to wait a while on my order. On recent visits I'm happy to say my experiences have really improved on a consistent basis. I've been seeing some new staff and this location has become much more organized in taking your order and seeing it through while remaining very friendly.\\n\\nThe location is quite spacious as it is a very looong room, with tabled seating to the left of the bar and a greater assortment of seats to the right which also features a large (usually silent) television in the wall. There is also a long row of bar stools at the windows and a couple of nice looking meeting rooms at the far end.\\n\\nI've only been here during the afternoons or early evenings and it's usually not very crowded, the mood is relaxed and quiet. The sandwiches are good though pricey for what they are. It's common for coffee chains to charge a lot for sandwiches and I feel Waves takes advantage of that. If the sandwiches ever went from good to amazing I'd give them another star. I do like how you can get half sized orders and this location appears to often have a soup and sandwich deal which they advertise on the windows or the sign outside."},{"name":"Little Bird Bistro","address":"215 SW 6th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Happy hour menu is awesome here.

They were great.  Not too spicy, nice thin cut fries, crisp and delicious.  Finally we shared a tomato dish - it was all veggie.

We walked by this restaurant which was located where a restaurant we used to love had  been and decided to go in.  It was early so the place wasn't packed. We were seated and given a very short time to select from a rather lengthy menu.  My husband ordered the singapore noodles and I ordered the Beef Chow Fun.  I saw they had a bar with beer and wine,  which is not indicated anywhere on the menu.  We had to ask the server if they had a liquor license and she seemed quite put out that we did.  After some questioning,  she finally identified what they had to drink.  I ordered the Pinot Grigio and my Husband had a Tsing Tao.  The wine was surprisingly good.  The restaurant filled in and everyone around us was ordering and getting their food, while we waited.  After finishing our first drinks, (and we are not big drinkers) and still no food,  we ordered another round.  Finally the Singapore noodles arrived and they explained they had given my Husband's order to another table.  The Singapore noodles were mediocre at best.  Still no Beef Chow Fun.  My Husband finished his  Singapore noodles,  still no Chow Fun.  Finally my husband got the attention of the Host and asked where my meal was.  After we got him involved,  about 10-15 minutes later the Chow Fun finally  arrived.  I wish i had had more time to enjoy them because the Chow Fun was really good.

Living within a mile of Atlantic Station I have been eager to actually find a place that serves good food inside Atlantic Station but that has yet to happen. I kind of ignored some negative reviews I read on Yelp and we ventured to Rosa Mexicano anyway. \\n\\nSo our dining experience started off around a 5 star rating and then everything went horribly wrong. I ordered a side of plantains and they were terrific. Then I ordered some strange chicken enchilada item that had some stupid name that no one could ever pronounce and didn't even seem very Mexican but who am I to say being I was in Monterrey, Mexicolast month but hey, I am pumped on the dish before it comes so far. \\nI get it and it tastes like some strange lemon chicken thing that is far from perfect. So I bail on my dinner plate and move towards the tortilla's which are DISGUSTING. How do you call yourself a Mexican place with bad tortilla's, bad beans, AND bad rice. I think we are still okay and they have salvaged around 2 stars at this point until I have a conversation with our waitress. \\n\\nSo I kindly ask her where the bathroom is and she cannot tell me in an around the corner fashion. She is like well it's behind the flying man waterfall blah blah but be careful because their are pictures on the door and the girl one is a woman but she kinda looks like a man so it could be confusing. Just when your walking straight make sure you walk into the door to the left. So I am feeling pretty intimidated here waiting to experience the horrible feeling of walking into the women's bathroom but it never happened. For starters they have letters on the door that are M and W but clearly letter recognition was a little over my head? And the female picture is the famous Frida Kahlo, like come on!? All in all the food sucked but it wasn't the worst stuff I have ever had. Where they manage to lose the last star was this stupid experience cost $64 (for 2 people)!

I placed my order, then went to the end of the food prep counter to wait. While I was waiting - WAY longer than I should have had to wait - I started noticing that every ceiling light and decorative buoy was covered in thick, chunky dust. The light over the cash register was particularly bad. There was also thick, chunky dust hanging off the fluorescent light immediately over the grill where the buns were toasted - where it could fall on the food. I also noted a lot of dust on the counter in front of the napkin dispenser, most likely from the napkins themselves. \\n\\nAfter an eternity (during which the person who came in after me already got their order and left and all of the kitchen staff took their sweet time socializing instead of making my food) one guy came out and handed me my bag with my lobster roll inside.

But I was so grossed out by the dust and tired of waiting I just took it and left \\n\\nWhen I got back to my room (which is in a hotel right next to Luke's) and ate the lobster roll the lobster was dry and the bun was cold.

My second surprise was that I couldn't taste any hint of tea in my drink- it was more like a green tea-flavored milk shake!  I can see how this would be a perfectly fine drink, it just wasn't what I was expecting.  In CA, boba tea is tea + flavor + cream + soft black tapioca pearls, but at this shop it was flavored powder + friendly's vanilla ice cream + rainbow colored tapioca balls.  Also surprised by how expensive it was: my kid size drink (smallest size available) was $2.78 total, but I'm glad I didn't order a larger size.

Awesome Happy Hour (this is truly the only reason to go here).  Clean outdoor bathrooms.\\n\\nCons: Poor Design.

On multiple occasions I have had to wait more than 10 minutes for beer because they were swamped inside.  I have even seen them go as far as bring out pitcher and free bottles of beer to satisfy long delays.  If you have pitchers why not offer them regularly on the menu to cut down on all of the running of pints from inside?  \\n\\nSecond their TV placement did not take into account the table configuration as their are numerous tables that have terrible views of a TV.  Also they have a projector screen on the long side of the patio by the bathrooms but they went cheap so the Projector quality is low and they did not buy an anti-glare screen so you cannot see it at all unless it is completely dark outside.

Five minutes into our dinning experience a server spilled an entire tray of beer and other alcoholic beverages on me and across our table. I was wearing a brand new jacket purchased only hours before coming to the restaurant, which was water repellant and repelled the drinks spilt on the out side of it. However, the inside lining of the jacket was soaked with beer, as was the rest of my clothes and shoes.  The server handed me a wet rag to dry my self off with after cleaning the floor with it, and said it was a good thing my jacket was water repellent. No, one apologized for anything, and they charged extra for replacing the drink the server knocked over with the tray of drinks spilt on me! I was speechless, enraged, soaking wet, and smelt like beer as I left the restaurant and no one was concerned. My friends with me felt terrible for recommending the establishment and said something to an employee as we left. To say I am disappointed in my dinning experience would be an understatement, and my jacket is destroyed and still smells like beer after washing it. Unbelievable...

I had hear such magical things about the soup and I loved the story. However, of the things I have tried, my impression has been luke warm. Minus 4 stars for a company named Soup Peddler having such mediocre soups.\\n\\nThe Bad:\\n- Broccoli Cheese - This was by far the worst. I think we ended up with the dishwater that was used to wash out their pots that had once contained Broccoli Cheese soup. The soup was the consistency of water. Cheese flavored water. Cheese flavored water with the tiniest bits of broccoli. I don't think this soup should have been called Broccoli Cheese as it seemed to lack both.\\n- Tomato Basil - It was ok.\\n- Chicken Green Chili Stew - Fairly good. \\n- Greek Lemon Chicken - I was disappointed in this one. I'm used to the very lemony version from a greek restaurant in town. This version lacked the full flavor profile that I'm used to Lemon Chicken packing.\\n\\nOn a whim, I ordered the hummus. Here again, I'm not sure if there are some quality control issues resulting from growing pains, or what. The hummus was chunky and gritty and kinda goopy. I'm used to a much smoother consistency. One of my daughter's first foods was hummus. She is now 4 and has eaten her weight in hummus over the years, and she rejected this hummus after one taste. \\n\\nThe good:\\nI've been pleasantly surprised with their entrees- plus 1 star. The apple stuffed chicken breasts were moist and tender. The stuffing was flavorful and we couldn't get enough of these. They were quickly devoured. The chicken parmesan was lovely. Again, the chicken was well seasoned and tasty. The marinara was bright and flavorful. I enjoyed the Pastitsio, but my husband found the flavors bordering on too sweet and too much cinnamon. The portions are a good size and are ample enough to feed 2 adults and a 4 year old.\\n\\nI think I'll continue to order until my gift certificate is depleted, but I'm not sure if I'll order again after that."},{"name":"Cork & Fork","address":"5180 S Conway Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Went last night for my Friends birthday dinner.

Breakfast and lunch are busy and a lot of people like to get togo orders.  2 waitresses cannot check out people, take togo orders, put the orders together, take care of over 25 tables and bus the tables in a timely fashion.

It may have been loud, but I still thought the live music was a nice touch.\\n\\nThere are quite a few options on the menu that I'd like to try, but when I saw the Roast Beef Po' Boy, I had to have it. I fell in love with them in N.O. two visits back for a reason that defies any logical explanation.\\n\\nIt was a great (and HUGE) sandwich [see photo] that was probably one of the messiest sandwiches I've ever had.  They got that part right!  It was missing something to make it perfect, but it was pretty close to what I remember.  I ordered it with a side of sweet potato fries, which I could hardly touch after the sandwich, I was so full.\\n\\nGood experience overall.  I'll be back to try something a little more \\"classic\\" New Orleans."},{"name":"Everybody's Pizza","address":"1040 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"I can't believe that I haven't already reviewed Everybody's!!

They have Strongbow on tap. They are super-happy to make your order to go and graciously let you know that it's ready whenever you are - no hurry, stay if you want, or if you're rushed we're ready . . . that kind of attitude. My mixed field greens plus goat cheese (with the Everybody's garlic ranch and vinaigrette on the side, so I could mix them) was perfect.

I give my waitress credit, after waiting on the bartenders (the place was nearly empty) for a long time, she finally went behind the bar and made my drink. I ordered bourbon on the rocks and one bartender was too busy dancing to make it. It's a curse to sit close enough to an otherwise empty bar, to see that it took ten minutes to pour an ounce of bourbon over some ice.

The belly dancers are very talented and invite your participation. You can also pay to have a Hookah Pipe at your table and that is a very unique experience as well if you have never experienced one.

However, after my experiences today I will no longer be eating there. This past week I ordered a vegetarian pizza, and bit into a piece of sausage. I was not too upset with this because with the toppings that close together in the prep stations, sometimes this happens. They were very nice and offered to make me another pizza for no charge, and gave me a voucher for a free small pizza (up to $10). Today, I cashed in my free small pizza, although it came out to closer to $14 because I added the cost of a gluten-free crust (I'm celiac). I was anticipating having to pay a few extra dollars to make up the difference, but the same person was working today as was working the day I received the sausage pizza, so they said the difference was on them. This was super nice of them, and I felt like they really cared about me and my experience there. \\n\\nHowever, at 10pm tonight (I ordered the pizza around 3pm) the general manager called and left a message on my cell phone saying that the order had never been closed out, inquiring as to how i paid for the pizza. On my end, it felt as though he was insinuating that I had not paid for my pizza. Although I respect the fact that he needed to complete his checklist for the night, and make sure the money they received matched what they sold for the day, this question of my order seems to me like it should have been directed at the staff working that day who had been there when I placed and picked up the order. If the staff for whatever reason did not have the answer to this, then it would be more professional to have contacted me first thing in the morning. It is never acceptable to contact a customer at 10pm at night. Especially since I had made and picked up my order so much earlier in the day. An email would have also sufficed. However, calling customers that late at night is unacceptable and wholly unprofessional.

Your time and choices are constricted. There are a handful of barbecue joints that I can make it to within reason. Vic's BBQ is the closest one. The first and only time I ate there was right after I started working for Progressive Insurance. I remember it being decent, but some of my co-workers swear by it.\\n\\nWhen I got there, the parking lost was packed. Every time I drive by it, it looks packed. Is that supposed to be a good sign? Inside there were people but not as many that the parking lot would indicate. The atmosphere had a working class feel to it. Everyone in there seems like they were on their lunch break between jobsites. I ordered the three meat plate with the usual meats of moist brisket, pork ribs, and sausage. I got coleslaw and potato salad on the side. The brisket was surprisingly decent. It was very tender, and the smoke ring and flavor were superb. I did not need any barbecue sauce for it. The pork rib was tender but not falling off the bone. The rub and smoke gave it nice flavor. The sausage was probably one of the better commercial sausages I have ever had. It had the just right amount of fat. The casing and grit of the sausage was on point. The coleslaw and potato were bland. Nothing special to write about.\\n\\nIt is a solid barbecue restaurant. It is definitely worth a visit. It is relatively cheap, and they are pretty quick in getting you in and out. Vic's is barbecue for the everyday working man.

When I rounded the corner at the Food Truck Bazaar and saw the Portuguese flag on the Bem Bom truck it was like I already knew I was home.  \\n\\nI ordered a favorite of mine, Chouri√ßo, which I was told was meant to be sort of an appetizer, but my mouth was watering for a taste of something familiar from home.

The Chouri√ßo comes with sauce is very spicy, just the way it should be.  It is absolutely authentic, and delicious.  The Pineapple Salsa is incredible!  I couldn't get over the way the sweetness and acidity of the pineapple cut through the heat of the Chouri√ßo and that sauce.\\n\\nThe other thing that is really great about the Bem Bom truck is the way they handle the ordering and payment.

Hostess said there was a 20 minute wait and that she would call me when a seat was available. Didn't have to wait 10 minutes before I got a call back, so that was a good start. I overheard that the wait was about an hour for a party of 4 at that point.\\n\\nOrdered three oysters of varying sizes, origins, and tastes to have some variety. They run about $2-3/oyster and all were nice and fresh. I definitely could've eaten a couple more but wanted to save my appetite. BTW, the triton plateau looked tremendous.\\n\\nNow the clam chowder. I LOVED. Probably my favorite part of the meal. I like my chowder not too heavy and this delivered. Fresh and flavorful with clams you can actually taste. I only wish the bowl were bigger.\\n\\nAnd then the Maine lobster roll. Nice, large chunks of lobster meat on a buttered roll with a large heap of fries. It was good but a little too buttery for my taste. Compared to a $15 lobster roll I have had from the Red Hook Lobster Pound, I felt that while you definitely get more bang for your buck the quality was just slightly higher. And the fries were sadly burnt. Maybe if they take that off the order it would be $5 cheaper and then you can leave your stomach room for more oysters...\\n\\nService? Ehh. I know I was alone, but the bartender/waitress couldn't really be bothered. I had to wait for her to finish her \\"line\\" of customers after attempting to order and then saw my order for oysters sitting in front of me for a good five minutes before she delivered it to me. Also the people next to me who ordered after me got some of their food before mine. Normally not really nitpitcky, but we ordered the same thing. So I guess I'll have to dock a star for service.\\n\\nNow I would still recommend this place if you're in Boston and looking for a one-stop shop for oysters, clam chowder, and lobster rolls.

I have been to the Fez several times and have taken a lot of friends there. Every visit to this restaurant has been a pleasant experience; all you need to do is keep an open mind. Remember that you are going to have a Moroccan experience; eating Moroccan food in a Moroccan setting. In most other cultures outside ours in the US, the server will only come to your table to bring the menu, take your order, bring out the courses and then bring out the check. If you need something at other times, you need to get their attention and ask them to come over. So, if you want the standard American service with the server coming over to you every couple of minutes to ask you how you're doing or how you are liking your food, then please do yourself a favor and go to Applebees or something more mundane. If you do decide to try something different and pleasing to the palate, go for the delicious cornish hen appetizer and beef sheesh kebabs at the Imeprial Fez. Oh, and the whole idea of this place is a leisurely experience; so make sure you have a full evening (at least 3-4 hours) to enjoy all that the Fez has to offer. If you're in a hurry and want the courses and the check to be brought out in quick succession and the server hovering over your head, as some other reviewers seem to need, then don't go to the Fez."},{"name":"Flour Bakery + Caf√©","address":"131 Clarendon St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Great breakfast sandwiches & coffee / espresso.

The entire menu looked delicious but I was set on getting BNG. \\n\\nI decided to \\"make my own\\"; 1 biscuit with 3 whole eggs with the shiitake mushroom gravy and a cup of coffee. The total was $10 which seemed incredibly cheap. Seating is self seating, so long as you can find a table, and I did. 940AM didn't have the place to crowded. \\n\\nWe waited about 10 minutes before our order was ready and aesthetically it was very lackluster and missing the gravy. I waited for another sever to come by but none did as it seemed they were all busy. I decided to go up to the counter and ask for a cup of the mushroom gravy to which the young lady told me it would be $4.00. That seemed a bit pricey for gravy. \\n\\nI informed her that I ordered it with my plate but it didn't come with it. \\"Ok\\", she said, \\"what was your number?\\" I responded with 97. \\"Can I get a large mushroom gravy, please\\" she asked one of the cooks as she dug out the order number from the trash. \\n\\n\\"Here's your number but there's no gravy on it\\" I didn't really know how to respond other than saying that I had ordered it.

I thanks I said and went back to my table to taste my order. \\n\\nI thought it was really odd that they still wanted to charge me for a mistake on their part as opposed comping it or offering me a smaller portion. I didn't need much gravy, just enough to try it. \\n\\nSo, with all that said, the biscuit was just OK. Since it has been sitting for about 5 minutes it had gotten cold with the brisk Oregon air. It was also slightly, very very slightly doughy which I do like but only when the biscuit has a crisp outer layer. \\n\\nI cannot recommend this place for BNG as I only received a biscuit and from that alone I probably wouldn't order it again.

The bowl I got was everything you want for colder weather: warm, comforting, and full of spices. They forgot the cilantro in mine, so my bowl was more sweet and less green. But again: free. And I applaud any company that puts in such a large investment in their staff's training and their customers' satisfaction.\\n\\nI returned a few months later as a regular, paying customer, and you can tell all of that training paid off! The staff (some who I recognized from that first meal) seem very comfortable in all the menu items and can even whip up customized orders in a flash. They also go out of their way to be friendly and ask you how your day's going. This time, I ordered the Spicy Sabzi, which is my far-away fave from their regular menu. It's crunchy and leafy and quinoa-y. The broccoli and tofu are flavorful. And that house made hot sauce is otherworldly. I just want a big tub of it to take home. This is the food I crave after I work out (let's be real - I'm thinking about it during the workout); there's nothing more satisfying that sticking your face in a big bowl of salad after a sweat sesh. And feeling great about it afterward. The dark greens are nutrient-rich, so you feel full and powerful for hours.\\n\\nSweetgreen seems very Harvard Square to me. Now that the staff is well-trained and the salads/bowls are just as great as the other locations, I can see them thriving here.

Do make sure you also get a Thai Tea with it though, as it both goes well with it in terms of flavor and to help with the spiciness which builds up over time. It is essentially flavored ground pork with cucumbers, cilantro, basil, mint, and sticky rice on the side, with juice sitting below and around it all. I personally like cutting up all the herbs and mixing the sticky rice all together to absorb the sauciness at the bottom. This is a pretty sizable entree too, so it can easily be shared if you're also having an appetizer and/or dessert.\\n\\nIf you're not able to handle super spicy food, you can get the spiced down version, or the Pad Kapow which can also be spiced down, but even normal is less spicy than the Larb Moo."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"I have no idea why this place get so popular on yelp.

For one, she never gave us her name (only found it from my to go dessert receipt). And I am gonna go ahead and list the main things that really made our experience subpar, aside from all the other wonderful attributes of Tibby's -- I'll get to that later on.  \\n1. The server had the worst attitude. I don't know if she was having a bad day, but I'm sorry suck it up and be professional.\\n2. I asked her for a menu because we forgot what one of the ingredients was in the Boutin Grits. I think she literally rolled her eyes and brought a menu over. \\n\\n3. I asked her what sauces you guys had, and she said Mayo and Ketchup phrased as a question. Any good server would be proud or at least be knowledgeable about the New Orleans and Cajun cuisine she is serving to customers.  Since I'm not well versed in Cajun foods, I expected her to at least mention Remoulade sauce!! She made me so uncomfortable about asking about sauce I said forget it.\\n\\n4. We wanted dessert.  I asked her what was in the bread pudding, and her response, no lie was \\"It has raisins and bread.\\" I chuckled and said milk and sugar, like coaxing for a more detailed response.  It was comical at this point.  \\n5. So, we ordered the bread, raisins, milk and sugar to go.  She brought the check, we paid, and she walks back to the table and asks if we are done with \\"that\\" referencing the check and walks off not even saying thank you, or I'll be right back with your dessert guys...anything...\\n\\nI will refrain from using her name, but she disappeared. Never to be seen again! We waited for over 15 minutes, and I had to walk to the back of the restaurant to ask the busy staff in the kitchen window pulling tickets where my order was because we have been waiting.\\n\\nI have been looking forward to going to Tibby's for quite a while.  In actuality, also have my friends.  After being greeted by your engaging Greeters, seated quickly by your Hostess, eating excellent food in a fun - eclectic NOLA vibe atmosphere -- we had to stomach the unprofessional, lazy, and out right rude behavior from your staff.  We did not ask for a manager, because at that point we wanted to leave. And it's also what I call the \\"bad service tunnel,\\" you sit there and take it because you think ohh it will get better and by the 3rd, 4th, 5th thing you're just done. However, I called today and no answer, so hopefully you actually read this review.  Trust me, you guys already know who I'm speaking of that worked on Wednesday night service. That girl should be fired immediately, she obviously doesn't love her job, and could care less about customer service let alone the idea of how a business is run. It's not that difficult to learn the menu, and be polite. Everything else was that good, that after telling my friends about this server, I am still recommending your establishment.  I believe in community and supporting our local economy, but it's a pet peeve of mine when I'm spending my money and not respected for doing so.

It's a bit of a red flag for me as I'm a less-is-more person.  Do a dozen things and do them well.  Anyhow, the place was spotless and the condiments were wiped clean, filled and in their designated place.  OCD me loathes sticky, cluttered, semi-filled stuff on the table.  Hubby has a serious and somewhat unusual food allergy...red onions.  All other onions, scallions, garlic and shallots are fine.  This always causes great consternation to servers and cooks because allergy precautions are a must.  Matt handled it without fanfare, though he had to make two different trips to the kitchen to read labels and check ingredients.  After thumbing through the encyclopedia, which is BJ's menu, we settled on a few lunch items.  I had the iced tea and allergy boy had the darkest beer on the list.  He LOVED it.  The tea was good and passed the muster.  Food items were the cheeseburger (cooked perfectly), both sweet and regular fries ( bravo to the greaseless regulars and thumbs down to the sweets, because they were room temperature.  Matt did not serve those so, no foul there.  We also tried the BLT salad ( would order again...lots of bacon) and the beets with goat cheese ( unusual diced presentation but tasted good).

They're open 24 hours, 365 days a a year, especially holidays. The Hillsboro location closes early and the quality isn't as great as the Javier's in Portland.

We got in line.  I saw a few Reggie Deluxe's go out.  With that, I was out on the Reggie Deluxe.  The DH stuck with the RD.   I opted for a fried chicken, ham and egg biscuit.  Yeah.  I wimped out.

I would give 3.5 stars...but Yelp does not do that.\\n\\nI was so so excited to visit this place after Yelping and seeing the number of shiny red stars. I planned my Boston itinerary so that I could visit this place at 11.30am (opening time) and not stand in line in the cold. I went at noon instead and had to wait for around 30 mins. Pro: You leave your number and they will call you, so you can explore the area and check out other foods. Just make sure to come to the restaurant when they call you saying when to go over rather than wait for them to call a second time (I don't think they will call a second time). \\n\\nWe had the oysters and clams (all from the MA area) since my bf thinks that it makes sense if we eat oysters from the area rather than those from New Orleans or somewhere further out. He loves oysters and enjoyed them a lot. They looked extremely fresh as well. \\n\\nWe then had the famous and recommended lobster roll. This was where I was disappointed. This was one of the most expensive dishes ($27). The amount of lobsters definitely justified the price , I am pretty sure there was an entire lobster meat in there...however, I wasn't crazy over the entire product. I felt that other places can easily reproduce that just by being more generous with the lobster meat and then increasing the price justifiably. An experience is worth it, but I don't think I would come here and get it again. \\n\\nLastly, we had the clam chowder ($11). This was placed in a rather shallow dish so the amount wasn't a lot. However, as usual, Neptune Oyster is generous with their seafood and there was definitely clam to be seen in the clam chowder. I usually have the San Francisco style clam chowder (think Boudin) that is more thick and creamy, while this was more ... for lack of a better word..less creamy and more soupy. In my opinion, the pepper was too strong for me. To know where it really stands, I tried some clam chowder in Quincy Market and well, I guess the clam chowder in Neptune Oyster is more legit and not buried in milk and cream, but I would still prefer if it were less overpowering. \\n\\n\\nTotal cost: $60"},{"name":"JJ's Fresh From Scratch","address":"2950 Curry Ford Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Like Chipotle?

She also delivered our water, one of which had to be sent back because the glass was obviously filthy. Then, we all had to walk to the cash register and hand our cash over to the unapologetic manager with the shifty-eyed owner skulking behind.\\n\\nMy order of lamb biryani arrived with bits of chopped lamb nestled within a mound of curried basmati rice.

Kind of awkward sitting immediately next to another two people and trying to pretend they aren't there...\\n\\nAnyway, according to my bf all the oysters were amazing. I don't care for oysters personally so I didn't try any. I stupidly ordered something I do really like which was the stone crab claws. They were the worst crab claws I've had. Very mealy and mushy, not fresh tasting at all. A total disappointment but really, I only have myself to blame. Who the hell orders Florida seafood in Boston? Me.

It's really thin though which I found odd but the menu says it's made to order so it makes sense that there isn't much time for it to get as thick. It's not sitting in a pot all day, it's made right after you order it. The flavor was amazing and the clams were nice and tender. Definitely the thing to order at this restaurant. The beef tartar was good but the anchovies on top overpowered the entire dish. Again, I ordered like an idiot. Should have gotten the fried oysters, not the beef!

Seriously, I don't know what was wrong with me that night but I guess since it was cold my brain must have been malfunctioning and I wanted the warm version with butter. Now, the lobster was delicious. The roll was packed with huge chunks of it and it was cooked nicely..but perhaps a touch over. However the warm butter made the roll very soggy and unappetizing for me. Should have stuck with the classic cold version! Ugh, what is wrong with me?

Their specialty rolls are also very pretty to look at - they even have a photo album for you to flip through and then you can look to the descriptions in the menu. Last night we ordered the Charcoal roll with spicy tuna, prawn tempura, topped with avocado and salmon which was very delicious and not spicy at all (for those of you raising your eyebrows at the spicy salmon). We also tried the Big Roller roll which had chopped scallops topped with avocado and eel, there was some tempura crunchiness that made it THAT much better.

It was accompanied by an appetizer of oyster tostadas on yucca root chips with honey habanero aioli.  I abstained from the oysters and the cute little bee abstained from me as well.

Imagine the busboy's surprise upon removing the napkin in the kitchen...\\n\\n========\\nChapter 2\\n========\\n\\nOur second course was aptly named \\"Lord of the Flies\\".

When we arrived we sat in the bar before our reservation was called. The male bartender ignored us for about 7 to 8 minutes. We then saw to the left of us a normal looking woman who kept getting drinks who was folding napkins. She said her husband worked there. She was pleasant , however I found it strange that I kept waiting for water or service and she had a glass of water , wine and was working , while not really working there. I then caught the attention of a blonde female bartender who was super busy but got me my drinks. However in this amount of time the man next to us who is a regular at the restaurant was talking to us about marriage and how you need to marry your best friend. I casually talked to him and listened to his story. He offered to move down a seat so my friend could not be right in front of the lamp when you sit at the bar. So we were officially sitting at the bar. They called our dinner reservation but we were unaware that happy hour was only in the bar, so we headed back to our seats which were still open, we asked him if he wouldn't mind moving down to that same seat again as we had to eat in the bar. He said sure and moved down. We asked for a food menu and then we see this same guy get up and go complain to a manager that we shouldn't have moved him with out asking. What the fuck! I asked you twice and you got up willingly to move. He even was getting me some kind of card that the resturant has benefits on when you spend money there. We then we're ignored again. As the lady folding the napkins was talking about how these guys are amazing and how they will take care of you and how they live on tips..I kinda laughed, as I was waiting for service.

I came in here attempting to try out one of their Belgium white mochas. I came to the cash register and after waiting for about 4 minutes, the cashier finally came out of  hiding to take my order. She was abrupt and cold, did not attempt to make any eye contact or even give me a half smile. But what I deemed as most annoying was that right in the middle of our transaction, her coworker who must've also had been in hiding, came to the cash register and said something in korean to her. Instead of telling her coworker to wait until after she's done my order to talk, she decided to have respond by having a full on korean conversation for 5 minutes in front of me, in the middle of our transaction even though I still haven't fully finished telling her what I wanted to order. I do not understand korean but either way I found it to be really rude. After she was finally done talking to her, the cashier returned to me and completely forgotten what I had told her of I wanted before so I told her again. Again, she was cold and abrupt, a strange contrast to how animated and bubbly she was speaking korean to her friend. Afterwards, she gave me the wrong change and didn't even apologize! \\nI waited 10 minutes for my drinks to be made because apparently I have to wait for the cashiers to take the orders from people behind me before my drinks can be made. I have no idea where the other korean speaking staff went so I asked the cashier, she told me she was on her break. \\nIf there is a line up behind me waiting to get their orders taken and a handful of people who's paid and are waiting for their drinks, shouldn't there be at least two people working at all times, three people with one on their break?

Lucky enough we got the last two open chairs in this small and cozy place. Customers that came right after us has to deal with a wait of almost 45 minutes. \\n\\nWe started off with some oysters and the sea urchin after going through the oyster selection slip. I was never much of an oyster fan aside from the popular Kumamoto but Neptune converted me that day. All the oysters were so fresh and flavorful thy we couldn't get enough of them. Personally I really enjoyed the high salt Wianno and Wellfleet oysters. The one negative was the way they prepared the oysters. Some of them had pieces of the shell with the meat and had to spit it out pretty often. The sea urchin was one of the best we had. It was so sweet and creamy and the texture was so soft. \\n\\nFor entrees we had the lobster spaghettini (only Monday menu) and the lobster roll. The spaghettini was excellent. It had great balance and flavor with a generous amount of lobster pieces! The lobster roll was not as great as expected. Portion wise it was amazing with tons of lobsters in the roll. I got the buttered hot version but it felt like it was lacking butter and some salt in general. Maybe my roll was left out too long since it seemed on the colder side. \\n\\nService was great with the waitress being attentive and helping out with the oyster choices. The raw bar is the highlight of this place for sure.

My favorite thing was the French Toast, because I love anything with a light glaze of sweetened caramelized milk. My migas and refried black beans were decent, but in a tepid and forgettable sort of way.

I decided to go with my boyfriend for happy hour on a Monday and try the nachos, margarita's and enchiladas-All of my favorites. D got the Baja Tacos.\\n\\nThe food was awesome. The presentation was beautiful. The margaritas were delicious. I highly recommend the Enchiladas Banderas. It's pretty because the sauces make a Mexican flag design, and they are each so good. \\n\\nThe staff however... I was not impressed. I gave them the benefit of the doubt at first because I know how difficult it can be if you're having a bad day or someone calls in. There was one girl waiting on 4 tables, about 12 people total. The bartender eventually had to come over to take our order because our waitress was too busy. Once the food came out, she brought flour tortillas instead of corn like D ordered. Something like that is not hard to imagine when you're playing telephone to get your order in.  It seemed like either they were operating a person short or they were new. It's possible the dinner staff is more on top of things.\\n\\nThe happy hour here is awesome as it is everyday 4-6, not just during the week. The atmosphere is really cool and modern. Great location.

My friend and I shared this hot little treat, which consists of a fried corn pancake with honey butter, smoked trout tartare, creme fraiche and little pearl caviar. We split the whole thing, gobbled it up, and had there not been a crowd of people in there with us, I'm sure I would have licked the plate. Yes, it is that good. \\n\\nThe Neptune Burger was also good. It is a cheddar cheeseburger with fried oysters, garlic mayo, and relish. I wish that it had more than 3 small fried oysters.

But it's the perfect place to go with my good friends when celebrating, ex boyfriends who are still my friends, and people I've been seeing for awhile.

Mole maybe?\\n\\nI also have a special place in my heart for their queso -- it's so thick you cut it with a knife and roll it up in a tortilla. It's the best kind of fat kid trick. Second only to...\\n\\nThe coconut cake for dessert. Fantastic.\\n\\nHere's what I don't love:\\n\\nThe chips. And before you say that I'm focusing on the wrong thing if I'm worried about the chips...I wouldn't even bring it up if they weren't stale and cold every. single. time. we go in. It's strange because that doesn't fit with the rest of the Manuel's experience...\\n\\nOverall a solid choice for a Mexican meal downtown."},{"name":"Roadworthy","address":"125 Washington St","city":"Dedham","stars":"5","text":"Loved this place.

She loved it.  Not overly sweet, could even stand up to syrup if desired.  Next time planning to try the fried dough.  Not your typical diner, great twist on breakfast and lunch.  Great decor!"},{"name":"Garrido's","address":"360 Nueces St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"We wanted to like Garrido's, but found that it fell very short of expectations.  After a few minutes of waiting, we ended up parking ourselves as the \\"complimentary\\" valet was MIA.  We had made a reservation online and were seated promptly upon arrival.  The menu was very limited the night we went - not sure if this is the norm, but it only had a handful of dinner entr√©e options.  We were hoping for some authentic Tex-Mex, but should have done more research.  If you're looking for that, this is not your place.  We were craving cheese enchiladas, and although they do offer chicken enchiladas, no other kinds could be found on their menu.  The drink service was prompt and the cocktails were quite good (although small).  However, our appetizer (which was a delicious queso) and our entr√©es arrived almost simultaneously.  I think most people appreciate some time to enjoy their appetizer prior to receiving the main course.  \\nWe were very disappointed in our main dishes. I had the garlic mojo shrimp & linguini & my husband had the pork belly.  My pasta arrived only just warm and was lacking flavor.  I expected some spice since this place is billed as a Mexican restaurant, but I was sadly mistaken.  I thought about adding some of their (very good) salsa to my pasta, but decided against it.  I never add salt to a dish in a restaurant, but found myself shaking a full, but not productive salt shaker on to my plate.  After a few minutes of eating, I found that my dish was very cold.  My husband was equally disappointed in the pork belly.  The sauce was very good, but the meat was mainly fat, and we expected something better since this was the most expensive item on the dinner menu.  They didn't even give him a steak knife to cut it with (and he needed it).   Also, there is such a thing as annoyingly often water refills.  No one likes to run out of water, but when big man arms are haphazardly flying in front of your face (literally, right in front of your face) to fill up your water glass every other time you take a drink, it's too much. It really seemed like the \\"water guys\\" were in some sort of competition (winner filled the most glasses, etc.).  We were also very sad to see no dessert options on the menu.  If they offer dessert, or had a separate menu we were never made aware of this.  This was a special occasion dinner for us - we even put so on our online reservation, we really wanted dessert!   \\nOverall the drinks, salsa, chips, and appetizers were wonderful.  The service was polite, but extremely rushed (so much so that we were back at home within an hour and a half, and we walked from the parking garage around the corner and we live South), the main entrees were only so-so, and finally the food was overpriced."},{"name":"Pine State Biscuits","address":"2204 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Seriously.

There is nothing on the menu that is interesting or exceptional. 90% of the dishes have meat and/or cheese in them, and were you to remove the meat and/or cheese, there would not be much of a dish left.

After reading several good reviews and discounting the negative ones, lured by the unique twist on southern cuisine in a chic, contemporary setting, I decided to give Food 101 a chance and see for myself. The complaints I read  were exactly as stated - Food 101 is disappointing. Our server was very sweet and tremendously accommodating and I tipped her well because it was not her fault that the food was so horrendous.  The food was absolutely unfit to be served. We started with the fried chicken skin. They were barely warm, really greasy and extremely bland, I mean BLAND and tasteless, so after a bite or two we sent them back. Then we waited for like what seemed to be half an hour for the entr√©es and when they arrived, my friend ordered the lamb and it was cold, not room temperature as if it was sitting in a warmer waiting to be picked up, it was cold as if it came directly out of the fridge to the plate and it was definitely not fresh. The accompanying quinoa was even colder. I was so hurt for my friend and disgusted with the temperature of the food but our server was nowhere to be found and we were virtually the only two people in the dining room. While waiting for the server to return to us so that she could take back the ice cold lamb, I started on my entree, braised beef. It was obviously leftover and reheated. It was barely warm and the piece was overcooked and very dried out, the gravy helped but it was hard to eat but we were hungry and shared it. The grits were good but the string beans, which I had to order as an alternative because they were out of collard greens, were like the other items - not fresh at all, but they were edible. Then in walks our sweet server who asked how it was and we broke the bad news and she looked so sorry for us. She took the lamb off the check along with the tasteless chicken skins and we finished more of the beef and grits. We asked about dessert and ordered what we thought was safe - a strawberry shortcake made with a biscuit, can't mess that up right? Wrong. I'm not exaggerating, the biscuit was the worst I ever had. It was Sahara desert dry and hard. I mean, it crumbled like a saltine cracker. By this time we were so disgusted but so hungry that we ate the strawberries and sauce with the whipped cream and left that hard crumbly biscuit sitting on the plate for the server to take back to the chef. I love to go out and eat and try new restaurants and rarely do I find anything as pitifully disappointing as Food 101. Unless they make dramatic changes in the standards of what they serve their patrons, I don't think this place will be around very much longer. I wouldn't recommend it at all. I rate it one star but if there were negative stars I'd rate it negative one  (-1). Do not go there unless you hear they have made deep changes after the date of this review."},{"name":"Patrizi's","address":"2307 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"We are here two nights in a row.

Creole Kitchen always maintained a laid-back, no-frills atmosphere full of friendly people of every size, shape and color who frequented it for the same reason: to celebrate the food. I loved it. I used to get take-out a lot, as did most people but every time I ate in, it was a gas. The staff was fun and friendly and patrons interacted with everyone. Servers talked to you about the food and their favorites. They'd even bring you a taste or a small bowl to your table so you could sample items. If you wanted a dish a special way, they'd prepare it to order...and  suggest side sauces and the like to make it even better. It had no rival. I'm happy to report that after waiting far too long, my wife and I returned yesterday to find the expanded Creole Kitchen to be fantastic. The food is every bit as good, the atmosphere is less confining than its predecessor and kitchen noise is no longer part of the experience. Saturated, happy colors and contemporary paintings suggesting NOLA grace the walls of an otherwise utilitarian additional dining room (cement floors below, exposed duct work above), that now accommodates families. Funky Crescent City jazz tunes and Mardi-Gras masks set the mood. Flatware on paper napkins and china service have replaced the Styrofoam and plastic forks. Water glasses are tall and plastic. The menu is full of bayou favorites. Service is very good. Our waiter noticed that our table wobbling and shimmed up one leg to make it level. He checked on us repeatedly and topped off my water without being prompted. He was also very helpful in making our selections. The food's not cheap but it's a great value. Portions are generous.

For starters, their website says they do reservations, but when you call to make reservations they won't take them. My girlfriends and I went there for lunch on Saturday at 1PM.

Another girl ordered the Waldorf salad, that was awful and made with just chicken and mayonnaise (no grapes, apples or nuts).  She told the waiter that she didn't like it and he said it was going to be comped but wasn't and then he didn't even bring back her change.

For example, you could order entrees like braised short ribs, hanger steak, scallops, and salmon, but also order pulled pork and pastrami sandwiches. On their specials menu, they had ramen with shiitake mushrooms and bacon broth and crispy chicken. and pork belly buns - random right ?! I ordered the ramen and pork belly buns.

The chili-cheese dog was delightful.  The chili is a great consistency (no beans) and more along the lines of a northern chili (but not sweet/spicy like a Cincinnati chili) and they give you the option of either shredded or sliced cheese (I picked shredded).  The 2nd dog was delicious too, but I was a little disappointed in the \\"hot sauce.\\" It was not as hot as I was expecting (I got the relish to help calm the hot I was expecting).

No details in what came with the meals. That will be something you'll have to experience. Dessert was complimentary since we were celebrating.

Let me tell you Master Wok is the only vendor there that I still go to nowadays. Why? Delicious greasy Americanized Chinese takeout with plenty of options, given in ABUNDANCE both for rice and meat/veggies, at very reasonable prices, and leaves you feeling satisfied (on top of the inevitable sense of guilt). Let's be real here, if I forget about health effects for a second, it's better than most of countless other Chinese take-out restaurants I've been to. If health is a concern, I'd still take it over your typical burger and fries any day of the week and twice on Sunday.\\n\\nHaving tried their various menu items, I recommend the Boneless Spareribs (flavorful and not overly fatty like at many other Chinese takeouts) - and the General Gao's Chicken (sweet and a good balance between crispy and soft). Add veggies so you don't die of shame afterwards, and you've got yourself a solid 3-choice combo that's 10% healthy, 20% MSG and 100% tasty (by food court standards). \\n\\nDon't come here if you want hot-served, wholesome, Sichuan Gourmet-level food and good service.

It was a combination of American bar and diner food and Korean Street food.\\n\\nWe ordered:\\n\\n- Potatoes bravas (5/5): This was one of the stand outs from our entire Portland trip! Just crispy potatoes, runny egg, and aioli - so simple, but somehow so delicious! \\n\\n- Bim Bop Bacon & Eggs (4/5): This was good, but after the potato bravas, it just wasn't AS good in comparison.

This was my third food tour and it was great!  \\n\\nWe did the North End Foodie tour.  Audrey the owner of the company and our guide, packed this tour with yummy food and history, as this is the oldest part of the city.

But, I will tell you we ate at historical places as well as new, hip places in the neighborhood.  We also were able to see some really hidden gems.  Because of the area, the focus of this tour is Italian food.  And we were highly impressed.  Audrey has a ton of knowledge of all of Boston.

Everyone was polite, just friendly enough without being overbearing.\\n\\nTo start we got oysters - Kumamoto, Katama Bay, Browne's, Ichabod - 2 of each. Descriptions on the oyster list were spot on. If you're like me, most of your oyster experiences have probably been the large, flat, salty kind. Get the Kumamoto. It's extremely small, low brine, and oh so creamy. The others were more briny, but very clean tasting and great to eat as well. I highly recommend getting the oysters WITHOUT mignonette or cocktail sauce, as both tend to overpower the oysters.\\n\\nWe also got the spanish octopus salad. HUGE chunks of octopus, cooked for a long time till ridiculously tender. The sauce was a bit tart. Vegetables were delightfully sweet.\\n\\nFor entrees, we got the cioppino with lobster and the seared scallops. Cioppino was very tasty, with a pleasant spicy kick and a very generous heap of lobster meat (for only $10 more). No idea what fish they had in the stew but there were 2 kinds, and both were cooked to perfection. The prawns and mussels were nothing special.\\n\\nScallops were perfectly cooked with a nice sear. All the other stuff on the plate - duck confit, blue cheese, brussel sprouts - went together very well. The pear butter was slightly sweet and gave everything a nice refreshing lift. The whole dish was extremely well executed.\\n\\nAll in all it came up to roughly $69 each after tip+tax. Well worth every penny.

The accompaniments included candied hazelnuts, a preserve-like spread, and something else I know I'm forgetting. The cheese plate and the glass of Cabernet I ordered was a 5-star experience in itself. But, of course, being me I had to get an entr√©e and that entr√©e was the Le Pigeon Burger. I have to admit that even I felt some kind of guilt for ordering a $12 burger at a bistro where the food is reputable. But as I looked around at other diners, I kept seeing this amazing burger and the craving for it beat out everything else. And can I just say, the burger was amazing, one of the best I've had, and I would probably end up ordering it again on my second visit. I dig the homemade ketchup, and aioli, by the way. When the check came, a pleasant sweet surprise - a miniature macaron with a bright zingy flavor to it. Talk about a palate cleanser. So yummy (ok, and cute!).\\n\\nThe ambience is charming and what you would expect a bistro to be - understated elegance, white tablecloths, and just a touch of rustic charm. \\n\\nGO. You will not regret it!"},{"name":"Lovely's Fifty Fifty","address":"4039 Mississippi Ave N, Ste 101","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"My mom was in town from Philippines and all she wanted to eat was a margherita pizza.

Tho' I have never been to India, I'm guessing the spiciness of the food, complexity of flavors, & soothing relief from items like yogurt, mint, tamarind, & ginger can deflect the focus from the weather...This meal was spot-on for all of the above & beyond. Vindalho surpassed my expectations & could just become one of my favorite go-to spots.\\n\\nBike parking is a cinch, and we were seated right away without reservations. The room is modern & a bit cavernous...not like lots of hole-in-the-wall Indian places I'm used to. Bright, lit well, sort of Bollywood music going, an open kitchen, & really pleasant & efficient servers.\\n\\nWe began with drinks (I had a lemonade with ginger syrup & ginger ale which was so refreshing. Stuart had a rum & tonic with fresh lime- his warm weather favorite) and samosas. The samosas were large, not greasy & were filled with fresh corn & potato filling, served with a date chutney. Best I've eaten & Stuart concurred.\\n\\nWe both opted for veggie main dishes- I had a paneer done Mogul style with fresh English peas, shitake mushrooms & a creamy/spicy tomato-based sauce. Stuart had a stir-fry with fresh corn, zucchini, and an assortment of other vegetables in a spicy mustard seed sauce. Both came with basmati rice (saffron or studded with cumin(?) seeds) and both were absolutely beyond compare.\\n\\nNo room for dessert this time, but next time I may pace myself & forgo the entree, stick with a couple of appetizers, and try something sweet. The prices were a bit higher than you'd expect for Indian food, but not when you taste the high quality & the full bar, great atmosphere, & local, organic produce. Check this place out if you're in the area & in the mood for Indian food...the naan is also really good- served with some ghee & some course salt, it's pretty addictive stuff.\\n\\nEven if I didn't live within an easy bike ride, I'd still make the effort to come here.

There were specialty sushi rolls (dragon, rainbow, snow crab, etc) which was a surprise. They tasted decent for a buffet. There were even have lobster rolls on weekend, which tasted fine as well. Though the rolls were oversauced, which seems to be the standard nowadays for specialty rolls.\\nThe sashimi slices were too thick and a lot of the slices weren't fresh. You had to check back every now and then to see if there were fresher cuts. I managed to grab a few fresh cuts.\\nThe oysters were OK for a buffet, although they weren't chilled enough, it tasted lukewarm.\\n\\nFor the most part, I didn't enjoy any of the cooked food. For buffet food to be edible, you really have to pick from a freshly cooked pan, but that doesn't happen often. The seafood fried rice was good because it was the only fresh pan I managed to get my hands on.\\nThe deep-fried salt and pepper frog legs were not good at all. It's overcooked and the texture of the meat was quite rough and chewy. The ginger and scallion lobster refilled every half an hour (if not longer) it seemed, and it tasted horrible. The kitchen must've mixed up random sauces and dumped a whole jar of salt to cook it. The lobster meat was also not very fresh or succulent at all..\\n\\nThe price was quite steep at $30.95 per person, with tips, you're looking at nearly $38, not counting the supplemental costs like soda, etc. Totally not worth it, I'd much rather spend my money elsewhere. You can dine at almost any high-end restaurant when you're paying nearly $40/person for high quality food with top-notch service.\\n\\nAll in all, the friendly staff and decent specialty sushi rolls (for a buffet) kept me sane.

The clam chowder was disappointing (the best we had while in town for 4 days was at Rabia's next door).  However, everything else we had at Neptune was FABULOUS.  It is a tiny space, so they take your name and cell phone number and call you when your table is ready; it's nice not to have to stay on site while you wait--though you should probably stay nearby.  Another plus to their system of taking your number and sending you on your way while you wait is that you do not feel the burning eyes of waiting patrons when it is finally your turn to dine.

I can't comment on that.\\n\\n2) I do agree with the people that complain about the kids play area having a strong smell. I have not been in there in a while (I have no kids) but I have been in there in the last couple years and i do understand what people are talking about when they talk about the smell. Its kind of like a strong rubber/plastic mixed with sweaty kids.\\n\\n3) I agree that the prices are quite a bit higher than anywhere else. I have asked about this and was told that since they do not charge for the kids area they have to charge more for the items they do charge for to make up for it. Understandable but since i have no kids i get no \\"benefit\\" from the play area yet have to pay more for my food. I would definitely spend more time and meals here if the prices were more reasonable. They do seem to be very tight on their pricing. They used to have a mini pizza with salad bar combo for less than $7 i think. They got rid of that deal and now its close to $10. The size of the salad bar plates has shrunk.\\n\\n4) The Food:\\nI really enjoy the salad bar and the pizza. The salad mix is usually very good and since i only add a couple other items to it I am not one of those complaining about the lack of salad bar topping options. If you ask me they could remove half the items and be just fine. \\n\\nThe pizza crust reminds me of a pizzeria from when i was a kid. I love the thin crisp cracker style crust as well as the thicker paste style sauce. \\n\\nThe one thing that i don't like is the canned mushrooms. Regular fresh mushrooms would be fine. I just don't like rubbery canned mushrooms. I pick them off if they are on a pizza buffet item.\\n\\n\\nHere is where i explain why i gave them 4 stars out of 5 even after items 1-3. I have rarely had a bad experience in all my visits to Papa's. I have joined their text msg club and get alerts when they are running specials. The lunch buffet for $5.95 (usually once a week via text msg) is a great deal. You get unlimited Pizza, Salad Bar and a soda. They also often send out a text msg advertising a Thursday night buffet for $5.95. So if you like their food but not their prices i suggest you sign up for their text msg alerts and keep an eye out for their specials.

Yes, they had a good variety and yes they were fresh, but it's just hard to enjoy oysters when they're not cleaned well and when there's still a lot of grit that gets between my slurping action and the oyster itself.  \\n\\nWe found the clam chowder to be tasteful but was a tad too soupy with the potatoes on the under-done side.  Then came the lobster rolls which I anticipated with the same gusto as my first born.  Let's just say that I was underwhelmed.  While there were lots of succulent lobster meat, one would think the bread should be of higher quality so it doesn't completely fall apart when you pick up the sandwich.  \\n\\nThe saving grace of this place is its service.

We originally wanted to try Jeni's ice cream, but they were closed and apparently have been for about a month now, but are set to reopen soon.  We were in the area, and I was craving some delicious ice cream.  We popped in, and the place was pretty crowded.  The flavors had cutsie names like While We are young, Keylime pie scream, Chocolate slap yo momma, and Red velvet cakescream.  There was a sign saying they really wanted you to try only two flavors at most.  There were no good descriptions of any of the flavors, either.  Pricing was reasonable, at $3.99 single scoop, $4.99 double, and $5.99 triple.  You can get it in a cake cone, sugar cone, or bowl.  I tried the tiramisu, which tasted only like coffee, so I decided on the red velvet in a cake cone.  The lady at the counter told me it was too soft to go into a cone, so I had to have a bowl.  What?  It's ice cream. Well, I said okay, and got the the bowl. My boyfriend got the key lime.  His tasted way too sour for my liking.  Mine was way too soft, and was turning to liquid quite fast.  It also tasted icy, more like ice milk, not ice cream.  There was zero flavor of red velvet and the texture was anything but creamy.  I don't get it.

As for the short list of pros: The bartenders were great and seemed well experienced. Guava/passion fruit cocktail was delicious. The bar itself was underwhelming & aesthetically boring; it seems it could do well with some vibe & sex appeal but instead stands visibly bland. \\nIt seems that there is a temperature control issue as the AC comes on and shuts off every 5 minutes. It was comfortable when it was off\\nbut freezing when it was on (not sure why the AC is on in October when it's 59 degrees out at 9:30 at night?) we asked if we could move to a warmer part of the restaurant but they said they had no tables (multiple tables were available) but that they'd shut off the air. We thought that that seemed like an incredible gesture and thanked them. Unfortunately 5 minutes after it was off it was on again; we had to take on and off our jackets during our entire meal as the air went on and off again the entire evening. \\nWe ordered the crudo tasting menu to start. The price was incredible but we had no \\"wow\\" moments with any of them. We actually didn't want to eat more than one piece of each (unlike places such as Yvonne's- must try crudo). \\nWe had ordered a crostini which sounded amazing but was awful- it was labeled as goat cheese, hot pepper and eggplant- which sounds amazing, I don't know how you f up those 3 delicious ingredients but what arrived was an unappealing room-temperature gelatinous goop on top of bread. The mouth-feel was horrible.\\nThe pasta dishes we ordered were the orecchiette and the lobster pasta- the lobster was very fishy and had barely any meat it in. The orecchiette was OK, it tasted better the more you ate it. \\nLastly- our server was pretty unpleasant and insincere. Like, smile, or act like you don't hate your job?

The appetizers we received were wrong and mixed up with another table... okay, it happens, so no problem. However, they tasted TERRIBLE. The first appy was a vegetable combo with some potatoes, dry rolled rice (this was weird...), roasted soy beans (not bad), and a salad (two slices of cucumbers...).\\n\\nAfter the appetizers were taken away, the waitress mistakenly gave us desserts (and not even the ones we ordered). It took 5 minutes to call the waiter to our table to have them switched as the staff walked around with their heads down so it was very difficult to flag them down. \\n\\nThe entrees were no better and the cauliflower chicken maybe had a couple of little pieces of chicken and was a normal (but thinner) Indian-style curry. The daikon goat was equally disappointing as the goat meat was dry and the dish had a thick layer of oil on top.\\n\\nWe patiently waited for dessert and if I didn't flag down the waiter once again, we probably would never have left this place... service was just that slow. Unsurprisingly, the dessert was also extremely poorly made. The noodle pudding (vermicelli, milk and brown sugar) was just a lumpy and slightly sweet mixture which didn't have much taste. The saffron almond phirni, although sounding fancy, was just some mushy rice with a couple slivers of sliced almond on top. I can liken it to a bowl of congee with NO flavouring added.\\n\\nThis dining experience took almost 2 hours because of the extremely slow service and definitely left us frustrated. We looked around the restaurant the entire time and noted that the other couples seemed to be waiting and waiting for their food and also complaining about the food quality.\\n\\nIn conclusion, I would NOT RECOMMEND this restaurant to anyone.

But a distant second reason was for lobster rolls.  The intention was to eat 1 or 2 per day.  It was a lofty goal - like hitting a home run in each game over 4 days when each day was a double header.  Okay, not like that at all, but if you're fat and hungry and want lobster, it seems like a loftier goal.  Unfortunately, it didn't happen, and in fact, the only lobster rolls we had were our first day.  This was our first.  It was not the best of the two, and for that reason, it doesn't get the 5th star. I am sure there is room for more than one 5-star lobster roll in Boston, but when you only have 2 of them, it's difficult to justify both getting 5 stars when you liked one more.\\n\\nAnyway, we came straight here after dropping off our luggage.  All of the reviews warn of the wait, but thankfully, it was a Wednesday afternoon, so the wait was only 30 minutes.  The entire restaurant - not that there is much of it - is governed by the wait, including the bar, so you have to wait.  30 minutes isn't bad though and we grabbed some chowder from Pauli's next door while we waited (note that we almost decided to grab a lobster roll at Pauli's before coming into Neptune's for a lobster roll, but that would have been madness!  Delicious, wonderful, madness).  They called my phone to tell me our seats were ready, so we finished our chowdah and walked back.\\n\\nSeated at the bar, the service was fine and seats comfortable enough.  We already knew what we were getting, and by now, so do you.  The wait for the food probably wasn't that long, but the anticipation was killing me and made me feel like it was an hour or more.  It wasn't, and the lobster rolls came out and I freaking devoured this thing.\\n\\nDelicious, chunky, warm lobster served on a warm, buttery, roll.  It just slides down your throat and makes you thank the lord we didn't lose New England in any war with the British or French.  And the fries - seriously, some of the best french fries I have ever had.  Fresh cut, fried in some wonderful oil (probably duck or bacon grease, and if not, then they should do that) and salted to wonderful perfection.  I actually didn't finish the fries, knowing I was going to do some serious damage to myself this weekend and a gigantic plate of fries wasn't necessary, but it was so hard to stop.\\n\\nSo, if I was in such heaven, why am I only going 4 stars?

I didn't even try it.. How can they serve sushi like this ?? Even the low sodium soy sauce looked like it was mixed with water.. (they don't get the point). After seeing those sushi rolls, I began to wonder about the quality of tuna poke or lomi lomi salmon. (I don't think these were made by legit sushi chef) Table was never cleaned when I return with my second or third serving.  Will never go back. Will go to Salty's for brunch instead.

When our food finally came out, we were super disappointed with everything we ordered. \\n\\nOur food was completely cold. I ordered the pancake platter. It was a smaller size of the red velvet, blueberry, banana pudding and reese's pancakes. My bf ordered the Juggernaut sandwich. His sandwich was just okay. He thought there was too much waffle for the size of the sandwich. My pancakes were almost inedible. The pancakes were SO dense. It was hard to even cut through each of them. On three of the four pancake stacks, there was a cream cheese spread between and on top of the pancakes. I took one bite each and could not continue eating. The spread was SO sweet and tasted like straight cream cheese. I'm not one to complain about something being *too* sweet, but I could not stand this spread! It really ruined the taste of all the pancakes. I tried scraping the spread off the pancakes, but it didn't help. The actual pancakes didn't taste good either. The Reese's pancake was okay, but it was SO dense. \\n\\nI don't know. Everything looks beautiful and the service was friendly. I just can't bring myself to wait this long for mediocre food again.

The best things were the collars greens and the seasoning used for the beef and St. Louis style ribs.

The okra was not ripe and they served it with a salsa, which I have never seen in my 30+ years in the south and southwest, but it actually salvaged the dish a bit giving it a pickled-type feel to it. I likened the beans to Mexican or Texas chili beans or borracho/cowboy beans. They were okay but not what I expected. The brisket was bland but tenderly, fell apart.

It didn't taste fresh and was very fishy - like it had been sitting in the fridge decomposing  for a week. It was under seasoned and was raw in some parts. When brought to the server's attention, he said that it's supposed to be a little bit raw. Uh, no, tuna collar should not be raw, especially not at the degree of freshness this fish was in. The other components of the dish were boring and uninspired.  We took the collar home to see if putting it under the broiler and properly  cooking it could give it some life but, alas, there was no saving this piece of fish.

Jake and joes has a pretty cool patio with some lounge couches, big TVs inside and out good for catching a game."},{"name":"Clyde's Prime Rib Restaurant & Bar","address":"5474 NE Sandy Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Such a shame what has happened to this restaurant. I've been visiting this place since the late 90's, the food used to be great.\\nWent Friday February 16th, wife ordered the prime rib it was terrible, so tough, no taste or seasoning, the garlic potatoes that came with it tasted good but had been cold. I had the fish and chips, it was eatable but served only 4 small pcs for $13.95. \\nThe service was GREAT, Jesse our server was very friendly and did a fantastic job in taking care of us. If only she did the cooking I believe the food would have been much better.\\nAfter reading the other reviews I can understand why the gave a bad review. It's a shame but I hate to see someone else be disappointed in the quality of the food."}]`),N={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:z},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:O,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(n=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return n.name.toLowerCase().includes(e)||n.city.toLowerCase().includes(e)||n.text.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(n=>setTimeout(n,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},E={class:"search-container"},R={class:"card-container"},j=["disabled"],F={key:0},H={key:1};function L(n,e,s,f,r,i){const u=p("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"üéâ Restaurant Reviews ü•≥")])],-1)),t("div",E,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"üîç",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=h=>r.searchQuery=h),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[v,r.searchQuery]])]),t("div",R,[(a(!0),o(y,null,m(i.filteredPoems,(h,g)=>(a(),k(u,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),i.hasMorePoems?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...h)=>i.loadMore&&i.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),o("span",H,"Loading...")):(a(),o("span",F,"See more"))],8,j)):w("",!0)])}const G=c(N,[["render",L],["__scopeId","data-v-214f6eed"]]),Y=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"quotesmag/2.md","filePath":"quotesmag/2.md"}'),D={name:"quotesmag/2.md"},V=Object.assign(D,{setup(n){return(e,s)=>(a(),o("div",null,[I(G)]))}});export{Y as __pageData,V as default};
