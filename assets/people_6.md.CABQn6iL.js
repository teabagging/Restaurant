On the downside, the person who took our order was incredibly rude and acted as if taking our order and money were such...a...huge...inconvenience.  We were quick, friendly, and not high-maintenance.

The sausage has a similar taste to a kielbasa sausage you can purchase in the grocery store and prepare at home.  The best out of Salt Lick that I had, in regards to meat, were the ribs.  Those were good.  Nice sauce that seemed to create a candied crust, with nice moist meat underneath. It was enjoyable enough, but not great.\\n\\nI was disappointed I bothered with dessert, as I shared a peach cobbler.  It didn't have enough peach, and instead of crust, it seemed like a doughy cake.\\n\\nThe best thing out of Salt Lick, which I could of consumed more of, was the Dr.Pepper.  When I tasted the fountain classic, it had the taste of Dr.Pepper made with Imperial Sugar in the bottle.  Little did I know, the only difference in \\"normal\\" fountain Dr. Pepper, from Salt Lick's was the water used.  They use well water.  I don't care what it was, it gave me a Godly Dr.Pepper fountain experience.\\n\\nSalt Lick does have great ambience and that real Texas feel.

Luckily, such an establishment was ready and waiting just past the lobby.\\n\\nInfinitely inviting with warm, low lighting and a soothing soundtrack, Mojito's ambiance bespeaks the languorous sophistication of true Latin American fine dining.

We went during dinner time and ordered the \\"Dalkey Duo\\" appetizer (battered cocktail sausages with a Dalkey mustard dipping sauce), which was one of the best apps I'd ever had.  For my entree I ordered the \\"Serious Steak,\\" which was cooked perfectly.  The fresh basil oil that they drizzle on the plate was fantastic, and the amount of food that they gave me for the price was pretty good.\\n\\nDespite my amazing first visit, I was disappointed on my second.  My mother visited around Memorial Day this year and I took her to Raglan Road since we were at Downtown Disney already.  They really need to fix their waiting system; the buzzer that they give you can only go a certain distance from the restaurant, and there is hardly any seating areas outside for people to wait, which was not ideal for my mom.  I feel like it would be better to have an app to notify you when your table is ready, or for Disney to put more seating around the outside of restaurants to accommodate walk-up customers who have to wait for a table.\\n\\nAfter waiting for what seemed like 2 hours out in the heat with nowhere to sit, we were finally seated at our table, which was behind a wall, where we weren't able to see the dancers and singers.  Normally I wouldn't have minded, but since this was my mom's first visit it was disappointing.  We ordered the \\"Dalkey Duo\\" appetizer, which was just as delicious as it was last time, but both of our entrees were very bland and not tasty at all.  She ordered the Shepherd's Pie, which almost smelled like cat food, and I ordered the Luscious Tart from the vegetarian menu, which was bland and uninspired.\\n\\nAfter my first visit to Raglan Road I was anxious to come back, but after my last visit I am unsure if I will waste my time or money there again."},{"name":"Golden Abacus","address":"1275 Providence Hwy","city":"Norwood","stars":"3","text":"Best all around never fails me!

The giacomo sauce looked better; maybe I would be giving a more positive review if I had gotten that.\\n\\nLobster Ravioli - Ravioli was homemade and had nice chunks of lobster.

I've only had them with the vegan cheese, but you can get them with pepper jack cheese for $2 less. I also like the so-called shepherd's pie. And the desserts are pretty good, especially the carrot cake. Oh, the chili is decent too, but it's a little heavy on the cumin for me. I think it would be better with more hot pepper and tomato.\\n\\nOtherwise, I've been unimpressed. I've found two items on the menu to be just awful. The macrobiotic platter with tempeh came with tempeh that was blackened almost to a crisp, plus ridiculously bland vegetables that were also grilled. My sister has been devoted to macrobiotic cooking for years, so I know that blackened tempeh and flavorless vegetables aren't what macrobiotic food is supposed to be. More importantly, this \\"macrobiotic platter\\" was inedible.\\n\\nThe roasted beet and walnut salad was even worse. I've actually made the mistake of ordering it twice, because a salad of roasted beets, walnuts, goat cheese and arugula sounds so good! On the contrary, it's hard to imagine a worse salad than this. The beets are cut into very small, thin slices, and I don't know what else happens to them besides the roasting but they have the chewy-crunchiness of a dehydrated dill pickle. They remind me of Japanese tsukemono or kanpyo, and they don't taste like beets at all. This salad would be a lot better if it were made with bigger pieces of ordinary roasted or steamed beets. Also, the dressing has an overpowering rosemary taste, in my opinion. Try this salad at your own risk.\\n\\nThe service is good for the most part, but on one visit my friend got a cup of tea that was lukewarm. When he brought this to the server's attention she insisted that it was boiling hot. Come on! This tea was served cool enough to down in three gulps.

One of the best BBQ places I've been to all weekend.\\n\\nMy friends and I were in town for a bachelorette party and this was one of our stops our tour guide took us too. Good thing we called in before hand for a to-go order or else we would be looking at a 1-2 hour wait. People are crazy for their BBQ in Texas, or at least Salt Lick BBQ!\\n\\nFOOD:\\nWe ordered some brisket, ribs, turkey, and sausages with sides of coleslaw and beans, basically a little of everything. Take note, the food portions here are huge! Even though we had a large party, we were unable to finish all that we ordered and had to take some back with us.\\n\\nFor me the ribs were the best, juicy and tender and the meat came right off without much digging in. The brisket was a bit on the drier side (compared to the other BBQ places we went to) and the sausages were a bit too greasy to eat a lot of. Turkey and coleslaw were decent. I must say though, the beans are one of their best sides! They are super flavorful and have a bit of a spicy kick to it. That's the one side we finished during our meal.\\nOverall: 4/5\\n\\nSERVICE:\\n*Can't rate since we ordered to-go\\n\\nDECOR/AMBIANCE:\\nEating outside in the lush greenery of Texas is amazing, aside from the flies. Although it was a bit hot and humid, it was nice enjoying the outside weather. There is indoor and outdoor seating. Outdoor seating they have various benches scattered around front (shaded) and back (close to their winery area out in the open). It was an overall fun atmosphere to be in. A popular spot for families and tourists though so it can get noisy.\\nOverall: 4/5\\n\\nThey have a huge dirt parking lot out front which was pretty packed when we were there. They have some nice porter potty restrooms out front, similar to what you would find when going to a TV show taping. They also have a small area out back where you can do some wine tasting. We tried one of the Duchman Family Wines and loved it so much we bought one to drink with our meal. The people here are super friendly and if I'm ever back in Texas I would definitely come back."},{"name":"Craigie On Main","address":"853 Main St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"For the Restaurant Week period, I found out that while Craigie on Main was not participating in RW, they were offering an expanded version of their $39.95 Neighborhood Menu - three courses, three choices per course.  What a great opportunity to try out this special occassion (for me anyhow) spot!\\n\\nThe afternoon before our scheduled visit, I received a call to confirm the reservation.  As a pleasant surprise, I was offered 2 of the 4 seats at the Chef's Table, overlooking the open kitchen.  Sure!  Thank you!\\n\\nNow, I say, if you get the chance, go!  Sit at the Chef's Table, and enjoy!  I felt like I was enjoying front row seats of my very own Kitchen Stadium!  \\"Yes, Chef!\\" \\"Runners, please!\\" \\"Toast for bones, hurry!\\"  \\n\\nOh, and I watched them dissect half a pig's face... so if you are against the consumption and cruelty of animals, consider that before you ask to be seated at the Chef's Table.\\n\\nWe were a bit early for our reservation, so we were initially guided towards the bar side to wait a bit.  Bar seats themselves seem a precious commodity, as a couple that wished to fill a pair of just emptied seats were discouraged.  Perhaps they were reserved?  Later on, we did watch as a number of wonderful looking hamburgers with a mountain of shoe string fries headed that a way during our dinner.\\n\\nThe staff here seemed rather sizeable, as I witnessed a number of servers darting here and there, popping out wine corks, serving dishes.  The kitchen staff themselves numbered perhaps 9, minus the dishwasher I spotted through a swinging door.\\n\\nServing us alone were a multitude working together to take our order, provide us with fresh silverware with each course, wipe away our crumbs, and deliver our numerous courses.  Not that we ordered one of the grand tastings... no, we selected the \\"Neighborhood\\" 3 course prix fixe for $39.95.  Oh, and a side of bone marrow for $10.  But we also received a number of complimentary small tastings throughout our evening.\\n\\nSometimes we received the same items, such as the blood sausage spread on crostini (interesting) and the rhubarb hibiscus foam, while other times they were different, like the salmon pate(?) and the eggplant something or other, and the samplings of sorbet (peach for one and plum for the other).\\n\\nCorn must be in season as I've been spotting corn soup in various forms on several recent menus.  But I'm always up for a good one, so for my appetizer I selected the Potage of Local Butter and Sugar Corn $16 over the other choice of mussels.  It was a pureed soup served hot with a nice corn flavor.\\n\\nBoth proteins in the entrees (Red Quinoa-Crusted Arctic Char Mi-Cuit Wellfleet and manila clams, cockles, roasted cherry tomatoes, pistou-dashi broth $30 and Onion-Smothered Vermont All-Natural Chicken Two Ways: Slow Roasted Breast, Crispy Thigh Confit three bean ragout, tatsoi, natural jus $26) were cooked perfectly, leaving the meat moist and tender.\\n\\nThe bone marrow we had elected to have with our entrees.  The single large bone sliced in two and two pieces of toast sliced in triangles were plenty for the two of us.  If you've never had marrow before, think of it as fat, or rich buttery spread.  Dig some out of the center gooey stuff out of the bone half and slather it on to the toast point, sprinkle it with sea salt and go ahead and take a bite!\\n\\nWhat I imagined to be a simple panna cotta turned out to be Sour Milk Panna Cotta with banana puree, dried milk and some kind of nut.  I was curious to see if I could find a contender to match my top (and now idealized) panna cotta experience at Icarus (RIP), and Craigie On Maine did very well indeed!  It was tasty and smooth and melty good compared to Icarus' which started out with a body and melted on your tongue.  Ahhhhh!\\n\\nI accidentally forgot my leftover chicken when we left.  But before we even turned the corner, one of our servers ran out after us with the brown paper bag in hand.\\n\\nThe only thing I tasted that night that I would not care a repeat of is the rhubarb hibiscus foam, which was not to my personal enjoyment, and left a odd feel on my tongue.  Fortunately though, my final taste of the night was the chocolate almond cluster.\\n\\nBefore we left, I made the suggestion that they add purse hooks for the ladies at the high topped Chef's Table, after all, hanging your purse on the chair behind you in such a busy area isn't such a grand idea."},{"name":"Little Caesars","address":"628 American Legion Hwy","city":"Roslindale","stars":"2.5","text":"It's $5 for a large 'hot n ready' pizza!

The drink menu is creative and the drinks were very well prepared, even the after dinner drinks and dessert was perfect.

She then charged us extra for sharing, even though she never saw us do it. She said she \\"just knew\\" that we had shared our food. One of our friends didn't like her food and barely touched it. The waitress assumed that our friend hadn't touched her food because one of the people who ordered the all-you-can-eat meat plate was sharing with her and our friend was too full to eat her food. Yeah, her reasoning was just ridiculous. When we complained, the manager sided with the waitress.\\n\\nThe bbq at this place is not worth the wait or the money.

It's worth the ~90 minute drive from San Antonio just to get some real bbq. If you come with a big appetite, the bottomless family style is a great way to get a good sampling of the offerings. Otherwise, I'm happy with 3 meat combo plate. I go with brisket, sausage, and ribs, but any combo of the brisket, sausage, turkey, and ribs will leave you with a smile and a full stomach. I'm not a particular fan of cole slaw, and the version here is no converter, but the potato salad is one of my favorites--heavy on the vinegar and potato and light on the mayo. I rarely have room for the dessert, but I'm always happy when I can find some space for the blackberry cobbler and vanilla ice cream."},{"name":"Ladd Taphouse","address":"2239 SE 11th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"Me: So where's the pizza my friend ordered two hours ago?\\nWaitress: Yeah, it's not gonna happen.\\n\\nWait, what?

Our pregnant friend that was with us had to ask three times for water, and once we had our food (because my girlfriend couldn't eat anything) that was the last we saw of the waiter: no drink refills, we had to shout him down to get the check, we had clearly been written off as the allergy table.

Possibly the latest serving sit down meal on the Disney Dining Plan.\\n\\nAs far as atmosphere, it's important to remember this is not a Disney Owned restaurant, which explains that while it has a flair of Irish Pub, its not quite the immersive, transporting experience one expects on Disney Property.  Raglan Road has the kind of atmosphere I would expect from an trendy Irish restaurant in a downtown area .    Possibly hurting the \\"Irish\\" experience is the use of high-end night club lighting that lights up the ceiling with random shapes and just looks horrible.  Changing to lighting that actually compliments the architecture of the building would make it a million times better.  \\n\\nThe band was ok, but definitely not the best.  They were just good enough and just bad enough that it's easy to guess they are either related to or dating someone in management.   (Not sure why, but they played a lot of country...not what I'm in an Irish restaurant to hear).  They were also too loud for the space.\\n\\nFood was great, portions for price were not.  My lamb was cooked perfectly and fell right off the bone.  My friends fish was also just right and juicy.  Seasoning wise we weren't very impressed.  On one hand we don't expect a lot of seasoning and intricacy from proper Irish, but the pricing, presentation and atmosphere raised our expectation for something a little more contemporary (seasoned).\\n\\nI will say, I would have no qualms returning to the place just for their bread.  The pre-meal bread they present is amazing (and very traditional) and served with a Guiness reduction/olive oil mix.  Needless to say its like (honey) budda!

This was our first visit and will probably be my last. Everything started pretty cool we ordered drinks and appetizers. Our appetizers didn't come til the entrees came  I orders calamari and twin lobster tails. As soon as I received my food a fly landed on my food. I immediately sent it back and told the server what happened. She looked at me like with a questioning look, as if she was confused to why I was sending it back. It wasn't the kitchen fault nor my fault but for some reason she was confused. My friend ordered Salmon and it was over cooked so she sent her food back as well. 35 mins went by and everyone else had finished their food and we were still waiting. The server came to ask how the checks should be split and brought the checks back right away. At this point 45 mins has gone by and we still have no food. The server brought the manager over but hadn't explained to her what happened. The manager apologized and said the food would be out shortly. At this point I'm no longer hungry and completely out of patience. Our food finally comes and we immediately ask for Togo boxes. Once I looked at my plate I noticed that it was only one lobster tail. I asked the server about the other one and once again she gave me a puzzled look. 10 mins went back so I asked for the manager again. She didn't understand why they only brought me one lobster and offered to comp my meal but we paid for dinner an hour before I actually received my food again. The waitress brought my lobster tail in 2 mins so I was confused to why it took an hour. I ended up not even eating at all.

I used to live around the corner from Trident and spent countless hours there, drinking lattes and wine, eating momos and vegan chili while working on my thesis.  This was about 10 years ago, and the Trident I remember is very different than what I've experienced recently.   \\n\\nI love the whole cafe-in-a-bookstore thing.   That being said, the past two times I've been in, it's just really loud.   Trident recently expanded to include a second floor, or maybe just draws more people/students/tourists now, which I guess is great for them- but it feels very loud, cramped, and crowded to me.   \\n\\nThe service was just fine (actually BETTER than it used to be)... while not outstanding, it wasn't terrible.  \\n\\nWhat I was really disappointed in, however, was the food.   Maybe I eat better now than I used to, but, wow.   My burger was rubbery and overcooked.   It honestly tasted like it came out of the freezer 5 minutes earlier and was microwaved.  The chicken quesadilla was a little soggy, with chunks of really tough chicken, and really heavy on the cheese.   \\n\\nLuckily, they serve one of my favorite beers, Golden Monkey... which (sort of) made up for the mediocre food and uncomfortable table.

Its my 30th birthday and I just got back from eating at Giacomo's. I loved it so much I just had to log onto Yelp to write a review right way. \\n\\nI am Italian and was looking for good Italian places to have dinner with my boyfriend for my birthday. I read lots of reviews but something about Giacomo's stood out. I mean people seriously said they waited outside for close to an hour in a ICE STORM???!! I figured it had to be good. And the menu online looked stupendous. So Giacomo's it was.\\n\\nSo after the ordeal of finding parking in the North End... fun... Lol! We easily spot Giacomo's as it is the one with a line in front of it.... on a Wednesday night??? I know odd... but there it was. My toes sticking out of my cute peep toe shoes were just about frostbitten by the time we got in there. It actually only took about 20 mins or so... but it was cold! Once we get in I am swept away in the atmosphere... it was like being welcomed into a family's house in Italy.  The aroma and the warm ambiance drew us in. Our waitress was very friendly and provided great service. \\n\\nI was afraid that I would be cramped since it was a very small place but we got a seat in the corner making it more private. I was also afraid they would rush us out as soon as we ate as people have commented.... but this was not the case. The line disappeared as we were eating, so we relaxed and ate and drank... and ate. The food was DELECTABLE! I ordered the infamous butternut squash ravioli which was as good and even better than others say. Then I got the singing of happy birthday which was punctuated by cheers throughout the restaurant. I felt like I was at home with my big Italian family. It was great! And the best part was when we got our check and our eyes popped out... It was soooo AFFORDABLE!!! Such a great value. We had 2 appetizers... one calamari and the other the Caprese Salad with fresh mozzarella. The Calamari was AMAZING!!  I never thought I liked Calamari until I had this one. In addition to 2 entrees, bread and wine. The bill was less than the awful sushi we had last weekend. Crazy!!! The entrees were about $15 each, wine $5 per glass and the apps were about $8 each. Then to top off the night we stopped at Mike's for dessert, which after eating at Giacomo's is now only my 2nd love in the North End :)\\n\\nAll I keep thinking about since I left is... when am I going to go back!!!

I only had room to eat the Zuppa, so my review will be about this dish only: the Zuppa contained shrimp, calamari, clams, mussels and lobster, served over linigiune with our choice of sauce.   We opted for the Fra diavolo, which was a mix of the spicy marinara and beschemel sauce.  Yum!  I opted out of the scallops because I'm allergic, so they added more of the other seafood items to supplement.  My seafood eating partner in crime (Brandon K!) and I seized the challenge and ate through the mounds of shellfish, noodles, and sauce!

I finally decided to pull the trigger and make my first visit this past Saturday night. You really can't see the front of the club from LaVista Rd so it maybe easy to miss, but it's located in the shopping center right behind the Chic-Fil-A where Jason's Deli resides. My time at the establishment ran from 1:30am to 4:30am.\\n\\nParking:\\nGiven this place is located in a shopping center and the other businesses were all closed there was ample parking to spare. There was no valet parking either from what I saw (which is a plus in my opinion as too many places in metro Atlanta have that which don't need it).\\n\\nFees:\\nThere was no parking fee of any sort, but there was a $10 door cover.\\n\\nSecurity:\\nThere was a Dekalb County Sherrif onsite parked outside for additonal security from the time I arrived until I left. There were also numerous bouncers on-hand.\\n\\nDrinks:\\nI'm not a huge drinker so I merely engaged in a few beers. I glanced at their drink menu and they have a wider selection of drinks which vary in price. Most regular beers are $5 a pop, they have buckets of beers too, pitchers, and etc. It's the typical night club selection for the most part. The bartenders were fast, attentive, and quite sexy too I must add.\\n\\nFood:\\nI did glance at a menu, but I didn't order anything to eat so I can't say how it was. From the menu it looked like the typical finger food type stuff (wings, fries, etc) you'd expect in a night club.\\n\\nMusic:\\nWell given this is a Latin club you should expect to hear Latin music and it doesn't disappoint. I don't speak any Spanish at all outside of a very limited selection of words, but even so the music is the type that makes you want to dance lol. Even a non-dancer like me was shaking my head and tapping my feet to it as I sipped on my drink.\\n\\nAtmosphere:\\nOverall the atmosphere is great. The inside of the club looks really good with lots of seating and a very active dance floor. The men's bathroom (obviously I can't speak on the women's lol) was probably one of the best ones I've ever been in in a night club. I'm guessing, but the crowd seemed to be of the more mature 25+ variety (maybe because La Rumba had something big going on that night based on when I drove past there just to hedge my bets lol). I definitely liked my visit to Coco Cabana and will certainly plan to visit in the future.

Whenever he'd come downstairs into our kitchen area, heat up that leftover, and then open up that lid, I felt I that I was being hypnotized by the smells.  Every day, I'd wish so hard that he'd offer to share.  About once or twice a week, he would, and he was generous.  The other days, I could only dream I had a Persian wife (uh, well, husband, in my case) who would cook me such heavenly meals.\\n\\nSo, my dream didn't come true.  But I did discover Alborz, and for about $9, I could sample their all-you-can-eat buffet!  I highly recommend doing the buffet, as you can try a little bit of everything.  Check their website for hours and a menu.  And when you do go to their buffet, try the tomato/green onions/potato stew.  I always go back for seconds on that one.\\n\\np.s. if you're unsure about Persian - it's more Indian than Middle Eastern, and a bit sweeter.

They close mondays, so it benefits both parties (diner and management) for them to sell their incredible food in a 55 dollar six course tasting, drawn up and garnished at the whim of the chef, rather than throw it out on tuesday. Quite frankly, the meal blew my effin mind. Some highlights:\\n\\nAmuse Bouche: Sea Urchin w/ Nasturtium leaf puree. (Eating this brought an ear to ear smile to my face. I don't think I stopped smiling for the rest of the night.)\\n\\n4th: Hanger Steak w/ Sauce Verde, Beef Tongue Ragout (the beef tongue ragout transformed the hanger steak from the cheap cut about which any lousy cheap chef can charge big bucks, preaching the belief that because butchers would take the hanger steak home rather than selling it to customers as though it MUST be the very BEST piece of meat on the cow, which is certainly an exaggeration of the actual truth, into the cut that one brilliant butcher would hide from customers because no one else appreciated the incredible flavor of the meat located so close to the kidney when paired with a light garden-of-herbs sauce growing from an earthy ragout of beef offal. It was depth beyond my warmest memories of demi glaces.)\\n\\n5th: Concord Grape Sorbet with Candied Fennel (The freshness of the grape in the sorbet reminded me of eating them raw at the end of a night at l'Esp.. However, it was a little salty. Standing alone, the grape flavor would not benefit from this obtrusive seasoning as an intermezzo.. but then the sweet licorice of the candied fennel, just a tiny piece on top of the sorbet, trickles down your palate on the salty wave of savor. One bite prompted this journey of flavor, a happy New Englander marries an Italian and the whole laughing drinking family is gathered around the table in the yard under the shade of the very tree the grapes came from, and the chef is reminding you very gently, there will be no more meat and fish and vegetables, thank God. Desert is next.)\\n\\n6th: We each got something different. I got the chocolate. Dark chocolate torte with layers of ganache. Each layer was thin and light, the cake was more crispy than rich, and the flavor of chocolate was nearly overwhelming. Luckily, perched atop the ghoulishly inviting old house of chocolate decadence was a scoop of white chocolate miso ice cream. I was irritated. I was irritated some whacked out modernist cuisine fashionably asian gastronomer would throw miso in my white chocolate ice cream simply to turn some heads in the culinary world, or please a silly chef who needed wild and whacky flavors trying to stay hip in the ever-evolving foody world. Just another crazy way of forcing the time honored elegance of salted white chocolate seem new and we're-just-having-some-japanese-iron-chef-fusion-fun... But, the rest of the meal had been so directed, so passionate.. Could there be more to the dish than first angry and mildly drunk impressions? It was only slightly less irritating but ever so delightful to admit to myself, mid bite, I was actually enjoying myself more than I ever had out to eat in a restaurant. It's something special to think, especially considering that I pride myself in being a cook and a gourmand interchangeably, had I not gone out to eat the night I had and received the tasting I got I may never have tasted that combination of flavors in my entire life, which in spite of my irritations and reservations, in fact utilizing their slight discord to the benefit of the chocolatey melody, played a classic but complex movement effortlessly. My love of chocolate united after a brief courtship with the flavors on my tongue, presenting themselves with the powerful swing of a 60 piece brass band in the dark corner of a small but crowded restaurant just before closing."},{"name":"Giacomo's Ristorante - Boston","address":"355 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"This is a true Boston original.

This place is just popular and I know why.

When we got to the restaurant we checked in and we waited 10 more minutes to get our table cleared and to finish out our wait time. \\n\\nWe were seated pretty close to the surrounding tables, but I think that's what makes this place fun. The atmosphere is always loud and warm. Customers of all kinds flock to this restaurant. Our waiter came over pretty quickly and took our orders. \\n\\n*Entree: Salmon Croquette ($13.95)\\nThe Salmon Croquette dish came with two crispy salmon croquettes (with what seemed to be truly fresh salmon, no canned stuff), creamy grits, and house remoulade. The salmon was fresh and light. The crab cake is packed almost perfectly in the shape of a hockey puck, and once you cut into the croquette seems to fall apart in flakey goodness. The grits are cooked well and seasoned to fit most taste buds. \\n\\n*Side: Eggs with cheese ($3.00 for eggs; $1.00 cheese)\\nThe side of egg was two cracked eggs seasoned well. \\n\\nOverall this restaurant deserves an A+. The food is all good, filling, great portion, the Yelp wait-list is a killer option, the location is true Atlanta (across from the aquarium, world of coke, and museum), and the hustle and bustle is worth the check-in.

As I waited for my pizza, I began looking forward to an exciting experience of a crispy and delicious meat covered monster of a pizza. Lo and behold, somehow the pizza presented to me was somehow both soggy and burnt at the same time. Each bite taken tasted terribly bitter from the overly charred bottom.

Seeing the episode of Man vs Food where the schlub host eats here reminded of just how amazing my experience was at the Salt Lick.\\n\\nI was in Austin last May for Chaos in Tejas, reliably one of the best punk rock festivals in the world.  I spent most of my money just getting from Chicago to Austin and was saving the majority of what I had left for beer and records.  During my five days in Austin, 65% or so of my meals came from a block of cheese and a loaf of bread I picked up from the market near my buddy's place, washed down with either water or some Lone Star.  Not exactly high dining.  \\n\\nThe hype from my hosts about The Salt Lick did not fall on deaf ears.  I eagerly awaited the long trip out into the country to see the place for myself.  As we pulled into the dirt parking lot I noticed how completely packed it was for a Sunday afternoon.  I thought this was the south, didn't people have to be in church?  Oh no my friend, they fucking eat meat.  \\n\\nThe moment I walked in everyone seemed to look at me cockeyed.  It was like they knew I was a northerner.  Slightly uncomfortable with the staring (maybe it wasn't such a good idea to wear a shirt with a picture of Wisconsin across the front?) I began to look aimlessly around.  Then I came across the fucking grill.  Instantly I forgot about the stares and my mouth began to water.  A couple minutes later we got to our indoor picnic table complete with little oscillating fan.  \\n\\nI picked up the menu and was slightly taken aback at the prices but then remembered what I had seen back up at the front.  Holy fuck was I ready to dig into some ribs and side dishes.  20 minutes later my face was so covered in BBQ sauce I looked like a toddler.  I had managed to cover my entire face, yet somehow only eaten a mere 50% of my meal.  OH MY GOD!  I had to brave another Out of Place Northerner walk of shame to the bathroom to wash my face but by that point I was so fat and sassy I didn't care.  \\n\\nI ate my leftovers for another two full meals throughout the remainder of the weekend.

I am used to deals or lunch specials, but there were none to be found, leaving me to pay $3.00 for one slice of pepperoni pizza which didn't include a drink. I was hoping for that price, that the pizza would be good. \\n\\nLuckily for me, it was almost worth the price. The pizza itself wasn't the best I've ever had, but the winner for it was the crust. It was almost as if the most delicious garlic bread was attached to the rest of the pizza and left me wondering if this was the best crust I've ever tasted on a pizza. It had a ciabatta-like quality to it, slightly crispy outside, warm and not overly chewy inside and full of flavor. The troubling thing for me though was, I enjoyed the crust a little more than I enjoyed the pizza. Because I didn't feel like spending extra money for a drink, I just had water, which was given to me in a cracked cup. I pointed this out to an employee, and they replaced it for me.\\n\\nIf the pizza had been a little better than the crust, and there had been a $5 two-slice lunch special with a drink, it would have been hard to not rate this place 5 stars.

The parking lot is a sea of cars behind the \\"banquet hall\\" and waiting area. After you navigate your way through the parking lot you walk up to the check-in girls where they give you one of those buzzing coasters and are summarily forgotten about until said coaster buzzes.\\n\\nWhen you go here, expect to wait a while. We arrived at 6:15 and were told the wait was about 40 minutes...we were seated an hour later. At 7:15 the wait was an hour and a half. There was a live band there and they were pretty good, but they should NEVER try to pull off a Doors song, they just don't have the voices for it. It came off sounding gay and whiney (imagine Andy Dick singing Five to One).\\n\\nOnce we got inside, we got stellar service from our waitress (Kelly I believe). \\n\\nWe both got the combination plate (family style was just too much food) with Brisket, Ribs, Sausage, Cole Slaw, Beans, Tater Salad, 1 Sweet Tea, 1 Non-sweet Tea. It also came with some bread, BBQ Sauce (both spicy and not) and 2 Marinated Jalapenos. We also ordered extra side (1/4 pound) of Turkey. Peach Cobbler for dessert. It sounds like more food than it was.\\n\\nFirst off, let's talk about the BBQ sauce. It's different than what most Texans are used to when it comes to BBQ sauce. I'm not saying it's bad. This stuff is actually AWESOME (especially the spicy) and we even bought some to bring home, but if you're put off by sauce that isn't the same-ol' tomato/ketchup based stuff then this might not be the place for you. It's Yellow. It's sweet. It's tart. It's tangy. It's yummy.\\n\\nBeans: Unremarkable at best, I've had beans out of a can that were as good as these.\\n\\nCole Slaw: It was good, had a different flavor but was as good as most Cole Slaw I've had. \\n\\nTater Salad: It looks kind of unappetizing and doesn't look like most Tater Salad, but it's excellent stuff. I think it shares some ingredients with the BBQ sauce.\\n\\nBrisket: Very good stuff by itself, even better with the sauce. Aside from that, nothing note worthy. \\n\\nRibs: One thing that usually puts me off with ribs is having to work to get the meat off the bone. I'm there to enjoy my meal, not work at it. These ribs were excellent. I was able to pull the meat clean off the bone with little more than a tug and they were so tasty they didn't really need any sauce. \\n\\nSausage: Like the brisket it was very good by itself and even better with the sauce but aside from that there was really nothing note worthy about it. \\n\\nTurkey: Now...for the most part I don't like Turkey. It's dry, sucks the moisture out of your mouth and just has never done anything for me. Not this stuff. This was juicy, smokey, succulent, tender, tasty heaven in my mouth. I have never in my life had better turkey. I would drive all the way down there (I live in Dallas) for a whole turkey for Thanksgiving. \\n\\nBread: Good. It was bread.\\n\\nJalapenos: I love hot foods. My favorite hot-sauces are based on the Habanero pepper. Let me just say this - BEWARE THE JALAPENOS THEY WILL BURN YOUR FACE OFF. Other than that, they were excellent. They were crisp. They were tasty. They were just too damn hot. \\n\\nCobbler: It was good but nothing to write home about. I've had better cobbler at Spring Creek and Boy Scout campouts.\\n\\nTea: It was good, but if you're not accustomed to Hill Country water it may throw you off. \\n\\nThe meal overall was very good and we came away satisfied, our waitress was awesome but the wait time was excessive. If it weren't for the wait, this would have been a 4 star experience.\\nWould I eat there again? You bet I would. \\nWould I wait as long as I did again? No, probably wouldn't wait more than 20 or 30 minutes. \\n\\nA couple of things they could do to soften the wait to be seated. \\n1) Have a \\"Now Seating Number X\\" sign so you know how far down the list you are \\n2) Offer refreshments.

Ordered the Kenmore Tots, which are tater tots smothered in delicious bacon, chipotle aioli and cheddar cheese.  They smell AMAZING and taste even better.\\nThe beer was good and seems to be a rice beer or brewed in the Japanese style. Lots of nice floral notes and goes very well with the cheese on the tots and brings out the spicy aioli flavors too. \\nFriendly service, very clean and way cool interior design. Blue tile backsplash behind the bar with frosted glass lit up with blue light. Not what I think of when I imagine your typical beer bar, and normally I would think this design would only work in a club but somehow it really just works here. 16 unique beers on draft and I can't decide what to have next because none of them is one I have tried before. Even better selection in bottles. \\nTo top it all off, the bartender's ipod was on and one of my favorite Modest Mouse albums played thru the speakers and I went in to bliss overload. Coat hooks under the bar, cash only which is the only drawback, and probably the cleanest bathrooms I have ever seen in a bar.\\nFinished out my visit with a Mayflower Pale ale, which was good but didn't trump the Brooklyn.

With the side of generic (UTZ I assume) chips and a soft pickle, the meal as a whole left me disappointed. \\n\\nFor what it's worth, two people at my table ordered the famed lemon ricotta French toast, and it looked nothing like the Yelp pictures. Sad and dry looking. \\n\\nOther nitpicks:\\n-Our table had trash on it when we were seated\\n-Ice cubes were not provided with the water\\n-The environmental was far too noisy for conversation or work\\n\\nThis place was on my list for a long time, and I was looking forward to it.

My girlfriend, who can't eat much dairy, had kind of a hard time picking something that would fit her needs and settled for the goat cheese pesto pizza. It was delicious but definitely not something she could eat often. We'd be back more frequently (since I loved the food) if there was even just one dairy-free option on the menu.\\n\\nLunch with one beer each and pizza leftovers came to $25/person-- not at all bad for the quality of food and central location.

I told myself not to expect too much when I finally decided to try it. I didn't want to get disappointed! Well. I definitely was not disappointed. \\n\\nAntico's has several locations, but this particular location is within walking distance from Georgia Tech. They have a parking lot behind the building, along with street parking at the various homes around. Beware. They do fill up because they get super busy during peak times. When you enter, there's a big menu overhead and you order at the counter. Keep your ticket, as you will need your ticket number. Seating is communal and they have those wooden, cafeteria-like tables. Oh if you opt to get tap water as your drink, note that the water will be coming from a sink. So I'd probably recommend just paying a little extra for a drink. They have sodas, bottled water, beer...a good variety. \\n\\nSo pick a seat after you pay/order. They'll call out your order number, you raise your hand, and they bring it over to you. I've had the San Gennaro ($22) and the Diavola ($22). They serve one size for all their pizzas and they say that one pizza can typically feed up to 3 people. I have come with 4 people and ordered 1 pizza. Each person got 2 (big) slices and we were all full. It just depends on your party's appetite really. I absolutely love their pizza. I guess it would be more accurate to say I love their dough. I could honestly care less what goes on the pizza. The dough is just that good. As far as the pizza, they go pretty light on the cheese, and their toppings are huge. So if you like getting a topping with every bite, this might not be for you.\\n\\nOverall, I would highly recommend Antico's. The place is a little small, but just be smart about when you come. Service is always super friendly, and prices are definitely reasonable for how much you get. Whenever I have anyone visiting from out of town, I usually take them here. It's a great, casual hangout spot, and they do have TVs. The only downside is how small it is inside for how busy they get!"},{"name":"Stone Soup Kitchen","address":"584 Woodward Ave","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I went today and found the food to be only average,  and pricey at that!

Rather grainy, watery, and not much flavor.  Tkt said 16 oz soup (must be volume of bowl filled to top-which its not) and  its not a big bowl for being in the upper $6's.  The sandwich rather small also -2 4inch round sandwiches on rye. Comes with choice of chips or a corn-black bean mix today.  The cheese inside was good. Sandwich  price was at or near $9.00  I think. I sat both parts on top of each other and compared to volume of a half turkey sandwich and the half sandwich volume size was larger than my full sandwich. I realize volume isn't everything and I did after all order a cheese pimento.\\n\\n    Just wasn't wowed by anything.

I know, I know.....it's been a long time coming, but finally I got there. My pizza demon got too strong, and I succumb to the pressure, and went for pizza on Sunday afternoon. Besides the fact that the pizza was AWESOME, I hadn't heard anything about Antico. This review is more about what they are missing, versus what you actually get. Yes, the pizza is AH-MAZ-ING...like, INCREDIBLE....probably the best pizza I've had outside of NYC. If you want a great pie, you cannot go wrong with Antico. Period. Now, for what I wasn't prepared for:\\n\\nSo immediately, the menu seemed way too complex to be a pizza shop. I get it...they want to keep the integrity of the Italian theme and ingredients, and I dig it, but it took me way too long to figure out how to order the pizza I wanted. Even with the help of the staff, it took a while for me to understand. There aren't any substitutions, so what you see is exactly what you get, and you will deal, or you will go elsewhere. At some point, I believe folks will just go elsewhere. You cannot customize your pie in any way....again, WYSIWYG (what you see is what you get). I asked about having a pie with half marinara, and half \\"white\\" sauce, and was told that wasn't possible. That was disappointing. And again, I get designing a menu for an experience, and wanting the patron to have the most authentic experience possible, but I also want the freedom to make my own choices with my pie! LOL LOL. I was also disappointed that there was no fountain drinks....yup, only bottles, and no ice....seriously...you don't have ICE for the drinks? Yes, they are cold, but again, what's the issue with having some convenience. Finally, the price point is pretty high for pizza. I ordered a margherita pizza and added pepperoni ($4 upcharge), with a Coke Zero.....I paid over $29!

Over-all it was a little less crowded than the louder theme park next to it, which suited us fine. Also, there are less rides and more show experiences.\\n\\nIf you show up there early the place will be eerily empty. Many of the places don't even start until 10 - 11 a.m., despite the park opening at 9 a.m. The streets of Hollywood, New York City, and Amity Island were very quiet to start, but filled up pretty quick.\\n\\nClassic Hollywood streets have some cool things to see. I recommend the Horror Make-Up show, which is less about make-up techniques and more about comedy. It is absolutely hilarious! They also have the T2 3-D experience which is cool (even if a bit dated). In this area is Mel's Diner, a classic 50's joint (with music and old cars); the burgers here were very tasty!\\n\\nFurther in you'll find the E.T. ride, which is ~very~ dated yet was a lot of fun for those of us who were kids when E.T. came out. In this area I recommend the Animal Actors show which is pretty funny. Keep going past this (we didn't stop in the Simpsons area) and you'll find the Men-in-Black building. Not only is the ride cool but even the wait to the ride (that takes you through MIB HQ) is neat.\\n\\nAround the corner is Amity Island, a recreation of the coastal town from Jaws. The Jaws ride is cool but definitely dated, but I like the Eastern Shore atmosphere of the area.

Meat and cheese plates here are also worth looking into.

Don't employees get discounted food? I mean, out of just my order, they got free bacon and half a patty so they're half way there. Fries were half full and gross. Tea was old. I threw the whole order away and went to chick fil a instead. Which is where I apparently should have started. I'll be calling the manager tomorrow to get a refund. No sense in calling tonight, since I don't even think a manager was there. I really don't understand how hard it is. You read my order back to me, and still served me the wrong (inedible) food. I just can't. Look at the photo. Ridiculous."},{"name":"R. F. O'Sullivan's","address":"151 Central Ave","city":"Lynn","stars":"3.5","text":"Finally visited Sunday.

I used to think this was one of the best restaurants in the area (and they were voted that in 2016) but after our last meal it seemed old and tired. First, we had difficulty changing our reservation to ad an extra person, and this was a week before our visit. We (a party of five adults) were originally scheduled by the restaurant to be at a high top. They were big hightops but that made no sense and we asked to be changed which was no problem. We were placed next to the stage and we were unaware there was a show tonight (our last visit there was only dnaners and bands who performed mini acts). No offense to the hard working band but the set was very long to the point of being annoying as we could not enjoy our dinner and conversation was impossible, On to the food.  Very disappointing. The portions were erratic. My ham was enough for me and so was my daughters chicken pie (probably the best meal of the evening). My wife ordered her \\"fish and chips\\" which was basically fried fish with a handful of fries. It was crumb topped fish, not batter. The others in the party ordered an unseasoned/unflavored salmon salad and a lamb dish that was OK in taste but tiny in portion - I felt bad for the person who ordered this and asked if he wanted something else to add in order to fill the void (which he politely declined) The entire bill was about $140 with no alcoholic beverages or appetizers. Disappointing considering most of the party was still hungry after finishing. Service was adequate but seemed wooden and the restaurant really has lost its personality. Maybe it has fallen into the Touristy place to stop. Well, as locals, we are not buying it.

This time on the menu it was Lobster Mac & Cheese and so I went for it. \\n\\nAt 13 dollars it's a decent, not large, not small plate. Perhaps a tad over priced if you look at the ingredient list. Cork screw noodles, a cheese sauce, celery, lobster  with a little salt and pepper. \\n\\nI was happy it wasn't over salted which was great news to my palate but the cheese sauce fell flat. When you are paying 13 bucks for Mac & Cheese you want to get something that's creamy, robust, hearty. Something that makes you feel comfort. The sauce was a tad too thin, a bit too soupy. I wish it was a bit more creamy.  It did coat the noodles well so it wasn't a total loss. \\n\\nOver all the lobster was good, I hit a few pieces that were a bit chewier than I would have liked but I'm not going to complain. My compadres were commenting on the celery in the mac, my husband hates celery so he'd never eat it but I didn't have a problem with it.

At that moment, Lola was feeding a youth group from Oklahoma and she straight made a plate for me.  Crawfish etouffee, yams, collard greens and cornbread. WHO DOES THAT?!?! EXPECTING NOTHING IN RETURN?!?!?! Nobody here in LA, that's for damn sure.  She didn't even charge him, but when he came back to the car (where I was waiting) we grabbed the cash we had and gave it to her.  \\n\\nNeedless to say, the boyfriend turned around for one minute and the next minute the plate was licked clean.  He had never seen me eat so fast.  The combination of love and amazing food made for the best meal I have ever had.  NO JOKE.  \\n\\nLola, I will return to your restaurant every time I'm in Austin.

Management told our server not to serve 4 of the people in my group any drinks, cause they were too drunk. This was our start to the night. None of us had any alcohol to drink, and when we asked management for an explanation, their attempt at an explanation was laughable. In the end they apologized for their mistake, but by then our mood was spoilt and appetite diminished. If you deny someone alcohol, you better have a good reason to. The management at Barcelona did not. All we got was \\"someone saw someone in this group drunk\\". If a hunch was all it took to deny alcohol, I feel like there was a double standard.

I'm not sure why Totto Ramen does not get the same level of rave Yume Wo Katare receives.  Totto Ramen is way under-rated.  It may even be better than Ippudo in NYC - only downside is that Totto's menu is quite limited.  Yume is more catered towards students - its origin, Jiro Ramen in Japan, is also popular to students who loved Jiro because of the amount of food they get for the price.  As a judo player in college, I was forced by my seniors to eat their ramen to gain more weight, but I never found the ramen that tasty, just tons of moyashi and pork and fat. I  guess that's okay, though - truly outstanding ramen is not for everyone.  Anyways, Totto Ramen, from their steaming broth, quality noodle, char-broiled pork and half-boiled egg, was impeccable.  I didn't care much for their spicy condiments - it was like smearing catchup all over the fries, clouded the true flavor of the broth, but it was very difficult not to like dislike Totto.  I can see how some may argue that their ramen may be too mainstream, catered towards wide variety of ramen fans, which may be why it does not get much attention, but it is good.  True, it's cash only, but I just can't get over the fact that there is no waiting.  I would go to Totto Ramen three times instead of waiting hours at Yume.

But.... Here goes. \\n\\n\\nI must give this place the lowest rating ever. I had a work conference and made reservations for my party of 12. We went at 6:30 p.m on a Wednesday  so it was almost empty when we arrived. When we went everything seemed okay..... We ordered our drinks and the drinks were okay... We ordered an appetizer and the food was good... \\n\\nWhat gives this place the worst rating ever was when we ordered the main meals. Me and one other person ordered stuffed chicken. The wait was forever for everything... Then when they brought out the food, the two stuffed chicken plates were missing. They said it takes a little longer because it's stuffed. About ten minutes of the awkwardness of two of us not having our food, someone else at the table told the manager that we were still missing two plates. The manager said \\"those are coming out right now\\".  After a couple of more  minutes.... And with two of the people already done with their food, they brought our plates out. I was very upset. I told the waitress with the manager right there that \\"I'm okay, you can just take my meal off.\\" All the waitress said is \\"are you sure?\\". She didn't ask why, and didn't apologize for the wait.... Like I said... As the manager was right there. \\n\\nIt's really not that hard. So does every time someone  orders stuffed chicken, they are waiting ten more minutes than the other people at the table? What if I was on a date and it was just two of us? Why wouldn't they just start cooking the stuffed food earlier or why wouldn't  the waitress give us a heads up so that we could order something else? \\n\\nWith 12 people, and with a bill of over $200, they could have easily apologized or just acknowledged the problem .  So instead of having 12 people go back to a conference of 800 people and suggesting this restaurant, I have to tell people to look elsewhere. This place is close to Disney , and there are too many other options.  This is a restaurant that will probably be another statistic and end up closing its doors.

Even my Bloody Mary was great.  The waitstaff is friendly, polite and nice.\\nFor dessert, I had ordered an Ice Creme Sampler. When I asked the waiter what exactly that was, he said that I had a choice of 1 of the 3 flavors, I went for the chocolate. Then I got a plate with one scoop of ice creme - before I could say Rumpelstilskin - a waitress apologized, let me know you're supposed to get more than that - 3 scoops and then showed up with another bowlful. It was more that I could eat and I guess the first waiter was new, yet I really appreciate the proactive action- awesome.\\nAre there any cons - I'm sure if I thought about it long enough I could create one but dang (now I'm sounding like ya'll) everything is so good and well done, who thinks of those things:)\\nGo - eat - drink - people watch - repeat."},{"name":"The Lower Depths","address":"476 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"The Lower Depths is a melting pot of beer.

So their pizza margherita was really delicious with perfectly baked crust and fresh toppings. (Some pizza places that make similar type of pizza in Atlanta have slightly burned my crusts, so props to Antico for getting it right when we had their pizza!) It's nice that you have a view from the seating area into the kitchen as they're building pizzas. Kids get pretty excited about that. It's a very casual atmosphere. When we went, a big portion of the seating area was community-style seating at a long chunky wood picnic-like table. You just scoot up where there's room on a bench if you're not seated at the peripheral seating. I've heard that it can get busy here and seating becomes scarce sometimes with a wait, so the dining area may or may not be a negative for you. I was comfortable with the arrangement and felt we had plenty of room, but it wasn't extremely busy when we were there. We also had a caprese salad as an appetizer. The price point is acceptable for this type of \\"higher-end\\" pizza in relativity to other similar pizza places I've been to...however it is more on the splurge-end of what I'd like to spend on pizza as a student. You do get a really large pie when you order a large. I believe we ended up spending around $40 with tip.\\n\\nFor the splurge/price factor in combination with the fact that they mixed up our appetizers the first time around, I'm giving Antico a 4 out of 5.

Most of those various ingredients were probably just sitting under a heat lamp, with the eggsception of the eggs which we ordered scrambled, waiting for unsuspecting customers like ourselves.

And once again, we dined-out on the weekend with the assistance of a Groupon.  To some extent, I'm beginning to see the correlation of Groupon offers to number of stars given.  In this particular instance, the stars are for the staff...more than they are for the food.\\n\\nFor those on here that have difficulty in understanding the rules of Groupons, I emplore you to have someone else READ the rules of a Groupon before you purchase them in the future.  We KNOWINGLY went for a \\"Linner\\", and fully expected to PAY the $13 dinner price of what was late lunch-hour dining time.  This, I have no problem with, because I knew what I was getting in to when I arrived.\\n\\nThe place was sparsely populated, which for us was a good thing, because it meant spending time at the buffet reading and understanding the dishes a more pleasant, less-rushed affair.  I did not take something I didn't know what I was getting in-to.  The atmosphere was pleasant, with some light elevator music playing our favorite North American 80's and 90's sounds.  We were very pleasantly greeted as soon as we arrived, and were offered any seat in the house.  Let's head up to the food!\\n\\nAll options were nicely stocked and the lighting was sufficient to detect what was available for the taking.  However, this is where things become less favorable:\\n\\nI like stews, I like saucey affairs, and I like well-cooked food.  However, it was plainly obviously that most of the food choices were either originally canned, and/or, REALLY over-cooked.  Jerky chicken, anyone?  :)  Actually, let's hit the good things:\\n\\nThe lamb, baked chicken, hummus, VERY-fried rice chunks and cucumber sauce were nice.  The second batch of the chicken strips was far more juicy than the first (a good thing), and I enjoyed the beef souvlaki.  Interestingly enough, I found the rice-pudding actually edible, however, I have a feeling most of my fellow diners will consider it extremely over-sweet, and oddly flavored.\\n\\nThere were far too many rice-dish varieties, however, the rice itself was nice-n-fluffy.  But really?  Five different varieties of rice dishes out of 15 total, plus the crispy-fried rice chunks?  Rice, anyone?!?!\\n\\nThe \\"carrot cake\\" was nice for tea, and the bread squares was a good pairing with the hummus.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the post-Linner departure meant I needed to drag my salt-infused ankles behind me as I lugged my inflated legs to the door.  I think I could actually feel my skin tightening as the salt and water expanded every inch of skin.  It was an awkward feeling, no doubt!\\n\\nOn a plus-note, the staff here are actually very pleasant.  The manager was charming and very kind, willing to discuss certain \\"requests\\" I made, and permitted each one to happen.  I definitely give him high marks for accepting the reasonable requests with no resistance.  Our waitress was also quite friendly and informative.  By the time we left, I'd say the place was close to a third-occupied, and most folks appeared to be doing what they came to do - eat!  I guess that's a good sign.\\n\\nWhile I started out with a 2-star assessment before writing this, having now put mind to typing, I'm going to up this to a 3-star.  The staff definitely helped make it happen.\\n\\nOf course, the biggest questions of all:  would I recommend it and would I go back?  If you are an intelligent shopper and understand the agreement you are engaging in, I would probably recommend it only on the virtue of a Groupon discount.  I can't say I'd be back paying full-price any time soon.\\n\\nAuthentic Persian food?  Uhmmm...I don't quite think so.  But for something \\"different\\" than the normal chains, I guess.

I've been coming to Bangkok Thai since I was about 15 years old and it has never failed to satisfy me. It's not the ambience or the decor because there is honestly none of that here, but THE BEST Thai food Atlanta has to offer! My favorites are the Drunken Noodles (Thai Hot) with Shrimp and the Shrimp Ashore (Thai Hot) both are only $8.50 at lunch time. The meals at lunch or dinner are very reasonably priced with a Lunch Menu entree costing you between $8 and $10. They have several meat options for each dish including chicken, shrimp or beef and for a little extra they allow you to have both. If you like Spring ($2.95 for 2) or Cheese Rolls ($3.99 for 2) splurge and get the Cheese Rolls! They are sweet and tangy with a nice balance of flavor. They do have a shrimp and carrot pur√©e in them so if you're allergic stick with the Bangkok Roll. The cheese roll comes with a delicious sweet chili sauce and it's perfect for dipping. Other menu favorites are the Curry Chicken Fried Rice and Sorcerer's Apprentice. If you normally like Thai Tea you must try theirs. It's sweet but so delicious! They open for lunch from 11:30 AM-2:30 PM and then reopen for dinner from 5:00 PM-10:00 PM. This is a place you take a date at night if you want to strictly impress them as a Foodie. No frills, just AMAZING Thai cuisine. The service is also SUPER fast and friendly. You can be in and out at lunch time during a rush in literally 30 minutes! To top it all off the owner is one of the sweetest people you'll ever meet and when she's not too busy cooking, she often comes out personally to greet customers.

The wait, however, wasn't too long for a BBQ table. Something a bit annoying though is that we were snubbed by the hostess when she attempted to seat a couple that got there after us, but thanks to their politeness (and some words in Korean I didn't understand), we were seated. So thank you, nice Korean couple!\\n\\nAnyway, on to the food: the bulgogi and kalbe were both decent, though I think a bit overpriced. The bad news is that there is a minimum of two orders per table, so I ended up ordering two orders for myself, as my girlfriend is vegeterian. The good news is that they bring out a heck of a lot of side dishes, which made me happy. If my memory serves me correctly, there were at least eight. Unfortunately, their beer selection is a bit weak, which does a disservice to the BBQ, as beer is the perfect accompaniment.\\n\\nThe service was a mixed bag, but overall, I was satisfied. Despite the initial snub and some slowness, the staff was very friendly and helpful. For example, we mistakenly ordered regular japchae rather than vegetarian japchae. They took it back and replaced it with little hassle. I think they were a bit shocked, though, that I was eating this gigantic pile of meat while my girlfriend would be picking away at a vegetarian dish. Ultimately, I felt a bit sorry for our overworked waiter while the hostess barked commands at him.\\n\\nOK, we just opened up our doggie bag and discovered that they put the leftover beef in the same container as the vegetarian japchae. What? There goes a star.\\n\\nOK, I'm revising my review up another star. I went there for lunch on a weekday, and it was just freaking fantastic. Get one of the combination BBQ meals (or whatever they're called) for two people. You can easily share it among three or four people, and it's much better value (even for just two) than ordering different BBQ meats separately. Getting that and the japchae for three was way too much food. It's sooo much tasty meat. The waitress that time actually came by and cooked all of it for us, too.

He was rude in his responses, has no customer service skills and lacks the necessary people personality it takes the be a server. He made what was to be an enjoyable evening with friends celebrating a birthday, stressful.. he seemed overly annoyed with our table and disappeared many times leaving our cups empty, food missing and to top it off I had to hunt him down after having my check for about 15 minutes because I needed to get going.

Is it here for decoration only?  I decided it just meant I could not move it to another table - few that there are.  My $21 San Gennaro pizza arrived quickly.  The huge pan it is served on barely fit the counter and took up two spaces.  I ended up having to stand and eat, hunched over the pan.  I don't mind things like this.  It was piping hot and a nice party in my mouth.  Nicely flavored italian sausage hunks, tasty sweet cherry peppers, tangy sauce & buffalo mozzarella melding together on a somewhat crispy/somewhat limpy crust.  You must eat with both hands once beginning a new piece.  I tossed it all back with a $2.25 aluminum bottle of coke (they have a refrigerator with cokes, water, and Italian sodas).  There are no condiments on the counter seats.  Just a roll of brown paper for \\"napkins\\".  I think i did spot some olive oil, garlic & parmesean on one of the big tables.

When I see such a change in a place I can only assume that it's due to the economy (stupid!). Less profits lead to skimping on ingredients, maybe saving that piece of fish that's over-the-hill.

One major issue is that our party of four was seated at a bar height table, with tall chairs.  This may be OK for a drink, but it's not OK for a restaurant that takes itself seriously.  I guess we should have objected to being seated there.  It was an uncomfortable way to spend two hours.  Management should consider this seriously.  We were served excellent bread upon being seated.  The bread basket was refilled cheerfully.  The cocktails were very good.  Wine was OK.  The menu was a bit challenging- this is not the place for a picky eater to go.  Appetizers were excellent.  I had some of the best fried clams ever.   A friend ordered the fried pig's tails.  They tasted like spare ribs.  My wife had a pasta appetizer that was very good.  Entrees were not as excellent.  My wife had the mullet, which she didn't love.  I had the pork three ways.  The rib and the confit were excellent.  The pork belly was OK.  Dessert was really disappointing.  The desserts were all avant garde/deconstructed/intellectual/challenging dishes.  We uniformly hated them.  I had \\"banana bread bread pudding\\", which tasted like something that may have been freeze dried and served to astronauts during the 1970's.

I saw  other groups of people redeeming Groupons as well. I always feel a little apprehensive using them, as I know the restaurant only gets about 50% of the money from it, and may be worried that Grouponers won't tip. However, we were made to feel welcome and the service was excellent. Our waiter was very attentive= fresh bread was quickly brought to our table, and our drinks were refilled often. Despite the Groupon's small print, we were informed that we COULD use it for the buffet or regular menu items. \\n\\nWe looked at the menu before opting for the buffet. The food was wonderful! I liked just about everything, especially a chicken dish which was to die for. The huumus and bread was delicious as well. The only thing I didn't like was a beef stew, which was probably just a matter of personal taste. My friend loved everything as well.\\n\\nI liked the atmosphere of the restaurant. It's small but not stuffy, casual and comfortable. There was also a belly dancer for entertainment. \\n\\nOverall I enjoyed my meal. Plus it's kind of healthy, right?

Unpretentious and small, the dishes here pack a hearty punch of Old World goodness. No extra flourishes or foppiness, just real food. The prices here are reasonable, especially compared with the touristy places on Hanover Street, and you get a good amount of food for your money. \\n\\nLast night, I had one of the specials-- gnocchi stuffed with wild mushrooms, and it was the best gnocchi I've ever tasted, hands down. The hubs tried their rigatoni alla boscaiola, and our friend had the fusilli al tegamino (both were big hits). I've never had a bad meal here-- though I do try to avoid coming to the North End during the crazy weekend times, so take that with a grain of salt. \\n\\nHere's the short list of things that you need to know: there aren't a lot of tables (typical North End), so plan ahead and make a reservation. They  are on OpenTable, but you could also just call ahead. Try the caprese, have some wine, enjoy some conversation, and watch the pretty fire in the brick oven. Check out the rooster sitting above the statue of the Virgin Mary, and enjoy your dinner. \\n\\nAlso, the squirrel on the front awning is awesome.

I ordered the chicken and waffle, sis ordered the Southern Breakfast and cousin had an omelette. The southern Breakfast was decent...sausage was GREAT, potatoes just OK and eggs were over cooked and brown, omelette was so salty it was inedible and had canned spinach and the chicken and waffle was pretty tasty. The waffle was a bit cold but the chicken was excellent and very well seasoned. The coffee was awful almost as if it had been sitting and was very bitter.

The food is better than your run of the mill BBQ shack but they've got marketing & customer service down. I was very hesitant to dine here because it was so far away from the downtown area of Austin that I'm accustomed too while visiting. Don't worry if you've got the address down in your GPS and you find yourself driving down empty back roads in the hill side, it just means that you're almost there.\\n\\nI must say that it was larger than I expected. To sum up this establishment, it would be like a theme park and a restaurant mashed together except without the rides.There's plenty of things to do on the property while you wait around 1 hr for your table. It will pass by a lot faster than you think. They encourage BYOB, so make sure to stop and grab your favorite beverage. They even have live music towards the end of the evening. Everything there is enjoyable, from the wine tastings to the fresh lemonade. You will certainly be able to keep cool under the giant oak trees while you slowly inhale the fumes of good BBQ to entice your appetite.\\n\\nThe menu was pretty straight forward and I wanted a little bit of everything. The sides (I got coleslaw and potato salad) weren't that great, but then again you mainly go to a BBQ place for the meat and not so much for the sides. I was slightly disappointed by the bland vinegar based coleslaw because I'm used the sweet mayo based version. What was called potato salad actually seemed more like chunky mashed potatoes. Although the pickles were delicious because they weren't your average bulk pickle slices.\\n\\nIn my opinion, Salt Lick is a restaurant to make the trek to for the experience and the atmosphere and not solely for food. I would stay away from the cobblers because they are pretty sad. The peach and blueberry cobblers consisted mostly of corn syrup to add body to the dessert.

Both are relevant, they do both all of the time, and both ensure that you're going to walk from this Congress rivet with a satisfied smile. \\n\\nBut it's an interesting juxtaposition, by virtue of the fact that it flat doesn't happen many other places around town.  Plainly stated, most higher end establishments view themselves solely as such as price accordingly, and most lower to mid-end (mid-end?) joints have an expectation of their own that they pass along.  But  fewer and far between are the times when cool chains (and this is one) act progressively, and this is at least one example of same.  \\n\\nAnd if that means that I occasionally trade the high dollar elegant steak or fish entree for a couple of casual Fireman #4s, then so be it.

I frequent both this location and the location in the South End the most. Flour is a favorite lunch catering establishment of ALL of the advertising agencies I work with. It never fails ... My question to whomever I am offering a catered group lunch is always what is their preference -- and 9/10 times - the answer is Flour!! They have a wide assortment of yummy sandwiches -- I have tried them all - delicious! Despite having lines out the door any time of day you visit (rightfully popular in Beantown), they always manage to cater at least one lunch and one breakfast each week for me. They are always on time and everything delivered is freshly made. Their catering manager, Aimee Kark is delightful to work with -- and the baked goods and pastries -- oh my God I have died and gone to heaven!! Nicolas at the South End location is also terrific. Quite possibly, I could be Flour's biggest fan. I highly recommend. And I swear, their food has helped me close some new business. My only warning to new patrons (and this is absolutely not Flour's fault) is if you visit their location on Farnsworth St., be sure to pay for parking. Don't risk it with your hazards on in front as in the blink of an eye, you will be towed away. There are two places to park nearby - and to be safe, check your car in there if driving. The South End location has metered parking. If you're catering -- call ahead as they have a very busy schedule.

The mushrooms were great and were seasoned well.  My dining companions got the Saturday special steak, local sole, and scallops.  The only complaint regarding their dishes was the price: the Saturday special's price wasn't listed but it ended up being $36 which we thought was too much.  The gnocchi was well worth the $15 I paid, so I can't mark them down for that!  The hot chocolate pudding was good, but I wouldn't go out of my way to recommend it.  Their meals and atmosphere live up to the expectation of a fantastic European experience."},{"name":"McDonald's","address":"4540 Ashford Dunwoody Rd NE","city":"Dunwoody","stars":"2","text":"one of the worst McDonalds ever. just as bad as the one off of Roswell Rd.\\n\\nwhy is it that these two McD's cannot get it right? the fries are never full in the container they give you. it's always like HALF full. wtheck? the fries don't taste fresh either. it's always room temperature or way too salty. another thing, your order never comes out right. they'll always forget to put something in the bag. they no longer ask you if you want any sauces. even when they do ask you, they'll just ignore you and skip placing the sauce into your bag. at this location, they also give you your food first and drink after. who does that?! you always get your drinks first! such unfriendly, \\"I don't want to be here\\" type of faces (at the drive thru). ugh...the list can go on forever, but I rather write about another business now.."},{"name":"Craigie On Main","address":"853 Main St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Came to get drinks at the bar, which were really good.

Thanks, bartender whose name I didn't catch! \\nGot kind of hungry so decided to split the brussel sprouts and famous Craigie burger! I've been hearing about this burger for so long and I was really curious to try what multiple foodie sources have named \\"best burger in Boston.\\" I honestly have not tried enough burgers in Boston to know if this is true, but I have to say the Craigie burger was delicious! The meat was perfectly cooked, and I liked the texture of the bun. Sure, it wasn't as \\"creative\\" as some of the other burgers I've tried elsewhere, but I don't think a burger has to include a bunch of high-end, exotic ingredients or be doused in inventive sauces for it to be amazing. As my English teacher in high school said: \\"Keep It Simple, Stupid\\" (KISS). Not that I'm not a fan of the out-there burgers of Bartley's, for example. I must admit though that the fried egg made it extremely messy to eat, which was slightly embarrassing. I liked that it came with potato wedges, which I prefer over fries. \\nOh yeah, they gave us amuse bouches and this little citrusy cocktail at the end of the meal. Cute.\\nI'd come back to try the food. If it's as good as the burger I had, then definitely worth it. But not without a reservation..it's a small place and it gets crowded fast!

I am a die-hard Subway fan and I have been all my life. I can't explain it...I'm very discriminatory when it comes to food, but it's something about the bread, the many options, the prices, the dressings....I don't know. I have met people who share this love (be it openly or secretly), and I have met people who hate the restaurant with a passion. I urge both of these groups to try the Subway on Bee Caves Rd. in Westlake. You will not be disappointed.\\n\\nI go most every day to this location on my lunch break because it's in close proximity to my job. Like you, I've been to some horrible Subways. My mother's nickname for the restaurant, \\"Cardboard Way\\" is true at many locations. But this is where Westlake Subway defies what we all expect from a Subway franchise. The staff there - Julian, Janie, Dawn, Tan Ho (sp?) and all the others - are amazing. It's a high traffic location, and many Westlakers stop in for a cheap, quick and filling lunch. Here's what makes this store exceptional: \\n\\n1) On many days, the line is out the door. Julian and his crew can get through a line of 20 people in about 5 minutes. I do not exaggerate. \\n2) The vegetables are always, always fresh and they are never out of anything. The tomatoes are almost always ripe and most of the veggie choices would rival any restaurant in Austin on freshness and taste.\\n3) You can get a sub, chips, cookies and a drink for under $6. Each day of the week you can get a different \\"special\\" for $3.99, which includes a 6\\" sandwich, your choice of chips or cookies, and a drink. Where can you get that much food for under $5 and actually WATCH it being prepared?\\n4) Where most Subways have started to charge .50 for soda refills, .50 for extra cheese slices, and are only allowed to give 1 napkin per bag, in Westlake you can refill your soda as many times as you please and they even set out extra napkins (recycled paper towels) next to the drink dispenser for people to take as needed. Additionally, they do not spend five minutes trying to separate the cheese slices because they are afraid of food costs and the franchise owner. \\n5) Their clientele ranges from upper-class moms with 3 & 4-yr.-old screamers to groups of Latino or Mexican men coming in on their lunch break. The staff is bilingual, and routinely shifts from English to Spanish based on their customer.\\n6) They bake (not from scratch, of course) their bread and cookies daily.\\n7)They have pizza! Which people actually buy! And there's a variety of veggie and meat toppings right in front of you for $4.49.\\n7) They will call you by name and remember your order. \\n\\nHere is a place that qualifies as both fast food and a chain, but also qualifies as good, fresh, quick and economical.\\n\\nThe taste buds say...Lick your plate clean."},{"name":"Thai Win","address":"8292 SW Nyberg St","city":"Tualatin","stars":"3","text":"We love this place!

Let me just start off by saying that if you're trying to decide where to eat, THIS is the place. Cute building, cozy interior, suuper friendly service, and such comforting and amazing food. You won't go wrong. Trust me. Just do it. You're welcome.\\n\\nAnyways, so of course, it being HH, we had to start off with drinks:\\n- Daiquiri: This was so refreshing. Apparently, it was Ernest Hemingway's favorite drink, as my boyfriend kept reminding me. Who knew rum and lime juice would be so refreshing?\\n- Nacional: I don't have the menu with me so I probably have the name wrong, but this was a blended drink with rum, lime juice, and REAL MANGO. The flavors all worked so well together and it was definitely a nice start to our vacation.\\n\\nNow... for the one of the best starts to any vacation I've ever had -- the tapas:\\n- Ropa Vieja: This was a shredded pork dish, served with our choice of pan fritas, which were two pieces of bread. So delicious and so comforting. The flavors were all on point and reminded me of a beef stew and the sauce had us trying to soak up every last bit of it with the bread.\\n- Empanadas: We got two different kinds - spinach/cheese and chicken/corn. The spinach/cheese reminded me of a spinach artichoke dip. My waistline took a hit, but my stomach and heart were so happy. I definitely preferred the chicken/corn over the spinach/cheese, though. It wasn't as heavy and was tomato-based, which I love.\\n- Masitas: This was definitely the boyfriend's favorite of the night. Deep fried pork in this delicious sauce, served with a side of slaw. I'm not even a fan of slaw, but each bite of pork with slaw was absolutely perfect. Definitely a must-get.\\n- Arroz Amarillo: The saffron flavor was HUGE in this dish. It was almost a little too strong at first, but when paired with the other dishes we got, it was absolutely perfect. The olives throughout the rice also added a great level of flavor to it as well. Who knew a side of rice could be such a hit?\\n\\nBetween the two of us (and we were starving btw), I thought this was a good amount of food for two people. By the time our server came around to ask about desserts, we had to (with the deepest amount of regret) decline. This might've been our biggest mistake during this trip because the desserts looked amazing and by the time we tried to come back on a Saturday night for dessert, it was way too crowded and almost all the desserts were gone.\\n\\nFinal verdict?

Contrary to popular belief, the original Lick is not on HWY 360, but a good half-hour drive away in Driftwood, on a big piece of open land surrounded by farms and cattle fields.

(There is a helpful map in the Yelp Photos section or on their website.) Open your windows and smell the BBQ. \\n \\nThere's usually a wait, but they provide an outdoor area with plenty of tables and beer. Once inside, the smell overcomes you. Pass by one of the few open-pit barbecues left in central Texas, and steal a glance at your meat being BBQed. Make yourself comfortable at a hard, wooden table. Look around and you will find gloriously happy, bbq-stained, smiling faces.\\n \\nIf you're hungry, go for the Family Style all-you-can-eat platter. You get an assortment of brisket, pork ribs, and sausage. They also have chicken, and other dinner platters. Warning: Vegetarians, do not come on an empty stomach. They DO offer a veggie platter that comes with warm rolls, mashed potatoes, cole slaw, pickles, and beans (yes!). Only problem is, the beans aren't veg (no!). Corinne once had a waiter tell her that he \\"scooped out the big meat parts\\" so she could eat the rest. Mmm. \\n \\nTip: Whatever you can't eat goes home with you, so if you always eat just enough for them to bring you another helping, you're golden for the to-go box.

My dad and I tried Estelle's last night for a pre-show dinner, and it was a mixed bag.\\n\\nSince we had tickets for an 8 o'clock show, I called ahead to see about reservations for two around 6 pm. I was told by the gentleman on the phone that they \\"discourage reservations for parties of two\\" and that they (the restaurant) try to keep tables open for walk-ins; since we'd be eating on the early side, we'd be the dinner rush and shouldn't have a problem getting seating. OK, cool.\\n\\nWe got to the restaurant around 6:10 and were told that there'd be a wait -- about ten minutes. Not a problem, we'd have a drink at the bar while we waited. When I asked for a cocktail list, the hostess informed me that they don't have a full bar -- only beer/cider and wine. This normally wouldn't be a problem but since I made a point to check whether there was a full bar (Estelle's Yelp page says there is), I was disappointed. I decided to go with a glass of shiraz, and my father had one of the pinot noirs.\\n\\nOur wait time for a table ended being a bit longer than we were quoted. Maybe twenty minutes. Not terrible by any standard but, again, since I had tried to make a reservation earlier in the day and was told by an employee not to, I was frustrated.\\n\\nFor our meal, I ordered the braised pork shoulder (with garlic greens instead of the mashed sweet potatoes that normally come with) and my dad ordered the fried chicken (it comes with a large side of homemade mac n' cheese). The pork was a fairly big portion and tasted very good (the greens worked great). However, the underside of the pork wasn't very warm -- about room temperature -- so that was a disappointing surprise. I had a piece of the fried chicken and it was great: delicious breading, tender chicken, and not greasy. The mac n' cheese was also very nice, although the cheese was a bit on the mild side.\\n\\nI didn't mention the cool pork to the waitress since I didn't discover it until about halfway though our meal and because we were pressed for time. Our waitress was very pleasant and cheery though, and I get the impression that had I said something about the pork, she would have taken it back to the kitchen without issue.\\n\\nWe didn't stay for dessert since we had to get to the theatre, but my dad ordered a cup of coffee. He said it was fine.\\n\\nAll an all it was an OK/good, but not great, meal.

The rides, the food, the atmosphere, the hotels, the special effects, the employees are nice, and the boat ride over to the parks from the hotels is fun.  The hotels are so different and that is why I like it.  Compared to Disney that has like 18 hotels and each one takes a long time to get to each park, Universal has fewer hotels but you get the parks faster.  Disney is better for family with kids under the age of 8 because they like Mickey Mouse, Winnie the Pooh and the slow rides where as Universal is more modern and the rides are faster so 9 years old and above would like that better.  For Universal, it helps to have seen the shows or movies as the rides will make more sense to you.  Since Universal has two parks, you can really see everything in a short period of time as compared to Disney, you need to stay for a longer period of time since there are more parks and you feel like you could miss some things.  I suggest going to Universal for your next Orlando vacation!\\n\\nSuggestions to Universal:  Please take out the Lost Continent and expand Harry Potter.\\n\\nFrom an adult's point over view:\\n\\nUniversal is geared towards pre-teens, older kids and the kids at heart.  If you have a family of pre-teens and teens, this is the resort to go to for sure while in Orlando.  The hotels are nice and the attention to detail is really cool.  Portofino might be my favorite of the hotels and you really feel like you are in Italy. The hotels are dog friendly too and the employees will walk your dog while you are out enjoying the parks.

Ribs are fall of the bone and delicious, with a homemade barbecue sauce you -want- to get on everything else. The collards are the best ive had in Orlando and have awesome flavor without being oily. I also really enjoyed the fried shrimp. Its a family owned business that has been around for 30 years, and it shows in the quality of all of the items we tried (ribs, shrimp, collards, beans, and mac). Relax a bit in the shade while waiting for your order, the heat can make you sleepy but it is an oddly (or maybe not) comfortable place to sit and relax a minute. They do not cook far in advance and add racks or w/e else to cook as needed. The owner (very nice guy) and I were talking about that and how big (and overrated) places like 4 rivers are run, and how he's not after that anyway. When they have leftovers at the end of the night they hand out plates to the homeless and start from scratch again the next day, and believe me, you can taste it."},{"name":"Chambar","address":"568 Beatty Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Delicious flavor party!

The pancakes were okay, but tasted like they were cooked on the same side as the sausage and bacon. Good food goes a long way when the service is great, but unfortunately that wasn't the case here. The service was forgettable. I wasn't greeted by anyone when I entered the building. The young lady with the short haircut was at the register taking a phone call. After the callwas done she took my order, while at the same time counting the register, and handing money to another waitress. This made me uncomfortable because while this was happening, she kept messing my name up, which made me feel that she would also mess up my order. It's okay to tell a customer to give you a couple of minutes while you finish something up. It's not okay to try and multitask and start messing things up. Having the kitchen in the front makes people feel comfortable about the handling of their food. Wearing gloves also makes people comfortable about the handling of their food. However, this type of setup can also make the people handling the food too comfortable with how they handle the food. I watched one of the cooks handling pots, ladles of grits being poured into other pots, rubbing his apron, taking cigarettes out of his pocket, having a cigarette in his hand, while at the same time touching people's bacon with the same gloves, handling eggs with the SAME GLOVES! This is not how you handle people's food. This was an over handling of people's food. Gloves should only be used as a secondary safeguard to protecting people's food from germs. The number one safeguard should be the training of the staff and knowing that there are utensils for them to use while preparing people's food, which minimizes mishandeling. I made the young lady and the chef aware of this issue. The chef seemed attentive, but the young lady who stated she was the manager did not, and instead try to defend what I saw an experienced my first time at your establishment.

About 5 minutes after we were served the ramen, we checked with our waitress about the appetizer, and her response was \\"Yup, they're still coming out,\\" with no acknowledgement that they should have already been out by that time. \\n\\nFurthermore, it was about 10pm, prior to receiving our appetizer, when I noticed that our waitress was prepping the mop bucket for cleaning at closing time (10:30PM). I saw her touch and handle both the bucket and mop handle, and I assume that she also touched the mop sink faucet, all with her bare hands. I've worked in enough restaurants to know that these items just aren't clean at any restaurant. Without washing her hands, she comes over to the ramen bar area, picks up our appetizer plate with some of her fingers touching the top of the plate that our food also touches, and brings it to our table, still with no acknowledgement that this should have come out BEFORE we were almost done with our meal. I really wanted to cancel the appetizer and ask for the shift manager, but my boyfriend convinced me not to since we were pretty much ready to pay and leave anyway.

It's in a small strip mall on Broad that's really hard to see from the street.\\n\\nI called ahead to place a take out order, since it didn't look like there's anywhere to sit in the place (there's two small tables but not really for eating), and it was only going to take about 10 minutes. I had ordered extra meat and cheese, and it was only going to cost me about $7.25.\\n\\nFirst issue when I get there is the girl at the front forgot she was baking my sub. Whoops, does it smell like burning in here? Oh well, they threw together another one for me that only took about 5 minutes to make and didn't charge me for the extra meat and cheese. I appreciate that.\\n\\nI think my biggest mistake was getting extra meat, because it was almost too much. I wasn't sure how big the sandwich would be, but I should have known, since they use Auddino's bread. Points for quality bread. Unfortunately, there wasn't much flavor in the dressing to break up the massive amount of meat I had on there. Also, in the 5 minutes it took me to get back to work, the dressing had managed to cut through the bread, making it super soggy.\\n\\nAs I said, I'm going to give them another chance, since maybe I just put too much meat on the thing.

It's taken me a few days to get to the point where I could write about it. However, on to happier things - the fact there *IS* a flavor of the month is pretty cool. The fact that they partnered with other Atlanta restaurants to create each monthly flavor is even cooler (June's flavor was created by Zeb Stevenson from Parish - who I may now be following around in an attempt to get the recipe). Second - I'll admit I'm a little bit of a binge customer - I looked back through my mint.com records and over the last 14 months there's several months where I didn't visit - then a flurry of visits in the same month - so I have to assume I'm binging on special flavors of the month. :) However, if you asked me what I usually order from the regular flavors, it's the combination of caramel sea salt with pimento cheese. It's the ultimate blend of sweet, salty and cheesy that I can eat without getting that queasy feeling I get after consuming handfuls of say, movie popcorn (plus my lips don't feel like they're going to shrivel off from the sodium).  Third, I'm a little put off  by Yelp reviewers that assume that since their experience wasn't what they hoped and dreamed, then clearly the other reviews are \\"planted\\". But there's other reasons that particular review should be discounted - namely the flat lie that you can't get out the door for less than $10. There are actually 3 sizes to my memory under $10 (definitely 2, but I'm pretty sure 3). And this is specialty popcorn, so if you're expecting to pay $1.29 like you do at Target it's not gonna happen. But - hey, if Target popcorn is your thing, knock yourself out. Popcorn isn't something that I feel compelled to munch on often enough that I'm running through Publix and think \\"HEY! I NEED to eat some popcorn. LIKE RIGHT NOW.\\" To each their own. I don't go back to a business 21 times (thanks mint.com!) for stale product and poor customer service. I'm just sayin'. I've never had anything but the friendliest service there.

So, with that said, I bought a bottle of wine and headed to Antico on a double date. \\n\\nWhen the pizza first came out, I was disappointed. There was a thick crust at the end! That's not traditional Italian. However, my whining stopped when I took my first bite. They use the most fabulous cheese, sauce, and toppings. They're so fresh.

The fries were good and was served with mayo which is what I'm used to (coming from Europe).\\n\\nI could taste a bit everything that was in the broth. Love the kick of the smoked chili and acidity of the lime. I did find that the tomato overpowered the coconut cream as I felt that it was merely just a tomato based. We also ordered the Ribeye steak with cauliflower puree, chimichurri, horseradish and shallot marmalade. The Ribeye was exceptionally tender and juicy. We had it medium rare. The chimichurri complimented the steak really well. However, I found the other elements didn't add much to the dish and was just there for presentation.

At least it was cheap at $13.60 a pitcher.  \\n\\nThe wings were all right.  The flavour descriptions don't really match what you get, especially with the \\"wet\\" wings, but they are tasty enough.  I actually prefer the dry wings there best, because the flavours actually come through.  The Greek were my favourite, and the Mexican ones were pretty good, too.  Charging for dipping sauce is pretty lame, though. Be sure to get your wing orders in before 5 pm or the price goes up.  $0.39 per wing is the sale price.  Any more than that for a wing is a bit silly.  Especially when there are no veggies or dips provided.

I often like to try new places, where as my wife would rather go to Sizzle Pie every time. In search of a Vancouver contender I stopped here on a Tuesday about 6PM. I was lucky and there was no one ahead of me so I ordered three pizza's, a pepperoni, margarita, and an \\"our favorite\\".  Preparation and cooking took an appropriate amount of time and the proprietor was pleasant during our brief interaction. I took all three pizza's to go and ate them at home about 20 minutes after leaving the food cart.\\n\\nThe ingredients all seemed fresh, or at least they had nice flavor. We both enjoyed all three pies, which was a bit of a surprise since neither one of thought my wife would like the \\"our favorite\\". \\n\\nUnfortunately the crust was rather average, in fact we didn't eat most of it. This is where the one star deduction comes from. In a metro flush with pizza joints having acceptable crust just isn't enough. Additionally, there was a fair bit of crust, which reduces the value of the pizza when you don't eat it. Mind you the crust wasn't bad, it just wasn't good.\\n\\nI would eat there again if I was in the area, and I would recommend someone to try it, but it isn't quite good enough to get me to drive 20 minutes across town again."},{"name":"Craigie On Main","address":"853 Main St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"So I ended up back at Craigie on Main, after taking a spell away after a pretty mixed experience (some fantastic food incomparable to other places, some middling over priced dishes, and very odd customer service) while my friend Hannah was in town.\\n\\nThe glue that binds Hannah and I together the fact that will eat just about anything, that weekend included two types of beef stomach, pigs ears, rabbit liver, beef tendon, pigs intestines, durian pudding (nauseous yet?), chicken feet, and more.  A.K.A. a typical weekend when we get together.\\n\\nCraigie fit right in.  So Hannah, Damon, and I hit up Craigie for a mix of reasons; nose to tail dining was definitely one of the biggest ones. \\n\\nI'll admit, I should have written this review sooner because I can't remember all of what we ordered (but I could certainly tell you what I thought if you reminded me of what it was), though I suppose it'd be off the menu anyway...\\n\\nGiven there were 3 of us, and we were def't going to be sharing everything, we wanted a table.  It was a Sunday night, so we figured it wouldn't be too hard to drop in, but we called ahead to make sure, asking if we could make a reservation for 3 in the bar area, they said they didn't take reservations but it should be fine to get a table at the bar space.  \\n\\nWe got there and they said to just get our selves to the bar area, where we did... There were a couple of tables free there, so we sat down at one only to be informed of them being occupied.  We reminded them of our call, but had to sit at the bar anyway.  \\n\\nThankfully I was acquainted with one of the waitresses, who said a table may be opening up soon but we could relax at the bar, muse about our orders, and enjoy our selves with a few drinks in the meantime.\\n\\nI don't know what boutique places like Craigie on Main or No. #9 Park go to to find their bartenders, but they are certainly a special sort (have you _seen_ their anachronistic and well-styled facial hair?). Delightful and masterful, always glib and entertaining; Craigies 'tender is no exception, fashionably or otherwise. \\n\\nAs for the food, I recall that we got the grilled Spanish octopus, pig's ear salad. Hiramasa sashimi, an arctic char entree, the Craigie burger, and bone marrow with crostini, and a couple slices of pie (the chocolate pie and the peanut butter pie).  I am probably leaving something out there, but that is certainly most of it.\\n\\nIt is hot and humid and I don't want to wax food, but needless to say everything was quite good.  The marrow is a particularly good deal, at 10 dollars it is easier and cheaper than doing it your self. The arctic char was one of the more forgettable dishes, wonderfully cooked, but...\\n\\nIt seems like the entrees aren't always the best option, and if you want a variety of food, the money is better spent on their side dishes.\\n\\nThe service was much improved, none of the odd over intensity and inconsistencies of my previous time.\\n\\nI will definitely be back to get the pig head, one of these months, now perhaps a little sooner rather than later. \\n\\nAll in all a good restaurant with some pretty exquisite food, not cheap but some items could certainly be more expensive (others, perhaps a little bit less), unlike any other eating experiences in the area.   This restaurant can fit a whole variety of experiences, from dates, to snacks with friends, and congratulation-style dinners with the family."},{"name":"Chambar","address":"568 Beatty Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Best waffles ever!

The infamous Salt Lick BBQ! Only in Texas would you find this restaurant located all the way out in the middle of nowhere and yet frequented by EVERYONE! This is the Phil's BBQ of Texas and it certainly lived up to its' reputation. \\n\\nI think we came here expecting a lot of things after reading the reviews. (1) there would be at least an hour wait and (2) we would be in BBQ heaven. BUT, to our pleasant suprise, we arrived and didn't have to wait AT ALL! I was wondering if we had the right place until we bit into some delicious brisket and WE KNEW we were definitely in meaty heaven. \\n\\nBetween the two of us, we had the brisket, pork ribs, turkey, sausage, coleslaw, beans and bread! (oinkers, I know). Texas style BBQ seems to be different, more on the dry and smoky side then drenched in sauce and I liked it in its' own right. The brisket and turkey were my favorite. Although the brisket was actually a bit tougher than Augie's BBQ (which, is why Augie's is the winner of the BBQ department IMO--it really is the underdog!), it still held a nice, smokey flavor and the turkey was so moist! The sausage was a bit spicy and had a nice bite to it and the pork ribs, though more dry were still good. \\n\\nThey have jars of their homemade regular and spicy BBQ sauces at the table and more than anything, those stood out. We definitely drenched EVERYTHING in it and spread it on our soft slices of bread as if it were butter. So good. The coleslaw is your standard coleslaw, less mayo and more vinegar and the beans were slightly undercooked.\\n\\nEssentially, we ate so much BBQ, I left Texas with the meat sweats (attractive, I know). I liked Salt Lick but, I was expecting more after reading the reviews..but, did I still contemplate coming back before we had to board our plane?

EVER. So delicious. I'm glad I don't live too close, because I would be back over and over and weigh about 2x as much. \\n\\nI don't usually like BBQ Turkey, but Salt Lick's was moist and superb with whatever smokey sauce was on the table. The brisket was a tiny bit tougher than I would like, but had a smoke ring through the meat almost to the center of the cut, and gorgeous caramelized sauce on the outside. The pork ribs were so tender the meat fell off, leaving a completely bare bone, again with that delicious caramelization on the outside. Potato salad is not your normal (to me, anyway) mayo-y cold side, no, it's a warm, almost cheese-y, onion-y, slightly casserol-ish heap of goodness. Coleslaw is crisp and fresh, with vinegar and sesame, and the baked beans are just plain heaven. There isn't even anything to compare them to; you'll just have to try them! The bread is baked fresh, and so are the cobblers - warm nutmeg peach (my favorite) and a very almondy blackberry. \\n\\nIt's a dry county, so BYOB if you want it - pretty much everyone in sight had a cooler of beer.

But you know, the day is so awesome that you don't even mind!\\n\\nYeah that's kind of how my maiden voyage to Mozart's went, even down the bird pooping incident (I wasn't pooped on but David M. was). My friend David Z recently got a new puppy and we decided to take him down to Red Bud Dog park to enjoy the beautiful weather. After a healthy romp at the dog park we chose to relax and refresh ourselves at Mozart's. \\n\\nTables were in short supply because everyone else had the same game plan as us; they wanted to enjoy the weather. The coffeehouse is dog friendly so I told DZ what I wanted and went to sit down with the pup. The table we sat at had another dog at the immediately adjacent table. He looked like the largest lab I had ever seen, and was named Bruno. Bruno and all the other dogs in the vicinity wanted to meet Atlas (DZ's pup). All of the dogs here seem to be well-mannered and well socialized so it was a great experience for Atlas to socialize. Eventually the crew returned with a diet coke and a cinnamon strawberry turnover for me.\\n\\nDZ had packed a doggie bag for Atlas that had a collapsible bowl and treats in it. I had an extra bottle of water in my purse so we fed Atlas some snacks and water. Around this time, a bird spontaneously pooped on DM but he shrugged it off and our relaxing afternoon continued. Our out of town friends got an orange smoothie and said it was amazing and everyone began pulling out our various tech devices to catch up on life.\\n\\nWhile DZ was feeding Atlas treats, Bruno had managed to crawl under his table and was sitting with his head by my foot begging for petting attention, which I obliged. I decided to start eating my turnover around the same time that DZ started feeding Atlas treats and suddenly Bruno perked up. We mistaken-ed this interest as interest in the treats and after conferring with Bruno's owner we fed him one. I continued to very slowly eat my turnover and suddenly realized that Bruno had perked up because of the turnover, not the treats. His head was now resting on the bench right next to me and he was looking mournfully and hopefully up at my turnover. After googling if dogs could eat strawberries and cinnamon, I fed Atlas a piece of turnover to introduce him to human food (and you know, encourage bad habits because hey, he's not my dog :p). With Bruno's mournful gaze burning a hole into my face and hand I finally asked his owner if he could have some too, she acquiesced. Bruno happily licked my hand and ate his piece of turnover; he also had the softest mouth I've ever felt on a dog. I guess that means that besides being a shameless food beggar he was very well trained :). Regardless, I finished my turnover soon afterwards because after gifting away the corner chunks, I didn't have that much left. Bruno was devastated and moped on the floor like he was dying from heartbreak. \\n\\nAt some point during my engaging food pandering to Bruno, Atlas had grown tired of the sun and had crawled under the table by our feet and was awkwardly licking my ankle; oh doggies, so cute, so awkward. Regardless the sun had started sinking and I was starting to regret my lack of sunglasses and sunblock so we vowed to return again and left the coffee shop.\\n\\nThe great thing about this place? Their baked goods are amazing and delicious. In addition they make stellar coffee offerings. An awesome tip is that they have free refills on the regular and iced coffees which makes this an ideal place for outdoor studying and interacting with friends. The view is beautiful and you're right on the water.

There's no doubt about that.  Here are the positives and negatives as I see them:\\n\\nPositives:\\n1. This sounds like a negative, but it's not.  They don't speak English very well in there. It's just really cool to go to a pizza place where everyone actually speaks Italian - and they certainly speak English well enough to get by.  But if you're looking for a place to practice your Italian, go here.  I just don't know anything beyong \\"grazzi\\".\\n2. The crust is absolutely perfect. Period.\\n3. The consistency of the sauce is my favorite kind - chunky and kind of runny.\\n4. The cheese is delicious. \\n5. The decor is nice, which is surprising to find as you're driving up to it, since it sits right next to a kinda run-down brown brick building.\\n\\nNegatives:\\n1. I personally found that the sauce was a little bit lacking in flavor.  The bites of my margarita pizza that had basil on them were amazing, but when I got bites without basil, I would say it was a teeny bit bland.\\n2. It's LOUD in there.  The music was cranked up so high that I couldn't bear the thought of eating in the room with the big communal table, so Mike and I ate at the bar-type seating up against the front window. \\n3. I am, unfortunately, a soda addict (which I know is my own issue, but I just thought I'd mention this anyway), and they don't have any kind of Coke, Diet Coke, etc. Oh, and no booze. (Gah!!!)  \\n\\nBut I will DEFINITELY go back here.  I might just need to get a pizza with pepperoni or some kind of more flavorful topping(s) next time, and I can live without soda and booze for the duration of one meal.\\n\\nSo there you have it.

Interesting.  OK, let's see!\\n\\nI had a 1/2 bowl of mushroom soup and the blue cheese / fig salad.  Both were magnificent.  I was blown away by how good it, was....it WAS like fine dining food, even though I was staring right at a fountain drink machine in a fast-food atmosphere!\\n\\nThe staff was very friendly, although a tad confused on a couple of points during the ordering process.  It's early days, so I chalked this up to training.\\n\\nThis trip, I got the Asian salad with a 1/2 bowl of chicken vegetable soup.  Both were good, but not as good as the first day.  The salad seemed just a tad less fresh, and the soup just wasn't as yummy as the mushroom one.\\n\\nThey have just gotten an app up and running, so I was offered a $3 off my check if I downloaded the app and paid through it.  Which I did, but then the $3 did not come off the check.  I forgot about that until later, so I just let it go.  The cashier also did not know how to handle checking me out through the app.  I would think that the APP REPRESENTATIVE greeting everyone as they came through the door would have taken care of this. \\n\\nThe tipping situation is beyond ambiguous.  Really?  You suggest a 25% tip when I order at the counter and get my own drink in a plastic cup?  I think not.  I hope those food runners are not getting the shaft.   \\n\\nAnyway, the food is good and I certainly plan to fill up my Loyalty Card.  They have some good looking paninis on that menu, but I doubt I will ever NOT get the mushroom soup again, it was that good.   \\n\\nIt's cold now, but their patio is quite charming with its bright green astroturf, so I plan to enjoy some of their self-pour wine out there when the weather gets nicer.

Because the tasting menu changes often I don't think it's worth reviewing the food but the first two courses contained raw fish and while I'm very adventurous and will try anything, I don't love raw fish/cold soups and for $85 would've preferred to order something else. The food was plentiful though and after 5 courses I was quite full! The last two savory courses were excellent. The desserts were a bit fancy for my tastes but the chocolate dessert was very tasty and I liked how they give two different desserts. I would love to go back and try their famous burger!

Okay... not off to a great start. \\n\\nOnce seated, our waiter greeted us and frankly he was awesome (and is the sole reason my review was elevated to 3 stars). He answered all of our questions about the menu and when asked, offered his recommendations and preferred wine selections. Barcelona Atlanta has a limited late night menu but our waiter took the extra step of querying the kitchen about preparing something that's offered on the regular menu instead (which they had no problem obliging). However, we asked for this exception in the first place because we found the late night menu to be very limiting in its variety.\\n\\nThe food itself is very good, flavorful, well prepared, and well presented. As with any tapas restaurant, you expect small portions and to order numerous dishes but I found Barcelona Atlanta to be a little on the expensive side thus if you're wanting a true tapas experience, be prepared to spend a lot of money. \\n\\nOverall, Barcelona Atlanta provides a grown and laid back environment (which would be a great first date place!) so I'd be willing to give it another try."},{"name":"Lisbon Portuguese","address":"8441 International Dr, Ste 280","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"This is a pearl!

Keep this is mind if you feel included to go to Craigie. \\n\\nAs far as the price is concerned, Kyla countered that they use local fresh ingredients, like this even begins to vindicate the price. Plenty of restaurants use fresh local ingredients and don't charge over $50 a plate. Bondir (also a 10 minute walk from Craigie) bases their entire system on using fresh local sustainable ingredients only and their entrees do not exceed $30. So obviously, using the \\"fresh local\\" excuse to explain a $220 dinner is ridiculous.\\n\\nKyla offered us a complete refund and we took it. Now that is GREAT customer service, and we are very grateful to her for that.

Our table agreed it was the best we'd ever had -- and promptly ordered a second helping. The foie came with this truffled brioche that was a little too oily for me (butohmygoshsogood) and a lovely granita. The tapas with saffron prawns and grilled with navy beans was great. I loved the beans -- they were cooked so perfectly. Mixed with a tamarind chutney and sweet pepper salad, this was a highlight of the meal for me. I could have stopped with appetizers and been so pleased. \\n\\nWe moved on to the main dishes where I had ordered the moules frites en vin blanc. I found the mussels to be pretty lackluster, I hate to say. For great mussels in this city, I have to turn to Flying Pig who consistently has the best broth and the largest mussels. Chambar sadly fell short on the mussels, and my friend who had the moules frites with coquotte sauce wholly agreed with my sentiment. The fries were okay but I didn't finish them, and if you know me, I don't ever not finish a potato product. That's just...sacrilege.

Each one deserves a description.\\n\\nTortilla de Patata (Potato tortilla) - these can be tricky.  I've tried a number where they were dry inside.  This one was just right - moist & fluffy.\\nSmoked Duck Sausage - comes with 3 sliced pieces, a soft boiled egg, and large croutons.  Slice open the egg and dip the sausage in the yolk.  So good.\\nFois Gras Terrine (w/ fig strawberry puree, pistachio bits, & a small glass of Amontillado Pedro Romero) - fois gras is really hit or miss.  This was a very good example of how to do fois gras.  And the puree mixed with pistachio was heaven.  I don't drink, so the Amontillado went untouched.  But from its fragrance, it is an excellent pairing to the fois gras and puree.\\n\\nFor dessert we had the Poached GA Peach with a cream cheese creme anglaise and pecan brittle.  Good doesn't even come close to describe this dessert.  I was bordering on getting the standard (flan) for dessert, but I'm so glad we went with the peach.  So, so delicious.\\n\\nThe service was absolutely top notch.  From the attentiveness of our 2 servers, to the suggestions offered, to the relaxed pace... just excellent.\\n\\nThe wine list - As I mentioned above, I don't drink.

I already knew to expect a wait so I wasn't surprised by the sea of people. \\n\\nWe got in the line to get a buzzer, it went quickly maybe a 5 minute wait even though there were possibly 30 people ahead of us - we were told the wait was 2.5 hours. That was fine for some in our group but not for others so we decided to get in line for the to go food to get a snack while we waited.\\n\\nSo the outdoor area has a ton of picnic tables anyone can sit at while they wait, and the to go section where you get your food almost instantly and can take it to said tables, there was live music and the best part is its BYOB so don't forget to buy extra bottles after wine tasting in the area (the winery we went to opened our bottles and recorked them for us so we could enjoy at salt lick.) \\n\\nWe waited in the to go line for about 10 minutes and our food was done as quickly as we had ordered, we took it over to the picnic tables and listened to the live band. After about 40 more minutes our buzzer rang! (Less than an hour into what we were told would be a 2.5 hour wait.) \\n\\nWe went into the main dining room (armed with more bottles of byob wine) you walk past the pits which is cool and a great photo op and then took a table inside. They have an all you can eat platter for $25, if you finish and are full order another plate you can take it to go. Half our party was full from eating outside so they got a platter of cobbler to take home. \\n\\nOk so - the food. Beyond basic BBQ. Really disappointing after trying La BBQ and some others in Austin. The brisket was dry and tasted like t has been pre sliced hours ago, the pork ribs were the best thing we had and they were good but not amazing or fall off the bone. The beef ribs were sooooo chewy and mostly bone little meat. \\nI will say almost everything leftover tasted better heated up 2 days later.\\n\\nSo, would I return to the salt lick? I would def go wine tasting in the area and it's a cool experience for out of towners, id probably go again because it was fun but not as much for the food. \\nIf the wait is crazy long just order the to go and eat outside.

My DIL ordered chowder-also lukewarm. My son ordered the pork chop which was very thick and may be the reason our food was not hot (long time to cook).

Maybe saw her 4 times the whole night. Didn't offer drink refills or anything. \\nI ordered the baja combination plate: 1 shrimp taco, 1 fish taco, and 4 small slices of a goat cheese and spinach quesadilla. This was $18 on the menu and while I feel that the quesadilla was good, the two small tacos were OK. I definitely feel that it was tiny for the price. \\nThe guac was AMAZING. So much flavor! And we only got the mild! \\nWas given a free margarita on the rocks just by checking in on yelp. It was like drinking tequila and water. It was too strong. If I wanted a shot, I would have ordered one. But hey, it was free, so I can't complain too much. Restaurant was pretty loud, also. I LOVED the lighting, though.

The food was less than mediocre. I've had better tapas AND a better tapas experience at Eclipse di Luna and Cafe Tu Tu Tango. I just wasn't impressed... half of our tapas were lukewarm/cold on the inside which was disappointing AND at the end of the night when we paid our $60 bill for two..we felt like we'd been bamboozled out of our good ole disposable income. Definitely too pricey for what you get.\\n\\nLook, I didn't mind the vibe of the place. If I went back it would be for drinks with my girls and to look cute, but not for the food.

I was able to order a Spicy Crispy Chicken String Bean sauteed dish with chicken which was only ten dollars. The portion size was so huge that I had to take almost all of it home. I really liked the sauce too. The food was decent, I really liked the crisp green beans (super picky about them being crisp and not soft) and their long menu.\\n\\nThe service wasnt that great. The waitress greeted us so warmly and was so sweet but then she only checked on us once after that and we had to ask another waiter for a to-go box. I also noticed that the other waiters were really diligent to their tables, checking often, but stopping as soon as they got to us, even though we were doing the desperate eyes for help.

Generally I either get the half-chicken or a piece of fish, with the grilled zucchini side. I've tried both the fish tacos (tasty!) and the shrimp-and-grits and have liked them both. I've also ordered take-out from Boneheads and the food arrives relatively hot, fresh and quickly.\\n\\nI think they do a good job on the grilled fish - the chicken has been slightly inconsistent, sometimes over/under-done but still very passable. I usually pull off the skin then add more piri piri - love the flavors in that stuff. I pass on most of the sides (have had the salad, the Asian slaw and a citrus salsa - all were passable but be careful of the cilantro if that's not your flavor). \\n\\nI think they do the best job on the salmon and tuna - haven't had very good luck on the mahi (tends to be dry). Also, the portabella sandwich was tasty if you're looking for a veggie option.\\n\\nParking is off the \\"street\\" that flows between this large complex's buildings and can be a bit of a challenge. There are many spaces across the street and behind that building, in front of the bank - there's also a deck in the back corner near Outback Steakhouse if you don't mind walking.

This review is based on my most recent trip back to saltlick on March 18th 2018. We actually went there twice that weekend. First was for a rehearsal dinner and second was when we are ready to head back to Houston. Why go twice in a trip if it ain't good you would  ask ? Well, We barely ate anything at the rehearsal dinner as we were the photographer (Mainly because I'm just assisting the hubby). That's the only reason why we went back on Sunday. Anyways, we both got all you can eat and you get to sample brisket, ribs, turkey, sausage. We got everything except turkey, not a fan of turkey so I'm not wasting no space on turkey. I used to love their ribs but this time, I wasn't impressed. I feel like the quality and the taste of food had gone down hill. I also want to retract the statement I made about saltlick being better than Franklin's BBQ. Frankin is actually the best BBQ I have ever had in my life so far. Saltlick takes the Cake for being the best value BBQ. I mean you can't beat all you can eat BBQ for that price !

Which was a problem since our order wasn't correct. I was also particularly annoyed because my coffee came with no sugar or cream, nor was there any to be found on the table.

If they're going to run two registers at once, they need to make two lines or provide people more direction. \\n\\nThe service -- Sometimes the staff can be a bit short with you or ignore you completely. Sometimes they call out drink orders and sometimes you end up with a melted espresso shake. I think they could benefit from the perkiness that a good espresso shot can provide. \\n\\nHowever, the view is beautiful and when it's not packed to the gills with UT students, it's a very pleasant to end an evening just staring out into the lake. There's a dog friendly patio and even though I don't have a dog, they're pretty cute to look at. Live music is often good too. \\n\\n I'm a fan of the caramel espresso shake when I have to get stuff done and really need that sugary boost.

(I believe it's the same menu as dinner.) I had heard how stylish and old world it was - something about the owners being attracted to places where old Italian men like to eat when on the journey that inspired Luce - but arrived to find a very stark, cold and charmless storefront restaurant on a still unappealing section of East Burnside. They had some nice specialty grocery items on the shelves and some other precious home goods in a beautiful antique counter display, but honestly that sort of thing reminds me of Starbucks or chain restaurants.\\nWe ordered a few $2 antipasti selections and a glass each of the house red and white. And then waited for almost five minutes for the wine and at least fifteen minutes for the first course. The house red was bad. I don't have high expectations for house wines, but in a restaurant designed and reputed to be about old world simplicity, I expect a decent tasting table wine. Of the antipasti, the carrot and leek tartine was perfect, the chicken liver pate on crostini was pretty good (though the crostini tasted as if it had just been pulled from a fridge), the beets were good and there was another pate thing on crostini that was simply bad.\\nOnto the main course after another fairly long wait. My wife had the winter vegetable stew over polenta. It was very good. The polenta was excellent - fresh and light with a savory nutty flavor. I had a half-order of the spaghetti and added the clams for $2. My dish was flavorful but a little flat overall. \\nWe wanted to try the Luce cake and have some coffee, but we had already been there over an hour, which is kind of a long time for casual lunch. And every time the door opened a gust of cold air gave us another chill. So we got the check and left. It wasn't until I got the bill, paid it and walked out that the disappointment of the experience made itself abundantly clear. I think it's fair to want to walk away from a $50 lunch feeling satisfied. My dissatisfaction kind of grew from there. An hour later I was feeling as if I hadn't had lunch at all. Maybe they'll figure it out. Maybe they won't. Either way, we won't be back."},{"name":"Stats","address":"300 Marietta St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Went here after hitting up the aquarium yesterday as it is close by.

My spidey sense heard some pool balls being smacked together so they must have at least one pool table behind the main screen too. We started off with the $3 cheese sticks which are actually cheese bread. We got a lot of it for only 3 bucks. We couldn't even finish them all. My wife had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich and added on some buffalo potato chips. The potato chips were basically thick potatoes slices that were fried. She really liked here sandwich. I tasted the chips and they were good, but perhaps the small fries at $2 (compared to $4) maybe a better value. I had the chicken fried steak and mashed potatoes. It was huge and tasty. Though after the cheese bread, I couldn't even finish it which is rare for me. I love me some CFS. The potatoes were good too and had little pieces of skin in them which I like. The service was pretty good, but didn't blow us away. Before the meal was served, I looked at the back of the menu. KNIGHTS OF COLUMBUS! I thought. There were 32 Texas beers listed on draft. It seemed like most of them were from right here in Austin. There are not too many places where you can get Jester King Commercial Suicide Oaked Dark Mild on draft, but this is one of them. Ask for local oak aged beer at Chili's. I dare you... :-) I actually studied the beer list for at least 5 minutes. Most beers had their alcohol content and IBU (International Bitterness Units) listed. That's what I call attention to detail. Unfortunately, I was too full to try any of the beers, but like I said. I love me some chicken fried steak and I love local beer even more. That guarantees that I be making a return trip. So stop by and get a local brew.

He says that when I taste the fritters, I will think I have died and gone to heaven, so I expect nothing less. The appetizers are served, and I am over the moon tasting the crunchy, savory goat cheese fritters topped with melted honey.

This is so much fun! We order our entres, and I have the bratwurst and kraut. To be honest, the entre was unremarkable, but the seasoned fries that I ordered as a side were phenomenal!

Weekend reservations require planning far in advance so the few times I tried to check this place out, it was too late to secure a table. I personally feel that Cragie is something that you should experience on a weekend, simply because those are the best nights. Although the ambiance itself is not fancy, it is more of a celebratory atmosphere. Google describes it as a \\"high-end restaurant with innovative, French-inspired locavore fare and seasonal tasting menu.\\" When a restaurant is that hyped up, it can be a blessing and a curse at the same time. A blessing because customers are going to go \\"all out\\" considering they had to wait months to get a table. It creates a buzz and you feel kinda special when you finally get that prime time reservation. It can also be a curse because expectations are going to be sky high. For the restaurant business, making lots of mula is their primary interest as that is the foundation of remaining lucrative and in business. Most people are happy with just average so most of these types of places don't go above and beyond to have the best quality food and service. I would say Cragie on Main fits right into this category. Now let's get to the good stuff.\\n\\nThe Deets: For appetizers, I tried the oysters and the octopus. The oysters were dressed uniquely and were fresh on point. We found it odd that the server did not know exactly where they were harvested. Cape Cod is a large area and as an oyster connoisseur, it would be nice to know if I am slurping a Wellfleet or a Chatham. The octopus was my favorite dish as it was cooked to perfection and the kale and almonds added a nice crunch. Overcooked octopus can be almost as bad as overcooked chicken breast and it is SO easy to make that mistake. A couple of my friends tried the pork three ways and I could see the disappointment in their eyes as they took their first bites. I can't comment beyond that as pork is not my cup of tea (unless its bacon of course). For my main course, I had the Maine Dayboat Sea Scallops, which I would describe as \\"good.\\" Yes that is a boring word choice for an avid Yelp reviewer and trendy French restaurant but it gets the point across that it was nothing special. I would even go as far as to say the scallop dish I prepare at home with a roasted red pepper sauce is tastier than the dish at Cragie on Main. On snap, watch out Chef Tony Maws, Kiki P is on the hunt for your gig. \\n\\nOverall, I can't say that I was impressed by the cuisine, service and ambiance at Cragie on Main. At the same time, I wouldn't say that I was disappointed. I found everything about the restaurant to be average. The quality of food was good and I enjoyed all of the dishes that I tried. The desserts were along the same lines but nothing unique or special. As for value, this place averages to at least $100/person if you do the 3-course prix-fixe with 1 drink. I understand the dining landscape of the city of Boston fairly well and I can confidently say that I could have had a similar meal with the same level of satisfaction for about half the price. Cragie on Main is a solid restaurant but I don't see the value in being a frequent visitor at the establishment."},{"name":"Surly Girl Saloon","address":"1126 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"I can only chalk up the complaints about the decor being \\"too dark\\" or \\"creepy\\" to mean that the yelper writing them, is doing so from a Laura Ashley sweater in straightville.

She seemed to be glad to wait on her other tables. When my friend and I mentioned we were waiting on two others to arrive she didn't even ask if we wanted to order starters while we waited.

I actually hadn't heard of it before this evening, but I love Indian food and I'm always down to try somewhere I've never been. Walking in, my first impression was that I was in for an intimate meal with my friend. The dining room is small and the lighting is rather dim; due to the size of the dining room, it was a little loud, but that wasn't a deterrent. \\n\\nWe ordered a round of the vegetable samosas, which I REALLY enjoyed. Those alone would earn four stars from me. I love spice and there is quite a bit to these in comparison to nearly every other samosa that I've had in town. For my meal, I ordered the Malvani coconut lamb curry, which is marked as being spicy and \\"too authentic.\\" I'm not speaking from an \\"oh, I can handle spice, the more the better\\" place when I say this, but this was not spicy AT ALL. It was like I was given a really watery lamb stew without vegetables. The chunks of lamb are quite large and the broth is flavorful, but there's not anything spicy here. The rice doesn't really mesh well with the broth because the broth is just too watery. That said, it's still pretty okay. The garlic naan that I ordered with it was a little burnt and the charring seemed to kill any garlic flavor that might have been present. My friend ordered the lamb korma, which had a really delicious broth. \\n\\nI had a few little issues throughout the meal. Between our two dishes, we were given one small bowl of rice. I don't know if we could have asked for more or what have you, but both dishes are marked as being served with rice so my usual understanding would be that we would each be given our own. The serving sizes were pretty small considering the pricing. The upside consideration here is that you won't be overeating here. The downside consideration is that if you go to most any other Indian food place of a comparable price point, you'd be leaving with enough leftovers for another meal or two. The service, while friendly, was a tad slow. It was a packed house, yes, but they seemed more than adequately staffed so I was a little puzzled about that aspect. Our meals arrived separately with enough of a gap between them for me to take note. \\n\\nOverall, I can't say it's on my list of places I have to go back to. Some aspects could have been remedied had we spoken up, but outside of the samosas nothing food related was good enough to seem like there would have been much of a difference.

Both kinds of tortillas were okay but not great and the size was small, smaller and inconsistent.\\n The regular garnish of onions and cilantro is provided on the counter along with salsas that were good at best. \\n Jazz's Bang vs. Buck scale fell flat due to the random size that seemed based on the small side even though the price was low at only a single $. \\n All things considered, we had to give La Hacienda a flat C. The small and inconsistent size ultimately did them in. If you've got a different opinion we'd love to hear about it because there's a lot of potential there, but neither of us are planning a return trip at this point.\\n\\n#TacoQuest2016, #TheTACOnnoisseurs, #Bestfoodaustin, #TacoTuesday, #AustinTacos,#Tacos, #texmonthly\\n\\n@Caruso4510, @Jazzone"},{"name":"Tandoor Indian  Kitchen","address":"406 SW Oak St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"What a funny place.

(Didn't get any cheese, so can't say anything about that.) Their meats are really flavorful and you really need to eat them on their own or with plain bread to get the full taste of it. (Don't eat it with the mustard, though the mustard is tasty too.) I liked the smoked cold Prosciutto the best. The pickles were awesome as well, with a very slight tinge of sour, but mainly it was the sweet flavor that got me hooked. Too bad they only give you so little.\\n\\nAnother great dish was the grilled octopus. One tenticle comes with all these garnishes. Loved the hint of charred ocean. A must get!\\n\\nWe also got the SP Pork Tasting, which came with loin, belly and shoulder meats. This dish wasn't so spectacular. The meat was cooked skillfully, but far from perfection, as you'd expect from such a meat lover's type of place. Next time we come, I think we'd try a pizza, which the table next to us ordered and looked rather enticing.\\n\\nOne thing that creeped me out a bit was their use of old menu papers to line the bread \\"baskets\\" (tins really). I know the papers were encased in these menu \\"folders\\" when they were being used, but still, who knows where that paper's been? No complaints about their delicious rosemary bread though.\\n\\nThe decor in this place is really wonderful. High ceilings, interesting furnishings and an open kitchen to stare into. The servers are also super friendly and helpful in explaining how things work there, since the menu can be a bit confusing (basically, everything's a la carte)."},{"name":"Antico Pizza","address":"1093 Hemphill Ave NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Hands down some of the best pizza I've ever had.
