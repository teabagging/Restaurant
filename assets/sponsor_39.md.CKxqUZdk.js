I don't think she was just saying this... she seemed sincere and after I tasted the pizza--oh my goodness--I'm not sure that anything could be much better.\\n\\nConfession: as a restaurant geek, I did a lot of research before eating here. I even watched the YouTube videos of the grand opening and interviews with the restaurant executives. The tomatoes are imported from Italy. The mozzarella is handmade. The water used to make the crust is from a well in New York that has identical alkaline content as the renowned wells in Naples. These people take their pizza seriously. And, yes, you do pay for it--a $27 for a large.  A large pizza is more than enough for two people, so you figure it's actually less than $15/person.

It isn't a classy joint by anymeans, you order at the counter and will be called up when your food is ready. They have given this place a overhaul but it still isn't a classy place.. more like a sit down casual place to eat quick and get out ( Guys if you're trying to impress a date.. I wouldn't bring her here until after a few dates lol) The prices are pretty low about $7-$8 per entree as I remember. The place is located across the street from Patel Brothers and Mirch Masala( which I do have a review for as well) I loveveeeeeee their chicken tikka masala, paneer tikka masala, gobi manchurian (although it was a bit different then I am used to) their nan is good as well.  Try going there for dinner and you will be out of $20 max for two people (2 entrees and breads/maybe rice).. FYI when you ask the people to make your dish spicy they actually listen.  I find it funny though that all the workers in the kitchen that I have seen are mexican (weird) but I guess that's common for most indian establishments as well as others and by no means am I racist at all.

The parking situation is really bad. There are only 2 businesses open in this area right now and it was very difficult to park. You can't park in the garages because they are for residents and the retail parking was packed. Many of my friends had to park pretty far and even that took them some time to find. \\nWhen I got in the place it was nice inside. I spoke with the server about seating and she said that the outside patio was a smoking area. I chose inside because I am not a smoker and don't like second hand smoke. The interior was nice and nicely air-conditioned, much appreciated on a hot and humid day.\\nOnce my friends arrived the problems started. At 6:00 the employees opened the large garage door style roll up windows that are the majority of the walls on two sides. Well, that was the end of the air conditioning and the end of any non-smoking area. The bar quickly became hot and humid, very uncomfortable. It also filled with the smell of smoke from the patio, since now the patio was part of the restaurant itself with no seperation between smoking and non-smoking areas. I talked to a waitress about this and she shrugged and said that is how the business operates every night. They always do this. \\nThe food wasn't bad. A little pricey but reasonable with the happy hour specials. We had martinis and several appetizers and they were good. Our waitress was very attentive too. I think we would have stayed for dinner but since we were literally sweating through our clothes, we decided it was time to go home. \\nBased on this model of no true non-smoking area and lack of air conditioning on top of the parking issue I don't think I will be back to Bar Louie.

This place is truly a hidden jem that transports you across the pond as you step through the front doors and into a beautifully lit and quaintly decorated restaurant that is warm and inviting. As someone with sensitive ears and an aversion to loud restaurants with echoing terrible music, I really appreciate the acoustics of the place. I love that I've been there when it's nearly a full house and I can still have a normal volume conversation across the table. Makes for a much more enjoyable experience.

I haven't had something that hasn't made my mouth water before during and after eating it. They have a wonderful Prefix menu that is a great value and is no less delicious or creative than their main menu which will also knock your socks off. I've had steak twice and the lamb pops and both are absolutely perfectly done. Inspires me to get creative in my own kitchen! \\nOh and the bread. These guys absolutely understand the importance of bread and they keep it coming throughout the meal. Warm, fresh, crispy on the outside, soft on the inside baguettes that are perfect with butter, duck liver mousse pate, and red wine or to soak up ever last bit of flavor on your dinner plate. \\n\\nLastly the service is easily the best in town. A welcoming, knowledgeable staff that takes care of your every need before you even notice you need it.

So, while shorts and T-shirt is OK for here, make sure you cover your feet.\\n\\nWe were seated in the center of the place where we could see the cooking going on and all the intricate decor, and our waiter was extremely attentive and took all the time we needed recommending various dishes as well as the best wine pairings to go with them.  Since we were using the dining plan, our orders were as varied as we could make them, and everything we got was cooked perfectly, appealing in its presentation, and had just the right balance of savory herbs to it.  Boar and steak were tender, every bit of salad crispy, washed well, and refreshing, and mashed potato sides smooth and creamy.  Even the artisan cheese plate was fresh and appealing.\\n\\nOf particular note is that even though the Truffle Mac & Cheese is no longer on the menu, they will still make it for you if you ask for it...something I did not know before having a conversation with a stranger while waiting in line for Expedition Everest.  And it was VERY worth it...yummy!\\n\\nOf course, if you're not on the dining plan you will be paying quite the pretty penny to eat here, easily over $100 a person, especially if you add wine, which I do recommend.  But if you're only going to indulge one place for a meal, this is where you want to do it."},{"name":"Trudy's North Star","address":"8820 Burnet Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Sit at the bar and get delicious green salsa!

But their sauce is amazing!  I love their Mediterranean chicken salad, their spicy Italian pizza, their Arrivederci salad (fresh fruit and feta - yum!), their bruschettas, the angel hair pesto pasta... on and on.  And I didn't even mention dessert - chocolate lava cake, lemoncello something or other, Spanish coffee... Speaking of that, they have an excellent wine selection as well as a full bar. I'm always happy with the Zinfandel and especially the Mourvedre.\\n\\nAnd about that live music - they hire terrific bands.  I'm not talking about us, but about all the other truly wonderful bands, both instrumental and vocal, that you can't get in one place otherwise.  Our band is in about every 4-6 weeks and in between, I go in on my own and with friends to be inspired and moved by the great grooves and styles of the other bands.  The musicians too become a family, supporting and not competing with each other.

Boma is a buffet filled with many African culinary delights. It is quite vegetarian friendly, while still offering many choices for the meat eaters. You will find soups, stews, salads, breads, meats, chicken, salmon, hummus and so much more. There is also a lovely little dessert section. Is it worth the high dollar price tag? I don't think so. I look forward to trying it for breakfast in the future. Our server Paul was quite helpful and informative, as we were dining on the dining plan.

Main course was buckets of fried chicken and BBQ ribs. The chicken lacked flavor but the ribs were pretty yummy with just even bbq sauce. Sides included mashed potatoes, corn ( which I thought it was suppose to be a mixed veggie) and cowboy beans. The cowboy beans were good, made with bacon so not for those who don't eat pork. The dessert was a strawberry short cake like I've never seen. It was basically two huge slices of short cake with whipped cream in between and then showered with strawberry sauce and strawberries... it was delicious.

The rabbit parpadelle was magnificent. Yum Yum Yum. And make a reservation. \\n\\nLong version: I found myself in Salem for a wedding rehearsal (photographing the actual event tomorrow at Hamilton Hall) and figured dinner might be in order. Facebook friends suggested 62 and the Yelp reviews seemed pretty awesome. \\n\\nI called for a reservation for 2 and they only had 8:30pm available. I explained that I would be finished around 5:30 and needed an early night and maybe they could call if anyone cancelled. They were super nice on the phone and said they had a table at 5:30 but they needed it for 7pm so it probably wouldn't work. I was all over it :) Don't get me wrong - if I made a regular reservation and was hurried along I would be pissed but they were totally flexible in fitting around my schedule. \\n\\nThe rehearsal ran a little late and so I got there around 5:40, my Mom was waiting for me at the bar where she'd enjoyed some kind of cocktail. The host (owner? manager?) was the same guy I spoke to on the phone and so I thanked them for fitting us in and assured them we'd be done by 7. She lives in the UK and isn't so familiar with the US tipping policy and so just headed over to our table assuming that her drink would be put on our dinner tab. More on that later. \\n\\nOur server was awesome. Really knowledgeable and gave us some great recommendations. We ordered a really great bottle of NZ Sauvignon Blanc (the name escapes me - very gooseberry like/perfect on a hot day). We started with the Arugula Salad (with manchego and prosciutto) - one of the best arugula salads I've ever eaten (and I've eaten a lot). The Tuna appetizer was phenomenal. 4 generous sashimi style slices with slivers of roasted garlic and some kind of hot pepper. Super fresh. Went well with the arugula. Our server also brought a little surprise of crostini with fresh ricotta and green beans as a thank you for us being so flexible on the time :)\\n\\nWe got two pasta dishes (they come in half-sizes or full). The pea agniolotti (spelling?!?) was great, hint of mint and perfectly crisp and tasty panchetta. Not super truffley which I liked. I'd give it 8.5 out of 10. The rabbit parpadelle pasta was historic. Amazing. Perfectly cooked pasta, just the right amount of sauce, generous meat, white wine and rosemary in the sauce. Totally great. \\n\\nWe weren't rushed at all, in fact my Mom had an espresso (which she raved about) and we were still done by 6:45 ish. Really really great dinner. \\n\\nAs we got our check ($90ish for 2 appetizers, 2 pastas, bottle of wine, soda and espresso) I noticed my Mom's drink wasn't on it. I checked and the host was all \\"no problem, we've got it\\" which was very kind (don't worry, we left a good tip at the bar - I've done my fair share of barwork in the past ;)\\n\\nI parked in the garage on the corner - bring some quarters (no credit card/dollar bills) 25c for every 30 minutes\\n\\nSo if you're still reading 62 is a HUGE hit for me.

I think a nice privacy fence around the outside eating area and a fire pit would really go a long way to making the outside area much more cozy as opposed to the open, exposed feel it has now.\\n\\nDrinks took a little longer than expected to arrive based on the number of customers, but we hardly noticed. A nice thing about the Depot, compared to some other places in town, is that it's not too loud, and it's easy to have a great conversation without shouting \\"WHAT?!\\" every few minutes.\\n\\nThe menu has a very large selection.  A little bit of everything someone said. We ordered food and again, it took a few minutes longer than expected, but barely noticeable.\\n\\nI had the Cajun Chicken sandwich. Very tasty but very spicy! I loved it but it was too spicy for most of the people at the table. The jalapenos put it over the top. I'd get it again, but I needed extra water.\\n\\nThere were a few burgers on the table that ranged from delicious, to overcooked, and a spinach salad that was plain and simple but good.\\n\\nThe best deal at our table was the Pizza of the Day. That got rave reviews and for $9.50 (that day) it could have fed two of us easily. Fresh ingredients and delicious.\\n\\nWe'll definitely try the Depot again."},{"name":"Yellowbird Chicken","address":"239 Grove St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Hot dang!

And one side of the restaurant is a full on bar crowded w people.

I've had better charcuterie plates before. They do give you a lot of meat but I would have preferred a combo of meat/cheese for the price (instead of having to order a charcuterie & cheese plate separately). \\n\\nOctopus (2/5) it was ok. The octopus needed more char. I mean it tasted like something I could have just broiled and I don't even cook. The accompanying mango-ish sauce was ok but it didn't make the octopus any more tastier. It's was just there. \\n\\nBrussel Sprouts (3/5) it was probably my favorite dish of the night and that doesn't say much. It was good but I've had way better brussel sprouts elsewhere. \\n\\nRabbit w Potato (3/5) it was just ok. I really don't even remember what the rabbit tasted like. I do remember the potatoes being somewhat good though... \\n\\nScallops (3/5) again just ok. \\n\\nHonestly as you can tell from my review everything was just ok and not very memorable.

I'm not real fond of most of Quizno's sauces, and so most of the sandwich shops do nothing for me.\\n\\nPotbelly, though, I love. For less than five bucks I get a good selection of meats, good bread, all toasted and tasty. I also really like their toasted PB&J.

Which was very surprising seeing how there was more than 6 other groups waiting for a table, in which were quickly seated. The food, was alright. Presentation on the other hand was very delightful. We checked in on yelp, so we were able to get a free appetizer, the Chili Calamari. Calamari is one of our favorites appetizers, so we were super disappointed in the lack of flavor, and the actual meats of the calamari. Not only that it already cooled off before it got to us, which was only about five minutes after we ordered but it also lacked a crispy outer tempura flavor. Our second appetizer was the pork belly+panko apple steamed buns, which was extremely tasteful. It was different then other pork buns we've had, but the spicy mayonnaise and extra siracha was a nice touch! The only downside is that it only came with one bun, and if you've eaten them at other places, they're usually serves in pairs. So one bun for almost 6 dollars, was not worth it. Our main entrees were Chili Beef Ramen, and the Miso Beef Ramen. Both were extremely tasteful, and definitely fulfilled our cravings for ramen. The Chili Beef Ramen, came out with medium rare steak, which was perfect because we don't like it when our steak comes out well done. The soup broths in the miso Beef Ramen I'd have to say was significantly more flavorful than the chili beef.

We got there and there's a huge line to check in, didn't bother me until I realized there's another heavily trafficked line to step into the castle. I don't really see how having reservations makes it better when I witnessed some people do walk-ins at the check in booth. We got to take in the beautifully decorated castle as we slowly made our way in and then got to order and pay for our meal with some type of kiosk & staff member. Then after that, we got to pick our seat, we chose the grand ballroom as we wandered through the three rooms available which were congested with people and crew members cleaning up and serving food from their little carts. The whole experience just reminded me of a cafeteria except they just bring out your food in their carts. The food was just ok, nothing really special whatsoever. The only cool thing about everything is the experience, I took lots of photographs in and around the castle and felt like I was in the real life animation minus all the people and the mediocre food.

I didn't order the flight, but I loved that it came in what looked like a miniature wooden milk crate. \\n\\nWe split a plate of the pulled pork nachos, which came with a heavenly side of Happy Sol BBQ sauce for dipping, a lovely salad that included pears, blue cheese, sunflower seeds, and cranberries, and the tater tots, which were accompanied by chipotle ketchup which I could have just drank straight from the container.  We are excited to sample the extensive charcuterie selection on our next visit.  \\n\\nThe servers are friendly and knowledgeable, and vibe is convivial.  Even on a Wednesday night, the place was lively and hopping!\\n\\nYou may look at the location and think it's too far off the beaten path, but really, whether you're driving or taking the T it's really easy to get to.

Yes, this restaurant is ridiculously crowded (long wait times, always).  But, I can look past these things if the food/drinks are good... unfortunately for this Trudy's, everything seems to be a little off.  Trudy's is not really known for their awesome food in general (they ARE known for their drinks, but I'll get to that), but the food at this location seems to be especially unappealing (tasteless, burned or over-salted).\\n\\nI have been to other locations (namely the location near campus, but I had also been to the one down south) and I always loved their mexican martinis.  The mexican martinis I have gotten at this location have just been flat-out terrible (wayyyyy too much mix, and the mix is not tasty).  Even when I asked for an upgrade from the house tequila to top shelf, the drink was just nasty (and expensive).  I have never had this problem at the other Trudy's locations.  \\n\\nMy friends love to meet here because of the good location, but I can't say that I always enjoy the food/drinks, just the company.

The food was, without a doubt, some of the best I've ever had. I thought Seattle had the best seafood until I ate here. The Maine Lobster Tail was without equal. The Filet Mignon was perfectly done and had a wonderful flavor to it. I usually drown it in Bearnaise sauce but ate it plain this time as the naturally flavor was just too wonderful. And the Crab-Stuffed Mushrooms were simply exquisite!\\n\\nThe only downside to this place (and thus only 4 stars) was the long wait for a table. We had the grandparents with us and requested a first-floor table, but we had made a reservation earlier in the day and still had to wait for over an hour before we got to our table. Of course, we sat in the bar and had drinks and some fresh-made deep-fried potato chips (very yummy).

On average, maki rolls are anywhere between $3-$6, and deluxe rolls range from $6-$18. I usually spend a good $25-$30 every time I go for a sushi binge. In Vancouver, that would never be the case unless I plan on eating for two (which is totally possible, by the way.) Sushi in Vancouver is delicious and so affordable, unlike everything else there. \\n\\nOn my last day of my trip, I figure I need to get in as much raw fish as possible in hopes of getting mercury poisoning. I'm obviously joking, but trying to make a point that I wanted to inhale as much sushi to last me until my next trip to Vancouver. So! My boyfriend recommended just going to an all you can eat place (AYCE). We had a few choices, but ended up here since it was in the most convenient location. It's $20 for AYCE before 9:30pm, and drops down to $13 after 9:30pm. We got seated as soon as we walked in, and water and wasabi was already sitting on the table before we arrived. They never gave us any ginger though. Anyway, we ordered several rolls. My favorite ones were the special house roll and the BC roll. What are in those rolls you ask? I couldn't even tell you. But if you trust me (which you shouldn't) I recommend those. I also got the pot stickers (Too mushy), the plain udon, yam tempura, short ribs (so yummy), and mango pudding (I didn't like it, but my boyfriend scarfed it down before I could even notice he ate mine too.)\\n\\nThe reason I only gave this place 3 stars is for these reasons:\\n\\n1. The sushi is just mediocre. It was definitely the least appetizing raw fish I've had while in Vancouver.\\n\\n2. The server spilled my soy sauce while placing our sushi on the table. No, I don't care that he spilled it. I only care that he just said \\"My bad\\" and never came back with a towel to wipe down the table. Instead, we had to use all the napkins on our table to clean it off. We set down the soaking soy sauce filled napkin at the end of the table for them to pick up, but they never did. Only stared at it and walked away.\\n\\n3. We asked our server which roll was which, and he didn't know what any of them were. \\n\\nBut! The pros are:\\n\\n1. They were playing late night hockey news on all of the TV's. \\n\\n2. They gave us a pitcher of cold water so we could just refill ourselves.\\n\\n3. Sushi orders came out incredibly fast. We never had to wait more than 10 minutes to get our food. \\n\\nI don't know if I'd ever feel the need to come back, but I do recommend this place if you're looking for a place for some cheap food and drinks!"},{"name":"Somerville Brewing Co","address":"15 Ward St","city":"Somerville","stars":"3.5","text":"Typical warehouse brewery atmosphere with a limited, but good selection of beers.

Unfortunately, that was the only thing I enjoyed at the restaurant. There were 14 people attending the celebration and the restaurant could not accommodate us at one table, we had to sit in side-by-side booths. Needless to say, it was challenging to converse with our friends at the other booth. The food was sub-par, at best. A number of people, including myself, had to send their food back. The shrimp bisque soup was too salty and it tasted like tomato soup instead of a shrimp bisque. I'm not a meat eater and the menu did not cater to non-meat eaters.

I am always nervous asking for substitution (even though I do it all the time) and our waiter was so nice about it!  He told me that I could substitute anything I wanted, he even repeated it twice!  So, I took out the tahini and added in feta.  Guess it wasn't vegan anymore, right?  Anyway, everything was great!  \\n\\nThe falafel was good, crispy on the outside and soft/fresh on the inside.  It had a nice flavor to it, I really liked it.  The hummus was good but I think it just needed a bit of time for the flavors to come together.  It was much more flavorful today when I ate the leftovers.  The feta was delicious and they gave me quite a bit of it, which is always nice!  The tabouli was incredibly fresh, I just wish it had a bit of lemon in it.  I should have asked for some but I was too busy stuffing my face to take a moment to do so.  My favorite part of the meal was the majadra which is brown rice and lentils with onions.  It was so good, especially the onions that it came with.  I loved it.  Paul really liked it too, he ate quite a bit of it.  Oh, and he liked the tabouli a lot as well....guess he doesn't mind that there wasn't a lot of lemon on it.\\n\\nOh, and I really loved the freshly baked pita that came out right after they took it out of the oven.  It was so fantastic, I was in love!  They give you a small plate of hummus too.  Umm, how great is that?  Free hummus and freshly baked pita bread served right out of the oven?  Super cool.  \\n\\nPaul got the fatayr which seemed like a beef pizza to me when the set it down.  It was too funny, when they put it on our table we both just looked at and said...wow, it is a beef pizza.  Paul liked it though, I guess it had quite a lot of spices in it.  I am not sure if he will order it again, he didn't eat the leftovers that he took home.  As we were leaving though, he mentioned that he really enjoyed the food and would totally go back there.

This evening was one of the worst experiences I have ever had and I will not be going back again. First of all, they did not want to give us our full order of beef tataki or our oysters. They have gotten rid of their happy hour menu so we had to pay full price for the AYCE dinner menu which was fine, but we expected a better dining experience with more options. We had to argue just to get our full plate of beef tataki, we had ordered oyster motoyaki and they gave us scallops instead. When we asked them to fix this, not only did they bring us back scallops once, they brought it back another time and when we looked at the scallops, it was quite apparent they had used the same scallops over and over again as they were overcooked and discolored by the end. Our smelt looked and tasted like it was a day old and microwaved, the beef tataki was drowning in an overpowering sauce, the scallops were clearly recycled, the salmon belly tasted off, and the manager as apologetic as she was did not seem genuine whatsoever. We can not fault our server as she tried to help us and we could hear them all arguing loudly in the restaurant in another language, looking at us and then laughing which was extremely unprofessional. We weren't offered any kind of compensation, just endless excuses about different chefs. If your chef doesn't know what an oyster is, your chef should not be in the kitchen. I am so upset and appalled about this entire experience and after arguing with the \\"manager\\", I convinced her to charge us for one person rather than 2 and said unfortunately I will not be returning after my family being customers for 13+ years. It didn't seem to phase her at all. This place already does not have the best quality Japanese food but the happy hour and late night price made it worthwhile.

August is the right time for this dish in New England and it didn't disappoint. The zucchini blossoms were good but a little heavy as they were stuffed with ricotta and crab. The dish that really made the night was the garganelli though. In hind sight I should have gotten his as my entree...it was that good. The homemade pasta was paired with perfectly braised duck in a red wine sauce with dried cherries, Tuscan Kale and pine nuts.

One had the turkey sandwich (sliced, nothing special) and two of us ordered the chopped brisket plate as recommend by the staff. Man was it overcooked. Jerky-like and stiff, plus they broke the cardinal rule of any legit barbecue joint: they pre-soaked it in sauce. My friend and I are positive it had been in a crock pot and rehydrated with the sauce. Then, they offer other sauces, despite the fact that the kitchen already chose one for us. And there's no way the meat had been smoked that day. No way. Succotash tasted like some sort of previously frozen concoction from Trader Joes. To top it all off, my meal with tea plus tip came in at $22.00! A quick scan of other cheaper neighborhood option would reveal Bone's, Chops, Houstons, etc.\\n\\nThis place smacks of \\"future chain concept backed by investors\\" with clever graphics and menu options, rather than a place where somebody loved smoking barbecue and decided to hang out a shingle."},{"name":"Chart House","address":"60 Long Wharf","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"You couldn't ask for a better location I'm pretty sure it's the only reason this place is still in business.

OK, first off, I'm def a fan (ever since eating at a Wagamama in London a couple years ago) and was thrilled when the first two Wagamama restaurants to open in the U.S. were in Boston. Now that there's a third close by at the Pru, I'm a regular. \\n\\nThere's really nothing all that special about Wagamama, but the atmosphere is fun and the design bright and sleek (long communal tables, lots of glass, \\"outside\\" tables, etc.) and the food is consistently good.  And inexpensive.  You can't go wrong with the teppan dishes, espec. the yaki soba and ginger chicken udon. Oh, and I have a mild addiction to their chili chicken ramen. And the chicken itame and chicken kare lomen are pretty damn fine as well.  Service is always good, staff are friendly, and take out is invariably ready in less than 15 mins.  Final note: I can respect many of the \\"meh\\" reviews, except all those based solely or mostly on the (outrageous!) fact that each dish comes out when it is ready -- no effort to serve everybody in a party at the same time (remember, your sitting at a communal table).

Needless to say, we decided to wait for the meat -- the whole reason to come to Brazilian Steakhouse!\\n\\nWhich I guess Red and Green hasn't got quite right yet. The meat was disappointing to say the least. Like others have said, it was either over seasoned or unseasoned. Poor cuts of meat and even lesser quality. The filet with bacon was a joke, more like a bunch of fat wrapped in fat and thrown on skewer. The house special, the Rump, they do push extremely hard as someone else has mentioned. The filet was OK but you could tell the quality was off. Don't know how to put it, but it was just off.\\n\\nOn to the redeeming qualities of Red and Green...\\n\\nThe gauchos -- or whatever you call those meat sherpas -- were very attentive. They made it around to our table with sizzling skewers left and right. They even delivered on all our requests -- to try the filet with bacon, to have more filet, and to have our meat selections cooked to a certain Medium Rare quality.\\n\\nAll in all, I would not eat here again, nor  would I recommend it to anyone that I actually considered a friend. Reading all the reviews here before attending made me already unsure of the place but it was a friends birthday so I went all in regardless.\\n\\nTL;DR: Save up another week.

We ended up ordering the spicy and northeast broth, both of which were really incredibly savory with a lot of depth in flavor from all the different spices in the broth. They really lived up to our expectations, and made it so that the hot pot experience wasn't focused just on the side orders, but also on the soup as a whole! The staff also never let you run out of broth, as they'll come by and add more when they see you're running low.\\n\\nWe also got the lamb shoulder, garlic beef, and pork belly, which we thought was a good combination, as the lamb and garlic beef were both delicious but had their own strong flavors, while the pork belly soaks of the flavor from the broth.

The ambience is modern, and fitting for any sort of gathering.\\n\\nOverall, really enjoyed this place, and have already been planning another visit with friends!

I've now been three times and all I can say is \\"meh\\".  It's just as schizophrenic as Mango Spice was which another poster alluded to also (same owners? I'd certainly believe it).  The food is ok. The service is poor. The ONLY saving grace for this place is that it is VERY family friendly. They bring a toy bin to the kids at the table and let them pick a toy. They serve kids meals on Frisbees. They're really trying in that realm, and for WS, that's something to be appreciated and is needed.\\n\\nNow, to why they aren't so great.  First meal there, I ordered the Turkey Burger.  The menu clearly says on focaccia bread, with pico, and a chipotle sauce... sounds yummy right? cool. I order it. The waiter is confused.. \\"do I want Lettuce, tomato ,and onion on it?\\" (fine). Me: \\"uh, no, I want it exactly how it's said it's prepared on the menu\\"\\". Him: \\"uhh, so that's a no on the tomato  and onion?\\" (clearly he doesn't know his own menu... major management issue #1-- putting a waiter on the floor who doesn't know the menu).  So I pull out the menu and explain it to him... with the chipotle, and pico, etc...  Ok, a little more work ordering than I like, but whatever.  So about 45 mins later-- a LONG wait for food (especially with my young nieces and nephews at the table), it comes out with (dum dum): Lettuce, tomato, and onion on a sesame seed bun (not the focaccia roll the menu says). WTH?!? ugh. So I ask for the chipotle and pico on the side (I'll put it on my damn self)... with a snippy comment that apparently the kitchen doesn't know the menu either;) (I'm bitchy and hungry at this point..forgive me)/  The waiter apologizes and says \\"That's crazy he messed it up-- the HEAD chef!\\" (So apparently your head chef doesn't know his own menu... {sigh} Another major problem.   I had to wait like 10 more mins to get my pico and chipoltle, but once I did, the burger was pretty decent. If they did it right the first time I would have been pleased.  The fries are \\"ok\\"-- they remind me of BK's fries, but maybe 10% better.  They at least were crispy and hot.\\n\\nSO, trip #2. I went for the pasta this time. I think it's called the \\"herb crusted chicken pasta\\". Again, terribly long wait. Our waitress this time kept apologizing... she said my \\"pasta was confusing them and taking a long time\\". It's chicken and pasta? again, major problem: Kitchen apparently doesn't know their own menu.  When I finally got it, it was fine. Maybe even good. But the hour + wait for the food with small children irked me. If it were just me and my boyfriend out to a romantic dinner, the wait would be fine, BUT this isn't South and York. Key to successful family friendly restaurant: Prompt service!.\\n\\nSo trip #3: Tried the turkey burger again. Was VERY specific AGAIN about wanting it \\"as on the menu\\".  Our waiter was pretty cool, so I chatted him up about the place. Told him about my last experience where they \\"couldn't figure out the chicken and pasta\\" and his response was \\"really?! That's one of our most popular dishes!\\" (I was there on a Saturday night both times... you'd think the A team would be working). Turkey burger comes out... EXACTLY the same as the first time I ordered it. No pico, no chipotle sauce.. {sigh}. I just ate it... because I've pretty much given up on great food from here. \\n\\nAnyways, the recipes have potential. I think the issue is management... and if it is the same as Mango Spice, unless something changes, I fear it's not here for long... \\n\\n(I'm sure I'll go again... my sister lives around the corner... so I'll update. I hope it's just growing pains.)"},{"name":"Cuchillo","address":"261 Powell Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"I rarely come out to this area to eat but I will definitely come back here! What a great spot! I honestly can't think of anything even slightly negative about this place. We got such amazing service. Everyone was so friendly and real. Not the superficial kind of good service. The food was incredibly delicious and drinks were on point. I called to push my reservation by 30 minutes 10 minutes before I was supposed to get there and they were accommodating. They keep a lot of tables for walk ins so I recommend reserving as it does get busy. We started with tacos as it was happy hour. You get a margarita and 2 tacos for $15. Their daily special was a pork taco with fried banana yummm. Also tried their rockfish taco which was okay. We shared the shrimp dish and the steak dish which blew my mind. The steak had some sugar on the outside and was so good. The mashed potato bed it came on was loaded with bacon every bite was heavenly.

The mutton biryani tasted like it was made a week ago and super bland.  Only thing enjoyable in my option is the chicken 65 and butter chicken.

My cousin feels the same, and I will be bestowing her with a pile of treats from Quejos when I see her today.  But their buns are so good that anyone can enjoy them.  Try that with some rice bread from Choices.  You will not get the same reaction from wheat-eaters.  Trust.\\n\\nI devoured two buns in my car on my way back to the office yesterday.

The French bread was grilled with a touch of butter, then stuffed with some of the most tender and flavorful prime rib I had tasted in a long time. Absolutely spellbindingly delicious. Real au jus to dip this powerhouse of a sandwich in. The hand cut French fries rival the best from any legendary burger joint in Southern California.

There's something for everyone, as far as the food is concerned, and the beer is different enough to make it never get old.  The beer is the real standout here; their standards are really a cut above most brewpub beer, the stout and the IPA in particular, and their seasonal stuff (seems to always be the high alcohol brews that grab my attention) is invariably tasty.  It's a great place to start an evening if you're hanging around Moody Street, or on its own.  It's also goes well with a movie next door at the Embassy, not that that's any kind of unique idea.  My entire office had a bit to drink one Friday and went and saw something funny, and it was, you know, funny.  The food is generally a notch above adequate.  Personally, I strongly recommend sticking to their sandwiches and wraps and stuff; their entrees and stuff tend not to be worth the somewhat steeper cost, I've found.  But they make good sandwiches, and excellent french fries.  It's typically not too crowded early in the evening, and can be taken over easily for large groups.

So, this review is about only the Pine State Biscuit I lovingly devoured at the Portland Farmer's Market.  If and when I ever actually make it to the restaurant, I will update my review with more info.  Let me s'plain...\\n\\nBeing from the Midwest, nothing strikes the chords of food goodness in my heart more than the thought of filling, hot comfort food--like biscuits.  So I set out one lovely Portland morning on my bike hoping to beat the crowd.  Whilst riding my new-ish bike from my house in NE PDX up Belmont Mountain (yeah, you didn't know there was a mountain there--I didn't either, until I tried riding up the Belmont St. \\"gentle slope\\" on my bike), I had just nearly crested the hill, when my pedal CAME OFF.  Yes, the entire bike pedal actually fell right off my bike and into the street where I ran over it and luckily didn't kill myself.  Sans pedal, it was going to be a long journey to Pine State...so I stopped right there and ate at Jace Gace instead, which is of course, also good comfort food (waffles!), but a biscuit is what I had my heart set on.  (After breakfast, I rolled back down Belmont Mountain to the bike shop to get a repair.)\\n\\nThen another weekend, after weather reports of glorious, warm, Portland summertime finally arriving, I once again set out on my bike to go to Pine State (this time with pedals firmly installed).  And found a cold, wet drizzle and gray skies outside my door that morning.  Determined, and foolishly wanting to believe the weather man, I kept pedaling, thinking it would burn off, and within seconds I had to admit I was freezing cold and wet.  Beaten, I ate instead at Milo's (ANOTHER great Portland breakfast institution).  Sigh.  Finally, I gave up on my attempts to get to the Pine State restaurant, and went to the Portland Farmer's Market, where they have a stand.\\n\\nThis is where I finally ate one perfect, hot biscuit, with a side cup of whipped butter and honey.  You know how much  I like my honey.  Holy crap.

Maybe it was just happen stance and someone forgot to clean the bathroom that day? Whatever it was, it didn't make me feel very hungry.\\n\\n We tried many a fare, but I mostly tried the sushi- it wasn't bad for buffet sushi, actually pretty decent sashimi- equivalent to what you would get from a sushi track style restaurant. My children also enjoyed it.\\n The Chinese style food was what you would expect from any Chinese take out, not great or bad, very salty and sweet but thats what your taste buds crave right?\\n\\nThe verdict;\\nAfter everyone had their fill and I received the bill I couldn't help but wonder if I made the right decision, The food was decent but at $15 per person, Im not sure it was worth it. Now if they could figure out a way to get it to $10 per person without dropping the quality and the bathroom was cleaner, I think this would be a 4-star restaurant, or at least we would be regular patrons. \\n\\nFor buffets its always the quality to price ratio, the quality of the food here is higher than average for a buffet, but I'm just not sure its worth it.

The spicy broth wasn't that spicy and it really did taste like it came from the Little Lamb Pre-made Hot Pot Packet you can buy at any supermarket. However, I didn't feel thirsty after the meal, which is a very good sign. Then there's the meat... I got the lamb and beef combo which was sliced too thinly...so thin that they kind of dissipated in the broth and then I would wrongfully blame my friend for hoarding all the meat.

A lot of their plates would be much better if they just added some seasoning, and didn't try so hard with the condiments. There are too many wacky \\"salsas of the day\\" and about five different sauces to choose from (none of which are New or Mexican, at least not to my knowledge).  On this trip, I ordered a chimichanga ($11.99, about $4 more than any other restaraunt) and the mango salsa (complementary), which contained not mango, but cantaloupe, and I wondered how many people they tried to fool with this concoction.  The portions are a good size, comparable to most Mexican restaurants, but even so the price just makes me cringe.\\n\\nOverall, for the price, it's not worth it.

Sadly, this restaurant did not cut it.  Start with the Marg, I order one of \\"coin\\" margs instead of the house marg.  I asked what was in it besides the stated tequila.  When he said Cointreau, I thought it would be substantial.  No, did not seem to have any Cointreau, was just sour and chock full of ice.  When I asked about it, I was brought about a half shot on the side.  That helped, but would not order again. This restaurant does not bring you chips and salsa. They are an additional $4.  No thanks, on the principal of the matter. Burritos were what I would call Chipolte style, (but not as good) with rice, beans, protein and pickled red cabbage inside, wrapped in a dry flour tortilla.  This was served on a plate with an additional scoop of pickled red cabbage, which was not necessary and redundant as you are already getting plenty of pickled red cabbage inside the burrito. That was confusing.  Verde did not fulfill my craving for Mexican food on any level.

We showed up at an odd time (3pm on a Saturday) so we were the only ones in the restaurant. I figure that should mean the cooks have the time to concentrate on our food, so if this was what it was like when it wasn't busy, I'd hate to be there when it is.\\n\\nFood - If you're the kind of person who wants to know your meat is well and truly dead, this is the place to be. Everything was overcooked, tough and chewy, from shrimp and scallops to beef and chicken. I prefer to know my meat was once a living thing, not just meat-flavored rubber. The Tom Kha was okay, I've certainly had better, not spicy enough for my taste and the rubber meat certainly didn't help it. \\n\\nSpeaking of spice, take the star ratings on this menu with a grain of salt. Mine was the spiciest dish ordered, and it had no stars on the menu. Two of my dining companions ordered 2 and 3 star dishes and they were milder than mine. None were so hot we couldn't eat them, but people afraid of spice shouldn't assume that the ratings in the menu have any relation to the heat of the dish.\\n\\nThe pineapple rice was yummy, but I would have liked to see more of the pineapple make its way into the rice. Why serve it on a 1/4 pineapple and then only give us a couple of pieces of said pineapple in the dish? Bit of a tease if you ask me.\\n\\nOther than those two dishes, there was nothing we ordered that I would order again. For the price, I wouldn't go back at all as I'm sure I can do better elsewhere.\\n\\nThe most annoying thing was ordering \\"hot tea\\" and having it come to the table tap-water cold. It was served in a metal tea pot, so as far as I'm concerned there's no excuse for that. If the pot is cold, so is the tea inside, fix it before you bring it to the table.\\n\\nI will give that the dessert was tasty. The sticky rice was excellent, though the mango they served on top of it could have used another day or two to ripen more fully. But I understand that getting perfectly ripe fruit is subject to availability and thus hit and miss. I might go back just for dessert, but it probably wouldn't be worth the drive downtown or the hunt for a parking spot.\\n\\nAtmosphere - okay decor, but no background music, so being the only diners there was eerily silent.\\n\\nOverall, I'd have to say it wasn't the worst food I've ever eaten, but I won't be back."},{"name":"Taco Loco Mexican Grill","address":"44 Broadway","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"I love this place.

Ok we experimented a little because our Italian server recommended the pizza, but it was really delicious. Crust was thin and ingredients were fresh. My daughter enjoyed 1/2 of the pepperoni side as well. The bill for a 20 inch pizza and garlic bread including tip was $40. We usually pay more at Epcot for mediocre food.

Came here on a Tuesday late night with a friend after a long day at Magic Kingdom. When we came in we were told that the wait would be around 20 minutes, even though the place was pretty empty, so we decided to sit at the bar. The bartender/waitress didn't even acknowledge us for about 10 minutes once we had to speak up pretty loudly. Even after that, she didn't give us menus for another few minutes, and then it took her awhile to take our orders. We had to order a drink because we were getting the half-priced appetizers as our meals, so we ordered milkshakes. The milkshakes we ordered were absolutely disgusting, with them basically tasting like crushed ice with a bit of syrup in them. We couldn't even have more than one sip of them, and asked her to take those off our check. The appetizers took quite a while to come out, and when they did they were lukewarm at best. Our waitress continued to not be attentive at all, and even when she did come to us, she was pretty aloof.\\n\\nThe physical location is attached to a hotel, so they had a buffet area next to the bathroom, which I found interesting.

Being that you only get so much room to type on Google reviews and their rating system is lacking, I looked on Yelp.  my husband already turned into this joint so I couldn't really refuse.  Being that I'm a major American food critic, I was ready to get some plain burgers.\\n\\nUpon entering, you notice that the place is set up in a way that is a mix of a BBQ joint with the long tables and a classic 50s style in a way with the decor.  There are boxes of potatoes to help guide you up to the menu that is placed above you.  The menu is quite simple and straight forward.  There are no specialty burgers.  You create your burger from the options they provide and they write your order on a white paper bag and circle the options you choose.  As for me, I wanted a chili burger with cheese, pickles, mustard and jalapenos.  As soon as I say I want a 1/2 burger and, \\"..also chili please...\\", I was interrupted by the employee and asked if I want cheese.  I said yes and then started over saying I want chili and he cuts me off again to repeat my burger option so far.  I said chili finally and he says, \\"Okay what do you want on that?  Red, white or yellow\\" and I said, \\"er...um..\\"yeller\\".  Then he repeats the full order again and then asks what else I want on it.  \\"Lettuce, tomato, onions, pickles...\\"  I tell him and he then asks if I want a side of fries and would I like a drink.  Basically, I wasn't allowed to order myself, I had to just let him talk and choose what he mentioned.  He repeated my order back to me so fast and acted rushed so I nodded and thought I heard him say chili.  I guess he never heard me through his interruptions even though every time I hardly said chili or fully said it, he was writing something down, making me think he wrote it all.  \\nThere drink options are like any other place.  There isn't any sugar cane, all natural sodas or anything like you'll find in other joints.  They do have some good ice tea whether is sweet or unsweetened.  \\nThey call the name you give them and you go up to get your food which is placed in the bag they wrote your order on so you can see what they wrote in comparison to what you got on your burger.  Mine was missing the chili and now you know why.  When you're not allowed to talk, you won't get your correct order.\\nThe buns are simple white bread buns, no sesame seed.  The burger itself is decent in size.  The fries are crinkle fries and very slim.  You can tell they are fresh because many are brown.  It's also great that they aren't given to you soaked in oil.  The fries were lacking in flavor and that might have to do with the type of oil they use.  The meat is juicy and probably gets some salt or some other seasonings but not a big deal.  It tastes about as good as Whataburger except MF gives thick patties.  They pride themselves on healthy meat by saying their meat doesn't contain extra hormones.  Here's the thing:  If you want healthy burgers, you'll need to find a place that advertises organic grass fed beef because you don't know where MF buys their meat and what the cows grew up eating even though they say nothing was injected into the meat or put in the cows' food.  That's the other thing, if cows are *given* food, watch out.   Cows only need grass, not soy, not grains, just grass.  They have a list of positives on their napkin holders on every table.  They mention that random other places have hormones and don't do this or that but that MF is way better because of all these other things.  I'm sorry but if you don't have grass fed beef, you don't have healthy beef.\\nThe place is pretty clean here.  There was a girl cleaning up everything.  My son flipped out and threw food everywhere and this girl came right over and cleaned it up a minute later.  There is an interactive video screen on the window of the kitchen where kids and punch at it and digital burgers and drinks float across the screen.  They will eventually get bored with it but it's nice to have when you need a few minutes to eat.  Kids were walking all over the place and it still wasn't cramped.  The Frito pie and chili dog were decent and just as good as any Sonic though this place splits the dog and grills it on a flat grill.  \\n\\nAll in all, quite decent.  Nothing to write home about but not terrible either.  It's great if you need a quick bite and need it fast.  It's slightly pricey with the single pricing of the burger and fries are separate.  There are no combo meals.  If you don't feel like going into a fast food joint and prefer more of a casual place, this is good to go.  You can hang out outside too and people watch a little.  They do have tvs with sports to watch too if you need to relax some.  There are open boxes of tomatoes where kids can play in them.  That's different so I can only assume they are going for a small country town look and trying to bring a nostalgic feel to it as well."},{"name":"McGoo's Pizza","address":"479 W Broadway","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Pretty delish for a Southie attempt at pizza.

Earlier in the day, we had looked at both of the restaurants in the Italian pavilion and Via Napoli caught my eye when the sign outside proclaimed VPN certification (Google search for some of the requirements to be VPN certified if you want more info) for their wood fired pizza. This reeled me in hard and we made plans to show up later in the day  once the crowds died down. We ended up getting in right before closing time when the restaurant was about half empty with very little wait. \\n\\nWe sat down at our table and it took a solid 5 minutes of our waiter chatting in Italian to the table next to us for him to even acknowledge that we were there. Not what you expect in a Disney operation or any restaurant. We ordered promptly since it was toward the end of their night and went with a Blood orange agua fresca and a \\"personal\\" sized Margherita that measured out around 10\\" by my eye. The agua fresca was light and exactly what we hoped it would be. Highly refreshing after a long day and prepared us for our pizza.\\n\\nOur pizza came out pre-sliced and my first impressions weren't overly positive. The basil wasn't distributed evenly across the pizza and there was way more cheese than I would expect. The other thing I noticed is that for a VPN style pizza there was very little rise in the crust and the cheese had small burn marks on the top. That led me to assume that the ovens weren't quite hot enough to cook the pizza quickly and it had to sit too long exposed in the oven. Just a guess though. The dough wasn't bad in that it had some chew and crust but it lacked in seasoning which I am a stickler for. There was some flavor evidence of proofing but it wasn't exceptional. The cheese was a bit over cooked (as my picture shows) which was disappointing because the beautiful texture of fresh mozzarella was basically turned into the dry mass that comes with a grated and aged NY style version. Not appealing in this application. The sauce was basic pureed San Marzano tomato which is perfectly acceptable but as a component in the whole pie it suffered because there was little to no salt to be found anywhere. If you don't salt your crust appropriately then you need to at least add some salt to the sauce to balance out the sweetness of the sauce. Just common sense!\\n\\nIf it weren't for the poor service we received, this would have been rated a 3 for the pizza and drink we had. I would stop in again to get some fresh close to authentic pizza asa small respite from the craziness outside. Although, the average at best quality of the pizza does show that just having a VPN certification doesn't guarantee the highest quality end product. Reaching that level requires more effort and attention to detail from the staff than just having good imported ingredients."},{"name":"Peaceful Restaurant","address":"110-532 W Broadway","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"We got some noodles can't remember exactly which ones, peace roll and I think beef and bean dish and let me tell yah it extremely flavourful and fresh with the dishes having some definite kick.

Now you know, and knowing is half the battle. \\n\\nChile Verde has found the Goldilocks Zone of southwestern food - it's not too mild or too spicy.  You taste the food, not the peppers.  That's great because the food has a terrific flavor and texture.  I ordered the BBQ steak burrito, and I loved it.  The juicy steak was cooked/seasoned to perfection and topped with savory melted cheese. \\n\\nThe service was good; the waiter had the complimentary chips and salsa on the table immediately upon arrival.  We had our dinners within 15 minutes of ordering.\\n\\nThere's a huge selection of food, too.  It's a small restaurant that has double the number of entrees of a large restaurant.  If I do my bistromath properly, that makes Chile Verde's menu four times better than other restaurants'. \\n\\nChile Verde is an all-around awesome experience.  Go there.  Tonight.  Unless it's Sunday; they're closed Sunday.\\n\\n[P.S.  For more fun, this review contains references to 1) G.I. Joe, 2) astrophysics, and 3) Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy.

I was offered samples of different dishes, taught how to eat fufu and peanut butter soup the authentic way with my hands, and was treated to some table side hand washing. It was a very comfortable and hospitable atmosphere and I enjoyed the food just as much as I enjoyed the service and experience.

The poke roll had great flavor that went well with the crunchy seaweed salad on top.

I put in an order this afternoon for a lunch box, order of spring rolls and a chicken chow mein. Not at all complicated. I ordered through just eat, paid online, and waited patiently. Over an hour later after calling the restaurant, my food arrived. (Mind you, the woman who answered the phone was very kind and apologized for the wait.) The driver literally handed me the bag, said \\"okay\\" and left IMMEDIATELY. No hello no thank you no enjoy your food or anything, I'm surprised I was able to even catch the bag before he fled off. I was just thankful to have my food so I closed the door and went to enjoy it with my boyfriend. Wow. This was the worst bento lunch box I've ever had, and I've had probably 20 in just the last few months. Either the driver took 300 years to get to me (the restaurant is a 7 minute drive away) or the food was sitting there forever. Everything that was supposed to be hot was cold and vise versa. The sushi was warm and had been sitting so long it tasted only of the orange slice that was next to it. The chicken teriyaki was fully soggy, along with the tempura, and had a coating of \\"slime-like\\" teriyaki sauce covering the rice, nothing like I've ever had before. The textures were truly nauseating. I absolutely love tempura, but I couldn't even finish this one. It was wet, soft and had a POOL of oil that it was sitting on. Again, I eat lunch boxes identical to the one I ordered at least once a week, and have never had one this disgusting. I'm known for never EVER wasting food, if you don't finish your food, I definitely will....but I couldn't even eat half of this box. It was horrible.

Plus with the side of homemade sweet potato chips I guarantee you will not be hungry after this meal. Since the sandwich is toasted on a panini press, the avocado/cheesey corn goodness tends to fall out. \\n\\nHam Quiche- I love quiche and the one at Crema Cafe had a great savory balance with generous chunks of ham and cheddar.

They were so pleasant, genuine and their displays showcased homemade banana breads and baklava - and that alone sold me on staying here. Couches available to lounge in, tables and chairs setup throughout this modern, yet warm and inviting atmosphere. \\n\\nSo anytime I try someplace new, I usually order a variety of things because I don't want to just settle on one dish and wish I had ordered the other thing. Plus, when you go with friends or family, you can just share plates. (Let's be honest, eating is always best when you have someone to share it with, ya?) So we literally ordered almost  1/2 the menu :) Here's the skinny:\\n\\n- Gyro - The way a gyro should be made. Shaved lamb, lettuce, tomatoes, tzatziki sauce, a nice warm pita to bundle up the goodies inside....mmmm...creamy, zesty and tasty in each bite. \\n- Gyro Platter - Rice, lamb, pita and 2 sides (we ordered the baba ghanoush and hummus)\\n- Chicken Platter - Chicken, rice, pita and 2 sides\\n- Loaf of Banana Bread - We ordered the plain which was dense, moist and full of banana flavor\\n- Baklava - We ordered the walnut and honey. MMmmmmmm, the phyllo dough was nice, light, flaky and crusty and I loved biting into the walnut/honey layer. \\n- Pineapple/Peach Lemonade - Made with real pineapples, peaches and lemons!\\n- Strawberry Lemonade - Made with real strawberries and lemons!\\n- Chicken Gyro - We ordered this plain for the kids. AND, he even gave us free chips for the kids because we had commented that they were picky eaters! What great service!\\n\\nEverything here was homemade, fresh, healthy, plentiful, QUICK and delicious! (And VERY reasonably priced!!)  This is by far one of my all-time favorite Mediterranean places I've eaten from the east coast to the west. The one thing I didn't order was the Schwarma which is definitely something I'll be ordering on my next adventure here. \\n\\nHonestly, if you're looking for real, authentic, locally owned and operated Mediterranean food, this is a place you NEED to check out. The owners are so friendly, warm and are so pleasant to chit chat with. They are serious about their customer's satisfaction and overall experience. The quality of their food, their menu options and their customer service is evident that this is one of those gems you just have to share. I can't tell you how many other places that came to mind where we thought they were good, but were nowhere near comparison to Tahini's.  :) This is officially our go-to for Mediterranean. \\n\\nPS - They do catering as well for all types of crowds :)"},{"name":"Thai Fresh","address":"8409 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Lovely atmosphere, very good service, very very good food, you will not be disappointed!!! for Soultheast, this is as better than anything iv\`e had, in the last 13 years, go, go, GO!!!"},{"name":"Pepper Box Cafe","address":"932 SE Morrison St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I really want to give this place a 4 star rating, I just think that there are a couple issues that they need to address before doing so. First off, I spent a few years in New Mexico and jump at any opportunity to eat anything that hails from that genre of food. This place isn't flashy, it strikes me in many ways as a home cooked, comfort food version of many New Mexican dishes. My main issue here is with a few of the ingredients that they have chosen to use. For example, I got the green chile and cheese fries and the topping was to die for, but the fries were kinda gross, they almost tasted like the cheap frozen food aisle fries you can get at the store, and honestly killed it for me. The Green Chile burger was pretty darn good with a unique flavor and bun choice, but then the lettuce seemed to be that cheap bulk lettuce that comes in a monster bag that they serve in fast food burgers. It's little things like that that ultimately resonated with me, and if they can resolve a few of those things, I will happily give this place another star. Also, if they can add a few more things to the menu, such as a stuffed sopapilla with Carne asada Christmas style or a New Mexican Breakfast burrito or something like that, that would be super awesome.

With this new and improved crust idea, I think I will be frequenting this place for the rest of life now.\\n\\nAnother one of the reasons that I will frequent this place is because of a special night they have. It's like poor college student Thursdays or something. They had two dollar half-apps, so we got the Bruchetta (Diced tomatoes, basil and seasonings tossed in balsamic vinegar and olive oil. Topped with feta and fresh basil, served on garlic toast points and drizzled with a balsamic glaze). It came with three pieces instead of the usual five, but it was only two dollars, so it was worth every penny."},{"name":"Citizen Eatery","address":"5011 Burnet Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"So impressed with food and service even my son loved it who isn't vegan.

Not knowing it was an Asian fusion establishment, I thought it was distinctly NOT Asian fusion: I could only gather a hint of the chili used as the base in the Frutti and the glaze reminded me of Singapore. \\n\\nBut strong food stands on it's own. Well portioned, the Frutti harvested plenty of sea creatures to satisfy and made good on it's promise to be spicier than most. The Steak was plainly that but was tender and melted in our mouths.

The bar has plenty of unique and high brow products from local and distant sources. A wheat beer and a \\"biodynamic\\" (a.k.a super hippie) wine top that list.

This time some friends and I ended up there on a Monday, Raymond was there being friendly as was one of my favorite bartenders, but he KJ host was very rude and honestly nasty. I will admit that they were VERY busy and clearly not set up to handle the 60 plus people there for a birthday party, but what this KJ said to my friends was completely uncalled for and unacceptable. \\n\\nFirst of all, he talks over singers WHILE THEY'RE SINGING, and makes comments about them. It's already nerve wracking enough for some folks to bear their soul and sing their favorite song in front of strangers, it's unneeded to have some guy TALKING OVER YOU while you do it. \\n\\nOne of my friends requested Killing Moon, which wasn't in the books, he called her up to ask her to pick another song. She chose Baker Street, knowing it was in the book and the host snickered at her. As if that wasn't enough when she came up to actually sing he literally said \\"I f*king hate this song\\" right to her! Part of karaoke is that we all end up listening to songs we don't like sung by nice folks who probably aren't great singers. The whole point is that it's fun and this guy was a total dick to her, sucking all the fun out. I've NEVER seen a KJ be so incredibly rude to a singer ever before in my life. \\n\\nHe was also VERY rude to my other friend, literally yelling at him for putting in a song \\"under a different name\\" even he hadn't put in a song at all before that moment. It was accusatory and rude, honestly very nasty and uncalled for. I understand it was busy and there were a lot of singers, but there's no needed to get aggressive with patrons. \\n\\nLuckily this experience will not keep me away from Spare Room, but I will likely never return for a Monday night karaoke session unless I know that this host will not be there. I hope to never encounter them again. They made me feel unsafe because of their aggressiveness and it was a huge bummer to have such a nasty experience at what is otherwise a very laid back, friendly, awesome dive bar."},{"name":"The Locus","address":"4121 Main Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Great place.

This is one of those places that jams you on the menu by listing a base price for a one-topping pizza. Keep in mind that cheese counts as the topping.

Nope.  This place has a great atmosphere, fun and appropriately lively and loud.  But in my opinion the food is just all over the place, disappoints over and over - again and again.  The owners can't seem to get it through their heads that the CUSTOMERS should like the food, not just the owners.  It's so odd.  They seem like they want to try, but if you mention something to the staff or manager/owners, they argue with you and debate - your personal opinion.  I'm no chef, but their food seems to be frozen - not fresh.   If it is fresh food, then somebody in the kitchen is really in need of some assistance or something.   Anything with veggies makes you think they buy the cheapest, blandest, least tasty/fresh veggies they can find.  As if they're trying to serve dry, old tasting veggies.  They've taken serving dried out meats to a new level of dry.  \\n\\nThe service is either fine, B- or C+ range, but other times it's a horrible, D- or straight up F (failure).  Even if you get a server who is friendly, they seem over worked or just not able to cope if they get busy.  I'm not looking for five star dining, fancy table cloths, and a server who calls me \\"Sir\\" or anything.  I'm fine with a \\"Howdy!

As a huge fan of Disney, I knew I had to spend my free night at Magic Kingdom. I managed to get a reservation at Be Our Guest by refreshing multiple times until something popped up. Reservation for 1 at 7:50. Beauty and the Beast has been my favorite Disney movie since I was a little girl, so I was beyond excited. However, it was not the best experience. I got there 15 minutes early to check in...and was told they were an hour behind. I could either take the buzzer and sit there and wait until 8:50, or I could go explore the park and come back at 9:30. I chose the second option so I didn't waste time just sitting around.\\n\\nI wound up coming back at 8:30 because I had gotten drenched by a sudden downpour and I have to say they were very kind. They let me run into the restroom to change into some dry clothes and wound up seating me at 8:45, so that worked out! My waitress Joanne was lovely and very helpful. I ordered the chicken provencal which she warned me had anchovie paste in the marinara. But it otherwise sounded delicious so I tried it....and did not like it. At all.\\n\\nAt this point, tired and wet and hungry, I figured I would just get dessert and move on. But one of the chefs came out, saw I hadn't eaten, and politely insisted I order something else to eat, going through the whole menu and recommending dishes. It was very sweet and less than 5 minutes later, I had the pork in front of me which was delicious! My waitress got me the chocolate ganache cupcake and a cup of tea (so lovely!). The view of the ballroom is spectacular and seeing the gentle snow falling outside the balcony was amazing.\\n\\nI went to get my picture taken with the Beast and had the professional photographer there do it. It was the one picture I wanted for the evening. But when I went to print it out the next day...every single one was blurry. I do not have one good photo from that night. I was so devastated. I have been given a number to call to see if Photo Pass can possibly fix the images or sharpen them, because they are just giant blurs. Seriously? This is this man's job, to take photos. He couldn't be bothered to check to make sure one of the photos was usable? How many other families did that happen to who I was in line with?

My boyfriend and I had an 8:55 pm (whoa, late) dinner reservation and checked in ahead of time. It took a while to be led into the restaurant, which was surprising because it wasn't all that full. No worries, though, right? We were led around the restaurant and shown the different rooms and then finally led to our table, which was in the \\"overflow\\" room. (I can't recall the name of the room, but it's the one with the music box.) It was practically empty and we felt like we had been put at the \\"kids'\\" table. I asked about this because I had my heart set on eating in the West Wing, but our waitress, who was really quite friendly and helpful with our menu questions, said it's a good idea to mention at check-in if you have a seating preference - so for future diners, it's something to keep in mind! \\n\\nThe food was wonderful. My boyfriend had the French onion soup and I'm pretty sure he died, went to heaven, then came back to life as he ate his delicious soup. He had the shrimp and scallops in a puff pastry and was also blown away by this dish. He came away feeling satisfied and very full. I went with the mussels appetizer as my main course, because I knew I wanted to save room for dessert. The mussels were really good and the portion size for mussels tends to be really fair given their appetizer pricing. I am ALL about lemon, so for dessert I had to have the lemon meringue cupcake. It was moist and amazing, with just the right amount of lemony tang. The chocolate cream puff also looked really tempting, so I might have to try that next. \\n\\nOverall, it was a great dining experience. After we ate, we only had to wait a few minutes for the Beast to begin taking pictures with guests, so we did that and left with great memories."},{"name":"Pho Corner","address":"6120 NE Sandy Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Went with no info about the restaurant other than it had quite a few cars.

It is probably about the worst tasting BBQ around...there are a number of bad ones as well so this is a true feat.  This is unfortunate given how beautiful the space is...great patio, great for games on TVs.  Awesome atmosphere.  Just terrible terrible food and it is clear they don't understand the BBQ genre of restaurant and how to cook with smoke and grade a quality wood.  Nor do they seem to understand how to prepare their meat either.  They clearly bake their ribs in the oven and don't smoke them.  Their pulled pork is saturated in cumin and seems as though it is perhaps even used from a previous day's pull.  Do yourself a favor and just eat before you come and plan to order drinks there and maybe just watch TV.  The owners and management obviously understand how to run all other aspects of a restaurant well but desperately need a BBQ guru who really understands that type of food before just throwing up a concept of a BBQ joint because they feel it is a good idea.  Chef cannot have experience w/ BBQ or pride in his food to put out what he does.

I gave this place four chances, but this last experience has sealed the deal.  Never coming back, and neither should you!!\\n\\nI'll sum up the first three experiences with an overall theme: Inattentive service, confused waitstaff, and long waits.\\n\\nThis most recent time actually has me fuming.  It ended with the manager telling me I must be mistaken on how to eat Korean food because I'm not Korean.  Luckily, my wife is and vouches for the fact that this place was ridiculous.\\n\\nSo, essentially what happened was this.  We arrive and order a bibimbap and combo of tofu soup with bibimbap.  I ask for the bibimbap to be wrapped to go from the combo (yeah, it's getting complicated).  Big picture was we were getting one bibimbap to go, and then sharing the combo of tofu soup with bibimbap.  To be clear, I've ordered this combo 3 times before, and always had the same food come out.  This time around, the same thing came out but we were short a bowl of rice in the stone bowl that comes with the tofu soup.  I asked for that, and the waiter came by with it promptly.  Doing okay so far!\\n\\nTHEN.... the waitress walks over and asks if we ordered an extra bowl of rice.  Confused, we discussed what she meant.  She was trying to explain to us that the combo comes with only one bowl of rice.  That would be understandable IF I didn't get 2 bowl of rice both times before, AND THE MENU SAYS RICE TWICE!!  She kept arguing, and ended up getting the menu to prove to me that she was right.  She then states, \\"I'm not judging you. I just want you to know what you were supposed to get.\\"  The menu is brought over, and it states under the combo line, \\"tofu with rice, vegetables and meat over rice.\\"  So.... rice... and rice.  TWO things of rice.  So, then I ask to speak to the manager.\\n\\nManager comes over, and does not help the issue.  He states in his smug tone, \\"No... no.... it only comes with one bowl of rice.\\"  I point out the menu again, and point out that regardless of what the menu says, you usually eat the tofu soup with rice, AND bibimbap with rice.  He reminds me, \\"You're not korean... Koreans eat it a different way.\\"  My wife (who IS Korean) interjects and corrects him...\\n\\nAlthough this is a small issue, when did the customer become someone you argue with or \\"not judge!!\\"  When a manager comes over at a GOOD restaurant, they usually smooth things over.  They don't point out that I don't understand Korean food because I'm not Korean.  \\n\\nWe asked for the check, packed up and left.  SO UNIMPRESSED.

The original Barnie's has done an amazing job of evolving over the years to keep up with the times and stay incredibly relevant. Barnie's is, first and foremost, a coffee shop. And they have great coffee. I'd take Barnie's over Starbucks 100% of the time. Not only can you get a cup of coffee at the shop, you can purchase their blends to brew at home.\\n\\nOver the years Barnie's has evolved to place an increased focus on food as well. And they have surprisingly good dishes for a place you would think is just a simple coffee kitchen. Really good. They have a nice brunch menu. And the lunch and dinner menus are impressive as well. You can even order from a small menu of wine and beer if you're not feeling the coffee deal. And, of course, mimosas. Because brunch isn't complete without mimosas.\\n\\nBarnie's coffee holds a special place in my heart. Growing up, my mother always got my father a bag of Santa's White Christmas as a stocking stuffer, and he would brew a pot on Christmas Day. That amazing nutty scent is so comforting and, to me, it doesn't get much better than enjoying a nice smooth cup of Santa's White Christmas while sitting outside on a fall day at Barnie's WP with a good book. Barnie's knows how to melt the world away. Sounds corny for a coffee shop, but it's true for me.\\n\\nSo, bottom line, if you appreciate a good cup of coffee and you find yourself on the Ave, stop into Barnie's and enjoy a relaxing few minutes with a cup o' joe. Pro tip: Try Santa's White Christmas. It's now available all year round, not just at Christmas time (because it's that good).

Well, first off, I had asked for spaghetti and got fettuccine instead, Then, the \\"rock shrimp\\" consisted of a half dozen (maybe less) little pieces of strong tasting shrimp-like meat. The supposed scallops did not look like any kind of actual scallop that I have ever seen, there were none of the tell tale vertical striations in the meat whatsoever. I am fairly certain it was some kind of scallop shaped fish product. The tomato-like sauce was just weird and had some rough cut carrots that seemed totally out of place in this dish. If that wasn't bad enough, I asked for a side salad and they charged me five dollars U.S. currency for a bowl of shredded iceberg lettuce with some anemic tomato slices and peppers on it. They were at least generous with the feta cheese on the salad. \\n\\nMy friends got salads and sandwiches that were of equally mediocre quality. I could not stomach the pasta though, so I exchanged it for an Italian sub, The sandwich was some okay lunch meat on a cold, doughy roll with a hand full of, you guessed it, shredded iceberg lettuce. I have had better sandwiches from the local grocer for two-thirds the price. One of our group got a calzone that looked okay, so maybe sticking with calzone or pizza is okay here. \\n\\nIt took a ridiculous amount of time to get the sandwich, to the extent that the rest of our party was pretty much finished eating by time I got my food.

In a nutshell, this is a casual restaurant that features wood fired pizzas and other Italian delicacies that can be enjoyed while your party plays one of the hundreds of table (board) games from Ludica's library of games.\\n\\nFirst, the food.  Pizza is top notch.  Thin rustic style crispy crust from the wood oven that is piled high with fresh toppings.  They have a nice variety of pizzas with many vegetarian options, classic styles, and their own game inspired creations.  The menu also included a variety of salads, appys, and pasta.  Local craft beers and Italian sodas are among the choices of beverage.  Prices are also very reasonable.  On food alone, I would rate Ludica 4 stars.\\n\\nNow, for the games.  Ludica has a lot of games.  I consider myself a bit of a game aficionado, having well over 100 games of my own and having played at least another hundred in my circle of gaming friends.  Most games that I would want to play over dinner are in the Ludica library.\\nMainstream classics like Jenga and Connect Four? Check.\\nWell known party games like Scattegories and Taboo? Check.\\nMuchkin? Check.\\nCards against Humanity? Check.\\nWhere the collection really shines though is for people like myself that prefer family strategy, euro, or modern board games.  Games like Ticket to Ride, Settlers of Catan, and Dominion.  Ludica has the games that gamers will know how to play, but I also noticed some out of print and less well known gems like Union Pacific and Ubongo. If you are reading this list of games and don't recognize anything past Taboo, that's OK.  Ludica has game stewards and stewardesses to suggest games for you and give you a quick tutorial on how to play.\\nThe added fun factor of being able to enjoy a game with friends and family instead of being distracted by TVs and smart devices is excellent and gives Ludica an extra star in my book.\\n\\nI also love the decor and little gamer touches.  Maps of Power Grid and Diplomacy framed as wall art (I want this in my game room), Carcassonne beer coasters, and Scattegories folders for bill folios.\\n\\nI wish the owners would figure out a way to squeeze in a few more tables.\\n\\nNext time you are in Vancouver and are looking for something different and fun in your evening, try Ludica."},{"name":"Great Harvest Bread Company","address":"8926 SE Sunnyside Rd","city":"Clackamas","stars":"4.5","text":"Every time that I have been in here (except the other morning, but I'll chalk that off to her not being awake yet) the staff has been super friendly, helpful and cheerful - all the things that you want when you're spending your hard-earned cash on a sandwich, some chips and a cookie. The box lunch is $8.50 and not worth it unless you like sun chips and carrots, which I do not.

Our first time it was a novelty and the meal was good enough to not detract from the fun time we had. It wasn't very memorable to be honest. \\n\\nThis time around it was wholly disappointing. Jiko draws much of its appeal and charm from being an \\"extremely authentic\\" African dining experience, as our waiter put it. And therein lies the first of a handful of major problems. \\n\\nThe restaurant boasted of how many employees they had that were born and raised in Africa, and that this made their food increasingly authentic. This seemed charming and promising as we were introduced to a young and witty employee that had only spent a month or so in the USA. He told us stories of the application process for the Disney exchange program, and he said he was leaving to get our drinks and Jiko pulled a bait and switch on us. We looked up from the menu a moment later expecting to see the charming young South African man only to be greeted by a brusque and pushy waiter from \\"New Yawk.\\" After a confused scan of the rest of the restaurant, it became obvious that the only African staff present were the hosts and the busboys/girls. \\n\\nAn expensive restaurant such as this shouldn't rush you because a luxurious dining experience moves along at a measured pace, letting the customers savor the experience. Instead the New Yawk waiter who tapped in for the South African \\"waiter\\" was surprisingly unpleasant and rushed us.\\n\\nThe waiter that Jiko substituted for us would have been right at home at a diner in NYC, pushy and intolerant of anybody wanting to take their time with their meal or curious about the specials. \\n\\nThe food was disturbingly hit or miss for a restaurant with such high ratings and prices. I had the halibut and it was the size of the slice of Kraft American cheese--about 4\\" x4\\" on top of a bed of cold, undercooked vegetables which were tasteless. \\n\\nThe short ribs were delicious as was the lamb. I gave it two stars instead of one because the entrees that were palatable were very good. The chicken and cous cous had so much cinnamon that it was inedible and my fianc√© had to send it back. I genuinely think the lid may have come off the cinnamon container in the kitchen. Totally inedible. When it came back it was much better but the chicken was strangely cooked both times. Slimy in some places and dry in others.\\n\\nOverall it was a disappointing experience. Once the novelty of the \\"extremely authentic\\" cuisine and staff quickly wore off, the ill-prepared food reared its ugly head and the experience never recovered. If you're not using the Disney Dining plan, steer clear of the Russian Roulette of miniscule entrees that all cost $45+.\\n\\ntl;dr Very expensive. Terrible value. Jiko's novelty wore off quickly due to cold food that was, in separate cases, tasteless and over-seasoned to the point of being inedible. We ordered five entrees: all were very small (especially for being $45+), two tasted good, two were cold and tasteless, and one had enough cinnamon to make my fianc√© gag and cough and send the dish back. I genuinely think the lid came off the cinnamon container on her food.

The best part is, the new soups taste just as good as the previous soups, so they are not introducing new items just to introduce them. ( Are you following me?) Okay, Their sandwiches don't change quite a bit, but that's fine, because each one is quite addictive, especially the Chipotle Chicken. Now... time to talk about the surroundings.. so the busyness really depends on the time you arrive. If you want to avoid the crying babies, and huge line, then you probably don't want to go on Saturday or Sunday from about 11-1. Otherwise, its a calm atmosphere and a great place to have a meeting or get work done. It's also very clean! Now onto the service... they are exceptional.. if you are a regular, they welcome you by name, and if not, the cashiers do their best to make the customer feel 'at home'.

The Yu Hsiang eggplant is a fantastic dish for those who love veggies and carnivores alike. The staff is incredibly accommodating as well, and willing to go above and beyond to make your meal perfect. The take out is just as good as sitting down and eating there, too.

We also had the salamme plate at the table but it wasn't salame... it was a finely shaved pork loin that my husband loved.  \\n\\nFor the meal I ordered the Garganelli with braised duck.  It was very good!  I thought it may have sat under a heat lamp for just a a minute or two too long as the pasta had just started to dry around the edges.

It has been a favourite restaurant of mine for the 10 years I've lived in Austin. \\n\\nThat said....Last Friday, I had a supremely disappointing experience there.  Normally - If I were to have a bad experience somewhere for the first time in 10 years I wouldn't necessarily give it a bad review.  In fact, this is my very first time to even use Yelp to post a negative review.\\n\\nChez Nous - you have driven me to do this & I would love for you to contact me personally so that I can continue to feel good about coming to your restaurant.\\n\\nMy Husband & I are not regulars at Chez Nous - we spend time there for Special Occasions about 4x a year...and when I say spend time, I also mean that we spend money...a lot of money.  We have celebrated many anniversaries, birthdays & the like there, and Chez Nous holds a sentimental place in our hearts.\\n\\nLast Friday was our anniversary.  Chez Nous was busy as usual but we were seated promptly & sat down to enjoy what should have been a wonderful meal.  The first sign that all was not well was that we were not greeted or offered anything other than water for at least 10 minutes,  They were busy,,,we understood.  We flagged a waiter down & ordered appetizers & entrees from the menu.\\n\\nThe appetizers were fabulous.  However, when our entrees arrived...they were not.  We ordered Veal Sweetbreads & Sea Bass.  Both were extremely overcooked.  To add insult to injury our vegetables were stone cold.  We ate a couple of bites, and waited patiently for someone to ask about our food.  Two people came by & asked us if they could box it up.  We said no & before we could say anything else - they were off to other tables.  We finally decided to wave someone down.  We are not waivers.  \\n\\nOnce we explained the situation to someone - they sent the manager or hostess (couldn't tell) over to talk to us.  She explained to us that our entrees were pan sauteed...twice.  Now I don't want to get haughty or anything but my husband & I have prepared both of these dishes on our own and know a little something about French cooking techniques.  Let's just say that if Julia Child were alive, we would stalk her.\\n\\nWe told the manager/hostess that we understood that cooking technique and asked that she literally touch our food so that she could see that both dishes were inedible.  At that point, she took both plates away & put them in the window (I assume the dish window) and suggested we move on to dessert.  She was kind enough to offer a \\"discount\\" on our food.\\n\\nWe moved onto dessert and another glass of wine and all was well until we got the bill.  Her idea of a discount was $10.  We decided to write a note on the back of the bill to explain to her that this was \\"laughable\\" since we paid $25+ for each entree and had not eaten them.  She saw us writing the note and came over to our table.\\n\\nThis is where it gets interesting folks.  I explained that I was \\"in the industry\\" and understood mistakes & busy nights.  She asked me what I would have done in this situation.  I said that I would have comped the food & at least brought the situation to the attention to the chef.  She said that the Chef was busy and that they couldn't just go around comping everyone's food.\\n\\nThat said...my husband & I were done.  We paid our $150 bill and tipped out the nose as usual.

If you don't have little kids, you can stop reading here. We had a quick treat the first weekend they opened, and my son eagerly anticipated a visit for high tea with Grandma for his 5th birthday a month later.  (He's a rooibos fanatic.)\\n\\nIf the visit hadn't been so eagerly anticipated, we would have gone somewhere else as soon as they told us they had no high chair or booster for my younger son, a 20 month old.  But a promise is a promise, so we tried to stick it out.  I ended up spending the whole 45 minutes trying to keep my (normally very well-behaved) toddler from grabbing the bone china, climbing on the table, standing on the velvet-covered chair, or climbing off the chair to make a run for it.  This is not a wild child; he's so well-mannered in a high chair that strangers often comment on it.\\n\\nI fully understand that there are some restaurants to which one just doesn't take a young child, and I respect that.  But Neverland has a Peter Pan theme, a chest full of kids' costumes, a list of recommended teas for kids, and even a kid's high tea on the menu.  I sincerely wish that if they ONLY wanted to attract older children, that they would have given some hint of that on their website or store front, rather than tempting us in for an unpleasant experience.  This is honestly the first place I've found in Vancouver that doesn't even have a booster seat.\\n\\nSo here is that message to parents of young kids - Neverland is wonderful for anyone old enough to not need a high chair or booster seat.  If you have a child younger than that, this isn't a good place for you.  Or at least bring your own travel booster and ignore the fact that they didn't really want to accommodate little kids.\\n\\nSadly, we won't be returning.  But I will still be dreaming of their wonderful teas list and gluten free brownies."},{"name":"Ah-Ma's Taiwanese Kitchen","address":"931 Monroe Dr, Ste A-108","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Ah-Ma is not a place I would normally eat at, because I'm not really into trendy food places, but I came here to meet a friend for lunch. \\n\\nI waived on eating anything not either vegetarian or pescetarian, so there weren't too many dishes to chose from. All the good items I would have ordered contained pork, so know that if you don't eat pork you may want to go elsewhere. \\n\\nI ordered the pickled vegetables which came in two separate bowls, (one pickled cucumbers and the other pickled daikon and carrots), a shirmp bao, and a vegetable bao. \\n\\nSadly the pickled vegetables were the highlight of the food chose. I don't know if I had high expectations from reading the Yelp reviews on the vegetable bao, but I was disappointed in it. The bao itself was nice, but the flavor of the tofu and veggies inside did not stand out for me. The shrimp bao was better than the vegetable bao, but it reminded me more of a petite bo'boy than a food item I would have gotten off the streets of Taiwan (which is what I thought this was what Ah-Ma was going for) and relished. \\n\\nService was okay. The waiter was patient with my many questions, but I did notice one of the servers took our empty jar of water and never returned. But other than that, no complaints. \\n\\nI might make a return visit one day if there was a reason for me to be on this side of town, but only to see if their beef noodle stands up to others I've had in Atlanta. Otherwise I don't think I would make a return visit for the food alone, because the flavors of the baos I did order did not wow my palate at all.

We ordered the boar ribs, a quail \\"Moroccan tortilla,\\" olives, calamari, the cheese plate, and a bottle of Rioja.  The boar ribs were tender and the meat was falling off the bone, but the sauce was so strong that it overpowered the flavor of the meat.  The quail tortilla was topped with some greens and a vinagerette.  The vinagerette  was the only taste I got in most of my bites of this dish, which was a shame because the highlight of the dish based on the menu's description was the quail.  The olives were good.  The calamari was inedible.  Not only was it ultra greasy, but it had little to no flavor and was unusually tough.  Likely, frozen product that was in the freezer too long.  The cheese plate was good as was the bottle of wine.  In summary, everything that was a creation of Fino was severely lacking for a restaurant in its price range and supposed sophistication.

And that's pretty much all I would expect from a huge, chain grocery store.\\n\\nThey stock pretty much all the standards for a typical grocery store but drop the ball with their lack of \\"specialty\\" items, especially when it comes to Asian foods. But at the same time, there are more then a few shops only a couple of blocks away where you can pick up those type of things.\\n\\nThe produce isn't the greatest and can be on the pricey side, usually due to the fact they truck in a lot of off season veggies from places like Mexico. However, once again, that's easily remedied by walking down the block to one of the corner markets.\\n\\nDeli wise, you get what you pay for. If you want really great olives, cheeses or meats, head to the Cardero Bottega or Capers. If you're not willing to spend a little extra then the Safeway deli is okay for your day to day cured ham needs.\\n\\nMy biggest issue with the store has to be the lack-luster seafood section. For a city that can boast some of the best fresh, local seafood the selection at Safeway is incredibly sparse and well, just plain sad. It's Spot Prawn season, but not one to be found in their cooler.  No live mussels, scallops, or crab and they still carry farmed-fish that I don't want anything to do with. Why can I not find a decent fishmonger in the West End?\\n\\nCons aside, they're open early and close late.

If you go, get the gnocchi (perfect texture if I ever had a perfect gnocchi) and spaghetti.  We ate so much, that we had to roll our ways out of the restaurant because it was just so delicious!\\n\\nThe server was so good too!  It was really busy that night, and we always felt like we had what we needed.  The decor was really cute too between teh pressure gauges (I am an engineer so appreciate that) and the copper pots.  \\n\\nDid I mention this was affordable too?  This is probably half the price of similar (maybe lower actually) quality food I've had in Cincinnati. \\n\\nIf I somehow walked out of here loving ravioli and cannolini, I think this would be a definite 5 star.  For sure, the gnocchi and spaghetti were top-notch and at that level though."},{"name":"Habibi Restaurant","address":"1012 SW Morrison St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Amazing service and amazing food!

The food was amazing, the people were so nice, and the drinks...the drinks were great! They had this giant glass...GIANT pint (dont remember the word for it) for their micro beer, and it was all fantasic. They have 6 different kinds besides their seasonal types. We've tried all of the normal 6 and they were all great. The hefeweizen is my husbands favorite here. \\n\\nWe went home the next morning, and for the next couples of months couldnt stop thinking about the city and Gordon Biersch; you know youve found a gem when weeks after eating someplace it creeps back up and you're stuck craving their food. We live 8 hours away from Columbus, so we knew the chances werent that great. In the end we eneded up going back 3 months later to re visit the city, and of course, to re visit GB. We had so much fun the first time, we wanted to see it again. Also, my husband was applying to jobs and decided he would put in a few applications in for the Columbus area so we needed to go check it out again and see if we still liked the area. \\n\\nSo naturally when we came to town we had to stop here again and see if this place was really that good, or if our memories were just enhanced because we had such a great time.\\n\\nThis time the wait was an hour, almost 1.5hrs. The food was still great, but not as good as I remembered. When I first came to Columbus the people would tell you that their food is good but you'd brush them off like \\"yeah yeah..food..good, yeah I know\\" but seriously...Columbus knows how to cook! I was such awe stuck being from the east coast that when I came here at first, GB was teh only upscale place we went out to eat at, so naturally, the food was amazing on top of already being fantastic. Columbus knows how to cook, so great food as a base plus being gormet and having better chefs = AMAZING FOOD!\\n\\nAs for what the locals say:\\nEveryone says the same thing about what to get: garlic fries and the shrimp & lobster tacos. We got the garlic fries (which are a must!) as an app both times. I had the shrimp & lobster tacos with black beans both times and it just as good the second time. My husband got the ahi tuna wrap the second time around and it was ok. We general sample each other plates so we can get a feel for the different foods at a place. I've never had cooked ahi tuna before, only ever having it seared (basicaly raw), so it was a bit strange. It lost all of its 'ahi-nes'. The garlic fries....oh the garlic fries! It's such a treat that I would come here just for those fries. Delicious! Simple food always tastes better then the uppity stuff; not that uppity isnt good, but you cant beat the basics. \\nDessert- we shared the bread pudding. Also very good. Make sure you give them notice for this since it takes so long to cook. Also, it's worth noting that I dropped a star for this place for a couple of things. 1-the oversized beer pints werent there the 2nd time  around and 2-the food didnt 'wow' us the second time. we will go back. of course we will. but this isnt a place you can go to all the time. its expensive, the wait is long, and its better left as a gem, not a regular hang out. \\n\\nAlso it needs to be noted that they sell beer to go. you buy a container/keg and they fill it. You go home..drink...take it back, and they refill it for a smal fee. You cant beat that!

I decided it would be good to try a variety to test out their abilities with the cuisine. The potstickers were overly fried, almost black and greasy, not the most appetizing looking or tasting. The Tom Yum, while citrusy, had only one note and that was flat. The Pad Pak veggie stir fry was just that, veggies with a terribly bland sauce that made all the vegetables taste boring.The Pad Se Eew, had almost all broccoli and not much noodles, the sauce was flat and was the high point of the food. We also tried the special of the night, Pumpkin Curry, one of my favs, and what we got was coconut milk soup wit a splash of curry flavor tossed with a bunch of overcooked pumpkin. It was not even close to edible so we tossed it out. We spent $50 for this sub par Thai food and I personally felt ripped off.

Reservations at Be Our Guest are some of the most highly sought after plans at the entire resort, and people will compulsively check daily (or hourly) for reservations to open up. (I'm guilty of this myself.) Is Be Our Guest worth the insane hype built around it?\\n\\nConditionally, I would say yes.\\n\\nOn our recent trip, I had managed after many days of checking online, to grab a lunch reservation for myself and two of my close friends. I hopped on this chance, and immediately did my research on how to make this experience the best that we could make it. Here's your best bet - go online, preorder your food in advance, and upon entering the restaurant, the food will \\"magically\\" find its way to your table - pretty cool!\\n\\nAnyway, let's break down the experience from entry to exit. Even though this is considered a \\"quick service\\" meal at lunch, truth be told, you absolutely should place reservations. This place will be at full capacity, period. If you don't have reservations, you will be waiting a long time for a table. You will proceed to the front area outside of the restaurant and check in. They'll wave you through to the front waiting area, where they will call you within a 15 minute period of your reservation, in general. You'll go in, pay for your order, and be allowed to make your way to a table. At lunch, this is open seating.\\n\\nThe interior is really the selling point of this place. It's breathtaking. The attention to detail is mesmerizing, and you really do feel a part of the movie. There are three main dining areas, each with a different scene to focus the decor on.

We had made late afternoon reservations, and having arrived on time, were seated promptly.  Everything went downhill thereafter.  We (3 adults and 2 6 yr old children) ordered tradtional Thanksgiving Dinners offered at the top of the menu. We also ordered two salads to be served with the dinner and a bottle of wine.  We waited for 1 hr and 10 min for the dinner to arrive and when it was served there were 2 plates with white turkey meat and 3 with dark meat despite the fact that everyone requested dark meat.  One of the diners had declined the roasted brussel sprouts but when the plates arrived there were brussel sprouts on her plate but on no one elses! Broccoli had been substituted without asking!  One of the plates had no pan gravy and the rum butter sauce was missing from the baked sweet potato on that same plate. The two salads we had ordered never arrived. After we had finished eating dinner, we waited for another 10 min before the plates were cleared and we were offered desert--either pumpkin or pecan pie. One of the diners had ordered a Lava Cake as requested when the dinner order was taken.  Although we were assured it was \\"ready\\" when we ordered the other desserts, we waited an additional 15 minutes after dinner for the deserts to arrive.  And then, it was drier and more crumbly than expected. Two of us ordered coffee with dessert and that arrived promptly but without a utensil for stirring it!  When I asked our server if I was expected to stir it with my finger, she promptly returned with one spoon for me, but none for my wife! The food itself was \\"okay\\" after it was finally properly plated (i.e. gravy for the turkey, butter rum sauce for the sweet potato) but except for the price, there was little to distinguish it from a Thanksgiving Dinner that we might have had at Denny's.  The chef did come and listen to us and he apologized for all the errors and there was mutual agreement that we would only pay half of the original bill.  Although that helped assuage our disappointment and frustration, I'm not sure if we will ever dine at a Chart House again."},{"name":"Red and Green Brazilian Steakhouse","address":"5979 Buford Hwy NE, Ste B1","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"I took my date here because of a Groupon that I bought.

Later, a different waitress was asked this by another table and she told them they serve lunch on the weekdays but that they will serve it on weekends when the kinks get worked out.

There were specials offered but they are only written on a blackboard near the front of the restaurant above the counter and the waitress didn't reiterate them to us so we were unsure what they were. \\n\\nI ordered the polish special (kielbasa, 2 eggs scrambled, home fries, and 2 slices of wheat toast). It was a large portion, although the peice of sausage was a typical bratwurst size piece. The home fries were tasty and had nice seasoning. The bread was basic Wonder Bread-esque, nothing fancy. The eggs had no seasoning on them but were good when I added salt and pepper. \\n\\nMy husband ordered the hash and cheese omelet and was quite impressed that the hash was homemade and not from a can.

This is my first ever yelp review, so god knows this was traumatic.  When one visits the city of Boston, two major things come to mind.  1.) Ben Affleck, and 2.) Fresh and vibrant seafood.  On the menu, there is a section labeled as \\"fresh fish.\\" And at $38 for the Ahi tuna entre, one would believe that a seafood restaurant on the water in SeaPort, Boston would, at the very least serve a fresh tuna.  I ordered my tune seared, of course, and to my utter disappointment, the tuna was cooked almost a quarter of the way through.  Not a huge deal honestly.  What was truly disappointing was the fact that it was noticeably pre frozen tuna.  The flakes of the tuna were basically glued together, and to anyone who knows tuna, this is a common occurrence for tuna to react like that after a considerable amount of time being frozen.  So yeah, tuna was sub par to say the least.  But oh my good lord the desert.  I am fully aware that the chart house is better known for their chocolate lava cake *baked to order*,  but I am a creme br√ªl√©e man through and through.  If a restaurant has creme br√ªl√©e, I order it, and it just so happened that the chart house offered not one, not two, BUT THREE different creme br√ªl√©e's for their sample platter.  I was hyped.  Maybe the chart house could blow me away with some interesting interpretations of creme br√ªl√©e.  Well this ladies and gentlemen is the real reason I decided to pop my yelp cherry.  The creme br√ªl√©e was straight up pudding.  Like they actually put pudding in a cup, put a blow torch to it, and served me torched pudding thinking I'd be none the wiser.

The food was not as exciting. Some of the ingredients were good and it seemed like the passion was there. But there were just a few too many basic things done wrong. The paella was burnt. It was also black and apparently supposed to be stuck to the pan, so when I pointed the burnt element out to the waiter he said it was intentional. I doubt it. It had a strong burnt flavor at the bottom and thus, instead of enhancing the variety of textures the diner experiences as described, led the diner to avoid the bottom half of the dish. The paella was also way too salty. And would have been ridiculously priced had we not intentionally come on half-priced paella night.

It is located in between 5th and 6th on Neches in a small, quaint building, so it is best to get reservations! They have a wonderful dinner prix fix menu for $30 that is well worth it. I went here last Friday night to celebrate my graduation from UT with my family and I'm so glad I chose to go to this place. The service is excellent and the staff is very friendly and helpful. There were 6 of us and we had a reservation right at 6 PM, when they open for dinner. We started off with a delicious Cabernet and bread and butter. We ordered a cheese plate as an appetizer and it was absolutely delicious. I highly recommend it! We all decided to do the 3 course prix fix menu and you get a choice of soup, salad, or pate for the first course. I went with the soup, which was a potato leak, and I tried some of the pate, which was delicious! The salads looked excellent as well and came with an egg on top. For the main course you could choose between hangar steak, fish, and another type of protein. Our entire table chose the hangar steak and it was absolutely delicious. It was accompanied by a garlic butter sauce, fried crispy shallots, and a cauliflower souffl√©, that was out of this world. The steak was cooked perfectly and had wonderful flavor. For dessert you could choose between chocolate mousse, custard, profiteroles, or pay $2 more and get anything else off the dessert menu. I decided to go with the creme br√ªl√©e, which was an excellent choice. We finished off the dinner with another bottle of Cabernet and coffee, making for a very wonderful dinner and it is a perfect place for a fun and classy atmosphere in downtown Austin.

The last carbonara I had was at CinCin, while that was good, it was too much like alfredo and a bit clumpy. This carbonara was smooth, and decidedly tasted smokey and of raw egg yolk.

They were delicious perfectly sweet and the sausage had great flavor, it was juicy. For 6$ you get 6 mini corn dogs, great value. The waitress also dropped off complimentary pork rinds which were also good, a little heavy on the seasoning but that's just my opinion. They have a lunch special my friend got with a smoked turkey sandwich and fries for 9.99. I wanted to try everything I went with a combo plate with ribs, moist(fatty) brisket , sweet potato souffl√© and a side salad with black pepper honey vinaigrette. Let's do sides first. The side salad was good and well portioned but the dressing... The black pepper flavoring was very apparent almost overpowering. I probably will go with a cherry vinaigrette next time. The sweet potato souffl√© was amazing. Really good, not sure what was ok top but it complimented well. The brisket was great and I didn't feel guilty about getting the fatty one. The ribs were good but I only ate one and packed the rest up to go. My friend finished with the chocolate custard pie. I tried literally one bite and it was almost too rich to eat.

One of the meats was a little chewy, but I'll chalk that up to the place only being open two days when we ate there.

About 10 minutes in a bowl of us on that I ordered showed up, then 4 fried items (ordered 8 prawn tempura but only 3 came, mentioned it to the waitress and she followed up, about the only good thing here are some of the serving staff), and one oyster motoyaki, then absolutely nothing.  \\n\\nMeanwhile the other tables' orders came slowly but something showed up (though a lot of people were saying some orders weren't right) we had ordered some nigiri and sashimi, some cooked items, and a few items on their B menu, which has more sashimi.  \\n\\nBy the time I had wondered where the rest of the food was, the tables next to us were paying the bill and leaving, and we still didn't have our food, this was about the hour mark by now. We followed up on it and they checked, and then suddenly a few nigiri and a couple of pieces of BC roll showed up, as if someone suddenly remembered, then they came to ask us whether we got everything we ordered.  We told them no we had ordered way more than that.  Then at that point I said we've waited for an hour or more (I put in 75 mins of parking, and by then there were 28 minutes left), and that if the food wasn't even coming and nobody had bothered to put the orders in there was no point.  The waitress offered to give us ice cream for free but by then both of us had no appetite.\\n\\nWe got up to leave and pay the bill (by the way the table next to us, mostly older gentlemen, had told us the service was crap and that for that kind of service we shouldn't even pay the bill), since we did end up eating something. I got the bill and it was for the full 58 something (tax included). I basically told the manager/owner(?) that for near none of the food showing up and then only a bit when reminded was terrible service even for this kind of establishment.  I get it if you order and it's busy a few orders may get missed but this is ridiculous! The manager then said your order's been put in! And showed me her screen. Both of us pointed out that most of the items on the list did not even come.  She then said, there's nothing I can do (not my call is what she said) and I said well I'm not paying 60 dollars for this kind of shitty service and that kind of attitude.  Begrudgingly she dropped it to half (so for that experience we still paid 30).  \\n\\nI've been to this place before and liked it since it was cheap and cheerful, with a decent variety of food.

You would think that would mean that there is very little to expect in the way of novelty.\\n\\nYou'd be wrong.\\n\\nLike every ABP, there is at least one quirky quality to the place that makes it stick out in my memory.  Two in this case.\\n\\nOne, the young, gay Brazilian employee who shamelessly hit on me, which boosted my ego no end.  I took it as a compliment because gay men have high standards and he came from a country of beautiful people.  Double compliment.  Maybe he was lonely.\\n\\nHe was cold at first but when I started making conversation with him, he opened up immediately.  I knew he was hitting on me when he started giving me small coffees on the house and the other staff members smiled at me as if they were enjoying a private joke.  I didn't mind.  I only hoped that one of my coworkers didn't walk in and witness this impromptu date.\\n\\nThe employees at this ABP are pretty good in general.  Because they're tending to the lawyers and bankers of Boston and facing considerable volume, they come across as better trained than employees at college campus ABPs.  The latter get to be lazy and unfriendly because ABPs aren't as popular near college campuses as they are in the financial district.  The consistently good service makes a difference to me, hence the four-star rating.\\n\\nThe second unique feature of this ABP is that it was probably designed by someone who previously worked for the CIA.  It's a subterranean joint and the bathroom is in a passageway at the very back of the restaurant.  You need to get a huge dungeon key from the staff to unlock the bathroom door.  Just to be clear, that's a total of two heavy doors, one locked, that you have to get through before you can even think of unbuckling.  I've met actual FBI agents with lower clearance levels than this crapper.\\n\\nSo why is this significant?  This is a bad place to run into if you're doing the you-rin dance.  The cashiers don't bend the rules for anyone so you have to buy something before they hand you the key.  They're worse than actual feds.  You could be creating a puddle of homemade lemonade right under the bananas but the stern mami at the register will just glare at you before hissing at you in Spanglish to clean it up with your receipt.\\n\\nBut, that aside, this is a decent place to grab a quick bite at one of the tables while looking out at the legs of hard-working people.  It's an equally great place to grab something on the go.  You get a piece of parchment paper with practically every purchase so you can munch on your palmiere on the way back to the office.\\n\\nI wouldn't recommend it for studying because of the flurry of activity during peak hours.  It is, however, a great place to get work done.  For the most part, you're surrounded by other nine-to-fivers with work on their minds and that always rubbed off on me when I was preparing work for the next day.  \\n\\nDates.  It's not good for a casual date but great if you've managed to dodge all the HR hurdles and get an attractive coworker to grab lunch with you.  If you've got your wandering eye on the new associate but you don't want to seem too forward, this ABP has the perfect atmosphere and crowd to make it seem like you're being friendly without an impending game of grab-ass on your mind.  \\n\\nI have only male coworkers so I can't speak from experience but my friends in HR tell me that asking a coworker out to a bar right away is a bad idea.  Beer is the shortcut on the way to grab-ass.  And grab-ass is a one-way route to being labeled the office pervert.  It's not 1950 anymore.  For an ABP with a 50s atmosphere, go to the one in Davis Square.\\n\\nI have one final word.  If you get a sandwich made at the counter, it'll be fresh but largely bland unless you get cream cheese on it.  Instead, go with one of the prepackaged sandwiches on the chilled shelves near the fruits.  They're better for you and they taste better too.  I can't say this about all the ABPs but this branch has decent prepackaged food."},{"name":"Tim Hortons","address":"1085 Hill Rd N","city":"Pickerington","stars":"1.5","text":"Newly remodeled, this place looks fantastic!

During the summer, they usually have a lavender latte, which is probably my favorite coffee-based drink I've ever had anywhere. The lavender syrup they use perfectly captures lavender's balanced floral yet herbal taste, and the flavor works surprisingly well with coffee. The other day, I stopped in and grabbed a maple latte. I've had this combination elsewhere, but Crema's maple latte has a deep, almost smoky flavor that again pairs perfectly with the coffee. In general, Crema's coffee is neither the strongest nor the most flavorful that I've ever had, but it's still an enjoyable cup of coffee.\\n\\nCrema Cafe also has a solid sandwich and salad selection. I almost always order the sweet potato sandwich, and one of my friends loves their root vegetable salad (though we're not crazy about the Thai peanut salad). The pastries are a bit hit-or-miss - they're generally on the sweeter side and towards the end of the day, they become quite dry.\\n\\nThe staff are generally friendly, and the food and drinks come out at a reasonable pace.\\n\\nAs others have pointed out, Crema Cafe is not a good study spot. It is a popular place to grab a salad/sandwich and chat, but as a result, it's usually quite noisy. They also do not have free WiFi, and there always seem to be people circling around looking for a place to sit. There is a reason that Crema Cafe has stayed a fixture in the notoriously high-turnover Harvard Square food scene - a decently varied and well-executed drink and food menu, friendly staff, and a convivial atmosphere make Crema a solid go-to in Harvard Square."},{"name":"Zyka","address":"1677 Scott Blvd","city":"Decatur","stars":"4","text":"While they have some weird rules regarding take out this place is still hands down our favorite for take out Indo/Pak fix.

They have a banquet hall they rent out for events so sometimes it can get a bit noisy but the food more than makes up for all that.

These visits have ranged from nice to mediocre in the past, which is why we visited last night.\\n\\nMy man surprised me for my 30th by bringing me to Solea with about 30 of my closest friends. After dinner, it was only natural to walk somewhere else with the 20 of us that remained. We had been to Watch City before so why not grab some brews . We walked in on a Saturday night and there were, at best, 5 other patrons in the entire restaurant. We thought it would be great to get more drinks and just enjoy ourselves a little bit longer. \\n\\nThere was plenty of room for us to take up a corner to mingle and get drinks from the bar. The waitress insisted we sit at tables she set up, which made it harder to mingle, but we weren't going to let this ruin our time.  Though we we were not getting food, the waitress seemed annoyed with us, though I don't know why. We weren't rowdy, we weren't obnoxiously drunk; we just wanted a couple beers, so maybe we were a bit overwhelming because there were so many of us... but I thought that was about 20 + beers which was good business for them when they were obviously dead when we walked in.\\n\\nThey have a jukebox (I love jukeboxes) and since we were pretty much the only people in there, we wanted to play some tunes. I asked the bartender to turn on the jukebox and he jokingly said that I would be turning off his music. Oh, well I would only be playing a couple songs. I played what I wanted, and some of the music was BAD, like only people in our group could appreciate the music, BAD... but since we were basically the only ones in there, we didn't think it mattered. When my sister went to put more money in the jukebox, the \\"brewmaster\\" approached my sister in a completely inappropriate way. He said that he was the brewmaster and that he would pay my sister not to play any more songs, then touched her arm very creepily. She noted that he smelled like he himself had been drinking and said to him, admittedly with an attitude, that if he was the brewmaster, he would get her the beer she had been waiting a half hour for and that they would have treated us nicer when we arrived. She also noted  we were a large party bringing business in on a Saturday night that was slow for them. She also mentioned it was my birthday and they were trying to make it special for me. He seemed annoyed at this and asked if we had called ahead with a big party (reminder: there was no one else in the bar) and she said she didn't think we would have to just to get some drinks. He, no lie, said \\"Any restaurant would act like this\\"... really? I don't think so.\\n\\nSo this had me peeved... we just want to finish our night right and have some fun. Why would you have a jukebox, with the music choices on it if you have no intention of letting people play it? Then when you do play it, you are made to feel like a jackass for it.  To boot, we were never asked if we wanted more beers, the check was simply tossed at us and the waitress was cleaning up around us despite it still being an hour until they closed. She stood a chance at a really nice tip from our large party (which I suspect is why she put us at tables instead of letting us mingle) but it seemed like she could have cared less, rather I think they actually tried to make us feel bad for wanting to hang out there. One manager type woman did approach us and said that she knew that the brewmaster didn't like our music but that she did and she appreciated it. I thought that was nice, but really, should she have even had to backpeddle for him?\\n\\nIt will be a long time before I go back to Watch City with any types of expectations at all.

Grilled steak served on a toasted brioche bun with lettuce, onions, and tomatoes and horseradish cream with fries on the side. Here is where mission fell short for me. The amount of steak compared to the size of my brioche bun was just not right. I had maybe 4 slices of steak and this huge bun that just ruined the experience. Every bite was bun and lettuce/tomatoes. The steak was lost and the entire sandwich was just bad. I ended up discarding most of my bun to even out the ratio and get a more fulfilling bite but it was just not worth it. There is a photo from another reviewer here that depicts a picture of a really tiny burger sitting on this massive bun and I had jokingly said this is what I am gonna get, I guess they heard me because I got exactly that; a massive bun and 4 slices of meat... \\n\\nI'm not sure if I would come back here."},{"name":"wagamama - prudential","address":"800 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"If you want greasy and salty americanized asian food, this is the place to eat.

This one was highly enjoyable! I would like to mention that I like my lattes a little on the stronger side, and this one was not the strongest I have ever had. However, the amount of strength was good, the level of acidity was great. What makes this special is what they add, honey and cinnamon. \\n\\nHoney added just the absolutely perfect amount of sweetness. I did not feel that the latte was over-sweet, nor did I feel it could have used some sugar. \\n\\nCinnamon is a curious spice, it adds tremendous flavor, but it is very easy to overdo it. Too much cinnamon and everything is completely overwhelmed. That said, the amount of cinnamon was absolutely perfect. There was enough that it added some taste to the latte, but there was no so much that any part of the other flavors were drowned out. \\n\\nNow The Sammy... while I liked it overall, there are a few point of improvement I would like to suggest that would make it perfect. The ingredients themselves were great, they were fresh and generally pretty tasty, and the salt level was awesome\\n\\nI have a couple criticisms though. \\n\\nFirst, the house-made muffin seemed to be sourdough that was, well a little on the sour side.

The bar is just a kick-ass bar, period. Great bar with good, knowledgeable bartenders and a great selection of whiskeys - good selection of beer. So obviously, the 3-star rating is not for the bar, but the restaurant.\\nI had been here for a beer once or twice and looked at the menu for the restaurant. I was very intrigued by the creativity of the menu. They use alot of organ meat and unique ingredients in general. I love great creativity in cooking and it's very difficult to sell \\"Crispy Tripe\\" and other such items to the general populous, so I figured it must be spectacular and knew I had to try it. I finally did last night - with obvious high expectations.\\nI had the escarole salad and Cornish Hen with Brussels Sprouts. I've eaten and cooked alot of Cornish Hens in my life. It was the standard for Thanksgiving dinner in my house growing-up and I was looking forward to it. The salad had a pretty cool description on the menu but ended-up being nothing more than escarole with a basic Caesar's dressing and grated cheese. Other than the lemon I detected in it, it was basic-basic. Nothing at all to get excited about. OK, fine. So I wrote that off and thought I should have ordered a different starter, and was really looking forward to the main dish. The main dish took awhile to come out. If I had been in a hurry it would have been an irritation. Thankfully I wasn't. When the food finally came I have to say it was mediocre at best. The Brussels Sprouts were the best thing on the plate, and they were pretty oily. The hen was cooked right, but was just simply not very good. There was a noticeable taste to it that I couldn't place. I thought it might have been that the bird was old, and that may be it - but I honestly don't know, so I hate to assert that it was that reason, but I'm being honest about how it tasted. I saw someone else on Yelp comment that the Cornish Hen was the best they ever had, and I have to think that it was a one-off experience for me, but even still the seasonings and sides were just simply not that astounding. To me, if you want to step outside the culinary norms and be tremendously creative, you need to knock it out of the park -- and they simply did not. Salad, one beer, entree = $39. Hmmm.

They did comp the spring rolls which I did appreciate and that is another reason you get 2 stars instead of 1.

We eventually went up & ordered our food.\\nAnother family comes in & was told to have a seat, handed a menu & the same lady who told us to order at the bar, came over to take their order.  The kicker here is they were NOT asked for a credit card!

Places like these discuss me.\\n------------------------------------\\nUpdate: Jenni, the owner, contacted me the day after my Yelp posting. This is always a good sign that the business cares enough to read their reviews & answer concerns. \\n\\nBasically after remembering she was the one who requested my husband put his credit card on file her reply was:\\n-some patrons in the past skipped out on the bill\\n-credit cards are requested when you order an alcoholic beverage \\n-they don't have a policy set in stone on how to have customers place their orders because some can not physically come to the bar\\n-patrons who came in after us were regulars\\n\\nMy reply:\\n-the other table ordered 2 beers\\n-did we look like the 'types' that would not pay our bill, if so why\\n-both table patrons were physically capable of ordering from the bar, why were we told something different\\n-patrons were not regulars, they came in & didn't know where to sit, didn't know items on the menu & weren't even addressed by name or with any familiarity\\n\\nThe bottom line is I'm still not sure why we were given different instructions. All I know for sure is we were treated differently, we were the inter-racial family & I had to give an answer to my kids. We ate inside the restaurant not out on the patio.

You couldn't really stick the knife in it or even spread the butter on the bread. Trying to get the butter was like cutting an apple with a butter knife.

Our waitress was Kate and she couldn't have done a better job taking care of us.  We ordered a bottle of wine, and then Kate stopped back by our table to see if we'd like something to start while she got the wine for us.  We ordered a mezze plate to share.  It was very ample for two, and the spreads, olives, cheese, and pita chips were all very good.  We weren't rushed at all to get our entree orders in which is was much appreciated.  Based on Kate's recommendation, we both decided to have their signature clam bake, which was amazing.  It was served in individual dutch ovens which were piping hot, almost too hot to deal with at first, but a little patience and we were delighted at how all of the food was kept hot throughout the meal.

It wasn't memorable, there wasn't anything special about it. The second time I ordered the calamari appetizer & the steak salad. The breading on the calamari was completely bland, so I tried to help it out with a little sauce. They give you 2 sauces to choose from, the first is a milky white sauce that had virtually no flavor to it, and just reminded me of butter, and a cocktail sauce that tastes like it was made for a nursing home, in other words it had hardly any horseradish. So the calamari was a tasteless fail. Now on to the main course, the steak and bleu cheese salad. I don't know what they use to dress the greens in this salad but it must be some kind of oil. They used a ton of it, and it seemed as though my salad had been sitting in this oil for longer than it should've, because when I got it the whole thing was a soggy mess. Even the steak had a strange quality to it, as though they had seasoned it with something sweet, which really didn't add to the dish. I could only eat 1/4 of it because it was just slimy. To top it all off I was there at the peak of lunch hour & there were only 5 other diners there, this place was dead. Not to mention all of the diners were from the 65+ crew, might explain the bland food? Oh, AND the music, I'm glad I didn't stay long because their selection of music was depressing, I felt like I was in the 1940's, and not in a good way. Let's just say they played Jeepers Creepers while I was eating. Seriously? The only redeeming quality about this place is the cornbread with bits of corn in it, and well, anybody could do that."},{"name":"Sugidama Soba & Izakaya","address":"260 Elm St, Ste 106","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"On a whim, my boyfriend and I came here last night. I frequent the area fairly often and have gotten tattooed numerous times next door at Boston Tattoo Company. I always saw the place and thought it was cute and a place to possibly try. Upon entering, it wasn't busy at all with a handful of guests on a Sunday at 5PM~, we were quickly greeted and seated by the hostess. We had a friendly waitress. We definitely confused her a little bit as we shared all the food we got. We got Idako Karaage (Fried Baby Octopus), 2 Negi Pon Yakitori (Pork Belly), Kamo Nanban Hot Soba (Duck), Torch Toro Maki and Spicy Tuna Maki. \\n\\nWe were served the Idako Karaage and the Yakitori first, which was delicious. As expected, the Karaage was a bit oily so if you have a sensitive stomach for oil I wouldn't recommend eating a lot of it. The Negi Pon Yakitori was delicious. With the Ponzu Sauce, the Pork Belly had the perfect amount of flavor and was a great little snack to prepare us for our Soba and Maki. Our Soba arrived shortly after we were done with both, then the Torch Toro Maki. The Soba is made fresh there, which you can definitely tell. It was delicious with the duck's flavor with a hint of ginger which was great. The broth was very light too. It came with a chilli paste, if you wanted to add it. The Torch Toro Maki was probably one of my favorite things there. The first time I had Toro was in Hawaii as a piece of Nigiri Sushi, and I fell in love. I haven't had it since, and just like then, the Toro on top melted in my mouth and the spicy salmon on the inside had a great little kick. Personally, I could have done without the \\"rainbow\\" (Micro Herbs?) as I don't think it added too much to the experience of the roll. After we were done, we had to order a Spicy Tuna Maki (no cucumber as I don't like cucumber) and I wasn't expecting actual whole pieces of Tuna with their spicy mayo which had a giant kick to it. It was good, but not amazing. I like the Spicy Tuna Maki at other places better.\\n\\nOverall, I would definitely come back here! It has a ton of variety and everything was delicious. The atmosphere is beautiful with gorgeous wood tables and a stunning mural on the largest wall in the space.

I asked them if they used MSG, and they said no. However, just due to the sheer sodium content, I started experiencing some of the same discomfort as when I ingest MSG. The chicken was gamey and the broccoli was almost raw. I ate some of it only because I was on a tight time line for lunch. I let the waitress know that I couldn't eat anymore because it was so salty.

There really wasn't anything worth eating. We may come back some day, but at $60 for 4 people including 2 kids under 10, we'll probably just go to joes crab shack next time."},{"name":"Nuba Yaletown","address":"1206 Seymour Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"I've eaten at the different locations of Nuba over the years...the meals are nutritious but tasy and there are many vegetarian options plus if you order a dish with meat, the proportion of meat to vegetables is sensible.\\n\\nI ordered two of my go-to dishes--Najib's special (my favourite dish here) and the falafel. Both were very good as usual!\\n\\nThe thing about this location is the smaller size of the room. You order at the counter then choose a seat and your food is brought to you (they do ask for a name so maybe when it's very busy, they call for you?). I think it may be more popular for takeout than dining in. It's a mellow room but very no-frills.\\n\\nThe Gastown location is my favourite and the Mount Pleasant location is alright.

Looks like Austin needed another Mexican restaurant.  So I get to eat my words along with a great breakfast place ( some of the smoked chipolte sauce from here makes them go down easy) This location originally a KFC and then became a forgettable BBQ place and now it is a Taqueria.  With another similar restaurant only a few blocks away, why would you take a chance at the expense for a place that is only accessible from one direction?  Well to paraphrase a famous movie \\"If you build it they will come\\".  In this case the they is \\"customers\\".  Where KFC and BBQ failed...Taqueria Los Jaliscienses succeeded.  Welcome to the area!!!\\n\\nOk.  My favorite breakfast taco is a refried bean & potato with sausage. Breakfast Tacos are a daily special priced at 3 for $1.99.  This is so special that it is only on the Spanish side of the menu.  Well, I'm glad that I looked since I would not be writing this otherwise.  They really grill or fry the potatoes and not boiled or fried in such huge vats that there is no way for them to get brown.  They are tasty and crisp and golden brown not soggy and pasty white.  The sausage is a Mexican style sausage popular south of the border and not in the Southern US style of Owen's or Jimmy Dean.  Tastes more like ham but very good even if different.    Small dining area but not overly packed so that you are constantly elbowing the person in the next table of can't move away from the table without smashing into the table behind you and sending their drinks into earthquake mode.  I've not had a chance to eat more from here but this was such a surprise for me that I had to write it up now.   Now be sure to brush up your Spanish because I found only one waitress that spoke English, and it was a challenge for me to get my 3 breakfast tacos with 3 ingredients in each and not 9 tacos with only 1 ingredient in each.  Great bottomless full tilt regular coffee (no decaf).\\n\\nOh BTW:  Every breakfast did comes with 3 sauces... The one that looks like Pace (yuck) is pure fire.  The light green sauce is very mild but the best is the chipolti sauce.  As of my last few trips they are only bringing out one sauce for breakfast, luckily it is the one that I like!

We pre-selected our meals, but when we arrived they didn't have the information. I quickly scanned the menu to figure out what we had selected. We paid for our meal and were told to sit at any table. We wandered around awhile, looking for tables for two which were in short supply. We finally settled on a table for four.  After sitting for a while, we realized that we had to get our own drinks, napkins and silverware. It didn't take too long before someone showed up with our meals (I assume they located us with our magic bands). We shared the roast beef sandwich and the croque Monsieur, both came with fries.  The roast beef was good, but it was far from served warm.  The croquet Monsieur was soggy, my husband liked it but I thought it lacked Gruyere. The fries were overcooked and cold. I've honestly have had better food at the counter service restaurants in the parks.  I'm not sure if it was because of pre-ordering (although they did not have our order when we arrived), or just bad luck on our part. I have a very difficult time saying that our meal was worth the $31.91 that it cost.\\nI really wanted to eat there just to see the restaurant, you can't get near it without a reservation.

The food quality and flavor combinations are an absolutely amazing journey. We have been here once before, and the service and pairings were unique and enjoyable. What makes a complete experience though is not just the food, but the entire journey from entry to exit. This Valentines evening, by far, was a complete disconnect between food and service. We had 5 main areas of concern. Maybe my beautiful signifcant and I have high expectations being foodies, but frankly, if you are spending this type of money on a special occasion out in this town, there are plenty of options that deliver.\\n\\n1) Making a reservation: I spent 24 minutes talking to guest services call center to make this reservation. Normally, in any restaurant, you call, answer specific questions, and you can close the deal in under 5 minutes. I did not even receive an email confirmation after I provided every single bit of personal information that is required to make a reservation from the canned Disney brand's script. Fail. Absolutely offered no value for the consumer's time.\\n\\n2) Hostess costumes: We walked in to hostesses dressed like Aunt Jemima. I was a bit offended. Here are beautiful and pleasant women themed in costumes that seemed rather irrelevant and not matching the modern combination of theme and cuisine. Fail. Dress them in more upscale modern decor representative of the quality of food and caliber of presentation.\\n\\n3) Bar: The bar is known for a place of socializing, experimenting, and personal flavor matching to beverages. I'm surprised at how small the actual bar is in this restaurant. There are other bars in the lodge, but we were here for this experience. The bartender warmed up, and he provided us several tasting options of various south african red wine varietels that were all extremely interesting blends.\\n\\n4) Service: The server \\"Ron\\", completely lacked wine knowledge and severely lacked listening skills. He went through his script, and called out the prawns, and a few other items. We mentioned we were already drinking red wine, and asked for recommendations to pair with the Yellow Tuna dish. He brought 3 white wine options instead. We kindly stated that we had been drinking red wine, and would prefer to stick with that direction. I just asked for another glass of the Post House Pinot Noir, which he immediately responded without hesitation \\"We are out of that\\". I said, \\"Really? The bartender just poured me a glass before we sat, 15 minutes ago.\\" As a server, wouldn't you check on that before you assumed? He left than brought a full bottle over to refill my glass. Indeed they did have it. \\n\\nWe were enjoying our conversation, waiting for our entrees and sure enough the main item he mentioned (that we expressed no interest in) was served to my girlfriend, Prawns. So...we went through a fiasco to pair wine to Yellow Tuna, clearly ordered Yellow Tuna, and he still entered the order as Prawns. Then avoided us for 15-20 mins while the expediter took care of the error. That's high end customer service there! On the high note, we received our lamb loin and yellow tuna entrees another 15 mins later, and they were totally amazing. \\n\\nWhen it was time for the check, the server delivered the bill booklet below a plate with 2 small cookies. I asked, \\"oh, those look great, what are those?\\", expecting for him to describe the cookies. In a condescending voice he said \\"You do have to pay your bill eventually.\\" That once again, made us feel totally uncomfortable. When you are dropping several bills for a romantic dinner on a special occasion, this is how you should be treated?\\n\\nI provided my card to pay, and it was declined twice. My significant and I are professionals, and I knew there were plenty of funds in both accounts. The server was even more condescending. I had to call my bank and found out the few bills I paid earlier that day had exceeded the daily limit. The daily limit was increased so I could run the charge and everything was fine, but the attitude and looks during that process were quite uncomfortable.\\n\\n5) Manager: The manager came to our table to ask how everything was going. We were honest and unloaded the details. She apologized, ran my card again, and returned with the receipt. Most managers would have extended the customer service, provided comped desserts, discounts for next visit, wished us Happy Valentine's Day...something. She gave me her business card and said \\"please come back soon and visit us again, we hope it is better for you next time\\". Me and my significant both looked at each other utterly perplexed, thinking HELL NO.

The kind hostess at Chez Nous graciously took care of our party of four with immediate seating upon arrival just before 8 PM, even though half of our party were still a few short steps away from the door.  As busy as Chez Nous was at the time, they could have easily insisted on a complete party and did not.  Kudos for grace under pressure.\\n\\nChez Nous appears much larger from the outside than it is on the inside due to the expanse of street frontage on Neches that it occupies.  Nevertheless, the environ inside more resembles cozy than cramped, and, although the interior can be a bit loud at times for easy conversation, it is not nearly as noisy as, say, Wink.\\n\\nThe wine list, while not extensive, is more than adequate.  I was well served by a glass of their house Chardonnay, which, proved quite up to complementing the seafood dinner that I knew was to follow.\\n\\nAfter looking over the menu (both in advance online and again at the restaurant), I chose to go with the Menu du Jour, which is a prix fixe for three courses including appetizer, entree and dessert.  It's a steal at a restaurant of this caliber for only $26.50.  I started with a Salade Lyonnaise, which was served with a poached egg atop; spectacular and tasty.  That was followed by a Truite meuni√®re that was out of this world; best Rainbow trout I think I've ever had, buttery and lemony without being overly so in either right.  The accompanying sides were pommes dauphines, carrots, and a tomato, each a work of culinary art in its own right.  For dessert, choices were tough, but I went with a Mousse au Chocolat, which lived up to its billing.\\n\\nOne of the things that I must point out about Chez Nous that made the evening was the service and staff.  I couldn't have imagined a more pleasant troupe of waiters and waitresses, and everyone pitched in to make our total experience a fantastic one.  A water glass never went empty, and I was constantly amazed at how unobtrusive the service actually was with such intense attention.  I honestly think we were served through the course of the evening by nearly everyone working there.\\n\\nExpect a casual  90+ minute dinner here.  For the sake of pacing, I highly recommend three courses rather than two.  Also, bring along some good company and scintillating conversation.

I can't fault a thing. I wish I knew the name of \\"the man\\" so that I could refer to him as his name rather than \\"the man\\", because he was really something special. He really made us feel welcome and genuinely seemed to want us to enjoy our experience there. He knew it was our first time there, and asked how we found out about it.

The sauce was uninspired, not many seasonings and it was crying out for more salt and pepper (and maybe basil and a little thyme) because it was very bland.  The chicken itself was cooked well, and tender, but the breading was soggy and fell off the chicken breast.

My fiance often drags me to hotpot places around Boston, but hotpot often is not my favorite thing (I think it is often kind of flavorless). This has been the first hotpot place to impress me.\\n\\nBroth: The spicy broth has a wonderful depth of flavor. It really adds to the food being cooked in the broth. Sometimes at hot pot places, the broth is like a formality for the cooking, but the broth itself does not actually impart flavor. This is the best hot pot broth I have had.\\n\\nMeat: I had the ribeye and the lamb shoulder. Both were quite nice. Both had enough fat that they still had good meaty flavor after being boiled. The portions were also very generous.\\n\\nVeggies etc.: Quality seemed good. I enjoyed the selection of things you don't always find (like taro). Again, portions were great.

The decor is nice and all that, but quite honestly, I couldn't care less about looks.\\n\\nThe okays: Sushi is okay, but it looks hastily made and such, however, if you're like me and prefer taste over presentation, the sushi is live-able. The non-sushi dishes fare better in my opinion, the udon is tasteful with many toppings, and the portion of the chicken karrage was generous, even if the chicken was bland.\\n\\nThe poors: They only had 2 servers for the whole restaurant that night, so service was short and hastened. Like many Japanese restaurants in Vancouver, the servers spoke Mandarin. Including to us. And my biggest complaint, is that contrary to the decor in the restaurant, the bathrooms are deplorable. I generally don't make comments on restrooms, but this one was dirty and cramped, with a near-broken faucet.

I hope to go to another Christmas show this year and maybe even the 80's show they are putting on in April. I highly recommend a visit to a Tony Starlight show.

In addition to weekly breakfasts, we stop in for lunches when we have days off and have been in on the weekend with other friends (and our parents).\\n\\nPros:\\n- The food is wonderful. I've had pancakes, eggs, toast, sandwiches both breakfast and lunch, crabmeat quiche, home fries, pie, french toast, and macaroni and cheese - and every single thing was delicious. I mean it. Not just diner-delicious, but home-cooked Mama-made-it marvels of German and American food. So good.\\n- The staff is awesome. They're sweet, funny, and sassy - it's more like eating with your family than anything else.\\n- Everything is cheap. Being a regular there has been completely affordable.\\n- The family that owns it is German, so they serve German home-cooked specials that are to die for on Thursdays. They are proud of their German food and rightly so.\\n- I'm terribly picky with chais, but Marika's makes the best chai lattes I've ever had. In the summer, they'll serve you an iced one mixed with ice cream if you ask. Do it. Ask for one. You will not regret it.\\n- Somehow they manage to get the portions perfect. There's always just enough to be full and never too much to eat in one sitting.\\n\\nCons:\\n- Wait can be long. Don't go if you're in a hurry.\\n- Don't expect to be coddled. The staff is personable and gracious, but pulls no punches.  They cook for themselves, their regulars, and anyone who is nice to them. If you're mean or impolite, they won't tolerate it.\\n- Cash-only and not open on Tuesdays, which just means you have to plan ahead. I'm glad they give themselves a break once a week though, because they work hard.\\n\\nMarika's might be my favorite restaurant on the North Shore because it's affordable, homey, and delicious. My loyalty to the place is absolute, both because of the food and because of the people. If you tend to be hyper-critical when you're being served, save everyone a trip and don't go. if you want to fall in love with a family and their homestyle food, go, say hi, and order anything you want - it's all good!"},{"name":"Thai Passion","address":"620 Congress Ave, Ste 105","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Really, the best part about this place is the late hours. It's a nice alternative to Kerbey Lane or Magnolia, and I don't remember it ever being as busy. As far as the food goes, it's really not memorable. I've probably eaten here at least 10 times in the past six  years, and I don't really remember any mouth-gasms occurring.  I also don't remember anything offensive, so that's probably a good thing as well. I vaguely remember the peanut sauce being tasty. \\n\\nI do have one fond memory of Thai Passion. A couple of years ago, my brother, my best friend, and I decided to wait out the post-club traffic at Thai Passion. During our chicken satay appetizer, we noticed the music wasn't that pleasant. In fact, it was full-on caterwauling. After laughing at how shitty the music was, we realized that they were playing foreign covers of American hits. Think \\"All the Single Ladies\\" sung by a woman with a heavy Asian accent over a Bossa Nova beat ripped straight from my 1987 Casio keyboard. Upon realizing the gloriousness of our find, we had to have it for our own. We flagged down the waiter and asked him if we could burn the CD. Without missing a beat, the waiter said that he didn't have extra CDs, but if we had a computer he would rip the CD to it. Emboldened, we marched out of the restaurant (we left our IDs as collateral), walked five blocks to get my huge ThinkPad (my friend and I are med students, so we always have our laptops handy. Don't judge!), walked back, and ripped the CD at our table while we finished our fried rice and satay. The waiter high fived us afterwards, and we have a memento of a very odd night. If that isn't excellent customer service, I don't know what is."},{"name":"Cuchillo","address":"261 Powell Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"We were a party of five and very uncomfortable seated at the Harvest Table when there was an empty table that we all could have been a lot more comfortable at.

The portions are small but our waiter made sure we had enough for all to taste. The Taqueria's, The Lamb, Roasted Cauliflower & Pulled pork were delicious as was the Flank Steak. The libations all had way too much ice and the Music was Terrible. I would have loved to hear some great Spanish music like PATAX. We felt like we were in a pick up bar. The noise level was very loud.  We felt like they just wanted us to hurry up and get out of there by the music. It really didn't suit the ambience at all.

Our friends only had wonderful things to say about this place, so we were super excited.\\n\\nWe got to the restaurant right before 12pm, only to be told to wait in the small entrance while the previous group finished up.  At any other restaurant you'd only have to wait maybe 5 minutes for your table to be ready.  We had to wait 15 minutes.  15!  Walk-ins waited less time than us.  To top it off, the host didn't even walk us to our table, he just told us to \\"go to the empty table in the far back\\".  He didn't even give us menu's until 5 minutes later.  Thanks a lot.\\n\\nWe had to wait a long time for a waitress to take our order.  She brought glasses of water and took our orders for both food and drinks.  Then we waited, and waited, and waited.  We finally got our drinks 15 minutes later, but the waitress forgot a small water for the toddler so we had to wait longer for that.  \\n\\nWhile we were waiting for our food, we could see all of the waitresses taking baskets of fresh bread and butter to other tables.  You'd think that our waitress would have brought us bread too, but you'd be wrong.  She took bread to at least 6 other tables before us.  At least. I started giving the evil eye to the waitress because there was absolutely no reason for her to not bring us bread when clearly every other table had some.  When we finally got bread (right before our food arrived), there was only plain white bread, none of the specialty breads mentioned in other reviews.  I did enjoy the tomato based spread though.\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I shared the Omelette Special for $12, and I wasn't that thrilled.  We only got 6 small potato wedges and the thinnest fruit slices I've ever gotten at a restaurant.  The omelette itself was okay, but it was lukewarm at best.\\n\\nWe also found out after the fact that coffee refills were $1.25 each.  Maybe that's because it's a specialty coffee?
