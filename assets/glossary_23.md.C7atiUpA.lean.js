He's very friendly and attentive, also very knowledgeable about the menu.  AND, he has a cute Russian accent!!! LOL!\\nThe dessert is a combination of hot - baked fruit slices with crumb on top with cold - a ball of ice cream on the side.  Hot too hot and cold too sweet if eaten by themselves.

The mushrooms were whole (and they were oyster, shiitakes, and button) they were over cooked, mushy, huge blobs of weirdness. Not appealing. And mushrooms are a must have for me with steak. Then the potato. It was definitely jumbo. But also over cooked. The skin was almost black in spots and had the overall burnt taste. But the middle was great. Last..the filet. It was just...a filet. Not the melt in your mouth yumminess you're looking for. The outside was very, very charred, so I had to cut it off for my daughter to enjoy. \\nOur waitress was friendly.

Lots of good options but I had the Pesto Rawviolis with the Pac Man and Quinoa Salads as sides. I washed it all down with a Strawberry Lemonade Kombucha. The Pacman didn't help me the next day with all the garlic but it was delicious. Quinoa was pretty standard but good. The rawviolis were good. The jicama was cut perfectly and gave it a nice crunchy texture. Pesto was good though a little strong in the garlic area which I dont mind. The highlight was the kombucha. It was one of the better kombuchas I had. And it was locally produced. Though it didn't have that strong kombucha flavor. Service:\\nThe young lady who helped me was nice and attentive. Convenience:\\nThis is a 2.5 for me since it is a little off the normal area I would frequent when in town. Also parking kind of sucked even though it was later in the night before they closed. So I can imagine what it's like during the lunch or dinner rush.Value:\\nFor raw it was a good deal. But raw food is always a little pricey. But to get a solid,healthy, locally-sourced meal this was worth it. I'm not 100% sure what is so counter-culture about this place. I ate with utensils, sitting on chairs in a dining room filled with an assortment of mismatched chairs and art while being served similar food I've eaten at other raw places by the standard tatted servers. Pretty standard. Don't get me wrong I like the place. Maybe its the lack of AC or at least a low temp set point. \\nThe one thing I thought was humorous is the non-\\"judgmental\\" bathrooms. For the women's sake I prefer separate bathrooms. Mostly because guys are disgusting in the bathroom.

I want more fishiness!I also want to advise against ordering the Bo Kho (Vietnamese beef stew). I have some fond memories of this dish and I just really did not like the Bo Kho here.

Ok fine, I didn't let that get me down, so I showed up an they were all ready to go, great!

Many open tables only to be told they do this so they buffet line doesn't get backed up.  There are three different buffet lines might I add and the only reason it would back up was the really crappy layout they have for said buffet.  While you wait, you literally have about 3 options on where you can wait while one of them being inside while open tables are available and watching people go through the line.  Once we sat down, we found out buffet runs about $18.99 per person.  Ok, this better blow my mind since I waited so long.  Not at all.  Options where more learning towards lunch side than breakfast.

The place is small. I've been in larger public restrooms. But hey, just because it's small doesn't mean anything, right? There are a lot of TVs there, so it would be great for sports viewing. We were taken to a table by a young  woman with her butt cheeks poking out of what could only be her little sister's denim shorts. If you are a fan of butt cheeks, I highly recommend this place. They were pretty packed, so we waited for someone to take our drink order. The Server came back and my friend ordered iced tea and I asked her for a good, German Pilsner. She didn't know what a pilsner was and I'm pretty sure she didn't know what Germany was; she said she wasn't old enough to drink. But that doesn't mean she isn't old enough to know her menu. So, she said she would ask someone to stop by to help me. I asked for water while I was waiting. The Server disappeared. Bye! So, a guy in a Red Sox T shirt walked up and asked me what I wanted. No introductions, no \\"Hi\\", nothing. It was a little off-putting. So, i asked him for a good, German Pilsner. He said, \\"Heineken\\". (facepalm). Well, I knew this conversation was going nowhere, so I just skimmed the beer menus (yes, there are two) and picked the first pilsner I found, a small brewery in Napa, CA. The guy said he would send the server back. She showed up with the tea, but no water and started walking away before I stopped her and gave her my beer order. The Server wanted to know if I wanted a bucket of FIVE beers. WTF? There are two people at the table and one is drinking tea, ever hear of over-serving someone? I said one would do for now. While I waited I looked around, all the tables are set up for an even-number of patrons, so the 5 beer thing would never work out evenly. Maybe that's the plan. So, my ice-cold beer was delivered by the server but still no water. She took our order. I asked for the medium-heat, buffalo wings, cooked well-done. I can't stand under cooked wings in the center. The server said that 1) they weren't buffalo wings and 2) she doesn't think the kitchen can cook them well-done. So, I pointed at the menu and said to bring me whatever these were (medium) but said that if they aren't cooked all the way through, they will all be going back to the kitchen. She said she would try. Seeing as I STILL didn't have water, I cringed a little inside.  My friend wanted plain chicken wings and that set off a Q & A with the server: \\nYou want them dry-rubbed? No \\nWhat kind of sauce? None. \\nNo sauce? That's why i said plain. \\nYou want them plain? yes. \\nNothing on them? yes. Off she went again. Bye. After a reasonable amount of time, we got our wings.  These are good-sized, meaty wings. Not those scrawny 2 bite wings that other sports bars give you. And they were HOT out of the fryer. The fries were really good and really hot as well. I had to give them a few minutes. I also managed to get a glass of water. Thank you. My friend's wings were not plain, they had a dry rub on them, but he said they were good and ate them. Credit to the kitchen: all my wings were cooked all the way through. The buffalo sauce (or whatever they call it) was not great; just vinegar and hot sauce. Maybe a little melted butter or margarine would help?  After the 3rd or 4th wing, I wanted something else. But I finished them and switched to Teriaki. Now those are really, REALLY good! I may try different wings in the future, but I will definitely start with those. Now on to the prices. All said and done, the total was about $38.50 and I threw  the server $7.50 for her new shorts fund.  I know my 1st beer was $5 (and was not very good) and my 2nd was $1.50 (Icehouse). I guess the tea was $2 so the wings & fries are $15 each. Now, it is AUCE so I guess that is a good price. Chinese buffets are $10 - $12 around here. Cons: While they tout a huge selection of beers; it is not that huge. I think their beer distributor salesman talks them into some bad choices. They only have 2 beers on tap and one was CHOCOLATE flavored. (Arf, Gag, Wretch) The other was a oatmeal beer or something. Save that stuff for the bottles, that is for a select crowd, not your average draft beer drinker. Also, the staff needs to know their beer selection a little better and they need a geography lesson, Heineken is not made in Germany. It is also not a premium beer, American Heineken is crap.  Take a trip to World of Beer as a scouting mission and steal a beer menu. Pros: Really, REALLY good wings. The fries were great as well. Lots of TVs for your viewing pleasure.

But I did visit this overly priced restaurant for the wait staff.  I went to this restaurant for what is normally an outstanding meal. Well unfortunately my meal was subpar at best. Both of our steaks were so salty they were barely edible - when brought to the attention of the manager and his only offer was to remake the steaks. However service was slow and we already waited an hour and a half for our food. So basically we ate $60 inedible steaks because we were so hungry and couldn't wait any longer for the food. The manager did not offer any type of compensation or for that matter even a free drink. The lobster macaroni was incredibly dry and overcooked - you'd have to wear a coal miner's hat to find a piece of lobster in it.Lastly I ordered a lobster tail with my steak and the lobster tail was incredibly overcooked. Now granted all of these things are somewhat forgivable if you are paying reasonable prices.

It included 2 pieces of shrimp and a small piece of fish. Portion size would have not bothered me as much if I felt like quality compensated for it, but that was not the case.

That in mind, here was my experience. I ordered takeout the first time and had apps and mojitos the second time. Interior: \\nThe bar has these very tall chairs, fit for a giant, but then the architect made the bar itself too tall. Same for the booths. The booth is shorter than the table, by about a foot. The interior involved lots of Cuban murals, and very slow moving ceiling fans that look as if they are being fanned by the ocean air. I really liked the ambience, once I was inside, and not staring at the Dollar Store next door. Drinks: \\nThe drinks are great, and $4 during happy hour for a pint-glass of mojitos that are hand made at the bar. Food: \\nTried the ropa vieja (beef) and the lechon asada (pork) as well as an empanada filled with eggplant. First of all, the eggplant empanada was huge! It was the size of three McDonalds apple fritters squashed together and had the same consistency. And it was $2. I picture the more typical empanadas, that are drier and tiny and filled with meat and raisins and whatnot. The lechon asada, that comes with rice and beans, was a bit on the greasy side. And the ropa vieja was not super memorable. The plantains were really yummy. And the maduros (fried plantains) were like little plantain potato chips. The apps were the guacamole with fried plantain chips and that was pretty tasty; the yucca con mojo is an enormous mountain of food drizzled with mojo (oil, lime juice, garlic, and cumin); the croquettas (one with fish and one with pork but the waiter was unable to tell us which was which). I don't know Cuban food that well so I'll just say I'll be trying the all-day sandwiches next. Service: \\nNo water ever arrived. And no waiter knew which table should have which dish? Yours? Yours? Yours? Ours! And then it was 20 minutes to get the bill. But the bill was twice what it should have been because it had yours, mine, and ours listed on it. 20 minutes later we get the revised bill (the computer's fault is what we were told), and then it was 20 more minutes before the payment was taken. The Cuban motto might encourage kindness above all else but after a twenty minute wait in the parking lot on the front end, it sort of adds up. Yes, we were hostages on a Friday night, but we made it out.

Oysters: Liked half of them, tried about 6 different kinds. We had a good mix of briny oysters but there was one sour pair, maybe we added too much lemon to that one? I'm not a connoisseur, I just like eating briny, salty ones and there were enough of them to satisfy my taste. I remember enjoying the Row 34. Garnishes were good. Striped bass (this seemed to be a special that was written in) was perfectly cooked and was very satisfying. Beautifully seasoned. Wish there were a larger quantity of veggies/sides with it but the flavors were all delicious and it all came together nicely. Service: Excellent all the way from start to finish. Awesome bartenders and servers - very attentive, funny and patient. You won't need to ask for separate plates if you're splitting any entrees, they'll automatically serve on separate plates for all parties involved. A+ for that extra step!Vibe: very casual, trendy, islandy.

They even have outdoor seating, which much be perfect for the summer.For food, they offer a lot of shareable smaller plates, so you can go crazy on trying a variety of new things. To be honest, we probably should have ordered more. Unlike most Thai restaurants, the portions are not gigantic. Each dish is incredibly authentic & very similar to the delicious street food in Thailand (my husband and I traveled there in 2012).We ordered the Boar Collar, Pork Belly Curry, the Tuna salad, and the Chicken wings. The boys at the table loved the Boar Collar and my favorite was the melt-in-your-mouth pork belly curry. But the table favorite by a landslide was their fish sauce chicken wings. They come 6 to a plate.....so I think I will order 4 plates just for myself next time. They were THAT good!They also have a great selection of cocktails and asian beers and delicious sides - coconut rice, thai basil peanuts, etc. The staff is also very helpful and responsive.We can't wait to come back!Tip: If you do go and there is a line, go to the Whiskey Soda Lounge across the street.

My husband took it to the girl at the counter who takes it to the cook. The cook RETURNS the sandwich to us saying, \\"It's just charcoal.\\" Apparently, they expected me to continue to eat the sandwich with \\"charcoal\\" all in it. They didn't offer to make a new one, give our money back, or even take the charcoal OFF the sandwich. It was returned to us in the same condition with a \\"too bad, so sad\\" attitude.\\" Total waste of time, and especially money!

My fiance and I have split a few of them already, and they are absolutely fantastic. The peanut butter filling in the chocolate/peanut butter was delicious, it was actual peanut butter, with a more smooth frosting consistency. It actually stuck to the roof of my mouth a bit.

I don't mind waiting, but two hours on average is ludicrous! The food here is a mixed bag. Their fish sauce wings are delicious and the dish I would come back for. The papaya salad, which is a dish I generally love, was eh... the dressing had too much lime juice in it, which threw off the balance of flavors. Additionally, it was SO spicy, I couldn't even enjoy it as my mouth was on fire (and I eat spicy food on a regular basis). Lastly, the roasted game hen was too roasted and therefore really dry/tough. On top of that, I think we only got about five bites out of it because it was so small.The prices here are inflated when compared to other Thai/Thai fusion places, which I'm sure is at least partly due to the huge hype.

A little hiccup, but otherwise I was pleased with the servers and staff throughout the meal. The food:The famous Vietnamese fish sauce wings--cooked thoroughly, nice and crispy, and taste is great if you aren't opposed to fish sauce (hence the name).  I thought they were good, just not my all time favorite in terms of wings I've tried (I tend to like the sweeter type Korean chicken wings).  This was probably the only good sized meal portion that we got.Neua Naam Tok (flank steak)--served on a small platter, not as big a portion as expected for family style.  They were very small slices of meat, taste was meh, so pretty underwhelmed with this dish.  Yam Khai Dao (fried farm egg salad)--this was my fave, but be warned it is spicy!  Loved the crisp egg cut into pieces throughout, and the lime fish sauce and palm sugar dressing added that sweet and savory aspect I love.  This salad was very refreshing and tasty.  For $15 per dish though, we just expected a lot more food.  Especially since the menu said it's best to do family style...I guess if you're each a small eater!  For $3 you get a small serving of sticky rice that's recommended for most dishes, feeds pretty much one person, if that.

Another thing that makes this place a joy to come to are the people who are behind the counter. They are all very very friendly and make sure you get the cut you want. Last time I was there they brought out a pound of brisket that wasnt outside cut and they took it back and got me the cut I wanted without question.

The appetizer (lemon fusilli, I think, as this was a few months back) was a letdown as well. Undercooked and again, overpriced. Positives were that they had told us it was a 2 hour wait, but we got a seat at the bar within a few minutes. Also the drinks had cute names. But that was a bout it.

We're visiting from Hawaii, and the shop owner was super friendly and it sounded like he makes everything by himself! What we liked about this cafe is that there's a huge menu and a variety of foods that cater to a lot of dietary restrictions! He mentioned that the vegetable couscous is vegetarian and fully vegan, and a lot of the appetizers are just vegetables as well. We got the Moroccan carrots, Harira, bastilla, vegetable couscous and the Moroccan mint tea. I recommend getting one of each of these, as they are what seem to be staples of Moroccan cuisine. We have a restaurant in Hawaii that offers similar dishes. Both have similar taste, which makes me believe these are \\"authentic\\" although I've never been to Morocco. The servings are really generous and can be shared amongst a party of 3. Everything we had was so amazing!!What's most surprising is he's only been open for 6 months!

First off, it was really warm inside which didn't making staying there to eat very comfortable. I understand it was nearly 100 degrees yesterday and we went around 6 p.m., but the sun was blazing through the windows and there weren't any blinds so we couldn't escape the heat at any of the tables.Service was friendly and you could tell the workers were all keeping busy between taking orders, cooking and handling the phone.We decided to try a little bit of everything and ordered:\\n-Chips & Queso (delicious!)\\n-Esquites (good, but too much \\"stuff\\" for my liking. Next time I'd ask for no lime, no cilantro and less cheese)\\n-Mighty Bird taco (took one bite and couldn't eat anymore - not Mighty Bird's fault, but mine, for not realizing what chicken chorizo was. Now I know I'm not a fan of it. If I were to order it again, I'd ask to sub regular chicken, because everything else on the taco looked good)\\n-The Road Trip with no avovado, because I'm probably the only person who lives in Austin who doesn't like avocado (REALLY tasty, but I would skip the Mighy Sauce next time and just add some of their delicious jalapeno ranch that I grabbed from the condiment bar)\\nMy husband just ordered two tacos with chicken and cheese on flour tortillas and use some of the chipotle salsa to dip them in. He really liked them, but wished that he could have gotten breakfast tacos for dinner. If that is ever an option in the future (aside from Sundays when they already serve them all day) we'd probably be there twice a week. We used the entire $28 groupon for all of the above, so it is a tad pricy, but they do not skimp on size or portions by any means. We couldn't finish the queso or the esquites because of how much there was and we ordered the smallest size and the tacos were packed with chicken and toppings.I will definitely go back to Mighty Bird, as long as they don't mind a person who likes to customize a bit. I'd also like to try a rotisserie chicken meal and saw quite a few people come in and order the Whole Bird combo to go which is a great deal at $16.99.So four stars from me, and a menu that features a lot more items I'd love to try.

Seating is beyond madness, even late at night, so plan on taking a stroll down Division while you wait. For the over-21 crowd, snag a seat at Whiskey Soda across the street. Townshend's Division St. Teahouse makes a great alternative if you're still sporting the peach fuzz.The Good: Pok Pok's legendary fish sauce chicken wings are incredible! Simply the best wings I've ever had -- crispy, savory, and spiced to perfection. They come hot and mild, but hot is definitely the way to go, unless you're a p*ssy. The spice-rubbed boar collar is delectable, but be warned -- it's SPICY. Personally, I recommend the Thai herbal salad with carrots and parsnips. It is flavored generously with shrimp, minced pork, tumeric, basil, lime leaf, lemongrass, toasted nuts, and a whole host of other herbs and spices. The ginger pork belly curry is wonderfully savory and slightly sweet, and it comes in a sauce that is just heavenly when spooned over rice. If you're still hungry, try the clay pot prawns with glass noodles for a Chinese-Thai fusion twist. Service was fast despite the late-night crowd and they kept our water glasses full. If you can, try and sit at the bar! The bartenders are skillful and friendly. Pok Pok is absolutely deserving of it's reputation as a Portland staple.The Bad: Seating is overbooked and overpacked, so expect to sit elbow-to-elbow with your neighbors after waiting 2+ hours for a table. Some portions are on the small side, so keep that in mind when ordering.Don't forget: Not only can food be freshly-made to-go, but Ike's famous fish sauce wings are also available across the street at Whiskey Soda.

It's definitely more upscale, even being located out of a food cart.The story (as I picked up eavesdropping on the waiter and conversing with the manager): Pok Pok's owner (who was actually in Thailand picking up more recipes when we were there) started the place as a food cart, and within a few years had accumulated enough to expand into the restaurant it now has next door (although they kept the food cart and actually cook their food from there).When I go to a restaurant I try to weigh the service, quality of food, etc... against the price and time it takes to.... EAT.Wait: Most people coming here went to the bar down the street to wait (because Pok Pok's wait is famously long). For my friend and I, the wait wasn't too bad because we were willing to eat anywhere there was an opening. Service: Great- the waiter was knowledgeable and ready and willing to share said knowledge about the food and its origins. Food: 2 main dishes (mine was a curried soup, hers some kind of prawn noodles), sticky rice, tea, and dessert.Price (including tip): $65. You decide if that's a bit spendy for a dinner.

The Hostess is very congenially and lends to a comfortable dinner experience.  The Servers are friendly and will assist with the menu if you are a first timer, as it is a bit confusing.  CONS:   Ambience, not really. The back dinning room feels just like that eating in a back room store front.   Walls adorned with paintings that are flea market types, but if you look at the prices they are asking, you will gasp in amazement.     I feel like i am eating at a sort of \\"fast food\\" restaurant.   There are NO salt/pepper shakers on any tables.   If you request them, they come in small paper packages like you get a Burger King.   Also applies to grated cheese.   None.   You have to request it with when you meal arrives, and then only it comes in a small paper cup.    Did I say small, Yep.      Soft drinks are served in paper cups and kind of flimsy.   My server handed it to me and if I had not  grasped it by  the bottom, I would have spilled it over my dinner, as the cup is flimsy.  .   The side dishes that comes with the metaballs are penne or linquine pasta and portions on sparingly.   As I said above their specialities are the meatballs  which are good.

Stayed over the 4th of July holiday weekend. Had a great room with a view overlooking the lazy river pool. The room was very clean. However, I would advise not going if you're looking for an adult only getaway without the kiddies, being the middle of summer, and near one the major theme parks, I realize most families are on vacation. (Big mistake on my part)So, If you're looking for a getaway without the kiddies this is not the place.  Very family oriented resort (I get it)but there was just kids running around and screaming everywhere.  I have nothing against children just not the place to relax sans THE little monsters (I mean, children).  Couldn't get the opportunity to go in the lazy river since the kids are in it from 8am til 10pm and the pool closes at 11pm.  The only time I could enjoy the lazy river was from 10pm-11pm on the last night since only adults were in it. And you weren't wall to wall with kids during the day.Fortunately, though there was the Ritz-Carlton next to the Spa and you could buy a day pass for $25.00 and get unlimited access to the workout facilities, day spa and adult-only pool (thank goodness) FINALLY some quiet and peaceful relaxation!The restaurant on the premises was called Primo and dinner was outstanding.  All the veggies are grown right in the garden on the premises, everything tasted wonderful and fresh.  My only disappointment was the next night on sunday, July 6 Primo was closed. when I asked the concierge why, they simply stated that the restaurant was doing renovations during that time, which was probably a bunch of bs since it was the 4th of July weekend and it was a sunday night which they were going to be closed for the next 3 days. Really?! \\n I would have been totally cool with them just being honest saying that \\"it's the freakin holiday weekend and we want to be able to give our staff some time off too! I get that!\\" But don't lie about getting renovations done in the middle of summer, a holiday weekend, and you're in a resort with no other dining options except to eat at Starbucks (which is also on the premises) or drive 5 miles outside of the resort to the nearest fast food chain!

There was a chill in the air and a slight spring in my step.  Of course, I was excited to be in the North End, one of the most lovely places to be in all of Boston, maybe even in the world.  We knew where we'd be dining that night.  The Daily Catch.  Why would we want to \\"risk it' anywhere else.We parked in Parcel 7 (which was a DOLLAR).  Make sure you get your parking validated @ the Daily Catch.  Amazing deal.  So we walk down Hanover Street and poke our head in their tiny restaurant.  The place was packed!  Not a seat to be had.  Luckily, there was a table paying their bill and there only were three people ahead of us.  Sebastian, the waiter extraordinaire pokes his head outside and said  \\"Fifteen minutes\\", when I asked how long for a table for two.  No problemo!  Literally, 30 seconds later, Sebastian comes back out and says.  \\"Just kidding, I can seat you right now.\\"  So, in we went.  The smell of garlic cooking made me even hungrier.  We sat next to the three people who were waiting ahead of us.  They were from Tokyo and Taiwan and were friendly -- you will be sitting right next to strangers, fyi.We ordered the calamari meatballs, which do not contain meat, just calamari, breadcrumbs, spices.  The marinara sauce they serve with it is deelish.  I got mussels fra diavlo with linguine.  PERFECTA!!  My fiance got littlnecks with a spicy red sauce.  We got a bottle of their Sicilian red wine, it was wonderful.I love how you basically are in the kitchen and can watch the chef make your dinner.  The red wine vinegar with hot pepper is such a interesting condiment.  I put it on my bread, I even put it in my pasta.The prices are not too high, but they are not very low.

The restaurant was packed which was also a good sign. Our server was very nice and prompt. Now on to the most important part of the dining experience, the food. Thai shrimp salad: 4 stars. The salad had an amazing taste and the presentation was amazing. The only reason that I am not giving it 5 stars is there was a puddle of dressing in the middle of the plate. I would definitely order this again but next time I will ask for light dressing as there was just way to much. Shrimp fresh rolls: 5 star all the way. The rolls were fresh and the peanut sauce that came with the dish was quite possible the best peanut sauce that I have ever had. There was a tiny kick to it that was just perfect. Pineapple fried rice: 5 star. Not much to say aside from the fact that this rice was spot on. You can get fried rice at endless restaurants, and this rates pretty high in taste and quality. Winter shrimp: 5 Star. These shrimp were wrapped in egg roll sheets and lightly fried. Dipping them in the included plum sauce leaves you wanting to order another the moment you are done with the first.

The Brussels were stellar and has a really interesting Asian and sweet/sour kinda kick to them, I'd order them again in a heartbeat. Similarly, the tuna was excellent and paired surprisingly well with the plantain despite our hesitation. The lamb and mushroom and potato plates were nothing to write home about, we would've rather tried the empanada had we known the special of the day before ordering (it was never presented to us).Food came out quick but water service was slow and the wait staff seemed disinterested or bored, even upon arrival and getting a table, it felt it like it was everyone's first day on the job.

Dumplings were meaty but the sweet spicy sauce was amazing and we saved it to dip everything else into. The mains dishes were good as well. If I had to pick one it would be the fish fillet with napa cabbage b/c it was the spiciest of our choices.

I've had lunch here several times, but it was my first time for dinner.  As usual, I skipped all the hot and cold foods and went straight to the sushi and seafood.  I had a couple of rolls which were okay. The nigiri of  salmon and shrimp was good. I also loved the udon.  The oysters on the half shell was my fave and it was delish! They were quite small and it was served with scallions, a lemon wedge, and optional hot sauce.  I probably ate a dozen!  The crab legs weren't that fresh to me.  They were still edible, but the shell was soft.  You really didn't need the crackers.  I like my crab legs hot, but these were cold.  I still ate them bc I love crab legs, but they weren't the best I've had. However, it was very good for a buffet.  I also enjoyed the shrimp cocktail.  It looked like frozen shrimp to me. The grilled items next to the soup station were also good. I enjoyed the beef rib eye kabobs and the gal bi was a little fatty, but still good.  To top off the evening of the seafood buffet, I got the yummy soft serve green ice cream.  It was a perfect ending to a good meal. We had 5 people in our party and about 7-8 ice cream cups. That's how good it was!  The crepes looked good too, but I'm not a big fan. I also joined the frequent dinner rewards program.  Well my mom told me to sign up.

A basic pepperoni pizza is seriously my favourite eat, no matter how old, cold, or stale it is, I'll eat it all day, every day, and if it was the last kind of food on earth, I'd never get sick of it. I'm a pizza-eating freak. Maybe a monster.\\nAnyways, this place is hands down my favourite pizza pit in the city for 3 reasons:\\n1. It's delicious and fresh - they ALWAYS have several varieties of pizza on display and I always see them making more pizza in the back. The pizza actually looks fresh in the case as well, and if it's been sitting there for a bit, they'll pop it in the oven for you to heat it up (I noticed that most pizza places don't do this). I always get my good ol' pepperoni (it's easy to compare pizza places when you stick to one type of pizza), and their pepperoni really tops my list of pep pizzas. The pepperoni itself covers the entire pizza (they're not stingy with it!), it's tangy and crispy (this is the most important factor in terms of pepperoni for me), doesn't taste cheap or undercooked, the sauce and cheese is just right, and the crust is nice, thin, and crispy. \\n2. The staff are fantastic - every time I'm in there, the staff, particularly the manager, is extremely warm and friendly! The manager actually recognized me too (that's how often I've been going there), and as I leave, one of them always say good-bye from the back. They never hesitate on warming my slices up and they never look miserable or bored like most of the employees at many pizza places in town. \\n3. They're cheap/reasonably priced - Many people have mentioned that they're a bit pricier than most pizza places downtown - maybe it's the fact that I live off pepperoni and don't really go for specialty flavours, but I find that my 2 slices and a can of pop always come out a whole dollar or two cheaper than most of the places I used to frequent. Even if they were a bit pricier, I'd still take my business there since the pizza is delicious. In terms of the interior, I really don't bother judging or letting that affect my rating since it's a cheap pizza joint on the corner of a downtown street, not a fancy 5-star restaurant (though I'd probably choose this over a fancy 5-star restaurant anyways). All I expect from it is that it is clean (which I find it to be cleaner than many pizza places anyways)! Anyways.\\nI think I found my pizza joint of choice in the city. 5 stars from me. Super friendly manager and staff, delicious, delicious, delicious pepperoni pizza, and the pricing is fantastic for the quality.

Parking is simple you can park anywhere there in the Bexley plaza because it's all free and open parking areas.The wait was long as expected, when I got to the counter the staff were very nice and hospitable. They made their recommendations which I appreciated. Most of which made my bowl taste even better thanks to them. I got the falafel bowl which has about 3 or 4 falafels. They are the real deal, taste very authentic to what I remember growing up and making them in my original homeland of Israel.Next you pick your toppings I got the eggplant, cauliflower, crispy onions, cukes and onions. You have a choice with the sauces, they have the their house sauce or you have a choice between the red pepper, tahini or hot sauce. Finally you check out and you can add extras like pita for $2.50 or the seasoned fried which are oh so yummy and worth trying.

When everyone in Boston quits singing \\"Let It Go\\" because the sun finally came out, all you want is a cold drink with a satisfying lobster roll. Queue your favorite summer anthem, say, The Beach Boys, and walk into ICOB, because at their weekend lunches they have no wait. Shh, its a secret, but people will catch on.My wife had already been here with some friends and was raving for days about how good it was. I preface my seafood reviews with the same thing, I do not really like it. However, when its done so well, its really hard to dislike it. Island Creek Oyster Bar is in the top shelf of seafood restaurants in Boston. The service, the quality, and the creativity here all stand out.I surprised my wife with a lunch trip for our anniversary. I know its not as romantic as a dinner, but the procrastination in me didn't allow me to attempt to make a reservation until 2-3 days before hand. Still, their lunch menu is quite extensive, and all the favorites are on there. The oyster slides are the perfect way to complement the summer, buttery, fried oysters topped with a delicious mayo served on a perfectly toasted bun. I was also thoroughly impressed with their fish and chips, the fries were amazing and the smaller sized fish tenders optimized the ratio of fish to fried batter. Disclaimer, this isn't UK style fish and chips where you get a whole cod dipped and fried in batter; but, this is for the better. My wife's fish sandwich was also perfectly fried on the outside, and juicy on the inside with a healthy serving of their tangy mayo on the inside. I wasn't sold on the lobster roll, it was good, but the other items on the menu simply overshadow it.For dessert we had their banana coffee cake with some of the blueberry sorbet. With such a rich main course, the lightness of the dessert was appreciated. It was just sweet enough to clinch your meal off on some good notes, but not heavy enough to make you feel tired after leaving.There are few places in Boston that can be mentioned in the same sentence as ICOB.

First off, I am actually a pretty big fan of quick-serve Mexican food.

I also can't fail to mention the interesting salsa bar that includes deep fried peppers and onions in a crock pot that is attached with bailing wire with a plate as a lid.The bad: Nachos are awful, as are the chips. My last burrito was filled with frozen vegetables; I have never had a burrito before that literally had green beans, corn, lima beans, and carrots in it. The chicken is so so. Also, I am not sure if this is good or bad, however every time I have had lunch at Don Pedro's I have still been full at 6PM. There is some magical stick-to-the ribs quality about the food that is fairly unique in my opinion.What can I say? I want to like this place, however there are much better options nearby.

They also did an interesting fried tofu plate (local tofu, I'm sure since I had just seen the Ota tofu factory earlier that morning).The bartender was so nice, he charged my call drinks as well. Ha!

Its gone downhill since they have opened. With the pretty penny i pay there, id expect good service too.The last 3 times Ive been in have been sub par. First on Jan. 2nd for late lunch, around 3pm. The place wasnt very packed. The hostess sat us right away, and that is honestly where the good service eneded. We were a party of 3 with 2 first timers. We waited 10 minutes for someone to attend the table as servers were greeting other tables that sat after us. I asked a server for some water and they said \\"be there in a minute.\\" It didnt take a minute. Finally our actual server came to us and she smelled so bad of cigarettes that i almost lost my appetite. We then again asked fot water, started with some appetizers as we browsed the menu. The appetizers came out. Still no water. We've been in 30 minutes now with no water and food in front of us. Appetizers were devoured, server didnt check on us or take our entree orders. Server finally came to take entree orders, my friend asked her what is good on the menu and she said \\"um, like everything\\" with a very irritated tone. We ordered, she finally brought water. Never checked on us during our entree, i had to ask another server for refill and chopsticks. But she was very quick to drop of the check, didnt offer dessert or anything. Paid and we all kinda left feeling disappointed and underwhelmed.I came back, not really wanting to because of the service last time but my boyfriend was really craving the seabass. So we went... service was identical to my previous visit\\n Non existent. I might have bad luck because we get sat next to other sections with servers that i can clearly see are more attentive!

My dude claims the half winter moon is his drink, I am informed that Summer and Wintermoon are basically different temperatures of the same drink, and it drives me nuts. After 3 minutes of hesitating back and forth (the menu list was not even complicated, btw), I chose the Chai, only because I'm familiar with Big Train as a dependable go-to Chai, and that I read a positive review about it here. As the barista rings up our choices, we pay, and he takes care of the other customers, I change my mind last minute, nudged him from afar, and the sweet guy converted the Chai over to my latest favorite-- a classic cappuccino. Smooth, good amount of foam to coffee ratio.  I'm happy, so content with 1) not getting a duplicate moon drink 2) being able to appreciate the pureness of unsweetened coffee. I take many sips of Wintermoon, which was a fun balance of coffee and a sweet, butter-creamy vanilla-y coffee. Honestly, it reminds me of Haagen-Daaz coffee, which is a 100% winner in my book.

We were seated immediately and after asking the waitress some questions about the seasonal pancake batter (who was absolutely helpful), we ordered the peanut butter and chocolate batter with a side of bananas and hazelnut spread. I loved both of the batters. For someone who is not a fan of the chocolate, I thought it was perfect. Not too chocolatey and delicious for my taste. However, my boyfriend preferred the peanut butter over the chocolate. The batter texture was prefect. We loved how the grill really helped with making the perfect pancakes. Tip: One batter was just the right amount for one person. Our waitress told us that usually two people share one batter but I guess we were really hungry and we normally eat for two people each anyways haha. Also, keep in mind that the pancakes are very thin and light. We spent almost two hours playing with our food. We failed at pancake art but nonetheless, it was extremely fun and tasted great.

Since we had a large group, an automatic gratuity of 18% was applied to our entire bill. Far from deserving.

Ordered the cheeseburger as a main and it was good but nothing special. I would recommend sticking with fish at this place as that is what they are known for (And do a great job at!).

Our mistake for having ice cream before dinner, so we only ordered 2 dishes and a dessert. The Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings are a must order. It is the full wing with the drum and the tip of the wing. The wings were so juicy and flavourful, I wish we could physically eat more! For those of you who don't like bold tastes, you should still try this as there isn't a super strong fish sauce taste. You will NOT be disappointed.We also ordered the King Op Wun Sen. it came with 4 large prawns, with the shell on. There was a spicy sauce that came with the noodles on the side. The prawns were large, fresh, and juicy. The noodles they use also absorb all the flavour while it's being cooked. Over, the dish was really yummy, and even better with the spicy sauce.We finished dinner with the Khao Niaw Mamuang (mango sticky rice). There was a little bit of a savoury taste to it, but that is what made the mango and sticky rice flavors pop. If we weren't so full, we would have ordered more!

This is maybe one of the best places to go. You get to make your own pancakes..  Thin ones, decorative ones,  Big one's, short one's tall ones.. they bring you the batter in a squeeze bottle and any fruit you may care to put on it. The fruit is fresh fruit. They have other menu items. An ala carte menu that they cook up for you in the kitchen. But, the do it yourself pancake making really puts this place into the unique, over the top category. The grill top is removed when you sit down, leaving the grill, a rectangular grill which can make four to six, smallish pancakes at one time is already hot. You put your toppings on the batter as it's cooking, well, you know how to make pancakes, from already pre-mixed batter, right?\\nThey have four choices of batter. I can't make any particular recommendations because everyone has different tastes. There is one that's gluten free, as well. When it's time to turn your cakes, you flip them with your spatula and there it is... Puts a new twist on fun food...The only reason I don't give them 5 stars is the add ons can add up pretty quickly. So, it can get a bit pricey. I enjoy how many things they do. They serve alcohol far enough away from the grill where you are almost in a different restaurant, and also it's a breakfast and brunch eatery, Plus, the do it yourself pancake stations...

I've had Baltimore pit beef, brats in Wisconsin, and the great firehouse BBQ chicken in Maryland. I have made both Korean and South Carolina style BBQ at home.  I have for years believed that the vinegar-sauced eastern North Carolina pulled pork was hands-down the best BBQ there is.  Went to Rudy's on Research Blvd today for lunch.  First, suspend your disbelief that there is great BBQ in a new-ish, sorta faux-authentic building with an actual Shell station out front.  The place is huge however, and the staff was terrific when we explained that we were wayward East Coasters in search of real Texas BBQ.  There were a couple of Austin cops eating there, so that's always a good sign.As others said, the counter guys were terrific at explaining the menu and providing samples.  I thought that the Lean Brisket was pretty dry, and I'm not sure how anyone could order anything outside of the Extra Moist Brisket, which is probably one of the best things I've ever eaten, and I've eaten a lot.  Three other tips:  (1) They're going to give you a bunch of white bread.  Skip it.  The bread just gets in the way of the incredible taste of the meat.

We were excited to try it, since it's in our neighborhood and seems to have overwhelmingly positive feedback. Background: we love Thai food and have tried several Thai establishments in Vancouver, and have enjoyed almost all of them (some more than others). But in general, we're not hard to please.First, the PROS: The atmosphere is warm, clean, and charmingly decorated--I'll give them that. I thought noise might be an issue since it's so close to the road, but it's really not. There's ample parking as well, so that's a plus. Portion sizes were also generous.But the FLAVOR... My husband ordered pineapple fried rice with medium spice, which came out completely pale as if it had hardly been fried at all. It looked and tasted like a Lean Cuisine Dinner, or one of those frozen rice meals from Trader Joes. The variety of ingredients was great, but the taste was virtually non-existent. I ordered the rama chicken. The sauce had only the faintest hint of peanut flavor, and the rice was very dry--so much so that it wouldn't stay on my fork. The flavor overall was extremely bland (which says a lot since I typically prefer things on the milder side). We tried to nicely bring up the lack of flavor and spice to our waitress, to which she responded by bringing us a bottle of sriracha.Honestly, we were pretty heartbroken, because we were hoping to find a decent Thai place in our neighborhood. But we wound up only eating a few bites, paid our bill, and went to Taco Bell down the road on our way home. Reading all these other stellar reviews makes me feel like I'm living in some sort of Bizarro World, cause I definitely did not experience what these other diners had. Maybe we came on a bad day..."},{"name":"Cask'n Flagon","address":"62 Brookline Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"For a place that gets this much business the service is a joke. It took 20 minutes to get a drink at the bar when I first arrived. Doesn't help that the beer tasted strange and my guess is that the lines weren't clean. Not much to offer on the draft beer lineup besides the usual suspects (i.e. blue moon, etc.). The kicker was my girlfriend was nearly tackled by a waitress that was in such a rush knocked over her beer. Clearly this inferior staff can't handle the stress of working at a popular bar on Red Sox game day. Might be time for management to reevaluate staff hirings.

I had the meat loaf special and it was the worst I have ever experienced. Should not be tough and chewy, but it was. While eating, people at a neighboring table finished and placed their plates on the floor for their \\"service dog\\" to lick clean. When we showed our server what was happening, she seemed unconcerned. Talked to the manager at checkout and she blamed the meat loaf on a corporate recipe, never offering anything for our issues.

What is the restaurant like? \\nThis is a casual deli, with a cafeteria-style ordering process: you wait in line, pick up your tray, place your order, and pay for your meal. Despite the regularly long queues, the diner is rather efficient at moving customers along.2. What should you get here?\\nSam LaGrassa's offers an expansive selection of sandwiches, but the most popular is undoubtedly the pastrami corned beef combo. I ordered the pastrami diablo with a side of clam chowder. The clam chowder was fine though not exactly memorable. The pastrami diablo, however, was a sandwich worth trying. This hefty sandwich was piled high with pastrami, monterey jack cheese, onions, bacon, chipotle mayo, bbq sauce, and hot cherry peppers. The pastrami was the star of the show, but the other ingredients elevated the flavor profile of the sandwich. The hot cherry peppers contributed some heat and helped to cut out the saltiness from the meat while the bacon added a welcome crunch. 3. Other notes:\\n- Only open from 11 am - 3:30 pm on weekdays\\n- The restaurant was featured on Guy Fieri's show Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives\\n- The sandwiches can be shared, especially between lighter eatersI'm glad to have finally checked this one off the Boston bucket list but I'd like to return for Sam LaGrassa's other beloved sandwiches."},{"name":"Bistro du Midi","address":"272 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"SUPERB!

My new favorite is chicken Gorgonzola with walnuts. I'm not going to lie, this dish is rich enough to qualify as risky behavior, if you live your insurance premium will likely inflate but if you don't the flavor is worthy to be the last taste on your blue lips before skipping merrily through the pearly gates, so tread lightly but fear not.

It's a relatively short bus ride from the center city, in a mostly residential area, but right across from a lot of food trucks.Unfortunately, we arrived in a frustrating block of time (2:30-5PM) between lunch and dinner, where they only offer a severely compromised menu, with probably fewer than 10 items.  We got there at 4:30 and you can't put your name down in advance, so our options were to stand around until 5 or go drink at their whiskey bar.  Instead, we went to a beer truck across the road and watched as a line quickly formed.  We rushed back over at 4:55 and luckily got our names in with a 10 minute wait.  5 minutes later and we'd have probably had to wait 2 hours.Service was pretty quick, and between three people, we ordered wings, papaya salad, boar collar, a pork belly & shoulder hot-pot, and coconut rice.  We were served water as we waited, and as others here have noted, it's a house infused coconut water.  I love actual coconut water but this was so light, and nearly room temperature so it tasted like mildly soapy tap water.Not long after, we were blessed with our first item. The papaya salad was mostly a faithfully reproduced Thai standard with an acidic tang, and savory fish-sauce goodness. My only complaint is it needed cilantro, which they brought me on request.  Then came the wings, which seem to be the foundation of their brand.  There were six of them (tip + wingette, but no drumette), and at almost $13 the consensus was that while delicious, they were overpriced.  They were covered in a sticky, sweet and spicy sauce and crisp beneath the caramelization.  Although they were good, they were not mind-blowing as billed, and if I ever go there again, I will spend that $12.50 on something else, and never miss them.Shortly after the wings, the final two dishes arrived. The boar collar was marinated in a lime-cilantro sauce.  It was really good, but I may be biased since I like a lime-forward balance, which constituted most of its flavor .The pork was oddly prepared with 4 chunks in a  clay hot pot of \\"curry.\\"  There were two meaty chunks of shoulder, and 2 very fatty blobs of pork-belly.  I pulled a shoulder piece from the opaque soup first, and I didn't realize the small number of pieces involved until I went for another chunk. I'd recommend cutting them all up and mixing it together, especially if you are splitting the dish with other people.

Good, friendly service, wonderful dark Stumptown French pressed coffee, and delightful hearty comfort food breakfasts.Being on a constant quest for the best biscuits and gravy, I tried theirs and was not disappointed.  I would describe it as \\"gourmet\\" with a twist on the traditional, but I doubt that any classic b and g lover would be disappointed.  My only small critique is that I wish they gave be a tad more gravy to go with it.  The biscuits are what makes them special, as they are sweet potato based and the most moist but still flacky biscuits I have ever had, and I think they would be just wonderful with a bit of butter and jam on them.I would like to try some of their sweet breakfast options next time, like the griddle cakes or scones."},{"name":"Island Creek Oyster Bar","address":"500 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"***This review is for 3.5 stars***Aight, here's the run down.

But I literally was listening to the table next to us, and the lady was literally jizzing all over herself because of how, \\"the party in her mouth was wild.\\" Yeah, good, but I wasn't jumping on my table screaming in wonder of how good the dish was. The other dish that was ordered was the Grilled Prime Skirt Steak. Yeah, we got steak at a seafood place. lul I'm a huge steak kind of person, and it's hard to top Del Frisco's or Grill 23, but you know, the steak wasn't that bad actually. Steak was cooked just right, and the marinade they used was a good tangy that added a nice kick to a potentially boring dish. I was impressed.

The best way to sum up Moonshine is \\"fancy Texan,\\" which I bet sounds especially appealing to out-of-towners. And since Texas is cow country, the go-to is the Jalapeno Hanger Steak or Texas Flat Iron Steak, both of which will rock your spurs off.But I'm here to talk about the immediate past, when I hit up the famous Moonshine brunch for the first time. We arrived a little past 11 and were hit with a wait time of over an hour. We weren't the only ones to put in the requisite wait, and they're nice enough to put out some cool cucumber water and complimentary muffins for those sitting in the hot Texas sun.The brunch itself is a veritable smorgasbord of all-you-can-eat goodness. I dove straight in for the meats first (corned beef hash, chicken tenders and steak fingers) complimented with a delicious broccoli cheese casserole and so-so sweet potatoes and grits.Plate number two focused on the sweets, as I piled on a waffle, cinnamon roll, some fruit, and a cappuccino bundt cake, topped off with maple syrup. I even took some maple syrup and put a little bit in my hair as I had a rough week.With still a little room to go, I went back for plate three, the egg platter. I found some green eggs scramble, a turkey croissant, and a fantastic egg-biscuit bake, all topped off with some salsa.The fifteen dollar price tag is steep, but there's more than enough to make the buffet worth it. For that price, it'd be nice if they threw in the first round of mimosas complimentary, but after a weekend in Austin, the coffee I downed was preferable.

Most of the menu is pasta except for a few \\"carne\\" items, salads, and anti-pasti. Lasagna, Linguine, Scampi, and the daily special all vanished from my companions plates. Except for the Papperdelle pasta with Wild Boar. One of my usual faves, how can you go wrong with Wild Boar? I'll tell you, first you add a red sauce, and then you top it off with an equal portion of dried mint. MINT! I know, it IS authentic, but man that's gross. Thankfully, I ordered the lasagna and it was marvelous. Fit for a goodfella. The wine and anti-pasti plates we ordered were also good. The red wine I had was a Sangiovese and it was one of the best house reds I have ever had around Portland. They could have easily fooled me into thinking it was a much more expensive wine it was so smooth with the red sauce lasagna. Fortunately my favorite dining companion couldn't make it.

And if you know about this place, then you need to go there, because it's fantastic! Well, what I had today was pretty great: a big blackened chicken sub and a side of mashed potatoes with gravy made from the chicken. So good, and the sides are GIGANTIC. They gave me a lot of mashed potatoes, and the lady said I hoped I didn't mind it in a to go bowl container. I couldn't care less, and she said she did that, since everyone came back up to ask for a to-go container anyway. Yeah, I still have mashed potatoes in my car that I'm taking home.The people a few tables over from me ordered the homemade Cajun chips, and the chips were brought out in a aluminum tray you'd use to bring a side dish over to a party. I'm not saying quantity over quality here (because they were raving about how good the chips were to the lady over the counter), but damn, that was a whole lot of chips.My chicken was cooked perfectly, and it came with their own bourbon sauce, which was pretty tasty. If you're a sauce person, they have just about every kind of sauce you need at the table. The sandwich was pretty big and so incredibly juicy. Back to the people a few tables over, the guy told the cook his steak sandwich was the best he'd ever had.I can't vouch for the rest of their food, but if you're coming here, stick to the cajun/blackened style to start off and then maybe venture out, because that's what they do best.Also, the woman that took my order/brought out the food was one of the friendliest people I've ever met. She went over the menu with me and made sure everything was cooked perfectly. She was telling me about how they made all the different food. It was great.

So plan your visit accordingly. I had the seafood tofu soup with stone bowl rice. It was the only option for tofu soup. I did not have high expectation of the seafood as it was underwhelming at another Korean restaurant with tiny shelled on shrimps and barely there seafood. I was surprised the version here was much better with de-shelled shrimps (still tiny), sweet clams and mussel (only 1 piece but it was plump and juicy sweet). The broth was not overly spicy and the tofu was soft. I like that they left the stone bowl rice for you to decide how you want to have it. I like crispy rice so I let the rice sit in it for a while.

TWO pieces appeared with the bacon side.. it was ok bacon, not bad, not great, at least she brought it crispy. and i really expect minimum three big pieces if not four on a side order.the pancakes- i did not order these, the genius child and my brother did-. i have little to say about them. i dont cook and im sure as fuck not going to pay to cook. they were fine- service/structure issues:\\nthese were bad and semi-major. first, our waitress. she may have been what my mother would call \\"slow\\". i'm not really sure- there was a slight \\"deer in headlights\\" aura to her, the combo of those two were not good. it seems obvious she had no idea what she was doing- would come to move a plate but not notice two empty glasses of water, and would take away one plate but not others that were more blatantly in our way.  there was only one waitress/manager type person who seemed to visibly be doing much of anything- i had to flag her down for water when none of the other 6 people working there looked up (and when we were there it was not full, maybe 7 tables of customers).  they really need to train their servers- i cannot imagine how horrible it is when it is crowded and employ a busser.structure- ok, i know you need that hot area (i really don't cook) to cook the pancakes on, but the ratio it takes up compared to non-hot area is simple poorly planned. there was just no room for the three items we ordered off the menu due to excessive hot area.  i also think if you are gonna make a place fun so people bring their kids, you need to think of something a bit more safe to block the hot area from the kids than a tiny half a shelfy thing.  maybe some kind of safety thing- fuck if i know but it made me a little nervous having a topless, dancing 2 year old around. given, she was more aware than i to stay away from the hot area.over all- this place is a \\"3 star\\" definition- but i really plan on not going back unless tiny dancer drags me"},{"name":"The Meatball Stoppe","address":"7325 Lake Underhill Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Outstanding food, outstanding service, outstanding value. We finally got to try The Meatball Shoppe this weekend, and I think we may starting finding excuses to head down to that area more often now.This is a tiny little restaurant in a strip mall with an annoying parking lot (not their fault). There's only five tables, and the largest one only seats six, so this is not the best place to bring a big group if you're wanting to eat in, but they do carry-out if you need to feed a bunch of people.As soon as we walked in, we were greeted by who I believe was the son of the owner. He quickly, but thoroughly explained the menu, and the options available to us and gave us some time to decide. There are a bunch of options available that sounded really good, so deciding wasn't exactly easy.I ordered the pork meatballs with pork sauce, served \\"smashed\\" (on a ciabatta bun) with the \\"gem\\" (a fried egg on top of the meatballs), and my wife ordered the vegetarian \\"meatball\\" with a classic sauce. Both come with a small salad, which was delicious.While we waited for our food, the owner chatted us up a bit, asking us how we found the place, and mentioning that they were planning on expanding the business a bit. We never found out exactly what he meant, as our orders came out pretty quickly, and he didn't want to keep us from our food.I loved my pork meatballs. My wife enjoyed the flavor of hers, but found that the texture was a bit on the dry side, needing a bit more sauce to counter just how dry it was. While she enjoyed her meal, she said she probably wouldn't order that particular item again.While the food and service were excellent, we did have a couple of small quibbles. Mind you, none of these are enough to warrant knocking off a star, even combined.First is that we got a different spiel about the menu and options than another group who came in. Granted, they were helped by a different employee, but we weren't told about the specials they had available. Second is the lack of un-bottled water. I know Orlando tap water isn't the best, but even a pitcher of Brita filtered water in the back would be acceptable. The only option for a glass of water is to purchase the $1.75 bottle.Last is the plating. Everything is served in a plastic tray with compartments.

Got a table and ended up doing dine out which was pretty good considering you could choose one appetizer, one main and dessert for $45. I was trying to find a white wine based on my palette choices and the sommelier offered a white wine which they do not typically have by the glass, after 2 attempts of whites by the glass. Great start and kind of made up for not being able to partake in their happy hour as the hostess had quite a bit of attitude about how particular they were for happy hour. As for DOV, started with the grilled octopus which was good but not great and why my rating is 4 stars and not 5. The octopus was with beans (perhaps it was indicated on the menu and I missed it), but the sauce took away the char from what I typically enjoy from a simple grilled octopus. Also, the octopus appy is $1.95 more for DOV menu but it's not as common to find in restaurants in Vancouver. My friend ordered the mussels, and it was better and great size portion for an appetizer. Then I ordered the bouillabaisse, which came with quite a bit of seafood in a tomato soup based broth. The toast made the dish, soak up all the flavors with it. My friend ordered the scallops and felt her dish was small as a main entree but scallops are expensive. Last but not least, finished it off with a sundae for dessert and not sure when was the last time I have indulged in a sundae with brownies and ice cream but devoured the brownies and half of the vanilla ice cream even though it's cold outside. Mild compared to the polar vortex but nonetheless chilly. Overall, would go back and get the mussels."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Came here and we all got the fish sauce wings easily the best chicken wings I have ever had.

In fact, when they first brought it I thought they had mistakingly brought me the 7 inch kids pizza. The 6 slices seemed about 50% larger than the slices from Blaze or Mod. My companion and I both remarked that we would probably have to eat a 2nd dinner, whereas we usually barely finish Blaze/Mod. Beyond that, the toppings were seriously lacking compared to the other two. No roasted garlic, barely any vegetables, limited meats.

The parking lot looked busy and the interior (I thought) looked more up to date than the exterior. Upon entering it felt really warm at the hostess desk and we learned later that an hvac unit was down so only one part of the restaurant was being cooled by another unit, luckily we were seated in that part of the restaurant where the AC was working. Our waitress, Melly, came over fairly quickly and though friendly she perked up a lot more when my friend asked \\"is there a must have entree on your menu\\" since we haven't been here before. She proceeded to suggest the braised lamb, lamb kabobs, moussaka, seafood casserole and then said \\"really, everything is very good here\\".She took our drink orders (water) as we plowed through the many options. The entrees included two sides and in anticipation of the large portions we skipped an appetizer but would have tried the spanakopita.Complimentary crusty mini rolls with butter was served. They arrived warm and were good but as they got cold, they got hard.We decided on: the lamb kabobs over rice, string beans with a garden salad (friend), baked haddock, string beans, fries and a garden salad (hubby) and me, the seafood casserole, roasted potatoes, veggies of the day (summer squash, carrots and broccoli) and a side Greek salad.The salads arrived and were generous in size for a side salad ($3.99 upcharge). Only negative was the small bowl it comes in which made it hard to tackle without the salad falling out. Great homemade dressing!The restaurant steadily became busy as we waited for our entrees. Our water glasses were never empty and it appears the wait staff happily covers each other's tables.It took probably 20 minutes or so from the time we finished our salads for our entrees to arrive.  The seafood casserole was very hot (2 shrimp, 4 scallops and a moderate sized haddock which we feel was cod), light breadcrumbs and not drenched in butter, potatoes appeared crunchy but possibly due to the liquid from the veggies (because they were served together on the same plate) they were not. Veggies cooked perfectly and seasoning just right.Hubby thought haddock was good but outer edges were dry, fries were ok, nothing special and he didn't really like the string beans because they were mushy and covered with stewed tomatoes.Friend requested the lamb be medium rare and Melly made a special note to the kitchen to make sure that was done and it was. Not super tender when cutting into each kabob but pretty decent when chewing it. Good flavor. Rice was lightly topped with stewed tomatoes. Friend was just glad everything wasn't covered with the stewed tomatoes...which has been our experience at another Greek restaurant recently.Stuffed but intrigued by the desserts, we chose to split the grapenut pudding with whipped cream. It arrived in an ice-cream sundae serving glass and was very generous in size. Under $4...not only was it outstanding but very inexpensive!\\n \\nTotal tab excluding tip around $83.

Just idly scanning the shelves is a treat, so much to look at. I even noticed they have a vintage DnD section!I easily killed an hour here. Some of the store employees were terribly helpful and others not so much. The fellow who raised his eyebrows at me when I asked where I could find macrame books was still quick helpful.

Since they are so close in cuisine, it's impossible to state whether it is one or another. It could come down to the style of harissa they use, or \\"Les Patisserie Orientales\\" they serve or don't serve, but it is not a useful barometer. It's a Magreb or North African place, but not Moroccan for sure.Another more important barometric indicator seems to be Ali. Ok, she has mood swings. Sometimes she's sweet, sometimes she's unhinged. I know a lot of North Africans and I can tell, nothing out of the ordinary. She just has a larger personality than you do, different peccadilloes. The track suit and hijab thing? Hell, half of all arab girls dress like that. The track suit is somewhat de riguer in Marseilles and Paris, tracing it's roots to early rap artists here (RunDMC, etc.) when expatriate Arabs easily picked up on rap way before the English or other cultures. The food is pretty good, but quite honestly, me and my friends make the best cous-cous. Well, if you have a problem with Ali, try this. Just go nuts. Wave your hands wildly. She will do the same, and might kick you out, or you might get what you want. I've observed many, many near-death shouting matches between my friends. After I will ask one of them, \\"What's that about?\\" He'll say something like, \\"Oh, they were out of turkey.\\" If you don't express yourself with the same intensity level, you might as well be a carpet.

As we began to depart from Whiskey Soda Lounge and head over to Pok Pok, it is near 9:00 and we are challenged by our own sanity - to brave such a lengthy wait. I don\`t want to flip any tables. One of Pok Pok \`s selling points is its display of seating which flavours streets of Southeast Asia. Hightop communion tables, exposed light fixtures, random room dividers. It is the hole in the wall / dive which perhaps attracts tourists, locals and hipsters. As we paced thru the crowds, we noticed the chefs in the kitchen ...We were brought to the back room. A sort of make shift addition to the whole structure. It resembled much of a basement from your grandparents' old house or perhaps an old 70s diner. Vintage is the new \\"new\\" right?Our drinking water is flavored with Pandanus leaf, as is done often in Northern Thailand - coconut tasting with toasted rice / vanilla / grassy flavor.Khao Soi Chix 12.50: Northern Thai mild curry noodle soup made with their secret curry paste recipe and house-pressed fresh coconut milk. Served with house pickled mustard greens, shallots, crispy yellow noodles and roast chili paste. The broth was light, not very spicy even after we folded in the chili paste. The crispy noodles were a nice addition followed by a few sparing noodles. The chicken? Chicken drums sticks soaked into the soup sans seasoning and flavour.\\n \\nDa Chom's Laap Meuang 14: Northern Thai spicy hand-minced pork \\"salad\\" with aromatics, spices, herbs, crackling and crispy fried shallots and garlic. On the menu it said learned from Da Chom a friend's father from the village Saluang Nai near Chiang Mai, Thailang. The \\"salad\\" portion was quite the joke as it appears to be usual sides provided at any typical Vietnamese Pho noodle restaurants. This dish resembles much of Phnom Penh's dry noodle toppings. Taste perhaps slightly spicier. Not a bad dish, just I could've had this at PP in Vancouver less 3 hours wait time. Meh!Kaeng Hung Leh 12.50: Northern Thai sweet, pork belly and pork shoulder curry with ginger, palm sugar, turmeric, tamarind. Burmese curry powder and pickled garlic. A Chiang Mai classic... Again, reminiscent of a popular Chinese dish Fatty pork belly braised in a piping hot claypot. Four pieces of pork belly, that is $3.125 / piece. Inflation must have hit America overnight. I give it the pork belly was tender, juicy and flavourful of spice. Again, I could have driven 30 mins to Richmond, BC for this dish.Pok Pok Affogato 7.00: Condensed milk ice cream drowned in a shot of Vietnamese coffee served with Chinese donut. The silkiness of the sweet ice cream is heavenly but the small balls died a tragic death in the sea of coffee. It came melted and unappetizing. I wasn't sure how to eat this Chinese donut. Was there supposed to be a side of congee? We dunked the fried flour sticks into the coffee and melted ice cream. Eww, how awful. Some things clearly do not mix well together. We quickly scooped the ice cream and left the rest. Maybe just order the ice cream on its own. Creekside Coffee Roaster in Coquitlam offers a better presentation and flavour .My challenge to you is for you Pok Pok lovers to drive up to Vancouver and try the above mentioned restaurants.

Husband and I met some friends here for drinks and dinner one night per their suggestion. Although we have been to this shopping center many times (for lots of fro-yo) we had never been to this restaurant. They suggested it as it was one of their favorites. The restaurant itself is unassuming. There is nothing that stands out about it, except that it was larger than I had expected (an extra room in the back that I didn't think would be there). We were seated immediately, as the restaurant was about half full.We ordered some authentic beers (and had the option of a regular size beer for ~$4 or a giant beer for ~$7). They were served in cold glasses. There were many other drinks to choose from as well, but I decided not to venture from the beer. Their sushi menu was extensive. Everything was half off, so clearly, we had to order WAY too much. We ordered a side of fried rice, very good by the way, and 6 rolls. Spider, rainbow, California, Mexican something or other (for Husband who doesn't eat raw fish), and salmon tempura. We obviously couldn't finish it... but they were good. My least favorites were the spider roll and the tempura. Tempura didn't have much flavor (as it was only salmon tempura in rice and seaweed), and the spider roll just wasn't as good as I had expected. The rainbow roll was delish! The Mexican roll was also really good and flavorful, but did have a spicy sauce on top, so be wary of that... Service was random. We received our side of rice first, even though someone ordered a salad. Then we received our sushi plate a good 5/10 min before the other couple received theirs. The other couple commented that this was common for this restaurant, and they would routinely get food out of logical order and the table would never get their food at the same time. Also, our server would disappear for long stints of time, coming to check on us just once or twice during the entire meal... not sure why as the restaurant wasn't crowded.Overall, we had a ton of food and left happy. We spent more than we would have normally... but we got twice the amount of food we would have at another place (i.e. if the rolls had been regular priced, we would probably have gotten 3 rolls, not 6...).

My food came out about 8-9 minutes after my husbands and daughters. I was starting to think they'd forgotten my food. Food was a three star. Service dropped off a little from there. It wasn't that the waitress was doing a bad job, but she was just too busy taking orders, waiting all the tables, answering the phone and filling water glasses. Our daughter had the chicken satay.

All that's missing is a working juke box and waitresses on roller skates. Their menu is very limited. In terms of food, it's really just a burger that you can customize - 4 different types of patties and all the usualy fixings with a few extra. I ended up with the ground turkey burger. The burger alone is $8 but you can have the platter with fries for $11. I didnt find it as flavorful (or oily) as a beef patty and a little cranberry sauce would've done it wonders but it was still very tasty. The accompanying fries were fresh and tasted almost home made. Overall, it was good value for the price.     The second half of their menu is made up of drinks - milkshakes, sodas, floats, etc. This is the real feature here. It was a steamy 24 degrees outside so a Coke float was a must-have. I haven't had one of these since I was 10 years old and the creamy fizziness tasted like heaven.

Ultimately we came back to Manna. Here's where things get dicey. We all ordered sodas which come in a can here. The server brought them out to us in the can, with a straw.... I've rarely seen this in a restaurant. They usually bring out additional cups with ice in them. So I requested a cup of ice. In a fairly passive aggressive move the waitress proceeded to loudly make THREE cups of ice. My companions didn't request cups of ice and given how loud she was being, it appeared a message was being sent. Second, apparently their kimchi jjigae comes with medium tofu versus soft and their Doenjang jjigae is made with the soft tofu that I prefer. Their menu doesn't have Sundubu jjigae or Budae jjigae. I'm not Korean (obviously) and I usually get Korean food at certain restaurants in Houston where I'm a familiar enough face that I just have to awkwardly point rather than mangle the dish's name. So I asked if they could make the Kimchi Jjigae with soft tofu and the waitress seemed miffed that I asked but stated they could do so. Okay so I actually prefer Budae Jjigae but because it wasn't on the menu I had to google the name to prevent confusion. In the one minute it took me to google the name and then run up to the counter the waitress said my order couldn't be changed.... wait what? 1. The dishes are fairly similar. 2. I felt like she was intentionally being difficult. 3. There's no humanly possible way my dish was already completed at that point and couldn't be modified to the dish I wanted instead. Once our dishes hit the table (we started with the seafood pancake) I realized that 1. Unlike previous reviewers they placed the banchan in dishes for us (previous reviewers self served their banchan) 2. The Seafood pancake was salty. I'm very salt tolerant so if I say something is salty, it's definitely salty. 3. In contrast my modified Jjigae was bland. I don't know if they decided to give me the \\"foreigner spice level special\\" or what happened but it did not rock my world. The thing that was odd was that our food was brought out by the owner who was apparently in the kitchen and she later dropped by to ask how things were. She was very friendly and had she taken our order I'm sure my experience would have been different.However as it stands, my experience was actually kind of bad. I don't know that I would want to come back given the passive aggressive nature of our original server and just the bland flavor of the Jjigae. Sorry, I know I'm not Korean, but that doesn't mean that I don't know what good Korean food should taste like."},{"name":"Shigezo Izakaya","address":"910 SW Salmon St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Shigezo sullenly at me, with her long golden hand-made hair and piping hot pork-miso broth.

I guess I could just have a little...\\"Yup, this is pretty much the conversation that was going through my head as I sat at the booth in the back of this very Japanese izakaya and stared at the delicious-smelling bowl of Ramen in front of me. And it's not the first time either.The food at Shigezo will make you do stuff like that. It's good. Quite good... in a very comforting Japanese kind of way. The menu runs the gamut from kushiyaki to robata to hot and cold plates to sushi to ramen to okinomiyaki and all sorts of good stuff. It's like my Japanese dream come true. I've had the chance to sample items from all of the different stations now, and I have yet to be disappointed. The sushi is fresh and the rice is made quite well (perfect consistency). The okinomiyaki I liked a lot, and at $5.95 is a heck of a deal. The ramen is done right, with a ton of pork in a dark, meaty/salty broth with a nice layer of oil on top. While I'd say that the broth is not quite what Yuzu pulls off, the hand-made noodles are far superior to anything I've had in town. A stand out dish from the cold plates menu is the Japanese Caesar - a romaine salad in a creamy dashi dressing with parmesan and smoked salmon on top. A soft-cooked egg is thrown in for good measure. It's a delightful play on the flavors of a Caesar but with a softer, smokier flavor. This will be one of those dishes I order each time I come, it's that good. I crave it. The sak√© list is not the longest in town but it's carefully considered, and they offer most by the glass, 12oz pot or full bottle. The list includes favorites like Cabin in the Snow and The 55 Watari Bune. It would take me a long time to tire of this list. I love that they offer the 12oz pot so I can get multiple sakes in one sitting.The layout is really fun, with lots of dark wood and a giant salvaged tree trunk hanging above the entry way. There's a sushi bar, a bar, booths, tatami rooms, and \\"zen booths\\" - booths with bean bags upon which you sit cross legged - like a cross between tatami and booth. I dig the laid back feel of the zen booths a lot.  So with all this love, I can't quite pull the 5th star out yet. Why? The kinks. They exist. The management is super nice and the waitstaff is on point, but there's something lost in translation between the staff and the kitchen... or something. The last 2 times I went in either something was not ordered, or there was confusion between the kitchen and the servers as to what exactly was in a dish, or something similar. There are some inconsistencies in the menu to match. I was well taken care of both times, but I'm guessing that some culture clash exists and some settling needs to happen before this machine is well greased and chugging along at peak performance. It's a new spot so that's to be expected. I'm sure they'll pull it out and I look forward to coming back in quite often. I have a lot of menu left to get through! And once I do I'm sure this will be an easy 5-star call. For some great food at a very reasonable price in an eminently Japanese setting, this is it for the downtown Portland core."},{"name":"Brassica","address":"2212 E Main St","city":"Bexley","stars":"4.5","text":"This was an excellent choice for eating this type of food for the first time.

I also had a couple shots of this amazing coffee from Italy - my tastebuds are usually too innocent for espresso, but I can tell this is great stuff. After I fueled up, I was way more psyched for a grueling study sesh a couple blocks away at BookPeople. By the way, the place is called DJ crepes, and they definitely follow that theme with a \\"sweet playlist\\" and a \\"savory playlist\\" of crepes.

Those kinds of colors are only possible when the food is FRESH, and indeed the taste matched the appearance. The \\"karage\\" was sooooo juicy, and it was clear the meat had been cut, prepared, and fried immediately after we'd ordered it. You definitely need to put a piece of the pickled ginger on the chicken for a full flavor experience. Some kind of dressing or sauce on top of the rice or side salad would have been nice. Otherwise they were a little bland. As it is though, the simple elegance of the food was respectable. I like that even though I was eating fried chicken, I didn't feel gross afterwards. It was lightly fried and breaded, with the emphasis on the great pieces of meat. Might we expect a brick and mortar \\"DONYA\\" establishment one day? At $9 for the karage and rice, I thought it was a little steep for the amount of food we got based on food cart standards.

Omelettes, benedicts, waffles, and French toast-all the classics! And beautifully crafted coffee drinks. There is white paper on the table with crayons to entertain the kids (and the adults too).Ordered the macchiato, an authentic one, not a cup of caramel and sugar like one from Starbucks (not to say that I don't buy those myself).

Two of the most beautifully poached eggs I have ever seen with tender lobster and avocado on the honey butter biscuits (you need to ask for biscuits or English muffin).

They only serve boiled seafood platters, so the menu is limited. The cashier was very friendly and greeted me with a smile. I decided on the snow crab combo which seems to be their most popular dish. It comes with two snow crab clusters, jumbo shrimp, sausage, corn and potatoes. The wait was only about 15 minutes before my order was called. When I picked up my food, I was shocked by how heavy it was. It smelled wonderful and I rushed home to dig in. When I opened the box, I was slightly disappointed to discover mostly potatoes. They were a little over cooked and mushy as well. The crab legs were a nice size and the crab was sweet. The shrimp were huge and cooked perfectly. Everything was completely drenched in garlic butter, so if you're not a fan, request less or ask that they put it on the side. Overall, it was decent.

This BBQ joint barbecue joint offers a great range of BBQ classics and creative remakes of the familiar BBQ eats born across the South...from smoked meats galore to Brunswick Stew....to traditional and no-traditional  snacks like fried gator....and salivating-worthy comfort food sides. Smoke Ring serves a range of good food and drinks that will have you thinking about seconds...if not thirds. We found this to be the case as we dined on a number of small and large eats from this place.Located walking distance from the new Mercedes-Benz Superdome & Philips Arena, in downtown Atlanta.....Smoke Ring is a great place to stop before or after a game....or just for when in need for some comforting eats and drinks.  We did just that...all of the above, after an event to avoid the horrible traffic that has become the norm in Atlanta.We grubbed on:* Jumbo Smoked Wings -- Definitely satisfying, with smoked flavor down to the bone!* Fried Chicken Tenders -- Surprisingly huge!  I'm talking almost the size of a whole breast piece.  Fried well, but could of use a little bit more seasoning. We had to rely on the Honey Mustard sauce for added flavor.* Full Rack Baby Backs -- Meaty, tender and oh...sooo smoky. Definitely a standout and one of my favorites of all the items we tried.  Let me tell you - it's a crime to put sauce on these ribs. The seasoning they use and the flavor of the meat was so good, you really didn't need any sauce. One thing I can say is.... that they do not serve skimpy baby backs up in this piece.  Each bite left you with a mouthful of tasty, smoked meat! * Crispy Brussel Sprouts --  Outstanding!  Crispy, tasty and so good.  Actually so good, we ordered seconds.  The Bourbon Maple drizzle complements this dish very well.* Deviled Eggs -- Although, it is not thing.  My friends said they were delicious and topped with a spicy filling on top of the egg that added an extra kick.* Smoked & Fried Gator Tail --  Very interesting dish.  Tener meat, even while fried with left you witha flavor profile of eating fried chicken and fish at the same time because of it texture and appeal.* Brunswick Stew -- The only total let down of the whole night!  Being from Georgia and knowing what good Brunswick Stew taste like...this was definitely not it.  The attempt was worthy but save yourself a few dollars and try the Potato Salad which was a hit-- knockout!Honorable Mentions:  The Collards and Chipotle Corn were equally good eats and comforting.

Menu is Persian and a bit of Afghani dishes. 3 of us shared two appetizers: Dolmades, which were melt in your mouth good, and Kashk-bodemjan, a mashed eggplant with fried onions served with pita - just heavenly taste.  Main dishes are served with a very large portion of basmati rice, sometimes fried with carrots and raisins, like in the Qabuli Palaw or steamed with the kebabs. The lamb shank in the Qabuli Palaw was soft and so flavourful. Served with a sauce and also spinach, it was delicious.  The veggie kebab had very thin slices of grilled veggies with the steamed basmati rice on the side. Another time I Had the Fesenjan stew, chicken stew made with pomegranate walnuts, and served with rice.   Reasonable prices and large quantities. Open for lunch or dinner. The decor would make this pleasant for a date night,too. Tea is cardamom infused and served with China pot and cups. I felt pampered. \\nI returned on an evening and was very disappointed, not by the food,  but by the awful service. It can spoil a meal. We ordered appetizers, which were an eggplant & tomato mix. Very nice,  but the amount of pita bread that came with it was pitiful. How do you eat a dip if you have no pita left?  We asked for sengak, the flat Persian bread but the male server said it wasn't served with appetizers, only main courses. What's with that?  He didn't bring any more pita, either.   Tea was a bag in a glass cup times 4 people. Don't ask for milk, they don't have any. \\nMain courses are piled high with rice, with the main course on the side. We were 4 people. Yet, only 3 meals were brought out. We waited & waited. Finally I said, where's my meal?  They hadn't even noticed it was missing. After more wait, it finally arrived. I think it wasn't even cooked when I asked. No explanation or apology. No water offered, no checking in with us if we needed anything. A knife fell when he brought our order. The server said, no problem but he never brought another one. \\nWhen we finished our meals, nobody took the plates away. We sat talking, still no service. I finally asked him to take the plates away. Too bad about the poor service, it spoiled the meal. We found the music made it hard to hear each other & the lighting overly bright.

No ramen yet, though I'm definitely not against it in the future.Overall the sushi is good, and better than supermarket quality. The rice was of high quality, and the roll was more or less balanced. No issues with the fish either.Now, out of what I'd ordered, even for spicy lovers, I would go for the Maki Combo as there is a nicer assortment of sushi there. In other words, you can actually taste a difference between the three kinds of rolls.The regular combo has a little heat, don't you worry. It's just not in every piece.This is where this place's weakness comes through. In the Spicy Maki Combo, the rolls looked the same and tasted the same. It wasn't until I look a few apart that I noticed the fish inside was different. The piece was a little towards the smaller side, perhaps if it was a tad bigger a difference would be more noticeable. Hakata works great as a workday lunch or dinner when you're too lazy to cook. I'll put it to you this way, if you want to treat yourself, this could work. If you want to \\"treat yo self\\" or otherwise celebrate something, there could be better options.Prices are reasonable and competitive for what you get and the area. Oh, and the small miso soup and green salad are unmemorable (other than the delightful dressing) but a nice touch nonetheless. I almost gave three stars, but trying to justify it all I could come up with is the homogeneity of the Spicy combo.

I'm guessing a habanero-based sauce here; I'll give it about a 7 out of 10 on my spicy scale. The Garlic Parmesan, not so much a fan here. As for the garlic parmesan, I liked that the garlic did not overwhelm my taste buds, and I liked the parmesan cheese sprinkled over the top. However, as far as appearance goes, the garlic and butter looked extremely unappetizing on the chicken.The boneless wings were breaded well, but they were very small and reminded me more of popcorn chicken. On my last boneless atomic wing, I bit into the chicken and I saw the red tendons of the chicken breast -- which I at first mistook for pink raw chicken. I didn't get sick or anything, but I opted to throw that piece away.The person taking my order didn't really smile a lot or make me feel too welcome. To be fair, she did her job well, but could have smiled a lot more. The inside is clean, but Wing Stop went overboard on saturating the walls with picture frames. The lights also look hideous.

Started with the Crispy Oyster Sliders, 3 large plump, golden brown oysters on super-buttery, pillowy, brioche, with just a light schmear of mayo and hint of lemon, delicious.  Got a sampling of local raw oysters (expensive), asked for the briny ones:  Sippican, Peter's Point, Chatham, Island Creek, Wellfleet; came icy cold, shucked OK (mine did have flecks of shell in them), with mignonette, fresh lemon and cocktail sauce.  Enjoyed the culinary tour of the bay.  The New Bedford Scallops were perfectly cooked, came with a really stunning spring pea and mint mash and shaved radishes, very seasonal.  The famous Lobster Roe Noodles were an impressive plate, lots of lobster chunks, spring peas, barely perceptible mushrooms on my plate (didn't look like other's pics at all), tender shreds of short rib (which were delicious but overwhelming for this dish, clashed with the lobster and roe).  Most disappointing of the night was Mrs. Bennett's Seafood Casserole, a dark broth strongly flavored with lobster and shrimp shells, was described as bisque-like, but was imbalanced and soupy, had some overcooked monkfish, salmon and shrimp floating in it.

She ordered the ube soup with sago & rice ball, and I ordered the Snow White mango juice with sago. \\nI personally like the Snow White mango juice with sago, the mango taste sweet and soft, the sago is a bit uncooked but it's fine. \\nBut the ube soup with sago and rice ball... that taste awful, I only had tried one sip, and it taste nothing like ube, it is so thick and kinda weird at the same time, not like the ube I had tasted at other stores. Some of the sago is not fully cooked again, and the rice ball is so watery too. \\nWhich my friend who had went there twice told me that their rice ball was not like that before. But for some reason they have turned watery this time and it makes her feel a bit unpleasant. \\nFor conclusion, I like my dessert, the mango is sweet and everything taste fine except the ube soup.

It was a special menu, so this review is based on an overall experience.The meal was a 3 course dinner with cocktails. The first course was a salad with a squash mouse on a crostini and a cranberry champagne spritzer. It was soooo good! 2nd course was carved turkey with cranberry walnut stuffing. The cocktail was an absolute apple cider martini. I think this course literally took me all of 2 minutes to inhale. I have been craving it for days...it was amazing.The 3rd course was a candy cane bread pudding with a kahlua hot chocolate. I have only the tiniest amount of room left to fit this decadent dessert, but I did it...kind of. I couldn't finish the hot chocolate.So the food is incredible here. The drinks are delicious.

However, one aspect I believe they lacked in comparison to other Korean restaurants in the area was their BBQ.  Many other restaurants in the area offer all you can eat (AYCE) KBBQ and until recently Korea House was missing out on this trend.  The, from what I can tell, new AYCE menu is offered at two tiers 30 dollars and 20 dollars, with a difference in cuts offered.  The 30 dollar option is a vastly better option as you get 6-7 more options than the 20 dollar variant.During my time there we ordered 7 of the 9 available cuts of meat; tongue, brisket, pork belly, bone in and bone out short rib, ribeye, and pork bulgogi.  Of the 7 the cuts that stuck out the most to me were the pork belly, not too thick of a cut and was able to crisp up quickly, and the brisket, large cuts with good marbling.  Another point that should be made is the marinade, usually I find KBBQ marinades to overpower the meat quality, however at Korea House the marinade did well to complement the meat quality, especially in the short rib.  It should be mentioned that the portion sizes were slightly smaller than what I was used to at other KBBQ joints; although this let me order more cuts to try, both a pro and a con.  The 6 different sides included are welcomed variants of the usual KBBQ bonchon.In comparison to other AYCE KBBQ joints in the area, I feel that Korea House is a great mid-tier choice.  They do a lot of things well such as meat quality and service, and excel in their marinades. That being said, I believe the Korea House BBQ experience can be summed up as a jack of all trades but a master in none (except the marinades).  For its price and location it is definitely a go-to for those not willing to drive to downtown Orlando for the competition.-Matthew"},{"name":"Moretti's","address":"5849 Sawmill Rd","city":"Dublin","stars":"4.5","text":"Pro Tip - MAKE A RESERVATION.

You can tell that the shrimp was really fresh as well. We ended up splitting the chicken and waffles. Waffle was probably the best thing I ate here. It literally tasted like a cornbread waffle. The chicken was crispy on the outside and some parts were pretty moist. I would have preferred a little more flavor on the chicken and I don't really think the lemon butter went well on the chicken.

I'm a restaurant operations manager, and I can immediately see all the sorts of things that are wrong and messing up the system.  It's the online ordering system that's jamming up the WHOLE system and making the eat-in customers wait atrociously.  I understand that Torchy's is awesome, but the online order system is gonna be the death knell.  People who order online come in here acting all that and grabbing their warm food while those who eat in have to wait.  Why don't you eliminate this system and have everyone wait in line that way the world returns to spinning on it's righteous axis while everyone graciously waits because they know that no bully is cutting the line.  Further, the kitchen set up is so small that the workers cannot freely move about.  They are crammed in such a small space which hinders their efficiency.  Lastly, I have never seen such a high turnover restaurant like Torchy's.  Each time I go there there's a new employee at the cashier.

Then the waiter came back out to inform me that beans too were out. What the heck, people?! I can understand running out of ONE thing, but three?

I was in Portland for 4 or 5 days and managed to visit Powell's three times. I'm still in awe at how much there is to see -- the different floors, book recommendations, and events. Everything is color-coded and easy to navigate. I spent a lot of time in the front section with all the staff picks, as well as mystery books, professional development books, and puzzles and games. I had to resist buying a ton of stuff. Luckily I was limited by the size of my suitcase. If I lived in Portland, there would be no stopping me! There's even a coffeeshop attached to the bookstore, because they obviously go together. I spend hours here during my busy trip, and I felt so calm and relaxed. All the stressed out voices in my head telling me to go go go were suddenly silenced in the presence of Powell's.

This place took me totally by surprise! It's on the backside of a mostly abandoned strip mall, and from the outside it does not look like much. The inside however is tastefully decorated and was a quiet comfortable atmosphere. The first thing you judge Mexican restaurant by the chips and salsa. These were probably the most amazing tortilla chips I've had my entire life. No joke. A company called fiesta something out of San Antonio makes them and it's one of the only things not made in house. I can understand why they get their chips there, as trying to make something better would be darn near impossible. The chips could almost be described as fluffy. They just snap crackle and pop in your mouth and fall apart into delicious salty goodness. The salsa was also amazing and did not disappoint. It was definitely a little spicy, bordering on perfection.  I got a side of queso, for $2.50 which was not listed on the menu and was the perfect complement to my basket of chips.  It was good, but dare I say like Velveta... The chips however with the salsa and a little queso made up for that fact. I ordered Emma's plate with the puffy taco and enchilada, both beef Picadillo. There was potato diced up in the Picadillo, but it really just made things wonderful. It was seasoned terrific, unlike some ground beef at other places. The rice was delicious and flavorful on its own, which seems to be hard for some restaurants to do and the beans were covered with cheese that had been baked in the oven so the cheese had a burnt brownness to it.  Gooey and delicious.   The puffy taco shell was also melt in your mouth delicious and at $9, the lunch value was perfect! Come give this place a try, and you yelpers will not be disappointed.

It's a bit more 'formulaic' in the way of a chain (decor only)... doesn't have the quirky eccentricities the other three places have... but the food is consistently good. As a lover of salsa, and home-made hot-sauces, Maizal 'gets' that a salsa doesn't have to burn going in and burn going out. Taste is about more than pure heat, and their sauces reflect that.

We took the bus from downtown and finally got here around 6:30pm on a Saturday evening... and the wait was 45 minutes. We put our names in, gave the hostess my phone number to text, and headed down to a local bar to get a flight of beers to pass the time with. It actually only took about 30 minutes to get us seated and... well, the ensuing meal was AMAZING.1. Get the famous vietnamese chicken wings - it's doused in an extremely tasty fish sauce, which is sweet but salty all at once. It's crisp on the outside and super tender and juicy on the inside. BUT, extremely messy AND quite salty... so be sure to order some additional plates to balance out the flavor.2. Papaya Salad - SPICY but tasty. Pretty legit, actually from what I remember of my trip in N. Thailand. Great to pair with the chicken and cancel out a bit of the saltiness of the fish sauce wings.3. Sticky rice - pretty tasty and a good channel for flavors into your body.4. I forgot what this noodle dish was called, but it was a creamy broth soup with rice noodles, crispy fried noodles (which were a bit excessive) and melt off your bone chicken. 5. Get the drinking vinegars. I know this sounds bizarre, but it's basically a fizzy soda infused with drops of flavor (I got the lychee and it was delicious). By the time it hit 8pm, it was 2 hour wait... so if you come, come early. I highly recommend trying this James Beard winning restaurant... even if it's not the most legit Thai food I've had. It's still by far some of the tastiest."},{"name":"Island Creek Oyster Bar","address":"500 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Island creek is hit with me! The selection of Oysters was great, but the Ceviche\` was awesome. Had the Lobster Roe Pasta which was very special. The pasta was soooo good I could have just eaten only that and been very happy. This is their signature dish, and I would agree however, the beef short rib that came with it was good but not necessary and in my opinion, as it took away from the base flavor. The bread and butter was awesome! The butter had an orange flavor and bread was crusty and fresh. I had a Belgian Pilsner called Bavik. It was light with a slight aftertaste reminiscent of a German pilsner. The dessert of Banoffee Pie was extraordinary! It had a nice light topping (which was the best part) and with a layer of seared bananas over a graham cracker crust. I cannot wait to go back.

I don't really enjoy the flavor of peppers or the smell, which was unfortunate because I couldn't choose to have those removed from the lo mein. I picked them out, but the flavor was still on a majority of the dish.

Thank goodness.Let me lay the scene: this is an old mechanic's garage that's been hollowed out, filled with a gorgeous bar, and given life.  You'll walk in to gently glowing wood, polished glassware, and a tap lineup that will make you sing.  Out back is a large patio with festive lights.  This bar feels very intimate, and the decor and ambience were clearly chosen carefully.  This is a bar you lose track of time in.  It's glorious.Harry, the owner/barkeep, is a wealth of beer knowledge for someone so young.  I believe he's 25, but will drop knowledge on you like a brewmaster that's been at it for 40 years.  I appreciate the level of nerd Harry brings to understanding his offerings, their taste profiles, and what food to pair them with.  He asked my companion, \\"What do you usually drink?\\" And when my friend said he wasn't a beer drinker and preferred whisky and scotch, Harry's face crinkled up in a smile, and he shortly brought back a handle of Kwak, which my friend thoroughly enjoyed.  If you think your lady friend might shy away from these stronger beers, have no fear.  Buster's has a ready supply of Framboise and Peche Lambics for our more tame-palated brethren.  Ain't no shame in that game.One of the most charming parts of Sanford is how much love is shared between the bars and other businesses on this little stretch of downtown.

I had made a reservation for our group. The table was ready when we arrived, but the waiter was seriously less than attentive. I think we sat there for almost 25 minutes before he asked us to place a drink order. We ordered a bottle of wine and a Mango Alexander. The bottle came quickly but come to find out, they have run ACROSS THE STREET to their sister bar \\"Whisky Soda Lounge\\" to get their mixed drinks. It took forever, and the waiter had to be reminded. Once we actually did place our food order, the meal came quickly. The chicken wings were fabulous but most of the rest of the dishes were WAY over spiced. One dish even came with ice chips to cool your pallette. That's a little intense. Again, the waiter failed to bring one of the dishes and it had to be brought to his attention that it was missing. He continually disappeared for long periods at a time. We commented upon the check arriving about how he's made us wait a lot and he said he had removed the auto gratuity for large parties. I'm doubtful he did that, in fact we think he lied about it. The bill seemed higher than it should have been. We had written on the back of the receipt how much each person was paying with cash and then we had 2 cards. OH and they don't split checks, and if you have more than 3 cards they charge you an additional fee per extra card beyond 3. Anyway, serveral of the people who put in cash, expected change, which he never brought. He applied ALL the cash the bill and I got stuck wiht the final remainder which was much higher than what I ordered. To boot, it was unclear what had happened with the tip situation. I personally think it's a scam. He didn't remove the auto gratuity and then expected us to give him more. He never came back to the table for us to figure it out and we all were so annoyed at this point that we left. We decided to go grab another drink across the street at Whiskey Soda Lounge...BIG MISTAKE AGAIN. They charge auto gratuity at the bar as well for large groups. A BAR. We were even sitting at 3 separate tables, 2 at a table. And still they put everything on one large check, wouldn't separate. Once someone paid their bill the new bill did not remove the paid items.

The only reason I don't give Torchy's 5 stars is that the Ice Tea is terrible. Normally, I use an establishments Ice Tea as a gauge for restaurant cleanliness. If they don't keep the ice tea container cleaned out, it gets cloudy with sediment and tastes terrible. Torchy's tea appears to be clear, it simply tastes terrible. I think this case may simply be a poor choice in brand of tea, not an indication of  poor maintenance. Fix the tea & I'll give them 5 stars!\\nUpdate: The current Taco of the month (\\"The Scarecrow\\") is awesome. It's some kind of pumpkin encrusted chicken. It also has carrots which add an interesting addition to the flavor. It is to die for, especially if you add the Diablo sauce.

I was able to cajole a slice of pie from my better half and was not quite as enamored. Given my never-ceasing obsessive love of cheese I can't even believe that my brain can formulate this thought but I really think the pizza had too much cheese on it.

I filed a complaint through the 1-800 line and they sent the complaint to the appropriate store for them to resolve the issue.\\nI have contacted the 1-800 line at least three times, and they are astonished that the District Manager has not attempted to contact me within the last 8 months.

Nonetheless, they offer a consistently good product with friendly, efficient service.Coffee/Food: Java Monkey serves only fair trade coffee, which I consider admirable in terms of the promotion of healthier work conditions and greater economic incentives for producers. In addition to offering a standard variety of coffee and drink options, they also serve wine and small entrees. They do sell some desserts from Southern Sweets, but I always find the assortment to be limited and seemingly devoid of freshness. Service: The staff are friendly and efficient, but appear to be overworked. It would certainly behoove the management to schedule a few extra employees, particularly on the weekends.Atmosphere: Incredibly hipster, to the point of being uncomfortable. However, if you live in a state of perpetual disinterest, wear horn-rimmed or Elvis Costello-style glasses, or frequently use the term \\"post modern\\", or \\"POMO\\", as a adjective, noun, and verb, then this is certainly the place for you.Cost: Commensurate with most other coffee shops in the area. A cup of regular coffee will run you a couple dollars; entrees are all less than $10.Other: Parking can be problematic since Java Monkey is directly adjacent to Decatur Square. Although there is a paid parking lot across the street, there are free lots located on the other side of the square and ample street parking is available on the surrounding streets."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I don't know what the dang big deal is w Pok Pok.

Anyways back to the review. The place is small. It's tiny. Very \\"homely\\" vibe. They only have a few tables inside and the kitchen and dish washing station is in the same room as the dining area. When you sit down they immediately bring you water and bread (not toasted) and butter. There is one server for the entire restaurant and he also serves as the cashier and host. Something tells me he's either the owner or associated with the family that owns the place based on how much effort he was putting into coordinating things. The menu is written in chalk on wall and their specialties are fried calamari and pasta dishes with various seafood add ons. They also serve other dishes but these seem to be their most popular items. We got an order of friend calamari to share I ordered shrimp and scallops with pasta in a white sauce and my friend ordered calamari pasty with red sauce. Both were delicious but I preferred the white sauce. The red sauce has a sweet taste I wasn't crazy about. The wait was absolutely insane so what led me to give the place 5 stars?

Bartender was friendly, quick, and our table was ready by the time our friends arrived.Our waitress came by promptly, took our drink orders, but then took 15+ minutes before she returned with drinks.  It appeared she was busy with also servicing adjacent tables, but the restaurant wasn't overly busy nor did they appear to be short-staffed.  From this point on, despite our waitress being very friendly and knowledgeable about the menu, the service...was.....so.......slow..........For a 4-person casual meal where we ordered 1 dozen oysters, 3 entrees, 4 small plates, 2 desserts and 2 rounds of drinks, we were there for over 3 hours.Thankfully the food itself was quite good, although the pace of service affected the temperature of our small plates.  By the time we got them for sharing, they were moderately warm to lukewarm (but still safely edible).Given the buzz of Commonwealth's opening, we were hoping for an \\"A\\" experience but left feeling more like we got a \\"B\\".

I ordered \\"Steel Cut Oatmeal\\" with everything, but sugar on the side.  When my oatmeal came out, it was plain, only with sugar on the side.  No nuts or berries.  Person delivering the meal was very helpful and fixed it quickly.  The person who took my order, was very slow, did not know how to get \\"sugar on the side\\", then I had a coupon for a free cookie, again she did not know how to enter that.  But even if you don't know how to do things, there are basic things you can tell to customer to make them welcomed.  That was missing.When we got to our booth, I went to sit, and the whole table slid.  There is little space in the booth (and I am skinny), but had to step on the leg of the table, which was very sliding on the floor.  Also, while we ate, a couple times table slid just from putting our elbows on the table.  I've never seen such a sliding table at a restaurant.  The free cookie I got is a fine very basic chocolate chip cookie, but for a bakery that's unexceptable.  It was not as good as HEB chocolate cookie, and was not looking as well.  I had higher hopes for a cookie in the bakery.Prices are great, coffee was great, oatmeal was outstanding after I got all the fixings.  My husband had french toast and enjoyed it as well.

You can't ignore that the joint also serves up Mediterranean food.  I tried their falafel, and though I didn't grow up with Mediterranean food in the home, it was the best falafel I've ever had.  Not too dry and adequately seasoned.  The tahini it came with was uniquely delicious and homemade.

Another example is a waitress bringing us our drinks and not knowing who ordered what, and putting the drink in front of the wrong person (which isn't fun when one of them is a full martini!). Just seems so unnecessary. The entire service from sitting down was just lacking and extremely unpersonal, I don't know what else to say.The food on the other hand was amazing, which is why it pains me to give 3 stars.

I ordered through Door Dash for delivery. When my order got here, the delivery guy gave us our order and left. When we opened up our bags, we realized that we only had half our items, and then items that were clearly from another order. Basically, he had given us someone else's bag and took one of our bags to another customer.I called the restaurant to see what could be done. They clearly didn't know what to do in this situation, and said they'd give me a call back. The only solution they gave me when they called back was that they could call the Door Dash delivery guy and have him return to both our addresses and switch back the bags to their correct people. So, give us an order of food that had already been delivered to another person. I told them that I wasn't comfortable taking food that was given to someone else, even if they said they hadn't opened it - how am I to know what's happened to it by now?The employee I was speaking to on the phone said that since the error was on the Door Dash delivery person, and not on them, that they couldn't do anything else unless Door Dash refunded them for the food. Now, I totally and completely understand that the mistake was not through the restaurant, it was the Dasher. But if you work with one of these delivery companies, I don't think you can just pass it off and say it's all out of your hands.

It used to be an old car shop, so its not the most attractive building, but what they did with the inside is fantastic.

A group of seven of us headed over around 10:30. The door man politely welcomed us and indicated that there weren't any tables but we were free to stand inside and grab a drink from the bar. I asked the bartender for a menu but was told that we were only allowed to order drinks from waiters. Another waitress rudely remarked that our group was in the way and snipped at us every time she walked by. The staff clearly didn't care to attempt to find a solution for us.I understand that the drinks take time to make and that Weather Up is new but the rudeness and blas√© attitudes were inexcusable. If they can't service additional customers they'd be better off turning people away at the door than copping attitudes. Perhaps they should setup a reservation system like Midnight Cowboy.

So far I've had the sausage & sourkraught, the rawviolies, the bbq jackfruit sandwich, and a pizza. My main gripe is that all the food tastes processed, even the raw food options. The pizza was oily and bland,  The sausage and sourkraught tasted very highly processed and super fake- not fresh or delicious at all. The rawviolies were very bland-their only saving grace being that the pesto on them had a very nice flavor,  but unfortunately there wasn't enough of it to drown out the blandness. My friends had the\\"cheese\\" platter the time they came with me, and they said it was the worst vegan cheese they'd ever had. I thought that was a bit harsh,  but... they were right in that the \\"cheeses\\" tasted highly preceded and not at all like cheese. I've made better vegan cheese substitutes at home. Even their desserts leave room for improvement. I've had the doughnut balls and the bananas foster and neither were worth writing home about. I do however like their Pac man salad,  The dressing on it is very good. Sorry to give such a harsh review to one of the few vegan options in austin,  but I just can't recommend eating here.

Unfortunately, the price seems a bit high for what you're getting, but I guess that's another result of getting healthy, quality ingredients. -- The service --\\nThis place takes the \\"fast\\" out of \\"fast food\\". Granted everything is made to order, so its not a McDs where they just grab a big mac and throw it in a bag. But somehow the assembly line they have going here just slows things down. Everything seems way too complicated and time consuming. On the plus side, I have not yet received an incorrect order but when I'm stopping in for lunch, I want to make it quick. -- The decor --\\nNot good. The place overall is cold. The menu boards are arranged that you can't see the descriptions of the sandwiches until its time to order. And the tables are arranged that if there's a line you'll be hovered over. And forget trying to get seating for more than 4 together (2 is your best bet). Given the space and the layout, I suppose they're doing the best they can, but its just not good.

I decided to try Kiku since my husband loves sashimi and he wanted me to surprise him with something for dinner.  I arrived and put in my order at 6:49 pm (per my receipt). The order included two pieces of sashimi, a shrimp tempura roll, an order of vegetable tempura, edamame, and chicken teriyaki. I ordered from a seat at the bar--was not offered a drink while I waited or spoken to at all for that matter. The staff was stoic at best. After sitting there for thirty minutes with not a word from anyone (with the restaurant only about a third full), I awkwardly hunted down one of the meandering waiters and asked for an update on my order.  He said it would be ready soon, that they were waiting on the teriyaki.Now, I'm not an impatient person. However, I do expect common courtesy and a wait time far shorter than FORTY-TWO minutes for a simple takeout order.  I guess I should've just sat down at a table and eaten there--I could've finished my food and brought my hubby's sushi to go, with the bonus of getting the sushi at the dine-in price of half off.The positives: the salad dressing was really good (salad came with the teriyaki meal). The pickled ginger was tasty.  I had a tv to watch, although it was 40+ minutes of a softball tournament I could care less about.My shrimp tempura roll was fishy. Haven't had the sashimi yet since my husband had already eaten because it took so long to get back.This is a case of customer service overriding any redeeming features of the food.

Ever since then, I've been dying to try the food.  Now that I have, I can say without exaggeration that it was probably my best dining experience in Columbus.We had a collection of small plates, which is an excellent setup because you get to try a variety of dishes and because the first bite or two of any dish always tastes the best.  We started with three appetizers, the hushpuppies and bacon ramp aioli, the shishitos plus parmesan and \\"everything,\\" and the mushrooms with ricotta on toast.  The shishitos were my favorite.  Blistered peppers, some spicy and some not, smothered in a melty parmesan/cream cheese mix and topped with what was described as \\"everything bagel\\" toppings, so salt, seeds, and onion.  Delicious!  The spiciness of the peppers, the creaminess of the cheese, and the saltiness of the topping were perfect together.  The mushrooms were nearly as good, with tiny, juicy mushrooms and greens on cheesy toast.  I also enjoyed the hushpuppies.  They were dense and had a pleasant corn sweetness to them.  I didn't get a ton of flavor from the aioli, but it wasn't really necessary to be enjoyable.Moving onto the main course small plates, we had the gnocchi and crab, the confit buffalo chicken wings, the bacon risotto, and the shoulder filet.  The filet was tender slices of rare (maybe just into medium rare) meat covered in a curry sauce and topped with two types of farro, one more the traditional boiled farro and one that was toasted to give it a nice crunch.  The wings were incredible.  The sauce reminded you of the buffalo sauce at a sports bar, but everything else was so different.  The meat was fall-off-the-bone tender and juicy.  The blue cheese dip was more like a mousse.  It was all topped with delicate slivers of celery.  They seemed so familiar, but also so much nicer and more refined, than your average wing joint.  The bacon risotto was cooked with bacon stock for a nice salty flavor and also with white cheddar and maple syrup, giving the dish a sweet and spicy combo.  It was topped with a runny sous vide egg that mixed in so nicely.  Wonderful.  The gnocchi was my least favorite dish of the night and it was still very good.  Very sweet and rich.  At the end, it felt like just the right amount of food.  I had tried and enjoyed a number of things and felt satisfied, but not stuffed.The drinks were fantastic, but I've covered them in a previous review, so I won't go in-depth.The service really stood out too.  Our server, Alex, was one of the best I've had.  She really seemed passionate about the food and drinks.  Veritas is fancier than my average meal, and it would be easy for that to be somewhat intimidating, but she guided us through everything in such a casual, friendly way, encouraging us to try different dishes and drinks and answering all our questions with a ton of detail.  The food and drinks were enjoyable enough on their own, but fantastic service really added to the experience.It's probably unsurprising that Veritas isn't cheap.  I spent $250 on the two of us (granted, we had several drinks over the course of the long meal and that adds up).  I'm not complaining -- the experience was fantastic and was worth every penny -- but be prepared.  This will be more of a special occasion spot for us than a regular dining spot, but that's okay, because it gives us something to look forward to."},{"name":"Logan's Roadhouse","address":"8207 W Irlo Bronson Memorial Hwy","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"3","text":"Horrible service, disgusting food !

Everything I tried was interesting, perfectly prepared, delicious, and sometimes downright surprising. I tried mac 'n' cheese, hanger steak, pork belly, a mushroom pasta dish, and cheesecake. All were simply fantastic. Fantastic. I cannot tell you how much I enjoyed the food here. If it weren't for how just wonderful the food is, I would never ever come here again no question. Why? Read on, dear friend.VERY BAD\\nFrom the minute we arrived, the service side of things was some of the worst I have experienced at a restaurant, especially one as casual as Dish Dive. The older guy with long grey hair (one of the owners I believe) is just surly and impatient, completely unwelcoming and unpleasant. We asked if we could wait for a table because we had no reservation and you would have thought he asked if we could eat for free and have him give us back rubs while we ate. He stormed off with some comment about \\"maybe we can do something.\\" And never came back. The sweet, harried waitress outside sat us. Later when he was running our checks he was the same grouch he was at the beginning of the night.The thing that is so baffling is that the place was full--a successful night! You're winning, buddy, be happy about it. Good god. Our waitress seemed like a really sweet person, but it was clear that she was in the weeds and was completely freaking out. She was shaking, her voice was wobbly, she dropped things. I waited tables for years. I know in the weeds when I see it. She apologized over and over to us from the minute we sat down. She apologized throughout the whole meal. When we left she apologized again and said we'd made her night. What? We never complained about a single thing. In fact, we had a great time and loved the food and told her so over and over. It was really distracting and we all felt really bad for her.But the thing is, it is incomprehensible that you could be in the weeds working at Dish Dive. Why? Because there are no drinks to serve (it's BYOB). There is a one page menu that doesn't change much. The food comes out when it's ready--no guarantee of a particular order. And the place only holds what 30 people half of whom are sharing tables in a parking lot!!?? It does not make sense. But I thought about it. It does make sense that our sweet waitress was so stressed out. I'll bet anything the owner guy was making her life miserable. CONCLUSION\\nConsidering there are so many other good places to eat nearby, there's really no reason I should go back to a place where I have to bring my own drinks and get bad service. But the food was so good I might brave it again so I can try more things. I love good food too much.

Having a background in hospitality I would worry if I was the CEO of this company. Lazy for a lot of them. I stood in front of 2 useless individuals at the host stand while they organized themselves or discussed their problems whatever it was, either way they never looked up. My waiter came from the restaurant to see if we had been helped. I had a reservation but I was early so opted for a much anticipated cocktail. The bar was full my husband stood behind me while I had the drink and they cleared a table for us.The food was great, a little overpriced for what we got. I didn't realize until I got home that our oysters had been charged incorrectly and higher not lower. My main course was SeaBass and was on special that day, however I was charged $48 for that. My wine, a middle of the road Merlot was $18 a glass. The cheesecake was a big disappointment. Our total for one cocktail, One appetizer, two entrees, one dessert and 2 glasses of wine was $197.00. The manager did go from table to table at one point and ask if everything was ok but was distracted and not focused and you could have told him the roof was on fire for all the attention he was paying to the answers. Bathrooms, ok we had a late sitting, no reason not to keep them 100% clean. I realize they have opted for no hand towels but Im one of the people who have fed into the electric hand dryers even a dyson spreads germs and the advise not to use them so I get the creeps when I see them. In this case there are no hand towels at all in the mens or ladies restrooms so you are SOL. Underwhelmed at the staff except our waiter, the food was tasty and the oyster's while very small were superb quality. The place emptied quickly and we had a late booking so even before closing they were empty or I would have had a coffee.

When you first walk through the doors of Shigezo, you are impressed with the unique Japanese themed interior. A beautiful mural frames its sushi bar, lanterns give the place a warm ambiance, and izakaya style dining makes the experience fun and exciting. The staff is friendly and helpful which also makes the experience that much more enjoyable. When you look at the menu and its prices, you get the feeling that you're getting some quality food because of the price and the overall feeling of the restaurant. This is where Shigezo became anticlimactic for me. I heard that the ramen was good, so for some reason I decided to try something other than the ramen to see what else was good at Shigezo. We ended up ordering the Omusoba and Menchi Katsu. The Omusoba was pretty good but nothing spectacular. It was a good sized portion and it was flavorful. Bottom line, I enjoyed the Omusoba. The Menchi Katsu on the other hand was very disappointing. Not to say that it was bad, but it just didn't seem worth it. The beef in the Katsu tasted like I was eating a deep fried hamburger patty because that's essentially what it was. On the menu it clearly states that it's a beef patty, but I did not think it would taste like a regular old hamburger. You really have to make an effort to dress it up with the wasabi and sauce they give you. At the end of the meal, I did feel satisfied and the experience was great. I was just a little disappointed that the food wasn't \\"amazing\\" to me for what they seemed to be offering.

I was instantly attracted to the quaint house, large southern-style porch with rocking chairs and beautiful outdoor patio. The inside is lovely as well, but quite cramped around dinner time on a Friday. The wait was an hour and a half, but my boyfriend and I did not fret; they have a great selection of cocktails, beer and wine. My boyfriend ordered the Ruby Slipper Martini (in the most manly way possible, of course) and I enjoyed a few glasses of reasonably priced wine ($7-$9). Both were fantastic. When we were seated (after only waiting about 30 minutes...score!), there was a welcoming tin bucket of fresh popcorn awaiting us. I have never been to a restaurant that had complimentary table popcorn and now it is almost a requirement. So genius! And great tasting too. We started with the Roasted Garlic Bulb appetizer. I could have died happy right then and there. This is one of the best appetizers, nay dishes, I've ever had. Two giant bulbs of  soft, warm roasted garlic just waiting to be rubbed over the crisp balsamic-glazed crostini and paired with goat cheese and roasted red peppers. This could definitely feed 2 people alone to the point of fullness and only $8.95. But we had to try more. I ordered the Buffalo Meatloaf with a side of red beans and rice and my boyfriend tried the Molasses and Chile cured Pork Chop with the baked mac & cheese. I have to admit that the reason I give Moonshine a 4 instead of a 5 is because of a few entree flaws. First, the meatloaf was absolutely delicious, but was topped with a less than extraordinary bbq-flavored sauce. It's advertised as a mushroom gravy, but that definitely did not come across. Also the red beans and rice was really lacking those quintessential Cajun spices. My boyfriend's pork chop also did not meet the menu standards. The \\"chile curing\\" could not be found anywhere and the apple bourbon sauce was more like 3 whole apple slices in a sticky sweet sauce. The mac & cheese was pretty good, but definitely not to the level everyone describes it as. Both entrees also came with forgettable steamed carrots and broccoli. Don't get me wrong; I AM going back here. My food was delicious overall and I probably would not be so meticulous if it wasn't a pricey joint. Too full to try the desserts, but they looked phenomenal."},{"name":"The Daily Catch","address":"323 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Overrated. Tourist Trap!

The place is overpriced, tiny space and food is below average. Tourist trap go elsewhere. I wish I could give it 2.5 stars (3 might be too many).

We were excited to eat sushi and crab legs again because we just had a baby.   We ended up being very  disappointed by the food and the service.  The crab legs were incredibly salty ( have no idea why they would be hut couldn't stand to eat more than one)we brought this up to our server who said that he would ask them to change it for the next batch, which didn't happen. The quality of the sushi and rice was also much lower than I remember. You have to wait in line for hibachi as well which is fine but my girlfriend went to get a plate and they  gave her a small chewy piece of steak that was cut into pieces the size of dog food, zucchini still tasted raw and the scallops had obviously been frozen a few times before. We ended up eating mostly the cheap cooked food which I guess is the goal for a place like this.  When i went to pay I handed our server a 100 dollar bill and he promptly took it to the manager who looked at me from around the corner and decided to run from the front to the back a few times so that he could find a pen to check if the money was real before giving it back to him.  I asked to speak to the manageer and I told him about the food and asked for a cup of water for my girlfriend who was in the car which he wouldn't give to me. \\nHis response was that they  never oversalted any food (basically that it wasn't possible for the restaurant to have served it) and crab legs come from the ocean so they try to wash off as much salt as possible, also said that he never ate them. I told him  that we expected the quality of everything to be better, like  what we were used to in the past ,his response was that it sounded like I hadn't been in a long time, also denied that anyone had ever commented about anything I had mentioned , and told me I was projecting when I asked him not to be  condescending towards me.

We had made a reservation about 10 days in advance for 5:30pm (since that's what was available). We arrived and were promptly seated.Since for two of us it was our first visit, we had a lot of questions about cocktails and wine. Our waitress honestly wasn't able to answer the questions (for example, 'do you have Belvedere?' led her on a speech about gin - not vodka). To be fair it seemed like she was trying and she was nice, but the vibe just wasn't there. Luckily another server was nearby and I think he may have overheard the conversation, so he stepped in and served us for most of the remainder of the evening. He was fun and friendly and able to give us very solid cocktail and wine recommendations. He even gave us each a taste of one of cocktails he recommended after we chose not to order it, because he wanted us to try it that bad. That was a nice touch.  Unfortunately I can't remember his name...possibly Matt....but maybe not lolWe shared a dozen oysters of 4 different types that the girl recommended and we loved them all. They were shucked perfectly. We then had the no shell mussels, prepared with lemongrass, fresno and chorizo and they were dynamite! I've never had no shell mussels but they were absolutely incredible. I loved that they were paired with what seemed to be a pearled pasta. It was awesome. We also had the salt cod croquettes, which weren't quite as memorable but still delicious.For entrees, I had the lobster roe noodles which was one of the best pasta dishes I've ever had. I don't like roe, but luckily it was completely incorporated into the noodles so you couldn't really tell it was there. One sister had the bouillabaisse which she said was good, though she wasn't raving about it. I think the flavors were very subtle, but it was well executed. My other sister had a special which was a fish that I can't recall and she wasn't blown away.We finished with the banoffee pie which was quickly gobbled up. We were disappointed they don't have an espresso machine, but were able to settle on coffee.TL;DR - come to ICOB, order oysters and cocktails, get the no shell mussels, lobster roe noodles...banoffee pie and coffee if you have room."},{"name":"The Ivy","address":"3717 Roswell Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Unfortunately service here was terrible.

The Pok Pok Chicken wings were very heavy and strong. The flavors are there but they just need to be balanced out more instead because the fish sauce and the caramel sauce mixed together was just so strong. It's not something you can continuously eat and you just feel very heavy afterwards. If you were to come here and order it I would advise to share it with two other people and it would help a lot. I would advice using less of the fish sauce and less of the caramel because it was too salty and a little too much on the sweet side. If anything add some acid to it or that jalapeno lime fish sauce to compliment the wing so its lighter and your mouth isn't drenched in heavy sticky sauce. The spice was nice though. Also ordered the clay pot noodles and honestly there wasn't really any flavor in this pot. I had to add additional ingredients to make the noodles taste good. The prawns were steamed and the pork belly didn't really do anything for the dish itself. If its suppose to be a clean tasting dish I understand but the server described the dish that the pork belly and prawns are to give additional flavor to the noodles. There wasn't anything in terms of taste or fragrance. Sad to say I was pretty disappointed.

This review is presented as friendly advice and not as a critique. Bottom line: the staff is friendly and welcoming, very good at explaining the menu and choices. The burger size is appreciatively large, but on my latest visit it was over-cooked, over-salted, and not of the highest quality (perhaps the distributor did not provide the best meat; there were pieces of gristle and the burger was tough/hard). The fries were tasty but over-salted. Given the large size of the burger, I expected a generous order of fries. The order looked so small, I decided to count: 14 fries; not a generous portion for nearly $4. \\nThere is great potential here. I hope the owner will strive to reach it.

While the restaurant isn't open for sit down lunch on weekends yet, it was easy enough to order at the counter & sit at one of the tables in the market. We still had great service. I had the Cantabrigian and my husband had a reuben/pastrami special. They were both great; the fresh bread made it especially good! Dinner was also great. We tried the short rib (melt in your mouth) and the sirloin. The sides were all nicely done (had never heard of sunchokes - yum!) and enough to share (and fill our initially sparse plate!). Couldn't decide between all of the 'make your own sundae' options so will have to go back - but the peanut butter and jelly ice cream topped with house-made fluff was all I could ever want it to be!

I'm not a pancake or waffle person, because I don't understand carbs and sweets for breakfast, but I was encouraged by the savory items on the menu. After a brief wait, we were seated and each ordered a different scramble (why, you might ask, did we go to a pancake house filled with children to order egg dishes?  I don't know either. I'm pretty sure the question has more to do with the above-mentioned friendship than it has to do with the restaurant). The scrambles were each tasty and filling, but nothing I'd bump a favorite brunch spot out of line for. It would be nice if they offered jam with the toast, but that would cut into their menu \\"extras\\" which are $2 each and up. I gotta hand it to them for the profitability of their business model:  $1 per ounce for pancake batter that you griddle yourself, plus all the extras the kiddies want.

It really helps that you can order a just about anything on the menu vegan or vegetarian. I love the Angry Hippy quesadilla and the Happy Hippy Burrito with the chick pea chili. Their black bean soup is practically fat free, I get it with a scoop of guacamole instead of sour cream. Sure it's not authentic Mexican, but in a town overrun with Mexican restaurants it's nice to eat some familiar food with a Cali twist that's just a little different. The one constant with all the restaurants in the Mad Mex chain in their many selections of craft beer, and this one is no different. When I looked at the Mad Mex app (yes they have an app with up to the minute draft selections) I saw the Buckeye Hippie IPA and had to try it. It went perfect with my meal.

Three pages that cover the standards: small soups, bibimbab, meats, hot pots, noodles and pancakes.- Banchan - we were given four dishes. Kimchi, fermented/pickled radish, bean sprouts and soy glazed potatoes (gamja jorim). The bean sprouts and glazed potatoes were delicious (we got seconds). The fermented/pickled radish was interesting as they were whole and had a sweetness to them.\\n- Gam ja tang (#27) ($26.95) - traditional spicy pork bone soup with vegetables and potatoes. Comes with two bowls of rice. There was four chunks of pork bone, onions, cabbage, jalapenos, Korean red chili peppers (beware, these are hot) and green onions. This could easily feed 3 people but since there were only two of us, we had plenty of leftovers. We asked for it to be spicy; completely tolerable. The broth was flavourful, had depth and seriously, this is the cheapest I've seen gam ja tang! Perfect for a dreary rainy Vancouver night.Authentic, affordable, tasty Korean food.

My father brought me to Nori Nori a few years back. He's a very picky eater - he expects the food to be excellent at best and decent at least. He's also retired so he's very frugal as well. Usually a good meal and a good deal don't go hand in hand. In this case, it does. We drop in every time I come to town.I've never been here for lunch, just dinner which after reading the reviews here it seems to have more variety and they fire up the crepe station. I like that the place attracts all sort of people in a diverse age range. It's spacious enough that families with younger kids can come here and have some room for their wiggly toddlers.I love the variety of sushi here, not what you'd see at a typical sushi buffet in Los Angeles. In fact, Todai (an LA sushi buffet) was such a horrible experience for me it completely turned me off from the idea of a sushi buffet -- until I came to Atlanta and experienced Nori Nori. The salad bar has so many tasty items to choose from!  Try the seaweed salad and the one with the grilled eggplant - 2 of my faves. The seafood looks good, but I am usually much too full of sushi to do more than a crab leg.

Maybe its true or not but I noticed that they add less rice in the nigiri now. \\nThe hot foods needs work mr chef and owner!  For 30$ something dollars per person its very basic and same throughout the year!  A change never hurts!Lastly, on the food if you advertise crabs and oysters as part of your dinner buffet then do so accordingly. The lady( not sure if she's the owner) handing out crabs is ridiculous. Put a sign or something to take certain amount per grab or something I don't like that she's handling out food and not wearing any sort of gloves. \\nTo get crabs this is the idea: you get up walk over and go over to the crab area. Don't worry about forgetting your plate as there is a korean lady behind the buffet stand ready to serve your restricted crabs and after you receive the plate she tells you to come back for more. And this is from a $30+ per person buffet seems ridiculous to me. A buffet 2 highway exits down cost less and you don't see anybody handing out food to monitor or restrict you. Please re think this.

We got there on a Thursday afternoon around 2pm, no one inside. Greeted quickly and sat down. Very small inside the restaurant and I was glad it wasn't crowded. First, we were shocked to see that chips and salsa were not complimentary. We got them anyways, bc I'm literally addicted to crunchy things and salsa and I was so excited because when you pay for what's normally complimentary, it's usually amazing and worth it.  No. Boo. I was SO disappointed. No color, no flavor, no chucks of love, nothing. No flavor. How does salsa have no flavor? :(  I could have made at home with can of diced tomatoes and onions on top. So SAD. I got some tacos, the boyfriend got the guac carne asada burrito. The thing is HUGE. The burrito, people, the burrito. ;)  Yeah. He loved it. Guac was a little bland for my taste, but he's just starting to get into avocado's so it was perfect for him. The meat was delicious and very tender. No gristle bits. He only finished half and we took the rest home. The leftover factor was a little less than expected. Meat became super tough once cooled. Not a lot of added flavor. However, we ate it. It was good. Would order again. My tacos were good. I had the pastor, beef, and chicken. They were delish. They reeeeeaally were so damn delicious. But. They were SO EXPENSIVE. The food is SO EXPENSIVE. I mean, $15 for 2 enchilada plate?!  My beef taco was good, but not THAT good. The pastor was wonderful, but had a very tart'y aftertaste. No gamey flavor like I've experienced with some other El Pastor, and I would probably order it again. But jeez I'm not use to paying over $1.50 for a street taco... I was charged almost $5 for ONE street taco. I've never checked lunch pricing before, because lunch, but I will from now on. We went for a quick lunch, I was trying to surprise my boyfriend with this popular yelp spot, while staying on a strict budget, but man,  1 beer. 1 tea. 1 Chips and Salsa. 3 small street tacos. 1 big burrito and spent over $43 !!!!! I had NO idea it would be that much, and honestly, the service wasn't anything to warrant it either. He sat us, brought our drinks, chips, then food. That's it. He NEVER refilled our drinks and I had to ask for more water. Guy had to ask for a beer.  He didn't check in on us,  he shouted from across the restaurant, \\"It's good, yes?\\" and it echoed in the empty room. We nodded a bit confused. So yeah. My lunch budget was busted, my thirst still heavy, and I left 17% instead of our usual 25%, and this guy huffed and puffed after seeing it, which I heard from across the room (place really echos)  and when I smiled and thanked him, and said, 'see ya soon' as we left he literally rolled his eyes, scoffed, turned his back to us, and said nothing. Not a word. That solidified for me, I will not return. A shitty attitude for a $50 lunch...

The roll was potato based, fluffy, crispy exterior, and slightly butter toasted. \\n2. Lobster roe noodles half portion was just enough without paying a hefty $38 full. A nice mix of scallops, lobster, short braised rib, and grilled mushroom to diversify the flavors, however perhaps a bit too heavy and tiresome for a full portion. \\n3. Scallop dish was excellent. They were cooked to perfection and very sweet. I'm a new scallop fan.\\n4. Fish and chips had too many chips. The cod pieces were fresh and chunky though. This was probably my least favorite. Instead of tartar sauce, they provided a house aioli. Prefer tartar though, but perhaps that is my plebeian tongue speaking.\\n5. I also ordered the clam chowder, sweet biscuit, and oyster sliders.

We were a quite surprised that the wait would be so long but decided that we would just get the food to-go since many of our friends hyped it up so much. We ordered a couple orders of the fried chicken (spicy and non spicy), the papaya salad (they were out of the special seafood version), and the baby back ribs. I know I should've checked when we got our food, but there was no place to really sit, so we grabbed the food and went our way. Once we were sat down to eat the food, we realized they got one of our order wrong. There was no baby back ribs, and we got some noodle/pork/shrimp dish. At this point, I would still give it 4 stars if the food was amazing. However, the chicken was SO salty and all I can taste was fish sauce. For how much you pay (and wait), I also hope they can cut the chicken wing so it's not just one giant wing along with the wing tip, which - let's be honest - people normally just discard since it's so hard to eat. The wings also still got chicken hair on it. We tried the clear noodle/pork/shrimp dish that they gave us by mistake, there was two sad pieces of pork belly, and 4 shrimps that all still have shells on. Normally I would let that pass, but by at this point, after the disappointing chicken, the small portion of papaya salad, I was just over it.

I started with a side salad (which was huge and covered with fresh toppings). I could easily order the side salad for the croutons alone - they're made fresh on site from a variety of day old breads. The bread is actually from another local favorite (Sunrise Bakery). I could pick out whole wheat croutons, marble rye croutons, and regular white. I'm not usually a fan of croutons, but theses, I can get behind.I'm always tempted by the soup, but my hands down favorite item on the menu is the turkey firecracker sandwich It's a spicy turkey sandwich with jalapenos, fresh tomato slices, and hot sauce served on black bean bread with your choice of a side. I requested the fresh fruit and was impressed with the whole pieces of fresh fruit (grapes, pineapple, orange slices) instead of the typical boring melon.

He suggested the bacon pimiento puffs which were simple, but unique and delicious.For our entree, we debated getting the Porterhouse for two, but in the end decided to each get our own steak...he went with the 12 ounce filet and I with the 6 ounce, both with the black truffle butter on the side.  Both steaks were cooked to perfection and tasted amazing.  The black truffle butter was heaven!  We've had many steaks from many different steakhouses, and we both agreed this was one of the best steaks, if not the best, we've ever had.For our sides, we decided to go with the jalapeno cream corn (also highly recommended by our server), and the scalloped sweet potatoes.  They were both phenomenol and went perfectly with our steaks.  The cream corn had just enough kick without being overwhelming.  The scalloped sweet potatoes were very cheesy.  We are big fans of cheese, so this was perfect for us, but if you don't love cheese, I might suggest trying something different.For dessert, we tried the chocolate peanut butter bar.  It was rich and decadent, but very good.  We barely had room to finish it, but somehow managed.This was by far one of the best meals we've ever had, and we talked about it for days after.  The restaurant was very busy, but not too loud, and the the lighting was quite dim, but we didn't mind at all (it made it romantic).   If you're ever visiting Atlanta, you have to go here!

And both times I was extremely frustrated with the lack of service (if any) she provided.  This past weekend, we went in to grab a bunch of appetizers and a dozen oysters before heading off to a party.  On top of taking forever to take our drink order, she was less than amused that we were only ordering apps and oysters.  Now mind you, we still had a $100 bill before tip and I found it quite rude that she stated \\"oh, only snacking tonight and no entrees?\\"  After taking our order, she not once checked on us during our entire meal to ask how the food was or if we needed anything.  We had to wave her down a few times to get things we were missing.  Second, terrible service aside, the food here is actually really really good.  The oysters were incredibly fresh and delicious (I was a huge fan of their Island Creek oysters) and I especially enjoyed the fried oyster sliders.  We actually ordered another round we were such fans.  The shrimp were huge, fresh, meaty and awesome- they paired nicely with their cocktail sauce.  I also loved all the condiments they provided so you could spice up and chose the flavors to your own personal liking.  \\n \\nAlthough our waitress was a huge distraction and took away from our overall dining experience, the restaurant itself was very nice, the food was on point and the other servers who assisted throughout the meal made up for our waitress's lack of service.  I will definitely be back here in the future to try some new things and just hope for better service."},{"name":"The Daily Catch","address":"323 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Granny waitress is super rude she takes all of my appetite away.

After drinking all day at Harpoonfest, we were utterly famished. So we might have gone a little overboard with the food, ordering all of the oysters, shrimp cocktails and entrees available.... As for the food, all I can say is - THOSE CRISPY OYSTER SLIDERS. Oh my goodness they were amazingggg. The perfect balance of juicy to crispy, and the sauce was so perfectly paired too. Honestly my favorite item of the meal. My boyfriend and I also split the Lobster Roe Noodles and the Bluefish entrees. The noodles, which I also had last time, are reliably tasty and luxurious, with giant chunks of lobster and steak in it. The fish was also delicious and very soft and juicy. Overall, a very tasty meal, but the only thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is that unfortunate price tag that was slapped on at the end of our delicious time there. I ended up paying a pretty penny for the meal - $83, to be exact. Not sure if it was worth that sum of money.

I bookmarked this place, and left it waiting for a while. We decided to take a small road trip - and remembered that I had this place book marked. We arrived for Dinner at about 6pm, there was already a line, and it was extremely slow moving. We still decided to wait, and couldn't be so close, yet so far from something I've wanted for so long. After about an hour wait, we were shuffled into a small, cramped, old school Italian restaurant, and didn't even need a menu, we knew what we were going to get. (including the $89 price tag that's included) although we wrestled with getting the squid ink pasta as well.We order the Fra Diavolo, which comes served in a saut√© pan, with Squid, Shrimp, Crab, Lobster, Clams and Mussels. It is a truly a wonder to behold. The sauce was amazing, and I will say, it's a bit messy, and ended up ruining my shirt I was wearing, but what is a shirt when it's compared to amazing food anyways? ;-) I loved the food, I loved the service, and it was absolutely heaven.

This was a 5 star tapas experience. First of all, the setting is unique. The wood ceiling and paneling coupled with  antique light fixtures makes you feel like you fell into a Spanished style Wild West saloon. Cool factor is high. The Tuesday Tapas deals are on point. They have both hot and cold tapas ranging from about $4 to $9. Sangria (red, white, and cava) is $5. Mojitos are $7. I got the Pisto Monchego which is a pur√©ed eggplant, tomatoes and red peppers. It was served cold and was light but flavorful. I also got the Gambas Bravas: fried shrimp tossed in spicy aioli. I realized it is essentially the Spanish interpretation of Bang Bang shrimp. Served hot it had a great kick. We got the chicken and sausage paella which I personally was not overly impressed with. It was very, very salty. The fresh lemon definitely cut the salt but that doesn't change the fact it was overpowering without it. I've had the seafood one and it wasn't overly salty so maybe it was just a heavy hand in the kitchen tonight. Also, the Albondigas are probably the best deal on the menu. $4.95 gets you four giant pork, veal and chorizo meatballs in sauce. Couple that with the complementary bread and you could easily be full. They brought out chocolate cake since it was my friend's birthday. Oh. My. Lanta. I don't even like cake that much but this was killer. You know the Bill Cosby routine about chocolate cake? (if you don't your life isn't complete yet and you need to YouTube it immediately) I was doing the kids' happy dance on the inside: \\"Ceviche is great! They give us chocolate cake!\\" I would get it again in a heartbeat. With a wide variety of tapas and solid sangria, you are surely going to find something for everyone. The friendly staff (the bartender was a riot tonight! And our waitress was able to split the check 6 ways) makes the experience all the more enjoyable. Parking is only $6 in the garage or they will validate valet. And have I mentioned the chocolate cake? So there really isn't a reason not to go!"},{"name":"The Taste of Yucatan","address":"1375 S Semoran Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"I live in the area and noticed this place while driving by and have been meaning to try it.

There is a TV screen on each table but non-working, so not sure what the purpose is. Menu is pretty simple and we tried kabob sandwiches with Dolma (stuffed grape leaves) as appetizer. Our order already got messed up in the beginning, did not get our Dolma and had to go back and request for them, although the guy behind the counter apologized for it, no problem.Food - 8.99 for my chicken kabob sandwich, which is really a wrap. Very tiny with about 4 little chunks of chicken, and that is all the meat you get, too much sauce makes the wrap messy and drips everywhere. Same thing for the kabob lamb wrap, barely any meat. Average flavor, nothing that stands out.I decided to give this place a try because of these \\"good\\"reviews on Yelp, but now I am suspecting how many are truly legit or mostly written by friends. Not going back."},{"name":"Baraka Cafe","address":"812 Memorial Dr","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"\\"It's weird,\\" Yelper Allix T. mused over a private message a few hours before we were all to meet at Baraka for a Kenny Celebration, \\"I told the restaurant we're going to be 9 but she keeps saying 5.  And I say 9, and she says 5...and so I hope all of us get seated...\\"As I got off the train and met my friend to head over to Baraka, I secretly prayed that the disconnect would magically disappear  and the prior claims of space issues would be resolved and everything would be peaches and cream once we got there.  Or couscous and lamb.  Whatever.   I casually mentioned to my friend that I had heard the space was small and we could be packed pretty tight for the evening.You know, like a cute, fuzzy Yelp slumber party.Speaking of slumber parties, if you've ever been to any, then you know how there always was that one person who attended the slumber party who was either afraid of sleeping in other people's homes, or was just so ridiculous and nuts that they threw tantrums all night over absolutely nothing and the rest of the slumber party-goers just kind of sat there in amazement and then when the irate one left the room (or finally fell asleep, or got picked up by their mom), everyone had a good, hearty, laugh?OK, so my friend and I walk into Baraka and I'm immediately taken by the overall design of the place.  I would venture a guess that the entire restaurant is smaller than Paris Hilton's closet.  But, my word, Paris Hilton has *nothing* on the style in this place.  Purple sequined tablecloths.  Beautiful, beaded oddly-shaped mirrors.   Satin pillows in deep magentas and soft oranges.   And as Yelpers arrive, I barely even notice the tight quarters until a loud shriek comes from a woman who, I come to find out later, was wearing track pants and black Crocs under her hijab.   \\"YOU SAID FIVE PEOPLE AND I SEE MORE THAN FIVE!!!\\"Oh, no she di'int.She seemed to hold a grudge throughout the entirety of our stay there, though intermittently gracing us with moments of absolute sweetness, which only made her not-so-lovely actions seem even worse.   The menu was full of interesting (and what we found out to be very yummy) choices, but any requests for substitutions from the menu were not just frowned upon -- some were outright refused.    Vegetables instead of fried potatoes? No!  The reason: the food tastes better with the fried option.  And she's probably a trillion percent right.  But as a girl who pretty much always has to make some sort of substitution with restaurant food (due to allergies to most dairy, spicy food, and nuts), I have to be certain that I can get things made to order.  Luckily, I ordered couscous with vegetables and didn't need to sub.  But had that not been on the menu, there was not one dish that I wouldn't have had to ask for *something* to be omitted.  And I don't know how I would have been able to take \\"no\\" for an answer.However, the woman's demeanor was so off the charts that it simply became comical.  It was one of those trainwrecks where you just could not look away, no matter how much you wanted to.    Homemade cakes for Kenny and Allix were sitting in boxes on the table and as our server went to clear our dishes off the table, suddenly her mood became almost angelic.   \\"Is that cake?\\" she asked sweetly.   We all nodded our heads in unison and I will admit that for a fleeting moment, I thought she was just going to open up the box and stuff my head in it and cackle.  \\"Do you want a knife to cut it? And plates?\\"  Yes! Yes, we do!  And forks!  She comes back and throws the knife on the table. About twelve forks cling in unison as they, too, are dropped, and then she threw the plates down.   \\"Hurry up.  I need you all to get out  of here.\\" Two minutes later, she gestured at the three Yelpers who weren't able to share the same table as the rest due to space issues.  She points to them, all of two feet away from us, and says sternly, \\"your FRIEND wants cake now.\\"Then, a bill was tossed on the table and I took the bill and swatted at the two or three bugs that kept flying around the entire meal, eating Yelper Orly's nose and my thigh repeatedly.    We paid and ran out of there and took lots of pictures outside of the restaurant, and I think that we all had the same look of bewilderment on our faces.   Funny thing is, the food was awesome.I just don't know if I have the courage to return.  I am so perplexed by the whole situation.  Like the way I was perplexed when I was younger and that weird kid would freak out at slumber parties.

My mom got a mojito, which she loved, but I decided to save my calories for the food.I started with a couple of oysters, an Island Creek and one I can't remember the name of. Having never had oysters before, I really had no idea what to expect, and I don't really feel qualified to review the ones that I had. I might have to have a few more oyster experiences before I can critique the ones I had here. That being said, I really enjoyed the restaurant's namesake oyster with a sprinkle of lemon.For appetizers my mother and I got the clam chowder and pan fried Jonah Crab Cake. The chowder had a lovely smoky flavor, but I would have preferred it to be a little creamier. The crab cake was good, but I don't know how much I would have enjoyed it on it's own. It definitely benefited from a delicious whole grain mustard dressing atop a bed of apple, fennel, and arugula salad.So often in restaurants I find that the appetizers in a restaurant outshine the entrees. I am happy to report that this was not the case at ICOB. I got the lobster roe noodles, while my mother got one of the specials, ravioli topped with lobster and filled with an asparagus and ricotta puree. I LOVED my noodles, which were topped with a confection of grilled lobster, braised short rib, pecorino cheese, and chanterelle mushrooms, and my mom enjoyed her dinner equally. For $29, however, her portion was definitely on the small side.We debated on whether or not we should get dessert (being full was not the issue, the menu just didn't do much for us), and eventually decided to try the blueberry shortcake with sweet corn ice cream and chantilly. The aforementioned shortcake was more like a scone, but I was fine with that. The ice cream was light and mild (I didn't really taste the corn), but there wasn't enough of it. The biscuit was rather large and needed a little more cream to balance it out. There sure were plenty of blueberries though.Dinner definitely peaked with our entrees, but I am happy to say I enjoyed every course we had. And I am just now realizing that I haven't even mentioned the impeccable service. Needless to say, it was impeccable. I very rarely go to (non-Indian or sushi) restaurants more than once, as I like to try new places whenever I have the opportunity, but I might make an exception for ICOB."},{"name":"Chuy's","address":"8123 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"This was my first visit to this location. I have been eating at Chuy's since they first opened in Austin. I have high expectations for them. Chuy's has done a great job maintaining consistency across the chain.Upon arrival 30 minutes to closing we were told there was a 20 minute wait. We were like were here so we will wait. I feel that we were told that so maybe we would leave. That was the impresa everyone in my party had so it wasn't just me. We were seated within minutes of saying we would wait.This location is no different than the others I've been relating to the food. The food was spot on, the service wasn't the greatest but we got fed. I know it was close to closing so i think I'll give them a pass on the mediocre service.

Everywhere I went, I thought: \\"I could live here.\\"  College graduation was a year off, and I was hungry for a new city.But then I met Portland, and by that, I mean Powell's. It did not even seem possible that there could be a bookstore this large, where almost every book I had ever wanted was right there, on the shelf, where I could see it and touch it and read it. And some of these books were even used, so they were cheap! I won't even tell you how many books we bought, but just know that they were quite heavy on top of the books we had already purchased in Toronto and Vancouver.And the people... wow. Somehow, a group of about eight of us ended up chatting for a couple of hours, sitting on the floor of one of the lesser-peopled aisles. They were all Portlanders, and so friendly and bookish and well-travelled and well... me. Everything about them was what I already was and what I wanted to be. I loved them, and I loved Powell's, and that was when I knew I would move here. And so I did in 2000.Since then, my book addiction has only gotten worse, but I will tell you that Powell's helps ensure that your collection is a good-quality one. For one thing, there is no point in owning mediocre books, because Powell's always has the best ones on any given subject. For another thing, Powell's has offered me decent money when I have decided to part with a few tomes. Yay for them. That's pretty rare in my experience. And for another, yes, there is a rare book room, but even better is the fact that vintage books are also scattered through the normal aisles, too.So, Powell's, I hope for many more decades of awesomeness.

They have candles on the tables and people next to us managed to set their bread basket on fire. Not too good. Service was friendly and efficient. We asked for a wine recommendation and were not disappointed.The silverware is just ridiculous. It seems to come out just straight out of a play kitchen and the knives don't cut anything.Now to the food: We had an assortment of dishes picked by one of the chefs. There were excellend dishes like the tuna with horseradish sauce but most of them were slightly disappointing. We had 3 seafood dishes which all came covered with the same balsamic reduction which completely overwhelmed the other flavors.The bill came on an iPad/tablet again and it was a joke, a pricy joke.

Although the location is slightly less convenient on public transit, the parking on weekends is much better here, so how you feel about the new spot depends on your transportation method.Cafe Luna is one of the top brunch spots I've been to in Boston because of the food, whether you are a sweet or savory bruncher. Personally I usually go with the sweet and the array of various waffles, pancakes, and french toasts here (nutella, berries, lemon, plain, etc.) is what gets me going. In particular, my favorite is the house pancake which is lemon ricotta based. Do I like regular ricotta? No. Do I go cuckoo for Cafe Luna lemon ricotta pancakes? Yes. I've also had a few of the omelettes which you absolutely cannot go wrong with. Cafe Luna is a go to location when I have friends visiting the city and we want a quality brunch that I know they will remember and from which they will leave satisfied. However, do go with 4 stars vs. 5 primarily because it can be super hard to get a spot without a reservation and it's a little more expensive than I want to pay for brunch."},{"name":"Piazza Italia","address":"1129 NW Johnson St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"a very family feel. soccer jerseys line the ceiling, soccer games on tv. friendly and handsome wait staff who are oooooozing charm. the food is delicious!!! we all got the pesto pasta with prawns, and the artisan bread is perfectly dense and soaks up the olive oil beautifully. i'd definitely come back for a girls night ;)."},{"name":"Java Monkey","address":"425 Church St","city":"Decatur","stars":"3.5","text":"The hipster in me loves Java Monkey.

Barbecue sauce - 1 star, I believe the server said they gave us a variety of their sauces. All had lots of spices and none tasted like a normal semi- sweet bbq sauce. Didn't find one I liked, all tasted too sharp or too spicy. \\n5. Collard greens - 0 stars, DO NOT ORDER. EXTREMELY bland.. and, SWEET! Not appetizing in the slightest.

We weren't welcomed by the staff who didn't seem to understand the dynamics of service.What I want to greatly emphasize on, is about the approach that: this one individual had towards us. I will be calling him the manager from here on, as he seemed like one and I guess I am right.¬†To find out when our drinks will arrive; I rose my hand to grab his attention. He looked at me, unresponsive and was reluctant to come by. When he did, I expressed my concern about the drinks being late and mentioned that we were a party size of 7 and would much appreciate it if the service could be faster. The tone with which he responded clearly stated that we were being taken for granted.In the next 1.5 hours that we were there, we noticed that this manager walked to every table checking-in with customers. He even took orders politely and addressed questions with humility but never approached us. After the cheque was cleared, he came by to clear the table of the plates but didn't utter a single word. We stood up and left. Our presence, experience and comfort was never accounted for by this obnoxious individual.Now this makes me wonder. Was this manager biased and discriminating? There can be no other explanation for this, can there be ?¬†He was disrespectful, arrogant and didn't value us as customers. He outrightly ignored us.If you think you could become a victim of this, then Mission Sushi isn't a place for you, atleast when this manager is around. Also, the manager probably should revisit school and get lessons on hospitality with a FREE SPIRIT and understand that conditions DO NOT apply. Else he just isn't fit to be a manager in service/hospitality sector.Before I end this, I do want to say that the waitress who serviced us did an exceptional job!However, we are certainly not going to return.

The meal was also in a puddle of grease, the hollandaise sauce didnt exist because it must have broke, and the poached eggs were overcooked.The other meal was the fried chicken with biscuits, and besides being too salty as well and the eggs being overcooked, the chicken was awesome.Wont be headed back too soon, but I will say the cornbread was amazing."},{"name":"That's Italian Too","address":"957 Washington St","city":"East Weymouth","stars":"4","text":"Best Subs hot or cold.this is the place to go for some great food.

The frisee salad was delicious...light and fresh. The dressing is delicious and saving grace for the entire meal. For the entree, I opted for the 10 oz ribeye. Oh my...half my steak was fat and again way too salty. I'm not being dramatic...3 other people who were sitting close to me who also ordered the ribeye agreed their's were also very salty. Thank god the steak was cooked perfectly at medium rare, but what's the point when you take a bite and have to chug down a glass of water to re-hydrate from all that sodium intake. Last, the chocolate bread pudding was a huge disappointment. Save yourself and do not get this.

We wondered about the hype of the food and came with some skepticism. The food did not disappoint! My partner had Ike;s Fish Sauce Wings and Papaya Salad (which he usually makes at home). Both dishes seemed to live up to the hype and he truly enjoyed them both - flavorful and the right amount of spice. I had the Khao Soi which reminds me of a yellow curry I've had in the past. It was super flavorful, rich and decadent. I would suggest removing the crunchy fried noodles on top so they don't get soggy.

I had to stop and take sips of water it was that salty. other than that it was good.\\nmy housemate was trying to enjoy his chicken pho. but he looked up and said to salty and no love ie no vegetables...so I looked at his pho and all I could see was chicken, rice noodles and some onion maybe some cilantro.

According to our server, the bathrooms are quite original, and routinely photographed. While the bathroom decor is unusual, having tires for sinks, gas pumps as handles, etc, it still reminded me of Hard Rock.\\nThe food was decent. Nothing exceptional, unfortunately, and relatively pricey. You're paying more for the kitschy atmosphere. \\nOur table ordered an appetizer of pretzel sticks, which everyone liked. I ordered the Distinguished Gentleman burger, medium, with potato wedges. There was an issue when another member of my party wanted one of the specialty burgers, but with an Impossible Burger substituted instead of beef, which the server stated they couldn't do due to a size discrepancy??? So she just ordered potato wedges. My burger, however, came out with one side well done, and the other rather medium rare, so the server took it back, and advised me he was having the burger remade. Once my new, remade burger was brought out, everyone else at my table was already finished. So I just cut the burger to make sure it was cooked correctly, and when the manager came by to check if the burger was okay, I informed him it was and then asked for a box for my burger.\\nAll in all, I can't say I would ever go back, but it was an okay experience.

A few notes - first order was carryout around 530pm another was 6pm.  Delivery was 130pm.Their model is something that is used more in the more urban areas such as New York.  No delivery charge and no tipping takes out the possibility of a) seeming like you're cheap\\nb) uncertainty of over/under\\nc) the need to have some money (and making the delivery person seem like their job is a pole dancer with all the $1's\\nd) calculating if it's cheaper to order delivery or to pick upThings I liked\\n- level of spiciness\\n- General Tso - on point, good mix of crispiness and sweet sauce\\n*If you've ever tried to make Orange Chicken from Trader Joe's/Costco, etc - the food is usually baked and then the texture gets soggy when you add the sauce.  So unless you got the heat or a good quick deep fryer, just order Tso Chinese Delivery\\n- Orange Peel Beef - they cuts of meat are done well.  Nice bits of microplaned orange peel.  A good bite - not like the chewy stuff you might find at other places.  Nicely glazed in a sweet sauce\\n- Green beans - good amount of breading - think like Contigo\\n- Hot and Sour Soup - this may sound weird, but the best I've ever had.  Good kick. Nice ratio of soup to tofu and other little accompaniments\\n- Egg drop soup - once again - this sounds weird, but solidly like someone made it in your kitchen and not from a package or huge vat of watered down chicken broth and a little egg.  You will find eggs, green peas, and green onions in this one\\n- Egg Noodles - If you're between the lo mein, but what something more meaty like the Sesame Chicken, you can add egg noodles instead of rice for $1.  Let's be honest.  All little kids . . . and kids are heart like this 36 yr old man prefer noodles over rice.  You can't make a Lady and the Tramp move with grains of rice.\\n- Online tracking of cooking and when delivery guy is on the way - much like Pac Man. ** Remember you don't want them cooking something immediately if you're picking up in an hour.   You want to see it go to cooking right before you get there.  *Carry out food was kept in a insulated warm bag.\\n- Portion size is about right for a normal human being, but if you're a savage college student that still has his metabolism, I would order two things\\n- Two Chinese Delivery fortune cookies - personalize with punsThis is not your sketchy Chinese food delivery place with misspelled menu items and questionable specials or things that make you think that something was sitting on the buffet line for awhile and then packed up for you.  When you walk in for carry out, you can see they've got computer screens up tracking things.

Husband and I first ate here on Valentine's Day 2013.  It was very busy naturally.  Food was OK (veggies on main dish were still raw - very undercooked) and we waited for our mains for over an hour.  Our waiter was excellent though and he recommended we try them again on a regular night.  We just moved to Steveston recently, so we'd like to support local businesses.  So we went last night - on a very slow Tuesday night right  at the beginning of dinner service - it was our anniversary and we just wanted a low-key, nice quality meal, nothing fancy.Strikes:  Husband ordered a Dirty Martini, but he got just a regular martini (that's a basic drink and they didn't even get it - at least they could have asked what's in it like other restaurants would and attempt to make it right).  They were already out of a few items that we wanted (Really?!  At start of dinner service?!).  The potato crust on the Ling Cod main was extremely salty.  The poutine was extremely salty - the waitress told us it's because of the cheese (no, really?!).  We know what decent poutine tastes like and theirs didn't even come close.  Both our desserts were missing items and we were told about one missing item mid-way through eating it and had to prod the waitress about the other missing item.  No apologies were given for any of the missing items on our dishes or on the menus that night.  .  Good:  Carpaccio was very good!  My dessert (Callebaut pudding concoction) was delicious.  Great atmosphere.  We really wanted to like this restaurant and gave it the benefit of the doubt after the first time.  But unfortunately we won't be back because for the price we paid, we didn't get close to the value for it.  We are certainly not food snobs, but we've eaten around at many places locally and internationally to know when a restaurant is giving value to what their customers pay.  In the end, we realized that this restaurant must be geared towards tourists, mostly Americans who lean towards a very salty palate and overpriced food.

I created an account just to leave a review so that others can beware of this horrible place!Food: The food is not bad, but not great either. They are known for their abalone and shark fin soup which aren't bad, but their dim sum is not good at all. Their spring rolls are usually deep fried in old oil or over fried thus the really dark pastry. The rice rolls and beef rice rolls are mushy. Their steam radish cake is ok, but then again, you can't really go wrong with that.So why do I hate this place so much? THE SERVICE! The waiters are extremely rude. They tried to avoid eye contact so that they don't have to be the one to serve you. They've dropped plates on us several times, and one time splashing soy sauce all over my grandmother's shirt without as much as a sorry. But WORSE of all is THE CASHIER! My grandparents go to this restaurant due to its proximity convenience. They love abalone and shark fin soup and order it regularly. Each abalone is over $50 bucks! So you can imagine how high our bills get. When I went to the cashier to pay, I always calculate the total beforehand and ask her to just give me a bill in return rather than all the change to save her the trouble, but she just can't do MATH! She insists on punching it in her calculator and giving me a crapload of change, and then bills that are much too large to leave as tips. Then when I ask her to break it she'll roll her eyes. She also has complained a couple of times that it wasn't ENOUGH tips! WHAT THE HELL IS THAT? She didn't even know how to do math because it WAS 10%. This was after a day of horrible service!

I'm glad I didn't... The prawns were amazing; perfectly cooked and seasoned; fresh and bursting with flavour. We both agreed we could've eaten an entree sized portion of these.Hopefully they were a sign of good things to come, I thought.They weren't.Wife's Poached Atlantic Lobster - whole lobster with root vegetables (she removed the beets, which neither of us are fond of) ... was just ok. Strangely, not even as good as The Canadian Brewhouse's \\"Lobster Fest\\". Yes, VFC's was smaller (Brewhouse's are 2lbs, this was probably less than 1.5 lbs) and inadequately buttery. The meat wasnt \\"melt in your mouth\\"; it may have been over rested because it was a tiny bit overcooked and a touch rubbery Average in every sense of the word. Under seasoned, but not terribly so. But considering how amazing the prawn appies were; both the quality of the meat and favour were underwhelming.¬† The garlic roasted potatoes were pretty good, though.My surf and turf: 6oz Alberta striploin w/ scallop and prawn skewer, confit garlic whipped potatoes, roasted acorn squash and beets,¬† celerac puree with red wine jus. On paper this sounded amazing.The surf portion was fantastic: fresh and flavourful prawns and a scallop (I would've liked a bit more sear on the scallop, but flavour was spot on).The steak was also cooked and seasoned well; I'd say the chef did the best job they could with what they had to work with; my steak was also very tough and chewy, with large inedible portions of fat; low grade meat. That's on their purchaser, not the chef.You can see in the pictures how much was left inedible at the end. Needless to say, that's a large chunk of an already small portion. The mashed potatoes were just... there (a huge let down after The Victor's super airy, fluffy and buttery ones). Alas, these needed gravy. Neither of us are fond of beets, but I'd seen them elevated elsewhere. Sadly not here; I bit into one and spat it out; it merely tasted like something burnt.The desserts were both pretty good; in fact, everything except the main course was; alas, that's the star of the show. I felt like we had just watched a film where the trailer previews were entertaining and so were the post credit scenes, but the film itself was boring.Wife ordered a traditional cheesecake with strawberry compote. It was good, with a nice graham cracker crust (a soggy crust would ruin a cheesecake, but this one delivered).I had the Apple Tarte Tartin; with vanilla gelato and caramel sauce. Crust was difficult to cut with a spoon, but this was very good; the tartness of the Granny Smith apples and the sugary sweetness of the caramel offsetting each other, all blended with a nice creamy gelato.The only dine out we have no intention of returning to anytime soon; a shame considering *how* amazing the tempura battered shrimp appies were. But we've tried Dine Out menus that were small, tasting menus, but still really high quality food; and less elevated but still satisfying ones with larger portions. This failed on both fronts. A real shame because it was the quality of ingredients, and not the cook, that was the let down.\\nWe ended up needing to grab a couple of Sausage McMuffins afterward to quell our still growling stomachs.Recommend: Maple Walnut Prawns; prawns and scallops in general; Apple Tarte Tartin dessert, and cheesecake. To be fair, it's called the Fish Company, not the Steak or Lobster company.Avoid: everything else that we tried.3 stars, 6.6/10 mainly for the ridiculously good shrimp.

Because De Dutch is known for pancakes (or rather, \\"pannekoeken\\"), it's not a restaurant that comes to mind when I think \\"gluten free\\".  But surprisingly, De Dutch offers gluten free items, and it was located near the convention center where the expo was taking place, so perfect!Of course there is a lot on the menu that we couldn't eat, but they offer gluten free pannekoeken, and at no extra charge.  (I am bloody fed up with having to pay several dollars more for fucking gluten free items at restaurants.)  The server was really patient with answering our questions about which menu items were gluten free, and she said that the restaurant had ordered extra gluten free pannekoeken for that weekend because of the Gluten Free Expo.  It's nice that they are making an effort to be gluten aware, and as someone with celiac, I really appreciate it.Also, as an avid Yelper, I checked in to De Dutch and got a free orange juice!

The pork belly in the pork absolutely melted in my mouth, and the curry soaked beautifully into the jasmine rice we ordered.

Meat is overtenderized with a questionable tenderizer that depletes the meat's flavor. The salads and veggies are few and small, all treated with lots of vinegar.Coconut rice and sticky rice are overcooked and come semi-cold in tiny portions. Everything is slathered with spice and chili, so it is hard to notice the actual lack of  true flavor.If you chase this food with a few much raved about wiskey-soda-drinking vinegar libations named after a few added drops of the tamarind, papaya and lime that can hardly be detected, plus the chilis' heat will take care of the lack of clean. Whiskey drinks to me taste like mostly a vinegar and a simple syrup mix flavored with whiskey and drops of a juice.The cost of the measly dishes is at most 20% of the price list, the drinks are marked up at least 500%.

The seating has numerous tables as well as large benches for shared seating. My one annoyance was the prices. They were a little on the high side. I spent about $12 for a chicken biscuit and coffee. They advertise many times that everything is handmade in the building, and I'm quite sure it is. I'll say this, the food is downright delicious so maybe they can justify the price. I ordered the Farmer, and it did not hold back on the flavors. Imagine infusing an apple pie w a chicken sandwich. The biscuit is so comically tall that I was forced to disassemble it and eat it w a knife and fork. I'm quite sure you won't find a better biscuit in Orlando. I'll probably return and try the cheaper biscuit/egg combo.

Most importantly they offer a wide variety of work settings to fit any style, including long tables, counters, restaurant style booths in addition to well appointed private meeting rooms in a variety of sizes.  The other members tend to be passionate entrepreneurs, home office workers and small business owners who have no need for traditional brick and mortar offices of their own.  I feel inspired by the energy given off by all the creative types that frequent this establishment.  Roam feeds into the clientele by offering up interesting educational topics on a regular basis (lunch and learns, motivational breakfasts, etc).  They offer secure mail box service where they will receive your business snail mail for an additional fee.Think of this place for your team's meeting instead of the same old hotel conference room.  The equipment is modern and already set up to handle your coaching needs- wall mounted white boards, flat screen TVs ready to connect to your laptop and a variety of refreshments for your group.

The tempura shrimp sushi was top notch as well as the French Toast sundae with vanilla ice cream, fried challah bread, blackberries, strawberries, and whipped cream.

This classic steakhouse boasts a hip, modern interior designed by the Johnson Studio.  There are two \\"high energy\\" seating areas available upstairs, and a quieter, more intimate area downstairs, nicknamed the \\"wine cellar\\".  If you want a more intimate setting where it is easier to communicate, I highly recommend this area.  The restaurant offers beautiful bars both inside and out.  Rounding out the ambiance are several huge paintings of the master himself, the one and only, Kevin Rathbun.  Our server, Andrew, was animated, attentive, and a true pleasure. He was very knowledgeable and quite direct at answering our questions. \\nHis recommendations were all wonderful, and we greatly appreciate his amazing service.  But alas, I wish I was more excited about the food. Other than a stupendous short rib appetizer and the mac and cheese side, the food for me was quite lackluster.  Compared to other high-end Atlanta steakhouses, the steaks and sides came up short on flavor and quality.  I've honestly had much better steaks at several other steakhouses of this ilk.  The disheartening Parmesan fries were served cold, hard, and lifeless.  To our servers credit, he promptly removed them from the bill while bringing us a different complimentary side.  We asked if this is how they are normally prepared and were surprised to be told that they were in fact cooked to specifications. And while the onion rings were tasty and scrumptious, they lacked the crispiness that really makes them pop.  The mashed potatoes and creamed corn were quite solid, but nothing really stood out.

I could make this salad at home for less than $1.00...talk about lack of value. I actually had to eat a second whole lunch when I got back to my office because I was still starving. If you do end up at Commonwealth, stay away from the overpriced salads. The sandwiches are bland too but at least you are getting some substance when you order those. The bar area of Commonwealth looks earthy and hip.

To truly explore the flavors and tour the \\"northern Thailand\\" cuisine more fully. My absolute favorite Thai dish ever is called khao soi (sometimes khao soy or I've even seen it kow soi/soy) and that's a dish typical of that region. So I knew going in that there was potential.Boy-howdy, I wasn't disappointed. Those flavors, though. I mean, you get the classic kaffir lime leaf, lemongrass, galangal, and other things you might expect from Thai food. But the other things, I wasn't expecting.Fish sauce wings, for example. That's their thing. Their trademark, really. So much so that the Portland airport now has a faux food truck run by Pok Pok in a food court that sells the wings. So, you have to order them. They were great, moist, succulent, unique, and a wonderful mess.The khao soi, sadly, was my least favorite of what we ordered, but that's hardly fair to say--it was still amazing. Perhaps a bit too sweet for my tastes, but it was great to have a nice, sweet option on the table to offset the spice and savory flavors elsewhere.Speaking of traditional northern Thai dishes, we got the Chiang Mai sausage (aka sai ua) and I immediately fell in love. So much so, that I've dedicated the last several weeks to making it myself at home. I'm a far cry from Pok Pok's version, but it's intoxicating stuff. I've dedicated way too much time to internet videos of it being sold on the streets of Chiang Mai and the aromatic, but somewhat fatty and light flavors are tremendous. One of the surprise hits and my favorite taste of the night was the smoked eggplant. It was served cool, mixed with boiled egg. You know, like you do. But it works. It totally works and I'm smoking eggplant sometime in the future, because it was and incredibly simple but delightful way to have it.I needed to be rolled out of there, but even so we didn't spend exorbitant amounts of money. Our server was super helpful, not pretentious at all, but he knew his stuff and led us to what we were really looking for.I've heard you can wait a long time for food, or just to get seated, but since it was late on a Sunday night, we walked right in and were seated. I count my lucky stars. Not that it's of consequence, but since Portland is THE WORST place to try to find a cab (sorry Portland, we can still be friends tho), if you're staying downtown try to plan accordingly. We waited for-evah for a cab to respond and bring us back.It's been weeks and I'm still reminiscing. For me, I'll remember the flavors and scents and herbs and spices and interesting combinations that I haven't had elsewhere. Worth the trip and the stop to try it, for sure."},{"name":"Kiku Japanese Steakhouse","address":"3630 Marketplace Blvd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"The sushi is good on some days ..

Everything was fresh, the hot dishes ware amazing. My only negative comment is that they didn't refill the raw stuff fast enough, the oysters were gone in seconds every time they refiled them.

Out of all the restaurants we visited while on our trip here, not only was this our least favorite, this was the only place that put a dent on our wallet.The wait was almost an hour for a table for 2. They get your cell # and you're free to wander off and come back in 10 minutes once you get a text message from them. We were led inside a tiny shack with very dim lighting and tables covered in plastic table cloths that will make you feel like you are somewhere in Northern Thailand. Did I mention how close these tables are to each other that I almost chimed in a few times to the diners' conversation next to us?With a menu that was almost like a novel with a size 3 font, our server spared us from getting a migraine after all the squinting we may have had to do and gave us a jist of his personal favorites. He says about 3 items would be best for us to share and try so we followed suit. In the end, we had about an entire entree unfinished.IKE'S VIETNAMESE FISH SAUCE WINGS ($15.50) - Got this spicy and it did have a kick but other than that, fish sauce was all I could taste - really pungent and sweet. Nothing special.LAAP PLAA DUUK YAANG ISAAN ($17) - Be warned, this was very spicy. It's chopped smoked catfish salad with lemongrass galangal herbs, dried chilies, lime juice, and fish sauce. Best to eat this with sticky rice ($3) with its strong flavors. I wasn't entirely sold on this.KAENG HANG LEH ($15.50) - This was the only thing I enjoyed but still wouldn't be something I would order again if forced to come back here. It's a pork belly and pork shoulder Burmese curry dish that's on the sweeter side with notes of turmeric, tamarind, and ginger. They should make this purely pork belly and get rid of the chewy and dry pork shoulder meat.My SOUTHSIDE ($11) gin and tonic cocktail was refreshingly good. Thank God for that. I have a feeling we could have done better if we actually studied the menu ourselves. It may have taken hours to read it but there was a bowl of fried peanuts on the house to have held our hunger. I was salivating over the KHAO SOI noodle dish from our neighbor while forcing down food I didn't like.

First off, a 3 hour way? Are you kidding me? Never again. We only did it this time around because of all the buzz we've heard and wanted to see if it's worth the hype. Conclusion? I think it's an obvious NOPE. The wings were nothing special, I honestly could get better wings at Buffalo Wild Wings! Don't understand why people have become obsessed with these. The broken crepe was crispy and ok, but much too salty. Sticky rice that was served in a steam basket was really good...almost outshined the wings and crepe, but that's not saying much because it is freaking PLAIN STICKY RICE. What did make this place stand out was the ambience. We sat in a shed that was lighted by Christmas lights. But that seat alone surrounded by the sound of the really hard rain fall made the ambience great. Also, the coconut ice cream sandwich dessert was FANTASTIC.

I made reservations online and noted the special occasion.  When we arrived, the hostess remembered it was a birthday.  It happened to be her 21st the next day so they bonded.  Not really.  He's shy.  We were seated, and our server sprinkled birthday glitter on our table.  A nice touch.A few minor annoyances:  we were told at the start that the bread was in the oven but it would be brought out soon.  It never came.  We could have reminded him, but he seemed busy, and later it was too late for us to fill up on bread.  He forgot my husband's wine and had to be reminded after he brought out the others.  My husband's and mom's baked potatoes were lukewarm.  The majority of the meals were very good.  I had the salmon with brussel sprouts, minus the bacon.  The lobster bisque is wonderful.  The birthday boy got a free dessert - the chocolate lava cake, which he devoured so it must have been good.  My mom stopped eating meat and doesn't love fish, and there were no vegetarian entrees (I know it's a steakhouse, but still).  She made do with a salad and 2 sides.

If you grab two selections of food, it comes out to around $6.52 I believe the price was. You get a more than decent amount of food for a remarkably cheap price. Again, you get what you pay for and the food isn't unique or vastly interesting to the palette.Still I find myself going here often for convenience of the location and economical choice in terms of cost.

Having said that, if I was a vegetarian, my diet would primarily consist of falafels. They're my favorite vegetarian meal. Luckily for me, I'm able to get my falafel fix at Falafel House! Why does this place reign supreme? Here are five reasons:1) It's really filling for the price. $6 will get you a falafel sandwich that'll keep you full for the rest of the day.2) Their falafels are crispy on the outside and moist on the inside. Yum! 3) Their house-made pickled vegetables are a unique twist and add a nice crunch.4) You can add yummy add-ons like an organic egg, feta cheese, and hummus for a $1 more. Though on that note, I ordered my falafel sandwich with hummus today and they put a lot in there. This is normally a good thing, though I think that the hummus overpowered some of the more subtle flavors in the sandwich (e.g. the tahini sauce). I think next time, I'll try getting mines with an egg!5) Their hand cut fries are great (and they're only $2!)

I ordered \\"The Goddess\\" and my parents ordered the hummus salad and \\"The Green Goddess\\" grain bowl. we all ordered large servings. To start off, the portions were skimpy. I literally received a bowl of brown rice with some lentils sprinkled on top (under cooked) and poorly cooked broccoli with tiny bits of plain tofu. There was no flavor at all. The salad was ok as the vegetables were fresh.

He's a celebrity chef yo! A group of meat lovers came here for Mike Y.'s birthday. I really enjoy the restaurant's atmosphere. I like the server's signature yellow shirts. It's unique and a nice change from the usual server attire. I enjoy the row of herbs planted along the walkway to the restaurant. I like details like that. I'd like to know how Kevin Rathbun was able to acquire the vintage scrolls that hangs on the wall across from the bar. It looks cool and is a nice nod to the city of Atlanta. The outdoor space is very inviting and romantic. Because of our large group, we dined downstairs. It was more intimate and not as noisy. Upstairs can be pretty loud. There are also televisions upstairs near the bar. We were given an assortment of bread to enjoy. I really liked the cheeeeeese bread! Let me just say, everything we had was very good. It's even hard to pick favorites of the evening. The vegetable medley ( special of the evening) which included purple turnips made eating veggies easy, breezy, and beautiful! It is a side dish we ordered as an appetizer. The escargot and the pimento cheese puffs were double high five delicious. The jalapeno creamed corned was a unique combination that worked well. The elbow mac and cheese tart deserves an encore. I shared the 22 oz Dry Aged Cowboy w Daniel B. The meat was definitely flavorful. I think the meat absorbed a lot of the flavor, so some parts were kind of salty. Nonetheless, it was a beautiful piece of meat. The New York strip was very good and surprisingly tender. Oh, and get the black truffle butter. DO IT. and pour it generously. I really appreciate it when the servers are conscientious and think 1 step ahead of the diners. The servers at Kevin Rathbun's are great and you can tell they're experienced servers. For instance, we brought a cake for Mike and the servers kept it for us and even cut the cake for us. Not only that , but the server who took care of the cake was conscientious enough to cut reasonable slices for us and left us with some cake.

Being on vacation, we found ourselves in this ghost town strip mall place wondering how many of the architects were stoned while designing this no exit parking lot.   Hungry and desperate, we decided to abandon all hope of escaping this concrete jungle and parked to try some Chinese food... in Florida... where no one apparently shops on Sunday.Browsing through the yelp reviews for this place was entertaining and scary to say the least but we were pretty desperate to eat Chinese food.One of the tips I read was about the roast duck.  I'm sort of picky, no, downright brutal when reviewing roast duck.  I had my doubts but when the crispy golden delight appeared before me, I nearly shed a tear.  Who would have guessed that some of the best roast duck could be had in a place like this.  Seriously, back at home, if you wanted duck of this quality, you'd be waiting an hour or more at 7pm.  Despite having only 2 other tables seated, this place has some real potential.  I think the place is a casualty of a dying mall.The waitress was very attentive and friendly with us.  The food came out quickly and everything was pretty ok.  We had spicy tendon as the appetizer, beef noodle soup, tofu and mushrooms in Brown sauce and the roast duck.I'd give a solid meh for everything but the duck really stole the show.  In case your wondering, meh for me really just means that the food is just your ordinary Americanized Chinese food.  Think a step or two above Panda Express.Back to the duck.  Most places serve roast duck with the skin barely crispy, very fatty, over seasoned, salty, and dry over fried meat.  The duck that was placed before me was succulent, not greasy at all, and seasoned to perfection.  It was so good that my picky non duck eating 5 year old ate 3 pieces no questions asked.Too sum it all up, getting stuck in this god forsaken parking lot, also known as the labyrinth from hell, turned out pretty good.  I left with a happy tummy and everything came out just under 40 bucks including tip.Not a bad deal, and yes, we did finally escape the parking lot.2 stars for good service, 1 star for meh food, 1 extra star for the awesome roast duck."},{"name":"Spinelli's Deli","address":"767 Neil Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"3","text":"Love this place.

I really didn't notice if she had any art or not. Incidentally, Counter Culture is closing this trailer at the end of January and moving to a new brick & mortar home off East 1st, which should open around March, 2012. I've heard of this place before but never knew exactly where it was, and was surprised to learn it's right down the street from Epoch. I must have passed it a hundred times in the middle of the night, but never noticed it until this bright and shiny Saturday morning. There's a limited menu, it's all vegan, and if you just happen to believe God's creatures are meant to be respected and not set on fire to be gnawed upon, then you should be eating here too.I thought of trying both the Jackfruit BBQ and Philly Seitan, but I'll save that for a future visit when I can share it. I wound up doing the Philly Quesadillas with a kale salad. A flat $8 gets you a lot of food here, but more importantly, it gets you a lot of really good food: Did it taste exactly like a genuine \\"Philly wit \\" between two tortillas?  Uh, if you think so, you may be delusional - we're talking seitan chunks with onions and peppers in a cashew \\"cheese\\" base - whatever it was exactly, it was cleverly done. The raw kale salad was superb. And if that little cup of red stuff was a salsa, it could have just as easily been a Gazpacho, because it was wonderful. I was too full to try any desserts.  I docked a star because some guy asked me for money - \\"Pardon me, Dude, but I'm fucking eating right now. Come back in ten minutes.\\"  He didn't return. Of course this isn't Counter Culture's fault, but it tarnished the experience for me just a little bit, and that's not as good as it gets.

It is located in the up and coming Castleberry Hill District amidst other bars, restaurants, and small businesses. Smoke Ring is a barbecue place that has a good bar at night. We used a scout mob for 50% off a dinner table check. We ordered the brisket, pulled pork, and barbecue salad. I think if you're someone who does not have a large appetite, are going for something healthy, or aren't a big meat eater, then I recommend going for a salad rather than a platter. The meat platters are very heavy and the sides are heavy themselves (tots, fries, bacon and blue potato salads, mac n cheese, etc). I think a platter can probably feed 2 people to be honest, as we had to to-go one platter in the end out of the the 2 platters we ordered. \\nBrisket- the brisket was 4-5 large slabs of meat with the fat still on the sides- large generous helpings of this meat for sure. If you're someone who likes whole pieces of meat and are super hungry, then this is your fav dish. I thought it was well done- not too salty and not tasteless. The meat wasn't overly smoked to where you could taste the carcinogens climbing into your taste buds, but you could tell it had that smoky taste. I think 2 people could have split this dish and gotten a side salad, because it is a very generous portion of food. Pulled pork- pulled pork is shreds of pork that is usually oily. My friend wanted pork belly at first, but that is super super oily and probably 60% oil and 40% meat- pulled pork is a grade below and one grade above a dry pork chop. Again, not too salt and overly flavored. It's enough saltiness that you could eat it stand alone, or if you want, still add some barbecue sauce. Both platters had a slice of white toast below- which was mildly confusing to me since it was not enough to make a sandwich out of the meat ,but at the same time, it was almost like, uh thank you for the hidden gem under my meat?\\nSides: we got the waffle fries, brussel sprouts, \\"red caviar\\", and mac and cheese. The Mac and cheese was excellent- definitely heavy alongside our meaty choices but it was baked and had this nice tang to it- i love a sharp cheddar taste and not too bland/oily b/c it would just blend in the already oily meal. The \\"red caviar\\" is actually just like a corn, bean, tomato kind of salsa kind of dish- it's actually nice to go alongside your heavy meat dish if you want some veggies that are not drenched in butter either. I thought the Brussels sprouts were a little too oily for my liking- they could have gone for maybe a more charred dry feel rather than an oily brown charred feel. The waffle fries were good- had the taste of Arby's curly fries but looked like Chick Fil A's waffle fries. Service was good!

He prepared himself for our visit and mentioned our favorites, noting menu items that are no longer offered and comparable replacements. He even arranged for a special dish that was not on the menu that we had previously seen offered to be made for us. One of the things I especially like about Mortons is that they pay close attention to the timing of the meals so that drinks, appetizers, bread, and entrees are served in a timely manner. Not too close together and not with a huge wait in between. This is hard to do and so many restaurants fail at it but Morton's usually seems to have it down perfectly. I imagine that this is not very difficult when you can get to know your regular customers, but not so easy with the customers who come only a few times or less per year. They do take (and keep!) very good notes on their customers so they will remember your preferences. All of the food was delicious. We had a crab cocktail appetizer. I always worry that it might taste a little fishy but it didn't at all. The crab was perfect and there was a lot of it for a cocktail appetizer. It was chilled nicely and came with a mild cocktail sauce and a mild mustard/mayo sauce.  Next up was the onion bread, which has the onion flavor all the way through, and also onion crumbs on top. It has a very light crispy layer on top, and is melt in your mouth soft inside. The bread is served with whipped butter, and a new addition of onion wine jelly that is out of this world. I'm not typically a fan of savory jellies and only tasted it to be polite but WOW, I'll be looking for some savory onion jelly to buy to use at home. I try not to fill up on apps and bread, because I like to save room for dessert. I had the Chicken Christopher for dinner, my usual. Which is a Parmesan crusted chicken breast served with lemon. Sometimes I  can eat half and take half home but not today. I had to save room for dessert. My husband had the lobster and steak. I tried some of the lobster, which I didn't care for but he loved and finished. I didn't try the steak. He loved it but couldn't finish, it was a large 16oz one. We shared a lemon souffle' for dessert, always delicious. He finished his, but again, I could not. The food and service make me wish I could afford to come more often, but it's nice to save this kind of experience for special occasions. Thank you Shane, and everyone at Morton's, for making our anniversary special."},{"name":"Ford's Garage","address":"3210 Margaritaville Blvd","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"4","text":"Cute atmosphere, a burger joint, their food was okay...

We eventually sat ourselves as was few minutes in and nobody welcomed us. Missed the mark last Sat night, it was a slow night yet service was nothing special and there were annoying fruit flies everywhere. A bit gross to be honest and maybe they should do something about it. Still we did enjoy the food, but it all took a very wrong turn when I paid and tipped what I deemed fair for the service received 12% in this case. I didn't realize but the server was watching me and insisted on 15% tip. Who watches, that's not OK and frankly rude. She told us 15% was the standard across the board and advised she had to tip out others, aggressively demanded it. I have never encountered this before and lived in Vancouver my entire life. Not sure where she is from, but tip is a courtesy and not standard anywhere like she claimed. I was in shock but in hindsight should have not leave a tip at all!  And should she have an issue with tipping out her coworkers then it is a discussion for her and management. Definitely not take it out on paying customers, we will not return as should not be hassled for more tip ever which is truly unacceptable. Besides, if you want a better tip then work harder for it and maybe you will get it."},{"name":"Lineage Coffee Roasting","address":"3201 Corrine Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"You need to try the cold brew.

Asked some friends were to eat and they suggested Pok Pok.  It was ok.  The atmosphere was great, the staff was very friendly and helped us select what to eat seeing how it was our first time.  The food also arrived in short order.  My meal was very good and my partner's was sort of on the bland side.  I got some sticky rice to go with mine and I have to say that that is what gave this place a knock down in stars.  It was really really bad.  I love sticky rice but this was terrible.  It was more like cement than sticky and it was served in a plastic bag.  NOTHING should be served in a plastic bag - especially for the prices this place is commanding for their food.  I mentioned this to the gentleman taking our money and he explained that they hear this quite often.  He explained that they served it that way to keep it from drying out.  Then why not serve it in a covered bowl like everyone else does?  I was also told when I had a restaurant of my own that for every 1 person that mentions something bad to you, at least 10 that also feel the same.  If you've heard this more than once, you need to fix it.On the other hand, the gentleman was really nice and thanked us for coming and letting him know what we thought.  He also comped us the rice.

It was really spicy like inedible spicy. Unless you really like spicy, I wouldn't recommend getting it. They had a cute Togo pickup stand inside the restaurant. We saw a lot of locals come in for pickup orders. We were seated outside under a roof which had heaters on top of the seats. I'm not sure why but they were turned on. We were starting to sweat from the papaya salad and even after we asked the server to turn it off, which I don't think it ever completely turned off, it was uncomfortably hot.

Unperturbed by the 45 minute wait, we took up residence at the bar and ordered a few drinks, plus the Pretzels. The logs, with a glazed crust and buttery-soft filling, were delicious but oh-so-salty, particularly with the whipped pimento cheese. We paid slightly more for a fourth at the urging of our bartender, but three would've been plenty.Once we got seated inside, we got a better look at the main room -- well, as good a look as we could muster given the dim lighting -- which resembled a Western-style parlor. Continuing the theme of choosing boldness over subtlety, I opted for the Green Chili Macaroni, which came in a heaping portion with sliced hatch chilis, chunks of grilled chicken, bacon dust, and a creamy corn chowder as the base. It was predictably rich, but the different flavors and textures elevated it above a typical mac-n-cheese preparation. The burn from the chilis added a superb edge as well. My wife's Center-Cut Pork Chop with Bourbon Peaches wasn't as satisfying unfortunately. The sweet and sticky bourbon glaze had all the right components, but the meat wasn't particularly juicy and the flavors had struggled to penetrate to its core.The service was friendly, almost to the point of being overbearing (but our waiter seemed like a genuinely good dude, so no big deal). I found the atmosphere a little peculiar and actually liked the bright, more natural feel of brunch at Moonshine.

It's not a huge selection, but there are some things that are good, and some not so good. I enjoyed the sweet potato, fried scallop, baked chicken, and chicken livers. I thought the banana pudding was a very strange color and did not try it.

The worst thing about the place and most Paneras is that there is no sequence of a line or waiting area. It is a big mess of people crowding the register at the bakery thinking this is where they place the order. On the one occasion I was there, it was so crowded, no one knew where the line started or ended. It is such a turnoff that you want to just call it quits when you enter the mass of crowds.

Our order even had one piece missing. We ordered a plate of pork bulgogi and it was terribly oily and such a small portion. Also disappointing was the kalbi and soon dubu combo. The soup came in the tiniest stone bowl you've ever seen and the amount of kalbi they give you is a joke. It's about 5 pieces of small cut kalbi. It was almost $20.

Always greeted with such Southern friendliness. Brisket is always on point. The flavor is just so amazing, I don't even use their signature BBQ sauce. Brisket is always hot and juicy and full of flavor. I got a small size of cole slaw. It's very fresh and it made perfectly. Everyone does cole slaw differently and they are not created equally. But their cole slaw in my opinion is the classic cole slaw flavor. I love it. I also picked up a small container of the creamed corn. To be honest I'm not a big creamed corn person, but this is a must. It's so rich and crazy good and hot. Great texture with amazing flavor. I was so excited to dig in, I didn't even take a picture of the meal. But take my word for it, from the time you step in to the store, til you step out. Always a wonderful experience. The parking lot is decent. I believe they have parking behind as well. This location has a gas station. A little country store. Family style seating. As in, a bank of picnic tables. Everyone is family here. Dress casual. It's like a picnic inside. There is a covered patio area too. They do sell beer and soda in a trough. Keeping the barn country like theme. Red and white checked table cloths on the picnic tables. It's really a great place. Highly recommend having lunch there. Bring out of town guests there.

Catfish was so salty it was nearly inedible, but it was 9:30 pm and he was starving. Mac n cheese was so spicy my friend couldn't even get halfway through it. My salad looked and tasted nothing like Caesar... it was a load of carrots and radishes over lettuce with some vaguely creamy dressing. Red beans and rice had zero salt, guess they used it all on the catfish. Funky cornbread served with Country Crock balls... seriously gross and depressing all around.

From the outside, it looks very upscale, from the signage to the simple (but clean) architecture. No wait for two people on an early Sunday (around noon). Menus have images for the ramen choices and clear descriptions. I opted for the garlic tonkatsu (extra creamy) and my date got a regular tonkatsu. We also ordered the agedashi tofu and chicken karaage (Japanese fried chicken) to share. So glad I picked the garlic tonkatsu...you can definitely tell the broth was both fragrant and extra creamy (tried my date's regular tonkatsu and it was less creamy). It was creamy enough yet it wasn't so creamy that you felt bloaty afterwards. I would definitely get that again. The soft boiled egg and bamboo shoots were excellent toppers. I might need to order an extra egg next time!I like that you are given an option of picking low sodium to regular sodium. I love salt so I stuck with the regular and will do for future visits. The kind waitress did say that they offered plain broth on the side in case the regular sodium option was too salty but I found that it was perfect.The chicken karaage and agedashi tofu were just average - nothing to write home about. I felt like the batter on the chicken karaage was slightly bland and dry (even though it was served with spicy mayo for dipping purposes). The fried chicken at Boke Bowl is much better.

Easier of course for smaller parties of 2-4 but the staff will try to squeeze you in and then seat you close to your time. On my most recent visit, Matt the owner walked out every few minutes while we were waiting to give us status on our table. He even offered to bring us coffee/tea while we sat outside!FOOD\\n* I have come here twice for brunch. The first time, I ordered the Lobster Eggs Benedict - to die for. Picture a generous portion of fresh lobster meat, asparagus, eggs poached just right (you can request whatever degree of firmness you fancy), a dash of hollandaise sauce that doesn't leave you with a stomach ache, on tasty English muffins. The dish comes with a handful of home fries (really potatoes).* I loved the Smoked Salmon, Bacon, and Avocado Omelet on my second visit. The smoked salmon tasted fresh and flaky while the avocado came in generous slices. I chose toast which came with the omelet and ate all three slices - an anomaly for me but the buttery toasted crunch was too good to refuse.* One friend ordered the Fig, Prosciutto, and Goat Cheese Omelet which he raved about. I tried a bit and enjoyed the tart balsamic twist to the figs plus the fresh leaks. My other friend splurged on the S'Mac and Cheese with no regrets. She comes from the South so she knows good gourmet mac and cheese.* Sides: Try the biscuits with honey butter. Puts Krispy Kreme to shame. :P \\n* Coffee: Lovely roasts. They do the authentic leaf swirls on lattes too.\\n* Overall, portion sizes here are just right - not too big so that yo have room for dessert!SERVICE\\nMatt is the best restaurant owner I know.

You could sing this from the large selection of items that will greet your eyes when you walk past the food selection.  This buffet was packed with goodies.  I went to this establishment off of its rave reviews on Yelp one evening.  Upon arriving it was only about five minutes before I was walking with the hostess into the very spacious dining area.  There is plenty of room in this place.  So much room that it gave plenty of room for unsupervised kids to be running around in the Nori Nori play area without adult supervision because there is nothing patrons love more than kids bumping into them as their parents continue to enjoy their meals.  Yeah that was sarcasm.  Back to my review.  The food was good and a good job of keeping the food fresh when running low was performed by the staff.  As with any buffet place there are those few items that customers seem to hover over waiting to get replenished.  While they wait it would behoove you to walk around and check out some of the other selections.  If I may be so bold I would recommend a trip over to the sushi area.  The selection was varied and many thanks on keeping the sushi fresh as it is made right in front of you.  My only gripe is that the kitchen stops cooking food at 830.  I understand the reason but still when a place is advertised to be open until a certain time I do feel a bit cheated.  I am paying for all the buffet items not just the ones in supply at a certain time.  It really seemed that certain items were not being replenished well before 830.  This is something to keep in mind when dining here.

Today, I starting craving it so I decided to try out this place. It was cool that they opened on labor day and they deliver free of charge with no tip. Let's break down my \\"visit.\\" Ordering: so ordering was easy, you make an account and put in your information. I liked how they put on a \\"real-time\\" tracker for you to determine how close your delivery driver was. Very efficient and minimal people contact. Food: I ordered some chicken fried rice for my boyfriend and honey walnut shrimp for me. His fried rice was $10 and mines was $12. I thought they were competitive prices and a free delivery was a plus. I did take off a star because I saw some strange grey specs on my rice... I had no idea what it was so I discarded that. I didn't happen to see it on my boyfriends fried rice and my shrimp was pretty good (crunchier than most places). Delivery: Overall, my food was stored in a insulator like those pizza places, so that's very nice. My food was very warm and not cold. My driver Anh, called me telling me that my gate code did not work (I gave him a full detail of the code number, where it was and what floor I was on). Ok, I don't mind going down especially since we do have a history of broken elevators anyways. I come down and he explained me the situation, of course I didn't mind especially since it helps him out giving me the food faster. The weird thing was, I used the code for my gate and it worked. So I'm not sure if he was lying that it was broken or what. It really wasn't a big deal, but I thought it was strange. Overall I think this place was pretty solid when it comes for food. The delivery was a bit weird, but it could just be my delivery man. Hoping that the grey specs in my rice was just a one time thing. The rest of the food and service was good.

I felt the food overall was also better than many of the other places in the area as well.  The variety of menu options is nice, compared to the generic \\"mom and pop\\" Italian places.  We got the bone marrow and smoked fish spread appetizers which were good.  The toast for the bone marrow was significantly darker than the toast for the smoked fish, but it didn't taste burnt or anything.  The homemade pasta was solid.  The bolognese was solid as well, not the best, but solid.  The pasta with seared \\"tonno\\" (tuna) was a little lacking to be honest, which is a let down because it carries the name of the restaurant.  It had a bit of a fishy taste which reminds me of the prior frozen tuna that sits all day in the case with that unsettling green shiny shimmer.  The ones that you get because its cheaper and think that it will be fine since you are going to sear it anyway.  The sear was fine, but I've had better.Overall I liked the place and will definitely come back.  I may not get the tuna again, but hope it improves in the future.  It's nice to have a place like this closer to home, with plenty of unique things on the menu to explore in the future.  The outside patio lounge area looks nice also.  I definitely see us bringing friends and family there to chat and have a drink."},{"name":"Din Ho Chinese BBQ","address":"8557 Research Blvd, Ste 116","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Always looking for authentic Chinese food.

I had the pleasure of trying out their weekend brunch recently with friends.  The ambiance is a divvy, 1960's dinner. The seating space is limited inside, with some additional partially covered seating options outside.  They try to procure ingredients from organic and local farmers when possible.  I also like the seasonal focus of the menu.  The staff were incredibly friendly and knowledgeable.The fresh squeezed juices were delicious, I loved that they added sparking wine for a brunch bubbly!  I had the gluten free pancakes - the seasonal flavor was baked in banana and strawberry.  They were by far the best gluten free pancakes I have had yet in life.  I have learned to lower my bar for GF pancakes, but these tasted like the real thing.  Even my non GF friends agreed.  I would go back just for the pancakes.  My husband ordered the omelette of the day and couldn't get past the fake egg taste.  Some people have an acquired taste for that flavor.  He did think the biscuits and gravy were good though.  The migas tacos my friend ordered were tasty.  I liked that you could choose your own two sides with your main plate option.  I also had a taste of her raw oatmeal banana split which was sweet, and more like a breakfast dessert, but tasty.  The texture of the raw oatmeal was a bit slimy, but if you don't mind weird textures this shouldn't be a problem."},{"name":"WAVE Asian Bistro & Sushi","address":"301 N Baker St, Ste 106","city":"Mount Dora","stars":"4.5","text":"Really cool sushi place! The location is tucked in on a side street and upstairs in charming Downtown Mount Dora.

The sushi burger came with a seaweed salad and a special eel sauce, for the \\"burger,\\" you had a choice of salmon, spicy tuna or regular tuna and the \\"bun\\" itself is made out of sushi rice that you can have plain or fried which was similar to sushi roll tempura style. It was overwhelmingly large so if you're coming in with a decent appetite, split it in half to share, but make sure that they cut it in half with the paper wrap around it because the whole thing will fall apart which I did experience when they forgot to put a special request of avocado inside. Everybody said the tempura version was larger and harder to finish. The restaurant did an awesome job of serving 10 of us, we had a 30 minute wait even with our reservation, but not too bad.

Don't be misled by the new sign or the supposed new ownership. What a disaster! This used to be a Margaritas, the worst Margaritas ever. But for me, it was halfway between home and work and so I stopped there more times than I should have. I eventually stopped stopping, even though other Margaritas are reliably decent. I've since moved away but was back in the area just when I was hankering for a margarita. When I noticed the new name -- Ocho Cafe!! -- I thought, Woo hoo! Right? Not so much...The Pros: No trouble finding parking. The Cons: Everything else.Inside, about 5ish on a Saturday, the place was buzzing but not overwhelmingly busy. Maybe half full? My first stop was to the ladies room, which was a total mess: water on the floor, paper towels everywhere. Yuck. When's the last time a manager walked in there?So I grabbed a seat at the bar, or tried to, anyway. Although it was half empty, most of the empty places were covered in dishes and debris. Totally gross. No one had bussed or wiped the bar in ages. (Nor did they the entire time I was there.)I chose the least-objectionable seat. I figured they wouldn't leave it a mess for long, especially since there were three workers in black behind the bar and another guy in a plaid shirt who looked like the manager. Plenty of workers, right? No one looked at me or came near me. Tick-tock, tick-tock. It's not like they're slammed. No one else at the bar is ordering new drinks. But they don't even glance at me. This isn't a huge bar.How long? What are they doing?Finally -- ten minutes? -- one of them glances my way, but it's a cow look -- bland, slow, unthinking.  And even after the glance, he doesn't acknowledge me or come my way. And it's not like he's doing anything else. Everyone else seems to have fresh drinks.Two guys to my right start frantically asking each other what happened to their food. The one guy keeps looking at his running tab and says to the other guy, \\"Did he put in our food?\\" (they were clearly on at least their second drink) and then begins trying to get the attention of somebody behind the bar. He calls and calls and calls. Hey? Hey? Hey? to the bartender who finally finally finally comes over. \\"Did you put in my food order?\\" he asks. The bartender stares at him like the guy asked him to solve a quadratic equation in his head. \\"Tamales??\\" The guy asks again, almost desperate, pleading. Finally, like a cartoon, an ACME light bulb goes off over the bartender's head. \\"Oh,\\" he says. He forgot. So bartender finally looks my way. It's hard to ignore me. I'm sitting right there, next to the hungry guys. Bartender doesn't say anything to me but he takes the menu he just looked at for the guys with the missing food and slaps it in front of me RIGHT on top of a mess of food scraps. \\"Do you have something to wipe this with?\\" I ask. \\"Huh?\\" He doesn't seem to know what I'm asking or why. (This must be management.) (Where is the manager?) Meanwhile, no one has wiped any of the bar or removed a dish....Dear reader, I left. But once in the parking lot, I saw the missing manager hanging about outside. What kind of manager leaves with inept servers running the bar? What kind of manager walks past dirty dishes? What kind of manager never checks the bathroom? What kind of manager leaves a restaurant during dinner service? This manager should have been clearing dishes and wiping counters and making sure all the customers had food and drink. This place is worse than the Margaritas it replaced.

This place is awesome and is the next level for movie theater's and whats to come. Stepping in the doors you realize this is not a traditional movie theater with its boutique hotel style vibe, exquisite finishes, and indoor outdoor bar.  The staff are so hospitable from the moment you walk in. There is a hip lounge music setting the backdrop and you can relax on a bench swing on the patio with your love before your movie, or after. I recommend grabbing a craft beer from their beer wall with 14 unique flavors.  Also, you don't have to rush in to get the best seat, because you do that before hand and have assigned seating.  If you go to studiomoviegrill.com you can select showtimes up to a week in advance (sometimes longer out for blockbusters to ensure you get the best seat in the house). As you get in the theater you quickly see the state of the art technology with comfy leather push button recliners, rotating tray tables to enjoy your meal, and call button to get your severs attention if you need a refill. It does not stop there the laser projection is incredible the clarity of the screen is like none you have scene before, I mean it looks like a giant 4K 240Hz flatscreen vs. all of theaters operating with old bulb projectors technology. The surround sound projects as if the voices are actually coming from the screen and puts you in the center of any action sequence.

New food cart opens up...in the vicinity of other like carts...'Yelp' reviewers who just happen to be giving their first reviews ever, destroy said new cart with one star reviews. Said cart might even have a friend or two help out with giving some 5 star reviews to try and 'balance' the score but honestly, we all know that this is no where indicative of the kind of experience you might have at this business. It remains a crap shoot. Then I come along...willing to roll the die. I mean...honestly, i'm not sure if there is such a thing as a bad taco...of course...as i type that I realize the possibilities...but not here and not at this place. There are at least 5 places within a half mile of this location where you can get really good street tacos (and that is without me looking at a map or list). Two are solid, sit down restaurants. One is a taco truck with a little bit of a sitting area uncovered, another is a taco truck with a carport that you can sit under, and then there is Taqueria El Gordo...which is both. There is a little food cart outside where you can order and right next to it, an old garage (i believe it was) that has a fresh paint job. Bright colors and a TV blaring Mexican soap operas or soccer provide the perfect backdrop to a quick and affordable meal reminiscent of a number of street stalls in Mexico where numerous little shops share space so customers can sit and eat and go. Now, atmosphere wins the day vs competitors in the area (again...it just feels like Mexico)...throw in a few Juarito's or Mexican Coca Cola and you're practically there. Not to mention that they carve the al pastor off of a vertical spit right into your taco per order and i dare you to find a better touch for a taco cart...it doesn't exist...not anywhere in the vicinity. I saw this and only wanted to eat the al pastor...but I spread my wings and branched out. Now, they don't go crazy with 15 different meats...but they keep it simple...I also tried the carne asada and the fish. The only thing I didn't try was the lengua or the chicken...those will have to wait for another visit. The fish, although good, was not great. There was a very light breading on the fish, lots of fish actually...and just a mountain of lettuce, tomatoes, and a huge scoop of guac...it was a trip to flavor town and significantly larger than the other tacos. However, this sounds petty...but it was really messy...too much lettuce, too much guac (how could there be too much guac?) And it was just all over the place...I've eaten fish tacos on the Baja peninsula and I understand there are none better...so maybe i'm just a fish taco snob or maybe I'm looking for a reason to clarify to you that I'm not just another person giving them 5 stars because I'm friends with the owner...which I'm not...honest. I feel like less is more and would actually cut back a bit on the filling just to allow this to come together. It overpowered the fish, even though it was plentiful in it's own right. This is definitely one of those places that fit somewhere between a solid 4 and a scant 5...so why the 5? from an elite? Because honestly, it's easily a 4.75 and some total business crashing noobs have already done damage. If there were 50 reviews, I'd probably consider a 4, but since I want you to get out there and try these wonderful tacos then I will openly skew my score just to give them the bump they need. Fish taco preferences aside, this place provides cheap, yummy tacos that are quick and easy, in a sit down environment and those al pastor tacos...from off the vertical spit...it gets no better than that! Having said that, I will be going back to try the chicken and the tongue...maybe even give the fish taco another whirl...who knows, maybe upon a second chance I'll find it a bit less cumbersome."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Our favorite place for Thai fusion when we are willing to spend a little more.

For our meals, my fianc√© got the large supreme calzone and when they say large, they really mean it. His calzone was huge!

We went for dinner last night with friends, and were largely underwhelmed.  The food reads better on the menu than it tastes.  The kale salad was fine but not a standout.  The lobster pasta dish sounded great and tasted indistinct.  The ciopinno never exceeded the sum of the parts.  We skipped dessert because we weren't feeling it.  The place has a nice atmosphere and they did a nice job with the surroundings.  Too bad the food is not as equally nicely done.One has to be at the top of their game in Wakefield given the options.  Personally, I think Massimo's is unbelievable.  The place inside is a dump, and the food is off the charts spectacular.  And incredibly inexpensive for what you get there.  I think Caffe Italia is also very good, not as outstanding as Massimo's, but the interior is much nicer and the overall experience is excellent albeit in a slightly different way.  Massimo's is all about the food, Caffe Italia has excellent food and a nice atmosphere.  Both are very enjoyable.  Tonno's is not in the league of either of them based on one visit.

This place used to be called the Whet Bar which hasn't changed much at least interior wise. Our server was very witty but he made a mistake with our order and two of our appetizers arrived way earlier than the third one.I started off with a glass of Cedar Creek Riesling which was on the drier side and complemented my appies could gracefully.\\n \\nWe shared a bunch of appetizers, the scallops were amazing with the right texture and freshness. The chicken breast with vegetables on the side was very healthy, the meat was quite tender but tasted rather bland.Mushroom gnocchi could also be improved as there were only a few mushrooms to be found but the cheese was generously sprinkled.

It's like they took a big mondo warehouse-style bookstore and it hatched a bunch of other bookstores right off its back. This place is an incredible multi-story maze of giant book-filled rooms that seem to go on and on for days. You could seriously get lost in a place like this, not only because of its size, but because they have every single book imaginable. No, really - they do. Luckily, Powell's has avoided stranding book browsers by handily color-coding the rooms to make things easy to find. The selection of used books is impressive, and there are plenty of good sale prices to be had throughout the store. The kids' area has a couple of seating areas with a table where you can test-run the picture books or have an impromptu story time. There are benches scattered around here and there if you want to take a load off while you're hiking the book stacks. Honestly, I doubt there would be room for much more furniture than that - the place is so densely packed with books!

However, once there is a 20+ minute wait, quality disintegrates. If you must go during a busy time, here are some tips.\\n1. Walk up to the host and ask to be added to the wait list. The host also buses the tables so it might be hard to catch him. If you wait, he will come to the line eventually, like maybe after 10-15 minutes, but will put people on the list randomly rather than in order.\\n2. If you want entrees to show up at the same time so your table may eat together, order all together. The waitress will want to take your order the second you sit. If anyone orders, their food will show up minutes later even if the other people asked her for a few minutes to look at the menu and haven't yet ordered. Pho Basil recommends you look at the menu while waiting and that is worth doing because when they are busy, they just want you to eat and leave as soon as possible."},{"name":"The Vancouver Fish Company","address":"1517 Anderson St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Outstanding service!

The meat was moist, and the skin crispy and caramelized, coated with a sticky, sweet, and overly salty sauce. Fish sauce is already pungent and salty on its own; there needn't be extra salt on top of it. In the end, the wings were worth the try, but I wasn't too crazy about them.Muu Paa Kham Waan (charbroiled boar collar with herbs and spices) was spicy with a lingering, burning sensation in the mouth. Perfect for those who love spicy foods! The boar meat was moist and tender, with a nice sear/ browning. It's served with a side of chilled raw mustard greens to help tone down the heat, yet a bowl of rice is recommended too.Khao Soi (curry noodle soup) was warming, rich, and creamy. The noodles were bouncy with a nice chew, and the chicken was moist but to my disappointment, bone-in, so dissecting the meat off the bone was sloppy. A side of condiments (lime, cilantro, shallots, pickled mustard greens, chili paste) was provided.Overall, Pok Pok offers decent Thai food, but it wasn't particularly amazing for me. And everything was not worth ~$15 per plate price tag, as portions were small. However, with small plates, this allows for ample sampling of everything on the menu, especially for large groups.

The ace juice baristas at JuiceLand quickly concocted a drink that probably would have taken me 15 minutes to make, with another 10 minutes of clean-up. Though the finished product is definitely pricier than I expected ($9.95 for a large) and will remain a treat, I found it absolutely delicious, interesting, spicy and refreshing... all at the same time. My juice du jour? The Tree of Life, with carrot, turmeric, coconut, ginger, lime, cayenne and beet. I'm actually one of those bizarre people who detest beets (just like tomatoes, they're too earthy for me) but I actually loved them in this blend. In fact, I tried a juice made with beets just yesterday and barely got that one down... the cayenne, turmeric and coconut made this one a winner.Besides live juice blends, JuiceLand makes smoothies, a small array of vegan dishes and even sells cleanses by the quart and gallon.

Reasons for this:1. Brisket\\nThere are choices when you go with brisket here. You have to get the moist.: so much flavor and so soft and tender. As pieces fall of here and there, I eat em up. It's only been a day since I've had this and I already miss it terribly!2. BBQ Sauce\\nBBQ sauce is super duper tangy with a bit of spice. I like how you can see the black pepper bits in the huge bottle of sauce that sits on the picnic tables you sit at.3. Ordering Process\\nSince it's so popular, you stand in a Disneyland-like line and order by weight (ex. half pound) like you're talking to a butcher (and you very well may be).  Instead of the ads on tvs you may see in an amusement park ride line, in this line the while you wait entertainment features their very own \\"Cutter Cam\\" showing the meat you are soon to enjoy being sliced. After ordering, your meal is handed to you via a big ole black Coca-Cola crate containing a bunch of slices of Wonder-type white bread, your meat, and butcher paper to eat off of. No plates here! 4. Eating Experience\\nYou look for a picnic table to share with neighbors if need be in crowded times. Then you chow down on your own make your own sandwich: piling on a bit of bread, lots o meat, and pour on the sauce. They also have a pickle and onion bar you can pull from to supplement your own creation. I loaded up on pickle slices since that's a new obsession for me. No I'm not pregnant!5. Atmosphere/Decor\\nTo top everything off, there's fun decor to add to the personality of the place:\\n- Huge BBQ sauce dispenser the size of a toddler\\n- A picture of cattle on a ranch on the wall with the slogan \\"Real People Eat Meat\\"\\n- It's also a convenience store\\n- How can you not love the cheeky restaurant slogan \\"The Worst BBQ in Texas\\"? ;-)LOVE it!

Extra cucumber slices for the GF customer, who can't eat the toast, shouldn't prompt a lecture on why this costs the restaurant more 4.

Perhaps I came on a fluke night, but I was sorely disappointed. If there is one good thing I can say about the restaurant, it is that it is spacious and gorgeous inside. The walls are subtly made of oyster shells, the ceilings are high, and the lighting is beautiful.I came with my sister at around 9:30 pm on a Saturday night and surprisingly there was no wait, despite people telling me there would be a long line. I may be a little petty on this subject matter, but the tap water they served us was lukewarm. It sounds trivial but it annoys me that I had to ask three times for a cup of ice. We started off with four oysters each. As fresh as they were, the sharp bits of shell in my oyster that I almost slurped down my throat was a huge negative. The fact that this happened in two out of four of my oysters? Not good.For the main entree, since my sister and I were not that hungry, we split the lobster roll. That lobster roll was the worst  I've ever had without exaggeration. i will describe many ways in which I thought it was a failure. First off, the portion for $25 is a rip off. At Neptune Oyster, the lobster roll is also around the same price, but so much bigger. At ICOH they put pieces of celery in the lobster roll so it almost reminded me of a tuna salad or chicken salad. There was also very minimal amounts of lobster in the roll. Lastly, the bread to lobster ratio was way off as in there was so much bread but very little lobster. At points I felt like I was just eating bread. They serve it to you with some potato chips and a tiny bit of coleslaw, but that stuff is cheap.Service is also incredibly slow.In the end my sister and I only spent about $65 total for the entire meal, which really isn't too bad, but then again we didn't get that much food. I feel like I would have had a better time going to McDonalds."},{"name":"Kevin Rathbun Steak","address":"154 Krog St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I pity any and all vegetarians, vegans for they are missing out...well, their veggies are awesome too. Overall, KNOCKS all the other steakhouses out of the park. Best BAR, FOOD, Dining Experience , Patio, everything.There is not one thing that is lacking here. All the appetizers, salads and sides are tremendously tasty and not overpriced. I recommend the Steak for 2 or 3, over the over-ordered Filet Mignons. This is the place to try a new cut of steak. I am glad I live across the railroad tracks. I can be out my door and in thru theirs in 45  seconds flat.  If it happens to be your bday, you get a free dessert.  Servers are expertly trained and the management is great. Chef Rathbun makes several appearances during the week and you can feel the crew is happy to work there and proud of it. High five to Chef Rathbun and his son who is the Head chef.! The patio area is incredibly relaxed yet classy.  there is a covered area where cigar smoking is allowed,and an open patio is available for dining. I suggest you eat your dessert outside because is super romantic in the late evening.Attention to small details like keeping reading glasses of various prescriptions available for the customers, as well as flash lights (it is candle lit dinner style decor), and for those who HAVE to have a white napkin, they are definitively available.The inside decor is outstanding and a great mix of wood and metal. They have a downstair called the Cellar, for private parties.The bartenders really know their stuff! Overall, everyone should come in and continue coming in.

I decided to give it a try, even though I am a loyal customer of another outstanding pizza joint in town. I walked in and sat at the bar. It was busier than I expected. I ordered the chicken panini which came with an arugula tomato salad. It took about fifteen minutes to come out. I absolutely cannot stand around arugula, but whatever dressing they put on the salad was fantastic. I enjoyed the salad more than the panini! It could've used more tomatoes.The panini had a nice kick, due to the sauce, but it was otherwise lacking in flavor. The chicken was blackened, but not seasoned. I left most the chicken and just ate the bread and other toppings.I will say there was a little confusion on their lunch specials. The bartender said he didn't know what they were and to look on the board, but the board outside said nothing about specials. A little odd making someone leave the restaurant and go outside instead of offering to figure it out. Than the lady at the cash register pointed at the pies on display and said they were the lunch specials, but didn't offer any additional information like pricing, etc. They're new so they have kinks to work out. I couldn't decide between three and four stars, but ultimately decided upon four because if a restaurant can make me like something I hate they must be doing something right! If I have the same lack luster experience with my main dish next time I'll lower my rating.**Now that I've found out the lunch special is two slices and a drink for $6 I'm pretty upset that it wasn't explained to me and that I paid $10 for a panini. I'm not going to lower my rating, but they need to be more informative to customers because no one likes lazy employees."},{"name":"Moderne Burger","address":"2507 W Broadway","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Wow.

The patio seating seemed pretty small and spread out. Thankfully we were able to snag a couple seats at the patio bar which was a separate area out back from the inside bar (which seemed small).The bartenders were super friendly (but then again, everyone in Texas seems to be). We were promptly greeted, given great recommendations, etc.I wasn't super hungry so we got two apps and hubby got himself the chicken and waffles. Shrimp corn dogs: The first two were great. Sort of towards the end of the 2nd dog, you realize that it's quite greasy. Still tasty though but I would limit intake to 1.5.Fried green tomatoes: Likewise, the FGT's were delicious for the first two slices. You do quickly notice the batter is pretty thick and you only barely taste the tomatoes. You mostly taste the breading and the pretty delicious sauce and shrimp on top. So if you're an FGT fan, this dish might annoy you.Chicken and Waffles: Definitely a great iteration of this classic dish. Hubby gobbled it all up after offering me a perfunctory bite. He didn't manage to finish so I did get a bit more waffles when he was finished. The \\"gravy\\" was served on the side and lighter than you would have ever hoped for.At some point, a big group of women who'd just come in from out of town for a conference made their way in, one even standing on the side that was for serve staff only.

There is only one person who does all the cooking and he is a genius especially in managing the process of feeding 20 customers at a time and being very efficient. Watching him (as well as the rest of the crew) is a joy. I would come back only for that. Food: we went with the standard choice of aglio olio or black pasta with ground octopus, scallop linguine in white sauce, and clams casino. Black ink pasta is very special, has a distinct taste, looks instagramable, and I would order it again. The taste is really simple, no need to decompose it into flavors and tastes, but the freshness and that simplicity (probably only four ingredients - pasta, octopus, oil, and garlic) make it one of the most delicious meals. Linguine and scallops - I would eat every day, maybe just rotate the sauces:) Again, nothing sophisticated but heavenly good.

I got Beef Brisket Hot Pot while I wasn't a fan of the flavors it was still cooked wonderfully and I loved trying something new. Definitely want to go back for some of their seafood, the table next to us had crab that was pulled from the tank. Also their duck looked amazing!"},{"name":"Hey Love","address":"920 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"A beautiful oasis on a cold, rainy day. The interior is absolutely beautiful and the entire atmosphere of the place is so calming and fresh. You cannot go wrong with anything on the food menu, and the drinks are fun and inventive, completing the checklist of a lovely meal. Definitely recommend if you're looking for something laid back and different, and a great spot for cocktails. Why only 3 stars? Service. I was here with a small group and we all left feeling completely ignored...it took 15 minutes for someone to even come to our table, and over 30 minutes to come by again to take our order. It wasn't very busy, otherwise the wait would be a given. I'm torn, because the food and drinks were fantastic, but having to get up and find someone to take our order is a bit much. Our last round of drinks never made it to the table as we had already finished dinner and had to go, we had waited as long as we could. Honestly, it's a beautiful spot with delicious food. You should absolutely visit."},{"name":"Soto South Lamar","address":"1100 S Lamar Blvd, Ste 2115","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Watch out Uchi, there is a new sushi boss in town! Chef Andy is a sushi god! He makes the most creative, mouth-watering sushi dishes I've ever had. He takes the time to ask what you like and dislike and always remembers his customers. I've been going to the North location every since they opened, but I live in Westlake, so I am overjoyed that they opened a South Lamar location!!! My husband and I went in for the soft opening and were thrilled to see one of our other favorite sushi chefs there as well: Teddy! The quality of food is top notch. The service is impeccable. The location is convenient. We will be regulars for sure. Favorite dish is the fire salmon! Order it and have your camera ready! Love this place."},{"name":"Dunkin'","address":"13605 S Apopka Vineland Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"2.5","text":"Have been there 2x different years same result both evening time stale, old product waste of $$ skip this better off at 7 eleven"},{"name":"Sushi Sakura","address":"506 SW 6th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"It's not the greatest conveyor belt sushi. But I just have to comment on something that's noteworthy. This place has the worst miso soup that I have ever tasted. I can only describe it as being as close as hot water mixed with a few pieces of tofu and floating seaweed. That's it, bland as hot water. The prices are a bit high for conveyor sushi. There aren't many varieties either.  I just don't think I would ever want to go back even if I'm desperate for a quick sushi fix."},{"name":"Sweet-Stack Creamery","address":"25 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"The ice cream is delicious and atmosphere and decor is great however the customer service was lacking.

I had the most amazing tacos and margaritas here. Salsa bar is awesome. Nachos are very fresh, there's at least 8 salsas to try them with . I really had a good experience here. Do not hesitate to go in coz of the other bad reviews. Service was awesome. Our waitress was always checking in on us."},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"If you don't mind filthy, worthless junkies hanging around inside and out, as well as rancid homeless tramps/indigent bums that smell like piss, shit, and alcohol using the restrooms for bathtubs/showers and personal bathing areas (and a place to shoot up), then this is the place for you.

I ordered via DoorDash as I was craving carbonara (it's been a weird craving for me lately). On the menu, they have a tortellini carbonara which wasn't really appealing to me, but they did allow you to sub for a different type of pasta. They offered linguini or angel hair, so I went with angel hair.  Additionally, I ordered up an appetizer of garlic bread.The order came quickly via DoorDash and was still hot. I was confused, however, because I didn't get garlic bread, I got a white pizza. In a pizza box. With loads of cheese and garlic, but it was a pizza nonetheless. Don't get me wrong, it was delicious, but I ordered food for just myself. I didn't need an entire white pizza in lieu of the half a baguette with garlic and butter that I was expecting. The carbonara was oozing oil and the consistency isn't what I'm used to. The flavor was lovely, but I kept getting splashed by oil when I was trying to eat and it was off-putting. I much prefer a creamier texture for carbonara. I want to reiterate that this meal was by no means bad! It was simply unexpected, I think. The menu boasts a lot of Italian staples that I would love to try in the future and now that I know what to expect in terms of portion sizes, I am pretty excited to order some stuff to share."},{"name":"Cantina Laredo","address":"1680 29th St","city":"Boulder","stars":"3.5","text":"The food was bloody awful!
