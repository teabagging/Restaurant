In retrospect, I realize there's a Black's BBQ and a Tony Black's BBQ. I think their own by the same family, just different members run each?\\n\\nBut it was amazing for me. Big black sign so you can't miss it, and the first thing you will notice after getting out of the car is the smoke house to the side of the restaurant where the meat comes from. Inside you get hit first with the merch if you want to buy any souvenirs or BBQ sauce and/or seasoning. Than you walk around, and that's where the food start. \\n\\nHonestly the first thing I loved about this place is I didn't get a plate. I got a tray, and it had a few layers of clean parchment paper on it to place food. That to me was a good sign. First came the sides, I didn't really any sides, only the potato salad, which was really good.\\n\\nThan you walk over to 4 carving stations where you can order the meat by the 1/3, half pound, 3/4, or by the pound. I just HAD to get an amazing beef rib. It is the most expensive thing on the menu (about $30 a rib) but it is totally worth it. Each rib is about 1 to 1 1/2 pound. I ordered a rib, a sausage, and brisket. Sausage was good, got a nice snap to it and it was beefy. I think the brisket was just as good as Franklin's \\n\\nThe Beef Rib was the crown jewel of the whole thing. I saw something similar to it here in the Bay Area, California once, but pretty sure it wasn't as good as this. It was so tender that I tried to pick it up and all I picked up was the bone. Had to eat it with knife and fork, but it was super juicy, super flavorful. The sauces they have on the table are great as well. They also give bread and pickles to go with the bbq. Pickles I got some, but I stay away from the bread, no need when I wanted to make sure i get the full flavor of the meat in every bite. \\n\\nThis place is a definite winner for me. How good was it? My buddy and I went back a second time with some friends right before going to the airport to come home. Definitely left Austin on a high note in terms of having really good BBQ.\\n\\nOne of the other advantages is that wait here is not nearly as long as Franklin's.

Valet was only $2.00 with a tip of course. The valet service were very nice and had things in order. Walking in you will be pleasantly greeted and attended to. They have a great atmosphere and decor was very sophisticated. The front desk workers were knowledgeable about how every thing worked. It was a weekend for us, so the price was $35.00 a hour plus cost of shoes. Now there are other games there as well which we took full advantage of before and after we bowled. They have giant size jenga, bocce ball, skee ball and basketball and a few other games. As we started bowling right away came our fantastic waiter, he made us feel right at home. We ordered a couple of drinks which came out very swiftly.  Around 9pm they have a live band that made you feel like you are at a concert. The place went the next level and was rocking. After bowling we took at look at their menu, which had a lot of great food options with reasonable prices. We chose the waffle dogs and loaded fries. It was wonderful and tasty.

The first time we ate here about a year ago, I loved the food (atleast 3.5-4 star worthy) and were happy to find a decent Indian joint in the neighborhood. Since then the food has just gotten progressively worse. Our last visit was about a month ago and was pretty much the worst Indian food I've ever had. First of all, they got our order wrong. We ordered the mushroom samosas and got the potato variety which we returned. When the mushroom samosas did arrive they were dripping buckets of oil and were nearly inedible. The 'bhel' was equally atrocious. For main course, we decided to get \\"chicken chili' and 'hakka noodle bowl'. Chicken chilli was basically large, chewy chicken pieces with large pieces of onions and peppers floating in oil. The hakka noodle bowl was shocking and was pretty much a lo mein with no flavor. We were so disappointed with the experience that we don't plan to come here again unless they decide to fix things!

Yummy, tasty battered fish accompanied by a cool sauce.\\n\\nFalafel taco:  The falafel was softer than I've ever seen it.  Paired with something like a tzatziki sauce and something like sriracha.  \\n\\nChorizo taco: The flavorful chorizo doesn't need much else to make this taco awesome.  We both really liked how simple this taco was, and it became an instant favorie.\\n\\nShrimp ceviche: If you like shrimp and vinegar, you'll like this.  The shrimp was fresh and had a great texture, and the sliced peppers were great, too, but I couldn't eat the pickle-ish juice for long.  It was also surprisingly spicy, once you kept eating it for a while.  If these are all things you like, though, go for it!  It was all very fresh and exciting.\\n\\nOther tacos we've had before: The oyster taco had thicker breading this time, which wasn't a big deal, I just liked it better the first time I had it with thinner breading.  I thought I tasted some spiciness in the oyster taco.  It wasn't bad, I just don't like spice, and I'll make sure to ask for no spice next time.  Also, both the oyster taco and the chicken taco had a lot more cilantro than was necessary.

It's not bad, it's just kind of \\"blah.\\" The sandwiches are tiny (I can easily knock out two sandwiches as a meal), and the chicken salads are decidedly average. I generally love curry chicken salads, and while Caf√© at Pharr's isn't bad, I think I've enjoyed the curry chicken salad at pretty much every other restaurant I've had it more. \\nI also tried the chicken noodle soup today, and it was pretty bland, which has been my experience here in general. I will say, the croissants are quite good and the little yogurt roll dessert things you get with each sandwich are a nice touch. But when chicken salad is your specialty, and it's not any better than a typical chicken salad at a neighborhood get-together...well, enough said. \\nBut, given their popularity, my opinion appears to be in the minority."},{"name":"Champions","address":"110 Huntington Avenue","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"This place was horrible!

It's like a rite of passage.\\n\\nSo first off, I am tired of seeing people complain about this place being a stuck-up yuppie playground with overpriced food. 1) Think about where this place is located, of course it's not gonna be your typical burger joint! 2) Hopdoddy clearly markets themselves as a different sort of burger bar than most other burger places, don't come in here expecting Dan's Hamburgers 2.0 and leave offended at the snooty decor and 'outrageous' prices. Apples and oranges, yall. 3) If you hate yuppies that much, you probably need to get out of Austin. Just saying.\\n\\nAnd on that note, let me just say that I love the way Hopdoddy is set up. I'm a fan of the decor, for sure. Both this location and the W. Anderson location have the same vibe going for em that really makes Hopdoddy seem like a chill place to grab a bite. The ordering system makes long lines go a lot faster than most other places, which I can definitely appreciate. (Plus, free 2 hour parking in a parking garage? Uh yes please.)\\n\\nFood: My favorite has always been the magic shroom. Mmmm so good. A close second is the greek, and that's just because it's a LAMB burger... I love lamb. If you can, get the fries! Split it if you can't finish. But seriously, get the fries. The seasoning makes these thin-cut fries amaaaazing.\\n\\nHonestly, I'm glad to pay the $10-12ish bucks here at Hopdoddy. I always leave full and happy, which is more than I can say for some other places where a meal would cost just as much. \\n\\nWhen I have friends visiting, I make sure this is one place they stop by. It's not super \\"Austin\\"-y in that historic, cultural sense, but I do think it's one of THE spots to check out in town."},{"name":"Hopdoddy Burger Bar","address":"1400 S Congress Ave, Ste A190","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"It's true.

The onion rings were also delicious.  The beer selection is also pretty good..I ended up just getting a Pilsner, but I also got a free sample of some blackberry beer which was really tasty too.  The waitress who gave me that sample was really cute and obviously very nice so that was a plus.  The wait was sort of ridiculous (45 minutes on a Tuesday night), but I didn't really mind it up that much. \\nI knocked off one star because I tried to come back here later with a group of other people, and had some issues.  One of the girls had forgot her ID and they said she couldn't go in..fine, whatever, they need to stick to the rules. However, when we asked if we could get it to go, they said alright, but we couldn't wait inside.  Mind you, it was TORRENTIALLY DOWNPOURING!  I mean, what do they expect us to do?

We ordered the Saumon Fume, Tagine, Paella, and a waffle with the milk chocolate lavender topping. The stand out was probably the Saumon Fume; great balance between savory and yet healthy. It wasn't too heavy like the Tagine. The highlight to the Tagine though was the spicy sausage, that's pretty much it. As for the paella, it was just okay. Vegetable lovers will love it, but we found it a bit bland. Lastly, the waffle was underwhelming, it could have been because we prefer our waffles brussels style rather than liege. Along with our meals, we ordered an Americano, cappuccino, and a coffee, all drinks were decent.\\n\\nThe prices here are on the higher side, and the portions differ depending on what you order.

My Taiwanese style kimchi hit the spot, though it didn't seem too special.\\n\\nThe interior is pleasant and a little upscale but not too fancy. Mostly tables of two. There's an open kitchen in front. Service is a lot more casual, you check off what you want on a paper menu, they take it to the kitchen then fold it up and tape it to your table. But friendly and efficient. Although it's famous for the noodle soup, their dessert menu is even longer than the dinner menu, all kinds of slushies and teas. My mango shaved ice was delicious, it was an intimidating huge bowl but very fluffy thin ribbons so it wasn't as overwhelming as it looked.

There weren't many guests there and we had the discussion that it seemed like there were more staff members than guests in the restaurant.  After we were seated, the waiter who was very friendly, promptly took our order of a couple old fashioned drinks for myself and my friend and a couple waters.  A few minutes later, we also ordered food.  We brought the waiter back after about 15 minutes to inquire about the drinks and it took another 5 minutes for the drinks to come out.  So it took an overall 20 minutes on that fairly quiet night in the restaurant to get our drinks.  The old fashioned was made right in the sense that there was a large ice cube, orange peel, and cherry, but it was quite watered down in taste.  \\n\\nIt took 30 minutes to get our food and the mac & cheese that I ordered was under-cooked.  I am not one to complain in restaurants but in my mind, that was Strike 3 (no pun intended) after the late drinks and food.  The manager was very nice and through our discussion, she not only comped the whole meal but also got me a new mac & cheese to go.  That service definitely added a couple stars to the review. \\n\\nAfter that we ordered a couple more old fashioned drinks that we said we would pay for to the waiter and they came out in decent time but these drinks were extremely watered down and it was a disappointment.  We told the waiter to bring us the check for the old fashioned drinks after that but he never came by after we waited 15 minutes so we figured that those must have been comped also which was a nice touch but I suppose we could have been informed of that.  Unfortunately because of how long we spent at the restaurant, the Braves game had ended by the time we were finished so instead of getting out early and beating the traffic and Uber surge pricing, we were forced to endure it.\\n\\nOverall although the service was lacking, food and drinks were not of quality, the manager quickly and effectively performed service recovery and so the restaurant deserves a 3 star review."},{"name":"BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse","address":"10515 N Mopac Expy","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"Best chicken fried chicken in town.

We made a reservation on a Saturday night and arrived 10 minutes early to find a crowd of people (all of whom also had reservations ranging anywhere from 7:45PM-8:30) waiting outside the tiny restaurant. Needless to say, we were not seated on time and actually sat down closer to 9:15PM. \\nAlthough we were tempted to check out one of the hundreds of other Italian restaurants in the area, we decided to wait it it out and try the food based on the good recommendation we received. Once we were finally seated, the waitress was very attentive and the atmosphere was very cozy. The food overall was just OK- not bad, but not the best Italian I've ever had. The waitress was not too knowledgeable about the wine but we ended up getting a pretty good bottle. \\nMy favorite part of dinner was the BREAD PUDDING we had for dessert - I love bread pudding and order it whenever I can and this one was really delicious and moist."},{"name":"Medina Cafe","address":"780 Richards Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Breakfast at Cafe Medina is not what you would expect.  Most of the dishes are baked or braised, rather than fried, so the menu contains things like cassoulet and a lamb sausage tagine rather than the typical eggs and bacon.  The emphasis is on all sides of the Mediterranean, so a group of four could easily end up with Spanish, French, Moroccan, and Middle Eastern dishes on the same table.  There are also waffles and omelets for those interested in a more conventional meal.\\n\\nMy tagine was as tasty as lamb sausage, spicy tomato sauce, and poached eggs should be, and the heartiness of the food more than made up for what appeared at first to be a relatively small portion.  I don't know what they did to the butter, but it was hard for me not to eat it with a spoon after eating both tiny pieces of focaccia.\\n\\nThe logistics don't really seemed to have been worked out, though.  There is no drip coffee, just espresso, so coffee service is slow and getting a refill entails buying another drink.  They didn't quite seem to have enough staff to cover everything on a busy Sunday morning, as I only seemed to see my waitress about five minutes after I started to wonder if she was ever going to visit my table again.  Don't be put off by the apparent small size of the restaurant, though - beyond the narrow dining room that's visible from the street is a second dining room in the back.\\n\\nCafe Medina probably isn't a good place to go if you are in a hurry or trying to entertain dining companions with a very narrow conception of breakfast, but it is highly recommended to anyone looking for a meal that is slightly out of the ordinary."},{"name":"White Spot","address":"5550 Kingsway","city":"Burnaby","stars":"3","text":"This is a bigger White Spot.

Went with a small group of friends and we tried several items. Let's start with the location. The location is good on the corner of Morse and Penn. Parking was available at this time, but you can see this is an issue. The building was nice and the atmosphere was cozy. The cafeteria style works for the restaurant.  The drink stations are clean and the hand washing station attached is classy and hygienic. The staff is very friendly and the expediter was great at ensuring the plates were clean and presentable.  \\n\\nThe first order was 3 piece bone-in chicken, generous size (3 sides).  The sides were mac and cheese, fried okra, and smashed potatoes with gravy.  There was a piece of honey butter cornbread, and I bought a coconut cream mini-pie.  The sides were all equally fantastic, the cornbread, amazing, and the pie was good, but I've had better.  \\n\\nMy largest complaint and the reason this review is just 3 stars is this.  Number one, it's a chicken place. It's called the Coop....  The chicken breast was smaller than the thigh and very disappointing.  I don't consider a wing worthy to be called a piece of chicken, and there should be an option for a leg instead, no one asked....   The spices were great and the crisp was perfect.  It comes down to the size of the breast.  Publix's fried chicken has larger cuts of meat.  Fix this and you increase.  The pricing is a little high, but can be over looked if the chicken portion was corrected."},{"name":"Hopdoddy Burger Bar","address":"1400 S Congress Ave, Ste A190","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Hopdoddy is my absolute favorite place to get a burger in Austin!

If you're hungry, expect to shell out extra for a decent portion of noodles and pretty much any topping like egg or seaweed or anything that would normally be built into the standard ramen price. While the ramen is authentic Fukuoka ramen, I just didn't feel it justified how little bang I got for my buck compared to other places.\\n\\nThe ability to customize your noodles and broth is a unique touch, and entices you to come back to try a different combination of noodle firmness and broth thickness. But the \\"customization\\" feels like a gimmick when you have to pay extra for anything beyond the small portion of noodles and two thin strips of pork. The base price costs about 12 dollars.

It is pretty good food, just misses a few things that keep it from being great.\\n\\nFood:  Went with company, and tried a few bites of their dishes as well! (F) means that this was a friend's dish that I sampled, so my account may not fully reflect the dish.   \\n\\nStarters: \\n\\nPolenta Fritta al Gorgonzola: (F)Crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside, came out piping hot with a cream sauce.   My personal taste I found this a bit rich, although executed well. \\n\\nAsparagus: (F) Grilled asparagus wrapped in proscuitto with mozzarella.  Served with what looks like a pesto sauce.   Savory and salty--asparagus was excellently prepared. \\n\\nCapesante: Perfectly seared and seasoned sea scallops with a brandy cream sauce and a bit of balsamic vinegar.  My favorite--I'm a sucker scallops and this was executed very well.  I had to prevent myself from licking the plate. \\n\\nMains: \\n\\nGnocchi alla Bava: (F) Served in a fontina cream sauce with poppy seeds.   Deceptively simple--I had tried a gnocchi without poppy seeds(on the plate, about 1 inch diameter the \\"outer rim\\" of gnocchi there was no poppy seeds at all on top of them)  on it and it was lacking in depth of flavor.  However trying one with poppy seeds it was delightful.  Tender, feather-light gnocchi. \\n\\nSalsiccia di Cinghiale: (F) Wild boar sausage with polenta and provolone.  The sausage was savory and smoky.  Very good.  \\n\\nSeafood Ravioli: Special for the evening.  Served in a tomato white wine sauce with parsley and garlic I believe.  Bay scallops were placed between the raviolis.  Ravioli was filled with ricotta.   Ravioli was tasty, however felt that the seafood ravioli seemed a bit misleading as I didn't seem to taste anything inside the filling that brought the flavors together.  The bay scallops were a bit disappointing--they were slightly fishy tasting, however the tomato wine sauce was delectable, it's just that the bay scallops brought down what would have been I think an otherwise fantastic sauce.  I think it would have been better if there was no seafood in it at all.  Overally this  was  a disappointing dish considering how the other dishes I tasted(which were good!). \\n\\nDessert: \\n\\nMillefoglie: (F)   Puff pastry with chantilly cream, strawberries and blueberries.  Have not ever had real/authentic millefeuille so I have nothing to base it off of other than what I experienced.  Slightly warm, crispy flaky layers of pastry with a touch of cinnamon played off nicely from the tart strawberries and rich cream. \\n\\nBocconotti: (F) Apple pie in a ravioli.  Rich, warm and decadent.  If you love warm apple pie, I recommend you try this.  It is a heavy dessert. \\n\\nZabaglione: Custard made with Marsala and topped with raspberries, blackberries, strawberries and either bits of pear or apple.  Creamy, boozy and a bit airy from other zabalione's I've tried (I'm used to it being a bit more dense and heavier in body and slightly more yellow possibly because others have more egg yolks?)--however not unpleasant.  I scraped my bowl clean. \\n\\nAtmosphere and Service: \\n\\nThis is tucked away in a strip mall next to a Jack-in-the-Box.  Atmosphere is a bit bare--it's a warm interior however not quite lavish or glamorous as some people would like or expect.  Doesn't really bother me.  Fabio was our server for the evening with a great sense of humor.  This was a bit of a leisurely dinner (there's some downtime between meals) which might not be for some people, but it was a plesant experience with the company I went with. \\n\\nI really want to rate this higher (I love Italian cuisine) but it's tiny little oversights on the execution of food that prevent this place from being truly great.  Price wise it is going against other restaurants (Maggiano's and North come to mind) with better execution and quality of food, and either the quality and exeuction of food needs to step up, or the prices need to come down just a hair."},{"name":"Maenam","address":"1938 W 4th Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"This hotel came recommended by a friend (who works at The Fairmont Pacific Rim) of the chef.

I like that everything is self serve, except the meat, of course. You start by grabbing plate and tray and proceed to the sides, which are self serve buffet style.

Everything else is self serve, all the condiments (crackers, pickles, onions, bread, drinks utensils, even free ice cream.) Sauces and paper towels are on each table.) No waiting for someone to bring you things, which means you can get down to EATING. Now, all of that would not matter if it werent for the star of the show, Texas BBQ and that means brisket. I got moist, but if had a little too much fat for me so the nice butcher cut out as much as i wanted. Very good bark, good flavor, right amount of smokiness, I really enjoyed.

Lucky for us, there were 2 seats at the bar available, so we took it. I highly recommend you to get reservations when going here for dinner. \\n\\nWe were greeted at the door by the manager, Pepe, who took our us to the bar. He offered to hang up our jackets, which was a nice touch. Once at the bar and being our first time here, the bartender, Lesley was super nice and very informative. Conversations went from South America, about the chef, and information on Woburn. Even with the bar fulling packed, she gave everyone equal attention that was second to none. This little touch of service goes beyond what you'll get at Toro and other Tapas place in Boston. \\n\\nNow to the food. We started off by putting in our order of Seafood and Chicken Paella since that took 20 minutes. The wait was worth it. It comes out with shrimps with their head intact. Chicken was very well season, squid was super tender, clams was on the small side but delicious. The other entree was a fish Special, Salmon Vizcaina, that they had for the night and my girlfriend loves it. \\n\\nOur first tapa plate was Gambas al Pil Pil (Shrimp in spicy garlic oil) and I could tell why this plate was the most popular. The shrimp was cooked to perfection and the spicy garlic oil was delicious. Make sure to dip the bread that comes with your meal into the spicy garlic oil. Next was the Scallop in spicy garlic oil, Zamburina Pil Pil. We thought it was the same sauce but it was not. Scallop was very tender and you get roughly 15-20 of them on the plate. The Croquetas de Jamon was nice. It's like a fried mac and cheese. Instead of pasta, it's fills with ham. Crispy all around and the cheese oozes out on every bite.\\n\\nTo finish off the evening we have the Natilla. It's like a flan but had cinnamon on the top and bottom. This was very very good and we highly recommend to get it if you have room for it. Lastly an expresso shot to go along with the Natilla. Try this combo and you're wondering why they don't make this a combo on the menu.\\n\\nOverall, the best tapas outside of Boston, better than Dalia in Somerville, I must say.

A little unique - tomatoes, artichokes, peppers, and other vegetables with a large piece of bread, goat cheese and mozzarella.  It was so tasty and will definitely be ordered again!  My boyfriend got the onion soup which was \\"eh\\" in his opinion but he considers himself an onion soup connoisseur.  \\n\\nAfter the appetizers we waited quite a bit again for the main course.  Both times that we were waiting the waitress came over, apologized profusely, and explained how it was a new chef (hence the different bruschetta) and offered to take items off the bill for our patience.

At first I thought that due to the large group, the server was going to bring out everyone's drinks around the same time, however, when the server brought out mimosas for the rest of the group (who had arrived and ordered at least 10 to 15 minutes after me), he didn't have mine, and I had to remind him not only what I had ordered, but that I had ordered something.  It was a bit annoying that I had to wait 20+ minutes for my mimosa, but not the end of the world.  However, my friends and I were not impressed when they mixed up orders, made mistakes on several of our bills, and were very slow with bill payments.\\n\\nDespite the poor service (maybe we caught them on an off day or if they are just bad with large groups), I would go there again for brunch, as the food was delicious.  I ordered the Grilled Shrimp California Benny and a raspberry mimosa as part of their \\"Brunch Bundle\\" for $20.

This spot can be found in a freshly developed area, with Poor Hendrix on the same corner and Greater Good BBQ across the street.\\n\\nYou order at the counter, fix your own fountain drink, and seat yourself. In addition to inside, there are some tables and chairs outside, both facing the street and in a little neighboring alley. Mix'd Up's tagline is \\"A Rockin' Experience,\\" and there's a music theme in the decor, with a Bob Marley piece and a metal guitar sculpture on the wall. Despite the gray industrial theme, the multiple glass windows let in some sunny cheer and brightness.\\n\\nThe name Mix'd Up had me thinking there would be some really wacky burgers. The craziest offering had crawfish on it! I liked how there were non-beef options too such as a lamb, black bean, turkey, and chorizo. I decided to go for simple and classic, getting the Mix'd Up burger ($7) which consisted of a 1/2 lb Angus beef patty, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, and onions. Instead of fries, I opted for a super salad (side $4.50, entree size $8). This salad included kale, spinach, a spring mix, pecans, strawberries, and feta. Out of five dressings, red wine vinegar was my final answer.\\n\\nThe burgers showed up relatively quickly. I liked the Mix'd Up burger which was cooked as specified and came on a hearty soft brioche-like bun. However, the raw onions were chopped into tiny bits which made it easy for said bits to fall out. I added a little ketchup to my burger. I only realized later that you could request special sauces to your burger for 50 cents more: a house recipe, honey mustard, and sriracha mayo. Wish a little more cheese had been slapped on but oh well.\\n\\nThe super salad was of a reasonable size, and the dressing was tart and herb-y, great. I do wish there were some more strawberries and pecans. Honestly, I don't think I realized pecans were in there. I had a few fingers of the buffalo fries ($5) and liked them.\\n\\nParking: There seemed to be a lot of street parking available, as well as a lot behind Mix'd Up. You can access the lot from Second Avenue, just south of the restaurant.\\n\\nService: Welcoming, laid-back, nice. The runner even brought us more water since we were sitting outside and melting.\\n\\nVerdict: Would definitely return to try out some other burgers.

Having driven by many times, we didn't expect much--even with the Jasper White parentage. The ugly large, brown building with spinning sign  (a former Polynesian tiki restaurant, we're told)  across from the Alewife T station didn't seem that  promising. And then there is that elongated, giant carved sea captain at the  entrance--wait, are we at the Crusty Crab, Sponge Bob? But it was them or Bertucci's across the street, so what the heck.\\n\\nWhat a great surprise! The inside is a huge homage devoted to summer-by-the-sea with steaming vats in the open kitchen, lots of colorful blackboards with specials of the day, a prominent \\"Oyster Bar\\" neon sign near the zinc-topped oyster bar itself, creative seating and a vibe of energy and fun. In other words, a seafood shack writ large--although this one comes with a sports bar, of course. (What restaurant doesn't have a sports bar these days?)\\n \\nAnd guess what? The man himself, Jasper White (JW stitched on his chef whites) was there to greet customers, keep a detailed eye on the operation, and even serve a dish and take away an empty plate back to the kitchen. I like a celebrity chef who is willing to get his hands dirty with the common folk; he obviously cares about the product.\\n\\nOh, the food? I had the signature pan roasted lobster, even though I'm not a big lobster fan. But this lobster was incredible -- see just about every review here -- thanks to the bourbon/butter/chives sauce the crustacean swims in over to your table. Messy and marvelous. At market price, the dish was $42, and well worth the expense.\\n\\nMy lovely wife had jerked mahi mahi, which she said was fine, but not great. But she loved the place as well and we will definitely come back.

The word \\"cafe\\" in the name implies a simple place, with sandwiches and salads, but it's actually a much fancier place. I ordered an $8 \\"salad\\"  (if it can even be called that) and it literally was just like 5 pieces of cubed tomatoes (heirloom and grape), a couple black olives, and a few slivers of spinach leaves. Literally. And no feta cheese, as it listed on the menu. I was aghast. The fact that that \\"salad\\" was listed in the entree portion of the menu made the whole thing very misleading. If my boyfriend had not offered to share his (small, entree) pizza with me, I would've starved. Even then, we were still very unsatisfied. Finished our whole meal in about 5 minutes. And I'm not a fast eater. \\n\\nDespite the very small portions for such hefty prices, the complimentary bread was tasty, and the staff was nice. I'm not trying to bash this place, but I need to reiterate how SMALL that $8 salad was. I'm a petite lady, and that salad would've been a snack for me, a small snack at that. If I cut up a small-medium sized apple and had peanut butter on the side, not only would that be more filling, but it would also be a much bigger portion. \\n\\nJust don't come here making the mistake we did.

Ample free parking (for the moment, til Austin wises up and sees the potential for increased revenue and installs parking meters outside). There also is VERY LITTLE overlap in the craft beer selections between one of my favorite watering holes and this one, so I don't feel guilty coming here because there's no real competition -- other than who gets my money on a particular evening -- as far as that goes.\\n\\nThe bad -- it's on the ground-floor of one of them noxious condo/mixed-purpose buildings that are taking over Austin like a cancer, and I'm pretty adverse to patronizing those places. But that's NOT a knock on the Hi Hat so much as the increasing reality of gentrified East Austin, and it's clearly something I've got to get over or risk missing hidden gems like this. It also appears to close awfully early for a bar, but that may be the location and clientele -- this isn't a shot bar, this isn't a drink and get hammered bar, this is a bar for folks who appreciate good craft beer.\\n\\nThe ugly -- there really is none once you are able to stomach the gentrification factor. The decor is nice -- no \\"out of the box\\" manufactured bar-type places you see a lot of these days, the presentation of the taps is beautiful (though one gripe -- with the rounded tap device they have, you can't see a couple of taps on the one side, and that's part of MY beer-choosing process). They share bathrooms out back with other building residents, so unless that area is well lit, that may be problematic for women after dark. That's no the bar's fault, that's whoever owns the building.\\n\\nThe bartenders last night were William (the resident tap master) and Zoe -- both were attentive and friendly, and helpful in pointing me to a couple of good selections. It was also Left Hand Brewing Co. glass night, which I didn't realise til I was about to leave, so I got a very cool Good JuJu glass for my troubles.\\n\\nI wasn't there for the food, but I did check out the menu, and it all looked appetizing. There was a good range of prices (I'll call the pricing \\"gourmet accessible\\"), with the cheese plate ($15), steamed mussels ($15) and ribeye ($18) being at the high end, and most everything else falling between $6-$9, decently-priced for your typical bar. Things were plated nicely, and the food certainly looked good, so I'll be going back specifically to test the food menu (which the Austin Beer Guide writer says is one of his favorites).\\n\\nThe beer selection was good and priced well by Austin bar standards -- most pours ran me between $5-$6. I'll say the menu board was confusing, and I would have preferred them break it down by type rather than brewery so I could explore more efficiently, but that's my general preference. If wine is your thing, they've got a good selection here.\\n\\nClientele was mixed -- some older, some younger, a bit more affluent than most of the bars I frequent, but I didn't feel TOO out of place and no one called me out for being too working class. Seating can be a problem, but I got to the bar early enough and scored a seat at the bar and didn't feel too crowded even as business picked up.\\n\\nI've seen a couple reviewers (and a patron last night) complain about the lack of table service, but most bars I frequent would laugh if you expected to NOT order at the bar. That's such a small and unexpected issue -- especially at a small square footage bar like this -- that I didn't even think about it til I read the complaints. I'm frankly more surprised when a bar DOES have table service.\\n\\nSince this bar for me is easier to get to than other bars I hit, and pretty much on my way home, I'm definitely going to be coming back here fairly regularly. I'm also very much interested in the events they'll be holding with area breweries, and the live jazz music they feature on Sundays may be enough reason to bring me back into Austin on a lazy Sunday afternoon."},{"name":"Pattycake Bakery","address":"3009 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"Best bakery I've been to in Columbus!

After work on Friday, July 25th, my co-workers and I met up for a drink and a meal at Baby A's. First it took the waiter Scotty P. an hour to take our order and that was after I asked a busboy to go and get him for us. We all ordered one drink (three frozen and one not), after starting to eat we all started feeling nauseous and none of us ordered another drink. Foolishly, none of us mentioned feeling queasy. One of my co-workers had to rush to the bathroom several times during the meal, but still didn't mention that she was feeling sick. It wasn't until Monday morning that we all saw each other at work and began talking about vomiting after returning home. All of us saying, \\"I thought it was just me.\\"\\nSo I called the restaurant and spoke to a female manager, she asked for my phone number and stated she would call me back about refunding my check for the food. I waited for two days and after not hearing back I went to the restaurant today.\\nI spoke to two female managers. After explaining what had happened, the district manager literally said, \\"What do you want me to do about it?\\" I said I expect you to refund my money. She stated that no one gets sick from food that quickly, that it takes four hours to get sick, and that she would not refund any money because no one else complained about the food that night. By the way here is the definition of how long it takes to get sick:\\n\\"How long food poisoning takes to set in depends on the type of food poisoning. Generally, symptoms can set in within two to six hours after food has been consumed. But sometimes symptoms can appear within a few days or a few minutes. \\" -American Medical Association\\nI honestly have rarely asked for my money back from a restaurant, but I felt terrible because I had recommended the restaurant.

Important tidbit, as these guys are regulars at the food pods and they are popular so they run out. This means, you can quick dash to their truck when you arrive, grab your dessert to go and be happy in the fact that as the event progresses and they are running low/out- your treats have been secured. The owners were dolls, so happy and enthusiastic, made sure we followed them on Twitter. I do!\\n\\nI like the size of these cupcakes, they are $2.50 and bigger than a mini, but smaller than the $3.75 size at other shops. You can eat one and not feel like a glutton. For $5 we walked away with our 2 cupcakes feeling good. Frosting to cupcake ratio was perfect, we were excited to bite in. After a pig out dinner, we had to wait to enjoy our treats...torture! \\n\\nRed Velvet: The cream cheese frosting was the best in town. Right balance of sweet and cream cheese...you can tell it's cream cheese, rich but not heavy. Big thumbs up. The Red Velvet cake....Ugh, so disappointed.  It was overdone, hard on the top of the cupcake, no give, dry in the center and the red cake was blotchy on the inside...there were spots that were brown, meaning the batter had not been mixed thoroughly or the dry ingredients hadn't been properly sifted before adding the wet ingredients. I'm not writing their Red Velvet cupcake off, but I was totally bummed and hubby agreed that the BBBS Red Velvet cupcake we split the day prior was superior, by far.\\n\\nThe Chocolate Peanut butter cupcake saved the day, though.

I can't pick a favorite of the burgers I've tried as they're all just fantastically delicious. The Rocky is simple and straightforward, but it is absolutely full of flavor. The Chef's special is amazing as well. Simply tell them what you don't like and they'll go to town outside of that. By and far away, the Chef's special is the best value. In fairness, they're all a good value for the kind of ingredients they're putting on many of their burgers. As much as some of their prices seem expensive, they don't rip you off in the size of the burger, the quality of the fries or tots and the ingredients themselves. The Rocky isn't expensive at all... $5 gets you a decent sized patty, onions, bacon and other goodness, and the fries are only $1 more (though I don't think they're charging anyone for them). 2 patties only goes up to $7 with the extra cheese and onions they add to it. \\n\\nBy and large, the fries and tots are the gold standard here. Perfectly golden brown and perfectly seasoned. The Crunch is amazing with this nice, soft center. The seasoning though... that's where the fries shine. I have no clue what it is about their seasoning, but it's amazing. \\n\\nThis place is 5 star and worth every penny for what you get. I haven't tried the shakes, but watching them make one helps me to understand why people love them. The drinks are a bit expensive, but that's the same everywhere, so I can't fault them for that.

We are always looking for a great fried chicken, we assumed that anything the owner of 4 Rivers makes will be the best. Sadly, we could not be more wrong. When we got our chicken, the cook was perfect and the juiciness was absolutely on point. What disappointed was the fact that it was so bland. We really were stunned. The coating had very little flavor and a minimal crunch. The sides, as always, are wonderful. I suppose it is that contrast between great sides, coupled with our high expectations against bland chicken that stunned us. On the drive back to Longwood, we listed the places whose chicken we think is more flavorful. They are: Popeyes, Bojangles, Publix, KFC.

It came with a spring roll which was probably the least-favorite spring roll I've ever had. Instead of a nice crunchy cornucopia of vegetables on the inside, this was filled mostly with a green substance that could have been seaweed or spinach or something... but it was gross and tasteless, at least to me. I think others might find it to be something they would like though, there was nothing wrong with how it was cooked or served. \\n\\nI liked the dragon sauce, their homemade take on sriracha. I'd say it's a must. \\n\\nI tried a pork taco which was a special, and found the shell and its contents exceptionally greasy.\\n\\nMaybe I'll be back.

It's pretty gross having to touch a wet bottle that everyone else has touched just to get some hot sauce. It's also not cold enough due to the fact that the ice melts fast so it's just soaking in water. While I was waiting for my food I watched a few people go to get salsa and you could tell they were grossed out too.

Each of them brought their signature uniqueness and character to the mix; they weren't too sweet, which for me personally was a welcome change from the sub-standard sugar filled American desserts. \\n\\nOne bite was all it took to realize Orlando's craze for the Yum Yum Cupcake Truck; a big round of applause for these indulgent creations.

For $45, two people can choose one of three prix fixe menus--one vegetarian, one pescatarian, and one omnivorous--of four dishes.  Also, desserts are discounted to $7 instead of the usual $8.  (Be still my heart!  Now I can afford half of a $2 fortune cookie!)\\n\\nFirst of all, I quickly noticed that the prix fixes are only about $2-5 cheaper than ordering each dish individually. This struck me as a little sleazy, especially since substitutions are forbidden, and CDN is only available on Mondays and Tuesdays.  The two of us decided that it would be better to just order what sounded best, and were able to select an equivalent combination of four dishes for only $43--an even cheaper date night!\\n\\nThe green papaya slaw ($6) was tasty and not something I'd had before.  I liked the crunchy peanuts on top!  The braised pork belly buns ($9) came with two to an order.  They were good, especially with the pickled jalape√±os thrown in, but I preferred the ones at Fugu (RIP).\\n\\nThe hot Szechuan dan dan noodles with pork ($12) were really flavorful, but a little greasy and heavy.  I wasn't expecting ground pork; it was kind of like a mushed up meatball instead of the hard little bits you usually get in mapo tofu and the like.  The addition of pickled mustard greens (and some other crunchy pickled vegetables?) was so creative and delicious.  However, I would probably try the cold dan dan noodles instead next time.\\n\\nThe jasmine tea smoked duck wraps ($16) were the worst part of the meal--skip them!  I'm a huge fan of tea-smoked duck, but this version just left me cold.  The pancakes were completely stale and tasted like tortillas dug out of a forgotten taco kit.  Also the duck was at a weird temperature; I'm not sure if it was meant to be lukewarm or just sat around for a little too long. The nam prik pao (Thai chili jam) was interesting and the pile of fresh herbs was nice, but the fact that I preferred the condiments to the actual dish says a lot.\\n\\nConsidering the dan dan noodles and papaya slaw were supposedly the \\"hotterest\\" things on the menu, I was expecting a little more heat.  I guess I should have ordered the dragon sauce for $1!\\n\\nI don't necessarily mind either slow or inattentive service, but the service here was both.  I know they were slammed, but I hate feeling like a restaurant forgot about me.  Dishes come out when they're ready so we waited a long time between courses.  Our waiter barely acknowledged us, which was just a little disconcerting since the menu and decor exude a welcoming vibe.\\n\\nWe also were seated in pretty much the worst table in the restaurant, all the way in the back corner right in front of the entrance to the kitchen.  They kept dousing and mopping the floor like two feet away from where we were eating, which was a bit gross.\\n\\nI loved the decor and the playfulness of the menu, but I think I'll go back across the turnpike to Chinatown the next time I'm craving dumplings and noodles!"},{"name":"N&P Saigon Subs","address":"1185 N Main St","city":"Randolph","stars":"4.5","text":"Food was fast, fresh and flavorful.

Yelped around, checked out websites, and decided upon on Punjab Palace.\\n\\nI wanted good Indian food and a nice setting.  Many of the Indian restaurants in Central Square have good food but are often empty and the decor can be rundown and depressing....\\n\\nPunjab Palace gets high marks for the setting.  Marble tables, clean, the flat screen TV with the entertaining Bollywood videos.  It was exactly what I was looking for.\\n\\nThe food was okay; some good, nothing spectacular.  The onion bhaji was good, the samosas were just okay - not fried to order and therefore a little lukewarm and doughy.  The nan got high marks - fresh and tasty.\\n\\nWe had chicken korma for one entree - there were too few cashews in it, and those that were had obviously been in the sauce a while - not crunchy at all.  The baingan bhartha was good, with the smoky eggplant taste one expects.  Can't really comment on the spice level - the ex doesn't like his Indian too spicy so I added some onion chutney to spice mine up, but that's no reflection on the restaurant.  The rice was well-made.\\n\\nSo will I go back again?  Sometime, sure.  Will I take my Indian friends when they come visit Boston?

The wrappers were light and the filling was tasty. I added some complimentary garlic paste to my ramen. And with the first bite, I was hooked. The noodles were done perfectly to my liking. The broth was deep with flavour and didn't feel too oily. With each bite of ramen, I was liking it more and more. You can have the option to add more noodles if you're not full (comes in half or full orders) but I was stuffed after my meal.

This was a reminder that the key to eating here it to try to taste all components of a dish together in each bite.  What I loved about the fish salad was the presentation of the rich green, finely sliced avocado exquisitely molded over the quenelle of fish salad.\\n \\nThe zucchini with apple and goat feta also had a beautiful presentation in the shape of a flower.  In this case the server was sure to instruct us that although very pretty, the flower was meant to be destroyed as we incorporated all ingredients of the dish together to eat.\\n\\nOyster mushrooms with rapini and steak sauce were rich and filling.  \\n\\nNothing about the description of the Shitake pasta prepared us for this dish.  The pasta was formed into rectangular capsules filled with broth and sealed.

I might add that by the time we were done dining, only four people had walked in to eat, so I'm not sure why it was such an unwelcome response, when there were obviously no other resos to accommodate during that time. Sorry folks, for me, dining is an all encompassing experience where service is a huge part of making or breaking a night out. \\nIt's unfortunate I'm giving 3 stars, due to our rough introduction to this establishment, because the food was absolutely 5 star quality. Another slip up that happened was the coursing.

I thought, it's about time I write a review and opened up my Yelp app. I am truly surprised to see this only has an overall 3 star review. I started looking at the reviews and noticed a few trends. The good reviews were made by people with lots of reviews of a lot of different restaurants. The bad reviews were mostly written by people who have not written many reviews. Kind of strange, not sure what that indicates. I typically only listen to reviews where the person has a lot of experience and also is not one tune singer i.e. All 5 stars or all 1 and two stars. \\n\\nI also will never judge a restaurant on one good day or one bad day. I will eat at a restaurant at least twice, but usually more than that before assessing the quality of food and dining experience. Once in a while, if it's just not my type of place, I will give it a review after one meal. Those will typically be burger joints or sports bars since I just don't like them. \\n\\nI love French food, formal service, small portions, not too many carbs (but can always go for crispy crust French bread with unsalted butter).  I really love the food at Chez Vincent. I would not be fat if I lived nearby instead of living in Michigan eating in restaurants with mostly mediocre food with unhealthy portions that I finish out of boredom. When a restaurant here is moderately good I give it 5 stars because everything is relative. Chez Vincent is also cheap compared to Reataurants in Ann Arbor.

Not the case here. \\nThe wine list was very reasonable and we had an amazing Malbec. For the starter, 3 of us had the chicken enchiladas. The portion was enormous. Seriously, after eating the warm bread and the 2 chicken enchilada appetizer, I had no business eating anything else (but that didn't stop me).

All of my worry was for naught though since my group was the only group there.  I think as long as you show up before 6:30 you probably won't have to deal with a wait.  One advantage of showing up early however was getting a prime seat at the bar right beside the open kitchen.  It is awesome to be able to watch the highly skilled guys at work in their kitchen.  Warning though, it is a lot hotter seat than at one of their tables since you have their stove billowing out heat the whole meal.\\n\\nFor an appetizer they start you off with olives with the pit that were quite good.  I am not normally a fan of olives but I did like the taste and consistency of the ones they serve.  In fact, the theme of the night would be Barley Swine introducing tastes that I never thought I would previously have liked.\\n\\nNext up were the fried brussel sprouts with lemon and these are amazing!  I have never liked brussel sprouts but these were so good I ordered two servings of them.  Definitely one of my favorite dishes they serve.  They come out with a delicious crispy outside.  The potato fritters were likewise excellent, with a hard crunchy shell hiding the inside that mushed in all of the right ways.\\n\\nI thought both of their salad type dishes were just OK, nothing special.  The roasted beets with fennel as well as the grilled carrot salad.  Of the two the grilled carrot salad was definitely better.\\n\\nThe fish and potato pasta with egg and apple followed and it was delicious.  Really thick chewy consistency and the egg and apple were an unexpected way to highlight the dish.\\n\\nAdding the vanilla to the scallop dish creates an outstanding combo.  The texture of the cooked scallop was great and the vanilla and other ingredients made it burst with flavor.\\n\\nThe pig trotter dish was another one where Barley Swine changed my mind's thinking on a food.  The thin mushrooms, an item I typically cannot eat, were fabulous and mixed with the egg and pig trotter again produced a stand out item.\\n\\nThe next three dishes I would group together were their super rich speciality meat dishes, sweetbreads, pork belly, and foie gras.  Both the foie gras and sweetbreads turned out to be disappointing for me.  For the foie gras I feel like maybe it was a combination of how it was grilled and the other ingredients but it wasn't worth the price you will pay.  The sweetbreads were good but again not outstanding like many of the other dishes here.  The pork belly is a dish done frequently now, and it was melt in your mouth fatty.  It was good but not as unique as many of the other dishes so I probably would not order it again even though it had excellent flavor.\\n\\nAnother average dish was the bacon wrapped rabbit.  It was good but I didn't find anything crazy about the dish.  For sure none of the dishes were bad, they were all tasty but when I go to a restaurant of this kind of calibre I am also expecting a wow factor when I taste the food.\\n\\nThe meal was closed by two very strong dishes however.  The stuffed quail dish was awesome.  Great texture in the meat and the other ingredients were paired well.  The braised short rib with bone marrow was another personal favorite.  It was deliciously moist and really stood out among the other meat dishes.\\n\\nFor people new to the restaurant my top recommended dishes would be the fried brussel sprouts, scallop, and pig trotter.\\n\\nFor desert the coffee porter float with pecan ice cream is simple but works beautifully.  There are huge thick pecans in the ice cream but as it melts it mixes so well with the beer.\\n\\nThey also fixed us some sort of off the menu dessert which had a cake type consistency with apples and almond nougatine on top.  I have read it is served with brown butter ice cream now but it wasn't part of the dish when I had it.  While good, it wasn't quite special enough for me to order this dish again.

Only one of us had ever been here but I'd read the reviews and we were all STARVING.\\n\\nGot there a little after 1 and the place was jam packed but the wait was only 20 mins and I think we waited less than that to be honest but since we were standing around chatting I didn't even notice.\\n\\nWe were discussing the menu and I mentioned how often the reviews mentioned the Zuni Roll so 3 of us got it. The Zuni Roll was amazing, the 3 of us agreed.  It was delicious and in such an unexpected way.  I would never pick those flavors to go together but they worked so well. Another girl \\"The Parish Pasta\\" and the 5th got \\"The Benny\\" sandwich. \\n\\nThe food was expensive but plentiful and very good.  It ended up being about $16 a person including tip for just the entrees, no apps or drinks (just water.)\\n\\nOur waitress was very nice and efficient.  She was training someone that day.  She was attentive but not overly clingy.  We recieved our food in a timely manner.  We were next to the kitchen and it went from kitchen to our table in a flash.\\n\\nI also really appreciated how good she was when it came time to pay.  We of course all either had only a card or a $20 bill so we had to give her pretty specific instructions on what to do and she did it no problem.  Didn't even flinch.  And we had to grab someone to break a $10 for us and that girl did it no problem either.\\n\\nAll in all, I really enjoyed The Parish Cafe and would definitely return.\\n\\nOh and I'm still full. :)"},{"name":"Twist Frozen Yogurt  Lounge","address":"7535 SW Barnes Rd","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Unbelievably expensive, especially the shakes.  The price for a medium size shake (the only size they have) has gone from $4.00 to $5.00 to $6.00 in a matter of a few months.  Even plain yogurt shakes with no additions are $6.00.  When I asked why the price increase, the cashier rudely told me that she didn't know, she said the $5.00 button on the cash register had just disappeared so now all shakes are $6.00. My advice is to go to the grocery store and buy our own yogurt to enjoy.  There is a staggering high markup on the frozen yogurt at this place!"},{"name":"Thai Orchid Restaurant","address":"1143 Austin Avenue","city":"Coquitlam","stars":"4","text":"Great little gem.

There are tons of fun authentic sculptures and artifacts, and even the wood used in the stairs to the upper level of the restaurant comes from Southeast Asia. There are always so many lovely details in the themeing of Disney restaurants that really sets them apart, and Yak & Yeti is no exception.\\n\\nThe menu is definitely pan-Asian, ranging from Chinese to Indian and beyond. The prices are fairly high for the type of food, but that is to be expected at a Disney park.\\n\\nMy sister and I started out with two appetizers, which we split. First, the Thai Chili Chicken Wings featuring a sweet Thai chili sauce and spicy Asian pickled cucumbers. As a chicken wing lover through and through, I am happy to report that these wings definitely hit the spot. The skin is not soggy, and the sauce is tasty, two key components to a good chicken wing. Enough said.\\n\\nWe also split the Dim Sum Basket for Two, which includes pork pot stickers (technically, although they are advertised as pot stickers, they are not since they are steamed and not pan-fried, but I digress), shrimp siu mai, pork siu mai, and char siu bao, along with a soy-lime dipping sauce.\\n\\nAs a self-proclaimed dim sum aficionado, I must say these are by far not the best dumplings I've ever had. They clearly use store-bought and not homemade wrappers, and the char siu bao dough is actually quite dense--not fluffy as it should be. With that said, this is not Chinatown, but rather a Disney theme park. I think these dumplings are forgivable, and actually quite good considering they are not the highlight of the menu. I love the presentation and the variety that is offered.\\n\\nAt this point, a food runner approached us with our next course of dishes before we had barely taken a few bites of our appetizers. This is perhaps my only complaint--the timing of the meal. We asked that they return the other plates to the kitchen and bring them out later (there wasn't even any room on our table). They put them under the heat lamp in the kitchen, but didn't re-fire them.\\n\\nWhen the time came for the main event, our server brought the food back out and asked us if we wanted them re-fired, or if the food was still hot enough. Honestly, I feel they should have taken the initiative in the first place to re-fire the dishes. Once they are on the table and we are ready to finish our meal, I'm not going to ask to send it back and wait even longer to proceed with the meal, unless the food is ice cold. With that said, we were content with the temperature of the following dishes.\\n\\nWe continued with the theme of \\"sharing is caring\\" and split the Crispy Honey Chicken and a side of Garlic Noodles. The chicken is lightly battered in tempura and fried, then tossed in a sticky sweet honey sauce and served with broccoli and carrots, and a choice of jasmine or brown rice. I genuinely feel that it is overpriced for the serving size and quality of the food, but again, you're at Disney. It is what it is.\\n\\nA side of Garlic Noodles was very delicately seasoned, but still hit the spot for these two carb lovers. It definitely helped round out the meal and fill our bellies, and there was plenty of extra noodles to go around, so we actually got most of it wrapped up to go (we reheated them the next morning for breakfast!).\\n\\nAll in all, I was quite pleased with my experience at Yak & Yeti. It was not the best Disney meal I've had, and given a choice in the future, I'd prefer the price and quality of a meal at Flame Tree Barbecue. I'm still really glad I tried Yak & Yeti. It was definitely a popular spot, and the dining room was full by the time we left the restaurant after our relatively early lunchtime reservation. If you're looking for a sit-down restaurant at Animal Kingdom, Yak & Yeti is a solid choice. \\n\\nI'd give it 3 1/2 to 4 stars, with the poor timing of our entrees as my main complaint."},{"name":"Prosperity Pie Shoppe","address":"7814 SW Capitol Hwy","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"My sister and I came to Portland on vacation and stumbled upon this place.

Also, because the door kept opening and the restaurant is tiny, the whole place was incredibly drafty. We got there before they opened at 5:30 which was good because we never would have been seated otherwise - until maybe 9 pm, since it takes them forever to turn over tables and they DON'T take reservations. Also, it took 20 minutes for my cousin to get her mojito and 15 minutes for me to get a diet coke. The bar was just overwhelmed, probably with people waiting for tables.

This is a recipe for success for restaurants in Austin. \\n\\nIve been twice and the lines were extremely long. I figured if the lines are always this long (which they seem to be as people are always wrapped around the side of the building) then it must be good. As you wait in line they have employees come around with drink menus and you can order an adult beverage before being seated. Also once inside you walk by a bar which you can order drinks here as well.\\n\\nOnce we finally got to the counter (at least 45 minute wait) we decided to order burgers of course. I ordered a classic cheeseburger while my wife ordered a burger with mushrooms and cheese. We also ordered the fries with olive aioli dipping sauce. Lastly we ordered the white chocolate raspberry milk shake (holy crap this thing was good and the highlight of our visit). We were given a table number so we went and sat down waiting for our burgers.\\n\\nThey knocked out the food relatively quickly in which we only waited 10-15 minutes in a packed house.  The burgers were cooked well but were noticeably gamey. It seemed as if the meat was not properly seasoned and this turned me off a bit. I quickly switched my attention to the fries with olive aioli dipping sauce. Blahhh the dipping sauce was not very appetizing and I typically like olives. They also put some sort of seasoning on the fries that just seem like overkill. Ill take my normal ketchup on fries over this sauce any day.\\n\\nlastly after seeing my wife drink her milkshake without much pleasure I decided to have a go. I asked for a sip and was blown away. This quite possibly could have been the best milkshake I have ever had. It was creamy and delicious and had a very deep flavor.\\n\\nOverall I was dissapointed with Hop Doddys. I think they play into the Austin scene well and have a very prime location on South Congress. I will not be recommending them to my friends except if they want to wait an hour to get this wonderful milk shake."},{"name":"bartaco","address":"969 Marietta St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Layout and design is awesome, tacos were great!\\n\\nFew things to know though so you don't feel dumb...there is a dragonfly card, put that on the sign post at your table if you need help\\n\\nThis is a fill out the card and order type restaurant, sushi restaurant style.

Yesterday was the clincher, though. \\n\\nThe server was very nice and agreeable when I asked to sit outside and told her that I was on lunch break and had been forgotten out there before. She was prompt and cheerful.\\n\\nShe brought my chips, salsa, and salsa bowl. The salsa bowl had not been washed sufficiently. Evidently it had contained queso before, as there was dried cheese on the bottom. I asked for another bowl, which she brought right away.\\n\\nThe clincher was that when I poured salsa into my bowl, bits of soggy tortilla came out with it. It happened to another customer, too. I told my server and she said she'd tell the manager.\\n\\nThe speedy gonzales (taco, enchilada, beans) was what I'd come to expect - I was only there because they have a nice outside seating area - except the beans were watery. \\n\\nOn the way out, I decided it would be best if I mentioned the tortilla-in-the-salsa incident to the manager and I asked a man at the front desk if I could speak to the manager. He said the manager would be back in 15 minutes. I had to go to work, so I left and then phoned when I got a chance, about an hour and a half later. I asked for a manager and was told that he was on vacation. I thought someone might be making up a story, so I called again after 10 minutes and asked for a manager and was told \\"There's no manager here.\\" I asked for the assistant manager and was told, \\"He'll be in at 5.\\" I had to get back to work and haven't followed up again today, as they're not open yet. \\n\\nBut there ya go. I hate that I felt like I had no option but to review on Yelp just because there's some sort of absentee manager I can't talk to. I'm not hard to get along with, really! If someone other than the server had even cared, I would have said nothing.\\n\\nEDITED TO ADD: I stopped in personally the following day, at around 3 PM. I asked to talk to the manager and was told that *she* (I was mistaken when I heard \\"he\\") was on vacation but this employee (assistant manager, maybe? Dumb of me not to ask) asked if he could help. I recounted my experience from yesterday. He said that he couldn't do anything with the manager on vacation. He said, \\"I'm sorry,\\" and that was it. It didn't sound too sincere, in my opinion. It was *then* that I got testy and said, \\"Well, we know you reuse your salsa.'  I don't want free food (I'm not going back, anyway); I just thought it would be wise to let them know about the incident. I don't think the young man was either surprised or sorry. ...... so there ya go.

I appreciate their enthusiasm to get the food out quickly, but it became quite distracting. Well the food was just as lame, we ordered the veggie arepa, tequenos - which tasted like fried cheese hush puppies and datiles, bacon wrapped dates. We also ordered the tuna (which was quite an odd taste with a sweet cinnamon flavor), chicken (too small) and meat. Unfortunately, my friend was so disgusted with the meat, which was served cold, he sent it back and didn't want to try anything else. And my friend with the chicken said it was OK, but was done before my friend sent the meat back. I gave him the rest of my cinnamon tuna.

The wine was brought to the table and then our appetizers were put in front of us. She didn't describe the dish or tell us anything about it, yet other tables received this. The bread came after the appetizers.

Since we had never been there before we didn't know to call ahead and make reservations. We arrived around 7 thinking that it wouldn't be too busy on a Sunday and boy were we wrong.\\n\\nFirst it was freezing that night in Austin and parking was really tough to find but we finally found something random on the street. We were told by the hostess our wait would be about 30 minutes and we waited almost an hour. \\n\\nOne thing I did like about the experience was the decor of the restaurant. They have comfy couches to sit and wait on and benches and the bar area is nice and cozy.\\n\\nWhen we were finally seated at almost 8pm we waited forever (while a waitress filled our water glasses and took my napkin for some reason) for our waiter to even come take our drink or appetizer order. He looked rather flustered and it seemed that the two waiters in the area we ate in (a room to the side behind the bar) had way too many tables between them (they both looked put-out). Finally we ordered our drinks, then some veggie samosas. It took almost 15 minutes before he brought our iced tea and he told us our samosas would be out soon. We were both pretty hungry and getting a bit frustrated ourselves (while still smiling). The samosas were not as good as ones i have had at other more authentic indian restaurants. They were not very spicy. (I don't know why contemporary restaurants are afraid to season their food). The dough of the samosa was also not very crispy, although it was light.\\n\\nWe ordered the curried shrimp dish to split between us and some regular naan. I have had naan all over the country and their naan was decent. It again was lacking in flavor (it didn't taste like it had oil or anything on it which even regular naan seems to have something on it to give it some flavor). Our shrimp dish (we ordered the medium level of hotness) was NOT FLAVORED enough. It was nice and hot and beautiful to look at but the sauce was very bland, especially for being Medium in heat. Also the veggies and shrimp were swimming in the sauce. I am in culinary school right now and we are taught to balance out the servings of a dish and have everything be proportionate. There was plenty of sauce to go with all the rice but not enough veggies and shrimp to go along with it all. Also the veggies, especially the potatoes, were very bland and not seasoned at all.\\n\\nI really had high hopes after all the good reviews i had read about the Clay Pit but after this experience I will not be returning.

Al pastor, I only recently learned, is not yet another result of Arabic influence on Mexican cuisine by way of Spain, but came about centuries later with Arab immigration directly to Mexico. I first discovered this style of pork when I'd stop by construction sites back home in search of food trucks for lunch. Over the years, I came to always expect the meat to be prepared in a certain way: pork with a red chile rub, roasted on a spit, served with chunks of pineapple.\\nSeeking the dish in Atlanta, however, has led to much disappointment. Most places I've tried, the meat was not grilled in this way, and pineapple was usually absent.\\n\\nThen I learned that this small restaurant I've passed and considered trying so many times makes their al pastor in a more authentic manner. I didn't spend too long with the menu, and went straight for the tacos, ordering one with carnitas, one with lengua, and then one al pastor. The cashier asked if I wanted cheese on my taco al pastor and I was all, \\"Queeeee?\\" Cheese on tacos al pastor? No thanks... And then she asked if I wanted pineapple. Um... Does a Speedo-clad Carlos Slim swim laps in his safe full of money like Scrooge McDuck? Of course!\\n\\nI noticed the aguas frescas splishing and splashing in transparent tanks beside the register and asked the cashier whether the horchata was homemade or from one of those powder mixes. She didn't understand at first, and my Spanish is certainly worse than her English, so I just asked to taste it and she handed me a sample. No, it wasn't made from scratch, but it tasted better than most so I ordered a cup. It was little more than sweet water - no cinnamon or rice flavor to it. For $1.75, I got a 16 oz. cup of synthetic horchata (compare this to the 32 oz. cup of homemade stuff from other places for around $2). I didn't think to ask whether they offer free refills.\\n\\nAs I awaited my meal, watching short, fat, old trolls molesting an endless parade of women of ridiculous proportions on Univision, I noticed that the guy calling out orders by number over the intercom would do so in Spanish for most orders, but a couple he announced in English. I later noticed on my receipt that I had received (at no additional charge!) one \\"English\\". Amusing, but clever, as well. However, I also realized then that it had cost an additional 25 cents to add pineapple to my taco al pastor. No me gusta.\\n\\nMy order was ready within 5 or 6 minutes, and I grabbed it and headed to the salsa/condiment bar to add a little spice. I really need to have someone sit down with me some day and teach me about different Mexican sauces, because I should learn their names, at least. I really like the spicy orange sauce, which was great on the tongue taco, along with a bit of pico de gallo. They had a chili oil, and I added a bit of that to the carnitas.\\n\\nThe corn tortillas here leave much to be desired. They're dry and chewy. If you've ever popped leftover nachos into the microwave out of desperation, and then regretted that decision instantly upon first bite, then you know what to expect from these tortillas.\\n\\nThey are not stingy with the meat, though. Each taco was filled with about as much as it could handle without becoming a mess. The lengua was good. Nothing setting it apart from that of any other restaurant. The carnitas were only OK.\\nBut taking about a third of the taco al pastor in the first bite, I was met with an unexpected flavor.\\nCheese. I should've seen it when I snapped a photo of my meal. Despite saying \\"No cheese,\\" I was given melted queso on my taco. I'm a cheese-addict, but queso on tacos al pastor makes me muy triste... Then again, maybe that's why this place so loco. I finished the taco without protest. Without the cheese, the tacos al pastor from Las Tortas Locas would be decent. I've had much better in other cities, but this might be the best I've had so far in Atlanta.\\n\\nPotential for return trip to try other offerings: moderate (I'm a torta entusiast).\\nThere's additional parking in the back, as well as a rear entrance.\\n\\nOverall, 4/10."},{"name":"Mojo Pizza N' Pub","address":"657 E Lake Dr","city":"Decatur","stars":"3","text":"Awesome staff, great new bar, tons of ingredients and toppings and great slices.

Several minutes later we got a new waiter and were able to order at happy hour prices from the bar.\\n\\nWe ordered some non happy hour stuff like pork buns ($7) and a caterpillar roll ($10) which were both pretty good. The happy hour stuff not as much. However, there was some decent options like the lobster dumplings ($5 for 3 on happy hour is still a little pricey) and the Green Phoenix (early the best deal on the happy hour menu, tons of fish for $5).\\n\\nThe Alaska roll was also surprisingly good ($4 at happy hour).\\n\\nThe other maki rolls on happy hour were just ok and were fairly priced at $4 but not an amazing deal considering the quality. The seared scallops were $5 for 3 at happy hour which had me expecting giant scallops, like the 16-per-lb size. Instead they were about an inch wide and I think were cut in half. Not worth the $5 happy hour price and definitely not worth the full menu price.\\n\\nOverall, most of the food was just ok. With the happy hour prices it seemed reasonable but I would have felt pretty bad if I paid full price for most of the things we ate.\\n\\nIf I come back it will be to try the noodles because there are simply too many better places to eat sushi Austin and the people eating noodles around us had much more appetizing food.

The potatoes Truva were really tasty, and I found myself trying to figure out what they were made with so that I could hopefully replicate the recipe.  Unfortunately, I don't remember what the meals were that we got, but it was all tasty.  The only problem I had was that the spinach was a little over-salty.  I pointed this out to management, and the owner came over to discuss it with me.

It was juicy and the dipping sauce paired perfectly to pull all the flavors together.\\n\\nI have searched Portland for truly spicy ramen and had been disappointed up until my visit with Ramen Ryoma. I chose the shio broth, which is described as a saltier broth since I enjoy eating saltier. They also offer miso (soybean based) and shoyu (soy based) broths as well. Overall, they're not kidding about it being spicy. There's definitely a KICK in the Killer Spicy Ramen. I eat really spicy; abnormally spicy. So to me, this broth was fine. I would recommend ordering the regular spicy to enjoy the soup more. I look for broths to keep flavor when making it spicy, their broth did just that. I plan to try the shoyu base next time, I feel like it could bring out better flavor (my husband ordered shoyu). What I enjoyed most outside of flavor was the portion! I feel like most places skimp on veggies and meat, Ramen Ryoma did not.

I went with a group of 8 this past Sunday hoping for a nice, family style dinner, and while we were not completely disappointed, our meal left quite a bit to be desired. First of all, dishes at Myers + Chang are far too small to share for a group of that size. We wanted to try as many options on the menu as possible, but we had to order duplicates of some dishes to make sure everyone got a taste. We were all pretty full by the end of our meal, but members of our party (myself included) couldn't help but feel like we could have gotten just as good a meal in Chinatown and been stuffed for a fraction of the price.\\n\\nNow for a rundown of our dishes.\\n\\nTier 1 ----- The dishes that made us ooh and aah.\\n\\n* Mama Chang's Pork and Chive Dumplings: Some of the best I've ever had. A little pricy ($11) for the portion (5 small dumplings), but well worth it.\\n\\n* Braised Pork Belly Buns: Such an odd textural experience, but one that I enjoyed immensely. The hoisin and pickle flavors meshed really well with the doughiness of the bao. I had about three bites total, but each one was heavenly.\\n\\n* Dan Dan Noodles: Like cold, liquidy pad thai, and I mean that in the best way possible.\\n\\n*Wok Charred Udon Noodles: Yummy with a capital YUM. We actually got a tofu version of this dish for the one vegetarian in our group, and it was some of the best tofu I've ever had. For smaller parties, this dish gives one of the best bangs for your buck.\\n\\nTier 2 ----- The dishes that made us go meh.\\n\\n* Scallion Pancakes/Spring Rolls: Both pretty standard.\\n\\n* Asian-Braised Soft Tacos: What exactly \\"Asian-braised\\" means, I'm not sure, but it sure didn't impress anyone. They kinda tasted like a less satisfying version of the pork buns.\\n\\n* Chicken and Waffles: We had to try this dish simply because people at the table couldn't imagine how chicken and waffles go together. The chicken was crispy, albeit a little dry, but the waffle was limp and rather flavorless. It did come with a lovely sweet sauce, however.\\n\\n* Garlicky Spicy Coal-Black Wings: We got the homemade sriracha on the side, making the spice-lovers among us happy, but it overshadowed the chicken, which was just ok.\\n\\nTier 3 ----- Don't bother.\\n\\n* Lemony Shrimp Dumplings: A major disappointment after Mama Chang's. Luckily this was the only dish that fell into Tier 3 territory.\\n\\nBonus ----- Just because.\\n\\n* It was Sunday, so we figured we might as well try some of the $1 oysters. They seemed fresh enough (I can't remember what kind they were), but you can't really credit a restaurant for that. I did, however, enjoy the house's mint mignonette.\\n\\nIf I were to go back to Myers + Chang, I'd be sure to take a smaller group. My friends and I were seated around this long, rectangular table (the only table they had for large parties) that made passing dishes difficult and interacting with everyone nearly impossible. I would imagine that service is better for smaller parties as well. Our waiter was frequently MIA throughout the night, and I am guessing his automatic 18% gratuity was to blame."},{"name":"Barcelona Wine Bar South End","address":"525 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"The drinks were watered down even though the concept was pretty good especially the  cherry cobbler which had fresh fruits like BlackBerries and pomegranates.

First of all, it's worth mentioning there were 9 of us from our 3 families, and we have independent tastes and opinions. But not this time; there was unanimity with our reactions. To start at the beginning...\\n\\nWe wanted to go to Blue Water Caf√© where we've visited often and never had a bad meal, but they were unable to accommodate us, so I was tasked with finding a suitable substitute that specializes in seafood. Having been told in the past that Trip Advisor's reviews are unreliable because many are posted by shills, I cross-referenced theirs with Urban Spoon and Yelp in the hope it would add credibility. Coast was highly-rated by all three websites, so I booked us at there at 7:15 on a Tuesday night. Upon arriving we were relieved to see the restaurant was only half-full, and looked forward to an enjoyable dining experience. How wrong we were.\\n\\nAfter ordering our meals, we waited for what seemed like a long time, and eventually one of us mentioned that to our server. At first she thought it hadn't been that long, but after double-checking she realized it had been an hour since she'd submitted our order, and she apologized for the delay. We explained that my mom (who's 82) was fading, and asked for her meal to be brought out first ASAP - she'd had ordered the Sablefish special with the Miso sauce. The good news is it came out shortly after we complained about the long wait. The bad news is it was mushy and unimpressive. It got sent back.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the rest of us were still waiting for our appetizers which finally arrived after mom's unpalatable Sablefish, approx. 75 minutes after we'd ordered. They consisted of assorted sushi rolls and salads, and were average at best. When our entrees finally arrived (at least 90 minutes after we'd ordered our meals), most of us were disappointed, and at least three of us barely ate them even though we were starving by this point.\\n  \\nIt's worth noting that our server did a pretty good job of addressing our comments, although it took one of us to bring the hour delay to her attention. It should have been her responsibility to be aware of timing instead of us having to complain after receiving no food for an hour, not even bread - apparently you have to buy the bread at Coast. After she was made aware of the problem, someone in a higher position should have come to our table to inquire and attend to us immediately. That didn't happen for at least another 15 minutes from the time we complained. \\n\\nA man, I assume a manager, came to our table, and his manner was somewhat cordial, yet bordered on aloof, as if the visit to our table was an unwelcome obligation, rather than an opportunity to make things right.  Shortly after his visit, a woman, possibly an asst. manager, was dispatched to our table, and she tried to make amends by offering an extra bottle of wine and an assortment of free desserts. We told her we didn't want more wine or desserts - frankly, by that time we just wanted to get the hell out of there - but she insisted and wouldn't take no for an answer, so we accepted the desserts, which by the way were fine.\\n\\nShe also suggested we let her know how many of us didn't like our meals, and that they would deduct those from the bill. That sounds reasonable, but in our experiences, high end restaurants don't delegate that responsibility to the customer; they take charge of the situation themselves, usually offering to tear up the bill, or cut it by 50%, etc. \\n\\nTo make a long story short, by the server's own admission, there was no excuse for the inordinate length of time it took to get our meals - she grudgingly admitted that in the 1-1/2 years she'd been working there she'd never seen this kind of overall dysfunction, and blamed it on the chef was having an off night. \\n\\nBottom line: Some of food was disappointing, the rest was average, and the management's professionalism was sorely lacking. \\n\\nI would not recommend this restaurant to anyone, that is, unless they're masochistic and enjoy paying top dollar for sub-par food in an establishment where the management barely conceal the idea they're doing you a favour by letting you eat there."},{"name":"Champions","address":"110 Huntington Avenue","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Nothing fancy but clean, good atmosphere, large portions at decent prices.

The meat is the highest quality I've had outside of a true fine-dining establishment (and yes, I have consciously and unrepentantly ordered a burger more than once at a fine dining establishment). Juicy, medium, lovely. \\nThe smell of the buns baking while you stand in line is heavenly.\\nTheir fries are just about perfect. I could do without the herbal additions, but their homemade chipotle ketchup is awesome, so I'll deal. \\nI simultaneously love at hate the line system. On the one hand, you are guaranteed a table. NOTHING infuriates me more than standing in line for 15 minutes, ordering, paying, then not being able to find a place to sit then ending up standing around for a half hour while my food gets cold. So kudos to devising a system that eliminates this issue.The line tends to move pretty quickly, too.\\nHowever, I have more than once found myself making my way to the front of the line, ready to order, when I'm told a group of 8 behind me gets to order first because there's already a large table available. Annoying. Not sure what can be done about that other than institute a strict first come, first served policy.\\nOh, and when you do get your food, there's table service.

I was shocked to learn that this portly, unkempt man was actually the manager/proprietor of the joint.  Our Rigatoni Arrabiatta was comically oversalted and the Bruschetta that started the meal could have been made by my 5 year old nephew, as it was tomato sauce and fake cheese sloughed onto a chewy wonder bread.

The guy taking the order (Oh, btw, you have to order at the bar) told me that some people don't like them because they taste too earthy. I have never understood how people cannot enjoy eating beets. The highlight of the entree was supposed to be the portobello mushroom burger served on a bed of creams with some guacamole and aioli but the side of beets totally took the center stage. The vinaigerette they were sitting in when mixed with the cheese totally elevated the dish and give it so much dimension once you really mix it in together. You really want to take pictures and tell your food that this one is for the gram. I'll let the photos speak for themselves\\n\\nThe bad: Portions are a little bit on the smaller side but that could possibly be because we have huge portions in Houston.

It's in a central location, has a casual, appropriately ethnic ambiance, and the many servers are quick and hospitable. They have an affordable lunch buffet with a solid spread, and dinner options are of usual pricing (about 12 bucks each) and are each served on cute candle-lit dish warmers.\\n\\nThere are a few negatives however, that make Bukhara only so-so in my book:\\n1. The tastes are only okay - Tonight, my friend and I ordered chicken tikka masala and vegetable korma. Even with \\"medium\\" spiciness, the curry lacked kick, and were significantly blander than I expected.The korma was also too sweet for my taste.\\n2. Where is my mint chutney?? - Typically, there would be containers of chutney, but for some reason, Bukhara only served two: tamarind chutney and onion relish. My favorite, mint-corriander chutney, was not there. Luckily, the servers were kind enough to give me a ramekin-full when I asked for it, but seriously? I shouldn't have to ask.\\n3. Withholding on the naan - One order = one large piece. Luckily, my friend and I were sharing everything, so it wasn't a problem, but since two pieces seem to be the standard, I thought this was a really modest serving.\\n\\nBottom line, Bukhara's just okay. I'll come here if I'm brought by someone else, or if I'm incentivized with a coupon. Otherwise, I'll probably choose one of the many other establishments in the area."},{"name":"The Yum Yum Cupcake Truck","address":"","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Maple Bacon Cupcake. WOW!!

To say I was excited would be an understatement. I made reservations about a month prior. We checked in early and the hostess kindly accommodated us within a few minutes. Dinner began nicely, we ordered drinks and a couple apps. Right before our apps arrive we place our dinner order. Apps-Dumplings and Spring Rolls. The pork and chive dumplings are crave-ably crisp, yet tender and the filing full of flavor. Spring rolls were good but don't stand out. And this is where the dinner takes a dive with service. Our waiter is seated a two top. Both professional about 30yr old males. My table is my son and I. My son is a teenager. 15 mins later another two top is seated young professional couple. My table has now been ignored for about 30mins. Our apps have come and gone and no check in by our waiter. Our dinners arrive staggered, smoked mushroom lo mein and surf n' turf black pepper noodles. The lo mein is a great vegetarian choice. Full of firm but tender mushrooms and Napa cabbage. Flavorful sauce and toothy noodles. The noodles aren't too spicy. Peppery without the heat. Tender cuts of beef strips and both small and medium sized shrimp. Just before our dinners are served our waiter gets another table a 4 top-older professional males. My son who had ordered a coke has been empty since midway through the apps. Thank goodness for the carafe of water that is always on the table!!! We are finally checked on before our second entree is served and I order a cocktail. We finish our dinner. No cocktail. We wait and wait and wait. We wait and yes I timed it from the time we finish our meal to the time our waiter comes back is 27mins. Our plates were finally cleared at the 17min mark. I noticed that the waiter glances over and realizes he never ordered my drink from the bar. He finally brings it and asks if we'd like dessert, to which I say will it take an hr to get it like it took my drink? He says haha no, I'll take the drink off. But doesn't apologize and yes I appreciate the free drink but I'd have appreciated an apology more! We ordered dessert only because my son had read and wanted the Chocolate Affogato. I'm glad we did because he said it was one of the best chocolate desserts he's had in a long time. My coconut creme pie had too much whipped cream to coconut filling, but was still silky and delicious.  Now the whole time we were being ignored the tables surrounding us are being attended to, drinks are refilled, tables are cleared. New plates are brought and not just attended to by the waiter but by other service staff. And yet it's like my son and I are invisible. So finally the check arrives and to top it off every table around us is getting their check at the same time and each is served a meringue with their check and we of course aren't. I guess you could say we ordered dessert and they didn't so we didn't but it felt more like a slight then an oversight. I probably shouldn't care food was delicious and I'd definitely come back for the dumplings, but I'm so frustrated. If you look through my check ins you can see how much we dine out and how extensive our tastes range. Foodies come in all ages, races, sizes and economic backgrounds. Please be respectful to all of us and don't ignore a mom and son just because you think I won't tip you as much as a group of guys on an expense account cus honestly I'll probably tip the same if not more cus I respect your job and you, even when you don't respect me."},{"name":"Schmidt's Sausage Haus","address":"240 E Kossuth St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Schmidt's was terrific.

First time there, was busy but pretty good.. no complaints.\\n\\nSecond time today was put mildly, miserable.\\n\\nWe arrived and there was the usual wait, so check in and get a pager with a quoted 15-20 minute wait.  So, about 30 minutes go by and we realize everyone in front of us was sat, so one person in my party went to the podium to ask..  then noticed that we were crossed off the list.  Our pager never went off.  The girl at the podium apologized and they seated us right away.  That's great, here's where it went south.\\n\\nWhen we were being seated, we were taken to possibly the worst table in the place.  a 2 top chairs only with a view of the server station.  Considering there were 3 booths just 2 feet away unoccupied we requested one of those.   We were told NO, because those are reserved for parties of more than 2.   That set me back, so if i'm just 2 people I get a subpar experience?  what?\\n\\nTHEN, the manager RAY stops by and we explain our pager didn't go off, so we were sat at this wierd table can we get one of those booths (still all empty) and he promptly tells us our pager most certainly did go off.  Of course he has no idea what pager we had, but he's certain.  So it starts right off being called a liar in a very rude way.\\n\\nSo, not terribly happy, we sit in our table and dealt with it.  The empty booths we couldn't have sat empty for 10 minutes at least, with one of them never being sat during our meal.  Our server was as sweet as can be, apologized up and down and really didn't understand why they were so steadfast about not putting us at one of those empty tables.  Then, it got even worse.  They sat the table just 4 feet away from us that we asked for with TWO PEOPLE after so adamantly saying to us that we could not have that table because we were two people.  Meanwhile, one of the other booths was STILL empty.\\n\\nWe called the manager to ask why we were denied yet that party wasn't, why the other 3 booths were also denied to us.   RAY then told us those booths were full (wha? I just  watched them for half an hour empty, what are you talking about?  one of them was STILL empty as he's telling me they are full.   So he repeats his statements of 2 tops don't get booths etc, more or less calling me us liars and saying he doesn't want to get into this conversation.. at which point I asked him, 'you don't care do you?' his answer?  NO, I don't care.  My jaw dropped, our server was shocked when she saw them seat 2 people right next to us where we wanted to be and completely mortified by her manager's actions. \\n\\nAt the end of the day, the food was good, our server was nice but the way the place is run was so incredibly rude and inconsiderate it ruined everything.  They made absolutely NO considerations for their mistreatment or mistakes and although I wasn't looking for a discount none was offered.\\n\\nThis is the very first review of this nature i've ever written and it really pains me to do it but Ray really needs to be removed from that restaurant and put in some training courses."},{"name":"Tavern in the Square","address":"1815 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3","text":"I'm a light weight with alcohol so normally two mixed drinks would start to make me feel slightly buzzed, not so with this place.

The concept is brilliant in my opinion: this place has local chefs from top restaurants around the area design sandwiches for the place, and they sell them under the name of the restaurant (i.e. Blue Ginger, L'espalier, and a personal favorite of mine which is now off the menu, Rialto).  Not only that, but the sandwiches are also the huge.

The Zuni Roll is pretty good, but it's a wrap, and I much prefer the sandwiches.  My favorite sandwich that I've ever ordered there is the Rialto, but was only on the menu for a short time this summer, whereas it used to be a staple.  But right now the best thing they've got is the Pudding Portobello: delicious!  They also have a veal sandwich on special right now that's amazing (if you're into eating poor, defenseless calves that are tortured their entire short lives, which I am).  All of the sandwiches are very unique and delicious.\\n\\nAnd that's just the food.  They also have a selection of about 80 beers, mostly in bottles, and have one of those challenges where if you drink all of them in a year, you get some prize.  They have some great selections, including Abita Amber/Turbodog/Purple Haze, Duvel, Unibroue Ephemere/La Fin du Monde, Julius Echter, and other greats.  Sadly they have also included complete garbage on the list as well, like PBR and Miller High Life.\\n\\nTable service is decent, but I definitely prefer to sit at the bar, where I feel the service is outstanding.

Though I don't rate service or atmosphere, Chef Hung was excellent in both.  \\n\\nTo be consistent, I ordered the first beef noodle on the menu. It came fairly quickly and the overall appearance of the soup was attractive. Respecting the 4 main components, I found the soup broth to be quite good, it is a little spicy though, but I've heard there's no MSG in it (B+).  The beef was unique; they included slices of rare beef and traditional stewed beef; the stewed beef was moist and fell apart in my mouth, it was definitely not too lean; the rare beef was an unexpectedly pleasant surprise (A).  The noodles may be the best part of the whole soup since they were chewy and homemade; in fact you can see the cooks make the noodles behind glass alongside the foyer of the restaurant (A). The weakest part of this soup was the cabbage, since it was spicy, not sour; the manager was empathetic and said that they are always trying to improve the cabbage (C+).  \\n\\nBased on the 4 main components, the overall score of this soup was A-. I'll admit, that even though I don't live in Richmond, I went back the very next day to eat this soup again."},{"name":"Cilantro and Jalape√±o","address":"131- 123 Carrie Cates Court","city":"North Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"We came for soup, but the Soup Meister had put away their soup already, so we came across this place.

Just make a new order of nachos without meat! When we complained about our food (there were so many issues with our food, I would be writing a novel if i listed all of them), the guy who worked there was going to offer us a frequent customer card as some form condolences.

It's located in a strip mall type area so there's a lot with plenty of parking. There's a choice of sitting either outside or inside, and I opted for an indoor seat which had a wait time of about 15 minutes during dinner time on a Tuesday night.\\n\\nThe waitress was very friendly with helpful suggestions and patiently explained what the various Ethiopian items on the menu were. I ended up getting the tibs signature entree in which you pick a meat, bread, and side. I tried the lamb, pita bread, injera (think sourdough spongey bread that comes rolled up), miser (lentils), and potato stew. All of the food was very good (and I don't even really like lamb that much) and pretty easy on your wallet. However, the food was also heavier imo, and it had a very distinct smell to it that lingered unpleasantly after dinner. \\n\\nOverall, Desta is really great for trying Ethiopian food but I would most likely not seek this place out again bc Ethiopian isn't really my cup of tea.

Some of the side items are the same or very similar to sides at 4rivers like the cheesy grits so you will see some familiar favorites but they also have quite a few side items that are more unique.

It's mushy and flavorless, and it completely falls apart and leaks liquid into your hand through the foil. I would expect that there is a better way to prepare this waffle, but since I don't work at a waffle cart, or make soggy, wet waffles, I don't know what that better way is. Perhaps there is no better way to make a folded waffle, so I will just give up on eating folded waffles altogether. \\n\\nThe other problem with the \\"Dutch Taco\\" (not sure I like the sound of that) is the meat inside. The bacon is WAAAAYYYY too hard, like, it almost hurts my mouth to eat it, which is a huge bummer. If I order bacon, it better be good, and this bacon is not.

Great place to stop by for ramen if you are into a regular bowl of Fukuoka style ramen: pork based soup, thin noodles. \\n\\nThe experience and flavor is similar but slightly falls short of Ichiran Ramen (a chain in Japan but now also available in NY) and Ippudo. However I really enjoyed the Pork slices and the quickness of service which added a few points in my book. I prefer the \\"Bari-kata\\" (very firm) noodles but I'd recommend going with the regular ramen with standard options to start."},{"name":"Locke-Ober","address":"3 Winter Pl","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I'll go into more detail, but the bottom line is that Locke Ober is a good restaurant with excellent food, but what you're really paying for is the ambience.\\n\\nWhen we were unable to get a table for a Sunday night and opted for Friday instead, my husband and I figured that the dining room would be more crowded at 7pm-- perhaps we came a bit early, but there were only two other tables filled that Friday, which made for an extremely quiet dining experience.\\n\\nService was impeccable-- we never had to wait for water refills or answers to questions about the menu.\\n\\nAs for the food: The JFK Lobster Stew was extremely good-- nice big chunks of lobster in a creamy but flavorful broth. I've never had a better lobster stew, not even in Maine. The ahi tuna ceviche was also good, but not a show-stopper. We ordered the soy-glazed duck with miso orange sauce and pea tendrils, which was good, and the swordfish with smoked tomato butter and shrimp risotto, which was superb. I must learn to make risotto this good someday, and the buttery texture and flavor of the swordfish was incredible. We did not feel the need to order any side dishes, though if we'd been hungrier it might have been a good idea, as the sides that came with entrees were (not small) but \\"delicate.\\" The dessert-- a sundae consisting of a scoop of coffee gelato with rum butterscotch sauce and toasted walnuts-- was not worth getting. The sauce was one-note, the gelato melted too quickly, and the walnuts didn't really add anything.\\n\\nAll in all, we had a nice experience, but given the price I'd prefer to go elsewhere with perhaps not the same ambience, but with even better food. I think people should go here at least once, just to say they have, but it's not going to be on our list of special occasion restaurants in the future."},{"name":"Hopdoddy Burger Bar","address":"1400 S Congress Ave, Ste A190","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"You haven't had a burger until you've been to Hopdoddy's.

It seemed like overkill to have 2 hostesses at the front (when we left it was up to 3), but they were friendly and personable.  We were showed to our table and we sat down ready for some killer burgers.\\nOur waiter, Ryan, did an amazing job welcoming us to FLIP, telling us about the concept and walking us through his burger recommendations.  He also filled us in on the special burger - and told us it was so popular that it would soon be a permanent addition to the menu.  \\n\\nThe food - ahhhh, the food.  I am a sucker for a great burger, especially with the toppings are out of the box and the meat is cooked to my exact specifications (hello, Medium-Rare).  That it was.  I ordered the Southern Burger and was not disappointed.  The patty is country friend, topped with cucumbers, pimento cheese, and green tomato ketchup.  Even for a fried patty, it was exactly as requested.  The melding of typical Southern flavors was absolutely divine and the layer textures kept my taste buds singing.   I ordered a side of the Vodka Onion Rings (served with a Beer Honey Mustard) and they were some of the best onion rings I have had in Atlanta.  They were wonderfully crispy with a nice ratio of batter to ring - none of that onion pulling out of the shell when you bite down issues.  The dipping sauce was not needed, but it did add a nice zing to the rings.  I topped it off with a Krispy Kreme milkshake (how could I miss out on such an option).  The milkshake came to the table still \\"smoking\\" from the liquid nitro - a fun experience.  Believe it or not, the shake tasted just like a Krispy Kreme donuts.  It was a delicious treat - but oh so rich.\\n\\nMy dad went a different direction - he ordered the Cuban.  It came with pork belly, swiss cheese, sweet pickles and a mojo sauce.  It looked amazing and my Dad devoured it so quickly he considered ordering a second one.  On the side, he enjoyed the Greek slaw with Feta cheese, and olives.  \\n\\nThe atmosphere is interesting - lots of TVs on the walls and music playing all the time.  Lunch time should warrant a lower volume on the music as people do like to talk over their burgers.  Yelling over a lunch table isn't much fun.  This is something they should consider fixing.

It seems like every time I eat here I'm either by myself or with one other person. Result being that I haven't tried very many things off the menu, because I like the pad thai and beef salad so much that I rarely venture beyond. The pad thai is my absolute favorite. So rarely do you get that combination of spicy and sour with a hint (just a hint) of sweetness. For a dish primarily based on carbs, this doesn't feel heavy at all. Also, I love the pinch of ground chilies (sp?) that let's you customize the heat level--great for spice fiends like me.\\n\\nI think they've removed the beef salad from the menu, but you can probably still get it since the staff tends to be very accommodating. They took my favorite cocktail, the sra merikot (probably butchered the spelling), off the menu a long time ago, but the friendly and knowledgeable bartender always makes it for me. I love sitting at the bar since this nice young lady manages to strike the perfect balance--sociable without being intrusive. All of the cocktails are tasty. Moreover, the fancy ingredients--house infused botanicals, liqueurs, syrups--actually serve to give the drinks a delicious complexity rather than just seeming pretentious.\\n\\nThe only things on the menu that I haven't been fond of were the fried oysters and coconut soup, but I think that's just personal preference--friends have liked these a lot more."},{"name":"FLIP burger boutique","address":"1587 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I came here with my sister, and we were very happy with FLIP!

Instantly fell in love with the place after my first visit due to the ambience, entertainment (live music, belly dancing etc) and food (NOTE: I was a omnivore then). Since then I have frequented this place quite often and also recommended it to tonnes of my friends who live in ATX. I say all this about Ararat to set the context for how I started frequenting this place.\\n\\nFast forward to 2008 (not sure of when exactly but something around that time), this place after having being turned over once already from the Turkish owner to some American gals (who were ex-waitresses there I think) was starting to lose its charm. Food quality and service was becoming something you couldn't rave about to friends anymore. Right about then I heard that this place had been bought out (again) and named PHARA'S. Since then this place has been on a steady upward ascent to restore its reputation and charm that got lost somewhere along the way.\\n\\nLast night my wife surprised me with a birthday gig there by inviting 30 some friends of mine. It was held in the Casabah which I highly recommend if you want a warmer, indoor and smoke-free environment. To make the best of both the worlds, we enjoyed the Casabah while the dinner, drinks, belly dancing lasted and then later moved to the outdoor backyard to enjoy some Hookah and some more belly dancing. The whole night the service was amazing!! You can tell the folks working there are being taken care of well by Phara since they seemed genuinely happy to be there. The food quality was really good (better in many ways from the Ararat days). I say that even though I am now a strict Vegetarian. I would love to see them add more Vegetarian dishes and kick the spice level up a notch but then again I am sure they are trying to stay true to their middle eastern roots and not really cater to Indians like me which is fine :) The Belly Dancing performer (Kamilah) was amazing!! She entertained the crowd very well. Was quite friendly at the end as she came by chatting with all. She especially paid a lot of attention to the kids which I am sure all the parents appreciated a lot.\\n\\nThe best touch to the night was to see the owner Phara walking around from table to table personally making sure that everyone was happy. She  must have come by at least three times over the course of the night to me and ask me if I was having a good birthday night. That in my opinion is priceless!!\\n\\nI wish Phara and her crew all the very best for continued success for years to come and as for me, I will defn be going back very soon and continuing to recommend that place in my circle of friends."},{"name":"T'Kilas Tacos & More","address":"1248 Clairmont Rd","city":"Decatur","stars":"3","text":"Good fajitas, friendly service, not a bad way to spend a Friday night!

My husband and I have been going there for years, and fail to recall a time when we walked away wishing things had been different.\\nThe menu is pretty straightforward: standby staples punctuated with an ever-changing specials list which zeroes in on a different European region every few weeks or so. Each dish is simple, straightforward, and makes me wonder, \\"why didn't I think of that?\\"\\n\\nPerhaps it's the intimate size of Navarre's kitchen which inspires. The place is small....we're talking put-two-freeway-tollbooths-together small. And it's not just one person back there. Nope. Try 2 wait staff, chef, sous-chef, and dishwasher. \\n\\nThe \\"bird\\" is always wonderful: chicken baked in a lovely country sauce...often with mushrooms. Make sure you order the plate of Ken's Artisan bread to soak up the goodness. Cheese plates are lovely --- and the wait staff is always happy to describe the offerings before you order. Steamed clams in a simple white wine/butter/onion sauce will have you ordering more bread, and the vegetables are cooked to perfection -- roasted squash with a sage/brown butter seasoning was divine, and carrots with cumin would make anyone smile.\\n\\nThe wine list can be intimidating --- tons to choose from. But again the staff cuts through it with insight and even a tasting or two to help you focus. The beer list is varied, interesting, and changes on a regular basis.\\n\\nSave room, if you can, for dessert. The red velvet cake will impress your Southern friends, the dark chocolate cake with buttercream frosting makes my eyes roll back in my head... but it's Navarre's pies that are truly masterful: apple, strawberry/rhubarb (!!!), and chocolate pear (do not be afraid...it's seriously good) are divine.\\n\\nNavarre has survived being dubbed \\"restaurant of the year\\" by The Oregonian ---- which just meant longer lines for those of us who knew it all along ---- and it still delivers, proving you don't need a big, fancy kitchen with the latest equipment, Italian marble counter tops and imported silverware to create remarkable fare.

The egg is always perfectly cooked, but the meat is almost never cooked the way you said you wanted it.  I've always asked for \\"medium\\" and I generally get anything ranging from \\"still mooing\\" to \\"charcoal briquette\\".  Luckily, the egg hides most of the meat's flavor, so it's not a huge loss.  Their special blend of herbs and spices for the fries, which probably consists of at least 85% MSG, is very tasty.  Coat the fries liberally with it, though, because they are abysmal without it.\\n\\nThe service ranges from \\"girl who won't shut up and go away\\" to \\"girl who asks if you want a refill then disappears for 45 minutes\\".  Sometimes you get lucky and get good service, but I wouldn't bet anything substantial on it.  The games and puzzles on the kids meals apparently haven't changed since the Reagan administration since they're always the same every time we go there, and they only give you 2 crayons per kid.  Believe me, this stuff matters:  If you have one red crayon and one yellow crayon, the potential for mass confusion during a heated tic tac toe game is high since the yellow is virtually invisible on the white paper.\\n\\nThis place is better than fast food, but only just.

The Peruvian tartar gave it a nice finish.\\n\\nMy friend moved on the Locra de Zapallo (Empanada filled with kale, corn, roasted butternut squash, fresh cheese, salsa de aji y cebolla china).

Inside you'll see another side of Austin, but I recommend only going to the Public House with a small group (2-5) of friends and getting its tasty donuts.. \\n\\nWe made a call-ahead reservation for 10 to Gourdoughs Public House on a Saturday night. I have been to the Public House before and compared to my previous experience, it had an average-size crowd dining with them that night.\\n\\nService: For our size, the service was not up-to-par. I understand that our group was large, but I have been here before with a group of 15 and things were just fine and dandy. It took awhile to get our drinks, food, and checks.  In the end, our whole dining experience took 3 hours to complete. \\n\\nFood: A majority of the group ordered burgers--either the Ron Burgundy or the Big Baller-- while the other members of our party ordered the Dirty South. All the dishes were hearty, and the burgers can be a good-size portion of fresh potatoe chips. The Ron Burgundy did come with a generous portion of bacon. \\n\\nBe aware! These burgers were messy, so make sure you have napkins in hand. The buns of the burgers are fried donuts, so they were quite greasy. As a result, most of my party couldn't finish their burgers and opted to leave some behind. I heard no complaints about the Dirty South (chicken fried steak), \\n\\nDessert: We only ordered a single donut, the Puddin', because many of us were full and felt a bit queasy. The Puddin' is a cream-filled donut topped with cream cheese icing, bananas and vanilla wafers. It fed the five of us that could still eat. It is quite sweet, so you could always opt for less icing. \\n\\nIn the end, it was not my best experience at the Public House. In fact, a few of us walked away with upsets stomachs.

It was an odd combination, so we asked for ranch- MUCH better flavors. \\n\\nWe ordered our food- I ordered a classic fried chicken sandwich and a milkshake; my husband ordered the All American Patty Melt with a side of BBQ sauce. I asked for an side of mayo as sometimes they don't put enough sauce to my liking...the waitress said, \\"for what?\\" I let her know, my sandwich comes with mayo, I like extra on the side.\\n\\nOur food came out before we were finished with our appetizer. Problems arise...my chicken fell out of the breaking in one fellow bite. I've worked in fast food before, I recognize this as letting frozen, fried chicken breasts sit in a food warmer for entirely too long. UNACCEPTABLE. My husbands \\"patty melt\\" had more smothered onions and Thousand Island than anything and...was missing CHEESE!! He said it tasted like frozen meat. I also haven't received my milkshake yet. We alerted our server who just had excuse after excuse as to why the milkshake wasn't ordered and asked me if I was sure I didn't want it. We asked for the manager, he took one look at my chicken and said it was unacceptable to have been served that. When my husband brought up that his burger tasted like a frozen patty, he said that nothing is frozen in their restaurant. Ha, okay bud. He did take off our entrees and had us just pay for our mediocre appetizer. \\n\\nWe aren't from this area, but heard this was a new restaurant in the area (we have them where we are from and enjoy eating there MOST of the time).

I am very thankful for this place because when we are hungry and need delivery because the house is empty of food on a Friday evening I can now rely on a pizza place to deliver delicious pizza as we do not have many options in this area.

And then there is the fact that my wife ordered hush puppies.  We waited and waited.  Then a waiter stopped by and said they would be out shortly. Ten minutes later I walk out to the counter and ask about them, and the hush puppies are just sitting on the counter.  \\n\\nAt least the manager, Christan stopped by after he heard about our experience and apologized.

The gist here is beer and burgers.\\n\\nI went on Sunday at 3PM hoping it would not be busy but alas, I was wrong.  I waited in line for over 20 minutes before getting to order.  This place was \\"hopping\\" (chortle, chortle--nevermind).\\n\\nWhat is nice about Hopdoddy's is that they grind their own meat in house, they only buy grass-fed hormone and antibiotic meat too which is a major plus.  The buns are also made fresh daily and are delicious.\\n\\nThis place is environmentally conscious as all the napkins and plasticware is the recycled kind and in addition they recycle what you throw away.  The sodas on tap are Maine root including Dublin Dr. Pepper, the main reason why this place jumps from 4 to 5 stars for me.\\n\\nThe fries are also cut in house and are sprinkled with some sort of herb that is yummy.  The portions are huge so plan on taking your stuff home but don't plan on getting a box to go as once again the environmentally friendly restaurant only has recycled brown paper bags and wrappings for to-go stuff.\\n\\nCost of burgers start out at $5 and go up, my burger was the mushroom burger made with goat cheese and it was $7 (and very yummy I must say).  I think based on the high grade of meat and homemade buns the pricing is fair because these are quality burgers.\\n\\nYou order your food counter style and they give you a number.  You then find a seat and put your number on a hook.  If they are really busy like they were Sunday one of the staff will assign you a number ahead of time and reserve you a seat with your number waiting.\\n\\nVariety is another big plus of this place.  They have a full bar including a wide variety of beers on draft:  512 IPA, 512 Pecan Porter, St. Arnold Lawnmower, Shiner, Fireman's, Real Ale Blanco Pale, Independence Bootlegger Brown, Buddah's Brew, Live Oak Plz and Hef, and Guiness.\\n\\nIn addition to variety of alcohol you can also get chipotle ketchup, and horseradish BBQ sauce for your food (they have regular ketchup and mayo in containers below).  They also have bottled beer and bottled soda.  Lots of choices here!\\n\\nBased on the crowd I would except this place to succeed (plus location in the heart of South Congress doesn't hurt) so try it out, just expect to wait in line."},{"name":"Blue Star Donuts","address":"1155 SW Morrison St, Ste 102","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"This review is long overdue.

It has a vibrant atmosphere, while still being conducive to doing work (very important for people like me that do all their work in coffee shops.) The staff is friendly and knowledgable, more on that later. The customer base is a perfect combination of socializing and being productive. The coffee is great, but that's due to several factors, which we'll delve into momentarily. My only gripe, similar to Katherine M.'s is that they are getting awfully close to the commercialism of a Starbucks with the extent of retail items they have. However, those retail items are very high quality coffee products (as opposed to stuffed animals and vanilla syrup), which redeems DG slightly. Ok, on to the snobbery, if you care to read it!\\n\\nHere's my take on coffee: it's just coffee, it's not world peace, so don't hinge your life on being the best, but it's really cool to do things right. As a former barista, I know a fair amount about coffee, and I hold coffee shops to a pretty high standard. (Because it's fun to have such standards, not because I think perfect coffee is the be all end all of the universe). A Batdorf & Bronson coffee shop pretty much tops the charts on coffee snobbery, so let's see how they stack up:\\n\\nMy first major test is the cappuccino test. A true-to-Italy cappuccino is an 8-10 oz drink, espresso with steamed milk. All the shenanigans about foam vs. no foam is crap. The proportion of espresso to milk is roughly equal, slightly more milk than coffee. That's the point of a cappuccino - the espresso taste isn't buried under a bunch of milk, but it's toned down enough for those of us who don't like straight espresso. Thus, in my book, a truly great coffee shop will only serve one size of cappuccino. Anything larger becomes a latte. So - Dancing Goats passes the first test on that. \\n\\nTest #2 - Automatic, semi-automatic or fully manual? Espresso machines typically come in three varieties, which in turn make baristas come in three varieties. An automatic machine delivers an predetermined amount of espresso-grind coffee, runs a predetermined amount of water through it, and produces identical shots at the press of a button. Example: Starbucks. Semi-automatic machines require the barista to pack the espresso properly, which takes some attention, depending on humidity and air temperature of wherever one is making the espresso. The machine runs a predetermined amount of water through the espresso, although the barista can cut it off preemptively. A fully manual machine means that the barista packs the espresso, then turns on the water and watches as the shot comes out for the exact moment to cut off the water. It takes a fair amount of skill to make consistant shots this way, because every shot is a little different, might take more or less water, might need to be packed tighter, etc. DG has a fully manual machine, so A+ on this test.\\n\\nTest #3 - flexibility. Once it's clear that these guys know what their doing, I like to test how serious they are about doing things \\"their way.\\" I've noticed that a certain west-side coffee shop is pretty hardcore about not varying from their norms, which is sort of obnoxious. That's cool, but I like to see that baristas can just roll with things and give people the coffee that they want. (If someone wants a 4-shot large cappuccino, just give it to 'em, right?) After getting my plain old cappuccino, I asked for one with brown sugar put in the bottom of the cup, so it melts when the espresso is poured over it. So yummy. Now a hardcore coffee snob would not be excited about doing this, but it seems like a pretty standard operation at DG. I approve.\\n\\nTest #4 - barista knowledge. Now I haven't really \\"talked shop\\" with the folks at DG, but I did overhear one of the baristas asking a fellow barista to explain the Chemex filters  to a customer who was buying some (which they sell, along with the Chemex pots.) If you really want to be the top of coffee snobbery, your baristas really need to know the ins and outs of such a crucial piece of the coffee snob arsenal. So I think they need to do a little more training on the plain coffee and retail side, but it seems like their espresso knowledge is generally top notch.\\n\\nOverall, DG does fulfills the role of a coffee snob's wet dream, without the full pretentiousness that I was sort of expecting. I could tell there are plenty of customers that just want their nonfat vanilla latte to go and don't give a crap about the 'science' of espresso or any of that. But for those that want to come in learn, or show off their own knowledge, the crew at DG can definitely handle that with out sounding like a bunch of smug creeps. Bravo, Dancing Goat, bravo.\\n\\n(I think I'll have to write a book one day called \\"Tales from a Coffee Snob.\\" This review will likely be one of the first chapters"},{"name":"Giuseppe's Ritrovo","address":"2268 E Main St","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"Dear friends, \\n\\nAvoid this den of inequity lest you wish to suffer an intestinal calamity.

But this place has been my best experience of this kind of food so far. \\n\\nI tried a lot of things on their menu but i think generally the complete standout for me was Migas, which is a Tex-Mex variant of an ancient Spanish and Portuguese dish. \\n\\nI don't want to explain the history of Migas and how Tex-Mex cuisine made a variant so just look it up yourself. \\n\\nBut basically, I liked it because it felt like you were eating crispy chips with your breakfast taco filled with eggs, chorizo, potatoes, avocado, salsa and the toasted tortilla. \\n\\nI would have probably given this place one star less if i were completely being objective because i felt like the stuff was too expensive. 3 bucks for a taco.

Again, not that this place was bad, but they definitely aren't up to the French standard yet.\\n\\nThe only thing that was really frustrating and disappointing was that the way they serve the crapes folded over, you really needed to eat the desert ones with a fork and knife. However, they only had plastic utensils which did not make for a very enjoyable experience on the dessert crepe. The knife wasn't sharp enough, kept warping under pressure, and it really messed up the crepe. They might want to raise their prices by a quarter and use a higher quality plastic utensil they are going to stay that way!"},{"name":"Halal Bros","address":"1910 W Braker Ln","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Amazing place..

These tasty chicken, nugget style bites were delicious. They have a terrific flavor with just a bit of heat. The fried batter was perfect, no mushy parts at all. The just fried bites were so hot we had to let them cool before we could eat. I appreciate that freshness. We ate every bit of our order, which was perfect for sharing and eating on the go. The toothpicks are the perfect way to eat these super flavorful morsels. A few of the basil leaves are in the fried order and they added lots of flavor to a bite. At $6.00 the price is great.

Granted, I haven't tried a lot of brunch here, but what I had at Medina was sub-par, and it's shameful that such drab food gets a #1 ranking.  How bad is everything else?  (And/or our palates? :/)  I went with a friend on a sunny Saturday afternoon, just before close, and the place was half-empty so waiting wasn't an issue.  The atmosphere was cozy and hip, I like the space, even if small, and the staff was courteous and flexible, leaving us the option to have desert before closing.  We ordered the Paella and the Tagine, and they were certainly pretty and appetizing when they arrived.  But that's where the good news stops.  I was shocked to find that the Paella was just orzo - looking at the menu now it seems they've added that to the description, but I don't recall that detail when I ordered or I would have avoided it completely.  Pasta is pasta, not Paella.  Strike one.  Besides the orzo making for a soft dish instead of a nice paella with bite, the dish overall was also bland.  The ingredients were healthy and the dish looked fresh, but everything just kind of melded together, both texturally and flavour (or lack of flavour) wise, and so it missed the mark.  As for the Tagine, definitely more of a flavour punch, but almost in the opposite direction.  The flavour of the tomato base was acidic and pungent, and the sausage was spicy and tasy, but dry and shrivelled, which is fine in small doses to add flavour and texture, but not as the main event like here - two links in the dish, was just too much (and the poached eggs just ran into the tart tomato sauce - such a waste of the delicate yolk flavour.)  We were going to order the waffles for desert, to try the special flavoured sauces, but passed for fear they'd be just as disappointing and preferred to save our money.  Not a cheap meal to be only so-so.  So do I believe this is the best brunch spot in Vancouver?  With fake paella and some pathetic sausage, it just can't be.  Who would even wait in line?  I'm certainly not going back, and I really wanted to like this place, I love Middle Eastern/Mediterranean food!  Even the French toast at Cafe Deux Soleils was better, and that's hardly the best brunch in town either.  So... will the real best brunch place please stand up? :)"},{"name":"Maria's Taqueria","address":"226 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Had their taco dinner plate and it hit the spot.

It doesn't have a classy atmosphere, it seems very \\"kid-oriented\\" (I'm kid-less), and they don't have any side dishes that I like.  But --- I'm almost embarrassed to say --- they have a couple of food items that are just top-of-their-class.  \\nLet's start with that Campfire Sauce.  I can never describe it to people who haven't tried it.  I want to say maybe it's a concoction of ranch and BBQ because that's what it looks like, except it totally doesn't taste like BBQ ranch.  It's not spicy.  (They do have another delectable sauce called \\"Baja Ranch\\" that is just the right level of spice for a girl like me.  It's almost as good as the Campfire Sauce, but not quite).   Campfire sauce is a little bit sweet, a little bit herb-y, a whole lot delicious.  My recommendation is just to TRY it.  Please, please, please try it.  For my sake.  Trust me, you will find it addicting.  I always get it as a side with my sandwich.  My husband orders a side of it with his fries.  Pretty much anything is greatly enhanced with the addition of Campfire Sauce.  I have yet to introduce it to anyone who didn't think it was amazing.\\nThe other thing that is surprisingly great at Red Robin is their turkey burger.  I order turkey burgers at a lot of restaurants.  This one is my favorite.  (Hyde Park Bar and Grill used to have a turkey burger that could rival this, but they've changed it up the past few years and it no longer has the deliciously seasoned taste it used it).  The turkey burger at Red Robin is stellar.  It is very, very well-seasoned, which sets it apart from most other places.  Disclaimer:  I order it completely 100% customized, as the turkey burger on Red Robin's menu comes with a bunch of yucky toppings I don't like and on a wheat bun (why do restaurants always assume that people who eat turkey or veggie burgers want wheat buns?????).  I order it on a regular sesame seed bun with sauteed onions and swiss cheese.  And, of course, that side of Campfire Sauce.  It's delish!\\nRed Robin is also one of the few places I order a beverage other than water.  I don't drink alcohol and I don't care for soda or tea, so that usually limits me to water.  But Red Robin has this delicious Very Berry Raspberry Limeade that is very refreshing and fruity (I order it with \\"extra berry\\" because I just like to make my order there as high-maintenance as possible.....). \\nAs I said earlier, there are unfortunately no sides I care for.  Their featured accompaniment is bottomless fries, which is great if you're a french-fry eater, but I'm not.

We also enjoyed the fresh and spicy guac that also accompanies the $24 small tray. All the sides sounded great, we ended up with the delicious slaw and the cucumber salad. The tamale filling we sampled was mushroom, not a fan but I want to try the pork next time. Our server apologized again for the delay and insisted that our next drink or dessert was on the house. We opted for the spiced chocolate pudding. Another delay, from the kitchen this time, when Dakota came back she let us know all our food would be comped.

I got there once at 6pm and we beat the line that started swarming in at around 6:30-7pm. \\n\\nParking can be street parking or they have a garage right behind it, and you just need to make sure you pick up a free validation ticket from the cashier when you order your food.\\n\\nI think they also have wifi.

The fat from the burger and the aioli and the onions just disintegrated the bun underneath, making it difficult to eat.

The portions were significantly smaller than those in comparable restaurants. \\nThe dishes came with sides of leafy salads. Salads from South Asia, instead of being leafy, are heavy on cucumbers, tomatoes and onions, like the ones you might see on a middle-eastern food platter.

This worked fine when I ordered my meal, but not so good when I went back to get an order of Buffalo Chicken Tenders appetizers.

The drink station and dining area is clean and well-maintained by friendly folks that greet you.\\n\\nI got the Chicken N' Waffles which were really good.  You get three big fried chicken finger (breasts) artfully placed on a cut up waffle with a garnish of watermelon and pickles (see picture.)  The chicken is perfectly fried with a crunchy outside and a nongreasy inside.\\nUPDATE 5/26/14 -- The Shrimp and Grits were great! I highly recommend.  Also, surprise cameo visit to our table by Mr. Rivers himself.\\n\\nThe Coop also sells fried chicken by the bucket and also offers good assortment of Southern/soul/comfort food with lots of sides to choose from.  Desserts greet you first thing at the front of the line, but I didn't have any this trip.\\n\\nThe Coop is not perfect.  The register staff seemed a little undertrained or maybe they were still working out kinks in the payment system.  Hours are short on weekdays and the place doesn't sell any beer or wine.\\nUPDATE 5/26/14 -- Noticed that they did have some beer selections behind the register -- Shiner Bock and a couple of macro selections.\\nThe fast food assembly line approach may not appeal to some that would rather just be served or don't like feeling pressured to make decisions in a line.\\n\\nIn the right situation, I recommend that you give The Coop a try for some good food and Southern hospitality.

We have been to the South End location multiple times for dinner and brunch, but this one topped them all. We didn't have a reservation like we usually do so we were expecting to have a long wait for a table. When we arrived, the waitress told us it would be around a 45 min wait; we knew this would be the case and decided to grab two seats at the bar for drinks. We ordered a glass of Malbec and a Lagunitas to start. After waiting the 45 min and still not being seated, we decided to order food at the bar since the bartenders were wildly entertaining. \\n\\nBefore we ordered our own tapas, the bar tenders brought us over a complimentary kale salad and migas (fried egg over chorizo and potato hash). Both were delicious and held us over until our other tapas came. We ordered the patatas braves, hanger steak, grilled calamari, chickpea mushroom dish, and tortilla espanola. While ordering these, we also asks for a pitcher of red sangria. The tapas came out quickly and were all phenomenal except the grilled calamari. The texture was a bit chewy and we weren't huge fans. Our pitcher of sangria also never came, but we each got two complimentary glasses of sangria instead so that was fine. The bartender also brought us over chocolate crepes with ice cream for dessert after feeling bad about forgetting the sangria pitcher. \\n\\nOverall, this was our best experience at Barcelona.

You can pretty much find all their staple foods on their Autobahn buffet, so make sure to try that if you don' t know where to begin.

I especially loved the potato salad and that really surprised me because I'd never eaten potato salad that I liked until then. I would definitely recommend the buffet simply because of the price. It will cost you approximately the same amount as a singular dish from the menu. The service was pretty bad this time. It seemed as if we were just an annoyance to our waiter. He even stopped coming around half way through our visit and was replaced by someone else. I thought maybe he had gone home for the day but I continued to see him throughout the restaurant. There was no band playing this time but the atmosphere once again was warm and cozy. \\n\\nI would like to note that the atmosphere feeling so welcoming to me could likely be due to both visits occurring in winter.

He told us that 2 of our ordered items were not there because and I quote, \\"we just literally ran out of them 40 seconds ago.\\" We politely told DJ that he was lying that we placed out order and Cindy the awesome bartender apologized to us on the way out. Please stop lying to your customers DJ not good customer service.  And Thank you Cindy for being so friendly."},{"name":"Monica's Trattoria","address":"67 Prince St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I have to agree with many of the reviews below. Trattoria Di Monica is a small cute Italian restaurant (probably not appropriate for groups larger than 6 or so) on a side street in Boston's North End. We went there for restaurant week and had a pleasant experience. The restaurant week menu is very appealing 3 courses for 39$ and 49$ with a wine pairing. \\n\\nIf you do go outside of restaurant week here are some comments - I had the primavera spinach fettuccine and thought it was ok but all my friends seemed to be happy with their orders. The risotto is especially recommended. The service is good and prices are reasonable."},{"name":"Punjab Palace","address":"109 Brighton Ave","city":"Allston","stars":"4","text":"There is no better deal out there! For under $10 you get a small appetizer, chai at the end, and a delicious meal. Plus quick polite service, wonderful Indian music videos in the background and they are great about packaging your leftovers."},{"name":"N&P Saigon Subs","address":"1185 N Main St","city":"Randolph","stars":"4.5","text":"Cute family owned caf√©; big subs and food!

We ordered four dishes and asked for rice ...we got a small side.  Even the the pad Thai, the go to dish, didn't wow me.  I'm glad others have had a good experience, but I will pass on this in the future."},{"name":"Rangzen Tibetan Place","address":"24 Pearl St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"I eat the lunch buffet quite often.
