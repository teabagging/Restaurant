The location itself is actually more pleasant, a bright space with lots of natural light in addition to the hokey big game themed decor.  There weren't any big misses on the menu that I sampled but there were a couple big hits.\\n\\nFor appetizers I sampled the lobster hushpuppies and the emu carrapacio nachos.  The hushpuppies were the real winner here.  Those were really good though not at all healthy.  The nachos were interesting, and tasted ok, but a bit dominated by the guacamole flavor and not something I necessarily need to order again.\\n\\nFor the meal I had the winter squash soup, the special of the day which was a tenderloin kabob with red peppers over a bed of snow peas, and sampled a little of the burnt carrot side.\\n\\nThe tenderloin kabob was probably the best steak kabob I've had.  The meat was perfectly cooked to medium as requested, very juicy and flavorful with the right amount of salt to bring out the flavor.  I thoroughly enjoyed the snow peas as well.  The burnt carrots though were OMFG good.  Not dissimilar to how my husband makes carrots actually except that goat cheese and honey makes everything better.  I could have made a meal out of the carrots and a couple of my coworkers practically did!\\n\\nThe place still isn't cheap.  It's definitely a sometimes food.

Everything's beautiful, the streets are paved with stones that add a feeling like your eating in the streets of Parie. I love it! \\n\\nService:\\nThe service here was perfect, they were informative but not pushy. They never forgot about you. When our wine glasses or water glasses were close to empty they would refill it for us. Just a few con's they were a little messy sometimes cutting the meat and it falling on the table thank for the table cloth was clean. Also when pouring our wines they rushed and we had a few drops on our table cloth. Also they had tiny ants crawling around on my table. Made the meal a bit uneasy but I've come to and understanding its Florida.. their are bugs. \\n\\nMeat: \\nEverything tasted phenomenal. What I tried: \\n- Top Sirloin: Very delicious and juicy\\n- Bottom Sirloin (Flank Steak): Personally my favorite cut at Nelore\\n- Picanha (House Special): Eat the seared cut yummy smoked taste\\n- Filet Mignon Wrapped in Bacon: I was a little disappointed with the filet Mignon its my favorite cut but I think the bacon through it off for me. Wish they came around with JUST the Filet Mignon no bacon. \\n- Chicken Breast Wrapped in Bacon: This was a little dry even with the wrapped bacon. Guess the juices from the bacon over cooked the chicken.\\n- Rib-eye: My boyfriends favorite cut it was definitely smooth and delicious. \\n\\nSalad bar & hot sides: \\nThe salad bar wasn't super amazing but personally when I go to Brazilian steak restaurants I don't go for the salad if ya know what I mean. BUT I did try their Basil Tomato Bisque and omg.. it was amazing! I couldn't help dipping my cheese bread. The cheese bread is also a lot better than Fogo de Chao's (my personal opinion) it was light fluffy and hollow inside. The smoked salmon was delicious, fresh with a hint of smokey goodness.\\n\\nWine:\\nWe were suggested the Merlot because it went well with their top sirloin and most red meats and our hostess was right. Everything tasted really well with the wine. It made the experience that much better.  We didn't finish our bottle of wine so they offered to wrap it up for us. How nice. \\n\\nDessert: \\nThe Caramel Creme Brulee was delicious, the custard wasn't too sweet which I liked and the candy caramel was a little too sweet for my taste but that's how its suppose to be.\\n\\nPrice: \\nPromotions, If you sign up for their emails currently they're sending out 15% off your first bill, or they're doing $27.99 dinners or for $79.99 you get 2 dinners, 1 bottle of wine, and 2 deserts.

We both went home feeling uncomfortable.  It may have been due to the volume of food but I don't think that was the only reason.  I didn't find anything too spicy but I have a pretty good tolerance for that.  The steamed buns were very plain -- just dough with nothing in them.\\n\\nThe service was fast and courteous, however, I can't comment how it usually is as this was a pre-arranged menu.  The servers were very attentive in refilling water glasses, though.  One strange twist was plates of food without any serving utensils -- as if we were supposed to either use our own spoons/forks to take it, or take the pieces by hand (would not work for oily eggplant!)

Everything else was so... mediocre. For that downtown price, I thought it would be at least, good. Pork Gyoza had a weird taste to it. The Crispy chicken fried rice was not what I thought. It was some chicken friend rice shaped into patties and then fried. It tasted old, like it was leftover fried rice that they try to dress up again :( Spicy tuna roll has a weird taste. Maybe I was upset by how the server just tossed our plates on the table. Service goes a long way!!\\n\\nChicken Yakitori was the most disappointing thing of all!!! They pretty much just stuck some chicken on skewers and then boiled it. BOILED. It was not grilled. I tried one piece to see if maybe it would surprise me. Nope.

The shepherd's pie, in particular, was warm and hearty in exactly the way you expect a shepherd's pie to be (however, if you want a more upscale version of a shepherd's pie, you must go to Stephanie's on Newbury which serves my favorite version of this dish).  The shepherd's pie was presented as an enormous bowl of tender lamb stew with root vegetables, completed with creamy, delicious mashed potatoes.  Perfect for a cold winter day.\\n\\nI'm not much of a beer drinker, so I can't properly comment on the pub's drink selection, but my friend was more than pleased with the variety of beers on the menu.

Center, and today was just one of those days I want lunch but don't feel like going to far from my building. I usually grab a slice of pizza at Cafe Latin or accompany someone else getting a slice. All reviews have noted the place is teeny tiny, and the menu is a cluster fuck. I felt like a burrito so I asked if they do burritos (not on the menu or the to-go menu). The counter woman said yes, they have beef and chicken. I ordered a \\"spicy\\" chicken with everything on it. As a warning, don't ever order a burrito here. They are totally disgusting and almost 2 hours later I can still taste it lingering in my mouth. UGH! \\n\\nA \\"spicy chicken\\" burrito is a white flour wrapper, filled with a scoop of white rice, dried out chicken, lettuce, chopped tomatoes and 5 whole onions. Then they drizzle some sort of au jus on it that is neither spicy nor flavorful. Also, it's all cold - and they put it in a press for a minute or two which does literally nothing but make press marks on it. Totally COLD. Upon first bite I got a mouthful of raw onion. I don't mind eating some onions but I don't make a habit at taking bites out of whole ones. Second and third bites produced more of the same, which forced me to pick OUT onions which is disgusting and stinky. I didn't finish the burrito because I actually felt sick after eating so many raw onion bites and didn't want to continue. Won't be ordering those again. \\n\\nI should note as well, the one time I ordered a slice of pizza with meat on it - they take a handful of COLD meat put it on an already cooked cheese slice, add a little more cheese and stick it in the oven for a minute. This does not cook the meat or melt the cheese. ONLY go here for on the go cheese slices.

My fianc√© and I rarely have a day off together, but this Saturday we did, so we headed out to Colonial area.  We aimed to make it here around opening at 9.  We live on Interstate 4 which you never know about so, it was more like 9:10 when we got here.  The place was pretty easy to find.  It is right off Colonial at Primrose.  It is behind Einstein's Bagel.  The building is lime green and it has a private parking lot. \\nThere was nice woman outside the restaurant who told us that they had reached their line capacity inside and so they were starting a line outside.  She handed us a menu to peruse and gave us some recommendations.  They have a standard specialties menu that they always have and then they run some extra specials on the weekend.  I was torn between the Three Pigs and the Seventh Trimester.  The three pigs had bacon, sausage, egg, and a biscuit with sausage gravy and a side of grits.  The 7th trimester is bacon, eggs, biscuit, sausage gravy, and mac n cheese.  They both sounded awesome.  I didn't end up getting either.  \\nWe were outside about 5 minutes and then moved inside. \\n My fianc√© was very upset that so many things had pimento cheese as he doesn't typically like pimento cheese.  The lady out front told us it was homemade and I actually like pimento cheese, but  neither of us ended up getting it.  I thought I had my mind made up, but when we got to the counter I saw they had a quiche of the day with cheese, bacon, and chives.  I love quiche so that is what I ordered.  The man ordered the platter which came with eggs, sausage, biscuit, and grits.  He ordered a side of sausage gravy ($2), and a side of bacon ($2).   It was about $30 for the two of us to have breakfast here, so on the pricey side, but not unreasonable.  They gave us a # and we went and found a seat.  \\nThey have fountain sodas, but unusual ones, not coca cola or pepsi products.  I had their orange blossom iced tea and I really had trouble making up my mind on this, but in the end decided I didn't really like it.  \\nThe set up of the restaurant has lots of large group tables and only a few smaller ones.  There were no small tables available at the time, so we sat at one end of the one of the larger family style tables.  The table could probably hold 8-10 people, but there were 3 couples at our table.  Us at 1 end, another couple in the middle, and another at the other end. \\n Our food was brought out to us and man did it look good!  The portions are very large.  We could have shared something, but it took us so long to get here.  We wanted to try some different stuff.  My quiche was so good.  I just got back from France and it was better than some ( though not all) of the quiche I had there.  I was definitely larger than any quiche I had ever had.  The crust wasn't too thick and it was very flaky.  It came with a mixed green salad which was so simple I don't understand how they made it so good.  All it was made of was mixed greens, oil, vinegar, salt and pepper, but man oh man.  I can't believe how much salad I ate!  There has got to be some secret spice they use.  \\nMy fianc√© loved his food as well.  He was so glad he ordered the side of sausage gravy.  It was his favorite thing. He was ready to just eat it with a spoon.  The bacon was a little done for my taste, but I'm the weirdo who likes floppy bacon.  \\nNow, the grits we had a difference of opinion on.  I thought they were spectacular.  They were creamy and just had this lovely hit of cheddar and chive to them.  He thought they were boring and a bit bland.  I love grits.  He's only so so about them, so keep that in mind.  I took the grits and half my quiche home and shared with my mother (that's how much food we had), she confirmed my love of the grits.  \\nFinally, they had a baked goods section that I didn't even get to because we ordered large breakfast, but they had a sweet corn cookie that I wanted to try, a signature cookie bar that looked delicious, and I'm pretty sure I need some \\"crack\\" pie in my life.  I should've gotten some to go.  Why did I talk myself out of it?!\\nI want to come back and try the 7th trimester and/or 3 pigs, but this place is pretty far from me, so I don't know when I will, but dang it was so good I have to figure out a way, besides, I didn't even get to the desserts!"},{"name":"Nappi's Restaurant","address":"370 Salem St","city":"Medford","stars":"4","text":"What a greatest BYOB place!

While the wood fire makes for a yummy pizza bottom, the pizza lacked in both size and quantity of ingredients. Each pizza is $10 and comes in a box you would see for smalls/personal pans. Needless to say, it was a bit disappointing. We had the:\\n\\n18. CARBONARA.

It also lacked any substantive amount of sauce. The Hulk, while an interesting combination, seemed to have less ingredients than a garden salad.

Customers must arrive between 9:30 a.m. and 10:00 a.m. (or thereabouts) to get in line (which invariably will have already formed) and wait for the door to open at 11:00 o'clock.\\n  \\nThen, depending on where people are in line, they must cross their fingers or pray that Franklin's doesn't close because the food has run out (which, on most days, is seemingly around 1 o'clock).\\n  \\nOn the day of my visit, I counted about one hundred people ahead of me when I arrived at 10:30 a.m.  With the ferocious Texas sun beating down even at that hour and without any breeze to speak of, the wait was harsh but made more bearable by the shade provided by the building itself, a hostess coming around to sell cold drinks, and the inevitable banter and conversation that occurs between cohorts in line.\\n\\nWhen I finally ordered and got my food at around 12:15 p.m., I cannot remember having built up a greater sense of anticipation and having waited longer for any food than I did for Franklin's famed Bar-B-Q.\\n\\nPost meal, let me just say for the record that the brisket and ribs were very moist.  If nothing else, Aaron Franklin, in his meticulous ways, has really nailed this one aspect.  If considering this characteristic alone, the brisket and ribs would be unimpeachably first-rate (as would the sausage).\\n  \\nHowever, in my humble opinion, the intensity of flavor was not there (an omission that was made all the more glaring considering the depth of praise that Franklin's is receiving).  And, so, this lack of intensity, for me, is enough of a hole to compromise Franklin's place in the rarified top tier of Texas Bar-B-Q joints.\\n\\nWithout a doubt, the food is very good.  Make no mistake about that.  When compared to all of the middling places out there that seem to overcook, over-smoke, or consistently serve up clearly average fare, Franklin's unquestionably stands head and shoulders above these wannabes.\\n      \\nBut, having now visited a host of barbecue joints in Central Texas (including some of the most vaunted and storied places), I cannot honestly say that Franklin's demonstratively outperformed any of them or that it clearly separated itself.

I'm not vegan or vegetarian by any means, but every sandwich that I've had at Clover has been a fantastic experience. The chickpea fritter is definitely a favorite of mine, but the blue oyster mushroom sandwich that I had the other day has about the same amount of umami as a steak which, I know, is a bold statement to claim. Their raspberry ale is also absolutely fantastic. I was worried that it would be too sweet or overpowering, but the hint of fruitiness is just right. Don't get me started on their rosemary fries either - absolutely perfection. I could be nit picky and say that they need to be crispier, but at this point, I'm a completely happy camper.

Overall, it's an alright spot for dim sum but I've definitely had much better experiences in both service and taste.\\n\\nDim sum - we ordered a bunch as we wanted to try a bit of everything. Things were reasonably priced and the way to order is either ask for exactly what you're looking for or ask to take something from one of the carts going around. The highlight for me was the pork bun with the sweet bbq like sauce. It was pretty good and tasty. We also ordered the shrimp shumai, and the soup dumplings / xia long bao. The soup dumplings were  alright, they were a little cold and the broth/ soup inside didn't have much flavor to it. The shrimp sum√°is I wish we just had not ordered.

Sounds like there are a couple of different choices in the \\"weird\\" city, but Tatsu-ya seems to get the best reviews. On a recent trip to the area we decided to try it out. \\n\\nFirst thing I noticed is that the store really lives up to it's name. In case you wonder what I mean, Tatsu = stand and ya = store. Of course I know this isn't what the name is meant to mean in this case, but you do stand for a very long time out and inside the shop. \\n\\nThe menu is pretty straight forward. Few choices of broths all built on a Tonkotsu base. Vegetarians are limited to Sundays because that's when they sell their veggie broth. I wouldn't be fooled by their vegetable curry either. It's highly likely that the curry base has animal fat in it unless they changed the ingredients of that Japanese block curry. \\n\\nI was ready to load up so ordered the chashu bowl (basically chinese bbq pork belly on rice)and a bowl of the tonkotsu ramen add menma (bamboo shoots) First of all, the chashu bowl was awesome. Couldn't have asked for something better. Usually this type of dish comes mixed with mayo, but this didn't need it and I'm glad it wasn't an ingredient. Only thing is that it's quite a large portion so you might prefer to just share it with someone. When the ramen came out it looked very good and I was really looking forward to getting to the bottom of the bowl. First taste the soup. Bland, no depth of flavor and overall very disappointing. Noodle check? It would be nice if they would give you a choice of how you want them cooked. I felt mine were undercooked and could have used a couple more minutes in the hot bath. \\n\\nOverall impression - Not worth the wait. I wouldn't go again because you can make better ramen from the fresh noodle packs you can buy at some asian supermarkets. The chashu don was good, but not worth the hour and a half wait. I think the problem was this place was hyped up so much that I expected it to be awesome. Just makes me think that the people who say it's so good may have not had really good ramen? Maybe we just went on an off day? It's definitely the best I've had in TX though. I'm not saying all this just because I lived in Japan for over 7 years.

I don't think so) dancing wildly in front of and opening the doors for incoming and outgoing patrons.  They were having a hell of a lot more fun that I would and, yes, I resent them (slightly) for that.\\n\\nIt needs to be said, first and foremost, that this is a generic Tex-Mex joint just like every other one you've ever been to.  There is absolutely nothing to set it apart.  The menu is the same.  The margaritas are the same.\\n\\nWe waited at the bar for about thirty minutes (just shy of the 35 the kindly hostess had estimated) before the buzzer did its little shimmy.  In that time, I put away two Bacardi (that's as good as it gets at Border Cafe, rum-lovers)-and-diets, getting carded twice (the first one's a compliment, the second is just obnoxious) by the same inefficient bartendress.\\n\\nWhen ordering the second, I encroached on an empty seat (just straddling beside, mind you, and having never considered resting my ass on) and the plus-size companion of the vacater (that should really be a word) gave me a sneer among sneers and informed me that 'somebody's sitting there'.  Ugh.

Then it all went to pot when we were assigned (with a 3-in-1 chance of having a reasonably attractive and thereby entertaining waitress) a woman of at least forty-seven years.  She may have grandchildren.  I respect that she needs to earn a living but -- come now -- three young men (and one an handsome as Rune) pulling Grandma?  They need a better system.\\n\\nThe entire experience was tainted by the douchebaggery of the Big Man seated at the adjacent table who made a grand scene of paying for his entire party (it's low-end Tex-Mex, pal) and by the a never-ending chorus of roars and shrieks from a crew of over-served jackasses just around the corner.  Bouncer, please?\\n\\nThe food was as expected.  Not good, not bad.

Anyway having read the other reviews it's now pretty obvious that part of the taste I hate so was the lard (i.e., animal fat) in the beans (and rice??) that despite going on at length to the waiter about the fact my wife and I are strict vegetarians seems not to have sunk in. I would have picked this up sooner but I have been vegetarian for 21 years so my memory of what cheap animal fat tastes like has faded over the years.\\n\\nBTW: In terms of food quality ANY Mexican restaurant I have eaten in: super-cheap Border towns, expensive San Monica hideouts, strip mall diners in Phoenix, a super-neuvo-place in Tucson, have all be vastly superior to this place, and actually not much more expensive (or much cheaper).

I mostly ate chicken feet although it felt a little rubbery. The flavor was still good. I also had the century egg porridge; I had to add soy sauce to it. It seems like most of my party had to add soy sauce to most of their dishes because lack of flavor. Next best thing for me is the pork buns. I stopped eating when one person found paper and lint embedded inside the flour wrap of her shrimp rolls or whatever they are called. \\n\\nThere wasn't anything special here. Average foods.\\n\\nService\\n\\nMost of the people only spoke Chinese. We had to ask for the soy sauce. They did not cut some of the dishes for us (we were a group of 6).

Don't get me wrong, the other two were still decent, I just probably wouldn't eat them again.\\n\\n18, you say?!? Surely there aren't that many sandwiches on their menu?? Well, no - they rotate seasonally, even weekly. Clover's menu almost never looks the same from day to day. To me, that admittedly is part of the appeal. I also love that they strive to make their food environmentally friendly and local and as unprocessed as they can. They even bake their own pita nowadays - heck yeah.\\n\\nThe only reason they get four stars instead of five is that their sandwiches can differ dramatically in density, so to speak, yet most have the same price. Some, like the chickpea fritter, are STUFFED and will leave you full for hours; some don't offer the same bang for the buck - for example, the Maine winter tomato I tried two years ago was just tomatoes, fried seaweed, and mayo, yet cost the same as the aforementioned chickpea fritter.

Overall,  if you're really in the mood for sushi at Citywalk,  it's not a bad choice.

We were not disappointed! Got there too early, so we went to CoCo's & grabbed a couple bubble teas, and drank that while we waited in the queue... actualy the queue was rather fun, we talked to other folks and compared reviews of local eateries. \\n\\nOK! They open and the owner greets you warmly at the door, the waitstaff is super friendly, the whole vibe is very welcoming! The decor is fresh, clean, and trust me... you gotta see the bathrooms before ya leave, even if ya don't have to \\"go\\", just have a look :)\\n\\nSo we order our food at the counter & they bring it out to you when ready. We opted for the large communal table, since there were only 2 of us, and again, I really love communal tables as I like to chat with other diners :)  \\n\\nNow for the food... I ordered the \\"Original\\" and a Katsu slider. OOOOH that slider, to die for... absolutely delicious. And it comes with potato salad. I'm real picky about my potato salad, I do like all kinds of variations on it, but there is a \\"certain way\\" that I really love it. They do it JUST the way I love it! The Katsu slider was ooooh so delish! The waiter warned us to watch out, it's hot & juicy and the first bite may be a zinger, so I let it cool a little & was not disappointed, it was so juicy & good!\\n\\nThe Soup was to dream about, very much comfort food! Broth was like ambroisa to my soul. The noodles were perfect, just al dente enough but not too hard and certainly not too soft.

If I were rating on food alone: four stars!\\n\\nSo how did they get two stars? \\n\\nTasty Burger is right by Fenway Park. We were a party of two on a busy game day trying to grab a bite before heading to the gate. We were fortunate enough to be seated quickly, but waited a solid ten minutes for service. Now, it was not the fault of the waitstaff. Since I had plenty of time to observe the situation, I could see one expediter who just brought out sodas, and two waitresses who had to sit guests, wait tables, and clear them as well. On a Saturday game day? That is poor management. Extreme understaffing. Strike 1.\\n\\nUpon further observation, I noticed a guy at an adjacent table pull a hair out of his burger that must have been 10 inches long! Of course the poor waitress was mortified, apologetic, and offered a new one. He was not having it. I don't blame him. Strike 2.\\n\\n(I know you're thinking \\"why stay?\\" There's more)\\n\\nI go to the bathroom, it's a single person at a time, which is fine.

Technically Strike 3!\\n\\n...but there was only 20 minutes until the start of the game and we were starving. So we stayed.

We went on a busy Saturday morning around 10AM, but it wasn't too big of a deal for us because we posted up at a nearby coffee shop (go check out Heart Roaster!) They will only seat you if your whole group is there, so don't wander too far while waiting. ;D\\n\\nWith the warmer weather, the patio was perfect for our group of seven. Looking at pictures, I expected large portions and so I split the following with two of my friends:\\n\\n-Fried Chicken and Waffles - Screen Door's claim to fame, this dish comes with a large waffle topped with three thick pieces of fried chicken. There's just something about the seasoning of the chicken that makes my mouth water. The waffle itself was pretty sweet, so I didn't even have to use the syrup. We ended up taking some of it home and it tasted just as good later! \\n\\n-Banana Foster French Toast - For someone who likes both sweet AND savory breakfast foods, it just made sense to order the French toast. This dish came out with four thick slices topped with bananas and vanilla custard. I loved that it was just sweet enough to balance out the savory taste of the chicken and waffles, but it wasn't cloying and heavy. \\n\\n-Cheesy Grits - I expected the grits to be a lot cheesier, but I actually liked that it was lighter in taste. :) \\n\\nSplitting the trio of dishes amongst the three of us, it ended up being roughly around $12 per person. Not too bad for brunch, if I say so myself!

I got a Groupon for this place as that helps me get out to try new places and this one is one of the best in Boston. I started with 2 single ribs and when the waitress put the plate down on the table, it reminded me of the opening of the Flinstones TV show, where Fred and Wilma are at a drive-in and when the waitress pops the ribs onto their car, the car tips over becausse of the size of the ribs.These ribs were huge and came with little to no sauce on them, which is the way I like em. The meat on the ribs almost fell off the bone and I was quite impressed with them too. Then my pulled pork platter with cole slaw and collard greens showed up and I realized at that point i was gonna need a take home box,as there was no way I could eat all that food..I am not a small guy, so I finish many a meal, but I knew it wasn't gonna happen today..The pork arrived like the ribs, with very little sauce, and this allows me to add some to suit my tastes.

But, in the spirit of being a team player, and because I was literally the last person in my department to have tried it, I went along.\\n\\nI ordered the doner kebab lunch sandwich without any meat with the spicy yogurt sauce and fries.  I knew, given what I had heard and the company I was in, I would be receiving a huge amount of flack for this...which I did, from both my fanatical meat eating coworker and our server.  And, I have to say, getting flack for not being a big meat eater from big meat eaters gets old really quickly.  So, while I think they often feel they're being charming, they're not.  And, suffice it to say that I docked them some points on my review as a result of the server giving me grief about no meat.\\n\\nWhat I had was tasty--a little bland but I'm not really holding that against them since I went to a place that's well known for their meat and didn't get any (my sandwich had lettuce, cucumber and yogurt sauce).  The decor is a bit cold but the staff does seem friendly, aside from their heckling me for my veggie sandwich.  I can't say that I would go back but that has more to do with the focus of the food rather than my experience."},{"name":"Wrights Gourmet Sandwich Shoppe","address":"5482 Chamblee Dunwoody Rd","city":"Dunwoody","stars":"4","text":"The Chicken club sandwich completes my soul.

Lots of interesting things to look at on the wall while you wait for your food. The menu itself is great, albeit slightly overwhelming. I ended up settling on the Beano and Zippity Zam. Both were great, especially the Zippity Zam. If you can get anything with Sriracha or cream cheese, do it. I also got the cheese fries, which were generously covered with gobs of cheese. To end, we got the Funnel Fries, which were your typical funnel cake, but in fry form! Overall, Frank's was very good with a few reservations.

We arrived on a Wednesday at around 6:30 and thankfully, the line was just barely out the door. Considering that the line usually ends up somewhere over at DinHo, this is great news! It took about 30 minutes to get to the front and order and we had more than enough time to figure out what we wanted. \\n\\nThere are about 4 choices for the ramen: Orignal, Tonkatsu Sho-yu, Tonkatsu Miso hot or not. I went with the orignal and the bf went with the mi so not. The seating is very limited so be prepared to be split from your party or sit in an uber cramped area, if you're unlucky. It took about 15 minutes for the noodles to come out piping hot. \\n\\nWhoa, let me tell you. The broth is full of creamy goodness, the pork is actually pork belly, and the noodles are thin and straight, unlike other ramen places. The flavors of it all was just...pure awesome-ness. The bf's miso tonkatusu was actually pretty darn good, considering I'm not the biggest miso ramen fan. It was creamy but still held that distinct miso flavor. \\n\\nI loved it! It's super hard to find a decent ramen joint in Austin and I think this is going to be my go to ramen place in town. Also, my bowl was about $8.50 and the bf's around $9.50, which are really good prices for good tasting ramen. The restaurant is very new so the line is expected, especially with all the buzz around it, but I think I'll wait till the lines die down a bit before I visit again. The ambience of the place is very Japanese trendy and the restroom is probably the frickin' coolest ever (guilty, I stood there and snapped a bunch of pics to Instagram). If you want to try some of the best ramen in Austin, head on down.

The menu is large, but easy to navigate. I had the Original with an added spice bomb (do this!). We ordered the Brussels sprouts and the spicy edamame as well. I will go on a limb here and say both of these sides were some of the best I have had in Austin. Incredible. The ramen arrived in a giant bowl and was perfect and steaming and again, exceeded my expectation. The pork belly and the mushrooms were generous and tasty. We have eaten ramen in a lot of places but found this place to be superior. Word to the wise, go hungry. We were stuffed. AND! Take your own Tupperware or leftover-carrying device.

After 25 minutes of shivering, it arrived.\\n\\nLet me say this--I appreciate a big portion size.  But this was absurd.  There must have been 3 lbs of chicken breast (no dark meat?) piled on a single, lonely waffle.  The portion was enough for 3 people, and the ratio of chicken to waffle was all wrong.  The waffle was delicious, but the chicken itself was a bit too salty.  The breading was nicely spicy, but it fell off the meat at the gentlest touch and quickly became water-logged.  The salad was tasty but over-dressed and covered in too much cheese.\\n\\nThe whole restaurant seemed to be an homage to excess.  This is fine, but please don't confuse quantity for quality.

The mac n cheese is so rich, you can take 2 bites max - has to be made with cream. The cabbage had a hunk of ham in it. The field peas and butter beans were my favorite, but again, you really taste the butter ( not a bad thing if everything else wasn't so rich!). My husband had the pork shoulder which he is going to call about - it was all grizzle and fat. I got the quail which seemed a bit undercooked. Our friend's fried chicken was overly fried, dark, and spicy. The wine list is very small and most glasses are $15, a bit high to me. We were not impressed.

He told me that he always gets the same thing (1/4 bird and Mac and cheese) every time he comes, because it is just so good! So I decided to try it. Because of the time (they were about to close) they had run out of chicken; they only had 1/2 bird left instead of 2 1/4 birds (our order). (Sad face) so that meant that on of us wasn't getting the chicken. My friend was so kind to let me have it. The sweet woman who took our order opted that my friend try something else (her recommendations) and was extremely apologetic, so he did. To compensate for the inconvenience, she gave us both 2 free slices of sweet potato pie and refunded my friend money for his chicken order. We were able to sit down and enjoy the food and music without feeling rushed. When it was closing time, we did ask for to-go boxes so they could close (out of respect). The employees were very nice and attentive.\\n\\nThe prices are great for all of the menu items, and you get a lot of food! The chicken was very juicy and tender, the Mac and cheese was pretty good!

My shrimp-stuffed tofu was nothing of the sort but rather a soupy mess of burnt hard tofu pieces with no shrimp in sight. Now, I have ordered the aforementioned in the past and it was quite good, however it seems on this occasion the chef decided to give me the end of the night's scraps rather than just say the kitchen was closing and he/she couldn't fill my orderl. To make matters worse, they overcharged me and when confronted about it said they would give me a \\"discount\\", which took my bill to the price it should have been originally--plus 20 cents.

Soul Fires's ambiance displays artwork depicting many soulful musicians and aside from the decor, they have affordable BBQ delights to please any meat eater.\\n\\nDepending on your appetite, you can get their monster sampler platter, which can easily stuff 2-3 people or you can get items off their appetizer or sides menu. This most recent visit consisted of a corn dog, collard greens and some cornbread. The corndog was a bit on the small side for my liking, but everything else was fine. \\n\\nOther times I've been here and have gotten the baby back ribs, yum! They have several BBQ sauce varieties, from tangy to somewhat spicy to sweet, depending on your tastes. \\n\\nI've also been here for wing night. The wings are good but I realized I can't personally eat enough to justify the cost. Not that it's all that expensive at $8-9 (can't remember exact price), but per wing I'm better off not going on the all you can eat route, my friends, on the other hand, were elated. Yes, they were boys. \\n\\nI've been here many times. Sometimes with one other person, sometimes with around 15 people. They are very accommodating, but if you have large groups, it's always beneficial to arrive early to stake out the big table in the back.\\n\\nThey have a projector where they will show different games which can be fun with a big group.\\n\\nParking can be tough, especially on Harvard itself. If it's late enough, Comm Ave should have some decent parking. Best bet it to take the T or bus. \\n\\nThey are also on LevelUp, a smartphone app that allows you to pay via your phone.

I spent a lot of money with the sides and I have to say it was a tragic let-down.  The only reason why I'm giving it a 2 star is the sides were very good.  Mac-n-cheese and stew are worth the wait.

I had to ditch the top so it wasn't all bread. The porto itself was bland and smothered in goat cheese. The fries had a nice crispy texture but were way too salty. My husband ordered the tacos, and was surprised by the lack of usual toppings that one expects to find on a taco. There were three soft shells, a scant amount of salsa, chicken (which was overdone and dry), and cole slaw--yes, that's right, cole slaw. We make tacos at home that are 10 times better with toppings like cheddar cheese, avocado or guacamole, onion, salsa, lettuce, tomato, etc. Bottom line, if you just like good beer on tap, we'd recommend Wild Horse for drinks.

You can tell this is real a local spot and saw many families here, even one big group celebrating a birthday. It feels more intimate than the blocks of Italian restaurants in the North End. Anthony was our waiter and was quick to share the specials as well as his recommendations for us. We started with an appetizer special of burrata (very fresh and perfect texture) and grape tomatoes garnished simply with fresh basil and quality olive oil. My boyfriend ordered a special that had 2 decent sized lobster tails cooked very well over fresh pasta and I had the bolognese with deliciously delicate hand made pappardelle pasta. We enjoyed the food very much and it was as good as anything we'd find at home in Brooklyn, NY. The price and atmosphere is great as well.\\n\\nI have to mention how great Anthony was when he learned it was our first visit to Boston.

The brisket was amazingly moist, delicious, and flavorful. I was pretty much in heaven when I had the first bite of brisket. The sausage was probably one of the better sausages I had. My friend said the sausage was his favorite since he was pleasantly surprised. The sausage had this somewhat nice and smooth and very seasoned spiced to it. It was delicious! And the ribs were good. At first bite, I felt like the ribs were okay but once I start eating the rest of it, it definitely got better. \\n\\nThe three bbq sauces they had out were fun to try. One was more smoky and robust, the other was more vinegar-y, and the last one was like any tangy bbq sauce. The latter two were my favorites. \\n\\nDo I wish the wait was faster? OF COURSE.

Se7en Bites is among that 1%. It's no wonder there was long line of customers waiting outside 10 minutes before the restaurant opened. \\n\\nI HIGHLY recommend trying the 7 Bowl (Bowl of Nonsense). Also, the biscuits and cheesy grits are an absolute MUST order.\\n\\nOne thing to note: Don't be surprised if you need a nap after breakfast/brunch, the food is rich.

So yes, those other choices will be in our future and soon.\\n\\nThe only negative to DeSano's, the AC was crank so low that it was uncomfortably cold and even our piping hot pizza got cold before we were able to finish.

Hand cut and crispy, just how a fry was meant to be. During happy hour, the foster burger is only $5!! But we wanted to try the kiwi... All in all, fosters is a must for anyone in the Portland area!!"},{"name":"Jalapenos","address":"1277 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"I cannot fathom the mixed reviews on this place. I'm eating leftovers even as I type, re-living last night's utterly satisfying feast.\\n\\nThe food is absolutely delicious and the massive portion sizes make it an absurd value for the money. Our waitress recommended two excellent entrees - the Tampiquena, a char grilled steak with a cheese enchilada, and the Poblano Chimichanga, an enormous fried burrito covered in a white poblano cream sauce.\\n\\nGood Mexican restaurants often have steak-house quality steaks at absurdly reasonable prices, and Jalapenos is no exception. Just try to get a 10-oz steak this good anywhere else for under $18. It was so juicy and tender with just the right amount of fat. And the Chimichanga was a daunting mass of lovely shredded beef and rice with a decadent cheesy sauce. It's fantastic and at least two meals worth of food for $14. How anyone can complain about the prices here boggles my mind - unless you really can't tell the difference between quality ingredients and the unidentifiable slop you get at any of the monotonous takeout burrito places all over town.\\n\\nMy only qualm with the Poblano Chimichanga is that it comes only with rice, no black beans. But happily, the steak dish came with a large enough portion of beans for both of us. The beans here are wonderful, with a thick texture and just the right level of spice.\\n\\nI was a little disappointed that most of the margaritas are not authentic. They're made with a homemade sour mix that they seem very proud of. I'm sure it's fine, but I just hate mix. Fortunately, the Grand Gold margarita is mix free - deliciously tart, huge and packs quite a punch. Another excellent value.\\n\\nDessert was also delicious. I'm not much of a tres leches fan in general, but this version won me over. It had a gooey sauce that gave it a unique cinnamon-y, french toast-y flavor. Yum.\\n\\nI worry that this place will fail due to location. I think it's going to get too many college kids and inexperienced diners who don't know what to make of a more upscale Mexican restaurant - who think Anna's is the standard for burritos and can't really grasp the concept of paying more for quality. It really isn't appropriate to compare this place with a takeout burrito joint - I'd put it up against Casa Romero and other more upscale places in the city. Jalapenos is more casual, but the quality is comparable. And the prices blow the others away.\\n\\nSo big thumbs up, we will return often. Hopefully this place gets the right kind of crowd and can survive in college/takeout land. Great addition to the area."},{"name":"Lily's Sandwich","address":"10901 N Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Ok, maybe I'm easy but if you give me a hearty, tasty banh mi for $2.25, you'll have to mess up pretty badly for me NOT to give you a five-star review.

The owner, Dino (aka Paul's son), is often there pouring (the great) coffee and is always attentive. When it comes to breakfast, the details always make or break a place for me, as I have \\"particular\\" tastes. For example, I hate running out of jam for my toast, but Paul's serves their jam in little cups and you can ask for as many as you desire. Never-ending jam! SWEET (literally and figuratively)! The wait staff are always sure to ask if you would like their homemade hot sauce too, which I appreciate. Other highlights: sourdough AND marble rye, fancy lavatories, and the choice of milk or cream with your coffee.\\n\\nPaul's is on the borderline of being pricey. Vancouver restaurants believe that breakfast must be on equal standing with the other meals of the day in terms of quality, complexity and price. Due to this pretentious and unworldly practice, it is very difficult to score a decent breakfast for under $8.00. What ever happened to the $2.99 bacon n' eggs? Where did the classic 2-2-2 for $6.00 go? Even a visit to America's corporate, not-so-greasy spoon, Denny's, will set you back $10.00 per person. Paul's has some reasonable options; for example, their two-egg breakfast is $5.00 and their satisfying breakfast bagel is $6.50. Having said this, their omelettes are all $9.95 and their larger courses are also around the $10.00 mark.\\n\\nLike an addict, I go out for breakfast often in Vancouver. I just can't resist the temptation of having someone bring me endless coffee, cholesterol-imbued protein, and buttered toast on those uneventful, groggy mornings. But I sure am getting sick of paying blue chip prices for blue plate meals."},{"name":"Tasty Burger","address":"1301 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"When did this place open? Walking down Boylston in Fenway recently, we noticed that what was formerly an old gas station is now a souped-up, diner-style burger joint within a block or two of Fenway Park.\\n\\nThat said:\\n-The organization of the place is weird. There wasn't a host(ess) waiting inside the door to seat us, nor was there a sign that told us to seat ourselves. The result was that we stood awkwardly for a few minutes while we waited for a table to open up. We were noticed quickly by a waitress once we sat down, but not before then.\\n-Burgers were reasonably-priced, the sides were huge (and only $3 or $4), and they had a respectable (if small) beer selection.\\n-The food itself was good, although not great. The food cost about the same amount as it would at Friendly's, and it was definitely better than Friendly's, but that doesn't exactly make for a catchy slogan.\\n\\nBottom line is that there wasn't really anything to distinguish it from Boston's other burger joints (Uburger, b.good, etc.), and in some ways it actually came up a little short. It's new, so they have some time to improve, but I probably won't go out of my way to return."},{"name":"Sonsie","address":"327 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I've been to Sonsi several times.

I had the Siamese Ciapirinha, which had a spicy Serrano pepper.  It was perfectly spicy on the back end and I loved it.  I love a spicy cocktail!  My second cocktail i ordered was the Le Fin Du Fin and it was lightly sweet as it had pear infused green chartreuse, cognac, maraschino liqueur and lime juice ... it was delicious! \\n\\nOn appetizers our table ordered quite a bit as there were 16 of us.  I chose the lamb tiki masala, but there were the fried boudain, escargot, fries, kimchi fried rice and popcorn.  My favorites that I tasted were the lamb tiki masala and kimchi fried rice.  I felt like the boudain was lacking some spice and flavor as well as the popcorn.  The popcorn I thought was just plain popcorn - boring.\\n\\nFor my main entree I ordered the steak and frits.  The steak was ok and a bit chewy for my liking.  The fries were not impressive either.  Overall I think the feeling from the table was ok.  Some definitely liked it more than others.  I was kind of expecting more from Mettle.  Maybe their brunch is better than dinner? If the cocktails had not been so delicious - 2 stars, and if the service had sucked - 2 stars.

It had the best pop as you bit into it and a delightfully Smokey, salty savoury flavour- divine. Order the ribs too, nuff said. Try the sides too. It's all worth it.

I stand at the bar, in the back.  There were 3 bartenders standing around talking.  I watched as one (he was bald headed is all I can describe him as) sticks his index finger into his mouth to the hilt and picks around on his teeth for about 30 seconds.  It was a good long time.  He sees me, pulls his finger out of his mouth sending spit spraying in several directions, and without making any attempt to wash his hands, asks me what I want.  I told him flat out, \\"you just had your finger all the way in your mouth picking your teeth, I don't want anything from you.\\"   The other two bartenders are looking at me like I have 3 heads as though they don't understand why I would not want someone with a ton of his spit on his finger and hand to serve me with his unwashed hand. I swear to God that the bartender's finger was glistening with his spit. One of the other bartender asked me what I want.  I tell him what I observed the other bartender do, and based on that, was leaving and wanted nothing and would never go back there ever again.  The two other bartenders saw this bartender with his finger in his mouth to the hilt too as he was talking to them while he was swishing his finger around in his mouth.

We decided to make a reservation for our anniversary on a Saturday night, then moved the time up the day of to make sure we got to try the burger. I'm glad we did - they had sold out before 7:30! \\n\\nThe service we received was excellent - we were seated the moment we arrived, treated with on-the-house celebratory Cava since I had mentioned our anniversary when making the reservation, and our waiter was happy all night to answer questions about the menu or the restaurant. This was absolutely the first restaurant I've ever eaten in for two hours without getting a not-so-subtle indication to free up the table for somebody else. Our waiter encouraged us to order one plate at a time (it's a tapas place, so small plates yet BIG on flavor and more filling than you'd expect) and we were really able to savor the food and enjoy our date.\\n\\nThe drinks: unique-but-not-oddly-so cocktails were pretty tasty. Beer and wine selections were also good. \\n\\nThe food: delicious. I wanted to eat nearly everything on the menu, but refrained largely as an excuse to go back again. Some items change weekly to feature seasonal foods, but I would highly recommend the burger, mesquite tortellini, pork belly, and corn pancakes. The burger we split (this could be a meal itself, which is good for the wallet on future occasions) and it totally lived up to the hype. The pork belly was good on its own but a masterpiece when paired with the strawberries that came on the side. The tortellini didn't look like your typical tortellini but packed a lot of flavor into each bite - garlicky, fresh, and just the right amount of cheese. Had we not eaten several plates before this came, we would have ordered another on the spot. The pancakes were served with yogurt and maple syrup smeared on the plate and grilled peppers and popcorn on top. I enjoyed these by alternating bites of sweet (with syrup and yogurt) and savory (with peppers). \\n\\nWe also tried the grilled carrots, the grilled Haloumi cheese, and a special that night of beef heart Tartare. The carrots were tasty but overshadowed by the flavors of everything else that followed, and while the cheese was tasty there was not much on the plate. I was skeeved by the concept of the Tartare so I passed, but my husband found it...interesting. We weren't really the audience for this dish but wanted to give it a try. \\n\\nOn other Yelpers' reviews we skipped dessert, which was fine since we were full of awesome tapas.

Weird that I never really noticed this take out place before. \\n\\nI ordered the curry beef and honey garlic pork. Curry was alright, not too spicy, but was not authentic Chinese.

Best cheap and authentic curry is hands-down No. 9,  Parker Place Food Court (that curry fish ball place) or Honolulu (Main Street - which is now closed)\\n\\nThe honey garlic pork (boneless) was heavenly the first bite, but each bite became sweeter and sweeter after that.

Hey Cupcake offers a standard set of 8 flavors. We ordered 2 sweetberry, 1 standard, and 1 double dose.  I did enjoy the sweetberry frosting, but that is where it ended for me. The cake was VERY dense (maybe that it's what you are paying for..?..?)  My husband said the double dose was good. My four year old almost finished the standard. My two year old did not care for his sweetberry, so we ordered him a vanilla dream, which he only picked at.  I sampled his leftovers and the vanilla cake was also heavy.

We enjoyed the laid back vibe and personal attention. Our waitress was great and the manager even came to our table to say hello and ask how our dining experience was. My only complaint is that the omelette was small and so were the little biscuits. It's definitely not enough to fill you up. They should offer potatoes or hash browns with the omelette, especially considering all that was included with my meal, and for the same price. Hubby was still hungry after that omelette! lol.

You know, much as I love this place, I'm always a little disappointed with the non-brunch food.  It's the kind of restaurant where you WANT to be inspired by the menu and then have a rough time with all the yummy choices, but instead I find myself always wishing that some sandwiches could share ingredients or some salads were a smidge more thrilling.  The spinach dip, for example, should, as a melty bowl of cheese, be infinitely tasty, and yet no matter now many times I order it, it's never not disappointingly bland.  The same can be said for the nachos, fries, and chocolate mousse.  I mean, the tasteless guac comes impaled with a tasteless piece of cucumber.  What's up with that?\\n\\n2. Great beer list, hands down.  All the good stuff on tap, any kind of mixed drink you could fancy, and since the ambiance itself is equal parts English pub and New Hampshire ski lodge (the fireplace is deliciously toasty in the winter), and since I live just around the corner, it's pretty much my favorite default watering hole.

The ramen ranges from $8.50 to $15 (special). I order the Tonkotsu Sho-Yu & Ramen Special - Staff pick: Alex - Original. The toppings (egg, chashu pork, menma bamboo) was so delicious. If you want extra toppings they range from $.50 to $3.00. Their egg was half cooked and a little runny but it well with the ramen. The favorite part of the entire meal were the ramen noodles. The texture and density was perfect and not too soft or overcooked. Food portion is the right amount so you don't become super-stuff.

I raved about how I loved RA to my friend it was late night and had just got off work so we came here. I checked the hours to make sure we had enough time to eat. We arrived at 10:45 pm and left at 12:20 am. Jill was our waitress she had came over asked for drink orders I ordered a water and she left without asking my friend for her order which she was having alcoholic drinks that night. She dropped off the water and said she would be right back and she had to drop off another tables food. Long story short we ordered appetizers finished both of them and still hadn't placed our entree order. The food was great reason why this post got any stars, once our food came out we asked for wasabi and sriracha waited for a while never came out mind you the restaurant was closed bar stools were up and we were waiting to eat. The bartender came over and helped us out, thank goodness! He was happy to help us out. If I come back I will be sitting at the bar for faster service rather than a table. We were pleased with the food and the quality, the server started to come over and talk to us more once we were closing out. The first thing I said when we got there was I wanted the creme br√ªl√©e for dessert, but that didn't happen because the service was too slow, everybody was gone by the time I was ready for it. Even my friend said \\"I really want to like this place, but the service is so bad\\" and \\"the worst service I think I've ever had\\".

The ambience was lovely, the staff was stellar, and I had no problems with the cleanliness or decor.  I think the biggest problem that I could pinpoint is that the cooking at Art Bar tends to stand out the simpler the food is, and their dishes can get overcomplicated.  Let me break it down with three very different experiences:\\n\\nNight One: I hadn't eaten all day and wanted a nice meal, without having to leave the hotel (it had been a long day).  I popped down to Art Bar and decided to go for their Restaurant Week offerings.  FIrst of all, the service was fabulous.  My waiter, Matt, was incredibly attentive and charming, which made the meal all the better.  My appetizer was the Heirloom Tomato and Buffalo Mozzarella Napoleon, which was slightly disappointing - the tomatoes were really mushy, but the balsamic reduction was well done, as was the crostini that accompanied the dish.  The Lobster and Pecan-Crusted Scallops was my entree, and again, I was not overly enthusiastic.  The lobster was tough, and while the scallops were cooked perfectly, the pecan crust was so finely ground that it felt like coffee grounds.  However, the salad underneath was perfectly wilted by the heat of the scallops, and the roasted fingerling potatoes were perfection.  Dessert was advertised as a plum tart, which was sweet, sour, a nice light finish to the meal.  Overall, I wasn't terribly impressed, but I was hopeful for better things.\\nMeal #2 was after a day off, when I decided to partake in their five dollar appetizer selections.  Wanting to keep it simple, I ordered a bowl of their clam chowder and a bowl of mussels in chardonnay and butter.  This was a complete one-eighty from what I had eaten previously.  The clam chowder was smooth, creamy, rich and smoky - absolutely delicious.  The mussels were ideally prepared - not a smidgen of sand, and a broth so tasty that I ate it straight with a spoon, rejoincing when I found cloves of roasted garlic hiding in its depths.  These dishes were simple, unpretentious, and absolutely perfect.  \\nDitto for the final meal I ate at Art Bar - I popped in for a Saturday night cocktail and snack.  The Kobe beef slider was juicy, tender, and packed with flavor, and it came with a side of tarragon sprinkled crispy fries.  Paired with an Electric Lemonade, it was an ideal late night treat.  On both of these occasions, Steven was my waiter, and he was absolutely attentive, friendly and charming.  \\n\\nI don't know if this is a restaurant to drive out of your way to visit, but if you are in the area, skip the Cheesecake Factory and CPK at the mall across the street and stop in to try some of their simpler fare.  It's a choice well worth making."},{"name":"Dirty Frank's Hot Dog Palace","address":"248 S 4th St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"If I could, I would wrap up Dirty Frank's, put it in my pocket and bring it home with me to Cincy.

We woke up at 7:30am to go wait in line, and got our food around 1pm. Franklin's started as a food truck, but quickly evolved into the brick-and-mortar legend that it is known as today (this story is detailed via pictures you can see as you wait in line). \\nA couple things to note if you decide to go to Franklins:\\nBring water! (and shade/seating arrangements/etc. if you decide to go later than 6:30am) Beer is nice to sip on as you wait, but really water is key, especially in the summer. Be friendly with the people you are in line with! This is all a community experience here. Think of Franklin's like camping out, because you'll be doing so for at least 5 hours.\\nBring breakfast, and bring entertainment (i brought a book and a laptop).\\nThe place opens at 11 and they go until they run out of food. \\n\\nEAT SLOWLY when you've finally gotten your food. The last thing a famished stomach needs is a pound of grease within a minute.\\n\\nPros: The food is definitely the best barbecue I have ever eaten. The pull test for brisket: if you hold up a strip and it does not break under its own weight, but comes apart with minimal pulling. The food is a little salty (but i like salty so whatever, and you have bread), but melts in the mouth. Beef ribs were not on the menu panel when I went, but definitely ask if they have not run out of it already! I did, and I was so satisfied. \\n\\nCons: The wait. Because who wants to wait in the sweltering Texas heat? The price. A pound of meat costs around $20, which is a little pricey for this hungry college boy. The grease. Brisket as a cut of meat has lots of fat around it and through it, a lot of which melts during the long cooking process.\\n\\nWhen would I go: if you've never gone before, and if you're willing to wait in line (perhaps another pertinent question: Would I go again? Yes, but the wait and price will keep me at bay for a long while)\\n\\nWhat I like to get: Brisket (in my opinion, the true test of a BBQ joint), and beef ribs (and lots of bread)"},{"name":"Milestone 229","address":"229 Civic Center Dr","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"This place was pretty good.

Did you say Bloody Mary at 11:00 am Sunday morning? And the food is pretty good too. Breakfast is by far my favorite part of the menu. All the good greasy classics, but with a seasonal twist. I definitely recommend the Challah French toast. Actually served with real fruit salad on the side and not that syrupy crap you get other places. The huge raspberry scones are delicious and you can entertain yourself  while you wait for your food with Genus Edition Trivial Pursuit cards that are found on each table.\\n\\nThe dinner and lunch menu is mostly seafood and they have an excellent happy hour .

I knew I wanted to eat some famous Texas BBQ and didn't feel like waiting in a line so we came to the next best place, Stubb's. It was around lunchtime on a weekend and we didn't have to wait at all. Good because I was starving and my mouth watering. I was optimistic and my boyfriend and I each ordered our own platter but we barely made a dent and could have easily shared. We started with the fried green tomatoes which were thick cut and a little on the hard side. But I didn't mind because I don't like my tomatoes mushy anyway. Alight now to the BBQ. I had the angus beef brisket, pork spare ribs, with mac & cheese and serrano cheese spinach. All plates come with a thick slice of texas bread but no one has room for that. The beef brisket had a nice char on some of the end bites which I loved, however somewhat dry. The pork spare ribs were so moist (because of that fat doe) and fall of the bone tender and delicious. I normally love beef BBQ but I am happy I also got the pork because the meats were so different and both worth trying. Mac and cheese was bomb and the serrano cheese spinach was surprisingly out of this world. It had a decent amount of heat but not enough to be unpleasant and ooey gooey it was. So savory and while not guilt free (because that cheese doe) it was worth every indulgent calorie. Stubb's also has it's own barbecue sauce. Which I tried but my meat really didn't need any additional sauce or flavor.

Mine was just a tad, but nothing like the comments I saw suggested.  Mine was just fine for a six day stay.  \\n\\nSome comments ping auto parking.  I could see how that might be an issue with an internal garage and valet parking that did get filled on weekends, but I did not have a car on this visit to deal with that.  \\n\\nThere are also some negative comments on no complementary breakfast.  For the rate I got, I don't care.  The restaurant in the hotel looked very nice, and there are more than ample Starbucks, Wendy's, Denny's, etc just steps away if you don't want to use the hotel restaurant.

Ditto on one of the appetizers. Two out of the three of us ordered something involving tuna, and two out of the three of us got a cut that didn't match the decor, price or hopes for this place. \\n\\nA note about portions: I read some of the reviews for this place and people mentioned their portion sizes.

The burger design of these featured items is creative and tasty.  The buns were a little sub-par --not quite up to the task of not disintegrating under finger pressure or condiment-level moisture.  There is a bakery next door with whom they announce a partnership for one signature burger, and perhaps this relationship needs to expand sooner rather than later.  The patties were moist and juicy, though not particularly flavorful on their own.  A minor quibble: I added a fried egg and never would've expected it to be prepared sunny-side-up by default.

I'm not a huge tater tot eater and had mainly gotten it for my bf to eat but he was lucky to have eaten even 5 of them, they were so delicious! I can't personally vouch but the bf did say he was a fan of the brunswick stew. I was disappointed with the jalepeno cornbread but after slathering on all of the honey butter that came with it, it became edible.\\n\\nCrowd = diverse, ambience = informal, staff = often times MIA."},{"name":"Stubb's Bar-B-Q","address":"801 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"WOW!!!

The bar, decoration, small statues, China glassware and dishes and a heavily stocked bar with every time of brandy, vodka, beer and gin you can think of. We were warmly welcomed at the door by a sweet lady and by Bill, a very kind gentleman that runs the place and certainly knows what he is doing! Bill insisted that we either come today or tomorrow to try out the food, drinks and everything else that is available on the menu for no charge! In a couple of hours my wife and I came back and we were told that they have a full house and that we can wait for an open table at the bar! Usually at restaurants please tend to say that the wait time is around X minutes and then you end up waiting for more! Well this was not the case here! We were told that we would get a table in around 10-15 minutes and in about 12 minutes, Bill personally came over and welcomed us to our table in one of the different beautifully decorated sections ever in the restaurant.

The servers are really sweet people and they would definitely go out of their way to make you feel comfortable. \\n\\nMoving to the best part of the evening, the food and drinks.\\nMy wife had a Mai Thai and I had a Bud Light.

What this place has no shortage of is character, ambiance, and the thrill of feeling like you're in a cool architectural splendor that meshes Old Mexico with an uber-cool industrial/city vibe. However, I can see how others mention No Mas! as growing very cacophonous as the day turns to night. During a weekday lunch, however, the decibel levels were acceptable, and conversation with a normal voice was not an issue.\\n\\nThere was a nice garden variety of Mexican and Tex-Mex items on the menu. Although nothing blew my socks off in terms of spice or outstanding flavor, it was a well-rounded dining experience that would certainly please the masses. I definitely recommend starting your meal with some of their excellent queso dip! One thing I miss about GA is the queso blanco that permeates seemingly all of the Mexican restaurants. The queso pairs wonderfully with the sturdy chips, and you can have it made spicy (or do the peppers on the side) if you wish.\\n\\nOur waiter was VERY nice and took the time to listen, offer suggestions, and definitely worked hard for his gratuity. Our order was delivered really quickly, showing they know how to turn the lunch crowd.  \\n\\nThey do have a lunch-specific menu with nice prices - we opted for a massive lunch burrito with half beef/half chicken for only $8.99; the chicken and beef were both a bit dry and over-cooked, but the tortilla was fresh and the rice-to-bean ratio was well-executed. We also had the Lunch Combo and chose a steak taco and a pork tamale, along with two sauces (Verde and Guajillo) for only $9.99 ($1 upcharge for the steak). Again, the steak was a bit over-cooked, and although the Verde and Guajillo sauces were nice complements to the meats, they could have packed more spice. The tamale was pretty darn good, though.\\n\\nParking was easy for us in their large, private surface lot. It also appears as though they have a lively area for nightlife, as well as a good deal of merchandise to purchase, plus a breakfast cafe.

The bagels themselves are all vegan (except for the Honey Grain and Parmesan), and while they don't offer any non-dairy alternatives to cream cheese they at least have peanut butter and jelly on hand.  I usually go for a Cinnamon Raisin or Baked Apple with peanut butter (on the side) and that totally hits the spot for me - and at just under $2.00, it's quite an affordable lunch, indeed.  The bagels are nothing to write home about but they are what they're supposed to be:  chewy and toasty.  Please note, however, that while most of the bagels are vegan, the \\"softwiches\\" are not:  they contain milk product.\\n\\nThe Fire-Roasted Tomato soup is the only vegan soup the store offers, but it is quite tasty and cheap.

They wound up bringing the check instead which we then said we want to order desert before we pay.  Sort of annoying.  We started the meal with the winter melon and clam soup.  The soup was good with small clam shells in it.  Winter melon is not very flavorfull.. sort of like honeydew only not as sweet.  The broth had grated ginger in it which gave it a nice little kick.  For the meal we ordered basil eggplant, 2 sauce shrimp, and cashew chicken ( boring  I know).  The basil eggplant had a great flavor but was VERY greasy/oily.  The 2 sauce shrimp was apparently just that, shrimp in 2 different sauces and divided by a cucumber wall.  One sauce was basically bland white sauce and the other was a slightly spicy red sauce.  It was decent but wasn't what I was expecting.  The shrimp was fresh though.  I really wanted to order the shrimp with pea leaves but the pea leaves are out of season so says the server.  The 3rd dish was cashew chicken which was not my pick.  It was good and suprisingly not that saucy as it generally is.  The dish also had tons of whole cahsews on it which was suprising giving the normal stinginess of asian restaurants that serve this dish.  When desert finally came we ordered a huge bowl ( didn't know it would be this big) of assorted beans, shaved ice, and mango icecream.

We expected a wait - that's a tough time and a tough day. They said it would be about an hour. We were not looking for an hour, but we figured most places in the area would be similar. We know that an hour is their \\"safe\\" bet, and that often tables come up sooner. At the 30 minute mark, we checked up and they said it was still going to be a while. At 45 minutes, we checked again and no dice. At an hour, we were told they were waiting for one group to finally leave at a certain table. The majority of the group was gone and just one man was left at the table. He was sitting there solo quite a while, and he wasn't looking like he was going anywhere, any time soon. Not long before he got up to leave with his group (apparently they were either in the restroom or just tooling around the place), a group of 10 walked in and were seated immediately. At this point, we threw a small fit. Turns out the table the hostess was directing us to wasn't even close to the place we were to be seated. The manager got us and seated us immediately, as our scene was about to get big. Having 4 hungry tired kids wait an hour to eat is a truly bad situation. \\n\\nFrom this point on, everything was excellent. Our server knew we'd been screwed and waiting for an hour, and he was on point and cordial. He brought us 2 complimentary appetizers for the table to share.

I've been to all the older places around central Texas including Luling and Lockhart, but I believe that the brisket at Franklin BBQ is the best out of all of them. It has the perfect amount of rub and smoke, and it just melts in your mouth. The ribs are pretty top notch too, but I think City Market in Luling has slightly better rib. Then again, why would I drive an hour away to get ribs when Franklin is still pretty damn amazing. The sausage is ok, the casing just doesn't have that kind of snap I enjoy at the Lockhart places, and the grind is a little too fine for my taste. As for the line, if you're not getting there at 10:30, be prepared to wait 30 minutes to an hour. I know it sucks, but Aaron isn't running a huge operation and he likes to take some time to talk to his customers (which I really appreciate. Gotta build up that customer rapport.) He told me he's opening up a real store front sometime soon, so that'll probably fix the waiting problem.

Pick up your food at the bar. Pick up your food at the front counter. Please go back to the bar to pick up your food. As we obediently followed orders, we looked longingly at our pizza box and salads, which were clearly sitting in the pick-up window.

The overabundance of cheese was plasticky and there was so little sauce and green pepper (one of our requested toppings) that it was like eating a lukewarm cheese roll. Other than the hostess, not one staff member attempted to take control of the increasing pick-up line and order mix-up.

The fact that there are rotting pumpkins in the display case when you walk in, and Halloween was 4 months ago, should have been a huge sign to cut our losses and find another place, but my friend and I decided to give it at least a chance. \\n\\nI'm sad to say, our gut instincts were right. We waited for a table to be cleared, even though there were tables available. It seemed like the waitstaff were all over the place, it seemed like no one was in charge making sure tables were cleared, the bathrooms were clean etc...When we left, the waitress at the hostess stand didn't even look up when we said good night.\\n\\nOur waitress was nice but totally clueless. She couldn't tell me what type of squash was being served even after I gave her options (butternut, spaghetti, acorn). She couldn't remember the specials and didn't know the prices of items. \\n\\nThe complementary bread served was nothing special. My friend was so disgusted with the quality of it he asked them to take it away. I ordered the branzini special and was pleasantly surprised, the fish was cooked well and tasty but the spinach was way too salty and the squash was burned. For $24.95, the quality should have been much better.\\n\\nThe decor is a little beat up, knicks in the paint, chipped tiles, the plastic on the menu was cracked and on mine, melted, you can tell this restaurant has been there for a while. It would be nice if they took a few hours and cleaned it, maybe give it a little sprucing up. Perhaps this place was good at one time, but it just felt like it was old and a little rundown.

The atmosphere was not befitting a 'high end' City Walk restaurant.  \\n\\n---\\n\\nSo my roll.  Geisha roll, most expensive roll on the menu.  Most expensive thing on the menu period.  It was garbage and the guy who invented it doesn't understand what sushi is.  The 'marinated cucumbers' on top were marinated in some sort of flavored vinegar.  I couldn't taste ANYTHING but the overpowering pickled vinegar cucumber taste.  Like the stuff they serve in the chinese buffet salad section except tart not sweet.  It was a disgrace.  Taking the cucumber off the roll didn't help because the vinegar soured the delicate light flavor the 'tuna' barely has in the first place.  The rest of the roll was absolutely flavorless.  I can't even remember what was in the roll for this review so I keep having to check the menu description and thinking 'really?'.  I mean, it makes sense, lobster is why it was 26 bucks.  But...really?  If anything, I should be complaining that the tempura shrimp stole the show...but it didn't because I couldn't taste it.  No amount of palate cleansing ginger could fix the bland, tasteless roll/omg so much vinegar roll.  I ended up forcing myself to eat the damn thing because I couldn't stand the idea of wasting that much money and being hungry.\\n\\nFor future reference, I paid $26 bucks to taste the expensive fish not the 20c worth of cucumber and vinegar.  Maybe focus on that with the sushi...the fish.  CowFISH SUSHI burger bar.  Not cucumber vinegar bar.\\n\\nThe eel sauce was good but if I wanted a rice ball dipped in black molasses I would have ordered that.\\n\\nSide note, I went to Publix today and they had some decent looking new style sushi rolls and I picked them up for dinner...100% better and half the cost.  \\n\\nThe other huge rating cut is due to the waiter.  I asked for light ice in my first glass and subsequently asked for no ice afterwards.  To the point that by my 4th glass at least one other person at our table was echoing me 'NO ICE' to the guy and he just straight up ignored me/us.  I ordered sweet tea, not tan water.  I shouldn't have to perform a bartending trick on all my drinks trying to strain the tea out into another glass it's ridiculous.\\n\\nHe switched two people's drinks and they put them the right way and the next time when just one friend needed a refill he reiterated that he ordered a coke and was told 'i know what your drink is' in a tone where you know he said 'bro' in a condescending manner in his head afterwards.  It was just really hostile.  Half the servers looked more irritated than anything.\\n\\nThe decor...when we walked in we saw the kiddie touch wall and then after the flight of stairs it opened up into a beautiful area with all these mermaid/fish scale decorations and just a really cool vibe...then we were sat at a high top in front of what looked like, legit, an old 90's sort of swimming fish screen saver.  It was so cheesy looking and really killed the 'upscale' vibe and took it to some gimmick level.  It was funny to see fish with top hats but again this place offers TWENTY SIX DOLLAR SUSHI with the main highlight of the decor being LOW RES SCREEN SAVERS. \\n\\nNo, I won't get over that.\\n\\nLastly, when I had to use the restroom I had to go up another flight of stairs and the whole stairwell was just...moist...and rancid...they'd obviously just mopped.  On my way back down it was like someone had taken a batch of fries and tossed it down with smashed food all over the steps...it was trashy and dirty looking.\\n\\nI really need to stop looking for sushi in all the wrong places.  Stick to the hole in the wall places for good, authentic sushi."},{"name":"Fat Matt's Rib Shack","address":"1811 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Highly recommend.

We don't eat pork, so, we really did not make a lot of attempts to eat here since their pork ribs are what a lot of people rave about. \\n\\nMy son, who lives in Seattle, was here for a long visit this summer. Since his hunger clock is 3 hours behind ours, we ate at off times while he was here.\\n\\nSo, we were able to go to Fox Bros at off hours with no wait time. We ate there for the first time on 08/09/16.\\n\\nMy husband ordered a beef brisket sandwich. It was delicious, but paled in comparison to the beef short rib my son and I ordered. \\n\\nOther than the steaks at Bones, this beef short rib is the best beef I have ever had the pleasure to eat!  \\n\\nThe beef was so tender and delicious that just biting into it was a wonderful, sensational experience that made my eyes roll back in my head. My son, being a strict meat and potato guy, felt the same way. I have never had another beef rib that has even come close. The bbq sauce, which you add on from the bottles on the table, is also delicious.    \\n\\nSince the beef rib is so large, we both had leftovers to take home. One is large enough for two meals or two people. But it is so good you will not want to share. And it heats up deliciously (don't use a microwave, wrap it up in foil and heat it in a 325 degree oven). \\n\\nThe sides were good, but slim pickings for us since we don't eat pork and most of them have pork in them. My son and I got fried okra and mac & cheese, both were good (I have had better of both, but they were definitely good). My husband had fries and they were also good. When we went back on 11/25/16, again with my son in town, the okra was out of season so I got Cole slaw; it was okay, but nothing special. My husband got the potato salad and I was not a fan; not sure what was in it, but something I didn't like, my husband thought it was okay. \\n\\nThe beef rib is pricey, $35 market price both times we got it, and the other menu items seemed a little over priced as well; $14 for a vegetable plate where most places I've been charge $10-$12. Most items seemed to be priced about 15% higher than other similar atmosphere places.\\n\\nWe will definitely be back, but since the beef rib is so expensive, we won't be able to frequent Fox Bros as much as I would like.

Tried a few items.  The best was the chicken fried ribs appetizer.  They were not greasy and tasty.  Never seen this item on a menu before.  Chicken fried steak, yes, but not ribs, and the dipping sauce was a nice compliment.  The jalape√±o corn bread was also quite good with butter.  The coleslaw was also nicely made - not too drenched and fresh, but nothing unique.\\n\\nHad the combo plate with 4 pork ribs and a serving of chopped brisket.  The meat was well cooked and good quality, with a nice rub.  The only problem with the chopped brisket was there were huge chunks of pure fat in it.  My problem with the ribs was two-fold, but in all fairness they are simply my preference and not their mistake.  And if you don't have these preferences, you will enjoy the restaurant more than I did.  First, the ribs they use are baby back, which are smaller than regular ribs.  I am not a huge fan of baby back ribs.  In the chicken fried version as an appetizer, they were fine.  As the main ribs, I'd prefer the type of ribs usually used in Texas and St. Louis ribs, not baby back.  The other problem was also personal taste.  I liked their sauce.  It's actually good.  The problem is they only have mild.  Every bbq joint should have a mild and spicy version of their bbq sauce.  Not burning hot, but just a spicier version. I know it can be done, cause my regular joint in Los Angeles (Dr. Hogly Wogly's Texas Tyler BBQ) has a sauce that is very similar (though a tad better), and they offer mild and hot.  Once again, if you like baby back ribs just fine and don't want your bbq sauce mild, you would probably rate this a 4 star bbq cause the meat was good (just don't give out globs of fat in the chopped brisket).\\n\\nThe only item I really disliked was the french fries.  They were so damn salty, and I love salt.  Salt is my downfall in life, I love it so much, but these were covered to death in salt.  Also, just FYI, since the place gets so busy (as ATL's top rated BBQ), their meager parking lot is not enough.  There is parking on the side street, but the small lot is a bit of a drag.

The fried rice had large chunks of raw onion tho which ruined the whole thing. \\n\\nThis time I ordered in grub hub and got a massive amount of food for 30$, so not bad. The rice is pretty bland with like 3 small pieces of pork in it. Chicken wings good, crab Rangoon good and chicken fingers ok. Their duck sauce is so sweet tho which is a real turn off for myself, it's not your typical duck sauce. \\n\\nThe boy got lo mein instead of pork fried rice and their noodles are the extremely thin kind. The flavor would be great if they were a tiny bit thicker but that's my personal preference. Kung pao chicken is extra tasty and I remember the general gaus being good too. \\n\\nI might add that I ordered at 8:15, according to grubhub they received the order at 8:21 and it was at my door at8:30 so I'm not entirely sure how freshly made it is but it's decent enough for the price.

Water was placed on the table already in glass bottles (definitely liked that) and drink orders taken promptly. We had to tell the server we would like to order food, though you would think he would have already asked (I was a server for 6 years) us, in the very least of wanting to get the table started to be able to turn it on a weekend night. The mussels were amazing! Big & buttery with delicious broth to soak up with bread. Though the waiter served us one bowl that was wrong, said he would check on it but never came back with the right bowl. The staff there do help out the servers but a few odd things, one guy took our full bowl of shells and never replaced it (we had just started eating & we had ordered 4 different mussel bowls) so we had to ask them for new ones because the plates are appetizer sized. Then with the wonderful broth, they will bring you more bread at request but same guy took forever and forgot once & we had to ask multiple times. Then as we were actually finished and most of our dishes were cleared, we were repeatedly asked (by multiple people) if we wanted more bread! Then as we were trying to get to our concert, it took forever for half of our party to get their second round of drinks and for us to get out bill!

We looked on Yelp like we always do for recommendations and figured we should try out Sojuba since the reviews were great! \\n\\nUpon our arrival, the hostess sat us at a table that had about 5 inches between the table next to us. Meanwhile there were clearly many other more accessible tables available. I typically don't ask to switch seats but I would really rather not sit basically with other guests when there were ample other spots. So, I asked for another table in the middle of the restaurant with more space. The hostess then told me I could have the table but then changed her mind and sat us at the other end of the restaurant. Fine. But turns out, the table was extremely wobbly and I was planning on ordering hot soup, so we moved to the table over.\\n\\nStill with some optimism that the food would make up for the already below subpar service and not to mention uncomfortable chairs (metal chairs! In Boston! So cold!), we placed our orders. \\n\\nWe got our beers. I had a Sapporo draft, which tasted flat and my boyfriend got a bud light can. Probably should have gotten bottled beer vs draft. For a place equipped with a full bar, you would have expected a nice, thirst quenching beer. But they couldn't even get that right. Mind you, this was at 6pm for dinner so I expect dinner standards not a sketchy dive bar service.\\n\\nHis pork bulgogi dish comes out first. And I told him to go ahead and start eating as my dish should be out soon. We wait 10-15mins and saw that dishes for other tables that ordered after us started to arrive. So, I asked the waiter to check on my Kim chi stew (that I was very excited about because I only order Kim chi stew whenever I have Korean food). The waiter comes back after about 5 mins, not with my food, but with the check!!! They even charged me for the Kim chi stew I never received. By this point, I was furious and starving and you never want to make a woman hangry. I told the waiter to cancel my order because by this point, my boyfriend had already ate 3/4 of his meal and I wasn't going to make him watch me eat at the establishment that caused us to have such an unpleasant evening already. The waiter comes back the second time to tell me that the chef actually forgot to make my dish but he can work on it now. No sorry. Not apologetic at all. Of course I didn't want the dish! At the end, we paid for our meal and walked out. \\n\\nI WOULD NEVER EVER step foot into this establishment or would I ever recommend this place to my worst enemy. They don't even serve the typical Korean side dishes so the only thing that I could try was the beer and it was flat! Not to mention the pork bulgogi had RAW onions.

They just don't compare. That is not to say that one couldn't go to those places and leave completely satisfied. They're great. But they don't compare with Franklin's BBQ. \\n\\nIt is simply sublime. Our small group showed up at 8:45 on a summer Friday morning, and there were 18 people ahead of us. By 9, the line had literally doubled. We came prepared with some camp chairs and mimosas. The conversation was great, there were some wonderful dogs in line to pet, and the lady selling drinks and the guy renting chairs and umbrellas were nice touches to top a genuinely good time. \\n\\nThe doors opened at 11, and we made it inside. The service was quick but not hurried. The cutter was very pleasant and offered free samples. I ordered way too much food, for sure, but I love leftovers. We made our way to the outdoor seating with our meat and beer and ate. \\n\\nThe brisket was amazing. The combination of the smokey, peppery flavor, the moist, tender texture, and the perfect, salty bark made for a great experience. I was surprised at how truly amazing the pork ribs were. Tender, smokey, fall-off-off the bone good. The turkey was, hands-down, the best turkey I've ever had anywhere. We finished off with some sausage, which was as good as I've had anywhere else. \\n\\nOne of the staff guys I saw checking in the crowd earlier made his way though the dining area checking on people. We talked him up a bit, great guy! Really impressed with the staff as a whole. Sadly, Aaron wasn't there as he was at Texas State University at a meat conference putting on a clinic. The restaurant itself is a clinic. That makes a TON of money. \\n\\nThere are a few haters on here saying this place is just average, the line is too long, it's just hype, etc. Well, haters gonna hate. Be the contradictory one who wants to look cool by giving Franklin's a negative review? Go right ahead. You're full of shit. The line is part of the experience. Don't want to wait? Don't go. Can you imagine how long you'd wait if you showed up at a fine dining restaurant for dinner without a reservation? You're going to wait a while. Maybe not get served at all. Sound familiar? Plan ahead. The guy who said the people drinking in line were pathetic for getting drunk at 10am? Many people were enjoying various beverages... all responsibly. I saw no drunkenness. Lighten up, guy. \\n\\nThe only negative? I wasn't sure I was a fan of the turkey being re-dipped in butter and squeezed out all over all the other meats I ordered. It was delicious, sure, but next time I might just ask the cutter to go easy on the butter. Just like this meat needs absolutely no sauce, it doesn't need all that butter. \\n\\nSometimes hype is deserved. This is one of those times. If I want BBQ in a hurry, I can go a million other places.

In one scene, Vera Farmiga calls her romantic interest, played by George Clooney & tells him she's in Atlanta, and is looking for a good barbecue recommendation. Without skipping a beat, George replies, \\"Fat Matt's.\\" I suppose, were he truly in love with her, he'd have told her to check out Yelp, but when George Clooney recommends a restaurant, how can you go wrong? \\n\\nI don't know if George knew that he was consigning his rather up-scale lover to an hour-long wait in 90+-degree heat, in a line that snakes around to the back of the building. It's a wonder she didn't call him back to bawl him out halfway through the wait & never gotten to try the ribs. Contrary to what another reviewer said, it's not the kind of situation where one would be concerned  with personal safety because, heck,  you have half of Atlanta there as witnesses, were someone foolish enough to try and mug you. That being said, bring sunscreen, because by the time you belly up to the counter, you'll be as barbecued as the food you're ordering. \\n\\nI'm gonna have to go with the consensus on the sauce here, because it was a bit on the tangy side, for me, and lacked spiciness. Now, I'm a raging chili-head, so I tend to like everything spicier than most peoples' tastes, but I think their sauce could still use the Emeril-style 'kick-up-a-notch' treatment.  While I give a lot of leeway to the sauce on barbecue - I like everything from Kansas City sweet to Carolina-style vinegar, bring it - I like the beans to be sweet, either to compliment a sweet sauce, or to counterpart a tangy one. The beans didn't exactly work for me. \\n\\nThe ribs are good, though. Oh myohmy the ribs were good. The tea was not overly sweet, and the potato salad was...well...potato salad; perhaps it's just that I've yet to encounter potato salad that made me want to rave about its quality, but this was well-executed. \\n\\nAs for the atmosphere, it's counter service, belly up & order, get your drink & a number, and someone brings your food to the table. The place has a 50's burger joint feel to it, and has seating both inside & out. On the days -like the one of my visit - when they're particularly busy, air conditioning is at a bit of a premium, due to the door being constantly open from the never-ending line. Finding seating inside will be a challenge, but you're going to be loath to retreat back to the outdoors to eat after having baked for so long just to get in.  If you're left with no choice - as I was - you'll find the outdoor seating to be at least covered, and a lot cooler than the line on the way in. The place would definitely benefit from a thorough cleaning/refurbishing/repainting, if not remodeling. The 50's feel is worth preserving, but could do with a bit less 'ick' factor, for sure. \\n\\nAll-in-all, an experience I would repeat, if only for the quality of the ribs here. Some tweaks to the sauce, and a quick remodel would put this place up to 4, possibly 5 stars, but they're still a solid, great rib joint in my book. There was no live music the day I was there, but I did note the stage they have off to the side of the main dining area. Some really good music might entice me to stick around after getting my order, but I'll probably get my ribs to go, on future visits....and get twice as many, because these are worth having leftovers."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I went with my son, a UT student, on a cold Tuesday in January.

We had read reviews and knew we needed to get here early but running on a few hours sleep and still having to drive from Dallas that morning we figured we would take the chance and leave at 6am. With a 3 hour 200 mile drive we knew we would be cutting it close but any earlier than that just seemed crazy. Knowing what I know now I would leave at 2am if I had too! So with that we arrived at 9am and were right around the corner from the entrance which is really about 300 people or so. A girl comes around to ask you what you think you want and tells you what is already sold out. She said all they had left at this point was probably brisket and sausage. Someone is always walking by to give you updates as to how long the wait will be. At 9am they told us we would be eating around 2pm. Yes that is right 5 hours from now. Hey you are committed at this point what are you going to do! Once the restaurant opens the line starts moving and the time goes by fast than you think as you are talking with other people etc! One girl from Franklins came by with pulled pork wrapped in white bread as a thanks for waiting. The first bite I knew it was worth everything already! We finally sat down at 1:30pm to eat so it was 4.5 hours of waiting. When we got up there they still had everything but the turkey. We ordered 1/2 to 1 pound of everything they had since it all looked so amazing. \\n\\nThis BBQ was on another level. All the other detailed reviews here sum it up perfect! I would wait overnight to eat here again knowing what I know now. I thought to myself how can BBQ be that much better than some of the local places I have eaten but there is truly no comparison. I think I will be depressed actually going anywhere else now from here on out! Thank you Franklins for the amazing experience.

I'm torn because I definitely think that their breakfast/brunch is better than their dinner. The fried chicken was pretty dang good, but I wouldn't say it was out of this world; it's up there though! I was not a fan of the catfish. I'm not expert, and I guess I don't know how GOOD catfish should taste but it just seemed to have an overwhelmingly fishy taste to it. Maybe that's how it's suppose to be! \\n\\nI had the Screen Door plate with catfish ($1.00 extra). You get a choice of 3 house side or choose from their local organic and a slice of cornbread. I chose the mac & cheese, catfish & 3-crispy fried chicken drumsticks. The mac was fine, I had to add salt & pepper to it (which I find kind of, meh, when I need to do this). The catfish wasn't my thing. Though I did appreciate the texture and breading on it--great breading flavor. This may very well be someone's cup of tea! The drumsticks were decent, pretty dang good. I'm more of a thigh gal, I feel like all the flavor and fun stuff is in the the thighs, amirite?! Anyway, the coating I feel was a good in between of a bready and battery coating. It had great crunch and a pleasant texture for my own taste. The seasoning was good. I've been to a some places where the seasoning was like...sweet and nutmeg-y. SD's seasoning is pretty spot on, good and savory.  My favorite thing by far at SD is the cornbread. Ooooh nelly give mama a pan of some that piping hot cornbread! Now, I'll go back for some of that cornbread.\\n\\nSO, this place is decent! I think it may be a little over-hyped. Nothing beats real southern food from the south but this is pretty good for the PNW. This is a place I would take an out of town friend.

It's definitely the best restaurant at CityWalk. We were on a weekend trip to Orlando and stopped by on a Saturday night, we only waited 20 minutes to be seated. We liked it so much we actually went back again on Sunday, and it was super quick to be seated again. While we waited we sat at the bar and ordered drinks. \\n\\nPretty much everything is excellent, from the drinks to the burgers to the sushi. The first night though we ordered the calamari which was crazy salty. The Boursin burger is one of the best burgers I have ever had, and I had a bite of my husband's Jalapeno Popper Showstopper burger and it was ridiculous. Do yourself a favor and bring friends so you guys can split burgers and sample things, the menu is huge and you'll want to try everything(or maybe we're just greedy). We also shared the Mark's roll and it was ridiculous, though we replaced the kani with tuna.\\n\\nOur server Vinnie was great, really enthusiastic about the food and quick to offer suggestions. He made everything sound great and we loved everything he suggested. We liked him so much we asked for him again the second night. Great guy!\\n\\nSo why 4 stars and not 5? To be honest, the second night we only had sushi and it wasn't as great as the night before. The buffaloooo-ushi was not great after the first bite, and the other rolls we ordered weren't much better than any of the local Tampa places we frequent. So I have some doubts about the consistency. It's possible that their burger items are where they truly shine, or perhaps the sushi chef was having an off night. \\n\\nOne more thing to note, my husband has shellfish sensitivities/allergies and our server let us know that all the friers are shared. He took the risk and was fine after eating the calamari, but if you have a history of actual anaphylaxis when consuming shellfish, don't mess with the fried stuff. Do keep in mind that this is true of *every* restaurant in CityWalk in our experience, some places you basically can't eat there at all because most of the items will potentially come in contact with shellfish at some point.\\n\\nOverall, I recommend it above any of the other restaurants at CityWalk.

My wife had the chicken - which was excellent - and I had the duck breast. It was good, but not quite great.  I should qualify that statement with the fact that, being a long time dorky francophile, I've eaten many a great meals in France (especially small countryside towns) and my wife has virtually perfected cooking duck breast, so I'm uber-picky about my French cuisine.  I expect it both to nail the classical side of the cooking and also have some inventiveness to it. \\n\\nOn our first visit the wine was good, the desert was good - it was all good and the inside of the restaurant really is the only place I've experienced in Portland that looks and feels like the finer petite eateries we stumbled upon in French villages. But it felt to me like Cocotte hadn't yet gotten comfortable with itself -both food and environment-wise.  It felt a bit stiff.  (As Jack L. mentioned in his review - I really wanted to love this place.) Of course, that was also very early on in it's existence and I was probably unfairly comparing it to St. Jack on Clinton -which for me really nailed Lyonnaise-style cuisine right out of the gate.  But that's another review.\\n\\nWell, upon our recent return I can now duly note that Cocotte is hitting on all cylinders.   Considering we live mere blocks from here I can't mention how giddy this makes me.  The food, the service, the environment - all were top-notch.  \\n\\nThe seeming stiffness of the operation has been replaced with a confidence and warmth I rarely find anywhere.  Open windows allowed for the dining area's long drapes to artfully flutter on a muggy, lightly rain-dropped evening.  Combined with some chilled-out modern tracks being played in the background - it provides a visual and aural foil to the bustle of Killingsworth traffic right outside. The room is cozy, but not so much that everyone is uncomfortably close to one another.  It really is a great romantic date destination, but with the laid back charm of a country farm house.  \\n\\nAs usual, we choose the bar when we can and the bar service here was excellent.  They know how to hit that middle ground between engaging conversation and leaving you alone.  And let me add that the staff was gracious and on top of things the entire time.  They closed at 10, but never made us (who, after a two hour visit left after 10:30) or the couple they seated at 9:50 feel rushed or any sort of a burden.  Nice.\\n\\nWe came in late and only planned on sharing a couple of plates, but the entire menu looks fantastic.   First up was the Smoked Salmon Salad - moist chunks of salmon mixed in leafy greens and fresh radishes covered with a lemon shallot vinaigrette, placed on top of a fallen potato souffle with a layer of aioli.   The crisp, cold salad contrasted sharply with the eggy-creamy, steaming (literally) hot souffle.  Awesome.  And quite large, too.   \\n\\nNext we tried the Pates aux Fruits de Mer -  a house-made egg noodle dish with Mediterranean muscles, manila clams, Oregon bay shrimp and scallops.  A Northwest touch played on a straight-out-of-the South-of-France dish.   The herb and spice play was fantastic and they even provided the tiny french forks with which to slowly enjoy it.   The creamy broth was entirely soaked up with their delicious Pearl Bakery bread.\\n\\nAnd let me not forget the house made flavored butters that come with your bread  - a very nice touch that on both visits have been subtly flavored and fully memorable.  This time around it was a strawberry and pepper butter and it was a tiny revelation of flavor that we did not want to stop eating.\\n\\nWe drank a few glasses of excellent reds (if you want to save a couple of dollars, go for the Washington Cab Sauvs - cheaper, but no less delicious than a lot their French counterparts) and had one with a round of classic, well executed Petit Fours to finish things off.  \\n\\nAs I mentioned, we lingered at the bar well after they were shutting down.  After refilling my cup of french-pressed Stumptown, our bartender quietly placed the half- full press next to me for my own use while he went about the business of shutting things down.   There were still a few tables of folks finishing drinks, conversing and generally soaking in the comfortable, almost loungy environment.\\n\\nIt truly has a neighborhood feel to it.

The interior looks dim and muted, which is nice with the candles.  They have a pretty full bar that makes decent drinks, but the food is crap for the price you're paying.  If you get the appetizer of shrimp and grits, you get 3 bland measly shrimp and passable grits for $8.95 which is a huge scam.  The fried green tomatoes at a little under $6 were 6 small slices undercooked with a bland cornmeal crust and served with a remoulade that tasted like 1000 island dressing.  Again, friggin' tomatoes for $6, ridiculous.  The smoked pork sandwich for around $10 is really just braised pork with almost no flavour whatsoever.  The cheeseburger, also around $10, cooked medium rare tends to be well done, although the fries were decent.  The seasonal seafood might be good on some nights, but when it's the most expensive thing on the menu, you expect quality and not undercooked potatoes and tough fish.  The chef at this place is either just a schmuck or his cooks are crap, but as the chef it reflects badly on him if he can't control the quality of his food through his staff.  Really, being a chef is all about preparing good food, but it seems like this place passed on quality food to concentrate on decor.  Unfortunately, this place is a restaurant and not a friggin' lounge. Altogether an unenjoyable experience that left my stomach hungry, as well as my wallet.  It'd probably be a good idea to get the furniture store back."},{"name":"Plank's Bier Garten","address":"888 S High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"3","text":"Bier Garten not so much, but the patio is decent.

So the ribs are still on the bone but I guess that's how it's done? Bread was just wonder bread but the ribs were a healthy serving and delicious. Plus, lots of dipping sauce to boot. The sides were really awesome. I wanted more after I was done but was so full. I ended up buying a t shirt before I left and I usually don't do stuff like that.

The fish is a nice tempura whitefish, but the whole thing is undone by a taste that you could make these at home.

However, my mother & her sister both waited & waited & waited & waited for their meals to arrive. How awkward & pretty uncomfortable to have everyone eating except for the 2 senior citizens! By the time their meals arrived, the rest of us had finished eating our own! Then it was told to us that one of their order's were given away to another patron & the meal had to be made entirely again! Are you kidding me??? \\n\\nWell I went to some women who appeared to be in a management type position & told them the situation. I also asked that an adjustment be made to the bill that I would be paying. At first one of the women went to investigate what was going on. Then she came back & told me the 2 family members would receive free desert. I told them they would not want desert & I already knew this about my mother & aunt. So then she finally let me know the one meal that had to be completely re-ordered would not be charged for. I said thank you & walked away.\\n\\nBut wait! That's not all! Another family member was given 2 receipts for her meal & both were of different prices, one being $20 more than the other. When it was brought to the waitress's attention, she had said my meal got charged to that family members credit card. So that had to be re-done. And...I was charged for an appetizer another family member had ordered. WTF??? \\n\\nAll of us liked our waitress & we understand people can have off days. They made good on the food mistake, but 2 different errors in the billing just made everyone of their blunders unacceptable to me.

We were sat quickly but they never brought us another menu, so we had to try to share this one menu from across the table and figure out what we wanted. \\n\\nOur waiter, Randy, was quite gruff and not the most friendly. We ordered the Lumberjack with sausage, bacon as a side dish, and two mochas with two shots of espresso in each with whip. The mochas were the most disappointing because they tasted like Luke-warm milk. The Lumberjack was okay, I feel like the Lumberjack you order at Denny's tastes exactly like it other than the \\"Oktoberfest sausage\\", which was okay. However, the cheese omelette had cream cheese in it, which was an interesting twist and I did like that. We also were never asked how the food was or were checked on at all. We stacked up all of our plates when we were done and Randy finally just gave us the bill. I left for the bathroom at this point to write this review, and I just got back (I would say it was 10-15 minutes) and my boyfriend still hasn't been able to pay.

If you have a problem with your food they will ignore it and won't take it off bill because it seems owner is very cheap.  Want chowder instead of soup - no problem but you have to pay full price for chowder instead of a surcharge to cover difference and then toss out the other soup that will still come with your meal.  \\n\\nWe tried it several times because my husband likes their seafood bisque and I liked them when they were in Wilmington but we will never go back.  My husband really wanted to try chicken stew but could only order it as a bowl, not a cup.  Why?  No idea but whatever he ordered it along with dinner.  It then arrives about 15 minutes later and is a gigantic bowl of potatoes and carrots with some chicken in flavorless broth.  A staff member noticed he didn't eat much and we explained that it was not very good and was not what was expected.  We tried to be nice and offered to just take it home.  The woman packaged it up and dropped it at our table never once offering to take it off bill.  We then waited another 15 min or so for our dinners to come out.  Dinner was OK but I couldn't eat half my prime rib because it was very red even though I ordered it as medium.  Waitress asked if I wanted to take it home and again I was polite and just said no.\\n\\nAfter we finish eating our waitress informs my husband that his stew came with a salad and asks if he wants to take one to go.  We informed her we did not want to take a salad home (who takes salad home??) but sure enough we were charged full price $8.25 for the 3 bites of stew and imaginary salad.  \\n\\nSad thing is that it wasn't just us with issues.  The table next to us had issues with their bill and then the staff tried to reject a restaurant.com certificate because one of the meals was a special.  After several rounds of discussion the woman finally agreed to accept the certificate and I think that was only because they may have called the # and voided it.\\n\\nNeedless to say we will never go back there because they are more concerned about making $8 than keeping customers happy.  I absolutely hate places that charge for every little thing and then charge you for things you didn't get or that weren't good.

It was just like thick cut bacon but cooked really well, so not chewy and also not crispy. The polenta was amazing! I just wish they had the entire dish on a plate and not in a bowl. There was liquid at the bottom which made the polenta pushy. Because it was in a bowl and it was under the polenta, eggs and pork, the greens were wilted and wet. Really delicious dish but the portion size was too small for me and again, I would prefer it on a plate. The home fries were decent but nothing to write home about. I felt they were overcooked as the inside of them were quite empty and it was also overseasoned.

There was only one other occupied table in the room, at which a large party was seated.  I ordered a salad and a Scotch Egg, which I was very eggcited to try!  (Sorry, I couldn't help myself.)  A Scotch Egg is apparently a hard-boiled egg wrapped in sausage, breaded and then deep-fried.  I don't know how authentic the dish is, but how could I not sample that!?\\n\\nUnfortunately, it took the better part of an hour for the food to arrive at our table, the waiter hardly visited us, (but made sure that the table with the large party of people got plenty of attention) and then it took another 45 minutes after we finished to get the check.  I'm not sure what the deal was, since there seemed to be plenty of wait staff just standing around and doing nothing.  My guess is that either the kitchen was short-staffed and that staffing was a disorganized mess in general.\\n\\nThe food itself was alright, and the Scotch Egg was pretty good, (how could it not be, with all that delicious grease?) but it certainly wasn't worth waiting around so long for, and wasting an entire evening."},{"name":"No Mas!

It was lovely night with lovely food and we both left with very happy bellies."},{"name":"South City Kitchen Midtown","address":"1144 Crescent Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Fabulous quintessentially American meal that deftly combined classic Southern cooking traditions with updated modern farm-to-table sensibilities. For a real treat, dine at the bar overlooking the large open kitchen, and you'll be treated to a prime view of the masterful sous chefs at work preparing your dishes before they hand-deliver them to you!\\n\\nI arrived for dinner at 6:30p on a Monday night -- hardly an hour when restaurants are already packed to the brim, but this upscale, dimly lit, matchbox-sized cottage of one was. I was fortunate to snag the last seat at the bar, because the wait for a table was already 1.5 hours. When my food arrived, it was no wonder the restaurant was so busy -- I ordered the crisped wild Tennessee catfish appetizer and the seasonal autumn vegetable plate, and both dishes were exquisite! The catfish dish includes two golden deep fried 4oz filets perched atop a bed of kale (I had collard greens substituted for no extra charge) and varietal purple grapes, topped with a generous dollop of bright, citrusy herb-caper tartar sauce. Even below the tartar sauce, the light and perfectly adhered breading stayed crisp and kept the flaky, moist catfish flesh hot throughout without being greasy at all. Honestly though, the highlight of the dish -- if not my entire meal -- was the grapes. Featuring a tart crunchy skin but perfectly sweet and juicy gelatinous flesh, these were grapes unlike any I've ever had! Next up came the vegetable plate with sweet potato gratin, kale mushroom salad, and roasted spaghetti squash with charred red onions, which was at once the most decadent, most unique, and far-and-away unhealthiest way I've ever gotten my three servings a day. The sweet potato gratin is insane: consisting of layers of thinly shaved, toothsome potato and what has to be the gooiest, cheesiest, saltiest bechamel sauce on the planet, it's closer to an outrageously cheesy lasagna than a gratin. I couldn't decide if this was awesome or just plain gratuitous, especially since the cheesy mass was also wildly over-salted. Similarly, the kale mushroom salad was almost inedible in how salty it was. I felt obligated to eat the lightly dressed, tender shredded kale anyway just because it's so healthy and picked out the delicate hen-of-the-woods mushrooms to enjoy them without all the unnecessary added sodium. This turned out to be awesome though because I simply added them to the delicious skillet of roasted spaghetti squash; the mushrooms' peppery, woody, robust earthiness and firm, toothsome texture made for an out-of-this-world complement to the creamy squash. \\n\\nDespite a few missteps with the food and less than hospitable service, I thoroughly enjoyed my meal -- even though I consumed an epic ass ton of food, butter, and oil -- and found it to be a wonderful introduction to Atlanta's best-of-the-best local and seasonal offerings for this visiting Californian. HOWEVER: I perhaps didn't enjoy it enough to walk away from dinner without MASSIVE FOOD REGRET over not ordering the fried chicken, which haunted me for days afterwards! For bougie fried chicken, I imagine you'd be hard-pressed to find a better looking plate at a higher value in Atlanta. For $17, the towering portion of perfectly golden brown chicken was huge, and the plating of potatoes and collard greens generous. If I had longer than one week in Atlanta, I would come back to SCK for this dish alone. Even so, South City Kitchen definitely shined over all the other restaurants I tried in Atlanta with its interpretation of modern farm-focused Southern cuisine.

The dim sum isn't amazing but it takes care of the craving, and I'm a fan of the small plates/family style of eating.\\nThis past weekend, we decided to get an order of the chinese broccoli. We had gone through half of it when I discovered a ladybug sitting in the broccoli. EW! \\nOne of the waiters gave us a choice of a replacement OR taking it off of our bill. I honestly thought BOTH of those things should have happened WITH an apology, but alas, this is Chinatown and expectations regarding service should be realistic(ally low). On top of that, my dining companion did not wish for me to make a fuss about it (he said \\"at least it's not a cockroach...\\" really?!) ugh. \\nNeedless to say, this definitely curbed my appetite for the rest of the meal, and I will hesitate before coming here again.

Her boyfriend decided Tia's because it's right along the waterfront and heard it's been there for many years so we figure they must be doing something right.  I wish we had read the yelp reviews first.\\n\\nDuring the planning of this get-together, the boyfriend had called in advance to reserve a table for Saturday night, Tia's however said that they do not take reservations and added that it should not be a long wait.  We all got there around 7PM and asked how long it will be for a table inside; the hostess said 15 minutes.  We were impressed so we walked around the wharf briefly and came back to wait.  About half an hour, we checked and still no table.  Kept waiting.  At an hour we were very agitated and asked again.  They said they had nothing but can seat us outside.  We were out of patience so we took the outside seating which was 2 round tables pushed together.\\n\\nLike someone else said, the waitress was running around the whole time but she was nice.  She took our order, asked us if we wanted everything to come out at once or when they're ready...we said whenever ready and then she was like...we'll just bring everything out together.  Umm...thanks for asking then.  Sitting outside was alright...did some people watching.  A couple of party trolleys rolled around that were annoying.  An eclectic mix of pedestrians.  Nice view of the city.\\n\\nOnto the food...for apps we got Chips and Salsa and the Fried Calamari.  The chips/salsa was not worth it but the calamari was pretty good.  Keep in mind we're starving.  3 of the ladies got the Twin Lobster special for $25 while the bday girl got the Baked Stuffed Lobster for $49.  The guys got the Swordfish ($26) and 2 Baked Scrod ($20).  My girlfriend asked if she can substitute a side but the waitress said no.  No complaints regarding the prices since it's prime location and seafood.  The food took a while to come out so my judgment may be more favorable than usual since I'm willing to eat anything at this point (about 9:30 when we finally had our entrees).\\n\\nThe Baked Scrod is very good with the buttered almond crumbs giving it a little bit of crunchiness.  It came with garlic mash and 1 GIANT stem of broccoli which was alright...nothing too special.  I had some of the Twin Lobster with the melted butter...very fresh and sweet.  Pretty good deal for the 2 lobsters.  The Baked Stuff Lobster was pretty amazing though...crab, scallop, shrimp stuffing inside the lobster.  If money is not an issue, go for it.\\n\\nWe didn't see our waitress much so our glasses were empty by the time we were done.  She took about 15 minutes to get us the check which is pretty ridiculous.  They hire guys to literally sit outside the outdoor dining area to prevent any freeloaders...I really wish they hired more people inside instead.  I can see why our wait was so long.  The food itself was pretty good but the waiting and unwillingness to swap out a side left a lot to be desired.  It's more of an operations sloppiness.  I could have given it 3 stars but I'm stingy with my ratings in case I come across something incredible.  Based on just food itself, it's pretty decent but I'm not willing to experience that wait again.  So much potential wasted."},{"name":"Dang's Thai Kitchen","address":"670 N State St","city":"Lake Oswego","stars":"4","text":"Absolutely amazing Thai food...

The setup was similar to Torchy's which I am also a fan of as well. \\n\\nWe ordered chips with dona salsa for a starter. Please note they have 3 sizes and if you are sharing the chips order the small size and get one to two tacos. That combination will yield a good amount of food for two people. If you order the second size up of chips and salsa you get two bags of chips and a bigger container of salsa which could yield leftovers if you go home.

Actually attempting to cook while drunk? Dangerous territory my friends.)\\n\\nWell, Tasty Burger could make those kinds of nites a thing of the past.  This former gas station, turned retro-styled, indoor-outdoor, fast food burger joint, open 'til 2 am, is also living up to its name;  in my opinion. \\n\\nI love the fact that their burgers are cooked medium by default; so that what you get is flavorful, tender patty delivered quickly in a fresh tasting bun, with equally fresh toppings. My cheeseburger was a little messy, and I found myself scooping a bit of cheese that was sticking to the wrapper back onto the burger. With so many different delicious sounding burgers on their board, I couldn't convince my crew to order a sack of burgers, hard as I tried.  I love French fries, but rarely order them at fast food places because I am always disappointed. But after stealing a few of Ben L's fries last nite, I was disappointed in myself for not having faith and ordering up my own. They are thin cut, but they also are perfectly crispy, lightly seasoned and you can actually taste the potato rather than just grease and salt which seems to be the taste that most Americans want in their fries. The few onion strings I also stole from a companion were not too greasy, and again, the taste of the onions really came through.\\n\\nNon-food related details that I noticed, even from the perspective of ordering outside from the walk-up window included heaters built in under the awning, which helped keep the chill out of this dreary, wet evening, an actual parking lot (but probably not on game days!), and attentive service.  \\n\\nWhen it comes to fast food burger joints, where \\"meh\\" has become the passable norm, this *is* as good as it gets."},{"name":"DeSano Pizzeria Napoletana","address":"8000 Burnet Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"This is the best pizza in town for those with discerning taste.

Our spot was estimated at 1pm when we'd be checking out (it ended up being 12:55pm).

One whole star on this review is for having the Double Mountain IRA.\\n\\nFries came out well ahead of my burger, which I like, but be aware if that's not your style. They were good, not super thin but thin enough to have some crispy bits. Really good flavor, you can tell they use fresh local potatoes and probably peanut oil based on the taste.\\n\\nThe burger, however, was just not that great. When I get sent to a place with burger in the title, I expect their standard burger burger (In this case the Foster Burger) to at least satisfy my semiweekly craving for cheese covered ground beef. Burger came with onions, house pickles (which were good, and had there been about twice as many, might have saved the burger) and a couple sad looking pieces of iceburg lettuce, along with a side of Foster Sauce, which in the line of special sauces is pretty bland. It's like something someone from Eugene would think is flavorful.\\n\\nThe burger, and I was surprised to see a mini version on the menu, because this was a standard \\"1/4 lb\\" size patty you get at McDonald's, was decent. The menu says all burgers cooked medium unless specified, mine came on the rare side of Medium Rare. How I like it anyway, but still. I think where they really strike out, and this is sad because it's probably a large part of the cost of the product they're putting out, is one the bun. It's a delicious bun, they say brioche but it has much more of a whole-wheat hearty taste to it. It's also about 3 times as much bread as I would want relative to the amount of burger and burger accouterments that came in between its halves. Foster Burger offers a plethora of free toppings to add, but their classic burger without them is overwhelmed by a bun which causes the overall burger to be quite dry. I'm sure with all kinds of toppings this is less of a problem, but if you're named _____ burger and your classic burger doesn't stand alone, you should probably change your name to Foster Poutine, because nobody has any doubt you're nailing that shit.

As much as the \\"brunch with a Mexican flare\\" and \\"Fiesta Special\\" tickled my fancy, I really just needed some carbohydrates and maybe a little bacon grease to make me feel like a normal person again. \\n\\nI was sat at the bar where the bartenders were handing out menus and tequila concoctions with the locals. I asked for the Southwest home fries and the bacon, along with endless water and some OJ. I could tell the bartender was a bit confused; whether it was because I wasn't sans-tequila or because I didn't order any of the giant plates, I still don't know. Either way, my food came out quickly and was pretty good. I prefer my home fries steamed a bit and then fried-- Masas' seem to be primarily fried which isn't a big deal just a preference, so I lived. Bacon was cooked well, crisp* yet soft! (Another preference of mine, crisp not crispy!) Although small, it hit the spot and I left Masa feeling much better. \\n\\nThis review gets such a high rating not just for food and service but also Masa's atmosphere. Bright, chic, and open, the restaurant was buzzing with young professionals and maybe older college students. Many of the Gays were present so I'll take that as my hint to definitely return. I'll have to come back the next time I'm in Boston with a group of friends so we can all order something different on Masa's 'something for everyone' menu!"},{"name":"HOTLIPS Pizza - Pearl","address":"721 NW 9th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"PESTO BREADSTICKS.

This is my favorite place for Mexican in the Boston area - it's T-accessible - right on the Red Line - Harvard stop. It can get very crowded on weekend nights so be prepared to wait especially if you're with a large group. And make sure you remind the host staff you're still waiting as sometimes they um, forget to seat you. But once you're at your table, enjoy the huge margaritas and unlimited salsa and chips (served nice and hot - temperature wise). You won't find much above $12 - I recommend the enchiladas, but my friends love the burritos! And they range from like $6-8 and you're full! The only downfalls are 1) the service CAN get questionable - they may forget to come back to your table and refill your drinks and acted rude when checking IDs, but overall it's ok for the price 2) no desserts but there are plenty of dessert places in Harvard Square so it's ok. But for the price, it's definitely worth a shot going - it just gets very crowded on the weekends so be prepared to wait!

She has been living in Boston for the past two years.  We went to Hei La Moon on a recent Saturday afternoon.  I asked her at the beginning of the meal, \\"So, this is your dim sum spot?\\"  I was very encouraged to see all the Chinese faces in the background.  Superimpose my 1/8 Chinese, 7/8 Filipino face and her 100% Chinese face, and you've got me feeling like we're in the right place.  This is especially so, because both floors of Hei La Moon were filled nearly to capacity.  \\n\\nThe unfortunately damning comment--though I don't think she meant it that way--that she made was, \\"It's not the best I've had before, but it's the best I've found in Boston.\\"  That was enough warning.  She and I have shared countless dim sum meals in the past.  Most of those meals have been in the Far East--in various places in and around the Manila area where there is a very large Chinese population.  Some of those dim sum meals have been here in the U.S.  This was the first one we had while she was living in Boston.  I trusted her judgment that this would be the best dim sum I could find in Boston.  I only bring up our shared history of eating dim sum together to illustrate that she knows me and that I know her.  We know implicitly what we both expect and hope for in a meal.  For her to say what she did was a signal to me that I was going to think that the meal was fine, but it wasn't going to be particularly memorable.  I found that to be the case with the food at Hei La Moon.\\n\\nWe started off with some radish cakes, which I had never had before.  We both enjoyed those.  The shrimp rice noodle rolls were decent.  Unfortunately, the beef short ribs were leathery, but they had great flavor.  The spicy salted shrimp was probably the highlight of the meal.  We also had some fish, which kind of reminded me of smelt, but I'm not sure what they were.  They came around with the spicy salted shrimp cart.  The fish was quite delicious.  The har kaw and shumai were fine, but not outstanding.  The chicken feet were had nice flavor, but also were not outstanding.\\n\\nOverall, Hei La Moon, which two friends call the go-to spot for dim sum in Boston, isn't bad.  Again, I wouldn't say that it's outstanding in any way.  Even the best dish I had, the spicy salted shrimp, wasn't particularly fantastic.  It was probably too breaded for me.  It was also cold and dry compared to what I usually would want.  Still, it was serviceable.  It was decently enjoyable enough to give us that dim sum fix without making us feel completely disappointed."},{"name":"Club 185","address":"185 E Livingston Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Club 185 has a really tasty burger.

The raviolo, the complimentary pickled string beans, the cocktails, the beef neck, the (\\"ubiquitous\\") kale salad -- everything was clearly prepared with an eye toward quality, and this was apparent even if a particular dish wasn't to my taste. The cocktails are well balanced (neither overly sweet or strong, two common mistakes) and the beer selection well curated.\\n\\n1. At every level, the staff knows what they are doing, and that's just so nice. The bartenders and servers clearly go through enough training to know every dish and cocktail. We see the same people stay on for a long time: low turnover is a good sign that the staff are investments, not throwaway interchangeable labor. They don't buttonhole us relentlessly during our meal, but are observant enough to bring out a dish after we've finished one. When I pull up to the bar a glass of water appears immediately, before I'm asked about my drink selection.\\n\\nGreat for the occasional chill night out!

Then I ordered the combo with two sides- sliced, lean brisket and ribs with tater tots and fox-a-roni (mac n cheese with their stew I believe). The brisket was good, the meat was sooooo soft. My friend and I thought it was a bit too smokey, but still good. The ribs were ok, but I still think Fresh Market (Chastain) has the best ribs, I swear (their bbq section, freshly made). The fox-a-roni side was good, interesting. I am not a big fan of mac n cheese, but they make it well. My friend loved it. She said her green beans were a bit too spicy. I haven't tried. We had to wait for our server to get boxes and to pay, but she was busy,  so it's ok. We were not rushing.

It's right around the corner from my house.  It's cute and a little posh.  It's French food! But it just wasn't meant to be.\\n\\nI went here with my sweetie for a nice Saturday brunch.  They advertise it  on the side of the building, so I figured it was their specialty.  \\n\\n\\nTo begin with, I found the menu kind of limited and confusing.  For a brunch, there are painfully few options and almost nothing on the menu sounded good.  Also, the idea of small plates wasn't really described on the menu so I kept wondering what I was supposed to be selecting--which meant it took much longer to decide than it needed to.  (Maybe I'm just uncivilised.) I ordered 2 eggs over easy with potatoes and toast.  My fiance had a scrambled egg, potatoes and bacon.  We had coffee and tea.\\n\\nThe first thing I noticed was how many plates there were on the table.  There was a plate for everything!  There was a plate for our ketchup and mustard.  It ended up being overwhelming and there was no room for our actual food on the table.  We had to take charge to consolidate the plate situation just so we could eat comfortably.  Maybe it looked nice (debatable) but it was way over the top. \\n\\nThen, the food.....My over easy eggs were completely unseasoned and came out lukewarm.  The potatoes were under-seasoned and also only warm.  The  baguette was 4 thin slices and cost 3 dollars.  I kept looking for some part of the meal to enjoy, but it was nowhere to be found. I guess my Tazo tea was pretty good, but I'm not sure Coquette can take credit for that.  My fiance said his scrambled eggs were very soggy and under-seasoned and he didn't finish his potatoes because they were too bland.  He liked the idea of the extra thick bacon, but said it was seasoned to taste \\"like a really thin pork steak\\" rather than bacon.  He, too, left disappointed.\\n\\nAnd it's not as though the food is cheap enough to warrant it's so-so-ness.  The meal was quite expensive compared to other brunch places in the neighborhood and the portions and quality do not compensate for the difference.\\n\\nService was fair to good, though perhaps it would have been nice if our food was served hot.\\n\\nUltimately, we won't be back.  With The Cup and Saucer right across the street and other excellent brunch places like The Tin Shed and Petite Provence a stone's throw away, Coquette did nothing to win us over and plenty to turn us off.  Sure, it's cute...but so is my dog and next time I'll just have brunch at home and save myself the $30.\\n\\nI'm sorry, Coquette.  You just aren't good enough."},{"name":"The Oakwood Canadian Bistro","address":"2741 W 4th Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"This place was a total surprise.

Bar-B-Q","address":"1238 Dekalb Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"In one week, hubby and I tried twice to eat once at Fox Bros. BBQ - our first attempt was on a busy holiday with a wait estimate of 1.5 hrs. This is not a fancy-dress required place and, if you need proofs, here are three: (1) as we elbowed our way in, a big tall guy with glazed eyes carrying an armful of dishes and glasses spilled something wet and sticky all over my right leg, foot and sandal; (2) the 'maitre Ds' scream undecipherable names when tables are ready - and I mean SCREAM. (3) for messy eaters, there's a roll of paper towels on the table. \\n\\nTwo girls who got there ahead of us, waiting patiently while seated on bar stools, were perusing menus. They told us they had been there for at least an hour. They let us have a gander: prices seem high to me for BBQ and the pungent aromas wafting about reminded me of several other BBQ places we've tried around Atlanta over the years: char + tomato + vinegar. I wasn't sure what I'd order but my taste buds were insisting on the fried okra side dish. We didn't get to try a thing that day because I suggested to my husband that we leave when a waiter waltzed by me with two baskets each one-third filled with what I guess were appetizers for two young men seated at the bar - whatever was in those baskets was black as coal - decidedly unappetizing to me. We said goodbye to the two ladies and headed off in search of readier sustenance.\\n\\nHowever, that pungent Fox-y aroma must have hung heavy on our hearts, clothes and hair, so, later that week, my husband and I suggested to each other almost simultaneously that we try Fox again. This time we were seated immediately and our food arrived in less time than it took for each of us to wash our hands. I wasn't wearing a watch but our whole stay from start to finish allowed for only two nearly empty Marta trains to zip past our table by the window from our right to left. My mound of pulled pork was scrumptious, especially with a squirt of spicy BBQ sauce left out on the table in a squeeze bottle; the milder sauce didn't do much for me except moisten the meat, not that the tender morsels needed moistening. I had heard that the mac and cheese was good so I tried that - giant soft shell pasta in a rich creamy sauce good as dessert - which we skipped. I had SO been looking forward to their fried okra but was told that \\"it's out of season\\" which I found surprising because I had been buying it fresh to prepare at home for weeks before this meal out. Instead I ordered collards which had an unexpected sweet and sour tang that got better the more I ate. I had to ask for a take-out box because I couldn't finish all the meat and greens.\\n\\nThe Fox menu lists some kid plates - wish they also offered senior plates - the portion sizes are on the large side. (I had enough leftover pulled pork for 2 small lunches at home). I wasn't crazy about the dry slice of white bread under my pulled pork - I discarded it upon reaching home. My husband ordered two main components: a special called, I think, Burned Ends, which consists of the charred edges of pork roast, soaked in sauce and baked some more. The bite he shared was tender but drowning in sauce (I prefer to control how much sauce I put on at table). He also got some pulled pork plus baked beans and Brunswick stew. All four of our side dishes arrived in Styrofoam cups; both of mine were room temperature. We ordered two different draft beers - I'm not much of a beer drinker but I liked the crisp fruity beer the nice waitress suggested. Our total tab was $55 for meals, beers, tax and tip.

It is the only way to avoid the line and taste some of the best Texas BBQ on earth. Just ask Kanye West who they booted from the line when he tried to cut this past January. They make you order a minimum of 6 pounds a meet for the take out order, which will cost you about $100. Remember even if you don't intend to eat it all, you are paying for access. Plus, people in line will gladly take any excess you have off your hands. People legitimately wait upwards of 4 hours in line to eat here.\\n\\nEvery bite of food here I had was fantastic. The brisket was my favorite without question, it was just so tender and flavorful. The ribs and sausage were also great. They gave a full loaf of bread with our order and that worked out perfectly for making sandwiches with the brisket and their delicious BBQ sauce. They don't have plates but give you paper dining mats for eating off of. So if you want plates you'll have to hit up CVS around the corner.

It was actually a rather unpleasant time, although it started off well. When my mother and I walked in, we were happily greeted by the hostess who brought us to our table. She also complimented me on my afro, telling me that it's a nice retro look. After a few minutes, our waiter showed up, and then he brought us glasses of water, which is where the fun begins.\\n\\nAfter drinking about half of the glass of water, I noticed that the glass was filthy! There were pieces of paper and lettuce stuck all over the glass, not to mention the spots. So, I couldn't drink anymore of that. Then, he brought over some breadsticks and salad. After seeing how dirty my glass was, I had to inspect my fork. The fork was also dirty. It had little pieces of food stuck all over it. Luckily, they give each person two forks. The other one was cleaner, but I still had to wipe it with a napkin.\\n\\nEventually, we ordered our entr√©es. I ordered the Venetian Apricot Chicken, which was mediocre. The portion was too small, and the apricot sauce was too sweet. The asparagus was so skinny that I couldn't even pick it up with my fork. I've never seen such small asparagus. I also got two tiny pieces of chicken. The meal was in no way filling. Since I wasn't full, I decided to order dessert. I ordered the tiramisu, which was crap.
