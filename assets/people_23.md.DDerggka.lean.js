If it wasn't her for her, I would given this restaurant a 5 star rating as the food was amazing but our server was incredibly rude.\\n\\n\\nNow for the wall of texts...\\n\\nI really wish Yelp would give two separate ratings, one for food and one for service. Alas, as excellent as the food was, the service here (for one waitress as I can not comment on the others) is borderline rude.\\n\\nThe service first started terribly when the waitress told us to go to our own seats by literally pointing off some direction in a corner that had some seating. Apparently for her, she must have gotten her prior instructions to us because she expressed in an incredibly unapologetic manner that the seating she pointed out to us previously was for a party of three and gave us a quizzical \\"are you even listening to what I am saying\\" look, which she then pointed us to another side of the restaurant (noticed I said \\"pointed,\\" NOT express vocally by hand signs). \\n\\nUpon ordering, she was typical in taking our orders (just the typical \\"what do you want\\" and \\"k that will be ready soon\\" responses). Her responses to our questions on ordering was at best, tacit and cold. I LITERALLY got more help on ordering by looking at the Yelp tips and reviews than from her. However, during our dinner, she sort of just disappeared and I had to constantly grab the attention from another waiter, who was definitely more amicable to work with. Our waitress finally did arrive, but only after we finished our foods in a span of forty five minutes. \\nAfter seeing her service, I decided to tip her less than the usual 15-20% and dropped the tip percentile down to about 7% due to her poor service. Upon grabbing the cash and the check, she says to me \\"you know that tipping here is 15% minimum right?\\" I respond to her \\"yes I do, however, your service so far has been shitty and sub-par at best.\\" She must have not heard me and asks if I know what 15% of about 75 dollars is. I tell her I do but, incredibly irritated on her insistence on getting paid more than what she has earned, I slip another five at her direction. My girlfriend and I hurry out and that was the end of our ordeal.\\n\\nI have worked in restaurants before and I understand the concept of tipping. I have seen the best and the worst of tippers and suffice to say, I understand to some elementary level the concept of getting paid for a quality of service. I am really hoping that she didn't ask me what tipping was because I was Asian. A jump of assumption of that sort is a bit.. I don't know.. racist? Regardless, I was hoping that a tip of less than 15% was a bit of a hint that maybe her service wasn't exactly up to par. Regardless, if I ever do set foot in the restaurant again, I hope that she is not our server again.\\n\\nFood-wise, the dishes were great. We order the house special with garlic bread and salad.

I decided to eat at this really upscale place with my family after hearing about the really good reviews. The food I ordered is from the Restaurant Week menu but the appetizer and the entree should be on the regular menu. Here is what I got for my dinner:\\n\\nProsciutto Bocconcini e Peperoni - This is mozzarella cheese wrapped with Italian style ham. Peppers are put as garnish. This was the antipasto. \\nRavioli Aragosta - This is lobster filled ravioli with a cream sauce made from crab meat. The dish only had 4 pieces. \\nTiramisu - This was a cake with tiramisu flavor and it was the dolce. \\n\\nMy mother ordered the Thursday special, which was the Porchetta. This dish is a pork loin, with mashed potatoes, asparagus and peppers, despite the conflicting description on the menu. My father ordered the Linguine Alle Vongole. This is pasta with clams doused in a scampi sauce. \\n\\nThe bread was actually pretty good, fairly crusty and chewy. They provided some olive oil, and it was pretty good as well. I ate a couple of olives, brought back some memories of eating aceitunas in Spain. \\n\\nAs for my dishes, the presentation of the appetizer was really impressive. The ham and cheese were really tasty and the balsamic vinegar was pretty good as well. The peppers were decent. As for the lobster ravioli, the presentation was not really impressive, but the ravioli was tasty and chewy and the sauce was decently good. Did not detect much meatiness in the lobster though and I thought it was probably the most disappointing dish. As for the other dishes, I sampled the pork loin and the clams. The pork was dry and not so tender to my liking. The clams though were decently good. \\n\\nAs for the dessert, I thought it was the best part of the meal and a great finisher to the meal. The cream, the sweetness, along with the fresh cool softness of the cake, gave my tongue and palate a great feeling of euphoria. I'm talking about the kind of euphoria that you get as if you are standing at the Piazzale Michelangelo on a beautiful afternoon in Firenze, Toscana and you get kissed by a really gorgeous girl that you really want to spend time with often. Yeah, the tiramisu is that good, but probably not as good as tiramisu from the bakeries and cafes in the North End neighborhood, and maybe not as good as tiramisu from a decent cafe in Firenze. \\n\\nService was pretty good, the server was very attentive, and replaced our forks and knives every time we finished a dish. He always made sure our glasses were filled with water and we had enough bread. Interior is really comfortable. I think you should wear something nice, maybe a Kenneth Cole collared shirt and some nice slacks by Armani.  Restrooms are really clean, and strangely, there is a flat screen TV above the toilets so you can conveniently watch TV while \\"taking care of your business\\". This place is open until 2 AM, so it's not a bad choice after a night out in the city. \\n\\nOverall, this place is not high on my recommendations for great Italian cuisine in Boston, but it is a pretty good choice for something upscale, if you don't mind splurging a little and if you do not want to walk far after spending a really long day at an exposition at the Institute of Contemporary Art museum nearby. It's also a pretty good choice for a dinner appointment as well, but the location kind of sucks since this area in Boston is a little boring."},{"name":"Siros Restaurant","address":"307 Victory Rd","city":"Quincy","stars":"3.5","text":"Definitely an extraordinary restaurant with Amazing  food,  great service and a view of the Boston Harbor and all surrounding waterfront making this one he'll of a Fantastic destination."},{"name":"Peach's & Cream","address":"73 Bennington St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Ricos pasteles para toda ocacion bodas 15 a√±os  bautizos primera comuni√≥n tambi√©n ai servicio de comida gugos porciones de pastel para saborear un momento con un amiga o alg√∫n familiar"},{"name":"Row 34","address":"383 Congress St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Wow wow wow!

I have made plans to eat at Barcelona several times but this was the first time they were actually coming to fruition. My friend made the reservation, but mistakenly signed us up for some cooking class. The hostess quickly fixed it and scrambled to find us a table. After a 5 minute wait, we were being escorted to our table.\\n\\nWe chose to sit outside (shorter wait), although with the sun set, it was starting to get a little chilly. Thankfully, they switched on the outdoor heating and it wasn't unbearable.\\n\\nIt was Restaurant Week, so we could get 4 tapas for $25! However, with 4 people, we didn't want to share 16 tapas among us, since there weren't THAT many tapas that we wanted to try. We decided to do 2 people ordering 8 tapas and 2 people ordering paella.  Our server gladly welcomed the idea.\\n\\nI started out with a white sangria. I usually order red, but the server assured me their white was much better. I wasn't convinced, but after taking a sip, I was instantly converted. I should have ordered a pitcher of white sangria for myself. \\n\\nWe received complimentary bread - nothing special, but we asked for extra to dip in our mussel broth. It took a long time - which we noted was due to the inability to defrost the bread... We got three baskets of bread. The first basket was perfectly warm, the second basket's bread was ice cold in the middle, and the third one took 30 minutes to emerge from the back. They were clearly not prepared to serve so much bread on a Wednesday night of Inman Park Restaurant Week. \\n\\nThe tapas we tried were:\\n\\nSteamed Mussels - we got two orders of these and were glad to have done so. These were delicious. The BROTH though. It seemed to be missing a little bit of spicy kick, but I could have picked up the bowl and drank it all by itself. Delicious and a must order. \\nHanger Steak - of course we didn't get two orders of these just because they were the most expensive tapa... Lies. But it was pretty tasty. Nothing mind blowing, though. \\nRed Fish a la Plancha - now we wish we had gotten two orders of this one. Out came a bite size portion of a beautifully cooked piece of fish. We each got a tiny taste but it wasn't satisfying.\\nAlbondigas - nothing special. It was just elevated meatballs with tomato sauce. \\nGambas al Ajillo - slightly overcooked but some tasty shrimp. Wish it came with more than just two shrimps. Flavor was on point. \\nChorizo with Sweet & Sour Figs - the figs were sweet. And the chorizo was salty. Together it made for an addicting combination. Not bad. \\n\\nThe paella took a while after we finished our tapas. But it was well worth the wait. It was piping hot and filled with seafood. Not the best paella I've had but even on a mostly full stomach I was aching for more. A great dish for sharing. \\n\\nWe really struggled over getting a dessert but in the end decided against it, thinking we could get gelato from Queen of Cream - turns out they close at 10 and we had just missed their closing. Next time!\\n\\nLong story short (ok not short at all), Barcelona is a great tapas restaurant in the Inman Park area - dare I say the best tapas downtown. If only it were $25 for 4 tapas year-round! I would totally come back here for a chill night: a pitcher of sangria, a few orders of mussels and a pan of paella."},{"name":"Bangkok Thai Restaurant","address":"1492 Piedmont Ave NE, Ste A","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I loved trying Bangkok Thai.

I've been here several times, primarily for birthdays and this visit was no different occasion. \\n\\nThe Parking: The parking is valet only and is complimentary. Of course, the valet staff primarily works for tips, so I'm sure they'd appreciate your generosity. We visited on a Friday night and the LOT WAS A MESS. There were 2 valet drivers scurrying around like roaches, a LONG LINE of cars waiting to be parked, and a lot of people in front of the building waiting to retrieve their cars. Needless to say, Friday night is a busy night for them, so either be patient or consider somewhere else to eat. \\n\\n* When leaving, I figured getting our cars would be an issue, especially since it was 11 of us. Turns out, there was only ONE valet attendant now and my car was literally directly in front of me and had to wait until he got my key. \\n\\nThe Service: The service from the staff was GREAT. Everyone was extremely nice. The only issue I had this visit was the wait. The birthday boy had a reservation for 8:30pm. Everyone was there on time, yet we still weren't seated until slightly after 9pm. And this was after reasking about our table. \\n\\nAtmosphere: It's a Japanese restaurant, so I'm sure you can use your imagination on what would be inside. Cool Japanese artifacts and with colorful oriental decor. There's a bar in the front of the restaurant and regular tables in the far left. To the right is where the hibachi grills are. They have the shoes on side (more space) and the shoes off side (less space, but more authentic experience). \\n\\nThe Food: The food here is always delicious. You get the whole show, of course. BIG FLAMES and all. I ordered the Shrimp & Chicken ($25). This comes with white rice, noodles, vegetables, house soup and house salad. Here's what was Good & Bad....\\n\\n* GOOD -\\n\\n1) The house salad is amazing with the ginger dressing.\\n2) The teriyaki chicken was tender and flavorful. \\n3) Veggies were on point.\\n4) Yum Yum sauce. This is the second time that I've requested so much that they gave me the whole bottle for the night. I got 2 small cups to take home. \\n\\n** BAD -\\n\\n1) It took at least 20 minutes before we even received our soups or salads. After waiting an additional 30 minutes to be seated, we were pretty starved at that point.\\n\\n2) The hibachi chef was stingy with the cooking oil most of the night, so a good bit of the food was blackened, especially the shrimp. I found a few burnt flake scrapings in the noodles and shrimp. Nothing major, but on a grill that size, that hot, with that much food, you're gonna need more cooking oil than he was using. You would've thought he sprayed Pam on the grill.\\n\\nYelp Check-In: So, if you check in at Nakato, you get a BOGO free on sushi per table. We ordered the Spicy Salmon Roll ($7) and King Shrimp Roll ($10). Both were really good. The salmon tasted fresh out the sea. The King Shrimp Roll was my favorite, though. \\n\\nOverall, I've had better experiences at Nakato, but the food was still pretty damn good.

Last night we were over at Sweetwater enjoying the fabulous brews and I got a hankering for some satay.  Since we were so close, we knew we had to visit Bangkok.  When my husb stayed in Cabbagetown as a bachelor, we used to visit frequently for the num tok and drunken noodles.  Since it'd been a few years I was worried things may have changed, but no!  Yay!\\n\\nWe got satay and basil rolls and both were super tasty.  I haven't had satay in years since it's kind of an intro-to-Thai dish, but man I forgot how good it is!  I got drunken noodles with shrimp, Thai hot.  They were so salty, sweet, savory, spicy, and..succulent?  I don't know, I need another s word.  They were ssssss...o good!  Nice and spicy burn in my belly, but it wasn't like I was breathing fire.  \\n\\nThe num tok has the delicious smoky flavor of being grilled, but is also fresh and cooling with the onions and cabbage.

I'm not much of a carnivore, but I think I probably ate more meat in one sitting than I have before in my life here, and I don't have any regrets about it. Visited at the tail end of peak dinner time, it seemed, on a Saturday evening and opted to order takeout then eat outside in the huge picnic area outside of the restaurant. There was some live music happening at the beginning of our meal, which was a nice touch, and I was really glad we opted to BYOB so we could drink and enjoy the music and mild weather while waiting for the food.\\n\\nI ordered the pulled pork sandwich and a slice of pecan chocolate chip pie for dessert while my boyfriend got the 3 meat sample plate and tried the ribs, brisket, and sausage, the sides, and the peach cobbler for dessert. Ranking the meats, I liked the tender, sweet pulled pork the best, followed distantly by the brisket, which was a lot tougher, but still pretty soft and nicely flavored, the sausage, which I thought was too salty, but a nice texture, and the ribs, which I thought were just okay. And everything was made better by the spicy version of the barbeque sauce. \\n\\nOur local friends were smart and got the jalapenos and onions on the side which helped break up the saltiness of the meat, and which I preferred to the sides, which were pretty forgettable. \\n\\nOkay so at this point, I would be leaning toward 3 stars-- food was ok-good, atmosphere was the same, but also still a Very Texas Experience (see the pit, please) and potentially worth the drive for visitors-- but then, we tried the desserts. If we had just gotten the cobbler, I would've said 3.5 mayybee, but the chocolate pecan pie truly stood out. I'm not usually a huge fan of pecans or pie generally, but this one tasted like a (generous) slice of heaven -- caramelly, somehow soft but not too gooey, toasty, and not too sweet.

Suffice it to say, I failed to finish my meal and asked them for a bag, the guy working there proceeded to provide me with an aluminum foil package since they were closing. And to my great delight upon unwrapping the freebie when I got home were 5 beautifully shaped falafel patties waiting to be devoured the next day.

Tries to be a sport bar  but also tries to be a  semi decent sit down place to eat. and sort of fails at both.  clientele was varied, families and mostly 40 something women in high heels and jeans drinking martinis in a sport bar joint .. it just doesn't fit.\\n\\nThe food.. was really below par.

Lots of pieces of lobster but when  half of its  overcooked/tastes freezer burned or old.... not good\\n\\nI ordered the pizza, buffalo chicken pizza,  not really what i expected. the pizza was really thin so when you pulled a slice all the cheese and chicken slid right off. It was not fully cooked i thought. Like the mozz cheese still looked shredded in the middle instead of melted in a giant glob( worked at a pizza joint growing up  for 8 years...).  the buffalo part of the chicken was pretty hot and man i wished there was more blue cheese in the pizza....\\n\\n We let the waitress know about the pizza  and  she let the manager know, they took it off the bill, which was very nice but with the  below average on the mac and cheese and fries.... it wasn't really enough. even if they comped the whole meal, it would have the same result as it does now... we're never going back and we stopped at mcdonalds on the way home for  food.\\n\\nI'd by pass this place..."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"So this review is nearly a year after I ate there.

In Ursula K. LeGuin's Earthsea Cycle series, the mere knowledge of something's real name accorded the power to command it, to summon it, to know it, to unmake it.  I can't imagine myself every saying to someone, \\"Hey, let's go to the Lower Depths for a drink.\\"  Jim's?  Sure.  Martha's?  Sure.  The Salty Dog?  Sure.  The Century Grill?  Sure.   But the Lower Depths?  What affected hogwash.  I suppose the name is supposed to be fancy, to conjure some kind of mystique or something.  Really, the bar brings to mind goblins, and trolls, and World of Warcraft.  \\n\\nDRINKS:\\nThe Lower Depths serves up a multiple pages of multi-page drinks menu with beers broken out by type and identified by state or country.  Like a movie theater, it hints at its upcoming draft rotation under a bolded Coming Soon title.  Wonderful.  I can appreciate some of the effort.  I appreciate the variety.  I appreciate the breakdown.  But I can't appreciate the prices charged.  $6 minimum for bottles of craft beers, $7 and up for most.  Even bottled or *canned* domestics start at $4.25 and $4.50.\\n\\nIn other words, you're being taken for a ride.  Ambition is here and deserves credit.  But...\\n\\nFOOD:\\n\\"Oh, I have a good idea.  Everybody likes cheap junk food like burgers, and hot dogs, and nachos, and tater tots.  Let's take these cheap junk food items, add one or two things, and then charge as much as we can!!!\\"  The value proposition for food here is ludicrous.  $9.00 plus for tater tot \\"platters.\\"  Burgers starting over $10 with single ingredients like \\"guacamole\\" at a plus $3.00 rate.  Single hot dogs starting at over $4.00 and running over $8.00.  The value proposition here is highway robbery for simple fare.\\n\\nI ordered the Belgian dog, which was promised to be a hot dog with French fries and special house mayonnaise.  At a \\"mere\\" $5.00, this item might represent the best deal on the menu.  Alas, the house mayonnaise wasn't special in the slightest.  The hot dog was undercharred.  The bun was bland and quickly discarded.  The fries though... were quite good, crisp but not crunchy, salty, and just thick enough to leave an impression of body.  Had an order of fries been available for $5.00 all by themselves, I definitely would have taken that option.\\n\\nI can't describe the ambition demonstrated in this menu as anything but affected.\\n\\nSERVICE:\\nThe service here oozes too-good-for-thou contempt.  The waitstaff doesn't engage.  My waiter sighed whenever I requested anything.  His tip reflected my displeasure.  Another waiter was a dead ringer for a pirate.  Each appears required to move about with a rag hanging out of the right pants pocket.  \\n\\nOh, and I must remark that I find it woefully discourteous to customers for an establishment of this size and with its ambitions to not accept credit cards at all, in doing so boasting, \\"We are proudly cash only.\\"  Having to ring up $2.50 in ATM fees is the worst possible way to end a night.\\n\\nATMOSPHERE:\\nAtmosphere-wise, the naming of the Lower Depths makes even less sense.  Per LeGuin's novels, ill-named characters and items often met with poor ends.  We'll see if the same proves true of this venue.  The Lower Depths doesn't evoke any of the grungy charm of an Alphabet City dive bar (many of which really do deserve an appellation like 'The Lower Depths').  Nor does it bring to my mind James Cameron, the Mariana Trench, the Titanic, or any other undersea exploration.\\n\\nNay, the Lower Depths is visually quite stylish... but otherwise unacceptably uncomfortable.  The metal chairs and backless stools aren't good for sitting for any amount of time.  Environmental noise easily approaches too-loud-for-conversation levels at even half capacity thanks to poor noise management and overly loud music.  It's a mystery of Baker Street proportions as to why anyone would willingly order a second drink here.\\n\\nEN FIN:\\nI have a friend who makes the Lower Depths his regular spot.  I pity both him and his pocketbook.  \\n\\n3 stars for drink variety\\n3 stars for food\\n2 stars for atmosphere\\n1 star for service\\n1 star for value\\n2 stars total"},{"name":"Raglan Road Irish Pub","address":"1640 E Buena Vista Dr","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"Ragland Road is a road in Dublin, as well as the name of a well-known Irish song and poem.

On the outdoor patio, there is a 5 piece band playing favorite Irish bar tunes. The performers are very talented, and they bring high energy to the shows.\\n\\nI ordered the Braised Be. Beef. The menu describes braised beef with horseradish mashed potatoes, roasted carrots, & parsnip. The large portion of meat was tender and moist. It had a good flavor and was served in a small pot with the mashed potatoes. I would have preferred a little more sauce from the braising. Also, I was looking forward to the horseradish mashed potatoes, but I only tasted a hint of horseradish. The roasted carrots and pasnips were good, but a tad soft (I like a little more crunch). Parsnip is a turnip-colored root vegetable, and tastes similar to a carrot. I still thought this dish was a good choice, and I would recommend it.\\n\\nThere was going to be an hour wait for our table for three, so the hostess suggested that we check the bar for available seating.

I couldn't back out now, I had told Joshua C. that I would meet him at the YPOP event at 5:30pm, and it was now 6:30pm (due to the story which shall be told elsewhere).  I was in for more a pleasant surprise, however.  I was greeted by the YPOP people, served quickly at the bar, and witnessed friendly staff-patron interactions, always a major plus in my book.\\n\\nI found Joshua C., and we seriously had an awesome time talking with strangers.  Tons of interesting people.  If I were reviewing the YPOP event, this review would read 5 stars, no contest.\\n\\nThree stars, however, for Blitz Ladd.  If you are already in that neck of the woods it is probably worth checking out.  All of my interactions with the staff were very, very friendly.  The bar was swamped but service was still quick and courteous.  The food also has potential.  I can't recall the name of our creative and scrumptious appetizer, but it was basically tater tot nachos.  The menu and beer list were diverse, including everything from chili to sandwiches to local microbrews to beers I hadn't heard of.  What seems really neat about Blitz Ladd, is, like its sister in the Pearl, it also has stuff to do: shuffleboard, pool tables.  The tables were swamped by the YPOPs, so I cannot personally attest to their levelness (or whatever makes a quality pool table), but no fights broke out, so I consider that to be a good sign.  \\n\\nIn all honesty, the place is probably a little too trendy for my taste.  I appreciate more unique spots, and Blitz Ladd alone doesn't have that special pizzaz that will pull me over the Williamette and bring me back again.   Should I also happen to be there when there was not a healthy crowd, I might also be subjected to their mind-deafening music selection. I ordered the Hawaiian pizza because it is my favorite, even though I had been  forewarned that their burgers were better. Definitely tasty, but there are dozens of places in my hometurf which are better.

This too was with a lot of meat tenderizer and it was overcooked at the center... It had some kinda of green spice coating and it was served  on Peshwai sauce( red) ...

I lived in Italy for ten years and had such high hopes. When we arrive the place was packed, it was around 6:30 p.m. but there was no line and we did not have a reservation. So that is a plus. 1. It is too dark. It does not add to the ambiance or seem in any way romantic, just really really dark, like they are too poor to have proper lighting. 2. While I love the rustic charm of trattoria style glasses an Italian would never ever serve a bottle of Brunello di Montalcino to anyone in a glass like that. 3. Italians do not usually have bread on the table, but we ordered the focaccia to taste it. It was fair, and seriously over priced as is the bread basket. This place is really trying to ekk out every penny from its patrons, for the prices here they could give a little bread away. 4. The portions of the antipasti tiny, and nearly all of them were overly salty. We had both types of polpette, the arancini, and the chicken liver, which tasted neither like chicken nor liver; just salty paste on burn toast. This was also the case with our pasta dishes, the rapini was good but overly seasoned and the spaghetti with clams was incredibly salty and oddly soupy. The stand out dishes were the octopus and potato salad, and the raw fennel salad. But it hardly seems worth it to go all the way there and spend all that money for two salads. Our server was friendly enough, but had no personality at all and did not add anything to our dining experience. No one greeted us, which would be unheard of in any dinning establishment in Italy, or asked us how our meal was. We skipped desert. I think for a plate of pasta for lunch or a glass of wine and a bowl of soup I might go back if I am in the neighborhood, but skip it for a destination dinner.

The first time it was okay - not great, but okay.  I got the Lomein Shrimp and Egg Drop Soup.  The second time, was a couple of days after the first time.  It was around 2PM, and I thought I'd give the place another try.  The manager was cleaning up tables, and came to the front to ask me what I wanted.  I ordered one quart of Egg Drop Soup and one quart of Hot and Sour Soup.  I paid the guy in cash. He then went in the back area where he retrieved a couple of quart sized containers.  He then brought them both around to the buffet where the soups were located.  I noticed that he had the tips of his fingers clamped over the edges of the container where he was pouring the soup - the same fingers he used to wipe dirty tables, and to count out my change.  That really turned my stomach.  Plus, he only filled the containers up three quarters full.  The first time I came here, the server filled it almost to the top - it was a different person.  Later, when I ate the soups, I thought the Egg Drop Soup tasted a little watery - I didn't notice a watery taste the first time around.  The Hot and Sour Soup tasted like beef boulion from a can.

The hash browns were a little hard, but it didn't stop me from polishing off the plate.

My only tip to those people that haven't been and are considering this choice: get some bacon on the side.

No one was waiting for tables or seats, so that's good (or a sign people already know what I found out?). It's not a huge place either, but somehow our food took about 45 minutes to come out, and when it did eventually come out (only came out after we inquired to see what happening) 2 out of 3 dishes were wonky and disappointing, one undercooked and one over cooked. That 3rd dish was a salad, pretty hard to mess up. \\n\\nThe only reasons this is not a rock bottom 1 star review is that the waitress and hostess were very nice and apologetic. That counts for something in my book. Oh, and the open concept was nice, and the location is good. Always enough parking behind the building (as I know from many El Sarape visits).\\n\\nWhat makes me want to bring it down to rock bottom 1 star is the chef came out to check on why my friend decided she wasn't comfortable eating the chicken as it appeared under cooked. While he was not exactly rude, he seemed defensive and did not apologize or offer to remedy the situation. No discount either, we paid full price for something we did not eat. I see both sides of this as my friend was a bit abrupt (but very concise in explaining her discomfort).

If I hadn't been able to compare the two one day after another, I probably would have given 5 stars to the Salt Lick too.\\n\\nThe appeal of the Salt Lick is the atmosphere. You are in the middle of Texas hill country, waiting outside with your own adult beverages, enjoying . We only waited for 45 minutes on a Friday night because we showed up before 5pm (45 minutes is nothing! People wait in line for crap at the Cheesecake Factory longer than that). The crowd waiting when we came out after finished dinner was much larger. The atmosphere itself is enough to make me want to visit again.\\n\\nFood at the Salt Lick is a deal....$20 for all you can eat? Can't beat that. The brisket and pork ribs were good, but not as good as Franklin BBQ. I will say that I enjoyed the sausage at the Salt Lick more though. I used the BBQ sauce they had on the table....its more of an orange color and is more watery rather than thick. I didn't mind the flavor, but I've heard some people aren't fans of the sauce because it tends to be more Carolina style. They will keep bringing you plates of meat as long as you keep asking for it. I think my husband had about 3 plates of brisket and pork ribs. He definitely overdosed on meat and basically passed out when we got back that night.\\n\\nMy cousin and her bf who live in Austin came with us because we were visiting, but they are both vegetarians. This is not a place for vegetarians, but they were nice enough to just hang out with us. Salt Lick has a vegetarian plate which consists of beans, cole slaw and potato salad...unfortunately we found out the beans are cooked in pork marrow, so they couldn't eat those either. I think they were hoping for other sides like mac n cheese or something. But they got a big slice of pecan pie with ice cream, and that was delicious. \\n\\nOverall, a great place to visit.

Obviously a lot of care and thought went into a unique and interesting concept (gourmet hot dogs). But, based on my experience, it's very clear that the food comes from jars, cans and microwaves and in no way justifies the ostentatiousness of the presentation. You don't need a waitress or a smart/charming dining room if your customers can get a better hot dog at a carnival.\\n\\nWhen we went, we ordered the chicago style hot dogs; they were expensive, small and covered in a neon colored sweet pickled relish, mealy tomatoes and no celery salt (like I said, carnival food... not \\"gourmet\\" by any means.) \\nWe also got the blue cheese and bacon tots, which were microwaved and covered in a white, viscous sauce (I think that was supposed to be the blue cheese... I'm still not sure.) \\n\\nMy biggest take way, though, was what a missed opportunity this restaurant represents. The layout, the decor and the concept are perfect for a spot where you order at the counter, sit down with a number and get an awesome fancy hotdog quickly without a lot of fuss. A hot dog, (especially the ones they serve here) probably take about 3 to 5 minutes to eat. Being waited on while you eat street food is unnecessary and disorienting. Having to wait on a waitress to come to your table, take your order, fill your drinks and bring you your check just seems like a waste of resources that could be better spent on quality ingredients."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"Maybe it was the 30 min drive, or the out of this world expectations everyone put on it, or the fact that triple D filmed an episode here.

Back then, it was commonplace for each family to have several goats on hand for milk and meat.\\n\\n\\"Okay, that explains the goats, but what about the screaming?\\"\\n\\nYou also need to know that during those times, it was customary to barter using these goats.  One goat was worth 12 chickens, or 5 guns, or one child, or 3 Sega Geneses.  Or any combination of the above.  But, if you wanted to trade some of these items for a goat, but couldn't afford a full goat, then the goat would have to be mechanically separated.  And since Javier Bardem hadn't yet been born, and the bolt gun wouldn't be invented for another 800 years, the goats were usually divided alive.  Hence the screaming.\\n\\nWhile I was wandering around the quaint restaurant looking for a bolt gun to end my hangover, a cook was in the basement of the Screaming Goat burning the eggs that were to become my BE&C taco.\\n\\nYou'd think he would have also burnt the eggs going into the other taco, a P&E taco, but he did not.  Nor did he put the charred eggs into the potato taco, which didn't have the potential to be that great anyway, since it lacked bacon.  Maybe he thought that the bacon's wondrous medicinal powers would unburn and soften the crispy eggs.  No one really knows.  We just know that the taco that was supposed to flush the booze from my blood with bacon fat had burnt eggs, rendering the bacon's healing powers useless.\\n\\nOtherwise, the tacos around the entire table were good.  But then again, it's pretty hard to screw up breakfast tacos.  And if you do screw up breakfast tacos, all you can really do is hope that a middle-aged man with a bad Adam Goldberg toupee doesn't show up asking you what's the most you've ever lost in a coin toss."},{"name":"King Bao","address":"710 N Mills Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Service was great; very friendly and fast.

Our hope was to just grab and go, so we weren't really interested in sitting down for the whole experience, which may be - in part - a reason why I've given a three star review. \\n\\nThe young man at the front that greeted and helped us was awesome; he was very accommodating and very understanding of the fact that we were just there to grab something and be on our way. He pointed us toward the menus, and we took a seat in the waiting area to decide what we wanted. \\n\\nAbout thirty seconds later, boyfriend and I both decided on the breakfast burrito and an apple juice. \\n\\nWhile waiting for our food, I had the chance to drink in my surroundings. The dining area isn't gigantic, but it seems to be a pretty popular breakfast spot in Boulder. Between the time we walked in the door and the time we handed our menus back, the lobby was PACKED with people looking to dine in. The decor in the restaurant seems to be pretty hip, too; it's difficult to explain, but the atmosphere was clean and gave a somewhat hipster type vibe. Maybe I'm crazy, or just don't know what I'm talking about... either way, it's pretty cool. I also got the feeling that this place is definitely conscientious of the need for sustainability and sourcing ingredients ethically... it could partially be due to the fact that the place is in the heart of Boulder. \\n\\nOnce we got our meals, the total for two drinks and two burritos came out to about $26 before tip. Initially, we both thought that was kind of a steep price for two to-go orders, but the boxes of food were stuffed, and honestly, everything is just getting to be a bit pricey in general, so we didn't really give it a second thought. \\n\\nNow on to the good part - the burritos. \\n\\nOur expectation was to get something wrapped in foil that we could take with us and easily eat in the car on our way out for the day... this was not the case. While I appreciate the effort that went into making our meals, eating a burrito with a fork and knife in a car is more than just a little difficult to do. Not only did it have a huge mess potential, the to-go containers were big and awkward on our laps. So, we decided to forego the plan to eat on our way, and wait until we could make some space for ourselves... smelling the goodness that was to come was a bit torturous while we were waiting to chow down. \\n\\nWhen we finally pulled up to our destination and were able to dig in, I'm sad to say that the burritos were a disappointment. The potatoes inside the tortilla were pretty bland, and the rest of the burrito itself was just okay; overall pretty flavorless, but palatable. It came with sour cream, black olives, lettuce and tomatoes, and black beans (or refried, if that's your fancy), but none of those ingredients were actually on the inside of the burrito, which was a bummer. It would have made it taste sooo much better!! \\n\\nThe other thing to note is that it was smothered in cheese and salsa, which I personally feel was kind of a way to add flavor, but the amount of it just overpowered everything else, and actually made the tortilla pretty soggy, unfortunately. I'm sure, had we eaten in the restaurant, this wouldn't be an issue, but I digress. I ended up only eating the eggs out of the burrito, as that was really all I could stomach. \\n\\nOverall, I'm not completely turned off by this cafe, and would definitely give it another shot, but this experience wasn't all that great. It's unfortunate, too, because we were super hungry and super excited to try it. Maybe next time will be different."},{"name":"The Old Mohawk","address":"821 Mohawk St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"My husband had been there before,  but it was my first time today.

I hate to write a negative review, especially for a new restaurant but our experience at Noodle Market was not awesome. At all. We popped in for an early dinner, around 5:45. There were just a few tables occupied. We ordered a cold appetizer (fresh rolls) and two entrees (pho soup and crispy pad thai).  We did not receive our appetizer for a half hour, which seemed excessive. \\n\\nThe fresh rolls were indeed fresh, but they were filled with shredded lettuce, a tiny bit of a basil leaf and two tiny pieces of shrimp. Basically a lettuce roll. The sauce was watery and tasted like bland watered down something else. A disappointing beginning.\\n\\nMy soup was not bad. It was served with a plate of very fresh bean sprouts and basil. The broth was tasty and the wontons were very good, but it was missing the crispy fried shallots that the menu promised, and the noodles were so overcooked they had congealed into an unpleasant lump, impossible to pull apart. But overall it had a good flavor and was attractively presented in a pretty bowl. \\n\\nThe most disappointing was my dinner partner's crispy pad thai. The menu promised crispy pad thai noodles, shrimp and chicken, egg, bean sprouts, scallions, and ground peanuts. The egg and ground peanuts and shrimp were entirely missing, You could count the bits of scallion on one hand, Same for bean sprouts. It was basically a large plate of browned noodles that were not crispy, but rather rubbery, and doused in a cloyingly sweet sauce. There were bits of chicken, but no shrimp. My poor friend picked at the chicken bits and understandably couldn't eat the noodles at all.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is noisy, with lots of families with very small children, and that was nice. The kids seemed to be having a great time, and honestly the food tasted like kid food. If you are not coming with kids, be ready for a raucous kid-filled space. I like that kind of thing, but it's not for everyone.\\n\\nThe staff was pleasant and friendly, but service was extremely slow even at that early hour, and we had to ask our waitress for our change after we had waited 20 minutes after leaving $40 for the $30 bill."},{"name":"Giacomo's Ristorante - Boston","address":"355 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Another reason why we love Yelp.

Get them in MO, KS, IA, maybe NE, and IL. I suppose because that's where most of the pork comes from.  \\n\\nAnyway -\\nThis is the real deal - or as close as you are going to get: a plate sized, thinly pounded, breaded and fried pork T-loin on a small bun, w/ lettuce onions mustard & pickles. That's the formula, add or remove stuff and you risk spoiling the flavor combo. The T-loin extends way beyond the bun in a crazy fashion, requiring you to consume some of it straight up until you munch your way down to the little bun. Fortunately they don't skimp on the pickles, mustard etc.\\n\\nThis one was delicious. However, it could be improved upon. I think it was probably deep fried once, while the \\"real deal\\" in the MW (or in NW MO anyway) is deep fried 2X. Seriously. This one was good, but the best are almost as crisp as a potato chip without being tough or hard. This one had a just bit of chewy 'tooth' to it, which meant it was still the best T-loin to be had around here. You might just like the moist version better. \\n\\nSadly, the fries are just 'OK' (frozen crinkle-cut, which is pretty authentic MO style, but they could be better since we are here in fresh/local OR). I should have ordered the sweet potato fries, they seem to be well liked and they just have to be better.\\n\\nIf you're from the MidWest,  It's like a trip home w/out the jet lag, chiggers, billboards or rednecks.

I feel like Vince Wilfork at a midnight cookie buffet. ACTIVATE THE FEEDING FRENZY!\\n\\nThe build-your-own meat&etc. plate is the sweet spot here, with a nice complementary list of craft brew by the draft and bottle. Wine and cocktails are available, but with a fairly comprehensive beer list, you won't really need them.\\n\\nJust a quick glance at my receipt from last night will assure you that The Salty Pig does not merely allow snout-to-curly-tail eating, it encourages pork consumption on a massive and uninhibited scale. My receipt will also assure you that it's not an altogether expensive habit. (Much rejoicing!)  Some favorites from the plate the fella and I culled together:\\n\\nSoppressata: a delicious and spicy cured sausage, best eaten with a slick of the house-made mustard and a bread-and-butter pickle.\\n\\nChicken liver mousse: smooth and buttery, dusted with fennel pollen. Has a nice, quiet touch of anise. I want to recreate for the holidays.\\n\\nDeep-fried pig tails: the [almost] perfect bar snack, according to my dining companion. The pork was reported to be slippery, fatty, and unctuous inside the crisp fried coating. \\n\\nCharolais: a really nice disc of subtle goat cheese, just a tinge sweet, semi-dry but not chalky. A nice change of pace from chevre.\\n\\nComt√©: because who doesn't?\\n\\nFig jam: I could eat this slathered on toast. Honeyed and warm and smooth.\\n\\nSmoked mushrooms: Slightly, just slightly, too smoky for my liking but reasonably tasty.\\n\\nAh, but of course a plate piled high with a dozen different kinds of meats, cheeses, and accompaniments wouldn't satisfy these intrepid diners, so also we ordered a couple of entrees:\\n\\nClam pizza: holy garlic, Mr. Mcgarlicpants. Do NOT eat if you plan on making out with anyone ever again. But it is completely delicious, piled high with bacon and Parmigiano and, I think, arugula. The crust was, as my dining companion put it, \\"basic, as in, the opposite of acidic.\\" Which is entirely true; there was quite possibly just a touch too much baking powder and a not-long-enough period spent fermenting. However, it was nice and thin while still maintaining a proper chew, and the toppings were top-notch and plentiful.\\n\\nPig trotter rago√ªt: the plating and presentation aren't much to look at, but my few bites (this was the fella's dish) were tasty. The pig trotter's texture is admittedly not the most pleasant with a slightly chewy, rubbery, reminiscent-of-tripe thing going on, but the taste is spot-on, the rago√ªt was well-seasoned and the pasta was well-cooked. A really comforting dish, if not the most elegant.\\n\\nService is informal, casual, quick and friendly. No qualms there. Kitchen is wide-open with a roaring pizza oven but it surprisingly doesn't interfere with your conversation too much. A couple TVs hang over the bar for the apr√®s-work or Bruins crowd. Bartender in [natch] red flannel. Hip, winsome place with a strong menu of highly-shareable plates for the pork-friendly diner? Good location near Back Bay station?

Salt Lick, you have been the end-all, be-all of my BBQ experiences ever since I first tried you back in 2002.

The coleslaw and potato salad were delicious as usual.

THE PARKING: the restaurant parking we found was surprisingly close by and free BUT not before being hustled out of $10 by a crackhead claiming to be the restaurants parking attendant. I called to confirm with the restaurant that they did in fact have someone charging for parking and was told that their parking attendant wasn't even there yet! My husband ended up cussing dude out but we got our money back. INSIDE: We get inside and the ambiance was eh at best. NOTHING about this restaurant is upscale, except the website but that's about it. They played nothing but 2Chainz which if you're trying to run an even semi-upscale restaurant at least play a damn variety of rap or whatever kind of music. Solely playing the music of the owner is a tad vain in my opinion, yet it isn't a total deal breaker. THE MENU: They had $28 ribeye dinner, a $30 twin lobster tail dinner, and fried wings lol. That's not all of course but the wings seemed out of place considering everything else on the menu. With that being said, I'm a HUGE fan of lemon pepper wings but the wings I seen (we didn't order wings) were super skinny and had a powder lemon pepper seasoning on top and they just didn't look appetizing at all. According to the young lady in our party who did order them, she stated they were bland and dry and she only ate 2. So the hubby and I finally settled on the kale salad ($7) with lobster tail ($11) on top. It honestly tasted pretty good. The lobster tail was super small, especially for $11 but again, it tasted good. The silverware didn't match. I laughed at this because I don't think I've ever left a review and complained about the silverware. Not only did they not match but they were literally dollar tree quality, wrapped in a nice quality napkin no less. I refused to buy a $12 drink so I settled for a $5 bottled beer (they don't have anything on tap). I've paid more for bottled beer so I won't complain about that. All in all the experience itself wasn't horrible. The server was great and our party was fun. Everyone else had a great time, they drank a lot and ordered hookah's but the price tag of the food compared to the quality just did not add up. In a nutshell we give the restaurant 2 thumbs down and we will not be back.\\n\\n*P.S My husband took me to Cook Out after we left because I was starving!

My biggest issue was with the service. The place was not exactly happening. There were two large parties, ours being one of them. I think it was unfair of the restaurant to give the waitress two tables with large parties. I think she meant well, but was just on a different planet than the rest of us. Who knows, maybe she was a bit new, but that makes giving her two busy tables is not right. The beer cheese soup was delicious, but was a tad bit spicy. There were just 3 croutons floating on top and I think having a topping similar to french onion soup would have been better. The menu was definitely different, almost weird. A lot of what was on it was just not my cup of tea. I had the reuben. It was actually good. I did not care for the potato salad (supposed to be German) because it had a very weird herb taste to it and would have been better with more tanginess and less herbiness.

Long story short:  Der Biergarten management decided to close the kitchen at 9:30 PM even though they were SUPPOSED to be open until midnight, and serendipity saw fit to have the National Sales Manager of Legacy Restaurant Partners, which is the parent company of both Stats and Der Biergarten, talk to my friends and me in an elevator lobby, hear that we were denied service, and attempt to rectify the problem by personally walking my group across the street and two buildings over to Stats IN THE RAIN.  My group wasn't particularly indignant or demanding, but the National Sales Manager went out of her way to offer special accommodations and a considerable discount to us!  She's my new hero.  A powerful woman coaxing a group of young men to follow her suggestion?  Yep, that's never happened before.  ;)\\n\\nStats is an upscale sports bar that is, appropriately enough, close to the Georgia Dome and Philips Arena.  For those individuals of great wealth and/or influence that like to throw money around, there are private lounges to bask in the glory of your favorites sports teams' victories and/or commiserate following the agony of defeat.  But even for us commoners, there are flat panel TVs visible from practically every vantage point, and Stats also features a large scrolling LED ticker above the bar that displays sports scores, as well as depressingly plummeting stocks.  Also worth mentioning, Stats has an unusual restroom layout, which isn't a bad thing, and the management will validate your parking for levels 4 and up at the Hilton Garden Inn across the street.  Regarding the food, the menu choices seem to be somewhat standard fare amongst sports bars.  I was there in a group of 4, and I wanted to order their barbeque variety platter for 4, but one of my friends has to adhere to dietary restrictions due to being Hindu, so I instead ordered the brisket meal.

Earlier today at 7:45 pm, I placed an order though the phone. The lady who answered informed me that the order would be ready for pick-up within 30-35 minutes. When I got to the store 35 minutes later, the manager (white male, mid-20s, w/ glasses, skinny-frame) told me that my pizza was not ready because they had not taken my order. He asked me to wait 5 minutes for my pizza -- it actually took 20 minutes before I got my pizza.  After all this inconvenience, which was all completely at the fault of the Papa Johns store, the manager did not offer any apologies, a refund, free pizza, or credit on a future order. Not only that, his entire demeanor and attitude towards me was very threatening and rude. To elaborate, while I was waiting, I noticed a sign that stated \\"If we fail to show you the pizzas, your order will be free.\\" So, when I finally got my pizza (and he did not \\"show me the pizza\\"), I brought up the statement on the sign, asking for the pizza to free. At that point, he grabbed and opened the pizza box, rolled his eyes, and very rudely said, \\"I'm showing you the pizza now.\\"  I asked him, \\"If you won't honor your sign, why bother keeping it up?\\" to which he responded by saying loudly and harshly, \\"I'm showing you the pizza now. If that's too confusing for you, then don't look at it. You don't have to look at it and you don't have to read it, especially if you can't understand English.\\" To me, I felt that he was taking advantage of the fact that I am a female foreign (Korean) international student.  I felt that because he picked up on my slight Korean-accent, he believed that I did not have a firm grasp of the English language, and so he attempted to take advantage of me. I am very upset that Papa Johns would employ someone of such bad judgement and character -- I am hoping that you will take action to discipline the manager at that branch."},{"name":"Giacomo's Ristorante - Boston","address":"355 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"When looking for a restaurant to go to in the North End, a friend told me that the only worthy one is Giacomos.

We decided to give it a try and came here for dinner. Omg, that was probably another one of my best decisions \\"ever\\", =P \\n\\nWe had a very hearty dinner. The waitress was extremely friendly and she recommended that we order the 2-persons combo since we have never been to Pio Pio's before, so that way we can try a good variety of things. Now, the rotisserie chicken was amazing...the dark meat was so juicy and flavorful, I could not have enough. And for those of you who like white meat, the chicken breast piece was also awesome and they give you green sauce on the side that you can pretty much put on everything and anything if you like to add a kick to the food. As for the plantains, we definitely preferred the sweet plantains, but there was no way we could have finished all of them cuz the portions were HUGE, even for 2-persons. As for the rice and beans, it doesn't really matter too much to me cuz I just dump a bunch of green sauce on it and I can eat a lot of that. The salad was also delicious, like the light sauce and it's a great balance to our meal. And omg, there was still fries...geez, it was SO MUCH food! We were happy campers and were extremely full coming out of that place. \\n\\nPS: We also liked the ambiance here; the lights were quite dim, which brings a romantic touch to everything.

I agree, it's very good - but maybe a little overhyped. And I didn't particularly enjoy the super hot temperature in the kitchen dining area - hot temperatures outside combined w/ hot ovens and crowded tables and people standing waiting for tables ... I'd strongly recommend coming during a non-peak time and maybe when the weather gets a little cooler. \\n\\nPizzas come in just one size, and can probably feed 2-3 people. Crust was thicker than expected ... not sure why I was expecting Napoletana to be thin crispy pizza. We came for a birthday party so I got to try a few different pizzas. \\n\\nSAN GENNARO - $21\\nMy favorite, esp. loved the sweet red peppers. Pizza also had sausage, bufala mozzarella, and cipollini.\\n\\nMARGHERITA - $18 \\nAdded pepperoni for an extra $4 since the reviews recommended this. I liked this pizza too but I liked the San Gennaro better. Pizza had San Marzano tomatoes, bufala mozzarella, basil, and garlic. \\n\\nCAPRICCIOSA - $21\\nLeast interesting of the 3. Mushroom, artichokes (not much), prosciutto (friend thought it tasted more like deli ham), and bufala mozzarella. \\n\\nCANNOLI - $3.50\\nReviews raved about the homemade cannoli so how could i resist. They have different kinds - I got the traditional. It's pretty big and worth sharing. Honestly I like Ecco's cannoli's better. \\n\\nI'll definitely be back - hopefully under cooler & more comfortable conditions :) I'll be better prepared too - it's BYOB :) Next time I'd like to try the Diavola pizza. \\n\\nFYI - a few parking spaces are available in front of the resto, next door, and along the street.

There is an upstairs and downstairs each with seats.  The upstairs has a nice view of Newbury street though, so it's preferred.\\n\\nATMOSPHERE: It's literally located inside a bookstore, you walk in and see books everywhere.  I kind of like that it's 2 in one.  I saw a lot of people studying downstairs while also getting food.\\n\\nFOOD:\\n\\nLEMON RICOTTA FRENCH TOAST - It is made with their challah french toast, which is bread and thick. In between the three layers of toast are lemon ricotta filling.  It wasn't overpowering or too much and I don't even like custard flavored/filled things.  The lemon is very subtle and the ricotta wasn't super creamy.\\n\\nIt comes covered with a blueberry sauce and a packet of maple syrup.  I actually liked dipping it in the maple syrup to taste more like french toast.  I think I could have done without the lemon ricotta part and enjoyed the plain challah french toast but it's mostly because I like plain french toast, not ones with custard/cream filling.\\n\\nCORNED BEEF HASH - We got the side because the actual dish was too much (eggs and toast).  It's homemade and you can tell, in a good way.  The corned beef is shredded and fresh, with pieces of fat.  Small potatoes and carrots are included, soft like when you've made a stew.  It wasn't my favorite, but it was tasty enough for a meat dish to our breakfast.  \\n\\nOverall - worth trying for breakfast.

It was just \\"the place down the road past the Stop and Shop and Dunkin' Donuts\\". The Piccadilly Pub turned into \\"Joe Fish\\", so we needed a pub grub place to go to when the mood struck us.\\n\\nWe've eaten there on average once every two or three weeks for the past year or so, and I can say that I've encountered a wide spectrum of experiences there (thus the 3 stars). They have different hooks on each night (25 cent wing night, Stump Trivia night, for example), so keep those in mind when/if you decide to pop in.\\n\\nFood: I usually get one of the burgers, because that's what I'm in the mood for when I stop in there (and they're good). My wife has tried the pizza, the pasta with broccoli, and the teriyaki tips as well. I've never had a complaint about my food, though one time there was a long delay for our food to come out, because something happened with my wife's pizza. They gave it to her for free, even though we didn't even ask or complain. I really wish they could expand the menu a bit further, or offer the lunchtime sandwiches in the evening as well, because it feels a bit limited. Still, keep in mind that you're in a big ol' bar, not the Cheesecake factory. I haven't tried the desserts, maybe someday.\\n\\nDrinks: I haven't had the \\"bar\\" experience here yet, so I can't tell you. We're usually just popping in for dinner because we don't want to cook, don't want to drive too far, and know what we're getting. The raspberry iced tea is good, though.\\n\\nService: There have only been one or two instances where we've felt that \\"where's our server?\\" feeling. The other visits ranged from very average to very good. Sometimes you get popcorn brought to you, sometimes you don't. I don't know what the criteria is. (A note on the popcorn: if you miss The Ground Round, and the salty yellow popcorn, this is the place for you! I actually like it). They have a salad bar, and I saw someone checking on it and noting everything, so that's a plus (quality assurance).\\n\\nActivities: They have a function room off to the side, it looked to be a good size. That's where the band/DJ set up, and they also have those \\"drink wine and paint\\" parties that seem to be the rage right now. Stump trivia is played in the main dining area/bar, and sounds like fun... except that people cheat. They cheat so badly with their phones, it's not even funny. It's also easy, because the host is set up next to the door by the hostess station, and can't see what's going on. I won't knock the place for the rude actions of the patrons, of course, but know that fact going in :)\\n\\nEstablishment: Clean, a bit dark, a bit cold. There's your sport/pop culture paraphernalia on the walls, and there are more booths than tables. The bar area is a good size, and the bathrooms are clean. It's a bit lacking in atmosphere, but it's also not overwhelming you with branding. It feels like your neighborhood bar, if they got a good deal on their lease and were able to get a bigger space. People bring their kids here, so it's really a local joint, rather than a destination.\\n\\nLocation: It's VERY easy to miss this place. It's a big square building next to Dunkin' Donuts, and the turn-in to the lot comes up on you quickly. The entrance is in the back where the parking is, and the lot is usually pretty active whenever we go.\\n\\nSo, if you're in North Reading, and looking for a burger and beer, this place is OK."},{"name":"Flapjak Creperie","address":"4220 N Mississippi Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Love this place.  For context, my wife and I enjoy crepes, but we've never loved crepes in Portland (like but don't love Le Happy, never felt enthused about Farmer's Market crepe offerings, etc.)...  On the other hand, we loved crepes when we tried them in France.\\n\\nThe crepes at Silver Moon are light, fluffy and filled with flavor.  They're made right in front of you, and the fresh toppings are prepared and incorporated right on the crepe-making thingy.  Favorite savory thus far has been a honey, brie and apple crepe, and I can't say enough about my nutella/banana and speculoos/banana go-to dessert choices.  My wife had a ham and brie on buckwheat on our last visit, and - though she loved it - I'd still recommend the \\"normal\\" batter.... though I hear the chickpea is good.\\n\\nWe've been here three times, and I highly recommend.  I can also respond, from firsthand experience, to some other reviews.  Cleanliness of bathroom or kitchen?  Not an issue, to the point where I have to wonder about the commenter.

This is the best italian restaurant I've ever been to.\\n\\nBread: The only real negative of the food here. Rough and chewy on the outside, soft but bland on the inside. 1.5/5\\n\\nFried calamari: Good starter. Not too drastically different from that of most fried calamari but this one has more flavor because they add hot peppers to the mix. 3.5/5\\n\\nBurrata: Now we're getting to the good stuff. This is basically a mozarella ball served over sliced tomatoes but boy was it good despite the seeming simplicity. The soft and yet oh so slightly chewy texture was unlike anything I've ever had before. The mild flavor of the cheese and the sweet/sourness of the tomatoes worked wonderfully together. 4.5/5\\n\\nPumpkin tortelini/butternut squash ravioli: I'm grouping these 2 together because they were both perfect and I can't decide which one I liked more. If I was to rank the best non-meat containing main courses I've had in my life these two would be 1a and 1b. 5/5\\n\\nVeal parmigana: The only non-amazing main course we ordered. Wasn't anything wrong with it, but it just tasted like any other veal parmigana I've had before. 3/5\\n\\nFettucini with swordfish and tuna in pesto cream sauce: Overshadowed by the pumpkin tortelini and squash ravioli but an excellent dish in its own right. I'm pretty jaded when it comes to pesto sauce but this was something special. Had this been my sole main course I would have still left Giacomo's completely satisfied. 4.5/5\\n\\nWorth the line.

I've come here twice: once during a Sunday lunch and the wait was about an hour and a half, and the other time was during a weekday dinner and we only waited 15 minutes. I only come for the all-you-can-eat family style BBQ (brisket, ribs, sausage, potato salad, cole slaw, beans), and boy is it worth it.\\n\\nI love how all of their meats come glazed with their signature BBQ sauce (best BBQ sauce I've had in Austin). Make sure to ask for their moist brisket, which is to die for. The lean can be tough, dry, and chewy. Personally, I've had mixed reviews with the ribs. Sometimes, they can be fall off the bone tender, but other times they're the chewiest ribs I've ever had. They have excellent sausage! It's spiced well and delicious.\\n\\nI'm not a huge fan of the cole slaw, which is vinegar based and is usually a bit bland for me. The beans are also not the best and don't have much flavor. I love the potato salad, which is basically potatoes mixed with some of their amazing BBQ sauce and onions. Make sure to get extra of their homemade pickles and jalapenos to cut the richness of the meats. Use their soft, pillowy, delicious bread to make sandwiches! \\n\\nProtips: \\n- You can request specific meats for your refills, such as brisket only. \\n- Eat until you're bloated, but make sure you finish off your last plate and order another full refill. You can take that whole refill to go!\\n- Come during a weekday for exponentially less waiting time.\\n\\nYes, this place is 40 minutes from Austin.

Why limit yourself to the flavor profile of a single entr√©e when you can mix it up with a number of shareable tapas (the Spanish equivalent of appetizers, hors d'oeuvres, dim sum, or mezze)?  \\n\\nSo, where to begin with the immense number of offerings?  To whet the appetite, we started with the Piquillo Confit.  The marinated peppers were delicate, soft, and flavorful.  We moved on the Chorizo with Sweet & Sour Figs.  Definitely an interesting pairing, especially with the balsamic glaze that had been drizzled on it.  Difficult to describe... perhaps a not too distant cousin from one of my favorite foods, bacon-wrapped dates, but more tangy.  Next up, hanger steak topped with truffle vinaigrette.  Oh my, that is what a steak should taste like.  Perfectly cooked.  Why can't expensive steakhouses get this right?  Excellent.  Then, Patatas Bravas - truly a classic and very common Spanish tapas.  Here, it was executed better than anywhere else I had ever tried it.  The garlic aioli was creamy and strong.  The salsa bravas was spicy, but not overly so.  Impressive.  Branching out a bit, we also tried the grilled venison with berries and roasted shallot.  An interesting, delicate presentation.\\n\\nTo our delight, Barcelona offered a Rioja wine flight.  I have come to adore the quality wines of the La Rioja region of Spain.  Typically, they offer a complexity of a fine French wine for less than half the cost.  Here, I sampled three different expressions of fine Rioja wines.  Overjoyed.\\n\\nOn the night of our visit, a Saturday night, we were among the bustling crowd of patrons and witness to the frenetic pace of the wait staff taking orders, churning out food and beverage, and clearing off tables.  We were seated outside.  In the tumult, a glass escaped the grasp of one of the busy worker's hands and shattered at my wife's feet.  Luckily, no harm was done and the situation was quickly remedied.  \\n\\nAs it was my wife's birthday, we were treated to Warm Chocolate Hazelnut Indulgence with raspberry sauce and coconut iced cream.  Oh, and a couple of glasses of Cava (Spanish sparkling wine).

The draft selection is huge and the bottle selection it even bigger. If you're looking for something local, unique, or rare, The Porter is where it's at. They're also very generous with letting you sample the beers on tap before making a decision. This is especially true when you set up shop at the bar, rather than a table. Tip: if you have the app Untapp'd you can look up which beers people have been checking-into at The Porter over the last couple of days. This is an easy way for me to see if it's time to make another trip over to taste a new beer.\\n\\nThe Food:\\nI've only eaten here a couple of times, but the food has always been top-notch.

The vegetables (salad-bar layout) seemed fine. The total was around $7.\\n\\nI'm giving 2 stars because I applaud the concept - there should be more pita places in the area.

From the moment we walk in the door, until the moment we leave, it's always excellent.\\n\\nThere is valet parking outside, but we happen to have used a garage because it was a nice night and we wanted to walk a bit.   We arrived early for our reservation so took a seat in the bar area, at a table.\\n\\nPROS:  There is a Ruth's Classic Menu option, which is basically a 3 course meal for a great price.  We both opted to get it, and it was $55.95 per person.   What that included:  A Choice of 4 different salad appetizers.  A choice of entr√©e w/Side and a dessert. WOW.  Great deal!   \\n\\nHere is the best part.  You see a menu pricing option like that, and you think they will short change you on the portions.  NOT the case.  The Filet Mignon we both ordered was the 11oz cut.  It was cooked exactly to our specified temps and of course, topped with melted butter on a sizzling hot plate.  We each chose a different salad and a different side to split, as the sides are family style.  Again, what a great deal.  This is 5 star worthy!\\n\\nService was great!   The waitress mixed us up some cocktails.  I assume she was also a bartender, given our seating location.  The server/runner who brought the food was hysterical and friendly.  He was very upbeat and light hearted.  \\n\\nWe ordered the mashed potatoes and the mac and cheese.  When the mac and cheese arrived we noticed it had Jalapenos in it.  Since my date wasn't a fan, we were just going to let it be... but the server saw our disappointment and ran back to the kitchen, returning later with mac and cheese, sans the peppers.  In fairness, the menu does not list the side as Jalapeno mac.  It simply says \\"mac and cheese\\" which leads you to believe it doesn't contain a kick. \\n\\nFor Dessert, we didn't like the options presented in the prix fixe menu, especially because it was nut heavy.  We opted for the Molten lava cake and Cheesecake for a few dollars more.  Worth it!   So in the end, our total meal was $59.95 per person.  Again, an absolute bargain for the quality of food you're getting.  I hope this menu never ends!  \\n\\nCONS:  On this night, I cannot think of any.  In the past, when we did Valet, the street was busy, it was cold outside, and the guys were shuffling cars like crazy.  At one point we saw our car on the side street, warmed and ready... but not a Valet in sight.  After waiting a few minutes, we walked over and stole our own car.  :)    Must have been a busy night.  The Valet part is a bit chaotic at times, and I might opt for Street or garage on a warm night.  The streets of Boston just aren't ideal for it.  \\n\\nMy suggestion would be to open up the Dessert options more in the prix fixe.  That was the only part that felt limited in options.\\n\\nOVERALL:   Top notch service.  Great food!  Steaks cooked to temp, which is pretty much the measure for a Prime Steakhouse, for me.   The 3 course meal option was a steal!"},{"name":"Polonia","address":"750 S US Hwy 17-92","city":"Longwood","stars":"4.5","text":"Went there for the first time tonight.

Plenty of space, large and small tables, comfortable chairs/couches, and work stations fill the square footage.  This gives a larger group plenty of room, couples and friends can have quiet conversations, and the remote digital nomad can face the window and pretend they're hard at work.  Or....you're just listening to 70s Fats Domino concerts on YouTube and researching Star Wars blogs. Not that I would know anything about that!\\n\\nCoffee and drinks make it special. They have worked hard perfecting specials of the month for seasonal coffee drinks and weekly sandwiches.  I mean who doesn't like a warm croissant with melted cheese and ham.  For veggies like myself, the various egg and cheese and veggie bagels do me quite well, as do the scratch made bean stews!  The rest of the deli menu fills out nicely, with a mix of breakfast sandwiches, in house made baked goods. On a rainy day these hit the spot.  For sunny days, iced coffees, house made kombucha, and fresh brewed iced teas fit the bill. They have the usual espresso drinks using Longbottom Roasts, and I am always fine with that.  They make a fine drip coffee and supply all the natural sugars, syrups, etc. and that makes me a happy guy.\\n\\nService comes with a smile here........and doesn't cost you extra!  The folks working here work hard and keep everything spotless.  They always remember your name, your drink, and more than anything, actually care about you as a person.  This alone keeps me away from any well known chain coffee place. Plus there's almost no turnover, and seeing the same people makes me feel comfortable.  Not only am I supporting a great small business, but an owner that treats their staff well and takes care of them.  You don't always find that.\\n\\nMilwaukie has a strange ebb and flow sometimes and a lot of shops have come and gone. For me........I'm right at home here.

The bar space (which is the only part of the establishment that I have eaten) bears resemblance to the neighborhood in which it graces. The bartenders are knowledgeable and friendly. And, best of all the food and drink are superb as would be expected since the kitchen is headed by Nick Rutherford (formerly of Seeger's, Quinones at Bacchanalia, and the Chocolate Bar). Both visits to the Porter have resulted in the eating of both quintessential bar food (Belgian Fries served with a charred onion mayo) as well as more unique fare (Duck confit sliders and chicken liver mousse). Everything was perfect. The sliders were a beautiful mixture of fattiness and tenderness and was accompanied with a fruity apricot compote. The flavors could not have worked better. The same goes for the chicken liver mousse which had a thin layer of solid fat on top of a ramekin of delicate mousse over a Riesling gelee. Accompanied by lightly toasted bread to spread, the flavors were an orgiastic feast for the senses. I did not want to stop eating it! \\n\\nIn addition to the cuisine, the Porter has a fantastic beer list and drink menu. The beer bargain of the year is the 17 oz Franziskaner Dunkelweizen at $4.75, a beautiful wheat beer from Germany. But the draught beer list consists of beers from the UK, Belgium, Ireland, Germany and the US with at least half at a price of under $4.00. They also have a nice and reasonably priced list of bottled beers, drinks and wine. The menu also does a great job of identifying pairings to go with each of the dishes if you don't trust yourself to make the right choice. \\n\\nThe Porter all in all is a great addition to L5P since moving into the space on Euclid in September, 2008 and I hope that it sticks around for a long time. It has quickly become one of my favorite casual places in L5P and definitely up there overall in the City."},{"name":"Trident Booksellers & Caf√©","address":"338 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I have given this place two chances.

First off, their service was unbelievably quick. It was a Saturday around 12, and my friends and I were seated right away, and when we ordered, our food came out within ten minutes, which is pretty unusual for Boston. The other thing that stood out was that they had clearly made an effort to incorporate healthy items on the menu, which had never been what I associated trident with before. Both of my friends ordered smoothies packed with superfoods. I'm not a smoothie person, so I passed on that one.\\n\\nMy two friends and I decided to order two things to share, so we got the banana and caramel stuffed pancakes and the huevos rancheros. I thought overall the food was average. The huevos rancheros didn't really have a kick to me. The pancakes were good, but as someone who orders pancakes at pretty much every brunch place I go, I would not say these left me nearly as satisfied as some of the other brunch places in Boston. They seemed too heavy, and I'm not convinced stuffing pudding into pancakes is a good combo though maybe friends thought differently. \\n\\nOverall, I think I would go to trident again because of the great vibe of eating brunch in this bookstore.

You can eat here for next to nothing, or you can spend more for diner style steak if that's your thing. \\n\\nThere are several things that I enjoy at Jim's...the Pioneer Breakfast is delicious and the Chicken Fried Steak Breakfast will do in a pinch! I know that it's probably close to blasphemy in this city full of really solid Mexican and TexMex restaurants, but I also dig the Cheese Enchiladas topped with Frontier Chili. It's a simple concoction...shredded cheese rolled in corn tortillas, topped with chili and baked until gooey...but somehow it just comes out wonderfully every time! It's standard with a side of tortillas, but they'll sub biscuits if you ask, and if I'm ordering it around brunch-time, I always do!

When I heard about the atmosphere, I was REALLY excited.  Then, I heard you could bring your own alcohol, so I got in the car with a few bottles of wine and went immediately.  \\n\\nThis place is AWESOME.  I loved sitting in the kitchen.  I watched them open a can of peeled tomatoes, straight form Italy, and blend em up to make the sauce.  I'm not sure it'd look much different if I did it, but watching them cook made me giddy like a 6 year old.  It probably helped that all the cooks are Italian, and Italians are sexy.  Even the ones that aren't good looking at all, they're still sexy because they're Italian.  Watching them cook is fascinating, and every time they threw the pizza dough up in the air, I had to stop myself from clapping and hooting.  So, the atmosphere gets two thumbs way, way up.   \\n\\nI was weary of paying $22 for pizza, but my god, it was worth every penny.  I cursed myself for picking that day to go on a diet, because honestly, I could have eaten an entire pizza myself.  We all got different pizzas, and there wasn't a slice to spare.  I don't remember the names of all the pizzas, but there was one with sausage and peppers that blew my socks off.  If there hadn't have been children around, I might have had a Meg Ryan moment right there after the first bite.  The pizza is soggy at the ends, probably because of the fresh sauce they use, but it's delicious none the less.  Food also gets two thumbs right the hell up.\\n\\nThe pizza was great.

We had been building up to a restaurant of this caliber and we had been looking forward to it for weeks. It was our first tasting menu, and certainly our most expensive meal. The ambiance within the restaurant was unreal; walking in and immediately seeing the open kitchen was very impressive. The chefs clearly aren't afraid to showcase their work under scrutiny and the energy of the kitchen was felt throughout the dining room.  We were probably the youngest in there (22) by a few years, but oh well.  Parking sucks especially on a weekend, and after driving around for 10-15 minutes and getting frustrated I just said screw it and opted for the valet--12$ is peanuts compared to the total cost of the meal.\\n\\nWe opted for the 6 course tasting menu--everything was prepared perfectly and I tried many things for the first time.  I'm recalling things from memory, so I really only remember the main component of the dish, and not the many accoutrements that came with each.  Bread and 'still' water were aplenty, and got us off to a nice start.  Didn't really recognize any alcohol on the cocktail list....so I opted first for the Northern Lights (recommended by the waitress) which was delicious. First course was a trio of seafood--sea urchin on the left, hamachi with sturgeon roe in the middle, and monkfish liver pate on the right.  I'd never had sea urchin before; it definitely had an interesting texture and taste, but I enjoyed trying it for the first time. The monkfish liver was great-you could tell it was an organ but it had a lovely taste.\\n\\nSecond course was scallop sashimi; this dish was amazing. Remarkably clean tasting. Third dish was wahoo (I think); best piece of cooked fish I've had.  At this point my girlfriend and I looked at each other and started questioning if we should have done the 8 course tasting; good thing we didn't! Each dish increased in both size and complexity. The fourth course was beet fusilli pasta with a venison ragout. The pasta was great and had a little bite to it. The combination with the venison was delicious. Finally some meat! \\n\\nThe fifth course was the show stopper. But first I'll comment on the bone marrow side dish (10$) that came at the same time.  Three roasted bones were served accompanied by toast and salt.  This was my first experience with bone marrow, and I can only attribute it to 'meat jelly.' I loved it; the crazy texture with the rich, heavy meat flavor was great while spread over the crunchy toast.  Back to the fifth course: a trio of veal.  On the left, grilled tongue, on the right, sweetbreads. This was centered by veal short ribs that fell off the bone. Again, it was my first time with both tongue and sweetbreads. I think one of my favorite bites of the night was the tongue: not at all chewy, with a lovely flavor. The sweetbreads were also surprisingly very tasty. I knew the dishes were being prepared by professionals, so I dove in at the chance to taste some offal!\\n\\nBefore dessert we were served a palate cleanser, which was a vermouth granite, some type of gel on the bottom, with white chocolate on top.  I wasn't sure to make of this; I remember exclaiming 'whoa!' as I put the first bite into my mouth. Not really savory, not sweet, with the interesting flavor of the granite transform from ice to liquid in my mouth. Very cool.\\n\\nWe were served two desserts to share; one was a homemade coffee ice cream with tobacco and dehydrated marshmallows. I'm not a huge coffee fan, so I dove into the other one, a panacotta with pineapple and coriander crumble. The texture and flavor of the panacotta was AWESOME. One of the best bites of dessert I've ever had.  \\n\\nI should mention at this point I was ridiculously stuffed, bashing myself for thinking that Tony Maws would have me pay $300+ for two people and leave hungry! But no, I was stuffed to the point of bursting at the end of the sixth course, and sat back partially buzzed from the Northern Lights and Improved Whiskey Cocktail (very strong!).\\n\\nOverall, an amazing night, weaved with unbelievable flavors and textures, with ingredients I had never tasted before. Definitely a special occasion type of restaurant, unless your wallet can afford $150 per person frequently. I can't wait to save up and come back, perhaps for the prix fixe menu (pig's head, anyone?) or the ultimate Craigie experience.\\n\\nI will voice a few \\"negative\\" takeaways from our experience.  The only real disappointment was that we were promised a high table looking into the kitchen when we made our reservation. We didn't get it and instead were situated against the wall with another table to my left at a right angle. I really would have liked to view the kitchen from the high table we were promised!  We also had to ask our waitress about the bone marrow side, as it took 4 courses from when we ordered it to get it.\\n \\nOh well, this place ROCKS!"},{"name":"Standard Hall","address":"1100 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"There are no vegetarian or vegan options.

Also the servers must figure they won't earn as much in tips with the lower bill totals.\\n2) I've heard too much about Chambar and usually it doesn't live up to the hype.\\n3) I've had mussels at enough restaurants that I thought I knew what I was getting into.\\n\\nBut the night went as perfectly as it could as we looked like VIPs when were just punctual for our reservation just after a Canucks game. There was a slight wait but it was nothing compared to the post-hockey crowd. The server was as expected crazy busy with the Dine-out reservations but she definitely was able to cope with it. I thought I would skip the mussels since I've had enough mussels everywhere else that I wanted to try something else. But this was the one mistake she made that she deserved a bonus tip for: she gave me the mussels anyways (it wasn't her fault really since I deliberated too long on whether to get the mussels)! When I pointed that out to her, she apologized and brought my originally ordered dish anyways even though the mussels had blown me away and I insisted I was more than happy with the mix-up.\\n\\nAnd somehow I made more room (as I usually do when it is worthwhile to do so and this was one of those cases) for the braised brisket. I remembered that I already eat too much brisket in my Chinese diet so perhaps I shouldn't have ordered the brisket. But then again - this was an unexpected delicious and still succulent braised brisket.\\n\\nWithout getting into more detail as there are many more reviews to get into the food - there is an endless list of Belgium Beers that cannot disappoint, the appetizers were not bad, and the entrees just exponentially skyrocketed the dining experience, and the dessert was not gratuitous in the very least. \\n\\nMy five star rating is appropriate for our experience and the best $38/person we've ever spent."},{"name":"Giacomo's Ristorante - Boston","address":"355 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"We kept seeing huge lines waiting to get in, so we decided to try them out.

Wow!  It is definitely on our list of top three burgers we have ever tried!\\n\\nThe burger ($18) is made of grass-fed Hardwick Beef.  To make up for the leanness of grass-fed meat, they add pure beef fat -bone marrow and suet into their burger mix of sirloin, short rib, brisket and dehydrated miso paste for a kick of flavor.  The burger is then steamed in a CVap oven and then grilled on a steel plancha.  The result is a perfectly charred and juicy patty.\\n\\nMaws only makes about twenty burgers a day, so if you want to give it a try, you have to go on the early side of dinner (5pm - 6pm) or brunch service.  If you are going for dinner, you can only order the burger in the bar area of the restaurant.  You won't find the burger on their menu so don't be afraid to ask your server for it.  I also recommend making a reservation a week in advance as the bar doesn't have much seating.\\n\\nIn addition to the burgers, I surprised my boyfriend by ordering one of their delicious cakes.  The cakes are fairly expensive ($42 for a cake that serves 1-3 people) , but you won't be disappointed!  I ordered the \\"pastry chef's whim\\", and we were pleasantly surprised to get a lemon chiffon cake that has layers of lemon chiffon, lemon curd, homemade orange marmalade, and white chocolate butter cream frosting.  Yum!\\n\\nWe have both tried their \\"chef's whim\\" tasting menu (which we both thoroughly enjoyed).  However, if you are a burger fan, I highly recommend you go to Craigie On Main to try their burger! \\n\\nAnd, if you are unable to get a reservation (or they have already run out of burgers for that day), go to Four Seasons.

This place serves up everything a five star restaurant should: superbly delicious food, beautiful plate presentation, perfectly trained wait staff, and an atmosphere that is elegant and inviting without being pretentious or overwhelming for the average Joe who also enjoys a $5 burger meal from In-N-Out on occasion. \\n\\nFood:  My date and I each ordered the chef's prix fixe meal.  Our server asked us if we had any food allergies or aversions and from there every item placed in front of us was a surprise.  A delicious surprise!  Not one serving disappointed.  \\n\\nService:  The service was probably the best I have ever had.  I have eaten at other \\"five star\\" restaurants where the wait staff was so attentive that I felt like they had joined the dinner table with me; not so at Craig on Main, there wait staff are like ninjas.  They just show up quietly and without intrusion when something is needed and then they quickly vanish without a sound.  \\n\\nPrice:  For a cocktail at the bar while waiting for you table, the prix fixe with wine pairing, tax, and gratuity expect to pay $125 per person.  If you love food and good service, then you will surely get what you pay for at Craig on Main. \\n\\nSide Note:  The day I ate here, I came down with a head cold and was not in the best of moods when we went for dinner.  None the less, the experience was great!

The tastebuds were in heaven:  pearly grains of perfectly cooked and seasoned rice, as sushi rice should be, combined with the freshest seafood in the appropriate toppings-to-rice proportions.  Sockeye salmon was the standard. There was nothing remarkable about the soba, but the dashi was the real highlight in the pairing.  It had this super distinctive smokiness to it -- very generous use of bonito.   The food is definitely worth 4.5 stars, based on this particular visit.  \\n\\nThe service, however, if there is any at all, is pathetic.

The jukebox is fully stocked with awesome indy/alternative/rock music mixed with classic 30s 40s songs.  Where else can you hear Bessie Smith followed by The Pixies?  Super!\\n\\nThe menu is unlike anything I've seen before, ranging from home foods like creamed chicken over biscuits, meatloaf, and a Turkey TV dinner that even comes on a little Red TV tray.  They have more spicy options on the menu than any place I've ever seen and I can't even begin to imagine how much cayenne pepper they go through.\\nAs I'm sure you know by browsing through some reviews-  Surly Girl Pizza is the star of the show.  It would be an affront to God to go here and not at least try it.  That being said, everything on the menu is good.

A friend and I ordered the wild mushroom pizza and calamari. The pizza was orgasmic delicious! I bit into the crust first to try it out and it had the right amount of crisp and chewiness that makes the perfect fire stone pizza. The only problem we had was that it wasn't sliced which required us to use not so sharp butter knives to try to make an incision.

The quantity of the noodle is not huge so it's a good portion for lunch. The noodle texture was chewy and fresh, which was a good surprise to me. Don't expect large pieces of chicken though.

The only bad part is that the carrots' texture was all wrong, kind of gross actually.  I think they use frozen carrots.  Oh and there's only sriracha at the table, no chili oil.\\n\\nThe veggie spring rolls were not so good. It felt heavy and greasy, and I felt like they fried it in a general pot of oil that they use to fry other meats because the taste was a bit \\"mixed\\" and not in a good way. \\n\\nWe also tried the grilled chicken and grilled beef baguettes one evening. The baguettes are quite big and satisfying. There is not much meat in it, but then each baguette is under $5 so you get what you pay for. The sauce on top of the meat is sweet and spicy.

Oxtail stew is arguably the best dish available at any Jamaican restaurant, unfortunately everyone does not do it well. Calypso Cafe does not do oxtail stew well, they make a good effort - and the accompanying cooked cabbage and peas and rice were good. But the oxtail was  decidedly second tier.

I could sense the wait staff were trying hard to keep the tables happy, but the front-of-house staff member (who admitted she was new) had a hard time balancing people coming in to eat against the takeout requests.

I just sat and listened to their small chat as the bartender came around. The patron started in on the bombing and pretty quickly proved to be anti boston and more on the pro bombing and death to america and it's government. \\n\\nI was appalled, totally sober, satisfied with my pizza and furious. I was appalled that the bartender didn't put this anti prick in his place and send him packing or at the very least tell him that his views don't reflect the patrons of the night and that he should tone it down. Instead it was me who asked for my tab, paid, snapped a picture of the asshole and left. \\n\\nI most likely never to return to Salty Pig again because someone took the almighty patrons dollar, forced equally paying patrons to listen to insensitive remarks over the horrific situation we were all just put through and continue to be put through to this day. I didn't shy away from my comments to him and wondered allowed that if we tolerate this type of behavior, where does it stop? Are jews, blacks and gay slurs to be tolerated because the financial stability of an establishment takes precedent over morality? I will find other places where I can dine, drink and be merry with ALL classes of tolerant people. It's the best thing in the world to be given freedom of choice and speech and I plan on exercising mine by not returning to places that don't respect sensitivity."},{"name":"Raglan Road Irish Pub","address":"1640 E Buena Vista Dr","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"Great location at Downtown Disney with tons to do.

The first couple hours went good we were not bothered everything was going well. As soon as my Hispanic side of my family started to show up, the owner (Gale) kept coming into the function room standing in the corner with a grouch face and her arms crossed watching us like we were children. She popped in several times and at one point it started to get uncomfortable. One of my guests went into the bar and ordered a Corona beer and brought it back into the function room. The owner Gale immediately followed him into the function room snatched his beer and said he cannot get served because he has a out of state ID. Mind you my family drove 2 1/2 hours from CT to come to a 4 hour party. He immediately asked for his money back and she continued to yell no way. This was the most rude customer service experience I have ever experienced. After this she literally followed this man in and around the function room I was renting. This made my guests VERY uncomfortable. As she continued to monitor my party one of my guests went outside with a cup of soda. She went over to him and snatched it out of his hand and started to yell that he can't bring drinks outside and accused him on it being alcohol. When he said put my drink down and I will grab it when I come back inside I actually seen her pick up the drink and sniff it!! How disgusting is this woman. Then when he almost left with a drink of soda she started to yell again and had three big white guys who don't even work there and we're just regulars at the bar come INTO MY FUNCTION ROOM I WAS RENTING and start to try and talk down to my guests. I felt nothing but racial profiling here. I can't believe I did not get my money back and I cannot believe they would not give my guests there money back for the drinks they bought that they took away.

It seemed like me placing an order over the phone was going to be impossible so I said I would come order in person. \\n\\nTrying to find a parking spot to pick up there has always been a challenge but now that one end of Broad street is shut down, it's like a labyrinth trying to navigate the busy one way streets. After finally finding a metered spot I went in to order. My sandwiches passed through 4 different people from the time of ordering to getting all the toppings on, at no point did I know who I was supposed to be talking to and was made to feel like an idiot for not knowing when I was passed off. The entire process was very frustrating for myself, though I didn't make it become known and also frustrating for the employees which were very obvious about it. \\n\\nThe entire reason I went through all these lengths to get this food was because we wanted some of the delicious soups and sides. Since the website was down and I couldn't order over the phone I had to find out in person that they no longer had the Lobster Bisque, staff member condescendingly laughing and saying \\"we haven't had that for 6 months or more\\" as though I frequent some sort of Reubens Sides blog daily, though it is still listed on allmenus.com.  http://puu.sh/pwi7S/f9b52bd40d.png which is where I had to go since Reubens site wasn't working. Then they were out of the broccoli cheese. Again a member of the staff became frustrated with me when I told him I was going to have to call back to the office to figure out what I needed to substitute with. I finally was given a soup option and potato salad. I said I'd take a medium soup and large potato salad. I was told potato salads come in 3rd, half and full pints which means absolutely nothing to me and there were no samples of these sizes pasted to the wall like most places. Confused I said \\"I'll take a 3rd\\" which I found was basically a glorified ramekin and changed that order to the half which again frustrated the staff.  \\n\\nAs I was leaving this utterly frustrating experience I voiced my displeasure with the entire process by saying \\"If you aren't going to take orders over the phone you should get the website fixed so this is an easier process for us all\\" in that time an employee went to the site and reported back to me like I was a crazy person \\"Well, I just looked and the site is working\\" .... After getting back to my office the site is indeed still down and doesn't work from any of our mobile phones either. http://puu.sh/pwiMP/83f662c236.png\\n\\nAs great tasting as the food is, that's my last time I'll deal with trying to get an order from this deli again.

Love the spice too!  Get some extra betel leaf tempura when you order it, they are amazing!\\n\\nSai Ua Samun Phrai - this sausage and sticky rice combo was great. The sausage had a little heat and a lot of juice. Tons of flavor.\\n\\nMuu Paa Kham Waan - Really enjoyed the marbling of the boar collar and the seasonings.  You could really taste charcoal flavor in it.\\n\\nWings - Delicicous. Probably best eaten in the restaurant to retain crispness.\\n\\nKhao Soi Kai - We got this with chicken. And this was the absolute best curry I've ever had.  The complexity of the seasoning combined with the freshness of the house pressed coconut milk was a flavor overload!\\n\\nKhao Soi Neua - Another great curry.  Differently textured and beef flavor really came through. \\n\\nYam Makheua Yao - This eggplant dish was my the best thing I've ever eaten. The texture of everything remained intact during my drive home. And the flavors of eggplant and shrimp, combined with the egg and accented by the spicy thai chilies."},{"name":"Mozart's Coffee Roasters","address":"3825 Lake Austin Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Mozart's was the first place I was asked to visit when I said I was moving to Austin, 6 years ago.

I love this place already, it's BYOB!  We drove through miles of endless hills otherwise known as \\"Hill Country\\" to get to The Salt Lick from Lady Bird Lake.  When we got there, we drove through the ranch to get to the biggest dirt parking Iot so it had the capacity to hold a party for the Hill Country!  There were so many people waiting outdoors sitting on the wooden bench tables waiting to be seated.  The wait was an hour and a half.  So we decided to order from their take-out section and eat at one of the wooden tables outside instead.  It was a real humid day and I would have rather sat inside in the air condition and experience the whole environment inside, but instead...this review is for the food and the outside seating atmosphere.  I ordered the combo which came with beef rib, pork rib, and the sausage. All this for a steal of $11.95!  I enjoyed all three and I'm not a big BBQ fan either because the thought of drippy sauce would overwhelm my mouth.  The beef rib sauce was dry which is the way I like my ribs.  It was very tasty and not messy at all.  My mouth was ot drowned in sauce and the meat was tender.  The pork ribs were tasty as well, but I didn't care for it too much since there was more sauce and couldn't taste the flavor of the meat as much.  The sausage was good.  If you like spicy hot dogs...this is what it tasted like!  The BYOB came in handy on this humid evening eating outdoors.  As we ate, more flies swarmed our table due to outdoor dining and the tastiness of the food.  I could've done without extra guests.

Heather F. suggested we hit up Salt Lick instead and I am glad we went.\\n\\nWe got there early and tailgated with mimosas. While we were the only two drinking at 10:30 am in the parking lot, an employee named Randy didn't seem to think twice about it. I instantly fell in love with the grounds. Nice courtyard area with a gorgeous water fountain, shaded picnic tables and a large covered patio in the dining area. They also have a lush vineyard. \\n\\nThe staff was helpful and service was very quick. They saw Heather's 6 pack of beer and they produced a bucket of ice to keep those babies cold. For lunch I ordered the Rancher which is a \\"sampling\\" of four meats: turkey, sausage, pork rib and brisket. While they do not allow for substitutions you do get your choice of brisket, fatty, lean or burnt. I went with burnt. My favorite meats were the brisket and the sausage. The sausage was excellent. The juicy slices were flavorful. The burnt brisket was fatty and loved the charred burnt flavor. The turkey was lean, moist and likely the healthiest of the meat options. The pork rib did nothing for me. One thing I will do differently next time is order the BBQ sauce on the side as they serve the pile of meat with sauce. The plates come with potato salad, coleslaw, beans and bread. I loved their potato salad and liked the crunchy not too creamy coleslaw. The homemade bread was fresh and soft. The beans were OK. I found this to be more food I could eat during lunch but I brought a container for leftovers. Notably the sausage leftovers tasted great on a flour tortilla.\\n\\nOverall all I say 3-3.5 for the BBQ but the service and atmosphere easily warrants 4 stars.

The pies looked alright. I can definitely tell you that the pecan pie looked pretty difficult to eat because it was hard to break apart even when it was warmed up. They definitely had to go at it in order to even get bites from the pie. Although it seemed difficult to eat, I heard that it tasted fine. Coffee would definitely be my first choice for ordering when I go here."},{"name":"Craigie On Main","address":"853 Main St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"25,000 calorie Pig's Head?\\n\\nIf having the pork rib and belly at Rialto for dinner on Friday and bacon for breakfast on Saturday wasn't enough, my wife and another couple decided to have some Pig Tails and to share the Pig's Head at Craigie on Sunday for dinner.  We didn't have reservations, but since I only live a few blocks away from this epic establishment, it wasn't much of a detour to see if there were any seats available at 5:30 PM.  We got lucky as there happened to be a cancellation for a 4-person table in the bar area.  I didn't feel super lucky though, seeing that the restaurant was two-thirds empty.  I later realized that most of the tables were allocated for later reservations and by the time our appetizers came, the house was packed!\\n\\nI should mention that we got the corner table in the bar area by the wall closest to the receptionist at the front door.  There was draft coming from the ceiling A/C that made the corner seat cold.  Fortunately, Craigie's staff brought our ladies cashmere shawls to keep them warm!  Dang!  Taking the details of customer service to another level.\\n\\nSince we had lunch only 4 hours ago, we only ordered the pigtails, Craigie Burger, and the Pig's Head.  They service Iggy's bread, Francese, which is their mild sourdough to be exact!  I love Iggy's Francese with butter, so we had about 2 baskets of that before the app came.\\n\\nWe started off with the pigtails.  The average person would find the sound of these to be REPULSIVE sounding and I had my doubts, but the candid-sounding assurance of the waitress, \\"people will fight for the last one,\\" took care of any doubts I had.  When the pigtails arrived, they looked like wonderfully browned/crispy pieces of pork.  The closest reference I have visually is the crispy pork at Latino shops.  The pigtails had a perfect balance of marinade, meat, fat, and tendon.  To properly enjoy the pigtails, one must use a combination of fingers, nibbling, and sucking.  Absolutely messy and labor-intensive (like eating Jamaican oxtail from the bone), but absolutely delicious and rewarding when you can suck off the pigtail yumminess under the arches and cavities of the pigtail cartilage and between the joints.  Each person at our table got their hands dirty and I was so proud of us 4.\\n\\nAfter our yummy pigtails, our Pig Head and Craigie Burger arrived.  The pig's head was actually only 1/2 the head, basically 1 side of the profile, eyeball, cheeks, and teeth in tact (no tongue from what I could see of the roasted beast).  The pig's head was served Peking Duck Style with the thin, pancake wrapper, hoisin sauce variant, and an orange slaw.  They say it's a pig's head for 2, but I cannot see how 2 people could finish this thing.  I'm estimating about 25,000 calories total alone for the pig's head.  The taste of the facial meat in the eye sockets, around the ears, cheeks, chin, nose, forehead were all of surpremo quality.  Super soft and tender like it had been slow-cooked for a day.  The challenge was to figure out how much of the fat to eat.  There was so much blubber surrounding each piece of meat.  It felt wasteful to trash the blubber give this was a $70 head, but soooooo much blubber, like at least 15,000 calories in fat alone.  As believers of eating the whole animal and not wasting any bit of the meal, we tried to eat as much of the fat and skin as possible, but to put it bluntly, my mouth and stomach was coated in pork fat about 75% of the way through the Pig Head.  My beer couldn't wash it down anymore.  Conclusion: don't try to finish all the blubber!\\n\\nThe Craigie Burger was the redemption burger for me.  I had a failed burger from Craigie the first time I came about 2 years ago.  Perhaps, this was during the blowup period, when the burger was wildly popular and Tony Maws was getting his meat from an inferior meat supplier instead of Hardwick feef, his typical supplier.  Speculation aside, I was ready for Rev 2.0, so I could compare it with Radius, Sel De La Terre, Garden, Porter's and other gourmet burgers of Boston.  I found it to be amazing and redemptive, but not as amazing as the Radius burger.  Equal portions of short rib, flap meat, and brisket with 15% suet and bone marrow to balance out the leanness of the meat formula.  Perhaps, it was the pig tails as an appetizer that spoiled it for me.  Next time, I'll have to have the burger as a stand alone meal to get a more accurate assessment.\\n\\nThe Craigie experience was phenomenal as everyone makes it out to be.  The pig's head could be a 5 star meal, but just don't try to eat all the blubber as we did!  I'll be back for the 10 course tasting menu next time!"},{"name":"Flour Bakery + Caf√©","address":"12 Farnsworth St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"This place is amazing.

Everything is delivered family-style and per place prices range from $18 - $34. \\n\\nI splurged for the Beef Wellington (the $34 option) and it was, hands down, the best one I've ever had.

Really rather large in size which is great. The calamari was cooked perfectly, soft to the bite. The seasoning was slightly lacking. A bit more salt would have elevated the dish more. The caprese salad was average with balsamic, mozzarella, and big slices of tomato. Good and simple.\\n\\nWhat disappointed us was the actual pasta and seasoning. I got the fusilli with lobster and Giacomo sauce. The sauce itself was very underseasoned I thought. I was adding salt to my dish. The pasta was even worse, super soft and mushy. Not the al dente I would expect from any well-rated Italian place. Only saving grace was that the lobster was plentiful in the dish. My boyfriend got the butternut squash ravioli. Now that was actually really well made. Butternut squash was mashed well. Great flavor with the creamy sauce it was accompanied with. The ravioli itself was al dente. I enjoyed it but it was overwhelming if that was the sole dish. A lot of sweetness and cream that builds with more and more ravioli.

I'm a Guinness drinker and I didn't even want another one. The food was terrible not even ok it was so gross, cold and a waste of money.  Got the chicken tenders which didn't even come with anything to dip it in ??? And the spinach dip which was served with some delicious STALE corn chips. We will NEVER be returning. I work in the restaurant business myself so I aways give the benefit of the doubt, but this place, not good !!! Sorry not so great American tavern I tried, but I have to warn the others.

The closest bookmarked place was here so off we went! I love Indian food so I was quite excited. The issue: we're vegetarians and we don't eat onions or garlic. Normally, this isn't too much of a problem at vegetarian Indian restaurants as they usually have some options for Jains (no onion/garlic vegetarians and also no root vegetables).  I usually just go to an Indian restaurant and ask them if they have Jain food.\\n\\nThis place isn't very Jain-friendly. It does serve meat but technically is vegetarian friendly. I guess the meat part should have sounded off an alarm of sorts. \\n\\nThe place is easy to find. It's a bright building with its own private lot. We were greeted almost immediately and seated by a friendly guy and were offered lukewarm (not iced) water. Both of the people that I could see working there were Caucasian. I liked the decor and everything was clean. I had to go to the restroom first but as soon as I returned to the table, he was there asking Hubby if he was ready to order. I told him about our dietary restrictions and from the look on his face, it looked like we wouldn't have many choices. \\n\\nTurns out we could only have the dal (lentil) soup and the plain naan. Everything else was prepared ahead of time and couldn't be made without onion or garlic. After a brief discussion, we decided to just order an order of soup and naan to share. \\n\\nThe soup was pretty good and on the salty (flavorful) side. The naan was wonderfully tender, warm, and crispy on the outside. They went perfectly together. While we were waiting, the kitchen was preparing the other table's order and it smelled delicious. I wish I could try other items on the menu. \\n\\nMy rating in the end is that the only items we could order were good. Even Hubby, who isn't terribly fond of Indian food, thought it wasn't bad. The service was good and helpful and cleanliness was up there as well. The bathrooms were clean and located towards the back behind the cash register - there are two single rooms and are pretty roomy. My main complaint is that we couldn't get a full meal, but ultimately bumped up the 3.5 stars to a 4 because it really isn't their fault. \\n\\n...but try to have more Jain options, please."},{"name":"Burger Tex","address":"5420 Airport Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"Burger Tex looks like one of those big empty backwoods truck stops where you order a couple of burgers cause damn you're hungry after driving through the forest at night.

This along with Franklin's was recommended as a must eat location. Because the lines for Franklin were notoriously long, we decided to hit up Salt Lick BBQ instead. \\n\\nInstead of the all you can eat (which is a food coma waiting to happen) we decided on just trying a sampler platter which had everything excluding the Chicken and Beef Ribs. We ordered those separately.\\n\\nFirst off the sausage and brisket were awesome. The smoke ring and flavor was awesome (just what I would expect from Texas BBQ), however the sides were definitely lacking in taste. The mashed potatoes were pretty awful and the beans tasted like they were out of a can. The bread was soft and flavorful. The chicken had a nice char on the outside that had a sweet tang to it, but the meat itself was kind of dry. The Beef Ribs were delicious (personally better than the pork ribs in my opinion), however at $9.95 for one rib, a bit overpriced in my opinion.\\n\\nLastly we tried the Peach Cobbler with Blueberry Cobbler and were really disappointed. It honestly tasted like canned peaches and a hell of a lot of cinnamon mixed in. The Blueberry was worse, tasting much like cough syrup that I had when I was a kid.\\n\\nOverall, if you're looking for just BBQ, Salt Lick is a place you gotta try.

Next up was the herb brined and roasted chicken with sunflower seed and dill dumplings. It came out succulent with perfectly crispy skin and a delicious citrus aroma. The dumplings were a bit heavy and bland, but served to balance the strong flavors of the chicken, braised kale and jus. \\n\\nThe highlight of the night was the dessert though. As the waitress said, they saved the best for last. A chocolate buckwheat cake served with an impossibly creamy goat milk caramel ice cream and blackberry jam, paired with a spanish malbec port-like wine. The chocolate buckwheat cake had an interesting texture. The chocolate cake wasn't overly sweet and didn't have an overpowering chocolate flavor and went very well with the creamy and sweat caramel ice cream.

For those of you who have not yet had the pleasure of tasting the glory that is Hainan Chicken Rice, let me take some time to explain. Hainan Chicken Rice originated from Southern China, and is now popular beyond China, through Singapore, Malaysia, even Thailand. \\n\\nÊµ∑ÂçóÈ∏°È•≠ is a light chicken on rice dish.

Now, please do not get full just on the chicken because the rice is just as important in this dish.

The other two times I came here and ordered a plate Spicy, it tasted great with the perfect amount of spice. Today, the plate hardly had any noodles in it along with the most spice I had ever seen in any plate of food in my life(at least 90% of the noodles were covered in chili peppers). And I've been to Thailand so I know the exact amount of spicy that good Thai food should be like. After eating one bite and having it make my stomach hurt and me feeling nauseous, I went back to the Sawadee food truck to ask them to fix my plate, since this was not the quality or type of cooking I was used to from their food truck. The girl working (has blue hair-avoid if you see her working) gave me the rudest look and acted like there was nothing wrong with the plate of food. When I saw that she was going to do nothing to suggest how to fix my disappointment, I suggested that maybe if she could add more noodles, it may make it edible for a human to consume. She took my box of food went to the back of the truck and returned it to me and gave me another rude look. I paid $7 for the plate of food on the hottest day on the planet today (100 degrees outside). I expected better customer service as well as a more edible plate of food from this food truck. Thanks for the crappy service and food today, I will not be a customer of yours ever again and I will tell everyone I know as well. \\n\\nUpdate: After not being able to eat for about 5 hours because of how spicy and unappetizing this plate of food was from Swasdee, I brought home the rest of the food hoping to finish it later. I opened the box only to realize that no new noodles had even been placed in there and a few bites ended up making me feel nauseous again. I ended up tossing the entire plate of food because I didn't want anyone else to feel as sick as I did. Not sure who hired that incompetent girl working in the Swasdee food truck but whoever did, needs to rethink their hiring process and make sure their food quality standards are reviewed every day."},{"name":"Craigie On Main","address":"853 Main St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"The overall dining experience is aesthetically pleasing to senses.

After all, I'm pretty sure that the horrible swemidity (ie humidity caused by the collective sweat output from a huddled mass of deodorant-hating jocks in a confined space) was due largely in part to the type of crowd said establishment attracts.  Not even the open sliding doors could combat this horrific wave of heat and bodily urea production, and we all felt as though we needed a shower afterwards.

Because of the large crowd, we could not all get seating near each other to celebrate the birthday; we were scattered throughout the large space without any way to really interact with the rest of our party.  I know that is not the fault of the venue in our case, but it does illustrate a lack of planning for larger groups of people - there are very few actual tables that accommodate more than your average booth.\\n\\nOn top of that, service was intolerably slow - even when forced to go to the bar to get our own drinks, it was easily a fifteen minute wait just to place an order, while some who were clearly \\"regulars\\" were getting their drink orders placed and filled within five minutes, tops.  Annoying x 2.\\n\\nI hate to admit it, but we ended up ditching the party when we went out for some fresh air.

Liquid diet or not, I get my work done and enjoy some really good coffee as well. As far as food goes, everything I've tried has been good, but expensive. Why it's good is why I took a star off--much of it is from Quacks (which I've also reviewed) and not their own oven. If they baked their own food it would have gotten 5 stars. \\n\\nAmbiance: perfect. Medium-dark woods, creaking floorboards, polished wooden counter. During the day it smells like roasting coffee beans, which they do in-house, and at night there's a nice, low murmur complete with flickering candles on each table. Sometimes they have live music going on. In winter they set up lights outside. \\nMaybe it's the combination of good coffee and amazing ambiance that attracts people here. Maybe it's just the coffee and the ambiance is just a good bonus.

I ordered the lamb chops here which were exceptionally priced. Three lamb chops for $12 is a price practically unheard of. I also ordered the pepper chicken, one of the most savory Indian appetizers I have ever had. I do not think I have ever seen an Indian restaurant carry this dish before, but it seems very similar to chili chicken which you can order as a main dish at many restaurants.

You can easily share one box with someone.  The fish was fresh and the spicy items actually had a click.\\n\\nMy only downside (as a few others have said) is to stay away from the noodles.

The sauce of cooked-down vegetables and spices goes down smooth and hot and is warming and filling and delicious on a cold, foggy Portland evening (though it seems like a lunch spot, they are also open for dinner).  The vegetarian version is also lovely.  I like adding spinach, which gives a bit of color and something cool and fresh-tasting to mix with the hot bowl of spices.  \\n\\nDue to the nature of the simple curries and rice they serve, your food is ready pretty much instantly, but the tables are off to the side and a wonderful, quiet place for an afternoon or evening conversation.

We were a party of 6 so between all of us, both of those got ordered. \\nBoth of those orders? Phenomenal. The chicken and waffles were perfectly cooked, the chicken was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside, but not overwhelmingly salty as most places tend to be. It was flavorful and melded perfectly with the lightly syruped waffle. The only thing I would say is that the second waffle (each piece of chicken came with two waffles sandwiching it) was unnecessary for me as I was already stuffed, but I can see folks enjoying eating it like a sandwich. The shrimp and grits were probably the best thing there. Someone in the group ordered a breakfast bowl which was quite plain and ordinary, and someone else ordered the peach french toast thingy.

However the Georgia Tech location continues to go downhill and is nowhere close to the quality of food and service you get at their other locations.  I visit often because I work on campus and would come more often but the food is so disappointing and expensive for what you get.  I ordered a pimento cheese sandwich that cost almost $10, it had a spread of cheese (think butter on bread) and half a tomato.  I've talked to many co-workers and their experience has been the same.

The Salty Pig is like many of my fantasy football teams in that it looks good on paper, but it does not deliver during the regular season.  I was a little disappointed to say the least.\\n\\nThe interior and atmosphere is nice.  It is rather unique.  Like modern restaurant meets slaughterhouse.  I sat at what looked like a bar and immediately asked if they had kielbasa.  They do not.  Looking at the menu, they do not have any pork or sausage of the international flavor, like brautwurst, kielbasa, or sweet italian sausage.  This is more of an American porkhouse.  More to my dismay, they did not serve a salad at lunch or linner, only dinner, for which I fell more than an hour short and was denied a simple salad.  I settled on the salami toscana only.\\n\\nIt came out on a slab of wood with pickles, mustard, and bread.  The salami did not come as advertised.  The menu said it would have a little bit of a garlic flavor, but I could not taste any garlic at all.  There was not much flavor at all.  Not only that, but the bread and pickles did not have much flavor either.  The only thing with flavor that was really good was the mustard.  The salami was extremely thinly sliced with about ten slices.   I would have preferred that it be more thickly sliced with some actual substance.  I would have not have minded the thin slices if the salami was a better quality.\\n\\nAs for the bread, it was very hard.  I know that the pickle is like a cucumber, but their pickles tasted more like bland cucumbers rather than sweet pickles.  Like a said earlier, the only thing that stood out was the side of mustard.  The total damage including tax and soda was 8 dollars.\\n\\nThe Salty Pig has a great concept, but it totally lacks execution.  If this place ever advertises Kielbasa, or even a good old fashioned american porkchop, then I will be back.  Take note Salty Pig.

Why waste time on BBQ when we have so many better dishes ?) Yes...we are food snobs in Louisiana, but as a good friend of mine says, we have every right to be.\\nHaving said that though, it doesn't mean we are afraid to try other dishes,especially when traveling. That is why we chose this place tonight. I have read about it, seen it on TV travel shows, and been told by some people that this was a really good place to eat. And so we set off in the dark Texas night on the Friday after Thanksgiving to drive many dark miles on a narrow country road to find this place. And yes...it IS in the middle of nowhere!\\nThe first thing you notice is that it is in the middle of nowhere, and the parking lot is HUGE and full of cars. The full parking lot lifts your hopes that everything you've heard about this place is true. So you park, hike the half mile or so from the furthest reaches of the back lot to check in and get your beeper. You are surrounded by huge groups of 10,15,20 or more people lugging all kinds of ice chests, because this place is BYOB. After about an hour's wait, your beeper goes off and you wait another 5-10 minutes for a hostess to escort you past a giant meat pit where everything is cooking, into a beer garden type setting where all these huge groups ( with their ice chests...) are now seated on huge picnic table type seating. And I can tell you it is VERY intimate seating.\\nThe waitress takes your drink and meal order in one fell swoop, and in about 10 minutes slaps the platters of food down. She advised us that there were 2 kinds of BBQ sauce on the table; one was supposedly \\"hot & spicy\\" and the other was \\"special\\". We never found the spicy one and I don't think we ever came across the special one either....one was honey mustard with a heavy vinegar flavor and the other was just a heavy vinegar flavor, but neither had much taste at all.\\nI ordered the Thurman Platter, which was $14. It contained some sausage,a sliver or two of brisket, and one semi-large pork rib. I took one bite of the sausage and ditched the rest of it....no flavor at all other than a less than decent smoke taste. The pork rib was the best of the three, but only in a relative sense..again it was bland. The brisket was tough and flavorless.\\nOn to the sides...the beans smelled awful, and that was enough to convince me to leave them on the plate untouched. The potato side was lumpy and cold...we could not tell if it was supposed to be potato salad of some kind, or some very poorly flavored mashed potatoes. Even a heavy dousing of salt and pepper did little to put some life into it. But I did eat it because I was really hungry and seemed to be running out of options at this point. The cole slaw was shredded cabbage...period. There was no dressing or flavor to it, and believe me, I stirred it several times hoping that there was some hiding in  there, but unfortunately not.\\nBelieve it or not, the BEST thing that was on the table were the pickles! OMG...those were SOOOOOO good, and we wolfed them down. But considering the drive, the money spent for the platters, and the long wait, I think I could have found a good deli somewhere in town to achieve the same pickle satisfaction derived from the little plate we got here.\\nThe waitress seemed a little shocked when she walked up to refill my tea and saw all of the food left on our plates, and looked downright offended when she offered us a box to take home the leftovers and we politely declined. It was just not worth the effort, and I really did not want the inevitable smell lingering in my truck.\\nIn summary, if you like BBQ, by all means go here, and I sincerely hope you have a different experience than we did.

Just when I thought I was ready to be seated, a \\"local buddy\\" of one of the proprietors waltzed in ready to sit down immediately...here I go I thought... here comes the BS...I shouldn't have been so hasty to criticize, as the head waitress shooed him off, came outside and seated me in a prime table. She couldn't have been nicer, as well as the co-waiter/water guy/busboy. He promptly filled my water, asked how I was, thanked me for coming in...I was very surprised by his friendliness. The waitress was incredibly nice as well. She took the time to highlight some dishes, and tell me about the restaraunt. However, I was ready to eat/drink. As many note, they have about 7 wines for $16, a bottle for each notable variety and region, and they have a few \\"reserve\\" bottles, about double the price, but still a phenomonal bargain. I selected a 2004 Barolo for $37, a deal I couldn't pass up. For a starter, I opted for the brocolli cooked in garlic oil. The brocolli was perfectly cooked, with just enough freshness left to give it good texture, and the garlic oil...the flavour brings you back to proper Italian cooking and flavours. Slightly bitter, slightly acidic, but 100% good. I had the lobster ravioli for for my main. 10 or 11 perfectly shaped raviolis, in a rich cream sauce with a sprinkling of sauteed tomatoes. The dish was superb. Perfectly cooked, perfectly seasoned. With that said, I would try a different dish next time, likely the zuppa de mare in the fra diovol sauce. After I finished, and she brought the bill, which was $63 total, I was encouraged to sit, relax, and enjoy my last glass of wine. I was glad too as I was completely full, and not sure I could move yet. This was about 9.15pm and there was one table still open, otherwise, I do not think they would have been so generous on the table. I thoroughly enjoyed my whole dining experience, and look forward to my return....don't forget to walk down the street to either Mike's or Moderns for a canoli!"},{"name":"Little Big Burger","address":"3810 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I would go a lot more if service wasnt so slow.

Yes, it is a small place with very few tables. Yes, the line is hella long. Yes, they keep the line moving in a gruff Italian/Bostonian manner that can come off as being rude (or efficient, depending on how you look at it). Yes, they only take cash. But honestly, I just don't think they have sacrificed \\"who they are\\" to meet any sort of hype. And that's what makes them great. \\n\\nHey, so if you are that excited about this place or are coming from out of town, minimize your angst by coming at a time that isn't right at peak hours, and you won't wait in line for that long. Don't drive here; take the T and have a nice stroll through the Freedom Trail and mosey on over for dinner in the North End. Bring cash. Take deep breaths. \\n\\nAll of my friends order the seafood here. I know it must be good. But Giacomo's has only ruined one dish for me for life, and that is butternut squash ravioli. As in, I now live in San Diego and will never order butternut squash ravioli off any other menu because I am 100% sure I will be disappointed that it doesn't beat Giacomo's. \\n\\nI can still remember the first time it changed my life several years ago. This year I thought there was NO WAY it could live up to the hype I myself had built up. I went back earlier this year (May 2014) and hesitantly ordered it. Each bite was like waking up repeatedly to realize my dreams were real. \\n\\nI love the small restaurant feel. My waitress was so much like a crazy efficient Italian mother. I can see how it could come off as being rude for some people, but I loved her. The next day I was eating at Panza across the street and saw her run into Panza and then run back out. After dinner I crossed the street and visited Giacomo's to say hello to her as she was closing out the cash register, and found out she is related to the owner of Panza (I forget if it was son or brother) and had gone over to get some change. I grinned and said I sort of liked Giacomo's better, but she just said hey, it's just different. They're two very different restaurants that serve a completely different style. \\n\\nIt rings true. I also loved the whole family feel that the North End gave off for me that night, as if the owners of all these restaurants that people are viciously comparing to each other are actually one big happy family who just want to feed us good Italian food. \\n\\nSo, come here to get hearty Italian food served in a small, intimate space that has been preserved despite their larger-than-life reputation.

Up until the forth quarter everything was fun and playful until my girlfriend decided to go to the bathroom and be told she was a little LOOSE \\"dont think can write the W word on here\\" and then sexually assaulted by a grown man. Instead of assessing the situation the whole entire staff had zero problem with what the guy did but had more of a problem with why my gf was yelling at a guy in the men's bathroom. We were told by 4 employees that they didn't see anything so it wasnt there responsibility. Wow . I have both managed bars in Philly and now in Austin. Last night was pathetic. I have seen men sexually harass women on countless occasions but never has our bars had the stance of I didn't see it .. So it didn't happen. I understand that there is no common sense In most people from Texas but in that situation you tell the guy who assaulted the girl to pay and leave. For example just last week a female was groped up by a male patron at my bar when the server told us this we asked the man if he had done this.... what was his first response to the question the same answer the guy gave last night. I didn't touch her. What did we do ? we looked at the damn came as because we're not a bunch of idiots. Of course after looking at the cameras are server was telling the Truth the guy was gone. Never ever would I go well he said he didn't do it and I didn't see it so it didn't happen.

My favourite is the Augustijn Blonde with a light fruit aroma and a hint of citrus and vanilla. \\n\\nWe usually skip the appetizers and go straight to their famous Belgium mussels. They have three choices: Coquotte, Vin blanc , or Congolaise. Our favourite is the Congolaise, which is mussels cooked with a tomato coconut cream, smoked chili & lime, and fresh cilantro. The portions were generous and the sauce is simply divine with a touch of spicy and tangy flavour. The mussels went perfectly with a side of pommes frites, although I did find the frites to be a bit too seasoned. For the entree, I had the Canard et chevre; roasted duck breast, goat cheese & tarragon gnocchi, sauteed scallions, in hazelnut gastrique. The duck was excellent, succulent and tender. The chewy gnocchi was a great compliment to the dish. The portions were just enough to make you feel full but not overbearing. Enough for us to skip the desserts this time around. \\n\\nThe service is usually good despite attracting a lot of the trendy and pretentious crowd. The ambiance is quite dark and intimate.

He surprises me with a little bit of shopping at Nordies in Pioneer Plaza ... or square... idk. Anywho! Our cashier makes some nice small talk and we decide to ask her what do the young cool hip oregoians do on Tuesday night's out here and she 1. lights up like a Christmas tree 2. recommends a few spots, one of which was Tube!! I told you random. \\n\\nAnyways- We get to Tube at 1 AM because we ended up somewhere else first  (Awe Lounge). We pay $5 cover. Now I realize this is Portland and not LA or NY or SF but get with the program folks. Portland is on the up and up and businesses have to stay in business. Paying a small cover isn't that bad. Plus,  It was LIT inside!! everyone dancing, drinking, vibing. We were a little sad we got there so late. They played all hip hop which we LOVED. The DJ was on it, all the new stuff and all the goodie trap rap I can ask for. We were worried because we couldn't find home boys sound cloud or something to sample his style but maybe that's part of being in Oregon vs Cali. Worthy side note, it was the most diverse crowd we had seen yet in Portland.  Lastly, it is small. Like it or hate it- that is a literal fact that neither the Tube nor it's patrons can change. That didn't stop babe and I from dancing. Oh and guess who was there?? Yup! Our cashier from earlier.

I used to eat a lot of Cuban in Los Angeles and there isn't very good Cuban in San Francisco so I was greatly looking forward to my meal. \\n\\nWhen I arrived, there were only a few empty seats available and those were by the door; it was cold and rainy and understandably, everyone in the restaurant wants to sit as far as away from the cold drafts which occur when someone new comes in or leaves. Upon my arrival, I took one of the remaining tables as far away from the door as possible. I ordered a glass of sangria while I perused the menu and a couple walked in, taking the table next to me, near the door.  The couple next to me ordered drinks but it became apparent that another table, away from the cold draft was opening up and they were able to move. \\n\\nDining alone, I am always anxious to try and order in such a way to get the most tastes for my dollar and I was asking the waitress about their Frituras; there were four flavors available and she indicated that *sometimes* they will give you half-and-half with two flavors, but not one of each to get all four flavors. Apparently I was asking too much for I also had several questions about Ajiaco and Ropa Vieja. I had a lot of questions about their menu and it was obvious the waitress did not have all the answers and was growing impatient with me, but in mid-sentence and just as I took a breath to place my order, she abruptly excused herself, walked to the other guests who had come in after me, and proceeded to take their order. There was a brief moment she could have salvaged her rudeness by coming back to me, but instead she proceeded to the kitchen to complete submitting the other guests' orders, leaving me sitting there with no order having been given at all.\\n\\nEven the other guests sitting on the other side of me couldn't believe I had been so abandoned with such atrocious lack of service. I would like to chalk it up to a bad night for the waitress and I have had many friends recommend the restaurant.

A side of bacon comes with this meal and it is billed as apple smoked (or something to that effect). It was super bland! Who ever heard of bland bacon? The saving grace were the home fries. They were very tasty little potato chip style fries with parmesan. That was good. I ordered an extra side of sausage which was also very tasty.

Basically, this entire summer, i commuted between hartford connecticut, and nyc, ny. So basically, i spent most of my entire summer eating pretty authentic italian food in the places that have some of the highest italian american densities in the US. \\n\\nOK, saying that, im still not a huge fan of Neapolitan style pizza. i prefer chicago style deep dish pizza more ( i know BASPHEMY!!). \\n\\nHOWEVER, i will say right now that antico's is among the best and most authentic Neapolitan style pizza i have had yet. I came in at about 2 on a saturday afternoon with 3 of my friends. we ordered 2 pies, the plain Martguerita, and the lasagna for a total of 40 dollars. so about 10 dollars for each of us. And let me tell you, there was def 10 dollars worth of food. We each had 4 slices of pizza, 2 from each pie, and we all agreed that it was really good pizza.\\n\\nYou can def taste the freshness of the ingredients. from the tomato sauce to the cheese to the meatballs on the lasagna pizza (which btw was flavorful, not dry, and not super salty like the meet used at other pizza places (i would love to eat spaghetti with these meatballs). the cheese def stood out. it was soft and flavorful. you could tell it wasn't the same as the regular super processed cheese from like pizza hut. \\n\\nLike previous reviewers said, you should eat the pies on location. If you have to take it home, the juices from the sauce were absolutely gushing. i can imagine that the crust would be soaked on a 10 minute drive back. However, since we ate on location, the crust stayed firm and didnt soak through. In fact, i liked how the crust was slightly crusty on the outside, but so soft and chewy inside. it was absolutely delicious.\\n\\nThe Margarita pizza is great for purists. You get just the crust, the sauce, the cheese, and a bit of basil. They also provide you fresh condiments like peppers in oil, and chopped garlic which is a lot nicer than the condiments you get at other pizza places. It was flavorful, soft, and fresh. my friends and i literally breathed up the pizza. it was that good.\\n\\nThe lasagna pizza was also great. it had meatballs on it that were absolutely to kill for. so tender, moist and flavorful. i liked what they added to it. i think ill get meatballs on all my pizzas instead of sausage from now on.\\n\\nNext time ill get the spicy pizza. that would be all sorts of awesome\\n\\nThe only negative i can think of is that 20 a pie is kinda expensive. so good food (really good), and slightly more expensive than its competition.... 4 stars. for 5 stars at a price point higher than its competition, it needs to consistently blow my mind. we'll see after a few more trips"},{"name":"Giacomo's Ristorante - Boston","address":"355 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"This place is amazing and has some great Italian, even for the North End.

It's valentines evening and my husband and I go out for a beautiful evening to complete our great day. We have 8:30 dinner reservations and are seated right away. Everything is working ok. Our waiter takes our order , we have some wine before dinner, we are served our prix fix appetizer course and then...... Forgotten!  People seated around us that came in right before us are eating dinner , then desserts and we have NOTHING!  The straw that broke the camels back for me was that people that had 9-9:15 reservations were eating their appetizers and still we had no entree. DONE came when one of those same couples were served their entree at 9:45 when they were seated after 9 pm. We still had no entree. Our waiter was beside himself with anger and embarrassment. We called DONE and asked for the check and wouldn't you know within 5 minutes out came the meal. TOO LATE!  I'm no longer hungry and am now ticked , which is not how I wanted to spend my Valentines evening dinner.  Look, I  understand backups in the kitchen, human error and all that stuff- but when you screw up someone's evening- you should make it right. Antica Posta did not make it right. This was a pre fixe meal at $75 per person. All my husband and I had was some wine and first course(salad & grilled Octopus)-that is  all we got the priveledge of eating , courtesy of their kitchen. After people seated 40 minutes after me were eating dinner and we quit - They \\"GRACIOUSLY \\" took $30 per person of the bill for the inconvenience of not eating and then we were charged the  wine we drank.  Wait what? All we had was an appetizer and a couple of glasses of wine- that appetizer became $45 per person basically . Yeah, I don't think so. We left after unsatisfactory service before eating our entree, never given dessert or the cheese course. We paid it because the waiter tried so hard and my husband did not want to make a scene on Valentine's , but he  shouldn't have paid that bill.\\n  No manager, owner, or anyone with authority in this place came to apologize - leaving the poor waiter to carry this burden all by himself.  He was awesome and we tipped him on the full value of what the meal should have been. Thank you Antica Posta for ruining my Valentines evening and then adding insult to injury by not making it right by at the very least comping the entire food portion of our meal.  Congratulations you won the battle but lost the war. I live down the street but will never be back. You should have made it right by us and you thought you were better than  that. Shame on you! There are many other great Italian restaurants that treat their patrons with respect and realize that when they are wrong, they need to make it right.

Although, it is funny to call it \\"local\\" since Five Guys has more than 600 locations throughout the United States and Canada.\\n\\nNevertheless, their simple, grease-soaked meals continue to win critical acclaim and ravenous fans. Just last August Five Guys won Orlando Magazine's number 1 spot for Best Burger in town (http://www.orlandomagazine.com/Orlando-Magazine/August-2010/Best-of-Orlando/).\\n\\nSo of course I had to do a write-up on this place. We stopped by the Dr. Phillips location last night with a hungry appetite and a little cash.\\n\\nIt doesn't take long to realize that Five Guys Burgers and Fries focuses almost exclusively on two things: burgers and fries. The restaurant and the menu are about as plain as white bread. See the photos I uploaded to Yelp (http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_ccKIXGf2U6l7mQGQC90DA?select=EWb6ryxGRYaWyHGFQ6qWVA)\\n\\nWe wanted to be sure we woke up the next morning, so we ordered one \\"little\\" Cheeseburger, one \\"little\\" Bacon Cheeseburger, and one \\"regular\\" order of fries. With a soda fountain drink the total came to about $14. We grabbed our receipt and headed to a table to wait.\\n\\nIn about five minutes our order was ready. Like Subway, all orders are packed up to go, except Five Guys uses brown paper bags. You can either run out the door with it or sit in the restaurant and enjoy.\\n\\nWe were ready to indulge. Time to unwrap our burgers and dig in! Check out my burger: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/_ccKIXGf2U6l7mQGQC90DA?select=xWMIqxuBogYZYr1G3iAkBQ\\n\\nNeedless to say, it was a helluva burger. The fries were excellent too. For taste, it's tough to go wrong with this combination.\\n\\nSPOILER ALERT! Stop reading now if you don't want to see the nutritional facts.\\n\\nObviously Five Guys knows what its doing when it comes to making a delicious meal. But this place is to healthy lifestyle advocates like the Hummer was to budget-conscious drivers.  That \\"little\\" bacon cheeseburger in the picture? 630 calories and 39 grams of fat. The regular fries? How does 620 calories and 30 grams of fat feel. For comparison, a 6 Oven Roasted Chicken sub from Subway has 320 calories and only 4.5 grams of fat. And you can add a bag of Baked Lays for another 130 calories and 2 grams of fat. That's over 1,200 calories for the burger and fries at Five Guys verses 450 calories for the sub and chips at Subway!\\n\\nSee the facts for yourself (PDF files): Five Guys http://www.fiveguys.net/files/files/NutritionalInfo_2009.pdf and Subway http://www.subway.com/applications/NutritionInfo/Files/NutritionValues.pdf\\n\\nPlease don't misunderstand me.

Our waitress told us that the cool thing about doing the buffet was that most of the dishes are stewed all day, so it's a great way to try lots of those dishes all at once.

The lamb stew and the roast chicken were great. the beef kabobs tasted unlike any beef I'd had, but were also delicious. The chicken kabobs were good, but lost some of their appeal next to the moister stew-like dishes. They had three different kinds of basmati rice: normal, lentil and sour cherry. All three were perfectly cooked. \\n\\nFor the vegetarians in the crowd, the eggplant stew was one of my favorites. Also, a dish with potatoes and cherry tomatoes was tasty.

I liked the cole slaw; the beans were okay, kinda bland. \\n\\nThere are lots of other BBQ places that would top my list (Rudy's, Franklins, Stubbs, even the place in Whole Foods) and don't involve a long drive!

This is a nice hotel.  Not a 5 star but a nice hotel.  The room and bathroom was very clean.  I am super picky about that and it passed.  The towels in the bathroom and poolside were very new looking and plush.  There were plenty of bathroom toiletries available.  The decor was not the most recent but certainly not super old and outdated.  The mattress and pillows were very comfortable.  The nearby freeway is only noisy is the wind is blowing your way.  Of the 5 night only one night it was heard.  However, I always bring ear plugs.  It's hotel people walk down hallways and make noise.  Earplugs go with me everywhere.  AC worked great.  Only thing I didn't like was there was no fan to pull the steam out of the bathroom (not uncommon w/older hotels) and if you were not using the bathroom light and mirror then putting on make up any where else was hard.  The light was very dim near closet and full length mirror.  I have bad eyes and need good light.\\n\\nThe lobby:  Very clean and had fresh water with fruit slices..yum.  Always handing out cold water bottle coming and going.  Fresh apples at lobby counter.  All a very nice touch.\\n\\nThe people:  They are SO NICE!

It was filled with old dead leaves, dirt, trash and piles of bird feathers.  We were there thru a few events (corporate and wedding).  It was never cleaned up and had trash, bottles, etc laying around.   The trees are home to a lot of birds.  This would explain the piles of bird feathers and bird poop.  You may feel compelled to park under the large trees for shade so your car is not so hot but be warned...the bird poop is awful.  They say everything is bigger in TX.  Well I know the bird poop sure is.  The car was bombed with it.  All over the hood and windshield it was pretty bad.   The planters around the front of the building were in need of some care.  It is possible that they were behind after all the rains they had.  I don't know but it was not pretty to look at.\\n\\nI really want to give it more than 3 stars because everyone is so nice.

The staff there were efficient, fast, and friendly, despite the place being packed.  So we were happy to hear that a location had opened near us on Ashford Dunwoody.  But now?  \\"Happiness gone.\\"  First strike, after being seated, we waited for 20 minutes before we even were noticed/seen by any waitperson.  In that time, two tables were seated after us, and they both ordered before we even got our \\"how do you do.\\"  We actually had to go back to the main station to ASK for a waiter, second strike.  So then, order placed finally, we wait, and another table had their order come and he was motioning to them that it was incorrect.  They took it back, and brought it back, only to STILL not be correct.  Hoo boy.  So now, we're getting ready for OUR dining experience to begin, after these mis-steps.  My coffee comes, and  it comes with no spoon, and no waiter for another 7-8 minutes.  Third strike  Then the food came.  It was passable at best, with each food having a varying temperature, and a muffin that was barely warmed, not toasted.  Fourth strike.  We now have our meal, but, ...no table service?  Fifth strike.  We then have to ASK for our silverware so we can eat.  Then, we reach for... an EMPTY salt shaker.  Six!  So by now, this is really starting to show some poor, poor management here.  NO attention to the basics, let alone DETAIL. After we finished, my girlfriend wanted to speak to the manager just to voice our concerns for this establishment, opened here in April.  We were told that the manager was busy and could only see the assistant manager.  He comes out, and as she starts to detail our concerns, but he interrupts her mid-sentence (???) to say that they were \\"not prepared\\" for this kind of crowd today. Interesting choice of words there...\\"not prepared.\\"  7th strike.  I would like to venture out now and say this is not a GOOD way to start ANY business.  We said that the waitstaff apparently needed better training or something, and he said he agreed, but that it \\"hasn't been working!\\"  O-M-G, 8, 9, and TEN?    He then urged us to join their Reward Club or something!  That's when my ears stopped working and we left.  My last word?  There's a place on Roswell Road called \\"Egg Harbor!\\"  They're great, and we'll never stray again.  They are always jammed, but handle it.

Bistro 153 is actually on the other side of this light industrial area, off of SW 154th Terrace. \\n\\nWhile I'm only able to give them three stars at this point in time, I'm glad that they are here. The Cafe that was here before was definitely only 1star. It only got business because it was the only walkable place to eat for the local Nike Employees. (Nike ended up putting their own small cafe in for this reason.)\\n\\nLet me state that the service was excellent here. My only real complaint, and not even that, is that the Happy Hour food was pretty mediocre. On the other hand, it was also a pretty dang good price. With drinks and four HH menu items, $25 for two is not a bad price.\\n\\nWe had the fried pickles, the hummus, the polish dog, and tater tots. \\n\\nI was rather disappointed in the fried pickles, they weren't bad. But they're pickle spears dipped in tempura that just left me craving more. I had visions of pickle chips dipped in a slightly spicy batter, like what I see in the South all the time (but can't seem to find in Portland.) But the Dill Dip they served with the pickles was excellent.\\n\\nEverything else was good, but mediocre. The Polish Sausage was the exact same sausage you can find anywhere, in fact it might have even been a Costco one. The tater tots.... were tater tots. They needed salt. The hummus plate was pita, hummus, cucumber, olives and tomatoes. Nothing fancy, but edible.\\n\\n\\nThat all being said, there are several items on the dinner menu that I have the expectation of jumping my review to four stars. But I think my biggest disappointment is that I feel this place is less Bistro and more local Tavern. As such it hits the mark, as a Bistro I feel it falls a bit short.\\n\\nOn the other hand, they have solid food and decent drinks. They're within walking distance of a large population of people who will be hungry at lunch, and they have the longest happy hour hours I've ever seen."},{"name":"Lime Leaf","address":"435 Columbian St","city":"Weymouth","stars":"4.5","text":"This is simply the best Thai food on the South Shore.

Lime Leaf clearly breaks that rule.  Everything on the menu is just as good as the next.  For a first time customer, get the sample appetizer platter, it will give you a taste for everything feeds 2 to 4, but half of it is fried. Good Tom Yom Soup in important to me in a Thai restaurant and it is excellent here.  The crispy rice cakes are something you do not see in many restaurants in this area, period.  There is a variety of different rice and noodle dishes that you can send a month trying to eat the menu.  For dessert, try the banana leaf with rice and beans for something different.

The reason for that is to fold one the portion is very small for a man of my girth and the other reason is that he was right!

The couple with us were more into the hot sauce but anyone that knows me, knows I can't handle anything too spicy.  I kept it to the one sauce but felt that it tasted almost different on each of the three meats we ordered -- which leads me to believe that it really pulls out the flavor of the meat, instead of consuming it.\\n\\nWhile we were there, we popped into the building next door for a wine tasting.

After several years coming here, I've never been disappointed by either the food or the live entertainment. \\n\\nFor starters (get the pun?), I highly recommend the Dalkey Duo -- beer-battered sausages with mustard. Very tasty. (The sausages are also good dipped in the Guinness reduction they bring out with the soda bread.)\\n\\nAs for entrees, everything I've had has been excellent. My personal favorites have been a lamb pie I got last time (it the pie of the day) and the ham and colcannon dish. For the record, ham and potatoes are not something I would ever normally order -- I'm not much of a fan of either one -- but it seemed like a very Irish thing to try, so I did, and I was blown away.\\n\\nThe shepherd's pie is also very good, but VERY Guinness-y. And the fish 'n' chips are excellent.\\n\\nWhen it comes to dessert, I think it must be a running joke among the staff that everybody orders the bread and butter pudding. I know we do every time we come here, and without fail, it seems, the waiter/waitress says something like \\"knew it\\" or \\"why did I even ask?\\" The bread pudding is amazing -- like, if you come here you HAVE to try it -- but I'm also a fan of some of the other desserts. The fruit and oat crumble -- whatever it's called -- is a personal favorite, although it might not appeal to everyone. In other words, though, you'd be best off getting two different desserts to try.\\n\\nJust a word of warning, the dancing is pretty loud, so just know going in that conversations might get cut short every now and then. Even if you could talk over the music, you won't want to, though. The dancers (all of whom, I believe, come from Riverdance) are incredible to watch, and the Irish bands they have play add a lot to the atmosphere, as well.\\n\\nAll in all, Raglan Road is one of the best eating experiences you can have at any of the Disney properties.

They must have changed the recipe because it was thick and chunking and was very tasty. We had the cheese sauce and yes it was runny, but it's melted cheese. Should it not be runny? I ordered a veggie burrito and my wife ordered enchiladas. She was impressed with the unique enchilada salsa and my burrito was ok. I would have preferred more veggies than rice. The flan was excellent. I always order a Chile Relleno when I try out a Mexican restaurant. This item is either great or awful and for me is a reflection to the chef. I must say that it passed our test. So, overall, we would return for the food. \\nNow for the service. \\nI mentioned it was a slow afternoon. We had 4 servers. I am not sure who was our actual server because 3 different people, and I think the manager, asked us how our food was multiple times. I think we stopped counting after 7 or 8 times. We were asked by all 4 people if we were done and wanted anything else even after we ordered dessert. If you are the manager reading this review, this is overkill. Stick with 1 server per table to serve and ask about the food. The others can certainly clear the tables as necessary but we were annoyed by all the interruptions. The manager should come out to check on the food one time. \\nWe will return because it is close and the food is good but we will insist on 1 server.

Last year I discovered the aches and pains I was getting were actually related to a really severe kind of arthritis so I received handicapped status.  I was really worried about visiting the parks this year because it's hard to get around, I'm much slower and once the pain comes it won't go.  Still I figured I should try after all I've seen so many disabled persons in Orlando over the past 20 years I figured they must have a decent system set up.  The first 6 days were fine, United Airlines accommodated me, and then disney's Carribean Beach did a great job (after an initial mixup)and WDW parks did a superb job, i showed my id and handicapped card and got a Disney one at the guest services spot in front of MK and that allows all disabled guests onto thefastpass lanes without any complications, you just go on and can move around easily even if you can't spend more than 3-4 hours on your feet you still feel ok about the money and experience.  Admittedly, I was feeling bold when I got to Universal & IOA, expecting the same sort of thing.  I knew the walk to the parks themselves would be challenging but figured if i go early in the am and take a little bit of rest I'd be fine \\n\\nI knew I would have an issue as soon as I got to the gates, I stopped in to their guest services where I was handed  a paper sign in sheet/ list with spots for signatures and times. ( I don't see any under google so ill try to dig mine out and post e photo) At this desk  it was explained that if a ride is 30 min I could go right onto fast pass but if its longer than 30 I would need to get it signed and go find somewhere else to be for 50-90 min or whatever the wait time is minus 15-which means basically just stand and wait like you are in line anyway or go try to find a seat in air conditioning and wait-which the employees in restaurants don't love because you are taking paying customers spots.  Also this system is not flexible like reg fast passes, you dont get a range to return, so you must come back within 5 min of the time listed for another teen who may or may not give another attitude will sign you into the ride.  once signed in you are freeing it up for next ride- you are not allowed to use the pass for anything else while you wait.  this was really crummy all by itself but but a few employees actually gave me an attitude about it as if I was getting some kind of free perk and milking the system and that's hard to tolerate.  What I wanted to do was tell them off about how much it rots to be disabled and that if this is such a perk for the other 364 days in a year how about we trade but I didn't, I just made a mental note about how unfun the experience was for me.  as much as I like the rides I feel it is plainly not welcoming to disabled individuals so I will not be going back unless something drastically changes,  There are too many other parks that warmly accommodate disabled people to put up with the system or the attitudes.  Sure the rides may not be as fresh and new but if you can't stand long enough to get onto them ( I missed ET, Disaster, Twister and all the shows because i couldn't stand any longer) what good does it do me.  The answer is none at all, I left feeling awful about my being disabled and for wasting so much money.

We expected to be thrilled and transported but while there were moments of brilliance, it wasn't anywhere close to the amazing experience we hoped for. \\n\\nTwo main comments covering food and service. \\n\\nFirst: Some courses (the fish courses) were exceptional and fully lived up to expectations. But after the fish courses, the dinner lost its pizzaz and courses were ok but nothing fantastic.  I didn't finish several courses; a statement which speaks for itself and something I've never done with another tasting menu.

Too much salt in some courses (apple/celery sorbet was inedible and almost spit out by our friend) and no great finesse in any. (We had dinner at Per Se and were  blown away by the sheer brilliance of the salting.) \\n\\nSecond, the experience had none of the polish I expected. Our waiter was terrific and delivered the service one would expect but he was the sole exception.  The rest of the staff and service was rushed and rather perfunctory. Each course was delivered by a different  (rather disinterested) server who so rushed the descriptions that we often didn't catch what they were saying. Also, the tables were so crammed that every time a server walked behind me (constantly), they bumped my chair. We ordered a wine and it arrived after we finished a course (so we were left w/o wine for one course.)

This was our first, and last, time to visit this restaurant. Not quite sure I can get over the dirty wine glasses, the chipped plates or the fact that a glass of wine costs more than my entre. But hold off on that because the real star of the show is the service. I suppose that ordering something to go could really cause mass confusion, not sure how but apparently it does. Or that the server finally just tells everyone at the table to just be quick and order already. But the clincher came when we discovered that that nice Spanish rioja was actually an Italian blend. When asked, our server just said, 'oh know it wasn't what you ordered but I got you a good deal on this one instead'.

But I feel the need to tell the truth about places and let the people know really what goes on behind closed doors....\\n\\nOmni Austin @ Southpark, one of the older Omni hotels which was bought out from the Wyndem years ago has yet to go through a full rennovation since those times. Over time, some managers have gone in and made impactable changes, but unfortunately for the hotel they are no longer there. The conference halls are okay... make sure you review the property before you decide to book... \\n\\nThe restaurant, which is in DIRE need of a revamp from it's 70's brass and run down buffet, only offers staff that have been there for years and although some of them are great to work with, some of them act as though it is a denny's and are more concerned with getting you in and out than explaining the menu to you. The Pm crew changes constantly, if you are ordering off the menu, please ask for details.\\nThe best thing I could say about the restaurant was that the pasta bar buffet for lunches was a really great discounted deal. I would highy recommend it, but with the addition of a new chef, that buffet might be gone now. \\n\\nSweetwater's - the old bar that used to sell the finest cigars is now more of a hole in the wall hang out and doesnt get as much attention as it needs... I pushed and pushed for a pool table while I was there, and I think they recently added it. The Lobby bar is very unique, sunk into the ground and allows patrons to have a quick cocktail when they arrive before heading to their rooms... The bartenders at both of these bars are superb. Very talkative and do their best to accomodate for your needs. I would recommend asking for Sandra or Chris while you are there. Anyone can visit the bars and restaurants in hotels, regardless if you are a guest or not, go check it out, but the prices are a bit steeper in hotels.\\n\\nThe rooms.... where to begin, the rooms ALL need to be revamped. I stayed in this hotel twice, and both times, I got slightly sick from the mold in the walls... Austin is notorious for mold, but they dont do anything to try and fix it or even hide it. If you were to pull down some wallpaper you might even visably see it.... I dont recommend doing this, they may charge you a repair charge. While checking in to your room, check everything... the showers, the faucets, the tvs, everything.... if anything seems out of place, not working, uncomfortable, ASK TO SWITCH ROOMS.... Although the engineering department does its best to accomodate for all repairs, they are so backed up with this old hotel that sometimes it takes a while. If the hotel has the room, they will just move you.\\n\\nI would book through the hotel rather than on one of the discounted websites... the rates are usually the same, sometimes even cheaper just through the hotel. I would personally stay at the Omni Downtown and head to southpark just to check out the bars......"},{"name":"Pambiche","address":"2811 NE Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"As if I didn't love Pambiche enough for its regular and reverse Happy Hour, gorgeous pastries, and decor that looks like a pack of starburst exploded...

It's got a ton of rides and shows, all divided into different sections/neighborhoods.\\n\\nThe Good Rides:\\n\\nThe Simpsons Ride - This replaces Back to the Future, a ride I loved.  This is in the same vein, with a surround-screen type of thing for immersion purposes along with lots of shaking, diving, etc. of the ride vehicle.\\n\\nRevenge of the Mummy - It's an indoor coaster of sorts -  a wild ride with plenty of ascents, descents, twists and turns, all in darkness.\\n\\nRip Ride Rockit Coaster - I didn't go, but my father & sister did.  It was very quick and quite intense.  Neither are wusses, but both put it in the \\"Don't regret it, but wouldn't necessarily do it again\\" category.\\n\\nJaws - This is a combo show/ride.  It's thriller-fun the first time, kitschy-fun on your second go.  Helps to love the movie, of course.\\n\\nMen in Black: Alien Attack - My boyfriend lost his hat on this ride, but didn't notice until afterwards (He was too busy hanging on, spinning, and shooting aliens.).\\n\\nThe O.K. Rides:\\n\\nJimmy Neutron's Nicktoon Blast - It's cute for kids, with some shaking and a cute storyline.  Not as immersive as the best rides.\\n\\nE.T. Adventure - see Jimmy Neutron.  Not crazy awesome, but cute.  Worth a short wait if you have time to kill.\\n\\nThere're no bad rides - just rides you MUST see and ones it won't kill you to miss, but are fun if you have time.\\n\\nThe Good Shows/Exhibits:\\n\\nShrek 4D - It's not insanely fantastic 3-D, but it's quite cute and funny.  The seats rumble and spit water, bringing you further into the show.  Worth a 40 minute wait.\\n\\nDisaster! - This show/\\"experience\\" is awesome!  It's derived from the old Earthquake! ride, I think.  It's currently being \\"refurbished\\" (or was a couple months ago); I don't want to reveal the best part in the hopes they don't discard it; you'll probably know what I mean if you see it.\\n\\nHorror Movie Make-Up Show: Granted, it's more a comedy show that's peripherally about horror movie make-up than a serious examination of craft, but fun nonetheless.  Do it!\\n\\nThe O.K. Shows/Exhibits:\\n\\nLucy: A Tribute - If you love Lucy (ha!) this exhibit about her and her shows is worth ten minutes.  If not, stroll on by.\\n\\nTerminator 2: 3-D - This isn't that thrilling, but that's mostly because it's dated.  It's a combo live-action show and 3-D movie - the audience views it while standing.\\n\\nThe live shows (Beetlejuice, the Blues Brothers) are cute, but don't miss out on other stuff just to see them.  Unless you're missing Twister!, which I feel is a lot of hype for nothing.\\n\\nOne more thing: pay attention to the stores in the neighborhoods - you may see a locale referring to a favorite movie (Genco Olive Oil Co., anyone?) or win a midway game in Amity."},{"name":"Ocean Wave By Harry And Sons","address":"820 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Harry & Sons has been in the neighborhood since I moved here in 2004.

They were amazing. That said...I was not impressed with what I ordered for my meal. I ordered a burger cooked medium rare -and maybe it sat and over cooked because we had to wait so long for our meal to come out- but it came out black and dry. Not only that but it was way too small for the bun it was on. The bourbon chili I ordered with it was a tasty option. We all found the place to be really hot inside. They had no ac on and no air circulation and periodically we would all feel a blast of heat as if the heat was being turned on once every 5 minutes. We were trying to locate the source of the heat but the best we could come up with was that maybe it was coming from the kitchen when they opened the door to go in and out. We all left there a hot, sweaty mess by the time we finished our meal. I won't be in a rush to go back to this place but the next time I get a craving for tater tots I will.

The pad see ew, which I usually order with chicken, is delicious. And while I don't normally order pad thai, the huge crush of takeout orders at dinnertime is bound to go awry on occasion. Their mistake was my gain; their pad thai is one of the best I've had. (Or maybe I was just particularly hungry that night; after all, I was too lazy to head back and correct my order.)\\n\\nBut some of their other dishes are a bit weaker. Their curried fried rices are good, but not great. The flavor gets a bit flat and boring after two or three bites; you're probably eating what was an afterthought to the rest of the menu. And the yum nua? Tough pieces of overcooked steak on a few sheets of wilted iceberg lettuce. Not great. Its saving grace was the flavor, which I got a lot of, probably because it took so long to chew the pieces of meat.\\n\\nDon't even think about touching the Chinese menu.

The common denominator are the Szechwan peppercorns in every dish which transmits a distinct type of spicy feel to the palate.  As well, the salt content is high...not for people watching their sodium intake. \\nService was efficient if brusque, fairly typical of Richmond restaurants.  The place was packed with people lining up to get in, so the workers were pressed for time.  \\nI would say it's worth a try for the experience, but would be hard to eat here on a regular basis."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"After a couple of dalliances with their airport outpost, I finally paid the Salt Lick's main location the honor of a proper visit.  Located about 30 minutes or so from downtown Austin, the out of the way location doesn't seem to scare away visitors as we had to bear a 45 minute wait @ 2:45PM on a Saturday and they have no shortage of tables.\\n\\nI can't say much about the menu as I stopped reading after spotting the $18.95 all you can eat 'family-style' deal.  You've got to gorge or go home.  Here's my take...\\n\\nBrisket - As the staple of Texas BBQ, I was expecting to be blown away with Salt Lick's brisket but found it just good.  It was a little tough.  The cuts with a lot of rub were flavorful - would love to just have an order of burnt ends - but I found the center cuts just okay on flavor.  The BBQ sauce helps - both the standard and the habanero sauces.\\n\\nPork Ribs -  The meat was tender for pork ribs.  Ironically, Salt Lick's rub on the ribs is more sweet (brown sugar?) than salty.  The ribs are a bit inconsistent - one round can be meaty and tender and the next \\ntough and spare on the meat.  I recommend going sans sauce.\\n\\nBeef Sausage - Delicious.  A little goes a long way here.  Great with a sampler but probably wouldn't get this as the sole meat.\\n\\nPotato Salad - Mustard-based sauce.  Loved it.\\n\\nCole Slaw - Vinaigrette-based.  Very good.\\n\\nBeans - Nice smoky flavor.  Liked them a lot.\\n\\nBlackberry & Peach Cobblers - The blackberry was good, the peach was great.  Awesome dessert.   \\n\\nAll in all, I really enjoyed my gorge-fest and it was a great value given all I ate (let's just say it was my only meal of the day).  But I wasn't quite blown away as much as I thought.  Maybe I'm just in the beginning stages of refining my Texas BBQ palette...guess I'll find out after trying a few more places in the area."},{"name":"Giacomo's Ristorante - Boston","address":"355 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Giacomo's is probably the most affordable and valued Italian restaurant in Boston.

The staff was really nice.  The food was good.  But, there are a lot of kinks to work out in this newly opened location.

A substitution was overcharged and a glass of \\"rose\\" delivered as a red was not credited to our bill.  Both of the glasses were very dirty - the third one was clean enough that I went with it.  After expressing a few frustrations to a manager, no gesture was made to make it enticing to return.

It costs extra to get things on the side but when calling for delivery it's never mentioned. As of tonight 3/4/16 I ordered a steak tip dinner with double onion rings and a large Cesar salad. So, The steak dinner I ordered seemed to be appealing until I realized they put the marinated tips on top of the onion rings leaving them to be complete mush and obviously inedible completely, so I call and tell them my issue and ask the lady on the phone (who is extremely unpleasant I may add) that doesn't she think someone should have informed me about how they put the steak tips on top of onion rings? And she said 'it costs extra and also that she apparently 'just told me that' okay.. Well this was after I received my order so don't you think it's a little late for that? The passive aggressiveness wasn't really needed. So she tells me all we can do is send over new onion rings and I was completely fine with that because it was resolving the issue. They do not give me a time or ask for my number or anything. I get a call maybe 40 minutes later saying the manager is outside and had been knocking for apparently ten minutes, strange because I heard nothing and ironically enough the delivery boy from earlier went to the wrong house. So I open the door to a man (apparently the manager) and he greets me with 'I've been knocking and ringing your doorbell for 15 minutes' then pretty much throws a side of onion rings into my hands and walks away saying 'yea thanks whatever you're welcome' as he's walking out my door. So what id like to know is why did they send a manager if he was going to be so rude and not even talk to me or apologize about this issue?? He literally gave me not one second to try and talk or say anything and rudely came and rudely left. Safe to say I'm all set with this place that doesn't even take your phone number and clearly wants me to wait around for them all night to get the onion rings they messed up. Ridiculous. They also put dressing on the salads which is disgusting. They ask you nothing specific, they don't care to take your number and apparently you have to wait around for them to come when every other normal place I've ordered from calls you when they're here especially if you live on a dead end street like mine. They don't care to tell you that you need to ask for things to be put on the side in order for the food not to be ruined, soggy and inedible. I'll be adding pictures of the wet soggy onion rings."},{"name":"Barcelona Inman Park","address":"240 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"This is a pretty good place to go to for some tapas if that's your thing.

We had the caprese salad and calamari to start (delicious!) and I had the sausage and mushroom risotto. Now let me tell you, this was some of the best risotto I have ever had. My boyfriend got the seafood risotto, which was good but a bit too spicy for me but he loved it. We definitely debated doing the full Italian dinner with the pasta course and the meat course, but we were just too full to even finish the risottos.

There wasn't much talking once the enormous platter of linguine with lobster, clams, mussels, calamari, shrimp, and scallops was placed down, and we went to work.\\n\\nPROS\\n- The fried calamari was delicious: not too fried, seasoned well, and fresh (as far as you can tell from fried stuff)\\n- In truth, the red Giacomo sauce really made the entire dish extraordinary: I'm not sure what they put in it, but I would buy bottles of it to transform my home cooking. Creamy, tomato-based, plenty of seasoning, great consistency. At the end of our dish, we asked for more bread just to mop up the remaining sauce\\n- Zuppa di Pesce was as desired: lots of fresh seafood on top of linguine. The lobster is already split for you, so you just need to crack open the claws. Yum! The variety of seafood was quite astounding and a phenomenal deal.\\n- The bread was simple but high-quality, allowing it to serve as a base on which you could add whatever you wanted (mostly sauce for us haha)\\n- The staff was courteous, efficient, and professional. This is clearly a place where they try to get you in and out as quickly as possible while allowing you to enjoy your restaurant experience.\\n\\nCONS\\n- I'm not a huge fan of long lines, and it was snowing the day we went. Bleh for the 35 minute wait. The line moves fast though, so if you have only one person waiting, make sure the rest of the party is close by. Larger groups will wait much longer than a 2-person group.\\n- Along those lines, no reservations. :(\\n- Other reviewers describe the Zuppa di Pesce as more than enough for 3-4 people. While it is a lot of food, my boyfriend and I had enough room afterwards to saunter down the street to Mike's Pastry for some dessert. I suspect they might have cut down on the amount of linguine given since our pasta portion was relatively small. I got 3-4 fork-spinfuls of linguine, and I think my boyfriend got 5-6 spinfuls, which is decent but not enough to feed a small nation the way others have described it.\\n- Cash only. There's a Bank of America down the street, but it's still a pain.\\n\\nAll in all, would definitely recommend, but given the hassle, it might be awhile before I return."},{"name":"J.

Likewise, their cocktails are always artfully crafted for a one of a kind experience.\\n- The staff is always extremely knowledgeable about the dishes, very friendly, and great at making sure their tables are taken care of from constantly refilling the water to checking in to make sure dishes are received on time.\\n\\nCons:\\n- This place is super popular, so they get packed really quickly. Their place always seems too small for their crowd.\\n- Their outside seating is minimal, which I put as a con because seating inside is usually way too cramped for my liking - pro tip: try and get outside seating for a more pleasant experience.\\n- The noise levels inside are overwhelming, especially when you're trying to enjoy a nice dinner date. This is due to the large bar inside which kind of cramps all the seating and the waiters running around.\\n\\nDespite these nominal cons, Barcelona will forever remain one of my top restaurants in Atlanta.

The samosas were excellent as was the mint chutney sauce, I was not huge on the tamarind chutney which was sweet but lacked the savory.

The sauce was too thin and not anywhere close to hot like I ordered it.  It was a pretty mediocre dish.  The chana masala my girlfriend ordered was really good.  The spices were just right and unlike other restaurants in town serving the same dish, the salt content was under control.  They gave us each a very large serving of jasmine rice, however, it took a minute to realize they left out the vegan naan.  When they did bring this out I was not very impressed.  They have definitely improved the naan from the first time I came but this time it was a bit too doughy.  All in all the food was pretty decent, however, my real reason for the 3 star review is the rather hefty price hike since my last time coming.

In going to the guest services booth to report this, it seemed like we were not the only ones with this complaint as we overheard another woman who got her glasses broken in a physical altercation.\\n \\nSecondly, at the gate prior to purchasing tickets, we asked the cashier what the admission rate included.  When we arrived at 10:30 PM and were informed that this event was filled with professional actors and about 7 special events.  We were also told that closing time wasn't until 2 am, we would have plenty of time to view all of the attractions.   Not only did we spend almost $150 to attend the event for a couple hours but were completely disappointed with the unruly crowd, length of time spent on a ridiculously long line, and the fact that we were only able to see one attraction. \\n \\nIt seems that this is just another legal scam.  It's another corporation taking advantage in overselling events where they can't handle such large crowds of people.  \\n\\nMy group and others I've spoken to are extremely disappointed in Universal Studios and will make a point to never return to the Orlando location, nor recommend it to anyone.

The sides were mediocre, and for the price you pay, I want more of them.  If you are considering visiting, I do recommend the turkey.  It was actually the best thing I had, and I would probably only get that again.  Oh and the pickles were good.

I have no problem leaving my meal in the hands of a James Beard award-winning chef, but others might. My friend and I, who are always looking for fine-dining at affordable prices, stumbled across the Chef's Whim, and knew we had to try it. We had both been to Craigie before and been disappointed, but saw this as an opportunity to set things right.\\n\\nWe actually opted for the $55 six-course meal, but could have easily done with the cheaper version. Everything was the same between the two tasting menus (as we saw firsthand with the table ordering next to us), except for two supplemental courses, a cheesy pumpkin soup with grilled cheese and pork belly (rich and decadent, and maybe worth the extra cost alone), and a scoop of blackberry sorbet (lame, and a waste of a \\"course\\").\\n\\nThe dishes that overlapped in both menus ranged from good to excellent. My favorite was probably the cod cheek tempura, served with pickled peppers, preserved lemon, and a decent smattering of squid ink. There was a lot of salt in this dish, but it was not overpowering in the slightest. Seared swordfish with clams, whelks, and \\"early fall succotash\\" (which my friend aptly described as the vegetable portion of a tv dinner) came next. It was light and refreshing, and the sea critters were cooked perfectly.\\n\\nOur main entree, if you will, was a chicken thigh confit that was rather hard to dissect, both physically and flavor-wise.

Interesting. Definitely a place for book lovers/readers. \\n\\nOur waitress was very polite. Loved my puppy and even brought out water for him. My friend and I ordered two sandwiches. They were okay. Nothing spectacular but it was good enough for a nice lunch on a Saturday afternoon on Newbury....until the random, short rainstorm ended our lunch short.

As many have written, Teranga is cozy and warm with exposed brick and subtle African artwork on the walls.  Our waiter greeted us and brought out this amazing savory dipping oil and bread.

It was very good but I would have preferred to have it served with fresh hot peppers as Ive had it before.  I ordered the Chicken Yassa, which is roasted chicken breast smothered in peppery caramilized onion reduction.

It happened to be the Sam Adams/Stella table, and we were pretty happy with that (hey, it could have been Miller Lite).  The server checked our IDs and turned the taps on, and minus some initial problems with the Stella line, the whole system worked really smoothly--the carbonation was good, and the beers were cold and tasted fresh.  I was so fascinated by the whole shebang that I served beers all night, which my friends seemed to appreciate.  I do what I can.  I'm a giver, ya know?\\n\\nWe ordered a sampler platter with shrimp quesadillas, queso dip with tortilla chips, and barbeque short ribs.  The short ribs were meaty and falling-off-the-bone tender, but they could have used a bit more flavor.  The shrimp quesadillas were outstanding--filled with HUGE shrimp that were perfectly cooked, with just enough cheese and a crunchy tortilla.  The salsa was very good as well, so it made for a tasty treat.  The four of us each got tastes of everything on the $19, so I feel like it was a fair amount of food for the price.\\n\\nFor entrees, three of us ordered burgers, and they were decent.  Mine was cooked medium rare as requested, and it came with jack cheese, sour cream, poblano peppers, and red bell peppers.  It was juicy, but it wasn't anything special, especially for $13.\\n\\nService was really quite good, and the atmosphere was swanky and hip (TONS of high-end televisions, low lights, a digital sports ticker-tape going around the bar).  There's a rooftop deck, and the restaurant has a short list of cigars for sale.  The wine list looked pretty respectable and reasonably priced, but seriously, at a sports bar?  Probably not gonna happen, at least not at my table.\\n\\nSo, the verdict?  STATS is a nifty concept, and would probably be a TON of fun for a large group that wanted to snack on apps, drink loads of beer, watch the game, and not have to wait for a busy server for a refill (again, wouldn't have been a problem for us, since it was a slow night and our server was excellent).

The bread, while tasty, was unnaturally hard (for the type of bread it was) and the small dipping oil dish provided enough for about a piece or two, not the 5-6 you were given. The waiter was new and not confident, but tried his best to do his part. He didn't have the kitchen on his side - two entrees, Atlantic Char and Rainbow Trout with sides of snow peas and rice. The rice wasn't cooked, the snow peas were cold, and the trout was spiced beyond recognition (not mentioned in the menu), the char cold - did I mentioned the 40 minute wait? Management responded kindly removing the items from our bill and cooking fresh plates. This is where most places get it right - they did not.

In particular, risottos of various interesting types are excellent.   You do pay for what you get - entrees are pushing $20, add a salad (the inclusive salad seems to be a dead deal these days) and it's not cheap eats, but it's very good."},{"name":"Xiang Yuan Qiao","address":"112 - 3030 Lincoln Ave","city":"Coquitlam","stars":"4","text":"Saw the renovation when driving by tried it for the first time today. Not bad for the price and if you like noodles, its quite good. Soup base very nice."},{"name":"Royal Hookah & Cigar Lounge","address":"6203 W Sand Lake Rd, Ste D1","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"This place was absolutely horrible. My husband and I were visiting Orlando and decided to go to this hookah lounge. If you smoke hookah regularly this is not the place for you. We ordered the royal hookah for $35 and it was not smoking at all. We told the staff about 10 times and they kept adding and taking away coals and that did not change anything about how the hookah was smoking.  We then ordered a regular hookah which wasn't that great either. I would not recommend this place to anyone. They also charged an 18% gratuity fee.... We weren't a large party, only two people."},{"name":"Double Comfort Restaurant","address":"505 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"Great home cooked taste. Mac n cheese so yummy. The three pigs gravy is amazing.

The chips and queso are decent (we're in a chips and queso wonderland, so it's hard to gauge the actual quality; order it and you probably won't be disappointed), but the chicken quesadilla... I bit into it and thought, this tastes like American cheese... like a grilled cheese in a Tex-Mex style. I have no idea what the reality of the cheese situation is, but it was kind of gross. I ate all the wedges because I was ravenous, but probably wouldn't get them again. Tasted like something a well-intentioned mother would make. \\n\\nThe menu is pretty small - nothing wrong with that at all - with tacos, chips and dips, Brussels sprouts. It's all simple and palatable. \\n\\nWhy I docked not one, but two stars... the signs on the trailer. \\"If you're smoking we won't serve you\\" (I know secondhandedly this is true); \\"If you're not going to tip, let us know.\\" This is attitude. It is unnecessary. I get that certain standards of behavior are expected from patrons, but ya'll are placed on the patio of a bar that allows smoking. Is it a health consideration? I doubt it. And to up front tell people that if they don't tip, there will be consequences?
