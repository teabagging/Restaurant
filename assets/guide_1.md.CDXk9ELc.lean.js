I've always had attentive and superb service (especially with big parties) and their food is decent for an Italian restaurant food chain. I'm sure I'm not the only one who comes here for the unlimited breadsticks, salads, and soup. I love to get the zuppa toscana soup (includes potatoes, kale, and italian sausages). I have chosen the minestrone soup before, but it's more bland. The salad is good, but I suggest asking for light dressing because they tend to drench the salad in so much dressing that the salad is soggy and very salty. The entrees are good, but I usually end up taking half of it home because I'm stuffed from the unlimited breadsticks and soup or salad. This weekend I had the chicken piccata which comes with fried zucchini. The chicken piccata was good (have definitely had better), but for what it is worth at Olive Garden, I expected what I got. I ordered a side of angel hair pasta as well and actually received more than I did last time. The fried zucchini has a parmesan crust. I wouldn't get this dish again because the fried zucchini wasn't crispy. It tasted soggy due to the oil and resembled a soggy eggplant texture. Next, I am not a fan of lasagna and anything with too much sauce on it, but if you like either of those then get the Tour of Italy!

The pulled pork was flavorful but contained too much fat. The chopped brisket was at least 80%  fat. I deconstructed that sandwich, in an attempt to remove the chunks of pale, jelly-like fat. What I was left with was the top of the bun, with BBQ sauce on it. Not what I had in mind for dinner.\\n\\nSides: We chose coleslaw,  mac-n-cheese and shared a basket of tots.

My wife swears by the veggie burger and I LOVE the blackened steak salad and the salmon fettuccine. The appetizers are excellent as well. As far as I'm concerned, here's where the wheels begin to fall of the cart: \\n\\n1. The tap beer selection. Maybe it's just how sick of the New England Microverse I am, but it seems as if the majority of their beer selection consists of over-hopped, quaintly-named rust water.  As a lager man, I'm bummed, though I know it's par for the course in Cambridge.  One can only drink Sam Adams and Miller Lite so many times.  Can I get a Spaten?  A Pilsner Urquell?  A Leinie's?

Look, I know it's a good thing that business is good, but it makes trying to get two seats at the bar into an ordeal.  The worst part is that it seems to attract a good amount of grad student/NPR types who camp at the bar drinking what seems like about one glass of wine per hour.  This is not the bar's fault--I know--but it does make our visits kind of annoying.  Once school's back in session, forget about it.  My wife and I have had to give up the last few times.\\n\\n3.

Enhance the wake-up experience with a fresh mango juice mimosa made with the crisp, bubbly Cristalino Brut Cava - guarantee that those sleepy eyes will start to twinkle. \\n\\nThere are some astonishing choices that will tantalize and tease anyone's senses. The layered tastes of the Southwest Omelette that's served with pan de queso is totally scrumptious.  This dish is light as air but what savory flavors. Gracing this omellete is a freshly made sweet corn Pico de Gallo. It represents the beauty of harmonizing flavors together.  This culinary celebration intensifies with each bite - absolutely delicious.  The dish that will cause a pause after the first bite is the Huevos Benedictos - the jaw will drop in amazement as the flavors from the smoky applewood bacon intertwine with the sassy green chili hollandaise that graces the perfectly poached egg.  The secret behind this dish is the roasted poblano peppers; it imparts a rich smokiness and spice to the sauce. This heavenly creation sits atop a freshly made seared mesa cake that's made from corn meal sourced from Nora Mills Granary in North Georgia. \\n \\nThe ADios Caf√©'s version of a Bloody Mary gets its touch of pizzazz from jalape√±o, cilantro, and the splash of Cholula hot sauce that's added to this exhilarating drink; it is so good you might as well plan on relaxing a bit longer, as you will want a second.  Matching well with this classy brunch standard is the house signature dish, the otherworldly ADios- two eggs with a salsa verde resting on a pan fried cake that's a blend of russet potato, spicy house-made chorizo, jalape√±o, and sweet onions that's surrounded by earthy black beans, and garnished with avocado slices - these bold zesty flavors are what true Mexican cuisine is all about.  If a Bloody Mary isn't your thing try the freshly made passion fruit nectar but with a splash of the ultra-premium Jose Cuervo Platino Tequila - life can't get any better.\\n\\nSince the hazy daze of yesterday should be long gone by now, why not begin to really enjoy the beauty of the day.  A good cup of coffee would be in order to re-group a bit.  At ADios Caf√© the coffee is sourced from a fifth generation family organic coffee grower in the small mountain town of Jalisco.  The rich tasting Caf√© de Olla is perfectly brewed and giving it a distinctive flair is a pinch of cinnamon and chocolate.  It is the perfect complement to the decadent house made truffles. These tasty morsels of ecstasy are simply sinful - it's so nice to indulge every once in awhile.  \\n\\nWhether it's brunch or simply needing a place to chill - ADios Caf√© provides the perfect setting to relax, enjoy friendship, and watch the clouds drift by, and if you close yours eyes you just might think you are somewhere South of the Border.  I'll have that other Bloody Mary now..."},{"name":"Fat Matt's Rib Shack","address":"1811 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Hands down to ME the BEST ever BBQ!

The saag paneer is equally unappetizing with some very un-cheese like bland chunks in it, I could respect a tofu attempt if that were it, but they are definitely not tofu.

My niece visited today and was treated horribly!! Here is her review!! Last time I was in there, the place looked like it needed to be cleaned up a bit! (About a month ago) \\n\\nFirst off, I would like to say that I have been a big fan of the World Famous Dark Horse in Boulder for about 15 years. Growing up, my dad used to take me all the time to play arcade games, I had my first legal drink there and I've stopped by almost every time I've gone to Boulder. Needless to say, I will never be back after the way my friend and I were treated today. \\n\\nMy friend and I had just gone hiking up the flatirons with my dog and I wanted to show my friend this restaurant where I have had so many fond memories. I wasn't sure whether or not the Dark Horse allowed dogs on the patio, so I asked. When we pulled into the parking lot, there was a man smoking and on his phone. I asked him if he worked there and he said \\"yes,\\" and that it was okay to bring the dog on the patio. I went through the restaurant and went to the patio to open the back gate. I failed to notice the \\"emergency exit\\" sign but the gate opened so I brought my dog in and tied him to a table. My friend sat at the table while I went inside to ask whether we were going to be helped by a server or if it was self-service hours. I brought up the dog situation to a waitress with long, brown hair. She said that dogs are not actually allowed on the patio but \\"if you say it's a service dog, it'll be fine, we're not busy.\\" I told her that he is not a service dog and we can go somewhere else to eat if we need to. She proceeded to say, \\"we're not busy so it should be fine.\\" I ordered and paid for our food and returned to a guy in a blue button up shirt telling my friend that dogs are not allowed on the patio. I said okay, and put my dog in the car and left the A/C running. What happens next blew my mind. \\n\\nAfter I had already put my dog in the car, another man, named \\"Tanner\\" who claims to be the manager, came out and accused me of lying. He asked if we had asked anybody about the restaurant allowing dogs on the patio, and I said yes, that there was somebody sitting outside when we pulled up that said that it was okay. He rolled his eyes and said that nobody that works there would say that. A guy sitting near us told us that he thought the manager was being rude and that I should ask for my money back. As a wife of a restaurant general manager, I didn't want to cause any problems. I was even hesitant to write this review because I know what a pain in the ass they are for managers to deal with. I probably wouldn't be writing this if they story ended there. \\n\\nAs we were leaving, we cleaned up our food and were returning our cups to the bar. I asked a blonde bartender what the name of the manager was and she said \\"Tanner.\\" When we turned our backs, she said \\"Was that them?\\" in reference to us and we heard Tanner respond, \\"Yeah.\\" Then, in front of the entire bar, they yelled in unison, \\"Thank you liars! Byyyeeeee!\\" I have never been so embarrassed or appalled by this type of treatment. Even if I was in the wrong with bringing my dog onto the patio, I put him in my car when I was asked and that should have been the end of it. I know this review probably won't do much but I couldn't stay quiet after such poor treatment. It saddens me to see such a fun establishment in the hands of such disrespectful, unprofessional people. The Dark House front of house is an embarrassment to the owner."},{"name":"Nelore Churrascaria","address":"115 E Lyman Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"3.5","text":"I went here with a group of coworkers last night at the recommendation of a Brazilian friend. The food was very good and what you would expect from a typical non-touristy churrascaria. I would say it is definitely on par with Fogo de Chao and eons better than Texas de Brazil, plus you can avoid the hassle of navigating I-drive which is worth a star in itself. Like most of the other reviewers, my favorite meat was the top sirloin. I also greatly enjoyed the picanha, beef ribs, and chicken apricot sausages. I probably had at least 6 of those chicken sausages because they were so delicious.\\n\\nWe didn't try the leg of lamb or parmesan pork because it didn't seem worth the stomach space when there were so many other meat offerings. I did not care for the flank steak or the filet wrapped in bacon. The filet was actually quite disappointing because the meat was very tough, not even close to what a filet should be. The garlic beef was also too tough to eat so I only had one bite of that. We were not offered the pork ribs or the rib-eye, perhaps they were out of those. \\n\\nOverall we were having a great experience until it came time for the check. There were 6 people in our party and we had a Groupon for $80 off of 4 dinners. 2 were paying separately and the remaining 4 of us intended to split up our check but our server informed us that only one method of payment would be accepted since we were using a Groupon. I found this slightly annoying but offered to foot the entire bill, knowing that my colleagues would reimburse me for their meals. \\n\\nThe check before tax, discounts and gratuity should've been around $188 for 4 dinners, 2 glasses of wine, a cocktail and a soda. Our bill actually ended up being $180, including the $80 discount, due to a cleverly disguised service charge (gratuity) of $60. I knew gratuity would be included with a party that large, but 18% of $190 is not even close to $60. When I mentioned this to the server he explained that the $60 service charge was gratuity for the entire table, including the 2 who were paying separately. Conveniently, there was no service charge on the other bill so our server may have gotten a much larger tip than he was entitled to if we hadn't noticed this.\\n\\nI am giving 2 stars solely for the shadiness of the bill situation. Food deserves 4 stars but hopefully this review grabs someone's attention so they can amend their current method of calculating service charges (aka gratuity) for larger parties that wish to split up the check."},{"name":"Tacodeli","address":"4200 N Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"A Saturday afternoon at Tacodeli was jam-packed.

Since they have been here forever, seems like at least 20 yrs, and most people haven't been out of their county let alone the state, the reviews are skewed by their not knowing anything else to compare against. Sure you can get bagels at Shaws, Dunks and there's a couple of delis scattered about but this isn't Boca/Delray with a bagel shop on every corner. \\n\\nThat being said the bagels here are a meal by themselves no matter what you shmear or put on them. Jumbo sized because there is a lot of air in there they do have a good flavor. Very good bagel but not exceptional, not even close to the best but A-OK! As a few people have mentioned they are so big that when you cut them to toast you might have to shave them a bit to get them to fit. Hint to you autotoasters; You dont need to toast fresh from the oven bagels and dry them out from the get go. The moisture from fresh dough can be a real pleasure, just sayin.\\nWas told they no longer carry whitefish spread as not enough people buy it. Say what? Next no lox? No worries get your whitefish on with a container from Maxies around the corner. Their review coming soon.\\n\\nCant speak for the service with this bakers dozen as we got someone to go for us but it seems like the complaints are the same as they have been over the years. Young, seemingly inexperienced not so friendly counter help. In limited defense when assessing service put yourself in the servers shoes. It's busy as hell on weekend mornings with lines out the door and impatient, often rude, grumpy pre coffee, pre breakfast and maybe even hung over folks packed together in a parody of a war time bread line. This isn't an easy audience! The number of criticisms do seem to indicate that the owner should preach more smiling even if it be forced under pressure.

I tired a little of each sauce, and I have to say the Espresso BBQ sauce was heavenly combination of coffee and a smoky flavor.  I thought it was a strong flavor so I only used it sparingly.  My husbands pulled pork was also really good, and the coleslaw gave it a cool creamy crunch that went well with the pulled pork.

Came with complementary Egg Flower/Drop Soup and steamed rice. \\n\\nThe Egg Flower/Drop Soup had egg (of course), chicken, potato, and water chestnut. The soup is light and tasty. \\n\\nThe Walnut Shrimp was served over a bed of steamed broccoli and topped with crushed walnut. I like how you can taste the walnut in the sauce without eating the walnut. Good portion of good-sized shrimp. The sauce was lighter (not as thick) compared to other Walnut Shrimp elsewhere, but there's enough that clings around the shrimp. I kind of like that better than having a big glob of goo in my mouth. The shrimp was crispy and sweet. Overall, this dish was a bit too sweet for me, otherwise, enjoyable. \\n\\nThe Salt and Pepper Fish was monstrous! Ginormous pieces of catfish (I believe) battered, deep-fried, and toss in salt, pepper, and sauteed onion and green onion. It was good eaten either with rice or dipped in their ketchup + hot mustard sauce. I would prefer the batter to be lighter because the coat was very thick. That's just my preference. Others might enjoy a thicker, crunchier coat. The thick coat didn't affect the flavor. Both my friend and I really enjoyed this dish. The fish was \\"noticeably\\" fishy to me (not in a bad way); it's hard to explain. My friend didn't find anything wrong with the fish at all.

It had too much cream for my liking but you can just wipe it off.\\n-breads: there are at least 15 varieties to satisfy your sweet tooth, ranging from cookies to croissants, donuts and traditional mexican breads. If you don't have a sweet tooth, try their hand held meat pies. The chicken potato was tasty and the spicy beef wasn't spicy at all.. the flaky, buttery crust is delicious though. At $2 a piece, I had 2 for lunch. The breads on the other hand didn't have labeled pricing.

But the food is so worth it, and very reasonably priced (8.75 for a two meat plate? No one in town serves BBQ that cheap!). Espresso BBQ sauce! It tastes of coffee, dark chocolate, and sweet sweet grease.\\n\\nAlso, that tiny slice of char (the fatty \\"bark\\" or skin of the smoked brisket) they give me when I get to the window? AMAZING.

My girlfriend likes this restaurant because of the variety of food they offer. \\n\\nAs for the food I ordered the BBQ pork bacon cheeseburger. Talk about heart attack waiting to happen. It is a bacon cheeseburger with pulled pork on top of it. My gf ordered the Greek salad with chicken. The pork on the burger was dry but nothing a little BBQ sauce couldn't fix. They offer a toppings bar which has changed over the years. They do not offer any cheese sauce anymore and have replaced it with a garlic ranch, which is tasteful. The bar also offers lettuce, tomatoes, pickles and little onion crisps ( which are very salty). My gf really liked her salad as evidenced by her eating it all. \\n\\nAs far as atmosphere, it was what was to be expected at a theme park restaurant. They use to have cosmic ray playing the piano in the main dining room. For some reason he is gone so the nostalgia of the music playing in the background is gone.

We ordered two sides and two orders of ramen. The ramen came out immediately when we sat down and was barely lukewarm.  We waited patiently for our other sides to be delivered. I watched many bowls of ramen come out of the kitchen and be delivered before our sides came out. When a side did come out, it was only one of two. The second took a lot longer to come out. By the time it did, I had already packed up our ramen to go.  The second side we got was the sweet and sour yodas, which are a favorite of mine.  It seemed like we got everything at the bottom of the batch as there were no full Brussel sprouts in the dish and what leaves were there were absolutely swimming in sauce.  Also, they were cold.

Like meet, but meat because it is a BBQ place, did you pick up on that? Am I going crazy? Answer me!) \\n\\nPlease imagine a drumroll... best brisket I have ever tasted in my life. YES, IT LIVES UP TO THE HYPE!\\n\\nIf I enjoy eating the fat on a piece of meat that means that the meat is delightful, or that the apocalypse has begun. The rub on it was great and I found myself eating it without the BBQ sauces. Succulent, tender, and delicious is how I would describe it succinctly. \\n\\nDelicious ribs, wonderful rub. Fabulous pulled pork with such tasty bark. I am not a huge sausage guy... but this was great, my favorite sausage ever potentially.\\n\\nSo the meats were divine, the best group of meats I have had anywhere in my life (I know I have more places to go). Order them ahead so you don't have to wait in line, it is about minimum 6lbs of meat you must buy which is ~$100.\\n\\nOur bill, however, was ~170 with tax. Why? Because we made the one cardinal sin of this place. Don't order sides. Potato salad should be called pickle salad. Heavy pickle flavor. The coleslaw was not as bad but wasn't my favorite nor even the middle of the road of sides I have had. \\n\\nDesserts. Key lime was great, banana cream was okay, and the lemon tart thing was okay. Not a must get but, if you are in the area and never will be again I recommend trying at least a few different desserts. \\n\\nTHE VERDICT:\\nBest BBQ meat I have ever had which is why it has the 5-star rating. I just kept eating and eating even though I wasn't hungry because the flavor was amazing. Chew and spit just like gum... gross, I am sorry, TMI? Skip the sides, try the desserts, but don't plan to be blown away by either and potentially be disappointed.

We had a large party of 12 and they were very pleasant and accommodating. We had reservations, and sat on the patio. This is a cute house converted restaurant serving southern food.\\n\\nFood: There is an option for family style, which includes an entree for everyone and shared sides and appetizers but it's like $42 per person and I was under the impression that everyone at the table had to get that option. Instead, we opted for a la carte and everyone ordered what ever they wanted.\\n\\nLoved the cheese plate. There was a brie, blue and some sort of parmesan like cheese. It came with some bread, jelly spread, and candied nuts. The cornbread biscuits were a pretty good addition- literally a mix of cornbread and a biscuit. \\n\\nEntrees were smaller than expected. My husband and I split the shrimp over rice and the sweet potato pancake. Both were pretty good. The shrimp was kind of cajuny, but not too spicy. It came in a small skillet with about 5 shrimps, and the cream sauce on top was amazing. The pancake had a salad on it lol (some greens and EVOO)- and it was just 1 pancake. And you can't really taste any sweet potato. The consistency was a little softer than a normal pancake- my husband wasn't a fan but I liked it. The mac n cheese was SO tasty! It was white cheddar ditalini macacroni (small tube pasta) which is unusual but we both loved it. I thought about ordering the kale salad, but for $10 we passed on that one. Some of our friends ordered the mushroom casserole and the fried chicken and said both were delicious. I didn't order dessert but had a bite of the lemon pie that some else ordered at our table and it was yummy- very light and fluffy. \\n\\nService: It was kind of slow... but we did have a large party and our sever did the best she could.\\n\\nParking: Complimentary Valet or street parking.

He was extremely polite and didn't have a problem letting us take our time to order since we were new to the cuisine. We felt bad for him to keep coming over to see if we are ready, but it also shows that they care and were very accommodating about it. After a good 15 minutes or so, we were finally ready. \\n\\nWe ordered a coconut soup, garlic naan (based on the reviews here), mango lassi, the Chicken Tikka Masala and Seekh Kabab. I would have to say that everything was delicious. The coconut soup was light and we were able to taste the coconut shaves on the bottom. The garlic naan was flavorful and we kept on dipping it in the chicken tikka masala which blends well with it. We actually dipped it in our soup as well to see how it taste and it was actually quite good as well. The dishes came with rice (delicious too I might add) and it was big enough for both of us to share. The Seekh Kabab I would have to say was a little dry so we ended up dipping it in the masala sauce to give it some flavor, but the dish was not bad.  \\n\\nOur experience here was a positive one and we will not hesitate in coming back and eating here again.

It also saddened me that they weren't serving radish cake, which is my go to dim sum dish.\\n\\nEspecially compared to Houston, the overall bill was a tad expensive, which is driven by the fact that the clipboard they mark off doesn't show any prices, so you have no idea how much your meal costs until the very end.

Let me first start by saying that location, ambiance, service and overall vibe of the place is great.\\n\\nBut in terms of the food...absolutely dreadful! I'm still a bit in shock at how bad the food was here. I'll set the scene. I was part of a party of 5. 2 ordered the same type of pizza (some veggie kind) and split a side order of fries. Both loved their pizza and one gave me a slice. I thought it was okay, nothing spectacular (I'm used to eating pizza in the North End where I live so it's hard to experience better pizza elsewhere in the city). \\n\\n1 ordered the burger, medium and when she received it, it was well done and she said it was tough and dry. I didn't taste the burger but looking it, it was definitely cooked well over medium. She begrudgingly complained to our server and they offered to make her a new one but she didn't want another one so they took it off the check. \\n\\n1 ordered the clam chowder and she said it was bland. She offered me a spoonful and when I tasted it, I confirmed what she said that it was probably the worst chowder I've ever tasted...zero clam flavor, runny, basically just tasted like I was slurping warm skim milk. \\n\\nFinally, I ordered the foie gras appetizer for my meal. It was a generous block served with toasted baguettes and roasted pears. The toast was cold, so weren't the pears and most egregious of all, so was the foie gras, like it had just been taken out of the far recesses of the fridge. I've never in my experience of ordering foie gras at a restaurant ever had it served that cold. I'm no expert on French cuisine but I'm pretty sure when one orders foie gras, for maximum flavor, it should be served at either room temperature or just ever so slightly chilled or the way that I've always had it served: sauteed in a pan to caramelize the outside before serving. Speaking of flavor, to add insult to injury, the foie gras itself was the blandest tasting mousse I've ever tasted. It tasted like eating spackle. I had no more than 3 bites and that was it. Worst $15 I've ever spent. \\n\\nEveryone's drinks were fine. The other 4 got wine and I got a draft beer.

Get the rice and beans rather than the jambalaya (neither are that distinctive, but black beans really hit the spot sometimes).\\n\\n4) Steak or half-n-half w/chicken fajitas: VERY spicy, meat generally overcooked, sauted onions, no peppers (why not?); only okay tacos, but the cheese, pico de gallo and sour cream are included. Add guac for more flavor, it's more about the quantity than the quality here: NOT subtle. The hot cast iron pan they serve the meat on is a nice touch.\\n\\n5) Quesadillas, with whatever meat: not for the faint of heart. More like a mexican pizza, TONS of food, but the tortillas end up soggy and there's not the usual cheese overload you expect.\\n\\n6) Popcorn shrimp: delicious, plentiful, yummy battered bites with a little mustardy dipping sauce.

Pretty low on the ranking of Cubans I've tried \\n-Queso- good with nice kick; chunky salsa-y cheddar cheesey version versus the usual smooth and white queso. Chips seemed like they were from a bag \\n\\nHonestly, the salads at Panera have fresher ingredients, taste better and may even be cheaper than the salads here. \\n\\nThis place reminds me of Relax Grill at Lake Eola.

So I just called the owner at Edgewood Pizza his name is Bob to ask why was I charged a mandatory tip on a to-go order? He said it was a service charge, and that all to go orders have a automatic gratuity placed on them. I said okay well my bill it says it's a tip, so why is that?  A gratuity and a tip or two different things;I said a tip allows me to put my own value in the box and gratuity you charged me automatically. He said no it's a service charge  to any order placed after 10 pm. If you call us on the phone to place an order you have an automatic service charge too. I said okay well normally a service charge is a flat-fee. I said this was a percentage of my bill how is that how is that right? 18% to be exact.  He's like well all the neighborhood bars do it so I don't understand what's the problem? I said the problem is I feel like you're stealing money from me. I'm okay if you charge $2 or something per to go order because it's paying for your supplies but to charge me a percentage of my bill is not right!  Then he goes on to say that it is common sense and that I should be ok with it paying a service charge and a tip is the same thing. I'm like no common sense says a tip is a tip and gratuity is gratuity. Then he proceeded to tell me that it's posted somewhere in the restaurant on a chalkboard sign (that nobody can see that is facing the wall. ) The waitress last night told me that it wasn't on the chalkboard and now it's on the chalkboard.ÔøΩ?It's not on the menu it's nowhere to be posted. I said well you can at least let patrons know that they have to pay a gratuity charge after 10 p.m. or if they order something over the phone. No I don't have to let them know that.

Tokyo is very modern-looking, although it was on the dark side. The tables weren't too badly lit, but I would have liked it brightened up some. I got an impatient vibe from our server; at the same time, she was on the slow side too, which made me feel like we were an inconvenience. I felt rushed to order a drink right after sitting because she was taking other drink orders, and she only came by once to take new orders.\\n\\nPrices were as expected for hibachi. If you think you're going to eat and drink for under $30/person, you're sorely mistaken. They don't give free soda refills, which I find surprising when they have such an extensive drink menu, but at least it's written in plain sight.\\n\\nThe food was great, and I left feeling satisfied. The fried rice was lacking in flavor, but the steak & shrimp I ordered & the salmon my fiancee ordered were both wonderful, cooked exactly to order. Eat as the food is delivered to your plate or it'll get cold and you'll be eating long after the others at your table are done and gone.\\n\\nThere are two things that make a hibachi experience good or bad: the chef and the people you are sitting with. Unfortunately, we were seated with people who weren't terribly engaged with the chef. Yes, it was difficult to understand him, but not so impossible you couldn't interact with him. The chef is also a performer, and you could tell he was awkward without any diner participation. My only complaint about the chef? He didn't describe which dipping sauce was for meat & which was for veggies/fish. Not that it REALLY matters because I just dip everything into the wasabi sauce, but it would have been nice since I never remember. \\n\\nI will definitely be coming back, probably with a larger crowd to avoid what happened this time.

No one really speaks English here, they only speak Cantonese so ordering is basically pointing at what you want.\\n\\nThings that I usually order:\\n\\nChicken feet: usually pretty solid dish, make sure you get a steaming hot one. Because this dish sometimes sits on the cart a while.  Ask for one that is below the top basket and don't take no for an answer if the cart lady refuses.  She will try to tell you that the top dish is still hot because there is steam coming from it.  The steam is actually coming from the baskets below and the top basket is usually no good.\\n\\nTripe:  Nice and sweet tasting broth with it. Again insist on the 2nd to top basket to get maximum heat. Like the Chicken Feet, it doesn't taste as good when cold.\\n\\nPork shiu mai:  Standard go to if you have non Asian's in your party that want their cookie cutter Dim Sum experience. I usually get at least 2-3 orders! They are really good.\\n\\nShrimp hargow - looks like steam shrimp dumpling that is always quite tasty, but usually needs a little soy sauce.\\n\\nBBQ pork bun steamed, or the slightly sweeten baked bbq pork bun:  This is actually one of their best, with a fluffy steamed skin and sweet pork filling.\\n\\nShrimp in envelope:  Similar in taste to the shrimp hargow except in Asian shrimp burrito form.  Comes with a sauce that makes it much better.\\n\\nIn summer they have a watermelon desert with small tapioca balls  in coconut milk --refreshing, sweet, and light, a really good end to the meal. Beware in the winter they have a Honey Dew version that is still served out of a shelled out watermelon.  Really makes you think where they got that watermelon shell from and how many... cycles it's been used for.

Also, it's pulled better here than most places, with better chunks, and variation of pork, between the bark and inside, all served together. Yeah, it's great.\\n\\nThe brisket of course is one of their staples, and as I am to getting brisket outside of Texas (if it's in Dixie, it better be pork, and it better be good), Fox Bros' brisket rivals any other I've had.

It makes it pretty easy to order if you're looking for soup noodles!  \\n\\nI like the fact that they do not use msg and that their beef is grass-fed and hormone free.  They also include a large beef bone in the soup filled with marrow. If you've never had marrow before, don't be grossed out. It has the consistency between a custard and hello and tastes like, well, \\"beefy\\". Apparently I'm told that it's healthy too (but don't take my word on that).  The noodles were prepared just right - a bit chewy and al debate. The soup is what usually separates the good and not so good. In the case of this place, IMHO they have one of the best.  Some places all you taste is the large amount of fish sauce (i.e. very salty) and thin fake tasting soup base. Here, the depth of the soup base flavors are apparent and well-balanced. \\n\\nI tried their iced coffee and it was also great. They served it up the traditional way with the mini coffee drop over a cup.  Be aware that it takes 10+minutes for the coffee to drip out but the wait is worth it. Don't forget to stir the coffee before pouring it into the cup of ice to mix the condensed milk with the brew. \\n\\nPrice wise, it's a bit more expensive than other places but well worth the extra $3-4 for the pho. \\n\\nWill be back to try their banh mi and appys!"},{"name":"Se7en Bites","address":"617 N Primrose Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Never had a bad experience at this place...great twist on a southern breakfast.

They usually offer two soups of the day and an assortment of salads.  I like to choose their Pick 2 where you can choose half sandwich, soup or salad.  I recommend staying away from their Caesar salad as the dressing is watery and bland.  It's missing the garlic and anchovy sting.  Their New England Clam Chowder is some of the best I've tried.

Since they don't take reservations, we knew we would be waiting at their bar area with a cocktail for a few. Perfectly fine and okay with doing so. What I wasn't fine with was the bartender, Austin, who upon our arrival immediately gave us dirty looks, forgot our appetizer order (we reminded him, and he forgot it again, then told us he wouldn't charge us for it and said it would arrive to our table. Suprise, it never did), rolled his eyes at us repeatedly, ignored us (he was just standing there, not cleaning up anything, not looking at anyone, just standing while we were trying to flag him down) and he was just really a d*ck. Seriously. Funny thing was, he wasn't this way to anyone else. Maybe we looked like someone he thought he knew and really hated?? I dunno.\\n\\nPROS: Our server at our table though was awesome. Go figure that I can't recall his name out as he truly deserves a positive shoutout! He was a pleasure to talk to, was helpful and knowledgable and really went above and beyond to make sure we were serviced. \\n\\nOMG. Let's talk about the truffle fries for a moment.

It would be a shame if they didn't do burgers right, but they do. :)\\n\\nINDIFFERENT: Since Cowfish is the only sushi place in CityWalk I would go there if you are craving some, but it was overpriced for sushi.

I have passed it many many a times and given it a pass till I read about the fabulous dumplings they serve here. I was very pleasantly surprised to find their retro interior complete with pop Taiwanese(?) music they play non-stop in the background. I could go on raving about their unique architectural design, but enough about interiors. Let me cut to the chase instead and rave about their mouth watering dumplings in hot sauce. It was very unique and extremely flavorful, as was the Taiwanese pork soup, pan seared dumplings and cold noodle salad and I must not forget to mention their chicken in lettuce wrap. In my opinion it was one of the best sample of it's kind. The lettuce leaves were very fresh and crisp and their chicken was perfectly savory. If I had to nitpick about anything, I would say that I want my lettuce wraps to be a tad more spicy which could be had if one added dollops of hot sauce ( it has a fantastic  saucy, pickle-esque quality to it) that they would provide upon request. The portions are generous and the price is a bargain. Our server was very friendly and seemed knowledgeable about the food and the establishment. Overall my experience at Cafe 101 was fantastic and I cannot wait to get back there and show off my new fangled knowledge and enthusiasm for Taiwanese food to out of towner friends and family.

I don't know what happened between August-December, but the pizza is no longer as good as it used to be. When I first started ordering from here, the pizza was always fresh, with a great crispy crust and heaping portions of cheese. Now, the crust feels and tastes like thick cardboard, while the cheese always looks old and stale (like maybe it's been sitting under a lamp for way too long.)\\n\\nAnother disappointment is the sandwiches. The first time I ordered a sandwich, I used their \\"Build Your Own Sandwich\\" feature and got a great sandwich that was exactly what I asked for. I thought, \\"Okay, the pizza might suck here now, but at least the sandwiches are pretty good. I'll just order sandwiches from now on\\". The next two times I ordered sandwiches, it's like they completely ignored what I inputted and just put whatever they felt like putting on it. Despite the fact that I never clicked on the button for tomatoes, they still put an insane amount of tomatoes on my sandwich, which sucks for me because I hate tomatoes. I also never clicked on lettuce or onions, but they still put those on as well. The result was a soggy mess of a sandwich filled with crap I never asked for.

The nachos AND fries were both AMAZING. 10/10. The tuna was really fresh on the nachos (I don't even like tuna (normally), and I LOVED this tuna), and they came with a delicious crab rangoon sauce on top. The fries were crispy and loaded with bacon and creamy truffle and parmesan cheeses.\\n\\nAt first I was scared to try to anything off the combined sushi/burger menu, but the waiter convinced us it was worth trying something. Although the \\"All American Bacon Double Cheeseburgooshi\\" was the most popular item ordered, we took his suggestion and personal favorite, and tried \\"Doug's Filet Roll\\". It was THE BEST sushi I've ever had. The roll contained avocado, kani, and creek cheese inside, topped with filet mignon, spicy mayo, masago, and scallions. The roll flavor was SO unique; each ingredient complimented the other so well. Again, a 10/10.\\n\\nIn addition to the roll, we ordered the \\"Boursin Bacon Burger\\", which was tasty, but after eating the roll I didn't think anything else compared. They also have a wide variety of shakes- my girls really enjoyed the rice krispy one (very rich and very big, so considering splitting one).

Friend's always talk about it. Top 10 lists seem to always include it. How could one NOT sacrifice part of their trip for some of the most raved about barbecue in the city, if not state? To be honest, they cannot. \\n\\nFranklin has plenty of critics that would agree and a few that wouldn't while, from this perspective, you are going to love every-single-morsel that goes into your mouth. The pork, the brisket, the sausage, all delicious till gone. \\"That good,\\" you ask. Perhaps. You'll say ANYTHING is great after waiting 3+ hours in line....\\n\\nStill here? \\n\\nOK, look, Franklin is delicious, average priced and offers just enough options to make it worth a visit. Be prepared for the \\"wait\\" that you've heard (and read) about because it's true. My brother and I knew this would be the case, ate before we got in line (noon'ish) and sat down to enjoy (what was still available) a little after 3PM. It was a Saturday so Tuesday - Friday may be your best strategy (or PRE-ORDER to skip the line). Note: they do make beverages available for purchase while you wait as well as let you know wait times (\\"Last Man Standing\\" sign indicates that cutoff for at least something), what is still available, etc. \\nHospitality is a +1 in my review. From the courtesy of letting customers know about wait, if there is any of said item left as well as simply being cordial adds-up to customer service to me. Keep that in mind as my 4 Star Review is now food alone.\\n\\nFood options appear to almost be an Austin standard when it comes to barbecue locations: pork, beef, sides. Franklin exceptions, from what I ordered (see pics), were none. The brisket was good. The pulled pork was good. The sausage was good. The potato salad was good. The pinto beans were good. The slaw was good. Everything good. Just GOOD. I was fortunate to be one of the random customers to receive a bit of their burnt ends once up to the ordering counter (not on the menu, only available at random). Those were very good (not an exception, mind you).\\nThe one thing that stood out for me, exception here, were the sauces. Notables were their \\"Espresso\\" and \\"Texas Style,\\" both unique in their respective consistencies and flavor. When paired with choice protein (or side), that 'good' item went to very good. Hey, an enhancement is never a bad thing!!! Furthermore, you can purchase the sauces to take home or purchase online, FYI.    \\n\\nNOT available for me to try by the time I was able to order were the ribs and pies. It is very possible these are THE exceptions that make Franklin that much better than elsewhere. I'm not sure but first-to-go items can always signify either small batch or popularity (maybe both). Some other time.     \\n\\nDo I recommend? But of course. Maybe not solely for the food but for the experience. The anticipation that builds alone is worth it. Besides, you'll be asked by others that HAVE painfully waited in line if you've had Franklin and possibly heckled if you say 'no.' Kidding but the point is more so about the hype the restaurant has and less about the food. \\n\\nSince coming back from Austin, friends have almost all asked but two things: how was the trip and did you make it to Franklin's. Funny, our discussions are more about the experience (line, customers you deal with in said line, etc.) then the food. Again, Franklin is for the experience."},{"name":"Isla","address":"208 W 4th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Finally some creative and legitimate Latin American  cuisine in this city.

Apparently, it was converted from an old house to give some southern charm.  You can literally hear and feel the floor creaking and shaking when people are walking around.  It was very distracting.  The entrance to the upstairs portion of the restaurant is almost literally in the kitchen.  There was way too much traffic and confusion between the customers and the staff.  Sitting near that area was not a fun experience.  Also, the tables are very close to each other so there is not much privacy.  \\n\\nFOOD:  Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing. I tried the Chicken and Dumplings (buttermilk-brined and pan-seared boneless chicken thighs, farmer's cheese dumplings, wilted Swiss chard, andouille gravy).  The first few bites were good but after a few minutes, it just became too much.  There was sooooo much gravy that it felt more like a soup!  After few bites, my arteries just gave up.  I also tried the chicken noodle soup which was decent.    \\n\\nSERVICE:  Great staff.  No complaints.\\n\\nOverall, I didn't enjoy the food too much.

We had heard our friends raving about it, and after a glance at the menu (I was sold at chili dog, let's be honest here, though a drink named the \\"Punch Out!\\" wasn't hurting any) we were off.  \\n\\nFirst good thing, plenty of places to park.  It's on 4th, lots of metered parking.  This is good, even though I am not the one in our typical party with a car.  Admittedly, our two trips have been midday on a weekday and post midnight, so no guarantees on that being standard issue.\\n\\nService is fast and friendly once you sit, though.  Playful servers are a joy, especially when one of the food options is \\"Your Weiner\\".  One unfortunate thing at the moment is that they do not yet have ice cream, though they will be having Jeni's ice cream for float and dessert purposes, which sounds like a wonderful idea.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is delightfully \\"indie art\\" -- the whole place seems almost like a tribute to the 80s, be it music or baseball.  The art all seems done by one fellow (or a number of fellows with the same, identical style, which is admittedly unlikely), and is a strange sort of delightfully bad.  Not terrible, but everything seems slightly sophomoric in a so-bad-it's-good way.\\n\\nThe menu is surprisingly varied for being, essentially, just a hot dog place.  If you're familiar with Betty's kettle chip nacho appetizer, you can essentially get that on a dog (it is delicious).  Personally, I got a chili dog with cream cheese instead of onions.  Sounds odd unless you're from Cincinnati, but if you're familiar with Skyline chili dip, it ends up being that on a dog.  Heavenly.  Also, and most amazingly, it is heaven on a bun for only $3.\\n\\nMy tip?  They have funnel cakes.  They're not on the menu, they're $3, and they are the thickest, sweetest, most-cake-like funnel cakes I have ever had.

It's been almost two years now since the last time we were here and I have to say that this place just keeps getting better and better. The food is amazing and the service is on point. Everyone is extremely friendly and always greets us with a smile. \\n\\nWhenever we're back, we always try something new on the menu that we haven't had the last time we were here. The menu is huge and diverse. One side of the menu has different kinds of sushi and the other side has various burgers. The menu also lists specialty dishes that are so unique that you don't see anywhere else. We ended up ordering the Crab Rangoon dip to start. For our main course, we decided on the King's roll and the Rise and swine burger with a side of sweet potato fries and sweet & spicy cucumber salad. My boyfriend and I like to share the sushi and burger so that we can have the best of both worlds. Everything was made fresh to order and we found everything to be delicious and extremely flavorful as we remembered it to be. \\n\\nThe service here is phenomenal as well. Our server, Jacob, was very personable, attentive, and helpful with any questions we had. He always checked on us, refilled our drinks, and made sure everything was made to our liking. Although everything was perfect, one thing my boyfriend was disappointed was that they changed the audio in the restrooms. The last time we were here, there were  hilarious voice recordings in the restroom which my boyfriend and I enjoyed. To our amazement, Jacob told us that it was removed due to customer complaints. Honestly, it's lame how customers would complain about something like that. \\n\\nOverall, we absolutely love this place. Cowfish has become our go-to restaurant every time we visit Orlando. I definitely recommend this place if you're looking for great service and delicious food."},{"name":"John Barleycorns","address":"14610 SW Sequoia Pkwy","city":"Tigard","stars":"3.5","text":"This pub is great, its within walking distance to my house and close to where I work, the only problem is that when my dad and I ate there they double charged his credit card because they were trying to start a tab and kept doing a new charge rather than appending the new item.

I thought maybe there was some chicken hidden underneath the fries-no. Maybe I just got a particularly bad plate- the food usually isn't that bad. But it was fine-I was there to catch up with a friend who I hadn't seen in a while. While we were there, a line formed outside, as it usually does. As we are finishing up our meal, the waiter comes by a couple of times and eventually takes my friend's water glass and he later said that he thought he was just gone to fill it up.

We didn't eat for too long- maybe there (not including the wait) for about 30-40 minutes, if that.

Appetizers were all over the place from Asian to American in nature. \\n\\nWe shared the pork belly buns, shishito pepper, and queso. Pork belly buns were a little cold and the bun itself wasn't the softest. The shishito peppers were large and very tasty. Not too spicy but had a full spice Profile with each bite. Although, it did need a dipping sauce and lacked on that. Queso was the star and was devoured in few bites. Spinach and cheese really made this a great dish that was heartier than most other queso. Chips were fresh and a little warm as well which gave it a leg up on traditional offerings. For entree I had the ricotta gnocchi. Large dish as compared to other gnocchi dishes. Ricotta was tough to find and didn't spill out as I expected but each bite still very good. This is a healthier alternative with lots of veggies in the sauce. Simple dish and a little boring but not the worst pasta I've ever had, especially considering the bar-like genre of award 8. \\n\\nWe got in and out in a little over an hour with a full meal and few beers each.

The food came out quickly and the presentation of all of the plates was fantastic. The eggplant was nicely seared but its taste didn't stand out. The kale salad was one of the best I've had and the creamy pistachio dressing knocked it out of the ballpark. The halloumi had great texture and if you like mozzarella, you will likely like the halloumi, too. The chicken fried rabbit breaded in panko was delicious, and it was a refreshing and creative take on chicken fried steak. I expected the oil cured tuna belly to be very tender like fine sashimi, but it was very tough and chewy. The seared top side of the oil cured tuna belly was good, but once you reached the bottom unseared side it was nearly impossible to chew and eat. The off the menu, secret, secret burger had tons of ingredients that our server named off but after awhile I lost count of what exactly was in it. The burger patty was tender and had a smoky flavor and the bun was fluffy. All the other ingredients between the patty and bun made the burger tasty, but it was not the most amazing burger I have ever tasted.

I would go much more often if not for the long wait.  One gal passed out from the heat when we went in late August.  The bottleneck seems to be due to the fact that they only have one cutter.

The mushrooms were overly cooked. The home fries were cold.  I didn't like the idea of having to eat such a bad omelet. The only saving grace was the toast. I should have instead tried the veggie burger which has rave reviews.

Is it as good as goodness gets? Oh, it's up there. Is it worth the hype? I thought so. Is it worth going to Tatsu-Ya because it has more buzz than bees in heat and the weather's cooling down and you're bored of Pho and you wanna see how the Japanese do it and you don't have the time or patience to wait longer at Barley or Franklin and this place is a whole lot cheaper to boot? Hey, now we're talking.  \\n\\nThere's like a zillion treatises and blogs on the art of ramen, knock yourself out. Tatsu-Ya is based on a solid pork broth, with pork/shoyu and pork/miso blends. The pork/shoyu had a touch more bite for me, I thought it was pretty amazing stuff, and I was merrily spooning it away long after the noodles were gone. If you're considering a side, go for the garlic cloves that comes with a press. It's a clever idea and worth it. Parmesan cheese? Seriously?\\n\\nThey're apparently working on a veggie broth here, so if you're diehard meatless, I'd say hold off, because Edamame does not a meal make. I think the curry bowl with or without noodles is vegetarian, but coming here right now for that is like going to a steakhouse for salad. Whatever. Incidentally, the bathroom art here is a hoot.\\n\\nAnd finally, in an odd way, this place reminded me a lot of Barley Swine. For people with short attention spans. Seriously, it comes down to having great product, having to wait, having to share tables, and in the end, having a really good time. Nothing wrong with that. Wanna make a night of it? Watch \\"Tampopo\\" first, eat Tatsu-Ya, do lots of sake, and then follow up with \\"The Ramen Girl\\" for dessert.

Moey and I and her friends went on New Year's Eve and we had a rez which was most sagacious since it was mental that night. We waited at the bar as we were early and the friends showed up early too and we had cocktails at the bar which were well made and actually tasted as though alcohol was in the drinks. Our hibachi table was ready at exactly 8 o' clock postmeridian. All was excellently organized and choreographed on this chaotic evening as a nice lady took our drink app orders and hibachi requests and answered questions about the menu with politeness. She double-checked everyone's orders at the table and split and returned with our bevs (Scorpion Bowls with 151) and sushi apps. The hibachi chef appeared with great enthusiasm and joviality. He also double-checked everyone's orders and asked how we wanted out meats cooked and took heed to these requests. Moey and I got the Seafood Royal which was $29.95 (a.k.a. $30.00) which included lobster tail, scallops, and salmon. Moey's cronies got a similar which included lobster. This was a bargain. Portions were very generous and were expertly cooked. Mind you, you also get a fun show with flames shooting wicked high with the onion-volcano ignition being the most biggest. You also get a phat sake jet in your face by the chef accompanied by grilled veggies and bean sprouts and PFR and a salad and miso (horny) soup AND three beefy shrimp \\"au gratis.\\" You can't beat this, bro. Chris went bonkers over his food and was on Cloud 9 (see PIC). Just as a BTW, in a \\"regular\\" restaurant the seafood portion of scallops alone would cost you thirty bucks as would the lobster or the salmon.

Came here for a rehearsal dinner on a Friday at around 5pm. Place was nearly empty and the reservation for this private event was made months prior. The reservation was for a group of 17 people. Naturally as most big groups are, we were missing 2 or so people. They would not seat us until the additional people came. They claimed once everyone arrived, they would then know where to seat us. Their tone was aggressive, demanding, and unnecessary. More importantly, their reasoning contradicted everything we were told upon making this reservation. Not only did the restaurant have zero customers at that moment, but we also made the reservation (and was guaranteed) months prior for the specific table in the far right of the hibachi station that is sectioned off from the rest of the hibachi floor. We were also told that our guests could get seated as they arrive since it was not a busy time. \\n\\nOur reservation for the \\"private event\\" was clearly not communicated properly at the restaurant. They did not know we requested that specific table. We were told upon making the reservation that we should provide our own 'selected menu' for our guests to fill out on a separate sheet of paper. The waitresses had no idea what to do with those menu cards. They were a waste of our time to prepare. The overall management of this restaurant did not leave the best impression. \\n\\nWe selected this location for our rehearsal dinner since we were going for more of the casual atmosphere (no speeches and etc) and it was the best option for us given our location from the rehearsal site. We also had a few kids attending, so we wanted them to be entertained by the hibachi show. The adults were also amused with the 'show' for the most part. The food was fine. I ordered the sushi combo.

It's not a tacky kind of novelty, but a breath of fresh air to the downtown Columbus scene. It's located on 4th Avenue, where most other storefronts are vacant or dingy. Dirty Frank's boasts a bright yellow awning that begs you to come inside. It gives the area hope for a new vibrant nightlife (hey, it is open until 2AM, after all). \\n\\nThe hot dog joint has creative combos you'd never think to cook up back home. Or if you have, it has catchy quirky names to refer to them by. For instance, Laura's Pittsburgh Princess (french fries, coleslaw, and vinegar ON the hot dog), Zippity Zam (sriracha cream cheese with roasted red peppers), or one of my favorites, the Classy Lady (crumbled potato chips and cheddar cheese). \\n\\nFor the unadventurous type, you could have a \\"Your Weiner\\" with any of your own toppings, or a \\"Glenn Beck\\" which is billed as \\"just a plain old weiner.\\"\\n\\nAnother one of my all time favorites that I'd highly suggest to any visitor is Puff the Magic Popper (jalepenos, bacon, and cheddar cream cheese). I suggest getting fried leeks on the side, as they are a rare treat that I have only come to find at Dirty Frank's (a tastier, more adult version of onion rings). There are plenty of other fun sides to play around with as well, including tator tots (add bacon and cheese) and macaroni and cheese (make it a meal with the freakish hot dog octopus).\\n\\nThe hot dogs are a nice size (jumbo is available also) so you can usually get 2 different dogs for a perfect size meal. Vegetarian and vegan dogs also can be subsituted so that non-meat eaters can also enjoy the ridiculously tasty treats.\\n\\nAs if the place couldn't get any more fun, alcohol is served at all times. Add some liquor to a slush (I suggest cherry slush with whiskey) for a refreshing and different kind of cocktail, or grab some local beers such as Columbus Pale Ale. The addition of RC Cola and PBR on the menu really put yet another grin on my face.\\n\\nDirty Frank's is affordable as can be, with most all hot dogs costing $3 and sides just around the same. You could stuff yourself easily for $10. \\n\\nWhile I have never been to Dirty Frank's during these times, they do offer karaoke Monday nights from 9 to 1, and \\"Comedy with Relish\\" on Sunday nights from 9:30 to 11. Specials run throughout the week as well.\\n\\nThe only problem with Dirty Frank's is its size. For a \\"palace\\" it is rather tiny. It does give it a quaint feeling...but perhaps too quaint. With its growing popularity, it can be a bit cramped. The plus side is, you have plenty of fun things to look at, as it has a pretty wacky decor.\\n\\nIf you go to Dirty Frank's, I guarantee it will become a regular hangout for you."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Came at about 10:15 on a Saturday morning...was forewarned that there wouldn't be food in our mouths til 2:15.

Server and man who disingenuously claimed subsquently to be the manager were both sullen. Comestibles: cocktails were superb, frites were decent, but battered fish was awful. Server had not elaborated on the menu, offered any information about specialities or explained in response to our queries for any clarification. I asked to see the manager after our initial order was less food than expected normally for a shared plate at that cost, and our supplemental orders twice requested never arrived. A different man came to our table; in response to my question about his being the manager, he stated that he was. Eventually, the self-proclaimed owner said he had no manager as he was manager. He ignored my query about the other man previously lying. The one male guest in our party, my friend's American husband, had joined us belatedly so knew nothing about our complaint; nonetheless, the owner immediately shook hands with him and flattered him as a \\"gentleman.\\" I attempted to explain the previous problem, but the owner interrupted with comments about my being English. I began to explain that I enjoyed various cuisines by stating that my husband had been Muslim, but I was prevented from continuing with mention of Moroccan specialities plus a variety of food I had enjoyed in several other countries. Abruptly, the owner said, \\"I am not Muslim. Don't come back.\\" He presented the full check to the only male in our party, walked away, and my friend's husband settled the entire amount.

It was served on a large plate which included my two choices, a side of rice, edamame, and salad. The rice was fine, the edamame was over steamed, and the salad was a packaged lettuce/cabbage/carrot mix with an unusual orange citrus dressing. The teriyaki was fine but the cali roll was AWFUL!

The hype is real. \\n\\nNow for the food. I used a plastic knife the entire time for the brisket, and my goodness it cut so easily I was in shock. (I've live in Texas all my life and never once got this experience any where else) First bite in, and holy moly it melted in my mouth. I was almost in tears with how amazing it was. Same with the ribs, all my friend did was take the knife to cut off some meat and it just fell right off the bone. We all had a moment of silent in amazement for how good it looked. Five stars for my high cholesterol. \\n\\nAll in all, this is a great stop of those who are out of town and want to experience long lines and  really good BBQ."},{"name":"Wolf & Bear's","address":"3925 N Mississippi Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"What's up with the bad attitude ladies?

The reviewer who wondered if they had been smoking a pipe before the restaurant opened for  the day should know that they were not: the restaurant is next door to a smoke shop, and you sometimes get a whiff of the stuff the neighbors are smoking when the doors to both places get opened in some coincidental order, We've all become so accustomed to smoke free environments that we notice things like this, but none of the staff have been smoking and  there is really no smoke in the restaurant."},{"name":"Sushi Town","address":"5935 Hastings Street","city":"Burnaby","stars":"3.5","text":"Awesome roll, best in town, Sushi Town!!!!\\n\\n\\nBeen going to this place since they opened and boy are they packed every night now.

Don't question it, just go with it. \\n\\nThat decision will turn out to be one of the best decisions you made all month. Pork ramen is a little much for me - I rarely eat pork and the broth just tends to be a little too heavy and salty for me. (This is weird, because I am a huge fan of salt, but I just can't really get behind the pork aspect.)  \\n\\nVeggie ramen, though? Way to blow my mind, Ramen Tatsu-Ya. That broth was what I was hoping a bowl of ramen would be. Light, but filling. Not too heavy, not too salty - just right. Every flavor seemed to be perfectly balanced and that is exactly what I wanted. There's practically an entire garden's worth of vegetables in the bowl and plenty of noodles, too. I love soup like nobody's business and I could only eat a little more than half my bowl. I hated to leave anything behind, but next time I'll come with an empty stomach. \\n\\nI considered taking away a star since the veggie ramen is only offered on Sunday and you know I want that stuff every day of the week, but I figure they probably have a perfectly legitimate reason for not offering it every day. Maybe it just isn't cost effective or it takes too much time - whatever the reason, I trust it's a good one. When you get it all figured out, Tatsu-Ya, you can bet I'll be visiting more often. \\n\\nFunny story - Errol and I went for the extra garlic, too, which is brought out to you in cloves and they provide a garlic press. Maybe my hands are not as strong as I thought, but I could not squeeze all of the garlic through that press. Being the smart person that I am, I just scraped the last little bit of garlic into my bowl. I completely forgot about it until I bit right into it with some noodles later during the meal. Oh, yeah, my brain said, you did just put that right into your bowl. Hello, ultra garlic breath. I can assure you that the garlic smell emanating from my mouth scared off any and all vampires that night.

But, being the chocolate fiends we are, it still tasted good so we sipped. \\nThen came the food. . . \\nMy chicken was waaaaay over cooked. The meat was rubbery and tough and really tasteless because of how long they must have left it in the fryer. The cole slaw and ancho sauce they had was good, but not enough to make up for the chicken. Three bites was all I could muster. \\nMy son's burger was raw on the inside. Like the bun was soaked in blood. Now if I eat steak, I like it rare. If I am eating a burger and I know they grind the meat on location, I am okay with it being pink in the middle. . .  But a bleeding burger for my four year old from a trailer? Mmmm, no thanks. So I went to the counter and asked them to cook my son's burger more. They did, but it was charred black this time to where all you tasted was the burnt coal flavor. He took one bite and we told him to put it down. \\nMy husband had the cheese burger slider (same size as the kids BTW) and when I got it we just looked at each other. $6 for that tiny little thing? and his was pretty rare in the middle too, but he just ate around it. \\nThe fries were incredibly salty, which is a shame because if it wasn't I bet that it would have had a good flavor to it. \\nThey did give us a $10 gift certificate for my son's burger, which was extremely nice, and the people who worked there were very nice, but I just don't think they ever tasted the food they were making because if they did they would not serve that to anyone. \\nSo we ended up going to Sandy burger for a $3.49 Saturday special and ended our disappointing food night. . . \\nSorry mighty cone, it's just not working...."},{"name":"Starbucks","address":"1 South Station","city":"Boston","stars":"1.5","text":"By far the best coffee shop I have ever been to.

The restaurant provides a nice family dining atmosphere as well as a bar area.  Was greeted by a very friendly and attentive bartender and staff.  This was my first visit under the new management and I was extremely impressed.  The owner immediately addressed my desire to watch Thursday Night Football, by adding special NFL programming to their cable lineup making this my new sports watching getaway.  I read about the new chef and how the food had really improved under the new management, but had to find out firsthand. I ordered the Steak Tips and Fish and Chips both were excellent.  The fish was fresh, Haddock and the batter was light and not greasy. The steak tips were ordered medium and were very tender.  When I looked deeper into the chef's background and spoke with management, it became very clear why the food was so good.  I look forward to trying their other menu items as well.

The pho broth is richer than any other we've tried, and the sandwiches are great. Surprisingly the deep fried chicken wings rival/ edge out another well known restaurant in Chinatown. However, this is a mom & pop shop: while there is a charm & authenticity to both the decor and the restauraunteurs, it inherently creates some limits on output, variety and seating.\\n\\nThere are 2 tables for 2, and 2 larger tables (one of which is usually shared, so good luck seating a large party). On the other hand, located at Central at Garden City (the Richmond Walmart mall), parking (& other food options) are plentiful.\\n\\nThey also have a limited menu, generally dishes that feature rice are rare: lemon grass chicken on rice is a personal favourite of mine, but I can't order that here, unless it happens to be a daily special.\\n\\nAlso due to its smaller scale nature, prices tend to be slightly higher. This wouldn't normally make any difference, except there happens to be one of the least expensive / best bang for the buck Vietnamese restaurants right across from Bahn Mi.\\n\\nBut if you want to try the best in town? That's here. It's telling that we still eat here slightly more often than the more wallet friendly place across the street.\\n\\nThey also serve French desserts, which is a nice bonus. Macarons, anyone?\\n\\nRecommended: \\nDeep fried chicken wings, Beef Pho (try it with and without bone marrow), Chicken Pho (warning: both contain jalapenos, & the chicken definitely has more of a kick), spring rolls, and their sandwiches (called B√°nh m√¨). We actually haven't tried anything we haven't liked yet.\\n\\nAvoid: coming with large groups. Don't expect a full fledged menu.

She was on hold so all we heard was a recording that every few second kept repeating itself. My husband asked if we were ready to go, we all agreed \\"yes\\" and we left..throwing 95% of our food away. $30 down the drain. The cokes were the best items purchased. Needless to say we won't be back. Bad service, blah food, & unsanitary worker. Please let me state that we try all sorts of restaurants...chain to mom and pop from east to west coast.

Ridiculous. \\n\\nI feel cheated. I want my money back. Or at least a voucher for their real ramen. Sadface. \\n\\nAlso had the spicy edemame. Pretty decent. Nothing to brag about though. \\n\\nI SHOULD'VE UPDATED EARLIER.... but TATSUYA... I LOVE YOUR THIN NOODLES NOW.

I used to hate thin noodles, but I've actually grown to really really LIKE Tatsuya's thin ones vs. these new thicker ones. They perfected the cooking time of those thin ones so they always came out perfectly chewy. These thick ones were a little too chewy for me-- kind of like the Michi Ramen ones. \\n(UPDATE: they only had thick noodles that Sunday...they still have the thin ones :D YESSSS) \\n\\nAnyways, the point of my review is to advise NEWCOMERS to go only for dinner for now...until they figure this whole lunch business out.

The server did NOT even bother telling me the whole wok INCLUDING the metal handles were boiling hot. The wok was tipping over slightly because they carelessly put the dish on the table. Regardless of the stone plate, the handles are there for a reason and this resulted in me trying to adjust the crooked wok and getting 2 fingers immediately burned. I informed the staff and told them their server should be telling their customers about the hot wok they serve the ramen in and instead of offering some bandaids (they must at least have a first aid kit right?) or maybe compensation for my meal, they just gave me a cup of ice and walked away. Not until I specifically asked for a bandaid did they give me one, and that took 30-40 minutes AND the restaurant was empty. This ruined the entire experience as the burns made my fingers bubble up and I couldn't eat comfortably. The staff should know the common practise of warning customers and shouldn't expect everyone to know how they serve their dishes. \\n\\nRegarding the food, the chicken was not bad but definitely overpriced for the portions they give you.

Like many Brazilian steakhouses, they use the red/green coaster method to know whether to bring the meats to you or give you a break.\\n\\nThe Meats:\\nThe sirloin was absolutely DELICIOUS. I was fortunate to have a choice of doneness; later during our meal, when they didn't have medium rare available, the server when back to get a freshly grilled piece for me! I would rank the skirt steak as my second favorite. I liked the lamb, but I found it a bit too salty. There was so much selection brought to us that night, I lost track of which ones I had, but I remember being least satisfied with the chicken. It was flavorful, but the pieces I got were too dry.\\n\\nSalad Bar:\\nThe salad bar was bountiful, with many fresh selections! If you like veggies, seafood, or cold meats, there is something for every tastebud here. My go-to for Brazilian BBQ places always includes hearts-of palm at the salad bar, and this place didn't disappoint. Fresh and crisp. Honorable mention to the artichoke salad and the fresh mozzarella + tomato. Sushi selection was limited to a few rolls only that night, not sure if they offer more (and actual nigiri sushi), but then again, you're not coming here for sushi.\\n\\nPrice:\\nNow, I was treated for dinner, but according to the website, the price for the full experience (incl meats + salad bar) dinner is $45/pp, $25/kids  6-12, under 5 Free. The salad bar buffet only is $25, and not sure if kids pricing is less. That's about on par with other rodizio/ churrascaria restaurants I've been to in New York, and the quality was quite good. Service was also good; waiters were attentive to us during dinner, and came by periodically to take away our dirty plates and glasses. Though it wasn't crowded that night, a few times we had to call a server to our table due to overcrowding with dishes. Parking is ample right outside in the lot. They also offer a kids play area, but the website shows a room that is stocked with arcade & crane games, but that wasn't the case when I was there last (see my photo). It was simply a room that had a few kiddie chairs and toys, with a large TV on the wall.

I did not find this particularly professional, especially given the dressier white chairs and tablecloths.  The service was ok, nothing to mark in the good or horrible column.  \\n\\nIn our menu choices, the strength was in the starters.  My bf and I split two starters and were pleased when they arrived split equally on two separate plates - very nice presentation.  The Crisped Jumbo Lump Crabcakes were wonderful - great flavor and served in a way that allowed the main ingredient to shine through rather than drowning it in some sort of sauce.  We also split the Warm Lobster Cocktail (highly recommended) served in a martini glass with large pieces of lobster and black truffle potatoes.  \\n\\nAfter such a great start, I was somewhat let down by my entr√©e - slow roasted pork.  The pork had a nice flavor, but the accompanying natural jus was somewhat greasy and it overwhelmed the meat.  The shining star of this entr√©e was the sage and blue cheese polenta.  This was an amazing side and I hope to see it served with different menu items other than the pork.  I finished the evening with the warm chocolate cheesecake, which we split.  It was different than I expected (I called it \\"cheesecake...deconstructed\\") with a minimalist approach to the ingredients, rather than serving everything together.  It was good, but I was not as ecstatic as others.\\n\\nAll in all, Aria was a nice choice.

This is definitely one of the better happy hours places to go if you like seafood--especially steamed mussels, clams (the clam isn't on the happy hour menu at this time, but it was before) and oyster shooters! If you've read my previous reviews, Portland City Grill used to be my favorite happy hour spot until they changed up their happy hour menu and now the food is so disappointing that I haven't been back there for over 1.5 years! \\n\\nAnyways, back to Jake's... definitely one of the better happy hour places to go as I'm really all about happy hour food and not the drinks! The happy hour prices aren't one of the cheaper ones either even for the quality or type of food they offer, but that's with most establishments in the last few years. \\n\\nThe service... damn, those waitresses must be overpaid as for the prices of their food, you would definitely expect better than mediocre service. As for dinner, you can't go wrong here either as the food is pretty good. I took my NBA Laker's friend and King's scout here for dinner at different times and they both loved this place--especially their stuffed salmon with dungeness crab, shrimp, and cheese! They seriously know how to cook that salmon right--it just melts in your mouth and worth the price as it's a pretty spendy dish. I've had their other dishes and they're all pretty good although not memorable... and definitely nothing beats that stuffed salmon. I think I'd give this place 5-stars if the service matched their $$$ prices and they had more memorable dishes, but definitely still a good place for food during happy hour or dinner!"},{"name":"Jake's Famous Crawfish","address":"401 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"If you enjoy fresh seafood and are looking to  indulge in Portland this is a must have.

Is it sad that the complimentary bread and butter was the highlight? I also enjoyed the seafood risotto, and the rum raisin ice cream. My colleague ordered the steak frites. The frites were good, the steak however was not prepared to her liking. The cheese plate was fine...but how can you go wrong with a cheese plate?\\n\\nThe bad:\\n\\n- My mushroom soup was incredibly bland and uninteresting; my colleague felt the same way about hers. In fact, no one was really impressed by their entrees. \\n\\n- The desserts were just as boring and uninspired. The s'mores dessert was just plain bizarre. It was microscopic in portions, and 90% of the work seemed to go into plating and presentation. My colleague ordered an apple crumble that was more like a cake. \\n\\n- The price, relative to the portions and the overall food quality. Why do restaurants try to instill a sense of culinary artistry and exclusivity by offering smaller portions at inflated prices? That may fly when the quality of food is excellent, but this food is not. Over $10 for a cup of bland mushroom soup? I think not. Focus on quality, THEN raise your prices.\\n\\n- The cocktails. I was happy with my scotches, but my four other colleagues were unimpressed with the specialty drinks.\\n\\nAccording to the restaurant website, the kitchen chef rotates every six months. The current kitchen is run by 'Bread & Salt'. Let's hope they're due for a change soon! Definitely check the current kitchen and menu before you stop in.  Hopefully a change will give me a chance to give Wink & Nod a more favorable review!"},{"name":"No Mas! Cantina","address":"180 Walker St SW, Ste B","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Last night was \\"date night\\" so we decided to try out No Mas Cantina. Not super romantic, but since it was our 1,000-something date together, you can say that a romantic atmosphere is not a requirement for date-night. \\n\\nImmediately walking up, I saw a patio that made me wish it was a warm late-August evening. It screamed for me to sit and drink margaritas on it! Maybe in another 5 months I'll come back to enjoy it. The interior is open, and fun. The waitress said we'd have a 25 minute wait, but as soon as we sat at the bar to order a drink, our pager went off. Kind of strange, but we rolled with it. \\n\\nIt took our waitress 7+ minutes to come up, introduce herself, and take our drink orders. Other than that initial lull, she was pretty prompt, and informative. We were steered toward the \\"original margarita\\" I believe it's called. The $10 one, saying that if we weren't into overly sweet ritas that we should stay away from the no mas margarita. Well, these $10 margaritas were strooooooong and this is coming from a girl that loves a strong margarita. We both finished ours without a problem, but both believed we would've enjoyed the no mas margarita more. \\n\\nThe queso was delicious. You can add different ingredients for an enhanced taste. We added the spicy beef & jalapenos. If only they could create some kind of warming contraption to keep the queso fresh through my who meal. \\n\\nFor dinner I had the salmon. My salmon was a little overcooked but it was hardly noticeable amongst the exquisite flavors of my dish. The sauce, mashed potatoes, squash, and zucchini combined with the salmon was one of the best combinations that has touched my taste-buds in awhile. My husbands shrimp enchiladas paled in comparison to my dish, although he thoroughly enjoyed his as well. I hear good things about the desserts, but we were so stuffed there was no way we could even look at the dessert menu. \\n\\nThere were a total of 3 large (20+ people) parties around the restaurant, so I feel like they would be really accommodating to large parties. I could see myself meeting a bunch of friend here, enjoying the patio, or having another date night with my husband... overall I'm pretty impressed with No Mas Cantina, and I think if you give it a chance, you will be too."},{"name":"Smashburger","address":"1298 Worcester St","city":"Natick","stars":"3","text":"I had a wonderful experience at Smashburger today!

Getting charged for things you didn't order, and still having to pay for them despite many repeated efforts to get said items off the bill,\\n2. Getting beer spilled over your lap without so much as an apology,\\n3. Getting your table cleared before you finish eating,\\n4. Saying you want to order more beer but being ignored,\\n5. Getting charged extra money for various menu items (the multigrain roll was +$1, not on the menu, some of the beers were $.50-1 more than listed on the menu)\\nthen congratulations! The Squealing Pig would be PERFECT for you and you should go everyday!\\n\\nIf not, then I suggest you take your business to the plethora of great bars in the area.\\n\\nToday, a large group of my friends and I arrived at the Squealing Pig to celebrate the end of classes. A few left early (all non-drinkers), while many of us stayed and drank more beers. When it came time to pay our bill, there were two beers on there that we hadn't ordered. (We hadn't drunk very many--it was still early--and we double checked what everyone had drunk before we even brought up the charges to the staff.) We called over the server and disputed the charges, being all 'it's cool, people make mistakes'. She said she couldn't do anything about it, and we were referred to the manager, who told us that there was \\"no possible way that there could be a mistake\\" because the \\"computer\\" told him so and that mistakes NEVER happen. (PS: How do things get into the computer? People. Whoo, so smart! If people were that perfect, that'd be awesome, but EVERYONE makes mistakes) Now, I'm the type of person who will tell the server if something DOESN'T end up on my bill, so trust me, none of us were trying to 'steal' beers (I mean, why would we lie about a $13 charge anyway? We're not stupid or that cheap, you know.)\\n\\nNow, the service stuff is mostly excusable (except when my friend had beer splashed directly his lap, and the server just kind of made a weird face at us instead of apologizing, but maybe she was tired. I'll give her the benefit of the doubt), but if they're gonna change the prices in their computer, they really should change the prices in the menu. \\n\\nOverall? Maybe the food here is pretty good, but considering that the restaurant has terrible service and will put things on your bill that you didn't order (and be annoyed with you when you try to tell them that it's not true), I'd rather not come here ever again--and all my friends who were with me are planning to do the same. Nothing against spending money--oh, I LOVE going out--but I mean, why would you CHOOSE to bar/restaurants that steal money from you?

I got a nitro brewed coffee which was about $5 while we waited in line and I wouldn't recommend buying it. You can get better coffee elsewhere. When we finally got to order we ordered the pork ribs, brisket, pulled pork and links. My favorite was the brisket. I thought the pork ribs and pulls pork was good but I would've been happy just eating the brisket. They give you a few slices of white toast with your order and there's pickle and onions near the sauces by the exit.

If I'm paying 14$ for a sandwich, please pile all of the ingredients onto the bread for me first, please. Maybe even slice it. My girlfriend's frittata had the potential to be good, but it just tasted kind of bland - It really just needed more salt. This is a small and seemingly nitpicky thing but for a breakfast/brunch of this cost, they should be able to nail down the amount of sodium to put in an egg dish.

Oh wait... not until the two kids who were sitting in line with their chairs had about 5 more friends come in slowly throughout the rest of the morning.  Honestly, these kids are lucky it was too damn early to start a confrontation.  Anyways, we actually had a good time waiting in line because we actually made conversation with a pilot who was stationed in San Antonio and had drove an hour or so away early morning just to have this bbq.  Must be good right?!\\n\\nWhile we were waiting for the doors open, we knocked back a few beers.  The smell of smoke was lingering in the air which made me even hungrier as we patiently waited.  Once the doors opened and we got in, first thing I did was pick up a t-shirt like the tourist I am.  We ordered a pound of fatty brisket, half pound of ribs and half pound of pulled pork.  We didnt want any sides to full us up, our mission was just to eat the meat.  The guy cutting the meat wasn't the owner but he was friendly and even showed off the meats and made sure everything looked well.  While I was in line i did see Aaron Franklin in the restaurant actually talking to the pilot who was in line with us.  Apparently the pilot knew his cousin.  This is where I wish I snapped a picture with him because this guy is a BBQ Master for sure!\\n\\nLets just say the fatty brisket is AMAZING!!!! The meat literally breaks apart when you pick up the meat and it melts in your mouth.  The ribs fell off the bone and were still soft and had a nice smoke flavor to it.

To start things off, the buttermilk fried chicken was well breaded and juicy. The absolute kicker was that the meat was fall off the bone good - it literally comes off the bone effortlessly. The party tots were flavorful and drizzled with a generous amount of kimchi butter, sweet chill, and teriyaki sauce to create a dish with complementary flavors that just worked perfectly in combination. Mama Mei's Pork Noodle Soup was filling and reminiscent of a Southeast Asian inspired dish. The coup de grace was the calamansi lemon sorbet which came with 3 giant scoops for you to savor. It was very refreshing and great as a palette cleanser after eating all that flavorful food. You get a good amount of food for the price you are getting for dinner and it fills you up in no time at all.

We wanted to take them out to a nice restaurant, and after a recent wonderful experience at Canoe (Aria's 'sister' restaurant), my wife and I decided to take them to Aria.\\n\\nOverall, I thought the restaurant itself was nice, if not a bit sterile. The heavy-handed use of black and white provided a bit of elegance, but also came across as a bit cold. On top of that, I felt that the restaurant itself was a bit too tightly-packed for my tastes, and we were sitting just a little to close to the diners to our right and left. Service was good, but nothing particularly noteworthy in either direction. Now on to the food...\\n\\nThe food was excellent, albeit a bit inconsistent. For starters, my wife ordered the Warm Lobster Cocktail (served elegantly in a martini glass), my mother ordered the Tempura Jumbo Prawns, my father ordered the Foie Gras, and I ordered the Crab Cakes. My wife and I both thought that her starter was about one of the tastiest things either of us had ever eaten. The presentation was quite nice, the lobster perfectly cooked, and the broccoli puree underneath was to die for. I also was in crab cake heaven. They were everything a good crab cake should be -- lots of crab, almost no 'filler'. My mother loved her prawns, and I agree that they were lovely (good size, well cooked), but they were essentially deep-fried shrimp, and just didn't stand out for me.  Overall, a flat dish for me; but my mom loved it. As a general rule, I don't eat foie gras, so I didn't try my dad's dish. He really enjoyed it; however, my mother (who loves foie gras) and wife both tried it and thought it was all right at best.\\n\\nFor our main courses, my wife had the Scallops, my mother had the short ribs, my father the Duck breast, and I had the Slow-Roasted Pork. Like with the starters, both myself and my wife thought that the scallops were out of this world. On top of that, the shrimp and lobster risotto was superb and one of the better risotto's I've had in a restaurant. I also thought that my mother's short ribs were incredible:. Perfectly cooked with an wonderful flavor. No one (except for my dad) liked the duck breast. To me, the dish had numerous problems -- the presentation was out-dated and amateurish, there wasn't much duck breast, and I thought it was a bit over-cooked. Overall, a major disappointment for one of my favorite meats. I'll also say that I was a bit disappointed with the slow-roasted pork. It came across as too greasy and heavy, making it tougher to finish than I would have liked. With that, the flavor just wasn't as refined as I was expecting. The accompanying side (blue cheese and sage polenta) was incredible and easily out-shined the pork.\\n\\nMy wife and I split the Panna Cotta for dessert, and although it was very good, it wasn't as light and smooth as others I've had before.\\n\\nOverall, I really liked Aria, but must say again that I thought the food to be a bit inconsistent. When they got a dish right, it was simply knocked out of the park, and was as good as food I've had anywhere else. Unfortunately, not all dishes were up to this level. I'd probably give it a 3.5 overall, but I'll round up to a 4."},{"name":"Sun Century Cafe","address":"3700 No 3 Road","city":"Richmond","stars":"3.5","text":"Decent place if you're looking for the HK-style cafe food, especially if you're stuck along the mayhem near Yaohan centre.

I've come here at least 5 times for company lunches (it's clearly a colleague fav). I haven't had a chance to try brunch or dinner here, so this is purely a weekday lunch review. \\n\\nThe Food: \\nAlways. Get. Apps. They have such delicious bites for sharing! The highlight of the bunch is fried green tomatoes. If you're a sad soul who doesn't like goat cheese, stay away from these deliciously tangy, crunchy bites of heaven. The tomatoes are always perfectly crisp, enveloped in creamy goat cheese and plated on an oil/tomato reduction - yum. The pimento cheese is another fan fav - great cheese with crispy herbed crackers. I've also had the gulf shrimp, which were the least impressive but still a winner as far as creamy flavors paired with fresh shrimp. \\n\\nOnto the entrees - The fried chicken is obviously the signature dish, an honor well deserved. I'm not a huge white-meat gal and this crispy, juicy chicken makes me a convert. You can go ahead and put that honey-thyme jus on all my food from now on, as far as I'm concerned. Beware, though, as this dish is HEAVY and will put you to sleep for the rest of the day. The recent revamp of the Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes is my new true love here. This is one of the lighter options - the crab cakes have good hunks of crab that are just asking to be dipped into the bomb asparagus puree. Once your palette gets tired of the richness, you can move onto the zesty salad with potatoes and start all over again. The honorable mention here is the shrimp and grits, another fabulous dish that leans on the heavier side. The poblano gravy is a win. \\n\\nDessert - Get the upside down pineapple cake! This is a unique offering at restaurants these days and it doesn't disappoint. The tangy sweet pineapple is meant to be paired with creamy bourbon caramel.  \\n\\nAtmosphere/Service: I've always had fabulous servers here that are incredibly professional.

However the portion size has shrunk and chips are no longer served on the size, which for $11+ is a tad pricey.

The wait can be a bit long, and they only take reservations for parties of 6 or more, so you may have a while to wait.  I suggest coming in groups of 4, as there are more 4 tops than tables for 2 available so you may get seated quicker. \\n\\nThey have a fun and interesting selection of house cocktails with a Mexican spin.

The flautas were amazing considering they are fried, but didn't taste greasy in the slightest.  More of a crispy baked texture.  This made me happy.  The sauces, the portions, everything was great.  They also have a vegetarian flauta with potato, which our dining companions had and said was incredible.  \\n\\nService was pretty amazing.  Everyone was friendly, happy, helpful, and we were well taken care of.  We had our main server, plus a young man that helped us with our drinks and went to check if there was pozole still, and then a manager type fella that came to see if everything was good.  The hostess was also very sweet.  Nice to see people enjoying their jobs.  \\n\\nOnly other complaints would be the lack of waiting area, and the volume inside AND outside.  Due to only a couple seats being available if you are waiting for a table, you are forced to wait outside so you don't block the doorway to the neighbour's wine shop in their shared entrance.  Outside, though sunny, was not pleasant, as you don't want to stray too far in case your name gets called, and a loud street performer is parked right out front.  Decent music, Mexican themed, but holy hell my ears were ringing.  Then of course you are subjected to the second hand smoke from whoever decides to stand there and light up.  Inside was just as loud with the restaurant's own music blaring.  It was hard to hear our friends across the tiny table.  \\n\\nOverall - Really great food, excellent service, needs sustainable fish option, very loud, no waiting area for long waits."},{"name":"Border Caf√©","address":"32 Church St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"For anyone who had Border Cafe as his or her first Mexican experience, I don't blame you for avoiding Latin food.

Bar-B-Q","address":"1238 Dekalb Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"As a California native, I was told by my Atlanta friends that I've never had true BBQ. They were right. Fox Bros. is the first bbq I've had in the south, and after first taste, I am a believer!\\n\\nParking:\\n\\nSo during the prime dinner hours, parking can be difficult. They have a small lot right out front, but if there are no more spaces, you'll have to try your luck around the neighborhood.\\n\\nWait time\\nSince this place is one of the more popular BBQ restaurants, there is definitely going to be a line during prime hours. The first time I went, around 8PM, we had to wait an hour for a party of 6. The second time I went, I was about an hour before closing and there was just a 20 minute wait. FYI: THEY WILL ONLY SEAT YOU IF EVERYONE IN YOUR PARTY IS THERE. If you are still waiting for people to arrive, you'll have to wait. Also, if you go too late, they could be out of pulled pork so call in and ask.\\n\\nFood:\\n\\nI've had the jalape√±o poppers and the fried pickles. I'm pretty biased when it comes to the fried pickles because I am a certified pickle lover. They were delicious! The poppers were pretty solid too. I can't handle very spicy foods, but these were perfect!!!!\\n\\nFor entree, I usually only order the plates. If you get the everything plate, I think it's enough for 2 people, unless you are a very hungry man... then you can probably eat it by yourself. I've ordered the combo plate and everything plate and that filled 3 of us up (2 hungry girls and 1 hungry guy), and we had a little leftovers.\\n\\nI've had their pulled pork, smoked pork, brisket, ribs, wings and chicken.  Whenever I think about that pulled pork, I start salivating. It was SOOOOOOOO tender. And the way the ribs just fell off the bone... I can replay that image in my mind over and over again. I am a huge meat eater so I can appreciate when meat is cooked well. And let me tell you. It was amazing!!!!!!! I know the meat is good when I don't have to reach for the BBQ sauce even though their BBQ sauce is ON POINT! Also, if you think that you're not going to get the wings because they're just wings you can get anywhere, you're wrong. Their wings are pretty damn good. They use their spicy bbq sauce. You can have it on the side or on the wings already.\\n\\nThe chicken is really tasty too. The brisket fell a little bit short the one time I had it.\\n\\nAs for sides, I've had the collard greens, tater tots, fried okra, brunswick stew, fox-a-roni, potato salad and frito pie. \\n\\nThe frito pie is basically chili cheese fries but with fritos. They serve it right in a fritos bag. It was definitely something I've seen before, but honestly, it's nothing crazy special. My friends absolutely go crazy for it though. I've actually tried making it at home, and it's pretty easy!\\n\\nThe brunswick stew is terrific. It has a sweet taste. My favorite though, is the fox-a-roni. It's basically brunswick stew with mac n cheese. \\n\\nOverall... if I was told I that I could have one last meal in Atlanta before I die, i would choose that meal to be from fox bros.

For my meal, I had a breakfast burrito which could've been better. It was lacking in terms of spices or taste and overpowered by plain scrambled eggs and undercooked large bits of potato. Somewhere in there, I heard there was chorizo but I didn't taste it. It also came with rice (seemed like minute rice) and refried black beans. My man friend ordered the grilled skirt steak which was good, although the portion of the actual skirt steak was meager. \\n\\nDecor was fine-- on a bright Sunday morning the restaurant was well lit, bustling and I felt like I was in a church because the ceilings were so high. \\n\\nService-- also fine though host staff were a little slow on the uptake. \\n\\nIn short, the experience was good though I would've prefered to come early on a Saturday for Saturday Fiesta Brunch for $7.95 instead."},{"name":"Kung Fu Saloon","address":"716 West 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"used to go here before 'getting smashed' took on too literal of a meaning. but i guess that's what i get for going to a place named after a fighting style. watch out for violence."},{"name":"Border Caf√©","address":"32 Church St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"i've been going here since i was 6 years old and it has never disappointed ... interesting thing  ... i've only had alcoholic beverages here twice ... they ask you when you enter if you'll be drinking alcohol tonight ... once we said no, then after we were seated, decided we'd like a drink, apparently they ask you that question because it's a cambridge ordinance to have a certain area alcohol free, and our table was right at the line!!"},{"name":"Barrel & Boar Creekside","address":"121 Mill St","city":"Gahanna","stars":"4","text":"The gem of Creekside.

They fry their wings hard, which is not my preference so that was a down check for me, but I acknowledge that some people like them that way.  Their flavoring was ok.

Brandon also assured us that their menu was a little different and if we ordered something we didn't like, he would gladly get something else for us to enjoy.  The menu is overpriced, which can be expected because of the location. I didn't see any happy hour on the menu, but maybe they have a separate menu for this? If so, I would suggest trying to go during that time. Dinner for two and a couple drinks was about $80 total.

A big group of us dined here before a night of clubbing at Opera:\\n\\nHighlights:\\n- the free basket of cornbread and biscuits.  The biscuits were pretty ordinary, but the cornbread was some of the best I've ever had.  I enjoyed that it was not dry and crumbly like most versions I've tried.\\n- the Fried Chicken was fantastic.  The crust had an excellent flavor and you could tell the chicken was of a high quality.  It was a huge portion and I also liked that it had very little bone in it.  The mashed potatoes that came on the side were nothing special though.\\n- Great location, especially if you are hitting the Midtown nightlife afterwards.\\n\\nLowlights:\\n- Appetizer field green salad was nothing exciting.  Definitely not worth the $7 or so it costs on the regular menu.\\n- They had a special dessert of warm chocolate chip cookies with vanilla ice cream and chocolate ganache.  On the menu, it sounded blissful.  In reality, the cookies were hard and not warm (think Chips Ahoy), and I didn't see any chocolate ganache.\\n- Jack and Cokes were $10 each and pretty weak.  If I'm going to pay double-digits for a drink, I at least expect it to be fairly strong.\\n- Service was capable, but not very friendly.\\n\\nI won't be adding South City to my regular rotation but it's a pretty good spot for occasional dining.

Not like the chewy texture I crave, it was too mushy.  The root veggies were good, but not much mushroom reduction.. there was a lot of a mysterious green oil that seemed to be a garnish.  That was on my sweet potato soup as well.  Didn't need to see it again, or to add oil to a savory dish.  Overall, it read more as a shepherd's pie than a rustic italian gnocchi.

We got the fried chicken wings for apps, since Yelpers liked the fried chicken (good).  Ordered the sampler for 4 which was about $58 that came with ribs, chicken, and choice of brisket.  Ribs - really meatiest I've ever had, not dry or overcooked, not too fatty.  An A for ribs.  Chicken was good too.  Brisket was a mite dry.  Mash potato was good, but they gave us only a serving for 1 or 2 persons.  Collard greens tasted a little too sweet, maybe molasses.  Corn bread was good - not as good as Blue Ribbon.  For us the disappointment was the sauces - none of the flavors can match the sauces at Blue Ribbon.

First, the pizza is good enough that we just ordered take out pizza for the second time. We have one of their printed menus that says pizzas are half-priced on Mondays, which is what we paid the first time a few months ago. This time, after being quoted full price for the pizzas as I placed my order on the phone (on Monday), I questioned the young man on the phone about the half price deal. He consulted with someone else and then informed me that they are now just taking $5.00 off per pizza. I decided not to press about the price because my dining partner was anxious for pizza, and I didn't want it to get complicated (because my dining partner pinches pennies and would have made a big deal out of it).\\n\\nI went to pick up our pizza order (they're just across the street from us), and paid while the pizzas were still baking in the oven. I asked the friendly young man behind the counter if they had some new printed menus with current prices. He informed me the menus were still being designed. Meanwhile, he charged me full price for the pizzas. That's the weird thing. I was the only customer. I'm sure he knew I was the person he spoke with on the phone, yet he still charged full price without taking off $5.00 per pizza (as far as I could tell at the time). Maybe they had raised all of their prices since the original menus were printed. I wasn't at all interested in fussing about it with the young man. However, this will probably discourage us from ordering again soon. (NOTE: Subsequent to this review, I was contacted by the owner and received a gracious response. See last paragraph below.)\\n\\nI took home the two large pizzas we had ordered. One was the \\"Chelsea\\" (grilled chicken, bacon, and ranch dressing). The other was a two-topping large with extra cheese and black olives. I had prepared a nice beet and green bean salad with candied pecans at home to go with. (Just throwing that in.) We enjoyed the pizzas. The crust is notably thin and oven-blackened on the bottom with a nice dusting of corn meal. The cheese pizza was yummy and chewy with lots of cheese and ample black olives. The sauce was sparse but overall it was good (if you like a thin floppy crust with a few bubbles - as I do). The Chelsea pizza didn't have much chicken, but it was enough to pass. The bacon was nicely crunchy and crumbled into small bits so it worked well in the eating. We didn't detect ranch flavor at all though.\\n\\nI'm calling this a weird review because I don't dislike this establishment. The pizza is good and it fits the bill when frozen pizza, or other massive chain pizza won't do (we never order big chain pizza anyway). This establishment seems to be family run, which I fully support. Small businesses deserve our patronage. They give our communities character and fill our needs in a more personal way. I could have made a fuss about being overcharged, but I've come not to expect mathematical genius, or nuance in negotiating with kids running a pizza joint, which is how this feels. I hope they get it together though. Their pizza formula is good enough to repeat, but they should clean up their act as far as menu and pricing. It's just pizza, but it's also our money. To some, paying more could mean doing business some place else. I know my cheap dining partner will probably not be anxious to patronize again, at least not without my giving a little nudge.\\n\\nFOLLOW UP NOTE: Shortly after submitting my review, I heard from the owner of this establishment. After a few exchanged messages, the owner determined there had been an error in applying a discount at the time of my last visit, and I was graciously offered fair compensation. I was assured by the owner that his family employees are honest, and I understand people make mistakes. I would not discourage anyone from doing business with Brick Stone. Their pizza is very good quality and definitely satisfying.\\n\\nBest wishes, Brick Stone.

I was a finicky customer and asked for extra pickles with my sandwich and subbed in potato salad for fries after the ticket when in, and all my requests were taken care of.\\n\\nSolid Food: Ordered the pulled pork sandwich with potato salad and a small order of those fried mac and cheese bites everyone keeps going on about. Liked the pork, it was definetly served Carolina style with tons of vinegar which I do like, I just wonder if you can ever get it differently so you can actually use one of the 6 sauces they put out. None which I explored because my pulled pork was already so saturated with that vinegar flavor. Pro tip: for cutting the spicy vinegary-taste there's nothing better than cold potato salad, and these folks do it right. Last I'm sad to say I was a bit let down by the fried mac and cheese bites, I expected a cheesey, gooey block of mac and cheese (to be fair my expectations were directly related to having had fried mac and cheese at the NC State Fair as well as the Raleigh Cheesecak Factory). I found these bites to be both a bit dry and almost too hot to eat. They came out with my sandwich and I had to wait for them to cool down til I was almost done with my sandwich to taste and cheesy flavor as opposed to just heat. \\n\\nPrice: It's on par with area pricing and fair for what it is. If you order well or light here you can make off with a pretty cheap dinner, had I just gottent he sandwich and the magner's cider it would've been about $14 after tax.\\n\\nLocation: Good location on Harvard Ave, space itself was inviting and neatly directed with soul records.

The food was delivered in a decent amount of time.\\n\\nSeeing that it is an Italian restaurant, I expect to experience good Italian food.  I ordered a dish that had flat noodles, red sauce and chicken.  Since I never been there, I wanted to keep it simple.  Once we received our plates, we asked for parmesan cheese and was told that they ran out and the manager was at the store picking some up.  What? \\n\\nThe red sauce was not done well.  There wasn't enough seasoning and it tasted like they simply opened a can of tomato sauce and dumped it over the noodles.\\nThe chicken had gristles and fat in every chunky piece.  Disgusting.  Needless to say, I was not happy with my food.  \\n\\nThe waitress came to check on us several times but it was \\"how is everything? Great! Awesome!\\" and then she would walk away.  She didn't give anyone a chance to respond and after awhile, no one at my table even looked up when she came to the table.\\n\\nShe asked if we wanted dessert and the choices were apple pie, pumpkin pie and cheesecake.  One person ordered apple pie and was later told that there wasn't any and the manager was at the store picking it up.  Okay.  There seems to be a trend because other tables tried to order from the menu and was told, we don't have that this evening but the manager is at the store. What confuses me is the place doesn't open until 5:00pm.  At no point in time did you realize that you were out of food?\\n\\nI definitely expected better and I am pretty sure I will not go there again."},{"name":"Marco's Restaurant","address":"47 Newbury St","city":"Peabody","stars":"4","text":"I've had better!

While there are few places that I would say are worth a long wait (Father's Office in LA, and Hole in the Wall just North of Chicago), I've really wanted to try it here and was determined. I prepared myself, my schedule, and most importantly, my appetite for a potential long wait. Such as in life, once you let go, the world opens up to you and on a Tuesday night near 8 o'clock, there was no line but the one inside meaning it took 10 mins to order and get seated and then about 3 seconds before our food arrived which was awesome. Speaking of awesome, the Ramen here is legit. Since moving to Austin and being disappointed after over-hyped place after over-hyped place, I had some concern I may find the same here, but I did not.\\n\\nMy friend and I each got the original ramen and I added an extra egg to mine. The things that have been said here are true, the broth is delicious and for someone who is good at detecting when things are over salted, which broths often tend to be, this one was not at all. The broth was rich, deep and complex. The noodles  were a little different from what I was expecting, but not in a bad way. The egg was delicious and sweet and everything in the bowl just tastes better when you have it in accompaniment to the broth. At one point during conversation I asked my friend to give me a moment so I could fully enjoy my bite. I did find the pork belly to be a bit dry (not terribly) as I read from another reviewer, but it was still tender and flavorful.\\n\\nThe table next to us ordered the Chashu bowl as an addition to their ramen and I am so doing that next time. They were generous and encouraged us to try a bite of theirs and it was so freaking good. The pork was juicer than was in our ramen.\\n\\nThe service was great too and the atmosphere perfect for a hot bowl of ramen.\\n\\nI can't say any place is worth much longer than a 30-40 minute wait (especially Tupelo Honey in Asheville, NC, definitely not worth the wait in my opinion), but whether you decide to wait or find a good off peak time to come here, do, and enjoy and sorry for the cheese, but it must be said, ramen is a dish best served piping hot, no really, it loses it's luster if you eat too slowly and it cools down."},{"name":"Fox Bros.

They changed the tortillas, they used to have a really good puffy hot tortilla, now they use store bought which are tasteless than the ones they used to. Last note, the prices skyrocketed! the menu no longer list the prices, so that should show you right there that you're going to be paying more than normal. 2 breakfast tacos and a drink 2 years ago was only $4-$5! Now just a basic pot,egg/chz (2) and a small coffee rounds out to $8! Yikes! You can have lunch at Chipotle for less!

It looked good. In the past I've been burned by food in Portland that sounded like a good idea but then when I took it home it tasted like cardboard. That actually happens a lot here. I was really drawn to the FALAFEL Wrap with hummus, caramelized onions, roasted red peppers, grilled eggplant, parsley, falafel and salad greens covered with tahini sauce on a warm pita. However, I chickened out at the last moment because I didn't really want to spend $7 on cardboard that I have to throw out so I gave Wolf and Bear a simpler test by ordering the hummus bowl thinking that NOBODY can screw up hummus. \\n\\nWhat I got was a paper bowl full of hummus and a warmed up pita in foil for $5 which I took back to the car for my family. Disclaimer: we make hummus and pita in our house - lots of hummus and pita. I took a bite and was speechless. Unfortunately before I could recover from my lack of words my significant other popped a piece of pita in her mouth. Her face went sideways and she said \\"What the f*ck is this?\\". That was pretty much what was on my mind too. How in the world can you screw up something with only a couple of ingredients? Well, my friends, go to Portland and you'll see how. \\n\\nNot only was the texture quite bad but the flavor was way off. My significant other: Is that even chickpeas? Me: I think so but there's no flavor so it's hard to tell. Was there onions in it? Why is it bitter? What's with the texture? \\n\\nOn reflection I'm wondering if they didn't put tahini in it. Maybe they're worried that someone will be allergic to food so they left that part out. \\n\\nAnyway, I'm baffled. I'm sure I'll get lots of hate mail from the parallel universe of Portlandia but really amazing hummus is easy to make and they didn't even pull off mediocre hummus."},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"ok maybe this is on me.

I was very disappointed. I went only because of the ratings. When I went there it was too small tight space. My waitress was not great at customer hospitality. I had to ask for her to help me make room on the table which it was super small for everything. She did not offer by herself if we needed a bigger table when I had my child and toddler. The wait for the pizza was very long that my 18month was getting restless. When the pizza did come. For some reason my son did not want the pizza when his favorite thing to eat is pizza. The pizza did not look that pleasing but I was willing to give it a try since it was my first experience. Than I ask the waitress if there was anything they had in the menu that was for kids, that kids would typically like to eat. She than puts the menu in my face and tells me I don't know what your son likes to eat, you will have to look at the menu. Which was rude. So I just said French fries will be fine. When we got the French fries it had a long blonde hair on it and I am a brunette  I let the waitress know for her to only mention to me oh maybe it was in the ketchup. I said no it is on the French fry, this is my first experience here. And she said they can dump it and get us new ones. I did not want new fries base on my first experience here was so horrible. So they just took off the fries off my bill and that was it. They did not try to keep a customer. I usually tip very well but today I step out my norm and tip low cause I had a horrible experience. I was looking forward to taking my kids out to have a great time for some pizza. I made it up to them by buying some ice cream as a treat somewhere else. After this experience I was like I should of left when we only had our juice and just pay for the beverages and went somewhere else to eat. My first and last time ever!!! Very disappointed that I don't normally write reviews ever but I'm leaving one today. I was the only young person as a customer and Hispanic, so maybe that was one of the reasons?? It's just mind bottling to try to think why was everyone treated differently and I was treated like crap and I was the only one with children as well. Smh. Never again!! Reminds me of the movie pretty woman when she went in the store to buy clothes and they treated her like crap cause they thought she didn't have the income to buy those fancy dresses.

Well, HELL YES, but then you're looking at it wrong bc I didn't really 'wait' - I had a full-morning experience that was fun from beginning to end and is one of my favorite Texas memories.  I mean, when you show up early to a football game and hang out in the parking lot in lawn chairs drinking beer and shooting the shit with your neighbors... is THAT called waiting?  No, it's called tailgating and this is the exact same thing.  Get your mind off the whole \\"worth the wait\\" track and look at it for what it is:  an experience.  And a fantastic one, at that!   (Besides, If you're looking at the 'wait' as 3+ hours of misery, why not just order ahead and pick-up instead?)  But for me, the \\"wait\\" is half the fun... with some hella yummy food as the ultimate prize.\\n\\n-~-~-~-~-~-    THE EXPERIENCE  -~-~-~-~-~-  \\nWe got there at 8:00am on a Wednesday and were about #15 in \\"line\\".  There were plenty of chairs left at that point, and we got a nice spot in front of the building in the shade where we set up with our cooler and started mixing up some breakfast micheladas to get the party started.  For the next 2.5 hours or so we chatted and drank and hung out and had a blast.  We made some new friends and even exchanged some keep-in-touch deets.\\n\\nThey opened the doors to the restaurant around 9 or so to allow people to use the restroom, buy beers, and shop for swag and take-home bottles of sauce.  Sometime around 9:30ish a woman came around and went down the line taking our estimated orders...   Shortly after 10:30am we were told they were getting ready to open the doors so please start packing up....  we finished our beers then put chairs away and coolers in the car... and the actual waiting part began.   \\n\\nIt took about 15 minutes from them opening the door to us getting to the front of the line... during this time they had someone coming around and taking beer orders and bringing them out to ppl in line.  Gotta love those $4 Lone Stars!    \\n\\nWhen we got to the front of the line, we placed our order, then our meat was carved and weighed to order.   I like how for the brisket, they ask if you want fatty or lean.  (Fatty of course!)   Pay, and head out to find somewhere to sit.  Thanks to the \\"Don't sit until you have your food\\" signs, there seemed to be plenty of seating as people rotated through.\\n\\n-~-~-~-~-~-    THE FOOD   -~-~-~-~-~-  \\nThe brisket was the best I've ever had in my life.  It was juicy and tender and smokey and literally melted in my mouth.  SO GOOD. I realized that I'd never had proper BBQ before and had always been ignorant to what proper BBQ should be.   Now I know and now Franklin's is the barometer I will gauge any brisket against in the future.\\n\\nClose second was the turkey breast!  Shocked the hell out of me, I didn't even want to order the stupid turkey but my friend insisted.  It was delicious and moist, and everything that I never knew turkey could be.  Lesson learned - I've apparently been eating the wrong turkey all my life as well.  (Unless my mom is reading, in which case:  Except yours, Mom!)\\n\\nThe other three meats we tried (Pulled Pork, Ribs, and Sausage) were also delicious but really I only had eyes for brisket (and the sneak attack from the turkey).\\n\\nBeing my first Texas BBQ experience, I kept eyeballing that wonder bread on the tray wondering \\"WTF is that all about...Texans are so weird!\\" until we'd put a big enough dent in Mt. Meat to reveal a puddle of juices... *LIGHTBULB!*  it was perfect for mopping up all the juices and crumbled bits. (Figured that out myself, I did!) Mmmm....\\n\\n=^.,.^=  PURRRO-TIP!  =^.,.^=    If your'e traveling, hold onto that extra wonder bread and pack it up with your leftover meats... because it makes great snacky sandwiches to grab out of the hotel fridge and NOM NOM NOM. \\n\\nThere were also three sauces on the table - they were decent/passable, but none of them were my favorite ever  - but that's okay because honestly the meat did NOT need it.  Seriously - the meat was perfection by itself and i wouldn't have wanted sauce on it even if it WAS the best ever. I did like the Espresso Sauce by itself enough to buy a bottle to take home... and I've made some awesome chicken thighs with it.\\n\\nOther condiments included pickles (nice pallet cleanser), raw onion (went great when eaten with some of the fattier meats to help cut the fattiness), and jalapenos (gotta have my heat, baby!).  There were some sides but I didn't bother with any of them, because:  MEAT.\\n(We did get a bourbon banana pie that we didn't touch, but that was great at 3am after clubbing!)\\n\\n -~-~-   THE VERDICT (TL;DR SUMMARY)  -~-~-\\n- Awesome BBQ - Best Brisket EVAR.\\n- Sauce is ehhh but not needed.\\n- Super fun tailgating experience.\\n- If you're looking for a quick bite, go elsewhere."},{"name":"Tsim Chai Noodle Restaurant","address":"8251 Westminster Highway, Suite 50","city":"Richmond","stars":"3.5","text":"I think this is my favorite noodle place.

The only implement I used to eat my braised pork shoulder was the accompanying spoon, a testament to the fall-apart tender meat that peeled gently away, landing in the waiting arms of a glorious molasses-based sauce and hammy beans. The collards are waiting for you in a bath of broth that makes them tender and oh-so-tasty. The cornbread seems too savory, until you add the sweet cream butter to top the whole confection.

Music is great to vibe to and people are considerate despite how enthused the atmosphere becomes. Food is a bit pricey but somewhat reasonably priced for the taste. The seafood pancake tastes incredibly crisp, fresh, and light and the soy garlic chicken is comparable to the best Boston has to offer and would recommend it to anyone, though the spicy flavor is a tad high on the meter for my pallet.

First time here tonight and it was KICK-A, as in AWESOME.\\n\\nI've been super disappointed in the Chinese scene since moving to Not'lanta. I'd probably be more daring on Buford Highway but way too many restaurants score way too low on the health department inspections. Cafe 101 rated a 91 just 5 months ago so that opened the door. Suggest you kick that door down and get read to get your Chinese on!\\n\\nFirst, when you order an appetizer, they'll ask if you want your food to come out as its ready (translated: appetizers not necessarily first) or not. Nice touch. We ordered pot stickers. They were pan fried but seemed more like they were grilled. The noodles were firm on one side and tender on the others. The pork filling was right on.\\n\\nWe ordered Chicken Basil and it was amazing. There were tons of fresh basil leaves, cooked, in the dish, plus chunks of garlic and fresh ginger. The only possible downside to this dish is that it comes out sizzling and we smelled like sizzling chicken when we left the restaurant.\\n\\nWe also ordered Tangerine Beef. To me, Tangerine Beef seems like a super Americanized dish. It's not as bad as \\"Sweet'n Sour Chicken,\\" aka, chicken fingers with pungent sauce on it, but before trying Cafe 101's, I would have sheepishly admitted that I love it. Guess what? At Cafe 101, the beef must be paper thin and the coating and cooking is downright delicate! Bite into this stuff and it's like buttuh!\\n\\nCafe 101's fried rice was good if you prefer it on the natural side. Don't go expecting it to be the color of some dark brown Crayola. It's white rice, lightly fried, so it's much closer to it's natural white color. It tasted great and I didn't feel like i had put brown dye #7 in my body.\\n\\nMore of a miss was the Garlic Chicken.

Around this time I cashed in on my free high-five for doing a check-in while I was there. (Bonus points) The food took a little bit to come out, but I was super excited, so whatever. The burger was glorious. Two sexy donut rings with carmelized onions, beef, and cheese squished between. There was also a house sauce which added the most delicate touch of ILOVETHIS to what was already an amazing burger. I especially like that the burger came with pickles(which I hate) but the pickles were perched on a toothpick stabbed through the center hole of the donut, which means YAY NO PICKLEJUICE ON MY BURGER!\\n\\nI have no complaints about the burger. I do however have a complaint about the french fries. If ordered the sweet potato french fries, but as soon as they were brought out, I was disappointed. The fries were wilted, and good few of them looked undone. I shoved them in my mouth anyway, because they were the only things standing between me and my donut burger ( and I wasn't prepared to wait around for another half an hour just for fries).

Also, the kitchen messed up such a simple pizza. It arrived with no pecorino or basil pesto, two of the main ingredients. They took it back and drizzled some pesto on top and added a microscopic amount of pecorino. I had to get very close to the pizza to see any specks of pecorino. The menu implies the pizza has a basil pesto base and only notes \\"fresh tomatoes\\", not a thick Pizza Hut style tomato sauce.

Now, I don't hate karaoke, it's ok in a bar or of course at Outback Saloon, but Applebees?

She continued to argue with my friend who was attempting to put our name down. We told her a party of 9. She tells us she can't put us on the list unless we're all here. What kinda bs is that?! They argue some more back and fourth and she finally puts us down. She quotes us an hour and that's fine. We ARE ALL SERVERS as well and understand wait time on holidays. We go to wait for 10 minutes. She rings us up as if our table was ready. She literally texts us \\"your table is ready\\". All NINE of us walk up and she tells us oh it's not ready it was to make sure your party is here. I'm not sure if that's a thing but I don't recall restaurants ringing up parties telling them their table is ready and then saying it's not. That'll just make angry customers.

It really is that hot outside. \\n2 Bring some cash for drinks in line. Don't worry abut having a beer before noon. Its a college town so chances are it is happening somewhere else so get over it. The other  thing is that you are going to sweat it out before you even order so it doesn't count. \\n3 Bring something to read or make an effort to befriend the strangers around you. I recommend the latter since (a) it's Austin and that is the way it is here (b) you already have something in common having made the decision to spend the next two hours in line for BBQ - face it you are kindred spirits. (c) the people you meet are going to be more interesting than anything you brought to read \\nOk - suggested topics of conversation: \\nA. \\"Wow, it really is hot out here.\\" (lamest suggestion since it's the most obvious) \\nB. Everyone wants to compare their \\"How I first heard about this place.\\" story. My tip is that the entire world has seen the magazine and other stories about the place, so get creative. I.e. \\"I had a vision while walking through the Whole Foods beer locker and it led me here.\\" Or try \\"I used to park their trailer and have been coming here since it first opened.\\" This last one - how long you've known about this place - is pretty competitive. But, since it is Austin, feel free to make up your own facts because no one is going to check all that closely.\\nC - Share stories of all the other BBQ places you've been to that don't match up with Franklin. Extra points if you can avoid references to the Salt Lick.\\nD: Swap estimates of how long it will be before success changes the \\nplace.

All you Austin locals will feel my pain here, but recent flooding prompted a boil notice and so most restaurants are either closed or handing you lukewarm bottled water. Well the boil notice was lifted so naturally I though asking for a nice icy Dr Pepper was reasonable.  So when the little girl asked me if she could put it over ice for me, I have to admit I felt a little pampered. Then out came my breakfast croissant (lLet me also admit that I rarely eat fast food, but I was desperate today, no offense Jack-in-the-Box.) and it was cheesy sausage egg perfection.  It was so fresh steam is coming off the side of it and cheese was melted down the other side. I'm telling you, it was a winner.

In fact, it seemed each ramen bowl had different amount of noodle and wasn't consistent.  Tatsu-ya's was more consistent, and even kaedama tasted really good!\\n\\nMichi had a lot more appetizers.\\n\\nAlso, it seems Tatsu-ya is more organized in terms of running their business and serving the customers.  They have their own system which seems working really well.\\n\\nI do not like to wait in line at all, but I will definitely go back there again!\\n\\nI wish Tatsu-ya will open for lunch soon!!!  \\n(I rather eat high calorie food at lunch instead of at night!)"},{"name":"The Pie College Park","address":"2429 Edgewater Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"We live in College Park and were very happy to see The Pie Orlando open, as pizza choices in the neighborhood aren't very good. (Both Ragazzi's and NYPD Pizza are terrible, so we usually resort to Pizza Hut.) My wife and I went for lunch two days ago for our first visit and were greatly disappointed. As this was lunch, we only needed a slice or two or an add-on. The slices that were available at 3:30 PM, during their lunch special time period, were limited There was a total of 10 slices laid out amongst 8 varieties. A couple were blown out. Aside from Margherita, there was only one slice available of the others. No pizzas were being cooked (to replenish the stock) in the oven, which you can see from the slice counter.\\n\\nA slice is $4 and there were a few lunch specials, including 2 slices and a beverage or 1 slice and a salad. As there was only slice with any meat on it, I opted for the sole \\"meatlover\\" slice and a garlic knot. My wife ordered the sole \\"mushroom alfredo,\\" which is not on their slice menu on the web site. This is a \\"casual service restaurant.\\" You order at the counter and are then fully waited on at the table. We figured this out as we got shooed away from the soda fountain machine while we were just looking around.\\n\\nOur food and drinks arrived promptly on the patio and the gentleman promptly brought napkins cutlery and, when asked, pepper flakes and parmesan. The crust they have created and baked in their wood-fired oven is amazing. It literally ranks at the top of my list outside NYC. The garlic knot, available for $1 each of cheaper for multiples, was divine - fresh, doughy and with plenty of garlic on top. My wife's mushroom alfredo slice tasted yummy - the mushrooms were flavorful and fresh. My meatlover slice had a heaping amount of meat, but there was one thing missing: sauce. My slice was *bone dry.* There wasn't any sauce on it whatsoever. When the gentleman asked how it was, I stated that it was great but needed tomato sauce. He brought me some extra, as I already one cup for my garlic knot. The sauce is divine, so why on earth they don't put any on the pizza is a mystery. To me, sauce is the most important ingredient for pizza, followed by the crust and then the toppings. I used my fork and covered the top of my pizza with sauce and the meal was a little more enjoyable, but I won't order a slice here again. I probably won't order a full pie either, as I won't trust them to adequately put sauce on the pizza even if I request \\"extra sauce.\\""},{"name":"Foster Burger","address":"5339 Se Foster Rd","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Best veggie patty in town.

What you may not know about this Yelper! is I'm always on the search for the perfect burger and I'm not talking about fast food, although In 'n Out Burger is pretty good, but it is the hand-crafted, dedicated artistry of hamburger excellence I'm talking about like Foster Burger in Portland, Oregon. Quaint, urban, rustic Foster Burger has a full bar (what!) and uses all natural, hormone-free ground beef served on a bun made by a neighboring bakery called Xuyen Bakery. Foster Burger has the typical list of burgers with add-ons as long as your arm, very cool! But it's the specialty burgers that will rock your world like the Kimcheese Burger built with the Foster burger, kimchee, bacon, American and pepper Jack cheese, sriracha mayo and shredded lettuce. Incredible! I have also had The Burner. Very Nice!\\n\\nBut let's talk about the second star of the Foster Burger menu line up, which is the poutine, and you may be thinking \\"what is poutine?\\" Well, you have to start with its inception, the birth place of poutine, so I'll try to give you some back ground into the French fries, cheese curd, gravy goodness. Poutine is a French-Canadian food invented in Warwick, Quebec in 1957 and still produces cheese curds that ship all over Canada. Poutine is pronounced by the French as [pu-tin] like you would the president of Russia, the French Canadians pronounce it [put-sin]. There is a website called Portlandpoutine.com that lists the restaurants in Portland, Oregon that serve poutine - hilarious!  There is also a board game called Miss Poutine. Wow! OK! Enough of the background. Foster's uses Beecher's cheese curds made in Seattle, Washington and homemade brown gravy with onions. Perfect! Thank you Foster Burger for great grub and being a great part of my culinary community.\\n\\nP.S. There are poutine festivals every year in Quebec and Vancouver, BC that are recipe contests and all you can eat. Who would have thought."},{"name":"Se7en Bites","address":"617 N Primrose Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Wonderful experience! Everything is delicious!

My friend who was there with me had the same opinion, we both decided we will be back to order 1lb of ribs each in the future. The briskets were amazing, no need for barbecue sauce at all, so tender and juicy, great flavor, can't get any better than that. The sausage is also top notch, a little bit spicy, not too fatty, perfect. The pork and the turkey were not up to the same standads though, I've had better elsewhere. The ribs and brisket are definitely the best bbq I have ever eaten! Totally worth the hype, if only they would have more meat so we wouldn't have to wait so long..."},{"name":"Taco Cabana","address":"12525 N Mopac Expwy","city":"Austin","stars":"2","text":"Staff is always so rude that by the time you finish ordering you feel like you should apologize for taking up the cashiers precious time.

Being seated was a joke, as there was no clear line or hostess to greet us, and the \\"Wait to be seated\\" sign was facing the people who were....already seated and eating. A waiter walks by us mumbling obscenities under his breath, then a waitress ends up noticing us. We sit down and the table is filthy and sticky, the salt shaker has some type of mystery crud stuck on the top of it, the floor under our table had smooshed french fries stuck in it, and the menu was dirty and in 5 pieces...not on purpose, but because it was falling apart. The menu was confusing (it didn't show a list of sides) and overpriced. I ordered the 14oz Sirloin Steak for $20, Well Done. It came with a salad, which was actually decent, and \\"mashed potatoes\\". I use the term \\"mashed\\" loosely, as in reality the potatoes were bland liquid mush. Literally not one atom of seasoning on either the steak or the potatoes. The steak was not tenderized, marinated, or seasoned AT ALL. You could tell they took a steak out of the package and just slapped it on the grill. It was disgusting, fatty, gristly, and not worth $9, let alone the $20 that I paid. I couldn't hear myself think, and had to yell with my girlfriend just to have a conversation with her. She ordered the Seafood Alfredo dish, which came with lobster, scallops, and shrimp.

The smell was amazing.  Most of the flavors were unique and all homemade in small batches and the young lady working was pleased to let us try a couple of samples and answer any questions we had. I went with a scoop of their chocolate ube and a scoop of pandan ( best described as fragrant plant used for cooking in many Thai and Southeast-Asian dishes). Incorporated into ice cream, it was described to me as a taste similar to an almond joy. I had a sample and was sold.  In conversation, I told her that I had read they offered ube flavored ice cream as well and she was kind enough to pull a small batch out from the freezer behind her. Since she had already made my order, it was too late to change it, but she was gracious enough to offer me a sample. It was perfection! Super sweet and hit the spot.

They were all (not good for you) but delicious.  If you are a fan of onion rings, you will love Dirty Frank's onion rings.  My fav were the tater tots, they are done to a crisp, golden brown perfection.  The crunch is perfect and they are hot and tasty on the inside.  Ian, our bartender was phenomenal!  He was quick to serve our delicious draft beer.  I went with the Boulder Chocolate Shake Porter for a well priced $5 a pint.  His hot dog suggestion was the Chicago dog and I stepped outside my box and said yes to it.  I was not disappointed.

Of course I was going here, prepared to endure the 3 hour wait with bottle of water in hand and a thorough application of sunblock.\\n\\nI decided to stop by Franklin Barbecue on a Thurs since the day before I showed up at 11AM and was about 15 people past the \\"Last Man Standing\\" for that day. That person is guaranteed food for the day. Everyone after that person is a gamble for food, you may get some and you may not.\\n\\nThis time I showed up at 10AM and was actually THE \\"Last Man Standing\\", only after the group in front of me decided to bail and head off to another BBQ joint. I was GUARANTEED food and was extremely joyful about it. But before that happened, the 3 hour test of will would have to dissipate. \\n\\nOddly the time did pass by rather quickly, only because people are so friendly and open around these parts. Employees would come around selling cold drinks, updating us on wait times, and what meats would start to run out.\\n\\nOnce I got to the front of the line, famished almost on the verge of passing out,  with a darker tan, I scoured the menu above the cutting station. Unfortunately in a few hours, I'd have to leave my favorite city of Austin to go back to California. So ordering several pounds of meat was out of the question. The decision would have to be the brisket and rib plate with 2 sides (potato salad and pinto beans were my choice) and, just for the hell of it, a link of sausage.\\n\\nGrabbing a seat, I prepared to finally enjoy what I had waited so long for. And I was impressed. Deeply WOW-ed. The brisket dissolved in my mouth. Seriously it did. The pork ribs just melted as you bit into them. Best ribs, bar none. The sausage had a beautiful balance of meatiness, spice, fat, and a firm snap as I bit into it. Potato salad was creamy and chunky. Pinto beans were smoky and had some heat to them.\\n\\nThe verdict is it's the best barbecue I've EVER had. Aaron Franklin deserves all the praise and accolades he has received.

Well, cool until 10 minutes later when the manager (owner - not sure) came over and told us that the table was indeed reserved, and we needed to move. Boo!

Our waitress was the worst. My wife and I arrived slightly late to our dinner date with friends. They had already ordered beverages and pizza. The waitress came to take our drink order - water and a coke - and then asked if we wanted to order food. We established (I thought) that we would be sharing the large pizza with the rest of the group. She came back with our drinks. I took a sip of mine after she walked away and discovered it was root beer. When she came back I asked politely if I could have a coke instead. Another person at our table had ordered root beer. Instead of taking the root beer away, since I had already drank some (that's how I knew it was root beer) she expected me to....give it to another member of our party who HAD ordered root beer. Then when the pizza arrived she didn't bring any plates for my wife and I, and looked confused when we again explained that we would be sharing the pizza. So finally we all get one slice out of this thing. It wasn't hot but I figured what are we going to do. Also she completely ruined one of the slices while cutting it - and laughed it off. Then the waitress comes back fifteen minutes later and explains that they gave out large pizza to somebody else and this is a medium - but \\"You'll be paying less!\\" She didn't offer to correct the mistake until we had all eaten, then she said the cook would make us another, small pizza. The pizza takes an hour to cook so obviously we declined, as we'd already been there an hour and a half. Immediately after leaving I felt sick to my stomach, probably because the pizza wasn't cooked all the way through.

Excellent customer service there considering we only made one request out of 5 sides and several apps.\\n\\nThe apps were ok: bite size cucumber tea sandwiches and kale salad. Portion of kale salad was very generous and we all liked the salad more than the sandwiches.\\n\\nThe waitress raved about the pork chops so two members of our party ordered them for entrees even though there was a $5 up charge. They were then served pork loin (NOT pork chops. Please see picture.). What kind of establishment does this? \\n\\nWhen we complained to our waitress, she was like \\"Oh yeah. Forgot to tell you. Even though the menu says pork chops, tonight we have pork loin.\\" WHAT?? After you told us how much you LOVED the pork chops? You then serve us pork loin? What is wrong with you? Honestly, she seemed super scared of the kitchen which makes me wonder what kind of work environment is back there. No apology for recommending pork chops but serving bland pork loin instead. Had she been upfront with us, we wouldn't have ordered pork loin!\\n\\nThe other 3 members of the party (myself included) got the fried chicken. It was good but nothing to write home about. There are several restaurants in Atlanta with superior fried chicken.. buttermilk kitchen for example.\\n\\nOf course we got 5 sides and none of them were the Mac and cheese we requested. Is one request out of 7 dishes (5 sides and 2 apps) too much to ask? \\n\\nWe tried several different desserts and they were all underwhelming including the apple turnover served with a huge scoop of whipped cream (ice cream would've been a better choice), peanut butter pie, and lemon pie. Honestly the best part of this meal was the bread pudding I ordered. It was simply phenomenal. \\n\\nIf I ever give this restaurant another chance, I will not order off the family style menu. I will instead pick my appetizers, double check that the entree I want is actually what will be served, and order myself a Mac and cheese.\\n\\nI have never had such poor customer service at an upscale restaurant before.\\n\\nI will say that the ambience is very homey and makes you feel like you are in an old southern home. It was very cute. One of the reasons I gave it 3 stars.\\n\\nStill wondering if I should try gunshow after all this..."},{"name":"Stubb's Bar-B-Q","address":"801 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"We got VIP tickets for a show my boyfriend wanted to see.

This place is frequently touted as an Atlanta institution, but I guess that isn't surprising considering that the Varsity shares the same dubious distinction. If you're amenable to mediocre food and caustic service in a borderline condemnable environment, then this place is certainly worth your while. \\n\\nFood: Over-cooked and under-good. During my visit, I ordered the combo, which consisted of a 1/4 chicken and a 1/2 slab of ribs. Although the barbeque sauce served on the side had a nice kick to it, the chicken and ribs were both scorched to oblivion. I also opted for a side of mac n' cheese, which was congealed, ice cold, and an insult to its namesake. Even the two pieces of bread that accompanied the combo were a chewy, flavorless disappointment. \\n\\nService: Over-crude and under-friendly. I'm completely disillusioned with the \\"service with a grudge\\" mentality that has  become increasingly commonplace and acceptable in many Atlanta restaurants, including Fat Matt's. It's called the \\"hospitality business\\" for a reason; unless the occasional problem customer justifies you to act otherwise, being hospitable should be the norm.\\n\\nAtmosphere: Over-cramped and under-welcoming. Although I appreciate that they feature live blues bands, I did not appreciate the management's reluctance to regulate the performers. During my visit, the performer's cronies were peddling her CD and forcibly soliciting tips. It's one thing to have a tip jar at the front of the stage, but to persistently demand tips from each table is awkward and unacceptable.    \\n\\nCost: Over-priced and under-sold. Meat alone costs $10, while fountain drinks and each additional side are $2 each. You can definitely obtain barbeque of superior quality and quantity elsewhere in the city for lower cost.\\n\\nOther: The handful of reviewers who have suggested that parking is not a problem are completely delusional.

We were drawn in by the large printed menu on the exterior of the building. \\"Truffle fries...$2.75\\". My wife and I really dig truffle fries. \\n\\nSo we enter this \\"fast casual\\" food joint and they have the same simple menu inside as is painted outside their walls. We're really just hungry enough for fries, so my wife steps up to the counter first to order. We are a party of 3, accompanied by our friend who is vegan, and who has good reason to be, she becomes violently ill when in contact with any dairy. So my wife asks, \\"are your truffle fries vegan friendly?\\" Because, as we have enjoyed many times, truffle fries can be garnished with shaved Parmesan, or tossed butter with truffle powder instead of oil. The cashier gave a blank stare and replied, \\"I think so,\\" and in the tone of a rude, condescending know-it-all, \\"I mean, they're just potatoes.\\" She was further rude and condescending when my wife asked for a small drink, and received the reply, \\"Those aren't small drink cups, they're just for water.\\" My wife tried to be helpful and when asked if her order was complete, she added that her order was \\"to-go\\" and the cashier once again let my wife know as if it were totally obvious that \\"it's all to-go.\\" \\n\\nBeyond the condescending service from the cashier, we all received our fries, which by default comes with some sort of sauce we guessed was not vegan friendly but you can sub out for plain ketchup. My fries felt over-cooked, and really barely tasted like they had truffle oil on them or salt. The sauce that's included was tangy and a little spicy, not really anything special though. I felt like this wasn't desirable to dip my fries in at first, because it covered what little truffle flavor I was gathering from the fries, but ultimately became useful when I grew tired of the overcooked, bland flavor of the fry."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"The BEST BBQ I've ever had.

So, I thought, well ok, and went to the bar where I waited for some time before anyone showed up. I was beginning to think that this has all the hallmarks of a bad experience. But I was determined to play it out. I am glad I did. Once everyone got their heads around us being outside and who should keep on eye on us, things turned decidedly for the better. We had a fantastic meal of 2 appetizers (fresh bean salad and blue cheese croquettes) and mussels mariniere.

Let us begin with the atmosphere: walking into this place one is immediately struck by two things, ie. the pleasing and inviting interior, and the refreshing (for cold, mute, humorless Washington) professionalism and warmth of the staff. The bar is a clever explosion of color shaped from various liquor bottles. We were seated at a table overlooking the Columbia River where our drink and appetizer order was taken quickly and executed flawlessly (not that iced tea, a lemon drop cocktail, and old standby crab & artichoke dip is a El Bulli worthy order, but it was a nice indicator). The crabichoke dip was unprecedented in that it actually tasted... like crab! Drinks were also quietly perfect. We decided to split the black and blue coulotte steak (top sirloin to us Anglophones).

The chef certainly knows how to make sauces (mole was amazing) and herbed butters, but all the courses had major flaws.  Our meal was started off with burnt cornbread that was dry and cold.  Certainly something that was made many hours before, and should have been thrown out; never served to customers.  I chose the pork chop with chorizo, and my girlfriend chose the blackened tuna steak.  The pork chop was ok, a bit overdone, but not worth complaining about.  The chorizo was served in a cornbread crust, and was absolutely terrible.  The chorizo tasted like ground up hot dog, and this part of the dish was prepared around the same time as the initial cornbread.  It was very obvious it was heated up, not made fresh. \\n\\nThe tuna steak was poorly prepared, where it was lightly blackened around the edges, and completely raw in the middle.  Not very appetizing, as most of the dish was inedible.  For dessert I had dark chocolate tacos.  They were bland, and the dark chocolate sauce didn't taste very high quality.

I'd had a hearty breakfast but the tale took it's toll and I soon found myself ruminating about the outposts of burgerdom.  Hmm, Five Guys, Killer Burger, Little Big Burger, Stanich's; then one I've heard about but hadn't tried jumped to the fore: Foster Burger.  So I set sail, sipping water all the way to prepare my system for the salty, beef tallow seasoned onslaught.  I parked outfront and entered, noting a daylight anteroom and a surprising \\"Wait to Be Seated\\" sign at the entrance to the back which appeared to be your average neighborhood bar.  I was escorted in and selected a short end of the bar stool that allowed me a good vantage point to observe the three person front of the house staff.  I perused the menu, debating whether to have a fine microbrew or a cup of the house joe.  I settled on the coffee which arrived in the form of a cup and saucer, small spoon and french press.  No wonder it took five minutes to arrive!  I selected the Foster Burger, eschewed the fries (swimsuit season) and gambled on the Cole Slaw.  I ordered the FB with Roasted Jalapeno which I was told would come on the side as everything came on the side.  Good, I thought, I like to control the heat intake so that will work.  The package arrived via the hardworking bearded bartender who obviously took pride in the delivery.  It looked fabulous though I've always been against delivering a hamburger in pieces.  Too much heat loss from the patty, you know?  And hotel restaurants are famous for delivering a splayed out presentation that, once assembled, is a cold sandwich.  Hate that.  Had a \\"Western Cookout\\" burger at a restaurant chain's annual convention once and after assembling the mess, the patty of which was the only hot item, there it was, a cold sandwich.  Anyway, I put the Foster Burger together and what's this?  The jalapenos were on the patty, not on the side.  Oh well, I left them there and hefted the hammy and took a chomp.  I had already dressed the thing with the Foster Sauce and you know what?  The first bite was a revelation.  As was the second and all the way through.  FB's not afraid to season the patty, thank you for that.  I would eat the jalapenos on the side next time but no matter, they could not hide the fact that this is one of Portland's finest hamburgers.  Not the biggest, not the gaudiest, just one of the best.  And guess what?  The Cole Slaw rocked.  The ph of the dressing was just right and the sweetness factor perfect.  I'm tired of leaving half the slaw because it's too sweet, too sour, too something.  This was excellent and left me wanting more.  Next time the French Fries, though, as the scent in the air at FB was comforting and enticing."},{"name":"Fox Bros.

Yeah, that I had to try.\\n\\nOf course I got one of the crawfish dishes since that's what they're known for. I got the Spicy Chilled Crawfish and it was probably my favorite dish of the night.

Our waiter was also nice enough to show a step by step how how to eat a crawfish properly.\\n\\nAs the main dishes, we got the Rockfish Lafitte and Jakes' Etoufee. The Rockfish Lafitte was pretty good. I felt the crab meat on top was a tad salty and the fish was kind of bland minus the salt. It also came with asparagus and mashed potatoes which were okay. Nothing amazing about those.\\n\\nAnd Jakes' Etoufee - usually one of my favorite dishes at cajun/creole restaurants, but I thought it was just okay. They give you a little bit of rice and a ton of sauce, which usually works for me, but the ratio of rice to sauce was just really off. The sauce had a generous amount of crawfish tails and chicken and shrimp, but I felt like the shrimp could have been fresher considering they're a top seafood restaurant.

The line here wraps down the street and around the block. When they get closer to the 11am open time, someone will go down the line getting an estimate of how much meat people are going to order. After they do their order estimation they will inform everyone behind a certain point that they aren't guaranteed any bbq. They only make about 1,800 lbs of bbq a day and only stay open until they are sold out. \\n\\nKnowing what we learned the day before, we showed up (with chairs and blankets in hand) the next day at just before 6am and were the second people in line. People will definitely call you crazy for waiting several hours just to get some bbq...it was definitely well worth the wait! I can honestly say this is the best bbq I've had in Texas! \\n\\nEveryone was so nice when we first walked in, knowing that we had been waiting outside in the cold for hours. They greeted us as we walked in and even gave us a sample of the brisket as they were slicing everything up for us. Good brisket isn't cheap and cheap brisket isn't usually very good. That being said, I ended up ordering 3 pounds of moist brisket ($22/pound) with burnt ends. I figured I could eat some there and bring the rest home in a cooler. I also got some pork ribs, sausage, potato salad and coleslaw. In my experience a lot of places either have good bbq or good sides, not both, but Aaron Fanklin managed to get both the meat and sides right. \\n\\nA few tips if you're planning to come here:\\n* Bring a chair if you don't want to stand or sit on the ground\\n* Preorder if you can to skip the line!

In my gut 3 stars means 'average' but 'a-ok'(yelp's definitin of 3 stars) means 'A-OK' and in my vernacular 'A-OK' means I had no issues.  But I did.  I have been to this location 6 times across 6 years.  I love a good steak and, independently, I love a good steakhouse.  My first 2 Ruth's experiences were at the Portland, OR location and I could say now that they were solid 4 star experiences based on what I had experienced to that point.  Prime steak was hard to find in those days.  Not so much anymore.  My experience was 2 stars and this is why.\\n\\n1. We were a party of 2 and were taken to a 4 top.  No problem, just clear the two additional place settings.  They did, but not until after the appetizers were ordered, delivered, and eaten.\\n\\n2.  Bring me the wine list.  I ordered an $80 bottle of champagne.  Though my wife's menu was taken, my menu and the winelist sat on the table, in plain sight, from the time we ordered the champagne until sometime after we left.  Could you have taken them?\\n\\n3.  When the champagne was presented, the waitress couldn't get it open.  It had to go through three staff members before the bottle was opened.  Opening ANY bottle of champagne is not a challenge if you have been instructed in the process.  Hole the cork and twist the bottle, not the other way around.\\n\\n4.  When the champagne was poured, the waitress filled the glasses to 80%+ of volume....epic fail.  The flute is designed to focus the bouquet of the champagne with the fill level somewhere around 50% full.  I know management wants to push wine sales but I refuse to stand by idle when it happens.  I corrected once and it never happened again, but it shouldn't have happened, period.\\n\\n5.  The seared ahi and shrimp cocktail appetizers were very good.  However, having worked in restaurants years ago when I was young, you really have to have a closed head injury to screw these plates up to the point where they are bad.  None the less, we enjoyed both of them.\\n\\n6.  The wedge salad was fine, but ther ewas not enough dressing (1000 island) and what was there was bland.  My wife's house salad was well enjoyed.\\n\\n7.  My wife ordered shrimp and filet and I ordered the cowboy ribeye.  They brought the wrong order.  My wifes' plate seemed accurate but my ribeye was sans bone when it came....I pointed this out...the server wanted to verify against her order sheet instead of my word as if I were fibbing....the order sheet bore me out.  Food was taken away and then brought back and was correct.\\n\\n8.  My $40 plus steak was not worth the price.  The sizzling hot plate swimming in butter is a nice gimmick, but when the steak cools down enough to be eaten it is cooked to the next level above what you ordered.  Prime steak should be well marbled but that does not mean it should have huge chunks of excess fat.  Beef sides/cuts like this (even at the prime level) should be quality controlled out of the equation.  My cowboy ribeye was almost 30% solid chunks of fat.  The beef that was preset was very tasty.  My wife's filet and shrimp met her expectations very well.\\n\\nWe had nothing after the entrees and the service was very pleasant and competent.\\n\\nHere is what I would like to see.\\n\\n1.  Good service is not enough at these prices.  You need excellent, professional service.  A good steak house will retain wait staff that stay for the duration.  Not happening here.  At a top house, like the Ringside in Portland, OR you can find staff that have been there for 30 years.  They are so good at what they do that they make a fine living by staying.\\n\\n2.  Wet aged prime beef may have been the sh*t 20 years ago when Ruth's expanded substantially, but it just doesn't cut it anymore.  Dry aged USDA prime, or Kobe, or good US Wagyu beef is the name of the game, and DRY AGED.  Charge more, but make it worth the visit.  Make me wish I was independently wealthy and could come every night.  \\n\\n3.  Train your staff to pour wine and champagne.  If you tell your staff to keep filling glasses to try and sell an extra bottle of wine, or allow then to do so on their own, then you have lost my business.  As for champagne, when I shell out for a bottle, make sure I enjoyt it.\\n\\n4.  Lose the nuclear hot plates swimming in butter.  Yes, a comment worthy experience the first time, but if you have cooked my steak the way I want, the gimmick will leave it over cooked when it hits my mouth.\\n\\n5.  Keep the salt and pepper only seasoning and pull back to tossing a patty of butter on top of the steak when it comes ( at diner's discretion ) Butter goes well with beef, but too much is too much.\\n\\nI neither hate, nor dislike Ruth's.  I will try it again.  I think the economy over the last two years have been hard on this location and the staff there.  I think the location, the staff, and the chain can improve with a logical approach to the future."},{"name":"The Hideaway Bar","address":"516 Virginia Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"what a dive bar ought to be.

Bar-B-Q","address":"1238 Dekalb Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"I'd rate it at three-and-a-half stars if I could, but I'm not going to round up.  It's fine, but it doesn't satisfy me like some other (IMHO better) BBQ establishments in the area do.  Let's start out with What They Get Right:\\n\\n1.  The Brunswick Stew.  It may well be the best I've ever eaten, bar none.  It certainly is delicious, and requires no apologies.  Very well done.  A-grade, here.\\n\\n2.  The pulled pork.  Another fine example of this baseline BBQ meat.  Nothing to hang their heads about here, either.\\n\\n3.  Dessert.  We had a chocolate/pecan pie that could have been served completely without the crust...actually, *should have* been served without the crust, as it would have been better that way.  The filling was absolutely delicious.\\n\\n4.  Service.  Great job by the staff, especially our eventual table server.  She was very informative, and knew how to craft an upsell in the very best way.  We both liked her a lot.\\n\\nNow let's move on to Things That Are Average:\\n\\n1.  Their pork ribs.  Nothing wrong with them, but I prefer mine sauced and a bit more tender.  Still:  they were eaten.\\n\\n2.  Their chicken.  Definitely had better smoked chicken elsewhere, but this wasn't bad, either.\\n\\n3.  Their brisket:  WARNING!!!!!!!  My opinion on this item does not mesh with my dining companion's, who believes that it could be the finest BBQ brisket he's ever eaten.  It didn't do Thing One for me, at all.  I tried two bites, and let him have the rest.  Couldn't have cared less about it.  I'm putting it in the Average category because between his rave review, and my \\"meh\\" review, it's an average thing, I suppose.\\n\\n4.  Their sauces.  Not great, not bad, but nothing to make you stand up and take notice.  The chicken sauce was especially weird.\\n\\nThe Not-So-Great:\\n\\n1.  The parking.  Yeah...the less said, the better.  If you can park, you're a lucky duck, buck-o.\\n\\n2.  The coleslaw.  Uninspired enough to end up sending it back and asking for it to be replaced with more Brunswick Stew, which was graciously honored.  The slaw itself, though?  Very forgettable.  So much better available.\\n\\nOverall, it wasn't the end-all-be-all kind of place I'd heard that it was, though they seem to think pretty highly of themselves ($25 for a t-shirt?  Really?  Was there a concert earlier that I missed?).  It's not bad, and I'm not trying to steer people clear of it or anything...but it certainly  didn't make me desire to return, and I most definitely went to Southern Pit the next day for the better overall experience/food.  Southern Pit is less expensive, too, though they have no bar, which Fox Bros. does.  Oh, that should be mentioned:  my dining companion enjoyed his bourbon and Cokes.  Both of them.  So if that's an important part of BBQ for you, they have the booze.\\n\\nA-OK sounds right to me, or maybe a half-step higher.  Obviously, taste is subjective, and my own personal taste/desire tints what I consider to be \\"good\\" or \\"bad\\" versions of certain dishes/parts of dishes.  However, overall, there are just other places I'd rather go.\\n\\nYour mileage may vary."},{"name":"Wrights Gourmet Sandwich Shoppe","address":"5482 Chamblee Dunwoody Rd","city":"Dunwoody","stars":"4","text":"I go out of my way and drive to Wright's Gourmet when craving a Tuna sandwich!

The salad bar had some nice choices and everything tasted fresh. Our server Will was absolutely outstanding.  Will was on top of every detail from beginning to end and his timing for checking in on us during our dining experience was impeccable. We asked for medium to medium rare cuts of meat and we were accommodated for each meat they offered.  The selection was plenty and meats were served hot, which is somewhat difficult to achieve in this type of setting.  The seasoning on each type of meat was unique and delicious.  The servers who delivered the meat to the table were very professional and were constantly asking us what we would like brought to the table next... and then they would return much quicker than we expected with what we were wanting more of.\\nWe are so glad we decided to try this restaurant even though the reviews are very mixed.

Well, I suppose I could take a compliment sandwich approach to this, so let's do that...\\n\\n[] Compliment Bread [] The Beef Patty was pretty good. Not as good as Curried Jamaican Beef Patties, but close.\\n\\n[] Sandwich Innards [] Seriously, this was the worst shawarma I've ever eaten. Awful. It was sadness in wrap form. I got a chicken and a beef (now wishing I had given the lamb a try instead) for me and my wife. They were both several kinds of bland and unappetizing. The sauce had no flavor. The meat had no flavor. What's the opposite of Flavortown? Because that's where these wraps were from. \\n\\nYou know how sometimes you're at the airport, and you're famished, so you end up paying $9 at one of those restaurants that you can't be sure will be terrible or not? Like, you know they're trying to be a generic version of Panera Bread or something, and the menu has a little bit of everything, but with an up-charge. And you decide to try the grilled chicken wrap because you think, \\"Hey, it's a grilled chicken wrap, how badly can they screw it up?\\" But then you get the wrap, and you realize they managed to screw it up pretty badly. But you paid $9 for it, so you force yourself to eat it, because there's some poor kid in a third-world country that would kill for this crappy wrap. Well, Boston Shawarma's food made me want one of those airport restaurant wraps. \\n\\nI know this sounds like an exaggeration, but the chicken had like a... shredded rotisserie chicken quality to it, but with none of the rotisserie flavor. Or any flavor. We ended up throwing both the wraps away, because screw the third-world kids, these wraps were not worth finishing. Even four days after I eating it, I'm still sad that Boston Shawarma took up precious stomach real estate; we only had 3.5 days in Boston, and there were so many other things on my bookmarks that would have been better. I could have shoved in a couple more lobster rolls in place of the half-wrap that I ate. A part of me wonders, maybe we got the wrong thing from the menu? And that's certainly possible, but I'm not willing to give it another shot when there are so many other amazing restaurants in town. Boston Yelpers, I say this with all sincerity: I kind of hate you for recommending this place so highly.

I regularly have free shots, 20% off, BOGO, and dollars (plural) discounts just for checking in at the register with my phone number (no need to even get out my phone). Points are good for any of the 20+ locations in town.\\n\\n2. Order online and pick-up with no wait. This one comes in real handy when you need to zip back to the office and the summer heat is cranked up to 110 with the queue back to the door.\\n\\n3. Bring your own reusable container or straw for another discount (50 cents for a JL tumbler, 25 cents if it's not, and 10 cents for a reusable straw). For this one, you have to be disciplined about rinsing and putting your tumbler or bottle back into your car (which I usually am not - wahh), so I keep buying new JuiceLand bottles - oops! Even if you have to use their disposable cups, tree-huggers never fear, they're compostable.\\n\\nFor some reason, I'm always drawn to the Tikal smoothie, Junglelily juice, and/or the Fireman shot, but I sometimes mix it up and go with the daily or monthly special (you know I *do* love a bargain). Regardless, I almost always add in cayenne and salt - they're free and make everything taste just a bit more exciting.\\n\\nThis particular location is closest to my work & home, so it was a wonderful bit of news for me when the old ice cream shop here turned over to JuiceLand.

Based on my experience the first time, I would've given it 4 stars just for the amazing Cha-shu bowl. Unfortunately before I had a chance to continue my sporadic yelp updating, I stopped by again and the Cha-shu was actually kind of gross so I think quality has gone down since they opened but I'll clarify in the review.\\n\\nAlso I'm definitely a big fan of ramen and made it a point to hit all the popular SF places last summer, so I do have a standard I hold most ramen places to. \\n\\nAtmosphere: This place is brightly lit but very small, so if you don't get there as part of the first crowd, the wait can be pretty long. The tables are small but can be combined and the decor is cheery with a slight Japanese theme. \\n\\nService: Service is good here. The servers bring your food out in a timely manner and are polite and easily flagged down. No complaints here. I also appreciate that they have a person who tells you which table to go to and provides you with a number while you're already waiting in line to order. The only issue is that the ordering system is sort of cafeteria. You line up in a single file line to order and pay at the cash register and then you sit and wait for your food. This definitely slows down service, but given the size of the restaurant I can't really see a way to make it more efficient. \\n\\nFood: I'll start with the consistent and then clarify as I go along. First up is the ramen itself. Both times I've been here I've gotten the Ramen Tatsu-ya. It has an Aji-tama egg, wood ear, scallions, and a slice of cha-shu. The cha-shu is only decent, not memorable. It doesn't have a particular flavor or an amazing char and is pretty basic. The Aji-tama egg was a HUGE letdown. First of all, I have never seen an egg with a practically transparent yolk. That has to be wrong. The first time I came, I ordered an extra egg. That meant I had an extra strangely questionable egg to eat. The egg itself is faintly sweet and the weird transparent yolk had a funny texture to it. I really didn't like it so the second time I did not order an extra. The broth base is pork based but it really lacks depth. It didn't even compare to any of the SF Ramen places. It was also quite salty. The first I wrote it off as a fluke because they had just opened, but the second time I was less lenient. It was the same both times. They also use a thin noodle that seems very \\"commercial\\" if that makes sense. The noodles are bland and don't even reflect the flavor of the broth well. Overall really subpar ramen and I even gave it a second chance since ramen in Austin isn't exactly stellar to begin with. \\n\\nThe first time I went I also got the Munchie Katsu Slider which I actually really liked. I didn't get it the second time because 1. I was less hungry and 2. I just didn't feel like it. The burger is juicy, flavorful, and the picked vegetables as well as the potato salad are great compliments. I'd recommend getting this.\\n\\nNow the strangely inconsistent. Essentially this one dish could have redeemed this restaurant into the 4 star range, but it dropped the ball the second time I came. So the reason I came back is 1. because of this dish and 2. just to give the ramen a fair chance. This is the Cha-shu bowl. The first time I went, it was amazing.; every Asian's comfort food dream. Perfectly seasoned, fatty, flavorful and just heavenly. The pickled vegetables helped to cut the richness as did the scallions. The first time, my ex and I fought over this bowl. It single-handedly was worth 5 stars. So remembering this deliciousness I came here with my mom when she visited me. I kept hyping up the dish and the second time it failed me. This time, the ratio of broth to rice was ridiculous. It was like eating a gumbo; my rice was drowning in too salty broth. In addition they seriously skimped on the cha-shu and why was the cook so heavy-handed with the soy sauce? It was salty and horrible. My dreams of that perfect cha-shu bowl were shattered. Consequently this landed the restaurant into the 2 star range. I'm not sure if that first time was an amazing fluke, but given that everything got worse tasting, it doesn't bode well. \\n\\nI don't know if I would come back. I still have this faint glimmer of hope that they've re-tweaked the cha-shu bowl into that glorious concoction I remember, but I don't want to be disappointed again. I guess I'll mull it over and maybe one day if I'm in the neighborhood and feeling nostalgic, I'll give it a third shot and hope for the best. I honestly wouldn't recommend the ramen here, but that very first cha-shu bowl was incredible."},{"name":"Franklin Barbecue","address":"900 E 11th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Full review can be found at http://bgoodeatsandtreats.com/2015/09/17/franklin-barbecue-in-austin-tx/\\n\\nThe Morning After:\\n\\nOh what a day! After sitting outside in 90 degree plus heat for 4 hours and another 1/2 hour inside, I was exhausted. I was given an estimated time to eat of 1:30 and thankfully sat down to eat right around 12:45. When I got right outside of the door one of the employees was walking down the line giving out small pulled pork sandwiches, which very nice of them. Look back at it the wait really wasn't that bad.  Go to hangout and have good conversation with new people and enjoy a few cold beers.\\n\\nNow to the BBQ...In one word, DIVINE! Got to the front of the line and there was beautiful hunk IMG_4982of brisket sitting in front of the meat carver on the chopping block along side a slab of ribs. I couldn't wait to get my hands on it, as a matter of fact, I am heating up my leftovers as we speak! We ended up with 1/2 lb mix of lean and fatty brisket, 1/2 lb of pulled pork, 4 ribs, and a link of smoked sausage. As well as a side of potato salad.\\n\\nLet's start off with the brisket, my favorite cut of BBQ. The bark had a nice deep smoky bit to it and the smoke was not too strong, so you could still taste the meat itself.  It was so juicy and succulent that I could have eaten them without having anything to drink. The fat content was spot on and left me wanting another bite as I was chewing on the previous bite.\\n\\nThe pulled pork was light on the smoke and amazing in its own right. I ended up making a nice little sandwich with a piece of white bread and one of the BBQ sauces on the table. At one point I was just grabbing handfuls of pulled pork and dropping them in my mouth.\\n\\nNow about them ribs! The spice in the rub that was used on the ribs gave a nice bit of heat to the ribs. I know it's always said the the sign of a good rib is that the meat just slides right off the bone, but I tend to disagree with that. I don't want to pick up a rib, take a big bite, and pull of the meat that I've bitten cleanly from the bone. This is exactly what I got from the ribs at Franklin and it left me a very happy camper.\\n\\nThere is not much to say about the sausage other than it was good! A good amount of smoke and spices, made this sausage extremely enjoyable. The skin had a nice snap when I bit into it and it was good and meaty inside."},{"name":"Mellow Mushroom","address":"2426 Guadalupe St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"This place has one of THE greatest pizzas ever.

On my drive home, I ended up stopping to get a pizza at Sweet Tomatoes. So I ordered which was fine. Even walking into the beautiful, spacious restaurant was fine. But, having planned on going to Pepe's (and a few other places in the mall), I brought a few hundred dollars, all one hundred dollar bills. So when paying for the pizza I had to pay with a $100 bill. The employee (Neill, according to my receipt), said they don't accept $100 bills and that is common in any pizza shop. He said he would accept it just this once, but he had to back to the safe, where he brought back change, still rude and upsetting to me. First of all, there is NO sign and second, (I waited to write this review until I made this phone call) I called the Newton Sweet Tomatoes (in the Center), who said they have no issue with it. Following I called the Needham location, who said they would also have no issue with it. Ok, great so why didn't the employee have an issue with it? I'm getting a call back from the manager of this place to straighten everything out. This is ridiculous. Why would I ever return if Newton will treat me SO much better.

THERE WAS STILL A LINE! It took us about 45 minutes to get to the front and order.  We got a little bit of everything, minus the ribs which had already sold out.  Here's a breakdown of what I thought of each item:\\n\\nSausage (1/5) -- I was not impressed by the sausage at all....Sausage is usually the cheapest meat, and I don't think you can really mess it up.  However, their sausage casing was too tough so that when you cut/bit into it, it would pull away from the inside, and the inside would crumble apart.  It also had a really gamey flavor.\\n\\nBrisket (5/5) -- Hands down.  Best brisket ever.  They give you huge slices of moist meat that has a great flavoring all on its own.\\n\\nPotato salad (3/5) -- Pretty standard mustard-style potato salad.\\n\\nSauces (2/5)  -- Not a big fan of the sauces.  There were 3 different ones, a vinegar-y bbq sauce, espresso bbq sauce, and a third that tasted almost like salsa.  They were all a bit thin and watery and didn't really complement the meat.\\n\\nOverall, the brisket is really the only thing that impressed me about Franklin's Barbecue, but I'll be back to try the ribs!"},{"name":"Se7en Bites","address":"617 N Primrose Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Close to perfect for vibe, food, selection -- they push all of a food-appreciator's hot buttons with pleasant authority."},{"name":"The Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar","address":"Universal Citywalk - Orlando, 6000 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"I came to this restaurant for dinner for the first time ever this past weekend and it is actually not a romantic restaurant to have dinner at, since its very touristy and you get people in there with thong sandles and cargos but the place itself is not too shabby.

It had a little bit of a kick to it which was nice. The potatoes were more bacon than potatoes. And not the crispy Waffle House kind. It was the fatty, squishy kind. I was a little disappointed by that, but the potatoes I had were delicious. The mac & cheese was cheesy, tangy goodness. I'm not much of a meatloaf eater, but my husband was raving about it.

One friend tried 3 different times and was met with a sold-out sign.  Another waited in line on Franklin's last day as a stand, only to find out that the first person in line bought all the ribs for the day.  So yes, it sounded like good stuff, but usually I have better things to do with my time...\\n..but not ALL the time.\\n\\nSo last Sunday the hubs and I decided to check this place out.  We arrived around 11:30, so there was a long line ahead of us.  More importantly, it was the slowest line ever.  I suggest bringing a good book, a travel game of scrabble, knitting, and people you don't hate, because it took us a good hour-plus to wind our way up front.\\n\\nSo why did it take so long?  There's only one meat cutter guy, and he's super friendly.  And he's being real sweet and chattin' up every person that comes to him.  And you're standing there smelling bbq and watching everyone eat it and you're noticing that the family in front of you is very large (seriously, like too large to have all traveled in one vehicle together.  It was mind-boggling!), and it dawns on you that maybe everything will sell out before you even get there.  And you realize, life sucks right now.\\n\\nThen the heavens open up and God says, \\"Go for it, Phyllis!\\", and  we finally got to the counter.  And that super-friendly meat guy seemed that much friendlier and you know what?  We totally chatted despite having loathed the idea of it 5 minutes earlier, along with life in general.  \\n\\nAnd then a fatty brisket and  ribs that fell of the bone danced across my plate and into my mouth and made life not only worth it but awesomely worth it.  So yes, by far my favorite fatty brisket and ribs I've ever had here or in Lockhart.  The sausage is pretty standard and so are the sauces.  But you hardly needed any, cause again, the brisket and ribs were the best ever.\\n\\nI almost think it's a darn shame that the line here can cause me to go into such a deep depression.  Because in all honesty, the bbq was amazing, but when I get  bbq, I'm hungry.  When I'm hungry, life sucks.  And I'd like it not to.

The milkshakes and alcoholic drinks are AWESOME!! \\n\\nWouldn't say this is a great place for a date night since the seating is a bit weird and tailored towards larger groups, but it is fun for fun birthdays and girls / guys nights \\n\\nNow I do want to warn you that there is a 18% gratuity added to parties over 6. Considering how much the drinks/ milkshakes are, you're almost paying 10 bucks alone for that"},{"name":"Seasons & Regions Seafood Grill","address":"6660 SW Capitol Hwy","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Luckily stumbled upon this spot. Ordered the smoked salmon tater tots (perfect start to the meal- filling and should be shared), albacore tuna with heirloom squash and tomatoes in a tomato cream sauce (so tasty and also filling), and finished it off with a slice of key lime pie (great combo of tart and sweet). So excited to return and try other items on the menu; there are many options that look delicious!"},{"name":"The Arlington Restaurant & Diner","address":"134 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Arlington","stars":"3","text":"Mmmm, mmm good!  I came here with my brother's lovely lady friend, and we had an excellent brunch.  I had the Irish eggs benedict, which is a huge plate of eggs B with corn beef hash under the eggies over the English muffin and home fries on the side.  I didn't come close to finishing my meal, but that's because the portions are huge."},{"name":"The Cowfish Sushi Burger Bar","address":"Universal Citywalk - Orlando, 6000 Universal Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"This restaurant is killing it. This is the second time my husband and I are visiting Universal, and back in 2013, this place didn't exist. Overall, we've been disappointed with the food in Florida, and Cowfish thankfully didn't make that list. \\n\\nOur server was young and extremely attentive, smiling the entire time and never once looked flustered, despite how busy it was. We decided to go both ways, I had sushi (The Gerorgia roll and the Spicy Shrimp Tempura roll), and my husband had a burger with bacon and peanut butter. I can only speak for the sushi, which was excellent. Fresh, perfectly cut, and each ingredient paired well. \\n\\nThe cocktails alone will keep anyone returning. Please give a raise to the bartender(s). I honestly can't remember or even say the last time I had cocktails that were mixed so well, with just the right amount of fresh ingredients. My liver was smiling the entire time. \\n\\nThe only \\"criticism\\" I could even have is that this restaurant is two levels and you need to check in on the first floor. I counted at least six groups of couples who were aimlessly walking around interrupting the servers, including ours, looking for a seat. Maybe have a couple of signs posted upstairs??\\n\\nI would 100 percent recommend this restaurant and look forward to returning on our next visit to Universal.
