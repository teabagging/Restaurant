I came here with a friend at around 5pm and there was already a forming for people to get in.  How crazy.  Any way, we were seated immediately and given our menus.\\n\\nFirst impressions of the place was that it was a really nice and modern looking restaurant.  Not cramped like the other ramen places.  This place has the most interesting menu for ramen out of all the other ramen joints here too.  No shoryu or anything like that but they did have the safe miso soup.  I got the spicy ramen and my friend got the miso.\\n\\nThe food came out freakishly fast.  Maybe it was because we came at 5 and they had all the soup ready to go but I want to say within 5 minutes of us ordering we had our bowls.  Noodles as expected had a good consistency to it.  I think they might have slightly under cooked them cause there was a huge bite to it but it came to the right consistency after maybe sitting in my soup for like a minute.  \\n\\nNow... the broth in my opinion was the star.  The best tasting broth I have tried out of all the ramen places.  I could just keep drinking it down if I wanted to.  Very flavorful and very delicious.  I've been to Yume(if you drink this broth you need heart surgery afterwards), Sapporo, Inaka and Pikaichi.  I liked this broth the most.  Absolute star of the dish.\\n\\nComplaints?  The pieces of pork tasted quite nice but they were tiny tiny tiny.  Even though the broth was \\"spicy\\" ramen, it wasn't really spicy.  More like white people spicy so maybe I should get the extra spicy bowl next time.  The place only accepts cash... It is the priciest out of all the ramen places.  I mean Yume charges more but the amount of food they give you is ridiculous.  \\n\\nSoo yeah.  In my opinion the better ramen places in Boston right now.  I didn't have to wait super long and I didn't get food poisoning like other reviewers, overall a great experience.  Would I come back?  Definitely.

My favorite, though, was the one I ordered - the buckeye bar.  Dense chocolate cake with a layer of jam, it is then covered with a thick layer of salty-and-smooth peanut butter cream.  I can't stress how important the \\"salty\\" aspect here is - it breaks up the sweetness and tastes like, well, peanut butter  ...as opposed to that super sweet \\"peanut\\" cream you often find in baked goods.  Oh, and there's a slab of beautifully decorated chocolate on top.   So, in short, it's like the most over-the-top decadent peanut butter sandwich you've ever had.  On top of chocolate cake.  With chocolate. ....yeah, um, maybe it's a good thing I'm not close/rich enough that I could be eating this every day.  Because I probably would.  \\n\\nI also gave the \\"sonata\\" espresso a try.

I was extremely disappointed with them and left feeling angry.  The food and drinks were mediocre at best, definitely not even close to the quality they had in the past.

But this is notI went in there and spoke to the waitress in Mandarin but since she saw my husband who is Caucasian, she decided to respond to me in English when in fact I spoke in Mandarin to her first.  I proceeded to speak to her again in Mandarin yet she persisted in English.  I asked her if she does not understand Mandarin she then responded in Mandarin and said she did.   I subsequently placed my order.  Then, the next thing I realized is that they took away the standard chopsticks and replaced them with forks (I can see it on other tables that people were offered chopsticks).  I then asked the waitress for chopsticks which she returned with one pair only and gave it to my husband.  Can you believe it, not only was I discriminated, but I was discriminated by people of my own ethnicity, that is just absolutely ridiculous!!!

In fact, I think you'll find, at any given time, more people in line outside than eating dinner inside. This place is small but quaint. Actually, it's adorable (there, I said it). There are maybe 20 tables total plus two \\"VIP\\" seats at the bar - which is where we were lucky enough to sit. Everything about this place is fun and enjoyable: the elbow-rubbing closeness of the tables, the chalkboard menu, the old Italian man (who must be the owner) working tables and supervising the kitchen, and the Italian music that is perfect. The place is filled with outstanding smells (from the kitchen that is part of the dining room) and has a real homey feel to it; so warm and inviting. We used to live in NYC and this reminded us of a true NYC-style restaurant (and what I'd imagine a place in Italy, though I've never been).\\nBathroom: it's small and relatively clean but it gets the job done\\n\\nStaff: Since there will most likely be a line, here's how it works: you line up and every now and then a staff member will come out and run down the line to note how many groups of how many people. As a table inside opens up she simply pokes her head out and says the number needed: \\"Two? Two?\\" The line then polices itself for which party gets to go in. Once inside they seat you at a table and your waiter approaches to greet you and get things started. All the staff is all about business but they are all super nice. The old guy, who has to be the owner, is right there in the thick of things too - which makes it even more fun! We really enjoyed our waiter and the bus boys are top notch. GREAT staff!\\n\\nFood: This place has one of those menus where you know that everything is good but you still have to choose... we started with the calamari (delicious) and a Caesar salad (YUM) before moving onto our main course of butternut squash ravioli (outstanding! this was on recommendation from our waiter who actually picked it over the lobster ravioli) and shrimp and sallops over linguini (so tasty and HUGE portion). We didn't end up getting any dessert because we were way too stuffed.\\n\\nValue: The prices are not bad at all here and so you feel like you're really walking away a winner given everything else I've mentioned.\\n\\nWe came on a great recommendation and now absolutely love this place.

They dropped the check without asking if there would be anything else.  Came and picked it up because there was a mistake(we hadn't looked at it yet). Came and picked it up again(we still hadn't looked at it as we had 1/2 our drinks left). Brought it back again and removed everything but our drinks from the table - felt rushed. \\nBathroom report:  YUCK.  I walked in and was hit by a wall of stink. There was water all over the counter and would have been on me if I'd leaned into the counter. One of the soap dispensers was lying on the counter having fallen off the wall. There was TP on the floor in the stalls and paper towels on the floor under the sinks.  A waiter was using the sink when I got out of my stall. I mentioned the mess and she said \\"yeah\\" and missed the trash can with her paper towel and walked out.  \\nWe will try again next summer when we can sit on the patio.

I went for dinner with my parents on a Sunday afternoon and the place was absolutely packed. I don't know if they do it to increase profits or if they're always short-staffed, but it was difficult to get service and our waiter looked absolutely exhausted every time we flagged him down. \\n\\nMy parents have been here several times and say this is always the case. So what keeps them coming back? The original dishes (they even have these marked with an \\"M\\" on the menu) and wonderful atmosphere.\\n\\nBeing a vegetarian, I immediately praise any restaurant that places a \\"V\\" next to dishes so that I don't have to read through every option. I like when things are simplified. Finger snaps for you, Ol' Mohawk!\\n\\nWe got the Nacho Grande (plain, you can also get it with pulled pork, chicken or taco beef--but we're fans of veggie chili) as an appetizer and just couldn't stop eating it. It was amazing; the jalape√±os added just enough \\"oomph\\" to the dish and the kettle chips were so soft and a perfect base. I wished I had gotten it for dinner.\\n\\nInstead I ordered the \\"Crustless Pizza\\" (a Mohawk original)  and was a little disappointed after all of the rave reviews my parents had given it (they even make it for dinner now and then at home). But, being a vegetarian, I didn't add pepperoni or grilled chicken and it was just penna pasta with too much cheese on top. It was still good, just not what I was expecting. I think the extra toppings would have made it seem more like pizza and that was my own fault for not asking for more.\\n\\nMy mom ordered the Bistro Salmon salad and it was amazing. The salmon was perfect. Definitely recommend.\\n\\nThe atmosphere; I am a huge fan of the brick on every wall, as well as the original pieces of art for sale by local artists--I'm told they're never the same. The Old Mohawk somehow manages to pack a lot of tables into a small space without it feeling cramped. Even as the people flowed in, I never felt like I had to yell to be heard; a rarity in smaller and busier restaurants. \\n\\nThe bar is also in the middle of the room and the tables are placed around it, like it's the center of the show. This may not be huge, but I liked that it wasn't just tucked against some wall or shoved into a corner.\\n\\nOverall: the service is friendly (albeit scarce); the food (if ordered wisely ;) ) is original and tasty without being bogged down by grease and the atmosphere is ever-changing and relaxed."},{"name":"Panera Bread","address":"3435 SW Cedar Hills Blvd, Ste A","city":"Beaverton","stars":"3","text":"My best friend and roomie has been raving about this place for probably over a year.

Wait times can be long but the food is always worth the wait!"},{"name":"Acitron Cocina Mexicana","address":"473 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Arlington","stars":"4","text":"I was excited to see a new restaurant open up in Arlington--one that isn't pizza- or roast-beef-based--so I encouraged my friends to join me in supporting our local economy.  Unfortunately, I have to give Acitron a two-star Yelp rating, which here means, \\"Meh. I've experienced better.\\" I won't argue with the others who think this place is great and will return--I hope they do and keep Acitron alive and well--but I don't plan to go back.\\n\\nFirst, the service. The service was extremely friendly and attentive. We asked about various menu options, and the explanation was thorough and helpful. The waiter even brought out tasting bowls of the various mole sauces. However, we felt rushed along our meal. Which makes no sense, because the place was mostly empty on this particular weekend night. Overall, I would give the service four stars.\\n\\nSecond, the drinks. We stuck with the basic margaritas--rocks, salt--and were pleased. Four or five stars.\\n\\nThird, the appetizers. We arrived to the obligatory chips and salsa. The salsa was tasty, but the chips were clearly not homemade (i.e., corn tortillas cooked in oil, add salt), but those perfectly round tortilla chips that you get from a bag, e.g., Tostitos. They weren't *bad*, but for me, homemade tortillas chips are the hallmark of a good Mexican restaurant, high-end or low. We should not have ordered the queso fundido since it relied on the chips for a vessel, but we did, and it was unremarkable (2 or 3 stars). For me, a 4- or 5-star queso fundido comes served in a pot on top of a flame so that the cheese stays viscous. We also ordered the ceviche, served with tortillas, and it was a 4-star ceviche in my book. \\n\\nFourth, the entrees. I was persuaded by our waiter to order the chicken in traditional mole sauce (\\"pechugas poblanas\\"). Now, I'm not a chocoholic, but I do like a nice, complex mole like they make in Oaxaca. Not trying to be snooty here, I've been to Oaxaca, took a cooking class there, so I feel that I can speak about mole with some bit of authority. Acitron's mole was much too chocolatey. Still, if served with enough sophistication--that is, with chicken and/or sides that can balance out the mole--then I would have given it a solid 3 or even 4 stars. However, the chicken was utterly boring: two boneless chicken breasts with no flavor beyond the salt and pepper with which they were cooked. The chicken was really just a plain vehicle for the mole, and since I didn't like the mole--again, someone else might love this (perhaps Cathy from the comic strip)--I was really disappointed. The menu billed the sauce as \\"legendary,\\" so I really must beg to differ. My wife ordered the filet mignon, medium rare. She said it was \\"OK,\\" but then got to the part of the filet that was just too rare to be appetizing to her. She left that hunk of the meat on the plate, so I hope the message to the chef was received. Two of my friends ordered the pollo relleno in mole verde. Although what came out on the plate did not look at all like what was ordered (it's actually wrapped in a tortilla, then smothered in green mole sauce), I enjoyed my bite of it and wish I'd ordered it.\\n\\nI think we all skipped dessert because we were feeling so underwhelmed by the meal so far. I really hope Acitron finds its stride because that storefront was empty for far too long, and I'd like my fellow Arlingtonians to enjoy this place if their tastes differ from mine. Still, if I'm going to pay $$-$$$ for Mexican food, my go-to place is going to remain OLE Mexican Grill in Inman Square (Cambridge), which--although more expensive--is definitely a \\"wow\\" meal that delivers mas bang for el peso."},{"name":"Antico Pizza","address":"1093 Hemphill Ave NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Two big likes.

It just tasted like it was baked with care. The ricotta was on point, but also not too sharp for people just getting use to it.  Admittedly, the bacon bits were a little sparse, but it didn't matter because the whole texture was just awesome.  No need for the saltiness of bacon to overpower this!  Other bits included a spinach of some sort, which was standard quiche fillings.\\n\\nIt came with a fresh side of mesculin greens, and a very light vinaigrette (which I love because I do greens sans dressing). \\n\\nMy friend joined me for a little (after I devoured my quiche) haha.

Our first course was leek soup with sweetbreads...why was it green, and why were the sweetbreads the only flavor element? Our main courses were chicken breast and Vermont pork.

It wasn't as packed as I thought it would be but it got busier throughout the night.\\n\\nThe smoker is huge and they let you take pictures with it!  The service was great and everyone was very nice and friendly!\\n\\nWe tried their brisket, pork ribs, sausage, turkey and beef ribs.   Their brisket, hands down, is the BEST and most TENDER that I've ever tried.  You have to ask for the moist brisket, which is really tender.  If you like a harder outside, with a soft inside, you can ask for the burnt ends, which is also great too! \\n\\nThe pork ribs and beef ribs were also great but of the two, the beef ribs were our favorite!  The meat was super flavorful and barbequed and tasted very similar to Chinese Barbequed Pork but better!  \\n\\nThe sausage was also another favorite of ours!  Crunchy and juicy!  The meat comes piled onto a plate and covered with BBQ sauce.  Their Habanero Sauce is not spicy at all and has a good kick to it!  \\n\\nAfter having our hearty meal, we ordered some dessert and had to try their pecan pie.  It was absolutely amazing!  It came served warm with a scoop of ice cream.  The best part is that it wasn't too sweet which makes the pie even better!  \\n\\nI wish they offered some other green veggies as a side dish because I felt so filled up with eating all meat.  The coleslaw was not enough \\"green\\" for me but I guess if you're there to eat barbeque, it sort of defeats the purpose of eating green veggies.  \\n\\nEither way, we loved this place so much, we went back for a second round on a Sunday for lunch.  We got there at 11am and there was no wait.  Of course, after a few minutes, the place filled up but the restaurant is so large there is plenty of room.\\n\\nThis is definitely a must stop if you are in Austin.

We order a California roll, a BC roll, and a dynamite roll for that special price, as well as an additional Princess roll (smoked salmon with cream cheese) and seafood fried rice. The order was less than $25. At that time, I would have said that it was really well priced. \\nHowever, when I stood there waiting for my order, I noticed that the chef who prepared our sushi had previously been on his smartphone for some time. He didn't wash his hands properly with soap prior to making our order. I noted that all of the staff there were on their smartphone often. I was even more mortified when I saw him wipe the sink with a cloth that he later used to wipe down the counter top and the bamboo sushi roller. After finishing up he went back without washing his hands with soap to again play on his smartphone. Honestly, this lack of sanitary procedures caused me to send my take out straight to the microwave for a good minute once I had gotten home. \\nThe staff friendliness was mediocre - the lady behind the register was impatient as I had spent about ten minutes reading their menu. I am not sure who the owner is, but the people working their that day spoke in Cantonese. \\nThe food itself was a little too salty, and the fish was definitely not top quality - there was a certain smell to them. The seafood fried rice was average, considering that it was worth $10. \\nI wouldn't go back here.

I couldn't remember the name of the place - I left in 2004 - and I just HAD to look it up, and here I am. And I have to respond to the negative reviews. \\n\\nCertainly it's possible that in the years since I've left Portland the quality of the food at Adobe Rose has gone down. Maybe the place is filthy now instead of always clean. It's true that the service was better - at least friendlier, if not more efficient - once the guys have seen you around enough that you're recognized as \\"a regular\\". Maybe it's just plain bad now. And maybe, based on it's own merits, on what it is, you just don't like the food. Fair enough. In the end, that like-dislike taste thing is largely objective. But judge it on what it is - NEW MEXICAN food. Not Mexican.\\n\\nA lot of reviewers here don't seem to know the difference. OK. Why should people up in the cold, cloudy NW know NM food. I guess there's no reason to, really. But there is a difference, and it's not really fair to say the food fails because it is not things that it's not SUPPOSED to be.\\n\\nNew Mexican food is largely based on chiles. Chiles, corn and (whole) pinto beans. It doesn't use a lot of tomatoes like alot of what folks here are thinking of when they hear Mexican (and, apparently, New Mexican.) Mexican food does vary a lot from region to region, and in the SW, NM food is different than Tex-Mex, and ours in Colorado is a little different from those two. Anyway, NM food centers around the holy chile. New Mexican chiles. God love Hatch Chiles (it's chile-roasting time as I write this, and the smell wafts on the air as chiles are being roasted around town, from the Whole Foods down the street to the myriad roadside stands that pop-up each fall here the way fireworks stands appear in Portland in June.). NM food DOESN'T use a lot of jalapenos, or habaneros. This gives it a markedly different flavor. Mexican food will have sharper, brighter flavors, up front, quick heat - hotter chiles, acidic elements like tomato or lime, in some areas, cilantro, and raw white onion. NM has roasted chiles, chiles whose heat varies from variety to variety, area to area, batch to batch, pepper to pepper. The flavors are deeper, darker, smoky, more subtle, or you might say muted. You will taste more of the actual underlying ingredients, than strong seasoning on top of them. It's kind of like the difference between, say, a mole sauce and a pico de gallo. Is one better than the other? No. Just different.\\n\\nYou will not get one of those disgusting, huge, what I call \\"gut-bomb\\" Mission-style burritos in a NM restaurant. (Rice never belongs inside a burrito!) Your choice will likely be smothered in chile - red or green, and yes, the red may be a little like what some people think of as \\"enchilada\\" or \\"ranchero\\" sauce. People do them differently, just as different places do marinara or pizza or BBQ a little differently. You may well have to specifically order it not just smothered, but smothered with lettuce, tomato, any of those other toppings beyond chile. Often they're served smothered with just chile, and a side of rice and beans. You may well have to order chips and salsa, too. In many NM restaurants, they do not come automatically, and they're not considered all that important. They're not the indicator of the quality of all the other food. The salsa will not be chunky, pico style. And you will likely see sopapillas on the menu. Yum!\\n\\nAdobe Rose does good NM food. Does it equal the best of the best down in ABQ? No. But it's good. For a Colorado girl jonesing for something other than the big, gnarly bean and rice and vegetable -WTH?- burritos you find all over Portland, it always did the trick. I went to Adobe Rose when I was homesick. The margs sneak up on you. The Tesuque Burrito rocks. The owners are incredibly friendly and welcoming, once they get to know you. And the sopapillas are good. \\n\\nService can get slow sometimes. It's a small restaurant with a small staff. They're not just trying to cash in on some food trend or market niche. They're preparing familiar, everyday NM food, and they care about it. Forget your to-go box and they'll stick it in the fridge for you. If you can set aside the idea of HOT HOT HOT jalapeno-y Mexican food, then give it a try. (And is can have a slow burn, too, btw.) If you don't like it for what it is, great. Just please don't pan it because it isn't \\"Mexican\\" food."},{"name":"Ichiro Japanese Restaurant","address":"12011 2nd Avenue","city":"Richmond","stars":"3.5","text":"My favorite sushi restaurant in Vancouver.

The bread is pretty nice and warm. It tastes perfect with the butter. The Red Lentil Cauliflower Soup is pretty good. It tastes just like lentil soup to me with some small chunks of cauliflower in the soup. It's just a cup, so not much. The 6 oz petite filet is pretty good. The plate came out with the oil still sizzling. The meat was cooked right. The flavor is simple and enough. I'm not a fan of the creamed spinach. Too much cream to me. The Warm Bread Pudding with Whiskey Cream Sauce is ok to me. I guess I don't usually like bread pudding to begin with. But the restaurant week lunch menu only has this option. The service is ok. There's a time when we had to ask them to fill the water for us. There's a time when the appetizer came together with the entree. There's a time when it took them a long time to take away our dirty plates. They didn't serve us the bread till we ask them for it. In general, it's a good deal during restaurant week with $25 for 3 courses. But I don't know whether I'll come back here if I pay full price and get a mediocre service in a $$$$ restaurant."},{"name":"Pizzicato Pizza - Westmoreland","address":"1630 SE Bybee Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Sellwood location is inviting and family friendly.

She and the woman who sat us must have had a very peculiar interaction with someone before we walked in because they didn't seem to be on their games at all.\\n\\nOnce we were seated, a waiter came over to ask for our drink order and what type of water we'd like.  Then a manager came over to ask us the same thing.  A third person come to deliver our drink (mine was made incorrectly) and talk to us again.  I was apprehensive to say the least.\\n\\nAll of my misgivings were overshadowed and obliterated by our actual service!  My mis-made drink was fixed in short order.

The sauce was a lovely add-in you almost missed if you didn't look at your fork.\\n3: The rabbit with the pasta was paired expertly by Juan with a white wine that blew my socks off.  I took a picture of the bottle just to make sure I could have it again.\\n4: The lamb was earthy and comforty.  Juan gave us a wine with a \\"barnyard\\" feel to it which my friend was not shy about expressing her distaste for.

It's clear that they're passionate about what they do and are definitely doing something right. Maybe it just wasn't for me.\\n\\nThe evening was a date-night with the lady...something that was long overdue. She had made the original reservations, after reading about the $40 chef's tasting. Unfortunately, she missed the part where it's only offered after 9 PM and our reservations were for 8 PM. When tried to push the reservation back, we were told that they were completely booked. Nevertheless we changed our mindset and decided to go for a splurge of a dinner.\\n\\nWe started with two wonderful cocktails. Our waitress recommended Ardoise for the lady while I got the Northern Lights, which was a lovely riff on a Sazerac. Additionally, the service was impeccable the whole night, glasses always full, everyone really chipping in to make sure we always had the appropriate flatware, etc.\\n\\nThe fish amuse was bluefish pate topped with some black roe...a great way to start the meal with a bright brininess that was pleasantly jarring.\\n\\nThe mrs.'s starter was quite nice...a trio of pates with a palette of accompaniments, violet mustard, cornichons etc. Great execution.\\n\\nMy octopus, on the other hand, was underwhelming. While it was super tender, I felt it was under seasoned and the chorizo sauce was decidedly ordinary. It lacked any kick, smokiness, or richness that I was anticipating.\\n\\nOur mains followed a similar pattern, with my other-half again ordering the better dish. Her rib eye was easily the best piece of red-meat we've had in Boston. It's more memorable than anything we've had at Capital Grille or Grill 23. I only wish I knew how they seasoned the extra tender meat, it was a mix of sweetness and earthiness that was really well balanced.\\n\\nMy trio of pork, confit + pork belly + rib had a few wonderful elements, but also had some missteps. It had a decidedly Asian flair, accompanied  with the bok choy side with pickled Chinese mustard greens that was slightly soggy. While I appreciate the nod to my peeps, it seemed, out of place on a fine-dining plate. Furthermore, the confit showed up cold and the pork belly was unmemorable. I much preferred the pork belly served as a side at the brunch at Jose Garces's Tinto. Craigie's didn't have that same balance of the sinfully oozing fat melding with the lean meat. I guess it was too dry, which was odd for a piece of pork belly. However, the fried pork rib was outstanding. The prominent sweet flavors reminded me of Chinese sausage.  It was a real treat, probably tying with the cocktails as the highlight of my meal. (The rib eye takes 1st place in the overall competition).\\n\\nThen came desserts. My apricot torte with amaretto ice cream and pistachios was, so so. The alcohol from the amaretto didn't pair well with the sour apricot sauce and both overpowered the pistachios. My girlfriend's buttermilk ice cream with strawberries and shortcake was also a little off the mark. The buttermilk ice cream by itself was way too sour. However, when all of the components of the dish were taken together in one bite, it was like you were eating a frosty strawberry cheesecake. \\n\\nUnfortunately (and unfairly so), I'm still reeling two days later from the angel food cake with mascarpone gelato, nut florentine and strawberry coulis from Sibling Rivalry (the nutinees of the florentine really elevated the entire dish and added a wonderful contrast in texture to the spongy cake). The mellow tartness of the marscapone was much better at tying everything on the plate together than the cloyingly sourness of the buttermilk ice cream.  \\n\\nIndependent of the food, the night was slightly marred by the open-kitchen concept. There was a pervasive undercurrent of stress throughout the restaurant. Flashes of rolling eyes and exacerbated sighs from various staffers underlies the exterior of a tightly run ship.  While a small part of me enjoys watching Gordon Ramsay faking aneurysms at \\"cheftants\\" who have been exploitatively miscast for his punching pleasure, it's not so fun in real life. \\n\\nI understand that's the reality of running a successful kitchen. While the chef tonight was no where near that level of verbal abuse, I lost count of the number of times, \\"Matty!\\" or \\"Runner! I need a runner!\\" interrupted our conversation. I think the highlight was, \\"O-K. What does that spell?  Okay!\\" I guess it's not fair to sit in ivory towers, choosing instead to hide our heads in the sand, but snarky condescension can still put a real a damper on a meal.  \\n\\nLastly, when we left at 10 PM, there were two 2-tops, a 4-top, and 80% of the bar by the kitchen still open. Maybe they limit the # of discounted tastings, but we couldn't shake the feeling of slightly mislead.\\n\\nBottom line: 2 nights ago, we had a 3 course meal (2 apps, 1 app + 1 entree, 1 split dessert, 2 drinks) at a similarly celebrated South End restaurant...for less than 1/2 the $."},{"name":"Harvard Gardens","address":"316 Cambridge St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"When you're two years outta college and you can't go to the BHP every night this is the spot to move to on thursday night to see if you can land some waaay classier broads....no ricca chics here.

This place had SO MANY yelp reviews, and a high rating, so we decided to give it a shot. \\n\\nOne of the tips on yelp was the Happy Hour menu available between 5:30-6:30. So glad I read about it. When we were seated I asked and the waitress said that was only on Sundays, but I had seen a pic of it that said M-F only, so she went and asked and then came back with the correct menus. Seated next to us was 2 women who apparently come weekly and they had never heard of that menu, they were amazed! It really is a great deal. You pick anything on the menu for $3 each (includes full orders of sushi rolls, steak skewers, dumplings etc) or you can get 5 for $15 which includes a free alcoholic drink off their happy hour drink menu. \\n\\nSince it was our first time, we also wanted to try the hibachi since that's what we really came for. They have an early bird special (order before 6:30) for $13, pick any 2 (chicken,steak,shrimp) which comes with soup, salad (dressing is amazing and fresh) and noodles. You also get rice, but fried has an upcharge. Great deal considering its about twice that for chicken/steak combo at other times. \\n\\nWe will definitely be back.

Sunday, is their \\"premium\\" meat day so it's expectedly busy, what's unexpected is that they seem to not be expecting it be busy.  We had to wait an hour and a half, which would've been fine had there not been two other large dining rooms, with the smallest one being open (hire more staff or something for your \\"busiest day\\").  From there, it was rule central, NO CREDIT CARDS (who the hell doesn't take credit cards anymore, seriously, it's the 21st Century.  I'll tell you why they don't take them, because they have an ATM right there to profit from not taking them.  Classless) and NO EATING LONGER THAN 1 1/2 HOURS.  What?

The pasta was served with asparagus and prosciutto in a cream sauce. It was the most bland pasta dish I may have ever had ever, ever. The pasta was practically floating in the 'cream' sauce which had the consistency and tasted nothing more than luke warm milk. The 'prosciutto' was more like cubed ham. The pasta dish was almost flavorless with the exception of the asparagus.The bread was meh, but much needed to soak up the milk at the bottom of the pasta bowl. The hangar steak was underwhelming, chewy, and almost completely lacking any seasoning, maybe a few grains of salt, maybe.

Unfortunately, the whole experience was a let-down.  I went a couple of weeks ago on a rainy Wednesday.  It was raining so hard, I didn't expect the place to be so full!  \\n\\nThe whole experience started off badly with having trouble finding the place.  It wasn't well lit at night.  Also, parking was really difficult to find.  On a day when the mud puddles reached halfway up my legs, nobody wanted to park far away.  \\n\\nOnce I entered the place, the cashier was very rude about taking my order.  Since it was my first visit, I didn't know the process or what was on the menu.  When I tried to ask how much the desserts cost, she repeatedly told me some other information that was inaudible due to how loud it was in there.  It definitely wasn't about the price, though.  She also completely ignored me when I wanted to place my order and only offered me service after another customer came up to the counter.  \\n\\nAfter the ordering process, trying to find seating was an absolute nightmare!  The restaurant management should control the dining area--at the very least, give people assigned tickets like at a deli line because other patrons are very rude.  Any place where you have to fight over space makes for a bad experience in my book.  \\n\\nAs for the pizza itself, I thought it was good, but too expensive--over $20.  I've had better pizza for about half the price.  The peppers are verrrry hot!  I couldn't eat all of them and started picking some off.  My wife disliked it for the following reasons:  part of the dough was burnt, the sauce was too sour for her, and overall it was too salty.  I think her salt complaint was because I ordered the one with ham, which is a typically salty item.  She thought the white pizza our friend ordered was better, but it wasn't her favorite.\\n\\nAll in all, it was a miserable experience and I wouldn't recommend going here to anybody.  It might be fine to order a pizza to go, but DON\\"T dine in!

Everything was delicious except for the salmon - it was still edible, just a bit bland. \\n\\nNext time I went with a coworker for lunch. Again, we had a selection of tapas - some of the same ones listed above, plus the Ceviche. Again, everything was delicious. \\n\\nI went back recently with another coworker who thoroughly enjoyed the tapas we ordered. Again, some of the same ones listed above, plus the Espinacas Gallegas.  \\n\\nThis has become one of my go-to places for a meal!

I drove out of my way (which I never do being the lazy @$$ I am) to have these \\"gourmet\\" hot dogs. The restaurant looks like a spot in the airport you order at the window and then find a seat to hang until your flight departs. It was poorly laid out, but they're attempting upcycle creativity, so I'll give them that. The menu had some creative offerings, so we were stoked to order and dig in. The prices were high, so I assumed (wrongfully) that these would be big ol' wieners. WRONG! First off, our tater tots come out and there are maybe 2 tablespoons of their house made gorgonzola sauce. Definitely not worth the $7. Our hotdogs come out - standard length and girth - topped high with toppings. I take a bite. My bun is stale. Like county fair steamed 3 days ago and reheated 10 minutes ago stale. There was nothing on the bun to moisten it and all the toppings were gently placed on top of the dog, not surrounding. My bacon - by the way, I ordered the bacon cheeseburger dog - was in one big long breakfast length piece. It came off with my first bite. Boyfriend's bun was also stale, though his dog was a little more moist given the ranch dressing on top. I think the owner was our server. She was very nice. I won't return here.

They charge over $100/person to get in ad then want a minimum of $35/person to get one express on each ride - no repeats that will cost you close to $70/ person and then they don't offer express on the best coasters.

The noodles were a bit hard, not al dente, more like they had been sitting in the counter for some time. My wife had some scallion wrapped in beef dish that again had a great sauce but was virtually tasteless. \\nPresentation wise I don't think anybody really cared. The beef dish looked over cooked and sloppy, my chicken wasn't fully cut, which wouldn't have been a problem if they had given us a knife.  The rice around the sushi roll was very thin, it barely covered the seaweed and fell apart when you moved it. \\n\\nThe restaurant was very nicely decorated.

Since it was a saturday they had a few \\"brunch\\" specials featuring gravy and biscuits.  The sum of the parts (can't remember the catchy name) included Gravy, Chicken, Bacon, and Biscuit all thrown together in a little to go box for 7 bucks.  When I opened the box my arteries sent an early warning distress call to my brain because just looking at the box will give most Americans a medium sized heart attack.\\nThe food is damned good.  The chicken was certainly the highlight, crispy and tender with a great flaky crust and actual flavor in the batter.  The gravy, Bacon and biscuit were all good, but not great.  My favorite part was the portion size, which embraced its southern roots and really piled on the good stuff...2 LARGE pieces of chicken, 4 pieces of bacon, with a literal smothering of gravy.\\nMy only suggestions are to try and get a knife (or if you are like me just get down and grab that chicken with your hands...Diiiirrrttyy is like the slogan of the south, right?).  Also make sure you get the chicken, and if you really want to be impressed make sure that chicken isn't swamped with other stuff (it was hard to taste the amazing with all the gravy, etc on top of the bird).  Lastly skip the sweet tea, it is decent, but certainly not good enough to be ordered again.\\nI can't comment on the spicy levels cause it didn't relate to my brunch choice, however on my next visit I will be getting something with kick to be sure.\\nLove the originality and hope that this cart continues to make regular appearances on my circuit."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"Since moving to Tx 7 years ago it's taken time to understand the place barbecue holds in the food culture.

The view is spectacular, and the desserts just as much.  Sure the dessert might be a bit pricey, definitely not somewhere most people can go to all the time.  But you're also paying for the experience: the view of the lake as well as the occasional band performing on the deck.  When I was a college student in Austin, going to Mozart's was a rare occurrence, but it was well worth it.  Just being on the lakeside with a slice of cake was the perfect recipe for relieving stress.  Add in the cool Fall breeze and you're in bliss.\\n\\nLet's dive a bit deeper into their desserts.  Not many of their desserts are simple single-flavor cakes.  Their desserts are multi-layered so every bite you take you can taste so many different flavors.  The cakes can get pretty sweet and heavy, but all the various ingredients will keep you interested.  These are desserts that you can't find just anywhere.  With such a prime view and well designed sweets, their prices are well justified.\\n\\nIf you're in town during Christmas time, do yourself a favor and check out their Christmas Lights Show.  Compared with the well known light shows and displays around Austin, Mozart's is by far the best in terms of visual appearance, complexity, and entertainment.

We were greeted by 2 glasses of champagne and a congratulatory note, and whisked into a memorable 3 course meal.\\n\\nTheir beginning bread basket was tasty, although cold (would have expected warm freshly baked bread here, but I guess not?). We accidentally received 2 of each of the amuse bouches, but happily ate both as they were excellent bites (bluefish spread and a duck choriso).\\n\\nTo start, I had the fried clams with squid ink anchioade, and they were so tender and fresh without a whif of grit, and the anchioade added a flavorful touch. The clams were coated in a thick cornmeal coating, and to be fair, I personally usually prefer a thinner crust- but it was excellent for what it was. The hubby's squid app was also top notch.\\n\\nFor main, we both got the pork 3 ways (no way we were gonna share) and it was pretty fantastic... shoulder, rib, and belly, all prepared utterly perfectly and accompanied with the most lovely and flavorful accompaniments (tender white asparagus, grapes, jus). They ain't joking when they say Craigie knows how to do protein- this was lick-your-plate delicious, and I'd come back again and again for this dish (or really, any other protein). Note though- it was pretty rich (as French-ish food tends to be).\\n\\nFor dessert, I had something with lime curd, and the husband had something with chocolate, and both were pretty to look at and a great and tasty way to end the meal. Cocktails were excellent, wine list is solid, beer list had some decent options (although pricey). \\n\\nOverall, we had an excellent meal here, and really appreciated the nice anniversary touches.

French Moroccan fare. Hey, the French had to get something out of their colonial enterprise besides a whopping debt service on the Suez Canal. \\n\\nThis place has the look of a 70's Fern Bar, glitter in the cleavage party parlor. However, it's a sophisticated, brick, wood, glass, large rectangle of upscale dining destination. Thankfully, no fanny packers from the Celebrity cruise ship docked in the harbor, as they can't spare the time between Cha Cha lessons and learning to improve at Canasta. \\n\\nThis is one hot kitchen cooking way cool food. The engine room is downstairs so the servers and bussers can save on a gym membership as they hustle your Cuisses de Grenouilles like Calaveras County Froggies up and down all night. This room is fancy and classy and yes, requires a deep pocket for investors and digesters.\\n\\nThe Staff: Top pros. The mixologist/menu guide was an alchemist and knew how everything on the menu was prepared. Like his Mom was in the kitchen and read him recipes to go to sleep. When I begged for Frites, he said No, de trop (too much). A first class move. The rest of the stafflings were cheerful but not chatty. You want chatty...try speed dating, or better yet, speed your date here for dinner. \\n\\nThey even had a designated ice man. A dude that cut drink cubes from a solid block of glacial ice with a Home Depot Tree Saw. Where you gonna see that besides an Inuit Pot Luck?\\n\\nThe Vibe: Who goes there? e-traders, tax evaders, Trust Fund foodies, a few Vancougars, and an assortment of beautiful people of which I was one. Less than pretty after I saw what I'd ordered and then eaten. Kinda like your tender Tinder at dawn's light...it all seemed like a good idea at the time. \\n\\nThe Bar Program: Raised the bar. Elegant, adventuresome, creative compound chemistry. Innovative mixology at the highest level. And I speak from a high place. Plus the ultra comfortable bar stools were like Bark-o-Loungers with booze. A Britannica of brews to choose, pails of ales, lines of wines and Ciders with your sliders. A wine list as thick as a neighborhood phone book. \\n\\nI had a Basque Sour which was Beefeater Gin, Amontillado Sherry, Almond Syrup, Citrus and a Bordeaux float. It looked like a Shirley Temple and tasted like a High Holiday. \\n\\nThe Pineapple Express had Pisco, Medium Dry Sherry, Roasted Pineapple Puree, Pastis and was an express lane to wobbling back to your crib. \\n\\nThe Chupcabra Cabrito contained Reposado Tequila, Chestnut Honey, Ginger, Bruichladdish Port Charlotte (smokey Scotch for you bourbon drinkers), and Walnut Bitters. It refreshed the palate and and made you salivate simultaneously.\\n\\nThe Food: Nothing like it. And you will like it all. The best Frenching North African this side of the Red Light District or Dirty French in New York. The kitchen was on fire with great ideas. \\n\\nThe Thon Frit (think Tuna Tonkatsu) was crisp, tender, spicy, sweet and a multi-layered composition. (Like a night out with a schizophrenic). \\n\\nThe Asperges et Morilles, were local grilled Asperagus, Caramelized Morels, Papadum (thin Indian crackers, not your best friends stupid dad), Shaved Feta and Espelette-Spruce Vinaigrette. A Vegan paradise if there is such a thing. True Vegans need not apply, as only lapsed ones can eat Shaved Feta. Morels are usually overrated and hyper hyped and are actually chewy little buggahs, but these were as soft as the forest floor they came from. A hell of a morel. Whole asparagus plus a crisp tangle of shaved asparagus strings dusted with chili flakes. It was a Jackson Pollock on a plate. \\n\\nThe Calamars Farci were adolescent squidlets stuffed with Veal, Chili Aioli and Taro Chips. Kinda like eating your prettiest wrapped Christmas gift. \\n\\nSalad du Printemps was farm fresh Mixed Greens, House Pickled Onions, Pinenuts, Candied Crunchy Carrot strips with Charred Baby Carrots as well. It was sour, tangy, pickley, and balanced with some fine Buttermilk Dressing. Composed and gorgeous, Hieronymus Bosch would have paid extra to use this as his model. \\n\\nLamb Tajine was Paul Bunyon sized braised Lamb Shank with Raisin Couscous, house made Raita, and Harissa. (just in case you want to make your eyes sweat). The lamb was as soft as \\nas Trump's brain and spoon tender. (I meant the the lamb). After soaking up the braising liquid with a Baby Boule, I went all feral on the remnants. There hasn't been that much gnawing on the bone since Plato's closed.  \\n\\nFinally, time for dessert. One of the best anywhere. Chocolate Mouse, encased in hard Chocolate, Crisp Caramel Crackers, house made Raspberry Sorbet and Chocolate Crumbles. Divine and decadent. Just make room for it. Just do.  \\n\\nSo, shamble over to Chambar. It is not  a sham bar. It's the real deal and a phenomenal meal. Feel me?

The place is tiny, tables a so close to one another that I could use the neighboring tabletop as my arm rest. The staff was friendly, and fast. Water and bread arrived at our table few minutes after we sat down. The food came out very quickly which made us think that the mussels appetizer was pre-cooked, reheated and served. For entrees we had 3 different pasta dishes: calamari scampi over linguine, shrimp fra diavolo over linguine and fettuccini with swordfish and tuna pieces in a pesto cream sauce.

Not at all rubbery but very tender with a good battered flavor. It easily fed 2 guys and a girl (moi). For entree, I ordered the Frutti di Mare (shrimp,scallops,calamari,clams and mussels) with a half and half of the Fra Diavolo and the Giacomo sauce (thank Yelp for the recommendation!). Freakin' amazing. The seafood was so fresh and cooked to perfection. No sandy mussels or clams, big juicy shrimp and again some of that tender calamari. Just thinking about it again makes my mouthwater.

Since I do not eat red meat, I ordered the lamb and I believe every side order was ordered to share with our table. The sweet potato was too sweet for my taste, but the asparagus was cooked just right. And the lamb was amazing - it literally melted in my mouth.

All those little white lights in the rafters almost make you feel like you should at least try not to get BBQ sauce in your hair. And the benches under the big, beautiful tree by the Cellars were a really nice place to soak up some sunshine and let your food digest, before getting back in the car.\\n\\nA heads up for those who will be bringing a vegetarian along for the ride: there are only three sides--potato salad, beans, and coleslaw. Plus bread and pickles I guess. Those sides are actually surprisingly good for a place that really doesn't have to make an effort since their meat is so damn tasty, but they are the only options.

Pro's.  The staff and the location for me.  The bartenders are super friendly, professional and attentive.  Sam, Giovanni, Sunny, Eric, Jenny, Katie, Sara, and those whose names fail me are super on point and keep us coming back.  The place is super close to both my work and home.  Walking distance.  I've schedule 2 work happy hours and have lost count of how many times my friends and I have been there.  We usually go for all day Sunday Funday and stop in 1 or 2 other times a week.  \\n\\nCons:  Where to start.  Food is awful.  It's funny, I've had one of the best and worst tacos of my life at this place.  Chicken taco on Tuesday, good stuff.  Salmon taco, a whole nother' matter.  The bartender for that dang salmon taco really was not getting the hint that paying $4 for whatever they served me was against my moral code.  They should have paid me for daring to take a bite of it.  That bad.  The rest of the food is like playing Russian Roulette with your stomach.  Avoid the Biscuits and Gravy at all cost.  Better yet, eat somewhere else.  \\n\\nSecond is the tab battle I recently faced.  Goodness just thinking about the tab nonsense makes me furious.  I'll start from the beginning.  One weekend, a little over a month ago, they put one of my friends' entire tabs on mine.  He left and I got stuck paying his $40 bill.  I texted him and now I keep a running tab in my head and make him by me a drink every now and then, so no big deal.  Something similar happened a few weeks later where Dogwood bundled a couple drinks.  Again, no big deal.  I'm an accountant, so unlike most my friends, I track everything in my head at all times and hold accountability to just about every dang penny I have.  I picked up a quarter from the ground that day at the bar.  \\n\\nSunday, the 22nd and the days following I experienced the most bungled, unprofessional, infuriating tab crisis in my mid-life.  After a long, long Sunday Funday with fun and birthday parties and drinks I close out my tab and ask then to put some of the other reviewers drinks on my tab before leaving.  I owed her a couple and she is impossible to get back at, so I did it in secret.  The tab seemed reasonable for the one $6 meal and ~10 drinks I was paying for (mine and other reviewer included).  I ensured there were no other tabs, paid and left.  The next day I was hit with another tab for 134% of the total value of my first tab without my consent!  \\n\\nI waited until the next weekend to discuss with Dogwood.  This was to ensure the random charge actually cleared my bank and gave them time to remove it.  They didn't.  I spoke with the general manager, Jessica, about the tab.  I was a bit abrasive perhaps, likely a defense mechanism to when people say crazy things about my money to me and I'm immediately guilty until proven innocent.  For instance, \\"Well maybe the bartenders are just comfortable with you guys and mixed up your tabs\\"... or \\"I reviewed the video and think most the drinks are yours, but I didn't have audio\\"... \\n\\nJessica admitted one of the drinks, randomly charged to my bank, with a time stamp of 10:15pm, despite myself or none of my friends being present at the bar, was likely an error.  What she failed to account for was that my tab and the other reviewers were completely intermingled.  It turns out the tab I paid at the bar was in the other reviewers name!  The other tab they charged me later, actually under my card, was some random concoction of whomever drink they felt like I should pay for.  Keep in mind I didn't agree to pay for anyone else' drink, other reviewer included, after I tabbed out and left.\\n\\nGuess what is the worst thing I never got?  An apology.  They simply agreed to refund the one clear mistake, ignore the others that were not proven by reasonable means and treat me like crap through the entire process.  \\n\\nWatch your tabs folks.  I'm one starring this, one of my favorite hangouts, until they get straightened out.\\n\\nEdit:  I got all my troubles sorted out.  Who am I kidding.  I love this bar.

Better still, they pair it with a sweet fig sauce that makes the perfect complement. We really enjoyed the paella, especially how crunchy it was. The only complaint is the size. It was a little huge for two people, especially after we took their recommendation of ordering three small dishes to tide us over during the wait. Lastly, this is more of a personal preference than a complaint but I also wish we had ordered the meat paella rather than the mariscos.

Pretty cool.\\n\\nMy company had a party here in the \\"Fight Room.\\"  This was a long room, divided into two sections.

High-brow and snobby though it may be, it's really fun--once in a very rare while--to use those skills.  So, when I chose to go to a restaurant at a hotel as nice as the Taj, I expected a performance.  I expected the waiters to know which side to put the plate down on and which side to take away a plate from, and the chefs to present the food on immaculately-clean plates, and the bussers to place new silverware out precisely.  I expected the sort of place that would care whether I put my elbows on the table, or how to negotiate the butter dish, or which fork to use.  I was really disappointed to have expected this kind of performance and to find it so completely absent.\\n\\nLooking back on it without expectations: That all being said, it was a tasty meal.  I'll definitely try my own hand at making prociutto-wrapped fresh figs (though I won't again pay $18 for a single fig and two slices of prociutto).  The salmon was perfectly cooked and the accompanying cold vegetable melange both delicious and seasonally-appropriate.  The three-citrus dessert was at first taste exquisite, though ultimately a little heavy for a summer sweet.\\n\\nI wish I could remember the name of our first waiter.  Stern-faced, discreet, and possessing of subtle humor, this older gentleman was marvelous.  He very delicately steered us away from dishes he suggested were disappointing (\\"I have never had the Indian food here, madam, but more than any other dish, the plates are abandoned still half-full.\\")  I suppose he could be experienced as snobby to those who don't know how to play the game back, but since he knew the act I had so hoped for, I found him absolutely wonderful.\\n\\nSo, the Taj Cafe in a sentence: tasty, over-priced, mediocre for the cost, mostly sloppy service for the cost, would not go back unless they stepped up their game.  There's a way to be old-fashioned and professional without being snobby, and I don't think the Taj Cafe has found that balance in either direction."},{"name":"Sinbad","address":"1968-1996 SW 4th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"We chose this cart specifically because there was a sign posted on the front that said if someone was hungry and could not afford a sandwich, one would be provided free of charge.

There was a nice aroma floating through the air of BBQ which made us even more hungry.  We chose the \\"all you can eat\\" option for $18.95 a plate and figured that three people could easily get through 2 servings each but we had to ask for a take home box.  It tasted fantastic.  Your telling yourself to eat slowly but you can't and before you know it you are full and somewhat disappointed that the experience is over with until the next time. The service was great too. There are actually two restaurants there and we ate in the one that could get us in the fastest. When we finished we went into the main dining area that has the open pit. One of the staff encouraged us to take several pictures which we did. When is the last time you went to a restaurant who let you into the cooking area? \\nWhat I found interesting is that they don't serve alcohol and they don't accept credit/debit cards which adds even more to  the mystique however you can bring your own beer.

Those who like vanilla custard very much liked the vanilla and fruit tart but I didn't care for it.  The raspberry chocolate tart was not what we expected with raspberry mousse under ganache - not exactly bad, but not good either.  The cup cakes were a COMPLETE disappointment.  We tried the oreo cupcake (or maybe it was called cookies and cream) and a Christmas sprinkles cupcake both cupcakes were extremely dry (maybe over baked) and the butter cream frosting tasted like a stick of butter - all in all completely inedible.  Not a single person in our party of six thought the cupcake was worth eating so both were tested and then thrown out.\\n\\nAs for the show, there were some songs played over the audio system and some lights flashed.  It did not seem like the lights were choreographed to the music which I think was the whole point as the lights were flashing in various patterns before the music.

We had a hard time getting bread at our TABLE!!!) we literally waited 15 minutes before we had to ask if we could order a drink. \\n\\nSo finally our table was ready, the gentleman working told one member of our party and I guess we were just expected to carry our own drinks over there, because we were def not going to get any help.\\n\\nServer arrives, we didn't even get a \\"Hello\\" or a \\"How are you?\\", in fact, we got no greeting at all.

Unfortunately our server was too busy.

According to Yelp! they open at 11:30am so Jeff G and I made the trip arriving at 11:50am when much to our chagrin we happened upon a shut window. Jeff G. can attest the look on my face upon seeing the awning down was equivalent to the time a child learns their parents' have been lying to them for years about Santa, The Easter Bunny, Tooth Fairy and their college fund. Jeff bravely stuck his head in the door and said they would be open at 12:30p. I was willing to wait but could tell by the look on his face he was done.\\n\\nI talked him into waiting the extra 45 minutes and we set out to search ice cream instead. Got to Coffee Can Cafe and learned they no longer existed! Bewildered and now 0 for 2 we settled on Albina Press to pass the time which served to be the best choice of the day!\\n\\nBut this about Cackalack's! I ordered a XXX Jalapy without Bacon, Cajun Fries and a Sweet Tea. \\"Sorry, we usually have Sweet Tea, but not today,\\" was the rejection I received in return.

My sandwich was devilishly hot! and although I ordered it with the XXX sauce and it was laced with jalapenos that isn't the hot I'm referring to. It was truly hot as if it were still cooking in the oil! Chicken is a tough thing to mess up but fried chicken is relatively easy! If you're oil is too hot it will burn the batter while keeping the center of the chicken soft. The batter on this particular sandwich could cut a diamond and the taste of burnt flour is one you don't soon forget. Upon the first bite I was disappointed and that memory of my parents telling me all the money they saved for my college fund didn't exist came rushing back! By the time I got half way through the sandwich the bread was falling apart along with the casing my chicken was housed in and with each \\"ker-plunk\\" onto the wax paper so went my chances of returning for this sandwich I had been longing.\\n\\nNot only did I leave totally dissatisfied and upset by my stomach also chimed in and levied its opinion later that day as well.

We were unsure where to eat at Legacy Place and wanted to step-up in class, so we chose this place.  My wife and I had eaten here about a year ago or so for brunch and it was quite good.  Anyway, we didn't have reservations, but the staff was able to sit us pretty easily as we were eating at 4:30-ish.  We sat down and one of the wait staff was ready to offer us water (sparkling or tap)...we chose tap.  For drinks we ordered a Merlot, Sam Adams Summer, Pomegranate Martini and an Organic Pale Ale.  The drinks were great.  For dinners, two of us ordered the seared Scallops with a roasted corn and bacon ragout with hard cider sauce. ( I had to check the menu online to remember the exact description. ) This was perhaps the best Scallop meal I have ever had. Every bite was scrumptious including the bacon and sauce and perfectly browned Scallops.  One of us ordered a Lobster Risotto, which was quite good.  My wife ordered the Swordfish with truffled cream spinach, garlic fried potatoes and bordelaise sauce. It was very good as well.  The bread was warm, fresh and crispy, although it showed up in a bag and required being ripped by hand.   The waitress offered us desserts, but we declined.  However, she overheard the three of us were celebrating birthdays, so she brought a dessert on the house with a candle - - Pain Perdu (crispy vanilla scented brioche with maple walnut icecream).  While I am not a big nut person, this dessert was outstanding - - imagine icecream on a crispy french toast - - we fought over the last bite.

For dinner, my wife had their specialty...the chimichanga...which had nothing but chicken inside and was covered in nasty white cheese sauce.  I had the mega burrito, which was a soupy mess.

The texture of the pork was too perfect and some parts mushy from handling. This texture of pulled pork only comes from 15+ hours of smoking however no bark indicates they boiled the meat. The collard greens had little flavor and the center stem was not removed before cooking. This made them very bitter. As for the mac & cheese, it was very heavy on my fork. This extra weight came from the large amount of Velveeta Cheese mixed into it. This place was more concerned with the football game than the quality of food they produced.

Although we had plenty of space at our table, the overall atmosphere of the dining room was a bit crowded. On the way to our table we had to squeeze past other tables and many of the tables in front of us seemed spaced a bit too closely. Also, it was rather warm. We decided to stay inside thinking there would be AC, but it didn't seem much cooler inside than it did outside. \\n\\nI enjoyed our food, especially the appetizers. My favorite was the sea scallops in Grand Marnier. They were perfectly cooked and served with orange slices. The melezane were also quite good. I was a bit disappointed with my entree, the fettucine strega. I had high hopes, but, frankly it tasted a bit processed. And, for $29, I'd rather try making something similar at home.

So when several readers suggested I visit Jean Pierre Bistro & Bakery, it was the perfect excuse to head out.\\n\\nI arranged to meet some friends who work near there and headed west on Interstate 4. Even though it was a weekday, the traffic was Sunday morning light. \\"Easy breezy,\\" I thought to myself as I turned onto Celebration Avenue off U.S. Highway 192.\\n\\nI cruised into the coiffed downtown area and pulled into a parking spot in front of Celebration Town Tavern to e-mail my friends that I had arrived but I needed to circle one more time as I had not yet spotted the eatery in the town center. There were many restaurants that offered intriguing international tastes including Thai Thani, Seito Sushi, Columbia, Shannon's of Celebrationand Cafe D'Antonio -- but nothing with a French accent.\\n\\nThen I checked my e-mail and -- to my embarrassment -- learned from my patiently waiting friends that I was in the wrong place.\\n\\nLike a lot of locals who only occasionally visit this corner of northwest Osceola County, when I hear \\" Celebration\\" I mistakenly zero in on the businesses in town center.\\n\\nJean Pierre Bistro & Bakery is in Water Tower Place (wtpcelebration.com). The Key West-inspired complex is also home to Le China, Mulligan's Pub, Chick-Fil-A, Cold Stone Creamery, Joe's Crab Shack and Planet Smoothie and assorted shops and businesses.\\n\\nOutside Jean Pierre there are a few caf√© tables.

My guests were waiting at a window seat and we quickly got down to the business of lunch. All foodies, we ordered a variety of things to share because we always end up stealing off each other's plates.\\n\\nThe buttery, nicely textured French pate ($9.95) was served with freshly-baked French bread, crisp, sweet baby gherkins and grapes. The classic salade nicoise ($9.50) was a lovely composed platter of flavorful tomato wedges, red onion rings, black olives, hard-cooked egg wedges, slender crisp-tender French green beans, artichoke hearts, boiled white potatoes, button mushroom slices and beautifully salty anchovies.\\n\\nThe single-serving of quiche lorraine ($5.95) had a rich, creamy egg custard laced with a good balance of Swiss cheese and chopped bacon. A light flavor note of nutmeg harmonized nicely with the classic ingredients.\\n\\nOur lunch spread was completed with a baguette sandwich loaded with sweet ham, brie, ultra-fresh mixed greens and tomato slices ($6.25).\\n\\nFamily-run Jean Pierre Bistro & Bakery is open daily for breakfast, lunch and dinner. The friendly and gracious service is best described as European-leisurely, making it a nice find near a busy thoroughfare of American quick-serve eateries.\\n\\nOwner and chef Jean-Pierre's Cervello's ever-evolving menu covers the French classics quite nicely.

I give the restaurant credit for going beyond the normal standard wing flavours for people to choose from, but when you deep fry your chicken wings you often bite into crusty bits of chicken. \\n\\nWhether this place keeps within the downtown bar service tradition but the service was less than friendly. \\n\\nPeople seem to want to search high and low for a place that serves the best chicken wings in each city.

I will visit again.\\n\\nService is fast-food style: order at a window, fill your drink, and pick it up when your number is called.  The menu is burgers and sandwiches, as well as \\"platters\\" of traditional comfort food like chicken-fried steak and catfish.  I came for a burger.\\n\\nYou choose the kind of burger you want, adding on lettuce, tomatoes, and so on at a toppings bar.  The burger is a greasy flat-grilled affair with a nice grilled bun, also greasy.  The beef tasted fresh and the cheese was good.  I thought the bun might be too soft but it held strong all the way to the end.  The signs all said the buns were made fresh daily (we'll get to the signs in a minute).  The toppings bar was fast-food standard: iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, onions, pickles, and jalapenos.  Most of it was fresh; the tomatoes were unripe.\\n\\nThe fries are battered and mine had a greasy-yet-crispy texture.  I would have preferred plain old naked Idaho's but I ate them anyway.\\n\\nMy burger combo was about $7, which is their average combo price.  I can't imagine ordering anything but a sandwich here.  The platters will surely shorten your life.\\n\\nFor this kind of burger in this price range, there are similar options like P. Terry's and In-N-Out only blocks away.  Not much further south on Guadalupe is Dirty's at the same price point.  For a beer and an old-fashioned greasy burger I would choose Dirty's over Burger Tex. For a fresh fast-food burger I would choose P. Terry's.  Why come back?  They have a Bulgogi burger (Korean grilled marinated beef) I want to try on my next visit, something you don't see elsewhere.\\n\\nAmbience?  The interior is sad, like a faded old pizza parlor.  Signs are everywhere boasting of being chosen \\"Best Burger\\" by the Austin Chronicle.  In 2004.  I was there early afternoon and I was the only patron when I arrived.\\n\\nLike other reviewers experienced, on my visit the manager/owner was an angry fellow.  Because I had read the reviews before going, I felt prepared.  There's no avoiding him because he takes your order and your money.  It's laughable really, because it's like dealing with Seinfeld's Soup Nazi.  As I ate my lunch I listened to him berate a job applicant at the counter.  There are signs posted everywhere: \\"Napkins are HERE!\\" and \\"Don't ask for extra take-out cartons!\\" and \\"Don't bother the kitchen staff!\\"  I was careful to read everything, not make a mess at my table, and put my used tray back in its designated location.\\n\\nLike I said, they make a good old-fashioned greasy burger.

Instead of te skinny little things that come in the grocery store tin (you can make haystacks with 'em!), they provide a bowl of thick, crunchy fried noodles that had an intense and addictive flavor.\\n\\nEven the disposable chopsticks were a step up from the basic model, with two smoothly tapered wooden chopsticks instead of the splintery things you have to break apart at the top.\\n\\nThe staff were very nice, and went out of their way to ensure we had a great experience.\\n\\nFinally, the price was about half what we would have considered normal.\\n\\nWe've had a lot of Thai food over the years.

He has an extremely flamboyant personality, which is okay some venues, but it didn't fit with the fine dining decor and we just wanted to be left alone. He couldn't take a hint, though, and kept at it. He also warned us that there was a gaggle of attorneys in the restaurant nearby and rolled his eyes. Okay, not a problem, right? Five minutes later: \\"Check, check, check\\". Seriously, these guys were going to give a mic'd presentation in the middle of this restaurant? I mean, sure, the place was deserted with the exception of the attorneys and us, but still... were they trying to drive away the remainder of their business?\\n\\nOkay, so the ambience sucked. What about the food? We ordered the conch fritters to start, which tasted generally fine, although they were overdone and tasted a bit burnt. They were plated with what appeared to be Cheese Whiz squirted all over somewhat wilted chopped salad. It looked gross, but tasted quite good... a blend of mustard and mayo. Then we tackled the $11 single crabcake. It was served on top of some more crappy salad, with a pool of something that looked like ketchup and dijon mustard on the side. The sauce was actually \\"habenero mojo\\" and tasted good, but again, looked gross. \\n\\nWe then split the mariscos en chipotle. The bowl had a very stiff looking mound of white rice in the middle, surrounded by a moat of a pink cream sauce and invertebrate seafood poking out of it. Some old grated carrots adorned the rim of the bowl. The cream sauce had a light kick to it - delightful, really, but was weighted down by the craptastically dry rice and the seafood. The \\"hockey puck\\" scallops were more like the size of a dollar coin, several of which were broken in the kitchen. The seafood generally tasted okay, except for something we called the Seafood Baby - it seemed to have arms and a tail and a head. It had a strange gelatinous texture. Apparently, it was once a piece of lobster tail, but had mutated into something else in the kitchen. \\n\\nWe got the check, and noticed that our party of two had automatically had a 20% tip added.

Maybe, maybe not. It's an area that is a hot button issue for burger enthusiasts, because if you are going to be cooking copious amounts of burgers at your restaurant, you should probably be nailing the temps on a consistent basis. If you order a steak and it is not cooked the want you wanted it, it's getting sent back, one would presume, but burgers sometimes get a free pass. Maybe it's a price issue with burgers being on the more affordable spectrum (usually), so it's less of an issue. Where am I going with this? I lean somewhere on the side that it has to be more about the general flavor and enjoyment of the overall burger. Do I want my burger cooked a perfect medium-rare? No doubt about it, and the better spots will hit that temp each and every time, and I'd be foolish into trying to convince you that it's not a factor in my overall grading scale, because it absolutely is. However, if the burger is juicy, seasoned and has the proper meat to bun ratio, I'll take that over a perfectly executed patty with no seasoning or substance. Long story short, and I'm sure you can guess where I'm going with this, Brass Union in Somerville makes a very tasty burger, but on this inaugural visit, medium-rare it was not. \\n\\nThe cheeseburger, with grass-fed beef, Cabot cheddar, onion marmalade and green aioli is hefty and has value at $13. This is a small plates menu, however, and it always makes me chuckle when I see a burger on such a menu because I want it all to myself. Even my favorite, Alden and Harlow, has a small plates focus, which to me doesn't scream burger but who am I to say. The Brass Union burger is served on the played-out black pepper brioche from Iggy's, but the thick and meaty patty is wedged in nicely, and the freshness of the bun does in fact fit the bill. A well balanced char brings out just enough background smokey notes, but the patty is very close to a medium-well with one or two pockets of rare for good measure. But the seasoning is dead-on; it's juicy, succulent and meaty, and the thin bottom half of the bun just barely holds together with consistent juices all the way through. Melted cheese plays along too; it's enough to complement but still puts the meat at the head of the class. Onion marmalade is merely caramelized onions and they are delicious if a little heavy handed. A green aioli is actually very white with few speckles of herbage, and tastes a little sweet for my tastebuds, especially in conjunction with the marmalade. Skin-on fries are piping hot, creamy in the center and all you need from a fry, minus a minor dusting of salt.\\n\\nThis is essentially a very good pub burger in disguise but aside from the cookery of the meat, it is more than serviceable and flavorful.

The sandwich's taste was fine, but the veggie burger was so soft that its texture was virtually identical to the hummus that was also on the sandwich.

My coworker at Starbucks One Financial recommended it to me.  The first time I had a falafel wrap there, I was a little bewildered by the length of the line and pleasantly surprised by the fact that I was immediately handed a  free falafel during my (very short) wait.  That first bite literally changed my life and ruined me for all future falafel.\\n\\n Thereafter would gladly hoof it from my Starbucks (at South Station) all the way to Winter Street and back on my half-hour lunch break to get me and my coworkers lunch.  Even though I did have to inhale my wrap in the five minutes remaining on my break when I returned.\\n\\nThese guys don't mess around.  You show up, wait in a line that looks ridiculous at first glance, munch a falafel, and have your food in ten minutes, max.  The speed with with they put together your plate or sandwich is, frankly, astonishing.  The employees will even briefly chit-chat in the thirty seconds it takes their hands to assemble your deliciousness.  They are incredibly efficient.\\n\\nI quickly became obsessed with the pickles.  I am not sure why, but I love them.  They're the perfect foil to soft bread, the crisp exterior and fluffy, tender interior and perfect spice blend of the falafel and the creaminess of the hummus - a nice, cool, salty, tangy crunch.  I always ask for extra.\\n\\nIt makes me sad that I now live in Roslindale and work in Longwood Medical Area.  Falafel King spoiled me.  No other place will ever quite live up to it.  Especially the REALLY crappy falafel/Middle Eastern/Greek place in the Longwood Galleria.\\n\\nYou know, I was inspired to write this review after watching an episode of \\"Throwdown\\" where Bobby attempted to beat a former employee at the falafel game.

The gambas al ajillo is a standard order in any spanish tapas place and Kika's did not disappoint. The braised duck was perfectly cooked with the meat literally falling off the bones- just the way it should be. And finally, the lamb meatballs in truffle cream sauce was perfection itself.

It was a perfect place for an after work dinner on the first warm day of spring. My co-worker and I had only heard amazing things, so we had high expectations. \\n\\nAlthough the place is small we were seated right away by the window. Our waiter was very attentive and VERY knowledgable. Since it was our first time, we really were kind of clueless on how the menu worked and what to order. \\n\\nFor a drink, we went with a pitcher of their new summer sangria. It was a red based with hints of orange and lemon. It was definitely a good choice, it was $26 and it gave each of us (3) about 2 glasses.\\n\\nFor food We started with their specialty, a cutting board with your choice of porks, cheeses,  and jellies that are individually chosen off the menu. No matter what you choose it comes with pickles, crostinis, and two spreads. \\n\\nWith a little help from our waiter we ended up choosing two pork options and two cheeses. There were three of us and we all fall weak to a good prosciutto so that was a no brainer. We chose the Prosciutto di San Daniele (aged 20 months) and the Finocchiona (sausage) with the waiters recommendation. For cheese we chose a goat cheese, Tr√©s Bonne (from VT) and also with the waiters recommendation a Manchego sheep cheese. We also chose a side of smoked shallot marmalade and Fig Jam. \\n\\nWe could NOT be more pleased with our choices. The portions were perfect for 3 people and everything was delicious, The prosciutto was sliced super thin and full of flavor not overwhelmed with salt like many are. Our sausage choice was similar to a chorizo with hints of garlic. The pickles were sweet and delightful, and the spread options made for a perfect little stack. The goat cheese we chose was mild and soft, and the sheep was a sharp, hard flavor similar to a hard sharp cheddar. \\n\\nWe also decided to split a pizza to get a taste of what their entrees are all about. (plus, after our second pitcher of sangria we were there to stay). We went with something less traditional, the broccoli rabe which was Ricotta Salata, Lemon Peel, Roasted Garlic, and Chili Flake. To be honest I'm really not a fan of ricotta and this BLEW MY MIND. it was such a unique combination of flavors, and the ricotta was the best part. The crust was very brick-oven-esque (we did see the brick oven on our way out)  and it did not disappoint. \\n\\nThe prices are reasonable, its a fun friendly atmosphere, and the service was really outstanding.

You are looking at around 23-24$ for a pizza after taxes, depending on what you get, so yes, I must admit it's pretty pricey. Butttt it is so worth it!! Just go when you feel like treating yourself and with like 2 friends.

So, I made my order at 10:35pm- a gyro, soda, and cookie.  (Mistake #1, the guy who took my order, never told me how long it was going to take)\\n\\n...At 11:21pm, I'm still waiting, so I call the guy back who took my order and asked him, politely, what the status on my delivery was--I had not gotten my food.  He then told me normally it takes 45 minutes and my food should be there right around NOW--the delivery girl had left already.\\n\\n...Another 25 minutes and I'm still waiting....I call back and no one picks up!  So, I called 2 more times and the same guy finally answers.  I am a little more than peeved at this point, because I ask him again, what's the status and its been almost another half hour and my food is STILL not here!  He then tells me that the delivery girl had 3 orders, she went out on a bike, and he could not get ahold of her because her cell phone went straight to voicemail.  Ok....so what does that mean for me?  Basically I confirmed with him that really neither him nor I really knew when my order was going to arrive. (Mistake #2 and #3- Hire somebody with a car and it is not my responsibility if your worker's cell phone is out)\\n\\nFinally at 11:55pm, the delivery girl shows up.  No apology, nothing.  Gives me the food and asks me to sign my bill.  I ask her for a pen and she doesn't even have one!  (Mistake #4:  If you are delivering food and want a tip...you might want to carry a pen!)  At this point, I was annoyed for many reasons.  So, I went in, find a pen, sign the bill and decided to take the extra $2 charged for delivery off and leave no tip.  Yes, I not only take off $2, but I leave the girl no tip.  However, I will pay for the food.  I don't feel they deserved the delivery charge nor any tip for this.\\n\\nSo, by now, I'm starved and want to devour.  I eat the pita and honestly, what could I expect-----ingredients were fresh, but the gyro was cold and somewhat soggy by now.  I feel they are not even justified in asking me to pay for the food now.\\n\\nUnpleasant experience and unpleasant meal.  Will I order again?  Probably not.  If I want to be fair, I may try again or just avoid the delivery catastrophe and pick up myself next time.\\n\\nBottom line: Mistake #5: The business should take responsibility for their own lack of knowledge of what's going on.

It was Saturday around 5:30-6pm, we scored a parking spot right in front and had just a few minutes to wait for a table to be set up on the outdoor patio. It was super hot that weekend, so being outside wasn't great, but at least we were in the shade. \\nThis was my first time having Pok Pok dishes, so of course we had to order Ike's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings. These were crunchy, sticky, salty, and fishy. The perfect food for drinking something cold when it's hot and muggy out. Next time I'll try the spicy version, but I may have regrets! \\nAs there were 3 of use, we opted to do family dining rather than individual plates. We ordered Yam Makheua Yao (charcoal grilled eggplant with egg, fish sauce, dry shrimp, prawn, and pork), Kaeng Hang Leh (pork belly and shoulder curry), and 3 orders of sticky rice (they come in the CUTEST basket cup thingees I've ever seen! The yam makeheua yao was exceptional - the grilled eggplant chunks were deliciously smokey and a very unique charcoal flavor. Along with prawns and pork, it was super tasty. The kaeng hang leh came out in a cast iron pot and it was a thin sauced curry, still bubbling away on the edges. This paired really well with the sticky rice and hit the spot for a meaty and savory bite. Since a majority of dishes are meant to be shared, I had hoped that the rice order would have been a large bowl, but instead it's an individual cup. There was an ok amount in there, but I would have loved to have more rice especially for the kaeng hang leh. I was a little sad to see all that wonderful curry sauce left in the pot go back to the kitchen. \\nFor drinks we ordered the salted plum vodka collins, lao saparot (pineapple rice whiskey shot), and drinking vinegars in tamarind and turmeric. I loved my turmeric drinking vinegar, it was crisp, refreshing and actually gave me a bit more energy after a long day trekking around downtown. I also had the lao saparot because it sounded interesting. The pineapple sweetness balanced out the bite from the rice whiskey, but the shot as a whole was soft going down. \\nOverall,my first trip to Pok Pok was excellent and I would love to go back again. It's definitely a place to go for unique dishes and to eat at one's leisure. The staff were friendly and not overly attentive, which is how I like it. The restaurant was pretty full when we arrived and by the time we left the waiting area was packed. I'll definitely be back to this location as it's closer to home. I need to also visit Pok Pok Noi, which is close for me heading eastward from NoPo."},{"name":"McCormick & Schmick's Seafood Restaurant","address":"401 Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"We went for a lunch meeting, the waiter took a long time to take our order, then we all ordered the gumbo.

The lot is tiny, cramped, and not ideal for a full plaza as this is. Additionally, there was a 20 minute wait, with lots of people in the waiting area. What I was confused about it, why there were 5-6 open tables, all clean and ready to go. Quite confusing, and later they said for the last few weeks, the kitchen and waitress' have both been somewhat understaffed (something they should really fix). After waiting, they gave my party a table in the bar area, separate from basically everything else in the restaurant. 5 minutes later, Marla came over, who was extremely friendly, kind, and helpful (as said above), and asked us about drinks. Drinks & bread were fast (and make sure to get bread if you go to any Bertucci's), but other than that everything else was slow. I would like to emphasize that NONE of this was the Waitress' fault, whatsoever. I witnessed her writing down everything correctly. The KITCHEN is at fault. The table closest to us, who arrived 10 minutes after my party did, received their  pizza, while I was still waiting. When asking the manager about it, she knew nothing about it and went to go look into it , and the pizza arrived a few minutes later. The pizza wasn't correct, yet they made another one anyway and the manager took care of the purchase, and made us still feel as very valued customers. Marla, Jennifer, and Meghan are the best employees here!! Definitely a fine restaurant, and they will fix anything that isn't correct, but I still wouldn't suggest going on a Saturday night. Overall, 3 stars. I probably won't be coming all the way back to Braintree, because of the understaffing and wait times, for a while, and would suggest other Bertucci's locations over this one (Norwood, Needham, Holliston, etc, etc). 3 stars. \\n\\n\\nUpdate : 4/27/2016\\nManagement contacted me regarding the survey I completed on my receipt from my experience in this Braintree store. They were friendly and really wanted to make things right in the future for me and the rest of their customers.

I went with the quiche and some coffee. They take your order and ask for your first name and initial, then you awkwardly mill about waiting for them to call your name, and wondering, as in my case, whether they forgot about you as it seemed to take longer than I would have expected.

After doing my usual Yelp search to check out reviews and the menu ahead of time, I saw the 3-star average and was a little concerned about the numerous 2-star reviews from fellow Elites.  However, my friend had been here numerous times and assured me that it was good, so I *tried* to be optimistic.\\n\\nI'm not sure if they take reservations at all, but our group of 12 did not have a reservation when we arrived a little after 8 pm on a Friday night.  The hostess showed frustration when we changed our initial wait for 10 people to 12 because she said a table was available for 10.  We couldn't quite understand why we couldn't just add two chairs to it, but oh well.  So after waiting about 45 minutes to be seated, we were finally led to our tables.\\n\\nOur server handed us the menus fairly quickly, and it didn't take everyone very long to decide on what they wanted to order.  I, along with maybe five others in our group, decided to order the Carne a la parrilla (Hanger Steak) because one of my friends had raved about it.  Some people ordered beers, and some of us ordered margaritas.\\n\\nSoon after we ordered our drinks, our server brought us complimentary tortilla chips and salsa.  Yum!  I thought the chips tasted pretty fresh, and although the salsa contained cilantro (yeah, I know, most salsas do!), I ate around it and thought it was good.  My friends and I dug into the chips, stole our friends' chips, and asked for an extra basket as well.  Yes, we were starving after the long wait for a table.\\n\\nThen, we waited...\\n\\n...and waited...\\n\\nWe probably waited for about 15 minutes or so for JUST our drinks!!!  Not good.  When I finally got my frozen Strawberry Margarita ($7.99), the glass was wet and sticky from the margarita spilling as the server brought it over.  =P  Thankfully, however, the margarita was pretty good.\\n\\nSince the drinks had taken so long to be served, we got our food soon afterwards.\\n\\n*Carne a la parrilla (Hanger Steak - $13.69) - Per the menu description, this is \\"Grilled hanger steak, jalape√±o mac & cheese, corn, jalape√±o, red onions, chimichurri.\\"  Since I hate raw onions, I had requested for none on my steak.  However, the server (or maybe it was the chef who prepared my meal) kindly provided the corn and onions in a vinegary sauce on the side so that I could get a taste of both.  I'm SO glad they did that!  I enjoyed the corn, and I liked my medium-cooked steak dipped in the sauce.  The jalapeno mac 'n cheese was simple yet delicious!  I enjoyed my meal immensely and would definitely order this again.\\n\\nFYI, I noticed menu item price differences between the actual menu in the restaurant and the prices displayed in the online menu.  For example, the menu online shows that a frozen strawberry margarita costs $6.99, but it was actually $7.99.  However, the Carne a la parilla was actually $13.69 vs. $14.69 online.\\n\\nOverall, Pure Taqueria gets 3.5 stars for their good food and tasty frozen strawberry margarita.  I happily took advantage of the Foursquare deal - 15% off for your first check-in!  Although our server, Marc, was very friendly and had no problem providing us separate checks, I had to knock of 1.5 stars because of the super SLOW service (on top of how long it took to get a table).  I would return if my friend wanted to eat here again, but it's not necessarily a place I would go out of my way for.\\n\\n[Review 200 of 366]"},{"name":"New Seasons Market - Slabtown","address":"2170 NW Raleigh St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Absolutely love this market.

All the pizzas have similar qualities.  First, the ingredients are top notch and full of flavor.  2nd, the crust's underwhelming, cardboard-y flavor is completely subdued by the fact that is burnt and blackened everywhere.  So the crust ends up tasting like the smoke of wood chips.  This would be OK if the pizza wasn't 80% crust by volume.

While my husband and I were not hungry, she did not allow us to share a dish and made us order two dishes.  We were only able to finish one dish and had nearly a whole pizza leftover.  \\n\\nWhen we asked to split the bill, the waitress said she would try.  She came back with the split check, but an added 20% gratuity on each bill!  And we were a party of four!  When we asked to talk to the manager to have the automatic tip removed, he first said they charge an automatic gratuity for parties of 5 and larger (which I think is quite a low start).  But when we counted out our party of FOUR to him, he gave us an excuse that they cannot do it now that the bill has been split.  \\n\\nAnd worst off, when we left the restaurant, the waitress ambushed us, berating us, saying we should have told her we wanted to split the bill when we first sat down to eat.  \\n\\nATMOSPHERE: \\nFor a restaurant in the North End, I was quite disappointed.  It looked like a run-of-the-mill chain Italian restaurant -- similar to an Olive Garden or Macaroni Grill.

The fettucine Bolognese was mediocre -- I have had better.  The margherita did not look like a typical margherita and more like a plain cheese pizza.  The Quattro staggioni was strange and had all the toppings separated into different sections instead of spread out evenly.  The insalata pizza was okay, but the prosciutto was slightly salty. And there are no refills on fountain drinks.\\n\\n\\nI am extremely unhappy with this restaurant and will never come back.  Please do not go here.

I really despise the family-style seating, so luckily the man and I were able to grab 2 seats away from the madness. \\nSo the pizza comes, and while it is much different from any pizza I've ever had, it was pretty much amazing. We had just a regular with pepperoni, whatever. The soft spots in the middle were the best part. I think that was grease soaking through the dough. Whatever it was, it tasted great.\\nThe reason I gave only 3 stars is because we both got sick, like have to stay at home sick, right after eating the pizza. Yes, I realize there are many explanations for being ill, but it's hard to get past the fact that we ate it right beforehand.

The overall size of the roll when wrapped was very slim, the steak was definitely not loaded into the roll like a real one would be, and there were raw onions and no mushrooms.  The roll itself was cold, maybe from a refrigerator where they keep them?  Then when I bit into the steak there was a cold piece of american cheese slapped in the middle of the warm steak.  The steak itself was okay, nothing too bad, definitely seemed better than steak ems, just not real well flavored.  The fries were typical, nothing special served in a small styrofoam bowl with cheese on the side.

The only downside was the bun. A top quality burger like this deserves a good bun, unfortunately this was not a top quality bun. The fries and onion rings that came with my order were great.

I don't like to really eat like that the rest of the year, but New Year's is special. Plus, New Year's often has so much hype that I like to plan something unflappably good. For me, an amazing, special meal is always a good experience.\\n\\nThis year, I chose Terramia, a small and cozy Italian restaurant in Boston's North End that had solidly good reviews but that wasn't exorbitant. (In my mind, any meal that costs more than $100 per person before drinks and tips is exorbitant.) They had a prix fixe menu of four courses, including prosecco and an amuse bouche.\\n\\nI know some people don't like prix fixe menus, but they appeals to me in two ways. One, I know from working in a restaurant that prix fixe meals make things a lot easier on staff, which I feel pretty good about on a holiday that everyone celebrates. Secondly, I like being surprised! There are always things on a prix fixe menu that I wouldn't choose for myself, but I tend to like almost anything, and I like the idea that the chef has given thought to exciting combinations for me.\\n\\nIn the case of Terramia, many of the courses had a choice, so my date and I swore solemnly that we would not order any of the same things, so as to be able to taste as many options as possible. It made choosing the wine tricky, but the meal was phenomenal.\\n\\nThe Amuse Bouche was a \\"Crostini Con Funghi,\\" which meant toasted bread with mushroom spread on top. Although my date Catherine and I both tsked-tsked the size of the amuse (should be small enough to eat in one bite), we both really liked it. The goat cheese and truffle oil in the pistachio pesto didn't hurt.\\n\\nFor the Antipasti, Catherine had \\"Anatra\\" (no idea what that means--but it was smoked duck breast) while I had the \\"Zuppa Di Funghi E Castagne\\" (wild mushroom and chestnut soup with truffle oil and goat cheese). I liked Catherine's duck okay, but the soup changed my life. I'd never had chestnuts in a soup before! The whole thing was smoky and warm and creamy and basically utterly delicious.\\n\\nFor the Primi, Catherine went with the risotto (with rock shrimp and crab meat) and I dove into the homemade fig ravioli. Both quite good. The figs were a surprising sweetness, but they blended well with the pork and mushrooms. (If you're seeing a mushroom theme here, you're catching on to why I picked the place.)\\n\\nFor the Secondi, I went straight for the rack of lamb, which had all sorts of traditionally delicious things (caramelized onions, reduction, etc), though no mushrooms. Catherine had the Chilean Sea Bass, which I was pretty jealous of; normally I don't order seafood at non-seafood restaurants, since it's so often dry and flavorless. But Catherine's bass was amazing. Could have been the lobster reduction, but my personal hunch is that it was fresh and cooked to perfection.\\n\\nFor dessert, I was torn. The \\"Piastra del Formaggio\\" (cheese plate) sounded perfect, but that was what Catherine was itching for. The only other option was tiramisu, which I've never really liked. Too heavy. But we had this deal going not to order the same thing, so I bit my tongue and ordered it. Boy, was I glad I did. I have never, ever, ever eaten such delicious tiramisu! Everything was light and sweet and perfect. It practically floated up to my mouth. A delicious ending to a fantastic meal."},{"name":"The Chiam Restaurant","address":"12890 NW Cornell Rd","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Me Andy husband went here but we are not planing on going back after they charged us 50c for chopsticks. Very poor service and food is average"},{"name":"Surly Girl Saloon","address":"1126 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"This is by far my favorite place in Columbus! The food is fabulous and the drinks are unique, but the atmosphere is what does it for me!\\n\\nFirst let's talk food. There's some variety there, everything from pizza to cupcakes to mac & cheese. My personal favorite is the BBQ Chicken Salad...perfect! It's huge and drizzled with BBQ sauce, but then comes with a side of southwestern ranch that you can add yourself. Probably not one of those \\"healthy salads,\\" but who cares when it's this good? Also packed with everything else you'd expect on a southwestern-style salad, including crispy fried onions, which makes it all worthwhile. It comes with two huge pieces of bread that's kind of herby and a bit dry, but it's great to gnaw on while enjoying a beer.\\n\\nLast time I ate at Surly Girl I tried the Cherry Cola Ribs - they were great! Not the best ribs I've ever had, but they were worth it and certainly tasted a little like cherries. Also try the hummus plate - the spicy red bean hummus is sooooooo good, you'll wonder why you don't eat healthy like that everyday.\\n\\nAs far as drinks go, Surly Girl has the best selection of mixed drinks that you can't get anywhere else. Every season features 5 or 6 new ones that the bartenders probably make up. Last time we tried Death in the Afternoon - a mix of champagne, cranberry and absinthe. Now, I hate the licorice taste of Absinthe, but the other flavors seemed to mask it well enough because I was able to drink it. And for $7, it really wasn't a bad deal. They also have a great beer selection, including my personal favorite, Abita Purple Haze. They also serve Great Lakes and Lindeman's and Piraat!\\n\\nThe interior is awesome - go see it if you haven't - everything has a reddish glow and an antique feel, but if you look closely you'll find scorpions on the wallpaper and skulls here and there. It's a little dark but welcoming, and the service is pretty friendly. The music is also the greatest, with a jukebox so patrons can choose what they want, usually playing punk, rock or indie tunes. \\n\\nIt can get kinda pricey here, so if you're going out for dinner and drinks I'd recommend that you don't go too crazy. It can also get really crowded on Friday and Saturday nights. Like standing room only crowded.\\n\\nI also go to Surly every week for Punk Rock Aerobics on Tuesday nights, a fun and free activity that'll really make you sweat. The instructors aren't professionals, but they are great at what they do and are the nicest and most down-to-earth people! If you're looking to start a fitness plan, I recommend checking it out, although it's a small space - the back room of the restaurant. However, it is closed off so it's not like you have diners staring at you. And, you get to work out to The Ramones, The Pixies, etc! How fun is that? And, for participating in PRA, you get specials on the hummus plate and PBRs afterwards, so you can pile on all those pounds that you just burned off.\\n\\nSurly Girl also features other events different nights of the week. One Saturday we went and did their costume karaoke, where you dressed in their collection of wigs and crazy clothes and then went and did your thing on stage. Hilarious. In closing, Surly's got the whole package. If you haven't been here, I recommend it a million times over."},{"name":"Olive Cafe","address":"43 Gore St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"This was my all time favorite place to eat in the area , new ownership has brought Lowe quality food and ridiculous prices 2.50 for a 16 ounce Powerade!

This is seriously the most peaceful (even when it's full!) place I have eaten in the area.\\n\\nFirst off, the food: \\nI am in love with their curry.  The stewed beef is perfect.  The pickled garnish adds colour and a little tart afterthought.  The food is dreamy.  I especially love the Doria.  I'm a cheddar girl personally.  I want to try it with the egg but haven't done so yet.  \\n\\nSecond:\\nThe service.  The guy who runs the place is absolutely charming and very willing to explain this whole foreign concept of Japanese curry comfort food to the average customer.  He came around to our office earlier this week to offer coupons to his business.  I  can't say I wasn't interested.  I love it when people are proactive about learning about their local market.  I am the perfect target, I always bite when given a sample or some coupons.\\n\\nThird:\\nI can't stress how much I love this location and seating.  Some of the seats - the best seats in my opinion - are traditional Japanese style, lots of space, folded bamboo, little steps where you leave your shoes behind.  Most of the seats are normal, comfortable chairs at tables.  The place is very clean and well cared for.  And the best part is, the rows on the sides of the restaurant of Japanese literature available to the customer.  Today, I picked up lunch here and there was a book next to my seat - Norwegian Wood, by Haruki Murakami.  I started reading it while I waited for my Doria, and when it arrived, I was already really into the book and sat there my entire lunch period engrossed in the text.

They also serve beer and cocktails. I had the Taco Salad without the cheese and my cohort had Green Chile Enchiladas with an added egg. You can choose mild, medium, or hot green chile. He went medium, which was great, but will definitely go hot next time! After trying several \\"New Mexican\\" places around town we are so stoked about Adobe Rose! We'll definitely be back!\\nAfter reading other reviews I think some are unduly harsh. Do I feel like I'm sitting in A New Mexican restaurant eating the cuisine? No. Of course not. You need to go to NM for that. Do I think this is the closest thing to home that I've found thus far in the Pacific NW? Yes! And I'm super happy to have found it."},{"name":"Atlanta Breakfast Club","address":"249 Ivan Allen Jr Blvd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"My family and I thoroughly enjoyed our dining experience at the Atlanta Breakfast Club. 7 of the 8 of us ordered something different and all of us were very happy with our choices.

Not fresh. \\n\\nThe girl at the counter has an attitude problem. She handed my sub to go. I asked her for a bag, and she sorta threw it. It really is her job to put the sub in the bag. I decided I will not go back."},{"name":"Barcelona Inman Park","address":"240 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"If you're looking for tapas, look no further.\\n\\nHowever, one of the first things that caught my attention was the extensive wine list. Although my party didn't order any alcohol, the wine list here is great and they also have cocktails, beer, and pitchers of Sangria.  \\n\\nNow onto the tapas--we had the grilled quail breast and grilled lamb chops. The grilled lamb chops were okay. I wasn't crazy about the Romesco sauce (although it probably was very healthy) that it came with but the meat itself was juicy. The quail was a lot better in my opinion. It was just as juicy and also came with a more delicious, sweeter sauce. On top of that, we had the grilled Churrasco, a flank steak dish--yes, we were carnivores that night--along with sweet potato French fries. Now the meat was cooked to medium-rare, but the dish fell a little short of okay. It didn't taste like that great a cut.\\n\\nAlthough I was not too impressed with my most recent visit, I was thoroughly impressed during my first visit where I had some of the other tapas."},{"name":"MAD Greens - Lakeway","address":"2011 Main St, Ste 400","city":"Lakeway","stars":"4","text":"Enjoy their salads.

Lola seems like an absolutely wonderful person and some of the food was fantastic ... but some of it, not so much. The black eyed peas were especially mushy, which I hate, and the food was all served piled on top of itself, which I also hate. The ambiance was also a little weird -- a creepy doll of Louis Armstrong stared at me the entire time I ate my meal and the purple paint on the walls was definitely applied in a faux-artistic style. There's also a lot of Bible quotes and Jesus graffiti, including this: \\"Shotcaller. Jesus is.\\" I couldn't get the image of Jesus as mob enforcer out of my mind. \\n\\nBut the roux for the gumbo was fantastic, like I said -- the only reason I didn't have gumbo was because it was chicken sausage, which I generally don't like, instead of seafood, which I absolutely love. The shrimp I got were huge and the breading was very tasty.  In fact, let me talk about the roux some more.  Anyone who knows cajun food knows that gumbo is all about the roux, which usually takes a full day to make by itself and it's why most people just use a pre-made roux.  I grew up with a authentic cajun stepmother, so I'm pretty picky about gumbo and I usually won't even bother trying it because making a good gumbo is so difficult and takes so much time that most people can't get it right.  This might be the best gumbo I've had outside of my stepmother's kitchen.  The rest of the food I tried seemed authentically cajun, and I have no reason to think that the rest of it wouldn't be.  \\n\\nThe reason this didn't get five stars from me is that I really was disappointed in the sides and the way the food was served."},{"name":"Antico Forno","address":"93 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Excellent food here. The service was a tad bit slow, but that was most likely due to the number of soccer fans there for the Euro cup. Got the gnocchi with melted mozzarella - really spectacular.

Everyone I have spoken to had nothing but praise for the establishment and I truly looked forward to trying it out.  Overall I have no complaints.  I was aware going in that this was a very expensive restaurant so I wasn't super shocked by $18.00 apps and $37.00 entrees.  We ended up getting a last minute reservation in the lounge.  It was fine, I've enjoyed better lounge type dining but I don't think I've had better lounge service.  \\n\\nFrom the moment we walked in the door we were greeted by extremely friendly waitstaff, our coats were taken for us, and our table was ready immediately.  Our server was very friendly and helpful yet not overbearing and she dealt with my grandparents well who can be a bit old-fashioned.  \\n\\nThe oysters I ordered were delicious.  I was hesitant at first because they were described as coming with a candied lemon topping, which threw me, but they really pulled it off.  The wine I had was also very good but for $12.00 per glass they were a little on the smaller side.  All of our entrees were wonderful and cooked perfectly.  This is the kind of place you might want to go if you have the extra cash and you really want to impress your first date, but I would say, call in advance and try to get a seat in the dining area.

The restaurant has a bright, modern interior and has both pre-made signature and customizable poke bowls.  Signature bowls include the namesake sweet tuna (tuna + salmon), spicy tuna, crab, and a bowl with beef.  Sweet Tuna has a more diverse selection of base items than other local poke restaurants, which includes cauliflower rice (cauliflower diced to the size of rice), carrot rice, and \\"veggie noodles\\" (carrot and zucchini thinly sliced to resemble noodles).  As at other poke locations, you can either choose one base or pick two.  Bowls come in small, medium, and large and come with 2, 3, or 4 scoops of protein, respectively.  Unlike other poke locations, vegetable mix-in selection is limited to 4 and special salads (seaweed, hijike) added on top are limited to 1.  If you want to load up with more, you'll have to pay a \\"per item\\" surcharge.   Note that avocado and cauliflower rice by themselves have a $1 surcharge.  Sauces are more unique than at other local poke restaurants - for example, one of the shoyu sauces is flavored with garlic and there is a carrot ginger and a \\"yum yum\\" (creamy sauce infused with beets) which I haven't seen at any other poke restaurant yet.\\n\\nLocation/Parking: Sweet Tuna is located in the Perimeter Place shopping complex that also houses Target and Taco Mac.  From the main entrance  (Olde Perimeter Way), drive to the traffic circle and the restaurant will be on the right before Ashford Xing, across from Panera.  You might not be able to park right in front of the restaurant, but the shopping center has more than enough parking.\\n\\nOrdering Experience: There's a large menu on the wall so you can decide what you want before you get in line.  The servers are pretty good at telling you how many items you can add at each station without needing to pay extra.  Right now, the serving isn't seamless but it isn't too slow either.  Their drink bar has special soda and tea options, so consider that if you're thirsty.\\n\\nWhat I Tried:\\nMedium Poke Bowl ($10.99) - I have to say I'm a huge fan of the unique base items.  Carrots are a welcome addition to the rice and the veggie noodles are light, refreshing, and a nice change up from spring mix or kale.  The fish quality is excellent for a poke restaurant.  I liked the tuna most, followed by the salmon then the spicy tuna, but all are worthy of consideration.  At first, limiting the vegetable mix-ins to 4 may sound like a bad thing, but the servers are good at giving generous scoops of each of your 4 items.  In the end, you actually can taste each individual ingredient, opposed to the large bowls I usually make at other places where I might not even notice if an ingredient is there.  Like the fish, the vegetable ingredients are also fresh.  I tried a mix of the tare sauce, which is a slightly smoky soy sauce, and the yum yum sauce.  My custom bowl had a little too much of the yum yum sauce for my liking, so the servers may want to be mindful of how much sauce to add.  That aside, the beet-flavored yum yum sauce is rich and a cool alternative to more common creamy poke bowl sauces.  I was happy to have more liberty to be able to choose up to three crunchy toppings, which included garlic crisps, onion crisps, and furikake (seaweed seasoning).  Portion size is reasonable for the price.\\n\\nVerdict: I think Sweet Tuna has an edge on ingredient quality from the many other poke restaurants that have popped up in Atlanta.  I'm a huge fan of the unique base options.  Also, they're really creative with the sauces here.  Combined with a clean, pleasant eating environment, I'm giving five stars to this poke restaurant."},{"name":"Lime Leaf","address":"435 Columbian St","city":"Weymouth","stars":"4.5","text":"Love the Fish choo chee curry!

Last week we went to Fritti and absolutely loved the pizza there.  It was exactly how pizza is in Italy.  Having been to Italy many times, we've had our fair share of pizza there.  However, Antico left us greatly disappointed.  \\n\\nWe do not understand what the attraction is with eating charred pizza.  The black charred crust and charred toppings made every bite bitter and unpleasant.  We got the pizza with basil and that was so pointless since it turned out to be shriveled up black pieces of yuck.  So, we pick off all the black basil.  Most of the cherry tomatoes were charred, so we picked off the black skins.  The crust was completely black and charred so we didn't really enjoy eating that.  The bottom of the crust is mostly charred so we have to pick off the black charred bits.  It ended up being an exercise of frustration.   I saw the sign that stated the pizza is \\"charred\\" and I thought to myself that was not a good sign.  Should have just walked out there and then, but we wanted to give it a fair shake.\\n\\n$21 for a bunch of charred bitter food.  No thanks.  We never have that when eating pizza in Italy and we're certainly not going to have it here.  Looking forward to going back to Fritti for some delicious Italian pizza!  Fritti's service may be lacking, but the pizza is not.  Antico's pizza, well, the rest of ya can have it.  We'll pass.\\n\\nAfterwards we popped over to the gelato place to try and appease our lackluster meal.  Ended up walking out cause the customer no-service made it a bit confusing on how to even order the gelato.   meh, too many other good places to go with a more relaxing atmosphere.

It went from being my favorite place in Texas, to my 2nd favorite, and now back to my favorite. Blacks BBQ briefly dethroned it for me, but since I last went back to Blacks I have to say Salt Lake gave a stellar presentation and has regained its crown. Meats are perfectly done and the mustard-based sauce is so unique in the barbecue world that it really has no comparison. The only place where I think Blacks can claim victory is the preparation of their loose casing sausage. Salt Lick uses a more uniform sausage that, while good, does not hold its own against Blacks. The ribs at Salt Lick in particular are absolutely fantastic, and literally fall off the bone. They have a wonderful smoky flavor that is all-natural and does not use any of that artificial smoke junk. There are no words to describe this restaurant except for \\"pure barbecue heaven\\", and I would highly recommend this to anyone who is looking for a great meal. Note to Salt Lick: please get rid of the wine portion of your restaurant. It does a disservice to the rest of your food, and for serious foodies who have been to places such as Napa (or even Europe!!) it is absolutely awful by comparison. Stick to what you are good at (BBQ)."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"I would go back.

The four of us waited outside on line close to half an hour this past Friday. We had the Burrata appetizer which was amazing, the butternut squash ravioli, the lobster ravioli, the pesto scallop linguine and I forget the other entree. The pesto scallop entree had way too much pesto and I asked that they ask the cook to sear the scallops till they brown and the waiter said they don't do that, but he'll tell the chef. Well, they were not seared, not browned as I specifically asked and I didn't enjoy the dish because of that. It was like eating raw scallops. I tasted both the ravioli's, the butternut has great flavor and the lobster one had the better sauce. That's my opinion of course. We had a nice bottle of Redwood wine, definitely great price on the wine bottles. This is a CASH ONLY place and know that it is extremely cramped seating.

I asked if they had any quiches (since I had read about them on yelp, but didn't see them in the case) and the lady at the counter was very cold and stern about there not being any left. OK. That's not a huge issue.\\n\\nSo I ordered a cheese danish and a cup of coffee for here. She gave me a to-go cup, and I reiterated that it would be for here. She didn't say anything, just gave me my danish, on a plate. So... they don't have for-here cups? I looked around and everyone sitting was drinking from a paper cup. I don't know why but that just totally ruins the feel of a place for me. It makes me feel like I'm at the airport instead of a cute little cafe. \\n\\nAlso? The cheese danish, meh. Not my style. It was incredibly sweet and the pastry part even had a glaze on it. It tasted kinda cheap in my opinion. I think cheese danishes are a pastry that is best when it has the sweet/savory/tart thing going on. This was just all sweet, too sweet.\\n\\nI probably won't be back, as there are other cafes and bakeries that are better in the area.

When I asked if the greens were supposed to be dressed, and was told that they were dressed with a balsamic vinaigrette, I pointed out that mine seemed utterly naked and the quiche rather burnt.  I was surprised by this lack of quality control.\\n\\nThey replaced it a short time later with a smaller triangle of unburnt quiche and a glistening pile of greens.  Though I found the quiche warm on the outside but still cool within, I ate it anyways, and found it tasty enough.\\n\\nI ended my dinner with a milk chocolate hazelnut cookie $1.95 to go.

(She is SO good to me!)  I went with the pizza, simply because a) I haven't had pizza in awhile, and 2) I had not tried Blitz's and it would give me something to write about.\\n \\nI asked her to get the \\"People's Pizza\\", which promises 18\\" of fun topped with salami, ham, Italian sausage and bacon. \\n\\nWhile she was waiting for her take-out order, Mrs BDB talked to the chef a bit, who came out and asked if everything her party had was OK.  Chef explained the difference between the various locations of Blitz - was has just opened in SW on 99w.   Menus and themes vary at each location.\\n \\nThe pizza arrived at our house a short time later, still warm from the oven. It's a monster pie - 18\\", most shops version of large is 14\\", and the pie was esthetically pleasing.\\n\\nI knew at first glance that I would love the crust - thin and cracker like, promising crispy crunching at the edges, and chewy goodness as one progressed inward towards the middle.\\n\\nToppings were ample, and while I am not usually a fan of crumbled and diced toppings, preferring hand-pulled or sliced chunks, instead, on the Blitz's pie, this method really worked - due to the quantity of toppings used - flavor extended across the entire diameter.  Whole salamis dotted the pizza in a concentric circle. \\n\\nThe sauce and cheese are too my liking - blending in with the other flavors, neither overpowering the other.   Applications of finely diced garlic, and an ample sprinkling of herbs round out the taste of the Blitz pizza.\\n\\nPizza, like all foods, is a very personal thing.  One has their likes and dislikes.  I haven't been too happy with pies in Portland, despite the raves some restaurants receive from their customers.    My favorite to date has been from Cara Amico on Barbur.\\n\\nToday, Blitz knocked off Cara Amico and moved to the top of my Portland list!

After reading the reviews, I decided to give it a try especially since I wanted a legit Italian dining experience. I knew that there would probably be a line and that it was cash only, so I went early and armed. Arrived outside the restaurant around 5:35pm, and there was already a line of about 7 people. I immediately thought \\"Uh oh\\" especially since I could see that the space was small but then I reconciled that thought because no other Italian restaurant within sight had a line, which probably meant that the food was worth waiting for or that it was super-hyped. \\n\\nMy wait time was only about 10 minutes. I was promptly seated and my server explained the menu ... pick a seafood and a sauce. Since I had researched Giacomo's before arriving, I knew exactly what I wanted ... calamari (appetizer), mussels with the spicy lobster sauce ($14), and a glass of cabernet ($5). \\n\\nThe bread arrived and although it was room temperature (I am a sucker for fresh warm bread), it was crusty, chewy, and delicious. It is the kind of quality bread that really sticks to the palate. \\n\\nSoon afterward, my calamari arrived. Since it was a small order ($7), I had expected a few pieces ... no, this portion was very generous. I stared at it and said \\"Wow! Is that all for me?\\" The calamari was delicious. I marveled at the ratio of breading to squid and appreciated that each piece of squid was perfectly cooked ... tender, NOT chewy. Included with the calamari were breaded and fried jalapenos and other peppers. Delicious!! The marinara dipping sauce was perfect as well, with just the right level of acidity and sweetness. I couldn't wait to try the entree.\\n\\nWhen the entree arrived, I was stunned because of the portion size and because of the generous amount of mussels included with the dish. The mussels lined the entire perimeter of the plate and were fresh and delicious. The sauce was spicy and succulent, with just enough zest to warm me up. I could taste hints of the lobster. Definitely a very well-made sauce with delicate nuances in flavor. The pasta was cooked well and the entire dish was very good, and made me want to try every dish on the menu. \\n\\nDefinitely a winner!"},{"name":"Terramia Ristorante","address":"98 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Visited with a Gilt City coupon and it was an amazing offer.

My husbands boar bolognese was creamy and flavorful. \\nMy homemade spaghetti was perfectly el dente with lobster and shrimp that was generous and large. The tiramisu was mild and I like it alittle stronger tasting but it was still wonderful. The shared dessert was complimented by expresso which was the only items we paid extra for.

I had my\\nPoncho on and my umbrella out, but my shoes were wet and I was annoyed. The moment I walked into the restaurant I just felt such a homey and welcoming feeling that brought me some comfort. I was seated within like 5 minutes and my waitress was at the table almost immediately. Her name was Emily and she was one of the most amazing waitresses I had on the trip. Emily went above and beyond for me the entire 2 hours I was there. She was professional and real. Not even once did I get a fake customer service smile or attitude from her because she truly had it in her to be an awesome waitress and overall person. She treated me like a friend she's known for a long time and I loved that about her. She knew exactly when to come check on me and when to leave me alone. Now, onto the food. \\n\\nThe bread basket is not your typical kind. It's Irish soda bread that has a Guinness beer dipping sauce with it. The bread itself is kind of dry and not that great but when you dip it in the sauce it's awesome! \\nFor my appetizer I got the Nom Nom Wings and I honestly still dream about them. Those wings were cooked PERFECTLY and they remained piping hot the ENTIRE. TIME. I can't even describe what he sauce tasted like. I told Emily that I wanted to bathe in the sauce and she brought me the recipe. What a legend! \\n\\nMy entree was the featured Pot Pie of the Day which Emily advertised to me so perfectly that I chose it without hesitation. It was the Red Curry Beef Pot Pie and let me tell you it was HUGE. I took the leftovers back to my room and ate them the next day and still had enough for another meal. Seriously. Huge. It was insanely flavorful and the beef was not dry. The crust was perfectly crispy and golden brown, too. \\n\\nNow for the dessert...I will really try to keep this short. The Bread Pudding should be the only thing you consider on the menu. The temperature, the sauces, the density...just eat it and you will understand. Another example of why Emily was QUALITY - she totally comped my dessert even though my birthday wasn't that exact same day. \\n\\nThe whole night was just flawless from the moment I stepped foot inside the restaurant. Although I couldn't see the entertainment since I was in another room, I could hear it and it was great. I will definitely be back here the next time I make it to Disney and I will make sure to be seated in Emily's section."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"Brisket is legit, worth its weight in gold.

I liked the flavors of my meats, the portions were huge, and I liked that they did some extras (shrimp apps & noodles) which I don't think other restaurants include. \\n\\nWe had a party of 6, and everyone ordered combo meats. I ordered the \\"sirloin steak & scallops\\" dinner for $19.95, which came with a house soup (*sad face* b/c not miso soup), salad w/ ginger dressing, shrimp appetizer, noodles, grilled vegetables, & rice. \\n\\nThe soup & salad were ok but everything else had really great flavor - I think the secret ingredient was their herb butter. My favorites for taste were probably the noodles & steak. One tip to keep in mind when ordering steak - I ordered medium but it ended up more like \\"medium well\\", and the person who ordered \\"medium well\\" got \\"well done\\". Still, I enjoyed my steak very much. Scallops were good, too - and they were HUGE!\\n\\nAlso, if you're going to do hibachi where the food is cooked right in front of you, you might as well eat the food as soon as it hits the plate - that's what I do but I do end up eating everything pretty fast while everyone else is eating at a more leisurely pace (the healthy way, I guess), exercising portion control, and therefore end up w/ enough leftovers for a second meal. Not me, not when I eat hibachi :)\\n\\nService was ok - I don't think we got full attention b/c we were in one of the side rooms where we had to take off our shoes and the servers could only access our table from the cook's location ... so drink refills weren't so good. While I guess it's more authentic to eat w/ your shoes off, I don't care what age you are, I think all of us had a difficult time maneuvering ourselves to sit comfortably at their tables. \\n\\nFood alone though is worth a return trip. FYI, they do have a few early bird specials Mon-Thur: you can get a 3-course hibachi dinner for $11-13. Just order by 6:30pm.

But after switching my reservations to 9:30 pm... my only choice is the Chef's surprise.\\n\\nCan I just say I enjoyed everything?\\n\\nBluefish \\nKampachi sashimi \\nTautog Cape Cod Fish - nicely panfried with a nice crispy skin\\nSirloin with Bok Choy - so tender with a oxtail based sauce prepared medium rare\\n\\nAll were nicely presented and prepared with great care. From the light in texture/flavour/complexity to the heavy. Each dish has it own character. Small portions were great for me so I can savour every bite!!\\n\\nDessert Time! Another surprise!! We were presented with 3 different desserts! All so pretty and delicious too!!\\n\\nFlan with a ribbon like cake on top\\nWarm Dark Chocolate Brownies with Ice Cream and caramel sauce\\nTorte - layered with cake, chocolate and butter cream\\n\\nThe Craigie On Main Chef's Whim Menu is definitely worth every penny. Just come with a open mind and willing to try everything and you would not be disappointed!!\\n\\nServices are attentive and professional!! The wait staffs served all our dish exactly the same time... and explain everything items in the dish for us. The blank menu is perfect for us to take some notes!\\n\\nOh Kampachi is from Hawaii?

I'm also a fan of the pizza because it's SO CHEESY, but it's also a little on the oily side.

We had seen them on  Scoutmob, but finally decided to give the place a try when my partner got a dining dough certificate from American Express worth $50.  Big mistake...!\\n\\nAwful doesn't begin to describe this mess.  Like the aforementioned reviewer said, the place is confused about what it wants to be, which wouldn't be such a big deal if they were serving up good, fresh food, but that is certainly not the case here.  The writing was on the wall the minute we arrived at the hotel.  Sure wish we had paid attention.  Costly mistake.\\n\\nWe knew where the hotel was located, so no problem there.  However, we decided to park ourselves, and drove into the parking deck expecting there to at least be some kind of clue as to where to park once inside.  Nada.  We called the restaurant, after driving through signs for visitors, reserved spaces, etc., with no indication of where to park for the restaurant.  Parking for the restaurant was on the 9th floor, from which you have to walk down a flight of stairs and take an elevator to the ground floor.  It's not indicated anywhere, but we got off on the ground level, and then began the search for the restaurant--wandering around in the dark until we were even later for the reservation than we had been after leaving a movie that lasted longer than expected.  No signs.  No clues.  Just \\"find your way...\\"  I should have heeded the message that my gut instinct was shouting at me.\\n\\nWhen we finally made it to the entrance, we saw that the place was about 1/3 occupied.  We were greeted by someone yelling in our general direction from the middle of the restaurant, \\"table for two?\\"  We were taken around a corner, and seated near windows that soon had headlight after headlight arriving at the hotel, blinding us every time a car approached.  Really???  When the place is far less than full?\\n\\nWe ordered a couple of mojitos and two appetizers--fried calamari and a ceviche.  The calamari was incredibly salty, greasy and lifeless.  The ceviche was not bad, but nothing special.  The mojitos fared better.  They were very good, strong drinks.  At least they got one thing right...\\n\\nWe ordered our food.  I had the prime rib, which I hadn't had in a good while, and my partner ordered the salmon.  When they arrived, my prime rib was well done instead of medium rare as I had ordered it, served up with a lukewarm baked potato.  My partner's salmon was quite literally cold.  We sent both of our meals back.  If you knew my partner, who was in the restaurant business for 22 years, and who understands that things sometimes happen, you'd know how bad something actually has to be for him to send it back. \\n\\nIn the interim, we ordered a couple of glasses of wine.  Geronimo didn't seem to be able to understand what my partner was ordering for us, so he ended up just (literally) pointing it out on the menu.  My merlot didn't taste right, but again, I drank it anyway.  Only when we got the bill did we have it confirmed that the server had indeed served me a cabernet instead.  Nice pour though...\\n\\nWhen the server returned with our replacement meals, they were once again unsatisfactory, with my prime rib and potato both barely warm, albeit cooked to order, and his salmon barely warm, obviously dried out under the heat lamp.  Also, I had asked for some raw horseradish for my rather tasteless prime rib (a $30 entree, btw!!!), and once an interpreter was brought out to determine what it was I was talking about, I was brought a small side of chopped up red radish.  Prime rib on their menu, and they've never had ANYONE ask for horseradish?!\\n\\nWe didn't send the food back again.  We told the server that it was still not right, but that we would just eat it anyway, given that we had already sent it back once.  If you're like us, when you go out for a special occasion, you really don't want to ruin the mood completely by belaboring the point over and over about the food not being right.  It was obvious that it just wasn't GOING to be right.  If they can't make it right even when they know it has been wrong already, then it's pretty obvious that they aren't capable or willing.  Cut you losses, which is what we did. Geronimo was very apologetic, saying how awful he felt, etc., and he DID seem sincere, but at no point was a manager brought over, or any other overture made to try and soothe things about our bad experience.  \\n\\nFinal tally: $85 after the discount of $50.

Drinks were delicious, as I expected they would be for the $15-16 price tag. The bread was probably some of the best I have had in a restaurant. I hear they sell it. The food was ok, although my husband very much enjoyed his meat even though I found my mushroom dumplings incredibly bland. \\n\\nThe only things that brought our evening down were the price-quality ratio (crazy expensive and not in a way that makes you feel it was worthwhile to break the bank) and our very moody waiter. We have dined at many, many upscale restaurants, and know full well that excellence should never come with an attitude. He was most unfriendly and you could almost see an eye roll when we politely declined the $50 side of truffles he was offering. \\n\\nEven if we forgave the huffy and judgmental attitude our waiter was exuding, the way he and the restaurant handled the bill at the end of the evening was truly unconscionable. The bill arrived with no indication of tip being included, as we would usually expect for a party of six. The bill was for our food, drinks and taxes only. We split it three ways. When we received the credit card receipts back for signature, one of our friends happened to realize that the total amount was suddenly higher than it had been on the original bill (while still providing a tip line below). We asked the waiter if tip had been included and he said yes. Had it not been for my friend's careful review, we would have all left another 20% for our waiter.  We thought the restaurant's practice of not clearly showing the tip amount on the original bill and then adding in the tip after collecting our credit cards was extremely deceptive. It may have been an error or an oversight, but either way should have been clearly explained, especially in an environment where drinks are flowing. I would recommend visiting the bar and maybe having a few apps, and enjoying the lovely ambience, but not staying for dinner."},{"name":"Aquitaine","address":"500 Legacy Pl","city":"Dedham","stars":"3.5","text":"I wouldn't go rushing back here.

My waiter was kind enough to take it back to cook even more and it came back well done. This time, it was still tough but I was more comfortable eating it then.\\n\\nOverall, I think the food was ok with a good amount of flavor but what bumped their rating was the five star hospitality. Maybe I'll come back and try something else."},{"name":"Ichiro Japanese Restaurant","address":"12011 2nd Avenue","city":"Richmond","stars":"3.5","text":"Delicious food overall.

Overall a good a experience.\\n\\nAs for books, there is a good selection of interesting sale books, and they have a nice magazine selection.  But they simply don't have the space for a comprehensive book selection.  Fun place to browse, especially if you like to buy magazines.  Definitely not a place to go for children's books.

I was really excited because it sounded delicious and they seem pretty busy. I guess I shouldn't have gotten my hopes up.\\n\\nI went with my boyfriend and we ordered the same thing: Joey Jr with chicken. A guy made my boyfriend's burrito first and filled it with rice and chicken, then slid it on down to the next person to put ingredients in it. Then he asked me what I wanted, and I had to repeat it twice because he interrupted my order because they always yell \\"Welcome to Moes\\" when someone walks in (very annoying and rude towards the people ordering). He wrote what I wanted on the aluminum foil, and then walked off without a word of explanation. A girl ended up taking over and again asked me what I wanted. Why do I have to explain this 3 times just to get started? The girl added the rice and chicken to my burrito and put a fraction of the amount in it that my boyfriend got in his, even though we ordered the exact same thing. Apparently it makes a difference who's making the burrito. When I started to order more ingredients, the girl started coughing and as she explained to the guy working behind her \\"was choking on her own spit.\\" Awesome. Just what I want to hear from someone making my food. She tried to stay away from my food, but germs spray when you cough. She couldn't pay attention to what I was saying because she was trying not to cough. And I was just so distracted and disgusted by it all I hardly paid any attention to what I ordered in my burrito. She ended up having to walk away finally and the original guy came back to complete by burrito. I had him put one thing in it and that was it. I wish he would have offered to make a new burrito.

My only gripe is that some of the clerks do not speak English well.  I ordered a Cheeseburger and small fries to go.  The order took (no lie) 5 minutes at least to place because the young woman simply couldn't understand.  I was nice, and patient, but it was rather frustrating.

Yes, it gets crowded early, and the line grows exponentially as the sun sets.  And yes, it's just another homey Italian joint in the North End. But no, it's freaking tasty and really cheap for the quality of seafood and size of portions. No, it's not a waste to stand in line before the restaurant opens at 4:30 so you can be seated RIGHT AWAY. And no, husband had never tasted such tasty pasta before in his life... I've been to Italy, so I'll say that this is the best Italian-American food that's ever entered my mouth and stomach.\\n\\nFirst, the fried calamari: crisp and fresh, they also fry up some peppers that are the perfect complement to the rich butteriness of the calamari. Dip in the fantastic marinara (rich but not overpoweringly tomato-y) and pop into your mouth. Yum-o.\\n\\nNext, the bottle of wine: so tasty and so affordable. I think we got the tempranillo and I think it was like $17. Um, yes please! \\n\\nFinally: Fracomo Sauce. Get it on anything, and you're good. We got it on our shrimp and scallops with linguine. Fra diavolo = spicy marinara. Giacomo = creamy lobster. Fracomo = magic. Creamy, rich tomato sauce with a kick. So so SO very tasty. I tried replicating the sauce at home, but I couldn't capture the full flavor profile that made this meal so memorable.  Not super heavy, considering the creamy and richness of it all. One of the most well-rounded and balanced pasta sauces I've had.\\n\\nWe also ordered and enjoyed a veal parmigiana. Not too soggy or greasy and topped with the wonderful marinara sauce we so enjoyed.  AND our server was so kind and sweet.  I'm sure she's seen people from all over come through her tables, but she was still excited to hear where we were from and why we were visiting.

Being a New Yorker, greasy spoons like this are on every block in Manhattan and the outer boroughs.  Coming to Boston, judging from the exterior of the restaurant, I expected a cheap, mid-level quality to the food.  Unfortunately, neither of those expectations came to pass.  \\n\\nThe food was not exactly cheap.  Appetizers were in the $3 and up range, mostly $5 and up.  Every dish or combo was $7 and up.  In New York, most combos are in the $6-7 range.  Anyhow, the pricing was disappointing.\\n\\nAs for the food, it seems as if this restaurant hasn't moved along with the times.  If you enjoy Chinese food circa 1975-1985, this is your place.  For example, sweet and sour chicken consisted of a slab or white meat chicken dipped in a starchy batter, when fried, turned the the piece of meat into a 4 inch by 2 inch monster.  Eating one piece without rice was enough for one meal in and of itself.  Just horrible!  The hot and sour soup was strangely, sweet and sour.  As for the noodle soup, I had foon soup and two-thirds of the container consisted of chopped up cabbage and other veggie bits, which turned the soup into a veggie soup, \\n\\nI am by no means a cheap Chinese take-out food snob.  I love cheap take out, hole-in-the-wall restaurants, but this place ported me to a time and place long gone.

It satisfies the palate completely. Burgers are solid. And the fries are quite lovely. Cut thin and crispy. The mojo sauce is not quite a typical Cuban mojo flavor, I think they may sneak a little balsamic in there for sweetness.

Not the Taco Bell, Chevy's versions of Mexican, but honest to goodness Mexican cuisine.\\n\\nI was really excited about Rocco's coming to town.  I'm always excited when a new Mexican restaurant opens around me.  Being new to FL, I had never been to a Rocco's location before.  In the style of many of the restaurants on restaurant row, it's tacky.  There is just way too much going on with the decor.  Don't get me started on high backed chairs that feature the name of a prominent tequila brand on the backs.\\n\\nPutting that aside, I looked at the menu, and to my pleasant surprise, there were a fair amount of offerings for lunch.  Our server recommended a ceviche of shrimp and scallops.  Terrible.  The seafood was not fresh, three days old at best.  My dining companion ordered two tacos (beef and chorizo).  The beef taco wasn't bad, but the chorizo was unlike any chorizo that I've ever tasted.  It was foul.  I ordered the yucatan combo.  The skirt steak tacos were very good, and the pico de gallo was great.  The chicken enchilada was another story altogether.  It was as if somebody poured a quart of sea salt into the batch when all it called for was a half a cup.  \\n\\nOur server recommended a particular margarita as their \\"most consistent,\\" and while the first one was good, the second one tasted nothing like the first.\\n\\nOur server wasn't anything spectacular.

It's always packed with tourists, hipsters and panhandlers. Every time I visit Little 5, I have some kind of unfortunate experience - a tattoo artist literally laughing out loud at my question about vegan ink, restaurant patrons accusing me of staying at a table too long, stepping on a huge rod of metal sticking up out of the sidewalk (6 months later, that same piece of metal is still sticking up out of the ground). There's always someone getting into a fight or screaming match with someone else, always someone shouting or protesting to passers-by. I don't see why people are so in love with this neighborhood at all.\\n\\nHowever, The Porter is more than reason enough to visit Little 5. Unlike nearly every other restaurant I've gone to here, the servers at The Porter are very nice and helpful. Everyone is really patient and more than happy to answer my questions about what's vegan and what's not. In fact, without even having to ask, I was told on my first trip there by a server who wasn't even vegan that I would need to order the veggie burger without the bun since it includes some dough conditioners. For any vegans out there, you know how rare this kind of amazing service is!\\n\\nThe veggie burger is truly amazing. Probably the best I've ever had in Atlanta (Well, Grind House is a close second). And the fries are so, so good. I haven't ventured past the veggie burger, so I don't know what else on the menu might be vegan, but I go so infrequently that I enjoy getting the veggie burger every time.\\n\\nAnd of course, the beer is the best part about The Porter. You're not going to find many \\"regular\\" brands here. Even though I typically stick with the \\"Whatever's your cheapest?\\" beer when I go out, I really enjoy trying out new beers when I go to The Porter. The servers will let you try a sample of a beer before ordering a full glass (as long as it's on tap - and they have a LOT on tap!). Go with a group of friends and try out a whole bunch of new beers! Or for smaller groups, they have a \\"sampler tray\\" of mini-glasses, and it's pretty affordable considering how many different kinds of beers you get to try out.\\n\\nI REALLY wish this place was closer to me.

I had the dumplings to start - they were really tasty but not at all what I'd anticipated from a southern place (I'm not sure why they were more like gyoza?).  That said, I'd definitely have them again, but there were a lot of really enticing options on the menu - I'd probably aim for one of those, first.  As far as the etouffee, it was a really solid entree and was nice to see a non-seafood option for it.

The scallops were cooked nicely with just the right amount of cajun seasoning...The catfish was lightly coated and yummy..  The greens were flavorful and the watermelon salad was a perfect summer side dish. Who knew radishes and onions would compliment watermelon so well?  Pickles were an interesting choice for a table appetizer.  {I'd prefer] bread [or] cornbread to start.  The sweet tea was delicious enough for me to order a second.  The peanut butter pie was quite good and the mashed bananas added the perfect combination to go with the fresh whipped cream.  The one drawback about the bananas is they made the crust a tad soggy. My one solid complaint was it was really noisy and hard to hear others...I also agree about the [lack of back support with my] bench. The menu was diverse, but [I wanted] more choices of sauces or combinations of meat and fish to choose.  Overall I'd return and recommend Estelle's to others.\\n--\\nAmple beer selection and a funky (can't spell funky without fun) decor greet you upon entering.  The menu was full of interesting dishes, another trip might be in order to sample some of them.

First off, I am surprised that they don't accept cards. Considering this date and age when plastic is the currency, that makes very little sense. It can't be because of connectivity since they have ATMs there where you can pull cash. On that note, you pay $2 to Salt Lick as the fee for pulling money.

But most barbecue places are set up like a buffet where you go down the line and order, then pay and take it to your table. I did like that they serve you like in most restaurants. Nice touch. And it's pretty good service.\\n\\nThis brings me to the food. I had Thurman's Plate. I figured it would give me a good sampling of things. Let me start by saying I did not particularly like their beans, cole slaw or potato salad. Not compared to other places. They just weren't that tasty, the potato salad being the \\"best\\" of the three.\\n\\nOnto the barbecue. This is a tough one. It's kind of like the Texas argument about chili. You talk to one person and they say, \\"It ain't real chili if it's got beans\\". Another person says, \\"If it ain't got beans, it ain't chili\\". (And I was born and raised in Texas so I can say it with \\"ain't\\".)\\n\\nMy point of view, good barbecue not only doesn't need sauce, it's almost sacrilege to USE sauce. I have a few places I go to, and I don't use sauce because it's just so darn flavorful. And when I say flavor, any meat can have a meat flavor. That's not the point. Anyone who calls themselves a cook, chef or similar can cook moist meat. But good barbecue has a great smokey flavor. It has flavors from the rub and seasonings and maybe sauces used in smoking it. And here is the inherent problem with most barbecue and is the problem here. It lacks that amazing, aforementioned flavor. \\n\\nYou walk up to the restaurant, you smell that amazing smoke in the air that makes your mouth water. You wait in line to get seated. You follow a hostess to a table. You go over the menu, fighting with yourself on what you should and shouldn't order. Then you get to order. You wait and wait and it can't get there soon enough. Finally it arrives. All the while you've been smelling amazing smells. You remember that smell that greeted you when you first opened your car door (or stepped off the bus...). So finally, you take your first bite. And... it has none of that great, amazing smokey flavor! It just tastes like meat. Well cooked meat, I'll admit. But I could have that at home! Cooked in the oven. I want amazing.\\n\\nSo, we resort to barbecue sauce. It's great sauce, don't get me wrong. I love it. And it makes everything great. But barbecue is the meat in my bible. Not the sauce. The sauce is just something add MORE flavor, if you so desire.\\n\\nSo, there you go. I will be back. I absolutely plan to bring the family. I hope to do so plenty of time over the years. But it still just doesn't have the amazing flavor of numerous other establishments around the Austin area. Is because they've just become a tourist attraction? Did it used to taste beautifully smokey and flavorful? I guess I'll never truly know. But at least I know now to bring cash..."},{"name":"Ocean Wave By Harry And Sons","address":"820 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I love Harry & Sons.

You can't really go there and complain about the wait, the place is really well known so just expect to be waiting. Now the question is, is it worth the wait.?....mmmmmm maybe. 1 hour wait, ok...1.5 is a stretch...2 hours...that's kind of my max for anywhere, not just here. The good part is, there's usually some entertainment going on and you can always grab a cold drink. My only qualm at all is the lack of variety with their side items. I think it's slaw, beans, and maybe one or 2 other options...not really a fan of either. Generally with BBQ, at least in my opinion, you could expect corn, potatoes, green beans...something to the effect, anyway my folks who do like beans and slaw say they're up to par, so I suppose it's just a preference.

I love this place a lot, and prefer it to any other restaurant/bar in the Little Five Points area. \\n\\nThis place has the best fish and chips in Atlanta.  Hands down. Their cornmeal beer-battered catfish comes in a huge portion and packs a mouthful of flavor.  Too often I order fish and chips and get stuck with soggy, bland batter.  The Porter's version has a light, crisp breading that is seasoned well and doesn't take away from the fish.  It comes with a pile of herb fries and a creamy, green tomato tartar sauce that I love to dunk my fish in.  \\n\\nI also really like their half pound bacon cheeseburger.  I tell all my friends who are looking for a burger in the 5 Points area to dump the long line at Vortex and to come here instead.  Don't get me wrong, The Vortex has great burgers with a variety of toppings, but if you want the classic cheeseburger with really well-seasoned meat, come to The Porter, order the burger with a fried egg on top if you're feeling adventurous, and you won't be disappointed.  On a side note though, the last time I visited, my burger bun was a little stale.  But that won't stop me from getting it again.  I have faith in you guys!\\n\\nFor appetizers, you can never go wrong with the Belgian fries, or the creamy mac n'cheese.  I like the goat cheese fritters too, but for those of you that are expecting a salty, savory cheese stick, expect more of a sweet and savory treat - almost like a fried cannoli.  They're delicious, but a little rich, so make sure to share and spread the love :)\\n\\nEach time a friend plans an outing here, I get so excited that I spend the day planning what beers I'm going to drink, and what new food items I want to try.

On the menu, a majority of the dishes are appetizers (I believe there were 6 entrees and about 20 appetizers), so we went appetizer heavy.\\n\\n-- Tuna tartare - This dish was delicious!  The portion was very generous and enough for 4 people.  It came with a big piece of light, thin, poofy cracker, which had nice subtle flavor and went well with the tuna.\\n\\n-- Egg yolk ravioli - Definitely the favorite appetizer of the night!  I thought it was a unique idea.  It came with 5 ravioli.  We all wished it came with more!\\n\\n-- Pork and leek gyoza - Tasted yummy but nothing special.\\n\\n-- Goat cheese risotto - Very good!  Could have done without the dots of green sauce.\\n\\n-- Gnocchi - This is an appetizer that I ate as my entree.  The gnocchi came in a thick soup.  The soup reminded me of a seafood bisque, very thick, a tad too salty.  The gnocchi itself was delicious and perfectly cooked!  Definitely on the heavier side.\\n\\n-- Hamachi crudo - This is another appetizer that I ate as my entree with the gnocchi.  Tasted fresh.  It came with this bright red sauce that was sweet on its own but paired nicely with the fish.\\n\\n-- Chicken on a brick - The chicken was perfectly cooked.  The skin on the outside was nice and crispy, and the meat itself was very juicy!  The mashed potatoes that came with these were tasty as well, though it was a tad on the salty side.\\n\\n-- Aged Strip Loin - Perfectly cooked.  Juicy, tender, delicious!\\n\\n-- Short Rib - Again, perfectly cooked and delicious!\\n\\n-- Souffle - I liked that the waitress warned us that the souffle would be a 15 minute wait.  We were in no rush, and the wait was worth it!  Great dessert!\\n\\nDinner ended up lasting about 2.5 hours.

We didn't want to fill up before the meat appeared but it was good to have something to nibble on as we all chatted about.\\n\\nThen the meal came.  Fabulous.  All the different cuts of the brisket were delicious.  Tender and juicy.  The ribs were succulent and fell off the bones.  The sausage was good but we have to admit that we preferred the other meats.  I enjoyed the potato salad, coleslaw and beans but looked at them as enhancements as the meats were the highlight.  Kelly came by to check on us often and she refilled our meat plate when it emptied out.\\n\\nAnd although we were all stuffed, I had to have dessert.  They had peach or blackberry cobbler.

How do I know this?  Well, I was talking to some friends on a message board one day, and polite chitchat somehow turned to a heated discussion over who makes the best cannoli in Boston.  Being a peacemaker, I stepped in.  \\"Ladies!\\" I said.  \\"Tell you what.  I am a selfless individual.  I will visit Mike's, Modern, and Maria's, do an impartial taste test of all three, and get back to you.\\"  My friends all agreed that I'm a total giver.  They also felt that, since I had never actually eaten a cannoli before, I was a good person to conduct this test.\\n\\nSo, off I went to the North End.  For six consecutive working days, I trekked over to the North End in abominable weather to purchase a cannoli to go and carry it back to my office, through the rain and snow (this was in winter a few years ago).  I tried ricotta filled and chocolate-filled, and Maria's cannolis are absolutely the most delicious.  \\n\\nFirst, they are filled to order.  That means that the shell remains crunchy and delicious longer.  Second, they have a very pleasing shell-to-filling ratio.  Each bite is perfectly proportioned.  The ricotta filling is sweet and creamy.  This was the first non-chocolate dessert I ever truly loved.  I'll be honest - I licked the paper clean when I was done.  The chocolate-filled was equally delightful.  The filling was like thick, delicious pudding.  I ate it very slowly, because I didn't want to finish.\\n\\nI've been back many, many times after those first two visits, and I've never been disappointed.  I've taken many of my out of town visitors, and everyone has always been very happy.\\n\\nI'm not saying that the other places in the North End aren't good, but this is the best.  I realize that it's not actually on the Freedom Trail, but it's literally a detour of about 20 feet, once you know where you're going.  When the Freedom Trail turns left and heads into the Greenway, just keep going straight.  You should see it in about 15 seconds (It's actually visible from the place that the Freedom Trail turns).  So. Go to the North End.  Leave the beaten path.  And go to Maria's for the best cannoli in the world.  \\n\\nBring cash.  There is a minimum purchase amount to use credit cards.

The server missed a golden opportunity to drive the checks higher but up selling alcohol, which we were ALL drinking, thus making her tips higher. That's server 101.

And we are still waiting for our entry as I type, after 70 mins since we place our orders. \\n\\nOne warm recommendation: at least prepare some bread if you knew your service takes this much time."},{"name":"Strega Italiano - Seaport","address":"One Marina Park Dr","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Ah Strega!  Its a standby for us if we're in Seaport. But its a caricature of itself.\\n\\nBoth the patrons and the staff are exaggerated like cartoons.  Another reviewer described waitresses as very \\"Jersey Shore.\\"  I agree and find it fascinating!  Boston's Finest and members of The Family toast each other and mingle in peace here. Enjoy the show!\\n\\nThe last time we were at Stega, we sat in the TV strewn bar area.  It was 4:00PM, the changing of the guard so service was no where to be found.  Unfortunately this is typical of most restaurants.  As 5:00PM approached, more staff came on and service got a lot better.\\n\\nThe speciality cocktails are well crafted. Food is decent but there are some misses. The eggplant rotini app. was bland and seemed straight from the freezer.  Garlic shrimp was good, anitpasto plate is worth it. I've not had an entree here. \\n\\nWhen you consider the eyeful you get with decent food, its worth the trip."},{"name":"Chung Shin Yuan","address":"183 California St","city":"Newton","stars":"3.5","text":"All these years I lived in Boston. I drove passed this place hundreds of times and never stopped in. I decided to try it out today. I had to ask myself why I waited this long. The food was amazing. I got right in at 11:30am on Saturday. The waitress was nice and attentive. I would come back again!!!"},{"name":"Whole Heart Provisions","address":"487 Cambridge St","city":"Allston","stars":"4.5","text":"I love this place so much.\\nFresh and healthy!

On my visit there was a wait to be seated at a table.  The host sat us in the lounge to wait and provided us with menus to browse and grabbed us drinks.  \\n\\nThe menu options are vast! From the 18 different hamburgers to the $199 steak.  The proportions are enormous and the prices are cheap!"},{"name":"Pio Pio Restaurant","address":"5803 Precision Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Good food but TERRIBLE service and high prices. \\n\\nMet a friend for lunch and all I had was fries, an appetizer and a coke and he had the Lunch Special. \\n\\nThis is NOT a fancy place, it is in a strip mall that has seen better days.  Tables have no tablecloths just a sheet of white paper. \\n\\nFood was excellent but waitresses turned my 5-Star review into a 1-Star.  She was lazy and inattentive and when she finally got around to bringing the check for what should of been a $20 quick lunch it was over $50.00 with the tip. \\n\\nThe reason for the review is on the receipt SHE PUT WHAT SHE WANTED FOR AN UNREALISTIC TIP - and get this. I kid you not - SHE HIGHLIGHTED IT IN YELLOW HIGHLIGHTER and then took a different color pen and made HUGE stars on either side of her tip and drew arrows pointing to it. \\n\\nFor what she wanted for a tip I could of bought a THIRD MEAL and still HAD MONEY LEFTOVER!!!\\n\\nNever in my life has this happened to me and I am a very generous tipper. \\n\\nBoycott this business until they rein in their lazy wait staff who demand lunch tips more than the price of a lunch. \\n\\nThe food is excellent but THE SERVICE IS HORRIBLE!  \\n\\nAvoid - Avoid - Avoid\\n\\nTheir food is excellent but their wait staff will put them out of business."},{"name":"Giacomo's Ristorante - Boston","address":"355 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Giacomo's (in the South End) is delicious. While it's a little crowded, it makes for a great meal experience. Just don't forget cash. They don't take credit cards (not sure about the one in the North End)."},{"name":"Raglan Road Irish Pub","address":"1640 E Buena Vista Dr","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"GREAT spot for a night out in Disney Springs! Try to reserve a table near the entertainment - they offer great free performances (Irish step Dancing and live bands). \\n\\nDecor: \\nFeels like a lively Irish pub. There is a lot of seating, which is great.\\n\\nFood:\\nSo good! I didn't have very high expectations for the food, but I was blown away by the quality and taste. Share the Smokie City appetizer with your table. It's a creamy, cheesy \\"dip\\" with large pieces of baked haddock, potatoes and tomatoes. The complimentary brown bread is also epic. I studied in Dublin for a semester and this took me right back. Other notable items included the Cider Salmon entree and Brussels Sprouts side. The salmon was cooked perfectly, with simply roasted potatoes and spinach. Nice entree if you're looking for something light. The Brussels Sprouts were coated in some type of grated cheese that added really nice nutty, salty flavor. You almost forget you're eating you're vegetables :)\\n\\nDrinks:\\nCan't go wrong with your order here. Nice selection of Irish Beer and Whiskey. I opted for a Gin and Tonic, which was perfect. \\n\\nIf I'm back in Orlando, I'll be coming here first!"},{"name":"La Taqueria Taco Bar & Grill","address":"636 Hyde Park Ave","city":"Roslindale","stars":"4.5","text":"This place is excellent. Today was my first time. I got the tacos (pork belly, Cajun shrimp and Carne asada) the pork belly was amazing!! The place is very clean and the service was great.
