The line behind me increased to about 70 people or so.  I soon began to notice groups of people bypassing the line, and going right to managers or waitresses, speaking to them in a familiar way, and sure enough, these groups were ushered over to tables that had just been cleared.  After the 4th instance of this happening, I asked a manager what was happening.  He said he \\"didn't know\\", or claimed that \\"they had already been seated previously\\".  \\n\\nI took his explanation at face value, until I saw this happen a few more times, with people who would pull in to the parking lot, walk from their cars, and get a seat almost immediately.  I also witnessed a group of 3 young women wait in line behind me for 30 minutes, until one of them said \\"Oh, let me go talk to my friend\\".  Sure enough, they were seated almost immediately.  \\n\\nI again asked the manager about this situation, and specifically mentioned that group of young women.  His response was \\"Oh, you mean Jenn?  she already had a table.\\"  I then asked why someone who already had a table would wait in line (and add her name to the wait list) for 30 minutes.  He could not come up with an answer.\\n\\nAfter waiting for approximately 90 minutes, the other members of my party were getting anxious about the possibility of getting a table at all.  I asked a different manager about our odds, and he responded \\"Truthfully, it doesn't look good\\".  I then told him that it seemed to me that many people had skipped the line altogether, and that it didn't seem fair to everyone who had waited patiently outside.  At this point, my group left and went elsewhere to watch the game.\\n\\nI have been coming to this location for over a year, and doubt that I will return.

The waitress was great, gave us enough space, but didn't skimp on service.  \\n\\nMy SO and I both got signature cocktails.  Both were really fantastic.  I got a play on a Mule and he had another gin based drink.  I later had a drink with mescal and egg white that blew my ming.  \\n\\nWe decided we were going all out that night since it was a new resturaunt we had both been waiting a while to try.  We ordered the lobster roll appetizer and a crispy kale salad to start.  The waitress offered to split the plate on the crispy kale salad which was a delight to hear at a higher end resturaunt. \\n\\nThe dishes didn't take too long to come out and both were incredible.  The lobster rolls weren't filled with mayo and instead the rolls were slathered in butter.  The crispy kale salad was kale done right.  So many resturaunts are missing the mark on kale salad and this did not.  My SO was a bit leery of kale and he ate almost every bite of his share.  He probably would have if I didn't steal it first.\\n\\nFor the main course, my SO got the hanger steak and I got the pork double chop.  He ordered his medium rare, and the only downfall of the night was it came out really rare.  We both decided they probably weren't cooking to order on that and decided we didn't care.  It was probably better and more tender that way.  The truffle cake that was served underneath was perfectly season and the sauce on the side was to die for.  My pork chop had the perfect amount of sweetness and the brussel sprouts underneath were somehow made delicate.  \\n\\nDespite the fact that we were stuffed, we decided to order dessert.  After a long debate, we decided on the Vanilla Liberation.  We absolutly made the right choice.  Almond cookies with a caramel filling served with the best vanilla whipped cream I've ever had.  Even better?  Dipping it in the white russian that was served with.\\n\\nThe bill at the end was just about $100 before tip, which is more than we can regularly spend, but are happy to spend on such an amazing experience.  Looking at the menu, we realized this was somewhere we could easily afford to split a burger and have a few beers at on a regular basis (the burgers are big) and keep the extensive 3 course ordering with specialty cocktails as a special treat.\\n\\nI'm more than excited that my birthday is next month when I can claim special occasion dinner and make a return visit."},{"name":"Little Bird Bistro","address":"215 SW 6th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"My friends and I came here for dinner on a Saturday evening and we were promptly seated upon arrival. Inside, the atmosphere is lively but not too loud to the point where you could not hear the person sitting across from you. The service of this place is top-notch while the food quality is average. The complimentary bread they provided was dry and inconsistent. One loaf would taste more like a biscotti while the next one tasted like marshmallow. The bone marrow entree we ordered came with garlic bread that was over-toasted and tasted too bitter for my liking. The meat itself was drenching in fat, which was too heavy my stomach. The salad receives a 5 star for plating but mostly consisted of four cubes of watermelon that tasted like it has been sitting in the refrigerator two days too many.

Unfortunately, if you have any decent-sized appetite (this might only apply to males over 100lbs. and only to the basic breakfast plate with eggs, sausage, toast and potatoes!), you are going to need to bring like a $$$ million bucks with you so you have enough cash to buy more than one plate. Geezus. The prices are moderate i guess. I finished my plate and was sitting there contemplating on getting the flapjack plate as well. I settled for just downing a few more beverages instead.

My mom got just a street taco with a side of the queso, which she liked both.

We didn't get the free chips and salsa that should have came with the happy hour taco we ordered, but didn't realize it till we were leaving. It might have been our mistake maybe we were suppose to ask for it. I got the chicken on my Double D's which my sister liked more than the ground beef on hers she thought the chicken was very flavorful and she happened to surprisingly not like the queso but that just meant more for my mom and me. Another thing was the chips were stale. I was kinda disappointed in my Double D's but it might be because it's a new location and they aren't in the swing of things yet. \\nOverall it was a great experience for both of them other than the stale chips.

Also the food takes forever, so if you're in a hurry do not go here. The bathroom is pretty gross - you get the feeling they never cleaned it after last night's rager. If management put emphasis on cleanliness and customer service, this place would be 4 stars. If they updated the decor and had more patio seating it could be 5."},{"name":"Wegmans","address":"53 Third Ave","city":"Burlington","stars":"4","text":"Good bakery, buffet, and selection of prepared foods.

This wonderful spot opened last summer and quickly became a favorite of mine.  The daily crudo specials are something to write home about with the diversified selection of fish from the popular yellowtail to the lesser known Spanish lubina or spot prawns.  What makes a crudo exceptional is the philosophy less is more.  The accompaniments are minimal and simple enhancing the flavors of each fish.  The light citrus flavors from the grapefruit provide the yellowtail with a refreshing bite perfect for the warmer weather.  \\n\\nRegardless of the time of year I am partial to pork belly, I believe it is the Asian in me that draws to the crispy skin of the pork and the delicate meat of the belly.  Although this dish may seem more suitable for the winter the Chef is able to make it seasonally appropriate with the additions of peaches or pomegranate.  The savory and sweet combination gets me every time!\\n\\nIf you can find it on the menu the sea urchin is a must.  There is a generous portion of uni in a beautifully presented sea urchin shell.  \\n\\nAbove all else I have consistently received exceptional service with every dining experience.

They brought over some pretty stale chips and some kind of watery tomato paste they were pawning off as salsa.\\n\\nI ordered the Sopes and in appearance they looked good but in taste, they had nothing. They were topped with black beans and red chile. The maza, beans and chile taste were no where to be found. It was like chewing on pasty flour water.

I don't know, maybe my palate has become more refined over the years or maybe I just know really good French onion soup when I see, er, taste it--but something about this bowl seemed canned.   Moving on to the main course, the quintessential comfort food:  fried chicken and mashed potatoes.  I will say that I usually avoid chicken when dining out simply because chicken seems so commonplace.  Why not try something I wouldn't ordinarily make at home?  On this particular evening, however, I was craving some classic home cooking, Food 101 style.  The chicken was plump and juicy; the potatoes perfectly creamy and well-seasoned.  My only \\"beef\\" with this savory chicken dish?   The green beans which were loaded down with way too much garlic.

The one bartender did the best he could keeping up with all of his tables and patrons sitting at the bar, but it was an impossible feat and management should have planned better or shifted staff from the dining room (which appeared to be much less busy). Visits to our table were few and far between, with drinks and food arriving even more slowly. We appreciated that the delays were acknowledged by the bartender and do not blame him at all. \\nFOOD-\\nA delicious meal would have helped to make up for the service, but no extra points here. When the oysters arrived (long after later arriving tables had already received theirs) they looked as though they had been opened with a hammer. Every single oyster had shards of shell in it and not a drop of brine. They were also not detached from the shell. Chicken parm entree came with a few small shreds of cheese on top (not exaggerating) and came atop undercooked pasta (not al dente- still hard). The neighbors chicken had full coverage of cheese, so I guess this was just luck of the draw. Creme brulee dessert was fine (good custard, sugar was bruleed unevenly with burnt bits and some raw sugar remaining).

Even better is that they make all their cheese in house, I honestly think I could devour it by the pound. The only negatives would be the pasta was a smaller portion than expected, but with flavors that great, I didn't mind! Another plus-- they gave us a sample of zucchini topped with cheese and their homemade dressing which was also tasty.

I have to admit that I had not been there for a number of years even though I live fairly close.  Now I know the reason.  The food is loaded with butter, cream and salt and quite expensive.  First of all, I recall that when Louis Perrotte owned the restaurant I would always get the bronzed fish (which was a white fish similar to grouper - nice and white and a decent portion).  On my most recent visit, I ordered the large portion (around $30) and when our waitress said that the meals would be up shortly I asked what type of fish it was that I ordered.  She told me that it was Kingklip.  I love fish and wasn't familiar with this one so I took out my phone and looked it up.  To my dismay it was an eel-like fish found off the South American coast (the picture of it was so unappealing and scary).  When the fish arrived the \\"large\\" portion was smaller than a deck of cards and the color of the fish was tan inside and had the distinctive taste and look of basa (a Vietnamese catfish).  So disappointing.  My friend ordered the scallops (around $33) which consisted of 4 scallops topped with crabmeat and cheese and again lots of salt and butter.  The sides included were as i remember--very small but tasty (again, the butter and salt).  I think the table next to us had the right idea.  They had eaten elsewhere and come in for just dessert (souffles).  Their desserts smelled incredible and they raved about them.  Unfortunately, after all of the butter and salt from the main meal my waistline couldn't handle dessert.

Lydia, the restaurant needs you!! Food was only average and priced far higher.  If you're going to pay top dollar, you should get the best. Service was fine, vibe is good--but:  Tandoori Scallop appetizer- they comped us because they didnt come out til the meal--had a problem getting the oven up to temperature.  They are bland and undercooked.  The brick chicken, dry and flavorless-supposed to be on a bed of something, but just a teaspoon of something supposed to be garlic whatever on the top--how do you make garlic flavorless?? And on the side a tablespoon smear of something pureed-it was tasty, but why so stingy?  The lamb was served practically raw after ordered medium.  there is rare and raw, the kitchen should know the difference--didnt order lamb sushi.  Gnocchi was ok, gnothing special- very small and mushy.  My date liked her fish, which means it was fine-\\nWould be nice if the waiter would try to steer you to the 'better dishes'--whether its the mozzerella bar, (have no idea what it is, didnt see one, its not described..just a cheese sampling plate i guess), or the breads, or whatever.

Burger was average, not great.  That being said, the service was poor.  Part of the order was forgotten, wait staff touching your plate multiple times to remove it when you are not done, having to ask to have your drink refilled then it doesn't happen, get an attitude from the waitress (NIKKI), etc..  I finally let them take my plate away after the third person grabbed at it even though I was only half way through my lunch.  I was still eating!  I'm usually a good tipper (20% or more if the service is good) but not this time.  Just the standard 15% which I felt was way more than generous.  I could have made a statement and left nothing but that's not my style.\\n\\nIt was my first AND last time at this place.  Too many other great restaurants in Portland that would gladly take my money.\\n\\nUpdate:  It's interesting...I sent an email, via their website, to the owners of Little Bird on 04/24/2013 letting them know what the experience was like with their wait staff.  It's been two days and not a word back.  I guess they don't see a problem and don't care.  Don't go there.  The food might be good but the service puts a lump in your stomach so no matter how good the food is, the whole experience is a downfall.  Nobody seems to care.  Very sad.  We'll see if it is still in business in a year.  The latest reviews are confirming my experience.  The waitress, NIKKI, should be replaced and the woman (the third person to touch and lift my plate with the frizzy hair and a nasty smell about her) who eventually took my half eaten plate away, should be replaced too.

However, the atmosphere left something to be desired.  I understand its an inexpensive lunch place, not fine dining.  Still, the fluorescent lights and gaudy white-and-blue decorations, in conjunction with the very loud Greek version of Muzak, make it unpleasant to be in for long periods of time.  They have an outdoor area I'll probably be taking advantage of during future trips. \\n\\nIt's also very strange that this Greek eatery doesn't serve falafel or hummus.  Perhaps the owners are purists that don't do the middle-eastern influenced Greek food, but all I know is that it's the first place I've ever been to that served Greek food without the inclusion of these two dishes.\\n\\nStaff so far has been very friendly.

Food was ok and nothing amazing, and definitely not anywhere near what I had expected. I went kind of early on Saturday for brunch since I heard the wait can get very long, but there was no wait and the restaurant was pretty empty. Parking can be tricky, so be sure to allocate some extra time to find parking in the nearby neighborhoods/streets since the parking lot is tiny.\\n\\nI will say that the bread basket you get is great. It includes buttermilk biscuits, which is one of my weaknesses. It was perfectly fluffy and crispy on the outside and it comes with an assortment of jams/jellies. I went ahead and ordered the Eggs T. Murphy per the waiter's recommendation. It wasn't anything special but definitely not a bad dish. My friend and I decided we wanted dessert at brunch, which was an aggressive move, but the bakery display case just looked so good. We shared the mocha cake, which is massive and can easily be shared with 1-2 other people. It's a super rich and chocolatey cake, which was amazing. I would definitely come here for their bakery.\\n\\nService was good as our waitress was really sweet and attentive, but overall I wouldn't come back for brunch.

I've been to Publick House a lot and love it, but actually think I like American Craft better. While the Publick House is awesome and has a lot of beer on tap so much of it so similar that the total number on tap is not quite as diverse as it seems at first while here the range was crazy. I also thought the bartender that was on was super knowledgeable. Most importantly when I asked about one of the beers he was not familiar with he actually said hold on let me go grab one of the other guys who knows more about that one then me. I really appreciated that instead of just pretending he know something about it. I also liked that he kept saying just try a little bit of this or that before you buy a whole glass so you don't get stuck with something you don't like. Some places will do this if you ask, but they basically had you try before you bought anything.\\n\\nSo the only thing other than not opening till 5 that I thought was odd was the bar setup. They had two bars on opposite sides of the place with different taps at each bar. So if you ordered a beer that happened to be on tap at the other bar the bartender had to go run over there and get it and then come back. It seemed terribly inefficient and must be a royal pain in the ass when its busy, but the bartender said it works out just fine.\\n\\nI will definitely be returning as the beer selection was top notch and the food sounded interesting, but I didn't try any on this trip."},{"name":"The Thurman Cafe","address":"183 Thurman Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"I have been going here WAY before they were on Man VS Food.

Being an LA person, I've sampled the greatest doughnuts, fresh from the fryer into my mouth and consider myself a mega Doughnut Enthusiast./Expert  The doughnuts from Revolution were stale with an overly-tough 'n' thick batter and overpriced.  A doughnut should be light and fluffy and .89cents.  The issue at hand is these treats don't really taste like doughnuts.  They are more of a cake and should be marketed as such.  In fact, if they were called Circle Cakes, I wouldn't think them overpriced.  However, if you are a Vegan, this place is awesome because it offers a ton of treaty Vegan options.

I am a frequent Postmates user and since SuperChefs is part of Postmates' Postmates plus program, I eagerly ordered their blueberry pancakes and a side of turkey bacon. My first impression was amazing, the smell of the food was overwhelmingly delicious before even opening the boxes, and after opening, I was surprised to find 8 PANCAKES, with side cups full of syrup, cream cheese lemon sauce, and a raspberry jam. But my disappointment came immediately after lifting the first stack of two pancakes out of the box. They were extremely cold, noticeably colder than the usual Postmates meal. I was going to just ignore that fact, try a bite, then nuke them in the microwave if need be. The next wave of dissatisfaction came after trying to saw through the pancakes with a butterknife. Not only were they cold, but they were EXTREMELY stale as well. It honestly felt like the pancakes had been made yesterday morning and weren't sold. They were dry, tough, cold, and the flavor was extremely underwhelming. I tried heating them up in the microwave, but the only problem that was fixed was the temperature. And the same things are to be said for the side of bacon. The three strips were cold, leathery, and dry. After eating the first two pancakes, I threw in the towel, along with the pancakes (into the trashcan).

I also liked the fact that they put olives on it, but I'm sure many others wouldn't be a fan. They don't skimp on the meat either, since the roll isn't super big.

I had a couple onion rings too, but for the price they charge you, there could have been a couple more. Just saying.\\n\\nService is unbelieveably slow. I wished they brought out our food as it was ready; not waiting for the entire party's food to be ready.

Well, I don't care how hot the water is, when something is cooked for 20 seconds, it doesn't hold its heat.  We felt all pastas were NOT warm enough/hot enough, by a large margin.

Though I frequently visit businesses in the area, time seldom permits me to  stop for a decent lunch, so I appreciated this opportunity. If street parking is inconvenient, there is also parking behind the restaurant. \\nI recommend Cafe Allegro because, for most, it's an undiscovered gem that will provide more than might be expected. It's a good choice for a small family with one or two well-behaved children. I cannot recommend it for large groups because seating is limited.

It says it's a \\"Taste of New Orleans\\" but the only Cajun food they have there is oysters, etouffee, jambalaya, red beans and rice and po boys. Cajun food is so much more than that. We ordered the jambalaya and the crab cake dinner. The bread was acceptable but the butter that came with it was a sweet honey butter and I hate sweet butter.  The house salads were nothing more than lettuce, a couple slices tomato, onion, carrot and cucumber that looked like it was put together by a five year old. Nothing else.  No croutons, no special house dressing or anything to make it special.  You can get a better, more creative salad from a fast food place.  And it was served with dressing in a little plastic souffle cup, as was the butter.  When you spend $25 and $29 on entrees on Park Ave, this is unacceptable.  The jambalaya lacked flavor and was nothing like real jambalaya in Louisiana.  The etouffee that came with the crabcakes was completely flavorless and again, not real etouffee.  We have eaten in New Orleans many times in in the finest restaurants as well as dive places and this was NOT real Cajun food.  We had to season our food completely with the spice blends on the table.  The crabcakes were average, had a lot of crab and not a lot of cake which was good, but they were forgettable.  I've had better had many other places.  I had to ask the waitress to refill my water.  Food was so underwhelming I didn't want dessert.  Didn't want to waste the calories.

I drink only a few times a year, and I bought two mixed drinks, and I felt almost no effect from the alcohol.  It is lively and people seemed to be having a good time.  The service was OK at best.

Flew in, thought I would hike over to this place for the hyped up lobster roll. \\n\\nThe place Opens at 11:30 and by 11:45 the place is packed to the ceiling. No surprise since this place is the size of a broom closet. Maybe 4 or 5 tables and a bar. Seriously... What a waste if their food is somewhat good.\\n\\nThe bar along with the service is where this place really fails and they do so in such a brazen manner. They pack the bar with way, way, waaaaaaaaaaaay too many stools. So you are literally crossing elbows with the guy on your left and your right. \\n\\nSince every table was filled, only a few odd places were available at the bar.  The hostess or waitress girl directed me to a stool between two guys, with literally only about 10\\" of bar space.  There were about 4 other places where I could have had more space.  But the waitress-hostess was not having it... as she told me in the most insensitive manner, \\"since I want to keep these open spaces for the next customer, I will squeeze you in here\\".  I guess the \\"next customer\\" had the winning ticket because apparently they had priority over me without even existing yet.  It took me all of 3 seconds, not a second more, before I said: \\"I ain't doing that!\\".\\n\\nI didn't even look at this rude pink hatter. I just walked out.  No way.  No way I'm paying $40 for a lobster roll in conditions fit for barn animals.\\n\\nI could even go bolder and say bellying up to that bar was almost identical to squeezing in-between a dozen newborn puppies at feeding time. To not allow me the end stool with more space simply because she wanted to keep reserved for a 3-fer or a 2-fer. Just plain rude. \\n\\nI have to rate this place a 1.  If the place was bigger, a 3. But the compact size of this place just seemed a bit odd to me. And take note I only tested the service and never tried the food. The service here was an absolute joke, and that joke was on me.  If I could use one word to describe Neptune's Oyster in Boston, it would be: Arrogance.  Capitalized, because they take the cake on pretentious rudeness.\\n\\nWent to another place. Gave the hipster waiter a 100% tip.

It was for dine in only, but I didn't read the fine print, and they kindly let this one slide.\\n\\nAnyway,  I think this is a solid sandwich.  It's definitely not the best I've had, but when someone clearly puts their heart into creating food, you can tell.  I had the Thai schnitzel sandwich on wheat.  It was a nice blend of their crispy, freshly friend chicken topped with a Asian-y cabbage/carrot slaw (a little spicy, had cilantro).  I had sweet potato fries to go with it, and they were really good -savory and had a little kick.  I had to wait about 5 minutes for them to complete the sandwich and fry the sweet potato, but it was worth waiting to get a piping hot sandwich. \\n\\nThe insides of the sandwich would have definitely gotten a 4. But I think more than 50% of how I feel about the sandwich has to do with the bread.   After eating in joints such as Paisano's and Sarcone's in Philly, I realized how important bread was to the entire experience.  Don't get me wrong, the bread was ok, but it was just that.  It was a regular ol' baguette roll and didn't have that floury, hard-on-the-outside, soft-on-the- inside thing going on.  For about $8 a sandwich, I would expect a little more attention to detail.  \\n\\nI haven't tried anything else on their menu yet, but it seems like there are a lot of creative things they've done with the chicken schnitzel.  You can get it American, Italian, Asian, etc.  I'll definitely come here again,but next time, I might stick with a wrap or a salad.

My hubby's rib eye came out, rare to medium rare, a lot of fat, some strange bread crumbs and 40 minutes later, the server came by to apologize.

I was worried the wait would be long and didn't want to waste too much time eating.. but it wasn't that bad! The line was out the door, but we got up to the front to order after maybe 15 minutes. It's quick because you order at the counter and then find a seat on your own. There's heated lamps when you're waiting outside though, so you can stay warm even when you're waiting outside in the winter! How nice. Anyway, my boyfriend and I decided to get the Reggie Deluxe, $9, (pretty much the best combo you can think of - egg, bacon, fried chicken, gravy) and a Hash Up, $6, (golden hash browns with chopped steak, grilled onions, mushrooms and melted cheese) because I was craving hash browns and from seeing other peoples orders, it looked huge! The food was delicious (see photo). I loved my Reggie Deluxe, the fried chicken was crispy and tender, yummy fried egg, good bacon and the perfect amount of tasty gravy that was enough to dip (and not drench) my biscuit in. The Hash Up was good too - generously portioned for only $6, and not just with the hash browns but with well seasoned beef, onions and mushrooms and cheese. I'd recommend both the Reggie Deluxe and the Hash Up.. so try to share both when you go and you'll leave with a happy belly :)  \\n \\nOverall, we were really satisfied with our brunch.. it was the perfect amount of food so we weren't tempted to overeat, and the total was only $17 for our meals and an organic apple cider too.

Also, their website claims they are \\"Home of the Sicilian Pizza King\\" and they have ricotta cheese, so naturally, I ordered just that: ricotta cheese and shrimp on sicilian crust.\\n\\nThe delivery was prompt (considering it was a sicilian on a Friday night) and the driver was very polite. He thanked me and wished me a good night, so points for customer service. Now, when I was first handed the box, my first impression was skeptical - it was smaller than I expected considering the price I paid, but I decided not to pass judgement until I tasted it. So, the first bite: mmmmm, wow, mmmmmOMNOMNOM. That means pretty darn delicious in case you were wondering. The shrimp was tender and flavorful, and the ricotta cheese was definitely good quality. While I wish they added slightly more ricotta, I know a lot of people prefer just a touch of ricotta on pizza. That being said, all the flavors mixed quite well. Also, the crust was as it should be for a sicilian: crisp around the edges, softer in the middle.\\n\\nIf the price was about $5 dollars less (comparable to La Mamma in Allston), I'd be hard pressed not to give DeNo's 5 stars, or at least say 4.5-ish. But, it is definitely deserving of a solid 4 stars.

Their nuoc mam was pretty good, the chicken was good texture and wasn't dry at all. The flavor was ok, nothing jumps at me. The pho came out with beef as a big blanket over the noodles, bean sprouts look home-grown (you know when the the heads are opened as if it has been re-grown), sauces came in a small dish, flavor was standard. The rice dish was quite small for the price of it, again I felt like they're skimping on ingredients. I felt like I was eating at an Americanized vietnamese restaurant. Although there's nothing wrong with it because it could be a great introduction to vietnamese food.

I actually saw a woman wearing a shower cap slapping a 2 year-old in the face outside the restaurant! (Yes, I told her I was going to call the police). And 2) because there are so many foods out on display, some dishes have completely died under the lights.

Their Buddha's Delight and Home Made Tofu is the same thing except they add pork in the Home Made Tofu (They simply just the ignore the differences in the cooking methods). And the fried tofu they put in the dishes are supplements that are bought from market, not fried by the chef as they are supposed to be. And again, the market-bought fried bean curd is a totally different kind from the regular tofu, and is usually used in other dishes in any decent Chinese restaurants. Moreover, these manufactured bean curds taste sour, indicating that they are not fresh anymore, and are on the edge of fermentation.\\n\\nThe most ridiculous thing is their Ma po bean curd (same as ma po tofu). It is a totally joke, because it is nothing like ma po tofu, except that there are tofu in it. The flavor is everthing that a ma po tofu is not!

They don't even have real maple syrup - I'm sorry but that fake crap is unacceptable. I'm willing to pay extra for maple syrup if that's what I need to do. The service was fine, but really that just doesn't matter if the food is bad.\\n\\nHonestly, I could do a lot better myself with not a whole lot of effort. Even if I'm feeling too lazy to cook, this place isn't worth it. My advice, take the extra drive and go to a real breakfast place - Ball Square Cafe or In a Pickle in Waltham immediately come to mind.

On nights like these, often after class, my friends and I walk down to Pho Pasteur on Washington.  Located on the border between Chinatown and the Theater District, in an area formally known as the \\"Combat Zone\\" it becomes very clear that you are not on Newbury.  This is solidified by looking at the prices on the menu, they are on the very low side for Boston.  \\n\\nTypically a meal for two with a small starter gives me change back on a $20.  The value more than makes up for the spotty service.  Expect to be seated very promptly then ignored, then have your order taken, but your entrees come out all at different times.  I have been there with a party of four and had each persons entree come out at a different time.  This can be very frustrating for those with manners who wait for all to have plates in front of them before eating.  The staff makes up for this problem, which likely originates in the kitchen, with friendliness and responsiveness.  \\n\\nThis place, for me at least, is all about the soup, the Pho is outstanding in my opinion.  My recommendation is to go for the Extra Large with the works - this has beef brisket, flank steak, and rare steak all sliced thin, with tripe and tendons in a hearty beef stock on top of noodles.  The rare steak is shaved so thin that it cooks while you eat.  You may be shy about eating the tripe, but get it anyways as it adds to the whole flavor of the soup.  What really separates this from other competitors is the noodles, they are snappy and never overcooked - amazing! Notable standouts on the menu are the Pad Thai and the Chao, a Vietnamese Chicken rice soup/porridge. If I even so much as sneeze I order the chao- which I am probably misspelling and I almost always mispronounce.  Also, make sure to try the quail as a starter, they prepare the wings of this rare game bird pretty savory.    Next time you are down in Chinatown and are in the mood for soup but don't feel like spending a small fortune on shabu make sure you try this place."},{"name":"The Elder Tree Public House","address":"469 Flat Shoals Ave SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Awesome staff and a few fun games to crush your gf at.

The greens in the salad were fresh but the yogurt maple dressing had not hint of maple just a watery white dressing and the chicken served on the salad was cold and way overcooked and dry.

Thankfully, another \\"waiter\\" saw and took our order while we were still in line. I with I could say this made all the difference in the speed with which we received our orders. It did not. \\n\\nAfter ordering, we sat down. The waiter brought out waters in styrofoam cups. Then, a fair bit later, some silverware. Then, after two reminders, our actual drinks. Perhaps this stalling technique was to make us less aware of how much time was passing until we got our food. Before I knew it, half an hour had passed, and it's not like this place was busy at all. \\n\\nFinally the food arrives, and I guess I should've read more carefully. The \\"combo\\" is apparently served in to-go containers. The opposite of how you'd think of the specialty of the house to be served. The REALLY confusing part is that it's not just packed up, it's packed in 6-7 little individual styrofoam cups and packed into a paper bag and handed to you, which leaves you with a \\"Get the heck out,\\" kinda feeling. We even had to ask our confused waiter to bring us some plates so we could actually eat the food we ordered. Seriously.

Unfortunately though, we weren't the only ones. The place was absolutely packed. We were told it would be a 40 minute wait so we agreed to wait. I enjoyed a nice cold one from the bar while the hubby and kiddos munched on a family favorite, fried pickles. Everywhere we go, we have to have the fried pickles. Tibby's pickles were pretty good.\\n\\n40 minutes passed. We asked for an update. \\"Waiting for a group to leave.\\" 50 minutes. No change. 60 minutes. Still no change so we asked for a manager. 15 minutes later we were finally seated at a table that the manager cleaned off himself. \\n\\nThen, to add insult to injury, we were given Mr. Turtle... the slowest moving, most social server I have had in years! Years, people! He would meander through the restaurant talking to random tables that were not his and meanwhile leaving us waiting for drinks. He was in such la la land that our shrimp appetizer arrived minutes before our entree. Not really an appetizer at that point. We asked for drink refills again and Mr. Turtle Meander returned with 2 of the 3 drinks 15 minutes later and then had to go back to get the third one because he forgot about it.\\n\\nBy the time we were done eating our fabulous Rita's Chicken Cutlets (perfectly fried chicken), flavor-in-every-bite Chicken Pontchartrain, and the dreamy Shrimp & Andouille Cheddar Grits, we were ready to go.

Ladies and gents, if it wasn't for the fabulous entertainment to distract us from the 2 1/2 hours it took to have our first Tibby's experience, this rating wouldn't even get a three. Quite frankly, they made me feel punished for dining there with kids. Other diners without kids got in and out, and treated to better service than we did.

My wife tends to go toward a more natural presentation, but she found it to be good also.\\n\\nWe were looking for something special, but the steaks while tempting seemed too filing if we were planning for desert.  So, my wife ordered the Alaska Halibut stuffed with Dungeness Crab and I ordered a Argentine Lobster.  Our server was very patient with my rudimentary knowledge of wine and recommended a very nice white from the Arthur vineyard.  Its very light oak taste almost had me thinking it was aged in stainless steel.  But it went very well with our seafood as it really operated as a palate cleanser leaving us prepared for the next good bite of food.\\n\\nMy lobster was cooked well, but my wife was someone disappointed that the stuffed halibut was not actually stuffed, the crab was sitting on top of the halibut, not inside the halibut.  Don't get me wrong it was still good -- she gave me a bite and she did enjoy it with the saffron rice -- but it was more the description did not match the delivery.\\n\\nMy lobster was good, but what was incredible were the whipped potatoes.  I swear I have not had potatoes that good since 1989, when I was in France.  We laughed that it was probably only cream and butter, but they were delicious with the wine, asparagus, and lobster.\\n\\nWe finally finished up with coffee, their fried banana donut holes, and shared a glass of Grand Marnier.

If you are hungry, then definitely order the Reggie for yourself; but the size was perfect for us two gals.  And everything about this meal was ON POINT - juicy chicken breast, fried egg, TILAMOOK cheddar, and the gravy was damn good.   As for the hash brown, they serve it as a flat 10-12 inch slab and it's the perfect side for the filling biscuit.  And you can't beat the price.\\n\\nDefinitely be prepared to line up  But the line up goes fairly quick (at least it did at 10am on a Saturday), but just do some jumping jacks while you are in line to pre-burn off some of those calories you will soon enjoy."},{"name":"Lovely's Fifty Fifty","address":"4039 Mississippi Ave N, Ste 101","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"They should call it Ice Cream and Pizza.\\n\\nMy wife and I are trying to get through our 100 places to stuff your faces book.

We got there right at 5 on a Saturday and the place filled up pretty quick.  \\n\\nFor a starter we got the Brussels sprouts with Butter polenta.  It was rich and sinful and yummy.  However It was a little one note, not that buttery goodness is a bad note to have.  \\n\\nWe then got two pizzas, the basic margarheta and the one with gorgonzola  and prosciutto.  The crust was amazing.  It was definitely wood fired with a little char to it, but not burned to a crisp.  I like a little more crust on my pizza, but this amount was at least minimally sufficient.  I love how the pizza holds together and you don't have a limp floppy mess (not the first time I've heard that).  Our only criticism is that the cheese is a little light.  I wouldn't say no to more, especially if I'm paying that much.  \\n\\nAfter the meal we had their salted caramel ice cream and mint straccatella.  The salted caramel was the perfect blend of sweet and salty.  Very nice rich texture too.  The mint one was amazing.  Very true to life fresh minty flavor.

No major disappointments, but the other dishes could have been better. Also rather small portions across the board.\\nService was good not great. Ultimately at this restaurant your paying for the location. While the food is good there's nothing that's going to bring me back.

Hoping to avoid the typical hordes of hungover hipsters, I pulled into the parking of the infamous castellated Sandy Blvd eatery better known as Clyde's. Fortunately, our luck was about to change -- in more ways than one. The restaurant section was closed but the dark, stygian lounge with deep, comfy booths provided the ideal, quiet hideaway to cool off and break our unintentional fast. The joint had an undeniable aura about it: from its deplorable racist origins (look it up) to legendary steakouse and jazz club to it's current incarnation. I quickly downed a tall iced tea and ordered the fried chicken breast with mashed potatoes, gravy and sauteed spinach. Fifteen minutes later I finshed off my last bite and seriously considered licking the plate. And I don't even like spinach. Ask anyone. The Mrs. was equally sated with her Caesar Salad and French Onion Soup, and then begged off to try her luck on the gambles located in the back. As usual, she won -- this time taking home a c-note.

It's not the restaurants fault that you're too cheap to pay for garage parking. Not their problem.\\n\\nSecond, people with allergies. If you know damn well that you have a shellfish or seafood allergy, why the f**k would you go to a seafood restaurant. That's just lack of common sense not just to me but to anyone.\\n\\nNow let's get down to the real review. There aren't that many seafood boil places in Boston as it's a fairly new concept around here but Bootleg Special is definitely different from those available in the area. \\n\\nBootleg Special is seafood boil but with asian influences, most commonly found in parts of Texas. What sets them apart from the other places is definitely the service. You're not going to get servers who just plop a plastic bag full of seafood in front of you and not talk to you for the rest of the night. Servers here actually pay attention to their guests and make sure all of their needs and wants are satisfied.\\n\\nThe food here comes out fairly quickly. One big asian influence is that the food is meant to be shared, family style is highly encouraged here. If you're dining in and everyone orders their own \\n\\"entree\\", you're doing it wrong.\\n\\nSo down to the main part of this review; what do people order?\\n\\nThe \\"Bootleg Special\\" is definitely the main item on the menu. It is approximately three pounds of seafood smothered in one of the three sauces available (coconut curry basil is to die for.) It also comes with corn potatoes and sausage (it's in the description but i have found that most people don't like to read menus so i'll just include here.)\\n\\nGarlic Noodles are my absolute favorite. There noodles with butter garlic and some sauce of the asian descent (soy sauce, oyster sauce, fish sauce, who knows it's crack.)\\n\\nWings and Ribs are also some must haves. The wings are drenched in a tangy korean sauce (gochujang for those who know what that is) and it does have a little bit of a kick to it. The ribs on coke have no cocaine on it whatsoever but it taste like it is. Give it a try, I'm not going to ruin the experience by telling you what it taste like.\\n\\nNow if you made it this far into my review I just have one last thing to say. Although Bootleg Special does not have a full bar, they do have a cordial license. For you uncultured swines that don't know what that means, it means they serve beer, wine, and liquor that has some kind of sugar content in it. No it does not mean the alcohol is fake it just means theres flavoring or sugar in it. Try taking 4 shots of Jack Daniels honey and tell me that you're drinking fake booze because i guarantee you can still get drunk off your ass here if you drink enough. Then again, you're in  a pretty nice neighborhood so let's not try to do that.\\n\\nPictures will be up shortly, it doesn't hurt to read every now and then"},{"name":"Pine State Biscuits","address":"2204 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Yum!!!!!!

I ordered a dish of scrambled eggs, spinach, and goat cheese on rye toast. I asked for the bacon to be left off. The food was ok. The eggs weren't salted during cooking, leaving them tasting a little flat. It's hard to dislike anything with goat cheese, though.

Expected to wait on a busy Saturday night, and we were told an hour for the table. Two hours later, we finally got seated. I can understand going 15-20 minutes over an estimate, but double the time? Off by an *hour*? Not acceptable.\\n\\nOnce we finally got seated, our waitress came right over to take our appetizer order. We got the hot wings (meh), calamari (exceptional) and meatballs (exceptional). The food came out fast and hot, which was important since we were starving after waiting 2 hours for the table.\\n\\nUnfortunately, that's where the good service ended. Our waitress took at least half an hour after the apps were delivered to come back to take our dinner order, and we couldn't even find another server to ask her to come over for us. The food took quite awhile coming out of the kitchen. We had two with the buttermilk fried chicken (very good), and one with a burger (amazingly delicious). I had the gnocchi bolognese. TERRIBLE. Possibly the worst meal I've ever gotten in a restaurant. The gnocchi were too soft, and the sauce looked and tasted exactly like Chef Boyardee or Franco American. The braised short rib was tender but flavorless, and tasted like it came out of the same cheap can of kids pasta as the sauce.\\n\\nThe real issue is that once again our waitress had once again gone MIA. By the time we finally got a bus boy's attention to ask her to come over, the rest of the party had mostly finished their meals (with some help from me). She asked me if I wanted something different, which was completely pointless by then, as I didn't want to extend the wait even further while another meal was cooked for me, then have to eat it while everyone else was sitting around.\\n\\nThe manager did come over and apologize, asked specifically what was wrong with my meal so he could relay it to the kitchen, and ended up taking it off the check.

After two more minutes, I am ready, but when she passes by and I ask if she can take my order, she barks, \\"I'm not your server anymore.\\" I have to wait five more minutes for another server. I receive my bourbon, finally. Ten or fifteen minutes later, I need to leave, so I try to flag the server down to get my check. Crickets. Five minutes pass. Crickets. Ten minutes pass. Crickets. I finally have to go inside the restaurant to find the server, but the only one I can find it the server who told me to bug off earlier. Still, I need my check, so I ask her if she could grab it. Some irritated mumbling came back. Five minutes later, still no check, so I go inside the restaurant again and find that my waitress is in the process of printing it.\\n\\nOn Sunday morning, my wife went down to grab coffee and a croissant. There are two entrances to the restaurant--one facing outside and one facing the hotel. Since we were guests at the Fairmont, she went to the hotel-facing entrance and waited. And waited. And waited some more. No one bothered to come by and see if she needed service. Finally, she sat down at the bar. A waitress behind the bar asked if she needed anything, so she orders a coffee and croissant. Lo, the hostess, however, sees that my wife is sitting at the bar and comes over and yells at her for sitting there, as the bar as apparently closed. My wife explains that she waited forever for service. The hostess regrettably says she can stay, and huffs off. A few minutes later, when my wife receives her coffee and croissant, the hostess changes her mind and demands she move to a table. Of course, what is happening at the same time? More hotel guests are queuing up at the hotel entrance, with nary a hostess (and especially not the angry hostess) coming over to assist them. See, the hotel is apparently too cheap or too lazy to put up a sign directing hotel guests to the main entrance (despite at least one server claiming that they've asked management to put up such sign), sowing confusion.\\n\\nOn a Monday morning, we had breakfast. For once, the service was passable. So was the food, but only passable. I had the corn beef hash, which taste was just a bit better than the canned corn beef hash that we all greedily devoured as children. This was a far cry from the marvelous hash at, say, the Blue Duck Tavern or similar establishment. \\n\\nIf you're captive at the hotel, you might have to come here for breakfast.

Some of the combos get really interesting and use ingredients such as sweet potatoes, Canadian bacon, balsamic figs, and pico de gallo.

The Lafayette location is closer to my mom's house but it had really bad reviews so I went to the Boulder location just to be safe. \\n\\nFirst thing, we waited awhile at the front since the hostess was not there to seat us right away. We finally got seated and no one comes for a long time to take our drink orders. Some guy brought us chips and salsa while we waited, long enough to already decide what we wanted. Our waiter finally came and got all of our orders in. Then I noticed this huge chip bucket behind my brothers head, it looks like they just scoop out chips from that bucket to give to each table. I understand this is more efficient but this also tells me that the chips are definitely not fresh at all. It was nearing the bottom of the bucket until they dumped a batch of new chips in. This means that the bottom chips we got, could have been days or even weeks old since they just dump new chips on top of the old ones!! Anyway, I ordered a beef \\"big burrito\\" subbing mild vegetarian red sauce with the lean tender pork chili verde instead (which costs $2.50 extra) with a side of lettuce, tomato, onion combo ($1.95) which could easily be shared among two people. The burrito itself was just okay... Not bad but not mouthwatering good either. It was definitely very spicy. The spice was tolerable at first, but the heat really builds!! I am someone that cannot tolerate really spicy food, so this might just be me. Also another thing to note is that usually I prefer ground beef for burritos, but I guess they use beef chunks here instead, which I am not a fan of. I took half of my burrito home because it was just too spicy to finish.\\n\\nAnother thing to mention is that the service here is really bad, even worse than at Asian restaurants. We were all done eating and no one ever came to give us the bill or even fill our waters. I made eye contact with several employees including our own server and they always look away!?!? 15 minutes later the server finally fills our water and we ask for the bill, but of course it did not come right away. We paid cash to avoid waiting any longer. I read reviews of bad service here, which I would expect if they were extremely busy, but they were definitely not busy, since I see them occasionally standing around. Needless to say, I prefer Santiago's burritos and service over Efrain's. I might come back to try something else, but it is not on my list of priorities.\\n\\nPros:\\n- Definite spice and flavor to the food\\n\\nCons:\\n- Painfully slow service even when not busy\\n- Food is mediocre"},{"name":"Patrizi's","address":"2307 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Disclaimer: I'm writing this review to balance out a two-star review because I feel guilty.\\n\\nFirst things first - expect a wait.

It was incredibly windy and impossible to sit and talk, let alone eat.

The hostess moved us and said \\"You have one hour\\" as she walked away. Really? Nice attitude. \\nSo our waitress comes by and introduces herself. She begins to recite the specials for the day but then, in the middle of her speech, she stops and says, \\"You know, all the specials are good. Just take my word for it.\\" I am not sure if she forgot what she was saying or just didn't care to finish telling us the specials, but it was really odd and off-putting.

The corn tortillas were awesome and the pork was so tender and well seasoned. \\nWe finished up our food and requested the check. We paid with a gift card we had received.

But I will start with the pro's:\\n\\nI'm mostly a scratch cook so I'm not generally at supermarkets to get prepared foods, but if you are, this is a good option because their prepared foods are almost like a mall food court, and there is very pleasant seating upstairs for you to eat.  I suppose if you're tired from shopping at the Burlington Mall and you don't want to go home and cook, you could stop here and eat on your way home. \\n\\nAlso if you are from upstate New York and there are special brands that you miss,  apparently this store is not to be missed; I wouldn't know however. \\n\\nI noticed that they have a larger selection of kosher foods than most supermarkets in the area, so that would definitely be another reason to come if you keep kosher.  \\n\\nOtherwise, I thought it was miserable.  It is hard to get in and out quickly, when you have to go into a parking garage you know it's going to be a time commitment. \\n\\nInside it's noisy, packed with people, and deliberately time-consuming to navigate, with all kinds of distractions as you try to make your way to the basics on your shopping list, because they know the longer you're in there the more you'll spend, so they really make it hard to get to what you want quickly and get out.  There are some good values, but the strategy is those are loss leaders to involve you in the higher-priced prepared or speciality foods.  \\n\\nIf you are looking for an inexpensive alternative to cooking, however, getting something prepared here at the stalls will be cheaper and better than most take-out and everyone in your party can get what they want. \\n\\nAs for me I could not wait to get out. It was exactly like being at Ikea, you could spend a lot of time here and get something kind of cool and different but actually being in the store is annoying, loud, disorienting, and exhausting."},{"name":"Yuko Maki Sushi","address":"1540 Lonsdale Ave","city":"North Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"It's hard to give a review of this place because take away is a 5 but eat in is a 1.

My partner has been several times for lunch, and since my Mom was visiting from Los Angeles, we though we would try dinner Saturday night. Service was great, and all of the staff was very knowledgeable about the menu and offerings. The food, however, left us wondering what the hype is about. Even my partner, who was the one who thought we should go based on his lunch experiences, was seriously disappointed. We had the following:\\n\\nSoup of the day: Cold zucchini, cucumber, avocado soup with blistered tomatoes. There was a very odd seasoning/taste in there, so we asked what it was. Supposedly it was chermoula (garlic & mint). Whatever was going on there, was just bizarre. We all have different palates, but all 3 of us agreed that this was \\"off\\".\\n\\nSheep cheese turnovers - I didn't try this, but my partner liked it. All I can tell ya!\\n\\nSalmon special of the day- The only standout dish. The salmon was cooked perfectly, and was lightly seasoned to let the fresh fish shine. \\n\\nBurger- I ordered this, based on reviews, and other articles I've read. Supposedly it is one of the top burgers in town, according to some. I couldn't disagree more. The quality of the beef was excellent, and it was cooked as requested. The flavors, and everything just didn't \\"pop\\", and it was very bland and unremarkable. The bun was rather thick, so I felt like I was eating a lot of bread, instead of letting the bun be the vessel for the burger. The toppings and everything were just not that amazing. I don't do foie gras, so I can't comment on how that affects the burger. I would rather have Little Big Burger any day over what I had last night.\\n\\nPanna Cotta- Classic panna cotta topped with cherries and kataifa, which I found out is finely shredded phylo dough. The topping was excellent and had a lot of crunch which was a nice contrast to the smooth and soft panna cotta. \\n\\nMaybe lunch is different??? I don't know, but I was not impressed.

Get in or get out, otherwise the poor people at the end of the counter will suffer for your lack of manners.\\n\\n3) Don't be afraid to sit at the counter, especially if the seats face the street, it's like looking into a fishbowl as people walk back and forth in front of you."},{"name":"SuperChefs Breakfast & More","address":"199 E Broad St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"A nice spot to grab a quick bite to eat.

I will also reiterate other comments about how extremely noisy and hipster-ish this place is.

I stopped by after class for lunch, and most of the tables were taken, but I managed to miss the lunch rush.\\n\\nA note for n00bs like me: there is no hostess stand, but if you are planning to dine-in, grab a table and order from a server. I assumed it was an order at the counter kind of situation, but apparently that's only for take-out. \\n\\nI was feeling vegetarian that day so I ordered an old favorite of mine, channa masala. The gentleman who took my order (I'm presuming he is the owner) asked me if I'd ever had channa butter masala, and I said no, and he said that I would love it, so I went with it. It wasn't until later, when I was on their website trying to find the name of the dish that I realized that he upsold me to a more expensive dish. I see what you did there, friendly order taker guy. But I won't hold it against him because it was very tasty and it was like $1 more (it's on the menu as channa makhni masala). I also got a side order of roti, though in hindsight I should have gotten naan.\\n\\nI found a table and my food came out in about 5-10 minutes, albeit in to-go containers. The waitress even brought me a glass of water, a plate, and silverware after she asked if I was dining in (this was when I realized that dine-in orders should be done through the waitstaff).\\n\\nThe food was very good, though I can't compare it to my favorite Indian place in Austin (Swad) because I haven't had the same dish there. Maybe next time I will stick to my guns and get the channa masala and we'll see whose is better.\\n\\nIf you're a fan of Indian food, you should definitely make a trip to Teji's."},{"name":"Halal Bros","address":"2712 Guadalupe St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"The food was decent but the service over the phone was extremely sub-par.

Sure, there's the fact that every time I've gone there I've been hungover, which in turn only leads me to stare into the abyss of alcoholism laid out before me, but isn't Jam's very existence an onslaught against these demons of tomorrow and ghouls of yesterday?  Breakfast is the celebration of daybreak, a joyous testament to the fact that the fucked up shit I did last night couldn't destroy my soul's never ceasing quest for the delicious.  To me, Jam is the ultimate exercise in the zen and now.  It's like a lover or a good dog; someone who sees that distant look in your eyes and says \\"hey buddy, we'll all be there eventually.  For now lets just eat some delicious breakfast.\\"  \\n\\nAnd a delicious breakfast it is!!!  I'm sure there are people who would say the food is too salty, but would those same people slight our majestic oceans for a similar fault?  If adventure is the call of the day, wouldn't I rather find myself crashing against the waves of a delicious scramble or plate of corned beef hash than find myself mired in the banal puddle of IHOP or (God forbid) Red Robin?  For those who have yet to temper themselves against Jam's flavorful onslaught, I say back to land, naves!!!  Never on a listless and unforgiving sea does a crew mutiny against Captain Delicious!!!!\\n\\nOnly on the finest vessel could a high hope for deliciousness be maintained, and Jam is near the finest of the fleet.  If our volley against the corporate shill is to see life imitate art, then Jam is the concept's very essence.  The interior is cramped and forgettable, much like a mess hall on the high seas, but its the players involved who make the experience sparkle.  The service crew is top notch, and the ambiance provided by Hawthorne is second to none.  Any place where a man with an eye patch tries to teach would-be patrons sidewalk etiquette can always be expected to entertain.  \\n\\nHail and well met, Jam!

We had a group of almost 20 people, and while I understand that handling a large group will not always go smoothly, there is absolutely no excuse for how poorly it was handled.\\n\\nThe majority of the group was seated between 7:30 - 7:45, there was no real rhyme or reason to the way the orders were taken or when they were taken for that matter.  Around 8:15 the gentleman asked if people would like appetizers, the person at the first seat ordered and he left, not taking orders from anyone else at the table, and did not return until hers was ready.  Even at this point, people had to ask him to take their order, he was just going to drop it down and leave.\\n\\nWater was not refilled and no one returned, so one of our dining companions went and got the pitcher from the hostess stand next to the women's restroom and filled glasses at the table, which earned her dirty looks.  Unfortunately that still didn't prompt them to be more attentive.\\n\\nWe finally were able to order dinner, though one order came significantly after everyone else received theirs, one was completely forgotten and had to be requested specifically by going to the register, because again, no one ever. came. back.\\n\\nGetting the check ended up being a joke as well - even though a some people had requested separate checks and was told this was not a problem, we received one check for the entire party.   We were able to get that split up by taking it directly to the register, since again, no one ever came back to our table without someone going and asking for assistance, other than to pick up dirty dishes.\\n\\nI'm honestly disappointed that I recommended this place for a friend's birthday, the whole experience was absolutely lacking.   By the time all was said and done we had been there for over 3.5 hours, most of which was spent waiting for someone, anyone, to pay attention to us and provide the type of service for which I know they are capable."},{"name":"Redbones BBQ","address":"55 Chester St","city":"Somerville","stars":"3.5","text":"My old review still stands: tasty food, decent prices, great beer list, cool casual vibe... \\n\\nbut I'm shocked at how much Underbones has transformed into a kiddie play area lately. At a recent birthday dinner, there were parents breastfeeding at their table, at 9 PM (so many things wrong with that statement...). At dinner there this weekend, all but one of the tables had small children at it, and I was horrified to find Redbones now has a kid's menu (who's next, Pour House???). \\n\\nLook, you can take your hellspawn to the upstairs part for all I care, which is brightly lit, non-porous, and if not actually family-friendly, at least more conducive to children making a mess. But leave my Underbones alone; let me and my childless friends enjoy our beer and meat in peace. Underbones is dark, cramped, noisy, porous, dirty, colorful, and a full out bar scene filled with raucous adults happily partaking in the 30 beers on tap... nothing about that says \\"hey, this is a great place for kids!\\". People, stop trying to pretend you're still young and hip by bringing your brats to your old haunts, the last thing the rest of us want to deal with is flying food and screaming children (yes that happened... for gods' sake, take your brats outside when they start to cry, have some respect for your fellow patrons!). \\n\\nI felt especially bad for the staff; it took no less than 4 of them to clean the table behind us after it had been destroyed by a bunch of small brats, vacuuming and all. I'll be the first to admit I am not a fan of children, but I get actively pissed when I'm forced to deal with them in a place I consider a sanctuary away from the crying and the annoyingness. It's really frustrating to see this trend spreading throughout the city, and I shudder to think how many other places are changing in this way... can't you leave us adults in peace?"},{"name":"Tasty n Alder","address":"580 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"This review is strictly based on the Duck Duck Steak and Fries. \\n\\nMy boyfriend and I visited a little past noon on Sunday and were told the wait was going to be an hour, however were called in about 30 minutes or so, which was great! \\n\\nI intended on trying the Polenta and Sugo, but unfortunately they'd sold out before I had the chance. \\n\\nThe portions are meant to be shared, however, I may have a different idea of family style as I noticed they weren't that much bigger than the typical brunch portions served locally. \\n\\nThe reason for the 3 stars was that both of my dishes were too salty for my liking.

I think this place has potential but I'm not sold yet.  The cake doughnuts were very strange to me; the texture was not what I'm used to.  Is it because they are baked, not fried?  The yeast were better, but still a little chewy.  I guess my main problem that I found with both types was basic lack of real flavor in the actual dough.  They all fell flat.  I realized that once you got through the spiced sugar on the outside that there was no defining flavor to the dough.  It was strange; there was no lingering flavor in my mouth.  I wanted a bit of yeast flavor and definitely some more salt.

My wife ordered the sandwich.  She ordered sweet potato fries for her side but they were out.  She really didn't want any of the other sides but since 1 was included, she ordered the regular fries.  She then asked again if the fries were included with the sandwich and the employee confirmed they were.  When asked about a beverage, she stated she would just have water.  I ordered a platter which included 2 sides.  As an individual side, the hummus was priced higher than the other sides so I asked if the hummus would count as 1 of the 2 included sides for the platter.  The cashier/cook/server replied yes.  So I ordered the hummus and 1 other side.  For a beverage, I ordered a soft drink.  When I was handed the credit card slip (without detailed pricing), the amount seemed higher than my quick math but I signed it anyway.\\n\\nAfter receiving the detailed receipt, I saw that we were charged an additional $2.25 for the fries that were \\"included\\" with the sandwich.  When I immediately inquired about the fries, the cook/cashier/server confirmed that the fries were included.  He was speaking loudly because he was trying to cook at the same time.  I thought maybe I missed something so I sat down and looked at the receipt again and I then noticed I was also charged $1.00 for the hummus.\\n\\nWhen he served the food, I showed him the receipt and stated that fries were supposed to be included with the sandwich, and the hummus was supposed to be included with the platter.  He then informs me that to get the fries included, he had to charge us for a combo.  Never mentioned that before but ok....but if he charged us for the combo (which includes a drink), why did we get charged for 2 drinks when we only got 1?  His response was that my wife got water with her combo (the combo we never ordered) and that I ordered a soda with my platter.  So even though we only ordered 1 drink total, we were charged for 2 because of the way it was rung up.  That's interesting.  And the $1 charge for the hummus?  He stated that it is included with the platter...you just have to pay more. \\n\\nI'm not sure if the cook/cashier/server was being intentionally deceptive or if he was just unfamiliar with the menu/pricing.  It wasn't a lot of money but it added $5 to a $18 bill.  With 3 independent line items wrong on the bill (charged for 2 drinks because of the way the order was entered, charged for fries that we different really want but were \\"included\\" with the sandwich, and charged for hummus that was \\"included\\" with the platter), it was hard to enjoy the meal.  We clearly disagreed with the charges but the employee was unapologetic, made no effort to correct the bill, and seemed to feel like it was our fault for assuming that \\"included\\" meant \\"included at no additional charge\\". \\n\\n0 stars for service.  3.5-4 stars for the food (maybe would have been 4-4.5 if I wasn't so irritated during the meal).  Average the 2 and you get 2 stars.\\n\\n(If I ignore what the employee told us and go strictly by the menu, which I've now looked at in detail, it appears the sandwich should not have included a side.  But that doesn't change the fact that the employee told us otherwise, and that we were still overcharged for the drinks and charged an additional amount for the hummus that we were told was included)"},{"name":"Rosa Mexicano","address":"245 18th St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Eh, fresh made guacamole next to the table was the high point of the meal.

Waits are prominent ranging from 30min-1.5 hours. Unless you are a tourist or 1 person in your party draws the short stick to arrive early and wait, I would also contemplate the To-Go route next door.\\n\\nFood - It's Man v. Food featured, right? You have to try the Thurminator or the Thurman Burger. Both are monster sized. I love food and hamburgers are right up my alley. I've never finished a whole Thurminator. Normally, I eat half and then just the meat on the other side. Thurman Burger is equally good but definitely capable of being finished by a regular customer.\\n\\nSides - Focus on that burger too long, fries become cold so beware. Onion rings are a great side here. They are cooked golden brown and come out HOT!\\n\\nAtmosphere - Ranges from HH where folks are there for a bite to eat and drinks to Man v. Food fanatics wanting to try the food. Some booths can be tight laterally but fits up to 8 people (burger joint with tight booths... hrmmm?). A few tables seat 2-4 and the staff does a great job of trying to optimize seats.\\n\\nServers - Great at providing what you need. Checking it on you. Host/Hostess is constantly gauging the dining room to try to predict when guests can be seated driven by if guests are lounging after meals and how quickly food comes out.\\n\\nParking - Street parking is usually available within 5 doors of Thurman's as there is patron turnover and subsequently the parking."},{"name":"JJ's Fresh From Scratch","address":"2950 Curry Ford Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Would've given 5 stars but I called my order in and felt very rushed on the phone.

My friend said her aztec margarita was also not too great. \\nI lived in Texas a long time and I've had great Tex Mex food so I have very high standards for this cuisine.  We had their queso for a starter and while it wasn't as good as the queso in Texas, it was tasty.  They don't make it the traditional way, instead it had some type of very tangy cheese in it.  It was an interesting and enjoyable flavor, though.  Aztec Willie's is also very, very stingy with their chips.  The baskets of chips they bring out when you sit down are tiny and the amount of chips served with the queso was surprisingly small. Chips can't cost all that much, c'mon guys!\\nFor dinner, I ordered the chicken nachos.  My one complaint with many Tex Mex places is that the food is often very bland.  This was not the case here.

I know, shame on me. Its popularity instilled fear within me - fear of the crowds, the lines, the hangry folks impatiently waiting eggs, coffee, and mimosas. Atlanta takes its weekend brunches seriously, with wait-times of 30 minutes at the average restaurant. \\n\\nHowever, a good friend of mine was leaving to study abroad for 2 years and, when asked where she'd like to eat before she left, she told me she wanted to try Murphy's brunch. She had only ever been there for dinner and, like me, has heard rave reviews from everyone here about the brunch experience. \\n\\nWe arrive at Murphy's on a Sunday at 11:45, braced for a long, long wait. A \\"complimentary\\" valet greeted us at the door and parked the car for us. When we walked in, we were pleasantly surprised to learn that there was a table open for us right away. We got to sit out on the patio right by the window, and it was gorgeous. Pretty little flowers, bright sunlight, and pedestrians for some people-watching - what more could we want on a Sunday morning? \\n\\nOur server was very sweet and helpful. She offered answers to our questions and, when she didn't know the answer, she volunteered to find out for us. I found Murphy's brunch menu to be rather pedestrian. Nothing stood out as particularly unique. They only had 1 option each of the sweeter dishes (waffles, pancakes, and french toast) and a variety of egg dishes. After much debate, I ordered the Eggs Slum Mulligan and my friend got the Eggs Virginia Highland + a side of French Toast. \\n\\nComplimentary bread basket - 1 biscuit and 1 cinnamon muffin each. This came with an adorable plate of raspberry jam, peach jam, and butter. The biscuits were soft and buttery and tasted sooo good with (even more) butter and jam. The muffins I found to be a bit too sweet, and I think they had fennel seeds? The seeds made them unique, but I would prefer them without. \\n\\nEggs Slum Mulligan - I loved the crispy, salty pieces of bacon scattered through the dish. You can't go wrong with a hash of potatoes, onions, and bell peppers either. My only gripe with the dish would be the eggs. The poached eggs were wonderfully oozy, but lacked salt. A sprinkle of salt on them would have made a world of difference. \\n\\nMy friend enjoyed her Eggs Virginia Highland, although she was surprised by the size of the foccacia that came with it. The french toast she said was tasty, but nothing special. \\n\\nService was great and friendly. My coffee mug never stayed empty for long! But now, I must go back to the \\"complimentary\\" valet parking here. I understand that people are expected to tip valet drivers and that those who don't are douchebags. So after our meal, my friend and I came out and the valet pulled my car around. He opened the door for me and I thought, \\"Hm, how nice of him.\\" When we sat down, we went through our purses to find some tips for the driver.

It was around brunch during the weekday. Place was completely empty. Not one person. No complaints here. I remember mentioning to my friend how we'd probably get served so fast!

I sampled my husband's stuffed pepper and his steak entree. The Beet tart was a lot like eating straight beet. Not a lot of other flavor. The pork was dry and rather bland. The steak was kind of tough and also lacking in flavor. What was great was the coconut cake. Incredibly light and delicous. Really unique."},{"name":"Little Bird Bistro","address":"215 SW 6th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"If you're looking for affordable French small snacks in a girly trendy environment then here's your place. \\n\\n\\nFood: we ordered oysters, roasted bone marrow and macaroni grits\\n\\n\\nOysters were fresh. They are either immediately shucked, or there's just water that went in. I honestly couldn't tell the difference betweeh the blue one and the bigger one of oysters so this part might be very unhelpful. All I can say is that they taste fresh and I didn't want to spit it out and the price is a bit high if you're used to happy hour $1 each oyster. \\n\\n\\nDONT GET THE MAC \\n\\nNot worth every penny. The pasta dish quickly cooled off and there wasn't any crunch to the charred cheese. The grits on top of the dish was a bit out of place because it wasn't crunchy or tasty. Just kind of tasted like random seeds on top. For all the dishes being so French and unique, perhaps this bistro should have added say truffle or foie gras to up the stakes a bit. We didn't even finish this dish and left. \\n\\n\\nGet the bone marrow but expect it to be small. The bone marrow was very fresh, because let's face it who wants to eat some disease looking darn bone marrow? The buttery taste was roasted perfectly, melts right down to your bread. It's topped with cilantro, orange pieces, octopus, and thick baked garlic chips (which the restaurant calls it elephant chips for some reason) the bread is a bit thick in my opinion, so it's not a good balance between the bread and bone marrow. There should be more bone marrow paired with that thick of a bread. The concoction of sweet, savory, and freshness tastes really good. I give bone marrow  stars. \\n\\n\\nDecor: the walls are painted with French teal that reminds me of some little cafe in France (note I've never been so don't believe anything I say about French authenticity) their ambiance is much faborable to me than Le Pigeon. The plants, paintings, and color scheme are more Anthropologie but not too much. French style to me is very subtle and well paired. \\n\\nService: Little Bird Bistro and Le Pigeon do not charge for tax and tip, so don't try to tip, you'll look like an idiot. At the same time, their prices are bit on the high side, especially for the portions.

We tried two crostini, including the tartare. Flavor was fine, but the crostini were so salty and 'crunchy' that they hurt to eat. It was overall not an enjoyable experience. Why even put huge chunks of salt on bread?....\\n\\nWe also got a nice fresh salad, which was also too salty! Why go overboard to salt salad?! If you've got fresh ingredients, let them do their own work!! No need to dump a gallon of sea salt crystals in there to look cool or something?! \\n\\nBy this point, I was pretty scared about the entree being too salty. And my fears were founded. I had to ask for extra bread to make the dish edible tasting. And before I asked for that extra bread, I had to ask that they please not put salt on the bread like they did with the starter bread (and here I literally mean the bread at the table...not the crostini. Yes, even the basic bread had been salted again).\\n\\nThe ragu sauce without the salty layer might have been nicely flavored, I have no idea. Because all I tasted were huge chunks of salt. As some perspective on what I mean when I say it was \\"too salty\\", take the classics you eat when you visit your typical small joint in Rome, think about how salty (yet still in a homely delicious way) that cacio e pepe is, and then increase the salt factor by two and you'll have Bar Mezzana. It really bordered on inedible.\\n\\nOn top of that, neither of the pasta were al dente - both were clearly overcooked. And...some of the pasta strands were stuck together. I think it should be one of the basics of a nice Italian place to boil pasta correctly...no? \\n\\nAll in all, the food was so underwhelming that we were shocked. To be fair, the service was fine and the menu seems nicely crafted, and the decor/structure of the restaurant is very beautiful. But holy smokes, the execution on food sucked SO MUCH that I am having a really hard time understanding where all these 5 star reviews are coming from. Are people being taken in by the fancy menu, nice plating, and romantic mood lighting? What is happening here, seriously, to warrant these reviews?? I've never been as confused. At some point, mid bite of pasta, my partner and I just stared at each other, like, really? and I will admit we thought some uncharitable thoughts about the rest of our great Yelp community....\\"have these people ever gone to a real Italian place with good execution.....or maybe their definition of Italian so far is like Olive Garden so they're already blown away by the word crudo?.......\\"\\n\\nWe didn't go right when it opened, so I doubt it was because of 'new opening' jitters. We went on a Friday night, which should be a good and busy night. Even if the heavy handed-ness on the salt was a fluke of the night, how to explain overcooked and stuck pasta? For me, it's not even possible to be a legit or high-end Italian place if you can not consistently boil pasta the right way every. single. night! \\n\\nSo yea, I'm flabbergasted.

The amuse bouche was like a dry meringue with a dab of Worcestershire sauce in it. The pasta was fine, just a little more al dente than I'd like. And the chicken came pressed into an oily disk. Also, I think the meal was prix fixe. Bondir used to have half portions, which was lovely, and while I believe there was a prix fixe option, it was an option. You could still make your own choices.

Very impressed at how popular it was.\\n\\nFood notes: I got the money ball (veggie) which is biscuits & gravy (mushroom) and one egg. I would give it a 4/5. Wish the biscuit was fluffier (was expecting it to be). Boyfriend loved the regular money ball and had two eggs. We also shared the hash ups (hash browns, mushrooms, onions, cheese).

But the length of the wait was somewhat lessened by the self-serve coffee and water stations, and the garlicky aroma wafting from the restaurant. \\n\\nWe were delighted to hear our name called after about 30 to 40 minutes, but were a little taken back when we saw that our table for 2 was literally by itself in the hallway heading to the restrooms. We tried not to let that discourage us considering that we had just spent so much time waiting and the reviews were stellar....we were sure that the food would make up for it!\\n\\nOur first server was rather unfriendly and borderline rude. We asked about a couple of drinks and although she answered, she walked away immediately without giving us the opportunity to even order any. Hmmm...okay. The next server that came to our table to take our order was MUCH more pleasant. He was dry, but witty and amusing...he could have walked off (or on!) to an episode of Portlandia!\\n\\nOur food came out pretty quickly, but it wasn't anything I would rave about. I ordered Brian's Hash-- it was a simple hash made with pork sausage, onions, peppers and mushrooms, topped with 2 eggs and a side of sourdough toast (which was hardly toasted, but still tasty especially with their house-made jam), and my friend had a scramble and a half order of their French Toast...all of which was mediocre. And then we had to get up and ask for the check.\\n\\nNeedless to say- my friend and I were both a little disappointed. I felt like we were in an entirely different restaurant than the other yelpers who posted reviews. I understand that brunch has totally become a thing that Portlanders love to do...I mean, it's a foodie city for sure. And we don't even mind the ungodly waits!! Unfortunately many Portland restaurants have lost their flare and lack the customer service that made us fall in love with the food culture here in the first place.

Just be prepared for a long wait on weekends and parking can be a little tough. \\n\\n(8/10) Loaded Baked Potato Omelette\\nThis item is listed under \\"Today's Specials\\" and is not on the menu.  It consists of 3 eggs, cheese, baked potato pieces, small strips of bacon and is topped with sour cream and scallions.  The omelette is pretty good but a little bland.  It needs either ketchup, salsa or some kind of sauce/dip. We chose hollandaise sauce and it helped bring out the flavors. The omelette comes with 2 side dishes, but we substituted with a short stack of gingerbread pancakes instead!\\n\\n(7/10) Gingerbread Pancakes\\nThe short stack comes with 2 giant pancakes.  The pancakes are somewhat fluffy and had the right amount of gingerbread flavor.  It is basically the pancake version of a soft gingerbread cookie.\\n\\n(5/10) Mango Pancakes\\nThis item is also listed under \\"Today's Specials\\" and sounded fabulous! Mango with anything is usually a hit, but we were disappointed in these pancakes.  They are somewhat fluffy as well, but the flavor not so pleasing!  The bites that had mango pulp were ok, but the other bites tasted banana-ish and dry.  We'd pass on these.\\n\\n(8/10) Veggie Taco\\nThis taco has avocado, black beans, cheddar and jack cheese, tomato, sprouts, sour cream and hummus inside a flour tortilla.  This hummus was an added option, but we think it is a bit on the runny side.  The sprouts are good and tasted fresh.  Perhaps its better to get this dish without adding the hummus.\\n\\n(6/10) BBQ Chicken Enchiladas\\nThese unique enchiladas are filled with grilled chicken breast, pico de gallo, and BBQ sauce and topped with queso and chipotle.  It is stuffed generously with spicy chicken.  Some might find the BBQ flavor of the chicken and the Mexican spices a little conflicting.  The ends of the enchiladas are a bit chewy and hard, and this dish is drier than traditional enchiladas and could use more queso.\\n\\nService (5/10)\\nOur waitress was scatterbrained...we had to ask for things several times!  She was pleasant, just forgetful.  Service seemed rather slow.  To her credit, we did have a large group and Magnolia's was packed because it was Saturday afternoon.  But still, orders came out slightly wrong.  We didn't mind too much because we were starving from waiting an hour to be seated!  Another inconvenience to be aware of is that Magnolia's doesn't split checks more than 4 ways for larger groups.\\n\\nAmbiance (7/10)\\nMagnolia Caf√© is a colorful, funky place that is doing their part to \\"Keep Austin Weird.\\"  This brightly decorated restaurant gives off the typical laidback vibe that Austin is famous for.  There is seating inside and a covered outdoor patio as well.  There is only one restroom each for men and women so don't drink too much!

It's about a  3.5 star place for me. \\n\\nFirst of all, I loved our server. She was on top of things. She was friendly, hustled, and did a fine job. I liked my server so much, my cheap self actually gave her extra tip even though tip was included in our meal. \\n\\nSo let's talk about the food. Some worked, some didn't. We tried half the menu, so I have a good idea what their food tasted like. \\n\\nCreole Turnovers - This reminded me of Jamaican meat pies. It was creole stuff inside a puff pastry. I liked it. The filling had good flavor and decent amount of seafood-y protein. The pastry tasted good too. \\n\\nOysters Rockefeller - The oysters were nice, fresh, and juicy. It had great flavor from the Parmesan cream sauce. \\n\\nPickled Mussels - Another good dish. The mussels comes in a jar of pickle sauce. You have to fish for the mussels in the jar. The pickling did make the mussels taste good. Who knew pickled mussels tasted good? It had a nice and refreshing flavor. \\n\\nChicken and Waffles - It was decent. Chicken seemed a bit dry. The waffles? I don't really remember them. The collared greens around it was a decent touch. \\n\\nTuscan Kale Salad - It's a salad. \\n\\nRoasted Bone Marrow - This dish is for 1 person, 2 max. There is not much bone marrow to scoop out. But once you do, it's not bad. If you like bone marrow, make sure to order enough for everyone. \\n\\nPickled Beets - I liked this dish. The dish was simple, but the flavor was great. I love beets. You can't mess up beets anything for me. \\n\\nButternut Squash - I don't remember this dish much. So it was probably boring. I think it was just raw butternut squash. \\n\\nBeef Carpaccio - Nothing exciting, just raw meat. The horseradish aioli didn't add much. \\n\\nChicken Skins - One of my favorites from the menu. The skins had a nice, crispy texture. It tasted delicious. \\n\\nAhi Tuna - Pretty good. I loved the avocado and the crunchy corn tostada. The tuna seemed fresh and good. \\n\\nDuck Rillettes - this wasn't bad. The flavor seemed mild.  I wasn't sure what part of the duck the rillettes were made from. But I would've preferred a more traditional pate. \\n\\nPei Mussels - I think Pei means \\"puny\\". These were some tiny mussels. Luckily, they gave us a ton of mussels. The sauce it came in, the fennel tomato one, was pretty good. Make sure to have all the layers with the bread to make it taste good.\\n\\nLabelle Farms Duck Breast - Not a fan. The duck was dry. Also, the flavor seemed lacking. I also wasn't a fan of the farro-risotto like thingy on the bottom. The dish seemed like it had more farro than duck. \\n\\nGeorges Bank Scallops - I liked the Lentil Salad it came on top of, especially the Chorizo. The scallops themselves were seared well. \\n\\nButcher Block Charcuterie plate - not bad. On the menu, it had Chow Chow on it. No, this isn't Korea, and it wasn't the dog they were serving. Although, since I'm Korean, that would've been awesome. Nope, no dog. It was just pickled, yellow, vegetable stuff. \\n\\nThe plate had some good stuff on it like the chow chow and the cured meats. The beef jerky  was tough and hard to chew. The jerky needed a bit more flavor to it as well. The andouille sausage wasn't bad. The cured meat wasn't bad. I mean, it was your good, old-fashioned, charcuterie plate. It wasn't the best I had, but not the worst. \\n\\nArtisan Cheese Board - the cheese tasted good. The goat cheese was nice and creamy. If you love cheese, this is good plate to get. \\n\\nThey were nice enough to give us free dessert because all the food didn't come out at the same time. Once again, this is an example of the their excellent costumer service. The desserts tasted fine. I mean, they're desserts at a restaurants. Most of the time, restaurant desserts taste like Kroger brand pies and ice cream to me. I can't fault them since it takes something special for me to like desserts at an restaurant. \\n\\nThe drinks tasted decent. I'm not a big drinker, but try their alcoholic lemonade. I can't remember what it was called, but it tasted good. \\n\\nThe food was about 3.5 stars. They were above average but not spectacular. Some were forgettable. Their service bumps them up to 4 stars. I think for a restaurant at this price point, they need to work on being more daring and creative in their dishes and/or making sure the dishes are prepared with more scrutiny and perfection."},{"name":"Tibby's New Orleans Kitchen","address":"2203 Aloma Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4.5","text":"My first experience at Tibby's was excellent.  We were seated immediately, but I can see constant wait times becoming an issue as soon as more people discover this place.\\n\\nThe decor is interesting, with tons of colorful and seemingly authentic artifacts from New Orleans.  Aside from the items on the walls, the art direction is incredible.  Rumor has it that Tibby's is founded by the same folks who brought Tijuana Flats to Orlando and, later, the world.  It also appears they have the same artist/designer from Tijuana Flats on hand.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is... jubilant.  (edit: I swear I didn't subconsciously appropriate reviewer Drew's adjective.  I challenge you to go to Tibby's and try to think of any other word to describe the mood.)  I have no idea why, but there's a rolling thunder of noise.  There were only two parties while I was there, but I think the high ceilings create a gymnasium effect.  The noise is off-putting at first but it's not bad enough that you can't hear anyone at your own table.\\n\\nThe appetizers are interesting.  I ordered fried eggplant sticks and they were perfect-- slightly undercooked as a 'stick' should be, with a great dipping marinara. \\n\\nI wanted to try a real entree but only ordered a sandwich, because THEY HAVE MUFFALETTAS!  It's dang near impossible to find muffalettas now that Crooked Bayou is dead.  The sandwich came to the table looking amateurish.  The olive salad was chunkier than I've seen elsewhere and the whole thing looked too clean.  But the bread was perfectly soft and oily and the meat was 100 percent lean.  This turned out to be one of the best muffalettas I've ever consumed, and I'm sure it would even make Chef Paul Prudhomme proud.  \\"Half\\" of a muffaletta was still huge, and I brought half of the half home.\\n\\nMy girlfriend had shrimp creole and she was happy with the portion and taste.  She said it was perfect, but I wouldn't expect anyone to mess up this kind of simple dish.\\n\\nBeignets were a fun dessert.  Very doughy on the inside, not too flaky on the outside.\\n\\nWonderful service.  They overstaff and our waiter only worked two or three tables.  He was personable without being creepy.\\n\\nMy sandwich plus girlfriend's entree plus appetizer plus order of three beignets = $29 before tip.  Very affordable.\\n\\nThese people know how to create a concept, and with Tibby's they did an awesome job graduating from counter service to full service.

Not only because of their location (they're tucked around a small street off Robson), but because of their hours (they close earlier than the competition).\\n\\nParking here is rather awful.  Cross your fingers on the side streets.\\n\\nSeating here is a bit limited.  There is a giant long table in the middle, as well as bar seating.  The place fills up quickly, so again, luck is needed.\\n\\nStaff were friendly and quick.  We were all chowing down in no time.\\n\\nThe chicken and clam ramen is something special.  It's a bit more expensive than the competition at $12, but it's totally worth it.  Basically it's ramen with seafood broth with a couple of slices of chashu (pork) mixed in.  It was so delicious I can still taste it.  This dish alone makes it worth the trip out, as I have not seen it anywhere else.  My only complaint is that the ramen bowls here seem smaller than the competition, and it really doesn't help that they don't fill up the bowls either.

I choose one of her favorites and ended up liking it. We each had a beer and then drank water afterward. I'd have to say that the only downfall about our dinner was when the check came. Our total was $85. I, like all others, enjoy a good meal, but for two entrees and two beers, I'd have to say that I felt our dining experience was a bit over priced. \\n\\nThey also have a wine store within the restaurant and I have been there on several occasions to purchase gifts for friends and have been helped graciously by their wonderful staff.

I ordered the prime rib with a glass of red wine and my boyfriend ordered the steak with Mac and cheese. Our server didn't visit the table again after the order was taken, until my boyfriend stopped him to remind him I ordered a glass of wine. It finally arrived as an 8 ounce pour 45 minutes after ordering.  Then, we didn't see him until we asked for the check, someone else refilled our waters then we waited for someone to clear the table to have a random server ask if we wanted boxes and she returned with them. The server dropped the check and didn't have my wine listed, we figured he put it on the house with a double pour considering he didn't deliver it until 45 minutes later after being reminded. He returned with our card and said \\"I apologize I forgot to charge you for your wine so another amount is listed than the amount I picked your card up with.\\"\\n\\nYou forgot to charge it because you forgot to ring it in and deliver. I'm all about paying for what I consume, I was a server in the past, it just seemed like he was covering his mistake.\\n\\nBottom line: atmosphere was great, hostess was great, food was okay, service was subpar for something we paid $100 for, we could've had better service with better food."},{"name":"El Guajillo","address":"12725 SW Pacific Hwy","city":"Tigard","stars":"3.5","text":"This is my favorite Mexican place I've been to in a very long time.

Its typical decor for restaurant with carved back booths, bright colors, etc. Very clean. This is not a dive. We both had the traditional margarita, he got his blended, I didn't. Delicious, strong, mixed well. You get attentive but laid back service every time I come here. Warm chips right away. Their house salsa is medium spicy, which is my kinda flavor. Pork carnitas. This is the top dog here for me. Amazing. Juicy tasty marinade, presented in a molcajete at the table. Beautiful goodness. He had tacos all pastor, which was also delicious, fresh pineapple and cilantro yes!. I've now taken my dad there and he was totally impressed, and thanked the husband and wife several times, so cute haha. He loved his enchiladas! I like that they separate your beans and rice (with choice of beans), I like black beans myself, but the key is it isn't a swimming pool of lard grease cheese on your plate. It stays fresh, and the rice is flavored nicely. You taste more, enjoy more. Yum yum yum. Now on to trying more seafood! Camarones al Diablo? Yes.

I've especially enjoyed taking friends there during \\"happy hour\\" to enjoy the generous half-price menu. So there was a small disappointment on a visit a few weeks ago when I took a friend only to discover the \\"happy hour\\" menu had been downgraded to a very limited number of uninspired items.  Oh well.  Understandable perhaps in this difficult economic market, but still regrettable. We'll cut down our visits, cutting out happy hour altogether.\\n\\nHowever, yesterday's visit  for an evening meal had a bigger disappointment for me.  I ordered my favourite \\"standard\\" quick meal: the insalata mista, pasta puttanesca to be followed by their truly delicious cannoli. The insalata was a different mix, with somewhat leathery strips of carrot (perhaps done with a peeler rather than a spiralizer?)  but no harm done... still tasty with the lovely honey mustard dressing... and the same generous portion.  However, the pasta puttanesca was very disappointing; it was still tasty, but made with tomato paste, not the lovely fresh tomatoes I've always enjoyed previously, so instead of the clear fragrant oil that usually coats the pasta there was unpleasant coating of pink canned paste.  While somewhat heavy on the capers it did have a very pleasing balance of anchovy tang and pepper bite. Despite the disappointment of the changed puttanesca (which means, again, I'll be going less to IK) the meal ended well... the cannoli were, as always, splendid. \\n\\nI will return, not as often, and with some trepidation at further downgrading of this restaurant which has, up to now, been a reliable mid-range regular."},{"name":"Portland City Grill","address":"111 SW 5th Ave, Fl 30","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I wish that I could leave more then 5 stars , for the simple fact that they played \\" someone to love\\" by Jon B....

Jake's set up is a basic 2 chest chiller housing a wide variety of flavors. I sampled a few to discuss prior to placing my order.\\n\\nThere is a whole lot of dairy free and sorbets on one side. I didn't try any of those. I stuck with the lot of regular dairy tasties. Red velvet (red cake in impossibly white ice cream) is pretty darn heavenly.

I paired it up with some double threat chocolate. The salted caramel is something I've had at restaurant paired with a dessert but this was my own special cup with nothing soiling the pure enjoyment of this very special flavor. \\n\\nJake's isn't the full fat almost airless super premium you buy at the grocery store. It feels to me more akin to ice cream you'd make at home.

See the picture below for reference. The restaurant was very busy and pretty loud on Saturday night, so having a secluded seating area definitely helped. \\n\\nSecond, the food was excellent the entire time! We had the Crudo tasting, which allowed us to tried 6 different crudos at a time. One Crudo comes with 2 small slices of meat, so I'd recommend getting at least 3 Crudo tasting orders for 5-8 people to share. We absolutely enjoyed the Spanish Lubina (garlic, yum!) and the Shima Aji crudos (caviar, anyone?) \\n\\nOn top of that, I'd also recommend the prosciutto with a mozzarella! Well prepared, well spiced, absolutely happy with it. The beef tartare was amazing, so was the duck heart with pancetta skewer. Both were definitely recommended antipasti. For pasta, I'd suggest getting the orecchiette (with sausage, fennel, radicchio) as well as the tagliolini (with sweetbreads, peas, and mint).

Very cool, casual without being stuffy.  Great background music.  Very cozy and chic.  I'm in love!\\n\\n\\nThere is only one reason to downgrade this to 5 star- it would be because I don't like the panna cotta dessert....but I'm not a fan of panna cotta anyways, so I can't blame Murphy's for that. \\n\\nMy bad for not writing a review the 1st time I went- life got in the way. \\n\\nFirst Dining Experience: \\nAppetizer: \\nI had two glasses of prosecco. (Bubblicious and yummy!) \\nMussels in a light white wine sauce. Awesome and soooooooooooooo fresh. My friend had the crab cakes with some type of beer that he absolutely raved about. \\n\\nMain Course: \\nI had the salmon which came with fresh peas and carrots; and sauteed pearl onions. My friend had the flounder. THEY WERE AMAZING!!!! I know the herbed salmon is sauteed in the flavored butter, but it's worth every single calorie and gym workout afterwards. The peas were so fresh that they had a snap to them. The onions had a wonderful seasoned flavor. \\nHis flounder was grilled to perfection and seasoned divinely. \\n\\nFor dessert: \\nWe had the key lime coconut cream pie and the bonzo. The pie was light, not too sweet, not to tart. The bonzo is a layer of choco mousse, choco cake, and plain cheesecake. Very rich and decadent. \\n\\n\\n\\nSecond Dining Experience: \\nDrinks: \\nTwo glasses of Pinot Grigio. Delicious. \\nMy date: Amaretto sour (he's not much of a drinker) \\n\\nAppetizer: \\nI got the spinach salad and I was pleasantly surprised when the goat cheese was a fried ball of cheesy happiness. Wonderful! The salad was kinda big, so I didn't eat all of it. \\nMy date ordered the chicken and hominy soup. It was very hearty...the chicken was shredded which was super yummy and tender. The soup reminded me of the one my mom makes. Yummy. \\n\\nMain Course: \\nI had to go back to the salmon to relive the experience. Nuff said. \\nMy date ordered the sausage meatloaf. It was AWESOME (and I don't even like Italian sausage). Moist and covered with a tomato based sauce. Came with mashed potatoes and greens. He also ordered a side of the truffle mac & cheese. It was soooooo cheesy and wonderful and creamy. I didn't really taste any truffles in it, which was a good thing since both of us hate mushrooms! We killed the mac & cheese!!!!! LOL \\n\\nDessert: \\nThe dessert trio. Okay the Tollhouse Pie is the star on this plate. Warm, gooey, and chock full of walnuts. The second in line is the bonzo. Third (which we barely touched) was the panna cotta. It is fresh, with lots of fruit and mangoes on the plate- but definitely does NOT compliment the chocolaty rich bonzo and tollhouse desserts in which it shares a plate with. That pairing was a bit weird. \\n\\nLove love love the $1 cookies on the go.

The taco itself had lots of stuff in it so it was filling, and at $3 it wasn't a horrible deal. The fish itself was cooked to done but tasted like nothing. I poured the salsa it came with over it thinking it was just a standard green sauce but it was fiery hot, like the suns of many jalapenos. It overpowered the rest of the taco (and I actually like spicy food) and I spent the rest of my meal chugging water. Again, I just assumed it would be a normal to mildly spicy salsa because that's what it usually is. Luckily for me, the taco tasted like nothing to begin with, so I don't think I missed out on much.\\n\\nThe service was good and quick, we ordered 3-4 for a few people and they came out within 10 minutes.\\n\\nI came in with high expectations for this meal and my poor soggy taco got crushed under them.

In addition, management handled the situation in an unprofessional and incorrect manner. Not only was my $42 steak frites overcooked, they had the nerve to tell me that medium rare with a char was not something they could guarantee. REALLY?? Then you shouldn't have a $42 steak on your menu!!\\n\\nIn all fairness, they offered to bring me something else. However, I didn't want anything else. I was set on having a nice steak. You can imagine my irritation when the manager brought over my original steak after REHEATING it. WOW!! That's just offensive!! You reheated an already overcooked $42 steak and thought that was going to be OK??? Shaking my head...  It's worth noting that 2 other people in our party ordered the steak as well - and they were also overcooked. These guys need to take the item off their menu because clearly they are having execution issues.\\n\\nI explained to the manager that I wanted a new steak, properly executed. She obliged (after insulting me with the reheated one, and not really wanting to bring me a new/properly cooked steak) and they finally got it right. Now, if only the rest of my party already wasn't done eating 20 minutes ago. Sigh...\\n\\nGet it together Oak Bar!! I expect so much better from you!!

I grew a taste for Carolina style in my years living in TN and GA.  Texas style was a nice change of pace, and midwest (St. Louis / KC) was a little more difficult to find and good for the bbq craving.  Going farther west from Carolina (before you crossed the MS) tended to put more focus on the sauces and offered the choice of vinegar based, that you would find in Carolina style, and tomato based from farther west, where they take pride in their sauces. \\n\\nNow that I live in Boston, I sought out Red Bones.  The food was great.  However, they seem to have an identity crisis, because they serve every kind of bbq.  Maybe they are trying to satisfy every type of customer that comes through the door, regardless of where they are from?  \\n\\nI am used to bbq places that serve a limited menu, and focus on their specialty.  How a bbq place can specialize in everything seems to be a challenge.  Red Bones has every kind of food from every region, including the Gulf with the catfish and sausage.  You can truly take a tour of the south with the Red Bones menu.  To make it easy for the general public, Red Bones even explains the region of the style for most of the menu items.  Because good bbq meat takes so long to smoke, they would need a huge smoker, probably have a lot of waste because of their wide selection, or they save the leftovers for the next day.  They don't even have a dish like Brunswick Stew where they would be able to throw the leftovers from the day before, so who knows what they do with them.\\n\\nSo, was it good?  Yeah, it was good.  I had the pulled pork.  The meat was surprisingly good - tender and well seasoned.  The worst thing you can do to a nice pile of pulled pork is to drench it in sauce, and fortunately Red Bones didn't do that.  But they do offer several different sauces, but I found that they just covered up the taste of the meat, and didn't offer anything spectacular.  I would go back to try other items, but would probably focus on the region of the south with the best bbq - Carolina."},{"name":"Halal Bros","address":"2712 Guadalupe St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I like the Lamb over rice.

Huge green salad using VERY fresh green leaf lettuce (never iceberg), piled on top of black beans in a tortilla bowl that's fried so I try not to eat it, but it's really yummy. All topped with freshly-made salsa fresca, guacamole and shredded jack cheese. I then usually have them top it with grilled chicken, and the whole thing only costs about $6.50 which is incredibly cheap considering that I can never finish it.\\n\\nI also love the tacos pescado. Lightly-fried whitefish, wrapped in soft white corn tortillas, topped with shredded cabbage and chipotle mayo sauce. Scrumptious!!!\\n\\nAnother favorite is the chicken and potato burrito, which is a bit heavier, but it's full of grilled veggies, potatoes, grilled chicken, and the same chipotle mayo sauce.\\n\\nAbout the Sweet Tequila burritos: Some people seem to love them and others hate them. My partner loves them, especially with shrimp or tofu, but my son hates them. Some people like the sweet barbecue sauce in a burrito, others don't. I'm not crazy about it personally.\\n\\nI also have to put in a word for the chicken dinners they serve here. For some insanely low price (about $11.00) they'll send you home with enough grilled chicken, rice and beans, and warm tortillas, to absolutely stuff a family of 4 or more. I got it once, and they were out of whole chickens, so they just started piling the chopped grilled chicken that they serve in the burritos and such into a container. They sent me home with so much chicken that my family of 3 ate it for 3 days straight, and I had to send some home with a friend.

A brown rice bowl with black beans, chicken, pico de gallo, cheese, and sour cream. Honestly, there was nothing wrong with the food, except for it tasting almost exactly like Chipotle.  I was disappointed, because I was actually hoping it would taste different, that they would have made a niche for themselves by differentiating their dish from Chipotle's somehow. The only difference I saw was in the type of cheese they used. The cost was a little bit less than you'd find at Chipotle, but the portion size was also.\\n\\nI suppose in this area of town, a lot of people love having a 7/8th's Chipotle in an area where a Chipotle isn't.

My husband was nice enough to let me eye f$@k his steak and when my drool almost hit the table.. he cut out a little piece of his Wagyu steak.. and then.... half of that piece.. and fed it to me.. oh ahh eeee yum.. it does melt in your mouth oohh soo tender and buttery.. it felt like I had put a chunk of butter in my mouth but with meat flavors!  Anywho.. onto my show.. I ordered the apple smoked pork shop.. the portion wAs huge!! I was kind of getting full from the salad, break with butter and drinks but the pork chop was sooo tasty I had to finish the edges of it at least! Hahaha soo yes I ate around the edges where it was soo flavorful and was crispy with slight char. It was super delicious.. now if I had to rate the Wagyu steak.. it would be a 10 out of 10. The pork chop would come at a close 8 out of 10. The sides that it came with was good as well.  Richard also brought out a complimentary chocolate truffle cake for our celebration. It was good as well.\\n\\nBetween the exceptional service we received from when we entered to when we left, the oh so delicious, can't remembered the last we had such a wonderful meal, and of course the beautiful view 30 floors up, it was one of my best meal experiences in my book.. but then again maybe it was us celebrating our 10 years and it was a bit sentimental or this dinner just added that final touch to make our 10 year celebration that much more special. It was our first decade celebration to preview the many more to come and I now am at ease that I can make it through to celebrate many more decades.. maybe we'll start a tradition and celebrate every decade at Portland Grill!"},{"name":"Flour Bakery + Caf√©","address":"131 Clarendon St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"always been a fan of Flour, just not a fan of their lines and location selection, what with the lack/craziness of parking nearby. this joint is no different, except that it's within walking distant from work, so my patronage isn't deterred by the aforementioned factors. and somehow the 8am line wasn't as crazy as after we sat down.\\n\\ncounter-service was on par, barista was ok with me using my own cup for the coffee i ordered, and they even gave me a couple oz extra!  might just be a happy accident, but i'm glad people are not nickle-and-diming patrons especially from a successful business.\\n\\nthe breakfast selections somehow wasn't as enticing as their lunch or pastries varieties. picked the French toast and not remembering being excited when it arrived. something about the bread selection that threw me off - can't remember which kind for sure but  it was the type one'd see on a sandwich menu, and my memory tells me that i was half regretting ordering it once i had a bite. though the flavor was there, the bread was a bit...unexpected.\\n\\ndecor was nice. but if one would feel left to fend for herself in terms of where cutlery and napkins were. they also had the silverware for eat-in and plastic for to-go, which, again, a newbie wouldn't have known if not aware.\\n\\notherwise, a great experience. would repeat in time to come."},{"name":"Luke's Lobster Back Bay","address":"75 Exeter Street","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"The lobster roll was fairly good, although I'd rather have the lobster hot in this good weather.

It seems as though few places in Portland have the mettle to be so - heck, even the Fred Meyer's down the way closes at 11, which to me is just bizarre. The lack of 24 hour eateries up in this neck of the woods is strange - basically, once the bars close, your choices are Heavenly Donuts or this place. After a waterfall of beer, greasy Mexican usually is preferred over donuts. Or at least, that's just me.\\n\\nIt somewhat worries me that the location of Javier's is considered \\"the ghetto\\" by some reviewers. This place is not a ghetto, friends. It really isn't. Yes, the police show up occasionally, but keep in mind that this is the only 24 hour restaurant in the area, barring donuts. All the post-bar crowd is going to come here, and some are going to be a little too-well lubricated and rowdy. It's not a reflection on the area.\\n\\nAt any rate, the food is good for what it is. You can get an enormous burrito for five bucks here, and no matter what variety you pick that sucker will fill you up. This is NOT a foodie establishment - the ingredients are pretty cheap overall, and if you're a vegetarian I don't know what to tell you. (I think they have gazpacho?) Portions here are enormous, and the food overall is pretty greasy. But not greasy in a bad way, or at least I've never had a bad reaction to it.\\n\\nOverall, this is a super cheap place to eat, pretty much the restaurant equal to a food cart. But I enjoy the food for what it is, greasy and filling. The free carrot and pepper salad is also good, and you should ask for both the green and the red salsa to use on whatever you buy.  If you're starting out, the carne asada is a good choice, but I've also had the \\"combination\\" burrito (beef, chicken, cheese) and a few other varieties.

If you hadn't booked a reservation for one of the main restaurants on Park Avenue, I wouldn't be surprised if the wait time was over 30 minutes. After seeing The Bistro a few times, tucked away in one of the courtyards next to the olive oil shop, we decided to give it a test run.\\n\\nSeating was immediate, which could have been a good OR a bad thing. Good for us since it's not directly on Park Ave., so it's a little hard to find and doesn't have the constant traffic of people. But possibly bad since I have seen some poor reviews about the place. Our hostess led us to the \\"outdoor room\\", which was a room with a skylight ceiling, opened backdoor, brick walls, and lots of windows that felt like you were sitting outside without dealing with the heat. \\n\\nOur waitress was very nice and was very informative about the menu. She suggest the traditional reuben sandwich for him while I got the shrimp louie salad. I've never had a wet salad before, but it was definitely delicious. The shrimp salad was creamy, a little fishy but had a kick of flavor, and didn't need any additional dressing for the lettuce. As for the reuben, the man said it was probably one of the best he's had in a very long time (especially since St. Patty's Day was about a week or so ago and he was still craving corned beef). \\n\\nI gave The Bistro four stars because there's still a few kinks they need to work out about directing their customers to the hostess. We sat next to the back door, which was opened to the additional outdoor seating area, and we must have seen about five groups walk in and looked confused on the seating process (self seating, hostess nearby, etc.). Even though I saw plenty of signs, maybe an additional sign next to the back door would help with the confusion (if there was a sign already there, I apologize). At one point I almost felt a little obligated to direct them in the right direction while I saw other waitresses walk pass them without asking if they needed assistance. It could be one of the reasons why they don't seat as many customers as they would like.  \\n\\nI also thought their food might be a little pricy considering what you're getting. Some menu items I avoided because of the price ($20 for a lobster benedict??). Their cheapest appetizer was $11, and it was just hummus. I think we paid $30 before the tip for the both of us and our only drinks was water. \\n\\nOverall, it's a cute place to go that isn't too crowded and has a great atmosphere.

The pizza is big and is easily 2-3 meals. \\n\\nMy friends ordered a custom pizza with half cheese and half no cheese (one has a dairy allergy) and they were disappointed when it came with half cheese and half diaya cheese. They at first thought they had gotten someone else's pizza incorrectly, and when they asked about it the server said they would remake it no problem, but it would still take about 15 more minutes, which was a bit awkward because the other two pizzas had already arrived. She then came back again to apologize for the mistake.\\n\\nWhen the bill came, they didn't charge them for anything, which was very thoughtful!\\n\\nI'd definitely come back!\\n\\nNote: the bathrooms are kind of awkward. They are shared with the cafe next door and although it seems like you push open into a larger area with multiple stalls, they are actually 4 single use bathrooms (2 marked female, 2 marked male). Awkward waiting in hallway encounters are inevitable...\\n\\nEDITED: I changed my review from 5 to 4 stars after eating a day's worth of leftovers. The saucer cheese, which was milky in a good way the day of, became kind of sickeningly milky the next day. I would add another type of cheese to the saucer cheese or substitute it altogether next time. However, the crust held up wonderfully!"},{"name":"Lodge at Cascade Brewing","address":"7424 SW Beaverton Hillsdale Hwy","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Not the greatest atmosphere.

Our server was Eric, who was very friendly and knowledgeable.  He recommended a lovely white wine to start.  As it was our anniversary, we brought a special bottle of red wine with us, and they waived the cork fee because we purchased a bottle there.  \\n\\nTHE FOOD:  We ordered the marrow bones and foie gras to start. -WOW!!!  We will be talking about both those dishes for years.  The marrow bones were served with a chewy black bread and chorizo which added a nice spice.  The prosciutto-wrapped foie was silky and delicious.  We shared a butter lettuce salad which made a nice palate cleanser.  For the main course my husband had the duck.  He didn't care for the way it was prepared, all sweet flavors without anything to balance it out.  Eric noticed he wasn't eating it and when my husband said it just wasn't his thing, he took it away and took it off the bill.  Excellent service.  My dish on the other hand, was amazing!

They have a small selection on there menu but if you eat seafood than you shouldn't have a problem. Although they do have a burger and another sandwich for those that doesn't it seafood at all. And they have a daily special, each day a sandwich or something is on special. They mainly have oysters, shrimp and crab (king, alaskan, stone) on the menu and you can order by the piece and get a few of each thing which is nice. \\n\\nWe odered a variety of oysters (which I didnt eat), stone crab legs (2), shrimp cocktail (1 jumbo shrimp), fish tacos (sunday daily special).   Everything (except the oysters I can speak for since I didn't eat them) was awesome. The fish tacos, although were $23 dollars, comes with two tacos that are PLENTIFULLY filled and were awesome.  The fish is light fried but still has TONS of meat and flavor.  The stone crab was tasty and the shrimp was tasty and not fishy.  From what I'm told by everyone else the oysters were awesome!
