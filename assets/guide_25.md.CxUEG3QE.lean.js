The turnip greens were fresh and tasted wonderful with the pepper vinegar. The creamed corn tasted like it was freshly cut off the cob. It was definitely not canned. The cornbread dressing was well seasoned and went well with the pork chops and gravy. I could not imagine eating dessert. My friend ordered the bread pudding and let me have a taste.

JMueller (now known as LA BBQ) is an unassuming food trailer near South Congress. It's easy to miss if you don't know what you're looking for. We got there around noon and waited in line for about 30 min, during which we were handed more free beer than we knew what to do with.\\n\\nThe five of us ordered a lb of brisket, a lb of pork ribs, one sausage link, and pints of potato salad, coleslaw, and beans. It was more than enough food, and we ended up not being able to finish everything, though not for lack of trying. After you order they cut up the meat in front of you, dump it all on a tray, and direct you to the other side of the trailer to pay and collect your standard onions, peppers, bread, etc.\\n\\nAll of the meat was great, but my favourite was the sausage, which was smoked perfectly. The brisket was thick and tender but a little on the dry side, and the ribs had great flavour but didn't fall off the bone like I expect them too. They actually don't give you a side of BBQ sauce here, just some kind of smokey dipping sauce, so it felt like the meat was somewhat lacking in flavour. Sides were decent, but not great -- I liked the spiciness in the coleslaw, but the potato salad had a little too much kick to it while the beans were bland (I still don't understand why beans in Texas aren't smokey-sweet like they are everywhere else...).\\n\\nOverall this was the best BBQ I had in Austin, but I wish I'd gotten the chance to go to Franklin, because my coworkers said it blew JMueller out of the water."},{"name":"Steak on Fire","address":"7541 Sand Lake Rd, Ste A","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Everything was delicious!

Obviously the behavior we experienced in Two Licks must be acceptable and part of their business culture  given there was no response to my note to the Owner/ Founder and various VP's. If you do still decide to go, I hope your experience is much different:\\n\\nPlease see email written to the company below:\\n\\nHello,\\n\\nMy name is Tanya XXX and I along with 13 guests recently dined at Two Urban Licks.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the dining experience was very disappointing. This was supposed to be a brunch to celebrate  the marriage of our two friends the day before, but instead we were met with incompetence throughout the entire experience. \\n\\nI was at first grateful that the staff was gracious working to find two tables for our party so that we could sit together (we did book two reservations so that you are aware of all facts, however this was not issue as I informed hostess we would wait for either a large table or two close to each other).\\n\\nOnce we were seated, we ordered and the trouble began. Nearly 30 min after putting in orders with Brian, several of our guests were informed the dishes they ordered were not available. We were then brought the wrong menus, and asked to speak to GM or Manager who I believe was Thomas Gullo who was immediately combative instead of trying to fix issue.The server was equally lackadaisical.\\n\\nAfter being given correct menus our orders took over an hour and we were there nearly 2. When we asked for bills they took 10-15 min and the GM offered a 20% discount which was inadequate for the rudeness and lack of care and hospitality we were treated with. Our dishes were luke warm and it just set a negative tone for what was supposed to be a celebratory day. \\n\\nI was surprised and shocked by the level of service we received and will not be visiting any other Concentric group restaurants in Atlanta or elsewhere. Everyone from the waiter up to the GM of the restaurant had a horrible attitude and did little to try to rectify the issues other than bringing out free salmon chips which were of little consolation since we had guests who did not even receive beverages that they asked for and the whole ordeal of getting our meals after nearly two hours. \\n\\nI hope this is not the normal or acceptable way business is conducted at your dining establishments.\\n\\n\\nRespectfully,"},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Okay so maybe Voodoo Doughnuts isn't exactly as good as when they first started, but hey it's still a cool place to visit and experience.

No more than 10 minutes after I sent the email I received a call from Peter, asking if I had a few minutes to talk and put together a truly amazing plan for the night. Not only did Peter accommodate my request by reserving the best table in the house (Table #18), but he went above and beyond by organizing the whole night - which we went over step-by-step during a site visit the day before the proposal.\\n\\nOn the night of the proposal, my fiance and I arrived at the Hub, to which we were greeted by the hostess (whom I met the day before) and she played it off beautifully, acting like she had never met me before. After being escorted to our table, we enjoyed top-notch drinks/wine and complimentary appetizers (shaved scallops with pickled onions, caviar and a spicy sauce) from the GM and chef, which was a surprise even to me. Dinner was perfect, as were the complimentary desserts - again on behalf of the GM and chef. \\n\\nFollowing dinner, I casually walked to the restroom where I gave the hostess my phone to video the proposal. After paying the check, I asked the waiter if we could see the Skywalk to which he told us he'd be happy to bring us down to see it (part of the plan). He took us down the elevator to the 50th floor, where we exited and walked to the windows. On cue, the violinist I hired played \\"All of Me\\" and after she finished I got down on one knee to pop the question. After she said yes, another manager brought out complimentary champagne. It was an absolutely perfect night.\\n\\nWhether you're proposing or just interested in having a wonderful dinner with an amazing view of Boston, the Top of the Hub is a can't miss.

My vegetarian friend came into town and I enticed her to go with me with promises of veggie dogs and vegetarian chili. \\n\\nWe went last Wednesday during the short storm. Firstly, I was surprised by how huge and upscale the building is. From the yelp reviews, I had imagined something much different. This place was nice. I've never eaten a hot dog in such a fancy place. \\n\\nThere were about 8 people in the bar area, but otherwise the place was empty at 4:30pm, so we had our choice of tables. We chose one in front of the huge window so we could watch the rain. This was really pleasant. Between the huge window and the sky light, a wonderful rainy day tone was achieved. \\n\\nI got a \\"build your own\\" dog and we split a large order of waffle fries. They were friggin delicious! I'm actually not sure if I've ever had waffle fries before outside of fast food ones but man, I'll be sure to have them again! It was nice that mayo was one of the dipping sauces. \\n\\nMy friend got a veggie dog \\"flap jacketed\\". Service was pretty slow, especially since we seemed to be the only two customers dining. Once our dogs did arrive though, I was as pleased as can be. My hot dog was delicious; as good as they get! The server was friendly. My friend loved her flap jacket so much, she ate it first and filled up on it. As others have said, I think the veggie dog pretty much tasted like all veggie dogs and she didn't try the veggie chili on this visit. \\n\\nWhen the bill came, I was surprised to see that my dog was only $3.00. I had thought that $3 was a base price and when I added things like cheese to my dog, the price would go up. This was not the case. My entire meal (fries, drink, dog exactly how I dreamed it'd be) only cost like $6.00. Woo hoo! \\n\\nAlso, they serve the drinks in jars. My fiance is a big fan of drinking from jars so I may just get him in here with me soon. More delicious hot dogs and waffle fries for me! Maybe today!! \\n\\nFinally, I did some exploring because I was curious about the bathrooms. That is a long building! Anyway, the bathroom looked beautiful and clean. I hate that you have to pay to park during the daytime. I know, I know, this is just what comes with a downtown business. Well, maybe I wish this business wasn't downtown! If this business was somewhere else centrally located with a parking lot and if the service has been speedier, it would have been an easy 5 stars. \\n\\nOops... I almost forgot... the day that I went the music was quite eclectic but definitely awesome! \\n\\nRecap: \\n\\nFood - 5 stars \\nAtmosphere - 5 stars \\nCleanliness - 5 stars \\nPrice - 5 stars \\nDrinking jars that will likely convince my man to return w/ me - 5 stars \\nService (friendly but noticeably slow) - 4 stars \\nParking - 1 star \\n\\n**On a related note, I am a fan of Northcutt's owner replies. He has a way with words, that one. With every reply I read, I was more impressed. How can he be so tactful, friendly, and congenial while still getting his point across?

It's Portland, it's a foodie town.\\n\\nI came up from Texas and bbq and Tex-Mex are two very hard things to duplicate. So far I've found some very good taquerias but not great bbq.

I got carnitas and lengua with a side of rice and refried beans. Then I saw they had hortchata. YES. Love the stuff. They also had some agua frescas in jamaica and tamarind. I also was given a side of chips and salsa. The salsa had a mild kick to it. The chips needed salt. The tacos were just what you'd want them to look like, two tortillas each, meat, cilantro and onions. I also had red and green sauce as well. Neither were too spicy for my liking but both had decent flavor. The green sauce had a bit of a lime taste to it. The meat was cooked perfect and the carnitas had a little char to it even.

Pita Grille is located in the Fresh Market plaza at the corner of Wieuca Road and Roswell Road.  You can't really see the restaurant from Roswell - so look directly across from Fellini's and La Fonda Latina.  Pita Grille serves Mediterranean plates and sandwiches - entrees include kebab, schnitzel, falafel, grilled chicken, grilled burger, and shawarma.  Pictures of these menu offerings are above the  takeout counter.  You can also eat Shabbat dinner here with a group.\\n\\nHighlights: The kebabs are made with ground beef and cooked-to-order.  You'll have to wait a bit, but it's worth it because the meats come out really juicy.  I ordered the large kebab plate, which comes with 4 kebabs, assorted vegetables from the salad bar, and two pieces of pita bread.  The vegetables are fresh.  I appreciated the number of different vegetables I got, which along with the usual cucumber and tomato included cabbage and eggplant.  I thought the eggplant was excellent.   Probably would ask for more eggplant next time.\\n\\nCritiques: My kebabs were very juicy, but I would have liked them even better with more seasoning.  Mediterranean salads and vegetables are typically very simple, but some herbs would probably have enhanced the flavor.  While the majority of the vegetables were good and the eggplant was excellent, I'll probably skip the onions next time.\\n\\nOverall: Good, reasonable Mediterranean kebab plate for $16 + tax.  I read some other complaints about price in other reviews - I think I've had some slightly more flavorful kebab plates for $16, but the price is still at the high end of acceptable.  I definitely appreciate how the meat was cooked to order."},{"name":"Frank","address":"407 Colorado St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"This is a review for the following two items:\\n\\n*Militia Manhattan: House-made Bacon-infused Makers Mark Bourbon, Dolin Sweet & Dry Vermouth.

So essentially I compiled a ridiculous collection of now illegal 4Loko and hoarded them all these years since. Strange no? Well my friend was rummaging through my fridge and found said 4Lokos and asked me about them, I informed him that they were the FDA banned variety and he asked if he could have one. I still have substantial stock so I let him have one. Well on this particular day he convinced me to have one too before we hit SXSW and I acquiesced.

My mom went before and raved about it, so I've been dying to try it out. Hamilton's Kitchen is located in the gorgeous Alfond Inn off New England Avenue in Winter Park. The offered free valet parking which was a plus. If you frequent the downtown Winter Park area, you must know how troublesome finding a parking spot can be! I was immediately impressed walking through the beautiful hotel with unique artwork surrounding you. There is a lounge you walk through to get to Hamilton's Kitchen that offers dining tables and a bar. \\nI went with a group of four, so I was lucky in getting to try many menu items in one trip. \\nFor starters, we sampled the meatballs that were in a thick red sauce and were very tasty. We also had a charcuterie board which had cheese, sliced meats, baguette slices, and a grainy mustard. All together the items meshed perfectly- a harmony of flavors! My favorite appetizer was the Truffle Mac'n Cheese. Wasn't quite sure what is was at first, they were deep fried ball shaped with a dab of aioli on top. Then when you cut into them, happiness occurs! White cheddar and little ditalini noodles comes pouring out. They are heavenly! \\nFor my entree, I chose the Pan Seared Lemon Pepper Crusted Salmon. It comes on a bed on Cannellini beans and topped with fresh baby greens. The fish was superb. It was cooked to perfection. My co-worker got the Steak & Frites- which included a Coulette Steak and truffle fries. I tried some of hers (since I almost chose it for myself) and it was excellent as well. My other co-worker tried their special which was lamb chops. I myself don't indulge, but she ate every bite and said it was amazing.\\nThen, we couldn't leave without giving the desserts a whirl. I ordered the mango sorbet, which was the only item of the evening that didn't agree with my tastebuds. However, the owner of our company ordered the dessert sampler- which was definitely the way to go! It had 4 mini cannolis, 4 decandent brownies with a small dollop of whipped cream, chocolates pieces, and a caramel drizzle- yum! The real show stopper however had to be these little slices of almond cake that had the most delicious pistachio mouse and a layer of dark chocolate on top. By far one of the best desserts I've tried in a long time.\\nOverall, Hamilton's Kitchen is a hidden gem, and I already cannot wait to go back! The only reason why I gave them 4 stars instead of 5 was the service. Being a fancier joint, I expected a little more from the wait staff. Our waiter confessed he was \\"new\\", he wasn't very familiar with menu items when we asked questions, and took off for long periods and was no where in sight. This was the only drawback of the evening, but the exemplary food definitely made up for it. Hamilton's Kitchen is a Farm To Table restaurant. I try to frequent as many of these types of restaurants when I can and am very excited when I find another one in town. Also, they are pet friendly at Hamilton's on the patio which I am also excited to come back and bring my pup. The patio was absolutely stunning. It had lights and fireplace tables that lit up the night. Or you could simply sit back and take in the charming architecture of the hotel. I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant.

Food orders went missing because of all the chaos. They ran out of certain dishes... but we couldn't order food earlier because there weren't enough tables to eat them on.

After being seated, the waiter addressed me by someone else's name - no biggie, I just hope she's pretty :-) Once he realized I was not who I presume was a VIP guest, he apologized profusely and proceeded to take our drink orders. When we received our drinks, the lime that I requested was missing from my vodka soda (a little perplexing, considering the fact that this is traditionally a component of the drink - come on, bartender!). It only took two additional reminders before I finally got it. But again, I am a forgiving diner. We ordered the calamari and lobster mac and cheese for appetizers. The calamari, which reached the table first, was very basic. Tasty, but far from extraordinary. The lobster mac and cheese was a huge disappointment. It was overcooked - gooey more than creamy, like your typical failed attempt at the boxed stuff. My first few bites (yeah, I continued eating it because I hate wasting food, it was edible, and I was hoping it would get better beneath the surface) lacked any lobster. When I commented on this, my friend picked out a few pieces for me to try. It reminded me of those imitation crabmeat sticks you can buy by the case at your local wholesale store. Not impressed.\\n\\nMy entree was the green curry (I requested it without bamboo shoots, and it indeed was served without them) with chicken. I had asked the waiter about the spice level of the curries before ordering and was told that the green was the spiciest. I love spicy food and was looking forward to some heat. But, alas, the only heat was the scalding temperature of the curry. I guess it's all relative. Perhaps the focus here is on the level of sweetness rather than spice. My friend also ordered curry, the Massaman. Both dishes were very soupy, so much so that the waiter was probably saying a prayer that nothing spilled or splashed on the way to the table. I was expecting to use the spoon that accompanied the curry to place the rice and curry in or on an additional bowl or plate. But since that never came, I used the spoon to eat. Probably a faux pas, but there was no way I could eat that with a fork. The rice was a little sticky, which I didn't really mind, but the few spoonfuls could not stand up to the large bowl of curry soup. I also don't recall having pineapple in green curry, but there were some chunks swimming in it. I'm not much of a pineapple fan, so I did pick those out. \\n\\nOverall, it wasn't a bad experience. There seemed to be a constant flow of diners and the atmosphere was laid back with a hint of trendiness. If I return, I will probably just hang at the bar and have a few appetizers.

The waitress looked at me as though I had two heads. She scoffed and said that I could substitute one cheese for another but that was it. The pizzas were gourmet and unique, but they we're very skimpy on the toppings. My pizza was supposed to have mozzarella and Gorgonzola cheese on it and had very little cheese of either kind. The pizzas were quite pricey for what they were, however, they were tasty. The most disappointing part of our experience was by far the service. Our waitress never checked on us to ask us how our food was or if we needed anything. She plunked the bill down in front of my boyfriend and walked away. Needless to say, we did not tip her as well as we would have if she had been kinder and more attentive.

When I said my Hubby and I live in Burlington but this was our first time here, instead of smiling and welcoming us, she barked that they have been there for four years in a manner pretty much saying \\"What's wrong with you?\\"  I do not appreciate this rude style of banter.  Especially at these prices. We were guests of  another couple, but it had to be over $900 for the table.  She had to make a snarky remark back to everything I said.

As others have mentioned, a $1.5 million renovation on greens and bunkers was recently completed. The bunkers were in phenomenal shape, some of the fluffiest sand that I've ever seen. Greens were in good condition, quite hard/firm, ballmarks were rare. Strangely, there was no fringe on the greens, and that made for some annoyances when your ball was on the green, nestled against the fringe. \\n\\nPaid $79 as a resident on a packed Sunday morning, cart included, no range balls or lunch or anything else included. Decent elevation change for a Florida course.\\n\\nEmployees were friendly, there was a marshall driving around, always nice to have on a busy day. The pro shop was pretty barren, especially when it came to clubs. Very few demo clubs available (a nice perk at many other courses).\\n\\nThere are little things that they could do to go out of their way to make the round more 'luxurious': tees in the cart, free yardage book, nicer \\"hole plaques\\" on each hole, etc. The locker room was pretty sparse, towels were old, no nice products to use post-round (no shaving cream, deodorant, razors, shampoo in my shower, etc.). \\n\\nMany of the pins were on small portions of the green. This course has very generous landing areas off the tee, but is reasonably difficult around the greens. \\n\\nMy biggest disappointment with this course was simply the near-total lack of memorable holes. The only one that really sticks out is #9, a 90-degree-dogleg left par4, where you have to decide if you want to try to fly the water off the tee to give yourself an easy 2nd shot, although the hole can be played easily but hitting a mid-iron off the tee and for your approach. But nearly every hole wound through a neighborhood. Boring. \\n\\nI simply found the course and the experience to be boring and unmemorable. When I'm paying $79 in Central Florida, I expect something more, especially since that was my only round of golf. I could have played at Orange County National for four dollars less, and that course is infinitely more memorable and better; no houses in sight, just picturesque golf. \\n\\nMetroWest is perfectly adequate as a neighborhood course, or if you care more about your game itself, and don't really care about the environment. I would certainly be open to return if someone else was paying, or if they had a steeply discounted rate. But in my opinion, it is simply not a place to go for a memorable experience."},{"name":"Home Slice Pizza","address":"1415 S Congress St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"1 hour wait on a Wednesday?

He made a lame excuse about \\"oh yeah, we just figured that out\\", and I proceeded to tell him how bad the service was. There was no apology, no offer to refund me for my meal, and he just walked away. I waited an additional 15 minutes for my food and the order taker handed it through the window. I asked where my drink was, and he acted like I didn't order one.....I said I ordered a COMBO which comes with the drink. He gave me my drink and I asked for my receipt.

I did appreciate the fact that the food was made to order, it doesn't get better than that.  The staff was friendly and accommodating too, and somehow even with a long line the tables seem to turn over fast enough so that by the time you get your food, there is somewhere to sit.  \\n\\nA pet peeve though, and this has nothing to do with the Paramount, but the customers.

When one writes review, how does one determine an acceptable visit? Does one take an approach of universalism, rating a restaurant based on objective qualities such as d√©cor, service and food quality? Does one, as Keats stated, find beauty in truth, truth beauty, bestowing 5 stars to those restaurants who achieve some Platonic ideal of gastronomy? \\n\\nOr does one, in writing a review, tend more towards the relativistic in which one's experience within a restaurant determines its quality, regardless of other seeming absolutes? In other words, despite the high quality of the food, the care taken in preparation, the acclaim given by companions sitting at the very same table, you could merely muster a very whelmed \\"Meh.\\" Such are the existential quandaries facing the average Yelper. And such is my experience at The Dynamic Dish.\\n\\nIn short, the wife loved her turkey sandwich. She applauded the high quality ingredients. (She's obviously taken to heart her latest forays into \\"The Omnivore's Dilemma\\" and \\"In Defense of Food.\\") I, being more of the Xbox/Dipshit variety, was less impressed. I ordered the Patty Pan Quiche, a quiche topped with yellow squash and served at room temperature. To my taste buds, it tasted like....room temperature quiche. Could my palate distinguish between the locally sourced vegetables, the cage-free eggs? Did the freshness implied in each bite burst through with each forkful? No.\\n\\nThen again, my palate is more adept at telling the difference between an Oreo and a Hydrox than it is savoring the latest locovore's spank material. In other words, I am not the target audience for The Dynamic Dish. My wife knew this when she asked me to lunch. She also knew this when she gladly paid the $30+ dollars for the two of us (with only tap water to drink) because 1) she enjoyed her meal greatly and 2) she wisely understood that I would NOT have gladly paid $30 for this lunch and would have complained about it for several lunches hence.\\n\\nSo what do I rate The Dynamic Dish? (The service was fine, by the way.) Is it even fair that I do so? It's like asking my opinion on the Jonas Brothers or Dale Jarrett's latest win or if I'm excited about the new Twilight movie that's coming out. Unfortunately, Yelp requires a rating to proceed and as such, I'm going to have to split the difference between relativism and universalism; it's time I admit to being a raging Kant who  encourages others to kiss my a posteriori. I won't rate TDD as low as I would have were I to just wander in off the street, but I must temper others' praise with my own experience. In other words, three stars with one very large, very prominent asterisk."},{"name":"Gracie's","address":"729 SW 15th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Adding a point merely for service, which was great.\\n\\nMy wife's risotto was not cooked thoroughly - and we both like things al dente.\\n\\nMy salmon was overcooked.

Anyways when we got to the table they immediately brought us bread - which like everyone else said was delish!  Big fluffy rolls with some butter with sea salt on them already.  Moving on, we shared a she-crab soup and each got an oyster since it is an oyster bar after all.  The soup was really good - and they even split it for us!  I wish I could have had more of the shrimp toast though - that was amazing!  For dinner I got the tuna which came with a small side of crispy potatoes and charred octopus - everything was really good!  My date got the duck fat swordfish and he said his was really good -- he ate the entire thing!  We got a side of the hushpuppies to share.  Definitely get them!  It's like dessert with dinner!

My family eats an oil-free vegan diet, and Bouldin Creek exceeds our expectations every time.\\n\\nI alternate between the zucchini migas made with tofu and the chickpea 'chicken' salad sandwich with a side of basil aioli. The tofu scramble mixture is the best I've ever eaten. It's perfectly seasoned and not greasy at all, plus it's a TON of food. One time when I ordered it, it was unbearably spicy. The server suggested that the kitchen probably put the wrong seasoning blend in it. Otherwise it's been perfect every time. If you like an array of flavors, ask for a side of the chipotle pecan pesto. It's got a lovely flavor and a slight spice kick in the aftertaste. The chickpea chicken salad sandwich is amazing. It's very similar to my recipe for a chickpea \\"tuna\\" salad. The only downside to that sandwich is the tough, white bread it's served on. I just need to remember to ask for a different bread next time. Bouldin Creek's vegan basil aioli is phenomenal and makes a perfect spread for this sandwich.\\n\\nMy husband likes to get the Renedict made vegan: pressed ciabatta, tofu scramble, vegan hollandaise, spinach, and fake bacon. I'm not a fan of fake bacon, but he loves it, and the vegan hollandaise sauce is out of this world. It's a beautiful and filling entree. He's also gotten the Smokin' Joe omelette, made with tofu, of course, topped with chipotle pecan pesto.\\n\\nThe red and black beans are incredible. They have that smoky flavor that reminds me of the way my Granny used to make beans for family BBQ's. The potato hash cake is a good size and perfectly crispy on the outside, also delicious topped with the chipotle pecan pesto.\\n\\nBouldin Creek has decent hummus, but I'm not a fan of the tablespoon of oil they plop in the middle of it.

No overnight camping, crowd control officers on horseback, or trampling ala black friday specials at the adjacent Kohls. Actually, a good steakhouse was missing from Sunset Valley. The nearest Outback Steakhouse only opens for lunch friday only; Stassney and I-35 is a bit far for a lunch outing when your wife works in the Oak Hill area.\\n\\nThe interior looks like my parents house, add in a few deer heads and it would be a perfect copy. From demolition of the old Red Robin to the new digs this place went up amazingly quick. Our lunch had a positive vibe starting with good service. Longhorn is part of the Darden Restaurant Group that also owns Red Lobster. With that said, they could do better with the bread. Refrigerator cold butter also detracted from the experience. \\n\\nWe started with the grilled cheddar stuffed mushrooms. Count five or six shrooms topped with white cheddar with garlic anointing each cap. The flavor was OK, not worth the $7.50 in my opinion. Other than the shrimp cocktail, all other lunch starters make their way from the deep fryer to your table. Why the dinner counterparts like the shrimp and lobster dip isn't offered I'm not sure.\\n\\nThe lovely Mrs. Rooster had the shaved prime rib sandwich while I tackled the Flo's filet. My steak was cooked to perfection and was fork tender; one of the better filets I've had that didn't come from my personal charcoal grill. The wife on the other hand found her sandwich greasy and lacking flavor. Sides on both entrees were traditional steakhouse fare.\\n\\nDarden also owns the Olive Garden which I loath; but I've always had a soft spot for Red Lobster. The crack like cheddar bay biscuits always win me over. Longhorn falls in the middle of the two other options in the chain. My steak was spectacular while the rest was average.

Driving around there a little bit, we finally turned down New England Dr and saw the variety of places to eat along this section, at which point my sister directed us to find a parking spot and that one of the restaurants along there would be the place that we ate that night. That ended up being Armando's... and it was a good choice.\\n\\nWe decided to eat outside, which suited us quite well as the evening wasn't that hot (it had rained earlier in the day, cooling things down a bit) and it was relatively quiet. We did go inside to use the bathrooms, that sort of thing, and found the interior to be quite noisy.\\n\\nHappy hour was happening, so beers and cocktails were ordered along with water, and we decided on a appetize of the mussels. Along with this Armando's also brings out a bread basket with olive oil and balsamic vinegar. The vinegar seemed to be sunk under a small lake of olive oil, so I passed on it and ate the bread straight, which was very nice. While waiting for the mussels to arrive, we also ordered our main courses. I ordered the spaghetti carbonara, my sister ordered the gnocci, and my mother got the chicken marsala. I asked if they could do the carbonara using linguini, but unfortunately their next wider noodle turns out to be pappardelle, which is simply too wide a noodle for a carbonara... I feel the maximum width of a noodle for carbonara should be somewhere around tagliatelle or fettuccine. Spaghetti would have to do.\\n\\nOur mussels came out, and they were good. The broth they were served in was a bit heavy in butter, but that was alright. We made due, and the bread that had been served earlier worked very well with this broth, too. We found only one dud mussel in the batch, which isn't bad (by dud, I mean we simply could not get it open... it was solidly closed up). \\n\\nSoon after this, pretty much perfectly on time, our mains came out. I really enjoyed my carbonara, though it was a lot drier than I have experienced in the past. The use of actual pancetta was a very nice touch, but I think it could have used a bit more cream to make it more of a sauce. Mind you, it was still very good, just not quite what I was expecting in consistency. Frankly, I wouldn't necessarily change the recipe... it was just different, and the taste was excellent. \\n\\nI did try my sister's gnocci and my mother's marsala, and both were also very nice. No complaints from either of them about the food!\\n\\nWe thoroughly enjoyed our time at Armando's, and we are very likely to return sometime in the future as it is tough to find a truly good Italian restaurant."},{"name":"Equinox Restaurant and Bar","address":"830 N Shaver St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"This place is a hidden gem.

That's right, hipsters. BETTER. Let me explain.\\n\\nI've been in Portland for a week now and have tried several of Blue Star's flavors. I appreciate their concept...but really, only one of their flavors was really tasty to me. The others were throwaways (and I actually DID throw two away). \\n\\nTo those reviews stating that Voodoo Donuts are \\"too sweet\\"...it's a DONUT, not a hoagie. Get over it. That the cereal on top is \\"stale\\"...I don't doubt this, but that's why I don't get the flavors with cereal on them. Everyone knows that cereals like Froot Loops and Cocoa Puffs go stale about 6.3 minutes after being left out. And to anyone that has mentioned the calories, I humbly request that you fuck off and get thee to the nearest vegan food cart. Clearly you don't \\"get\\" what donuts are about.\\n\\nI appreciate that Blue Star is trying to elevate the humble donut into the gourmet stratosphere, but look, when I want a DONUT, I want a classic donut. I don't need an organic-lemon-with-poppyseeds-picked-by-blind-Himalayan-sherpas artisanal donut.\\n\\nEnter Voodoo. Yes, they are over the top. Yes, they're in a shit-ass neighborhood teeming with derelicts. The cash only thing sucks. HOWEVER, the donuts are exactly what I want in a donut...overindulgent, sweet, cakey, perfect. \\n\\nMy favorites? Diablos Rex (I want as much chocolate as I can possibly ingest in one sitting), Marshall Mathers (mini M&Ms over regular M&Ms ALL DAY) and the Ol' Dirty Bastard (plain raised donut smothered in chocolate frosting and Oreos,?drizzled with peanut butter...total heaven. ODB would be proud. He'd probably take his donut with a side of cocaine, but I digress.)\\n\\nIn conclusion...Voodoo is old-school Portland. Weird,  wild, funky, fun. Blue Star is new Portland: hipster, artisanal, put-a-bird-on-it, tasty. Both are good, but if you really want a classic donut, Voodoo wins every time."},{"name":"Panahar - Bangladeshi Place","address":"3375 Buford Hwy NE, Ste 1060","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Panahar is a three and a half star restaurant in a three or four star Yelp world.

The lunch buffet is a solid presentation of good Bangladeshi cuisine. There were three meat entrees and four vegetarian entrees, rice, naan bread, soup, chick pea salad, and a few dessert choices. The flavors were a little too mild for my taste, but I am not as familiar with Bangladesh food as i am North or South Indian. At $10 for a lunch buffet, I can think of other places that are better, but when you can bring your own wine, it makes it seem a lot more reasonable.

There was a line out the door and it took about 10 minutes to get in; not too bad. I was in a mood for a vanilla cream donut but had to settle for custard since they don't have vanilla (or chocolate) fillings. The donut was good but not great. As someone used to the great Amish donuts available in mid Atlantic, I can tell you that these are just average. Creative yes (if you like to pay more to have a donut covered with fruit loops), but not worth the wait or the premium for the donut. Delicious Amish donuts back east, about $1, average but trendy Voodoo donut, generally about 2. Another thing, there was hardly any custard in the donut.

Some of our dishes took more than 45 minutes to arrive.  And we were all starving.  It was agony.  Especially for those of us that had to watch our friends' dishes come out long before even a piece of food arrived for us.  You'd think one of the salads ordered would be one of the first things to arrive.  But they don't appear to care whether your item was from the appy list or the rest of the menu.  They send it out when they make it, and they make it in whatever order they feel like.  This is often the case in many Japanese restaurants, I have found.  But this was especially frustrating because they didn't balance the orders so that each person got to eat something first.\\n\\nAnyhow, enough about my gripe.  The food IS wonderful, and the server was very nice.  They offer gluten free soy sauce, which was super handy for my man.  And they only use wild salmon.  No farmed!  All their ocean wise approved foods are labelled as such, which makes it handy for those of us that are conscious consumers.  I am looking forward to coming again and trying more delicious food.  I'll just make sure I put enough coins in the meter and give myself plenty of time.  And maybe bring a snack in my purse...\\n\\nSeriously... there was a tree on my friend's plate.  I'm pretty sure they grew the tree themselves and then trimmed it, which is why the rest of the plates took so long to arrive.\\n\\nEdit: Forgot to add that the saba was incredible.  So fresh and lightly seared with a torch to bring out the flavour.  Best I have had outside Japan.  The salmon tataki roll was wonderfully balanced, too.  And the spicy tofu appy was perfect.  It even had a slight hint of sweetness to the sauce.  Almost like mango.  Really great.  My friend ordered a prosciutto roll which I tried a bite of and was also very interesting and good.

I've been here about twenty plus times now (keep in mind I had my first bite of sushi this summer). I come here just for the sushi (I've never gotten anything else), so my review is based purely on the quality of their sushi, which is super fresh. Their rolls are very well made and bite sized, which is important to me. I hate it when some places make their rolls so big that I have to take two bites out of each roll. It ruins the experience for me. Anyway, I always get the Spicy Tuna and Idaho maki. The Boston maki is also quite delicious, as well as the Spicy White Tuna. I went here for a birthday dinner once and got two boats and everything on it was super scrumptious so I can safely say that almost everything they have to offer is pretty darn good.\\n\\nThe staff is also extremely friendly and attentive. I come here so often that one of the waitresses recognizes me now, which is pretty nice.. makes it more personal :).\\n\\nAlso, the mochi ice cream here is to. die. for. If you ever make time to come here for the sushi, or whatever, make sure you try the mochi ice cream. You have no excuse not to, each one is only a dollar! My favorite is mango.\\n\\nI also love that it's only a five minute walk from my building. Being a college student without my own kitchen, it's nice to have the option to take a quick walk to Maluken when the selection at the dining hall gets a bit boring.\\n\\nI generally tend to go in during odd hours on the weekdays so it's pretty quite and service is really fast but I did go in on a Saturday night last week and it was extremely busy and it took awhile for our sushi to be ready.

Aside from the fact that it's several years late to the Atlanta gourmet burger wars, this fast-casual hamburger house is situated directly across the street from the nation's leading health protection agency. In the end, the food here is by no means criminal, but unfortunately, the all-natural grass-fed burger schtick has already been done elsewhere - and much better, quite frankly.  \\n\\nFood: In addition to burgers, the menu at this place also offers various types of hot dogs and a limited selection of \\"accessories\\" (fresh cut fries or onion rings). Dessert options include cupcakes and multiple different frozen custard concoctions, including shakes, floats, sundaes, concretes, cups, and cones. Alcohol is also available. During my visit,  I opted for the chicken apple dog and also shared a large order of fresh-cut fries, both of which were acceptable. Unfortunately, the concrete I ordered after the meal didn't fare as well - the frozen custard had a slightly congealed texture and the alleged \\"mix-in's\\" were virtually non-existent.  \\n\\nService: Consistent with the overly intrusive, and frequently awkward, service trend in many Atlanta area fast-food restaurants, a staff member screams \\"welcome to Burgerfi\\" at every patron who graces the doors of the place, to which the rest of the staff follow with \\"all-natural\\". All orders are placed at a central counter and your food is brought out to you once it's ready - of course, the delivery is not complete without a final staff member thanking you for eating \\"all-natural\\". \\n\\nAtmosphere: I was told that the interior of this place was comprised of environmentally sustainable components, including chairs that are made from recycled Coke bottles, tables made out of compressed recycled wood, and low power consumption fans. They also maintain a stringent recycling program, which is refreshing to see for a fast-food chain concept in Atlanta. \\n\\nCost: The food items themselves aren't necessarily pricey, but everything is a la carte, so your bill can quickly add up. The overall bill for two people, including a burger, chicken dog, large order of fries, and two drinks, clocked in at over $25. \\n\\nOther: Burgerfi is located in the Emory Point Plaza - the front entrance of the restaurant faces out toward Clifton Rd. Free parking is available in the plaza garage for up to two hours. I had originally thought that this place was some type of wi-fi influenced burger concept, but apparently the name is a shorthand version of the term \\"burgerfication\\", which the franchise describes as America's growing expectations for a burger with \\"the flavor and tenderness that we've come to expect in a fine steak\\"."},{"name":"Inka Chicken","address":"1707 Wells Branch Pkwy","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Had a nice tip from a friend about INKA, and was expecting a Mexican syle joint a la Fresas (which is muy disappointing) but was pleasantly surprised to find another country in South America known for great food represented: Peru!\\n\\nThe roasted chicken was succulent and I would love to know that seasoning blend.

Of course, the quality probably wouldn't have been there.  \\n\\nWhen I needed a refill for my soda, it took a while again.  Our bill was also off and even though our server said it would be corrected, he came back with the exact same bill.  Third time proved to be a charm.  The restaurant may have more restrooms on another floor, but the ones where we were had 2 stalls, the first of which is pretty small.  When we left, Spazz commented that our server was carrying food on the other level, so it's very likely that he had a ton of tables to wait on and probably contributed to the soda and billing issue.  \\n\\nWhat has this restaurant taught me?

The ceviche was the great disappointment of the night. It seemed that they prepared the ceviche and then froze it for later use. The acidity of the lemon was gone and the lemon juice was somewhat bitter due to oxidation, ruining the taste of the dish. The meat felt rubbery because of the freeze and defrost and in the middle it was ice hard. To add to the complaint, the portion is ridiculously small.

We did do the prix fixe menu with an extra appetizer.  We had the mussels, lobster Mac and cheese and Coconut shrimp to start.  All had great flavors and great portions.  We could have stopped the meal here and be  full.  I had the fried grouper with curry and my girlfriend the sea bass. Both were excellent with the right amount of spice and plenty of fresh ingredients. One of the best meals I have had in a long time.  For dessert I had a cheesecake and my bff had a coconut carrot cake.  The cheesecake was light and fluffy with good balance.  The carrot cake was nothing special.  Just okay.

Hey, all drinks at fine dining restaurants, even some gastro pubs run around 13 bucks.\\n\\nThere are definitely more creative drink menus out there.  Top of the hub hasn't got the creativity and the liquid nitro drinks of blue inc and it isn't part of the hip tiki revival (I'm not old enough to have experienced the original fad), but with the beautiful views and the live music, there isn't a better place to plop that booze $$.\\n\\nI haven't ordered off the regular menu in over half a decade so I can't comment on that, but the bar menu is safe and tasty.  Tuna tartar with avacado is solid.  The mussels are tasty and a great value since it's big enough to share with several people.  I also had a melted brie with fig compote dish that was great as well.\\n\\nTried an old fashioned, a lemon drink in a martini glass the name of which I cannot recall and also a cucumber vodka drink.  The standout here was definitely the cucumber vodka drink.  It's really clean.\\n\\nIf you sit in the lounge area you'll probably get a view of the harbor or dorchester.  I have yet to see across the river or into the financial district so I'm guessing the best views are reserved for the main dining area.\\n\\nTop of the hub is great for out-of-towners as well as local company.

I stand by my earlier rating, with a few additional comments:\\n\\nFirst, I'm not a big fan of carryout in general (with a few exceptions), but I was on the hunt for something to bring back to the office for my coworker and I while working on a Saturday. My usual downtown standbys were not open-- but De Novo was!\\n\\nSecond, while perusing the menu, the helpful staff member let me know that only the brunch menu was being offered at that moment. Now, I've been a little confused by De Novo's menus for awhile. I've seen their menu system go through a few different versions-- from a single card and now to a rather large binder with page-protector-housed menus. It always seems like a lot do digest (har har) when you sit down, as I recall my earlier dine-in visits. I know De Novo changes their menu from time to time, and obvioulsy only certain portions of the great big binder are relevant at different times. I feel like handing each customer a paper menu, with only the relevant options for that moment, would be prefered. It would feel more bistro-esque, so to speak. I guess these binders might be \\"greener\\" in the sense they don't have to print as many menus...? \\n\\nFor carryout today I ordered the chop De Novo salad (with chicken added). I still really love this salad, but it seemed less chopped than previous times I've ordered it. The chicken was a tad dry. Still totally worth it -- that dressing is fresh and delish.\\n\\nI also ordered the kobe beef burger (sans bun). Always yummy, with a little kick to it. Without the bun to soak up the juices, though, the burger's oiliness stood out to me. No real complaints there, because if the bun had been present, it would have needed the right amount of grease to keep everything moist. So, that's my bad, not theirs. I ordered a vegetable replacement for the fries (though I do love their fries!) and I got a truly delightful sautee of sun dried tomatoes, portabello mushroom strips, and asparagus. It was delicious-- I didn't even miss the fries (!!), and didn't have to feel guilty besides. They still had a decent slick of oil on them, but totally flavorful.   \\n\\nI still haven't gotten a chance to try breakfast or a proper brunch, but besides having been back for lunches, I've come by for happy hour a few times. Service is always super-friendly, but I would skip the flatbreads. The last few times I had them, they were just 'meh'. A little dry, too sparse on the toppings. \\n\\nI should also mention-- the first time I went back to De Novo after writing my initial review, the waiter asked me specifically about whether I wanted water with my alcoholic beverage (something I whined about in my last review). I don't know if De Novo reads Yelp reviews or not, but I was quite pleased!\\n\\nOh, and yes... I ate two entrees.

God.\\n\\nTruly one of the great culinary experiences of my life.  See also, Babbo, February 2006; Toro Bravo, January 2010; Bay House, 2009; and Sel Gris, 2007)\\n\\nDoes the world (of yelp) need a 489th review for Andina?  Probably not, but I guess that's what I'm on yelp for so here it goes anyways...\\n\\nI had the opportunity to (finally) go here last weekend when I was invited to participate in a surprise birthday dinner for a dear friend.  Her husband chose Andina, made the reservations and all I had to do was show up with MBH on my arm on the appointed day at the appointed time.  What an incredible time.\\n\\nWe had:\\n\\n- PIMIENTO PIQUILLO RELLENO:  piquillo peppers stuffed with cheese, quinoa and Serrano ham\\n\\nA great variation on the chile relleno.  This is at least the fourth variation I've seen, including one at Toro Bravo, Saffron and here (plus the original).  \\n\\n- ANTICUCHO DE CORAZON:  marinated beef heart kebobs, served with a spicy salsa de rocoto\\n\\nSo.  Good.  Spicy, tender and wonderful.\\n\\n- DON'T REMEMBER WHAT THEY'RE CALLED SPECIAL:  they had a pork cheeks special that Mrs. K. may or may not have had a When Harry Met Sally moment while eating.  That good.\\n\\n- PALTA RELLENA DE CANGREJO Y LANGOSTINOS:  avocado stuffed with crab and prawns \\n\\n-  CAUSA SOLTERITO:  a traditional preparation of freshly mashed potatoes, infused with key lime juice and pressed into a cake with green beans, fresh corn and cheese salad\\n\\nThis was amazing.  Absolutely loved it.  Plus it was a hit for both our carnivores and veges in the group.\\n\\n- TABULE DE CEREALES ANDINOS:  quinoa salad served with queso fresco, avocados and olives\\n\\n-  YUCA RELLENA:  cheese-stuffed yuca with an aj Amarillo and cheese sauce\\n\\nLet's see.  Take a potato (I know yucas are different, but they're both similar starches so let it alone), add cheese, and fry.  How can this possibly go wrong?  I don't know that it can and it certainly doesn't here.\\n\\n- DE BETARRAGA roasted red and golden beets, served with a traditional aj√≠ verde al bat√°n, pickled vegetables and sesame oil 10.\\n\\nAwesome.  Awesome.  Awesome.  I happen to have a not-so-passing infatuation with beets, so this definitely met that need.\\n\\nQUINOTO DE HONGOS DE LA MONTA√ëA:  the Incas referred to quinoa as chisaya mama or mother of all grains; golden beet and local mushroom quinoa \\"risotto\\" laced with truffle oil with grilled market fresh vegetables\\n\\nPut truffle oil on Spam and it's probably good.  Well, maybe not.  But put truffle oil on delicious quinoa, beets, mushrooms and veges and you have a little bite of heaven in your mouth.\\n\\nWe also had some drinky-drinks:\\n\\n- pisco sour--the national drink of Peru\\n\\nYou're at a Peruvian restaurant.  You have to order these. Period.\\n\\n- SACSAYHUAM√ÅN:  habanero pepper vodka shaken with pureed passion fruit and cane sugar, served up with a sugar rim and a cilantro leaf garnish \\n\\nMrs. K. decided that this is her favorite cocktail ever.  And I can't say I disagree.  This has the same composition as a number of drinks you'll find around (see, e.g., Mrs. K.'s former Favorite Drink Ever, the Peruvian at Olive or Twist--mazama pepper vodka, mango puree, serrano chili).  But the passionfruit and the habanero really do compliment each other perfectly.  Damn solid, well-balanced drink.\\n\\n- 2008 Pierre Cl√©ment M√©n√©tou-Salon (Sauvignon Blanc) from the Loire Valley in France\\n\\nBelieve it or not my first sauvignon blanc actually from France!  It was delicious.  Not as in your face as some of the Marlborough region sauv blancs from New Zealand (my current favorite), but still subtly complex with great balance.\\n\\nService was perfect.  Our server (Steven) was attentive, knowledgeable and informative.  He was not over-bearing or hover-y.  The whole staff was truly top-notch.\\n\\nFinally, the matriarch of Andina, Doris Rodriguez de Platt, graced us with a table-side visit.  Now, I don't know--maybe she greets every table every night, or maybe just birthday or other celebratory gatherings, but she really made us feel special, welcomed and truly interested in.  It really was a treat to hear her beg us to go and experience Peru first hand.  What a complete sweetheart.\\n\\nAll in all, an unforgettable meal, company and night.

But that wasn't what I was there for.. I wanted my ramen! The dish finally came out and man... I wish I hadn't ordered it at all. It was pretty bad. The noodles were cold and hard like they had just taken it out of the refrigerator 5 minutes ago. The broth wasn't even warm enough to soften the noodles.

We were looking for a restaurant not far from our hotel -- Poor Calvin's popped up, and ultimately I decided based on Yelp reviews that this was worth it. \\n\\nI called the restaurant using the number on yelp straight from my smartphone, and asked the hostess if we needed a reservation for dinner. She told me that I did, and I asked (6:20) what the earliest time she had available would be. She told me 7, I asked if it was possible to make it 6:45 (we were hungry and close.) She replied that was fine, but we needed to be prompt to be seated. No problem. \\n\\nWe hustled over (we actually walked, which was a mistake on our part, but honestly fine, despite what we later learned truly is a dicey neighborhood), and arrived promptly at 6:45. When we walked in, a waiter and the hostess were standing at the computer, as well as some folks waiting around for a table. We told them we had a 6:45 reservation, they asked for the name, we gave it, and the hostess got a weird look and was obviously having trouble finding us in the computer. After a few minutes of looking through the same entries over and over, she asked if we were sure we had a reservation. I responded that we were, because I'm relatively sure this is the woman I had spoken to roughly twenty minutes before. The waiter made HUGE EYES at me before spinning away on his heel. The whole thing was kind of awkward, but mostly I just want to be seated, so whatever. They eventually seat us directly over the heating vent. (To be fair, the hostess warned me, but if you know it's a problem, maybe think that one through?) \\n\\nWhatever, we let it go. Our waiter was actually quite nice, if not a little rushed. We got some beer, we ordered the goat cheese appetizer, which was actually totally delicious (sorry previous reviewer, I have no idea what you got, but it sounds nothing like what I ate). The atmosphere is romantic if you're not being roasted by hot air and then cooled by cold air. (Heating vent.) Even the music is well suited to the environment. \\n\\nThe crispy beef and green curry were both delicious and thoroughly enjoyed, although the \\"salad\\" on the crispy beef plate was kind of ridiculous. I left it on the plate, and the waiter looked at it and remarked, \\"nobody eats the salad\\".

The waffle was fluffy and tasty, the chicken was fried well but a little bit on the drier side. It came with a whiskey peach compote, which I wasn't too big of a fan of.

I mean, try my fave, the Southern Belle: blackened vienna hot polish beef dressed with pimento cheese, fried green tomatoes (yes), Cajun remoulade, and mf'ing scallions. Like, that's a hot dog that exists. And it is fabulous. And so is everything else. I've yet to have a single thing on the menu that didn't at least meet expectations (and as a yelper, mine are high), including the salads. \\n\\nAnother highlight is def the loaded fries, because it's basically just a deconstructed baked potato made out of french fries -- dooo try.You just can't get that level of quality in a hot dog joint anywhere else nearby. \\n\\nI wanted to give Frank 5 stars, but their handling of takeout orders leaves room for improvement. I once ordered a vegetarian dog and even double checked that it was vegetarian upon checkout, only to get home and have a regular, meaty meal waiting for me. Disappointing and potentially dangerous had I not caught it, yes, but the manager was really helpful and accommodating on our next visit. That and the bartenders can be a little snarky at times, and while yes, that's anywhere, it still leaves me less than effusive. \\n\\nAll the same, you've gotta have Frank in your playbook if you take your hot dogs and beer seriously.

Well, Pizzeria Locale is all of that. So I just wanted to clear that up. I'd say it's mostly for people in groups (1) and (3), cuz it's not \\"normal\\" pizza. I heard someone review that they were really upset, as their 7-year-old daughter didn't like it. Not surprised. It's not \\"American\\" pizza. It's authentic, ingredient-to-product originality. And it was good. Anyway, here's my review.\\n\\nFirstly, my 3-star rating is a bit lowered because I am strictly gluten-free, and was thrilled that they had their own GF crust. But...they were out of it that night. I'm not \\"gluten-free\\" as a fad...I actually do get really sick, unlike people who are not \\"GF\\" because it's supposedly better for you or something....So, anyway, they didn't have their crusts, so I had to order a salad instead. Firstly, this restaurant isn't \\"pizza\\" cheap. My wife had a pizza, I had a \\"double\\" salad (for an entree version) 2 glasses of house wine...and with tip, it was $65. JFYI, if that's a concern for you, as it kinda is for us. My salad was really authentic - marinated tuna on escarole with capers and a lemon dressing. Really simple, very fresh...but I'll be honest, I just didn't like it. My wife and I like to cook with as few ingredients as possible, so we LOVE simple flavors...not over-salted, over processed. The flavors just didn't mingle. My wife had a carpaccio pizza, and she liked it, but said it wasn't the best.\\n\\nI have to say, the Manager was unbelievable. He felt so bad that they didn't have the crust that he gave us a free butterscotch pudding dessert. Delicious. Worth it. Get it.\\n\\nBut overall, I'd say it's an....eh, just ok. Cool atmosphere, nice people, and you can tell, they really like food. I love when restaurants are damn proud of what they are, and that you could honestly go into their fridge and see real ingredients. But it just wasn't for me.\\n\\nIf you're touring Boulder and are looking for great restaurants, depending on your price, my wife and I (we're in our mid-20s) love Brasserie 1010, Jill's Restaurant in the St. Julian Hotel, The Kitchen is good (but small portions) and The Leaf is AMAZING, AMAZING vegan / vegetarian food. \\n\\nIf you're looking for pizza, sure, we still like Beau Jo's or even Pizzeria da Lupo is good.\\n\\nIf you're a foodie, you know that they guys who did next-door's Frasca did this place. I think there are better \\"foodie\\" places. After all, it is Boulder.\\n\\nAnyway, hope this review helped some people!

So far I have ordered the spring rolls and the vegetarian lo mein. The spring rolls were pretty much what you'd expect at any cheap Americanized Chinese restaurant. Small, greasy, fairly flavorless before they are smothered in sweet & sour. The vegetarian lo mein was pretty boring as well. It consisted of 95% noodles and 5% overcooked vegetables. The noodles themselves were pretty dry and required a heavy dose of chili oil to liven things up. \\n\\nSo why 3 stars when the food isn't even that good? The bar. If it weren't for the all-day $1.00 Rolling Rock pints, I'm not sure that I would have even ended up there in the first place. On top of that they've got friendly bartenders and a pretty decent jukebox. Great spot to hit up on your way to a Mississippi bar crawl. \\n\\nGame night can be pretty bad if you're not into sports, but great if you're into people watching.

It used to be somewhere on Clairmont.\\n\\nWe stopped in with child and got the veggie platter (for one), and the chicken nibs (tibs? nibs? can't remember exactly).  The former is a massive piece of injera with at least 8 or so different veggie toppings.  The latter is a medium-heat dish with ample chunks of whitemeat chicken, onions, tomato, and some spinach and cabbage on the side. And of course they give you plenty of injera.\\n\\nBoth plates were huge and this, along with a samosa-type appetizer (these weren't very big) was enough for 3 or 4 people.\\n\\nPlusses: We live close-by, the staff and manager were very friendly.  We were intrigued, had read a good review or two, and would like to see this type of place do well.\\n\\nAs stated, the portions were huge, very tasty.  We had leftovers for dinner the next night.\\n\\nMinuses: it's not really that nice inside, but it's 'okay'.  Ethiopian food tends to be rather messy.  I'm fine with the el-cheapo disposable paper napkins, but at least give us a stack of them or a napkin dispenser.  The napkins were doled out rather sparingly.\\n\\nI can go to restaurant.com and get certificates for similar Ethiopian places and pay quite a bit less.

Each was flavored uniquely and distinctly--and cooked perfectly. I normally have one cocktail at dinner. I had three of the Sacsayhuaman because they were THAT good. Habanero vodka with passionfruit juice--the perfect pairing. The drink was spicy--but this made it last.\\n\\nThe ambiance and service were also excellent. The hostess was very attentive, taking our cocktail orders upon our arrival since we had a short wait for the table. We were offered a table at the bar--but turned it down because seating was very tight against the window of the bar--it is side-by-side seating which we thought would be nice and intimate, but meant that our table would be touching another couple's and it was just a bit too close for comfort. The hostess was very understanding and accommodating after we declined the first table. The second table in the larger dining space was cozy and more like we had planned for private conversation.\\n\\nFood runners brought out fresh bread and dips to start--with perfectly presented descriptions and vibrant colors. The habanero mint was excellent. The second passionfruit dip would have been good--had it not seemed to emulate my cocktail entirely. The third and most mild was peanuty and yummy with bread. \\n\\nMy boyfriend and I shared small plates--starting with the ceviche mixto. It was well seasoned but on the smaller side compared to ceviche I have had elsewhere. The food runners informed us how to mix in the corn off the cob and the sweet potato placed off to the side of the rish. This was strange to me--I think the cooks or the food runners should do it if at all...the sweet potato was weird to be paired with fish!\\n\\nWe had the grilled asparagus (esparragos peruanos) and yuca rellena dishes to follow. The asparagus were cooked perfectly and the portion was generous. They were served with roasted red pepper on top, but could have used a more interesting presentation or more color on the plate. The yuca was like a big potato/mozzarella stick with cheese sauce--our diner-like indulgence that was excellent and did not set too heavily.\\n\\nTo finish, we had the grilled octopus (anticucho de pulpo) and the crab-stuffed avocado. The grilled octopus was my favorite dish--firm and perfectly seasoned with chimichurri. The waitress forgot our avocado but upon the reminder, she brought it out immediately. I was completely stuffed but tried a bite. The dungeness was excellent though the addition of mayonnaise-like sauce was a mistake. Dungeness is perfect on its own!

Hence, the overall dining experience will vary depending on how much you wait and much you mind it. I will not deduct stars because a place is popular and in high demand. Nor will add them for the same reason. My review is purely my opinion. \\n\\nThe best thing about Home Slice is the atmosphere. They've nailed the ambiance perfectly. It's pleasantly dark and warm, slightly chic without feeling exclusive in any way. Perfect for singles, couples, families, young or old. You are greeted with the rich smell of the oven as you enter, because the oven is placed right by the front of the restaurant. You can watch them roll the dough and make your pizza right on front of you if you sit at the bar. The menu is easy to navigate, not too many choices, but it is easy to make your personal changes to any menu item. The wait staff are friendly and accommodating. You can't go wrong here mo matter what you get. \\n\\nIf I have a criticism it is only that the pizza is merely good, not spectacular. You can get better pizza and if you are a pizza snob, you might come expecting a bit more from the pie and the menu than you get.

We won't be back."},{"name":"The Optimist","address":"914 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Who'd have thought an old ham-aging house would be home to one of the best restaurants in Atlanta?\\n\\nI headed to The Optimist recently for a weekend dinner. A reservation was made ahead of time; you can use OpenTable. Parking seems to be either valet or street parking. The entrance is actually on the north side of the building, therefore don't attempt to enter through the door closest to Howell Mill Road since you won't get in. Look for the putt-putt golf course. That looked cool! But it was Antarctica that evening, so I didn't want to stay outside longer than possible. \\n\\nThe building the restaurant is housed in is really charming.  I could see a swanky private party or wedding happening in the main dining room. Anyway, on to what I tried: \\n\\nSWORDFISH CRUDO, buttermilk, torched grapefruit, mint / 15. Our somewhat softspoken yet polite and attentive server Paolo mentioned this dish as one of his recommendations when asked. It was very light and fresh, feeling sort of like spring on that winter night. \\n\\nCRISPY SPANISH OCTOPUS, spicy honey, caper remoulade, \\"pickles\\" / 17. The exterior wasn't super crispy, but that was fine since this large tentacle was exciting and tastebud pleasing. Another excellent server recommendation. \\n\\nMONKFISH, romesco, olives, pine nut gremolata / 30. If you aren't familiar with the freaky-looking monkfish, Google it now. You'd think such a bizarre creature would have an unappetizing taste, but I liked its soft white flesh. Monkfish is also known as the poor man's lobster, though I didn't think it tasted much like lobster. There was a large wide bone in the fillet which came as a surprise, being more used to wispy thin fish bones. Another recommended dish. Man, Paolo was spot on. Because I didn't know, gremolata is an Italian garlic, parsley, and lemon paste, and romesco is a Catalan roasted red pepper and almond spread.\\n\\nBROCCOLINI, bagna cauda, parmesan / 9. The bagna cauda \\"(hot bath\\" in Italian) made the broccolini. It's a garlic-oil-butter-anchovy mixture which really amped up the greens. \\n\\nCHOCOLATE CRACK PIE, peanut brittle ice cream, salted caramel / 9. The chocolate crack pie was perfectly named. And with its mingling with peanut butter and caramel, it was sure to satisfy any reasonable dessert lover.\\n\\nThe menus are stamped with the day's date, so they make perfect souvenirs to mark a special occasion, just FYI.\\n\\nRestrooms consist of 3 private bathrooms for women and 3 private bathrooms for men. No issues there though I was unlucky and had a few minutes for a stall to free up.\\n\\nThe main drawback for me was the fact that the tables were ultra-close together, giving me NYC vibes unfortunately. I totally didn't need to know that the adjacent couple were on their way to the wife's sister's engagement party, alas.\\n\\nAside from that, The Optimist is a optimal setting for a special occasion or just a delightful seafood-filled meal!

This is probably my 10th visit or so to this place and have never been disappointed. The food is very fresh and perfectly seasoned.  The service I've experienced has always been top-notch.  The owner, Mirza, will make you feel like you're an old friend before you leave the place.  You'll find him easily as soon as  you enter the restaurant -- he's the one running around, serving food, cleaning tables and pouring wine (and he's the owner).  Disregard the fact that the restaurant is located in a strip mall on Buford Hwy -- the experience is certainly comparable to some of the higher-end dining establishments in Atlanta.  It's not oozing with romance or atmosphere, but it is clean with great food.  And, you can BYOB with no corkage fee.  Everything on the menu is good.  And, if you need help -- Mirza is happy to make suggestions, or he might even order for you (with, of course, the guarantee if you don't like it, he'll bring something else out at no charge).

How nice to open the door and be greeted not only by pleasantly cool air, but as I sat in my cushioned backed chair I found a glass of ice water ready for me to gulp it down. It was 12:45 PM and there were only two other tables of people, although a few people did come in to pick up take-out orders. \\n\\nVery reasonable prices, especially for the area. Most of the lunches are $6 - $8 and it's only $1.50 extra for a side of fries or pasta salad. After deciding on the chicken panini, I thought I would pass on the pasta salad, but when our waitress mentioned it was tri-colored pasta with greek dressing, olives, and sliced parmesan cheese, I quickly changed my mind. \\"That sounds so good!\\" I exclaimed as my friend shook his head in amusement at my excitement over, well, pasta. \\n\\nCut to me eating. I can't say it was the best pasta salad I have ever had (I think I only saw one piece of an olive), but I did get a much more generous portion than I had expected (almost half the plate) and they weren't stingy with the parm either which more than helped the otherwise lack flavor. And lack of flavor on pasta is better than BAD flavor. The panini on the other hand was fantastic and my friend's burger looked really good - even the bun was interesting. He got a side of fries and they were the good, coated kind and took up more than half of his plate. Well worth the $1.50!\\n\\nI would really like to go back sometime for dinner and try the risotto.

We arrived around 7:30 pm on a Monday night, and our long row of tables was all set up and ready for us since Daniel had made a reservation in advance.  However, there was only one other table of customers, so aside from our group, the restaurant wasn't busy.\\n\\nStrangely enough, the menu they have on their website is almost impossible to read, so it's pointless to look at it before you go.  Fortunately, everything on the menu was very affordable with prices that were less than $7.\\n\\nAfter taking a quick look at the menu, I briefly considered getting tostones since it's the dish that the restaurant is named after and obviously their specialty.  However, I ended up choosing a Steak Torta instead.  I had never heard of a \\"torta\\" before, but Daniel and other Yelpers told me that it's a Mexican sandwich.  It sounded like a safe choice, and the server assured me that there was no cilantro in it (YAY!!!).\\n\\nSince our group was large, there were several employees who served us.  We couldn't tell whether there was any particular order in which they follow to serve us, but it almost felt like they forgot Jerry T.'s Shrimp Tostones because it took quite a while for them to bring it out.\\n\\n* Steak Torta ($5.75) - This is a fairly good-sized sandwich, and I was glad I didn't order a side like fries with it because I was full after eating the entire thing.  If I recall correctly, the sandwich was really simply made with just lettuce and mayo along with the cubes of steak.  As expected, the steak was the best part of the sandwich, and it was delicious!  It was tender and has such a great flavor.  The bread was soft, fresh, and tasty, but it was a little too thick.  I guess that's to be expected of a torta.\\n\\nThere are various sauces available on the table for anyone who likes adding extra flavor to their food.  My favorite two sauces were the Tostones Sauce, which had a slight garlic flavor, and the Chipotle sauce, which had a tiny hint of spice.  I alternated between the two sauces as I took each bite.  Those who ordered tostones said that the fried plantain patties (basically what they are) were kind of dry and plain (if they weren't topped with sauce), so I pointed out my opinion that perhaps they're meant to eaten with the various sauces provided.\\n\\nOverall, Tostones Latin Cafe gets 4 stars for their affordable, fresh, and tasty Latin dishes.  Although I was a little confused that the server brought some people's checks to the table and didn't bring mine, everyone ended up walking up to the counter to pay at the cash register anyway, so it wasn't an issue.  I would definitely return and most likely would get another dish containing the steak because again, it was delicious!

Seeing the view for the first time, I said out loud, \\"What did I do to deserve this?\\" The service was a bit slow, but that's okay, because it gave us more time to enjoy the sunset. There is a house wine available by the glass that is excellent, a Merlot called Top of The Hub from California with ripe plum and chalky earth flavor profiles. I loved every bite of the gigantic burger. My date had fun stealing my seasoned french fries (think Arby's, but not curly) because she wanted to use the paper cone of ketchup, which was situated in a wire base.

I love the total openness of the front of the entrance, it's wide open, and because of this we decided to park ourselves right at the bar, instead of going any further into the restaurant. While we were there, one of the bartenders was squeezing fresh lemons, putting some arm work into it, while feeling the stinging of the citric juice sting his cuts (part of the hazardous job I guess!) but still creating conversation with us, asking if we have been there before. \\n\\nAnother one of the guys that was working behind the bar came out to assist, as now it wasn't just us sitting here, but 3 other women who pulled up for a drink while strolling by, and then we were presented some small menus, paper binded by a small piece of wood, on a grey backing, appropriate for this kind of place, Asian influenced from the decorations, the zen inspiring feel of the restaurant, and right to the menu of food and drinks, this place is nicely positioned, not far from old Chinatown, and on the tip of Gastown. Originally I had my eye on one of their mixed drinks: Charlie Chaplin... but just as I was about to order it, the bartender said... except that, blame the provincial gov't for supplies in apricot brandy (makes me want to try this drink more now!), and I let my dear go first, and she inquired about an easy, light drink for the day, the Fitzgerald was recommended. Since I couldn't get my drink, he said, \\"try the Zen Cha\\" so I went with his suggestions, and away we go!\\n\\nThey definitely know how to put on a mixing show, slamming and shaking the bar shakers together, making both my dear's, and my drink together at once. Watching this was quite interesting, and adds to the entertainment factor. The drinks arrived quite quickly, each looking pretty, mine with a mini flat slice of lime floating in the pool of liquor, and her's, deep pink in color, and a small flower bud to add some flair. When we put our lips to the drinks, these were solid, great tasting, bold, fruitful, fun. The bartenders are really engaging, talking to all that were sitting around, while doing their job of stocking the bar. The openness is cool too, as you see people walking buy, some even greeting the bartenders while going to their own work. While this was all happening I looked at everything that was the bar shelf, and liked the small little touches that made this place look the way it is. From the medicine jars, to the old Chinese tea pots and miniature wooden benches, they put the hip into this 'fusion' joint.\\n\\nWalking out, after paying for our bill, walking a block, my dear was commenting how the drink just snuck up on her. Kudos to the bartender on some good recommendations, a place I definitely will come back to for some drinks, maybe some food, and still wondering about the 'Gwei Lo' drink, made by 'Gwei Lo's' and also served by 'Gwei Lo's'.....

Feels good.\\n\\nThe outside and interior are very tastefully done.  It actually reminded me of Terracotta in Gastown, with Asian-themed pottery and paintings adorning the walls.\\n\\nThe server was very professional, and the staff all looked quite dressy.  I actually felt a bit underdressed, even with a collared shirt from the office.  You'd honestly think you were in a 4 star restaurant.\\n\\nThe presentation of the food is stunning.  It reminded me of the higher-end restaurants I hit up a few years back in HCMC, which by the way is where the owners are from.  I almost didn't want to touch my food as it simply looked too beautiful.\\n\\nUncle Hing's fried chicken ($6 for 8 or so) - several flavours available, but go for the tamarind.  Beautiful flavour.  Served with a slice of lemon, which adds that special kick.  If you love Phnom Penh wings, you will totally enjoy these ones.\\n\\nVietnamese crepe - generous chunks of seafood inside, and the vegetables are fresh.   You take the crepe and wrap it along with some other veggies using the lettuce.\\n\\nBeef ribs on rice - done just right.  Nice thin pieces, and the meat peels right off the bones.  Special mention for the salad that goes with the rice.  Cucumber slices arranged in a circular weave pattern, with tomato slices.  Other places would probably charge $15 for this salad alone.  Classiest Vietnamese salad I've ever had in my life.  There, I said it.\\n\\nLemongrass chicken on rice - chicken was a bit on the fatty side, but that was easily peeled off.   See salad comment (rave) above.\\n\\nHot and sour soup - served with bean spouts and basil.  Generous chunks of seafood, and the noodles were nice and firm.  The soup was a beautiful clear broth, with large slices of pineapple.

After all, there really isn't much to do when in Portland anyways, so why not binge on sugery fried dough!\\n\\nFood:  The variety of doughnuts is interesting and unique.  I really like how they had a mix of re-invented classics and some unequal ones.  I picked up Voodoo Dolls, Portland Creams, and a few Bacon Maple Bars.  The taste combinations of each were good, but way overly sugary and sweet.  The Voodoo Dolls are your basic bar doughnut with chocolate icing and raspberry filling.  The filling was too sweet and I ended up squeezing out about half of it to make it more palatable.  The Portland Cream had more of a sugary icing filling (I was expecting more of a custard, pastry-cream type of filling) that was also too sweet.  After a few bites of it, I squeezed just about all the cream out of it.  The Bacon Maple Bar has potential with some tweaking.  The doughnut itself was good, the maple icing was too sweet, and the bacon was not \\"bacony\\" or salty enough.  There just was not that strong sweet and salty contrast I was expecting.  The gimmick of the different types of doughnuts is fun, but the regular donuts you find at Krispy Kream or at any regular coffee shop would probably be more palatable.\\n\\nPrice:  Overpriced considering its doughnuts, but you are paying for the novelty of it.  I bought 9 doughnuts and paid about $20 for them.  The price is reasonable if you are a onetime visitor who is into the gimmick and novelty of the strange and unique doughnut combinations, the definitely too expensive for your daily \\"doughnut and coffee\\" breakfast.\\n\\nAtmosphere:  Super touristy, but fun.  I went on a cold, rainy afternoon midweek and the line was out the door.  Once you got inside, the pink walls are covered with voodoo-related posters and other touristy looking things.  There is a huge menu board up front, and two turn table displays that have donuts displayed on them.  The glass turn table units look very dirty and disgusting (I hope they don't actually serve the doughnuts that are in them.)  The glass was covered with all sorts of different substances, as if it has not been cleaned in quick awhile.  Since this is one of the first things you see when you walk it, Voodoo Doughnuts should take more care of keeping it clean.\\n\\nStaff:  Pretty basic staff with not much personality or friendliness.  Yes, they were covered with tattoos and piercings, but looking physically interesting does not make up for the lack of a simple smile.  The cashier by the door was constantly yelling at people to keep the front door closed.  When it was my turn to order, I was greeted with a \\"what do you want?\\"  Being cheery as I am, I smiled and said hello to the cashier, which normally invokes a smile in return, but that didn't happen this time.  The cashier was accommodating though when I requested to have all my doughnuts placed in a smaller box (I'm traveling and don't have the room to carry the bigger box around.)  She did warn me that the doughnuts will get smashed a bit, but I said that was fine.  She did look like she took some care putting them in the box to minimize smashing.\\n\\nOver all, it was an experience visiting Voodoo.  As a first timer to Portland, it is definitely a place to visit just to say you have been there.  If the lines were not too long, and the doughnuts where not so sweet I might visit it again (but only if I am really craving a doughnut.)  If I return to Portland I would probably not go out of my way to visit Voodoo again, but definitely a spot to visit as a first timer."},{"name":"Via 313 Pizza - West 6th","address":"600 W 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"We had the pizza for the first time and it was really good.

It was also delivered to me just warm. \\n\\nIf a pizza is really excellent, you can eat it at room temperature or even cold and it will still be good.  This needed to be piping hot and fresher.  At that price point, I think they did an average job but I'd rather they charged a little more and improved their technique.\\n\\nThere are several salad options, a number of sandwiches and a few kinds of pizza by the pie or by the slice.\\n\\nService is hit or miss.  It's unclear though, who's running the show in there which is a bit of an issue.   During the last visit I overheard two different people complaining that their orders were not complete.\\nNo one is particularly welcoming either and when I feel no enthusiasm from staff, wherever that may be, I end up wondering why I'm bothering.\\n\\nThere are a few spots where you can sit down to eat, but as with many other Cambridge St. establishments, it's best to think of this as take-out.\\n\\nI do believe I've had my fill of The Federal.

All the martinis have been good. They also have a black bean burger for $11. It's available for the build your own burger. They have a happy hour from 3 to 6.

They don't use much oil on anything as we stood in line and observed how they cooked certain things....\\n\\nTheir fried eggs did brown a little, and I'm sure many people wouldn't like that but it seemed like their style of cooking an over-easy or sunny-side up egg.. so let them know you don't want it to brown. \\n\\nDON'T be worried about not finding a table. The time you are on the line, a table WILL open up. \\n\\nThey had greaaat coffee as well... it was ground on the spot i believe and had a great colombian or spanish-style taste.  I added a bit of hazlenut (as I do everywhere) and that was a nice touch with their strong spanish-tasting bean by making it mild). \\n\\nOne thing is the women at the cash register could have been a little bit more patient with my water request.

It comes with a brown mustard relish which didn't add any flavor to it. The best part was honestly the bread! It was buttered, perfectly toasted, and delicious! For $13 - I guess these hot dogs were worth it. I love kobe beef though, and this could have been made out of pork and we would be none the wiser. Which was disappointing. I got the romaine wedge salad which was fine, then the ricotta purses with an amazing cheese sauce and pruscuitto. The dessert was a carrot cake obviously out of the freezer. Nothing special, and too many spices that overpowered it all. He got the mac and cheese specialty - and it was anything but. The cheese sauce was runny and it felt like it was noodles in soup!

They also have a reasonable assortment of appetizers, the most notable of which are the cheezy poofs, which are essentially fried pimento cheese sticks. The one really novel item that they have here is the alcoholic milkshakes, which are extremely tasty. My favorite is the monkey wrench, which is comprised of vanilla ice cream, peanut butter, banana liqueur, and Bacardi.\\n\\nService: The servers aren't exceptionally outstanding here; however, there are usually more than enough of them, which makes for a short wait. A different staff member normally delivers the food, so having your order inadvertently delivered to another table is not an uncommon occurrence.\\n\\nAtmosphere: This newest incarnation of Grindhouse is in a converted gas station.

At the end of the meal I told the waiter that the bamboo was way too salty and she told me she would talk to the kitchen.

(I should, however, echo sentiments in a previous review.  Booooo foie gras.)  I had a veggie dog with onions and a side of house made sauce, which was gratifying for about $4.00.  A basic dog runs an acceptable $3, and though the drinks are generally too pricey, they do serve $2 Pearls.  Again, if you're feeling overzealous, go for some home-made bacon-infused Maker's Mark.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is that of a warehouse renovated with modern touches.

The decor was modest and comfortable, the service was excellent and the food was delish.  \\n\\nMy husband and I ordered a cup of soup (small $6.50), a salad ($13.95), and two dinner entrees.  We always share so we get to sample lots of things.  I was a bit worried that we had ordered too much food - especially with the $13.95 salad, but we comfortably finished it all with room to split a vegan chocolate cupcake and an espresso.  \\n\\nWhat I'm trying to tell you is that the helpings are not as grand as the price.  And the taste is tasty.\\n\\nThe cup of soup (sweet potato - ginger) was absolutely tantalizing.  Paired with the homemade bread they brought out, we were off to a fantastic start.  I felt $6.95 was a bit too steep for a cup of soup.  You could also try to justify it by saying the free basket of bread isn't really free?  I make kick ass soup at home all the time with freshly prepared organic ingredients and I would be hard pressed to find enough ingredients to kick the cost up to anything close to $6.95.  Gold flakes maybe?\\n\\nNext we had a fennel, apple, carrot salad with cheese (Chevre?) stuffed baby peppers and grapefruit slices.   It was wonderful and I appreciated the flavor combining as well as the effort it took to prepare!  However, seemed a bit small for $13.95.\\n\\nFinally, our entrees: millet cakes with arugula pesto atop grilled zucchini (fabulous), and eggplant slices stuffed with a wonderfully marinated tofu.\\n\\nI thought both of our entrees were delicious and in in my estimation not overpriced. My dining partner and I both agreed that we were glad we were sharing two entrees - eating the whole serving of one entree may not have been as satisfying as eating a half portion of two different entrees.\\n\\nOur service was excellent.  We had early reservations (6:30 p.m. on Friday) which probably helped.  We were seated at the \\"bar\\" and were attended to by two different servers.  They were both pleasant, informative and responsive with requests.  Our food arrived very quickly and our green-tea glasses were refilled without asking.  :)\\n\\nI'm really picky - I come from Asheville, land of locally grown organic food, prepared with love, gourmet-style, and served at a reasonable prices in artful environments.  Pretty much every restaurant in Asheville (veg or not) caters to vegetarians.  I am spoiled.  I may have gone to 5 stars if the ambiance was a bit warmer/more inviting and the pricing more reasonable.

I have tried chicken lo-mein, sesame chicken, honey cashew chicken and tasted my friend's spicy garlic beef - all ok, but no standouts... if I had to choose one, I'd pick sesame chicken as the one to try here as the light batter coating and thick brown sauce are quite unique.  Cost ($9-11/dish) of their dishes are comparable to General Tso's with General Tso's being a little more of a typical greasy chinese takeout place if that makes sense...

If they spruced up their interiors, (redo the flooring, a simple paint job and some simple decorative upgrades) it could be a welcome place to sit down too!

It was not crowded so we were seated immediately but maybe if the word gets out that will change.  There's a bloody mary bar which is kind of fun.  The best thing was that the menu included lunch options like burgers and sandwiches, because not everyone in the party may feel like breakfast food by the time you roll around to a restaurant.    \\n\\nNo, wait, I take that back.  The best thing is the Anson Mills grits with a crispy onions piled up on top.  \\n\\nI've also been for dinner and what I like is that even though steaks are the main thing here (and there are some prime options), unlike most steakhouses, there is a lot of attention to non-steak entrees as well, pork chops, lamb chops, roast chicken, and a lot of seafood choices.  The sides seem to be seasonal (and yes, the grits are available at dinner also!)  All our steaks were cooked to order, and everything was beautifully presented.  \\n\\nI might not bring a vegetarian here, although they could probably put a meal together with the sides.  It's certainly the kind of place where you could call ahead and ask about an omelette or other vegetarian customizations.    \\n\\nThe service was very professional--at first we were seated next to a big party with a lot of small children so we asked to move to a quieter table, and the server took care of that very discreetly.  \\n\\nThe decor reminds me a little of the 80's with a lot of black and leather which I do find a little bit cold, and I am definitely NOT a fan of the classic rock they play, I mean it's fine in my car when I'm running around doing my Saturday errands but not special enough for an upscale restaurant.  \\n\\nI would definitely go back for a special occasion because it is on the expensive side, but if you want the benefit of the great cooking for less money, definitely go for brunch."},{"name":"Ganko Ittetsu Ramen","address":"318 Harvard St, Unit 3","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"Really enjoyed my experience at Ganko.

I liked that we actually were promptly seated upon arrival (we had a reservation).  I did not like the location or positioning of our table at all.  We were stuffed into a corner table right by the door to the patio where everyone going out to the patio would have to pass us.  It felt very cramped.  One side of the table was booth seating, which was fine, but on the other side it was bench seating (no chair back) which is pretty uncomfortable for an entire dinner.  It's also not great if you're wearing a shirt that may expose a little (or a lot of) skin when you sit down and you don't want it exposed to everyone sitting around you.  It was very dark in our corner, and in the whole restaurant, which might have provided for an intimate ambiance if it were not extremely loud in the restaurant.  But, the restaurant does look very nice from the inside.\\n\\nOur server came to greet us fairly soon after we sat down and took our drink orders after giving us the spiel about the big barrels of wine made just for them, which was pretty much lost on me because I could barely hear him over the noise.  Anyway, I ordered my wine and it came out in a cute little mini-carafe and this was pleasing to me.  We then ordered appetizers and entrees.  My friend had the rocket salad which was actually very good (I love arugula).  We all shared the cheese plate which was good except that I was expecting soft lavash with it and not crispy lavash but it was still OK.  The fried calamari was very good.\\n\\nOur entrees were served next, very quickly after we had received our appetizers.  When they were served, we had not yet finished even a third of the cheese plate yet the server just picked up the cheese plate to take it away.  We had to catch him and ask him to leave the cheese and he seemed a bit put out but we really had a lot of cheese left (and it was good).  I wish he would have asked us if we were finished before trying to take it away.\\n\\nMy entree was the chicken and it was pretty boring.  The side dish was even less remarkable and I cannot even remember what it was.  The chicken was a mess and was hard to eat and I finally decided it was not worth the trouble and just ate the cheese from the cheese plate.  My friend had scallops and I think she enjoyed them, along with her Gouda cheese grits.  My other friend had the flank steak which was just mediocre.\\n\\nWhen we left, we stopped by the bar area to just check it out.  It was very crowded but it looked like people were having a fun time.  There was one middle-aged couple completely and inappropriately making out at a table, which was actually very amusing in a train wreck sort of way.\\n\\nI might come back here but it's not high on my list.

I always like cheese bread but this was the best cheese bread I've ever had. Unfortunately I made the mistake of assuming they would give you a side of marinara for it [like everywhere else that has cheese bread] but they don't and you have to pay extra $1.79 for it, which I found odd but whatever, we decided to eat it without sauce because it was quite delicious.\\n\\nAfter waiting a bit too long for our Entree's [took about 20 minutes to get our food AFTER we got our appetizer] they finally came out and looked and smelled delicious.\\n\\nI have very little complaints about my dish.  I got the Chicken Vino Bianco. The chicken was cooked perfectly and the sauce on the chicken was great!  The fettuccine alfredo it comes with was lacking.  The fettuccine was cooked well but that was the BLANDEST alfredo I've had in awhile.  Alfredo is a relatively strong sauce, but this was very weak and I could barely taste it.   It honestly tasted like it was out of a jar.   Other than that, my dish was great.  Oh and the mushrooms were amazing! Some of the best tasting mushrooms I've had in a very long time.\\n\\nMy bf was a little less thrilled with his Tortellini Carbonara.  He commented that the noodles came out 3 different colors....anytime you get various colored noodles it's a pretty safe bet that the noodles are right out of a bag. This doesn't bother me but he wasn't too thrilled by it.\\n\\nThe pruscetta that comes with the Carbonara was a bit lacking in flavor, thankfully he got chicken added to it.\\n\\nThe decor and ambiance of the place feels like it's trying too hard.  I wish they would lighten the place up and treat it less like an \\"expensive\\" dining experience and more like the cafe that they are.\\n\\nThe vast array of Frank Sinatra songs were a little tedius and cliche, but I won't score them on that, as it's personally preference, it's just so annoying lol.\\n\\nOverall the place was \\"ok\\".  The prices were alright, though I was a little surprised to see that they charged $4 bucks for the small amount of chicken they added to the Carbonara dish.\\n\\nThe menu options are pretty good, but the food quality was lacking.\\n\\nI plan on reviewing the place again after I have tried one of their pizza's.

Do be prepared, however, to wait about 15-20 minutes for food; everything is fried fresh not a second before you order it so it takes a bit longer than just a few minutes.

It wasn't a big deal, I understand that some food orders were coming out already and it seems to only be 3 people serving a party of 20+. So I'm not going to count off on that on service. They did their best, very accommodating, separated checks  like a champ. \\n\\nAs for the food: I'd give it above average based on the selection and different choices that it had. Some items I've never seen before so I was really tempted to try what I didn't know. But one thing for sure, their menu can do a better job at describing what certain items are. The front menu did a decent jobs describing the hot dogs but on the backside, you're left guessing what it could be. \\n\\nI had a pit bull dog - hotdog topped with crushed potato chips, pineapple sauce, testones sauce, and 2 quail eggs. Very different, I would never have expected quail eggs on my hot dogs, so that was an experience. The flavor isn't as odd as you would think it is. The testones sauce seems to be of just basic mayo with a slight sweet kick to it. As odd as the name is, the flavor isn't adventurous at all. Unless you don't like quail eggs.  \\n\\nA friend had a cuban sandwich, which is a safe choice when going to a new restaurant. Nothing too special about it, nice and large portions and also hot and crunchy bread which gave it nice texture. I'm not used to a cuban that looked more than a panini but this works for them. \\n\\nOverall, not a bad restaurant to try out if you're around.  I didn't get a chance to sample EVERYTHING on the menu, but it left enough obscurity for me to possibly venture back into it to try some more."},{"name":"Domino's Pizza- Bee Cave","address":"15500 W Hwy 71","city":"Bee Cave","stars":"3","text":"Good for pick up maybe not so much for delivery.

I had never been to Top of the Hub so I was super excited. I have never been more annoyed at a restaurant than before. I am a pretty nice person, and it takes a lot to piss me off. Well, the waiters here accomplished just that. Congratulations for achieving the unthinkable. I felt as if they were trying rush us out the whole time, because we were eating the cheaper restaurant week menu. \\n\\nFirst, we sat down. Then the fire alarm went off for some time. That wasn't their fault, fine. \\nThen, the waiter comes out with bread. I was happily picking the kind of bread I wanted, while my first course appeared! You are not supposed to bring out the food that quickly. Let the guests enjoy their bread first. We chose to do wine pairing with each of our dishes, and the food came out so quickly, even before our wine was served to us. \\n\\nWe finished our appetizers pretty quickly, then within 10 minutes, our main course was served to us. What is going on? Clearly the food must have been pre-cooked and they just wanted to serve it to us as quickly as possible. I was shocked. I looked around me. People who had been there earlier than us were still enjoying their appetizers, while we were being rushed. At this rate, we would be in and out of the restaurant in less than an hour. I came here to enjoy the food and most importantly the view! I did not come here to experience a fast food res truant. There was another waiter that kept coming to check if we had finished our food. I still had a bit of food left and he asked if he could clear my plate. I said no. He almost seemed to expect me to eat the last bite so he could take my plate right then and there. He came back again 30 seconds later, to check if I had taken the last bite. The couple next to us had been served their main course way earlier than us, and they weren't being rushed to finish their food. \\nOf course, once we were done with our main course, our desert was served to us about 7 min later. Yeah, we were totally on track to being done within an hour. While I was eating my desert, the annoying waiters kept checking to see if we were done with our food. What is this? Did you overbook the table? Are you trying to kick me out because I ordered the restaurant week menu?\\n\\nThe food was actually pretty good, especially the short rib. Its too bad that the restaurant week items are not on the normal menu, so I didn't actually get to try their usual food. However, the whole experience was so bad. How on earth do you annoy your customers so much? Don't bring out the food so quickly, before I have even selected my bread. Don't bring out the food before you serve wine. A dining experience should be enjoyable and relaxing. But I felt so stressed out because someone was constantly checking if I had finished my food. \\n\\nFYI there is an observation deck on the 50th floor but it closes at 7pm I think. We wanted to go after dinner but they told us it was closed, so oh well.

The dough had a slightest touch of savory saltiness, but there wasn't any negative effect keeping me eating the second samosa.  The sweet chutney made the saltiness more of a balanced taste of both opposite taste of thr pallet. I'd definitely reorder the vege samosa.

The food came out quick but we were not given any silverware, the waiting continued.  While eating I was sprayed in the back by the bar tender seemingly learning how to use the tools of the trade.   After finally getting our utensils and finishing the meal, we again had to wait to pay.   Finally another waitress noticing my annoyance took our bill and gave it to our waiter.  When I got the bill back, I was charged for more than my bill indicated.  I brought it to the attention of the manager and he told me my waiter forgot to charge me for a beer I had.  At this point I was a bit upset and told the manager, about my lack luster Frank experience.  He walked away from the table letting me stew in my discontent.  I was now really upset.  I feel although the manager should have corrected the amount of the bill to the to the  amount I was originally given and then explained what happened.  If that had been done, I may have added the difference to the tip.  I understand mistakes happen, but this wasn't my fault.  I wrote a small message on the bill regarding how I feel the error should have been handled and tipped the waiter 10% on the bill.  While I was writing the note the manager returned to my table offering a gift card, but the damage had already been done.  I told him I was not interested in the gift card because I wasn't planning of giving my business to Frank.  The manager proceeded to follow me to the door with a piss poor argumentative attitude.  I was simply shocked.  Frank owners, I have to say, if this is the type of management you hire, I'm not surprised your service is so poor.

It is assuredly a relic, from a time before McFood and interstate highways. The place reminds me of one of those little burger joints that you found at the side of a state highway that served as a good landmark and a good stopping place on a longer journey, and for good reason: that's how the Steakburger grew up, in a time before I-5 when Highway 99 was the main route to Seattle.\\n\\nThe burgers are pretty good, I thought, and the bag of onion rings was ridiculously large and, from what I'm told by my partner, good. There are no value meals here - you order your sandwich, your side, and your drink. It is a little bit more expensive than a McMeal might be, but it's worth it, in my opinion, to eat someplace that is locally-owned and different than most places that we find in our daily grind.\\n\\nIt's not fast food, I suppose, but it was quick enough, and the woman at the counter was pleasant -- even reminding us that credit was cheaper than debit (which costs 50 cents). Most people these days, I've found, would just run the debit card and charge the fee without asking. It's true that the food wasn't five-star-dining quality -- this is not a foodie haven -- but it sure seemed more real than other quick options nearby.\\n\\nWe sat outside on a little patio overlooking Golf-o-Rama, the mini golf place co-located with the Steakburger. You could tell that this place gets a lot of TLC from the owners -- cute little planter boxes and immaculate landscaping on the golf course, and it was spic-and-span clean. Before the arrival of the freeway, this would have been a very pleasant respite from a long day's drive to or from Seattle, and even today, it's more pleasant than a drive-thru despite the highway noise in the background.\\n\\nAll in all, it's a decent burger, a decent atmosphere, and decently quick... perhaps a bit more expensive than the chains, but well worth it to eat someplace that is assuredly more \\"real\\" than the McChains. It might not become a weekly tradition to pack up the family and come to the Steakburger, but when you're in the area and need something fairly quick, it's a good option."},{"name":"Santouka Harvard Square","address":"1 Bow St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Never had ramen before this was the first time, food was pretty good something new to try, the regular sized bowls comes with plenty of noodles so don't be fooled.

You decide.  This was one of the best meals I had this year, so far.  I started with a margarita that was as fresh and tart/sweet as any I have had.  It was perfectly balanced, and I was ambivalent about which part of the sweet/salty combo I liked best.\\n\\nWe had a couple glasses of port during the finale that they comp'd us.  We also had an amuse bouche at the beginning of the meal that was incredible that was comp'd, but the two pitchers of house made Sangria firmly drove what it was, precisely, out of my head.\\n\\nWe started with a couple miniplates:\\n\\nENSALADA VERDE PERUANA fresh greens topped with hearts of palm and seasonal vegetables.  This was generous, lively and fresh, and simply perfectly balanced with dressing and additions.\\n\\nTORTILLA DE PATATA Y ALIOLI DE AJI AMARILLO Spanish-style potato fritatta with aj√≠ Amarillo aioli.  This was so so, found it a bit heavy for the app portion, but it was delicious nonetheless.\\n\\nThe JAM√ìN SERRANO plate of Serrano ham, aged 12 months (Casa Redondo Iglesias) was one of the finest cuts of ham I have ever had.  Hands down.  Why did I fail this night? This was some of the leftovers I staggered away from as we ambled back to our hotel.  That... was a tragedy.\\n\\nBeing at a restaurant famous for Ceviche, we knew we had to wander there and shared the MANGO VERDE Y LANGOSTINOS green mango, passionfruit, and prawns which was delicious, if not too sweet for my tastes.  While that combination was quite good, the TUNA NIKKEI tuna, aj√≠ Amarillo, soy, pickeld ginger, and Japanese cucumber was truly the best ceviche I have ever had (I used to run a lounge that served a couple, to boot.. and I have made them myself among having authentic and fine dining versions all over the place).  The Tuna was ... surreal.  The acids cooking it seared it perfectly, and it danced on my tongue.\\n\\nWe also had the PULPO A LA OLIVA tender octopus slices cupped in fresh endives with with Botija olive sauce.  This was fantastic, and probably some of the fresher octopus I have had... where it was almost al dente, and gamey... rather than rubbery and tough.  It was seasoned perfectly, but not enough to oust the flavours of the octopus.  This was surprising to me, as I am not typically a fan.\\n\\nAlbeit wantonly full, we couldn't pass up trying the authentic handmade truffles w/Peruvian flavors.  We got the CUSCO - yellow hot pepper, spiced citrus peel & CAPULI - dark chocolate ganache infused with anise.

They also did away with their bourbon pecan pie, which was our favorite.\\n\\nI'm told they did it because people complained about not being able to choose their meats, and because they offered the platters too cheaply.\\n\\nI was also told that many other customers were just as unhappy as we were about the changes.\\n\\nMy advice?  Bring the platters back, bump the prices up on them.

Not one penny was spared in building this place, it's truly impressive and you may find yourself gawking at some of the incredible decor. Chef Mario Capone (formerly of Scampo in Boston) was picked up as the executive chef for this new venture in Burlington.  The menu has that edge and creativity that is missing from the other steak places in the area.  \\n\\nIt's the little things that set Bancroft apart and make it that 5 star experience as a whole.  While the steaks are very good, you can get a very good steak at a lot of places (especially at this price). \\n\\nFirst impressions mean a lot and while the decor will surely amaze you, the drinks and house rolls are just as impressive.  They put a huge emphasis on developing their cocktail program at The Bancroft and it shows.  Hub punch is made and bottled by Privateer rum in Ipswich.  This drink is specifically made for this restaurant.  It comes to you in a flask which fills almost 2 glasses.  It's deliciously fruity but packs a strong enough punch so someone won't question your manhood while drinking it.  The cucumber vodka cocktail is light and refreshing, as the cucumber flavor shines through.  The house rolls are killer.  Flaky and airy with nice cracked sea salt for some added flavor.  Butter isn't needed, but it's there. Dishes are well thought out from the presentation to flavor combinations.  We really enjoyed the beet salad with different colored and flavored beets with a nice soft whipped cheese.  The side of mushrooms were delicious and well seasoned (the small size for 7$ is enough for 2 people). The main attraction, the steaks, did not disappoint.  The skirt steak (29$) paired really well with the charred avocado on top.  This was a good quality steak and came with a tasty side of grits.  The aged rib eye (44$) was a massive 14 oz cooked perfectly medium - bright pink throughout.  The quality was great, the steak was juicy and tender.  There was a nice char on the steak that added flavor to it.  A small part of the steak was charred too much and had a nasty burnt flavor. The Bearnaise sauce was my favorite (as it usually is), while the bancroft steak sauce was a decent alternative (a less tangy version of A1) but I will stick to my bearnaise.  Dessert was just as great as everything else, the chocolate four ways had a great chocolate torte (cake), rich and dense, it paired really well with the smooth cocoa nib ice cream on the side.  Even though I was beyond stuffed I couldn't stop eating the dessert (always a great sign).  \\n\\nWhile the steaks themselves don't set The Bancroft apart from the competition nearby, everything else does.  From the rest of the food to the cocktails to the swanky setting, this is a great establishment.

They also have tables outside however when it's cold and/or rainy outside, very few people generally want to sit out there. \\n\\nI've tried multiple items on the menu and my favorite is definitely the JINYA Chicken Ramen.

During my last visit, I got extra chicken on the side (I'm trying to increase my protein intake) however I not think I'll do that again as the extra chicken was somewhat cold and dry.\\n\\nI don't like spicy food (it hurts my tummy) but did try the Mild Spicy Chicken Ramen once but did not like it as much as the Jinya Chicken Ramen. I think it's because it didn't include the fried onions and I just liked the overall flavor of the non-spicy version. \\n\\nThe Spicy Creamy Shrimp Tempura is delicious! There are about 6-8 pieces of battered and fried shrimp covered in a spicy creamy sauce. \\n\\nThe Takoyaki or the \\"Octopus Balls\\" were not my cup of tea. \\n\\nNow my absolute favorite item on the menu that is not Ramen is the Tokyo Curry Bowl. It is ground chicken in a curry sauce over rice and it is so so flavorful! I've never gotten my own order of this but always try a bite when my friend gets it. I always want ramen when I go to Jinya and never have room for my own order of this dish. If you're not a Ramen person, this dish is a good alternative for dinner. \\n\\nOverall, Jinya has great food and good service.

Maybe it's just something you have to get used to. \\n\\nOf course, for the first time in the history of eating, I didn't know what the hell I felt like having but the pressure was on to make a decision.

Lots of happy faces and lots of talking. \\n\\nBecause this was our first trip to Hair of the Dog, we each ordered the Walk the Dog Tasting Flight (four beers, 3oz each, $8.00), which consisted of Ruth (American Pale Ale, organic pilsner, and hops), Blue Dot (Double India Pale Ale), Fred (Golden Strong Ale), and Adam (Dark, rick smoky taste). We were supposed to have Lila (Maibock, Lager), but they ran out. They each came out in small, almost wine-like glasses.\\n\\nThey have a fairly substantial drink selection; I really enjoyed the fact that they served vintage beer (i.e. Fred from a 2003 batch). That's quite unique and definitely gives the place a bit of a competitive advantage. Of course, those beers are more expensive (they can run around $9-$10 a glass). \\n\\nI was a huge fan of Ruth and Fred. Ruth was refreshing, perfect for a summer day.

Despite their rather unfortunate placement, they manage to create a friendly ambiance for their customers.\\n\\nSit outdoors on their mini-patio in comfortable weather, or inside for window-gazing. Parking here is tough, and the one thing that truly annoys me about Thai Noodles House is the arrangement of their parking lot in relation to the building (here we go again with the randomness). You have to drive straight toward the restaurant's big-windowed dining room before veering left to park. In the evenings, patrons occasionally are blinded by headlights, miss their mouth, and walk out with brown sauce stains on their t-shirts.

I've learned to go around 3:30pm on weekends and around 3:00pm weekdays to avoid the crowd. However, you can always order take-out to eat in the Boston Common or along the Charles River. If it's your first time, the seating can get confusing. The rule is you have to order your food (cafeteria style), pay, and get your food before grabbing a table. The establishment seats less than forty people, but servers do quick table clean ups and regulate the seating so a table is always open up by the time your order is ready. The chefs are friendly, they work fast, and they cook everything just right (you won't find any burnt pancakes or undercooked eggs here).\\n\\nFood: 4/5 One of the reasons this is the best hangover breakfast spot is that everything on the breakfast menu is served until 4:30 p.m. I always respect a place that allows you to sleep until 3:00 p.m. and still satisfy a scrambled eggs, bacon, and french toast craving. The lunch menu, which is also served until 4:30 p.m., is a great alternative for those who prefer not to eat breakfast past noon. Whether you're a local or visitor, if you like classic American breakfast foods like eggs, waffles, and french toast you will like Paramount. Honestly, I don't go for the dinner because you just can't top their breakfast. I personally dislike the hand cut sweet potato fries, but the home fries, omelets, blueberry buttermilk pancakes, grilled sandwiches, and homemade black bean burgers with tomato salsa are phenomenal. Paramount offers fresh squeezed juice, coffee, hot cocoa, unsweetened iced tea, and milkshakes.\\n\\nAtmosphere: 5/5 The Paramount, which has been on Charles Street since 1937, evokes the history of the picturesque Beacon Hill. Gas-lit streets, window boxes filled with bright floral arrangements, and brick sidewalks set the mood for a comforting meal. The open kitchen evokes that casual diner feel while the brick walls, stainless steel appliances, and luxuriously heavy curtains entertain a more sophisticated energy. Overall, it's quite charming.\\n\\nPrice: 5/5 The portions are large and the prices are moderate. You can get a simple egg and cheese sandwich for $4.00, or splurge on a grilled reuben for $8.50. Nothing on the breakfast or lunch menu costs more than $11.00, which is excellent considering the inflated prices in the Beacon Hill area. And you can't beat the breakfast special: two eggs (any style), toast, home fries, and coffee for $6.00. If you're not a coffee drinker, feel free to substitute hot or iced tea.\\n\\nAccessibility: 4.5/5 Parking meters line Charles Street and there are a few Beacon Hill visitor parking spaces nearby, but the spots fill up on weekends. If you don't have a car, take the subway to Charles/MGH Station (red line), then walk 0.6 miles (about 12 minutes). Or you could get off at Park St. (red line, green line), then walk 0.5 miles (about 10 minutes). Another option is to get off at Boylston St. (green line), then walk 0.5 miles (approximately 10 minutes). If you are within walking distance from Charles Street, I highly recommend taking a stroll. The area is just as safe and clean as it is enchanting.\\n\\nRecommendations:\\n\\n-Black Bean Burger {tomato salsa on a toasted whole wheat roll, served with your choice of sweet potato fries or regular fries}\\n\\n-Western Omelette {ham, onion, pepper, and cheese served with home fries and toast}\\n\\n-Texas Style Whole Grain French Toast\\n\\n-Blueberry Pancakes {you can request real Vermont maple syrup for an extra $2.00 or \\"fruit on top\\" for an additional $2.00}\\n\\n-Breakfast Special {two eggs any style, toast, home fries, coffee}\\n\\n-Fruit Bowl {fresh, seasonal fruit}\\n\\n-Fresh Squeezed Orange or Carrot Juice"},{"name":"Poor Calvin's","address":"510 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Really on the fence for this place, maybe it was because my expectations were a bit too high.

Once that was figured out we ordered two pizzas which I thought was pretty easy order, we were told it would take only 10-15 minutes which was great because we were in a little bit of a rush after waiting in line for a while since they only had one register open. 10 minutes later we were given our first pizza and told our second one would be right out. I then watched them throw our second pizza away, clearly something was wrong with how it came out of the oven, but I have no idea what it was. 5 minutes later I ask the same girl who gave us the first pizza what is going on and she says it will be just a couple more minutes. 10 more minutes we are finally given our 2nd pizza (15 minutes after we are given our first), no explanation as to what went on. The 1st pizza is already getting cold. I ask for napkins and am told to go to the other side of the restaurant, at this point I was too annoyed and just left (there were napkins right next to her, apparently those are different napkins?).

I will go back and make sure I tell them to only use one bottle of oil instead of two. From reading the other reviews it seems others have had the same issues.

After days of yelp-ing and obtaining friends opinions, Valerie and Eric decided on Cafe 47.\\n\\nCafe 47 is in one of the most convenient locations for getting a group together. Its about two blocks from the Hynes Station, and those coming from the E-line or Cambridge areas can just hope the #1 bus. Location = wonderful-ness. \\n\\nOur good experience with Cafe 47 began the day before when Valerie called to make reservations.  The woman who she talked to on the phone (didn't catch her name) was more than nice.  She seemed genuinely excited to book a reservation for a party of 13, unlike most places which would find this to be a hassle (especially places as small as Cafe 47).  She also asked if it was a special occasion (which of course it was) and worked with Valerie to make all of the preparations for a large party.\\n\\nNow on to the actual event.  We get there and wait outside for stragglers, not realizing that Brandon is already inside and a few people couldn't make it. We waited for a while, and walked inside to meet the waitress/hostess Erica, who told us that our timing was perfect because our group as it was would fit perfectly until they cleared the other table needed to accommodate the whole party. We sat down and waited about ten minutes for drinks and whatnot, mostly because the staff was busy trying to prep the other table for us. Eric and the other guys involved stuck with beer, and the ladies sampled some of the mixed beverages, such as the delicious \\"47 Sangria\\" and Valerie's Mass. Ave. Mojito, which was cleverly served in a wine glass and had a wonderful \\"zip to it!\\" as described by both Valerie and our great friend Sarah W.  The drinks were all very reasonably priced.  The sangria and mojito were both $8 but were served in large glasses.  Beers were $4 each which is phenomenal in the city. \\n\\nOnce Katie, B, Val, Eric, Burns, Sarah, Jeremy, Greg and Jen (they all requested shout-outs) had settled in, they decided that they had waited long enough for Sam and Pat and began to order. It seemed as though we had a good sample of the menu. Eric had the tortellini with pesto, which was amazing, but a slice of garlic bread or something with it would have been even more amazing (okay, now we're just being snooty). Valerie and Greg had the angus burger, and Valerie had the mix of regular and sweet potato fries. The burger was cooked perfectly and the despite Valerie's craving for the traditional french fry, she actually enjoyed the sweet potato fries more. Brandon had some type of salad with chicken on it that looked and smelled great, and Sam got the Eggplant Rollatini which was good, while Pat ordered the fried calamari which smelled delicious and looked perfectly cooked. Valerie, the avid fish hater, even said that Pat's dish smelled good.  Jen, Sarah and Jeremey's pizzas were all perfectly cooked and delicious. Burns and Katie got a pasta dish with chicken sprinkled in and marinara on top. Burns commented that, \\"it was a little expensive for what it was, I could've made that in my kitchen for a lot cheaper,\\" but overall we were impressed with the food.\\n\\nThe best part happened about a half hour (and another drink) after the dinner. Valerie had arranged for cupcakes from Sweet, a pastry shop next door, to be delivered to the table, and they were a huge hit. The entire restaurant participated in singing happy birthday to Eric, and seemed impressed with the tower of cupcakes that arrived with a candle in the cupcake on top. Eric had a chocolate cupcake with some type of berry filling that was amazing, and also sampled some type of pumpkin/gingerbread deliciousness. Valerie had the red velvet cupcake and the frosting was to die for (she even started stealing frosting off the cupcakes that were left on the tower).  Everyone else seemed to enjoy their selections, and they were quickly devoured.\\n\\nThe staff was phenomenal the entire time, stopping by to check in often, and doing the little things like being consistent in refilling waters and offering to split the check eleven or so ways. Erica also made sure to wish Eric happy birthday no less than five times, and we ended up inviting her to join us later!  Cafe 47 had  a great feel to it.  It was small, but in a cozy way, and really felt like a neighborhood establishment.  Eric liked their lighting.  There were a few TVs that had  the Celtics game on, but they were well placed so that you could keep an eye on the score without it distracting you from your food and good company.\\n\\nIn short...we will be returning with less than 11 people next time because their food was so good, but it's great for groups too :)"},{"name":"Pescatore","address":"158 Boston Ave","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"What a find!

Yucca fries- I've heard of yucca and kind of expected it to be like taro, a little sweet but its pretty much like a softer starcher potato that has kind of a little buttery taste. They're pretty thick and I believe battered and salted, cooked perfectly and good flavor. Taste great with that mild sauce.\\n\\n3. Fried plantains- great accompaniment to the chicken.

But their coffee?  Meh.  A lot depends on whether they just made a fresh pot before you order.  \\n\\nAnd, there are also lots of places in Austin that have great coffee - Pacha, Thunderbird, Flightpath, Kick Butt, Epoch, to name a few - mmm, love the joe.  But their food? Reheated breakfast tacos made elsewhere and microwaved quiche.   Meh.\\n\\nSo what's a coffee-hound to do when looking for both a good, hot breakfast and a stellar cuppa?   Well, sigh no more, people, sigh no more.  Bouldlin Creek satisfies both the need for good coffee, and simultaneously, the need for good, fresh grub.\\n\\nPlus, it's also a great place to just hang, relax, sip your joe, and feel no hurry to free up your table for the next pancake-deprived soul.  And it that weren't enough, if you can imagine it, there are actually more tattoos on the staff and customers here than at the Omelettry!  Seriously!\\n\\nBest food recommendations:  the Bouldin Creek omelet (3 eggs, spinach, garlic, mushrooms, onions and cheese) is really great - and totally healthy if you skip the cheese.  Lots of sides come with - I recommend the organic red & black beans.  Very tasty in a lightly spicy thick broth.  It's also worth it to pay the extra buck for the potato pancake side.  For something totally unique, try to blueberry cornbread, which comes freshly grilled and accompanied by agave nectar as syrup.  Great stuff.  But best of all, the regular drip coffee is great - no need for fancy pants drinks.  You can get your drip coffee with one free refill for $1.75 or bottomless for $2.75.  \\n\\nLove this place - coffee & food both."},{"name":"Garden City Pub","address":"21 Enon St","city":"Beverly","stars":"4","text":"only stopped in for  a beer so can't comment on food; price was right, place was packed which is a good sign.

The reason why I frequented this joint was because of the endless recommendations I got. But I had no clue how famous and popular it is! Once I got there, there was a long line out the door at 9pm! Voodoo Donuts is featured on Times Magazine as one of the top ten things to do in Portland. Furthermore, it is featured on the dessert episode of \\"Man v. Food.\\" And I learned on that episode is that you can satisfy both your sweet tooth and wed your honey at the Voodoo! This is just lovely. \\n\\nAt my first destination in Portland, my ChemE partner-in-crime and I ordered three donuts - Memphis Mafia, Voodoo Doll, and Napoleon. All three of them were gigantic and deliciously magnificent. Memphis Mafia is a chocolate banana fritter that is to die for. It is my absolute favorite \\"donut\\" ever. The Voodoo Doll is good as well, but I'm slightly more attracted to the doll's adorableness than for its taste. It contains a yummy raspberry jam filling and a pretzel stick in its heart. The Napoleon is like a normal donut - nothing too extraordinary. \\n\\nIf I were to visit Portland again, I would most definitely swing by Voodoo Donuts for a quick snack. Despite the long line, you can get in and out of the place with in 15 minutes. Currently, I'm somewhat craving the Maple Bar as Host Adam Richman of \\"Man v. Food\\" raved about it. Additionally, I'm curious about the Bacon Donut, despite the fact that I don't eat bacon."},{"name":"Poor Calvin's","address":"510 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Awesome apps, entrees, and service.

They have so many creative designs and unique flavors ranging from sweet to savory. There were even funky flavors like NyQuil and pepto, which have since been discontinued. They do still come out with new seasonal flavors. The prices are very affordable; it came out to $9 something for four donuts.\\n\\nAs a chocolate lover, I decided to get two chocolate flavors. The first was the peanut doughnut which has chocolate frosting. The other was a chocolate base with chocolate frosting and chocolate toppings, yum! The Bacon Maple Bar is made with bacon and Maple syrup. It was very different from anything I've tried before. I must admit that the first bite was a bit weird because of the mix of sweet and savory sensations, but it quickly becomes addicting. And of course my final choice would be to try the famous Voodoo Doll. It is a giant donut with jelly filling, chocolate frosting, and a pretzel. Personally I felt that it was way too sweet, especially with all that frosting. My favorites would have to be between the double chocolate and the maple bacon. \\n\\nAlso, be prepared for long lines! You may be waiting for an hour on average depending on when you go. There's another location with virtually no lines.

I stopped in with some friends on a Monday night and the restaurant was surprisingly packed.  I'm glad this place appears to be doing well.\\n\\nGrindhouse is another Atlanta burger joint, in the same vein as Flip, Yeah, and Farm Burger, except instead of a swanky, trendy, or \\"farmy\\" atmosphere, it has a punk/hipster feel to it.  The restaurant is artsy with exploitation/art house films projected on the wall inside, a giant robot painting and toy robots behind the bar, and movie posters for cult films such as \\"Faster, Pussycat! Kill! Kill!\\" hanging outside the restrooms.  Indoor and outdoor seating is available.  The patio is spacious and covered.  Parking is usually not a problem unless the restaurant is busy.\\n\\nThis is the type of restaurant where you order at the counter, take a number, and wait for your order to be brought to your table.  Drinks are self-serve out of a fountain drink machine.  Beef, turkey, and veggie burgers are served in 1/4-pound patties.  A burger with one patty is $4.50 and a burger with two patties is $6.00.  You can customize the burger with a variety of toppings.  Some of the more unique toppings include pimento cheese, Carolina coleslaw, black bean spread, New Mexico green chiles, and brisket chili.  Cheese and some toppings cost $0.50+.\\n\\nIf you don't want to create your own burger, you can order one of their eight pre-made designs.  The sides are pretty solid.  Examples include house-made sweet potato kettle chips and \\"cheesy poofs\\" (name inspired by South Park), which are deep-fried pimento cheese nuggets.\\n\\nI had the Dixie burger (single patty, $6.50), which comes with pimento cheese, a fried green tomato, Carolina coleslaw, and chipotle ranch.  This burger was delicious from beef patty to bun to toppings.  If I could re-do my order, I would've ordered a double patty ($7.99).  The junior (or single patty) burgers are just too small for me.\\n\\nThe meat was juicy and flavorful.  It wasn't so juicy that juices were dripping out onto my tray, though, and I appreciated that.  That is a problem at even some of the best burger joints in Atlanta.  The bread consisted of a potato roll, which was soft and lightly toasted.  Just the right amount of toppings too, so the burger wasn't messy to eat.  The ingredients were fresh and tasty.\\n\\nThe sweet potato fries were very good.  They were the large and crinkle-cut variety, but still crispy and seasoned well.  I recommend them.\\n\\nI also tried the wedge salad ($6.50) and avocado salad ($5.99 main portion).  While a lot of lettuce and greens are served in the \\"main\\" portion sizes of these salads, they could still just as easily work as appetizers or sides.  Either way, the salads seem to be a good value.  The iceberg lettuce in the wedge salad was nice and crisp and an entire avocado was served in the avocado salad.  The pico de gallo in the avocado salad made it a bit spicy, so take note.\\n\\nThe next time I come here, I'll probably try one of their popular hand-spun milkshakes.\\n\\nService was fine.  Orders were processed and food was served in a reasonable amount of time.\\n\\nGrindhouse Killer Burgers has two locations in Atlanta.

We really enjoyed the warm buttered rolls as we reviewed the menu. We decided we didn't want any oysters. We ordered the gumbo as an appetizer. It was just okay. I chose the scallops along with the eggplant for my entree and side. He chose the swordfish with brisket and a side of the basmati rice. The  scallops and leeks were delicious! The eggplant didn't have much of a taste so I was a bit disappointed. I expect eggplant to be sweet or something. My husband loved his swordfish and brisket. I shared the basmati rice with him as it was excellent! I highly recommend adding it as a side.

I told her it was OK to sit us at a four top if she gave us high chair. She insisted \\"like I said, it will still be 25 minutes.\\"  After waiting about 5 minutes, we observed a party of four and three that walked up after us get sat. We walked outside to wait. I walked backed inside after a couple of minutes to walk around and noticed a massive booth open. After 10 minutes of waiting, my friend decided to go inside and wait up front with her son. The hostess came over and asked if she needed something, as if she was intruding. After finally being sat, in the same empty booth that had been there the entire time, we were greeted by Connor. He was great, professional and on top of things. The only bad thing is that we waited 45 minutes to get a warning that our pizzas were being recooked because there were holes in the first ones. By this time, it'd been a whole hour without food. Out of desperation, he brought out desserts to try and hold us off I guess. I finally just asked for them to box our pizza to-go since we had somewhere to be.

Unlike breakfast (which I hear can be quite the wait) we walked right in to an empty shop and snagged the prized window seat overlooking the Clinton Neighborhood.  We ordered our breakfasty meals and chatted.  While the wait  for food did seem a little long for it being so empty, it didn't really feel like that big of a deal.  It's definitely reminiscent of a more casual European dining pace rather than a the speedy American grab-n-go that we're so used to.   The guys behind the operation were attentive and cool, it's apparent that they really dig what they're doing.\\n\\nAnd while you might not care at all, I'm completely smitten with the design of this tiny Swedish Cafe.

We somehow were completely oblivious to all the signs outside that said that it was a training night and not open to the public, but since it was just the two of us they said no problem, if we didn't mind the service being a bit slow since everything was being tried out. We said sure, we weren't in a rush.  \\n\\nThe food was really good (which is what gets the three stars), not huge portions, but both of us loved what we got - chicken parm for him, pumpkin ravioli for me. \\n\\nThe beer list though was very lacking for a tavern - mostly the same old big brands like Bud, Coors, Heineken, Guinness, the same crappy brands that you can get anywhere. There were a few local craft brews available in bottles, but I was surprised for it being a tavern that their beer selection was so poor. \\n\\nAlso the atmosphere was really off - nice wood paneling, Sinatra playing, 6 tvs showing sports and sitcoms, live music being tested out, high top tables packed next to regular tables in the bar area.  Are you a sports bar? Classy upscale joint where the food matches the music? Do you want people to mingle and stand around the bar? Or is it sit down formal? It was like the Cheesecake Factory's menu in restaurant format -trying too hard in too many different directions and not really succeeding in any of them.\\n\\nOverall it was a very pleasant experience, we chatted with the manager at the end, waitress was friendly, and they comped our entire meal and drinks since it was the training night.

Those who are critical of this element must be comparing to NY style pies. Backspace replicates Napoli with perfection. The seating is limited and the decor may not be for everyone. The unfinished walls remind me of very old places in Napoli, which I like. The stools are cleverly crafted from wine barrels and the stainless counter bar overlooks the oven and kitchen which I think is pretty cool.\\n\\nI also like the uniqueness of the wine list. What I do not like so much is having no selections under $30, per bottle. There ought to be a House Red among other options. The antipasti portions are very small and pricey. The heated olives with herbs take on a sweetness that is just plain odd. The sopressata tasted more like Genoa. \\n\\nFor dessert I ordered ricotta cheesecake. What I got was, well, I don't really know. It was some sort of custard like substance with a hint of cream cheese and gooey chunks of graham cracker topped with berries in a Mason jar. Not only did it taste like something from Luby's, it was totally out of synch with the southern Italy pizzeria theme. The better jar option is a chocolate and hazelnut mix that went very well with the last of our wine. \\n\\nAgain, the pizza cannot be beat in Austin and I should add that the service is quite good.

Three of us were there for 20 minutes before we even had a waiter come, then another 10 minutes for drinks.  The servers made too much of a fuss over serving the Parker rolls one by one versus bringing over a small basket of rolls to help ourselves.  Mind you I had to ask for rolls three different times with two different people.  We got our rolls about 1 hour into our experience.\\n\\nIt took us almost two hours to be served our steaks, and when they came out, two were not cooked to the specific order, and the sauce on the side they served was not the one ordered for one of us.\\n\\nThe interior fitout is super slick, quite beautiful, and obviously that is what the sell is to the diner.  I really want this place to survive because it could be a very good experience, but they have some serious kinks to work out - the kitchen and the front of the house are completely disjointed.  The food is decent, but the price point for the service is awful.  I hope they can clean up their act and deliver solid service soon.  For a Tuesday night, it shouldn't have taken 2.5 hours to seat and serve us.

I was glad I did, since it was packed by 6pm. Despite it being packed, however, the service was spectacular. I believe our server's name was Dustin, and he was amazing. He ran us through all the specials, told us what the fish of the day was in certain dishes where it wasn't specified, helped with the wine and cocktails and even the dessert menu. There was no question to ask since he answered all the questions I didn't know I had. I ended up ordering the 'Sacsauhuaman' which was a little bit of a spicy cocktail, but the server put in an order for them to make it mildly spicy and it was almost too much for me still. Still, it was delicious and I drank the whole thing. The sugared rim helped cut the spice.\\n\\nFor my meal I skipped the tapas plates, which me and my mother sorta regretted doing. The next time we come back, we'll probably do the tapas. There was complimentary bread and three different kinds of salsa, a peanut salsa, a mango salsa that was pretty spicy, and a japaleno mint, for the table, all of which were absolutely delicious. But after we polished that off, we kinda wanted more. But alas, we had already ordered our entrees.\\n\\nWhen the entrees came, they were a nice size, not too overwhelmingly big and not too small. Just right. I had the Seco a la Nortena which is a lamb shank that's been slow roasted. It was incredible. There was a garlic rice, some sort of beans, and a mildly spicy salsa on top. I devoured that. My mother had the Carapulcra con Puerco that is a pork chop stuffed with cheese and served on this bed of potatoes that I wanted to eat for myself. \\n\\nWe ordered dessert and my mother had the Canutos de Quinua y Maracuya, which were quinoa cannoli that she absolutely loved and devoured. I ordered the Mousse de Valle y Selva, which was a layered mousse with an espresso shortbread cookie. It took all my willpower not to lick the glass it was served in, clean. And since my mother had said it was my birthday, in passing to the server, a very cute blonde girl came up from behind us with the dessert and there was a candle in the middle of my mousse with 'Feliz Cumpleanos' written in chocolate on the plate. My mother said she had a big smile on her face like she was excited to surprise me with the special dessert. This waitress even wished me a happy birthday as we left the restaurant. Oh, and did I mention they comped my birthday dessert? Yeah. That was a bonus surprise. \\n\\nI loved every minute of Andina. I want to go back there tomorrow. And the day after.

As for the food, I love the lamb lollipops, the calamari and the scallops and cheese grits (I think it's gouda). My only beefs would be that the mandatory valet service can be a bit sluggish, the live bands can get a little too loud (thank goodness they're usually blues bands), the place can be a little too trendy (you know what I mean) and some dishes could use some extra pizazz.

You can't really go wrong with the dishes here.\\nThe dessert I recommend is the Fuji caramelized apples!!

The food we got was all very good, but, for the price and quality, I expect much better service than what we got. First, we were trying to decide on a couple small plates to start and saw that the lobster Mac n cheese was gluten free. When we asked our server how that could be, he answered that he wasn't sure and that he didn't really know what made something gluten free. Several of the items on the menu are gluten free, so I would expect a server to have a full working knowledge of the menu. Second, we get to ordering our entrees...same lack of knowledge from the server. He couldn't give us specifics about any dish. Third, we move on to dessert. He let us know that the cheesecake was a vanilla cheesecake, so I ordered that. Almost immediately our server came back to let me know the cheesecake was actually blueberry brown sugar. Big difference. Because that didn't sound good, I ordered the key lime pie. When dessert came out, it was a key lime cheesecake, which I never would've chosen. When I let the server know, he informed me that he didn't know what key lime pie was, but the kitchen assured him that what I got was pie. He then went on to tell us that he hadn't eaten many things on the menu, which had become clear to us.

I love their late night menu and the fact that they even have a late night menu. They may change up their menu items from time to time. The chilli cheese fries are the bomb, especially late at night. Sometimes this place can get crowded but many times I have come by and it is super chill inside. I will definitely be back!"},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"So weird.

Food is quick & tasty. Unfortunately for us, this location does get very busy so there may be a little wait. But its well worth it! :)"},{"name":"Ganko Ittetsu Ramen","address":"318 Harvard St, Unit 3","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"This is a very boutique style ramen shop and is very easy to miss. They have a total of 8 small tables so very limited seating. I came at 9:25 and all the tables were still taken which is how you know a place is good. It is located within the Coolidge corner arcade which is a small hallway within a building with about 12 small shops.\\n\\nOne thing that I can really appreciate about this place is that they give you a lot of meats and veggies with your ramen. I ordered the spicy miso and the entire top layer was stuffed with beef slices, ground beef, bean sprouts and corn. The flavor was a bit different than most spicy ramen I've had. The best way to describe it is that it has a more meaty heartier flavor. Because this place was so small the service was spot on. Never had to ask for water and everything came out quickly.\\n\\nDefinitely one of the best ramen places in Boston. Will definitely be making my way back here"},{"name":"Engine 2 Taphouse","address":"652 Concord Rd","city":"Smyrna","stars":"3","text":"Let me start by saying I REALLY REALLY want to love this place. I've given it a few tries. Last night I sat up at the bar. I won't get on the bartender too hard as I heard it was her first night and her first time bartending. \\n\\nFor being Crafty Hog the beers on tap are very underwhelming. I expected more local breweries. Even the can selection isn't that great for craft brews. \\n\\nThe ordered a grilled chicken sandwich. It was meh... Very meh.... I tried the \\"different\\" BBQ sauces. One said Hog and the other was labeled with a different name (forgot the name)... But they were both the same flavor. Which tasted to me like it was from a jar. Wasn't much impressed. \\n\\nI'll probably give this place one more go... Maybe..  because I always pull for the local places. But you guys seriously need to work on your food !"},{"name":"El Burrito Azteca","address":"1942 N Rosa Parks Way","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I have been going to El Burrito Azteca for years and it is absolutely my favorite Mexican joint in NoPo. Looks like a dive but the food is great and the prices are cheap. Check out the fajita burrito or their tacos. Their meat is authentic and tasty, veggies are great too. Chips and salsa are made in house and they rock. They recently bought the bar next door so now you can grab a beer with your meal and enjoy some soccer in Spanish. My only complaint...
