This year, Celeste won the nod, so we made the rather long drive from the South Shore to Somerville during Boston's hellish rush hour, for an early dinner (the only slot available) at 5:30pm. On my way there I am sure I was thinking \\"is this really going to be worth the long drive and the retiree-friendly dinner time\\" and wondering if we would not have been better off staying closer to home, but as soon as we entered the place, and the dishes started to arrive, any doubts I might have had evaporated.\\n\\nFirst off, the place is minuscule. I did not count, but I would be surprised if they had more than 10 tables, plus about 7 seats at the bar. Second, the welcome you receive is as warm as the breeze coming off the Pacific in Lima. (I am not actually sure that the sea breeze in Lima is warm, but you get what I'm trying to say.) The menu is not too big, but it has a nice range of Peruvian specialties, from the famed ceviche (several varieties) to causas, Chinese-influenced dishes and stews. Everything we ordered was excellent, served with care and presented nicely. \\n\\nAs we entered the restaurant I noticed that their liquor shelf includes a number of obscure-ish items, which led me to expect that their cocktails would be well crafted. This indeed turned out to be the case, and the pisco sour that I enjoyed was as good as any I have had. They offer the option of having the cocktails served with a bit of added spice for an extra $1, so for my second drink I availed myself of the option. It was an interesting twist on the drink, but I think I preferred the non-spicy version--your mileage may vary.\\n\\nWe left here very content, and I'm sure my friends will be back.

She forgot to bring out the rice, said she would...and then didn't until reminded. It was just not good.\\n\\nAlso worth noting, my step-mom ordered hot tea. The waitress referred to the menu of five teas - but they were out of most of them! Why bother at this point? Also, no lemons. \\n\\nThe food however, came out very quickly. It wasn't anything to write home about. The Pad Thai was sort of bland and while it comes with shrimp (three whole shrimp) you can also pay to add extra protein - which is a scam, so I would not recommend. My husband ordered chicken too - it was literally three small, thin strips of chicken - for $4 extra. What?! The Pad Thai already costs like $14 or so.\\n\\nI had the Rama Chicken - it was also just OK.

The wine is absolutely spectacular, and the sommeliers are so helpful and have helped me pick out some unforgettable wines. But the service is pretty terrible and IMHO the food is pretty overpriced. You are paying to have wine on Charles Street.\\n\\nHowever, I'm only giving Bin 26 2 stars because I just had the most awful experience and it was so off putting - something I would expect of a newbie restaurant but not an establishment like B26.  My friend and I made a reservation several weeks ago for Halloween night, knowing it would be crowded. When we got there, we were seated, and introduced to the rudest waiter. It took 10-15 minutes to even put our wine order in, and then another 10-15 to get our wine. When she came over to the table after taking our wine order, she asked if we were ready to put food in, and I started by ordering our 2 apps, and then finished, clearly not ready to order dinner. She then said, and I quote: \\"So here's the sitch: we're super busy [gesturing to the 8 people waiting by the door] and when we're busy the kitchen likes to get all of the food orders in at once so that the right food gets to you.\\" Her attitude was so negative and condescending, I felt like I was a 5 year old being scolded. \\n\\nUM, excuse me? First of all: not my problem. I'm trying to enjoy my dinner with my friend on Halloween night; I pay the money, you deal with the logistics. Not that hard. The people waiting are not my problem. I have a certain amount of understanding, but this is our table while we are here, I shouldn't have to worry about other people. Second of all: she clearly just wanted to turn the table over. A good restaurant in Beacon Hill shouldn't mess up orders no matter how busy the restaurant is, so that was obviously an excuse. Third of all: I had had the reservation for WEEKS and been looking forward to it. It's not MY responsibility to follow these ridiculous rules that you arbitrarily made up because you didn't like how slow we were going. I found the whole thing extremely rude and unacceptable. \\n\\nAdditionally, when I tried to order a certain glass of sauvignon blanc, I was told that there is only one sauv blanc by the glass. However, I'd clearly been looking at FOUR options - and one was a bordeaux (the one I wanted) and one was a sancerre. I was given the sancerre, which is very different from a bordeaux, despite the fact that the other was clearly on the list. \\n\\nThe rest of the dinner the server continued to be INCREDIBLY rude and unaccommodating, clearly pissed that we weren't rushing through our meal so she could get another table. We were fairly happy to leave.\\n\\nThis was the first time I'd experienced this at Bin 26 - my mom and I went several weeks ago and had the loveliest experience, on a Friday night, and were treated like royalty. I really hope that this was an anomalous experience, but it was so off putting. \\n\\nStuff I've had: \\n-Meatball app - 2/5. Tasted more like meatloaf, I've had way better. \\n-Burrata - 3/5. Burrata is always good, it's nothing spectacular. \\n-Risotto of some sort - excellent, that was a while ago though.\\n-Chicken saltimbocca - 3.5/5.

Food from $5-6.50 can fill you up easily.  Drinks at $4.-5 depending on beer/wine/cocktail. For about $50, we got 4 drinks, fried chicken, 2 tacos, brussel sprouts, and a creme brulee off the main menu.  Fried chicken was the one big surprise as for $6.50 you get 2 extremely large fried chicken thighs and a biscuit.  Really good crunch and great portion.  Tacos proteins were extremely well cooked (pork belly and catfish) but overall the taco was just boring besides that with not much coexisting ingredients.  Pork belly did have an egg which was interesting, but turned out very messy.  Brussel sprouts a great opener but know that it is leaves only and therefore won't add much to filling you up.  Creme brulee very good and 2 times the size of any other creme brulee.  Texas-sized for sure and pretty rich vanilla insides.  Overall happy hour was a 5/5 recommendation.  But the rest of the menu looked good as well and based on looking around portions are all very big.  Cheap and enjoyable make Salty Sow an Austin must.

The miso soup was the perfect starter, filled with plenty of seaweed and tofu.  The ginger salad I was surprised by...but in a good way.  Usually a ginger salad is a bunch of crunchy lettuce with a slice of tomato and cucumber, the ginger salad here was a nice mix of the crunchy lettuce, spring mix, and kale with plenty of tomato and the dressing was very tasty.  The winner of the dinner was obviously the godzilla sushi roll.  It was filled with tempura fried shrimp, tempura fried asparagus, blue crab, avocado, and cream cheese.  It was sooooo good.  I will absolutely order that roll again and would recommend it to anyone, especially if you're new to sushi and trying to get into it (like me).  \\n\\nThe restaurant is small, but has a good vibe to it.

Further to that, the atmosphere is interesting and enjoyable. It's in a large house in the downtown area and so it rather feels homelike and inviting.

For me, it was warm, casual, yet very appropriate for a romantic dinner, a meal with friends, a special occasion, or just a nice dinner in \\"someone's home.\\" On a different note, I can't imagine this place is good for someone with mobility issues as even getting to the main floor dining room requires going up a steep flight of stairs. Bathrooms are on the upper floor as well. (if there is handicap access, I did not see it so one should check first if this is a concern for your dining event.) \\nBack to the food, our entrees and appetizers were so tasty and beautifully prepared - our table of four all felt that each and every dish was excellent. As some have done, I do feel that comparing the pasta to that available in Italy is a bit unfair (and pretentious). I think the comparison should be made to what is offered in the Vancouver area. (And yes, I have eaten pasta in Italy as well, and yes, it was excellent.) Most of us don't necessarily travel to Italy when we are in the mood for some pasta. \\n\\nOverall, excellent food, and service. Nice homelike atmosphere.

Meat is what they're famous for and what they do best. Not being a BBQ person, I'm left to choose from the remaining menu items, which are all mediocre. The burger is served on an untoasted bun. The baked fish is unseasoned and bland. The pasta dishes are as big as your face but mostly blah. The mozzarella sticks, fries, and onion rings are frozen. The salad is a bowl of iceberg lettuce with two grape tomatoes.\\n\\nAs for the service, sometimes you get a nice server and other times you get an asshole with an attitude.

I called to be refunded, and the owner argued/disagreed that I said no cashews.

I've never heard of that place?  \\"Chez Dodo*\\"? Is it another overrated French restaurant?\\n\\nI investigated it further and discovered it's an Indian food cart?!  Perfect!  Also, a friend of mine that rarely hands out 5-star ratings, actually 5-star'd this place...sounds like a trip is in order!\\n\\nWell, to call the food here \\"Indian\\" would be doing it a huge disservice.  It is a fusion of MANY different kinds of cuisine.  You know how pretentious bands will often say things about their style like \\"weeeellllll...we don't' really like labels but if you HAD to pigeon-hole us into a genre, I'd say we're kinda like indie-gospel-folk-viking-punkmetalcore with some psychedelic neojazz influences.\\"  And you roll your eyes, and then someone plays a clip of their live set and they sound like The Strokes.\\n\\nWell, this place has a very tantalizing description of its food, words I can remember are: French, Creole, Chinese, and Indian.  And it's not just a ruse, this food really does taste like it's inspired by many different food traditions, and it combines them WONDERFULLY.  I got red-wine lamb curry (see what I mean?) with fried noodles.  It was like nothing I've ever put into my mouth-hole.  It was really good.  Also, Shyam (the owner) asked me how hot I wanted it, and I told him \\"very\\".  If a place that has curry does not ask you your spice level by default, that is NEVER a good sign. (even worse is a burger joint that does not ask you how you'd like it cooked)  It was topped with some sort of a fresh, green hot sauce that I wish I had more of!\\n\\nAND.  The portions were HUGE.  HUGE.  And if you know me at all, you'll know that I love nothing more than grilling places on portion size because they cannot satisfy my T-Rex-sized appetite.  I ate this meal THREE different times.\\n\\nOH, and Shyam's name is a bolded keyword for this place on Yelp for good reason.  He is incredibly nice.  He may be the warmest person I have ever met.  I don't know how he ended up in Portland (perhaps I'll ask him next time) but I'm glad he did! PROTIP: he told me that he is moving his cart downtown, so the location is probably going to change very, very soon.  If not already.\\n\\n*So, why the odd name?  Well, I noticed a sticker on this cart that displayed a flag and a word that I had never seen before.  The word was \\"Mauritius\\".  I had to google it.  It's an island nation to the east of Madagascar that is very multi-ethnic and used to be a French (Chez = House in French) colony.  It looks gorgeous and I want to go to there.  Why the Dodo?  Well, this is where the friendly (seriously, it wasn't afraid of humans and therefore easy to turn into lunch) Dodo bird used to live until MAN decided to cause an EXTINCTION EVENT."},{"name":"HunnyMilk","address":"40 NE 28th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I have led brunch crawls, assembling a motley crew of brunch lovers and hopping from brunch spot to brunch spot, sampling the best from each.

Overdone and felt like someone had microwaved it. The venison and boar ended up just being sausages, which were nearly room temperature (very odd compared to steaming duck).

He looked at us, one eyebrow raised and said \\"i'll see what I can do..\\". We looked around and there was NO ONE there. At this point, we felt a little uneasy. A minute later, he came back and said he found a table, as if this is when we are supposed to thank him so gratefully for allowing us to dine in his restaurant ...

I calmly told him that it was clearly on the receipt and this was a mistake that he made. He told me that the yum yum sauce was only $3 but another order of steak would be $6 and they would not remake it. I told him I eat there frequently, I ordered their food to be delivered and it did not make since they as a restaurant would not be willing to loose a few dollars when they got my order wrong to keep a customer. He said he would remake it in an irritated voice and hung up on me. Extremely poor customer service. Mistakes happen, I was not upset about that. Not apologizing and refusing to make the situation better in an even way is not the way a successful manager should act.

Six of eight Yelp reviews gave it five stars - how could we go wrong?!\\n\\nWell, we arrived excited and enthusiastic and left disappointed.\\n\\nWe arrived and were seated immediately by the hostess.  No complaints here.  We were seated at a strange table by a small set of stairs.  One side of the table had bench seating for two and the other side had one seat offset to the side because the other half of that side was taken up by the railing of the stairs.  Strange setup for a table.  No big deal though - we were there for the food and we were starving.\\n\\nWe ordered the Cheese Toast as per everyone's recommendation here.  Great way to start a meal, just as others have commented on already.  We followed that up with the Ceasar Salad, which I have to say was the highlight of my meal.  This was probably the best Caesar Salad I've ever had.  Lightly dressed but full of flavour.  Do note that the salad is not prepared table side as it was before but prepared at a station in the dining room.  Not that it really matters where they make it, as long as it tastes good.\\n\\nBut that's where the good times ended.\\n\\nAn old establishment with a lot of history screams for classic cocktails so I ordered a Manhattan.  It was very heavy on the sweet vermouth and I would say one of the worst I've ever ordered.  After that drink, we decided to just stick with that wine.\\n\\nBut who cares about the drinks or the appetizers.  We came here for the steak and that's where this place is going to shine right?  Wrong.\\n\\nI originally wanted to order the Prime Rib but they had run out.  Already.  At 8:00.  On a Friday night.  In a restaurant that stays busy until at least 10pm.  Sure, maybe *every* person before me ordered the Prime Rib but I find that unlikely.\\n\\nI settled with the Bone-In Rib Steak and she ordered the Gorgonzola Fillet Mignon.  My steak was flat and thin - quite sad looking.  I ordered it medium rare, and while you could argue that the very center was medium rare, my crust was too thick (made worse by the thinness of the cut) so overall the steak felt and tasted like it was done to medium.  My girlfriend's steak suffered a similar problem.  The seared crust was again too thick giving the steak a tough overcooked texture despite the inside being done to a medium rare.  She found it very hard to cut through.\\n\\nTaking into account the price of these steaks and the reputation that preceded my visit, I'd say that this restaurant falls flat.  If a *steak* restaurant can't cook their steaks to the right doneness, who cares if the rest of the food tastes ok?  If you can look at the steak in front of you and say to yourself, \\"I can do better than this at home\\" - I'd say that amounts to a failing grade.  If the highlight of everyone's night is a cheesy piece of toast that anyone can make, there must be a problem.  This restaurant just isn't worth it.\\n\\nI didn't get it.  How could all the reviews be so positive? Maybe it was an off night?  After having such an opposite experience to the other reviews on Yelp, we mentioned it to at least half a dozen of our friends and their own experiences mirrored ours.\\n\\n\\"I hate Hy's\\"\\n\\"Morton's is closed?!\\"\\n\\"I miss Morton's\\"\\n\\"I never go to Hy's\\"\\n\\"Why did you go there?!\\"\\n\\nAh well.

It's completely arbitrary, especially since many of the items called 'entrees' would -always- be called sides at any other restaurant.  Cream Cheese Rangoon, for example.  And yes, it's -cream cheese- Rangoon: no crab implied or provided.\\n\\nFor a certain price, you get to choose two 'entrees' and one 'side'.  I would prefer if they just counted everything as an 'item' and you could pick any three.

Before my gluten allergy, I was here several times for happy hour with co-workers and enjoyed the macaroni cheese.  I have had the ahi tuna appetizer (which is good), and the burger.\\n\\nMy biggest complaint about this restaurant is the service, especially in the outdoor bar area.  I have had the same server a couple of times and he consistently screws up my order, takes forever to get the bill, or just plain ignores requests for water refills or another drink.  At one point, I went inside to get the manager, as my food arrived 35 minutes after I ordered (it was cold), and the bartender had failed to fill my drink (after 3 requests).  And, the manager on staff was of little help.  I nearly walked out of there not paying my bill, because no one would come and run my credit card.\\n\\nI was just here recently, after boycotting the place for almost a year.  The service was better and the food was decent. But still, the hostess was of little help in seating me where I wanted to be (in the sun), and it took a long time to just order, get my food, and pay for it.\\n\\nAfter seeing all the poor reviews on here, something must be keeping this place alive, and I believe its the view and position on the lake.

After trying Open Table, we confirmed personally for 8/13.  Mid-week, get a call confirming our table for WED night.  Wrong!  Tried calling the place, no one EVER answers the phone and no machine.  Hubbie drives to the place to straighten it out, with a lot of headache from them but they promised us the best table #___ to make up for our inconvenience, no problem on 8/13.

(Hardly anyone ended up sitting in the lake section tables for 2 more hours, until 8 pm and after.)  They told hubbie the owner decided to come in on 8/13 and bounced us from the #1 table.  So, staff thought they'd stick us in anywhere, ie, bumyard.  After 15 minutes, they finally managed to put 2 empty tables together in the empty lake section.   Then service - grade F.  Took 35 minutes to get one drink each for table of 5!  All in all, dinner took 2.5 hours.  SLOW and they were not busy.  4 bacon wrapped shrimps as appetizer are $19. Entree was good at $37.

Gotta get any taco with pork belly!\\n\\nIn a taco-crazed city, raves about a taco food truck is a big deal, and I had to try it.  I ordered the BBQ Brisket Taco, the Chinese BBQ Taco with Pork Belly, and the Belgian fries.  I'll start with this: their pork belly and brisket are amazing!\\n\\nThe pork belly had a high fat:meat ratio, so flavors were strong and they were delicious.  I've had pork belly plenty of times in my life, but these are on a whole new level.  Each bite was explosive in taste and paired well with the Asian slaw, Chinese BBQ sauce, and the cilantro.  It tasted like the Chinese BBQ sauce had a component of Hoisin sauce, and its sweetness was perfect for the pork belly.  Meaty, sweet, and fresh ingredients all wrapped within a lovely flour tortilla; I could eat these all day!\\n\\nThe brisket was moist and seasoned very well.  I nearly took off points for the lack of fattiness, but then I realized that a lot of it just fell out of the taco as I was eating it!  The BBQ was slightly heavy for my taste (I usually don't eat meat with sauce), but like the Chinese BBQ Taco, the savory brisket complements well with the fresh slaw and the sweet BBQ sauce.\\n\\nThe Belgian fries to me weren't all that special.  However, they were very very crispy and not too salty at all.  The Parmesan cheese topping was a good extra layer or flavor as well.  I could easily rank these fries in my top 5.\\n\\nThe only reason why I'm struggling to give Peached Tortilla 5 stars is cause of the price.  It's almost unfair because given the price, while the quantity is lacking, the quality of the tacos is definitely worth it.  I would've loved to have at least twice as much fries after paying $3.50 for them.\\n\\nYou know what?  Pork belly is mad difficult to make and Peach Tortilla killed it!  Have your 5 stars!"},{"name":"Carmelina's","address":"307 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"We made reservations and were seated close enough to the time slot to rate five stars all the way around.

And, yes, we were able to stop by this restaurant and enjoy some good chicken and waffles.  My kids loved the crisp of the fried chicken and I loved how juicy the chicken was inside.  The waffles was also good and homemade tasting where the batter wasn't overly heavy, but it was very tasty where you wanted to keep eating even though you were full.  I also ordered a side of Macaroni & Cheese and this side dish was yummy!    My cousin ordered the Salmon Croquette and it was the first time that I tried this dish and I actually liked it.  We obviously ordered a little bit of everything and it was all good.  The service, however, was a different story.  We were a party of 10 adults and 3 kids (1 was an infant) and I think they were overwhelmed by a big party even though we were eating a late lunch at around 2:00 pm.  The restaurant was pretty empty except for maybe 2 other parties of 2 people and the hostess wasn't too keen in seating us all together.  Don't know why they couldn't put tables together, but they had 7 of us in a tight booth and another 3 adults with the 3 kids sit at a different table across from the booth.  It would have been nice to dine together, but they didn't accommodate that.  And there was another server (not ours) who wasn't too nice about putting our coats in a 2 person booth since we were all squished together and didn't have room to take off our heavy coats from the rain.  He said that we should move our stuff because they were going to seat someone any minute (this was at almost 2:30 pm) and, again, the restaurant was pretty empty.  Whatever, we moved our things and had it hanging over us.  Our waitress was great and was very pleasant and helpful though.

We didn't order appetizers as the bread basket and olive oil was sufficient, but other tables had apps that looked very good.\\n\\nFor our main course, we had the Pork Chop with Ricotta Dumplings in a balsamic reduction and the Quail on Turnip Mash. The Pork Chop was decent...nothing to write home about. The Turnip Mash, however, was out of this world. I could just eat that.

I'm impressed by the elegant yet laid back vibe, and it's a cozy, seasonally appropriate place no matter what time of the year (patio!).\\n\\nFor a restaurant with such a huge focus on wine retail, the food is amazingly good. The menu is definitely vinyard-inspired, and reminds me of the menus I experienced in Napa-- think cheeses, seasonal fruit accents, flavors that remind you of sunny orchard tables. Execution is great.\\n\\nFor Restaurant Week, I had the veal meatball (amazingly tender and good), the seafood fettuccine with seasonal veggies like corn and squash (with lobster! for Restaurant week! I know market prices are abnormally low right now, but still), and brandied cherries with ice cream for dessert. All this for $20, was the best deal of the three restaurants I tried for Restaurant Week at that price category.\\n\\nThe wine is retail, with a corking fee. Even with the $8 corking fee, this is a much more economical option than ordering wine at a restaurant with the typical markup, especially since the food here is so phenomenal. You are encouraged to browse, but I just kind of described what I wanted/liked and my server brought over a couple of options. She helped me make a selection with the flavor and price point I was comfortable with. The servers will take your bottle to the back and bring it to the optimal temperature, if necessary.\\n\\nOur server was a bit of a Manic Pixie Dream Girl, nervous and twittering all over the place. At times, we felt abandoned, but then again us ladies were enjoying being lost in conversation. We were seated at a large table (square 8-top, even though there were just 4 of us) in one of the back alcoves. It almost felt like we had a private room. They do have a private room in the back, by the way, which would be great for a special occasion meal for 12ish. It's a little over-decorated, perhaps, but still cozy and looks like it would foster some good times and memories. The whole aesthetic juuuust verges on the line of being suburban-chainy, but it's still on the right side, I think.\\n\\nThis would be a great place for a date night or a girls' night.

It was like she went out of her way to NOT walk by us (as we were literally in the middle of the logical path back lol). So I just held out our payment and bill staring at the server (again feeling like I was stalking her lol) until she looked at me and came by. So I was late coming back to work, but that just happens I suppose.\\n\\nHonestly, everything except getting the bill in a timely manner was great! Maybe it's just that they are new to the server game. They were nothing but friendly so that was nice! I will definitely try again as I'd like to think it was just a little fluke. If it gets better, I will adjust my review. :) \\n\\nIf you aren't in any type of hurry at all, by all means give them a go! :)"},{"name":"Ovation Coffee & Tea","address":"941 NW Overton St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"I'm glad I came here for my final meal in Portland- Ovation's Pistatio latte is quite possibly the most delicious coffee I've ever had.

They were already out of the the beef and pork ribs.  We were getting there late, so I expected they would be out of a few things.  We get up to the window and they tell us they just ran out of sausage.  So we try to order brisket and pulled pork.  And they tell us they only have chopped brisket.  What?  Who only has chopped brisket?  I have never seen that before.  Most places take sliced brisket and chop it up should someone ask for it that way.  This is Texas.  Brisket is sold sliced.\\n\\nMy rating might be higher if I had the sliced brisket, but I won't be going back.\\n\\nBrisket was just OK.  Sliced brisket would probably be better.  Pulled pork was OK.  I think it is prepared just like the brisket with just salt and pepper.

The steamed fish and the lamb stew were by far the best. The steamed fish had a ton of flavor and felt like a well rounded presentation of flavors. The lamb stew was also very good. \\n\\nThe dish that I was the most excited to get was voted the one that we would unanimously have the \\"chop\\", the chicken stew. It was kind of just like pulled chicken on clicked potatoes with Parmesan cheese on top. Very very bland and boring with absolutely no depth and/or different consistencies. It also wasn't a transitional stew like the lamb dish. \\n\\nMixed ceviche was delicious - highly recommend. \\n\\nDrinks- very delicious but take a bit to get back to you so be prepared with you next order for when they come around. \\n\\nSpeaking of making their way around to your table... they haven't quite figured out the service model, which seems very strange for such a tiny space! We were always being asked by different people if we'd ordered, so some communication would be nice on their part.  When we sat down and we're getting water we weren't greeted and the waiter wasn't engaging. Kind of a bummer when you're excited to try a new place and they don't engage. \\n\\nFound that this service model leads to things be a bit off. For example, they auction off the food when it comes to the table: \\"who has the X\\", which is the worst to have to stop, think and direct the waiter, for only a table of four. Next, they wouldn't come around for a while, which is fine, but when you needed something you'd have to flag them down.  Not a huge deal in a small place, but something to consider.

It started out great. The sweet tea, a drink to which I have become completely addicted since moving to Austin, and the fried pickles were excellent. It started to go downhill when our entree was brought to the table. We both ordered a large burger with a side of chili cheese tots. Let me back up and say that since we are both blind, we asked our server to read the menu, he obliged and told us about what was there. When we ordered the burgers, he asked what sides we wanted and listed several. We told him and that was that. Our understanding was that a side ordered with a burger was an item that came with that burger. Anyway, when the burgers came, mine was a small. I told him and he did correct the problem but said he thought that's what I ordered. Whatever. I could have let that alone go as minor. The next problem was that the tots with chili, while flavorful, was lukewarm. Mine was a little warmer than my fiance's, but still. The suspicious part that finally took the situation to a one star experience was what happened when the check was brought. First, it was the shock of the price. $46 for two burgers and an appetizer and two drinks. What a surprise to know that each \\"side\\" was $6.45! Wow! I gave the server my card with some frustration. When he came back with the receipt to sign, he forgot to bring my card back. I asked where it was and he claimed he was absentminded and left it at the register. If that were where it had been located, I wouldn't have said a whole lot. But no.

It has officially gone down hill, and the passion has completely left the food. We asked if they had a new chef because it was so blah, and at such a high price. Apparently it is the same chef. We got the sense that there was actually no chef anymore, just cooks, it was that indistinct. I think they are riding on their past success and the star provisions name. One of the appetizers we ordered tonight was roasted beats with goat cheese and pistachios. Wouldn't you expect that to have more than just those ingredients? Well, it literally only had a slab of goat cheese, some roasted beats cut really haphazzardly and not seasoned, and literally 3 pistachios. Oh, sorry, and a few sprigs of watercress. So creative (definitely not worth $12). I could have made that forgettable dish at home. .

A couple of slices of avocado, tomato, lettuce, onion, and sour cream are served on the side.  The quesadillas cost $5.99.\\n\\nWe went with carne asada (beef) for the torta.  If you've never had a torta before, then think of it as a hot Mexican sub sandwich.  The telera roll was thin and soft.  Between the 2 slices of telera were refried beans, lettuce, onion, and just a little bit of Mexican cheese blend.  I'm not a mayo fan, so we got the torta without mayo which I believe is chipotle based.  The torta was good as a result of the good telera and the carne asada.

Now, I have to say that I'm not a pizza snob at all. I hate Pizza Hut, but I can put it down. Domino's is decent. For those of you who insist on some rustic, thin crust, florentine kinda stuff, Damatas is probably not for you. I eat pizza because it's sauce and dough and cheese and those are a few of my favorite things. Damatas has just the ratio of those things that I like: tons of cheese, neither thin nor pan-style dough, and a medium-to-light layer of sauce. One of the other things I like about their pies is that if you get toppings, the top layers of the pizza go: cheese-topping-cheese. This keeps the roni in place and tastes great.\\n\\nI have little experience with the rest of the menu at Damatas. The chicken fingers are the frozen, flash-fried kind of stuff that a lot of these types of joints have. The garlic bread is decent if you want a bread side (no breadsticks are available). The wings are poor; low-quality chicken. I stick to the pizza here.\\n\\nOne thing that may only happen to me is that Damatas often brings my order to the wrong house. I live on a street whose name occurs in both Beverly and Salem.

Maybe I should have added some hot sauce but I believe that, while I like hot sauce, food should be good without it. \\nThe good: nice sized portions - I couldn't finish the 2 half orders. The staff was friendly. Service was quick. The crust of the Shyamosa was tasty. \\nBut again, I just didn't think the food had much flavor overall.

Things started off promisingly enough with a great smoke smell and a friendly owner. But when the food came out, I knew I wasn't going to be happy.\\n\\nI firmly believe good BBQ shouldn't require sauce. Sauce can be added, but the best joints always serve their 'cue without sauce. Why? Because if the meat is smoked right, it won't need it. So when I saw sauced shredded chicken piled on a sad grocery store bun, I knew immediately what I was getting. The same kind of 'cue you'll get in an airport food court or some company cookout. \\n\\nYou know the BBQ I'm talking about. The kind that's cooked (but not really smoked), then slathered in a brownish sauce that tastes like it was poured straight from a jar. I finished the sandwich (as well as the just-OK mac 'n cheese) not because I enjoyed it, but because I was hungry. \\n\\nMaybe with a built-in customer base of Tech students, 5th Street doesn't really have to put out a better product. And I guess that's fine if they want to make BBQ without any of the love you'd get from a true pitmaster.

BOTTOMLINE: I DISAGREE.  I give a low mediocrity rating for the whole experience except the \\"traditional turkey dinner.\\" There are three things I will touch upon; the food, of course, the ambiance, and service.\\n\\nThere are slim pickings in Boulder when it comes to dining on Thanksgiving. There is no need to mention the competition. And as you know, word of mouth is the most powerful marketing tool when it comes to food. \\n\\nThe Thanksgiving menu was mostly French cuisine (to be expected) except the \\"Thanksgiving Traditional\\" entr√©e. I LOVE French food, so this is a wonderful combo, right? I ordered escargot as my app. It was missing the correct seasoning. It needed something. But...oh, wait, an easy fix, salt was on the table and it needed a tiny pinch. What nice French restaurant has salt and pepper shakers on your table anyway?\\n\\nMy boyfriend ordered the \\"homemade lobster ravioli with alfredo sauce\\" for an app. There was NO alfredo sauce on it. It was champagne sauce with a touch of lobster oil...Not at all as it was presented in the menu. \\n\\nAfter the apps, my hopes that this restaurant was \\"stellar,\\" had completely plummeted. My boyfriend has a culinary degree and agreed. \\n\\nBUT when the Thanksgiving dinner entr√©e came and we were both satisfied. The turkey was moist, stuffing with sausage was okay and the gravy was very good. Maybe this French place is good at making Thanksgiving dinners and bad at French cuisine? The service certainly wasn't aligning with French foundations.\\n\\nWorking on holidays at a restaurant is difficult. I know, I did it. I supported myself in NYC as a student and worked my ass off. My boyfriend has been a chef in five star restaurants. Even without our service industry background, it was easily noticeable that our server looked miserable and didn't appear to be knowledgeable about the items on the menu that we're paying (over $200) for.\\n\\nI think this place WILL close down in the near future.........The d√©cor reminds me of a take-out Chinese restaurant from the early 90s with weird glass European knickknacks and strange fish lights.

With this said, it was worth trying Tilt considering the reviews and raves over it. \\n\\nBf loved the veggie burger and I'd have to admit it had good flavor and taste!  I just got a basic cheese burger and the burger was good. The beef was juicy and oozing.\\n\\nWe also ordered the jalepeno poppers which isn't the standard poppers with breaded poppers on the outside and cheese on the inside. This is a breaded ball that is a mixture of potatoes and jalepenos. They are large in size (about 1 inch diameter) and a large will fill up two people easily. \\n\\nThe atmosphere is super low key. They use washed red rags instead of napkins, which is great for the environment, but felt weird for us, but I think this is something of a concept that we just need to get used to. \\n\\nPrice-wise, it is a bit on the expensive side for a burger that doesn't come with sides, but again, this isnt your typical McDonalds and I think you're paying more for the quality of the ingredients and just the specialty of it.  \\n\\nOverall, if you're in to burgers, I am pretty sure you will enjoy Tilt. For us it was good to try, the flavor was good, but we're not big on burgers so it's not something we'd crave at the price point. \\n\\nAt some point, we'll have to come back to try the fries."},{"name":"Local No 7","address":"2316 Main St, Ste A","city":"Tucker","stars":"3.5","text":"Wanted to like this place.

I inquired about the prices of Pappy Van Winkle. If you've never tried this bourbon (or never had bourbon) then it's a must. It's life changing. It's also very hard to find - even at liquor stores. The most popular offerings are 15-year, 20-year and 23-year. This is not a cheap drink anywhere. For instance, at Vince Young's Steakhouse one can get a 15-year for $20 and the 23-year for $50-$55. At Ten Oak, where you think you'd want to get people to actually drink bourbon, they charge $35 for the 15-year and I swear they said $90 for the 23-year. I was disgusted.\\n\\nStrike three.

The biscuits were tender and flaky and the grits were deliciously creamy and cheesy. I actually preferred the grits over the biscuits. My chicken sausage were slightly overcooked--another 5 minutes and they would have been hockey pucks, but they were palatable. The saddest part of the meal was my brother's entree.

It was a long week for me and I needed a little change of scenery from my normal spots and it was in her neighborhood. A little bird told me they validate parking and they also have a nice selection of appetizers to choose from during happy hour and I am a sucker for a good deal. I like to sit at the bar when I go to a restaurant because I feel as though the relationship you build with your bar keep is much more genuine than a server and at this location, I was right on the money. I sat down with my friend at the bar; was immediately greeted with a smile from the mixologists there and a nice girl with shorter hair slid me a menu. I told her to make me an old fashioned. She was polite enough to notice I uttered to my friend that I love cherries and planted 3 right on top of my beverage without me having to ask. My friend and I chose to order the sliders and hummus with pita; I believe it was just enough to get me through the night without being too full and save room for another cocktail but I wasn't blown away. A gentleman in a suit with a cane spotted my friend and I, proceeded to aimlessly hover around us for a while. I didn't think anything of it when he offered us a couple glasses of champagne (on him) I just assumed he was just some rich guy trying to show off; these occurrences happen often when two young girls sit at the bar alone; they are always just slightly too friendly for my taste. He honestly just reminded me of a British pimp and I wasn't quite sure how he got there until I realized he was what one would call, the host. It was unusual for the concept at this bar, and he just made me feel uncomfortable. I don't enjoy feeling like men need to cater to women in that fashion and imply I cannot buy my own drinks, because if not for that, then why else would someone just invite themselves into our conversation? I paid my bill and the kind bartenders carried an enjoyable conversation with me while my friend sipped our last drops. The lady in the short hair was very kind and mentioned they had a bar upstairs if we wanted to dance. It's 25+ to enter which I thought was an incredible touch. The music was fun, some cool old school house and disco, nothing crazy. The vibe was alright, not exactly what I was looking for but to be expected in Buckhead. The culture was drained here a long time ago, but I needed to let my hair down after a long work week. All around, it was a simple menu simple ingredients but a classy joint.

We looked on Yelp beforehand to find the happy hour times, which is listed for Monday from 4-9pm.\\n\\nAs soon as we walked into the bar the waiter, who happened to be our same waiter from last time, kindly greeted us. We told him we were excited to try their happy hour, and that's when the awful news came. He nicely explained that happy hour had just ended, and would begin once again at 8. \\n\\nUnfortunately their happy hour was misstated on Yelp as their actual hours of operation of 4-9pm, not the happy hour of 4-6p & 8- Close. We walked in at 6:08pm. And we had just left a nearby restaurant upon remembering that this place had a great happy hour. I showed our waiter the yelp page, which clearly stated that happy hour was indeed happening at that very moment. I was extremely disappointed. \\nHe asked us to wait a moment while he went into the kitchen; upon returning he said he could honor the happy hour menu for us! We couldn't have been more grateful. Especially since I would've without a doubt, left to find happy hour somewhere else if our only option was the full priced menu. \\n\\nI told my fianc√© that I wondered if our waiter remembered us from our last visit, but he didn't think so. A few minutes later, our waiter returned and said, \\"You guys were here a couple weeks ago, it was a Wednesday, and you were sitting right over there right?\\" (and pointed to the table) I was VERY impressed with his recollection, especially since the bar was totally packed that night. \\n\\nWe ordered four items on the happy hour menu and a drink altogether for only $24. The portion sizes were much larger than we anticipated. Our waiter grabbed our half eaten plates after confirming we were finished, and I assumed he was throwing them away since a vast majority of happy hours don't allow you to take to-go boxes. I was shocked when he came back with our food boxed, bagged, and ready to go. \\n\\nFrom the time we walked in, to the moment we walked out, we were treated so well, I couldn't complain if I tried. There's also a large flat screen directly in front of the bar, which is always playing football.  Being that Beaverton lacks respectable late night food, we have unquestionably found our new regular happy hour spot, especially during Monday night football. \\n\\nLOVE IT!"},{"name":"Waves Coffee House","address":"180 - 5951 No 3 Road","city":"Richmond","stars":"3","text":"Got a cup of latte and it was about 8/10 full and about 1/10 all foam.

This is one of the few pizza places where my kids actually eat the pizza (I have odd children who don't like pizza, I know).  The gal at the register, who I should really know her name by now, is always very patient and sweet.  In fact, everyone we've interacted with has been friendly so I never have to worry about sending my kids to get a fork or something.  The atmosphere reminds me of the pizza joints I used to go to as a kid.  It's not sparkly or shiny - it's got a rustic feel, with that old school vibe. I actually like that they haven't updated anything, otherwise it would feel new and pretentious.  I hope it stays the same. My kids especially love the fire pit and pretending it's on, even tho its's hardly ever on, and the train that circles the room above you by the ceiling. Though we hardly ever sit inside that indoor train, they do love running through and staring at it.  Even when people are inside trying to eat....\\n\\nAll their pies are good.  I especially love the cornmeal on the bottom so the crust keeps that nice crunch.  Salad bar is always stocked well and pretty big, with lots of variety.

The potato spikes are sooooo yummy but buyer beware - don't get full off the spikes like I do.  Save room for pizza!\\n\\nWe come here a lot, and sometimes just get take out too.

Food is at least a 3.5, the enchiladas would be five stars, according to my friend, the Rollo de Pechuga was a solid three stars because the chicken was a bit dry, the breading and sauce were both solid additions but not in a way that fully compensates. The plantanos would be six stars if possible and the fresh chips and salsa could be a menu item of their own, so the fact that they are free actually feels like a gift.

And I mean perfectly medium, the edges were cooked and the pink was a nice soft pink right in the middle. The egg was also perfect. It wasn't hard where the yolk was completely cooked, nor soft where with one bite, you've covered your delicious burger with running egg yolk. \\n\\nI was thoroughly happy with my burger. Not so much with the salad which costs $1 more. It was limp greens, a few matchstick carrots and 2 slices of cucumbers. It wasn't even cold. But after I had a few of SO's fries, I knew that I made the better choice because the fries were limp, greasy and tasteless. \\n\\nThe server was ok, he didn't go above and beyond now did he ask if I needed a refill (which I did), even when he came by to take away plates and bring us our check.

This dish was nasty--it was stir fried shrimp with steamed broccoli and sweetened (yuck!) walnuts  and then covered in mayonnaise!!! Horrible! Not what I ever thought I would get in a Chinese restaurant. The rest of the food was unmemorable.  Another funny antecdote was when I mentioned that I thought the seafood udon was going to be a soup, the waiter (female) sneered \\"oh, no, udon in a soup, never!\\"  I wondered if she knew that udon is originally Japanese and used exclusively in soups in Japanese cuisine but that would be asking too much of their waiters.  Their service was ridiculously bad.  Not only did the waiter made us feel unwelcome and put out by our requests but gave us a horrible dish recommendation and was pushing us out the door before we were all finished.   I had barely finished getting the steamed fish off its scales (as this dish came out considerably later than the others and it is my favorite) and they were putting down the orange slices.  Doesn't restaurant waiter etiquette demand that the last person be finished before the bill gets served?

These burgers absolutely succeed through the decadence of their ingredients rather than from any skill in flavor-matching or preparation.  This is fine as a value proposition though as Your Mom's only asks that you pay bar food prices, and unlike many bars, they will actually give you a heatlhy portion in exchange for the higher bar-food price.\\n\\nBurger highlight:\\nFrida Kahlo - Add a fried egg, pepper-jack cheese, avocado, and chorizo to your normal burger and you get by far the most interesting and most flavorful burger available on Your Mom's menu.  This was my first burger to try and my first burger to try again.  I highly recommend it.\\n\\nBurger lowlight:\\nMarie Laveau - I don't know if they screwed up on mine but I did not get anything that tasted Cajun. . .  this should be an out-there choice for people who love Cajun-cooking and I felt like I got a burger with a weird sauce on it.\\n\\nSides highlight:\\nTexas Wings - They do not serve you little-bitty chicken wings.  A Texas wing is a full-sized drum-stick.  The half-order is easily a meal.  I suggest their Chipotle Lime sauce as it is excellent, but avoid the blackened as they just throw the sauce on there instead of cooking it longer to give it that blackened/jerky touch.\\n\\nAlso, the sweet-potato fries are amazing and a reason all their own to order here.\\n\\nSides lowlight:\\nIf you order any type of fries in the large order, you are likely to get a half-order instead.  My guess is that half orders are easy for drivers to put together or are pre-made for them, as I've had to regularly call back to have the rest of my fries delivered.  This was extremely frustrating for the Irish Nachos that cost a good $7 for the full order.\\n\\nDelivery - Be prepared for a long-ish phone call if you choose to order delivery as you may get Mom (who is a wonderful, amazing person) but who definitely struggles with taking orders on the computer.  My deliveries have been reasonably fast and the drivers have all been friendly, but none of them ever have a pen for credit card orders.  This is easily remedied by paying with cash (faster on the phone too) but who carries cash anymore?\\n\\nI'm so happy that East Austin has another (and such a great) new option for delivery.

And I'm thrilled the decor looks so much better now :) It looks like they expanded and added industrial vent hoods at the tables for your Korean BBQ enjoyment... very nice touch! It was my BF first time, and he loved it too. \\n\\nOur food: we ordered Yuk-gae-jang (spicy beef broth, shredded beef, bean sprouts, egg, and potato noodles $13) and the kimchi stew (beef broth, tofu, kimchi in hot pot with pork/tuna $11/12). The Yuk-gae-jang was delicious, spicy, and hearty... very soothing especially on a cool day. The kimchi stew was a bit tangy/sour from the kimchi and not as spicy, but they can adjust the spice level to your liking. Most of their meals are accompanied with 6 different kinds of kimchi and rice. We were very satisfied :P\\n\\nThe service was good, but not great. Our waiter was friendly, but after we got our food he never checked on us.

I certainly don't fit into the mold of fitting in. I don't own any Lululemon, or Canucks apparel. I don't drive to Stanley Park on a Saturday morning for a jog nor read the nutrition levels in the back of the cereal box. Heck, give me the best tasting brunch in the morning, and throw some alcohol in the mix. I'll use my physique (6'2 200lbs) like a credit line on a credit card until I max it out. Why can't you throw everything in the deep fryer using buttermilk batter, it would probably taste better. I should really consider moving down south, they are probably more excepting in lifestyle choices.\\n\\nI arrived at Two Chefs and A Table. It's located at the boarder of Gastown where industrial, manufacturing, drugs and prostitution was the main economy in the 90's. It's so out of place for such a fancy restaurant. White exposed brick walls with contemporary chandeliers. Well... quoting Andrew Morrison, Strathcona is the new Yaletown. The formula is simple, find the most ghetto area you can and place a restaurant there. People are going to line up for hours waiting to get a seat in your restaurant that can host 30 max patrons, SUCCESS!\\n\\nI did in fact have to wait for a table. It was packed inside so I had to stand in the cold. As I had time to ponder, I was choosing between the organic grape tomato pureed, smoked salmon scrambled eggs, or do I want the low fat breakfast parfait with locally grown fruits? I better have a freshly squeezed orange juice as well.\\n\\n\\n\\nWe eventually made our way in and sat at the chef's table aka the bar counter, facing the open kitchen. As we were handed the menu, it continued the trend of a fancy restaurant. A legal sized piece of paper with less than a dozen of dishes on the menu, nothing is throwing me off anymore, or is it?\\n\\nI was reading down the list on the menu and that's when it struck me, I am being thrown off again. This isn't how my brunch story was supposed to go. I can have Chicken and Waffles in Vancouver for breakfast? I thought this only happens across the border heading way south.\\n\\n\\n\\n \\nChicken'n Waffles: Housemade waffles with pecan, vanilla butter and syrup. The buttermilk battered chicken was so soft, so juicy. The waffles were light, and the pecans added a crunchy texture. I am in love. I would have preferred it if they gave me more syrup, it tasted so good along with the vanilla butter.\\n\\n\\nPancakes: griddled in fluffy buttermilk, vanilla butter. orange marmalade, and maple syrup. Nothing fancy on the appearance. Just buttermilk pancakes that's every so fluffy. The orange marmalade was refreshing. I just didn't know why I didn't get any seasonal fruit, when the menu got my hopes up.\\n\\n\\nSunday Caesar: Celery salt, spring olives, house made beans. It wasn't Sunday, but who cares. Well salt rimmed glass with flavorful salt. Spicy cocktail paired with what I called an \\"impotent\\" bean.\\n\\n\\n\\nFrench Press Coffee: Not on the menu but everyone was ordering it. Large Bodum French Press with freshly grind coffee. It sure woke me up. It also made me want to invest in a French Press again, I missed that in the morning.\\n\\nTalk about being surprised in a good way. I woke up late, drove 30km for brunch in an industrial area only to be surprised by southern soul food. Two Chefs and A Table is a restaurant I want to revisit again. I am also glad that I have the option of going to their other location. I would feel a little sketchy having dinner in such an industrial area.

Wrong.  There was a group of 4 ahead of us and another person standing in front of the register next to us. The group ahead of us were taking awhile (no judgment), and the second cashier finished helping the person in the other line. I tried to make eye contact with her to see if we should approach her register, but she was more interested in chatting with another employee.  When the group ahead of us was done (and we still hadn't been acknowledged by the other cashier), we stepped up to the register and placed our order. The cashier who assisted us seemed distracted and not really happy.  Almost like we were imposing on his day. When we were done ordering we chose our table then realized the cashier had forgotten to give us one of our cups.  When I walked back up to the counter again, there were 4 employees standing around chatting.  I got the second cup and proceeded to get our sodas. All of the employees in this location seem more interested in goofing off and \\"riding the clock\\" than working.  It seemed like a very young staff and I don't remember seeing a manager walking around. Hopefully, we just caught them on an \\"off day\\" and this isn't the norm.\\n\\nThe food itself was good, and really is what's keeping me from giving this location 1 star.  We both ordered the Culver's Bacon Deluxe Burger meal with crinkle fries and a fountain soda. The burger was good-sized and tasty. The veggies on burger were fresh and the fries were perfect!  The burger was put together nicely...overall, a good presentation!\\n\\nThe dining room needed a little bit of attention as far as cleaning went...we were there around 12pm and the place was not busy.  There was an employee \\"cleaning\\" the same three booths near his family and/or friends as he kept chatting with them.

I've always been interested to stop by and give it a shot.  Finally, I stopped by to grab a bite...I was not very impressed.\\n\\nWhen you first sit down, they bring out a basket of what looks like homemade potato chips.  They seemed to be both soggy and crispy depending on where you took a bite (is that even possible)?  They were loaded with enough salt to drown out any flavor that might have been hiding underneath.\\n\\nThe salad I got along with my Chicken Marsala (more on that later) was alright at best.  The lettuce had some wilting going on and brown spots - there were a few specs of onion and one small grape tomato.  The dressing came on the side and was nothing particularly special.\\n\\nMy main course, Chicken Marsala, was unfortunately more of the same...meh.  There was a lot of food, but not much substance.  There were two huge pieces of chicken breast and a ton of angel hair pasta.  The chicken was very tough, prosciutto tasted more like thick cut ham, and overall there just wasn't much flavor.\\n\\nBased on the reviews, maybe I just hit this place on an off night, but I don't think I could recommend it.  For the food alone, I'd give it one star after this experience - but an extra star is for the excellent service.  Very quick, very friendly, and very nice.

I purchased a Groupon dinner for 4 (2 apps, 4 entrees, 2 desserts) so we could enjoy a Father's Day dinner there.  Disappointed from the get-go.\\n#1 - although there is NO stated limit on the price of entrees, we were informed by our server that the cut-off was $26, leaving my husband to choose either a $3 upcharge for the lamb chops, or something else from the menu.  Sadly, he chose the lamb skewers, which turned out to be tough.  He did not mention this to me until just now, as he felt it would have cast a pall on the evening,  #2 our appetizers and salads were brought to table at the same time, leaving us with little room to juggle the dishes around or to savor the individual course flavors on their own.  #3 my son's filet mignon, ordered medium rare, was quite rare indeed.  Our server was nowhere in sight and rather than wait for anothr brief return to the grill, he chose to eat it as presented.  #4 My mixed grill -two skewers each of chicken, kefte\\n, and beef, were all overcooked and dry.   Again, our server not available for 'how is everything', I ate in silence.  The kefte kabobs I make at home, IMHO, are superior.  The beef skewers tasted a bit 'off.'  I don't know, maybe it was the marinade, but I took one bite and left the rest.  #5 - our server could not locate the dessert menus and so had to recite the available desserts to us.  Confusing to say the least, but we opted for the flourless chocolate cake and the assorted baklava. The cake was more like a slice of fudge - very chocolatey and delicious - small, but filled with choclate goodness.  The baklava was uninspired.  We have enjoyed much better from homemade and from To Beirut.

I rather enjoy their slightly healthier options and I feel confident eating there knowing that I'll leave full and satisfied every time. This was my first time dining at the FB located in the Terminus building. I was slightly confused at first because when I was being directed to the location, I didn't know that it was actually inside of the building and I drove around a couple times before finding it. Then, once we inside of the parking deck there weren't any signs that specified where to park for the restaurant. \\n\\nThat aside, once we made it inside the restaurant it was THANKFULLY not crowded even though it was brunch-time on a Sunday. We were seated right away but the hostess did not smile ONE time the whole time we were there. And I checked every so often to see if she'd crack a smile but nah, son.  Bad day perhaps? Our waitress however was superb! I wish I'd gotten her name like I usually do to give credit where it's due but for some reason I forgot. Anyway, she was a beautiful, African American young lady with chin-length dark hair. She was pleasant, helpful, friendly and got our orders to us in a timely and accurate fashion. Much thanks to her! \\n\\nInside FBs are always beautiful with their bright and cheery decor featuring their angel baby mascot, sunflowers, fluffy white clouds floating in the clear aqua sky...it will make your day every time. But this location in particular is very beautiful because if you sit by the window you have a great view of the open seating area that I assume accommodates all the other restaurants in the building. I assume you can order your food and then sit outside in the courtyard and eat it? I'm not sure if you can do this at FB too but it's worth asking. They have a large TV screen out there as well and it's a very nice set-up that would be gorgeous on a nice day. \\n\\nThere's a Yelp check-in coupon for a free friend green tomato appetizer so be sure to take advantage. I'm not a big fried green tomato fan but my wife loves them so we have to have them every time. Disappointingly, these were not as good as we've had at FB in the past. There was something off with the batter this time. We also ordered our next favorite app which is their pimento cheese spread and it was, as usual, heavenly! I'm glad we only had to pay for THAT one instead of the fried green tomatoes. \\n\\nOur entrees came out quickly and steaming hot. Everyone's food looked great! I had the oven-fried chicken, collard greens and grilled mac and cheese. The collards were very good (even to someone like myself who isn't normally a fan), the grilled mac and cheese was also very tasty but I didn't like my chicken at all. I used to order this dish at other FBs in the past and loved it but I'm not sure if they changed the way they make the chicken or something because it just wasn't good. I know it's oven-fried and all but there was ZERO crisp and the batter was not tasty. The batter itself tasted moist while the chicken underneath it was dry--that's a problem. I did not enjoy it. I make oven-fried chicken at home that could run circles around this one that I paid $11 for. Come to think of it, the batter on the fried green tomatoes AND the batter on the chicken was problematic so I'm not sure if this is just the new batter they're going with at all locations or if someone at this location just cannot cook battered foods. \\n\\nOverall, I enjoyed my visit but had to knock off points for the confusion with finding the place, the unfriendly hostess, terrible chicken and the not so yummy fried green tomatoes. \\n\\nP.S. The biscuits they serve with almost every meal are still delicious and that apple butter steals the show every time--yum! And I must mention the peach covered oatmeal pancakes!

After no one acknowledged anyone in the line, I asked if someone was seating guests. We were told that there was a sign in at the other entrance, so we walked over and had to find someone keeping a waiting list. We were told the wait was 50 minutes.

I am pretty familiar with Clarkston so I was interested to see what eating there would be like. It's in the same strip as Thriftown and Kathmandu Kitchen (which I also need to try). This place looks super sketchy, so if you're a stickler for ambiance, your standards will not be met. Inside of Shewit isn't too bad, though. \\n\\nThe menu is a bit small (especially compared to Desta or Queen of Sheba) but I'm guessing that everything on it is good.  I ordered the kilwa (spicy stewed beef), my friend got the veg platter, and my other friend got the stewed chicken. All of it was really really good. Plenty of injera and my kilwa was nice and spicy. They have non spicy options as well. \\n\\nNote of caution: This may not be a great place for Ethiopian cuisine newbies. My husband claims injera gives him a stomach ache and Desta's menu has many more options, like rice to sub injera. I get the feeling at Shewit you would probably just get what is on the menu--which would be delicious anyway. \\n\\nThe portions were quite large--i was pleasantly surprised. I showed some restraint for once and actually had some to take home. Also, the prices are suuuuuper reasonable. In the end, totally worth it, even without the Scoutmob.

The first visit we ventured in around 5 to find the interior dining area almost empty. Next visit we arrived later eventually snagging a spot designated for the happy hour crowd without waiting 45 minutes for a table. \\n\\nI have to admit some of the adult beverage offerings at least by description sounds completely unappealing. I was immediately proved wrong on the first visit when I ordered the Wallow pairing a blood orange margarita with Fireman's 4. The next visit a Curly tail with serrano ice cubes was all I could talk about the next day. \\n\\nHappy hour vittles consumed included roasted bone marrow, fried green tomatoes with guacamole, triple duck fat fries, and fried goat cheese fritters with tomato jam. Attention all followers, this is why I eat out. My grandma Flemmie could have reproduced that jam with some mason jars and a pressure cooker. I instead opt not to spend my $$'s at Sur La Table and let professionals do their craft.\\n\\nThe duck fat fries were crisp beyond comprehension. Like leave them alone for an hour and they would still be a five star dish. The bone marrow sported a mix of herbs that produced generous flavors; the crisp tomatoes paired with guacamole..tomato jam..OMG. Prolly some of the best apps to be had anywhere. \\n\\nNext visit I tried the oyster boudin fritters and for my entree the pork blade steak. The wife electing to try some sides as she isn't always interested in pork products. Fritters bordering on cajun genius, the Morrocan honey sauce and bitter arugula on the blade steak was a remarkable combination. Equal praise for the green chili grits and the mashed taters with neck bone gravy.\\n\\nService was attentive even on the second visit when we were basically thrown in a corner with a small counter facing the patio area.

I wanted to charge the restaurant for the time I had to wait for service and for the preparation of the bill.  The restaurant bill was wrong and all screwed up. One meal served was cold that should have been hot. The pork chop with vinegar and cherry peppers that I ordered was weird :1/2 inch thick with cold cherry peppers.

The green beans tasted HORRIBLE. As if they were drenched in water overnight, then taken out and put in the microwave.

Did I mention the place was less than half full? And yet LIKE ALWAYS, we were seated in the back at one of the tiny little tables, crammed in between 2 other parties.\\n\\nAfter waiting another 10 minutes to be acknowledged by our waiter (he was very busy talking to the other waiters behind the counter), we ordered an ice cream sundae.  Now, I'm not a professional chef, but I'm pretty good at following instructions. The menu describes the sundae as having ice cream, hot fudge and whipped cream. So, we assumed our sundae would appear with ice cream, hot fudge and whipped topping. Seems pretty reasonable doesn't it?\\n\\nNO.\\n\\nA person that was not our waiter rushed passed our table, slamming down a bowl of vegan ice cream and hot fudge and was gone before either of us could even look down to see that there was no whipped cream on top. Sadly, we had to interrupt our waiter who was very busy checking his hair in the mirror. When we asked him for whipped cream, he gave us a sort of incredulous look and repeated the request as though we had just asked for tartar sauce or something.... \\n\\nThe GOOD thing about this recent visit to veggie galaxy was that the ice cream had an odd sort of after-taste and it wasn't creamy like it usually is. Why is that good? Because now I will NEVER have to feel as though I am missing out on something good at VG because, unless the restaurant gets sold and changes out every single employee and their entire business model, I am NEVER going back there again.  \\n\\n####\\n\\nI've been struggling with whether or not to publish this review since my last 2 visits to Veggie Galaxy (about a month ago), but after my visit this morning I'm going to post.\\n\\nVG used to be one of my favorite places; just thinking about the mid-century style glass case of vegan desserts made me smile. But something has changed and it becomes more and more evident on every visit.\\n\\nThe once friendly staff is unpleasant, inattentive, and often just downright rude. The service is extremely slow and the once amazing vegan food is no longer amazing. The most obvious difference, though, you'll notice as soon as you walk in the door. The diner will be only 3/4 full - the counter completely empty - and yet the wait time will be 45 minutes, even without a full crowd in the waiting area. \\n\\nOn my most recent visit, we waited nearly an hour even though the restaurant was never more than 3/4 full. When we finally got seated, we were walked past the empty counter and past an empty mini-booth (which we were told was \\"reserved\\" when we asked if we could sit in it) down to the back to one of the tiny tables wedged in between two already seated parties. \\n\\nThen we waited... And waited... And finally ordered. Then ate our less than spectacular food but ordered dessert because, let's face it, where else can you find such a large variety of vegan desserts? Then we waited... And waited... Then our waitress dropped off dessert and immediately disappeared before we could even tell her it was the wrong dessert! We were heading to a movie so I didn't make a big fuss. I had to walk up front to get our check, paid it and left (yea, we still left a tip)\\n\\nThis was not the Veggie Galaxy I remember and it makes me sad because it used to be such a fun place to go :(\\n\\nAddendum:\\n\\nRepeat performance on today's visit. \\n\\nFinally we just asked why we couldn't grab 2 empty seats at the counter and were told they weren't \\"set up\\" yet. The counter was clean, but apparently putting down the napkin and flatware was a lengthy process? Who knows?\\n\\nAgain we were seated way back squished between 2 already seated parties even though there was an empty (and by then, set up) counter as well as 2 open mini-booths. \\n\\nSo, we just got up and left. Not worth it. Going out to breakfast should be a good experience.

I looked it up online and downloaded the app to my phone.  I thought it strange that it said the location didn't deliver.  I found some online specials that I liked and called.\\n\\nThe person answering the phone told me that they would deliver but that the specials were online order only.  As online and delivery were not a valid combination she told me to order online then call to have the order changed from carry out to delivery.  Really a waste of time for me and them but why should I pay more than necessary?  So I ordered online then called.  I was on hold for nearly 5 minutes to wait for the delivery update.\\n\\nThen the food arrives.  The driver quotes the wrong price (she said $35 and change).  I know I paid online so I don't really focus on it.  I gave her a few dollars tip.\\n\\nThen she comes back and telling me I didn't pay.  We have a whole conversation in front of my house that takes about 10 minutes, including her calling the store twice and me showing her the above receipt on my phone.  At this point, I wish I would have just given the order back and gotten something from somewhere else.  I don't even know yet if I was charged twice (once for the original order and once for the order with the 2.75 delivery fee) but I bet I was and will have to call my bank.\\n\\nOnce I finally try the pizza - it was AWFUL.

I did not want to talk about this further as I have already wasted a fair deal of my time.  I also have provided all the details in my email so there is nothing else to discuss.  Lastly, Julie was well aware of the situation at the time as 1) she was the person who told me to order online and call back and was also; 2) the person the driver called with the question about my payment.

The ambiance is pretty different, you can either eat outside, in their main building which is looks like a more fine dining atmosphere, or you can eat in the back  in their adjacent building, which seems a little more laid back.\\n\\nOn my first visit I had their boudin balls with oyster, which were pretty tasty, but nothing too outstanding. For their main I had the pork steak with Moroccan honey, which was delightful. The honey gave this dish an amazing sweetness without overwhelming the steak. Oh and by the way it actually tasted like beef, delicious and would look forward to ordering it again. \\n\\nOn my second visit I went to their happy hour which is not to be missed, their blood orange margaritas are outstanding and for an extra dollar you can boost it up a little with grand marnier. I also had their rosemary piglet, which is a drink that has pomegranite juice, frozen rosemary syrup with bits of rosemary in it, and bubbles. The presentation for this cocktail is pretty cool as well as delicious.  For appetizers I had their Brussels sprout leaves, which were delicious. They were both salty and sweet and well a crunchy. Totally awesome!  I am not one for deviled eggs since I think that hard boiled eggs kind of stink, but I decided to try them out, and honestly they were pretty good, not something that I would willingly order because of my bias, but they were good.  I also ordered the pate on a crustini, which was pretty good, but not for those that are faint of heart. It is a very strong spread, so you want to go easy on it, but it really was delicious. \\n\\nOh my third visit, I decided for the pork shoulder and it was delicous. The presentation was on a pot with the shoulder and this delicous sauce. The shoulder was perfectly cooked and incredibly tender. The sauce complimented the meat in a way that it just made this dish sing. Along with it came some mashed potatoes, some veggies and, a a fried egg. Just awesome. Oh and their bananas foster beignets are like something made by angels.

It has its strong points: I hear the egg-based omelettes are quite good, and their burgers etc. can be quite good as well. Their selection is also respectably large and all vegan-customize-able. \\n\\nBut the last two times I've been disappointed with my breakfast. Here's the deal: they need to drop the 'tofu egg' circle patty things and bring out the tofu scramble. The 'tofu egg' patties are lame, not particularly tasty, they don't look especially appetizing, and they're far inferior to a proper tofu scramble. Get rid of them. They're embarrassing to eat, and probably more embarrassing to serve. \\n\\nAlso, garnish the plate more. I know, I know; I sound picky. But it's true: when you get a plate--a breakfast plate, at that; the breaking of the overnight fast--you want it to be big, generous, heaping. Breakfast foods are generally cheap. We're talking potatoes and eggs here (or tofu in my case; but still--don't tell me you can't buy that stuff in mega-bulk). When the plate comes, I don't want to see 2/5 of white plate under my food. I want to see a big, heaping, generous pile of potatoes pushed up against a fluffy, moist looking pile of to-scram, with toast barely hanging on to the edge of the plate (oh, by the way, two pieces of toast cut into halves, not one piece cut into halves--come on...), and, yes, perhaps a garnish.

It is exactly his sort of place: Nothing fancy, decorated with mismatched furniture, plastered with posters and advertisements for local performances and such. It's a hipster caf√©, but like a real one, before being a hipster was cool. It is far enough out of the city that, though parking options are limited to the street, we experienced no difficulty locating a spot. \\n\\nThe menu is surprisingly extensive, not limited to merely pastries or prepared items. They had those too, but also sandwiches, and more traditional breakfasts like scrambles, waffles, even acai bowls. They have lunch options too: sammies, hand pies, salads, soup. The variety of drinks was even more expansive, and beyond the expected and varying coffee preparations, you will find smoothies, milkshakes, affrogato...even beer and cider.\\n\\nI ended up getting a granola bowl with yogurt, adding berries on top. It was fine, consisting of plain Greek yogurt and microwaved frozen berries. The granola was average, and way more than I needed. I would just ask for yogurt and berries alone the next time. My husband paired an extremely grassy matcha latte with a breakfast sammie, and was pleased.\\n\\nI don't know if she was THE Anna Banana, but the one-woman show running this establishment impressively took orders, prepared and served food and drinks with alacrity and charm. This place seemed full of regulars, and I can understand why.

Just like it's spelled.  Not Athens like the city in Greece.\\n\\nSo I created a Yelp profile just so I can rave about how great I think Athan's is.  Some may think the Brookline store is at an awkward  location.  Yes, Brookline is a little out of the way verses the central of Boston but it's great for all those living in the area, including myself.  It's right by a few restaurants, boutiques, a Tai Chi studio, and Movie Works diagonally across the street - it's hard to not pick something up on your home.  The ambiance of the bakery is great.  When you walk in, there is an area to order and walk around to see what cookies, pastry, or sandwich you might want.  If you look up, you'll see this big old chandelier with candles, teacups, and tea pots hanging from it.  Then you walk to the next room to pick up your drink and if time allows, table and chairs to relax.  When I go there during the day, I like to sit near the big windows and people watch.  The only con is during the evening when the lighting is not bright enough, but this I can do without as long as I get my chocolate croissant and mocha.

Shula's 347 was supposed to be that place.\\n\\nLike all of the Dolphins teams in recent memory (sorry I'm a Pats fan) Shula's fell short. What I had hoped would be a crowded, hip lunch area was almost empty. The chrome and black interior screamed year 2001 and it seemed more like a hotel restaurant in a nice part of the lobby...oh wait, it was.\\n\\nOur food was pretty good, but not better than say our experiences at Houston's/Hillstone for similar money. My wife happily ate her Filet, but commented that Houston's and even Colorado's was more to her preference. I went with the steak sandwich. It was also very tasty but not something that I would streak across town to have again.\\n\\nThe server was very nice making appropriate selections and making sure our order was correct. She also came by to bring plenty of drinks and was probably the best part of the lunch.\\n\\nSince it was my first time at Shula's I wanted to look around a little during our meal, but the high seat backs and wall isolated me from having any sort of feel for the place. I guess that sort of privacy is important for some people but I like to look.\\n\\nWould I go to Shula's again? Probably not unless I was asked to meet a work colleague there.

Served in small mason jars, good for sharing with one other person but perfectly fine just devouring yourself.  We had 2 apple crisps, red velvet cake, and s'mores.\\nI loved the red velvet cake.  Actually, all the desserts were good.  So, overall, Abby Lane is not so bad but still needs to work out the jitters.\\n\\nAfter dinner, we went upstairs for a night cap.

The chicken livers were prepared perfectly; not undercooked and not overcooked or rubbery. The crab fritter was a bit salty at first bite but actually improved as it cooled. The trout was very fresh and well complimented by the broth which seemed to be fennel & butter /cream. Not so much a cucumber vinaigrette.

Pepe's gets closer to it than most of the other places around here, but after coming here a few times it is clear downtown is still lacking a great Mexican spot.  There are definitely some positives to this place.  For instance, I love the Habanero Sauce as it packs some serious heat and is exactly what you'd be looking for if you were ordering a Habanero Sauce.  I've had the beef and carne asada tacos here several times and they were always good (there are some good Taco Tuesday deals here to take advantage of, by the way).  The facility itself is nice as it is in one of the old Church Street buildings near the train station.  But there are enough negatives here that I can't give it more than a 3.  For instance, the sides (rice and beans) are not impressive at all, and one time they even gave us a batch of refried beans that had clearly been sitting out there forever as they were dry and clumpy.  The drinks haven't been anything special so far - I haven't had much yet, but I wasn't impressed with their House Margarita, which basically tastes like some of the pre-made stuff you pick up from Publix.  The service here also can take quite some time; on multiple occasions I've had situations where I was left waiting forever, especially when getting your check and paying.  Your best bet, by far, is to sit at the bar as the bartenders have been far more attentive in my experience (and on gamedays, they have even been willing to change the games they have on to accommodate your preferences).  Overall, this is a good casual place for grabbing lunch or if you really need to get your Mexican fix in for dinner - both at the bar - but I wouldn't suggest it for table service or a nice business or date event."},{"name":"Twyrl Pasta Bistro","address":"315 Broadway","city":"Arlington","stars":"4.5","text":"Mila, our server, was amazing!

Server was very beer-knowledgable and really honest (he rushed out to give us a $20 bill my wife had apparently dropped from her purse).  The food however was really pretty awful, I am sorry to report.  My wife had a green salad -not bad - and the lobster roll, whose roll was stale and the salad was just really bland and watery.  I had the beet salad - just some chopped up roasted beets, some raw walnut pieces straight from the bag, boring lettuce, some feta, and a eye-wateringly sour vinegary dressing.  Not the best execution of the beet salad classic, fair to say.  Then came the fish and chips - another badly executed pub classic: over-crispy thick breading over mushy breading and flavorless fish that tasted frozen.  C'mon, guys, this is Boston - no excuses for bad seafood plates!  The fries were also over-fried to the point they would break a dental crown if you weren't careful.  My wife's sweet potato fries on the other hand were underdone - crunchy underdone - not cool for sweet potato anything.  Her sour ale was really good and I was happy with my Ithaca Flower Power IPA, though it was slightly over-hopped (not the restaurant's fault obviously).

There are also several options if you don't feel like a burger such as a Rueben sandwich, a pork tenderloin sandwich and a pot roast sandwich. The fries are basic crinkle cut fries. Nothing on 5guys there, but good nonetheless. I was impressed by the quality and value so I decided to go back for lunch today to try something else off the menu. I had a Pork tenderloin sandwich, cheese curds and the custard of the day (caramel cashew) The sandwich was very good. The cashier explained that the sandwich comes without toppings and asked if I would like to add any. I added lettuce, tomato and mayo. It was hot and crispy when I received it and the meat was tender and juicy. The custard was also very good. Similar to soft serve ice cream, but with a richer more dense consistency. It had a caramel sauce and LOTS of cashews! The cheese curds are like little fried mozzarella stick bites. Service was friendly and efficient. You order at the counter, they give you a number to put on your table, then you sit and enjoy the free WiFi and someone will find you and bring your food.

We ended up going to the counter and ordering. They gave us a number and we sat down at a nearby table, although weren't sure if it was part of the \\"restaurant\\" or the \\"cafe\\" area. \\n\\nWe ordered the yuzu matcha soda and the mango matcha soda, as well as the melon pan. The mango matcha soda was amazing!! It was quite sweet but I loved it! The yuzu was just ok. It was very strongly lemony, almost Lysol-y. Both drinks were $5, way overpriced especially when more than half the glass was ice. The melon pan was also not very impressive. Small portion size, tasted like a mild sweet bread. I've never had melon pan before and thought it would have melon flavor (It does not).\\n\\nThe reason this place is worth 4 stars is the decor and ambiance. They sure did a beautiful job with renovations because Gen Sou En is a serene retreat complete with zen lighting, lush greenery, and relaxing seating. If you can manage to snag a table by the tree near the checkout counter definitely sit there! The seats were these cool wicker lounge seats and they surround a large tree and plant area.

The less than glowing reviews of this place are shocking to me!\\n\\nI work at Peachtree Center and per my other reviews, try to avoid the larger chain lunch options, and support small business.  Though when trying to find it on Yelp it appears they aren't TOO TOO small, they are all over the city.  But still, when compared to Subway, ChickFilA and DQ, they are small beans.\\n\\nAnother reviewer did mention their cold cut sandwich maybe being nothing spectacular or anything to write home about.  True that.  I got a super basic turkey sandwich once and it was just that, super basic.  But someone tipped me off that their speciality sandwiches are where it is at.  Enter the Swimmer.  Or \\"Sweemer\\" as pronounced by the order taker.  Tuna salad with a thin slice of provolone, a few healthy slices of perfectly ripened avacado, lettuce, tomato and barely a splash of thousand island dressing.  The thousand island dressing is VERY light and not the scary, globby stuff from the 70s.  I think it is made in house, as they sell it by the bottle there.\\n\\nThe service is beyond friendly - I have ended up a little short or trying to use a credit card for under the minimum purchase - no problem.

The last time I was here, I'd gone to Mickelwaith. This time around? Well, the original plan was Franklin. However, since Franklin had unfortunately burned down, we decided to go for la Barbecue.\\n\\nMy journey had started back in Houston. A few days prior to coming here, I had attempted to put in a pre-order for our meats. Their website says that pre-orders must be placed at least 5 days in advance. I did just that and within the hour, I received a response back telling me that they had been fully booked for the weekend. Bummer! It is understandable though since it was ACL weekend after all. The lesson here is, even if you want to pre-order, make sure that you do it way in advance and not the minimum five days required, mmkay?\\n\\nAnyway, I decided to brave myself and stand in line to get a taste of what LB had to offer. I arrived around 10:20 am and there was already a pretty long line going. If I had to guesstimate, I would say that there was already around 40-50 people waiting in line. If you come early enough, you'd be lucky to wait inside the restaurant where the AC is blowing cold. However, I was pretty late so I got to stand outside. Fortunately, the La Barbecue team was kind enough to provide tents for the people waiting in line to hide from the sun.\\n\\nI don't have to tell you about the free beer but I will anyway. Yes, they have free beer, but you have to go in to get it. If you were like me and you were all by your lonesome in line, that could be quite challenging. Not an issue for me anyway since I didn't really feel like beer that morning. But note to self, bring at least one friend to wait in line with you.\\n\\nSo I waited in line for approximately 2 hours. They didn't open until 11 am so part of my wait time was for them to open. But do understand that while I was waiting, the line grew A LOT longer to maybe 100-125 people before they opened.\\n\\nI placed my order to go because my festival buddies were lazy bastards who were still sleeping in while I was miserable waiting in line trying to get some good Q. I ordered 2.5 lbs of brisket, 1.5 lbs of pork ribs, 3/4-lbs of pulled pork, 1 beef rib, 1 link, 1 chipotle link, pint of potato salad, pickles, and chipotle slaw. \\n\\nAs I was placing my order, I did ask the guy cutting the meats to give me more burnt-ends and fatty brisket (like I always do at other BBQ joints) and his response was: \\"I'll give you whatever I have\\". A bit of a let down with that response since other joints never had an issue with my request, but oh well. He did give me a good amount anyway, so this became a non-issue. \\n\\nNow what about the flavor? Let's just say that almost everything was 5/5. Brisket was totally on point - smoky, tender, full of flavor. Totally gave me a \\"oh wow, that's some f'ing good brisket\\" moment as soon as I bit into the meat. The pork ribs and the links were the same way. The beef rib, however, although still very delicious, it seemed a bit dry to me. I was expecting a fall-off-the-bone tender, but this wasn't the case. As for the pulled pork, I thought (and my friend did too) that Mickelwaith's pulled pork was a tad better.\\nThe sides were all really good but the main point here is the meats. I do have to tell you that the pickles do have a kick to it so keep that in mind.\\n\\nAll in all, La Barbecue definitely knows how to barbecue; and to barbecue really well. I wouldn't hesitate to come back here, but I will have better planning next time and I will place my pre-order weeks in advance to avoid having to wait in line like I did this time.\\nIf you're planning on coming out to Austin and you know you want some good Q, go ahead and place your order online. You won't regret it."},{"name":"Salty Sow","address":"1917 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Absolutely love this place.  One of my favorite restaurants in Austin, and if you come here during their happy hour, the menu is an absolute steal.  Favorites?  Honey rosemary fried chicken and duck fat fries.  Hands down some of the best stuff you will ever eat, and both of them are only $4 each during happy hour!  If you're a meat and cheese kind of person, they also have an excellent charcuterie.  With respect to drinks, got some good blood orange frozen margaritas and a pretty nice beer selection as well.\\n\\nTheir entrees, however, are where the magic happens.  Check out their daily specials - they don't disappoint.  Where else can you get a filet, duck confit, and scallop special for $20?  Also, their candied pork belly is absolutely to die for.  It's got an amazing sugar crust, and the pork belly meat itself probably the best I've ever had.  And believe you me, I've had a LOT of pork belly.  \\n\\nDo yourself a favor and swing by - happy hour if you can.  It's got a great Austin vibe.

The hostess didn't greet us, just asked how many and if we had a reservation (which we didn't have). And when we answered, she just walked over to a table and and stood there with like the stinkiest face ever. She honestly looked like she hated her job, like she was just done, and business hours had just started. Our order was taken with an attitude and low patience.

I knew the day would come...\\n\\nOn the way to our local dive bar, we decided to take a risk and see what this Nancy's Eat & Browse was all about. We'd passed it a hundred times and always wondered: what exactly are you \\"browsing\\" at? Is there a small petting zoo inside the joint? No, I guess in that case, it'd be called an \\"Eat & Pet\\", which it wasn't. That would just be unsanitary...\\n\\nWell in all honesty, this isn't really the sort of place you want to \\"browse\\" at for too long. There's not much to look at anyhow. The bartender seemed shy and really had to force herself into small talk. The TV program was obtrusive. And one corner of the bar was dark and filled with unidentifiable junk that'd just been tossed and stored there.\\n\\nThe owner, who's had the place for somewhere around thirty years, sat at a nearby table, reading the paper. When we pulled out some die to play 10,000, she glared at us, pursed her lips, and scornfully asked, \\"You two aren't gambling over there, are you? That's not allowed here.\\" Certainly, being two young persons, with dice, we MUST have been up to no good. Of course.\\n\\nWe uncomfortably finished our beers, and shimmied on out of there as soon as we could.\\n\\nThe other disconcerting thing about Nancy's: the smell. I've been a long time smoker, so I'm pretty used to the smell of cigarettes saturated into walls. But this was a good four months after the indoor smoking ban, and the place reeked strongly enough of cigarettes for me to have a pounding headache for hours after leaving. \\n\\nThe one good thing I can say about the place is that their breakfast menu pricing has probably been the same since they opened in the 70s. $0.75 for an egg?

The ribs were (i swear I am not embellishing) the worst ribs I have ever seen.  ever. anywhere.  ever.  for me it is embarrassing, if i owned this restaurant i would be sad, but truthfully everything comes from the top down so i fully expect the management to be as bad if not worse than the food itself.  oh and for a lovely parting shot for the soon to be gone claremont, it smells like a giant urinal cake.  Claremont no one is pulling for you harder than me, but you make it impossible, with the worst food I have eaten in some time.  Why go here when for similar prices you can go to 15 other places that actually try a bit.  And whoever gives this good ranking is lying or has no tastebuds, if you think this is good food then come over to my house and I'LL OPEN SOME CANS THROW THE FOOD AT YOU AND ASK FOR 50 BUCKS."},{"name":"Spinners","address":"14106 N Interstate 35","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Great place to chill with friends. \\nThey have pool and DJ \\nGreat food.  \\nNice hangout"},{"name":"Ceili's Modern Irish Pub","address":"7311 Westminster Highway","city":"Richmond","stars":"3.5","text":"Nice to sit on out the patio on a sunny afternoon.

We waited about 20 minutes for our food to come out.  The next round took less time because the computers were working again, but some while later we decided we would order dessert and ten minutes after ordering our waiter came to inform us that he hadn't been able to place the dessert order yet because the computers were down again, but, if we wanted, he could hand write the order and give it to the kitchen (huh?), where they would have no doubt whipped the mason jar of butterscotch pudding out of the refrigerator! We were rather fed up by this point (1.5 hours since we had arrived) that we opted for the check, which he couldn't produce either because of the computers. We waited another 10 minutes to get our check. The food we sampled - fried chicken and carnitas - were quite tasty and ample portions. The drinks - a Salty Sow, a Rosemary Piglet, and a New York Sour (something we didn't really order but what we ordered off the HH drink menu got lost in translation and ended up, conveniently, costing us almost double the HH drinks) - were top notch, if a little light on the alcohol content.

And, like others said, Coolidge Corner really needed a true bar like this. But while the bar is a great addition, the food just doesn't measure up to what you can get for the same price elsewhere in the neighborhood. \\n\\nTo start with the positive, the layout and feel of the place is fantastic. There's a busy bar area downstairs and a quieter dinning area above. The vibe is nice but casual, and the service is very friendly. You could come here for drinks after work, on a date, or with your kids. Trying to cover all those bases sounds crazy, but somehow they make it work.\\n\\nBeer, not surprisingly is also a strength. There are a ton of taps, with maybe an equal number of bottles. The selection is not quite as good as at the Publick House, but it's still pretty top-notch. More descriptions of the beers on the menu would be nice, especially as the servers seem fairly unsure of themselves when making recommendations (although they do seem to be getting better now that the place has been open longer). \\n\\nThe whiskey menu also looks good, but I've never tried it, so I can't say much. Same with the cocktails. They look interesting, but I haven't had more than one, so I can't say.\\n\\nThe wine unfortunately is a bit of a letdown. Given that the owners also run Coolidge Corner Wine & Spirits, you'd think the wine by the glass should be good. You'd be mistaken. It's not bad, but this is definitely a place to drink beer, not wine. \\n\\nAs for the food, it's fine, but that's about it. Given the local competition, it should either be better or cheaper. The burger, for example, is decent enough, but it's not especially tasty or interesting. For the same price you can get much better at Regal Beagle, Matt Murphy's, Fireplace, etc.. Same with the other sandwiches, salads, and entrees that I've tried. The Scotch eggs are different and pretty good, however, and I've heard good things about the fried chicken, so maybe if you stick to the most unusual items on the menu, you'll do better.\\n\\nOverall, it's a great place to come for a beer, but I'd go somewhere else if you're looking for a meal."},{"name":"Southside Flying Pizza","address":"2206 S Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"So they immediately lose a star for serving their drinks in Styrofoam cups.

The main reason was because of the brisket - it was very fatty - so much so it almost made me rethink being a carnivore. The sausage was okay but the skins were super tough. The cole slaw and potato salad were also \\"just okay\\". The sauce was super sweet and didn't wander too far away from catsup, which I'm guessing was the main ingredient.

It really had potential. \\n\\nI'm American and my husband is Brazilian.  So going out for Brazilian food is a necessity for us.  Haha! We usually go to the place in Quincy but we thought we would try somewhere new.  After finding a Groupon I thought this was perfect. \\nWe got there MUCH earlier than expected and the Groupon says dinner.  We were there for lunch. So, we didn't even bother to tell the server we had it because we figured it wasn't valid. And we'll just use it next time.  No biggie.  \\n\\nWell, we walk in and were greeted right away.  We ended up being the only people there.  This was around 3pm.  After we were seated the server gave us menus and took our drink orders a few minutes later.   All good.  And then we waited.   For awhile.  My husband ordered a Budweiser and she brought back a draft.  We thought that was strange as most places don't have Bud on draft.  After his first sip he said it was most definitely not Bud.  But, we're restaurant people so we didn't want to complain about it.  \\n\\nHe ordered the Rodizio and I just had the hot/cold bar.   The selection on the bar is MUCH better at our usual pace in Quincy.  So I was a bit disappointed.  And when the meat for my husband came around, it was weird because the girl serving us brought it.  I've been a bartender/server for years and would not know how to properly cut meat and neither did this girl.  She butchered it.  My husband was less than thrilled.  He was almost offended.  :-)\\n\\nWhen it comes time for the check she comes over, drops it and walks away.  Didn't say anything other than \\"here's your check\\".  That's normal in most places but the reason it really pissed us off in this case is because she ADDED GRATUITY! Never mentioned that, did ya, server girl?  I see the total is $59 and some change.  We were talking.  I never really check out a bill anyhow.  I give her a $14 tip. Remember, we're restaurant people.  I total the charge slip and all is good.  \\n\\nI'm waiting for my husband to finish what we assume was Bud Light and I happened to glance down at the check and see there was an 18% gratuity added.  $8.  So, had I not noticed, this girl would have made a $22 tip on a $50 check.  What??!!  \\n\\nI've been in the business for 20 years now.  This is a classic way servers scam people to make more money.

It took two years for me to write it. I went to Applebee's with a couple of friends on a Monday night. This was our former hangout on Monday nights. We went in at around 5PM. The attendant brought us to our tables. A little later, the waitress came. She asked us what drinks we wanted. I said I wanted a \\"Fizzler,\\" or something along those lines. She did not know what that was. So I had to show her. She must have been a new waitress. Anyway, 15 minutes went by and we still did not receive our drinks. We spent most of the time waiting. It was almost hilarious at how bad the service was. At one time, she sat down next to us, and said, \\"you are not in a hurry are you?\\" I could not believe it. It happened that there was a leak in the kitchen, however, they did not have the sense to let us know that, and instead we were waiting. I don't know why we did not have the sense to get up and leave like others did, as this waitress kept on coming back another 10 minutes later as if nothing was wrong. In fact the way we found out about the leak is that we overheard them speaking. It was not until 7PM that we left, and my friends and I decided that we would never go to that Applebee's again."},{"name":"Chipotle Mexican Grill","address":"6210 W Irlo Bronson Memorial Hwy","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"2.5","text":"I use to really like this Chipotle when I first moved here.... not anymore.

I was pretty shocked at how flavorless and bland everything was. Even the salsa and tortilla chips needed salt. We ordered the cauliflower appetizer which was most definitely not $9 worthy. The burrito was odd flavors and ingredients. I had the poblano relleno which wasn't even warm, the rice wasn't cooked all the way and had absolutely NO flavor whatsoever. The beans tasted like canned refried beans.  I rarely post comments and I hate to be that person who had a bad experience but I have to say this was over the top unpleasant.

We (a group of 12) came in around 10, and while all other restaurants were packed, hooters was empty! Yay us! We waited about 15 minutes for a table, which isn't to be fussed about when you walk in without calling ahead, with 12 people. Once we sat down, our server, Savannah, came and took our drink and food order. She did very well with getting our drinks to us, but after we ordered it seemed like service ended. We waited 20 minutes for the appetizers, which we wouldn't have gotten unless we had asked the server about them. By the way, it's not like we were waiting for cooked food. We had ordered nachos and pretzels. This should not take 20 minutes to prep and run in an EMPTY restaurant. One of the people from our party walked to the restroom and saw his plate sitting in the window while our apps weren't even out yet. After asking about our apps, they immediately came out, followed by our food about a minute later. The food was what should be expected from a cheap sports bar. I don't go to hooters expecting amazing food, but my boyfriends plate, the one that had been in the window, came out with hard Mac n cheese and the food just tasted like metal. Other orders came out slightly messed up, but like I said, what do you expect. I really want management to start paying attention to their servers and they NEED to start table touching every table in the restaurant, as I feel that if the manager had made a routine table greeting, we wouldn't have had this problem.

Overall, for a gourmet burger and fries, it was OK.\\n\\nThe thing that will keep me from returning, though, is the 360 degree panorama of self-promotion.  You literally cannot escape from signs informing you that someone in New York, Pennsylvania, Virginia, or Florida thinks that Five Guys is the best restaurant on the planet.  Maybe the restaurant attracts insecure people who need to have their restaurant choice validated.  In my experience, if someone goes out of their way to tell you they're great - they're not really that great.

I checked out Yelp.com and discovered this place on the \\"Hot New Businesses\\" list and decided to check it out.\\n\\nWhen I arrived I was staring at the menu for few seconds when Shyam, the proprietor of the cart, stuck his head out and asked if I'd been there before.  I replied \\"no\\" and he started to explain the menu items, the food options I could mix and match, the way he prepares the food, et-cetera.  He was very friendly and informative!  Under Shyam's recommendation I ordered the lamb and pan-fried noodles with a medium/hot spice level.  He obliged and started making my lunch fresh from scratch.  A few minutes later he asked me over to the window to taste my food and see if it was spicy enough.  YES, he actually held the pan out the window with a plastic fork and had me taste-test my food before he put it on the plate.  Amazing!!!  Shyam is on a whole other level of providing customer service here.  I left here thinking \\"Did we just become best friends?\\"\\n\\nThis place gets 5/5 stars for hitting a homerun in every department.

Carmelina's service and food were exceptional.  Tip:  make reservations as this quaint restaurant fills up quickly. The day before we wanted to go, OpenTable did not show any openings, however, when we called the restaurant directly, they had availability.  Our party of 4 was seated immediately after they opened at noon. There was a basket of fresh rolls and a dish of olive oil and balsamic vinegar waiting, and fresh waters for the table arrived immediately after we sat down.  Our server, Amy, was attentive, and there was one other person who kept our waters filled and table cleared throughout our meal.  We were never rushed and everyone we encountered was super friendly.  The Baby Eggplant app was fantastic, it didn't take long for the 4 of us to devour it.  The Garlic Shrimp took a bit longer than expected, however, was worth the wait.  Our server brought over additional rolls without us asking, and boy were we glad she did!  Once the shrimp disappeared, we dipped the rolls in the garlic butter.  Yum!  The mushroom rigatoni was exceptional.  Pasta cooked perfectly, generous portion of everything.  As this comes in a baked dish, they were not able to offer a half portion, however, there are other things on the menu they can accommodate so don't be shy and ask.  The Puttanesca and Carbonara dishes were also very tasty.  The Risotto and Peas app was generous enough to serve as a lunch entree and had wonderful flavor.  Keep in mind risotto can be a little more al dente than typical pasta, and this one is cooked with a slight \\"crunch\\".  The only meh part of this dish is the prosciutto.  It was a bit tough.  \\nIt did get a bit loud as the place filled up, and it always drives me crazy that restaurants have chairs that make a loud screeching noise every time someone pulls it in or out.  \\nThe location is great, after you've enjoyed your lunch or dinner, you can easily walk to Mike's Pastry or Modern Bakery to get something sweet.  \\nWe all had a wonderful meal, it was a beautiful day and the open air doors added to the pleasant atmosphere.

The ONLY gripe I have is that you can run into issues with finding a place to sit to eat when they're busy. \\n\\nAnyway, we were in the area and wanted cheap and delicious food and stumbled upon Tacos La Villa and we were pulling in before I could close out my Yelp app on my phone. It's a small hole-in-the-wall joint nestled inside a nondescript strip mall. We walked in on a Friday night to a busy room. All the tables were filled with all kinds of people of all ages, races, classes... Good sign! Behind the counter was a cashier and the cooks. The cashier was an older woman and she was very kind and full of smiles. We ordered a carnitas quesadilla with rice and beans and a plate with three tacos: chorizo, barbacoa and steak and rice and beans. That plus one drinks was $12. They have a great big selection of combos and plates to choose from but I honestly didn't look at the menu for too long because I just wanted to pick something simple this time. \\n\\nWe grabbed few samples from the salsa bar - salsas, spicy sauces, cilantro, peppers - and managed to slip into a free seat just as our order was placed. We waited for about five minutes before they called our number to get our meals. The quesdilla was pretty big, and stuffed with carnitas. So good and cheesy and crispy and chewy in all the right ways. I really enjoyed my tacos (my plate was $5 and change). The corn tortillas are honestly the best I've ever had, but I've always been picky about corn tortillas because personally, they haven't always been a first choice of mine, but I've grown to appreciate them, and they are SO DELICIOUS here. No complaints about my tacos, which are SUPER cheap al carte by the way. They were all so tasty and flavorful, and the meat was tender and spiced just right for all three. YUM. I got a steak, carnitas and chorizo taco - can't pick which one I liked best. \\n\\nThe space is very no frills. It's about the food. It used to be a Quiznos and there's evidence of this everywhere, from the Qs on the backs of chairs to the Mmmm Toasty on the sign above the cashier, so that gives you an idea of the room size, even though I'd say it was a smaller Quiznos... but it gets packed quickly. Traffic was consistent and the line behind the counter got pretty long and the line to wait for food made everything feel a little cramped. But it's a small price to pay for some very good, cheap grub!

Not a lot of Irish bar options in East Orlando (Fiddler's is probably the best option), so the Tilted Kilt is trying to tap into this niche market, and I think they have done it successfully.\\n\\nI had not heard anything about the Tilted Kilt prior to going there, so I told my parents to join us there for lunch on a Saturday. When we arrived my mom met me in the parking lot and rolled her eyes asking if we really wanted to eat here, once I walked in, I understood why she asked. To say this is an Irish version of Hooters is unfair because after experiencing this place, I don't think you would only go there for the women. Yes, the outfits are skimpy, kind of catholic school girl, but the waitresses aren't pushing themselves on you like other Wing House/Hooters type places. I, of course, tried to push myself on the waitresses which the wife and mother were not impressed with, just amused. The layout of the bar is a comparable to a sports bar with a lot of Irish flair. There are \\"punny\\" Irish sayings written around the room, lots of great soccer, music, and movie memorabilia to set the theme. I like the fact that the bar is set off to one side of the space instead of right in the middle, so you keep the table patron and bar patrons in there own areas. Unfortunately soccer wasn't on this Saturday, but the big screen and projectors makes me think this would be a great place to watch the World Cup in June. The menu offered a lot more than expected, a mix of traditional Irish options (i.e. bangers and mash, fish and chips, etc) and American bar food (i.e. burgers, wings, etc). I ended up going with a BBQ burger which was excellent and priced right around $9 which was a good deal. \\n\\nI like this place a lot, I wish I could give it 5 stars, but I need to spend some more time there (of course) before I can upgrade my rating. I think the Tilter Kilt might hit the jackpot considering it is less than 1 mile from UCF and right on University along a section where restaurants have been coming and going quicker than one of Tiger Woods ladies. If you are at UCF or in East Orlando, give it a try, I would like to see this place stick around for a while."},{"name":"Ovation Coffee & Tea","address":"941 NW Overton St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"I'm probably just going to say what everyone else already knows but this place is incredible.

But my favorites are plain chocolates on the darker range. \\n\\nThe baked goods here are also first rate, and at a portion size that is reasonable and won't make you hate yourself on the way home. Here a croissant or pain au chocolat looks like one in Paris, not the scary dinner plate sized ones that get served up at a lot of bakeries. I've read a couple yelpers here comment negatively on portion size and price. First up I think a lot of us need a reality check after the super-sized decade we are now in, and the prices here for what constitutes super-premium chocolates that are made on premises seems reasonable to me. \\n\\n\\nOther plusses at Aroa: coffee, perfect dark roast without any of the bitterness or that over roasted burnt taste. I am also loving the little sugared jellied fruit desserts. These are perfect to bring to a dinner, or to serve guests after dessert with another glass of wine of coffee. \\n\\nAroa has nice helpful staff. And when there are 3-4 customers in line ordering notice how the staff here is efficient and actually listens to what you want without asking you to repeat yourself several times over and further slowing the line down.

The sauce is just how I like it -- great body, nice balance of sweet and acid, and detectable herbs (personally, I like it heavier on the oregano and basil, but I'm more than satisfied with what's there).\\n\\nToppings are NEARLY always in just the right proportion; only once have they seemed to skimp, and they're never overloaded (it's a pizza, not an overstuffed Italian taco!).\\n\\nDelivery times stick closely to what they promise when your order is taken, and the pizza has arrived hot from the oven (once it was a little cold, but it was in the midst of our record-cold Boston winter).\\n\\nPrice is a bit high, IMO. With a  reasonable tip (and please do tip generously), a two-topping XL pizza is about $26. Depending on your family's or group's appetite, that will feed four people. $7.50 per slice -- event these fabulous slices -- feels expensive for pizza, but for my family, a few dollars is worth it to boost our pizza occasions from \\"too lazy to cook\\" to \\"real treat after a hard day/week.\\"\\n\\nPlease don't raise your prices, Rustica, and keep it fresh; do that, and you'll have customers for life.\\n\\nBTW -- and this is probably an important one for Rustica's owners -- your website is truly atrocious and practically useless.

It started with promise as the crispy green bean appetizer was as delicious as always. Sadly, this would be the best dish of the evening. Sweet roasted beets were oddly paired with sprinkled cheese - or was that coconut? Hard to tell. The rubbery mussels were served in a watery, flavor-free broth. French fries arrived room temperature and soggy. \\n\\nBut the major disappointment was the Porchetta \\"special.\\" Described as succulent and savory, it was served overcooked and boldly bland. The skin, which should have been delicately crunchy was inedible - more akin to ancient beef jerky. The loin, which should have been tender and juicy, was dense and dry. Not sure whether the generous slices were cut and then reheated or just overcooked from the start. I suspect the latter. We couldn't help but notice nearby diners were also struggling to chew thru this \\"special\\" dish. Sadly, the meal was finished with indescribably cold, doughy \\"donut holes\\" that seemed delivered straight from the walk-in, rather than the fryer. \\n\\nOur server, who was top notch, said that the kitchen was shuffling a recently revamped menu and still working things out. That was made obvious to us. The good news was the cocktails were spot on so that helped us get through the otherwise disappointing meal.

The soup came with a a hot drink (I chose almond milk).  \\n\\nThe portion was large.  There was ample, tender beef tendon (they didn't get stingy with it, like a few other places).  The broth was rich and tasty.  It might have had just a tad too much salt - but it was still very enjoyable.\\n\\nThe hot almond milk was a perfect accompaniment.  There were some snacks available for purchase in addition to the soup.  Some looked interesting, but I just had the soup this time.

Honestly if I wanted to dance I would go to a club or a dancehall not to a small bar and grill. If you go with friends the only way to have a conversation over the loud music is to stand out on the small patio. The in house music might play something country before a DJ plays Top 40 hip hop so be warned the music is all over the map.\\n\\nAll in all spiners is a great place to grab a quick beer on the way home from work.

We didn't wait long for the entrees to come out and immediately began picking away at the hearty dishes. The frutti di mare had an assortment of seafood with just a light touch of spice and the linguine was coated in just the right amount of sauce.  Seafood was also quite fresh and didn't taste like as if it came out of a frozen package. I'm not a fan of regular alfredo but wanted to try out the crazy alfredo at Carmelina's based on all the reviews and I'm glad I did. Light creaminess with a touch of spiciness. It had a very homemade flavor to it. The sunday macaroni is a very hearty, meaty meal. If you're carnivorous eater with a big appetite..this will be your bang for the buck. Huge meatballs, sausage and short ribs..nom nom nom. The mushroom risotto was a special on the menu and was a nice dish to compliment the rest of the pastas we got.

THEN, as if my dining experience could get any better, I ordered the burger with bacon. The burger without bacon was GREAT but this is homemade bacon. Once we got the bacon....feeling generous, I gave each person at my table a piece of the pig heaven, it was honestly.... the best bacon of my life. THE BEST! (I am literally a bacon connoisseur (atleast I aspire to be one one day when I grow up)) BACON + BURGER= the best thing of my life. My friend got the grilled cheese, which the bread and cheddar, simple yet amazing (we also added a piece of bacon to make it mindblowing). (seriously I wish I could stop telling people about the crazy goodness of this bacon). My other friend got the sausage in a roll thing, it was good. But nothing really to write home about. \\n\\nOverall, I want to go back... today. I highly recommend this place. Good atmosphere. Prices were reasonable.

Joey suggested some appetizers and gave us full detail on the entree we were looking to order. \\n\\nThe steak tips are a great app to share, cooked to perfection and garnished with dipping sauces that were to die for! \\n\\nMy French Onion burger was killer, go ahead and try it! The cheese and onions were the right addition to the juicy burger. \\n\\nMy two friends both add chicken Caesar salads that were delicious. Of course I tried some! \\n\\nI can't speak for any of the cocktails or alcohol because we only had soda but he kept refilling until we said not to. \\n\\nDessert was handmade and one of the best key lime pies I've ever had.

OK, it's simple: if you want specific meats, you're going to have to get here early to wait in line just like you've heard. They start selling at 11AM, Tuesday through Sunday, till it's all gone. The beef rib is typically the first to go so if that is your BBQ base line, get here an hour or two (depending on day) before 11AM to make sure. \\n\\nOrder it all: by the slice or by the pound. Want a lean slice? Tell them! I didn't and am glad I got a huge beef rib, a respectable brisket cut as well as a modest pork rib. All seasoned to PERFECTion. Simply prepared just as well as seasoned. \\n\\nWant a sandwich? They have that too. My brother ordered el Sancho Loco which is worth a pic search and obviously ordering if that is more along your BBQ lines. Other sandwich options are available, like sausage (made in house), as well. \\n \\nAlthough I'm all-about-that-beef, I like to have sides to switch up my carnivorous consumption. la Barbecue doesn't ignore these staples just because they know they have a great thing going with their proteins. Here too, order it all! The chipotle slaw is refreshing and chunky with a healthy crunch coupled with just enough spice. The buttermilk potato salad was a flavorful surprise as were the pinto beans, both seasoned in familiar ways with a new \\"kick\\" to make them new again.  \\n\\nIf you'd like to add a little sauce to your meat/sandwich/side, they have options for that too. There are two available on each of their picnic style tables with a mild and medium (for lack of a better word). Neither of which seemed 'tomato based' which I found myself pleasantly surprised for a change. Never one for vinegar based sauce, these were flavorful and not watery like various incarnations I've tried over the years. Alternate between the two!\\n\\nSadly, they offer zero desserts as I have no doubt they'd make an amazing attempt at it! Perhaps if/when they expand to a sit-down location? One could only dream... \\n\\nCash and plastic are accepted here with an ATM on site for immediate convenience. \\n\\nEnjoy and do yourself a favor and ensure you treat yourself to a beef rib, ala Flintstone-style*! \\n\\n*You'll get it when you order (or see it passing you on trays while in line)!"},{"name":"Thai Bloom","address":"3800 SW Cedar Hills Blvd","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"Very happy to find a nice, clean, and delish Thai restaurant in Beaverton.

I gave this 2 stars because our service was great, my husband liked his food and the restaurant looks awesome.  I wanted to give it 3 stars but just couldn't justify giving it another star...\\n\\nDexters is new to the Windermere area and we were excited to try it.  When we walked in we were greeted promptly by a sweet hostess who seated our party immediately.  The restaurant looks very hip and modern.  It is decorated with modern artwork throughout that is also for sale.  The restaurant is very clean.\\n\\nOur server came promptly and took our drink order.  Looking at the menu we were all excited to try the food.  There is a great variety and the descriptions of the food made the food sound delicious.  We ordered our food and eagerly anticipated its arrival.\\n\\nWe were very hungry so we were happy that our food came quickly.  My husband ordered the Blue Cheese Blackened Chicken and Shrimp Salad.  The lettuce was fresh and crunchy, the chicken and shrimp were delicious and the vinaigrette was excellent.  The only negative was the canned corn that they called roasted corn.\\n\\nI ordered the shrimp tacos.  They looked fantastic, if only they tasted that fantastic.  They were swimming in a 'roasted corn salsa' that looked and tasted canned corn mixed mixed with a few spices, tomatoes and peppers.  The deep fried avocados and the shrimp were the only decent parts of the tacos.  They were swimming in so much liquid that I wound up having to eat them with a fork.  The dish came with a side of yellow rice that looked and tasted just like the packaged Vigo Yellow Saffron Rice Spanish Recipe that I buy at Publix. \\n\\nMy son loves burgers and ordered Dexters Famous Grilled Colby Cheeseburger.  He will usually finish any kind of burger even if it isn't amazingly good.  But he only ate a few bites of his cheeseburger before he deemed it inedible.  It was cooked as ordered but the meat was poorly seasoned and the bun was stale.  He did enjoy the fries.\\n\\nThe Mediterranean Pasta Toss that my daughter ordered was just terrible.  She started putting the artichoke hearts in it on my plate and loving artichoke hearts I eagerly ate one, it was awful.  Not only was it a canned artichoke heart but the seasoning they used was terrible.  The white wine broth with fresh herbs that they tossed the pasta and it's ingredients in wasn't liked by anyone at the table.  The angel hair pasta was overcooked and sticky.\\n\\nWe eat out a lot and are not that picky but everything we had except for the salad was terrible.  Maybe we ordered the wrong things but we wound up leaving most of our food on our plates which should have been totally cleaned because we were so hungry.  I hope that they see this and step up their game.  We need good restaurants  in Windermere and I was hoping that this would be one of them...."},{"name":"Akira sushi","address":"1718 NE 122nd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"We went for a late night dinner here on a Saturday and at 8:30ish there were quite a few people there but by 9 we were the only ones left.

I ordered the cashew chicken which I liked and decided to make this place my regular spot for Thai. On my last visit I ordered take out as usual only to get home and realize there wasn't even one cashew in my meal. I called (not upset because mistakes happen) but the manager I spoke with was extremely rude. She tells me its only 4 cashews that comes in the dinner anyway and she would comp me a spring roll  as if I shouldn't have called when my order was wrong. Being that this was not my first time,  plus common sense tells anyone a cashew meal has more than 4 cashews, I tell her well no I'm positive it has more than 4 cashews. She puts me on hold to ask so she can prove me wrong. At this point in time I'm upset the meal costs $14 plus change and she insults my intelligence with the way she speaks to me. After telling me that is only 4 nuts she speaks to the owner he puts a credit for my next meal. I wasn't planning on going back but decided I would get my meal today (after almost a month) I order the same. When I get to the bar the guy tells me from now on they have to check my meal with me and that there are 6 to 7 cashews as if I would lie about not having any cashew nuts. I simply said ok because I won't ever go back and I was going to check it myself anyway.  This has been beyond insulting and with all the Thai restaurants in Atlanta I would never go there again.

I was very excited to try this place but I will say I was disappointed in a few things. The way they seat you is very awkward, someone has to assign you a seat then you place an order which someone will bring to your table but that person is NOT your sever. A \\"server\\" sometimes comes around but when you order they take your payment right away. Either make this place a full service restaurant or let people order at the counter and bring their number to whatever seat they would like.  I'm not tipping when I'm doing most of the work. I will say the food was pretty decent although I wish they would offer single servings on the speciality fries, my friend and I wanted to order two different types but the amount of calories and money for a large portion just wasn't doable. Also, my friend ordered a \\"regular margarita\\" and I ordered a corona margarita thinking they'd be the same size.... description could be better. I had the continental club and tried some of my friends buffalo fries... both were pretty tasty! I would order these items again but like I said, I would love it if I could have ordered a burger and fries of my own... maybe half sandwich half fry combo? I would definitely return more if that was an option! Overall not a bad place but the amount of calories in each item is insane.... decrease the calorie count for each item by adding a \\"smaller version\\" and I would spend more time there. I DID appreciate that many of the alcoholic beverages had lower calories counts (excluding the shakes of course).

Actually, I didn't get to experience anything other than a greeting and a long, long wait after the staff had disappeared.\\n\\nI went into this Oath location a couple weeks back at about 2 or 3 in the afternoon on a weekday. When I walked in, I actually was afraid I'd walked in while they were closed because there was no one behind the counter, no customers, and three staff members (at least one of whom seemed like a manager) in the dining room, talking and doing something on an ipad. \\n\\nOne of them came over and greeted me, asked if I'd been into an Oath before, and was super pleasant. He said he'd be right back with me and left through the kitchen doors, presumably to come back around the counter to take my order. ...Except that he never came back. I stood there, I studied the menu, he didn't come back, so I looked around some more. I tried to make eye contact with the other two men who worked there who were still in the dining room, but no one acknowledged me.\\n\\nEventually one of the two men left in the dining room headed through the kitchen door too. Certainly one of them was about to come take my order! Nope. I could see their reflections on the metal kitchen doors that were propped open at the far end of the counter. They were just standing there. Had the first guy forgotten that he'd interacted with me five minutes before? Had the second guy not heard it? The third guy never looked up from his ipad.\\n\\nThe whole thing was so bizarre that I shot an email to Oath through their website. No one got back to me. \\n\\nAt this point I can only assume that I hallucinated the whole thing and maybe Oath doesn't even actually exist.

Wasn't greeted with a smile, woman did not know what drinks had in them.  Worst part of it was I paid (almost 30 dollars for 3 drinks) and gave her a tip.  Her response \\"you waiting for a receipt or something?\\". Ungrateful.  Never coming back.  #mymoneyworkstoo\\n\\nUpdate on original experience: at approximately 5 or 5:30, while my fiance and I were sitting trying to enjoy our drinks... A small group of people walked in, got their food right away and in my opinion were treated with much more respect then my fiance and I were... and left. At that point music was put on the speakers and the restaurant. The volume was exceptionally loud and uncomfortable. The music despite being too loud was actually turned up even more. At that point I asked for it to be turned down. It was slightly. When I asked for a business card or the contact information of the owner or manager, the young lady who helped us originally could not find it and did not give out a cell phone number. My Hope was that I would be able to contact Richard, the person who left me a response on this review, to let him know there is no need to fire her. However strong  customer service training is recommended.  I am originally from the Boston area, and in all of my years being in and around the city, have never been treated with so much disrespect in my life. Truly disheartening. I now live in Las Vegas, and will be heading home in the morning. While I truly appreciate the offer of a gift card, I would prefer a quick chat with the owner or manager.

I've been three times and each time I have had a different spin on the omelet.  I imagine over time I will work my way around the menu.  I don't eat eggs so it is a real treat for me to be able to in and order an omelet that looks and tastes like an omelet (although I do love tofu scrambles, too).  The tempeh bacon is incredible, and the seitan chorizo is very spicy and yummy.  They have an in-house hot sauce that is delectable although they will offer you Sri Racha as well (I think the in-house stuff is miles better).  I do hope they will eventually add spinach to the list of options for the omelets & sandwiches.  They do have baby arugula and a number of home made pestos and spreads (I just had the tarragon pesto---again AWESOME) which help make you forget that you don't have many options for roughage in a veg* themed venue.\\n\\nThere is an all vegan bakery (the regular food menu is a mix of vegan and vegetarian) and I did try a cinnamon bun which was incredibly light and tasty--wonderful flavor.\\n\\nI think most omnivores will leave very satisfied with their meal.

We wanted to walk around Cambridge to some places afterward so we came a little early, like 5:45. We weren't expecting it to be packed to the walls. But we definitely did NOT expect it to be BARE ASS EMPTY. No joke, we were the ONLY PEOPLE THERE for almost 2 whole hours. I'm not kidding, we were the ONLY people there. I have no clue how this could possibly be. Granted, just about all the other restaurants on Cambridge street were pretty much empty or 1-2 people eating there. So I don't know what's going on; is Cambridge just that dead? Does ALL the food suck? Is Boston that poor?  I mean there were lots of cars on the street and people were walking around.... just nobody was in the restaurants. Is it just Monday? It bothered us that ZERO others were in the restaurant..... but for now I'm not going to rate them down for that. Something must have been going on beyond their control if ALL the restaurants were empty. Seriously. WTF Boston?\\n\\nOK well on to this place, specifically.\\n\\nI would not be surprised if this meat house only got to maybe 30% full on a busy night. I've only been to 1 other Brazilian place, in Chicago, but my friend has been to a handful. We both noted first off that the typical side-dish buffet was definitely below par. I mean, maybe it was cuz it was sitting around and nobody was there to eat it. But if that's the case, then make a smaller amount and bring it out in small waves. In the 2 hours we were at dinner they never brought fresh food to the buffet. Granted, again, it was never approaching being empty. But like I said, if food is sitting around for 2 hours, it gets dry/limp/flavorless. Make smaller portions and bring it out in waves. You're bored anyway with nobody to serve, so do something other than sit on your ass all night. The buffet featured a salad bar with some chicken salad and other salads, they tasted good. But something in mayo sitting around for 2 hours exposed is not a good idea (for my med student friends out there... what do you expect to see in this setting?). The warm buffet featured french fries and roasted potatoes, roasted chicken and wings, roasted yams and yucca, mixed veggies, meatballs, pork in black beans, and some rices. In all honesty it looked like it probably would have been really awesome if there was high turnover and people were there to keep the fresh food coming.... but again, it all sat there for at least the 2 hours we were there, and maybe all day too, so it was pretty dry and lousy by the time we ate it. A grocery store probably had fresher tasting food by that point.\\n\\nOn to the meat. The meat OFFERINGS were reasonably diversified. Kielbasa, sausage, beef ribs, chicken drumsticks, chicken hearts, lamb, and a couple other options. I hate to keep saying the same thing. It was all pretty dry, probably because it had been sitting over the fire for 3 hours longer than it should have. All the meat, we had the first cut, so there was no non-well-done portion to anything. No medium rare cuts. The ribs were overcooked. The sausages were cracked from overcooking. I really wanted to go balls out and stuff myself.... but it wasn't good enough to want to do that. My friend's standards are higher than mine.... so he was especially disappointed. Service was shit too, as the meat cutter guy kept dripping grease all over the table where our arms were resting. Really? That's your ONLY JOB dude, don't f it up like that!\\n\\nNow here's the TOTALLY ASININE PART. This is a f'in meat buffet. We can eat ALL THE MEAT WE WANT, right? Well, i guess to make up their losses, they charge for Coke BY THE GLASS. Yes that's right. eat all the steak you want. Coke is expensive stuff, so each glass is going to cost you. WTF. I understand that logic if this is an expensive thing. But it's a MEAT BUFFET. And Coke is not buffet? Another WTF moment!!!\\n\\nOK so to wrap this up. I am giving it 1 star not because it was empty, which isn't their fault, perhaps, given EVERYONE else was empty. (btw to the managers, if you're empty on certain nights regularly, either spice things up or close for a night..... or else you're going to go out of business paying for food and workers to serve themselves) I am giving them 1 star for crap-ass service, overcooked meat, stale buffet, charging for Coke by the glass, and just being a total let-down.\\n\\nWith ALL THAT SAID..... I still would probably come back. It's only $22 some nights, $25 on others. The massive caveat is that I am only stepping inside if the place is mostly full. If this place is busy, I think the food will be fresh and the servers interested and the meat succulent. It's like Red Rover; it can't be done by just 1 person alone. So who's with me?

We go often for Monday wing nights and the wings are delish; slathered in sauce and grilled with plenty of blue cheese on the side. Beers are super inexpensive and we always have this wonderful server, Amanda, who is so friendly and sweet. We've been there enough that she remembers our drink orders now, gotta love when the staff remembers you. Every few nights, I'll walk by, and the bar will be bursting at the seams with college kids and bros, that \\"UM-CHA, UM-CHA, UM-CHA\\" beat blasting every time someone opens the door to walk out for a smoke, otherwise its pretty average noise level and with the funniest mix of playlists. One second you're listening to Johnny Cash and then \\"Call Me Maybe\\" comes on. Its part of the charm. I get the fries there sometimes, and tots, if we're feeling fancy. All in all a fun place."},{"name":"Barrio Cantina","address":"1363 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"There are a lot of Mexican restaurants in Boston now and Barrio is a great new option.

It's definitely a good vegan/vegetarian restaurant. The vibe/environment there is also fantastic. Servers are very friendly and attentive.

I got the BLT, the rest of the group got the blue plate (a tater tots dish), loaded mac and cheese, and the galaxy burger. \\n\\nWe all got to try some of each other dishes, and I think that they were all good vegan dishes, but not the best taste-wise. I think they were trying really hard to mimic dishes that are classically not vegan, but failed. I think they should have embraced the unique vegan dishes and market it that way. For example, I got the BLT and the seitan \\"bacon\\" tasted/looked nothing like bacon. They should have just called it a vegan sandwich or something. We all agreed that the burger was also meh - not the best veggie/vegan burger. The description of it said that i was also supposed to taste like meat but it really didn't. \\n\\nI liked the restaurant, but I thought the food was above average. Compared to other places making seitan based vegan dishes, veggie galaxy is pretty good, but I think it does not taste as good as the non-vegan dishes that they are trying to compare their foods to.

It was delicious!\\n\\nHeirloom tomatoes - Very fresh and seasonal.  It was drizzled with more pesto, and I added a bit more.  \\n\\nScallops - If you're a scallop lover, you have to get this dish.

La Barbecue came highly recommended and of course it's highly rated on Yelp so this was a must-visit place.  My man and I headed there for an early dinner on a Friday and surprisingly walked right up to the window. We ordered the fatty brisket and the pulled pork.\\n\\nThe fatty brisket was definitely more fatty than brisket. We eat BBQ pretty regularly and love fatty brisket but this was way too much fat. I'd say half of what we ordered was inedible. Very disappointing. Especially because as we were eating a woman came out of the truck and offered the couple sitting next to us (who had already finished their meal) what she called \\"the best part of the brisket\\" (i.e burnt ends) to try. So obviously we didn't just get the scraps that were left. We would have loved some of the \\"best part\\" too! I guess we weren't cool enough.\\n\\nThe pulled pork was very good. It paired really well with the sauce, which I liked as well. \\n\\nAfter the brisket incident we left with an overall bad feeling about the place. Like we had the feeling they didn't care about our business at all. Some of the staff was out walking around and cleaning tables and no one ever asked us how we were doing or said thank you or anything.

I love the choice of toppings that are included.  I usually get grilled mushrooms, grilled onions, fresh jalape√±os, fresh bell pepper, lettuce, and tomatoes.  All are included in the price.  The single patty one is plenty big and the Cajun frys are nice.  This is a great place to go for a stroll around the Arboretum afterwards.  My daughter also wrote up a review for her school flier restaurant review column:\\n\\n\\nFive Guys is a clean, but simple place with great food. The burgers are excellent and are made for you on the spot (unlike many fast food places such as McDonalds?). They serve complimentary peanuts while you wait and are always kind and gracious. Be sure to order fries because they're delicious. They have Cajun powder for all of ya'll who enjoy hot stuff (including me). On the menu there are little burgers and burgers (i.e. little cheeseburger, cheeseburger). Be warned, the \\"little burgers\\" are regular size (one meat patty). Toppings include mayo, mustard, ketchup, relish, onions, lettuce, pickles, tomatoes, green peppers, jalape√±os, grilled onions, and grilled mushrooms. The sauces offered are BBQ, hot sauce and A1, all of these are no additional charge. They also sell hotdogs and grilled cheese, but specialize more on hamburgers. The grilled cheese Sandwich doesn't live up to the Five Guys standard. Many other food critics enjoy Five Guys hamburgers. The Washington Magazine awarded Five Guys with the \\"Number 1 burger\\" for seven years! But even Five Guys has his nicks. This restaurant isn't the healthiest place. The Center for Science in the Public Interest placed Five Guys's bacon cheeseburger, which contains 920 calories, among its 2010 list of most unhealthy meals available at U.S. chain restaurants. The price is a deal considering the quality of the burger. I recommend the little baconburger and Cajun fries. Don't order your burger online because it never tastes as good. Another Plus is they accept credit cards, checks, and cash. There hours are from 11 am- 10 p.m. Mon-Sun. There are many locations including: 3208 Guadalupe St and Ste 142, 10000 Research Boulevard.

The meat was skirt steak and the shrimp were sauteed in a sauce and poured over the steak. The meat itself was not prepared with seasoning so it was a little bland but the shrimp on top gave it some flavor. The portion size which costs almost $20 was large enough for two people. I eat Mexican food often and am originally from a state with a large Mexican/Mexican-American population so in my experience I would not say this is the best or worst--just okay. \\n\\nThe biggest selling point is convenience if you are staying at one of the hotels across the street and are unable or unwilling to drive somewhere else."},{"name":"Life of Pie Pizza","address":"3632 N Williams Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Came during happy hour- grabbed a brew, $5 Margherita and sat outside on a picnic table.

The Carpaccio and the Burrata Special.\\n\\nI wholeheartedly believe that the eyes eat first and they certainly feasted to their heart's content. Both dishes were so thoughtfully and breathtakingly composed. A symphony of color, dimension, and texture. \\nPictures don't do them justice. \\n\\nThe Burrata was divine. Easily the best I've had. The grilled zucchini rose was perfectly cooked, not mushy at all. The fresh tomatoes and golden beets were top quality. The salad of arugula and little gem lettuce was delicately dressed. Along with the rich, slightly sweet balsamic drizzle and nutty olive oil, all of these components paired incredibly well with the star of the dish, the heavenly Burrata. \\n\\nI absolutely love carpaccio and was very excited as I awaited it's arrival. This dish was unlike any carpaccio I have ever had. The 1/2 of a soft boiled quail egg in the center was a richly delicious little surprise not listed in the menu description. The several arugula leaves sprinkled on top added just the right amount of light peppery crunch to each bite. The whole grain mustard was the most mild I have ever had. Hardly any brininess or acidity. Thankfully, the baby artichokes brought that needed hint of brininess and acidity. The shaved Reggiano was wonderful but the amount seemed to overwhelm the other flavors. The element that didn't make sense to me was the creamy white sauce drizzled generously over the carpaccio. It tasted of a more liquid version of cr√®me fra√Æche but when I asked the server, the answer she relayed to me from the kitchen was that it was a mustard/mayo sauce. Surprising, since it didn't taste as such in the least. Whatever the sauce was, it didn't taste bad, but it did completely overpower the dish, even the Reggiano. When I have beef Carpaccio, I like to taste the meat, which of course needs to be of high quality grade to be used for carpaccio. Sadly, I couldn't taste the flavor of the delicate, thinly sliced meat at all due to the creamy sauce. If I have this again, I will definitely order it with a very light drizzle or skip the sauce all together. \\n\\nThe service was exceptional. From the host to the two servers who took care of me. Not a bit of pretentiousness, which I find can be common in upscale establishments. Not here, only genuine hospitality from what I experience.\\n\\nThere were so many wonderful dishes on the menu.

We sat down the service was great, and the drinks came out quick.  Might I add the Strawberry lemonade was on point.  Really great, not too sweet to enjoy the sourness.  Strawberry chunkies made it yummy.  Had the Bacon Cheese Fries that were oh so yummy.  A full portion is MASSIVE, and that was more than enough for the four of us to the extent we brought it home.  Later the dog ate it.  No complaints there either might I add.  The steak 20oz was cooked perfectly but as expected had nothing on Outback Steakhouse HOWEVER the price more than made up for that.  What I did enjoy was a different flavor, it had a minor spice kick to it which was enjoyable.  Not sure if this was intended, but it was great either way.  Corn and soup was small, but I was more than full after everything.  Couldn't finish the steak, but it was great in the oven reheated the next day.  \\n\\nThe potato soup was excellent, just small.  I recommend the full/bigger option. The potato chunks, and soup creamy thickness worked surprisingly great together.  The elements weren't lacking, the seasoning was on point, just small portion.  \\n\\nThe wife had a sandwich that I did not try.  She enjoyed my steak to the extent she ate most of it the next day.\\n\\nThis was my first time here and I am seriously IMPRESSED with this establishment.\\n\\nThe server topped off my drink 4x during this encounter.

It comes with 3 tacos filled with whatever meat you want, refried beans and Mexican rice. The refried beans were average, and so was the rice, but they don't call it Beans La Villa or Rice La Villa, they call it Tacos La Villa for a reason, baby!\\n\\nIt got a chorizo taco, a taco with pork al pastor, and the last one was barbacoa.

After starting a thread in the Yelp Atlanta \\"Talk\\" asking for the thinnest crust in the city, I was surprised that the majority suggested Domino's. I promised myself that I would not order from this establishment again, and I'll admit a shred of my dignity was lost when I logged on to their website.\\n\\nAnyways, that was a few months ago. I've secretly ordered from here at least 8-10 times since. The service is still hit-or-miss, but the pizza is not. It's perfect. I'm pretty specific when it comes to my perfect pizza: super thin crust with a little crisp to it, extra sauce, just a sprinkle of cheese, and a mountain of veggies. Domino's is the only place that gets it right every time. I owe it partly to their website, which is definitely the best online ordering experience I've ever had. They also let me select the heavy-on-the-topping option without charging extra. Every other pizza place I've ordered from has said they'd charge for each topping you'd like to go heavy on. \\n\\n75% of the time, the pizza is here in about 30 minutes. However, I have had a few instances where it didn't arrive for TWO HOURS, and this was after quite a few phone calls in which employees shouted at each other in the background, hung up on me, and called back saying  they thought the pizza was delivered but it's still on the counter. Once, when it finally did show up, the driver called me and asked if I could come downstairs from my highrise and cross the street to find his car.

My husband and I finished the rest of it the next day-- we couldn't help ourselves! Lisa was so friendly to work with and completely accommodated our dietary needs. My husband and I like to eat grain free and refined sugar free and so Lisa made us a special recipe separate from Petunia's so that we could have what we wanted.

One, you can go by recommendations from acquaintances.  Two, you can read reviews and chose that way.\\nWe did the latter.  The barbecue that most commonly appeared to be favored is Franklin's in Austin.  So on a Thursday we set off for Franklin's.  We arrived at 11:30 because we read that they run out of food quickly and the lines are quite long.  To our surprise it was closed. It's not supposed to be closed on Thursday.  Now what?  Okay plan B.\\nWe quickly looked up for another top rated barbecue joint.  We came upon a place called La Barbecue not too far from where we were.  Hungry for barbecue we took off for this place.  We pulled up and to see quite a line, that's a good sign, right?  Standing on line we overheard that the cook was the cook from  Franklin's who left to open his own place.  That can't be bad either.  The line moved quickly and we ordered ribs, brisket and sausage.  Not only was the food incredibly tender and very delicious but the cook who gave us the food was very friendly and accommodating.  He gave us samples while he was fixing our meats.\\nIt was soooo good, I can't imagine any place being better.  It was the best barbecue we have ever had!

However, this was an unacceptable level of very bad service. Our group made a reservation for 14 people (The day BEFORE) hoping they would be prepared for us. Now I understand we had a large group of people, but we told them that in advanced. When we got there we were literally one of two groups of people in the entire restaurant. Two Tables. TWO. And they had two waiters working. One for each table seems reasonable right? Nope. It took over 10 minutes to just get water (glasses only) on the table, and another 10 minutes for her to actually pour the water into those glasses. Then she delivered some chips, oh that's nice, what about the salsa? Oh that comes out another 10 minutes later once all the chips have been eaten because we were hungry. But lets not talk about how they never mentioned there would be an extra charge for each and every single plate of chips they brought out, or that they charge for the salsa. I'm not against a restaurant charging for chips and salsa, but I am against them bringing it out without it being ordered and then just forgetting to mention that they charge extra for it. (To put it in perspective because of the size of our group we ended up spending $75 on chips and salsa ALONE). So you can imagine our disappointment when we wait at least 40 minutes for our food (even though their menu CLEARLY states that they deliver food in 30 minutes or less, false advertising) that it is cold and the portion size is so small for how much you're paying. We didn't have silverware for everyone but because our waitress was MIA for 80% of the time we were there we had to get up and search the restaurant for some. Let me remind you again that there was almost nobody else in the restaurant, because eventually the other group left. When we went to complain about it at the front the lady said there was no manager on site. Apparently there are no managers there during the day, and when they are there they are mean. OH and one of the bus boys even threatened to fight my friend simply because he said he disagreed with the amount we had to pay for the chips and salsa. It's supposed to be a professional setting and the guy working there is going to pick a fight with a customer? When my friend left the guy literally just glared at him through the window for like 5 minutes. So we asked for the managers name and when we could contact her. She told us and gave us a number. When my friend called back the manager said that the waitress lied and that there had been a manager on site. She was a complete snob and refused to do anything about it.

Each meat was amazing! \\n\\nThe brisket, which had a thin layer of fat, was super tender, and juicy. The pulled pork melted in my mouth. As opposed to most turkey, this one was very juicy. It paired well with their tangy & sweet barbecue sauces on the side. The pork ribs were fall-off-the-bone tender.

I haven't ever tried their Chinese, but their breakfasts are Y U M M Y! \\n\\nThey have the freshest, real ingredients. A huge, varied breakfast menu ranging from such things as regular fare to coconut pancakes to different and delicious variations of eggs benedict (they actually ask you how you want your eggs cooked for eggs benedict!) covered in perfectly-tasting hollandaise -- and their sausage gravy (as in biscuits and gravy) is wonderful. And, importantly, they don't skimp on what makes breakfast good -- the basics, prepared spot-on. Perfectly cooked eggs. Hashbrowns that are actually browned and crunchy. Great portions. Wonderful pancakes. Oh... and GREAT coffee. I could keep going on and on. Service also right there. \\n\\nSince discovering this little gem -- I've been back at least 6 times and can truthfully say that every visit has been great. \\n\\nNow -- the only downside -- the atmosphere: It's a Chinese restaurant by night, and a bit tacky inside and a little quiet.

Everything bite of this veggie burger was amazing. The BF felt pretty good about his Koolakofsky burger but the party was dry. You can't pick the cooking style of the meat patty they have to cook all the burgers to well. His was just a little too well done. The rest of the burger was amazing though. The tilted house fries deserve a place of their own. It is crispy delicious fries, covered in a layer of gravy sprinkled with chunks of fried bacon. The fries alone make a meal.

The only side that was left was coleslaw.  The chopped beef and sausage had a very good taste to them; I'm just torn as to what whether it was a 4-1/2 hr wait worth of good taste. If it was a hour or perhaps even 2 hr wait in line, I would likely be satisfied but the 4-1/2 hr just was too much.  The pulled pork which I usually don't get had a good crust on it but the inside lacked flavor.  The coleslaw was a chipotle coleslaw and wasn't all that great.  I would have liked to have tried the brisket and pork ribs but I don't know that I'll ever come back and chance another 4-1/2 wait to only maybe be able to taste them. \\nMs.: If my companion and I rate a place differently, we give the place the higher rating.  As for me, I would have given it a 3 at most.  We were in line before the place opened; half way through line, we were told the pork ribs were gone.  3/4 of the way, that the beef ribs were gone.  By the way, a beef rib would have been $33, yes, you read correctly, $33.  Somewhere along the way after that, they quit bothering to tell everyone what they were running out of but by the time we got to the front of the line 4-1/2 hours later, they only had turkey, chopped brisket, and pulled pork--none of which are what I usually order.  By the time I got to the front of the line, I was tired and very sunburned and to the point of tears but somewhere along the way you don't want to leave line because you have too much time invested to quit; that, and we knew we would need to eventually eat at this place anyway in order to visit all 50 of Texas Monthly's Top BBQ Joints.  I kept hearing people in line who had been to Franklin's talk about how, sure, Franklin's has a long line but that the line moves quick, whereas here, the line didn't move at all.  People ahead were ordering tons of food for people they were holding places in line for or for whole groups they were taking food home to.  There were only two people manning the food truck.  The people at the window were sociable and seemed sweet that you felt bad feeling so upset; they said that with the holiday weekend and it being a game day that it was unusually busy and requested that we come back and promised it wouldn't be as busy.  but that guilt over getting so worked up soon melted away, for the kicker was after we ordered our food and waited at the pay counter, they \\"found\\" some sausage for the guy in line behind us.  My companion asked if they could \\"find\\" another \\n\\"hidden\\" sausage, which they did.  Seriously?? I didn't think the food was bad, but not great either.  Everything was a bit too spicy with pepper. Their sausage is home-made and good, if you like a little kick. My suggestion? come an hour before opening and like the smart ones in line, bring an umbrella to block the unforgiving sun and a wheeled cooler with iced-down drinks. I know better now but will never come back for a \\"next time.\\" 4 and a half hour wait for no ribs or sliced brisket was no way to spend a day."},{"name":"IQ kitchen","address":"1158 Beacon St","city":"Newton","stars":"3","text":"General Zhaos chicken combo with white rice and crab Rangoon is my go too when I eat there and it is AMAZING 5/5 one of my favorite places to eat"},{"name":"Itta Bena","address":"9101 International Dr, Ste 2210","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Oh man oh man....\\n\\nDecided to try out a new restaurant and what better time than magical dining.

Unfortunately, the next time I ordered it, there was far too much cream cheese piled onto the bagel halves, and the bagel wasn't toasted well. Considering I'm a huge fan of cream cheese, you can imagine how much one would have to use in order for me to consider it too much.

A few limp strands of bean sprouts that could have easily blown away with the slightest breeze and a very small lettuce leaf split in two was placed lightly on the very top the sandwich. \\n\\nOn a different day, the salad I ordered was terrible, but I believe that the unsatisfactory food days here are rare.

As I mentioned above the restaurant layout was non-traditional, but it was of little consequence. If anything, it allowed a greater view of the tables from the kitchen. \\n\\nOur service was good, but not great. It seemed like the owner/proprietor was waiting tables, and he was a little overworked considering the number of tables he had to track. We never never felt neglected though. The food came fast (both our appetizers and our main course) and  we were checked on regularly.\\n\\nNow on to the best part: the food. My wife and I each decided to try a different curry. Hers was the pumpkin curry and mine was Panang curry (a dish by which I judge most Thai restaurants I go to). To call our dishes excellent would be a slight understatement. They were perfectly seasoned with a heat level commensurate to exactly what we asked for. \\n\\nWe both requested chicken in our dishes and it was cooked perfectly (something that should not be overlooked, as it is very very easy to leave meat with a rubbery texture when it's cooked in a sauce like a curry). I don't know if it's the best Panang curry I've ever had, but it certainly came close.\\n\\nOverall we were very pleased with our meal. I wouldn't hesitate to go there again for a curry, though I can't speak to their stir fries or noodle dishes.."},{"name":"Big A Sub","address":"282 Highland Ave","city":"Malden","stars":"3","text":"Love, Love, Love Big A... Have been coming since I was a little kid with Mom... they have been consistently the same... WONDERFUL... Subs are HUGE (well they dont appear it at first), but the amount of meats, & fillers they put in are enormous... The place just went through a make over & finally has a more readable menu... And I just found out last night they will deliver to Everett...  \\n\\nSalads... Oh... The Greek has always been my fave, and it has changed a little over the years (cheese is now just somewhat dust like not actual chunks of Feta- which I would prefer)... But all in all a great salad... \\n\\nThey have so many selections of Drinks, Chips, sides... Def a must order!"},{"name":"Hickory Smoked BBQ","address":"SW 10th & Alder St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Great BBQ and at a great price! For $7 you get an amazing BBQ sandwich, coleslaw and baked beans. The sandwich is a perfect mix between the meat and the bbq sauce- delicious and very flavorful! The beans I am not that impressed with, but overall I would definitely recommend this place for great bbq!"},{"name":"New Golden Gate","address":"66 Beach St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Allow me to preface by saying I am a frequent at Cantonese restaurants (especially in NYC). I was up in Boston for the long weekend and was extremely eager to try the Chinese food here - particularly the lobster, which you really can't do wrong right?\\n\\nWe chose New Golden Gate at random and left in utter disappointment. I'm giving Boston Chinese food the benefit of the doubt, knowing NGG alone can't define everything.\\n\\nService here is typical Chinese restaurant. It was pretty crowded and waiters were constantly moving around. Review of our dishes:\\n\\nLobster - What we came for. As seafood fanatics, we noted that the lobster wasn't exactly fresh but probably cooked after being dead cold (literally) for a while. You can tell because the meat inside the shells have notably contracted and didn't taste all that juicy. That was a bad start.\\n\\nSoft shell crab - Decent, but too much fried crisp and not enough crab taste. They overdid the salt and pepper taste...made us extremely thirsty afterwards.\\n\\nBeef brisket and tofu casserole: there was no brisket...it was just small chunks of beef mixed with a lot of white tofu. They cooked the two together with too much sha-die sauce which made it too salty and smokey. Not well done at all.\\n\\nChicken herbal soup - probably the saddest one of them all. We had to wait about 30 minutes for it since it's made to order and the broth needed time for the ingredients to savor in (understandable). When it came out, it was way sweet, meaning they put too many sweet herbs like rhizome in. Herbal soups should taste hearty and earthly, but this was not the case. When we gave them our constructive criticism, the owner said that's how the soup should taste; \\"this is Canto-style\\" she said, in a passive aggressive manner (noting we were not native). Definitely not a good excuse...\\n\\nI won't come here again but I'm hoping to give other Chinese places a try next time I go up to Boston.

We ordered food for seven people, a large $59 to-go order, a challenge for any kitchen. This place is inside the mall, and has limited seating, so we took or to-go order down to the food court seating area. Once we sat down, we realized we missing a chili burger and fries. Ryan Mejig, the manager on duty insulted my sister in law by insisting we bring the order back for them to verify we weren't lying. This manager has no idea how to deal with customers. This mall has a Saks Fifth Avenue. What kind of people are going to steal $5 worth of food here?

The cost came to $30, which I was a little shocked by, but figured it would be worth it.  All in all, I was not overly thrilled by the time I was done.  The pickle order only had about 15 pickle slices and the fries were soggy at best.
