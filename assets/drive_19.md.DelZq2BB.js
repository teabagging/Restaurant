We asked for a quiet spot for intimate conversation away from the kitchen, and were seated upstairs in a corner booth, which was perfect. Our server was good, but not exceptional as experienced on other occasions - perhaps a little less friendly and less attentive as per the usual. She also tried to upsell at every opportunity, which I found was quiet fitting for our situation and it worked in some cases, but it did become very apparent. \\n\\nAs for the food, I wasn't as impressed as I normally am. I felt the dishes were more hit and miss: \\n\\n- Tiger Prawn flatbread (8/10) - Recommend! \\nLike a pizza with cilantro pesto, spicy chickpeas, roasted tomato\\n\\n- Tuna sashimi topped California Roll (7.5/10)\\nDelicious, except the white rice was too soggy. Plus, Mango Cali is still better. \\n\\n- Calamari (6/10) - nothing special, could be crispier\\nWith white bean, pacific shrimp ragout - creamy, \\n\\n- Salmon (7.5/10) - good smoked flavours, but semi-dry. \\nWould not recommend compared to other fish options, but the artichoke, potato ragout was delicious. \\n\\n- Chilean Seabass (9/10) - heavenly. \\nHonestly, this is a dish that should be highly recommended because is was melt-in-my-mouth amazing, but unfortunately the Chilean seabass is currently going extinct, and I wouldn't choosing it. In this case, I tried someone's dish as they kept raving about it. It was pretty good, as is all Chilean seabass.\\n\\n3.5/5. High points for ambience, location. Mediocre points for service and food this time round.\\n\\nSuggestion: Turn down the music a little. \\nI\`m one to like louder ambience music, as it promotes louder talking and creates more gregarious environments, but we were in a quiet corner and still could hardily hear each other. Perhaps for the dining hours (5PM-9PM), the music should be kept at a level to compliment conversations, and can progressively increase as the late-night crowds come in."},{"name":"Hooters","address":"209 Peachtree St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2","text":"Average. \\nI was dining by myself, was greated nicely and quickly.\\nService was good.\\nThe iced tea was so sweet it tasted like simple syrup.

The idea of an old school German restaurant in German Village got me excited to try Schmidt's out.\\n\\nUnfortunately, reality did not quite meet up to expectations. Food was good, but not great.

For $15 you get unlimited sausage, German potato salad, sauerkraut, red cabbage, along with a full salad bar, soup and other bonuses like macaroni & cheese. You also get a discount on dessert. \\n\\nI'm not a huge fan of buffets, I tend to overeat and just end up being miserable. I guess it's my own fault. The sausage is just okay. Maybe i'm used to American style sausage served on a bun with condiments. I was looking for a bit more flavor. I've also had their Weiner Schnitzel, which was also pretty average.  \\n\\nOn the other hand, their side German potato salad and red cabbage are delicious. They are probably my favorite thing about the buffet, which is strange, since I like my protein.

I meant to write a review when I went there for my birthday 5 years ago... I never do anything but I got together a group of my friends.. Female and male.... And it was a complete nightmare from start to finish. The waitress was rude and barely paid attention to our table or got me refills. I told her it was my birthday and she shrugged her shoulders. The food was horrible and her lack of concern on my special day topped it off. Nail in the coffin. I swore that day that ended up ruining my birthday would be the last day I ever went back. Fast forward to dragoncon weekend... This is a huge convention that happens every year in Atlanta and they're in the perfect location for it. They have had the convention for years and have prepared themselves for what to expect. First of all, the wait was 90 minutes. Once we got in it was loud and terrible and gave me horrible anxiety. The food was a nightmare. The \\"queso dip\\" literally is quick trip canned Nacho dip. It's a joke. they ruined my order over and over and we waiting for our for 90 minutes. I am not exaggerating. The wings there are chicken nuggets with sauce drizzled over them. The Bloody Mary is horrible. You would think the atmosphere or service would make up for such horrible food items hooters has definitely cut down on money to serve... But it's horrible. I hate this sort of restaurant to begin with because of its sexist standards of beauty but if a place is going to be called hooters they should consider hiring women with boobs larger than an A cup: I remember growing up and seeing beautiful women get jobs at hooters. There was a \\"look\\". And it's not to say these girls were ugly because beauty comes in all shapes and forms... But they had no boobs and certainly were model material. It was a bad joke. It's like any girl who is thin can work there and there really is no standard. I just think the entire hooters chain should call it quits if this is any representation of the chain.

I know there are attitudes that might consider this request stupid or dumb just because I choose to not eat meat but if I am giving you money for a service and specify just how I would like to receive those services, I would hope that an establishment that literally depends on satisfied patrons would be able to accommodate a simple request. \\n\\nThe most insulting part was that we were offered no explanation or apology and were charged full price for the meal.

I am generally a fan of a good Greek style pizza, and visually it looked appealing, but D&A missed the mark. The pizza didn't leave me wanting for more even though the portion size was less the generous and I was still mildly hungry after.

I had the Blue Ginger which wasnt quite rare but non the less delicious, other people ordered the Royal Regis (good but needs more cheese), and the rowdy chicken sandwhich. All in all it was decent and we would return. Also wtf is up with the Zuni roll up? We sat next to the kitchen and literally every other plate was that damn roll.

From tasting what heaven must taste like, to sucking down a spicy, heavy mess, is just two opposing forces competing for dominance in one's mouth.  Plus the spicy marionberry makes your mouth hot, but not in a \\"good\\" way.  It made me feel like I was coming down with a fever blister from strep throat.

The serving line guy was apologetic, but not having an entr√©e available during dinner isn't good. Strike One\\n\\nSo, I  went to choice #2-Shrimp and Grits. I added a side of Mac and Cheese that I remembered fondly from my last visit along with a side of mashed potatoes and gravy.

Well done!\\n\\nStarted in on the dinner with the mashed potatoes. Yuck! The gravy looked so rich and tasty, yet when I took my first bite, it didn't have much flavor at all and the potatoes were bland as well. Bland + bland = bland. I moved the side off to the side until we left so I could throw it away. Strike Two. \\n\\nShrimp and grits. I love shrimp and grits. I've had it in South Carolina, I've had it in NOLA, I've even had it homemade and in Dallas by NOLA transplants. When a restaurant advertises soul food, it needs to be done right. My first bite led into disappointment. It looked so good just like the potatoes and gravy, but came up bland. The shrimp was cooked so well...plump still. Sausage was plentiful in the mix, but lacked any sausage flavor. The sauce....it was missing the soul seasoning that takes it from good to great. So disappointed. The grits were really good. Not very cheese, but creamy was sufficing at this point. However, I didn't pay $15 for a good bowl of grits. Strike three.\\n\\nThe last side to try was the mac and cheese. SO THANKFUL it was just like I remembered it. Creamy, great cheese favor, pasta cooked just right...only issue was the side wasn't bigger to make up for the bad experience with the Potatoes and the Shrimp/Grits combo.\\n\\nI really came in with the high hopes that this visit would be a good one. Great would've been bonus...but left with neither. When I come back into town, I won't have that same excitement about the Coop as I had today prior to taking my first bite.

One only needs to look around at the beautiful and finely-detailed wood work, and all the ornamentations, to recognize this fact.   And, it is quite easy to get caught up in looking around the restaurant when you first arrive -- as opposed to your menu, and forgetting why you're there in the first place.   Locke Ober makes a very fine, and respectable presentation and it is perfectly understandable as to why they expect a certain level of attire from its customers who want to eat in the dining room.  \\n\\nThe menu is reasonably diverse.   Expect to find a decent amount of steak and seafood dishes including a very nice selection of sides to accompany the a la carte entrees, as well as appetizers and salads.   What I did find somewhat surprising, however, was the fact that on the dinner menu, there were no chicken entrees.  Not one.  Yes, roasted duck was available, but, in my opinion at least, duck is not a substitute for a nice chicken entreee.\\n\\nPortions were bountiful, and understandably, commensurate with the well above-average pricing.   Then again, at Locke Ober, you truly do get what you pay for.  And then some.\\n\\nService = impeccable.   Prompt, attentive, and personable.    Never had to ask for a drink to be refilled, and our staff accomodated every request. \\n\\nWhile Downtown Crossing certainly is not somewhere I would go out of my way to visit, Locke Ober easily is, and this restaurant truly is the proverbial needle in a haystack of run-of-the-mill chain eateries which have seen to overcome this area of Boston.\\n\\nReservations are recommended."},{"name":"Kyma","address":"3085 Piedmont Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I have been here once before and it was so stellar that it warranted a second visit.

I would probably rate a little lower but the drinks were really good and the space is super pretty. I just really expected and hoped for more.\\n\\nMy main issues (that went into this rating) were:\\n1. The space is meant to be social (no wifi), but the seating was oddly spread out (making interactions difficult) and the music/space was so loud I could barely hear what anyone in my group was saying.\\n\\n2. There is no signage or information about where to order and how to order. The counters are set up with ipads, but because of the way the counter is set up, I wasn't sure if I needed to speak with a barista or not at any point of my interaction. I was the only one at the counter the whole time, but all 3 people working behind the counter pointedly avoided eye contact with me as I tried to figure out what to do. A simple sign saying \\"ORDER\\" or with an arrow would've helped me more, to be honest.\\n\\n3. The prices! I am a huge fan of premium coffee. I don't bat an eye paying over $5 for a latte or ordering $20 coffee beans online. However, the pricing here just really seemed out of sync with the quality they offer. Yes, the drinks are good. But there is really *no way* to justify an over-$7 iced coffee drink (that is half ice), or a nearly $7 mocha. There really isn't--no matter how fancy the coffee place (which, by the way, this really isn't--or at least they don't expressly state anything about the quality of their coffee). \\n\\nBeyond those actual, real problems that contributed to my rating, a few other things irritated me (but I'm not factoring them in to the actual rating, because they're way less objective):\\n\\nI desperately, desperately dislike coffee shops who \\"take a stand\\" against wi-fi by stating it's because of wanting to reinforce social interaction. More than likely, it's just easier not to deal with wifi and moochers. I get it. But please, don't try to solve a ~social problem~ with many facets by imposing your judgement against my desire for wifi. It's obnoxious and insensitive. If you're going to do that, make your space more interactive to support your claims. (Also, how does ipad ordering even factor into the need for more social interaction? I'd be curious to find that out).\\n\\nAdditionally, the service was somewhat rude--I couldn't find anyone to help me with the ordering system and I was not acknowledged by anyone when receiving my matcha drink. However, later on, I was with a friend who had major customer service issues with her order (her drink was never put through but the baristas kept telling her to wait her turn) and I saw the owner or manager making huge efforts to smooth the whole situation after it was all figured out. So that to me said a lot about the care the cafe puts into its image at least, which I appreciated."},{"name":"Hopdoddy Burger Bar","address":"1400 S Congress Ave, Ste A190","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"This place is also known as Heaven on Earth.

Neither the lobster dumplings nor the calamari were very good. The dumplings looked lovely, but were kind of flavorless and had no crunch as advertised on the menu. Almost all of the calamari was overcooked and very rubbery, the breading wasn't that tasty, either.

We were seated, ordered wine and then waited for a VERY long time for the waitress to return.  The restaurant wasn't even full yet.  She finally returned, asked for our \\"appetizer\\" plate decisions (all the plates are relatively small), and insisted that we wait to order the rest, even though we had been waiting so long we had pretty much thought through our ordering for each course.\\nShe then waited until we were FULLY finished with our first course to order the second.

Tacos are honestly all good- they're small, so order 3 or more if you're hungry; portobello, shrimp and fish are my favs (all in corn tortillas). Typically, I get the shrimp banh mi rice bowl-- brown rice, yummy shrimps, coconut curry sauce and peppers! They offer Honeysuckle gelato for dessert- if you haven't had it, it is delicious. As far as drinks go, they are on the smaller side, but are all made with fresh hand squeezed juice and nothing artificial.

I'm sure there are \\"regulars\\" that come here as well.\\n\\nTheir menu is a little hard to navigate.  They have a casual menu, which is also a happy hour menu, and then, at 6pm you get to pick ONLY THE ITEMS IN RED for half off. This did NOT include their version of Crab Louie for 24.00! Yikes! I decided not to have that.  That's also the general feel. Very spendy, and well, for the prices, the size of the orders should have been bigger.  I had to try their savory mushroom bread pudding. For one, never had it, and for 2, I like that kind of thing. It was not half bad, though it basically reminded me of Thanksgiving stuffing. It was also a small portion.  We also shared the brussel sprout salad. I expected mostly brussel sprouts but instead got green salad sprinkled with about half a dozen halved brussel sprouts. Their menu may have been written by someone that actually did not serve, or eat the food because what it described, was not exactly what I got.  We also got their calamari. And for dessert, we had their creme brulee because I'm a sucker for that dessert. It was creamy and sweet, though they did not serve it warm and crunchy on top.  \\n\\nWe love jazz, but because we got there right after work we did not get to imbibe, as they don't start until 7:30pm. There's a piano in the corner just waiting for the music to start.  Maybe we will come by again and sip on some drinks in the dark, by candlelight, and hear some music next time. \\n\\nWe did go outside as National Train Day is the next day so we snuck a look at one of the cool trains that were on the track!

With a group of 5, we were able to try to few things, as well as ordering a few waffles with different sauces.\\n\\nAfter looking through the menu, I opted for the Fricasse, which is braised short rib that comes with 2 fried eggs, roasted potatoes, caramelized onions, arugula, and smoked applewood cheddar. The short rib was full of flavor, making it a perfect choice if you're looking for a savory dish for your brunch.  The eggs were over easy and I loved it when the yolk broke in half and runs all over the ribs, potatoes, and onions.  It also comes with this huge grilled rosemary Foccacia bread that's perfect for soaking up all the remaining sauces!  There's a heavy dose of rosemary though in the dish and the bread so if you're not a fan of the powerful herb, then think twice.\\n\\nMy favorite has got to be the Tagine though.  It's rare to not see a benedict of some sort on a brunch menu but this is the closest thing that comes to it because of the 2 poached eggs it comes with.  Besides a hollandaise sauce, there's an addicting spicy tomato stew with Mediterranean spices, and comes with merguez sausage, sundried black olives, and cilantro.  It has just enough kick to make you keep eating.  The sausage is not overly fatty and the olives and cilantro completes the Mediterranean flavor of the dish.  For the Foccaia bread, it also comes with this great hummus with mint leaves that makes it refreshing.  \\n\\nThe Paella is their take on the traditional Spanish dish.  Comes with a baked egg, curried orzo, Hungarian chorizo, zucchini, red pepper, roasted corn, grano padano, watercress, tomatoes, and avocado.  Yea, that's a party in your mouth for sure!  I still prefer my paella done the traditional way though!\\n\\nAs for the Canard Confit, if you're expecting a duck leg, you're way off.  It's actually sandwiches with shredded duck confit, sour cherry compote, brie, and anjou pears between pecan craisin sourdough. Watercress and caramelized pecans are on the side.  It's a little disappointing since we were expecting a juicy fatty duck.  For us it kinda defeated the purpose of the duck but nevertheless, the sandwich is still really tasty and I especially enjoyed the sour compote.  Definitely makes you pucker a little.\\n\\nAs for the waffles, we got to try out 3 sauces: milk chocolate lavender, fig orange marmalade, and the raspberry caramel.  The caramel was definitely my favorite since the raspberry adds a little bit of tartness to the caramel and with the slightly crisp yet fluffy waffle, it's just perfect.  The milk chocolate lavender is interesting and the chocolate is extremely rich and tasty.  I'm still not that big of a fan of lavender though.  As for the fig orange marmalade, imagine a perfect orange marmalade with just a slight hint of fig.  The waffles are a little small but I guess they found that magic formula to have that perfect crispy & fluffy texture.\\n\\nThe drinks selection is interesting too!  White chocolate pistachio mocha, dark chocolate mocha, milk chocolate lavender mocha, and vanilla latte were a few that we tried.  Favorite's the dark chocolate mocha!  Others were a little too sweet for me.\\n\\nOf course they have your typical mimosa, and some other interesting alcoholic drinks for brunch.  \\n\\nIt's a great looking place with the decor and the service was awesome as well. \\n\\nPrices for entrees were around $12-$16 and the waffles run a little over $4.  It can definitely add up so it's best to go with a bigger group if you want to try things out.  They also take USD!\\n\\nExtremely popular so expect to wait a bit!

Although the delivery driver was nice and arrived on time, my food was cold by the time he came. The mustard lamb was extremely dry and not at all like what I had ordered before. The Shahi Navratan Korma I ordered was a mixed melange of random vegetables. I seemed like they had thrown in leftover vegetables that were going bad. I also asked for my dish to be spicy.

The spice had me sweating.\\n\\nThe only thing that was somewhat disappointing was that the latte and cappuccino were very bitter. I added like four packets of brown sugar, added some cream, heated it up, and it was still bitter. This may just be fine for an ardent coffee drinker. But for an Indian chai drinker with a sweet tooth and dislike for anything bitter, including beer and most alcoholic drinks, I essentially had to gulp the cappuccino down. Should have gone for the hot chocolate or at worst the latte with a flavor like lavender, which the time before was just about fine (but not quite, therefore the switch to cappuccino which turned out to be worse).\\n\\nThe atmosphere of this place is really great with stainless steel glasses for water, most dishes being served in a skillet, and a furnace fire in the open kitchen.

Usually rainbow trout has a delicate, almost sweet flavor. This one had a fishy, unctuous flavor, and the texture was dense and kind of unpleasant. The sauce was OK, but why were there so many onions in the dish--saut√©ed with the side of asparagus in addition to diced raw on top of the fish?

Delicious. Falafal? Amazing. I loved that I could build my own bowl out of all of the ingredients that I loved. We would go at least once a week, often twice. Then they took away the roasted cauliflower, which was a bummer because it was my fav. Then they took away the pickled cabbage, my 2nd fav. I was getting annoyed, but I understand that not everyone loves cauliflower and cabbage as much as I do. Then they took away the marinated mushrooms and a few other options. Still tasty, but I was bummed.\\n\\nThen I went yesterday and they have completely taken out the do-it-yourself aspect, and now you have to order certain menu items with the ingredients pre-picked. This strikes a big blow to my enthusiasm for Yalla. I completely understand (and am sympathetic to) changing circumstances, but it seems like this place has gone through so many changes in the last 5 months that it's barely recognizable. I love veggies, and I loved that I could stuff my bowl (or laffa) with all of the ones that I love. Now I'm stuck with a shwarma laffa with just hummus, Israeli salad, and eggplant. I'm sure that these changes are a reaction to being busier than they expected (good for them!), but it seems like they got the fans that they did based off of delicious ingredients and a DIY system. Changing this up as soon as people positively respond to it seems counterintuitive, and I definitely won't be coming as often in light of the changes.\\n\\n\\nI hope that these changes prove to be a better system for the crew, but Yalla can no longer hold the special place in my heart that it once did."},{"name":"Monica's Trattoria","address":"67 Prince St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Delicious homemade pasta and friendly servers.

Sooo freaking good. I had been wanting to go to Blue Star ever since they've been open. My bf and I woke up really early Saturday morning to come here since I heard they sell out pretty quickly.  We got there 5 minutes before they opened and there was already a line. They didn't have the ones I really had my heart set on the day we went but that didn't stop me from polishing off 5 doughnuts on my own. Between the two of us we ordered 1 of each of the following doughnuts: Dulce De Leche, Passionfruit with Cocoa Nib, Old Fashioned Buttermilk,  Bacon with Real Maple Frosting, Bread Pudding, Key Lime and Lemon Curd, Vanilla and Sugar and a Chocolate Almond Ganache. Big fatties I know...\\n\\nDulce De Leche : It was fantastic and my favorite one. The flavor were spectacular. Notes of caramel, creamy and rich but not too sweet. It basically melts in your mouth and the toasted nuts sprinkled on top gave it a nice toasty flavor.\\n\\nThe Passionfruit with Cocoa Nib: Fresh and fruity. You could really taste the passionfruit and the cocoa nibs gave the doughnut a great textural contrast. Very good.\\n\\nOld Fashioned Buttermilk: I'm not usually a huge fan of Old Fashioned doughnuts but Blue Star makes a great one. Light but dense enough almost like a pound cake. The outside crust/glaze was delicious! It was crusty and crunchy on the outside and soft and pillowy on the inside. The buttermilk flavor really shined. \\n\\nBacon with Real Maple Frosting: Delicious and smoky. You can tell they use very good bacon. I also liked that the bacon was crumbled and sprinkled all over the doughnut so that you got a little bacon in every bite. \\n\\nBread Pudding: This was okay, a little mushy. Just stick to the doughnuts:)\\n\\nKey Lime and Lemon Curd: The curd itself was a little strong but the doughnut was good. I liked that this was doused in powder sugar yumm. \\n\\nChocolate Almond Ganache: Super rich and gooey. The toasted almonds provided nice contrast and crunch.\\n\\nVanilla and Sugar: Light, fluffy subtle vanilla flavor. Good but nothing special.\\n\\n They use a brioche dough to make all their doughnuts and they make them fresh daily until they sell out. They were pretty perfect... Fluffy, chewy, rich, but light all at the same time. Everything you would want in a doughnut. I also liked that they weren't too sweet.\\n\\nHands down the best doughnuts I've ever had. I seriously cannot wait to come back to try other flavors. I really wanted to try the Creme Br√ªl√©e, Horchata and the Valrhona Chocolate Crunch but they didn't have those that day. They rotate flavors so hopefully I'll get lucky next time. I am still dreaming about the Dulce De Leche doughnut. I guess im okay with Seattle not having a Blue Star Donut because I don't think I would have enough willpower. If you are ever in Portland, do not miss out on this place...

And even though I think Myers + Chang does loosely have this M.O., it was still a solid dining experience with some tasty, inventive dishes. \\n\\nI enjoyed:\\n- Short Rib Soft Tacos: my favorite dish we ordered; the pear, radish, and chili-sesame sauce gave the short ribs a nice balance of sweetness and texture\\n- Braised Pork Belly Buns: with brandy hoisin sauce; no complaints\\n- Dan Dan Noodles: chewy noodles with peanut sauce and a little bit of a chili kick, but, disclaimer: a really small portion size\\n\\nI'd skip:\\n- Vegetarian Tofu and Broccoli Chow Fun: akin to ordinary Chinese take-out  \\n- Fried Chicken and Waffles: creativity points for a ginger-sesame waffle, but the chicken itself wasn't particularly flavorful or juicy\\n\\nAnother small gripe: everything is intended to be served family-style and brought to the table as it comes out of the kitchen, but  we found that most dishes were not easily shareable because they were messy, too small to portion out adequately, or that they were items like a steak of fish or a half-chicken that should really be individual entrees. A smaller table size of between 2-4 people is probably ideal. \\n\\nI will say that they are remarkably accommodating here for various dietary restrictions (ie: menus for vegetarians, and those going nut-free, gluten-free, and/or shellfish-free), and I like that they have brown rice available.  \\n\\nThe nice interior atmosphere made for good times. I was a fan of Myers + Chang's trendy-meets-kitschy ambiance (hot pink lighting, lanterns strung up, and Chinese newspaper pages as placemats).

I had chicken scallopini but it tasted like sweet and sour chicken from a bad Chinese take-out restaurant. The chicken was so dry it was not edible! To top it all off my friend ordered a second glass of wine and they poured an old, acidic wine from a carafe into her glass. She complained and sent it back. We walked out very disappointed.

The decor is relaxing and comfortable but not typical of coffee shops. Java Central is devoid of the quintessential coffee colored walls and modern abstract art. The feeling of this shop, I would define as \\"abstract victorian\\" and not in a bad way. When you walk in the front door, it seems as though the shop is just a small front room. But don'd be deceived! The shop has two large comfortable sitting rooms with both relaxing couches/chairs and tables to work at in the back and a comfortable side patio. Definitely the best place to go to think, write your next paper, or just relax. Be careful on Friday and Tuesday nights though, if you're coming to be in a quiet place. Every Friday and Tuesday local musicians are invited to do both group and individual \\"open mic\\" nights. Sometimes it gets loud, but if you stay in the front you are fine. A great place for almost any occasion!\\n\\nFood: Here you will find the typical lattes and coffee mixtures with a few in house specialties. A bit lacking on the side of teas though. Java Central would do well to introduce a higher grade selection of herbal and non-herbal teas. From what I have seen, the food is pretty limited and basic. Your typical coffee shop fare. \\n\\nService: This is the only reason that I am not giving five stars to Java Central as I would like to. The majority of the staff are friendly and willing to serve you, however, on multiple occasions I have come and been either rudely disregarded by a barista who is busy texting while I was trying to order or on other occasions I felt like I was inconveniencing the person behind the counter with my simple order. This is quite the contrast to any Starbucks or mainstream coffee shop where there is an across the board expectation of good service. As I mentioned before, most of the people here are great, but some of them are a little curt and could use some customer service training.\\n\\nOverall, this place is in my opinion the best option for a coffee shop or study area close to Otterbein campus or in the Polaris area. Particularly if you are tired of the drab unsurprising atmosphere of the rest of the coffee shops in the area. Work on the service and this would be a well earned five stars!"},{"name":"Gus's World Famous Fried Chicken","address":"117 San Jacinto Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Delicious chicken !

We ordered the brown rice separately. I think they were a little stingy with the rice because paired with the sauce, it was a soupy mess and I didn't order rice soup. However, I'm giving them a 3.7/5 overall because I did enjoy the flavor of my food.

The shrimp and/or scallops in spicy olive oil were perfect--not overwhelmingly hot. The night's special, a roasted boar stew, was practically licked out of it's bowl. Kobe beef empanadas melted in your mouth. The artichokes with romesco were well fried, perfectly crunchy. Sangria was tasty. Chocolate cake was a great finish.

Good.\\n\\nHopdoddy serves a good burger. If I were to assign a subjective numeric value, I would say it's about 125% better than PTerrys (the king of fast food burgers) 30% better than Casino El Camino and 10% better than Wholly Cow. On a good day, that might put Hopdoddy in about the top 2 or 3 burger joints in the ATX. \\n\\nNow let's discuss price. Aye there's the rub. Burgers are between $8 and $12. Doesn't sound like much but start adding some fries, toppings and a drink and you're looking at a $25 meal. Probably about double my ordinary burger tab. Is it 2x better than any of the other options mentioned above? No way. The extra $$$ I pay for my gourmet burger seems to go toward keeping up the trendiness and smarminess of this place. Also, why am I tipping? The line is longer than Disneyland and I ordered at a counter. I've had two occasions where the burgers came out cold which is unacceptable for the prices charged. \\n\\nDon't get me wrong. They can serve some of the better burgers in Austin... and the customizable shakes/malts are better than sex. (Can I say that on Yelp?) I get mine with Godiva liqueur and crushed chocolate pretzels. Note: This will make your meal over $30. Also, a great selection of real soft drinks. Yes, an above average burger indeed, but the disproportionate price and service makes this place a RIP and a very solid 3 star. \\n\\nSummary: If you like waiting in a twisty, awkward line, opening your wallet and shaking all the contents out for a decent chance at having a great burger, this is the place for you. If you prefer a less pretentious burger joint with more reasonable prices, you will have better luck at one of Austin's many other burger bars."},{"name":"The Breakfast Club","address":"270 Western Ave","city":"Allston","stars":"4","text":"Recommended for casual diner-style breakfast.\\n\\nFood: Typical diner fare done well.

The meat was tender, but tasted like nothing and things like 'balsamic onions' which should impart something to the dish, did not at all. The completely bland focaccia did nothing to help the situation.\\n\\nThe waffles have been inconsistent at best.

I'd recommend the slaw. The Burke came on a perfect baguette- crunchy yet soft inside.  It was a lot like the mild flavor of KFC, but fresher and decent sized cut cabbage.

I will definitely be back here again to enjoy some drinks and hang out in the cool atmosphere, but I don't like that they don't offer a lot lighter fare options. I enjoyed the chicken on my \\"Saucy Cock\\", yes, that's really the name, but I didn't really want to eat it on a massive donut. I ended up eating just the chicken and, while I liked the taste of the donut and chicken, I ended up pushing most of the doughnut to the side of my plate. I didn't see anything on the menu that I would feel okay about eating more than once every few months.

I didn't eat it, and I would have just liked a smaller portion, actually, not a donut, because the chicken and the chipotle mayo and blue cheese crumbles were soooo good! Sadly, most of it had been sort of \\"melded into\\" the massive donut bottom half, and due to the lighting, it was hard to decipher what exactly I was eating. \\n\\n-Slow down the service. This also sounds stupid to complain about, but our service was rushed. It was good, it was over attentive, and it was just too fast, too hurried. Our waitress kept trying to take our plates, our orders, our half empty beer bottle, my plate when I obviously wasn't done... and then asked us immediately about dessert while I had food in my mouth and was still eating my dinner. She knew we weren't in a rush, and yet we felt rushed.

We went for lunch, and pre-emptively arrived exactly at 11, in attempt to avoid the massive line.  Even when we got there, right when it opened, we were the first to be placed in the outdoor line, which only took about 10 -15 minutes. Overall, we waited for a total of 30 minutes, tops.\\n\\nThe service: amazing, the efficiency boggles my mind.  They have someone taking your order while you're waiting, and someone walking around with samples, all to make your wait entertaining and bearable. Meanwhile, there is also a hostess that walks around to the line to assign each customer to a table.  After you order, the food comes out in a very timely manner, and brought to your assigned table by yet another waiter specifically assigned to your table. Given how busy this place is, the level of service, and the efficiency with which it functions is quite impressive!\\n\\nThe food: scrumptious.  The buns are home made, and fresh out of the oven, so it carries a buttery scent, only matched by the fluffy texture when it melts in your mouth. We also ordered a side of fries with queso con chile.  The fries are amazing, and the queso very fiery. \\n\\nI can now say with confidence that I completely understand the popularity of this place. Even with the ridiculously long lines, we were in and out within 1.5 hours, and were stuffed with our delicious meal.  Also: the additional added bonus of validated parking doesn't hurt.

I had the house margarita and the sangria (lush) and both were excellent.  The guacamole was fab too, and having had logs of homemade Mexican guacamole in Mexico, I'm spoiled. Unlike most restaurant guacamole which is too mild, this one had just the right amount of lime and cilantro.  Big ups for using corn and not flour tortillas!

But I don't plan to come back so now I spent $4 on admission (for two) plus the $5 on the coupon. \\n\\nThe best thing at the market was the Bretzles (pretzels) by Artisan Bake Shoppe for $1.50. They were made just how I remember German pretzels to be. Everything else was overpriced, and/or not what I expected! The small crepes from the Cafe Bretagne were $7ish. The baked potatoes were around $8.50 (though they did look good!). Bratwursts were also $8ish. There is also a cheaper gluhwein (mulled wine) at the back of the market ($6 instead of $7--I felt like the theme was me getting swindled). Also, I expected the raclette to be a pile of potatoes, with raclette cheese, gherkins, and picked onions on it but it was more like a glorified grilled cheese sandwich (for $7). \\n\\nThe ornaments shop, the fruit soap store, and toque store were neat. But I wasn't in the mood to buy stuff.  I wanted to eat good food. I did eat a good pretzel... but obviously that wasn't going to fill me.  So we walked over to Fresh, Local, Wild http://www.yelp.ca/biz/fresh-local-wild-vancouver (not in the Market) and got a delicious $5 chanterelle poutine."},{"name":"Hopdoddy Burger Bar","address":"1400 S Congress Ave, Ste A190","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I like their Ahi Tuna burger and the addition of the wasabi chip and bean sprouts.

Yum!\\nThe Schlow - it's a cold sandwich and the sliced wheat bread definitely isn't as satisfying as a toasted bagette. The meat is very good and tender, but beware - the tomato confit and caramelized onions give it very sweet taste. \\n\\nThe other huge pro is the extensive beer list - makes it a great place to just hang with friends. \\n\\nCons -  the $12-$15 price tag was a bit steep for me for a sandwich.

I'm not a big fan of donuts in general. I do like a fresh, plain glazed Krispy Kreme about once every 3 years.  For example, I would only go back to Voodoo Donuts if they were paying me $100 a donut. I'd be able to gag down one of their concoctions for that level of that financial recompense. That being said, Blue Star should change its name to the Blue Star Cake-in-the-shape-of-a-donut Store. Because for the most part, their stuff is not like the yeasty, sugar-glazed gems that float off the Hot Line at Krispy Kreme. They're delicious, rich, sweet, heavy, dense cakes that have a hole in the middle. They're made of high quality ingredients (not peanut butter and Oreos), have interesting flavor combinations and are utterly unpredictable. The only way to find out if you'll like a weird combo like Raspberry Rosemary Buttermilk is to taste it. I loved it; you may not. The store downtown is always crowded and often sells out of the popular flavors. The airport store had no lines. Also don't make the mistake we did when we went there the first time. We bought a DOZEN. We got Valrhona Chocolate Crunch, Blueberry Bourbon Basil, Meyer Lemon/ Key Lime, Passion Fruit Cocoa Nib, Maple Bacon, Lemon Poppy, Chocolate Almond Ganache and the others I don't remember because I lost the ability to think and developed short-term memory loss after about 4 donuts. So if you're coming to Portland and you want to sample a lot of the Blue Star flavors, bring plastic bags (or more PC waxed paper) and a container you can take with you because Death by Donut is not pleasant no matter how delicious they are!

The toppings were very flavorful, but I can see how my friend's plan of ordering the waffle plain could also work, as the waffle itself was so delicious.\\n\\nSeeing how small the waffles were, I was really glad we also ordered savory breakfast items. I shared the oeufs cocottes with a friend: baked eggs with smoked cod, saffron potatoes, and dill, served with focaccia.

The eggs were a little light and a little fishy, but otherwise quite nice, and definitely not the type of breakfast I'm accustomed to.\\n\\nThe place is tiny, and it got pretty crowded by the time we left, so I think we came at just the right time at 10am, after breakfast but before brunch/lunch."},{"name":"Medina Cafe","address":"780 Richards Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"I had breakfast here once.

My wife's grouper was overly salted and well done. My poached salmon was unlike any poached salmon I have ever seen, dark, well-done, with a hard crust on top no less, dry and flavorless. I've had better poached salmon in a hospital cafeteria. In fact, I have doubts whether this fish was even poached; it looked more like a piece of smoked salmon from the grocery store with some sauce poured over it. If it had been poached then it was left under the warming lamp to bake. The vegetables were limp. Should we have asked the waiter for replacements? Perhaps, but it had been a long week of hurricane recovery, we were tired and simply chose not to make a fuss, eat the food and go home.

Each bite is a sensual experience, almost too pleasurable to have in a crowded restaurant. Unfortunately, this franchise was relatively unremarkable. I hope they take my review as constructive criticism and work out the kinks in their preparation and cooking techniques. I'm giving them  four stars, three for the food and one for bringing Gus's to Austin. We will come back and hopefully then I will be able to give them five stars.\\n\\nOur server, Rachel, was terrific; however, we didn't come for the service, we came for the chicken. Too bad it was slightly above average, but short of exceptional."},{"name":"Hopdoddy Burger Bar","address":"1400 S Congress Ave, Ste A190","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"My new(ish) favorite place to get a burger in Austin. It can get pretty packed, but for good reason. My recommendation is the Ahi Tuna burger--it has these crispy wasabi things that just take it to the next level."},{"name":"Hopdoddy Burger Bar","address":"1400 S Congress Ave, Ste A190","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Hopdoddy was on my NO WAY, NO HOW list while it was being constructed.  I figured this sterile looking joint couldn't produce anything to compare with my favorite burgers at Nau's, Counter Cafe and Your Mom's.  But, some good word of mouth and their reasonable prices convinced me to give Hopdoddy a shot.  Boy, am I glad I abandoned my principles because they are the real deal and probably my new favorite burger in town.\\n\\nThe regular burger with cheese and bacon is delicious, but, if you are a fan of turkey burgers, do yourself a favor and order the Continental Club.  It's the best turkey burger I've ever eaten.  Imagine a juicy turkey patty with a slice of provolone, fancy bacon and a dollop of pesto.  It's a triumphant combo of flavors.\\n\\nBesides the burgers, the chili cheese fries are so, so, SO good.  The perfectly seasoned golden fries come with a side of chili con queso that is so scumpdiddilyumptious that I grew my fingernails out so I can scrape the sides down.  Also, their milkshakes, while pricey, are excellent.\\n\\nWhy am I withholding the fifth star?  For a handful of petty reasons:\\n\\n1.  Ambience.  The ordering area is just fine, but the main dining room is kind of bland.  The long brick wall with Austin photos is such a yawn and the photos aren't interesting in the slightest.  Also, too many TVs.\\n\\n2.  Veggie Burger.  The Janis Joplin is just not that good in my opinion.  The taste was very earthy, the texture was doughy and it fell apart after a few bites.\\n\\n3.  Silly Sexual Puns.  I like a dirty joke as much as the next guy, but it feels so forced and lame in this context.  \\"We slap our patties and they like it.\\"  \\"Who's your doddy?\\"  \\"Our buns are big and white, just like yours.\\"  Really?  (Ok, I made that last one up.)\\n\\nIn the end, Hopdoddy may make bad jokes, but they make great (meat) burgers.

The rice balls are sweet and the soup base is this mild, sweet rice wine. I've only found this dish in one other restaurant in Vancouver. \\n\\nSo far, from what I've tried, the dishes are authentic and done to perfection (in my opinion). Nothing is either over or under-cooked, and the seasoning is neither too much nor not enough. To cater to the general population and make dishes easier to find, the spicy and non-spicy dishes are separated in the menu. I would definitely be back and I'd love to work my way through the menu. \\n\\nAmbiance wise, the restaurant is a bit cramped, without much decoration or seating.

This is more like a 4.5 star review because I feel the prices need adjustment.\\n\\nWe went at about 5:30 PM on a Saturday of opening week. We were seated immediately, but by about 6:15 the lobby was packed. You might want to call ahead, but this might change as the new wears off. The booth seemed a little small, but the dining area wasn't crowded. It was quite noisy though; don't expect an intimate date night. There were plenty of kids there but I'm not sure I'd call it kid-friendly. It was noisy enough people might not notice a loud kid though; that might be a plus.\\n\\nThe menu's big and is all over the place. Pizzas, burgers, salads, fish; it was kind of like The Cheesecake Factory only not quite as bewildering. The pizzas look interesting, but I decided on a Pirahna Pale Ale Chili Cheeseburger. My wife got some kind of cajun pasta dish. Neat tip: you can nix the chicken and go shrimp-only on some dishes even though the menu doesn't say so. Maybe we paid more for it; I didn't check.\\n\\nThe cheeseburger was a true knife and fork affair; it was served open faced because no way could it be eaten like a normal burger. I found it quite tasty and prepared well, though the chili was much better than the burger part. My wife's pasta dish was a pasta dish; it's hard to get blown away by pasta. I was born and raised in Louisiana and no one ever seems to get that \\"Cajun\\" means \\"spicy\\". Portions were big; my cheeseburger was too much and my wife had 2 meals from the leftovers. This balances the prices; I paid $10 for a chili cheeseburger with fries and hers was maybe $15.\\n\\nService was OK considering it's the first week. Some of the waitstaff seemed inexperienced, but everyone seemed nice and willing to please. I was *just* starting to think it was taking a while to get my food when I heard my waiter complaining to a manager that we'd been waiting a while, then the manager apologized. They were *busy* so I wasn't concerned; the food showed up shortly afterwards.\\n\\nI'm not a beer snob so I'll leave those reviews to someone else. I got the Pirahna Pale Ale and liked it, but my wife's Jeremiah Red was better. They've got a list of brews that the restaurant makes and they range from a few lights to some stouts and porters; there ought to be something for everyone.\\n\\nIt cost us $40 to get two entrees and two pints of beer. I think it probably should have been more like $35 and could have done with smaller portions to offset it. I'd like to try a pizza and see if those are worth the price.\\n\\nMy only regret is I got so full from the cheeseburger I couldn't order one of the pizookie desserts. It's a cookie in a deep dish cooked like a pizza smothered with various ice cream toppings; it reminds me of the Cookie Monster dessert at Cheddar's. I'll be back for it.\\n\\nI'm not sure what could make this a 5-star restaurant. The food can't get much better without higher prices; trying to make it quieter ruins the sports bar atmosphere; lowering the prices doesn't really offset either of the two. I'd say I walked in expecting a three-star experience and I got a little bit better than 4.

Red Fish with Brioche Crust on Ham Grits and Applewood-smoked Turnips\\nThis is the South -- they know how to make grits and smoked ham.  Mix them up to get the dericious base of this dish.  Slices of smoked turnips are layered on top, followed by a beautiful piece of red fish, and capped with a thinly-sliced piece of toasted brioche.  Grits, smoked ham, and perfectly cooked fish.  This is a winner.\\n\\n2. Grilled lamb loin, merguez sausage, eggplant, falafel, and pickled persimmons\\nI am a sucker for merguez sausage.  So many places do it; so few places do it right.  Barley Swine forms theirs into a 1\\" x 1\\" log, grills that, and then slices off a 1\\" piece for a perfectly grilled 1\\" cube.  Lamb loin is cooked medium and has just the right touch of pink.  Falafel balls give the dish a bit of texture to contrast with the tender and juicy meats.  It works.\\n\\n3. Crispy Pig Ankle, Grilled Foie Gras, and Beans\\nHello Californians, we've got foie here!  Perfectly prepared just as you remember from ye olden days of 2012, served with some house made hot sauce to give you a bit of bite with your fatty foie.  The pig ankle is fork tender and perfectly burnt on the outside.  This is a not-to-be-missed dish.\\n\\n4. Hefeweizen donuts, smoked pork ice cream, whiskey foam, whiskey marshmallows, and chile geles\\nI could do without the foam (it's /so/ 2010), but I could eat those donuts with the melted/toasted marshmallows all night long.  Pork ice cream is exactly as advertised with sweet and salty in one item.  This is whole piece of pork, and not bacon.\\n\\nGot high expectations for your food?

My husband and I have been talking about going here for what seems like 3 years.  We decided to do it for my birthday this year and boy was it a treat!  The creativity in each dish was surprising and fun! \\n\\nLet me start from the beginning.  We had reservations for the 2 of us and 1 friend, so party of 3.  We were seated and explained how it works -14 course set menu with drink parings (you can opt to not have the drinks pairing as well).  Let me just say that I love easy and not having to make decisions.  Everything about Barley Swine is easy.  From the purse hooks underneath the table to the drinks paired with my dish - simple.  \\n\\nWe started off with a bang and one of my favorite dishes of the night was the the crab cantaloupe.  It was so refreshing, the perfect cold dish and something I could eat on a daily basis.  My next favorite dish was the octopus watermelon.  It was literally art on my plate.  It looked like a gorgeous abstract painting that I would purchase to hang in my home.  I did decide to eat the beauty however.  The octopus was almost cheese like and by far the best I have ever tasted. The next highlight for me was the duck, plum, potato plate.  OMG this was definitely a comfort type food.  The duck was perfectly cooked and just the right amount of tart and sweet.  I loved it. On to the dessert portions - the 2 stand outs for me were the vinegar pie and the peach waffle.  The vinegar pie was unlike anything I would have thought I had, but so familiar at the same time.  I reminded me of a twist on a key lime pie.  Then there was the peach waffle ... basically a mini ice cream sandwich.  Delicious.  Of course there was another surprise at the end but if you are reading this right now I will not spoil the surprise for you!\\n\\nThere was a combination of wines and beer that paired perfectly with every dish.  My favorite was probably the Rose that was served to us, which was not on the menu. Oh and the dessert drink was a 2011 Diamante Semi Dry/Roja/Spain and I loved it too.   \\n\\nI loved how the atmosphere here is small and I suspect from every table you have a view of the action going on in the kitchen.  I loved watching the expediting station.  Seeing all this happen is definitely part of the experience of coming to a place like this.

I would highly recommend going as a large party and just sharing amongst the group to avoid confusion since there are so many yummy things and also because everything is served family style so you never know what is coming. We tried so many things, but probably the most memorable would be the wok roasted mussels, charred udon noodles, and the tiger tears. In fact, if I am to go back with just my g/f, this is probably what we would order. we also had this amazing whole fried black sea bass (crispy whole fish) that was so much better than I expected based on the fact that whole fish scares me! also noteworthy and very tasty were the tea smoked ribs and the braised pork belly buns. It was just one continuous wow as the food just kept pouring out. the owner even delivered a dish to our table which I thought was very cool. I remember at one point in the meal hearing dispatch being played which resulted in a perfect state of nirvana. the waitress was also really cool and very skilled at recommendations. rather than asking, \\"well, what do you like?\\" she just shot from the hip with some wonderful recommendations based on what people seem to order, even mentioning that people come from NH to get the fried chicken !

This second time was very upsetting which is why I'm leaving the review. \\n\\nThey are pricey but I knew that from my last visit, I didn't have to wait as long as I did last time (the first time it took over an hour for one wrap and a coconut milk) I ordered a half wrap and a coconut milk again. It looks like they've updated since the last time I was here, today they had sort of a subway station where you can watch them make the wrap. The people were very friendly but extremely slow, what upset me this time was: I ordered the coconut milk that actually comes in a coconut which I find to be aesthetically pleasing and great in taste. The cashier opened my coconut for me and I guess cracked it...he told me to grab another and I informed him that mine was the last one so he replied \\"we'll make it work\\" with a smile, he went in the back and came back with it open. I noticed it was wet but thought that it maybe just splattered when he opened it, I get in my car and drove 15 mins down the street sipping and noticing hardly nothing was coming out, I look in my cup holder when I get home and see that all of the milk was in my holder! He cracked it all the way through and must have known but still charged me and still gave it to me! This was quite upsetting because I'm thinking it's like $4 since my total came up to $16.50 for half a wrap and the coconut. It angered me so much but I was already home and didn't want to waste my gas turning around for a refund/exchange.

No one said high prices means the restaurant needs tablecloths. For high prices, I expect quality food, prepared correctly with great service. This restaurant is not unique or inventive and the prices are criminal. First of all, the snow crab legs were over cooked. When snow crab legs are over cooked, the meat dries out and does not come out of the shell cleanly or easily, rather it sticks to the insides of the shell. The legs were only of average size to boot.  The \\"one pound\\" lobster roll is a joke. They claim to use all the meat from a one pound lobster in their roll. Doubtful. Practically all the meat was from the claws.

Awesome. I know that when I order food at establishments that don't have gluten-free menus, especially in fast-paced casual joints such as this one, I can't necessarily expect totally gluten-free food to emerge, and getting sick is a risk I periodically take.

Ordered a breast and 2 thighs. First thigh: Freaking great fried skin! Meat was so moist and hot i for got the chicken was made to order. I sat at the bar and saw the cooks constantly sticking a thermometer at every piece of chicken to make sure its done right. No huge pressure cooker cooking massive amounts of chicken here. They get your order and cook it fresh so keep that in mind... This is not a fast food fried chicken place, ya hear!\\n\\nThen comes the breast - another surprise for me. I ate some skin which was as good as the first piece, cut some breast meat and it was super moist and good! I think this meal converted me into liking chicken breast and yes, I liked the breast here better than the thigh!!! (I think I've always liked thighs because they are never dry compared to regularly cooked chicken breast). As I ate the 3rd piece, I kept thinking about the breast and how moist and yummy it was. Yes, yes yes! The chicken breast here is so good, I now understand why people prefer this usually bland cut of chicken.\\n\\nSo this is really what southern fried chicken cooking is all about. Finger. Licking. Good. Next time I come in, I'll walk in  and scream out loud \\"Who cookin that chicken back there? That chicken gooooood!!!!\\" \\n\\nTip: If you are coming in during lunch hour, try your best to be here at 11:30am. If you get here by noon, you will have to wait a while to be seated as you will be competing with the office folks, convention center folks (walking distance from here) and other folks.

These types of restaurants tend to attract patrons with a distorted view of what constitutes a well-executed meal. That being said, if you're expecting super-sized portions at fast food prices, then this isn't the type of place for you. In contrast, if you appreciate innovative ingredients and well-thought-out flavor profiles, then Flip Burger is certainly worth your time, money, and effort. \\n\\nFood: Flip Burger is a boutique burger restaurant with menu offerings that will please individuals from both the vegetarian and carnivorous persuasions.  In addition to beef burgers, they also offer a variety of \\"flip burgers\\", including turkey, shrimp, \\"fauxlafel\\", lamb, chorizo, tuna tartare, vegetarian, and fried chicken. A la carte sides are also available, such as French fries, salads, onion rings, fried pickles, sweet potato tots, potato salad, brussels sprouts, thai bouli, and sweetbreads. They also feature a handful of outstanding liquid nitrogen milkshakes (~12 ounces).\\n\\nService: In contrast to other local burger restaurants, Flip offers full table service. However, the caliber of this service definitely fluctuates with patron volume. I've dined here during the weekday and experienced excellent service, but have also dined during peak weekend hours and experienced horrendous service. \\n\\nAtmosphere: The d√©cor at Flip is modern, tasteful, and welcoming. Clientele is varied, but there aren't typically a lot of families or young children.\\n\\nCost: Moderately expensive, but commensurate with the prices at most other boutique burger restaurants in the city. Burgers generally cost $7-$13, sides are $4-$8, and milkshakes are $5-$8. \\n\\nOther: For the price conscious, Flip Burger offers a $10 prix fixe lunch from 11:30 AM to 2:30 PM each day, which includes a choice of burger (classic , turkey, or vegetarian), side (fries, onion rings, or sweet potato tots), and a fountain drink."},{"name":"Desta Ethiopian Kitchen","address":"3086 Briarcliff Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"1.

I like to support black owned businesses, especially this being the only Nigerian restaurant, I felt conflicted to write this review. I visited this restaurant 3 times over the past 3 years and never ordered delivery before. My first two experiences back in 2015/2016 dining in were really good. So recently, on the Saturday of memorial weekend holiday, I ordered via Uber eats. My order was jollof, beef suya, plantains and an order of meat pies. An order of meat pies on their site says $8.00 comes with 4 pies in total. When my delivery came there was only one. I called them and mentioned I got  just 1 meat pie for. They responded and confirmed what I already knew, that I was missing three additional meatpie from my order. They said maybe the kitchen gave me 1 meat pie because they are now selling individual meatpie so for $2. However on their website and on Uber eats that was not an available option. Meatpie price was $8. I mean even the receipt itself said meatpies, as in plural. so how does that justify giving me just one. So I  asked for a refund of the meat pies order. They refused. Instead of owning up to their mistake, and removing that charge like most restaurants do, they wanted to take off $6 as a price adjustment. When they realize they couldn't do that  they assured they would at least contact Uber eats. I didn't have the confidence they would follow through so I contact Uber eats myself twice. Nothing. Uber didn't even mention that they contacted them. So I contacted of them Sunday and Monday as well. For me it's not even about the money, it's more so the principal. They did not do their due diligence. When I ate the rest of the food, the middle of the plantains were still raw, the jollof and suya were ok. My intial experience with Suya Joint has been on the decline. They were really good when they first opened. I'm not sure what has happened since then. From 2 weeks ago, I never got my refund since, or at least offered in store credit or the very least someone to deliver my missing food that night. They were more busy pubbing a Davido concert happening in Rhode island rather than  paying attention to ensure orders are correct and prepared well out of their establishment.  It's a shame they are that greedy and fail to deliver on quality service and food expectations. They honestly need to do better.

Our food took over a hour to come out which by the way I ordered as soon as we walked in because it was late and I was trying to be considerate to the waitress cause I knew they closed in a little under two hours. So when our good got there mine was super cold clearly it had been ready for a long time and just sitting In the window while she was busy flirting around. I literally saw her hand her number out twice! Horrible service, I even talked to a manager and he was zero help he just said we have 45 min tickets at the moment and I'll see if we can find your waitress. Took him a while to find her by the way. I won't ever come back to this hooters go to any other location, it's worth the drive.

Friendly and attentive staff made it even more of a fabulous experience. I had the schnitzel, my dining partner had the beef. Both dishes among the finest we have ever had. Bauhaus is a welcome new addition to our Vancouver dining options. But be prepared this is unlike any other experience you may have - expect better food, better presentation and a cool factor missing from many others to put it mildly. Its just better and we are lucky to have found Bauhaus. I also loved the open kitchen by the entrance. I look forward to my next meal at Bauhaus.\\nThe only suggestion I would have is the lighting was slightly too bright. I can overlook this with meals like the one we had!!

I can see why.  We were seated quickly, and a server took our drink order, a peach tea and a house margarita.  Both nice.  We tried the veracruz and baja fish tacos and the chicken tacos.  They are small, but flavorful, served in a fresh corn tortilla.  I added jalapeno slaw to my baja fish tacos, which added just the right amount of kick.  The salsa verde is wonderful, and the guacamole needed a bit more jalapeno heat in my opinion.  Overall, this is a 5-star experience if you want tacos in a comfortable beach shack.

They have a buy 4 get 1 free deal (which we didn't even know, so that was a pleasant surprise)!  The bad:  One of our pizzas had the wrong toppings.

Maybe it was the super friendly and super clothing coordinated hostess and wait staff (all wearing plaid shirts, jean shorts and tights underneath...sign of the times or dress code?), maybe it was the even more coordinated cooks (all wearing primary colors**), maybe it was the fact that the bathroom was pumping Fascination Street by The Cure, or even the obligatory affluent-bachelor-type guy at the bar eating alone and reading Al Franken on a Friday night...OK that last one maybe not, but I was getting waves of good vibes from this place the moment we walked in...and by the way I'm not a vibes person at all.\\n\\nMore importantly and substantially, this place had a great beer menu, and for someone who's caloric intake consists 2/3 of fermented substances, that was a truly awesome thing.  I can't recommend Allagash White enough.  It's a lady's beer, cause I 'm a lady.  Also check out the Old Chubb Scotch Ale, recommended by our kick-butt, all-red waitress (hair, clothes, probably aura). \\n\\nFor food we hit up the reviewer faves of brussel sprouts, scallops, and rabbit stew.  The brussels were just as satisfying as previously mentioned.  As for the scallop dish, who would ever think of combining scallops with curry?  Answer: Awesome people do.  While the curry was a bit overpowering the taste combination was still a pleasant one, like getting your back scratched...by someone smelling of curry.  The rabbit stew was super rich and all sorts of salty wonderfulness and totally bumped rabbits up on my animal ranking order for cuteness and yum factor.  We also tried the short ribs w/ celery root.  Really fresh and new taste combination for me, which I loved.  The texture  of the short rib was a little chewy, but it was still a great dish.  \\n\\nEvery dish was served in courses and presented beautifully.  Double snaps for making a second scallop dish for us when I went  to the ladies the first time they tried to serve it to us.  That's some crazy good service right there folks.  We finished the night with more libations and that ridiculously adorable chocolate mousse cup.  \\"Oh, look at me. I'm a mousse with a cute whip cream hat!  And that cookie? Oh that's just for panache, or macaroni, as you yanks call it.\\" Seriously, that's what it was saying to me.  I wanted to take a picture of it and send it to Cute Overload.  \\n\\nAlso, by sitting at the bar you get dinner and a show.  I would never in a million years have the balls, being a lady I never will (have balls), to have an open kitchen.  The Barley Swine-ers cook away in front of you, with an expediter calling out orders constantly. People say you can talk to the cooks, but seriously I didn't want to break their concentration.  Everyone staring at you hustle and bustle without the ability to make loud penis jokes.   That's some crazy pressure.   Double snaps for that! \\n \\nAnd for the yummy-ness, freshness and locally-sourced-ness of it all, this place is VERY reasonably priced.  I'm not saying I would pay more, cause I'm cheap, but in an alternate universe, I totally would say it.\\n\\n** The Bryce was wearing red like Heather Chandler...Corn Nutz"},{"name":"Amrheins","address":"80 W Broadway","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I've been coming here for years and never been disappointed, however I miss the rounded booths. great place to watch the game and have a drink or two.

I'm not the type to wait until it's my turn to order to hem and haw about which sandwich I want.  Her unspoken demands for ordering efficiency are unreasonable.   As a for instance, there is a salad that I particularly like of there's, but it's winter and I wanted a damn sandwich.  I asked her if they could just take everything that is on that salad and put it on sourdough. 'No.'  Now listen, I get wanting to maintain the integrity of the menu you've created, but people make substitutions all.  The.  Time.  I wasn't going to waste time telling her that that was stupid or be a jerk by creating my own sandwich with precisely those ingredients because how hard is it to slap bread around something you already make?

The wraps are pricey but soooo worth it. Expect to pay about 20-25$ per wrap. But they will last for at least two meals because they are the size of a newborn child. They taste soooooo good. I recommend the Punany (yes that's the name) or Dat Ish. They give you options for the spice: Spicy, Mixed, or Mild. This place does an undeniable job of seasoning their food. You can SMELL the seasoning from outside. It has such a nice home-feel. Very family friendly. They support other local businesses as well with their beverage and dessert options! Homemade Joy and Freebird are the two vegan cookie companies they sell and they are both sooo good. Although I prefer Homemade Joy because the cookies are bigger and don't fall apart like Freebird. The seating is intimate and chill. The only thing I would say I'd like to see change is the way the line works. They have two lines. One for call ins and another for walk ins but they both sort of just blend together and no one knows what's going on when it gets crowded (which it gets crowded). I also love the vendors outside.

A Lavender Latte from Cafe Medina. The only problem? I'm in southern California and Cafe Medina is in Vancouver, BC. \\n\\nAs I lay there with my eyes closed, trying to muster up the willpower to get out of bed, I started thinking about not only the Lavender Latte but the exquisite breakfasts I had at Cafe Medina on our recent trip to Vancouver and any momentum in getting my day started was completely lost.\\n\\nI envisioned the racks of miniature waffles spied through the front windows, that came with such delectable syrups as Chocolate Lavender, Raspberry Caramel, and White Chocolate Pistachio Rosewater. I remembered picking up the waffles and dipping them into the different syrups and getting some on my fingers in the process. I recalled licking the sweet stickiness from my fingers and delighting in the slightly tart creamy richness of the Raspberry Caramel and the luscious floral decadence of the Chocolate Lavender Sauce. Paired with the smooth and luxurious Lavender Latte with its leaf inspired foam design, it was  an indulgence everyone else should have an opportunity to enjoy at least once in their lives.\\n\\nThen I daydreamed about the Fricass√©, a signature dish of the restaurant that is composed of  Fried Eggs, Braised Short Ribs, Roasted Potatoes, Caramelized Onions, Arugula, and Applewood Cheddar with a side of grilled Focaccia. The oozing yolks stream down into the tender short ribs, potatoes and onions, mingling in with the melting cheddar tempered with the cooling peppery bite of arugula leaves that altogether create a mouthful that can only be described as heavenly. I also longed for the Tagine, an extraordinary dish on their breakfast menu made up of delicately Poached Eggs in  a Spicy Tomato Stew with Red Peppers, Merguez Sausage, Moroccan Olives, and topped with Cilantro. A little exotic, hearty, savory, spicy, and absolutely mouthwatering. Words really do no justice to that dish, it is possibly one of the best things I've had for breakfast ever. For a bit lighter fare, the Oeufs Cocottes (Baked Eggs with  Smoked Sockeye Salmon, Artichokes, and Cream Cheese with a side of Tomato Pepperdew Dill Salad) is fluffy with the tang of cream cheese and the slight briny saltiness of smoked salmon- delicious.\\n\\nAs I slowly came out of my reverie to face the sad reality that breakfast at Cafe Medina would definitely not be happening that morning, I was a little bummed out because the desire to be there and relive all my favorite dishes was overwhelming. I spoiled myself instead with snoozing in a little longer and dreaming of the day I'd be back having that Lavender Latte and Tagine for breakfast again.\\n\\nPhotos and more at my favorite blog- http://www.alamodejournals.com/index.php/2010/02/vancouver-medina-blue-water/"},{"name":"Cherrywood Coffeehouse","address":"1400 E 38th 1/2 St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Pros: \\n-The food is good.

Probably the most underrated item on their menu. If you want something light and healthy, go with the turkey.\\nSausage - terrible. I don't even want to know what goes into this recipe, but it ain't right. \\n\\nSides: \\nPotato Salad - Horrible. What were they thinking? The potatoes are undercooked, chopped into cubes, and slathered in a greenish-yellow sauce that tastes SO peculiar that it's hard to even describe. I know that they were going for something \\"different\\" with this recipe, but it does not work. Randall's has better potato salad without even trying. \\nMacaroni and Cheese - Amazing. It's probably loaded with so much butter and fat, but boy is it worth the gluttony. \\nGreen Beans - Good and simple. The only problem is it's not always available, which is a problem when you want something green but don't want one of their overpriced salads. \\nBeans - Basic. Nothing to complain about. Nothing to brag about. \\nPeach Cobbler/Pecan Cobbler - both are made from the same kind of over-buttery breading, and both are way too rich.

We absolutely loved working with Bonnie. She's very organized and has a no non-sense attitude toward wedding planning.  Someone I fully trusted throughout the catering and planning process.\\n\\nMy wife and I both love food --- love to cook, love to read about food, love to try new dishes and new restaurants.  So when we got engaged, we knew the food would be one of the most important parts of our wedding, and we also knew that we didn't want to do the traditional Hill Country BBQ/TexMex Texas thing, or your standard rubber chicken. Instead we wanted to go with Southeast Asian street food as an homage to my wife's grandfather, who was a street food noodle vendor in Viet Nam. But, Laguna Gloria insisted we go with one of their preferred vendors and it was actually difficult to find one in Austin that could pull off Asian food. We did tastings with four caterers, but settled on 34th Street almost immediately because they were the only ones who could pull off really authentic Asian flavors --- they had two chefs on staff who loved Southeast Asian food, and they really knew their stuff. Bonnie was willing to work with us to create an truly unforgettable menu that fit within our budget -- featuring items like tuna larb crisps, banh mi canapes, green papaya salad, mee goreng, coconut & pineapple braised pork shoulder, crying tiger spicy hangar steaks, and more.  And our guests loved it --- people were raving about the food to us all night, and some were even taking pictures of it and posting them to Facebook.\\n\\n34th Street also handled all of our event vendors from lighting to table cloths to linens. Bonnie helped us come up with a timeline for the wedding events, helped us map out our tables and the flow of the evening, and also helped us devise a workable rain plan for our outdoor wedding. She took care of everything -- we didn't even need to hire a wedding planner. And, when our lighting vendor did not create the lighting effect we had wanted at our wedding, Bonnie was able to get us a refund.  She also kept me calm when I started freaking out about the possibility of rain --- and she was right, it was a beautiful night.  And on the actual day of our wedding, 34th Street's servers were attentive, responsive, and gracious. They made sure to save extra cake us, and for my elderly grandmother who couldn't come to the wedding. One server in particular kept a close eye on my wife and me to make sure we always had some food in front of us so we wouldn't starve by the end of the night, and kept a cold beer in my hand. \\n\\nWe were very, very impressed with Bonnie, Eddie, and 34th Street.

I've now been here twice and had a positive experience both times. The food is great, they have a solid beer and wine list and creative cocktails.  I've been here for seafood apps and a burger. The crowd is a mix of tourist and locals, younger and older.  There is always a lot of staff, whom I feel are very attentive. The first time I went was the afternoon of the 4th of July. My sister and I were escaping the impending rain and got a table on the deck. We had the Fish Dip and Mussels.  The Fish Dip changes daily and is made with the catch of the day each time.  Basically, it's dip made with fish (kind of the same consistency as tuna fish) served with chips. I love it.  The mussels were delicious and a perfect amount for two people to share. When I asked questions about a peach cocktail, the bar tender ended up making a more sophisticated version of a Fuzzy Navel.  I appreciated that they were accommodating and willing to experiment so that I could get a peach drink that appealed to me. And it did.  After two cocktails, we then ordered  a half dozen oysters. I like that Sea Level posts each day where the oysters have come from.  \\n\\nThe second time I went, I was with a friend, whom I could not convince to get Fish Dip. Instead, we got the calamari, which was cooked to perfection (i.e. not rubbery) and was lightly battered. The balsamic glaze and horseradish sauce it was served with were tasty. My friend thought the latter had a kick, but I thought it could have been \\"kickier\\", and I'm a horseradish lightweight.  We both got beers (I got a tasted of a draught because clearly I'm so fussy - PITA - about my drinks.)  My friend got the lobster roll, which had a generous amount of meat with a light mayo lemon coating. She thought it was on the lemony side, which she liked, but I might not have. (I prefer lobster, clams and oysters leaning toward plain.)  I had the bleu cheese burger, which was sensational. I had asked for it medium rare, and it was almost rare.  I took my chances on that and am still here to tell the tale.  The bleu cheese on the burger was not overpowering and was well-balanced by the sweetly caramelized onions on top. The seasoned fries that came with my dish and the homemade chips that came with my friend's seemed to be made with a lot of care. I loved my fries but was too full to finish them. (They are served in a little paper bag, in case you do have room to finish them and want to take them with you.) Overall, I'm liking Sea Level a lot.

Truly, it's not too hard to figure out, but a person might feel uncertain and uneasy at first.\\n\\nI personally love how simplistic the menu is - 9 burger choices, 2 salads, and a variety of sides and (really great) drinks.

After asking for recommendations, Janis Joplin won - at least my first visit - and James ordered the Llano Poblano.

But it failed for us specifically for a few different reasons.\\n\\nFirst, when you walk in, no one greets you.  There are two lines of salad bar, completely the same.  Just grab a tray and plate and begin assembling your salad.  Easy enough.  BUT, when you get to the end of the line and pay, you have to wait to be seated by someone.  This wouldn't be a problem if there were enough seats.  Unfortunately, there are not.  So, now you're standing there with your food in hand (and your kids' food too), blocking the aisle/walkway, waiting for a table.  Other people who have also paid for their food are quickly joining you in waiting for their own tables.  It's a HUGE problem that needs to be addressed.  I mean, if there aren't enough tables for everyone to sit at DO NOT let more people go through the line, only to wait at the end, holding heavy trays of food, blocking aisles, and trying to keep their children out of everyone's way.\\n\\nSecond, the items on the various bars are not labeled for the allergy conscious.  A nice, simple GF (gluten-free) or DF (dairy-free) would be great on the salad and soup bars!  Or allergy warnings like \\"Contains Dairy/Soy/Gluten/Peanuts/etc\\" wouldn't be hard to do.\\n\\nThird, there isn't enough protein on the salad bar.  The most you'll get are some blended up hard-boiled eggs.  Or, if you can safely eat an already assembled \\"Featured\\" salad located at the beginning of the bar, you may find a bit of chicken in it.  Otherwise, don't count on getting your protein here.\\n\\n\\nOn a positive note, my kids did enjoy eating a variety of foods, since they have no allergy concerns.\\n\\nBottom line:  If you have no food allergies, and aren't concerned about the amount of protein you consume, give it a try.

I have been a customer of Chipotle since its stage of infancy and have been frequenting your restaurant where ever I go. I must say that on September 17, 2015 at approximately 5pm I walked into your location at Ponce De Leon, Atlanta, Ga. I ordered my usual chicken bowl and a worker that I am not familiar with was on the protein because my wife usually goes in, she gave me a half of a spoon of chicken I asked her to make it a double she then added a few pieces more then I said to her make it a triple and asked for the manager, this location is known for giving a smaller than usual portions that anywhere else I have patron.  It is one thing to be generous and another to short change your customer.  I was attempting to explain what transpired he got real nasty to me, he did not want to hear what I had to say instead he put my bowl to the side and said \\"you not going to pay for it\\", I replied to him yes I'll pay for it but I would like to have the Regional Managers information he quickly replied \\"you want it go online and find it\\", he refused to give me any further information. He never greeted me nor made eye contact he gave me the once over and he kept moving about like he was very disinterested with my concern. This is not my first encounter with one of your Managers at this location. This location has a different culture than that of any other Chipotle I have been to, the Managers, Eric and Paul Arias here seem to be more of dictators the workers are always on edge. My family and I have been going to locations further out to avoid having to deal with these rude Managers but were reluctantly forced to come back because the everywhere else was way too inconsistent with the food, not enough seasoning on the protein rice being too hard, tomatoes too mushed. All of this attitude was unnecessary. I feel that there should be a better way to measure extra protein because each associate puts a different amount on the spoon. It should not be at their discretion if I am paying an extra $2 dollars and in this instance an extra $4 dollars. Your cashier noted that his cards was located at the front by the register that was the only assistance I was offered.   \\nYour reception area was filled with patrons and I find that it was in utterly poor taste that one of your frontline representatives sought out to speak in such a demeaning manner as he did.  We are well known at this store and it is quite perturbing that your frontline employee handled one of your normal customers in such a distasteful fashion. It was a misunderstanding that was easily fixable without negative condemnations. No customer should ever be subjected to this repugnant attack. I truly believe that this store Manager needs to be offered additional training in how to effectively deal with his customers.  With all that being said, I have been to Las Vegas, Gainesville FL, Virginia, Miami and Orlando and your restaurants are always consistent with great food and service. The Managers are super nice it seems that only in Georgia I have noticed that once in a while is the normal when it comes to the food.  The food is never the same at any of these locations it depends on who cooks. The Howell Mill and Cobb Parkway area we stopped going to, Roswell is too far and Ponce it's a shot in the dark sometimes.  If I may add this is the only location with the presence of a security guard. \\nI look forward to going out of town because I know that I am getting a better quality of food. I really believe that Chipotle has a great product. I know how good Chipotle tastes. My family and I will continue to be loyal customers but I really feel that this could have been avoided.

That is more than $2 a piece which is terrible.  \\n\\nI would say that both times I visited, the service was okay.  At dinner, the server did not know how the clams on the pizza were cooked.

This to me was just like an average breakfast spot, not the ones that are amazing and make you want to bring every out of town guest here to try. They do give you a large portion of food. I came here with a group of 9 ppl and no one left hungry. \\n\\nKeke's gives you lots of food when you order one single dish. You definitely leave full. Their waffles and pancakes are huge. Their pancakes look super fluffy and good. I'm not sure how they taste because I didn't taste them. I did try the waffles that also look big and fluffy. To me they were not that good. It was like a bunch of bread but had no flavor. I have had places that serve some good waffles and pancakes and this to me just did not speak volumes. \\n\\nWith a group of 9 ppl we ordered different dishes such as the Blueberry Stuffed French Toast, Florida Waffle, Pancakes, Eggs Benedict, Oatmeal, and Omelettes. The blueberry French toast was good. I really enjoyed that. The Omelettes weren't bad. The waffles as I said before were not that good to me. The ppl that ate them enjoyed them. They tasted very bready to me. The Eggs Benedict was good. Most of the dishes are served with home fries. My major complaint of everything was that my food was not served hot. My dish must have been the first to be cooked then sat out while waiting on others. My eggs Benedict was served luke warm and my breakfast potatoes were served cold. I had to ask for fresh ones. Another member of the group was also served cold food as well and asked to have her pancakes reheated in the microwave. They just brought out fresh ones. The breakfast potatoes also lacked seasoning. They were just thrown in a pan and steamed or lightly fried with MAYBE a pinch of salt .. Literally a pinch -- don't blink bc you may have missed it. They need a little more work.\\n\\nOverall, KeKe's wasn't horrible but I have had better.

Get this.\\n\\nNext we had some tuna tartare...again, crazy good. Simple flavors that really highlighted the fish. The fried polenta with sweet and regular potatoes. OMG. I hope they serve this jawn at brunch, because I can imagine that sweet crispy goodness soaking up some bad decisions. \\n\\nNow...the main event. The entrees. Holy I am in culinary heaven Batman. Honestly, the gnocchi confused me, and it was a bit too rich for me, but it was really good. (Chef Jeff lived in Italy and studied pasta, so if you are into carbs, this is your jam).

Will say there are a lot of beef items, and as a non-beef eater as well, do wish there were more options for flexitarians.  However the non buffet menu does have other options for chicken entrees for those that wish to do so.  My favorite is the vast assortment of basmati rice dishes.  The grilled vegetables and basmati rice dishes were my favorite.  Only reason they did not get 5 stars is the desserts are not allergy friendly as I'd say 95% of all items have nuts.

The peanut butter-blueberry compote tasted like a PB&J sandwich... but the texture added a fun twist. Meyer Lemon and key lime curd - nothing too sweet or too sour, on point.

They accomodated us very quickly, in spite of the overflow crowd and were very attentive to our needs. We sat on the outside patio which was a little cool (temperature wise) and a walk to the buffet line but it was a relaxing atmosphere with an opportunity to mingle with fellow diners. We engaged on varying subjects such as the Bruins sweep of the Flyers and the best apps for the new IPad someone had gotten as a Mother's Day gift. The clientelle was an interesting blend of the old time 'Southie' character as seen in 'Good Will Hunting' (Matt Damon and Ben Afleck) and the new suburban yuppie that has moved back into the city. The food choices were plentiful (tons of choices) and the quality was good (what you'd expect from a brunch). I thought the dessert quality and variety was especially good. It was an 'all you can eat' deal, so of course, I stuffed myself beyond my normal limits just so I would feel that I had gotten proper value. In the end...gourging, or not, I thought the $20+/- price tag was fair and if anything a bargain for a brunch of this scope. My only thought was that maybe a juice choice or two could have been thrown in along with the coffee...probably nitpicking. The interior decor of the restauarnt was classic mahogany, brass and glass which lended itself to a very pleasing ambience. There is a long bar with comfortable looking booths and tables.

Not much of a coffee guy, but I can appreciate an amazing sandwich!\\n\\nLet me start off by saying, I've eaten what some may consider an unhealthy amount of bacon egg cheese sandwiches to obtain the level of pickiness and appreciation I have for them.  As someone who generally cooks and eats on the healthier side, they are a definite weakness of mine.  Render has THE BEST BREAKFAST SANDWICHES I've ever eaten, period.  Rosemary Frittata, bacon, and pepper jack is what you want.\\n\\nRender is the only place I've ever been to that I don't feel I can make a better BEC (bacon egg cheese) at home.  What makes a Render BEC great you ask?  Well here's the 5 steps for BEC greatness:\\n\\n1. Ample amount of CRISPY bacon (check)\\n2. Tasty Egg - could be fried in the bacon fat, spices added, etc. - Render accomplishes this with their awesome rosemary frittata (check)\\n3.

I went with two friends and we had pretty standard stuff -- onion pakoras, veg samosas, lamb masala, chicken korma, chicken tikka masala, a bunch of different breads.  Aside from being enough food for the Russian army, it was all very fresh, and with herbs and spices seeming fresher and more aromatic than what you usually get.  The breads were right on -- came out kind of staggered, my paratha with the entrees, an order of keema naan a minute later and an order of keema paratha shortly after that, so they're clearly being made to order and were wonderfully fresh and tasty.  All in all, this was a really delicious meal with friendly waiters and excellent service.  We specified medium for the spiciness level of everything, which I thought was fine but my two friends seemed to think was pretty hot (\\"It's hurting me\\" one said), so I'm guessing it's hotter than the typical northern Indian place.  Adjust your spiciness requests accordingly.  \\n\\nThe interior of the restaurant is quite nice, but the patrons are casual and the tables are about as close together as is typical in Allston (meaning you're not on top of your neighbors, but you don't have quite the amount of room you might like if you want to stare into someone's eyes and get goopy).  There's a flatscreen on the wall playing Indian music vids, which are all over the map.

That is why I was around the area and decided to eat there. \\n\\n  Right from the start things were going sour very quickly.

The Waiter stared at me like I had 3 heads and said they don't have it with an attitude. Apparently they are very limited on toppings for the Pizza, Geeez how the F*** Am I supposed to know, it is not displayed clearly on the Menu. As A business he should have just explained to me and my guest what was available not have me guess and look foolish. \\n\\n2- We ordered a side of the Lamb Barbeque---nothing to say about it besides it was burnt in the outside, very undercooked in the inside (7.99$) didn't quite tasted as expected. \\n\\n3- HERE COMES THE PIZZA!!!! It was an extra cheese with Chicken topping Pizza; The size was decent for 2 people, the looks of it were quite disturbing. I have never seen so much greece--oil liquid on the top. It was messy, I was furious when I discovered the Pizza was not cut in slices. It is the eaters responsibility to use utensils to cut it into pieces. THAT IS UNACCEPTABLE!!!!  The taste was perfect on the cheese and that is all. The Crust was terrible, burnt and very tasteless. The amount of Chicken we had in the Pizza was what I consider an Insult... Total 5 small chicken pieces on the Pizza, not enough. \\n\\n4- THE FUNNIEST THING; \\n  Since we ordered 1 Cheese with Chicken topping, I don't know what the Waiter kept talking about because after he delivered the Pizza (It appears its just Cheese from the outside) He said he was going to bring the Chicken Pizza later on. That made me and my guest very confused. It seemed he thought we ordered 2 different  Pizza's. I was in no mood for arguments or inquiries so we came to a conclusion that if this second pizza arrived we would just take it home. Anyways, he passed by us about 3 times and kept saying the same thing that the Chicken was coming. It made no sense whatsoever. By the time we finished the first Pizza the second one never arrived. I quickly asked to be given the check and he seemed spaced out on what to charge... The price was very good though. If this place was expensive I would have given it a 1 Star and would have been pissed.\\n\\nConclusion:\\n  With the 30 $ bucks i spent here I would have been happier going to Domino's. This place has to be visited once in a lifetime just experience it, words cannot describe...

My partner's burger was good too. The shrooms were earthy and fresh, but the avocado was unevenly spread across the burger making for an elusive perfect bite. \\n\\nBottom-line is that this is a self-conscious SOCO establishment that has quality burgers and ingredients, and knows how to keep a line moving.

Lastly, the zuchini fritters elevate an often pedestrian dish - they're light and fluffy with some cheese and shredded zuchinni (not the more common spears or slices).\\n\\n2 The dessert. The best baklava I've ever had. It was earthier and round in flavor and the pistachio ice cream that accompanied it was perfect. The Galaktoboureko (semolina custard pie) were also sublime and reminded me of apple pie even without presence of apple. The loukoumades were kind of the throwaway of the bunch.\\n\\n3.

We arrived 15 minutes early for our reservation. The hostess/server/manager (I think she does it all!) met us at the door and frantically told us the table isn't ready. The restaurant is pretty small with no bar area so sitting with a drink wasn't an option, but with only a 15 minute wait going anywhere else didn't make sense either. We decided to just wait around during which time more people with and without reservations came by and she promised everyone a table (not sure how this was going to work since they place was full and, again, small). 15 minutes later she tells us there still isn't a table and she doesn't know how long it'll be but it will be soon and why don't we go somewhere to have a drink. That didn't really make sense to us, particularly because I don't think she was actually paying attention to who had a reservation and who was a walk in. I was starving and didn't want to risk missing our table. Lo and behold, our table was ready 5-6 minutes later (which was not enough time to send someone off to another place to get drinks.....). \\n\\nI write all that because it just started the evening off on an odd foot and so that you don't go any earlier than your actual reservation because then you'll be stuck in this weird situation. Aside from this though, the service was very friendly. \\n\\nAnyway, the place is tiny, but feels nice and cozy. You can easily come here with friends, family, or on a date. The menu is typically Italian. Another odd feature: they have like 6-7 specials (some of which I think are \\"specials\\" very frequently) but none are written anywhere. Instead the very intense woman lists them off for you from memory. Good luck remembering any of them on the first try! \\n\\nFor drinks ordered wine by the glass (pinot grigio and montepulciano) both of which were great choices. We were starving and also ordered an appetizer immediately. The arancini were A+. Put a couple more on a plate and I would have happily had them as an entr√©e! I had the sweet potato gnocchi special, which was just ok and I probably should have ordered something else instead. Oh well. My husband had the shrimp with angel hair pasta and a white garlic sauce.

Despite the menu clearly offering the option, it was difficult to convince the cashier that I wanted my chicken salad sub cold and without the melted cheese and three hundred condiments that she said come standard. While waiting a surprisingly long time, two of the sub makers yelled at the cashier about my order (\\"What do you mean not toasted? Why doesn't she want cheese?\\").\\n\\nWhen the bag was finally handed to me (with a smile, which was nice) the sub itself was smaller than expected for the price. Pressed inside the top of my sub, I found a pickle wrapped inside a plastic lunch bag. Because napkins were not inside the bag, this resulted in my hands being covered in chicken salad before even taking a bite. The pickle, however, was worth the effort. The bread was good, but tasted maybe a little old. The mayo to chicken ratio wasn't quite right either - very wet. With the exception of that pickle, it was an unsatisfying experience overall.

Parking is ample, you just might have to walk a bit depending on what time you go, since you have competition with mall goers and all the other restaurants that are around. The interior is amazing. They have multiple fish tanks and the lighting and decor is very modern. \\n\\nTheir menu really does match the name of the restaurant. They offer various types of burgers - your traditional beef burgers, but also sushi burgers. And they also offer a variety of sushi - your typical California-roll type sushi rolls for those that don't quite like raw fish, along with the more fishy rolls, and finally also the fusion burger-sushi rolls. This time, I came with two other people, one of which enjoys anything with hot sauce or jalape√±os in it, and the other that loves sushi. We decided to get their crab rangoon appetizer (never disappoints), the Two-Time roll, Miss Woodbury's Fresh Find Roll, Fiery Dragon Roll, and Blackened Tuna Roll. The crab rangoon dip really does have crab in it. If you like crab rangoon, you will love this dip. All of their rolls were good. Those rolls ranged in price from $16-$20 and we honestly probably ordered too much food. I would say 1 roll is enough to fill up 1 person. As far as their drinks, you can't go wrong with any of their martinis or milkshakes. If you go Monday through Thursday from 3-6, they have happy hour. It's a steal. \\n\\nService was phenomenal. Multiple people checked on us and everyone is friendly and has personality, along with jokes. If it's your birthday, members of the crew come and sing (maybe chant is a better word) a special Cowfish song and bang a gong. It's entertaining.\\n\\nOverall, I would highly recommend Cowfish. If you like sushi, burgers, or drinks, then this place is perfect. Just beware that it can get busy, as it is a pretty trendy place and right at Perimeter Mall."},{"name":"Gourdough's Public House","address":"2700 S Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"We went here after getting blown off at the one on 5th st.

Now I can't watch sports there, I have to balance my drinking to save money ($8 for 20 wings and a beer vs. $17 for 20 wings and two beers with today's wing rules), and the manager has replaced a hot girl at the bar with his pompous self.

For a nice sit down dinner, I prefer the higher price point Rumi's Kitchen down the street. But for lunch and the buffet, this is my first choice for Persian.\\n\\nOn the buffet, there is always tenderloin, marinated chicken, and kubideh (effectively meatloaf cooked on a skewer). It's a good day when the split yellow pea stew is there, which is most visits. This delightful stew is worth giving a try. If the pomegranate-walnut chicken is also on the buffet, it's a wondrous day. This dish regularly gets passed up by those unfamiliar with this place. It has a brownish color and a lumpy texture, but do not let its homely appearance deceive you. The sauce is sweet and savory, and I enjoy every bite even if the buffet treatment sometimes leaves the chicken a bit dried out.\\n\\nThe only part of this restaurant that I enjoy more when they are not having the buffet is the bread. With the buffet, the bread loses some of its personality. Fresh, hot, liberally sprinkled with sesame seeds, and a texture similar to a cracker is tough to beat. If you're lucky or ask real nice, they'll bring you a fresh thing of bread, even during the buffet. The hot tea is the other drink option (besides water) that is complimentary with the buffet.

Sorry no valet parking here.\\n\\nAs you walk up you notice they have outdoor seating, and when you go inside you walk through a gauntlet of gift baskets full of BBQ sauce and rubs. We get in line where I bet this very nice girl working here says all day, \\"Have you been here before? This is cafeteria style.\\"  It's kind of like Luby's but you serve your own sides in small paper containers, and no salad or jello here. \\n\\nYour last stop is selecting your choice of meat in front of two guys who look like their last job was serving food in a prison.  The one with knife as you what you want and frowns when you order a small amount like 1/4 pound so I got a half of brisket and two pork ribs.  You can tell they are pushing the 1 pound beef rib by having it ready to throw on my tray.  I also got sweet tea but they did have a nice assortment of local can and bottle beers.  \\n\\nThe beef prices are about 2 dollars less than the last place I ate at.  They take credit cards and might get some grease on it but it's ok. You get your classic black cup and make my  way to the tea jugs where you have a choice of sweet or unsweet tea.  Next is a counter/desk and open drawers to grab sliced white bread and utensils. Knives are not needed where the meat is so soft and moist it's easily eaten by a fork.  No plates here where you eat off of trays lined by brown butcher paper.  The sweet tea is very addictive and wish I brought a bucket.  My sides were macaroni & cheese and potato salad.  Both were good and took time away from the meat to enjoy.  \\n\\nThe brisket is tops!  Not too fatty and had a great unique Texas style flavor. I see why they are on the list.\\n\\nThe pork ribs were a surprise where it had a sweet taste to it.  Soft meat and perfectly cooked.\\n\\nI took some meat home with me and they do use plastic bags!

They started this awesome text-you-when-your-table-is-ready thing and it is pretty much the best.  No more crazy waiting and lines with writing your name on a clipboard!  This was actually implemented at least two months ago, probably longer, but it's just so convenient and smart I wanted to say it.\\n\\nAte there last night for our anniversary dinner (it was also one of the first places we ate).  So it wasn't just my anniversary dating boy, but my anniversary eating at Barley Swine!  I'm not sure which one I like more.  I'm just kidding.  I don't think I'll ever meet someone who will make me food good enough to make me cry.\\n\\nANyway!  Daily specials are usually a treat, but I wouldn't super recommend the redfish with pork brioche.  I think generally I've been less than amazed by Barley Swine's seafood, honestly, and that might be from my years living in California and New England.  Barley Swine tries to do that thing it does with all ingredients, make their flavors really swell, but I just don't feel it works that well with fish.\\n\\nI would highly recommend everything else.  I'm just going to write down what we ate and drank last night over the course of three hours:\\n\\nla fin du monde and victory headwaters: started with beers, recommended from our fantastic and fun waitress Kelly.  She was such a delight all night and I can't recommend her enough.  These beers were nice starters with what follows, light and creamy, while the headwaters still had some hop kick to it.\\n\\nwatermelon gazpacho: creamy, spicy, loved the watermelon-mint-yogurt happening, great way to start a meal.\\n\\nThai-inspired  squash salad was delightful with coconut cream tossed with a pickled-tasting ribbon of squash over some lemongrass-tasting purees and grilled butternut squash.\\n  \\nsoft duck egg, grilled zucchini, popcorn, goat cheese: there's a surprising tang to this dish from the lemon zest mixed into the goat cheese which really livens up the whole thing.  Plus the sous-vide like pudding texture of the duck egg was great.\\n \\nSCRAMBLED EGG WITH CRAB AND AVOCADO: also topped with green papaya strings reminiscent of pickled daikon and a super tasty super buttery english muffin.  Best dish of the night.  Maybe even better than the soft scrambled duck egg from last time.  The sweet savory crab meat mixes perfectly with the herbed smooth egg and the papaya strands and english muffin are a wonderful texture and flavor complement.\\n\\nhere we switched to a sangiovese and a pinot grigio, per Kelly's recommendations.  Great choices.  Note: barley swine has a wonderful beer selection, reasonably priced.  THe wine has all been quite good, but a bit pricier than expected.\\n\\nredfish with brioche special: see above.  they did have some beautiful smoky turnip greens perched on them, and fun little apple balls.\\n\\nrabbit terrine, RABBIT medallion, schnitzel, mushrooms: a tangy shishito pepper relish on the terrine and puree with basil on the bottom of the dish really made this sing.  There's pistachio mixed in the terrine, which is generally my favorite preparation of rabbit.  The medallion was OK but the terrine was fantastic!  Moist, game-flavorful and deep without being gamey.  A bit of chili on there to wake you up.\\n\\ncrispy stuffed PIG ANKLE, fois gras, beans: the hot sauce kicked up this dish to another winner, probably second-best of the whole night.  The crisp breading is perfect (as it was on the schnitzel accompanying the rabbit) without being oily, thick pieces of cartilage or tendon or whatever is in ankles are thrown in this big ol ball of succulent pork meat.  The beans were flavorful, but the buttery grillled fois gras and pickled-tasting peppers were the best accompaniment to little bites of ankle.\\n\\nfor dessert we got a coffee porter, which we were leery of, but again, kelly was our guiding light and didn't steer us wrong.  though she did recommend the fish and the doughnuts, which were our least favorite of the dishes.\\n\\nhefeweizen doughnuts, pork ice cream, whiskey foam: there was a marshmallow in there too, but I'm not sure what it was.  Also a piece of maple bacon, which was absolutely wonderful and brought an OK dish up to barley swine good.  That sweet deep saltiness with the whiskey foam and hint of mint married to super super creamy ice cream was great.  However, this wasn't a great dish, it just had very high highs when you got that perfect bite.\\n\\nGERMAN CHOCOLATE CAKE: this is the shortest description on the menu and one of the best dishes.  I know i already said the pig ankle and the crab-egg were the best, but dessert is a whole nother animal.  German chocolate puree made a subtle and mellow background to this delightful dish.  There were bits of cake-cracker like things, a huge mound of salty toasted coconut (the salt made this dish SO GREAT).  White chocolate ganache.  salted caramel ice cream.  SO GOOD."},{"name":"Hopdoddy Burger Bar","address":"1400 S Congress Ave, Ste A190","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Best burgers ever!

Very good.\\n\\nThe Benny: if you like Vietnamese banh mi, it's pretty much the same flavor profile, only with chicken. Of course, it's a lot more expensive, but we can't always find a banh mi place in the area...\\n\\nRowdy's Chicken Sandwich: Good if you're really hungry, but kind of heavy if you're only peckish.

Dancing Goat coffees make other coffees seem cheap and watery and flavorless. I usually buy a bag of coffee to make at home. The Dancing Goat Blend is good but my favorite is Ethiopian Harrarr. Which has replaced my old favorite...I forget the name but it was Ethiopian too. I remember I read the description and laughed because it said it tasted like blueberries. But you really  can taste blueberries!! It smells really sweet too. Another favorite is the Guatamala Antigua (I think thats the name). When you buy a bag of coffee they give you a free cup of their regular coffee.\\n\\nAs for the cafe itself, i LOVE the chilly goat, it tastes so good. It has a real coffee taste and is sweet. Doesn't taste like a cup full of synthetic flavors like other places. Also, I love sitting outside while drinking my coffee. Decatur is a nice neighborhood and its relaxing to sit there. The inside has tables attached to the walls, right under large windows so the tables are pretty lighted, which I like.

Other restaurants with chefs that come from that background have a serious wow factor to each bite of the dish.  This is rare to find in Vancouver I know but I was hoping that this meal would be like some I have had in top restaurants I have eaten at in Lima, London, HK and Tokyo.

First of all, I have no idea how anyone could say the breakfast tacos are any good.  Every time I have had b-fast tacos at El Chilito the eggs have been overcooked.  EVERY TIME.  Second, they charge extra for cheese?  Seriously?  Third, I am not a fan of the salsa.  They only have one salsa option for most dishes and it has a roasted flavor--it's good for some of the items on the menu, but really lackluster on others.  Here are the items I like from this place: 1. Caldo.  They hardly ever offer caldo, but when they do it's actually really good. 2. The fish tacos and fish salad. Fairly light meals but with good flavor, and they come with a different salsa--a creamy avocado type of thing. 3. The 'Vegital' Burrito.  Lots of veg, lots of flavor.  It's a good veggie option.  Why they charge you extra for guac and cheese on the thing is a mystery that can only be answered by greed--the prices are already right at the top of the range I'm willing to pay.  4. The orange chicken tacos with the grilled onions.  Can't remember the name of that dish, but it's pretty tasty, and it works with their salsa. 5. They make a not too shabby picadillo taco.

And from all accounts, Hopdoddy was the place to go to get our burger on.\\n\\nSaturday at mid-lunch rush, the line outside told us that we were in for a wait, but likely one that was well worth it. The young lady bouncer (or as I called her \\"Burger Meister\\") was very pleasant and fun to chat with, explaining the system and recommending some items to us while we waited. Once inside, we ordered our drinks and received them in the line, while deciding what to order for food. The Black Cherry Lime Ricky was very good, and the Buckethead IPA was a hop lover's dream (although the goblet could have better been a pint glass instead--at least in my book). We ordered the Basic Burger with cheese and the Prime Time--a kobi beef-based item--along with a large order of Kennebec fries. You can order your patty at two temps: Pink or Not Pink. Pink is basically a good Medium and Not Pink is Medium Well. We both ordered Pink.\\n\\nThe anticipation at our table was pretty high, based on what we had seen in the open kitchen/bakery/prep area near the ordering station. The room is busy, and buzzy, but not uncomfortably loud. The tunes were '80s hit fare, and enjoyable to us both as we're both Gen Xers. Then, the burgers arrived ... in short, they did not disappoint. The meat was delicious; moist, well formed, perfectly cooked with a pink center and lots of flavor. The bun was equally good, freshly baked and just thick enough to hold everything together, without being too large. The toppings were great: red, ripe tomato; creamy, caramelized onion; fresh, crisp arugula, sharp cheddar and the spankin'-good \\"Sassy Sauce\\" ... essentially a horseradish dijonnaise that complimented wonderfully. Being from Maine, we understand the power of the home state's spud--they are downright deluxe and you can't beat them for flavor. At Hopdoddy, they craft them into what have to be simply the best hand-cut fries I have ever enjoyed. Hot, crispy yet still fluffy inside, the flavor bursting out and complimented by the seasoning and just scrumptious with the chipotle ketchup. Yummy McYummerson. The meal was so fresh, so flavorful and so filling, we didn't have anything but a bowl of fruit for dinner several hours later.\\n\\nSo it seems, as the old saying goes, the third time's the charm.

I live in Charlestown and loved loved going to Tavern on the Water, the location, the vibe and the view are hard to beat and when Peir 6 was coming in and giving it a great makeover and better food I was so excited.  I think the main problem with Pier 6  (aside from the worst service I've ever experienced) is that they have an identity crisis.  Look, if you're going to have the worst waitress I have ever had in my life, then you sure as shit shouldn't be charging $20+ for entrees and $6.5 for draft beers.  If you are going to ignore your seated table for dinner for 45 MINUTES without offering them a drink, then be a casual cheap place that's just there for the good time where this kind of service can be excusable and not posing as a fine dining establishment. \\n\\nMy husband and I had dinner here on Saturday night, made a reservation for 8:30pm and were excited to give this place another shot (after a previous failed attempt). \\nWhen we arrived, we had to wait 10 minutes as our table wasn't ready, which is totally fine, no harm done. The manager or owner said I'm sorry your table isn't ready yet can I get you guys a drink while you wait.  I was impressed by this gesture, we gave him our drink selections but then he never returned with drinks.  I don't expect a drink while I wait, but if you are going to offer it you had better follow up.     \\n\\nWe are seated at our table and we sit and wait...and wait...and wait...and wait.  A half an hour passes before anyone comes over to us to greet us? bring us water? take our drink order ?  Nothing.  Finally our waitress comes over and we ask for a beer, a glass of wine, two waters and put our entire food order in after seeing how long it took for her to even approach us, he hoped we'd eat at some point that night. My husband wanted to get up and leave, but I was like no no lets give them a shot to make it right.  Another 15 minutes pass and we still have no drinks and no water (It was 9:15pm at this point and we have been there since 8:30).  Another waiter notices are glaring stares and empty table and asks if we've been helped.  He manages to track down our drinks and our round of appetizers quickly follows by the owner as I'm sure he was made aware of our less than stellar service so far.  Our dinner comes later, I ordered the bouillabaisse (which was great), but I wasn't given a bowl to disgard the shells.  Its the small details like this that a place serving this kind of meal at that kind of price would not forget.  And our waitress the whole time was so freaking timid and awkward, didnt ever greet us or check on us to ask how our food was, if we needed anything, if we wanted another drink (you know, standard things that waitresses do) and our drinks that we had waited 45 minutes for were both empty for a while.  I disgarded my shells on the table, which I would say is very rude of me, but I started to give zero f*cks to make a point.  \\n\\nEvery part of the service was so appalling and upsetting.  We work hard to be able to treat ourselves to nights out to dinner and when you're dropping over $100 on a nice meal out, it sucks to get treated like that and not even be apologized to for it when it was so obvious you gave us a horrible experience.  It's a shame because we really enjoyed the food and we are never ones to make a stink and are very laid back and usually excellent tippers, so you missed out on what could have been loyal, local customers, but I will never eat here again.

I don't see any reason for such a high rating.  I had the tenderloin with red wine sauce and my gf had the canard duck leg. First impressions tell me it's not right. I tasted first bite of steak, way too salty, not one bit of juice, too dry and seems to be frozen too long. I would expect to taste the beef but no, there was no beef flavour at all, just all salty and nothing else. The duck was dry and according to my gf, it was most likely deep fried although the salad under it was tasty with the sauce but it is not good value for the money. I thought the steak was a rip off, I don't like frozen dry steak and at 25 bucks I would expect some decent veggies with it but all I got was some green peas with a few chunks of carrot and a few bits of the trunk of what looks to be asparagus but it was hard to tell because there was no taste to them except more of the same salty flavour.  Serving green peas with tenderloin is the ultimate cheap filler so save your money and avoid this place unless you like paying high prices for mediocre food at best. I won't be back. The only reason I gave it two star was because the service was quite attentive."},{"name":"Clay Pit","address":"1601 Guadalupe St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"We love this place!

To make a long story short, the staff was incredibly rude. As one example, the waitress comes up and asks if she can get some drinks started for us. My father who is at the opposite end of the table from where the waitress was standing, speaks first and orders some cocktail. She looks at him.. ignores him and turns to me and asks what I want. I was shocked. I said that I would have what he's having. She gets mad and asks him what he wanted again. I'm not going to go into more detail about it (looks, mannerism, tone of voice etc. are hard to summarize) but it was beyond rude and embarrassing. They (including the ma√Ætre d'; bald guy with the beard) were complete jerks. I couldn't believe it. Half way through dinner it was like, should we leave?

Dinners were delivered to the table pretty fast - but they could've taken more time in the kitchen to get them right. The pasta for the linguine and clam sauce was not linguine - and had a very floury taste to it. The sauce was good - and there was a healthy helping of clams. In my pasta with Bolognese sauce - it needed a large amount of parmesan cheese to make it tasty (desperately needed salt).

Nice laid back shopping center location. Nice patio. Nice inside.  Service was fantastic although if you are an impatient person you might not care for wait time being a little longer than some people are accustomed to.  Servers were very polite and checked in on us frequently and brought just what we ordered.  The paella was fantastic and I had a mojito to drink with it and some nice wine.  Portions were more than enough to fill you up and everything was excellent quality.  Since it was my birthday I was offered a free tiramisu cake.  I wasn't expecting much because it was free and most places don't get it right.  This one was beyond fantastic.

I'm not the biggest seafood person, but Sea Level has something on the menu for everyone. The raw bar isn't for everyone, but what little I've had of it I've been impressed with. The sandwiches, burgers, and pizzas offer modern takes on American favorites, and there's plenty of really interesting takes like the adult grilled cheese and the calamari pizza that stand out as exciting and fresh. The nachos are a sleeper - though there was a special sauce that I don't think they serve with them anymore. Still tasty. The servers are friendly and I've always had good experiences with them, both upstairs and down. \\n\\nAs for the beer, Sea Level's craft beer selection ranks consistently among the best in town, with a really good variety of styles, and they seemingly always have Night Shift Whirlpool on if there's nothing else that catches my eye. They also keep plenty of local favorite Far from the Tree Cider on hand. I haven't dabbled too much with the cocktail list but what little I've sampled of others' choices has been solid.\\n\\nI will say, the upstairs in the summertime is completely unbeatable with the vibe and the views, which of course means everyone wants to eat up there. The downstairs in the warm seasons can be a good time too, though, and you still get a nice view of the water. The upstairs bar is where to be at night, though. Just a really cool spot with the fireplace couch area, plenty of TV's, a big bar as well as tables - and of course the water views at night.\\n\\nPrice-wise, I find Sea Level very reasonable compared to the options in town, what with the quality you get. It's not exactly cheap, but there are far pricier places in Salem, and value-wise, it's a strong offering.\\n\\nAll-in-all, Sea Level is easily the best restaurant on the Wharf (sorry Finz - you're a close second!) and, while maybe not the best culinary experience money can buy in Salem, it ranks as my *favorite* thanks to the combination of the views, the beer list, the vibe, and the value."},{"name":"Desta Ethiopian Kitchen","address":"3086 Briarcliff Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"This was our first time eating here and I must say, it will not be our last.

Our appetizers took forever to arrive at our table (they were not busy, we were one of 4 tables there) Our waiter forgot to put my husbands entree order in, so while the other three of us got our food, he got nothing.  His food finally arrived while the rest of us looked at empty plates which he refused to take away from the table until my husband was done eating.  That would not usually bother me but it was in my way, and you should never tell a customer \\"no\\" when they ask to have their plate cleared.   Then he brought us another tables desserts.  Also, he always tried to put the wrong food in front of the wrong person.  All in all it was just awful.  \\nThe Food: Eh, it was alright. My entree was the scallops..let me tell this straight, my entire entree, was 3 scallops in some sauce, nothing else.  I have been to several very nice Italian restaurants which do a 1st and 2nd pasta course, one usually a small protein, and the other a small or slightly larger pasta entree, this was not the  case of our dinner last night.  Lastly,  the desserts, oh please, don't even bother.  I got the cannoli as did one of our friends, and my husband and another friend for the nutella tart.  The shells of both desserts were store bought and so overly baked we had to use our hands to eat them, we tried to use our forks and my friend got nutella tart in her lap and I had cannoli on the table.  The cannoli filling was overly sweet, and just eh.  The nutella tart was actually just the store bought tart shell filled with some nutella slapped in it and some cut fruit on top.  \\n\\nSo basically, we paid too much for very little, meh quality food, and got to go home and eat some actual food so we would not to go to be hungry.\\n\\nThe only good thing about this dinner, was spending time with our friends.

I went on the first night and I went again a few days ago.  The first night was ridiculously packed with people.  As I didn't feel like waiting in any lines I didn't do much of anything but walk around. Then I saw my kryptonite  a tent full of Christmas ornaments.  I pushed my way through the crowds, picked out some lovely additions to my collection and left $30 poorer.  We then high tailed it out of there.  \\n\\nThe last time I went it was and hour before closing on a Thursday night ($2 cover). The crowds were gone and we were able to stroll around and actually see what the vendors were selling.  We drank mulled wine, ate cookies and even bought a few choice items from the vendors. The prices are a bit high, but I'm sure it's because organizers are charging a premium for them to be there. We also discovered the raclette stand.  If you  are willing to pay the hefty price tag you can also go on the magical cheese-tastic tour. They take a whole round of cheese, cut it in half and put it under a heater. The raclette melts, bubbles and browns to perfection.  They then scrape it onto the soft white bread and give you a couple gherkins and some thinly sliced meat.  Eating this was definitely the highlight of my evening.  Of course keep in mind sometimes it's quality over quantity as the portion is rather small for the price. \\n\\nNow I am hoping that the market coordinators will learn a lot from this year's experience.  I hope they read some of the Yelp reviews and make some changes like lowering the admission.  I also hope that they try again next year as I think this could be a great winter event in Vancouver.

(Full disclosure: I love German food). We arrived just before opening, at 11 AM on a Saturday and already there was a line in front of the place. No worries, as our party of 7 was easily accommodated.\\n\\nBecause it was Saturday, we had several options. First, the \\"Autobahn\\" buffet. If you love sausage, this is for you. Featuring multiple kinds of sausages from spicy to mild, at $15 the all you can eat buffet is a great bargain. It comes with salad and typical German sides such as red skinned mashed potatoes, potato salad (same potatoes but tart with vinegar and flavored with caraway), braised red cabbage, and more. Dessert is not included but provided at a discount, only costing $3.75 vs. the normal $5.25 plus. Most of my party ordered this and declared satisfaction.\\n\\nThe other option was the schweinhaxe, or roasted pork shank, normally served at dinner or all day Saturday and Sunday. One of my friends ordered this and offered to share with me. I'm glad she did. I love this classic German dish and it was the most tender and juicy that I have ever had. It had a good chew, with a delicate texture and a light smokiness that elevated it above the other versions I've had (including the one I made myself). Though virtually free of fat, there was plenty of juice. My only quibble would be that I wanted more crispy skin, but it was so good I only call it a quibble.\\n\\nI actually ordered the classic Wiener schnitzel. Two medium sized slices of breaded milk-fed veal made for a delicious, savory meal. A cup of mushroom gravy and sliced lemons accompanied the dish. I didn't need the gravy but I loved it when I tried it...using the dinner roll to mop up every last drop. The German potato salad and braised red cabbage were full of flavor, which sometimes is lacking. \\n\\nFinally, dessert. We ordered a variety: a couple of Schmidt's famous vanilla cream puffs, one peanut butter and chocolate puff, apple strudel, and - get this - the traditional German coconut cream pie. Kidding on the last one, but we did order a slice of coconut cream pie.\\n\\nI'm not a dessert eater; normally, I would have loved another schnitzel to end my meal! But the baseball-sized vanilla puff was so good I had seconds. The vanilla cream was cool as a cloud, the flavor sweet but not cloying. A term that came to mind was \\"clean.\\" The pastry itself was flaky, with clear signs of plenty of butter that split the insides into sheets. The peanut butter chocolate was also good. The light color of the peanut butter cream indicated real peanut butter was used. It was rich, and good.\\n\\nThe streudel was also good, though some of my companions wished it were a bit sweeter. I was perfectly fine with it. The apples were not overwhelmed by sugar and they tasted fresh, almost crisp. Definitely not from a can.\\n\\nI was very happy to have come to this classic Columbus institution, owned and operated by at least five or six generations of Schmidts. In fact, one of whom greeted us at the door as he opened up the place. The food was delicious. Perhaps the biggest endorsement came from my colleague who is a first generation German American, born, raised, and who lived in D√ºsseldorf. She is very picky about the food of her homeland and she proudly declared this an 8 out of 10. To be frank, she's so picky she'd probably give the best Michelin starred restaurant in Germany a 9.

But why is it the only place?  We had to take a couple buses to get to Disney Port Orleans Resort to get these Beignets.  The food court was small and not particularly well organized.  We stood in a short line to order them.  A sweet man who looked like he had been the benefit of an early release prison program then made the hot steamy pastries.  We then had to get in another main food court line to pay.  The gal taking our money was soooo big she did not want to get off her chair for a bag.  But it was raining outside -- as it often does in the afternoon in Orlando-- and who wants wet Beignets?  I tried them (6 huge fried squares of powered sugared dough for $8.50) and they were OK...not fantastic.  In fact I would say they were not as good as the ones in the California Downtown Disney Jazz Kitchen Express. Now you might say, a Beignet is a Beignet...but you'd be wrong.  At the Jazz Kitchen the dough is wetter and when they roll it out, they literally fluff the dough like a pillowcase on the countertop - breathing air into it.  They fry it for less time than this man did and as a result, theirs are lighter.  They also pile on the powdered sugar, but he did not.  They were still hot - fried in a big vat of oil - not a pressure cooker.  They were good and freshly made to order in front of you.  Was it worth the bus rides?  No, but we went to dinner at the resort and I loved the low key energy of the tranquil resort and its restaurants and very small, unassuming gift shops and I absolutely LOVE Beignets!"},{"name":"Blue Star Donuts","address":"1155 SW Morrison St, Ste 102","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Love the donuts but the customer service is non existent.

I love how they make the specialty of your burger, but you're able to add the additional toppings yourself. The soda machine is pretty cool as well. They have the touch screen coke machines with the wide variety of flavors. Haven't tried the desserts, but I'm looking forward to it."},{"name":"Chung's Asian Cuisine","address":"731 Granite St","city":"Braintree","stars":"3","text":"Pretty dead inside for a Saturday night, which we had heard would be the case (maybe they do more takeout?); after eating here I'm surprised it wasn't more crowded.  The cocktails weren't very balanced, so I couldn't imagine drinking more than one.  The food overall was excellent - piping hot and cooked exactly as it should be.  The General Gau's shrimp was probably the best plate we got.  I wouldn't normally order a shrimp plate as an entree, but I'd order this one.  Very solid Chinese food spot overall."},{"name":"L'Epicerie Rotisserie and Gourmet Shop","address":"565-1689 Johnston Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Always pleasant service and the lamb moussaka is the first thing I've bought at the market that I found completely satisfying - and I eat there relatively often! Always good, quality food at this little shop though."},{"name":"Myers & Chang","address":"1145 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"This restaurant so SO ACCOMMODATING! I was going to be eating there with a co-worker for lunch. I have nut, shellfish and gluten allergies. I noticed they had their menu online and even had separate menus for all three of those allergies. I emailed them to ask if they could accommodate for someone who has all three allergies. The manager, Jules emailed back within the hour saying she would create a menu especially for me! I was thrilled, but cautious because I didn't want to get my hopes up, as I have not had real Chinese food in about 5 or 6 years. I went there the next day, and the hostess found my menu, which HAD MY NAME ON IT! It had about 5-6 items on it, AND the ingredients that made up each dish. The server came over and was very attentive. He asked if anyone in my party had allergies he should be aware of, so I told him what they were. The food was delicious and it was cooked and served quickly, but you could tell it was fresh, and not sitting there all day. I can't remember the name of the dish, but it was baby broccoli with wide rice noodles, garlic and a fancy peppercorn/spice was in it too. It was great! The atmosphere is very cool and they have both outdoor and indoor seating and asked us which we preferred when we had walked in. I read up on the owners and they also own and manage Flour-the bakery just down the street which is also incredible and allergy aware too!\\n\\nI just can't say enough about how great this place is, and they are very accessible to reach if you have a question. The only downside is there is only on street parking, which is not their fault at all. I'll DEFINITELY be back!"},{"name":"Kelly's Roast Beef","address":"165 Endicott St","city":"Danvers","stars":"3","text":"Not the atmosphere I expected from Kelly's.

They've got a delicious tuna salad, though. I like the unconventional set up. But when I pay more than a few bucks for a burger, I'd like for it to be seasoned a little bit better - Lawry's? Adobo? Something."},{"name":"Myers & Chang","address":"1145 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Maybe it was what we ordered or maybe we just had high expectations, but my friend and I went here and were very sadly disappointed. \\n\\nFirst of all, the service was awful. We were seated and it took about 10 minutes for us to get menu and water. It would be one thing if it were actually crowded and busy, yet we went on a rainy Friday for lunch and there were approximately 4 other tables of people. The waitress was very slow and was not attentive at all. \\n\\nSecondly, the food was the worst Asian food I've ever had. It's not Chinese, it's not Malaysian, it's not Thai - what is it? I got a noodle dish and it had no flavor other than being kind of spicy and everything tasted like it was burnt. My friend got a rice dish and it was the same as mine in rice form. \\n\\nThirdly, they are definitely overpriced for what they are. I would have rather taken that money and gone to the Asian market across the street and bought my own noodles for 1/10th of the price. \\n\\nI do not recommend going here. Their only saving grace is their decor."},{"name":"Gourdough's Public House","address":"2700 S Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Gourdough's was a staple for me in my teen years.
