My friend who lives in the area mentioned that Dots is a good neighborhood place where you can get a decent burger for a relatively cheap price. Sounds like a pretty good deal, right?\\n\\nWell, what she forgot to mention was that the customer service is horrific. It didn't take too long to get seated, but once we got a table, it took about 15 minutes for our waiter to show up. Knowing that it would be forever and a day before he would show up again, we ordered everything at once: drinks, a starter and dinners. \\n\\nTime passed. And passed. And passed. My boyfriend occasionally stole glances at his watch, and my girl friend kept eyeing food that was passing us by, hoping that it was ours (but it never was). \\n\\nAs the outspoken one of the group, I decided to catch our waiter as he rushed by us at one point, just to ask how our food was coming along. Our waiter didn't stop at our table when I asked him the question. He just kept on walking, turned his head back towards me and made some type of grunting noise which I'm guessing was supposed to be an acknowledgment and an \\"it's coming\\" all wrapped into one.  \\n\\nAs anyone who has a modicum of customer service skills would know, you should at least stop at the customer's table and say, \\"I'm sorry for the wait. I'll go check on it\\" or \\"I'm sorry. We're in the weeds right now. It will only be a little bit longer.\\" \\n\\nTo the waiter's credit, 20 minutes or so after I inquired about our food, he did say something like \\"thanks for being so patient.\\"\\n\\nOur food (two cheeseburgers, one chicken sandwich and a plate of cheese fries) finally arrived after a 45 minute wait. Yes, I said 45 minutes. \\n\\nAs the waiter handed us our food, I asked if there was a manager I could speak to. He looked at me and said, \\"You want vinegar?\\" Obviously the place is not conducive to conversation. Anyway, after I repeated myself, he said, \\"There isn't a manager, but the owners are here.\\" Okay, bring me the owner.\\n\\nOne of the owners finally came by, and boy, I think she earns the crown for \\"biggest b**ch\\" of the year. I mentioned how long we had waited for our dinner, and she immediately went into this tirade about how there were \\"15 tickets for fries\\" in front of ours and that her \\"restaurant is not a fast food restaurant\\" and how all the other restaurants in the area would have similar waits. She concluded her little speech with a snotty \\"I don't think it's bad for a Friday night\\" and stomped off. \\n\\nWow. I was speechless. You're treating your customers, the ones who pay YOU, like that? She never apologized for the wait, nor did she show any concern for the fact that it took 45 minutes to cook three sandwiches and a plate of cheese fries.  \\n\\nIf her restaurant is understaffed, higher some freaking servers and cooks! Lord knows that there are people out there who need jobs.  \\n\\nI'll admit that the food was decent, but the atrocious customer service will prevent me from ever going there again."},{"name":"Barlata Tapas Bar","address":"1500 S Lamar Blvd, Ste 150","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"This blow Malaga out of the water and is by far the best tapas in Austin.

I was so excited for this tour, but as one of the other reviewers said, this tour was a waste of my money and of an hour and a half in my life. We met our guide by somehow finding \\"food tour\\" etched in pen on half a piece of scrap paper.  She was nice, yet kept saying generic terms like \\"college students like beer (duh!) and college students like to eat ice cream\\". Um yes, they do, but I was hoping for some specific information when I go on a tour- thats what people pay for. There were three stops she took us to on the tour, one to John Harvard's for a small sample of beer (about 1/3 of a glass), Fire and Ice for some chips and gross dipping sauce, and Berry Line for three sample cups (yes, SAMPLES- the same you would get if you just walked up off the street) of frozen yogurt. This was supposed to be a food tour, yet we didn't really go to any of the awesome restaurants in the area, nor did we really learn anything that had anything to do with Harvard Square or the restaurants, just again, generalizations about all students. I have gotten more to eat and better food samples on an afternoon trip to Costco. Sad. We ended up leaving the tour to go to get some lunch after the tour because we were so hungry from not being fed anything. Again, I was so excited to go on this tour but my husband and I left feeling as if we wasted our time on a tour that was unprofessional and haphazardly thrown together by the tour company.

Well-seasoned, and I haven't had a dry breast piece yet. As for sides, I've tried the mac & cheese, mashed potatoes, collard greens, and the broccoli cheese casserole. All are good, and if I had to choose favorites, they'd probably be the mac & cheese and mashed potatoes. But I always try to have something green on my plate, so I never get the two together. The fried chicken special also comes with your choice of dinner roll or cornbread. I don't really care for the cornbread --  I found it to be dry, crumbly, and salty. The dinner roll is nothing special taste wise, but comes to you warm and super soft and fluffy. \\n\\nI like the service here, also. We come on the early side, so there is plenty of seating, and a server has always greeted us and instructed us to have a seat wherever we'd like.

There are a few spaces on the street (I think it's Bluff) and 2 small lots that have few spaces. Those compete with several other businesses. Sidewalk was cleared off today, but the street to get to it was icy and dangerous. Good thing I had hiking shoes on.\\n\\nNot many food options here. They don't really have a kitchen in this location. It's a small coffee shop with pre-made items likely brought over from another location (guess from the one on Iris).\\nPatio on the east side is often less windy and dogs are welcome.\\n\\nService with a smile!"},{"name":"Teriyaki House","address":"868 Broadway","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"The voting for this restaurant is ABSOLUTELY rigged by their family and friends.

Note that they're usually slower than Starbucks but that's because they have to do more than press a button to get coffee out of the machine (and that's a good thing).\\n\\nThis has been my favorite coffee shop for many years now.\\n\\n== PROS ==\\n\\n- Espresso and drip: much better than Starbucks, which focuses on consistency.  I sometimes get a cappuccino here that is as good as any drink in Austin.\\n\\n- Service: Consistently positive.\\n\\n- Plugins: There are at least 15 places to sit down and plug in your laptop, and even more outside.  Meanwhile, the Starbucks nearby not only shuts down their much larger store but cut down on plugs and laptop-friendly tables.\\n\\n- Internet: fast and reliable.  There's only one other shop in town that's as fast as them.  You want to get work done but got some big files to upload/download?  Come here.\\n\\n- Food items: overall good.  Taco Deli (in the mornings).  Yogurt, sandwiches, bagels -- most everything has been good.\\n\\n\\n\\n== CONS ==\\n\\n(These more have to do with Coffee Bean as a whole and not really this location.)\\n\\n- Music - not an indie joint so they play licensed music on a loop.  It gets real old.\\n\\n- TV - there used to be just one but that got \\"upgraded\\" and it's really distracting.\\n\\n- Flavor stuff - I generally avoid the various different flavored drinks (vanilla, chocolate, hazelnut, etc.) due to their use of \\"corn syrup solids\\".\\n\\n- Recycling.  Although they work with local gardens to compost, cups/lids go to a landfill.\\n\\n\\n== Recommendations ==\\n\\n* Bring your own cup (save a few cents).\\n* Buy a $30 gift card and get a free drink.  Then just use the gift card until it runs out.  Repeat.\\n\\nDrinks:\\n\\n* Blended dark chocolate mocha (similar to Starbucks Frappuccino and way better)\\n* Cappuccinos\\n* Teas: Go for the cold herbal tea or hot medicine ball (not on menu)\\n\\nNote that they got rid of all the nice extras to add to your coffee like sea salt and cayenne pepper."},{"name":"Velvet Taco Domain","address":"11501 Rock Rose Ave, Ste 160","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Finally had the chance to visit the restuarant intsead of just ordering through a delivery service last weekend.

He had to ask us questions (simple ones, like if we need sauce or a box or our checks) several times before he knew what we needed. He was horrendously inattentive.

If they want an Izakaya style and higher quality meal, they can go to Shoya. \\n\\nThe menu looks like smaller version of Shoyas.

They still had sushi, rice dishes, and other Japanese food items as well. \\n\\nYou have 2 broth options for their ramen: pork and chicken.

Most Atlanta ramen places seem about the same. While Yebisuya doesn't have the best ramen I've tasted, it was good enough for me. \\n\\nI got their Powerful Tonkotsu Ramen. Why did they call it \\"powerful\\"? They have more pork slices (Chashu). So it's more protein; therefore, it makes you more powerful! I think the bowl is bigger too with a bigger portion of noodles and toppings.\\n\\nEverything in the ramen looked like it was done right. The pork broth tasted decent, but it was bit too salty for me. It had a good amount of fat as well. \\n\\nTheir noodles were thin and cooked right. The Chashu tasted fine, the egg was actually soft boiled. The menma was a bit tough. But everything in the ramen seemed decent. So it came out to a good ramen but not great. \\n\\nAlso, since there were so much crap in the Powerful Tonkotsu, it was too much. It felt overwhelming. Maybe getting the regular ramen would've been better for me. \\n\\nI also tried a little bit of their Tan Tan. I liked the heat from the broth. The noodles were different, it was thicker. I'm not sure where that tradition came from, using thicker noodles for spicier broths. But I know Korean ramens do that. But it was a nice touch. I might try a whole bowl next time I go.\\n\\nTheir takoyaki was your typical takoyaki. They didn't put any bonito on it though. :(\\n\\nOverall, the ramen was fine. They do have some competition with Jinya and Hajime in the vicinity. But if you're close to Doraville and craving ramen, Yebisuya should be good enough."},{"name":"The Matador","address":"1438 NW 23rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"One of my fav places too come and eat TEXAS MEX style and MARGARITAS delicious.

Not the greatest first impression but reviews are good & it's only a 4 mile drive so we roll the dice & head for Kanji.  Plenty of parking.  This shopping center sandwiched between 183 & Jollyville Rd just East of where they converge is a nice, two story mod red brick box that's probably seen better days.  Lots of small businesses with vinyl banners for signs.  BB Rovers is the anchor business in here.  It's good sign a place like Kanji is here.  Earth needs more ramen.  I need a place like Michi Ramen closer to my end of town.  Space is nice.  Mural is cool. Staff on the ball & nice.  Only been open about 3 weeks.  Sign on the door indicates they are trying to hire more people. About 10 four top tables of which 3 were in use at 6pm on a Friday.  Word obviously hasn't gotten out yet there's a hip new ramen shop in NW Austin.  Ordered in person & ramen came out much faster than anticipated.  Packed securely.  Got it home & immediately dug in.  Noodles were perfect.  Pork bone broth rich but a little lighter than the local ramen shop competition.  All the ingredients a standard bowl of classic ramen needed were present.  Ingredients were fresh and in the right proportions.  I'm giving a solid 3 star a-ok review based on my wishing it was a lot spicier and less pricier.  $26 after tax & before a tip is a lot for 2 bowls of ramen 2 go with no sides."},{"name":"Five Horses Tavern","address":"535 Columbus Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Not awful but not great.

There was trash on the floor in my room upon my arrival, so it's clear that at the very least, they do not vacuum between guests.

It's anybody's guess.\\nThere's a daily $25 + tax \\"resort fee.\\" Note that this is not by any stretch of the imagination a resort. It's a run-of-the-mill convention hotel located miles from any area attractions. The resort fee is mandatory, and includes the following: Fitness Center (standard hotel amenity even at budget hotels), 15% discount off spa treatments and merch (no value if, like almost all conference guests, the spa has no appeal to you), two trolley tickets (?), local and 800 calls (for which the hotel pays nothing anyway), two bottled waters per day (the tap water is potable, so you're basically paying for them to help you trash the planet), and kids under 12 eat free (at the bar or Fiorenzo, during certain hours, on certain days, subject to change. And who brings kids on work trips?).\\n\\nSo the long story short is that the rooms are not clean and you need to add $30/day to whatever price they quote you online.

Mine was a blueberry mojito, that had about 5 old shriveled blueberries in it. (If you don't have fresh ingredients, just say so and offer something else!). Dinner was ok. I had a lobster BLT, Bacon was hard and almost black. Waiter (owner?) gave me chips instead of the fries I ordered. Our friend ordered some sort of Greek pork kabab, pork was overcooked and stuck on the skewer and he had try to wrestle it off without sending it flying across the table.  Waiter never came back to ask how our food was. Sat there with empty glasses, would have liked to get a second drink (something else) and more water, and more ketchup for the fries.  Unimpressed.

Overall I love Chipotle and the fact that is a popular franchise is honestly what's saving this place from closure. The employees are often talking while serving your bowl or seem to be entertained doing anything but helping you. On one occasion I've ordered online and when I got there it was not there. I immediately informed the cashier and he said they probably hadn't received the order and walked away. I had ordered hours before. Overall took 15 minutes of standing there and being persistent to get my food. Second time one of the girls was way to into her conversation and gave me Carne Asada instead of Steak. This was when it just came out so I was very confused. She tried to play it off as if I meant to order Carne Asada and the girl next to her just asked \\"if I wanted to eat this for today?\\". As if I wouldn't be paying for it. The girl angrily started remaking my bowl before walking away in anger. I honestly feel like im disturbing a group of teenagers hanging out every time I walk in. Talking amongst friends is fine and most of them are young, but also acknowledge the person standing in front of you.

Customer Service is horrible. Heres the story of my friend: The bill came $11. Gave my card. It declined (yes, there are funds available ). She said her manager asked for a different form of payment. Since i just finished working out, that was the only card with me. After a second try, I told the waitress I had $8 in my car (maybe 5 feet in front of us). Went to the car, gave her the $8 and said I'd have to come back to give the remaining $3. She told me to wait while she talked to her manager again. She came back and said they can't let me leave. I'd have to call someone or leave collateral. For a few seconds i felt a sense of panic. \\"We can't let you leave\\" she said. For those of you who know me please don't laugh: my phone was dead so I could not immediately call Napoleon. I asked to speak to the manager (who never came to where I was outside to talk with me). The waitress and I walked in. The manager was sitting at the bar with her boyfriend. I told her I didn't have $3 on me, but I live close by and could bring it right back. I recognized her from the Pearl Alley location. She said I'd have to call someone. I told her I didn't have a working phone with me and reiterated that it's $3. If need be I could ask a customer, but I preferred to come back. She looked at my driver's license and asked me to leave that with her. I said I needed it to drive in case I got stopped. Meanwhile, The waitress kept asking her manager if she was going to have to pay for my meal. I reiterated \\"it's $3. I'll come right back. I promise.\\" They asked to leave the wedding ring! This place is a joke. bad service. I went to a couple of eating establishments yesterday I was so bothered by the situation at ElArepazo that I gave a synopsis of the situation and asked what they would do: At McCormic and Schmick's the waiter said when a customer has a mishap regarding their bill, he sends them on their way with a sincere \\"have a nice day\\". His reason for such an act \\"I know that something good will happen for me later\\". At BJ's the waitress told us of a time recently when a customer forgot her wallet. She told the lady not to worry about it. The lady came back the next day, paid the bill and left a tip that was larger than the bill.\\nIn reflection, the owners of ElArepazo had an opportunity after the fact to win big. Research shows that customers are more loyal to a business/brand after having had a service failure and it being rectified to the customer's delight than if they had never had a service failure in the first place."},{"name":"Volcano Sushi & Grill","address":"1991 E Hastings Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Came across Volcano Sushi & Grill last night after looking for some late night eats.

It's great bread - when you inevitably have to ask for your meal to be wrapped (huge portions!) I always ask the waitress to stick a few more complimentary breads in there.  I can't get enough of them.\\n\\nMy favorite dish to order is the authentic Peking Duck -  when you eat it, you'll think you're in Peking during the times of Confucius.  You aren't given the standard tortilla-type rolls with the duck, but instead this more manly fatter bun, which I prefer.\\n\\nIf I bring a date here, I ALWAYS get the Scorpion bowl to share.  It's like my lucky charm of getting lucky.  One negative thing about CP (as the regulars call it) is they don't always put enough alcohol in the drinks.

We enjoyed a beer and before long got our text to head on over. \\n\\nTo eat we shared the chips and salsa, ceviche, suedero tacos and goat rib barbacoa between three people. The chips and salsa was spicy and totally unique with thick chips piled with toppings and tons of flavor, off to a great start. The ceviche was also super flavorful and fresh but honestly hard to eat with other people as it wasn't served with chips or anything we all just went for it with forks off the same plate. The suedero tacos are a brisket and came recommended by our server. They come four to a plate and were phenomenal! The goat was served with several salsas and toppings with amazing homemade tortillas to make your own tacos. This made it easy to share and amp up the flavor with the toppings. So so good! \\n\\nThe only let down was my drink. I opted for the punch on tap and didn't love it.  That same millennial moth was drawn in by cocktails on tap and got burned this time.

I was lured into the restaurant because of the \\"Happy Hour\\" sign they had on the sidewalk so I thought that I would give it a try. I've been here in the past for \\"Top Shelf Tuesdays\\" and had some really good drinks, so this time I thought I would try the food. The prices for happy hour food really aren't bad, as they range from $5-$8, so I opted for the carnitas nachos ($5) and 3 pork belly street tacos (3 for $5). \\n\\nHere's where it goes wrong, though. The nachos plate was HUGE, but the chips were covered in grease and oil and unfortunately all the crispiness was negated because of this. Slight gripe with this was that the nachos were served vegetarian and if you want to add on meat, it's an extra $5! Just to put meat on the nachos meant that it was the price of the whole dish in itself. Not the worst thing, but I wish the waiter had made that clear before I had opted for meat. \\n\\nThe nachos were edible at least, so I was excited to try the tacos. Because, who doesn't love pork belly?? But the tacos... were a mess. The meat was incredibly dry and tasted like it had been marinated in grape jelly? The tortillas were dry and hard, and no amount of salsa on the top could save them. What made matters worse was that my waiter hardly paid any attention to my table. Ironically, waiters that were serving other tables gave me better service than mine. After I finished eating, I had to wait 15 minutes until a check was brought to me... by another server!

Fried rice with veggies and sausage taste oily and underseasoned, it taste only ok if you get the sausage bits with the fried rice.  Deep fried group in sweet and sour sauce was a bit of disappointment.  The sauce taste artificial and westernized while the deep fried fish itself, despite being crispy and crunchy, can again use some seasoning.  I guess the sauce supposed to balance the fish blandness but unfortunately, since the sauce not doing its job, the overall flavor of the fish fell short.

I have been looking forward to getting the strawberry lemon pepper wings again since my last visit with some friends recently (the wings were fresh and delicious then). So last night after being out I came, of course, to order my wings and first of all, I waited AN HOUR and 15 minutes, the menu markets 20 minutes; to be realistic I wouldn't have been upset if it was at least like 35 minutes, to give that extra fluff time. The wait time was absolutely unacceptable. THEN, to make matters even worse, after waiting for that long, the wings were COLD when they came out. Now, the lovely bartender (African American young lady with short burgundy locs), as sweet as she was, I have good reason to believe that she clearly forgot about running the food or the kitchen was just that annoyingly slow, or BOTH! I think both! Smh\\n\\nSo the wings come out cold, I not only had to wait to get her attention for about 10 minutes to let her know that they were really cold, she comes over finally, I let her know & she immediately goes \\"well what do you want to do??? Like...\\" So I politely say to her I want some new wings that are fresh please. Y'all had me wait this long for cold food, not fair. She goes to the back and of course does the restaurant thing where all they do is throw the same wings in the oil (in this case the microwave because they're baked wings) and bring them out again. Now I'm annoyed because not only did they reheat these wings they're now soggy and they didn't even bother to reapply the strawberry and lemon pepper on top that now doesn't even appear to be on. I was so mad because I was so hungry, tired and waited so long that I ended up losing my appetite. \\n\\n I just asked for a togo box and my check! that alone took an additional 15 minutes. When she finally brought my check I gave her my card immediately because I didn't want to have to wait again. She finally brings my card and my receipts but no pen! So she asked me to hold on so she can find one that took an additional 20 minutes! I was so ready to go at this point, a gentleman who was sitting beside me at the bar had to ask her what was the hold up. She blamed it on a server stealing her pen. She finally brought me one, I signed and got the hell on. So incredibly disappointed with my service and the food last night after having such high expectations the service was horrendous & wait times were completely ridiculous. I've been in the service industry before for years and there's nothing worse than asking for something to be fresh and then, instead, you get recycled food. BS! Do better Guys!

I'm really tired of going to Starbucks and hoping a table opens up where I can plug in.\\n- Generally good customer service\\n- More little extras to add to your coffee (including sea salt for dark chocolate items)\\n- Food items: outstanding steel-cut oats and Taco Deli (in the mornings) for sale at pretty good prices.  Yogurt option was good too.\\n\\nNegative differences:\\n- Internet connection is spotty.  Shuts off internet every 2 hours for 10 minutes.  I can see why this was implemented and I would have no issue if you could postpone it for another 10-15 minutes if you were in the middle of something.\\n- Music somewhat more annoying."},{"name":"White's Bakery","address":"100 Derby St","city":"Hingham","stars":"3.5","text":"I have had Tiramisu at Whites in the past .

There was a good number of people inside, but the line wasn't too bad, and was moving at a good pace.\\n\\nTo say the person running the line was efficient would be an understatement. All pleasantries were disregarded for the sake of speed. \\"Wheat or white\\", \\"black beans or pinto\\", \\"brown rice or white\\". While I realize how busy it was, this level of machine-like efficiency was borderline rude. \\n\\nI had some tacos with steak and some of their much-advertised queso. The steak was surprisingly good, it was fairly tender, and the marinade they use is pleasant. However, protein does not a taco make, and the other ingredients caused it to fall flat on its face (or is it torilla?)\\n\\nIt seems that the other fillings... beans, rice, lettuce, etc. were not spoiled or wilted, but not at their freshest. Therefore, while the steak fortunately did have an opportunity to shine through a bit, everything else was lost in the commotion. \\n\\nPart of the commotion was that quite a lot of liquid made its way into the tacos, which hid some of the fresher, crispier elements like lettuce. Similarly, all this liquid diluted some of the queso. I tried to give it a taste where it was still pure... but it was notably, and disappointingly unremarkable. \\n\\nAlso, As others were saying, there were a little more careful as to how much ingredient they were placing. One the one hand, the tacos didn't fall apart. On the opposite, though, being efficient to a fault with service, and being overly frugal with ingredients seems is contradictory. At almost $10 for three tacos, I'd hope they wouldn't be counting pieces of steak and grains of rice (exaggerated, but you get the idea)\\n\\nIn summary: while Steak was very presentable, but other ingredients being unremarkable to subpar. Service was curt in dealing with people, and excessively frugal with food. While Chipotle has great potential, these factors took a bite out of a good experience."},{"name":"Kneaded Pleasures Cafe & Pizza","address":"3573 Far W Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"This place just felt odd.

Let's be real. You're at Dots. So wait it out. Be cool. You're probably hung over, anyway, and could use some time to try to remember last night. Grab a cup of coffee across the street at Dr. Broder's Waiting Room and then meander back to your table. It's all good.\\n\\nOnce you've had some time to reflect on your life, your waitperson will show up, looking like he/she flew a little close to the sun last night, because, damn, they fly.

They stop serving alcohol at 11:30 it is 11:27 and they won't take my order. They said they were closed, shorty after they said that the last call for alcohol over the intercom played.

The server we ended up with (more on this later) was wonderful, very friendly and personable with good knowledge of the menu and good opinions. The food was very good from our starters of a tomato salad and greens salad to the Alaskan Halibut with Carrot-Ginger Risotto, Blue Crab, Bok Choy, Miso-Soy Glaze, Petit Shiso and Berkshire Pork Tenderloin with Goat Cheese Risotto, Baby Carrots, Favas, Heirloom Apples, Pomegranate Jus to the house made donuts and berry cobbler. While I continue to maintain that Disney chefs seem to have trouble cooking beef, pork and lamb to temperature and have lost their salt and pepper shakers, the pork was only slightly overcooked and the flavors were all on point (no pun intended). The wine list is extensive enough that we were able to find a half bottle that matched both of our entrees without breaking the bank.\\n\\nThe cons started with our first table. We had an early reservation and the dining room was virtually empty, yet they at first attempted to seat us at a table with no view before putting us in a table that was wedged between the window and a large column which felt very confining next to a large table that was loud with lots of kids. Our server was odd and seemed more concerned with the large table next to us, so all those factors combined led me to asking to be reseated which was a good call as we ended up at a better table with a better server.\\n\\nIt was a pleasant experience until about halfway through but that disappeared as the dining room filled up. Artist Point is supposed to be a \\"signature restaurants\\" with high prices to match. Dinner for two cost us $150 and if we were on the Disney Dining Plan it would have counted as two credits, but Disney is too permissive in enforcing their dress code or expecting customers to behave themselves. A family was seated next to us with a 4-5 year old child who ended up standing on the tabletop and when she wasn't doing that, she was crawling on the floor tripping up servers. Their baby kept throwing stuff on the floor and the mother did nothing to keep things out of their reach. A young adult was seated wearing day glow orange camouflage t-shirt and shorts and there was an adult couple with no kids wearing baseball caps at the table. All of these are supposedly against the post dress code, but damned if Disney would enforce it. I get that people are \\"on vacation\\" but so am I and some of us enjoy a nice quiet meal as part of that experience. If you want loud or casual, there are plenty of other options and if Disney is going to charge premium prices, the atmosphere and expectation of its guests should match.\\n\\nIt really is too bad as Artist Point should be nice and classy, but its clientele and inconsistent staff doesn't match its potential."},{"name":"Presso Coffee Bar","address":"2020 N Mcclellan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I really enjoyed my experience here.

I used to live in Boston and liked this place. Here's why;\\n\\n1. This is a young professional bar/restaurant, meaning Dillon's is a place you come after work/school to grabba bite/drink(s). It's not ideal to come here on a Friday/weekend nights because it gets really crowded. The place is pretty small, so the atmosphere gets cramped and gets annoying really fast. \\n2. Food is decent bar food here. Drinks are not bad either. Food and drinks go well with. Price is reasonable. \\n3. It's in a very prime time location; right near the T-stop, cab pick up areas, Boylston/Copley area.\\n4. It's a place that you can dress either casual or dressy. Although, I must say this is Boston, young professionals in this area are relatively well-dressed individuals whether they go casual/not :)\\n5. Flashback; I used to meet up w/ friend after work hours during the day, I'd either walked or took a couple T-stops to get here. I ordered my burger/appetizer and whatever drink I was in mood for. Bartenders here are prompt and attentative. We'd spend maybe couple hours chatting and catching up about our day while looking out the their window, have our burger/drink and went our ways. I always remembered it as an easy neighborhood bar/restaurant for young professionals. \\n6.However, I do need to note that the experience is not the same when you come on Friday/late weekend nights. \\n7. Overall, keep this in mind; this is a local bar restaurant for young professionals to hang out after work right in heart of Boston. If you're looking for something romantic or fine dining, go somewhere else.

It was my first time. Upon walking in, I heard \\"24K Magic\\" by Bruno Mars; I see little kids dancing, everybody in the room looks happy, and I'm ecstatic. The hostess tells us that it's a 45-minute wait, but, my sister-in-law is adamant about eating here (she's 7.5 months pregnant), so, we take a seat and wait. In less than 20 mins, they call for us to be seated. It takes us about 25 minutes to order drinks (and you best believe that we already had our meal orders ready). It takes another 15-20 just to receive the drinks. I ordered the triple berry smoothie...and it came back like a slushy. The juice was sitting at the top of the cup and at first sip, all I tasted was juice. I asked our waiter to take the smoothie back and just bring a water. We ordered a kids chicken finger meal, the 6oz sirloin (with a side of macaroni and cheese and broccoli), and quesadillas. It took us over an hour to receive: the kids chicken finger meal, the 6oz sirloin, mashed potatoes..............and broccoli. The sirloin was so crispy and dry. I cut it down the middle just to see if it was medium-well. My boyfriend sat looking like a sad puppy, drinking his water, until we asked the waiter to bring us to go plates. It was 11:39pm, we had our 2-year old, and my boyfriend still hadn't eaten. We asked for the manager. The manager comes up FULL of energy...unfortunately, what he didn't know was that we both work in customer service and we know all the handles to try to make a bad situation better. He gives us this explanation that it's a Friday night, and there's only 3 cooks on the grill. But look at this sirloin...and my boyfriend STILL didn't receive his quesadillas. So he tells us he understands and it's not acceptable, but it's a Friday night. We're not accepting the type of service we were provided. I mean, my sister in law is 7.5 months pregnant and she never even got a refill on the water she was drinking. He keeps jokingly saying, \\"I gotta get something out of this, too.\\" But at this point, how can you...and we weren't even trying to receive a free meal, we just expected to pay for what we received. Reluctantly and in a haste, the manager takes the check (seeming flustered with how he could try to explain WHY it took so long and WHY we didn't receive everything in an adequate amount of time. Even goes as far as to mention that the District Manager is present and he wasn't happy with the services they were providing either) and cuts it....by 5 dollars...with the notation \\"Too Long\\" on the receipt.......and I'm disgusted. Completely dissatisfied. My sister-in-law said they've never took this long to deliver food nor has the quality of the food been this low. And my boyfriend NEVER received his quesadillas. The manager didn't even come back to the table to smooth out the errors. He sent the waiter to our table with the checks. We could understand if it was a packed full house, but for it to be a Friday, we could see tableS empty. Needless to say, we left paying our waiter cash.

Very polite and professional.\\n\\nThe shrimp appetizer with garlic was quite good. The spinach salad was very good -- perfect amount of vinaigrette and bacon :). The wedge salad was okay, but in fairness I asked for the blue cheese dressing (came with thousand island) and on the side. The rolls were brought right from the oven -- hot, hot, hot and delicious.  The beef stroganoff was excellent. The \\npappardelle pasta was cooked perfectly. The dish is quite large and  even though my wife and I shared it we brought leftovers home. \\n\\nThe bad: \\n\\nThe layout of the restaurant is a tad awkward. As soon as you enter, there is a bar in front,  the hostess station, on one side, and the outdoor part of the restaurant (with heated lamps and covered roof -- so is open during winter months). This creates a major logjam with servers having to barely miss customers while they are bringing trays of food and drinks in and out of the \\"outdoor\\" part of the restaurant. \\n\\nThe ugly: \\n\\nWe had made a reservation for 7:45P. We arrived right on time (actually a few mins before time), and yet our table wasn't ready till 8:05P or later. Moreover, there was an open table, so it wasn't that guests had overstayed their expectations. They just didn't have it ready for some reason.

I didn't want them to clear the plate as I wanted to try to finish each bit of that sauce with the rest of my meal.\\nGG and I shared the duck and the ribeye and neither of us could believe the flavors presented in either plate but the duck really blew both our minds.

I hope they will purchase some high chairs in the future given that they are located in an area with lots of young families.  The food was not bad, but not the best in Richmond. They were expensive though, we ordered three items and our bill was $43. We ordered spring rolls, pho and banh mi chao. The spring roll was crispy and with rich fillings, definitely one of the best spring rolls in town. The pho was alright, $14 for the bowl and the soup was light with not enough flavor and the beef was a bit rough. I would go to other places for better pho. We also ordered banh mi chao, it's like a DIY banh mi with pate as spread. The flavor was great, but expensive for a sandwich at $19.

Leave that for the summer time. Not late fall or winter. The waitress we had was working all by herself. We did not catch her name. She did a great job keeping up with us and taking care of us. The food was pretty good. A few of us asked to have separate checks, and she said no problem. However at the end when we were ready to leave and check out, another waitress by the name of Scout came out and told us their policy is we cannot give a large number of people in your party all separate checks. She was supposed to be helping out the other waitress who was doing all the work running around. We never saw Scout at all until she came out and told us that when we were leaving. You DO NOT tell me what your policy is. We are customers, not employees. She was very demanding and actually sort of rude. I went in and demanded my separate check for my wife and I and got it.

Imagine my immense disappointment when I've paid market price for a tableside preparation but no parmesan wheel appears. I'm not sure what was market price, but $45 seems a bit steep even for freshly shaved truffles. I could have done without and paid half the price to be happy with what I was served. The meatball was tender and a good mix of beef, veal, and pork but it was underseasoned. \\n\\nThe shining star of the night was the service.

This Korean/Japanese restaurant is located in a busy mini mall in Coquitlam (close to Hanamori Sushi).\\n\\nThe interior is spacious and fairly bright and the waitress will greet you in Korean while K-Pop is playing in the background.\\n\\nI wound up ordering the Aburi Salmon Oshi Sushi ($9.95) and a couple of pieces of nigiri sushi: Aburi Salmon Belly ($3 each), Aburi Tuna Belly ($3 each).\\n\\nI actually quite enjoyed their version of aburi salmon oshi (seems like everyone is making this dish these days). The single layer of salmon belly on top was buttery and tender and each piece was creamy with just a hint of spiciness from the slice of jalape√±o and the use of ground pepper. I like that they didn't use too much rice and that it didn't fall apart when you picked it up.\\n\\nFor my aburi nigiri, I thought the salmon belly was the best of the bunch as the salmon belly shared the same buttery and creamy texture that was in their oshi sushi. The tuna was okay but didn't compare with the salmon belly.\\n\\nI came back the following week to try some of their sashimi dishes and see how they compare. Their Assorted Sashimi ($22.95 for an advertised 15 pieces) seemed the best deal as I wanted to try more than just tuna and salmon. I wish they had a smaller version of this at a lower price point. As it turns out, my sashimi plate came with 7 pieces of amaebi (small sweet shrimp), 5 pieces of hokkigai (surf clam), 3 pieces of tako (octopus), 3 pieces of tuna, 3 pieces of farmed salmon, and 3 pieces of tai (sea bream or red snapper)... so it wound up being a fairly good value.\\n\\nThe best of the bunch was the thick-cut salmon which was both fresh and tender. The thinner-cut, translucent slices of tai had a very mild flavour, as to be expected. I thought the tako was well prepared as it wasn't overly chewy (I've had tako at some restaurants where it's oddly squishy). While the thick-cut tuna slices were served at a relatively ok temperature, the tuna was more firm than it was buttery (oh how I miss the sashimi from Japan).\\n\\nOn my subsequent visit, I stuck with some more nigiri sushi... specifically, the Aburi Salmon Belly Nigiri ($3.20 each), Aburi Saba Nigiri ($2.75 each), and the Aburi Spicy Unagi Oshi ($13.95). As in my previous visit, the aburi salmon belly was creamy and melt-in-your-mouth tender with a hint of dusted ground pepper.\\n\\nThe spicy unagi had a nice kick from the sauce. The only bad thing that I can say about this oshi sushi is that they didn't make all of the pieces the same size - which is a bit distracting when eating oshi sushi (which is known for being perfectly formed into rectangular shapes).\\n\\nI made an effort to come back and try some of their Korean dishes but when we arrived on a weekend, the only menu they had available was their Japanese menu. I'm not sure if this was just an oversight or if they don't always offer their Korean menu. In any case, we wound up ordering from their regular Japanese menu and got the Appetizer Sashimi ($7.95), Gomae ($4.95), Spicy Agedashi Tofu ($5.25), Half and Half Teriyaki ($13.95), and Assorted Tempura ($14.95).\\n\\nThe sashimi came with fairly thick-cut pieces of salmon and tuna that I thought was pretty good. Meanwhile, the gomae was a fairly standard offering of boiled spinach with sesame sauce.\\n\\nThe spicy agedashi tofu was encased in a fairly thick-crusted fried skin and drizzled with hot sauce.\\n\\nWhile not the best teriyaki that I've had, I did appreciate the ability to order a plate of half beef and half chicken teriyaki (sometimes I don't want to eat a whole plate of one or the other). This is good for those that like variety.\\n\\nThe assorted tempura is a large serving of 3 pieces of prawns and 7 pieces of veggies (yam, sweet potato, and squash). The tempura batter that they use here has a fairly crunchy bite to it.\\n\\nOne of these days, I've got to come back and try some of their other dishes. My only complaint is their tiny (and constantly busy) parking lot. Service here is also a bit hit-and-miss.\\n\\nNote: I've heard that this place is closed now...."},{"name":"Chipotle Mexican Grill","address":"227 Alewife Brook Pkwy, Spc B5","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3","text":"No wonder Chipotle is going down the tubes.

It's about as mom and pop as you can get with a great family running the business and cooking the food, after one visit, you'll feel like family.\\n\\nChef and Owner Terence Phillips and his wife of 24 years Patrice Phillips hold down the fort at Something Fishy. Terence fulfilled his lifelong dream of opening Something Fishy, which is as he says \\"A reflection of the Phillips family gatherings and celebrations\\"\\n\\nThe 1500 square foot restaurant is a fast-casual concept where you order your food, take a seat, and it is brought out to you, or you can order your food to go as well. Inside there are tables and chairs with influences of South Hampton, Long Island for the decor. It's not a huge space, but it works for them for right now. On Saturdays, seating may be limited, as lines can be going out the door, so it's first come first serve here.\\n\\nSomething Fishy specializes in seafood that's grilled, pan-seared or fried, served in a variety of selections from delicious fish tacos to crab cakes. The evolving menu, crafted by Chef Terence features starters, salads, build your own fishy bowls and classic seafood entrees with a fusion of new age, fresh flavors and innovation served straight from \\"Chef T's\\" kitchen. \\n\\nWe started our evening off with a selection of fried deliciousness that featured a sampling of fried cauliflower, calamari rings and tentacles and sweet corn hushpuppies. The fried cauliflower is a newer addition to the menu.\\n\\nThe Lump Crab Cake was really good with no fillers and a drizzle of cilantro aioli mayo with a side of Wasabi Slaw. We did a have a sample size portion, so the full order is a bit larger than pictured, but It's a really good crab cake you can get as meal all by itself.\\n\\nThese Salmon Tacos with black bean and corn salsa and Wasabi slaw were pretty tasty also. I'm not the biggest fan of salmon, unless its raw for sushi or sashimi purposes, but these had a good flavor. You can get your tacos with any fish they offer at Something Fishy also. \\n\\nThis was a very interesting Fish Sandwich made with Swai..an Asian catfish that is very tasty with a mild flavor. Chef T told me they use Swai for the consistency of the flavor and texture, and after tasting it, I can see why. The batter was perfect also.\\n\\nThese Jumbo Blackened Shrimp have a great flavor and are pretty damn jumbo!\\n\\nI was really impressed with the Unicorn Fish...It was my first time ever having Unicorn Fish...and yes it's a real thing, and yes it was very good, especially blackened. \\n\\nOne of the newer concepts to Something Fishy is called \\"Something Sweet\\" an in house bakery program, that is still being tweaked, but on our visit we had this lovely and delicious Lemon Cake that was a slice of heaven and a great way to end our visit."},{"name":"Chipotle Mexican Grill","address":"12648 S Orange Blossom Trl","city":"Orlando","stars":"2.5","text":"I just stopped at this chipotle to get a bag of chips for a snack.

I had the buffalo chicken mac and cheese. Two others at the table had the steak tips and the fourth meal was a burger. Everyone, including myself, enjoyed their meals. We also had the nachos for an app, which were fairly good. Our server, as well as the various food runners, was terrific. Very friendly and efficient. The location is nice, the restaurant itself is trendy and modern looking, with plenty of flat screens above to catch your favorite sporting events. Free parking is available and even though it's located at a golfing club, the restaurant is casual dress. \\n\\nA couple of things that some might view as drawbacks. First, it's noisy---loud music and voices travel through the establishment. Usually, this doesn't bother me, but it is worth pointing out that if you are dining out with the intention of having conversations, or catching up with people you haven't seen in a while, you will find it a tad annoying having to shout your words, or have to constantly lean in to hear what someone is saying. Just an FYI. \\n\\nSecondly; I should have quit while I was ahead, but I was coaxed into ordering dessert with the rest of my family. Our server informed us that the dessert menu changes daily, and the desserts are provided by Montillio's Bakery (local area bakery.) 2 from our table ordered key lime pie (which they enjoyed), I ordered the chocolate \\"something or another\\" cake, and I don't remember what the fourth dessert was. As far as my chocolate cake? Regrettable. It was nothing more than dry chocolate cake with cream filling inside a chocolate layer shell. Honestly, I might as well have been eating a hostess cup cake, because that's exactly what it tasted like. Just another FYI---I'm not delusional in assuming people come here for the desserts, or care much about the noise issues. It's just worth pointing out. \\n\\nThis place is great for a few drinks, meeting up with friends, grabbing a good meal, and just unwinding from the day."},{"name":"The Matador","address":"1438 NW 23rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Went for happy hour.

Groupons are clearly being offered right now because of all the construction around the restaurant.  I dropped my senior dining partner off to go and find a parking space.  When I made my way back she was one of two parties seated in a large dining room.  Told me she'd told our server she was getting blasted by cold air and was simply told 'the whole room is like that,' with no offer to change seating.  She moved over *one table* and the problem was rectified.  I had never been here before and did not know Carroll's had a 'lobster fest,' nor that it was disqualified in the fine print of the Groupon, but upon entering a specials board noted boiled and baked stuffed lobsters among other choices.  When our server returned I presented our Groupon which she peered at to see 'if it was the right one,' then said she'd leave it on the table and take it later.  She read a list of specials, never pointing out that the lobsters were not included.  I ordered them.  When she presented the check she THEN told me my dinner hadn't been included and tried to act like she didn't realize we had a Groupon (my dining partner was quick to remind her of the earlier exchange).  There was only one add'l party in the dining room.  All I got was 'it's the rules.'  I have used plenty of Groupons and *always* had the server point out when something was not included.   The Groupon cost $35 (for $60) and I had $35 deducted from my check.  Great.

We were the only customer and there was only one parking spot available.  Restaurant interior was minimally decorated and ambient is casual. We noticed it was extremely cold inside (it was about 40 degrees outside and inside) as if the heater wasn't on.  \\n\\nWe ordered two platters - beef shawarma and falafel, and two mint tea. The platters come with pita bread and  rice. The full platter gets both salad and hummus, while the half gets either salad or hummus. Despite dining in, our food came in to-go boxes, with the lids closed. I immediately feel unwelcome. But whatever....on to the food. The rice and falafel are highlight of the night. Both are very flavorful and are some of the best we have had. The hummus and salad are just OK.....nothing special. Though the beef shawarma was flavorful, it was dry and tough - just like grilled meat in many other Mediterranean restaurants. The pita sadly fell short. It was flat, hard, and flavorless (wife said it's between a pita and pita chip).....I can literally get better pita from Kroger. The worst thing was the mint tea. It's really just watered down black tea with fresh mint leave....absolutely bland with hint of mint. At $1.99 per cup, I expect a semi decent cup of mint tea.....even a tiny cup. \\n\\nOverall, it was OK.

Trust me people there are enough bakeries on the South Shore go do your business there because White's clearly doesn't care.  I didn't want my money back I wanted another cake. I guess they didn't have permission to do that either since the manager wasn't there??

From the time we were sat until the time we left, our waiter ignored us and showed that he hated his life on his face. We ordered our meals which came out quickly, but one order was completely wrong. Like a different meal, completely wrong. The person I was dining with refused to say anything because of the way the experience had gone thus far. Once we got our meals, we had no utensils, which required me to get up and go looking for them. Then our our drinks went empty, then we ran out of salsa....each time we had to hunt someone down because our waiter was nowhere to be found. It was 2PM on a sunday, the restaurant wasn't very busy.....what was happening here? Our waiter was having a bad day or maybe just checked out or both. We were ready to go and hunted down a hostess for boxes and a check. The boxes came but the check took quite a while more as our waiter took his time. I'll stick to the SOLA location for now on.

The chicken was overly charred and the spice level in the tacos was all over the place. One was mild, the other was burning my tongue off. The tortillas are not made in house. The margaritas are delicious but are a bit spendy. The refried beans were bland and worse than canned. On a positive note, the queso dip was absolutely delicious.

So, when I first found out about Get Sum Dim Sum, I was understandably skeptical.  Neon pink signs?  A non-sketchy location outside of Chinatown?  Surely, the food would be inauthentic and expensive.  I assumed they would serve General Tso's chicken in bamboo steamers and laugh all the way to the bank, having conned gullible whiteys out of their lunch money.\\n\\nMy husband and I had a quick lunch there today and were, to say the least, pleasantly surprised.  The menu options are pretty authentic.  They have pretty much everything my family would get at traditional dim sum, including har gao (shrimp dumplings), pork shu mai, law baw gao (daikon cake), wu kok (fried taro paste), chang fun (rice noodle sheet dumplings), sesame balls, egg tarts, zongzi (sticky rice wrapped in bamboo or lotus leaves), and cha sao bao (barbecued pork buns).  (Apologies for my inaccurate pinyin and inconsistent crossover between Mandarin and Cantonese pronunciations.  Usually, when I order at traditional dim sum, I just point at the things I like on the carts.)\\n\\nYou can order a la carte, as you would at traditional dim sum, and they also offer two combination specials, which seem to be directed at dim sum newcomers.  If you're new to dim sum, I recommend the GetSum combo, which gives you two dim sum dishes (try the har gau and pork shu mai), a pork or veggie bao, and a sweet sesame ball.  Ask the server for an extra plate, because you'll need it for pouring your soy sauce and chili sauce, which you can find on the condiments table, along with the napkins and chopsticks.\\n\\nThe food itself is pretty good.  Sure, it's not going to be the best dim sum you've ever had (for me, that title still belongs to Chau Chow City in Boston), nor is it going to be the cheapest, but if you're craving dim sum on a weekday or just want to grab a bite with a few friends, Get Sum Dim Sum is a great option.  Truth be told, I think this place is *better* than Shanghai, which is expensive compared to most dim sum restaurants and serves tiny portions.\\n\\nAll in all, I'm a big fan of the concept.  I can have dim sum without feeling like I have to bring nine of my best friends along, I can order just a few of my favorite dishes, and I don't have to make the trek to Houston to get decent dim sum.  Just one thing, Yelp -- could you *please* remove the \\"Asian Fusion\\" label from the listing?  While the concept is innovative, the food itself is certainly not fusion (it's 100% Cantonese), and the fusion label nearly turned me off from trying it in the first place."},{"name":"Vanbarry's Public House","address":"4120 S Orange Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"MAC ATTACK!

So we pulled up to this memorial dr location and that ladies and gentlemen is the ONLY reason I will give them one star! ONLY because they were open late on a Sunday. So we walked in at 11:13pm and they were closing at midnight.  When we walked in there wasn't a greeter and several employees walked past us. So seven minutes later we were approached kinda of rudely. This employee informed us that the kitchen was closing in a few minutes so i politely suggested that we should be seated then. So this employee said it may be little wait. I looked around at SEVERAL empty tables and pointed at one. So he said ok and we followed him to this table. Well the table was dirty so he kinda cleaned it. I pulled my id out right away because I wanted to start with a daiquiri. The bar tender called for last alcohol and the waiter walked right up. Soon as he approached the table he spotted my id and said last alcohol was already called. I said I know she literally just said it and he said yeah but she'll get mad if we put orders in after she call last call. I said instead of debating with me you could be trying to put our order in. He faked walked off and came right back and said I'm sorry no more alcohol will be served tonight she said that's it. I said what's her name and he told me her name was Destiny. This guy was more concerned about upsetting his coworker than taking care of his customer! I was really annoyed so I asked him if the kitchen was still accepting orders. His response was I believe so. I asked him if he could be certain before we ordered. He went to find out and the answer was yes and we ordered. I ordered the appetizer platter my husband ordered the boneless wings. I settled for a strawberry lemonade. It looked like it had been sitting in the back a while because it was separated like it wasn't recently poured (I know it separates) and had crap floating in it!  Now it's time to tell you about the food like product that was presented to us...... my boneless wings were not completely covered in the honey bbq sauce and they were cold. My quesadilla had burnt residue from the pan on them and were soggy on the inside. I had mozzarella sticks and partial sticks mozzarella nuggets lol. It was as if they reached the bottom of the bag and gave me what was left. The marinara sauce tasted as if it was stored in the fridge without a lid and it dried out and right before they brought it out they added a few too many drops of water in it. Lastly the tortilla chips that they gave me were stale stale stale! Ridiculous and disgusting and simply disrespectful! Then they cut the music off and an waitresses thought it would be a good idea to stream ratchet music from her cellphone muffled in her back pocket! Like are you serious?

You must have just caught them on an off day.\\" Oh, and I went to the Feast night market and Chef Ware's bite was one of the best of the night. So when some good friends suggested this spot for our monthly fine dining meal, I was actually excited, despite my mixed experience last time. I'm glad I went back. \\n\\nThe experience at Smallwares is still a mixed one for me. There are some dishes that I find delicious and exciting, and others that fail to move me. The chicken lollipops with sriracha mayo are still quite tasty (however the $11 price point is up there), and the octopus salad with pumpkin, miso, radish, pine nuts, sesame and chili is a fantastic mix of interesting flavors and beautifully-done textures. I am always impressed with properly cooked octopus, and the creamy pumpkin mixes so well with the dish. Well worth the $12 it runs.\\n\\nThe envelope-pushing carrot gnocchi with nori pure√©, pickled chilis and chanterelles is something I'd order again in a heartbeat. But at $13 or a very small portion, I can only afford so many heartbeats. The scallop sashimi with aji amarillo, lychee and pink peppercorn explodes on the tongue with a mix of sweet and hot... really damn hot. Be warned, I can palate some really hot stuff and was taken totally by surprise by the spice level on this dish. For $10 you'd get a lot more scallop even at a pricey joint like Bamboo.\\n\\nThe oxtail curry has that wonderful earthy flavor so common in burmese and Indian curries but also veers toward some SE Asian flavors. At $17, the portion doesn't quite match the price. Another hunk or two of oxtail would be nice in that dish. And one of my bigger surprises of the meal was the pear kimchi - a spicy and slightly sweet kimchi with a fantastic texture. We enjoyed a trio of kimchis but in the future would go with just the pear (because $5 is way too much for a bowl of radish or cabbage kimchi, but the pear is something special). \\n\\nWe also experienced quite a few misses on the menu. The somen noodles with chili paste, sesame, fried egg and hijiki tasted like a pile of somen noodles with way too much gochujang. And $13 for this combo is ridonk. The brusskes with xo sauce, satsumas and black bean sauce is dominated by the black bean sauce, which has that sort of nutty flavor. It didn't jive with the xo and brussels. Normally we're huge on brussels and were not stoked on this dish. The mabo dofu is tasty (I liked it better this time around) but comes in a size that's less than 1 cup for $9. Our pork and kimchi pancakes were, IMHO, very tasty (creme fraiche and kimchi? Oh yes!) but my dining partners did not like the mushy consistency of the \\"pancakes\\" at all. Be forewarned that texture can be an issue with these (they're not really pancakes). The rockfish in kimchi broth disappointed as well. While the kimchi broth itself was kind of tasty (albeit simple), it didn't stand up to the fish and was too thin to stick to the fish, so I felt like I was just eating a plain fish filet followed by spoonfuls of broth. \\n\\nI was smart to avoid the $8 soft boiled egg this time and opted instead for the deep-fried six-minute egg with chinese mustard, a tasty bar snack and much more appropriately priced at $4. The deep-fried kale was much, much better on this pass. Last time the dish was unevenly sauced and sitting in a puddle of fish sauce (so the bottom half of the dish was mushy). This time the dish was perfectly evenly-sauced and good to the last bite. Such a wonderful dish. The oysters du jour (Netarts) with fish sauce, cilantro and lime have a hidden bit of spicy heat to them. Tasty for sure, and probably the most appropriately-priced thing on the menu at $2 each. \\n\\nOn this pass, our service was great, wine suggestions totally on point (and props for having some really interesting wines on the list!). I'm fond of the folks who work here, and the space is definitely interesting. I enjoyed eating in the bar - it felt more active and upbeat. But the outdoor bathroom situation is a little tough on those 28 degree nights. Yikes!\\n\\nOverall I did enjoy my meal at Smallwares. Well, part of it. Some of the dishes push past many lines, and totally hit their target. Others don't really come even close. And the price points still chafe. I spend a lot of money on food, and it's not just a question of portion size:price. In fact, I hate focusing on price, but I can't help myself. I'd definitely come back again but I'd be pretty selective about what I order.  \\n\\nI wish Chef Ware would put her bite from the Feast night market on the menu here.

We were especially concerned about the two somewhat recent reviews that disparaged the wine service, because we like doing the wine pairing thing.\\n\\nAll I can say is, ignore all the negative reviews. First of all, the food is incredible. The taste combinations are inventive, with unusual combinations that taste fantastic together. For example, geoduck with a thin slice of lardon (pork fat) and coconut milk. The sea freshness of the clam with the umami of the fat and sweetness of the coconut were amazing together. Many interesting dishes, many with a vegetable emphasis, but some totally not. One carnivore delight might even make a carnivore (the human kind) squeamish -- antelope heart tartare. Don't think about what the meat source is -- it is absolutely delicious.\\n\\nSecond, let's talk about the wine. Another reviewer complained that he felt the pours were meagre -- \\"two sips\\", he said. That was not our experience. We've been to establishments like Castagna all over the world, and we felt the wine quantity poured here was similar and sufficient for each course, and generally, there was a glass of something per course. More importantly, the somm here is fantastic. Very friendly once engaged, and his paring selections were spot on. Every wine (and some are not wine) complemented the dishes very well, and in one case, transformed the dish completely. That dish was a good, but otherwise unspectacular albacore tuna sashimi. I took a bite; hmm, ok, it's a nice piece of fish. Then I took a sip of the wine. Oh my goodness, the taste of the wine and tuna together was such that all I could do was exclaim \\"wow!\\". Another example: there is a foie gras course. One might expect a sweet wine, but no, what's served is still something sweet, but it's something quite unexpected: a glass of vermouth and soda. It worked really well. The skill of this somm in food-wine matching is superb, and of course, he's well versed on the technical aspects of the wine too.\\n\\nFinally, dessert. Someone else complained they got three ice cream desserts. It's true that there is a frozen dessert aspect to the three dessert courses, but each of them were very different in taste and composition. Some similar restaurants we've been to have been let down by their dessert offerings. Not here. The desserts are as thoughtful and well constructed as the savory aspects of the menu. The whole meal feels of a piece, which is not always the case.\\n\\nWe visit Portland somewhat regularly, and we're going to be back at Castagna next trip!"},{"name":"La Sultana Bakery","address":"40 Maverick Sq","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I had no idea tiramisu could be so transcendent.

For $8 I got five sad looking fried to death wings on a plate. Two of the wings weren't whole as if they were almost like a bone had broken and this was the meat that had clung in and happened to get fried. There was no seasoning on the wings either so I drenched them in some Chili oil for some flavour. They were also overcooked and dry. I eat chicken wings more than the average person I think and I can tell the difference between a good product and a shitty one and this chicken was not a healthy it happy chicky.

Crispy, skin, and dry in texture m, which is characteristic of this preparation. It was served with buns and flavorful. I asked for green onions, which I saw them using in the open kitchen for their beef rolls. They can back and said \\"sorry, no green onions\\". Really? And they only had two sauces, ginger vinegar (for XLB) and house hot sauce. Really? No hoisin?

The XKB were good, better than average, but disappointed that there were only two XLB options left.\\n\\nThe shrimp potstickers were good and you can tell they hand make them upon order.\\n\\nThe Dan dan noodles were a fail. Noodles over cooked and honestly can't hold a candle to Peaceful. That said, we didn't com for that dish.\\n\\nThe other minus star, honestly, was the lack of knowledge on the wait staff. Generally younger, I can tell this is just a job for them so they had no knowledge of what was in the food or how it was prepared. Maybe I had high expectations, but what we ordered was not exotic because the staff couldn't explain the dishes I wanted to try.

These were a nice balance to the fried and dacedently creamy rest of the meal. The tacos we got added a nice variety, the vegetarian ones were flat with nice flavors and the snapper one was crunchy and fried. The huevos dish was a bit one note but still good nonetheless, the hollandaise sauce was done well and richly creamy. The red tomato sauce dish was creamy as well and very good.

Recently I had a huge Shanghai craving and desperately wanted to come here. I found out the name was 'Top Shanghai Cuisine Restaurant' and kinda laughed to myself. Anytime a restaurant uses an adjective like 'top', best', 'amazing', or anything similar, they're probably tooting their own horn a bit. I found that with this instance, if the food was the only important thing that was being considered than yes the name of the restaurant would be very accurate.\\n\\nThe food was really good overall. My group ordered two types of xiao long bao, a green onion pancake, and rice cakes with scallops, squid, and prawns. The xiao long bao at this restaurant are probably the most favourite ones I've had. The soup inside is plentiful and delicious. Could easily just order only xiao long bao until I'm full. Green onion pancake was a solid serving as well, just wish portions was just a bit bigger. I love rice cakes and their serving was really satisfying to have. A bit too oily for my tastes overall but it hit the spot really well.\\n\\nI didn't have a problem with my food at all. I had a problem with the service. My group struggled with marking down what we wrote as we aren't very well versed outside of English. It was fairly annoying having to play a matching game trying to figure out what was what on the order sheet. As well, I was very unimpressed with how dismissive much of the waitresses were towards us. I don't appreciate the eyerolling because we didn't conform to their expectations of being fluent in Mandarin/Cantonese just because we looked Chinese. I think once they realized that the waitresses did their best to ignore us until we flagged one down to put in our order. Was not happy at all about things.\\n\\nIt's pretty easy for me to sum up my thoughts about Top Shanghai Cuisine. Some of the best Shanghai food I've ever had. Some of the most frustrating service I've ever had. I rank the quality of food higher over service so it's a thumbs up from me in that regard.

We made a reservation for 2 at 5:30pm on a Saturday (1000 points on OpenTable, too). Being 5:30pm, the restaurant was pretty quiet (a total of 3-4 tables occupied near the end of our meal).\\n\\nOverall service was as you'd expect for such a restaurant: impeccable. Tables are cleared as soon as the plates are finished but they were never intrusive, silverware replaced every course, bread crumbs cleaned off, etc. They even folded our napkins if we left the table for any reason! Well, like I said, we don't enjoy such fine dining very often.\\n\\nWe chose the 7-course tasting menu. I had called ahead and arranged a vegetarian 7-course for my wife and a regular 7-course for myself (FYI, they are happy to do vegetarian versions of any number of courses, as long as everyone at the table has the same *number* of courses). We did not choose wine pairings, but the ginger lime soda was pretty good!\\n\\nFood arrived quickly. First, several courses of amuse-bouche (\\"snacks\\" on the menu):\\n\\n1. Beet chip + beef tartare/beet tartare, watermelon infused with elderflower, nori chip + chicken liver mousse/roasted eggplant mousse: excellent start, elderflower was very subtle but the watermelon had an interesting crispy/crunchy texture to it, both the tartare and the mousse were rich and creamy and were well complemented by their respective chips.\\n\\n2. Oyster with savory/lovage, roasted zucchini: I'm not the biggest fan of oysters so I won't comment on it, but my wife liked the roasted zucchini.\\n\\n3. Butter lettuce + halibut mousseline/porcini mousseline: so light, perfect crunch, no hint of grease at all, great balance.\\n\\nThen a bread course accompanied by lard + hazelnut and butter + browned butter bits on top. The bread was very light, airy, and chewy at the same time (thought slightly greasy), the lard was wonderfully rich (but I felt overwhelmed the hazelnut), but the best part was the browned butter bits: so much caramelization, so much depth of flavor!\\n\\nThird course: cucumber salad with lemon basil, mine had Dungeness crab. The crab was sweet and light, but I never expected the lemon basil to enhance the meatiness of the crab so much that for a second I did not think I was eating crab! Excellent pairing, though I felt that the vegetarian equivalent was a bit... lacking in imagination? Really, just cucumbers?\\n\\nFourth course: grilled squid in foamed jus of mussels/stuffed nettle leaf with rice, various grilled aliums. I thought the squid was getting a little rubbery, but the grilled aliums were delicious with the jus (and who knew that garlic flowers are so pretty?). My wife thought the stuffed nettle leaf was good - just good.\\n\\nFifth course: seared albacore/seared porcini, fermented garlic aioli, green bean/fava bean salad. The albacore was good, the aioli was great, but what blew me away was actually the salad: both beans were so young and tender and full of umami that it took me back to my childhood in China when I last had such flavorful beans (can't seem to find good ones here even in the farmer's market)! My wife thought the porcini was great, too - they actually managed to create a texture similar to the albacore with a seared outside and a tender inside, which I thought was quite neat.\\n\\nSixth course (not on menu): tomato and beets salad with lemon sage. For someone who doesn't like beets, this was unexpectedly delicious: they were stewed for so long that they were fork tender, sweet, earthy, and well complemented by some savory and juicy tomato that certainly did not come from some greenhouse in Florida.\\n\\nSeventh course: grilled pork + fermented pork sausage + truffle aioli for me, grilled eggplant + grilled zucchini + scallion oil for her. First time having pork less than well done for me, it was good but not mind-blowing, overly lean and lacking in juice that had to be made up with the aioli. Pork sausage was Thai/Vietnamese-inspired - it was delicious. My wife thought the grilled eggplant/zucchini was quite good as well.\\n\\nEighth course: the desserts have arrived!\\n\\n1. Almond custard and crumble, raspberry and lemon basil sorbet, fresh raspberries, anise: a variety of contrasting flavors, textures, and temperatures, very playful, refreshing, delicious.\\n\\n2. Roasted meringue, potato ice cream, Sherry ice: meringue was well caramelized and delicious, though I did not quite understand the point of potato ice cream - I don't think I tasted anything! Interesting concept, not entirely sure it worked out.\\n\\n(It was never explained why we got an extra course that was not on the 7-course menu, but on the chef's choice menu.)\\n\\nFinal thoughts:\\nGreat ambience, fantastic service, great food. A few items were genuinely mind-blowing (e.g. lemon basil with Dungeness crab), most were very good, a few (e.g. potato ice cream) just OK. The vegetarian menu could have been more creative. Overall, it was a great experience."},{"name":"Press Pub On 5th - Grandview","address":"1505 W 5th Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"Delicious place to visit in Grandview!

The only close comparison would be Dishoom in London, and well, that's on another continent. The clear correct strategy is to order as many dishes as you can, taking advantage of most them being available as half orders. It is worth getting the infamous lamb popsicle, which is available as a single bone if needed. I happen to own their cookbook and have tried to make said lamb. It's better here. Aside from that, either come with a bunch of friends or try their \\"staff meal\\", which gets you a thali-style sampler of many dishes.\\n\\nIn terms of what makes it special, two things. One, as noted elsewhere, they use a more \\"fancy\\" set of ingredients. You're getting rabbit instead of chicken, shredded duck in your koftas instead of pulverized chickpeas or ground lamb, local heirloom beets, etc. Second, they have a slight twist on the usual spices. I'm not sure I can tell you what it is, I just can tell that their seasoning blend for things like a simple vegetable curry is just a little bit different in a good way that adds a real depth of flavor.\\n\\nDrinks are pretty solid too. They follow the standard craft cocktail formula of \\"take an ordinary recipe like a Margarita or Manhattan, tweak one or two ingredients, prepare carefully\\", but I enjoyed the set of them I sampled. There's what you would expect, a strong emphasis on infusions made with Indian-subcontinent spices.\\n\\nThere's a lot of notes below about the wait. Come on a Monday or a Tuesday.

Sorry we are out of clams. Strike One! We end up ordering the calamari anyway because we are both starving. We stare at the menu endlessly, sipping our drinks and talking with some people I know that happen to be sitting at the bar.

The only things left were a double IPA, the Porter, cider and the Happy Sol.  The Happy Sol was the only beer that wasn't ridiculously strong.

Even during the dinner rush or lunch rush  (on weekends), there's usually one poor soul having to do it all. Occasionally, you'll see a second person, but rarely do they help out.

My boyfriend had ordered dinner and a drink.\\n\\nWhen the owner brought a side of bread to our table for him, he spotted my food and went off on me about how I can't bring \\"someone else's\\" food to his shop. Which I get, regulations, etc. But the whole time he was talking AT me his tone was incredibly rude and accusatory. It was embarrassing. My sick, out-of-it self just said \\"okay\\" and put it away.\\n\\nI didn't even realize how rude he had been until my guy spoke up and told me that he was upset I'd been talked down to like that, and that we could go somewhere else. Which we did. Never coming back. Good job losing patrons, Palio.

Located next to The W and near Lenox Mall, this place brings a little flavor to Buckhead. The live music is a nice touch and it turns into a full out party with a DJ later. The full bar accommodates most who just are there for music and a drink with friends. We were there for a private event/dinner upstairs. It's pretty spacious and has its own full bar with staff upstairs. There were 3 total party spaces in the private area. Our host did an amazing job taking care of our party of 20.\\n\\nThere was a pre-set menu which included a personalized menu (nice touch). Also, your choice of Salmon, Prime rib, and chicken for the entree choices. The prime rib was huge! Super tender so you could probably cut it with a butter knife. Seasoned well, but the medium was more like rare towards the center. The appetizers were all delicious (beef skewers, calamari, shrimp). Overall my complaint was that all of the food was room temperature, it could've been due to the host being a bit overwhelmed getting the food out. The entire meal cost $70/pp and it included several dessert trays as well.  Not too bad for the ambiance and considering the amount of food. \\n\\nAfterwards, we hung out downstairs and ordered a few more drinks. They close at 3am, but the waitress downstairs was ready to put us out at 2am. She was sweeping the floors around us and rolling her eyes when we asked for anything from the bar.

Also got a special sauce for my last taco which had a hoisin flavor that really changed the dish and is well worth an ask. The other sauces are your typical salsas. Pickled veggies extremely tasty. Bacon ham a perfect schmear for each taco but not necessary as barbacoa is the real flavor king and you wanna taste all the juices with each bite. Very good dish and a must order perfect to share.

They put our table of 8 in an upstairs room, semi-private, which would have been a nice amenity had it not been directly over the open kitchen. Two problems with this: ungodly heat and the uncalled for shouting of the cook staff from the open kitchen. Anyone who knows anything about kitchen etiquette trains the staff to be inobtrusive at the least. The noise made conversation next to impossible. And the heat made eating enjoyment next to impossible.\\n\\nThe drinks were sub par and my $8 glass of wine was an extremely stingy pour, maybe 2.5 oz at best. And it was terrible! It should have had a little fizz but it was flat and tasted old. It was almost to the point of being vinegar.\\n\\nThe server was perfunctory at best and was a little patronizing to me. I have Parkinson's and do not  always speak clearly or loudly enough. After she had to ask me a second time, she began to completely ignore me and addressed her questions to my husband...as if I were incapable of communication. This type of ignorance warrants  a refresher of the ADA and sensitivity training. Immediately!\\n\\nThe menu was a hard read and the components of the dishes were jarring and discordant. My brother had an octopus salad over chickpeas and I couldn't figure out why until the salad came. The chickpeas camouflaged the fact that there was very little octopus present. My beet salad was tasteless and watery. My sister in law's calamari came in a sodden lump and was mostly batter. My father had the lobster bisque. It was not house made but a frozen product well known to those of us in the industry. This is not a bad product, but it had been diluted almost beyond recognition. I believe it also reappeared as the sauce on the seafood grits. More on that later.\\n\\nWe waited 45 minutes between appetizers and entrees. From the frenetic yelling coming from the kitchen, I would say they were in the weeds. when they finally brought the entrees, they served randomly. Men first. And the back waiter had to ask who got what. Not in my book of restaurant etiquette.\\n\\nThe seafood grits had 3 exceedingly overcooked shrimp, underdone (read gritty) grits and no other seafood. My husband had a delmonico that didn't look like any delmonico I ever saw. It was supposed to be a 28 day aged steak and should have been tender as butter. It was rubbery, unseasoned and tasteless. Mom had paella. It was inedible and the server wasn't bright enough to ask about it. My father had Caesar salad with scallops. He ate it, but was up with diarrhea all night.  Fortunately, it didn't require a trip to the ER, but as he is nearly 80, it's dangerous to be so careless with food safety or should I say non food safety. In addition, my sister in law's food came to the table stone  cold and due to the infrequency of visits from the waitstaff to our table , she had to take her plate downstairs to get someone's attention .\\n\\nThis experience at Pisces Rising was a huge disappointment. They knew it was my parents anniversary, but it was never mentioned. The bad food and general haphazard attention to detail is inexcusable.

We ordered the Chorizo Molotes to start and wow, they were absolutely amazing. Don't expect a traditionally sized molote but definitely prepare yourself for some amazing flavors. We then moved onto the Ceviche Suerte which was made with red snapper. Again, it was absolutely delicious, all the flavors were there and the execution was near perfect. For the mains we got the Suadero Tacos and Carne Asada. The tacos were amazing! They use a brisket confit topped with avocado, lime, and onions and it came together nicely. The carne asada was in a salsa with black beans and topped with crispy onions. Very hearty flavors and very good but we preferred the tacos. Most notably for both meals though were the tortillas.

Our glasses spent more time empty than full and it took me about 10 minutes to get silverware after my food arrived. Again. Not good. \\n\\nI ordered the Ribeye medium rare and surprise surprise, it came well done and burnt around the edges. I'm pretty fair about when things get a little over cooked but, wow.

I REALLY want to. A few people I like, like it here. It looks cool. It feels cool. I like the name. It's a good location.  \\n\\nBut I've given you 3 tries over the course of 18months and I have to give up now, BarTaco. No more will I eat your pitifully small flavorfully unremarkable portions. \\n\\nBaja fish taco- $2.50 for a thumb-sized piece of fried fish (that actually tastes good, which is notable here), topped w a tablespoon of raw chopped onion, a suggestion of cilantro, and maybe 1/2 teaspoon of something creamy smeared underneath. For $4 go to Verde and get a fish taco 3x the size, with a generous helping of cabbage and yummy sauce and coconut on top. Or cross the street to Tahona for a larger much tastier fish taco. \\n\\nCauliflower taco- 3 little pieces of COLD roasted cauliflower w a teaspoon of decent tasting sauce. But you can't even warm the cauliflower, BarTaco? For cauliflower tacos go to Fresh Thymes where the cauliflower is sizzling hot and oozing with saucey flavor and housemade kimchi that all blend together and will pour down your hands while you eat. And each taco will have its own private slice of avocado on top of it (there's about as much volume of avocado just garnishing the cauliflower tacos at Fresh Thymes as there is in the entire filling of the tacos at BarTaco). They are so good your face might fall off. \\n\\nChicken chorizo taco- that maybe 1 tablespoon of chicken smeared on the taco tasted nothing like chorizo.  In any way. Or really taste like anything much at all actually. Again more raw onion than chicken. Cheap, cheap, cheap. Go to Taco Bell and eat a bean tostada for a more filling and satisfying experience. \\n\\nTuna taco- again, tiny portion of fish. They forgot to add any sort of flavoring situation. While chewing,  \\"why?\\" was my only thought reaction. \\n\\nIf you need to eat tacos on this block, just cross the street to Tahona. They have pretty much the same options and everything is bigger and better.  Or even Chipotle. \\n\\nSides:\\nColeslaw- for $2.50 you can get about 1.5 tablespoons of shredded veggies. Which is about as much slaw as there really should have been on just one of the tacos. Nothing happening on the flavor front. \\n\\nSpicy cucumber salad- this was the best thing I have eaten there, 2x. Could still stand to be a bit cheaper.

I thoroughly enjoyed my lunch here today.\\n\\nI was meeting a friend for lunch and she picked the place.  Living in Gahanna, I was well aware of this restaurant - having seen it many times, but not having eaten here since it was the Italian Eatery.  Prior to agreeing to this spot, I checked out both the Yelp reviews and the menu.  Fortunately, the reviews and pictures helped explain what I was reading in the menu - and I made the excellent decision to try it out.\\n\\nWe met for lunch on a Friday at 12:30 PM.  Prime time for the lunch crowd.  Being a small restaurant/seating area, I was pleased to see 2 spots that would seat 2 people.  I got there first and was warmly greeted and shown to the table.  There are a couple TVs about the bar and one wide open room.  I ordered a diet coke (Coke products) and only had to wait a few minutes for my friend to arrive - I was early and she was on time.\\n\\nThe waitress did an excellent job of giving us room to chat and scan the menu.  I already knew what I was going for - being a salad person.  My only decision was whether to have grilled veggies or shredded chicken on top.  I was still unsure whether the ensalada would look like  normal salad or what I might get.  I went with the shredded chicken on the salad.\\n\\nGREAT decision.  There was an incredible amount of chicken, avacodo, tomatoes and all kinds of goodness. It was a BIG salad - just what I wanted and LOVE!  Fortunately for me, my friend was not a shy eater and mostly cleaned her plate - so I didn't feel bad as I kept eating and eating and just about emptied the bowl.\\n\\nThe only thing keeping this from 5 stars is the price.  Adding the chicken put it over the top of what I want to pay for lunch - even though my friend paid.  I definitely own her a lunch - and a good one too.\\n\\nI will definitely be back and bring my hubby.  I'm sure he'll find something he can eat - and probably like.

I must have done something right in my last incarnation to have such grand food in my present life. This is basically some of the finest lamb ever served in a restaurant.

Next time I'll go for a slice of cake or cheesecake. Or pie.\\n\\nAs far as the atmosphere, the \\"study room\\" was pretty nice, but so cold! Maybe it was just the corner where I sat, but I was away from doors and windows. A few more bones to pick:\\n\\n1) The bathroom. Their soap dispenser was grimy and just gross. Super nasty. I hated touching it, even though I was about to wash my hands! How can they keep refilling that thing? Buying a new one would cost them a buck.\\n\\n2) The service. Seemed indifferent. I'm not expecting anything over the top, but the people working there hardly smiled, and I went to the counter 4 times (3 orders and one refill) in 4 hours. Also, as they walk through the room to deliver food, it'd be a nice touch to clear empty plates from the tables.\\n\\nI know I might sound picky, but I think these are very simple fixes! It would cost them nearly nothing to fix both of the points I made above. \\n\\nI'm still giving them 4 stars because it was a good place to study, and I'll likely come back.

The bar tender was friendly, knowledgeable, and earned accolades on the included review paper with the bill. The food was spot on. Both types of taco were prepared to perfection. Ahi was flash grilled and served as lettuce wrap on Bibb or Butter lettuce. Flavors were awesome. Swordfish was a little less orgasmic until house jalape√±o sauce was added. Then kaboom!  Delicious.

There was a burger place in there somewhere but we never made it. Daniel changes jobs more often than a diva changes clothes but, wherever he is at any given time, you know what you are going to get: impeccably and imaginatively prepared dishes leaning in the general direction of seafood but focusing mostly on perfect execution, presentation and quality at a level at which it doesn't really matter what the ingredients are -- you are going to be blown away anyway.\\n\\nSwank (and its lower brow adjunct, Swine) do not vary from the template. Both establishments are located in the Paramount hotel in downtown Portland, the former being a restaurant with bar and the latter (so we heard) being a bar with food. Daniel is the executive chef for both and was very much in evidence when we visited Swank last week. The restaurant had just opened so both Daniel and the manager were obviously nervous about how it would all work out.\\n\\nFor us, it worked out spectacularly. For die-hard Mondock fans, the fare is not surprising but the quality is right up there as expected both in terms of the food, its preparation and presentation and in terms of the imaginative (should I say inspired) way in which the various ingredients are combined into a delicious and intriguing whole. If you like to go out to dinner to get food that you can't make just as well at home and that you probably would not have thought of anyway (sweetbreads with poached egg?), this is a must visit establishment.\\n\\nWe started out by sharing a plate of classic Mondock calamari, an offering that has been on the menu everywhere he has recently worked. OK, so fried calamari is not exactly an unheard-of dish but it can't be done better than what we had. As an \\"amuse-bouche\\" on steroids, we were treated to the foie gras appetizer that, to say the least, is different from what one would normally expect and just has to be tasted to be believed. Presumably this kind of spectacular generosity will not survive the opening period but we were most appreciative anyway. Our actual selections (too amazing to actually describe) were, as anticipated, beautiful to observe, delicious to eat and absolutely unique in conception. We dug in with gusto and were richly rewarded for our effort.\\n\\nOur daughter, who accompanied us, works in the restaurant biz and we are therefore treated on a regular basis to discursions about the need to balance the creative urge with economic reality. Unlike some of his prior efforts, we think that Mondock may be well placed to do this at Swank/Swine where he can combine the growing army of his loyal followers with a reasonable assortment of walk-ins from the Paramount, several other nearby hotels whose restaurants do not come close to matching Swank in either quality or creativity and the upscale business community from the nearby office towers. To do this, however, we think that he is going to need to address the dietary preferences of the business exec on an expense account who thinks that a good steak, grilled and served with the usual accompaniments, is the highest form of culinary expression. We love the menu as it is but, in the interest of our being able to return frequently to the same stand, we hope that it will expand to include a few of the old standards that keep the non-foodie world signing all those lovely credit card slips.\\n\\nIn the meantime, Swank can count on at least two loyal followers."},{"name":"Chipotle Mexican Grill","address":"4351 13th St","city":"Saint Cloud","stars":"2.5","text":"This USED  to be our favorite Chipotle to come to when we wanted a meal but things have changed for the WORSE.

It looks like a meal for a child not for an adult. No ones asking for mounds of rice and chicken but when that's all i am paying for it should be more than what a kid would eat.

I was not disappointed.\\n\\nFirst off, huge shoutout to the guy who took my order yesterday morning. It was about 8 AM and he was totally chipper, even attempted to make my grumpy baby smile. I would've expected equally grumpy workers behind the counter. So, my visit was off to a good start.\\n\\nNext, I ordered my go-to: Anaheim Scrambler. It's scrambled eggs with tomato, green onions and topped with a slice of avocado. I wasn't sure if that was a regional item or not, so I was happy to see it in the PNW.\\n\\nWhen my order came out, the first thing that caught my eye was the size. When it's 24 degrees outside, a hearty-sized meal is appreciated. And that's exactly what I got. I could barely see any plate.\\n\\nCompare this to the OC locations (looking specifically at you, SCP: You would have to whip out your magnifying glass or resurrect the Wendy's \\"Where's the beef?\\" lady. But with all that sun and trying to stay stick thin, I guess the portion is a regional thing.\\n\\nThe best part, though, was the amount of avocado. There was a decent-sized  slice topping my eggs. But what made it better was that there were chunks IN my eggs. Kudos to the chef! You know the way into this ex-Cali girl's heart! \\n\\nIn the OC, you'd be lucky if your slice of avocado wasn't see-through. They skimp on the avocado so much. \\n\\nThe toast and potatoes were kinda room temperature, but the eggs were warm. And the coffee was pretty good.

The cinnamon was way too strong for me. \\n\\nIt was a Sunday so they have their Prime Rib special dinner available which is only on Sundays. It includes your choice of salad, a side, and a dessert of your choice with your prime rib for 39.95. The Prime Rib was good. It was very tender and flavorful. In addition to that, we ordered a lobster tail cooked in truffle butter for an additional $12. It's a small tail and they actually slightly overcooked, possibly leaving under the lamp for awhile. Another side item we tried was the mac and cheese and that was the 2nd best thing that night. \\n\\nAs for dessert, we chose the Molten Lave Cake. The server said it takes about 15 minutes to prepare after ordering. Once again, the cake was over cooked because there was no 'lava' coming out of the cake. That was kind of a disappointment. \\n\\nThe only redemption from this meal was the prime rib and the service. Everything else was below average. For an up-scale chain, I really thought they would have had everything together. Besides the disappointment in our food, we had to wait literally 45 minutes for our actual entrees.

It also took about 30 minutes to make a virgin mojito for one of the girls at our table!

Have been here several times to take the family when they visit, and even endured waiting for a table back in the day, since they didn't take reservations a few yrs ago when it was on his former W 11th Avenue location. Have been twice on the past month, and have ordered the jackfruit (which I was on the fence myself) but the texture feels as if you are eating meat as the Masala (Indian sauce mixed with spices) has been cooked down in tons of onions to forgo the smell of jackfruit as it's pretty intense. Would highly recommend getting the BC local vegetables and assorted mushrooms as it is full of flavor from the local farms. Their sablefish in tomato sauce was cooked well. The sauce was good, and it tasted homemade and not heavy as most Indian restaurants, could be a tad bit spicier. We all commented how we appreciated that the fish was not immersed in the sauce, nice touch.  Have also tried their lamb popsicles in the past (they are so succulent), must get if you eat meat! They update their menu from time to time, and this is one of his signature dishes which in the main section yet now you can order it by the piece @ $11/chop. They serve naans and rice with the food and give complimentary chai (if you ask for it) but it is very sweet. A small suggestion would be to serve some of their dishes in smaller serving bowls to make it easier to soak up the goodness. As for dessert, we had coconut kheer (rice milk) and ordered the mango kulfi but it was so frozen, we had to send it back as we couldn't even cut into it.

Last night, it took security to get the guests, in the neighboring room to quite down at 3:30am. Clearly, they keep late hours but this isn't completely their fault. It's the joining doors. They just aren't thick enough nor big enough or something to block out the sound. I even tried stuffing towels under the doors but did absolutely no good. We actually have 2 of these joining doors in our suite. These internal doors have to be an issue with other guest, as well. I mean, it's so bad, they should be permanently closed up and just not offer that as an option. Update... 3rd night, no noise from either joining door so I'm assuming they all checked out. \\n\\nNo concierge lounge, sadly. The restaurant breakfast is a little expensive but good. Vanda, our server at breakfast was completely awesome... 5 Stars for her! The bar food was pretty good for appetizers. 1 complimentary beer and wine for each of us, for Titanium awards members is nice but limited in the choice of just 3 house wines. My question... for our stay of 4 nights, shouldn't there be a few more passes? I wonder if we were here for 1 or 2 nights, would we still get 1 pass each or no passes. \\n\\nAs far as the hotel, itself... it's big with lots of open modern space. The pool area is spacious and nice... But just as I dosed off, sitting out by the pool, a guy with a leaf blower decides to do maintenance in the middle of the day, right behind where I was lounging. When I asked, how long long he would be doing this... that I would just come back once he was done, the attendant just said, okay. Omg!\\n\\nOur suite is huge... the layout is a little odd but again, the interior joining doors is the BIGGEST problem. The shower/bath tub combo is old school, right down to the shower curtain and old mat residue. Most hotels have been updated to a large tiled shower with glass doors but that's okay. No robes but hey, the towels are so rough, they can easily be used to exfoliate.\\nValet and front desk staff are all nice and friendly. Still, 2 more nights to go. Hopefully, the neighbors will check out tomorrow and we will get to sleep a little earlier.... update... yes, our 3rd night was fine with no noise."},{"name":"Smokey Bones Bar & Fire Grill","address":"1000 Wp Ball Blvd","city":"Sanford","stars":"3","text":"I'm very surprised!

Loved the selection of beers you could pour yourself. Here's where it gets a little rusty, but they're new so maybe they will work this out. We came in at about 11:30, lunch-time but there was one party ahead of us in line. You stand in line to order your food then go sit down. With one party ahead of us, it took 10 minutes to get to the register to order our food. I thought, \\"maybe they're ordering something complicated\\" but when I saw them carry the food out later, it was just burgers.  That process is broken. I cannot imagine if there were ten groups in line how long the wait would be.  They have 2 registers, but it just doesn't seem efficient.  I would make the registers just for the purpose of ordering beer vouchers, and do everything else at the table.  It's for the benefit of the restaurant as well. If you can get people to the beer taps faster, that's more revenue.\\n\\nSecond thing. I'm conflicted on this because I understand that if you pre-pay your food and drink there's a chance you won't tip. However, automatically including a 15% \\"gratuity\\" is not a gratuity any more. It's a \\"service fee\\". I would prefer to see the food be 15% more expensive as this leaves a sour taste. Especially when the experience is self-serve. Sure, the owner and employees bring you the food and come by, but still- this is off-putting enough that I won't go back no matter how good I thought the food was, and how nice the people that work there are. \\n\\nFinally, and this is just a superficial detail. It's a very well designed, pretty space. I would add something in red on the tables to break up the all dark gray. \\n\\nI hope they succeed, and over-all the concept is fun, the food is good, the drink selections are great.

I first heard of Alfredo's while living overseas in South Africa - great news travels fast!  I adore Italian food and am especially a lover of spaghetti and meat sauce, but most importantly: meatballs.  I'm in perpetual search of the perfect meatball (right now that honor resides at Valenza) so I couldn't wait to try what is revered as the most traditional Italian restaurant in Atlanta.  \\n\\nWe decided to celebrate our hubby's birthday's at Alfredo's.  Several yelpers noted the necessity of making a reservation; I found it super easy to call ahead and let them know we had some birthday guys showing up.\\n\\nI was so pleased when we walked in:  wood-paneled walls, leather booths, old-school bar, dressed up waiters, and ol blue eyes on the speakers.  Totally my type of italian joint.  We got seated in a cozy corner booth and were promptly served some lovely picked treats (I LOVE pepperocinis!).  We BYOB'd as I had won two bottles of barolo in an auction the night before.  Our waiter happily opened up - and was even more to recognize the label and tip his hat at such a great wine to be poured.  Easy peasy.\\n\\nI could not, for the life of me, decide on anything.  It took us so long to decide that we got an appetizer, sacrificing stomach room for the sake of some super delicate fried calamari with delicious spicy marinara sauce.  YUM.  The garlic bread was also heavenly - very simple, crunchy, buttery garlic goodness.\\n\\nI finally settled on getting two half portions of pasta:  the fettucine verde and the canneloni.  I am a definite red sauce girl so I truly branched out a bit in ordering these two dishes.  That fettucine verde is the stuff dreams are made of:  a super delicate yet flavorful cream sauce, balanced against mushrooms and salty prosciutto.  WOW.  I loved that I've never had a dish like it anywhere else and that it wasn't so heavy for being a cream-based pasta.  I would highly recommend this as a must-order!  \\n\\nI also really enjoyed the canneloni. It was SUPER delicate and flavorful, and actually went really well with the fettucine verde. In the future, I will probably order a red sauce half portion to go with the fettucine verde again, as having two cream-based dishes was a lot to handle - but honestly, both dishes were so light that I definitely didn't feel stuffed eating them both.\\n\\nHubby ordered the Godfather, a delectable trio of veal.  While all three were really good, OMG, their veal parmigiana.  Perfection!  The chicken parmigiana was just as good (and is a secret menu item - sneaky!).  I would definitely order that again!  We also ordered up the sausage and peppers, which were recommended served with fettucine alfredo.  I never would have thought of that, but golly, sooooooo good.  Perfect traditional italian fare with amazing rat pack music in the background.  I've got the world on a string, indeed.\\n\\nTo top it all off, we were surprised with a birthday treat:  two candles, plus their amazing ricotta chocolate chip cheesecake, spumoni, and creme caramel.  The 4 of us shared it and just raved at how delicious all 3 desserts were - especially for an unexpected gratis birthday treat!  The cheesecake was rustic - it is definitely ricotta-heavy and so so good.  Again, a must order.\\n\\nOur waiter was amazing and I loved that he gave helpful recommendations and plenty of time for us to enjoy ourselves at the table.  We totally didn't feel rushed in our meal, which I feel like has been a theme of late, like they're trying to speed us along to turn the table.  It just made for a super relaxed vibe.\\n\\nApparently meatballs are a special on Friday/Saturday so I will have to return sometime soon for those!  I can only imagine how amazing they will be.\\n\\nSo, in sum, Alfredo's totally exceeded the hype I built up about it over the past 3 years.  This is the best spot to take someone for traditional, old-school Italian fare in Atlanta, and to be honest, its romantic too - a great first date spot!  35 years in the running is saying a lot about the restaurant, and I'm here to testify that its due to an amazing menu, fantastic service, and the perfect Italian ambience.

My daughter ordered rice and she was the one that actually wanted the salt and pepper because she said it tasted bland as well. Overpriced no taste food I should've went to Ruth's Chris instead.

Yebisuya Ramen offers specialty Japanese Ramen and Tapas cooked in the Japanese tradition. It is also conveniently located next to two other Japanese restaurants, one is there sister restaurant named Shoya and the other is the Kura Revolving Sushi restaurant. What catches the eye first outside is the display of plastic replicas of food you will find inside. The inside felt spacious, clean and bright.\\n\\nI had the Spicy Chicken Vegetable Paitan Ramen and Takoyaki (Octopus balls) as appetizer. Sort of a fusion menu. The Ramen noodles were thick and perfectly cooked. I loved the creamy chicken soup, fresh veggie toppings, Napa, Scallion, Bok Choy, Menma, baby spinach and fried Tofu in the Ramen. Takoyaki is made of fried wheat ball with Octopus topped with BBQ sauce, mayonnaise and fish flakes. In Ramen, the broth was tasty and not overly salty. Everything was delicious and satisfying. Food is killer, price points are perfect, nice atmosphere and great service.\\n\\nThey have areas where you can sit down at the table. I don't know if tatami or just mats. I never did it but you need 4 or more people to do that. A wide variety of broth and proteins in the Ramen, and several other non-Ramen types of food and appetizers available here. The bowl I ordered was bigger than I expected, and left full. Also took some to-go for my next day lunch. I highly recommend this place if you want a really genuine Japanese experience and next time I'm craving I'll go again.

They have several Greek beers as well as Greek wine which I have yet to try and sound very intriguing to me since I've never had Greek booze before. \\n\\nThe inside feels homey and the outside is massive with seating for days. Ordering takes place at the bar when you walk in. I found it difficult both times to order, due to the lady who runs the place has trouble with English, yet she appears to be tasked with order taking and operating the iPad. The people that work here appear to be family and it seems to be a jointly run business. The family is very nice and includes young girls and older men all working to keep this place running smooth. \\n\\nTip: Do not order their pizzas. I made the mistake of ordering a margherita pizza and it appeared to be a frozen cheese pizza with sliced tomatoes added to it. My friends I have met up here have both ordered food and seemed to enjoy their plates. Unfortunately, I found the food to be overpriced compared to other places around town serving up the same things for half the price. It would help to have some appetizers featured on the HH menu. I appreciate that they have a vegetarian \\"gyro\\" option, but I don't think the price is fair as it is the same price as a regular gyro with lamb, for $8.50. Unless they grew those veggies in their backyard. You can get a meaty gyro for under $5.00 elsewhere. This is a decent choice if you are in the area and want patio seating.

The good thing now is that you aren't forced to sit and wait, because they add your cell number to an online app where you can log in and check your wait number. So, if you have an errand to run, this could be a good time. \\n\\nOh but when we finally sat down, all was well. We ordered the fried wing dinner. I had collard greens and yams and my husband had fried green tomatoes and mac-n-cheese. All was REALLY good. Chicken and fried green tomatoes were seasoned and fried to perfection. \\n\\nWe plan to come back during the week next month to see if a different day makes a difference in the wait times. Stay tuned..."},{"name":"Cold Beer","address":"670 Dekalb Ave NE, Ste 101","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Super simple and stylish, eclectic design inside and outside. Very eye-pleasing. The staff is well trained and know the menu. They are not pushing anything on you, listening to your questions and go with your taste. \\nWe have ordered 2 cocktails (Spirit Driven Tiki and Paloma Stirred (super boozy! ask it on the rocks)) and 6 plates plus 2 deserts. The scallops were super salty but the sauce and the butternut squash is to die for. Btw, after we brought it to their attention the meal was removed from our bill, this is a high-standard restaurant move. The octopus was a surprise, it wasn't smashed in the fritters but rather had cut pieces that make the texture even better. The meat (pork belly/ribs) is so soft, it literally melts in your mouth. I'd go easy on the glaze saltiness too, but maybe it's just me. And deserts, Pavlova, and pudding were a cherry on top of all the deliciousness we ate. The best part of it is they both are not heavy and super sweet, very well balanced. Definitely coming back to try more cocktails and food.

The grits were creamy, and the perfect egg added more creamy richness to the grits. The pork belly was absolutely delicious; maple cut through the fattiness of the pork and creamy grits.

The noodle bowl ate really salty and for me missed that umami that one typically craves with a good noodle bowl. \\n\\nThe service was not normal Disney. All I'll say is the server could have paid closer attention to the table, greeted us sooner than 10 mins after being seated and listened to our orders to ensure we got what we asked for- all of which were problematic during our experience. \\nWith that said, the Bacon and Eggs are that good to come and eat here..just for them. \\n\\nJust the everyday father giving you his perspective...what you do with it is completely up to you.

Which may account for the blandness of the food. If they did some menu touch ups and purchased better quality meats this place may just make it.\\n\\nNever to be one to leave on a bad note I will say that their wine and beer list was very good. They serve their beer on tap and it was chilled to perfection. I may drop in for a hh and appetizers next time I'm in the area.

The pakoda was fried fresh which was nice. Vij personally comes to your table and talks to you which is nice.\\nWe got rabbit for starters and lamb in wine sauce and duck as mains. \\nFirst the rabbit starter/appetizer was basically just a mains dish, a  dish with masala eaten with Naan doesn't fall in the category of appetizer for me  but anyways other than the fact that they used rabbit instead of chicken( which tastes similar) it tasted just like some chicken that we would cook at home, nothing spectacular or amazing about it. \\n\\nFor main the dishes came with rice and naan which was great. I specially liked the lamb in wine , the curry had a nice combination of curd and spinach which tasted great and the lamb was cooked perfectly but I couldn't taste any wine. The Duck was cooked in a very subtle south Indian type curry with addition of mango. I personally didn't like the flavor of the duck curry as much but my husband liked it. Duck again was cooked perfectly.\\n\\nThe food was good but was it the best Indian food I have ever had in North America( not even counting India because you can't compare)? My answer would be a big NO. Was the food really innovative? Again NO.  Even by using ingredients like duck, rabbit , mango, wine, there was not much innovation to feel impressed.  It tasted just like any other mid ranged sit down Indian restaurant in North America.\\n \\nI would say the price range just felt too over the top for the food and even the ambiance (outdated bollywood songs from 90's and early 2000's, smell of Incense in the air, dark red/brown/yellow carpets and walls)didn't feel any different than the stereotypical Indian restaurant that we have been to in North America. \\nIf you are a non Indian maybe the food might taste great to you but as an Indian it was just average.  \\nOverall I just felt that it's both over hyped and over priced."},{"name":"Mesa Ranch","address":"8108 Mesa Dr, Ste C-100","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"The first time I ate here was with my Realtor.

I was not as impressed with the onion rings, since I prefer cornmeal or some other kind of batter with more texture, but the flavor was good.  The buffalo chicken salad was decent, and the celery added a nice crunch that was lacking in the crispness of the chicken.  The fries are great!

My bad was ordering the \\"pork chops\\" which came as three small cubes of what was apparently once known as a pork chop.

Yes, there are live seafood tanks with crab, lobster, and king crab, but instead, I ordered the special seafood combination congee with salted chinese doughnut on the side.  A good solid bowl of congee was soon delivered.   Some say that tofu is a vehicle for sauce.  Congee is a sauce that is a vehicle for other flavours.   Although it comes with some peanuts, green onions, and slivers of fresh ginger, I like to boost it a bit with liberal dollops of chilli oil, soy, and white pepper.   \\nThis is not fine dining, but is is good food.

It's basically an Ale House environment (but darker) with Sonny's food and a hint of edgy-ness, while still being corporate. At it's core, Smokey Bones serves decent BBQ. They have a large menu (and recently reinvented) with lots of options - some BBQ-centered and others more of the bar & grill variety. It's a really solid sports bar option with areas geared for more bar-friendly patrons and another dining area with less TV's and away from the potentially rowdy bar crowd. \\n\\nSmokey Bones also has REALLY good beer selection for a chain restaurant - and have always been fairly progressive in the craft beer scene (they were years ahead of the other big chains). I'm a big fan of the Half Cuban sandwich & New Brunswick stew combination, or sharing a platter of smoked wings (seriously crispy with a nice rub) and a BBQ combo platter (brisket and sausage probably being my preference). The roasted corn side with it's roasted corn and little bit of spice is a good choice - fries and coleslaw are average, but baked beans are BBQ-ey and another good side choice. The brisket and pulled pork aren't the best (and I don't know about the ribs - cause why?) but they are decent, and go well with their spicy sauce. They have a really good Carolina mustard-based sauce, too.\\n\\nThe service is usually decent - but if you don't mind, I'd definitely recommend sitting at the bar (it's pretty spacious, too) - as they have a really good crew of bartenders.

This place is a  solid 4 stars! I was a bit hesitant after reading Joshua's review, but it was recommended a few time by friends so we stopped by for lunch as a group of 7.\\n\\nThey seemed a bit flustered when we arrived since we were so many people, but they got through us at a surprisingly decent speed. I ordered the Vancouver Roll (real crab meat and avocado, salmon and tobiko on top) and the volcano roll (tuna and crab meat, deep fried with spicy sauce on top). \\n\\nOther items that were ordered was the New Mexico Roll (jalapeno peppers mixed into a sushi roll), black cod cheeks, awesome roll, lunch specials, cheese gyozas, chicken karaage. The food was all good but people said the New Mexico Roll wasn't as spicy as they were hoping for (even though the sign said super spicy, and the server said super spicy). I thoroughly enjoyed my two rolls, and the prices were decent as well.\\n\\nA good option to stop by for a lunch if you're around :) You can get here by taking the 14 or 16, or walking a bit form the 135.

It's a dark restaurant that's seen better days, but it doesn't lack atmosphere.  The service is a little hit or miss depending on who you get.  \\n\\nFor $10 you have access to the spicy, oily, flavorful buffet, soft & crisp naan brought to your table, and a fountain drink included; my only gripe, no brewed iced tea.  The buffet though is one of the most flavorful Indian buffets you'll find.  I love that meats are cooked in the sauce, instead of being added later for efficiency's sake, it really adds savoriness to the curries.  Braised goat and beef dishes are always tender, but this isn't one of the best buffets to bring a vegetarian to. The one standout vegetarian dish, the palak paneer, is memorable, well seasoned, completely blended spinach with a good balance of cilantro.  The paneer is a bit dry, but the sauce is worthy of cleaning off the plate.  The food here is reminiscent of eating at an Indian friend's house.  They also offer the rarer dinner buffet during the week.\\n\\nThey fancy themselves a dessert stop and make their own ice cream in house, with a focus on unique flavors, like lychee, mango, fig, and paan ice cream (betel leaves).  You can choose the flavors of ice cream in your falooda, which is a little pricier than what I'm use to, but every component was well prepared and that monster \\"drink\\" alone is a meal.  Worth a visit if you enjoy intense ethnic food, aren't afraid of a little dinginess, and love finding a great deal."},{"name":"Velvet Taco Domain","address":"11501 Rock Rose Ave, Ste 160","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"We decided to head on over to Velvet Taco for a late night bite to eat last night.

We were thankful there was good security and a quick food prep time. Could have used an extra cop at the front to help with the drunks ordering food.

Both the dumplings and the khachapuri were really flavorful. Good-sized servings. We took what we couldn't finish home.\\n\\nKargi Gogo serves flavorful, filling, stick-to-your-ribs food.

My preference is piping hot, especially when it comes to meat based foods; but it may just be a preference thing for me. The flavor of the burger itself was actually quite bland. \\n\\nThe salchipapas had much more potato than meat. The meat tasted fine but the potatoes are plain unseasoned boiled yellow potatoes. \\n\\nThe beef empanadas had a mushy beef mixture that was surprisingly, lacking flavor as well. I'm more accustomed to the kind of empanadas that are full of ground beef filled with flavorful fresh spices and herbs, not a potato like mixture with \\"some\\" meat. Not sure what's up with these. \\n\\nThe best thing I had was the cheese empanada which appeared to be hand-rolled and full of stretchy cheese that was best dipped in the Hawaiian sauce. \\n\\nWe also ordered the Oreo churros for dessert and they were decent but I was completely turned off by the fact that they must have been placed straight from the fryer into the styrofoam container they were in since the styrofoam beneath them had melted imprints of the little churro nuggets.

The scallion pancake is also wonderful but it's much heavier and is more of a savory treat. The paradise noodles have a ton of variety and are flavorful without being greasy like a lot of noodle dishes at other places.

After no joke, 5 minutes of standing right in thier faces I turned to my husband and said out loud, \\"Do you think they still know were standing here?\\" Nothing.

So I get paper towels. Is what it is. Get to the table, she drops the menus and walks away. Immediately I tell a manager. She was very nice and apologetic. Our server was very sweet and so kind but everything took so long. 20 minutes to get drinks, then another 15 for our bread. Then our appetizer came out cold. So we asked for a warm one. She says, it's on the house. I told her that wasnt necessary but she insisted. Wait another 40 minutes, food comes. My chicken was very good. His steak was so overcooked, dry and tough. He ordered medium well. So we ask for medium. It came raw. We didnt even care to say anything anymore. We just wanted to get the hell out. Then a server drops dirty dishes next to us, which I totally understand was an accident. I got ketchup all over my pants. Didnt even say anything to her as it wasnt intentional. Our bill comes, we were charged twice for the steak and the queso wasnt removed. So our meal for 2 was $100 and the biggest waste of time and money. You couldnt pay us to go back.

My issue is that I have been here a number of times, and almost consistently I receive poor service. Maybe I would better received if I spoke Spanish. But I think the problem is that a lot of the servers have the Orlando attitude that they are serving tourists, and repeat business isn't necessary. Well, I am a local and have frequented this restaurant often. Still poor service. Maybe leaving a party at their table, for long periods, not checking up on them, not refilling drinks, is an attempt to set some sort of dining ambiance. Doesn't work for me. Shame on you El Patron.

I split a double meat plate (pulled pork and pulled chicken) with a friend, which included 2 sides (we chose baked Mac n cheese and collards) and we added 2 large drinks, $27. For a walk-up counter order place, that is wayyyyy too expensive. \\n\\nThe pork was incredible! Nicely smoked. Very flavorful. The edges were black but not burnt.  The chicken was a waste of time. It tasted like it had been boiled in salt water. No smoke flavor of any kind. It was not pink, smoke colored. Just plain white, wet, salty. The baked Mac n cheese (recommended by the order taker, as opposed to the stove top option) was quite good. . Better than most, very cheddary. It used corkscrew pasta, rather than traditional elbow pasta. The collards were mighty tasty. Tender, cooked with pork. They do love the salt at this establishment, so be sure to take your blood pressure medicine.  The sweet tea was traditional southern sweet tea: fresh with equal parts water and sugar. I cut mine with the unsweet. \\n\\nWhat irked me the most I think, didn't have anything to do with the food. It was that for $27 (for ultimately one dish) i not only had to clear my own table, I had to bus it: put my tray in one stack, dump my plates, put them in another pile and put my silverware in a wash bucket. Recycle was yet another option (not sure what would be recyclable here? Bottles? Used paper napkins? Leftover food for homeless animals?)\\n\\nSo, if you have lots of money to spend on over priced bbq, get the pork and you won't be disappointed."},{"name":"El primo-La Casa De Las Alcapurrias","address":"1618 Pleasant Hill Rd","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"4","text":"This is a fire place , food is fresh n by the long line it's worth it, everything on menu is great whenever I'm in town I hit this spot up... was driving by n seen the long line had to try it out and wasn't disappointed.."},{"name":"El Patron Mexican Restaurant & Cantina","address":"12167 S Apopka Vineland Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Nice ambience.

He mentions the prices on the box don't mean anything necessarily (when buying more than one item), and has to go check the computer to figure out what things cost.

Anyways, as we sat, somebody who I believe at the end  was our server, approached to our table, pour water into our glasses, no eye contact, said nothing but  \\"let me know if you have a question\\" and walked a way, hmm ok. I had a question, but he was gone. My wife and I were just laughing at the service quality for the first impression. I was expecting more for a restaurant that carries that name and it's location with good interior feature dinning set up. YOU WILL GET A BETTER SERVICE FROM HOSPITALITY AT ANY FAST FOOD RESTAURANT OR PIZZA CORNER, than this so called \\"Tuscan Kitchen\\" \\n\\nSo the server came back, and ask us the same question, this time making a second time frame eye contact. As I look at my wife and as her and I understand our thinking we conclude in a \\"yes that's our server.\\"  At that point we are hungry, let's get into business, who cares about the service at that point. \\n\\n After the appetizer we order ravioli and it was nothing I expected of 5 peace's for $35 of bad smelling and testing food.

My fig panini was probably the best thing that could be had (other than dessert, which we didn't try) at Jennifer Lee's, given how much better it was than my husband's tofu and bean sausage bagel sandwich.  My panini was edible, but not really good because the bread wasn't good.  Gluten free bread is hard to get right;  I would suggest that any restauranteur who isn't 100% confident that they have something really special stick with non-bread options such as lettuce wraps, polenta, or rice noodles.  I have seen gf tortillas done well, but I don't think Jennifer Lee could manage them, so I won't suggest it.\\n\\nMy poor husband's bagel sandwich:\\n\\nPerhaps the poor quality of the bagel was to be expected, but gluten would not have been needed to season and prepare the tofu well.  Further, the bean sausage was terrible and flavorless.

Our seven year old said she'd rather have noodles than any of the Jennifer Lee menu items, so we got her a rice noodle and tofu dish from Bon Me (the very next stall).  The choices at Bon Me are clearly marked for veganness and gluten content, and the tofu is well prepared.

Yours was rude and childish, and I believe it only stands to blemish the reputation of your family's business.

However, there are a number of reviews so similar to mine, which upset you so, that deserve more consideration than to send a rude and misplaced comment directly to us Yelpers. For example, if so many of us are complaining that the bubble tea is not quite right, then maybe there's something to our comments and it could be improved.\\n\\nYelpers aren't about trashing hard-working business owners just because they had a bad experience, but we do have this nice open forum where we can be totally honest on how we felt. As a business owner, you may read some disappointing things, but our honest feedback is what helps many owners know what their diners and customers are experiencing and where they can improve. It is my sincere hope, for the sake of the Yelp community, that your recent behavior will be the last of it and that you will take our reviews with a grain of salt but with a hearty sense constructive criticism. After all, whether leaving 1 star or 5, each of us eagerly entered Patty Chen's hoping to find what we were looking for.

The owner stopped by to check with us; and, she was very gracious, telling us about the plans for the restaurant; and, the work they were doing to get the place up and running (it's been a long build-out!)\\n\\nFor mains, I had the Bacalhau (salt cod), which was tender, flakey and delicious. My wife had the Sea Bass, which sh very much enjoyed.  To go with our mains, we each had a glass of a California Pinot Gris, which Nicolas had suggested; and, his suggestion was spot-on!\\n\\nI paid by credit card, using the tablet that Nicolas provided, adding in a nearly 25% tip for outstanding service.  We had a great meal; and, we were disappointed that there were only a few other patrons; but, it was Tuesday night right after Thanksgiving, so all of the venues were slow that night.

Both were served with a tiny biscotti type of pastry. Hot and perfect!!!! Not just the waiters. Fresh water was constantly being refilled in the glass water bottle. It was much more than just a bottle!!! We both had the Burger Maison Frites with a glass of red wine. I do not usually eat much meat, but I would definitly have this again!!! The bun was soft, the burger was so tender with caramelized onions and a tangy sauce that went well with the burger. The fries  had a slightly crunchy exterior and  were light and fluffly on the inside. With ketchup  or mayonnaise for dipping. A salad accompanied this meal, an assortment of crisp greens with a light dressing. I asked the waiter what wine he recommended to go with our meal and the wine he chose complimented the meal so well.  We also shared a desert that was a type  of hazelnut mousse with rasperry sauce drizzled on the side. Also one more cup of Americano each. The portions were not huge, but this was brunch and my first and last meal of the day.  I am still comfortably satisfied.  The waiters had delightful French accents I could have listened to all day.  They brought the food and drinks in good time and did not hover around but we did not feel neglected.  I will return often!!!! I wish I had taken pictures but  the experience was so extremely awesome, that I forgot. Also the restaurant is clean and cozy and of course you feel like you are in France on a holiday. The bathroom sink and soap container are original and fascinating, but you have to go to see it for yourself."},{"name":"Pisces Rising","address":"239 W 4th Ave","city":"Mount Dora","stars":"3.5","text":"Just a risky choice when it comes to a good value - food not memorable at all for price.

Don't forget to add one to your order, if shakes are your thing.\\n\\nExcited to try more of their menu."},{"name":"Chipotle Mexican Grill","address":"1726 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"2.5","text":"I figure that the service times at this Chipotle location comes down to some type of mathmatical equation based on the number of employees behind the counter and the number of customers. From my historical observations, the more employees working the slower the service and the longer the line the less of a priority the customers become. \\n\\nToday my previous observations proved true as I counted at least eight employees and 12 people in line ahead of me. It took 27 minutes from the time I walked in their door til the time I paid for my order and walked away. Two minutes and fifteen seconds an order may not be bad but it is far from great. Fast casual this was not, nor were my last 15-20 stops at this location.\\n\\nI think a large part of their delays in service for customers in line are the orders that are being made online. If Chipotle wants to serve the internet that is fine, but they should have a second line to make the orders as the make a customer then make two internet orders is very inefficient and insulting to the customers waiting in line. If you are going to keep people standing in line waiting, an apology by the tortilla/bowl person and by the cashier would go a long way in making people feel appreciated as a customer.\\n\\nThe store was generally clean though I would attribute that more to the customers bussing their own tables and throwing away their own trash than the employees getting paid to do so. In the half hour I was there, I did not witness a Chipotle employee leave the confines of their kitchen or their prep area.\\n\\nThe positives to this trip and location is the food generally hot and fresh tasting. They tend to give you nice size portions and I have yet to see them put a meat or a vegetable in my bowl and then take some out and throw it back in their bin as I have had done to me at numerous other locations. (Yes I notice when the Bexley and Clintonville Chipotles take carnita meat off my bowl)\\n\\nAnother positive is that while I feel their employees are slightly aloof and slower than they should be, they are friendly, they greet you, and they do remember to say thank you despite forgetting the speedy service part of their job.\\n\\nI won't tell you not to go to this Chipotle, but I will warn you that this is not the location to get in and out of fast. If they have a line, think about coming back at another time, trying a different location, or going somewhere else if you are short on time. If you are with friends and you don't mind the wait, this is a good place to go."},{"name":"Pisces Rising","address":"239 W 4th Ave","city":"Mount Dora","stars":"3.5","text":"Been here for several years and have enjoyed it every time we have been.

Being born and raised here, I can feel the draw and urge to stand in line for an hour to get in. Come early unless you want to stand half way down the block praying you'll get in before midnight when Cinderella would be rushing home before her belongings transforms back. Pray that the people in the line in front of you are less persistent and will give up and go home. \\n\\nI love the space! There's a Photo Booth for the coveted social media perfect definition of a good night picture with your friends so your followers can eat their hearts out. It's a chill place with a larger dance floor than other bars. Blecher style setting which is wonderful because you're not going to find a place with seats in Portland clubs unless you're willing to fork out a few hundred. With that price, I much rather fly out somewhere. The deck/roof top is a chill area to overlook the city that is slowly being blocked off by high rise apartments. There's also a good view of the line that you narrowly missed if you came early and are fortunate to make it in. I enjoy the outdoor seating with the fire pit as well. Other places in Portland, you step out because it's sweltering hot and you have to wait to get back inside when you're done. \\n\\nThey serve food and they aren't trying to hide it! I've been to numerous places and had no idea that food was an option. They aren't hesitant to shuffle out menus. I've only visited this establishment at night so food isn't exactly the main focus.. food isn't even why people come in at the hours I go.\\n\\nDownside to this place is that I am 100% guaranteed to wake up feeling like a semi truck has hit me. I thought this was a fluke but the last time I came, I had two drinks and woke up feeling miserable as ever. I have never had a chance to claim a singular place with this ability to do so, but Century takes the cake. Note to self and anyone reading this, specify what brand you want. Not sure what level moonshine they are forking out but it will hit you very hard the next morning.\\n\\nDrinks are not consistent. My friends and I had ordered the same thing, but it looked significantly different. Mine was clear in a short glass with old tasting discolored limes, and had a prominent presence of vodka. While theirs came in a tall glass and looked like a blended lemonade and tasted like something you could dangerously drink 5 of and not be conscious of how much you're taking in. I do not like to send anything back or make anyone remake something and so I stuck with my sad drink. Plus, it's a long wait for the bartender to come back around in my direction. There were about 5 bartenders working the 2 bars and that hardly seemed like enough. My friends were standing around waiting to order for a good 10 minutes. \\n\\nMoral of the story is, come early!"},{"name":"Rimsky-Korsakoffee House","address":"707 SE 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I used to come here all the time but I hadn't been in a while, and it's always been okay the past but I won't be back after last time.

Living in the area, we are always up for trying new dining establishments.\\n\\nAs such, We walked in the door, stood around for 5 minutes before being seated (no waiting space), there were 5 tables available, and could have easily been escorted to a seat upon entry. Once seated, we were not handed menus, we were not offered refreshments, or even brought water. My roommate and I sat in our little booth talking for about 20 minutes, staring at the employees congregated at the bar. When we finally said, enough is enough. We set a cell phone timer, waited 5 minutes, still with no reaction from the staff on hand, and decided to leave. Once I started to leave, I was finally approached by one of the employees, who requested we sit down, and started to apologize. I merely stated that they appeared too busy, and that I had other plans for the night, and walked out. However, I did promise that I would be back, some time after they were possibly more established.\\n\\nDuring that time, we had struck up a conversation with another table in the establishment, they had been there for an hour and half and still had not received food, they had however been handed bread, salads, and at least been served with alcohol.

It all looks very intentional and well-thought-out; there's even a lovely sitting area outside with a modern-looking canopy surrounded by several strategically-placed planters.\\n\\nThe selection wasn't huge at 9:15ish a.m., but I managed to snag two kinds of croissants (almond and butter - which one of the co-owners, Dan, assured me were \\"the best you can get outside of Paris\\") and two varieties of brioche (sausage and chocolate). Eight pastries set me back less than $20 before gratuity.\\n\\nHungry vultures were waiting at my office, so I only managed to try the almond croissant and the chocolate brioche. Both were absolutely outstanding.\\n\\nI tasted the almond croissant first. At first bite, I had one of those moments of being transported to another plane by sheer virtue of the deliciousness exploding in my mouth. I literally had to close my eyes to block out other stimulus so I could properly savor it. The exterior was laden with slivered almonds and had the crispy texture of pastry that is coated with just a hint of carmelized sugar...the interior was buttery-moist and fragrant with the scent of almond extract. Pure heaven. I had every intention of just tasting a small bite, but I kept going back in the kitchen to cut off additional chunks.\\n\\nI had purchased three of the almond croissants, so I was sorely tempted to keep cutting off bites of those and pass on the chocolate brioche altogether. It couldn't possibly be as good. But I finally relented and took a bite - you know, for science.\\n\\nAnd whoa. I don't know what kind of chocolate they put in these, but it is fantastic - very intense and totally deserving of eating plain, which I don't say lightly. Chocolate is a very serious matter.\\n\\nLa Bo√Æte also offers a small selection of sandwiches at lunch, which I need to go back and try as soon as humanly possible.

I don't know tons about wines, but after talking over my likes/dislikes with our waiter, he recommended a wine I'd never heard of, allowed me to sample it before ordering a glass, and his recommendation was spot-on.

The asparagus though was to-die-for.  Another person in our party ordered their brussel sprouts as a side, and that was probably even better than the asparagus.  But the unsung hero of the meal was the bread and butter.  There were two butters - one was a champagne brie butter and the other was a spicy cheddar.  I would go back just for the butter.

If you want to know the secret to their success, look no further than the servers' shirts, which proudly (and accurately) read: \\"the South on a plate.\\" \\n\\nFor those of us who are born and bred Southerners, this place tastes like home. And for others, it's edible Southern hospitality...generous, sweet & comforting. \\n\\nBusy Bee is a modest little place dating back 40+ years. It's MLK location is rough around the edges & not much in the name of ambiance. People are packed in like sardines - think airplane seating in a restaurant! But, despite its small size in both the kitchen & dining room, this place runs like a well-oiled machine. The servers have squeezing past each other through impossibly narrow corridors down to a science (with hot plates and beverages in hand no less)! \\n\\nDue to its small size (and popularity), waiting is almost inevitable. The whole place may seat 40 people, so get comfortable with being in close quarters! I tried to come during a 'downtime' & quickly learned there's no such thing here. There's even a wait to wait (seated inside v. standing outside). To help manage the crowd, a friendly gentleman greets guests and facilitates turning tables. He keeps his eyes on seats like a hawk, looking to fill newly empty seats with waiting guests... \\n\\nI agreed to first available seating which led me to a seat at the bar (after a ~20 min. wait). At the bar, I got a front row seat to all the action and fast service. And after being called honey and sugar by my friendly server, I really felt like I was in my grandmother's kitchen! They welcome regulars and newbies alike and are genuinely friendly. \\n\\nAs for the food, the dishes served are tried and true Southern staples. I had the fried catfish, with my choice of 2 sides - squash & cabbage. I added a 3rd side because I had to try the carrot souffl√© - you don't see it on many menus!! \\n\\nMy food was out within 10 minutes & I couldn't wait to dig in! I could tell just by looking I'd need a to go box before long - I had 2 generous filets of catfish, 3 sides & a dinner roll. The catfish was well-seasoned & crispy and the veggies tasted just like my aunt's. And the carrot souffl√© was to die for!! If you've never had it, do yourself a favor & try it. It doesn't taste like carrots at all - it's more like a sweet potato souffl√©. Divine!!  \\n\\nFor newcomers, I'd recommend bringing a few things for a good experience...your patience, manners, and of course your appetite! After traversing MLK to find a parking space and surviving the wait, you'll be hungry! \\n\\nAnd a word to the wise...read the menu before you're seated so you're ready to order immediately & don't linger after you eat (unless you want to feel the burning glare of hungry guests in waiting)!

I hate me too. \\n\\nTo my knowledge, it's a new outpost that's received plenty of fanfare since opening its doors downtown just a few weeks ago. It's a swanky joint that serves up some quality mixed cocktails (insert an obligatory \\"but not as good as San Francisco\\" reference here) and they've got a fine wine list. Personally, I stuck to gin pretty much the entire week, and they had a pretty solid selection of distilled juniper berry drinks on hand. \\n\\nFood-wise, we had a group of 6 at the table, so there was a lot of mixing and matching going on (which is my favourite way to dine!). The FOS (French onion soup) was on point, but I couldn't help but wonder how they refer to the dish in France. Do they just call it \\"onion soup?\\" What about French bread? Is it just \\"bread?\\" Life's little mysteries. I digress.... We also sampled the tuna ni√ßoise with fingerlings, egg, tomato, haricots verts, olives, lemon & olive oil. It made for a pretty pleasant way to start off an evening of fine Canadian nosh. While others around the table opted for plates laced with fatty meats, I chose the lighter route with a dish of mussels & fries with white wine, lemon, and butter. The mussels were as big as Apollo Ohno's hamstrings, and they tasted as though they'd just been plucked from the waters of the Pacific Ocean. Good stuff!\\n\\nAs for desert, I made sure to dive into the sticky toffee pudding. That might have been the highlight of the entire night. Nothing like ingesting hundreds of additional calories after a big meal, but this baby was so good, it left little room for guilt and remorse.\\n\\nFor Vancouverites, I have to imagine this will end up being a total scene.

But it is good \\"bad\\" food --spicy, beefy, cheesy -- an utterly messy, sloppy calorie bomb and yet worth it.

I felt like I finally found my bar. \\n\\nA year went by and I went back, and oh boy...it was night and day. \\n\\nThey were having some type of bingo night that was a little confusing because me and my friends didn't know where to sit...and you would think someone would be there to say something being that it was an event night but I guess not...we looked around and couldn't find a table so we sat at the bar. Bartender had a major attitude and acted like we metaphorically spit in his mouth when we asked for drinks. Didn't think much of it until a table opened up. My friend went back up to the bar to get and pay for our drinks when the bartender pointed to a chick and said \\"that's your server\\" and walked away when he went back up there. (He didn't even put the drink order in and we were gonna give him a tip anyways) \\n\\nNow let's get to our waitress which is the reason why I'm writing this review. Girl was SMACKED I mean LIT GONE! She was slurring her words, she couldn't focus on us when she was staring at us, and was really sweaty. And not the sweaty like she had been working...it made the whole table uncomfortable. I guess she realized this because she avoided our table at ALL costs. To the point where she was walking in the direction of our table and when we all looked up, blatantly turned around and started talking to another table at which we realized we're her friends. Someone from our table literally had to get up from the table and tap her on the shoulder. She then decides to tell him that the pitcher of beer we ordered almost an hour ago will not be coming because they were out of pitchers. \\n\\n.....you didn't want to tell us that? So essentially we were waiting for nothing. And she didn't ask if we wanted either individual beers or drinks, WE had to ask HER. We saw her get to the register and just stare at the screen. someone from the kitchen had to help her and eventually give us our drinks. \\n\\nWe downed our drinks like shots and asked for the check. We had to YELL at her to get her to come over to get OUR MONEY! The table beside us started clapping because apparently them and another table couldn't get her attention either.  Then the weird part...while we were getting ready to go she sat there staring blankly at us. It was clear she was not JUST drunk. \\n\\nJacks fell off entirely. It was my favorite place and now it's just awful. I don't know if it's new management or needs new management but they need to get it together."},{"name":"Velvet Taco Domain","address":"11501 Rock Rose Ave, Ste 160","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"This place gives me life.Thankful they stay open late.

Ordered an eel Bento box, which came with a variety of dumplings, edamame, vegetable Maki, miso soup, and a generous amount of eel on a bed of rice.  The eel pieces were very large and thick, with no bones intact. Very flavourful with the sauce and furikake on top of the eel.\\n\\nWould definitely go again to try their other options including specialty rolls and rice dishes. They even have Pok√© as well!"},{"name":"Oppa Sushi","address":"185 Harvard Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Yelp why did you lead me astray? \\n\\nI should have known after I spent four years at BU and never visited. The sushi was ok but not great. I'd rather go to one of the many other options around. We ordered the sushi deluxe which came with 10 pieces of nigiri, spicy salmon maki, and spicy salmon hand roll. The nigiri had way too much wasabi in it. You could spot the green through the fish! This was the fake wasabi that you find at typical sushi restaurants. Too much and you burn your face off. We also got the scallop yaki which was served in a mini cast iron and smothered in mozzarella cheese. There were small pieces of baby scallops, lots of onion and mayo. It was also sitting in a bed of grease. Overall the sushi is ok but not good enough to make me return."},{"name":"Tin Shed Garden Cafe","address":"1438 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"One of my favorite places in Portland. The best part is of course, that dogs are allowed which they should be everywhere. Our corgi had a lovely time, and we were able to order him chicken and sweet potato off the doggy menu, they even have dog dessert. The waiting time is long, I wish they took reservations, so allow an hour of waiting during a busy time. Still worth it though. Great food, deliciously cooked and decent portions and pricing. Burgers are some of the best I've had, along with their hot sauce.

The steaks were cooked to perfection (mine had a bit more pepper than I prefer, but that is personal preference). At the end of the meal, Jason went above and beyond and presented my husband with a dessert with \\"Happy Birthday\\" written in chocolate. The Lava Cake was divine! I don't have a single negative thing to say about our experience at Fleming's, and I'm sure we will be back for the next special occasion we have to celebrate. I'd give more stars if I was able.

I started with a delicious dark beer after picking the bartender's brain and waited to order food after they opened and my husband could meet up with me. I had another beer and the most amazing chicken and waffles from their brunch menu. Everything was so good that we returned for more beer here on our last night in Vancouver.

My husband had the fish sandwich it was a nice portion fish sandwich. Then we had the pretty and tasty orange  cake. The other family members had fish bowls and a poor boy and fries. Everyone was happy with what they ordered. The staff was nice and friendly even offered us refill to go drinks . The atmosphere is nicely decorated with a fish theme .

I ordered  a thin crust pizza,  meatballs, golden wings with fries (they charge a bit more to sub fries for potato chips).  The place was not busy so I was surprised how long it took and that the entire order was ready about 20 min before the pizza. Everything was in the warmer so the fries got sweaty & soggy,  the wings were dried out & the meatballs looked ok. A plus is the cashier offered to remake the fries, at that point who wants to wait for fries when the pizza just came out??  Then I get home & the thin crust pizza is burned & has soooooo much cheese that you can't taste the toppings. We tried eating from the middle bc the outside was so burned it had that bitter taste but with so much cheese the middle was super soggy and they did not put the spinach that I ordered. In Phoenix I never had a soggy pizza.  I was so disappointed and all of this cost over $50!!  I know they haven't been open very long and may need to work out how to get the food out minutes apart & how to cook thin crust without burning it!  A plus is that  everyone was friendly."},{"name":"Jac's Cafe","address":"29 Crest Ave","city":"Winthrop","stars":"4.5","text":"Pretty good.
