For me, this was enough to at least have my interest piqued about the city. \\n\\nThe spiel is simple for this place. They have around 600 different games onsite, and each staff member is individually able to teach between 100 and 300 different games. You pay a $5 fee to access the game library (for as long as you want). There's beer, wine, and mead available onsite, along with various gourmet snack foods that are all from the central Ohio region (Krema Nuts, shagbark chips, locally made hummus), and gourmet sodas.\\n\\nThe space itself is nice and open, and the addition of some sound dampeners a while back cut down on the roar that Kingmakers sometimes gets when it's packed. And yes, this joint can be jumping. I'm still happy to go in Fridays and Saturdays, but with the knowledge that I could be standing at the bar drinking a beer while I wait to get a table. That's not a terrible fate by any means, but just keep in mind the fact that this particular board game establishment is popular.\\n\\nWhy do I like Kingmakers, apart from what I've just mentioned? This place actually caters to everyone, and they do so well. Growing up as a nerdy boy, I spent the better part of my adolescence in game shops. And while I have a great deal of nostalgia for those places, they can be extraordinarily uninviting to somebody who doesn't already know a lot about games. It's a real bind when you're trying to trying get new friends to try out your hobby, because the venue might drive them away before they realize they actually like games. \\n\\nBy contrast, Kingmakers is inviting. The food is all good, the beers are all quality microbrews but still very fairly priced, the staff members are all friendly, and the games aren't necessarily impossible to get into. See, boardgames vary wildly in complexity, and while the games I like tend to be on the heavier (2-4 hours of gameplay side), those aren't fun for everybody. Nor are they fun all the time; sometimes, you don't want to sink three hours and a lot of brain power into one game. Kingmakers has a good spread of everything: a few two-player games, a few two-to-four player games, some cooperative games, some party games...\\n\\nGiven how big boardgaming is in Columbus, this place is set up to be an institution."},{"name":"Red Bud Restaurant","address":"120-8360 Granville Avenue","city":"Richmond","stars":"3.5","text":"The entrance is slightly hidden and looks like you're entering the restaurant from the wrong back-door.

The seats are giant comfy couches, and you can drink beer & eat pizza while you watch. The screen is a decent size, and the sound is good. \\n- Being able to take your drinks from one bar to the next, Vegas style. Traveling the halls with drinks is a fine way to travel.  \\n- Being able to charge everything you ordered to your room number. \\n- Transportation: there's a bus line that stops right outside the door and goes into the city. \\n- Privacy: the rooms were pretty well secluded in their own little sectioned hallways. We heard people sometimes, but only because they were outside the window, not in the hall. \\n- Each room has its own bathroom - I know this is standard, but at some of the McMeniman's resorts, you gotta share, which I am not really down with. \\n- The INSANELY acid-trippy wall art. I mean, there are no words. We had a fine time trying to interpret each piece. \\n- The Honors Bar: the only place in The Kennedy School we were ever warm, thanks to the wood stove and the small size, and the only place we ever had yummy drinks, thanks to the awesome chick behind the bar. \\n- The Abiding Dude: McMeniman's Coffee Liqueur + Vanilla Stoli + a bit of cream = heaven. (Just do not order it from The Boiler Room, because you'll get what amounts to very watery skim milk - see below). \\n- Terminator Stout= YUM. 'nuff said \\n\\nCons: \\n- The beds. For the price you're paying, the beds aren't all that lush, the sheets are kind of scratchy, and the blankets are super thin. Ditto on the flat not-enough-pillow situation. \\n- Because this is a school, the windows are HUGE and definitely very drafty, which meant that during cold temps (it was a max. of 22 during our stay), the whole place is freezing. Our friends have to have maintenance come in frequently to fix the heat, and they couldn't sleep at all the first night because it was too cold.  \\n- No TV in the rooms. I know, this isn't really a con because the idea is to spend time with your honey/friends/whatevs - BUT I do like to turn on the tube in the AM or while drifting off to sleep, so it's good to have one. \\n- There are 5 bars/restaurants, but there's not a whole lot of variety. Each place serves the same food and drinks, and none of it is really that fantastic. Basic bar food with some ok specials, but not as great as it should be, again, due to the price.\\n- The Boiler Room: if you feel you must go in, do so. Look around at all the stuff, or bring in a drink from another bar and play shuffleboard or pool. Just DO NOT TRY TO ORDER ANYTHING HERE. It's douchebag central, the service is zilch, and all our drinks and food were sucktastic. \\n- The bread pudding: when I saw it on the menu, I was excited because it sounded awesome. When I got it, it was basically a piece of french toast with slightly vanilla-esque syrup and some raisins scattered around on the plate. So not cool, you guys. \\n- It makes sense to allow people not staying in the rooms in the bars and restaurants so they can you know, make money. But my god I got tired of bumping into 10 million people with screaming kids and obnoxious attitudes in the halls. (see Disneyland comment above) \\n\\nOverall I had fun, I just think for the price ($125 per night), it's not really worth it. That said, I'd be more inclined to come back if it was cheaper and the food was tastier."},{"name":"Laurelthirst Public House","address":"2958 NE Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Hadn't been here in almost a year until last week.

I am Russian (you could even say comparatively \\"fresh off the boat\\" I guess :) ) so I speak from experience. We went there for a friend's birthday party (so it was a banquet-style meal) and I have to say I was not very impressed. The vodkas were good (the have several infused varieties which are nice) but again, if you are a Russian restaurant and your vodkas aren't good you shouldn't be in the business.  \\nAs for the food it was just meh... The \\"winter salad\\", which is a staple of any celebration was disappointing (which is a major faux pas in my book), the cold appetizers were ok but nothing to write home about (same for the hot appetizers), the meat was overcooked and dry and aside from the obligatory \\"blini\\" (blintzes) the flavors (at least the food that we had) weren't particularly \\"Russian\\" to tell you the truth. I guess they have to adjust to fit the American palate and I realize that I probably sound like a raging purist but my guess is that most people who go to a Russian restaurant want true Russian flavors, not their distant and fully assimilated American cousins...\\nMy advice: if you want to try real Russian food go to Bazaar International Gourmet. It's not a restaurant, so the experience is def. not the same. They do have range of ethnic foods (e.g. in addition to the Russian fare they also have some Armenian, Georgian etc. dishes) but I've always found their versions of the \\"Russian classics\\" (e.g. borsht, blini, draniki, golubtzi, russian salad) to be very good and truly authentic."},{"name":"Folk Art Restaurant","address":"465 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Very small and cozy atmosphere, gives you a very homely feeling.

Mushroom and Sausage was good, but the Ricotta one is where it's at. Lumps of ricotta cheese baked on top of more cheese, but surprisingly not overwhelming at all. The sausage was sliced like pepperoni (not like lumps of sausage), and it wasn't heavily greasy or anything.

In fact, it was so loud I kept turning around to see if they'd notice but they were also loud with each other. It was really annoying. \\n\\nWhen my fiance got her bowl, she noticed that it wasn't what she had ordered. She wanted a Pho with just steak, instead she got everything including tripe, which she's not too fond of. She initially picked out these meats but couldn't stomach (no pun intended) the bowl in front of her, so when we asked our server (hoping he'd apologize and give her a new bowl), he blankly stared at us as if to say, \\"what would you like me to do about it.\\" After this awkward moment, we said forget it and she tried her best to eat around it. Needless to say, she did not finish her bowl. \\n\\nWe also ordered fried spring rolls and golden tofu. Fried spring rolls were so over fried it was dark and falling apart. The golden tofu wasn't too bad.

Did i mention it was bottomless??? Is it really brunch if they don't offer bottomless? It's more like just late lunch. So glad I found this hidden gem. It's so sad that I can count on one hand how many restaurants offer bottomless mimosas (man-mosas) if you're into that, in Columbus. \\n\\nKinda sucks that they only do brunch on Sunday... would be awesome if I could brunch there on Saturday & Sunday. But I won't be ungrateful, seriously appreciate that they offer Brunch with the bottomless option. It's $20 but worth it. The mimosas aren't pre-made, love hearing the sound of bottle pop ;) and the champagne to oj ratio is perfect. I was very skeptical about checking it out, couldn't find a brunch menu online. But they offer a variety of options. I throughly enjoyed the chicken & waffles... if you've ever been to Sage bistro (now closed) the chicken & waffle is almost on par with that delicious menu item they once offered. I ordered a side of the maple bacon mac & cheese (normally during dinner the mac & cheese is actually on the chicken & waffle) I wasn't sure if I'd enjoy that all touching, so I ordered it on the side. So good!!! \\n\\n\\nMy friend had the steak & eggs and subsided the breakfast potatoes for the truffle fries. The steak was pretty big compared to most places. And it was delicious.

It's trendy to bash Voodoo these days, and yes, hype tends to sour most things.  But in my opinion they make exactly what I want in a donut.  If you want something more nostalgic and simple, go to Annie's (which is awesome).  If you want something more upscale go to Blue Star (which is not that good IMO).

It was delicious, the meatballs fried before me, placed atop a svelte bun. Runny cheese sauce covered the meatballs, and only enhanced their flavor. On the side were served pickled beets and other pickled delights in addition to a nice lingonberry jam (made from Swedish lingonberries). I used both as sandwich toppings, and, though the menagerie of pickled veggies seemed to fall off, the lingonberries really complemented the savory nature of the meatballs and their cheese sauce. A word of warning: this is a messy sandwich. The cheese [i]will[/i] run off the back of the sandwich and all over the artistically composed serving board. The meatballs are guaranteed to fall off the sandwich, so, in the end, it really requires some sort of utensil.\\n\\nOn the side, I had the onion soup, which, like the meatballs, was tasteful and filling. According to our hipster of a waiter (who liked my watch), it was comprised of five different varieties of onion.

We got the takoyaki and it's definitely recommended! It's the best I've had in Atlanta and is comparable to some Japanese restaurant in Japan. But, I'm not sure if it is freshly made since it did taste like it was reheated for serving. For ramen dishes, I got their signature spicy chicken ramen and it was a little bit too salty for me and not spicy enough despite the fact that I chose hot in its spice option. My boyfriend got the spicy umami miso ramen and I thought that the broth was well made and the noodles were thick and good. I definitely recommend that. The portions are large and very filling.

Living down south (9 miles from Mexico), we only have taco trucks, which we are quite skeptical of since I don't see that they have running water or dogs around, so this was our first experience with reputable food trucks. I actually don't know where we were but there were a number of food truck choices, altho some were closed due to the late hour.  We first ate a fabulous pulled pork sandwich on grilled bread from Soul Food (I think), then my husband had a chocolate ice cream sandwich (sandwich was fresh made cookies) & then Kelly went to Via 313 for pizza.  Obviously she has been there before because the owner delivered the pizza across the street himself.  Really nice guy & absolutely indescribable pizza.  Who knew Detroit had it's own pizza???  Of course everyone knows of New York pizza & Chicago pizza (my former favorite) but Detroit?  Ithought they only made cars!!

The price was a little steep for lunch, but in my opinion worth it.

Especially seeing as (given ill planning on my calendar), I tried Frank twice in one day (breakfast and lunch) and both times left something to be desired and eyebrows raised to a pretty reasonable degree.\\n\\nFrank has evolved into an downtown Austin landmark, with a unique menu combining barbecue comfort food (mainly hotdogs) with a mish mash of interesting multi-flavor profile and cultural fixins. A melding of comfort food puncuated with southern tummy filling fare. \\n\\nEnter us on our first trip to Frank, 9:30AM, only party in the restaurant. Service was polite...however our \\"clean\\" plates had ketchup all over them and when we brought it up to the server, it was taken as not really a big deal. Eyebrow raises and shoulder shrugs as we were tired, however, still pretty gross nonetheless. Having promised my departing intern a lunch at Frank, we ventured back across town for round 2, only to wait 35 minutes after being told 10-15 minute wait and when we sat down to eat (a bit pressed for time at this point), we were told not to expect quick service as they were \\"at capacity\\", despite having 3-4 tables available around us.\\n\\nIf what matters is simply the food/drink and nothing more, Frank's great and is securely nestled in 4-starhood...vegetarian options are actually as flavorful as their meaty counterparts, menu is clever, bar is stocked to the brim with whatever you could imagine.

I just wanna give a quick breakdown of my 4 star rating... (I will be doing this from now on). 4.5 for service, 5 for food quality, 4 for atmosphere, 4.5 for cleanliness -- so 4.5, which I will round down to 4 (sorry, but I'm not a fan of rounding up to a perfect score!) I was very pleased with everything, and want to say if the food quality is consistent then this is my new favorite Pho place downtown.\\n\\nI'll start with atmosphere -- the interior looks minimal/industrial-commercial -- white walls with grey wood-styled panelling in the dining area. There's one large booth against the wall, and the rest of the seating are simple wood chairs that have a southeast Asian feel, or design. Wood-style two-top tables that are pushed together in certain spots to make four-tops. The front area has high top  seating in front of windows that open up to the street, as is the normal style throughout the west end. There are black and white photos on the walls -- the one I looked at seemed to be the Vietnamese countryside. The kitchen/food prep area is in between the dining area and window seating, and surrounded by fogged glass. I think they could actually benefit by replacing the fogged glass with transparent glass, or getting rid of the glass altogether. It kind of slices the restaurant in two in a way that I think is unnecessary. I noticed the servers had to stand on their toes to direct me to the main dining area, and the heads popping over the glass kind of makes me think of a weird puppet show. Other than that, I think they've made a pretty good use of their space, with tasteful interior and decorations.\\n\\nService is great and timely. Quite a breath of fresh air in a city where it seems like most places have average to terrible service. When I walked in I found the layout a bit confusing, but the service staff immediately directed me to the dining area. My server was attentive. She dropped off water and a menu immediately, as I notice she did with other walk-ins, and always refilled glasses that were half full, on all tables. When I put my menu down the server immediately took notice and I placed my order. I didn't have to wait long for my food, the other server (or food runner/gsa... I wasn't 100% sure), brought the food out within minutes. Something I have to say that's really great about the timeliness is that I don't wanna sit around wasting a minute here and there for everything -- I wanted to be in and out without wasting much time and that's exactly how it went down! After I finished my food I went to the washroom, and when I returned the server immediately asked if I was done, which I acknowledged, and then she cleared my table. See! That's what I'm talking about! The timeliness and attentiveness of the server really propped up my experience at Pho Goodness.\\n\\nSo why a 4.5 instead of a 5 for service? Not too big of a deal, but there are two things I noticed. There was no quality check of my food -- the food was great, so I don't really mind in this instance, but I also have to acknowledge that the food can't be perfect all the time, and so quality checks must be done. And after clearing my table it wasn't clear to me whether to pay at the counter or at the table. I waited a couple mins for a bill and it didn't come so I realized the expectation was for me to go to the counter -- again, not a huge deal, but after being so pleased with all the efficiency and timeliness up till then, it feels like it's just that one little thing they could have done to be even more efficient.\\n\\nNext up, food was perfect. What else can I say! I got the Pho Dax Nuong (beef noodle soup with lemongrass chicken) and added extra rare beef -- perfect post workout meal! The chicken was great and tender, and the beef was completely rare. Presentation was good as well -- it looked and smelled perfect from the get-go. I'll have to try a noodle soup with an assortment of beef, next time....\\n\\nThere wasn't a speck of dust anywhere. I also have comment on the washroom, as people love my bathroom-commentary. The washroom was also quite clean except for some muddy footprints on the floor, and there was also a mop and bucket in there as well. They restaurant has limited space, but I noticed an employees only area as I was walking down the hall to the washroom; they had space in there.

Mostly men - corporate types but not the types who'd be bothered eating with their hands - and this definitely beat our last group dinner which was at Skipjacks (more formal and quiet).  Bison County was loud and casual but still appropriate for a work event.  I was on the road the week before so I didn't have time to spend on this and didn't pick a menu like I have for dinners in the past.  Basically I chatted with the owner about the type of stuff we wanted and he planned it to stay in our budget.  The food was well-priced and delicious.  Beers came quickly which is important after all-day meetings.  If you go in a big group I recommend family style (people loved that) and the favorite items were the steak and turkey tips, ribs, and sweet potato fries.  I should mention they need advance notice for a group that size.\\nParking in the area can be tough - everyone found a spot but be prepared to check 1 or 2 parking lots before finding one.

The food here is not only overpriced and different than the advertised prices on their website, but not at all Thai Food.  First, we ordered the drunken noodles with chicken.  There was almost no noodles to speak of and literally no flavor.  The only flavor we did taste was the heat from the chili peppers in the food, but this was disappointing given that we ordered it extra mild.  We also ordered the eggplant stir fry with chicken and again, it was all chicken.  We counted 4 pieces of thinly sliced eggplant.  I thought they were jalapenos until I bit into them to find out they are the small green thai eggplant.  The sticky rice was just that.  I called the restaurant to let them know that not only was my food spicy when I ordered it mild, it also had virtually zero vegetables in a vegetable dish and virtually zero noodles in a noodle dish.  The cashier who was very young, was also very apologetic and said she would have the manager look into it, but I have not had a call back.  Either way, I would just say this:  Save your time and money and buy a pack of ramen and you'll still have a better meal than this place. The food has no flavor, it is overpriced (c'mon, I am a 120lb woman who barely eats, and I was starving even after shoving down the spicy chicken!), and it is more like college dorm food than thai food.  As in, you have to be drunk to enjoy it or have no cooking skills whatsoever (sorry college foodies, I was once one too).  I just hope I don't forget on one drunken night and reorder from them.

So why three stars? The staff/service. They're young, hip, fun and energetic, which is usually a plus, but sometimes it seems like their having so much fun at work that they kinda forgot that's where they are. I'm happy to see people enjoy their job, but you should probably still do it.  It's also a bit offensively selective. I have felt so poignantly invisible sitting at the counter it actually forces me to recall high school anxieties. Seriously, you're going to ask EVERY person around me if they're ok while simultaneously and masterfully avoiding eye contact with me for an hour or more at a stretch? I don't generally get treated like a total pariah, so what gives, Bouldin Creek? And they like an Austin-kind of clean, which I sometimes find mildly disgusting when I am in the mood to let that sort of thing bother me. While casually and consistently looking around the bar area waiting for one of the 4-6 servers to finally notice me, I get the opportunity to observe various code violations occur. Last time? I watched *the manager* get up on the service counter and walk around where they make the coffee, over the little rubber mat, as she reached for various items on the tippy top shelf. Maybe not that big of a deal, but the more I thought about where I'd just seen her walking around, including the ladies room, my usually thick constitution wavered. It was just gross. It pains me to do it, but after repeated visits with a consistently sub-par experience I feel like, sadly, I may never return. Of course I WILL always come back (because I have cravings that wake me from a dead slumber for the summer sammy with hummus), but with lower and lower expectations of how that experience will go.

I got inside and the place seemed clean enough. The time of the day seemed not to draw much of a crowd. I had an interaction with a young man who brought me chips and salsa. Now when you tell someone hey 'it's my first time here\\" you don't generally get okay well glad you came. At least not that response alone. Generally I'd expect someone to say well what do you like or what are you wanting to eat etc. I pretty much ignored it though since he wasn't my waiter, and he did ask me about my meal as I was leaving. My waitress was very pleasant and prompt. I got the lunch chicken fajitas and for $7 and change it was darn good. I opened up my corn tortillas and wow watch out for steam people. I mean I'm not an aficionado of Mexican/Latin cuisine but the food was decent. One item not so good were my beans. They weren't cooked long enough...still to firm. I didn't chip a tooth but a little longer in the pot wouldn't have hurt. All in all it was a good experience and I plan to return.....maybe even take my Wife. I also appreciated the fact they have a nice clean men's room. Hey that's a plus because I wash before eating and stale urine would have my appetite ruined. 3 stars until next visit anyway people."},{"name":"The Paramount","address":"44 Charles St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Beware fellow yelpers!

I asked for honey mustard on the side which I'm glad I did because that was the strangest tasting honey mustard ever.\\n\\nBreadsticks - ok so a few weeks ago I baked a loaf of ciabatta bread in my oven. It didn't quite turn out right - not enough fluffiness, too much yeasty-ness. Well, that's basically how these bread sticks tasted like. I'm not sure if these were even freshly made, or if they just used frozen store bought breadsticks.\\n\\nMain course - I wanted something light so I went with the chicken torino. My friend recommended it, so that was another reason why I tried it. Basically it's chicken and fresh vegetables saut√©ed in olive oil and garlic with a touch of marinara sauce. Served over spaghetti. I'm not the best cook in the world, so it's not a good sign when after taking a few bites of dinner, I felt like I could do a better job cooking this. Once again, the veggies didn't seem all that fresh (even though the description said fresh veggies), and the chicken was pretty much tasteless. When they say \\"touch\\" of marinara sauce, they really do mean a touch. Anything less and the sauce would have been non-existent.\\n\\nI'm not sure if I'm willing to give this place another try. When we left, I saw somebody with an order of pizza, and it looked pretty good. Maybe if I come again I'll take their pizza to go since this place is pretty close to home.

Their garlic knots are a great snack while you wait on a table, or, if with a group, order a sampler with knots, cheese, olives, artichokes, etc.  if you do want a lighter pizza option, I would recommend the spinach and mushroom white pizza.

What a great night. It started off challenging because we were stuck in 50 minute traffic driving what normally takes 10 minutes because of V Day. We called and they mentioned they could hold the table for 20 minutes passed our scheduled time which wasn't reasurring. Luckily when we called back again another person answered who was much more sweet and said to not worry and to simply drive safe. We called once more and the third person to answer was also understanding so it appears only the first who answered was a bit rough around the edges.\\n\\nWhen we got there our window seat we asked for was taken by two people who without permission apparently took it and hadn't started ordering anything yet. So the waiter first made us stick on the inner side then a moment later a woman asked the other couple to move as they were not suppose to be sitting there and then we were able to move into our proper seat. The only negative here was that the waiter made us sit in the wrong place rather than simply saying hold on 20 seconds while we get your proper table.\\n\\nThe one other bump in the road was that we ordered from the fixed menu and for one of the apps one of us got the wrong item. Luckily we both love food so we were fine with the other item brought out.\\n\\nOne extra note, no one told us, but apparently you are suppose to get your ticket validated at Top of the Hub because when we left our parking fee was 36 dollars and would have been 24 less had someone offered to validate it and the overall meal for the fixed menu and 3 cocktails for us both and tip came out to well over 400.\\n\\nSo other than those bumps in the road the over all night was amazing.

I'd seen the reviews but thought eh, late night chinese is always good.\\n\\nI decided on their honey braised chicken ($8.99), which came with white rice.  I got the fried rice instead, which is an upcharge of ($1.50).  I kinda assumed the honey braised chicken would be a bone in chicken, or wings at the least.  Instead the honey braised chicken resembles sweet and sour chicken....y'know, little fried blobs of chicken.  \\n\\nThe flavor of the honey braised chicken was very muted.  I suspected it was supposed to be glazed (or braised) with honey, or at the least come with a dipping sauce.  The flavor instead tasted quite doughy and dry, with the occassional honey sweeet nugget. If there was a dipping sauce, similar to sweet and sour chicken for example, that would have made it better for me. Sadly I had to go home and squeeze some bottled honey on them myself.  It was actually really good then (tho i'm not a chef at China Dragon...so I shouldn't have had to)!  The fried rice was pretty standard fried rice\\n\\nLocated off of ponce De Leon Ave, again China Dragon sits next door to Honey Bubble.  There is a very small parking lot, so parking can be tough since spaces are hard to come by.  Getting in and out of this location can also be a nightmare depending on the time of day, and in truth, that's one reason why I never have visited, because I didn't want to deal with getting out of their parking lot when I was driving by.\\n\\nThe interior of China Dragon is no frills...as in there's one very small \\"for two\\" table, and lots of waiting chairs, so it's really not a dine in place.  Customer service is fine enough.\\n\\nIs China Dragon bad food? Eh....well I wasn't expecting to be wowed, so it more confirmed than disappointed.

This place might be a little hard for me to review, but only because I can't remember what anything we ordered was called. But I'll describe them to the best of my ability!\\n\\nA friend and I were going out to dinner one night, and she wanted to take me here. She was quite excited about it - she really wanted me to try new foods. I should stop right here and mention that my friend is from Singapore and has quite different tastes than I do! I told her that I didn't even know what Korean food was and she wanted me to try it out. The time we went out to eat she was making me try bits of her seafood dinner because I don't like seafood and she was trying to get me to be more adventurous. So I agreed to come here.\\n\\nMin-Ga is a cute little place on Bethel Rd. in a strip mall, so it's easy to miss. It's behind that Johnny's Buccelli's place that you can't miss, however. Parking was a breeze, and it was an evening during the work week, so there were only a few other tables in there - a pretty slow night. We walked in and were seated at a table pretty much in the middle of the dining room. The decor was plain but cute, and they took our drink orders and gave us menus. I had no idea what anything was. At all.\\n\\nMy friend decided what she wanted and then leaned over to help me figure out what was going on. I didn't want anything spicy or seafood. She suggested something to me - something with noodles and no meat. That sounded pretty safe to me. When our server came back she ordered for both of us since I had no idea how to pronounce anything. Now, I love trying new things, but I felt very unprepared and undereducated about Korean food, and I would have liked to research it a little bit first. Yes, I'm a nerd like that. But I trusted my friend and decided to enjoy this new experience.\\n\\nWhen our food came out I didn't know what to think. My friend, however, was very happy. I'll describe her food first. She got this soup stuff, and it was this thin reddish broth and chunks of veggies and meats were in the soup. The broth was so spicy that her nose started running and her eyes teared up, but she was in heaven over there with her bowl. Then I look over, and she's waving this completely intact (but dead - I think!) miniature whitish squid - eyes and tentacles and all in front of my face. WTF? There were little creatures in her soup! Then she slurped him up right in front of me. I had never seen anything like that (in real life) before. Weird! But she loved it. And she loved laughing at how horrified I was. She told me there was shrimp and other seafood in there, but I can't remember anything else except for that squid dangling in front of my face.\\n\\nNow, on to my meal. No squids, thank god, but it was equally as strange. I had this plate full of noodles - clear, thick, spaghetti-like noodles. They were topped with veggies and a little bit of sauce. So I dug in with my chopsticks. And tried to eat the noodles. It felt like chewing on gummy worms. Tough, stubborn gummy worms. I mean, these were hard to chew. You'd bite down and they'd spring right back to their original shape in your mouth. What was this? I wanted to know what the heck these things were made out of. You kind of just had to slurp them down. If I tried to chew it all, I could have been there all night. Now, the taste was fine. The taste was actually really good. But the texture was something I just couldn't get used to. And I'm a big texture person. I felt like I had worms in my mouth and it was a little hard to get over. But I ate as much as my mouth could handle.\\n\\nQuite an experience! There's not much else to say about our dinner. She was so proud of me for trying something new that she paid for dinner, so I'm not sure exactly how much it was, but I think each dinner was about $10. She really seemed to love it, so if you're into that kind of thing, I think this place is good. If you're afraid to try new things, avoid this place altogether. But if you're feeling adventurous and want to try something that you didn't even realize Columbus could offer, this is your place. Would I go back? Actually, yes. With or without my friend. If I was never daring I never would have discovered my intense love for spicy Thai food. It was fun, and I'd like the chance to go back and try something else, just as long as there aren't any squids in it."},{"name":"Bouldin Creek Cafe","address":"1900 S 1st St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Came after a day of hiking and I was starved.

That's HALF that was good was the FOOD ONLY.\\nLet me set the picture of our experience for you: It's a wonderful weather Sunday evening in Atlanta and my family and I were in town for a festival. I made reservations using my OpenTable app well in advance for 8:15pm. We arrived at about 7:58pm as I've read and was told by locals that if you don't have a reservation you could be turned away and if you are just 3 minutes late your reservation would be removed and those sitting and waiting for a table would be seated as they would be waiting for someone not to show because the place isn't that large. With that being said we made sure we were early and even valet asked if we had reservations before he took the car.\\n\\nWe enter and checked in with the hostess who's name I don't recall. She checked us in and said that the party at our table was on dessert and would be leaving soon. We went outside to wait because we were actually early for our reservation. After being terribly bitten by some type of insects my daughter, son and I came back in to check on the table (8:35pm mind you our reservation was for 8:15pm) and was told that the party hadn't got up yet. I don't believe in rushing people who are eating so I understood and decided to practice patience and sit at the bar to wait and sip some water. \\nHere is where more inconsistencies came into play, we observed groups walk in from sizes of 2-6 with no reservations and several were turned away and one group was welcomed to stay by the manager (I believe he was the manager) who spoke with them and let them know that he would work hard to sit them. He then approached the hostess and pointed at our party in the system and said \\"is this a no-show \\" and I politely interrupted and stated \\"no we are here and have been here for almost 40minutes waiting\\". He glanced at me holding my 9month old and sitting with my 16year old with a unfriendly grin and nod and turned back to the hostess to talk. Another 15minutes passed (1hour waiting for a table that we had a reservation for) and all of a sudden we were seated. Once seating I say 5minutes later the group that came in with NO RESERVATION was sat next to us and they were soooo loud and express the excitement for being seated in such a place that only excepts reservations. The manager came by to speak with them and WELCOME them which was very nice. MIND YOU the manager never acknowledged us or apologized for our wait or even looked our way much which was very rude.\\n\\nNow to the food:\\nLobster Mac n cheese was AMAZING.\\nThe STAR of the show was the Lobster FRIED RICE YUM YUM\\nThe rack of lamb was also good. The dessert was chefs special some type of red velvet layered with cheese with some type of bubble burst in it which was a delightful treat.

I would really like to see them serve a different soup though being that the brown bean textured soup is not my cup of tea. All of the side items and main courses are rich, hearty meals--many in which were molested with curry sauce. But hey, I'm not complaining. I love Middle Eastern curry.

The Laal-mohon, cheese and milk whey balls dipped in honey and syrup. I like them but do not love them. And the reason why is because the insides are always hard and raw. If only it was juicy and moist all the way through, it would have better. The other dessert, Firni, which is similar to a rice pudding is pretty good. Not something I like to eat a lot of though. \\nAs for drinks, I've only tried the Mango Lassi, which is said to be Panahar's signature drink.

You could grab a coffee or lunch with a pal and sit out front at the little tables and people watch.

Perhaps it was too much olive juice, I don't know. \\n\\nOur food came out pretty quickly, my boyfriend thought his tacos were alright but the roja sauce on my enchiladas tasted like ketchup. I had picked the roja sauce because on the online menu it had listed the roja as being medium spicy but there was nothing spicy about it. It was completely bland and disappointed. \\n\\nThe service was fine and I would still like to try their breakfast tacos but I don't think we'll be back for dinner."},{"name":"Coconut Cafe","address":"759 Beacon St","city":"Newton","stars":"3.5","text":"I live minutes away, so I have always been hopeful for this cute hole-in-the-wall spot wedged into the busy mishmosh of Beacon Street. Yet tonight's takeout--after long absence, as we've been favoring other, better places--was a disappointment. For my sick kid I ventured out in the rain on a Friday evening to procure one lone order of shrimp pad thai. Should be simple, right? When I got there, the proprieters seemed confused and stressed. I was clearly in their way. They made me wait for an order that had been sitting there next to the cashier for fifteen or twenty minutes. When I asked if I could pay by check, they didn't just say no, but gave me the hairy eyeball asking if I didn't have a credit card? When I dug out the cash ($10.65 which seemed a lot for what it was), by accident I was short one quarter (middle aged eyesight, not ill will) and they made a big deal out of it as if I were trying to cheat them. I apologized, added the missing quarter, and asked for a receipt, which sent the cashier into another minor freakout, and she seemed peeved enough to make me wait for that, too, while she did a bunch of other paperwork on the counter. It took her a good while to rifle through a stack of yellow papers to find my receipt as though they had really been put out. When I got home, the pad thai was cold and rubbery, and my daughter and I were nonplussed. To top it off, no napkin, chopsticks or a fortune cookie.

If you are really that concerned, do what the numerous signs inside Voodoo ask and donate to the homeless shelters so they can hold more people, etc.\\n\\n- Voodoo is CASH ONLY, so keep that in mind; If you suddenly forgot your money at home but have a card, there's an ATM in the back corner, I think it's a three dollar fee, I forgot, might have changed.\\n\\n- Voodoo has an entire Vegan menu, so if you have any friends that are Vegan, definitely go here with them and have a good time like I do.\\n\\n- Voodoo has a pretty expansive menu, so try a few new things out every time you come in!

They do a fun thing where you write down what you want on a sheet of paper, like they used to do when the restaurant first opened. I thought that was a very cute and authentic touch. They brought out a bread basket pretty immediately which had cornbread, rolls and cinnamon rolls, along with butter on the table. The rolls were probably the best thing I ate all night. They were hot and buttered and DELICIOUS!!! I got the chicken tenders, baked potato and green beans, and my boyfriend got the chicken friend chicken, cheesy grits and fried okra. All of my food was very average. Kind of bland, but not bad. Nothing stood out but it was good.

The tofu had no taste at all, which made me sad - when the saving grace of tofu is that it soaks up the flavor of whatever you're serving it with, it should have plenty of yum in a sea of oyster and fish sauce!

Both were executed beautifully, with flavor bombs in every bite. It all starts with the dough/crust. I'm pretty sure you could put just about anything on their crust and it would taste good. Yes, it's THAT good. They cook it so well that's it's able to have a nice crunch on the exterior, while still maintaining a good soft chew on the interior. The topping combo on the #6 is a masterpiece. Everything plays super well off each other, with the creamy ricotta being the star of the show!! The calzone was tasty as well, but I would stick with pizza if I was you, because it's some of the BEST. FYI: they stop selling by the slice at 6:30PM.

At the same time, the sweet potatoes had absorbed the scallop juices, leaving a fish sweet potato soup.  Just inedible.  The \\"seared\\" ahi tuna burger is cooked all the way through, also destroying any flavor this tasty fish normally holds.  To no surprise, it was poorly paired with cucumbers AND pickles (really?), and a overly sweet soy-ginger marinade.

It turned out to be a great decision; our bartender was amazing and really helped make it a great experience.\\n\\nFirst, we took advantage of a half-off bottle of wine special and enjoyed a nice Pinot Noir from Oregon.  We then went with the Oyster Mushroom Toast and Potato Chips with pimento cheese, both were really good but the mushroom toast was incredible.

I'm raised in Boston where Provolone is king.  I don't even like the idea of fondue.  Sounds like you should eat it with a miniature poodle on your lap wearing a pink sweater.  The dog, not you; although . . .  So I ordered a way bigger pizza than I needed.

The cost of the pizza was $ 32.00 including tip & delivery fee. 18\\" pizza I believe.  Big.  It was delivered in less than 45 min to the bar in the lobby where I was waiting, beer in hand. There was a shift change and I didn't care to share with the 2nd shift team (another review) so I took my Rocky pizza up to my hotel room. I popped open the box & my jaw hit the ground. Visually . . . It was disgusting.  Vomit pie. I was so mad at myself, not the pizza place. I should have read the description A LOT closer.  It was a $32 pizza & I was starving so I ate a slice. The smell of the crust was amazing and it tasted great too.  The cheese was as repulsive as it looked.  I ate two more slices to give me ballast for the night ahead.  One of my concert buddies came to my room and I offered him a slice and he wouldn't touch it based on the visual component.

If i bought that many slices, they'd HAVE to give me EIGHTY plates.

The curry sauce was delicious - definitely a flavor you don't usually get in a \\"hot dog\\", but the sausage was tiny. Putting the tiny sausage slices in a huge french loaf only compounds the problem. I say \\"hot dog\\" with quotations because it's really more of a sandwich.

It was terribly bland as well. I tried adding salt and Tabasco just to give it something. It tasted like brown water and rice. Terrible. The atmosphere was ok.

The food here is unapologetically rich and artery clogging.

I liked the candied lamb belly itself. The flatbread it was on was strange- maybe it got wet? It was like a soggy pizza crust. \\n\\nThe roasted bone marrow was a first for me. I always see it on food shows so wanted to be adventurous...I may not be as adventurous as I'd hoped. It was just out of my comfort zone. I'm ashamed to admit it because I consider myself a foodie...But the texture and taste just didn't do it for me. And I think I was expecting something a little different. It seemed to be straight fat you scoop out of the bone. You are then provided buttered toast- which to me was overkill. I don't need buttered bread to slather fat on top of. The shortrib marmalade on top was fantastic. The greens, capers and pickled beets really were a great touch in cutting through the richness and fat.\\n\\nFor entrees my husband got the burger and I got the Bar steak- which I was told was a flat iron steak. My husband ate less than half of his burger. He said it was cooked well and he liked it, just that by then he couldn't take any more rich fattiness. My steak was awful. It was like chewing rubber. I was so so so disappointed. My jaw got tired and sore from chewing. I wanted to maintain my classiness and not spit it out so I choked it down. It was so shocking to me. I've had some really great flat iron steaks and was surprised something like this here was so bad. And the fries were just okay.\\n\\nThe best thing was the sticky toffee pudding!

The location, the ambience, the community and its personality. \\n\\nThe location is ideally located in a cultural melting pot of both savory and sweet. Walking around the 5 mile radius of the shop, its clear that there's a cultural transition and its not really a border per se but rather an ensemble of mixed theme shops and restaurants that is as diverse as its tourists. In return, it offers an ambience that caters to all walks of life. Its not mainly focused on the tourist trade but also offers a bit of Portland's weird personality in their dough. \\n\\nThe shop offers a lot of appeal with its alternative and unique personality. Its a first and how else can you successfully introduce a sub rosa lifestyle through the public rather than through a sweet piece of cooked dough. Brilliant really, but not unique. \\n\\nTo critique their donuts, its unique and has good ensemble. The idea is to buy a piece, enjoy it with your favorite warm drink and you carry on. Most of the negative reviews I read about it are from people who sugar-binge with a dozen and devour it all. Ever heard of Diabetes and Obesity? Yeah, America. \\n\\nBesides the hype, they deliver some of the unique combinations of Donuts that I haven't seen elsewhere. I may have heard it through the Food Network but their application is very spot on (Shout out to the Guava Donut). I just hope that they stay grounded with their ever expanding brand and possible franchise. Some joints lose their essence and gives in into corporate greed. \\n\\nStay true Voodoo and continue to stay weird. \\n\\nPS. \\nFor everyone who complains about the staff... this ain't Disneyland.

My girlfriend ordered the steak with radishes and a Chipotle sauce. We both got a dessert which were probably the best part of the meal. The chocolate cake with fresh cream on top with pistachio shavings was delectable.\\n\\nThe bill came out a little pricer than expected, but I would go again and pay for the exact same meal, it was really incredible."},{"name":"Lenoir","address":"1807 S 1st St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"This place was fantastic.

The service is horrible. There is about 3 staff members that are good but they can't take up the slack of everyone else.  If you call to place an order you will most likely have someone hang up the phone on you after waiting on hold forever. I ordered online today at 12:45PM. The order confirmation told me to pick my pizza up @ 1:06PM ( in time for my little ones to have lunch). I arrived at papginos around 1:30PM because I know that the service is slow as hell.  I walked in and there were a lot of customers waiting and I thought to myself I better not have to wait because my pizzas should be done. I gave the cashier my name and she looks for my boxes in the warmer...NOT THERE!  Then she says it should be out soon I told her that I need her to check to see if it is even in the oven. She asks the other staff, they start shuffling around, and finally locate my order slip. MY PIZZAS WERENT EVEN STARTED ON!! She walks back over to me and says your pizzas are about to go in the oven THEN proceeds to tell me how much the total is. Of course I'm like f**k that I don't want the damn Pizzas now.

I was a little unenthusiastic about waiting in line for nearly an hour (it was pride weekend so I think under normal conditions the wait wouldn't be so long), but my travel companions were adament about getting some voodoo doughnuts.   These doughnuts were well worth the wait, not just for the taste, but for the experience as well.  This is a gothic, bad ass doughnut shop.   We got a dozen doughnuts so we could sample many kinds.  Highlights were:\\n\\nBacon maple bar - Better than I expected it to be.  High quality, thick cut bacon, good dough, great maple flavor.\\nDirty Ole' Bastard - Peanut butter is one of my favorite foods, so I am a little bias towards this one.  There's Oreos on this pastry as well as peanut butter.  Oreos didn't add a ton of flavor, but did add great crunch to the peanut buttery taste.\\nApple Fritter - A giant doughnut, fed about three people.  We got one of a fresh batch of these so it was warm and still slightly gooey.\\nButtermilk bar - This is a simple doughnut, but buttermilk and old fashions are my favorite doughnuts.  This one didn't disappoint.\\n\\nThe dough for all these doughnuts was what really made them outstanding.  Anyone can slap some frosting or glaze on a pastry and make it sugary and sweet, but the chewy, fluffy consistancy of the dough made these doughnuts stand out.  I know waiting in line sucks, but if you have time to kill, these doughnuts are worth the wait."},{"name":"Bouldin Creek Cafe","address":"1900 S 1st St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"The BEST kept secret in Austin with the BEST coffee +  food EVER!

It places craft beer, craft spirits, a brew-n-view, and a cigar lounge all within the same building (oddly enough, they achieve this twice, Kennedy School AND Bagdad Theater!) \\n\\nNow, if you're a tourist who wants to get the \\"feel\\" of the Pacific Northwest I would recommend making a stop here (you wouldn't be the only one). The McMenamins have taken historic buildings around town and converted them into artistic, nostalgic places to drink, eat, and be merry. \\n\\nI think the two best things about McMenamins establishments are the atmospheres and the drinking. Few interiors of bars and restaurants across town rival those designed by the McMenamins. They are so well done! Artistic as all hell. Rustic. Nostalgic. Historic. Surreal. Antiquated. Did I mention Artistic? And as for the drinking, I think McMenamins makes some of the best beer in town. I know beer snobs across Portland would disagree with me on this, claiming that the smaller boutique breweries in town produce superior beer, but I don't necessarily agree. The Brewmasters at McMenamins are seriously talented! And if you are a fan of whiskey McMenamins distill a few of their own and they are absolutely out of this world. Pricey, but out of this world!\\n\\nSo at the very least come to Kennedy School for the art and the drinking. But if you want more, there is sooooo much more. Yes there is food here. If it's food you're coming for there are better choices in town. (McMenamins gets a bad wrap about their food but I think I get it. McMenamins can be very touristy and that's where they probably make a lot of their money. They need to provide the kind of food that their demographic desires, so I'm guessing that is why the menu is the way it is. But that's not to say it's not good. It is. It just isn't as... exciting... as some of the others in town). \\n\\nAnd YES there is CIGAR SMOKING ALLOWED, just in one little closed off room (mini-bar area if you will) brilliantly named \\"Detention.\\" It opens at 5 p.m. It is very dark and cramped inside. If you're looking for a little more room to smoke your cigar in, try McMenamins Greater Trumps over off Hawthorne at the Bagdad Theater. I prefer it to Detention, myself.\\n\\nAnd YES there is a BREW-N-VIEW!!! Come see second-run films before they leave the big screen for $3 and enjoy a slice of pizza and a pitcher of their craft beer in the process! \\n\\nThe only reason Kennedy School gets 4 stars instead of 5 is because I like it one click less than the Bagdad Theater area, which I'm obsessed with. They aren't quite on the same pedestal.... But damn close."},{"name":"Pinthouse Pizza","address":"4236 S Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Love the pizza, beer selection and cool set-up.

Real, good Thai food (any food, for that matter) requires more than just a glizty presentation- it requires attention to details, consistency, and fresh, fresh produce. Typhoon does not fail at this, however it does leave much room for improvement, namely with regards to authenticity. Typhoon's food is passably fresh, passably served, and passably authentic. Great place to introduce people accustomed to \\"safe\\" restaurants (e.g. Applebees, Friday's etc) to something new without pushing them too far too fast. \\n\\nFor the rest of us...If you're really in a pinch and have an itch for something pretty Thai-like and can handle the flavor of a bit of corporateness, then Typhoon will do ya just fine.

The food turned out to be just ok - I think the part that was disappointing was that when the menu described the food as spicy - it wasn't. Case in point was the \\"spicy\\" Caesar salad, the \\"spicy\\" croutons, and the fried sweet & \\"spicy\\" calamari. \\n\\nSALMON CHIPS - $9\\nReviews raved about the salmon chips so of course we had to get them. 4 large sized chips topped w/ a generous heap of smoked salmon, chipotle cream cheese, chopped red onions, and way too many capers. Extremely salty even after I tried to remove almost all them. Honestly 1 chip was enough for me - this is a good size app if you have 3-4 ppl. \\n\\nTUNA TARTARE - $10\\nProbably my favorite app of the evening but a lot more spicy than expected. Menu said only the peanuts were spicy but the entire app was very spicy b/c of the Thai chili oil (which isn't mentioned on the menu). Pretty presentation though with the tuna tartare, avocado, and spicy peanuts served on slices of \\"smoked\\" pineapple (which by the way, didn't really taste very \\"smoked\\" to me).\\n\\nSHAVED CALAMARI - $10\\nServer said this was his favorite app so we ordered this too. Menu said it was sweet & spicy, with cilantro & wasabi aioli. The fried calamari was very good but too sweet - tasted more like dessert than app. Couldn't taste any cilantro or wasabi flavors ... the dish wasn't spicy at all either.\\n\\nSPEARS OF ROMAINE - $7\\nWe almost got the Baby Greens Salad b/c it got rave reviews but server convinced us to try his favorite salad, the spicy Caesar salad that turned out not to be spicy and turned out to be your average Caesar salad - and w/ too much dressing :( Menu also mentioned \\"spicy\\" croutons but they were disappointingly not spicy at all. \\n\\nI can say the service was very good, attentive, and knowledgeable. He did a great job telling us how long the different foods were marinated or smoked, the age, and whether they were housemade. I did like the 12-year old balsamic vinegar served w/ the complimentary bread. \\n\\nIf I come again, it'll be more for the drinks ... and maybe I'll try their smoked meats b/c the meat really did smell very good :) I'd probably also request to eat at the bar or on the deck to see if I get a different vibe of the restaurant. \\n\\nFYI - parking is complimentary valet but be forewarned, it's a maze to get to the restaurant.

I dont quite remember what I ordered, since it was recently that my friend Joe L. convinced me to write some reviews on yelp, but I believe I ordered.. a double eel roll, a happy sumo, and a florida roll? Since we had maybe around 8+ people with us that night, it took the chefs quite a bit of time to bust out all that sushi but they were really cool so the wait went by really quick!\\n\\nI was SUPER excited to get my roll, and of course STARVING. They were pretty good, especially those specialty rolls. Unfortunately, I was mostly finished and.. still mostly hungry.. and then my dining experience completely flopped once I got the check. FIRSTLY, the terrible server forgot to put in the \\"buy 2 get 1 free\\" discount, so my total was.. dun dun dun.. $45+ $%#$!@ (with tip)!! I was completely shocked. Never had I eaten $40+ worth of food, and still felt hungry! When the server FINALLY came back, I noticed that I was paying $8 tip to this HORRIBLE server (which probably gets split with the chef as most Japanese restaurants do). The server did absolutely NOTHING but cause confusion, and the server filled our drinks ONCE! If I could, I would have given $7 to the chefs, and $1 to the horrible server. xD I feel so mean, but hey if I was forced to provide excellent  service, so should that server! Especially if youre getting $8 for it :P \\n\\nWell we still had a \\"cool\\" ending that wrapped up the dining experience. My roommate ordered some of the crazy desserts.. Fried Wonton+ Ice cream (I think?) and also some crazy flambe involving one of the chefs busting out a blow torch. They were all pretty good, and pretty expensive. ~$8 for each, and the portions were no bigger than a \\"sample size.\\"\\n\\nSo yeah, I ended up paying around $30 (with tip) in the end and I was still starving. Then I went home and ate half a frozen pizza (I cooked it first :P) because I was still sooo hungry x_x. The sushi was pretty good but not worth its price. I can make better sushi! \\n\\nOverview:\\nAtmosphere: 4/5. It was nicely decorated, and they had a cool little projector that projected the Sushi House Logo on the wall. It was very peaceful and serene.\\nService: 1/5 (Server). Need I say more? :P 4/5(Chefs)\\nFood: 3/5. Food was pretty good, but it was probably because I was STARVING. But not worth paying $10+ for each TINY (big emphasis) roll\\nRecommended? No. Go put your $45 to Fogo or something :P. The food here simply is not worth its value. Overall, this place deserves a 2/5 when you bust out the cost:value calculator. xD"},{"name":"Holy Taco","address":"345 1st St","city":"Lake Oswego","stars":"3.5","text":"Good food but not exceptional.

The tasters were arranged before us and we were given a run down of what we were looking at.  My wife and I made if from left to right/light to dark and were continually surprised and excited and the uniqueness of each brew.  Sure there were a few that were our cup of (beer) but you can appreciate something that isn't your favorite.  There was nothing offensive before us;  each a great demonstration of style and process.\\n\\nWe were swirling, sniffing & sipping each one and taking notes for each brew.  I was self conscious about the process and sure enough I was getting a few looks from what must have been several different groups of regulars over at the bar.  We continued spouting off nose and taste notes to each other.  After about 3 or 4 tastings those same glares over at the bar were raising their glass to me.

Still no avocado so I asked for it to be brought to the table. Our brunch potatoes were cold and dry they tasted like they were made 2 hours ago. The host/server told us they were made an hour ago and they couldn't make us fresh potatoes. Instead he brought over soggy fries. \\nOur friends asked for no onion in their burrito, came out with onions. They paid for turkey bacon and had to ask twice for it, when it was brought over it was ham. Our friend doesn't eat pork, she explained this to the host/server (still unsure what his position is other than to take back all the mistakes that come from the kitchen). \\nThe table next to us sent back her salad because she found a hair in it. About 10 mins later she had to ask the host/server if they forgot about her salad. He then replied I will check if they did. \\nComing from someone who works in the industry here are some tips. 1. Write down the order that guests verbalize so these mistakes can be avoided. 2. Repeat back the order to the guest to ensure they heard you properly. \\n3. When it's not busy make brunch potatoes or fries to order. The quality is not worth paying for after they sit in the flat top for an hour. \\n4. Train your staff how to deal with unhappy guests ie. an apology goes a long way. \\n5. If your going to have people pay before their food comes to the table make sure it is what they ordered. \\nWe paid $45 with 2 coffees - that is absurd.

(the first Yelper to review this restaurant) for introducing me to Al-Amin Halal Restaurant. Al-Amin is one of Buford Highway's newest restaurants. It opened earlier this year (2014) next to the QT gas station just south of I-285. Al-Amin serves halal food meaning it meets Islamic dietary guidelines. \\"Al-Amin\\" is a nickname for the prophet Muhammad.\\n\\nThe owners and staff are Bangladeshi and the cuisine here is more Bengali and Bangladeshi than anything. There aren't many Bangladeshi restaurants in the Atlanta area. Panahar, also on Buford Highway, comes to mind, but the general feeling there is that their food is more Indian than it is Bangladeshi. Al-Amin is truer to real Bangladeshi food and Fate tells me it's also got that homemade authenticity.\\n\\nSeveral of the dishes on Al-Amin's menu can be considered Indian and Pakistani too. For clarification, the term \\"Bengali\\" can refer to people from Bangladesh or certain regions of South India.\\n\\nAl-Amin is new and clean. Day or night, the space is brightly lit and the floors are glossy and shiny. The business actually consists of both a restaurant and a grocery store. The restaurant is small. It has five tables for four and two high-top tables for two for a maximum seating capacity of 24.\\n\\nThe supermarket is also small. There are three aisles filled with assorted Bangladeshi goods and halal foods. There's a produce section, refrigerated foods, packaged dry foods and snacks, and also cookware and miscellaneous items like cricket bats. Up front, they have baskets filled with bags of fresh, hollowed-out puri crisps (used to make panipuri).\\n\\nAt the restaurant, you place your order at the counter. There's a small window behind the counter that allows you a peek inside the kitchen. Take-out is a popular option with many customers phoning in their orders and picking them up to-go.\\n\\nIf dining in, self-serve disposable Styrofoam plates, bowls, and cups are available at the front, along with sturdy plastic cutlery, napkins, and condiments (mint and tamarind chutneys). Glass bowls of sugar are available at every table, intended for use with chai tea. Bottled and canned drinks are available in a fridge and include mainstream sodas like Coke and Bengali beverages like yogurt and lassi drinks.\\n\\nThe food at Al-Amin is delicious and affordable. At the time of writing this review, 36 items are available on the food menu. They consist of samosas, biryani (rice dishes), curries, kebabs (boti and seekh), and various snacks and entrees like haleem (wheat, barley, lentils, meat), chicken tikka masala, shawarma sandwiches/wraps, palak paneer (creamed spinach), and chana masala (chickpeas). With the exception of the lamb biryani, each item on the menu is only $7.99 or less -- a great deal!\\n\\nItems I've tried (descriptions below):\\nVegetable samosas\\nChicken samosas\\nChotpoti\\nMughlai paratha\\nBeef biryani\\nChicken biryani\\nChicken curry\\nFish curry\\nEgg curry\\nChicken seekh kebabs\\nTandoori chicken\\nAloo gobi\\nNaan\\n\\nEverything is made to order and cooked reasonably fast. The food comes out from the kitchen piping hot.\\n\\nThe samosas are good. These are fried pastries filled with onion, peas, lentils, potatoes, and spices. The chicken samosas are prepared a bit differently than the veggie samosas. They've got a thinner, crispier outer layer, kind of like a spring roll vs. an egg roll. Both the chicken and veggie samosas are dense and savory.\\n\\nChotpoti is a typical roadside Bengali dish. It's kind of a like spicy soup. It's made out of diced potatoes, eggs, chickpeas, onion, chiles, and spices. It's topped with cilantro and a flaky crust. It's indeed spicy and a little bit sour too. A hearty snack.\\n\\nMughlai paratha is kind of liked a deep-fried stuffed crepe or pancake. The paratha is fried dough/flatbread and it's filled with scrambled egg, minced onion, and other ingredients. The exterior is crispy and is seasoned and topped with fresh cilantro and raw white onion. Very good.\\n\\nThe biryani rice dishes are simply excellent. They're some of the best biryani I've had in Atlanta. The dishes are made with basmati long-grain rice and a combination of spices. I prefer the beef biryani slightly over the chicken, but both are great. The chicken biryani is a bit more aromatic and perfumey. Both plates consist of heaping mounds of rice and tender, juicy, tasty chunks of meat.\\n\\nThe curries are good. They aren't as creamy nor as greasy or oily as a lot of Indian curries can commonly be -- a subtle, pleasant difference. The fish used in the fish curry is tilapia.\\n\\nI recommend the chicken seekh kebabs (Pakistani dish). The chicken is nicely roasted and seasoned. It's moist, appetizing, and flavorful.\\n\\nThe aloo gobi (potatoes, cauliflower, spices) is not bad.\\n\\nDefinitely order naan (oven-baked flatbread) for the table. Al-Amin has their naan recipe down right. It stays soft even when cool.\\n\\nService is fantastic. The server lady is friendly, helpful, and speaks English well."},{"name":"Garden Caf√©","address":"810 W Colonial Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"This is an awesome place to eat.

The yucca is really, really good. Felt lighter than traditional fries and they were perfectly fried. The chicken was even better - terrific spice improved with the green salsa. I didn't care for the mayo-based sauce, however. I'm not a mayo guy. I'd give the place 5 stars however they charged 27 cents for an extra green salsa. I really don't understand the logic behind charging for salsa.

How is that possible? I don't quite know. A guest came from out of town and really wanted traditional southern food, so we went to Mary Mac's Tea Room. And it was everything I expected it to be.\\n\\nOCCASION\\nAs you know, Atlanta is a great city, but not the best for tourists (we have what... the World of Coke, Aquarium, and CNN?). But, the one thing out of towners are in a treat for is the food! Quite often when guests come from out of town wanting to eat good ole southern food, I'll take them to a brunch place, but now I'll take them to Mary Mac's Tea Room. They also have a variety of table sizes, with an abundance of rooms, so you can come with any sized party. However, do keep in mind that there is usually a wait. \\n\\nATMOSPHERE\\nIt feels like a homey church with a bunch of historic photos and memorabilia hung on the walls. It isn't anything glamorous or formal, but it feels like a warm grandmother's cooking in a humble yet large home. Very casual and down to earth, yet clean.\\n\\nFOOD\\nThe prices are very affordable ($9-12) for massive sized portions that we couldn't finish and had to take home. The menu is pretty extensive with just about every type of southern entree and sides you could imagine. If you're a first timer, they'll bring out a sample of their potlikker for you which is the leftover liquid from collard greens, so it is a nice and salty soup with some pieces of greens that you crumble corn bread into. It hits the spot. They also bring out a basket full of butter rolls, corn bread muffins, and cinnamon rolls. Now that's southern hospitality! I ordered the meatloaf with collard greens and brunswick stew. The meatloaf was tasty with the onions and green peppers cooked into it, and it came with plenty of ketchup on top which I like. The collard greens hit the spot! I usually fear collard greens being too salty, but these were perfect. The brunswick stew left something to be desired though, which is a shame because that's one of my go-to sides at southern establishments. Others at my table loved their fried pork chops and fried okra (almost got both sides of just fried okra!). \\n\\nSERVICE\\nOur waitress was pretty decent. She and a couple other waiters serviced our whole room so they were kept busy. The only issues that I had were that they forgot to bring us utensils until our food came out, so we weren't able to butter our bread until then. However, she kept a smile on her face and was very accommodating in attending to our needs throughout the evening. \\n\\nOverall, very homey experience at Mary Mac's, and it has become my default Southern dining establishment for whenever people come to visit from out of town. But let me lower your expectations - don't expect fireworks and for the food to blow your mind. I would say it represents Atlanta's soul food well though."},{"name":"Ask For Luigi","address":"305 Alexander Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Fresh and delicious.

Let me state now, that if you ever wanted to try Black Creek Bistro, Happy Hour (which runs until 7pm) is the time to do so.\\n\\nI sampled the Fried Calamari which was thick cut instead of the tiny squiggly squid at most restaurants. It was delicious and even better when dipped in the provided sauce, something along the lines of duck sauce and lemon juice. At $5 during Happy Hour pricing, I would order this dish every time, but at $9 it feels like a waste because there are only 8 or so good thick pieces of calamari on your plate. Another friend started with the House Salad, pecans, dried cranberries, goat cheese, and a balsamic vinegar dressing topped a spring salad mix. I snuck a few bites and was very pleased with the sweetness the goat cheese provided.\\n\\nIn typical dinner fashion, we were provided with dinner rolls before our meals started. Herbed bread with an even better herbed butter. This provided us some moments of reflection in the dining room. The walls and tables were pristine white, with dark trim and exceptional lighting throughout. The dining room is small, seating something like 30 or 40 maximum, but a large window opens onto the street providing lots of natural light to flood in. The overall feeling I got was one of crispness and naturalness, which goes along with the theme of Black Creek. \\n\\nDinner arrived and the trance was broken with the smell of my delicious plate. After careful examination of the dinner menu, I had ordered the Lamb Lollipop which was two ancho chili rubbed lamb chops with a drizzle of roasted red pepper honey placed artfully on top of a bed of season vegetables (in this case cauliflower). The portion of lamb was tiny, however the meat was prepared in a quality manner and I can't get over that red pepper honey. And I was a little over zealous about the cauliflower, not that there was anything special, it had just been so long since I had any cauliflower.\\n\\nMy dining mates were not as thrilled with their dishes as I was with mine. One friend, on a newly started health kick ordered the cornmeal dusted tofu. The tofu was just two slabs placed in a pile of black bean puree. Slimy on top of more slimy. It wasn't a well thought out dish. My other friend ordered the $10 dinner special which changes from day to day. On Monday it happened to be the Penne Carbonara. Grilled chicken, mushrooms, some bacon, all in a carbonara sauce which reportedly was on the oily side. Also go ahead and scratch off \\"grilled\\" chicken and write in \\"blackened\\". It wasn't bad, but it's a good thing it was only $10.\\n\\nNow, the waiter we had was absolutely the pinnacle of hospitality. He alone should receive 5 stars. When he noticed the tofu plate had barely been touched, he asked if there was anything wrong. My friend replied \\"No, it just turns out I'm not as big of a fan of tofu as I thought I might be\\". He immediately offered to replace the plate with something else on the menu. Now that's a good indicator of service!\\n\\nI'm leaving my review at 3 stars, but I would like to return for lunch at Black Creek sometime soon because they have a completely different lunch menu. Hopefully that will boost them to 4 stars, but I don't think I could ever go to 5 stars. I think Black Creek is a little overpriced and I'll only be hitting them up for dinner before 7pm."},{"name":"Home Slice Pizza","address":"1415 S Congress St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I have no idea why, but I crave this pizza!!

So if you're really wanting wings, I'd go somewhere else. But if you want just ok wings and are really just coming for the breasts, then you're in the right place, ha! I will give Hooter's credit for their sandwiches though. I really love their ham and cheese sandwich. The bread always tastes fresh and the sandwich always fills me up. Their fries are just okay but I they do have really great fried pickles! I love that they have sweet tea and it's always sweetened perfectly. The service isn't always that great but that's mostly because the waitresses focus most of their time with the tables filled with guys which I guess is understandable.

You just keep seeing room after room... you could literally fit an entire small Southern town in here. Whatever they're doing, they must sell quite a bit of sweet tea to maintain the space. Yes, there are more hole in the wall places around, but this is well suited locationwise - I just saw a show at the Fox in conjunction with a meal at Mary Mac's. (And no, I didn't fall asleep during the show after my carb induced meal. Thank goodness.) Also, lots of the hole in the wall places tend to be open for just lunch or close on the early side... So enter Mary Mac's, stage left. The 'schweet' on the sweet tea scale is just as you would expect - ridiculously high. And though I'm no nutritionist, the unhealthy on the healthy scale is quite high too. But you already knew that... and actually, that's probably why you came. Fried and butter being the national anthem of Southern cuisine, they know how to do it up.

Moscow?).\\n\\n^The double bacon risotto - This was hands-down the table's favorite dish. \\n\\nGOOD:\\n^The service - Our server was really good - almost great. He wasn't quite as attentive as we would have liked, but if we were in school, he'd still get a solid B. Of course I have no clue what his name is. Theo? Nathan? Hell, I can't remember. Sorry!\\n\\n^The chorizo/kobe burgers and fries - All of us ordered this, and it was really tasty. But we're definitely not talking as delicious as a burger from Northstar, 3rd & Hollywood, or Flipside. The burger just wasn't as moist and juicy as I would have liked. \\n\\n^The chicken & goat cheese flatbread - This was really light, crispy, and delicious! I'll definitely get this again.\\n\\n^The prices - I had a drink, an appetizer, and a burger/fries for about $30. Not too shabby.\\n\\nMEH:\\n^The bathroom - Yeah, the men's room was kinda gross. It's almost like they ran out of money in the remodeling and just said \\"fuck the bathrooms\\". \\n\\nSo, in the end, I really enjoyed De Novo and will totally go back.

My father and I have been coming here ever since we first moved to Orlando. When I was younger I mostly just went for the crab legs and the clam bake basket thing. But a few years ago on our annual Father's Day lunch I tried an oyster raw for the first time and I never looked back. \\n\\nNow-a-days all I need is a bucket at the bar and some lemon juice in a squeeze bottle. A packet of saltines doesn't hurt either. I could sit there and just slurp them down one by one. \\n\\nAnd for those of you that have never had a raw oyster at L&R's, let me give you a play by play. \\n1) Walk into the building covered with a boat cut-out and go find the light blue bar. \\n2) Sit down and you will be greeted by a shucker, who will open a packet of saltines for you, ask you what you want to drink and get you a menu.\\n3) In this scenario you order oysters (a dozen or a bucket, depending on how hungry you are). They are brought to you at the bar whole and alive. Your shucker will begin.\\n4) In goes the knife, off comes the top shell, and now in front of you is your fresh raw oyster.\\n5) This is where you channel your inner fear factor contestant. Keep in mind, it looks like a giant booger. I'm not going to lie you you. Worried about food poisoning? Don't. The oysters are brought in fresh everyday and if you are about to eat a bad oyster you can smell it before it even gets close to your mouth. \\n6) Pick your sauce. Personally I like just lemon juice because I think it give the oyster a tart freshness and helps it come out of the shell easier.\\n7) Grab a shell, bring it up to your mouth, tilt you head back, and... you did it! You ate a raw oyster! See? That wasn't so bad, was it? They're actually pretty good. Now throw that shell into the sink behind the counter! It's half the fun. :)\\n8) Repeat steps 1-7 and enjoy!\\n\\nYou can also get them cooked medium or fully if you don't want to venture into the world of raw oysters just yet. There's also crab legs that are pretty good with butter, my fave. Also available are a variety of fried foods... I wouldn't. Fried and chicken tenders are always a fall-safe for kids but I wouldn't recommend the crab cakes or anything along those lines. It's just frozen stuff that they throw in the fryer.\\n\\nAnd yes L&R's is old, dingy, kinda smelly. But that's part of the charm if  you ask me. The bathrooms are something else. But I'm not reviewing the bathrooms now, am I? \\n\\nI love Lee and Rick's.

Some dishes can seem very pricey in comparison to what's actually being served though. Overall, the food is delicious in my opinion. Haven't been disappointed yet.\\n\\nMy Complaints:\\n1.) Bartender is very slow at making drinks (even on less busy nights); usually takes about 15 minutes to receive your drink initially and 15 minutes for a refill. Very, very slow. Please hire another bartender to help if it's going to take this long to serve your guests. :/\\n\\n2.) Servers are constantly trying to find busy work and won't leave your table alone (I'm guessing their manager has put them up to this but they should really STOP doing this for the sake of annoying customers.)\\n\\nLet me explain, you will have about 5 different servers show up to your table EVERY few minutes to wipe off non-existent crumbs or do some other menial task that someone else just did. Meanwhile, your main server is nowhere to be found when you actually need him. This gives the impression that your main server did virtually no work and the rest of the servers were unintentionally being overly bothersome.\\n\\nI don't particularly enjoy when servers put their hands in my face and start stretching their arms across the table to grab a plate that I'm not even finished eating food from. Filling my water cup when someone else just filled minutes ago that I haven't even taken a sip from it.  Wiping crumbs, maneuvering my dishes around, and clanking dishes in my ear. Just imagine being interrupted every few minutes when you're in an in-depth conversation or discussing business. \\n\\nOne server stood at our table for what seemed like 45 seconds struggling to fold a dirty napkin into some oddly shaped origami that only she could understand. Pretty sure she was high AF because my partner was still using his napkin when she took it away and we were kinda left dumbfounded. Also, on multiple occasions we had to waive our original server down to come refill our alcoholic drinks - we really, really don't like doing that.\\n\\nHonestly, these are all very normal tasks that every servers should be doing, however, doing too much of one thing can be a bad thing... Please tell your servers to tend to their own tables, chill out with the excessive service at every table, and have your main servers stick around with their original table(s)."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"The name of Voodoo Donuts was the best thing about this donut place.

Yes... it's greasy, but it's supposed to be. For those that don't know what Detroit style pizza is (thank you Wikipedia) :\\nDetroit-style pizza is a style of pizza developed in Detroit, Michigan. It is a square pizza similar to Sicilian-style pizza that has a thick deep-dish crisp crust and toppings such as pepperoni and olives and is served with the marinara sauce on top. The square shaped pizza is the result of being baked in a square pan, which is often not a pizza pan. Rather, industrial parts trays are often used, which were originally made to hold small parts in factories.\\n\\nThe crust of a Detroit-style pizza is noteworthy because in addition to occasionally being twice-baked, it is usually baked in a well-oiled pan to a chewy medium-well-done state that gives the bottom and edges of the crust a fried/crunchy texture. Some parlors will apply melted butter with a soft brush prior to baking."},{"name":"The Paramount","address":"44 Charles St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"We waited in line for 45 minutes but the food was well worth it.

The menu was simple and had many great options. With such a big party I was able to see and ask about various dishes. The food came out quickly which was a plus, about the same time as the drinks.

Every time I visit this place, I'm always blown away by all the artwork lining the walls. Every room has its own unique theme, which is what makes this place so much fun! I usually go to this McMenamins for its excellent auditorium that was converted theatre. I love this place because of the combination food and very affordable movies with its BIG COMFY COUCHES .\\n\\nI think that all McMenamins are fun and that they are all worth a visit since they are all uniquely decorated. The only downside of McMenamins for me though is the food quality. I'm definitely not a fan, and have yet to find something that I would consider ordering twice! Except the sausage calzone I had the other day was good. The only downside is that the outer layer was way too hard for me to fully enjoy it. I felt like I was killing my food all over again before I could take that next bite.  \\n\\nMcMenamins Kennedy School is a very fun place to visit!

I had errands to run and ordered to go.  So my food sat for a few hours while I ran around but when I re heated my food it was good!!! the French toast did not taste like raw egg the toast was still toasty, the turkey bacon was slightly crisp and it has been hard for me to find a good tasting turkey bacon but Rosie's nailed it!! thanks Rosie and the eggs were also good re heated tasty and seasoned well enough!!

He is kind and welcoming, and makes us feel at home every time we walk through the doors. Most of the wait staff is just as incredible. We especially like Andrew - he is prompt, attentive, and friendly. The ambiance is also perfect. Unlike most other brunch places in Atlanta, Mediterranea somehow strikes the perfect balance of chic and warm, trendy yet comfortable. The natural sunlight that streams in is lovely, and when the weather is nice, the rooftop patio is impossible to beat. You don't have to wait in a crowded lobby or yell over each other to be heard once you get inside. It's peaceful and relaxing, every moment enjoyable.\\n\\nBut aside from the wonderful staff and fabulous ambiance... there's the food. Like other reviewers have said, the menu is 100% gluten free but what Mediterranea sacrifices in gluten, they make up for in taste. Not only is it every gluten-intolerant person's heaven, but even those gluten-loving people adore it, too. My husband used to stick his nose up at gluten-free foods, but after finding Mediterranea, he is as obsessed as I am. People are always shocked to find it's gluten free.

The peppers were small, red and mildly spiced and completely slammed with quinoa.  Such a great dish!\\n\\nBib-lettuce salad with watermelon horseradish, pea sprouts (I believe) and the dressing seemed like a vinaigrette but I am not sure.

It has a rather modern feel. \\n\\nWe ordered Cassava fries to share, Deconstructed Pho for my friend, and House Vermicelli (with pork & prawn skewers) for me. The fries were wide cut and mushy soft on the inside, while still crispy on the outside. Loved the spices and dip that came with this dish. The Deconstructed Pho was quite interesting - it was basically pho without the soup, but with some sort of sauce instead. I tried a little of it. Both my friend and I felt the sauce was a tad too strong. Interesting concept, but we probably won't get this dish again next time. The House Vermicelli consisted of vermicelli noodles served with pork & prawn skewers, a deep fried spring roll, some veggies, and the standard Vietnamese fish sauce. It was delicious! \\n\\nOverall, nice ambience, friendly service and good food. We'll definitely be back again to try other items from their menu!"},{"name":"Home Slice Pizza","address":"1415 S Congress St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"By far my favorite pizza place in town and probably the best I've ever had.

But, eventually the hunger pains made me reluctantly cave in... and I'm soooooo happy I did.  I can't really vouch for many of the other food carts, but Lady Thai seems to hold a pretty high standard for cleanliness.  'Lady' thai is a little old Thai mama that works her butt off at the noon hour.  I usually try to wait till 1 when the rush calms down... it takes her about 8 minutes to make one order, so never mind a line full of hungry customers.  Believe me though, it is worth the wait.  I usually order the Pad See Ew or the Pad Ke Mow - extra spicy (because of my addiction to the thick rice noodles and a mouth on fire) and I have never had better.  I'm not sure how the curries are  made, I can't imagine that she makes them on the spot, but the noodle dishes are super fresh.  You can watch her cook the whole meal with fresh veggies and noodles right in front of you so I know it hasn't been sitting there all morning.  To ice the cake, it's $5.25 for 2 days worth of food, although, usually the next day the left overs don't make it to lunch.

If the carts start passing on that increase to the customers, I probably won't go as often as the cost of the food at most is already somewhat high (although you get great quality).

In the evening, I always enjoy a cup of their very delicious homemade soups. Their spaetzel (German-style pasta) is a favorite dish of mine. Their hamburger is good, but better to enjoy elsewhere as there is a tendency to overcook the meat and over brown the bun for some reason. I enjoy peeking at the chefs while they are hard at work cooking my meal, and I will usually wonder out loud to my spouse how such humble-looking men can create such delicious food with their hands!"},{"name":"Top of the Hub","address":"800 Boylston St, Ste 52","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"We came here for drinks one night when we had some friends in town.  There was a long wait for a table, so we decided to just stand at the bar.

When we went to sit down, someone else stopped us and said that since we started drinking at the bar, we could not sit there.  We told the man what the hostess had told us, and he brought over some other lady who said the same thing that he said.\\n\\nI was really bummed.

About a decade later, tired of the limited options in the area, my husband and I were craving Mexican food recently so we decided to give it another try.  It was much better, although still far from perfect.  On the upside is the cute d√©cor, the friendly service and the stiff margaritas.  I ordered the spinach enchiladas and my husband had a chimichanga- both of which were really good.  On the downside- the salsa was just okay and was served out of Styrofoam foams which seems extremely wasteful.  Also the refried beans need some serious work- they were barely lukewarm, bland and more of a stiff/whipped texture as opposed to creamy.  Just not good at all.

I absolutely loved the soup and lobster roll, especially how the lobster roll had a mayo base. The mussels were very spicy, which I am quite sensitive to so I did not enjoy them, but I am sure that's more of a personal preference. My parents loved their respective dishes, and I found the chips delicious! \\n\\nOur waitress was incredible because she was very caring and described each dish very well, which helped us make better choices on what to eat. She even gave me a birthday candle to blow out on a plate even though I was much too full for dessert.\\n\\nThe bread rolls that came with the meal were very enjoyable (although not low fat!) and we also received hush puppies which had a dipping sauce that was very sweet.

In summary, the desserts are incredible and the rest of the menu is hit or miss. That said, the restaurant is adorable and has a really unique and enjoyable vibe that I would definitely return to.\\n\\nWe arrived without reservations and were seated without any wait that evening. First impressions were great - the outfits of the staff were on point with the look and feel of the restaurant. However, our waitress seemed a bit agitated / not too excited to work that night which was a bit off-putting. Fortunately, everyone else we interacted with was talkative and happy to converse and take care of us!\\n\\nThe drinks were good and priced pretty well. I personally recommend asking for a spiked version of the Bruleed Pineapple to liven things up a bit.\\n\\nWe ordered the crab avocado toast to start which was pretty underwhelming even as far as avocado toast goes. It was missing much zing or other flavor profiles in addition to the main 2 components. \\n\\nWe then shared the burger, cauliflower, brussels sprouts and brick chicken. Of these, I would re-order the burger and brussels sprouts in a heartbeat and pass on the other two. The Brussels were on point and rich with flavor while the burger, as raved about by many others, is pretty close to perfect and priced very, very nicely at ~$8. The cauliflower had potential but didn't compare with the other plates. Lastly, the brick chicken was recommended and pretty disappointing and bland even with all the components taken together. I would suggest increasing the portion sizes by just a bit; between 2 people it was pretty solid but had we had any additional people in our party I would be agitated by how few bites I would be able to have. \\n\\nLastly, and as teased in the beginning of the review, the desserts were all amazing. We went balls to the wall and got the sunflower tart and the birthday cake sandwich. And with our birthday celebration, we were also treated to a scoop of the seasonal ice cream which tasted identical to frosted corn flakes! The sunflower tart was a sleeper of a dessert and totally shocked me. Between the combination of slightly sweet and savory components, varied textures and unique flavors, this was definitely a highlight. The birthday cake sandwich was also great but definitelyyy on the sweet side and you only need a few bites. Hits the nail on the head with the birthday cake flavor, though.\\n\\nAs mentioned, I'll definitely come back but only with one other person and will try the other dishes on the menu and save plenty of room for dessert!"},{"name":"The Righteous Room","address":"2142 Johnson Ferry Rd","city":"Brookhaven","stars":"4","text":"Some patrons of my favorite watering hole raved about how cheap this dive bar was and how fun it was so I had to do a drive by during the day to one; verify the dirt poor prices and two, to get a feel for the vibe.\\n\\nIt is located in the Old Five Points shopping center, taking over the space formerly occupied by Thai Lana. The first thing you will notice is the giant magnolia tree growing right through the middle of the bar, branching out through the skylight. During the daytime, it looks a little weird.

I think that Matt (which is basically a bourbon-barrel-aged super-Adam) is literally the best beer I've ever had.\\n\\nThe last time I came in, they happened to have Matt on tap and it was every bit as good as I remember the last few times I've had it. I've only been fortunate enough to have it on tap 4 times now, but it never disappoints.\\n\\nI also had the Reuben and while it wasn't the best I've ever had, it was well above average and that's saying something coming from a brewery that really could serve no food at all and still make me happy.

I had a brisket sandwich which consisted of chunks, not slices, of peppery brisket, some sides of onion / pickles on top and a potato salad. \\n\\nThe white bread had the structural integrity of... white bread trying to hold onto spiky chunks of meat and bbq sauce. One bite and the sandwich fell to the plate with simultaneous, complete and total structural failure. The bread didnt have a chance. Knife and fork in hand, the pile of discombobulated brisket sandwich was dismembered swiftly with my fork and knife, and it's probably tastier that way. \\n\\nThe side I ordered was potato salad which is often a poor afterthought. In this case, it was a creamy delight with one exception which I may be alone in disliking, the skins. It's an unnecessary texture that adds little if not detracts from the lovely flavors and textures. That said, Id continue to order it and be happy picking the skin out. \\n\\nPeople around me were merry, eating happily their sausage (ran out), turkey (ran out) and other things (ran out, ran out ran out)\\n\\nOn the food, the meat is spetacular and on it's own, without flaw. A tad peppery but it's a taste thing and I still give it 100%. The potato salad, Eh, I have to question the skin thing but again, the flavor is flawless and a winner. But the white bread, that's a non-starter. I dont see how anyone who orders it can eat it without mid-air bread fuselage detonation. That really needs to be something else with a hearty hide to contain the pointy beefy chunks of love and their attendant love juices.\\n\\nI like the joint, and I wish them well but they have an inherent supply-chain limitation that could be solved with some simple six sigma. It just takes too damn long to get food and it's not hard to fix that. Any place that wants to scale or at the very least not annoy the crap out of their customers has to figure out how to get the product to the customer before they abandon the transaction. Not, its not part of the charm, eliminate some of the process inefficiency so when people come and line up they're not waiting 20 minutes when only 6 people are ahead of them. And, why run out of food so early? Franklin and this place, seriously, people, supply chain logistics...

We got dark chocolate and strawberry & cream pastries first, and I liked them so much that I asked to take an extra dark chocolate one home, and they brought out TEN more in two little boxes for us all to share. Now that's service. \\n\\nThe shrimp & grits, salads, and goat cheese and mushroom fondue appetizers were great, and the lobster omelette of the day, eggs benedict, bacon wrapped scallops, and chicken & waffle sliders were excellent too. The red velvet cupcake and caramel flan desserts were tasty, but by then, we were all so full that not one of us could eat it all. \\n\\nI got a reservation a couple weeks in advance and asked for a window seat, and they honored it. The restaurant wasn't full, so they could have even if I didn't ask, probably. But it was nice that they paid attention. The view was good too, of course.

But about 40 minutes later we finally got our main courses, and it was pretty meh. The shakshuka had no tomato sauce, so it wasn't really shakshuka, it was more like eggs with bitter greens. And the Mediterranea breakfast plate was a great concept, much like having breakfast straight from the Mediterranean...but it just didn't all come together. The yogurt was warm, the fruit was sour, the dolma was kind of sweet and dry, which was odd. Perhaps some would enjoy it, it just wasn't what I was hoping for.

The lamb was so tender that I could see the clear beige as it fell off the bone. There's a delicate balance between releasing from the bone as it did and slightly overcooking it and Andina really pulled through and got it right. Definitely a must-try.\\n\\nThe lamb dish was warm, rich, quite protein heavy (as is much of Peruvian food), so make sure you complement it with something light and bright. I chose the mango verde y langostino cebiche, because mango obviously. The langostinos were well \\"cooked\\" - not chewy or overdone. It was particularly sour, to be expected, but there was an unexpected addition of sweet potato on the edge of the plating that was wonderful with the liche de tigre. It gave the dish a sort of matte velvety finish, if you can imagine something like that. There was also a section of corn - I'm not sure if there's a cultural significance but it seemed a nuisance.

We will save the voucher for a special occasion, and I'll let you know how it goes. ;)\\n---\\n\\nI would have given Top of the Hub 4 stars were it not for a rather unpleasant encounter we had just before leaving. (We contacted the manager afterwards and he is apparently currently reviewing video footage, though I'm not sure what light that would shed, seeing as it wasn't a fist fight, and a security camera wouldn't capture dialogue.)\\n\\nMy boyfriend took me here last Friday night for my birthday-- I had never been, and the view was fantastic. We were seated right away with our reservation, and everyone was totally friendly. Our waiter was great: knowledgeable, attentive, kind. The food was good-- my swordfish was a little dry, but my boyfriend's filet mignon was delicious. We both had chopped salads as well, which were good and a perfect start to the meal.\\n\\nAnyway, now to the reason for one star. After we had paid for our meal, all was well and we went to get a picture by the window before leaving-- after all, this place is all about the view, and I wanted a picture to commemorate my birthday dinner. We sought out a spot in the corner where we wouldn't disturb anyone in the middle of a meal, and my boyfriend asked a woman who was playing on her phone (clearly waiting for someone) if she would mind taking a picture of us. She said no, of course not. Just as I was handing her my camera, one of the greeters came over and told us they don't allow people to come in and take pictures where guests have reservations. Thinking she was suggesting we didn't have a reservation, my boyfriend told her that we had a reservation and had just finished eating. She then reiterated that this area was for people with reservations, and my boyfriend reiterated that we, too, were guests, since she seemed to be accusing us of walking in off the street. Then she explained, finally, but rudely, that they don't want to disturb the guests (why didn't she say that to start?). Now that the crux of the issue was more clear, my boyfriend said, \\"Oh, okay, well then would you mind taking a picture of us?\\" She seemed to think we were trying to undermine her authority, and she got very defensive, saying more loudly, \\"No, sir, I will NOT.\\" At this point, my boyfriend had no idea why she was so upset. She said, clearly insincerely, \\"I would be MORE THAN HAPPY to take a picture of you against the wall or by the entrance.\\" My boyfriend tried to interpret her words in the nicest way possible, but at this point I was on the verge of tears (I've never been so unexpectedly uncomfortable in a restaurant!), and I simply said no and walked away. People generally don't feel like having their picture taken by someone who has accused them of being rude assholes.\\n\\nIt was painfully clear to me that this staff member had been trained to enforce a particular policy (\\"no photos where the guests are dining\\") but completely UNtrained on how to enforce it (without suggesting that people are walking in off the street, without an accusatory tone of voice, without being rude). Essentially, we were admonished for what was a clear miscommunication of a policy that was poorly enforced. As my boyfriend said afterwards, he wouldn't expect that kind of treatment at McDonald's, let alone at a pricey establishment that prides itself on the atmosphere. \\n\\nThe one thing I wanted from my birthday dinner was a picture together, and we didn't get that. We just got a crappy end to what was otherwise an enjoyable evening after a long, stressful week."},{"name":"Boi Brazil Churrascaria","address":"5600 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Friendly atmosphere and delicious food.

So my parents and I went in to the quaint little restaurant. We ordered a bowl of clam chowder, oysters, Littleneck clams, scrod, and the seafood stew. \\n\\nThe ambience was nice, like you traveled back 50 years. However, seating was a bit cramped. I'm all about the atmosphere but let's get to the food. \\n\\nClam chowder tasted like they opened a can of Progresso soup and added a little more clams in it, and to top it off was horribly over-priced.\\n\\nThe oysters were the biggest disappointment. A good oyster needs to cold, and fresh. The oysters we got were not ice cold, but slightly cooler than room temp, and didn't taste very fresh either. To top it off, there were pieces of cracked shells still in it, and presentation was terrible. Price per oyster was decent, had we been in Hawaii, but we're in Boston where the seafood is a stone's throw away, and was 150% more expensive than the restaurants around it.\\n\\nLittleneck clams were the only decent things here, but even they weren't ice cold like they should be, and, you guessed it, over-priced. \\n\\nOur main entrees was so-so at best. Seafood stew was too much starch, not enough seafood, and the flavors did not complement each other but took away from the experience. Scrod filet was overcooked, dry, and still had bones in it. \\n\\nIt is a nice historic sight, but that's not enough to save the food.

Between pickled vegetables and two dips, this is the elegant version of chips and dip.  In addition, the kitchen sent out a complimentary pierogie appetizer.  Given the fresh pierogies we are used to in the New York area, we tend to be rather picky when it comes to these little pockets of potatoes and cheese.  These were a little thicker than I like them and the grainy sauce they came with was just a little too heavy for me.  \\n\\nFor our entrees, I chose the suckling pig while Will R went with the hanger steak.

It's loud!  I didn't turn down my volume and accidentally made a little water in my britches when the music came blasting out of my computer.  It's not what you'd expect.  On the outside, J.Liu is nearly identical to the buildings adjacent to it, one of which is a bank.  So what, you ask?  You just need to make sure you have an idea of where you're going or else you might just drive right on by it.  On the inside, J.Liu is nicely decorated with a distinct upscale vibe.  Check out the menu online first though, because you're not going to be able to determine what kind of restaurant J.Liu is based on its d√©cor.  Tables are nicely spaced and the place was spotless.   \\nHigh marks:  Nicely spaced tables, clean, upscale\\nLow marks:   Upscale d√©cor lacks theme\\n\\nService:  Grade B:  If you happen to check out any other reviews of J.Liu (and you shouldn't since our review is the best), you might see some comments on inconsistent service in the dining room and at the bar.  We've dined at J.Liu a number of times and have never had bad service in the dining room.  We can't really speak for the bar area since we go to restaurants to dine and we go to bars if we are looking to tie one on.  Our server, Kate, did a really nice job of providing for us.  But again, this is one of those occasions where we had good service but nothing spectacular.  There was nothing memorable about the service.  Food arrived promptly and our drinks were replaced with minimal wait, but the service was professional but a little lacking in personality.\\nHigh marks:  Quick and accurate service\\nLow marks:   Nothing memorable about service\\n\\nFood/Spirits:  Grade A-:  Let's talk about the good stuff, now.  For our drinks, I opted for the Rogue Dead Guy Ale, which I've reviewed a couple of times already.  Katina, on the other hand, ordered a drink named the \\"Royale.\\"  She found the drink to be delicious, with a pronounced blackberry flavor (both of us are quite fond of blackberries).  We opted for the potstickers for our appetizer.  \\n \\nMy gripe with potstickers (and to some degree egg rolls and spring rolls as well) is a noticeable lack of meat and an overwhelming amount of veggies.  These appetizers are text book cases of unbalanced dishes.  However, the potstickers at J.Liu were pleasantly packed with meat.  They were quite tasty.  For her entr√©e, Katina settled on the spicy chicken with a side of fried rice.  \\n\\n\\nWhile the dish was tasty, Katina did not feel there was any spiciness to the dish at all.  But the dish came with an abundance of sauce, which is a great way to get on Katina's good side (the girl loves her sauces). \\n\\n\\n\\nI ordered the Pasta Diavolo, which was quite delicious.  The spicy cream sauce was decidedly not spicy, but still flavorful.  What surprised me the most was the amount of meat in the dish.  Usually an entr√©e like this one would have a ton of pasta and a couple of scraps of meat, but in this case I actually needed more pasta since I ran out.  We decided to indulge in some dessert on this occasion, so Katina ordered a piece of key lime pie and I ordered a piece of chocolate flourless cake.  The key lime pie was very good, but I found the cake to just be average.  I am not a huge chocolate cake fan, so I might not really be the best qualified person to rate this particular dessert.\\nHigh marks:  Great appetizer, tasty entrees  \\nLow marks:  Spicy dishes not actually spicy, chocolate cake uninspiring \\n\\nValue:  Grade A-:  J.Liu almost made me part with one of my Benjamins, but for the quality of food, and the fact we had drinks, appetizers, and dessert, the price was not too bad.  If you were so inclined, you could probably make it out of J.Liu with a reasonable bill.

The onion tart - very nice crust, mainly lots of melting soft onions a deep brown from cooking, and finally the steak tartare, which is tasty with lots of extra flavours, but I like my tartare meatier rather than hidden in other flavours.\\n\\nLike I said, this definitely filled us up, but the desserts sounded excellent so we went for the lemon tart.

I came here with a friend and ordered a ton of small tapas and desserts.  We started off with the Ostras Marisqueria, which is a selection of west/east coast oysters with chalaquita, rebano-mango and Nikki salsas.  We ordered a half dozen oysters and got them in a variety.  They were all fantastic and all the salsas were all wonderful and full of flavor.  We tried the Empanadas de Carne which is flaky pastry filled with slow cooked beef, raisins, and Botija olives.  This was the best tapa we ordered.  It was absolutely outstanding.  The beef was moist and full of flavor, the raisins gave a bit of sweetness and the olives just brought the flavors together.  I highly recommend getting this.  We also tried the Wantanes de Mariscos which is fried seafood wontons served with an aji Amarillo-tamarind sauce.  This was also fantastic.  The fusion of your classic wonton with a Peruvian twist makes this one of a kind.  The sauce was sweet, tangy and savory. I've never had a sauce quite like it, but it was great! We ordered the Conchas a la Parmesana which is bay scallops baked with Grana Padano cheese and lime butter.  This is a simple dish filled with bay scallops soaked in lime butter and a nice crust of melted Parmesan cheese over the top.  The scallops were soft and sweet and the cheese accented the scallops perfectly.  We tried the Morada which is Peruvian purple potato and shredded chicken breast with aji Amarillo Mixta Nikkei Yukon potato, spicy tuna and crab salad, topped with crispy breaded prawn. This is a tapa I would highly recommend trying.  This was one fantastic potato salad full of flavor!  The chicken and crab salad worked perfectly in the elegant dish.  We also tried one of their specials.  I don't know the name of the dish but it was made ceviche style with raw white salmon sashimi style with a mix of shredded red onions, thinly sliced carrots and corn bathed in a light vinegar based dressing.  This was fabulous and a must order for anyone who loves sushi.  Now if this wasn't enough, we also ordered desserts!  We ordered the Sorbet O Helado Del Dia which was gelato style ice cream or fruit sorbet of the day.  This was awesome, fruity, and refreshing.  We also tried their flan which was accompanied with their fresh fruit sorbet and Peruvian nuts!  I have no idea how they prepare their nuts, but it was out-of-bounds!  I never had anything like it but very flavorful and the flan was very delicate, creamy and down right delicious!  Very highly recommended for dessert.  Overall, this is a fabulous place to try a variety of high quality tapas in a festive and friendly environment.  The restaurant is very busy and loud and they maximize every inch of space they have.  This place does feel crowded as you are seated very close to other neighboring diners.  Our waitress was one of the best I've ever had.  She explained the menu and specials with great detail and made some wonderful recommendations for tapas and desserts.

Very convenient, minus the weird parking lot."},{"name":"Bouldin Creek Cafe","address":"1900 S 1st St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I am writing in response to Kris' review because I think that she is mistaken.  I have been a regular at Bouldin Creek off and on since they opened almost 10 years ago.  While I agree that Bouldin Creek is not always the cleanest, most spacious coffeeshop (there are rumors that they are moving to a brand new, much larger location just blocks away!), and that the service may not meet every customer's expectations, her comments on the owner are disconcerting.  I honestly believe that she is confused about who the owner is.  Leslie is the one of the most genuinely kind people I know.  She is always talking to the customers, seems to know most by name, and I have personally seen her go above and beyond to make sure every visiting customer leaves happy.  I have seen her handle difficult customers on several occasions with total respect, so I find it extremely hard to imagine that she would ever be rude to a customer.\\nI live in the neighborhood and work downtown.  I stop by Bouldin Creek several times a week for my double latte.  I wear typical office attire (as do the other customers I see in there in the mornings), and have never witnessed any attitude, nor have I ever received any.  I am not saying that Kris did not - however, I seriously doubt that it had anything to do with here attire, and most definitely did not involve Leslie the owner.\\n\\nPS - THIS IS NOT A FAST FOOD RESTAURANT.  They make all of their food fresh per order, so you can expect to wait a little longer if you go during lunch time, or any time it is busy.  The way I see it, because I do not have to wait to be seated, the amount of time between ordering my food and receiving it balances out with restaurants where you have to wait to get a table."},{"name":"Bison County BBQ Bar & Grille","address":"275 Moody St","city":"Waltham","stars":"3.5","text":"While I really want to like this place, especially since my favorite Waltham joint, Jake Dixie's Roadhouse closed 2+ years ago, I can't help but expect and want more out of this place. And I'm not alone either, as my significant other and my friends had the same comments based on our visits there.\\n\\nAnd it's a shame really, especially considering how little competition they have in the area, Blue Ribbon aside. They have a great location, right near the top of Moody Street, with a ton of parking lots and street parking available. They have the space, with 30+ tables and a long bar as well. They have a great craft beer selection as well. But the big issue here is with the service and the food.\\n\\nFirst off, the food is very average. I've sampled all kinds of things there, from their wraps to their bison tips and their BBQ plates, and most of it is bland or very average at best. But the kicker here is that in most instances, they charge a few bucks too many for their dishes.\\n\\nAn example of such is their appetizers. Some are as cheap as $4.95 but most are $8.95 and more. $9 for a cup of chili? Seems pretty steep to me. Their fried pickles ($5.95) are decent, but few come in the serving. On the upside, most of them are eas to share although their spinach and artichoke dip ($8.95) wasn't all that great when I had it last week.\\n\\nTheir entrees aren't much better, and I was not a huge fan of their ribs. Their pulled pork sandwich ($9.95) isn't all that great either, and their Bozeman bison tips ($17.95)  were dry and again, bland. Even the sides are average at best.\\n\\nAll in all, it just seems like the place strive on serving very average food at a premium. Their service isn't all that attentive either and all in all, it quickly loses it's appeal. Every single time I've seen the bill there I felt like it wasn't a good value at all. So while they have a great craft beer selection, the rest leaves to be desired including the inconsistent service which often times is inattentive and slow.\\n\\nMeh."},{"name":"Sushi Me","address":"3655 SW Hall Blvd","city":"Beaverton","stars":"3","text":"Very friendly and nice service.

Ordering becomes easy when you filter out the flavors and textures of donuts you're looking for. I can't do filing and fruity flavors, so I got the Triple Chocolate Penetration (chocolate donut, chocolate glaze, coco puffs on top). The donuts wasn't anything spectacular, but I still liked what I was eating. There were no surprises and nothing to dislike. My friend got the Homer (strawberry yogurt glaze on a regular donut with sprinkles on top), which again wasn't anything spectacular. The shop being 24/7 is very convenient, and my friend and I went at 9:45 PM which meant little line. So my suggestion would be is to come prepared, bring cash, and go odd hours.

It was a pretty pleasant experience, I wouldn't say great, but it was good. We shared the beef tartar, the pate board, the crab dip, and the perogies. Our favorites were the beef tartar (best I've ever had in my life and I order it a lot), and the pate board. The crab dip was WAY too salty (it's not on the menu anymore), and the perogies were just OK. They are known for their pate and charcuteries, so I'm not surprised at how much we enjoyed them. The service on our first visit was a little slow and nervous, but in general fine. \\n\\nOur second visit (last Friday), was better than the first, and what really made me feel like I could put Townsman in my regular restaurant rotation. We ordered the beef tartar again (still the best), the country pate a la cart (came with biscuits, pickled veggies & a mustard that was TO DIE FOR), the scallops with bak choy and tom yum broth, and the sucking pig. Everything was very very good. I love the bold flavors and how they incorporate a lot of Asian flavors. The service was much better and friendly and efficient this time. A bonus was that chef Matt Jennings was there himself cooking in the kitchen, and he was super friendly and explained a few menu items to us. \\n\\nIf I had to nit pick, I would say the only negative is that their cocktail menu is super strange (for my personal taste), lots of vegetable and other odd ingredients. I ended up ordering a standard cocktail which was well made so that was fine, but I think it would be nice if they could expand their cocktail menu. Their wine list is very good though. \\n\\nIn general, I am just so glad to have more good restaurant options in my neighborhood, and glad to have a chef driven and creative restaurant like Townsman here."},{"name":"Poor Calvin's","address":"510 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"The chicken and macaroni and the fried goat cheese are simply great for the soul.

I will start with the good. The service was great. It was a little loud, possibly because we were next to a huge party at the big community table but most of the restaurant seemed pretty loud. The drinks were nice and got us going. The calamari appetizer was amazing. I tried a piece of my friends steak and it was also cooked how she ordered, tender, and juicy. The Cesar salad had an interesting spicy dressing and generous in portion. However, I did not like my entree which was a scallop and shrimp dish. The Gouda grits didn't taste like much of anything but water and cornmeal and were described completely different from the taste. Wasn't a fan of the red sauce that came with it either. The scallops on the dish were also just okay. I tried my friends chicken and it was flavorless. We did not order dessert but overall I would try this place again and order different things.

Thyere seemingly down the middle, a few eople loved it, a few people hated it.  On the way there, saw a neighbor and said were going to check out xlb and she said, stuff was too small for the price. I;d rather have good quality vs. large portions of crap.  \\n\\nBegin review, asked girl at counter whats vegetarian? Ordered mushroom bao zi, green beans, chinese cabbage and cold sesame noodles with tofu. $34- with tip $40. I kinda hate tipping at the register not knowing what I'm in for,so hard to want to leave 20% but dont want to be cheap.\\n\\nThe food came up pretty fast, it was end of lunch, people working seemed in ok spirits, so not a weird negative vibe or anything.  \\n\\nFirst thing to come up was Bao zi. First bite for both my wife and I, yuck its ground meat. Pretty nasty and pretty much the worst thing you can do to a vegetarian. Its not a strictly veg joint, so yeah its a possibility but come on, its Williams. Someone apologized (what else can you do?) My wife had a shatty look on her face from the bite of meat and I said chill out its done. We hate seeing food thrown out as well. \\n\\nGreen beans came, they were good,just green beans,cooked well, at $9 a little steep but I had heard they were small so...  The chili oil at the tables is excellent!\\n\\nCold Sesame noodle dish was ok.  Had apricot kernals which was cool and an interesting flavor. The noodles were pretty good and there were only a few (which is not bad for me as I would rather have more veg.)  The noodle salad needed more oil, a little too much acid. It was pretty fresh though. \\n\\nThe greens were just some kind of choi with little garlic chunks, it was pretty basic but fresh, not overcooked,and pretty good. \\n\\nThe bao came and I can say that I really enjoyed the bao with the sauce and chili oil. I'm not an expert like the soup dumpling nerds on here but I have had bao before. The dough was not too thick and they were cooked well. the flavors with the sauce and chili together made me pretty happy though and i can see myself going to get that alone for a snack, granted I will be dropping the word vegetarian multiple times and checking my order by tearing before I run off. \\n\\nI know they havent been open long, Im not bao master, and they have no veg soup dumplings. I was going to give 2 stars for the meat bite and I should as I think meat eaters are dildos and are missing a chromosome and/or lack empathy. Its 2017 people.  That being said the mushrrom chive bao was really good and the vegetables were good but maybe $7 side good. So I gave 3 stars. Would been a 4th aside from the meat mistake which isnt good, lots and lots of conscious awake individuals these days that care about what they eat."},{"name":"Mary Mac's Tea Room","address":"224 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"We were very excited to try Mary Mac's due to the amazing reviews on yelp but were disappointed in the food.

The rolls were great but I really didn't need them on top of the salad and dinner.\\n\\nMy main course was pasta saccottino.  It was zesty italian sausage folded in tiny pasta purses  They were partially covered with marinara sauce.

I may update later.\\n\\nI did 5-star enjoy myself during my first excursion to Dugan's, which I did not even know existed.  I would still not know it existed were it not for my failure to pay attention on my way to meet my sister at the Clermont Lounge.  My friend and I parked in the wrong lot, and since I haven't been to the ol Clermont in a while (and he had never been), I just migrated to the nearest door.  We walked in and it didn't quite feel right, but I was calling/texting my sister and somehow I was just not thinking about it.  \\n\\nI was about to actually say \\"huh, they really redid this place\\" when a server came up to us and said \\"where are you trying to go?\\"  And I think my friend or I said \\"uh, are we in the wrong place?\\" To which he said \\"I guaranTEE you're in the wrong place.\\"  So I looked around and for the first time saw that my friend and I were the only white people in there.  Which neither of us minded - I was just embarrassed that I was there on accident.  The server looked at us and said \\"you're going to the Clermont Lounge, aren't you?\\"  We laughed and nodded, and he very courteously walked us out and pointed to the correct location.\\n\\nAfter a fun couple of hours at the Clermont, it was getting hot in there (*read: foreshadowing/irony*) so I suggested to my friend that we \\"go back to that place we accidentally went earlier.\\"  He wholeheartedly agreed, and I mean, our car was there.  So we walked back in, on purpose this time.\\n\\nDugan's is a nice contrast to the Clermont.  Lots of space above your head, as opposed to the low, haphazard, black-painted basement ceilings in the Clermont.  A nice big low-seated central bar reminiscent of a diner, with spinny chairs and plenty of room.  The servers/bartenders are actually friendly (I admit that the sometimes-rough staff is an integral part of the Clermont's character, but good service at night spots is rare and always a pleasant surprise).  The rest of the clientele is also friendly.  Oh, and, no naked fat women.\\n\\nAfter ordering my gin and tonic from a very good-looking and polite bartender, we noticed that the flawless rendition of \\"Rappers Delite\\" we had been listening to was coming from a middle-aged woman.  That song is REALLY long, and I was impressed.  But I was also kind of jealous, because rapping at karaoke is MY SHTICK.  \\n\\nA little later, some guy approached my friend and me, and said \\"you look like a happy couple - this next song's from me to you.\\"  We are in reality not a couple, but we couldn't bear to burst this guy's bubble.  When he got up there, he serenaded us in his great voice with this slow, empassioned ballad.  Which was of course hilarious and awesome.  We moved closer to the stage to listen.  \\n\\nAlthough I had not been planning on doing karaoke, this guy's generosity had inspired me.  I went and grabbed the binder when he had finished.  The KJ was about to tell me that they weren't taking any more songs, but then they were like \\"We'll let you sing, you'll be the last song.\\"  They told me I had 5 minutes to pick, but I didn't need 5 minutes.  I flipped straight to one of my staple songs, Nelly's Hot in Herre.  They cracked up at me when I pointed to it.  I then tried to get one of them to agree to do the girl part (\\"I am getting so hot, I want to take my clothes off...\\").  No one agreed to do this.  \\n\\nAlthough I didn't get to actually check out the song list, it was a really thick binder, and the music thus far had sounded good to me.  To be sure, it seemed like a different list from the karaoke nights I usually patronize, but honestly I get really sick of \\"Total Eclipse of the Heart\\" and \\"Sweet Caroline.\\"  Also, even though it was a Saturday night, it didn't seem like there was an hour long wait to sing, which is awesome.  \\n\\nOK, so I get up on stage, and they start playing my song.  Some tall guy took the second mike and backed me up by doubling me on the emphatic parts, which was AWESOME and made me feel like a legit rapper (although he did not do the girl part for me).  I think there may even be photographic evidence of this. The funnest I've ever had singing \\"Hot in Herre,\\" hands down - and, um, I've sung it a ton.  \\n\\nAfter breaking it DOWN on stage, I felt like I had exercised my way to earning a nut brown crown at Zesto for a nightcap.  We barely made it in time to hit the drive through.  Mmmm.  Great time."},{"name":"Launderette","address":"2115 Holly St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Went back again.

They have huge burlap bags you can see, and I've heard her mention to a customer that inquired about spicier chai teas that she currently is preparing some and they're stored in the freezer at the moment. They sell whole coffee beans, which you can see on display on a shelf to the left when you enter, and they also sell French presses and some other products.

After visiting yesterday, I left scratching my head wondering why anyone MUST visit this place.  The food while not bad, was certainly nothing special. My friend and I split the 4 Piece Fried Chicken and Pork Chops done 2 ways (fried and blackened).  For sides we got the Mac and Cheese, Steamed Cabbage, Tomatoes and Okra and Broccoli. Also if it is your first time there you get a free \\"Pot Likker\\" appetizer.\\n\\nStarting off with the free appetizer the Pot Likker, which consists of collard greens cooked in salt water. I get that it's free, but WTF is this and how does this consist of an appetizer? This was a horrible start to the meal and made me question the legitimacy of the whole place. Does Ms. Mary Mac really want first time customers starting off their experience with that and has anyone ever \\"likked\\" that pot?\\n\\nBut I digress, back to the main events. The fried chicken was good but there are a lot of places in Atlanta that do very good fried chicken (South City Kitchen and Lunch on Main) and was on par with Harold's and even (gasp) Popeye's and Publix fried chicken. \\n\\nThe pork chops were mixed; I really enjoyed the blackened one, while the fried one lacked any real flavor. We also got a side of the pepper gravy which was delicious. I'm pretty sure it was 95% heavy cream, which is obviously going to taste amazing.\\n\\nMoving onto sides, the Mac and Cheese was a huge disappointment. Not sure what type of cheese or cream was used, but it was all curdled underneath the golden crust on top. Pretty gross. Not sure how anyone could screw up Mac and Cheese, I'm pretty sure my 4 year old nephew could make better Mac and Cheese. The rest of the sides were all fine, nothing special, but overall pretty solid.\\n\\nQuick sidenote on service, our waitress was amazing! Very friendly and patient and had a very comforting voice. I think her name was Chanel. \\n\\nLooking back, I guess I kind of get why people like Mary Mac's, its old and has been around for awhile, but if you want to eat amongst old things that have been around for a while, go eat dinner at the Fernbank Museum.

Got  the half chicken plate. Sides were mac-n cheese and fried plantains. The mac was fine, but nothin' to write the folks at home about. The plantains, on the other hand, were! Hot, sweet, and irresistible. They didn't survive the trip home. They were carmelized, smooth/creamy, and had a hint of some spice I couldn't place. Maybe pinocillo? YUM!\\n\\nThe feature here is the chicken. It was marinated in lots of spices and lime juice (I'm guessing). It was juicy, plump, and its seasonings were a nice change from the usual rotisserie chicken I'm used to. It came with 2 different sauces. One was white creamy stuff and the other a green, spicy one. I mixed the two together and it came out \\"Just Right\\". I got corn tortillas with it. (They DO serve tortillas.) Nice thick ones, seemingly homemade. \\n\\nThe service was bunny quick and super friendly. The owner even came to the window to say \\"Hi\\". The clerk at the window was an adorable, sweet kid who nearly blinded me with his gorgeous Pepsodent smile.  \\n\\nI thought $12 was a bit high for one dinner thru the drive thru.

We typically avoid burger franchises and tend to stick to locally owned businesses but because of what she was told about the food, we thought we'd give them a try.\\n\\nWhen we arrived, the first thing I noticed was that they chose an odd location in Waterford Lakes. If you have ever been to Waterford you know that some areas are harder than others to access in heavy traffic. They did not pick a good location to put their business in my opinion due to traffic flow and parking.\\n\\nThe inside was rather large but there is one area with very few tables which seemed odd for a dining area of this size. You place your order and they give you a number and then your food is brought to you. She chose the regular Spicy Jalapeno Baja with a regular Buffalo Fires with a cup of water and I tried the Large Avocado Club with a regular smashfries and a Peanut Butter and Jelly Milkshake. $23.00 and change seemed a bit excessive for what we ordered so I was expecting some great food for this price.\\n\\nFirst I was brought my milkshake and I will admit, it was one of the best milkshakes I have ever tried. I have had this same style milkshake from several other places but this was the best PBnJ version I have had. The best part was how small pieces of the peanut butter came through the straw and melted on your tongue. Well done...\\n\\nMy wife loved her burger but since Jalapeno's and I don't get along well, I took her word for it. Her favorite part was the fresh Jalapeno's. Her fries were well cooked but were far from \\"Buffalo style\\" because they skimped on the spicy seasoning. My burger was cooked well but...  The mayo was overpowering the avocado and they did not spread out the avocado so it was just like a single lump. I had one bite where there was no mayo and that was great. 86 the mayo or just put it on the side guys. The smashfries had a great flavor but too much oil on them. A light toss with the rosemary oil would have been better. \\n\\nAfter our meal my wife noticed she forgot to give me a $2.00 off coupon when I was at the register. I let the cashier know and the manager came right over and took it off my meal. He handled the situation very well and I let him know about the quality of service one of his employees was providing to keep the dining area spotless. I was up front with him of the assessment of our dining experience and let him know I would be posting a review. He was very humble and seemed genuinely interested in what I will post. \\n\\nSummary: The food had some minor issues but nothing too severe but I just feel they have priced their food too high given that it is not a full service restaurant.

We were going to head over to Flip Side at Easton (which btw, is AWESOME - I will add a review for that!), but traffic was crazy, so figured we'd eat here instead.  \\n\\nWe stood in the aisle waiting to be seated for five minutes, even though there were 4 tables open.  Before being seated, NO ONE that worked there looked at us.  I was staring intently at anyone who came close to us, trying to make eye contact.  I would share that they were actually trying to avert making eye contact, maybe because that haven't been trained at all on how to engage a customer?  I really don't have a clue on that issue - but it does happen at this restaurant.  \\n\\nOnce seated, we sat for about 10 minutes before our waiter came by.  He said he'd be right back... so another 5 minutes go by and he does come back, finally.  If you have kids, you know that waiting is always a challenge, especially when hungry.  They should have crackers or something, if their service is going to be so slow.  Anyway, we ordered 3 meals, and 3 waters.\\n\\nBTW, while this time is passing, and we were waiting for our waiter to show up to get the order, I notice two tables that got seated after us have had a different waitress come by - they both had drinks, and had ordered.  \\n\\nAfter 10 minutes, no joke, our waters came.  Now, our waiter was exceptionally dim (no joke), but really, how long does filling 3 glasses with ice and water take?\\n\\nAfter that, 10 more minutes, and our food arrives.  Mostly correct, they forgot the mac n cheese - but were surprisingly quick to bring that out when I let them know we were still in need of it.  The food was good, not gonna lie - but the kids stuff, mac n cheese, corn dogs, etc. are like Gordon Food Service and Kraft - certainly not worth the money - but easier than making I guess. So from the time we drove up to got our total order was almost an hour.  I bet the chain has a goal to do this in 15 minutes or less - maybe 20.  So not close here.  \\n\\nWe also ordered shakes, and they are good also.  If this review was just based on food, I'd give then a 3, maybe 3.5, but the service is so poor that even a star is hard to give them - I would literally give this place a \\"no star\\" if that were possible based on the incredibly poor service. \\n\\nOne final note, both the tables I mentioned that were seated after us, got served, and left, before our food showed up.

Reservations were for 7:30. It was just 4 of us. My husband and I got there at 7:35. My best friend and her boyfriend arrived at 7:43 since they only had ONE person working valet things were moving slow at the parking deck. Once my friend arrived all smiles... The hostess stated that they released our table. To who?? Casper the ghost and friends because no one was in the restaurant??? The disgruntled hostess seated us after a few mins wait and then proceeded to say that they might put a $35 cake cutting fee on our bill because my friend bought a very small box of cupcakes into the restaurant. Well inspector gadget..we were not planning to eat them..I was taking them home..part of my gift. She could have delivered the message without being nasty about it. The waiter dropped off water and never came back. So around 8:15 we were moved to another table. The new waiter was very pleasant. We ordered drinks...took about 30 mins. The bartendar must have been fresh out of school or in training...everyone's drinks were horrible. Ordered food took about 45 mins. We started eating at 9:30pm. The food was okay but truly nothing to brag about. The greens had too much garlic, the spinach was salty, the short ribs were average and the salmon had the skin on it. Just looking around you could see that everyone was disgruntled at the service. The only positive was our waiter, Carrell and the guy who took our dishes, Lambo. He actually entertained us for a moment since it was my birthday and I shared his mom's name. Those guys were working with what they had. I don't think I will go back! My best friend felt as if she had to make everything up to me. It was not her fault. Did I mention we had sitters for our 2 little ones and we were so excited to be going out during the week.

We were of course not interested in any of those things, only DOUGHNUTS! \\n\\nThere was a manageable line outside the original location which has been the subject of many food shows and documentaries so we joined it and started people watching. Every size, shape and color wanted to partake in what has been described as an euphoric journey into the doughnut world and I don't blame them one bit! Of course I looked like I belonged in the line with my pot belly and under-dressed attire for the weather (shorts and t-shirt). While waiting we were talked up by one of the Voodoo Doughnut denizens explaining some of their creations, offering up suggestions and revealing what's really inside the c&b doughnut (can't say what c&b stands for because I might violate some terms or something, look it up!). I'd have to say with all those distracting factors in play, it seemed like the wait was nothing at all.\\n\\nFinally we whipped our way inside the small doughnut shop only to be greeted by pink walls, a few chandeliers and decor that seemed to belong in a museum of the macabre. Yes it was odd but I was seeing much much more behind the counter on countless rolling racks. I was finally called up to the counter and reluctantly gave my order because I wanted them all but didn't want to look like a complete sow! I asked for a \\"Grape Ape\\", \\"Arnold Palmer\\" and a few t-shirts because I was not about to bring a dozen doughnuts on a plane as I was requested to do by family.\\n\\nThe doughnuts were amazing in their own special ways. First off I sunk my teeth into the Grape Ape, it was like grape soda was mixed into the frosting without the bubbles while grape powder and grape sprinkles adorned the top. It was literally one of the best doughnuts I'd ever tasted! I should've waited a while to partake in the Arnold Palmer but my inner and outer fat kid said NO WAY!

We ended up finding multiple eggplants, all of them being raw. We showed this to our waiter who went to the kitchen and then came back and said, \\" yeah they're a little undercooked.

They made more comments and at this point it made us really uncomfortable. We were seated by the window so we heard everything, and I'm sure they didn't care if we heard. Completely ruined our experience. Management needs to address this issue as I noticed there are several reviews regarding tip bullying. Nobody is REQUIRED to leave a tip.

Here is why:\\n\\nCoconut Cafe is one of my favorite spots in the Newton-Brighton area for Thai food, and I have been coming here for over ten years now. Since I graduated two years ago and moved back to the area, I have sometimes averaged weekly takeout dinner here during busy times at work. I consider myself a regular, and the food quality always keeps me coming back.\\n\\nI am currently boycotting Coconut Cafe because my last experience left a bad taste in my mouth. I consider myself someone who respects and has great interest in other cultures and ethnic food, but one time I called and when I asked for the sweat & sour sauce that comes with the spring rolls, they bitterly responded, \\" this isn't a Chinese food restaurant.\\" I know that... but the sauce is well, sweet.. and sour. They also didn't tell me what alternative name to use. I was embarrassed until I went to Amarin Cafe, another Thai food restaurant in Newton and they called it sweet and sour sauce.\\n\\nLast week, I ordered pad thai and the tom yum soup for pick up. I asked them for the total and they said 19 dollars. Felt a bit high. When I got to the restaurant to pick up my dinner, I asked for the sweet sauce that comes with the spring rolls. She brought a different sauce than the one I was thinking of. So I kindly say, \\"No, the other one, please.\\" The woman brought me A-NOTHER one, so now I had two sauces, neither of which I wanted. I apologized for the confusion, and told her I wanted the other sauce, not another. Now, she was pissed off. After swiping my card, she condescendingly looked me in the face and dictated as if I was deaf, \\"do you want the receipt?\\" The couple behind me stood up for me and told the woman, \\"Hey, maybe you are having a bad day, but that's no way to treat your customers.\\" I left and unpacked my dinner at home, only to find that they had given me TWO tom yum soups. No wonder the cost was so high...\\n\\nThe moral of the story is that sometimes miscommunication happens.

The burger was good for take-out, i picked it up and walked home and it was still hot and delicious. The poutine was also good, not much to say here basically just cheese fries, done well. What i will say is the burger menu could be more creative, they really jack up the price of a single paddy and the burger toppings were scant (no lettuce or tomato). The amount of cheese curd on the poutine was good, but i could have used more, the gravy on the other hand was more then enough.

While I understand it is a fire hazard and you're not allowed to block the doorway there are no signs or any sort of communication from the employees to the customers unless they are screaming at them for holding open open the door or blocking the door (they have a crap setup).

However, if I am going to partake in some Italian fare it MUST be worth my while...and it MUST be at the Sicilian Restaurant and Pizzeria. \\n\\nI discovered this place through some friends who suggested we do dinner there one night. After eating one of their delicious, melts in your mouth garlic knots I was hooked. These AMAZING little bread rolls drizzled with olive oil and always served hot come with every meal and you're guaranteed to eat so many of these things that you won't be able to finish or sometimes even eat your meal. This happens to me every time I go there. \\n\\nThe other items on their menu are equally as phenomenal. For an appetizer, I highly recommend the mozzarella caprese. With thick slices of fresh buffalo mozzarella cheese on top of a thick, ripe tomato slice and drizzled with olive oil what's not to love? For your main dish, the baked ziti is to die for. It comes out smokin' hot and oozing with cheese and tomato sauce. If pizza is what you like most, they do a good job with this too. The crust is not too thick, but the right consistency to hold all of the sauce, cheese and toppings without getting soggy or droopy while consuming it. And if you'd prefer a dish that is more protein based, their chicken and veal dishes are all very tasty. \\n\\nLike most Italian restaurants, the portions are huge, which means you will usually have enough to take home for the next day. They carry the usual Italian dessert options, but tiramisu is the way to go. All of the servers are very nice and the owner is usually on site helping his staff in some manner. \\n\\nSeating is limited because this place isn't very big, but I've never encountered too long of a wait because they do a good amount of take out business as well.

This was our 2nd visit, as we tried them shortly after they opened & weren't impressed w/ food or service that time, either. We wanted to give it another shot. Won't be doing that again.\\n\\nWe arrived & were greeted/seated promptly - so far so good. After about 5 mins, someone dropped off chips and salsa. At least 5 mins after that, manager came up & asked if we'd been helped. We still hadn't ordered drinks, but we'd been sitting there for 10+ mins & were completely ready to order. No biggie, we thought - just an oversight. The food came out quickly & correctly - other than i'd asked for no jalape√±os & they were still there -  it was just bland. For a place w/ reasonably hot salsa as the only option w/ chips, that surprised me. It was just very - okayish. Not worth the price, even though it was moderately priced.  \\n\\nThe margaritas are big & you can only taste the tequila. If that's your thing, you'll like them, but I personally like the flavor of the actual margarita, too.  I didn't finish mine b/c of that. \\n\\nWe finished our food & our plates were cleared away not long after. At this point, they were closing in less than an hour, so I thought they'd be prompt in getting the ticket to us. After about 10 mins of sitting at an empty table, Waiting for them to either bring the ticket or see if we wanted dessert, I decided to go find someone. As I was getting up, they finally came up to us and handed us the tkt w/out a word. Full disclosure - we were asked if we needed anything else by a waiter we'd not seen before - but not until after we'd already paid & were leaving. \\n\\nThey really could not have cared less that we were there.  Considering that there are so many other options nearby, that's probably not a good feeling to give guests that have chosen your establishment. \\n\\nI worked in restaurants for a long time & bad service is really inexcusable to me.  I can deal w/ and even enjoy mediocre food if the service & atmosphere is good.  And it's not like I expect a lot. General courtesy is good enough for me. We didn't get that here. \\n\\nLike I said - if you want to have big margaritas that taste like straight tequila (and a sports bar vibe w/ a restaurant added as a second thought), this is the place for you. It's just not the place for me when I want good Mexican food. \\n\\nAlso, you should note that the door to the patio opens into the main dining area & the smell of smoke completely takes over the room every time the door opens. And we were sitting on the far wall from the door. Not pleasant for anyone allergic or that chooses to sit inside to avoid that kind of thing. Since the patio is covered, it just all stays in that little area. Maybe they need to get fans to direct smoke away from the doors? Seems easy enough - it was overpowering, though, so they need to figure out something.\\n\\nVery disappointed, won't be giving them a 3rd try."},{"name":"Susu Bakery Boutique","address":"575 Washington St","city":"Wellesley","stars":"3","text":"Susu gets 5+ stars for sure!

Best of all, it wasn't outrageously expensive. I think we all dropped about $20 which as dinner, drinks and dessert in Boston goes is dirt cheap. This place rocks.

Odd. \\nWednesdays are Whiskey Wednesdays where they have deals on a plethora of whiskey...not a bad deal. \\nIt seems as though this place has become less crowded over the years...perhaps due to menu and pricing change?

I and eleven Foodie members went to lunch at Andina on Saturday, February 25th, 2012 at 12 pm.  We were giving two round tables that seated six Foodies each table.  Andina has separate entrance in a building where it shares with several businesses in the trendy Pearl District; however; you still need to climb about ten steps to get to the bar and dining area.  As you reach the dining area, there will be a bar where you check in and guide to your table that is in the back.  It is an open space but divided by low dividers, plans and decoration to create two separate spaces, one for drinking and casual dining and one for formal dining that requires reservation.  Andian has the best looking waiters and waitresses I've seen to date.  They were in required attire, white shirt, black pants and long black apron.  The waiters and waitresses are very professional.  They learned to pronounce Peruvian dishes, what are in the dishes and how they are prepared and they are more than happy to explain the dishes to you.  These information are very helpful when you have never have Peruvian cuisine.  \\n\\nFor our table, we decided to order a medium plate each member that cost $19 a plate and share among our selves.  We ordered Quesos Artesanos Con Membrillo.  It came with three different type of artisan cheese, quince jam and cancha.  It was delicious but the portion was small.  This was like tasting the dishes among the five of us.  Next came the Chorizo that is the chilled and sliced cured Spanish sausages.  Again, the portion was small.  It also was more tasting the dishes among the five of us.  We also ordered Picadillo Acebichado, which is not a meat dish at all, Serreano which is sliced cured ham and Ensanlada Verde Peruana.  They were good but the portion was small to share among five people.  One of our Foodie members is Vegetarian.  She ordered a Vegetarian dish that was  large portion and was delicious.  Her dish was the best of the dishes that were ordered at our table.  If you are a Vegetarian or Glutton free, Andina is the best place to go to.  We had dessert as well.  We ordered Chocolate Andina, three pieces of very rich and condensed brownies and Mousse De Valle Y Selva, layer of expresso mousses, chocolate ganache served in a tall glass.  It was a better dessert of the two.\\n\\nAll in all, I was not very impressed with Andina food.  It was good, fresh, well prepared and artfully display.  If anything, I was very impressed with the experience of an upscale and well review restaurants.  To me, $40 for lunch is very steep.

I finished mine in no time, but my group didn't enjoy the taste of their dogs, so they gave them to me, and they were okay, not much flavor in the chili, the only real flavor I could taste were the onions on one.\\n\\nI finished my fresh lemonade and my server took my glass, but never came back with a refill, and never refilled my groups beverages as well, so that kind of \\"sucked\\".

I've been to Portland a few times and have never stopped by Voodoo Doughnuts for whatever reason.  Actually, the reason being...  I'm not too big on sweets.  \\n\\nMy bf and I decided to see what the hype was all about this place.  The location is not ideal... While waiting in the long line outside, we were approached several times for spare change.  We stood in line for a good twenty minutes or so.  Finally got to the counter and we ordered five doughnuts.  2 maple bacon, a fritter, an Oreo glazed donut, and their famous voodoo doughnut (chocolate glazed donut with jelly inside).  The dough is delicious.  Fluffy and hearty... Mmmmm.... I was not aware that the voodoo donut was filled with jelly... Which definitely killed the taste of it.  The arms of the voodoo tasted great since it didn't have jelly.... But the rest of it was gross.\\n\\nThe fritter was covered with chocolate chips and peanut butter which was overkill.  I'd stick to ordering a simple donut because you get the taste of their dough, which is one of the best I've tasted.\\n\\nFive donuts came to $15 and it's cash only, FYI."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Voodoo is all hype.

As a former restaurant owner, I experienced something I never have before. Upon finishing our meal (we were a party of three) and still in the middle of conversation, the host came to our table and asked us to leave. We had been at the table for about an hour and a half.  I had already compensated the server for us not turning the table quickly.

I stopped by one Sunday afternoon for a sub and had to wait about 20 minutes even though the place was empty. The sub was ok but I could get better quality up the street in Stoneham. The thing that really bugged me was the fact that the place was being run by a bunch of teenage brats. You know the kind that snap their gum and say \\"like\\" every other word and who's future involves getting knocked up by some muscle head because their biggest talent is spreading their legs. Then there were the young men or should I say buffoons who went from sitting in the dining area, back to the kitchen where they would stick their hand in the cooler and shove something in their mouth, and then back to the dining room area to sit down and play with their phones. I may sound like a bitter old man but I am not. You just know a little punk or spoiled little brat when you see one and you know the parents are the same way.

It is extremely limited on space and you have to constantly make room for staff busing tables and coming through with carts,  people trying to squeeze by the line to use the restroom.  When you are standing in line you are virtually at other customer's tables as they are eating.  It was a bit hectic for my liking.  The cooks seemed pretty miserable.  \\n\\nThe food was fine but nothing I would wait in line for an hour to purchase.  I ordered a spinach and feta omelet.  My husband had french toast which was pretty good.  However, to me, both of our orders turned out the same as any other breakfast/diner I have been too.  The bread was only slightly on its way to being toasted as if it was so busy they couldn't afford to leave it in the toasted long enough.  I was really hoping to get a Diet Coke but the options were limited to juice or water.  \\n\\nPlus side: They put out a pitcher of lemon water for those waiting in the long line outside in the heat.\\n\\nBottom line, good but over-hyped.
