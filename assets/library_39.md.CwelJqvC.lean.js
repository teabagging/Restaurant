The dish isn't drenched in sauce like I'm typically used to nor is the sauce the bright orange color. There were a lot of pieces of pork that didn't get the sauce drizzle so you either had to dip it into another area of the plate that had the sauce or you were eating pieces of fried pork with no sauce. Overall, very disappointed in this dish. \\n\\nMy aunt raved about the noodle dishes here. In particular, the Beef and Satay Sauce Rice Noodles as well as their Wonton Noodle Soup. Personally found that both these dishes were OK.

There is a fun and inventive cocktail menu, and at $6 a drink, it was awesome.  They also offer $2 \\"snacks\\" - just small bites perfect for two people to nibble while drinking or, like us, waiting for dinner hours to start (5 p.m. on Sundays, anyway).  The hush puppies were fun, topped with smoked fish dip and a spicy tomato based sauce.  Our waitress in the bar was attentive and helpful, explaining the craft beers available and allowing us to charge other drinks to a tab at the happy hour price while we dined in the main dining room.  My husband had the cornmeal fried catfish.  He's a rather picky eater and was craving the mac & cheese, which was actually served with a separate dish.  I was pleasantly surprised that we had no problem subbing pretty much everything out for his dish to appease his tastes.  I was too tempted by the southern ramen to not give it a go ($15).  It's a medium sized dish with bacon-soy broth, homemade noodles, and thinly sliced \\"duck ham\\" with some veggies and mushrooms.  DELICIOUS!!  I absolutely devoured it.  Because hubby's mac & cheese with bacon, breadcrumbs and greens throughout was large enough to share, it made for the perfect meal.  My only gripe with the food was that the mac & cheese was too salty, but had a good flavor. We had the ice cream sandwich ($8) for dessert and it was a huge portion of chocolate shortbread cookies, soft ice cream with caramel and tons of pecans and peanuts: tasty, but not extraordinary in any way.  We didn't incur any additional charges for customizing hubby's meal, the food was served hot and fresh, the waiter took the time to explain the offerings to us; I can't complain!  The menu could use a few more sides and main dishes, but given that it is seasonal, maybe we just hit at a time when there wasn't a lot to choose from.

Based on the reviews seen here, we made a reservation.  We were wondering about parking; that was ok as there was parking in the back and across the street.  Our table was in the room with the bar.  The room was cozy and our server was knowledgeable and helpful about the wine selection.  We chose an appetizer of  fried mozzerella with garnish of squash & zucchini and ordered the steak and a ravioli dish with smoked chicken, black beans and corn.  It was all delicious.  The only downer to the whole dinner was that there was a party at the bar and they were so loud, we really couldn't talk to each other, even though we were sitting at a small table for two.  Another couple left without ordering.  A lady that I am guessing was a manager, came by to check on us and when we told her our issue, she went and asked the party to quiet down.  Based on that, we would give this restaurant a resounding 5!"},{"name":"Atlas Steak + Fish","address":"4331 Dominion Street","city":"Burnaby","stars":"4","text":"I was invited to a birthday party that was booked at Atlas so I had to go back and I think it's only fitting that I leave a review for that particular experience and how their team managed to turn things around. One of the managers, Sylvia recognized me and my friends from last time and introduced herself. We were promptly shown to our tables for which they gave us a private room. The food came out promptly this time and all of the little ones were able to eat before us which is a major factor whenever we eat out. Despite it being a busy Sunday night, we did not have to wait long. I ordered the duck breast and it was as succulent as the tenderloin that I ordered during my first visit. Sylvia came to our table 3 times to check on us and the servers were very attentive. The calamari and ahi tuna poke are amazing. I recommend ordering those for appetizer. One of my friends ordered the Double R Ranch Tomahawk steak and it was divine. If you're looking for a feast and can take on 48oz of meat, definitely try this one. Otherwise, the other steaks on the menu are good too. At the end of our dinner, we went home feeling happy that we were able to celebrate one of the kids' birthday and with good experience from Atlas this time around. Also thanks to Jenny for reaching out.\\n\\nI have to say I am deeply impressed at how the folks at Atlas managed to win us back just by acknowledging what happened last time. A lot of businesses usually just refute an undesirable review and never learn from them. The Atlas team did a great job at learning from customer feedback and showing us that they can do better, something that I and my friends truly appreciate."},{"name":"Tasty n Sons","address":"3808 N Williams Ave, Ste C, Hub Building","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"My first visit to Tasty n sons very soon after they opened and it was amazing.. unfortunately the word quickly spread and soon we had a Tin Shed/Screen door breakfast line situation at hand.

I also really liked the decor, however it was way too cold inside! Where they lost stars were 1) The prices - specifically the wine. Very over priced. When we asked how much a bottle cost we were told 4x the price of the glass; most places are at least a few dollars cheaper to buy a bottle than 4 individual glasses. We also looked up the wine after dinner and found that our $32 bottle of wine retailed for $12.99!!! Talk about a ridiculous mark up. And while the food was good, it was not anything special or unique compared to other expensive Italian restaurants. 2) The service - I also did not care for our server. While I don't think he was intentionally a jerk, he came off as a jerk. He seemed pushy especially with trying to up-sell us on things. We also felt mocked when we chose a less-expensive options of things (like the $32 bottle wine instead of the $40 bottle of wine.) We were out for a special occasion, but that didn't mean we could carelessly spend an absurd amount on dinner. I did appreciate having time to eat and relax and not feel rushed out, though.\\n\\nWhile I would not return for a full meal, I would consider going back for a GLASS of wine and some appetizers.

They'll knock down a restaurant with three stars or less just because they were served their dessert too soon!  I think that's the case with the reviews on Summer Shack.\\n\\nI went to this restaurant today for lunch and sat at the bar.  First, let me say that this restaurant is owned by famed chef and restaurateur Jasper White, and the quality and flavor of the food shows it.  They mainly specialize in seafood, complete with a raw bar, and they also have some non-seafood options such as steak, chicken, burgers, and hot dogs.  There is also a take out \\"store\\", if you will, on the side of the restaurant where you can buy fresh seafood.\\n\\nI had the Salmon Sandwich.  It came topped with wasabi mayonnaise, pea sprouts, and sesame cucumbers, with fries and a pickle on the side.  A nice light sandwich for the summer.\\n\\nFor dessert, I had their new Peaches and Cream Pie.  It's a peach pie that their dedicated pastry chef makes in-house with crumbles on top and a dollop of whipped cream on the side.  The peaches don't overpower the flavor of the pie, but rather compliment it, which I really like, since I want pie to taste like pie and not a fruit cup.  The crust was nice and solid, even on the bottom, so it didn't get soggy.  \\n\\nBoth the sandwich and dessert were awesome!!!  And the bartender who served me was very pleasant.  While I was there, I noticed that they also serve local craft beers, which is good for the beer connoisseurs.

My most recent visit, though, I made a reservation for 8. I chose the Beat Hotel because I thought it was big enough to accommodate a large group. Not really. We were seated at 4 tiny tables stuck together. It was very uncomfortable. We were also right in front of the stage, which some people would like, but was just too loud for my taste. I asked to be moved and never heard from the hostess again, even though the restaurant was not very full. \\n\\nMy wine came, and it was not right. My server argued that it couldn't be off because of the fancy system they use that keeps the wine from coming into contact with air. But I have had a lot of Hess Chardonnay and it did not taste as it should have. She didn't take it away until she saw that I was passing it around the table for people to sniff, rather than drinking it. \\n\\nThe food, of course, was great. It always is. The vegetarian options are abundant, creative and fresh.\\n\\nAnd then, although I was obviously not happy with my experience, we were charged an automatic gratuity. That makes me really mad.\\n\\nI did complain to the manager on my way out, and there was not much he could do at that point.

It's so amusing watching grown adults play games and bowl. Clearly we all still have that inner child.  \\n\\nThe restaurant and extended bar at Dave & Buster's is All-American themed and can accommodate large groups as well as families.  They offer steaks, burgers, salads, sandwiches, appetizers, desserts, seafood, chicken and pasta.  The spinach and artichoke dip is pretty decent. Watch out though, the drink selection is vast and they know how to mix them strong.  If your drinking, even if its one drink which is what I usually get, make sure you have a designated driver or plan to stay for a while. \\n\\nBeyond the restaurant, basic gaming, and the extended bar, there is a pool hall, comedy and karaoke theater.  Children often have birthday parties as well.  Realistically children under eighteen should only be taken to Dave & Buster's during the day or early evening.

Obviously the lipstick stain was not mine but it was very cool of our waiter to quickly get me a new glass without any hesitation.\\n\\nI haven't tried any other food items off the menu but I agree with Kathleen, there's something pretty awesome about their tortilla chips here.

One of my friends had ordered some kind of a lentil appetizer, it was the best of all three.\\n\\nFor main courses I had Iskender Kofte. It was fantastic but it was my least favorite of the three. If you're also a guy with an appetite just ask for a side of rice with it as well because what they serve you is delicious but not really enough. My buddy didn't want to eat his side of rice because his plate was huge so I ended up just mixing his rice into my meal and that was perfect. I forget what the other two meals were exactly but they were also fantastic.\\n\\nRice pudding for dessert was quite good, although my grandmother would always make it with more rice than that. Hers was also sweeter and much better, but this isn't my grandmom's kitchen so I won't hold it against them. Also I don't get the reason for torching the thick creamtop on it. It's not a creme brule, just make it authentic rather than burnt. So the only problem I had was: add more rice to your rice pudding, little bit more sugar and do away with torched creamtop. \\n\\nDon't go in without reservations."},{"name":"Shoal Creek Saloon","address":"909 N Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"service was not that great female waitress messed up my order and tried to blame it on my son.

This did have the effect of adding fat to the burger, but not in a pleasing manner.

It ain't cheap, but it's fair because the food is consistently very good to excellent, the space is big and roomy with a bright trattoria vibe, and it's one of the top three real Italian joints in town, to my palette.\\n\\nALL the pasta is homemade, every little bit. Prego! To me any \\"Italian\\" restaurant that serves packaged pasta is not really an Italian restaurant...yet few take the time to do it right. Primizie does and it pays off in spades, as the pasta is perhaps the best in town. Frankly, this place is damn close to Vespaio in quality, at about half the price. They'll probably do a Vespaio/Uchi and jack the prices once the crowds are constant (almost there now), but in the meantime there is value to be had in many dishes here, especially the pastas. The fettucine, ravioli and daily specials tend to be the highlights.\\n\\nThe pizzas are very fine indeed, and I love how they're cut. Top ten 'za in town, easy.\\n\\nHere's the fifth star: they've started daily \\"local menus\\", with Texas ingredients (hope it's a trend that continues spreading). Yesterday was the first day for the mango snapper appetizer. Yowsa, 'twas perhaps the best thing I've eaten in town this year. The fish was perfectly cooked, plump and moist, and the candied plum and candied bacon salsa complemented it to perfection. It was close the eyes and savor for thirty seconds good. That's what I want from food, and I'll pay for it. This dish was 15 bucks, damn expensive for an app, but I'll eat it again in the next few daze; I want that taste soon before it goes off the menu. Maybe it'll stay...\\n\\nThe trout on black risotto on the normal menu is pricey but well worth it; if anyone knows of a better risotto in Austin please let me know. This one is splendid.\\n\\nGood wine list, prices only ok. The booze margins are high in most all restaurants; if you spend on food instead of drink, your annual food bill is a lot friendlier.\\n\\nVery very good desserts from the new pastry chef; great panna cotta, for seven bucks I'd like more but it is killer. The cookies and pastries are yum plus; one of them was, on a recent visit, the best example of its sort I've ever had (last night's was weaker). Won't say what it is as I can't encourage a run on that particular item for fear of delirium tremens. Kudos to both the main and pastry chefs; you guys get it, and my taste buds thank you. Your consistency is much appreciated, to which the line-ups most nights attest.\\n\\nHaven't had a bad meal at Primizie, at its weakest it's still decent, and that's pretty rare.\\n\\nThe fact that we can walk here is pure gravy. We usually feel cramped when eating at the middle tables; last night we got a wall seat and it helped muffle the din. It's crowded and loud but that only enhances the real Italian vibe; trattorias in Napoli are not quiet! The crowd is a bit cell phony, but that goes for most everywhere these days. Sigh.\\n\\nThe service is generally good, mostly younger folks who aren't quite hip to what perfectly crisp waiting entails but are on the way. Last night we had a guy covered in tattoos; when he put the fish on the table its bright colors were overshadowed by the big letters on his hand and fist. I couldn't make them out before the flashy appendage was whisked away. But next course my peepers were poised and as the trout came down it was delivered by four fingers that said, with one letter to a digit and in no uncertain terms: S T U D.\\nIt felt good to know that we were being served by a guy who was getting all he needed. Makes for a more relaxed feeling all around.\\n\\nOne of the owners told me when they opened that they'd been testing the dishes for years with their catering biz, which explains why everything is so reliably tasty. They are to be applauded for running this place well.\\n\\nHere's hoping for more Primizie-quality spots on the eastside; the crowds are waiting. It took only a few months to get crowded because it's good. True quality is always welcome in any neighborhood. Plus, we have some real characters over here; if you sit on the Primizie patio you're likely to be treated to a joke or two from the locals who've lived down the block for generations. I've heard rumors that Primize may start a free pasta night for the homeless just like Queen Lola down the street; that would be most neighbourly indeed!\\n\\nIt's a treat to have truly fine food in the 'hood."},{"name":"Whiskey Dicks","address":"50 E Central Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Food is amazing and the atmosphere is great, perfect location!

You want to add shrimp? Go for it!  An egg? Sure!  My favorite dish is the mango fried rice.  It's ginger-y and absolutely perfect.

It comes with caramelized or crunchy onions, a pick from their selection of amazing sauces and french fries that will force you to eat every last one (my favorite sauce is the mohawk sauce). They accept debit / credit, are really great guys and serve up some fabulous burgers. Go in the morning for one of their breakfast burritos. I'm a vegetarian but love their steak burrito - they just substitute the steak for tempeh bacon and I'm all set! \\n\\nThursday nights there's usually a live band that plays in the summer and during chillier nights, they have a fire pit to sit around.

I only eat elsewhere when I'm with a big group and the wait for a table to open up at this tiny restaurant is too long and I haven't eaten anything all day to leave extra space for an impending dim sum extravaganza so RAWR#$@!! I have to eat now!!!  Usually to avoid a wait during the weekend one has to get there before 10am or have no more than two in your group and be willing to share a large table with several strangers.\\n\\nI've been eating here since the restaurant opened, and I'm pretty sure I've eaten every single thing on the dim sum menu.  In recent years they've added a helpful picture menu showing most, but not all, of the dim sum menu items.  My favorites are #28 Vegetable in Bean Curd Sheet, #31 Fried Stuffed Eggplant, and #48 Pan Fried White Turnip Cake with XO sauce.  I also advise checking out the tiny menu in the plastic holder on each table for a few specials not listed elsewhere and might be easy to overlook.  Oddly enough I've never ordered off of their \\"regular\\" menu because nothing seemed quite as tempting as the dim sum.  \\n\\nTheir portions seem a bit smaller than most other dim sum restaurants.  This is actually helpful if you happen to be eating alone since you can try more things.  And the quality is definitely there: the dumplings taste fresh and their wrappers aren't too thick yet don't rip apart when when you try to pick them up.  Winsor also serves dim sum all day.  Some of my friends think it's a bit odd and highly non-traditional to be eating dim sum for dinner.  But there's absolutely no wait during the off-hours and the food pretty much tastes the same.  Any time can be dim sum time, no?     \\n\\nI think the only thing I could wish for from Winsor is more variety.  They don't have some of the more exotic items like snails or more of the dessert items like the jellies or the sweet soups found at either China Pearl across the street or Hei La Moon.  Also over the years I've seen new dishes being offered at both of those places, but Winsor's menu has been pretty much been unchanged.  But I keep going back so clearly they are doing something right.  But do try Winsor--their dim sum menu is not small at all, so it will take you a long time before you've tried every item like I have.  And if you do go and end up sharing a table with me, please don't stare when that Asian girl can pack away more than a linebacker."},{"name":"Palmyra Mediterranean Grill","address":"10020 152 Street, Suite 167","city":"Surrey","stars":"4","text":"this restaurant has more of a fast food approach with delicious food in generous portions.  when I met my friend for lunch it was quiet enough to enjoy a great conversation.   the owners were friendly and helpful."},{"name":"Cuon - Vietnamese Street Food","address":"600 SW 4th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"By far my favorite pho ga in town.

(Better than BLG's Veni Vidi Vici!)\\n\\nWe came here because there was a Scout Mob deal. Otherwise, we would probably have never ventured up to Cheshire Bridge with all of those classy strip clubs. We had a reservation and when we arrived they informed us that a table was ready, but if we'd prefer a booth (yes, please!) they could have on ready for us in just a moment. So we had a seat at the bar and got retrogradations for dinner from the bartender, who's been there for apparently longer than forever.\\n\\nShortly after, we were shown our comfortable booth and a basket of DELICIOUS rolls were brought out. I ordered the beef and arugula salad for an appetizer and it was perfect. The beef was great, fresh arugula, and a great balance of dressing to salad. (I am very anti-having lots of dressing on my salads, so if you're a dressing lover, you may feel it is lacking. Try it though, dried beef and arugula is such a flavorful combination, it doesn't need much.)\\n\\nMatthew had a half penne serving as an appetizer, which was good, but I was so focused on my delicious salad I didn't really pay much attention when I tried it. \\n\\nFor my entr√©e, I had the pasta special which was spinach ravioli with butternut squash and ricotta. (Side note: stuffed pasta is my favorite. Were I to be stranded on a desert island for the rest of my life, this is all I'd need to keep me happy. And perhaps a volleyball. I also have a love affair with any and all fall squashes (butternut, acorn, pumpkin), so this dish and I were destined to be best friends.)\\n\\nNeedless to say, it was perfect. \\n\\nAgain, not 100% sure what Matthew ate for dinner. I was THAT focused on my delish raviolis. I'm fairly positive that it was veal Parmesan. Whatever he had, he liked it because there were not leftovers. \\n\\nWe had a cannoli for dessert, which was okay. I'm not a huge cannoli fan, but I didn't argue with the choice because I didn't have much room for the course. There was a delicious looking chocolate cake when we came in, but it had disappeared by the time it was time to order, so I'll have to snatch some of that next time.\\n\\nSomething MUST be said about the staff of Nino's. They were wonderful. From the hosts to the bartender to our waiter to the short man with the dessert cart everyone seemed to absolutely love their job (and I loved that the place wasn't staffed by a bunch of kids in high school). \\n\\nI cannot wait to go back and try some more fabulous food (and that chocolate cake! mmmm)."},{"name":"Tierra Linda Taqueria","address":"8540 Research Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"This is a great place in the shell gas station.

There isn't one single problem that causes the mediocrity here, but rather a combination of issues.\\n\\nThe investment is sizeable, with shiny new microbrew equipment in a room so clean you'd think it jumped out of a microchip fab somewhere.  That microbrew area sits at the back of the bar-half of the restaurant, giving you something shiny to look at -- but not really interesting since you don't see it doing anything.  I always felt it was a bit of a show-offy thing, saying to me: \\"maybe we're just a bit too cool for you to be here with us,\\" a feeling I occasionally got at sister restaurant Rav Pig when dining there casually, no matter the monstrosity of my bill.\\n\\nThe rest of the bar is quaint and feels a bit like a forced Turn-of-the-Century pub (or meat-packing joint, or barbershop, depending on how you viewed it, and which way you turned the menu.)  If you weren't going to sit at the bar, on one of a couple of front window tables, you were going to need to sit at long, raised, old barnwood tables, with high stools.  Good for groups.  OK for couples, but if the place was crowded, you would share your thoughts with 10 people instead of one or two.\\n\\nI didn't try much of the beer, but it was always clever.  Sometimes too clever by half.  I don't really need pumpkin and free-range zucchini in my beer, much as I do love variety in my life.  That over-creativity, a common fault of the Petrakises, if perhaps their only fault, extended to the menu, in a way that never quite caught the imagination the way it did across the street at the higher-end, though not much higher priced (as in, they're both approaching nosebleed), Ravenous Pig.  There was always a desire to adapt a dish to (or from) a Southern region of the US, pair it with something utterly unrelated, and spice or prepare in a unique way.  It was often just too much.\\n\\nYou were safe with the charcuterie tray. Always good meats and cheeses there. And you were safe with the pimiento cheese dip -- yeah, like at your supermarket, but C&L's was great -- with Ham Jam.  The late night menu got kinda sandwichey, so if you prefer to avoid the bread, you were limited.  Wine list was excellent, short, and expensive.  Even for me.  (I try to drink at slightly less than $14 a glass... but that's just me.)\\n\\n---On the Other Side--- of the place is the restaurant, and it's nice and warm and inviting with cloth tablecloths and cloth napkins and nice flatware and pretty candles at the many tables, a row of which are in the front window where you can watch everybody walking past as they enter and leave, and stand out there smoking a cigarette.  Somehow they need to rework the entrance location.\\n\\nDon't you DARE think of trying to eat in the dining room side if it's even a minute past about 9:20 p.m. because they want that sucker cleared out clean of customers by 10 p.m.  That was weird, and disappointing.  I experienced that on several visits.  Do the chefs turn into pumpkins at 10:00 p.m. if the late night menu isn't enforced by restaurateur fiat?  Once I got into the dining room and stayed a half hour over, and, yeah, I was the only one left.\\n\\nDining room menu is much fuller than the late night bar menu, and plenty of reviews here cover it.  Best choices are the variety of interesting meats.  Always well prepared, always well seasoned, and always the best grade.  Menu is slightly less exclusive than Rav Pig, slightly more casual, almost as good, and often priced equivalently.\\n\\nLots of local sourcing here if that matters to you.  To me, it matters little to not, since ranchers on the other side of the country need to earn livings as well, and the energy cost of shipment is usually less than the marginal increased energy cost of trying to produce something where it doesn't grow or live as efficiently.  (Econ 101, folks.  Sorry I burst your bubble about the world-consciousness of eating turnips grown in a back alley in College Park.)\\n\\nI can't really recommend Cask & Larder for more than one visit, and that should be a dining room visit, not a bar visit.  Take your lumps on the price and order what the server advises.  It'll be marvelous and you'll love having come there. But don't put off eating at about 300 other places in this area that are far better, more interesting, not too overly-clever, and offer better ambience, choices, preparation, and consistency.\\n\\nThree stars means A-OK by Yelp definition, and that's what Cask & Larder is.  But not one whit more. \\n\\n\\nP.S.  It shows closed but I was just there a few weeks ago for a private party.  I know eventually Ravenous Pig is moving to this spot, and Cask & Larder will have only its airport location, so consider this review as a possible preview to the Airport location."},{"name":"Hai Du Seafood Restaurant","address":"5846 NE Sandy Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"I came here with a friend of mine for lunch on Saturday afternoon.

The space itself is very open, especially since the Hub their in feels like it was a garage or designed in that aspect.

The wide stairway led up to a nicely laid out patio area with ample outdoor seating that I'm sure is a great place to lounge during the summer, however, seeing as we had just come from dancing and she had a great little dress on, I didnt want to chance the temps dropping and her being too cold so we headed on inside.\\n\\nThe large open area works well inside and even though I had made a reservation, there was plenty of space available and we probably just could have walked in, but I'm a little more..a-retentive than that so I was glad to have the reservation just in case.\\n\\nAnyway, we took a seat near the windows with a nice view of some of the skyline of Atlanta and the full moon last night and dug into the wine and food list.\\n\\nThe wine list was varied just enough to allow wine lovers from around the world to find something to please their palates. She decided to let me order for her for the first round so I wanted to make some good selections but couldn't pass up one of the wines on the menu solely based on the name: Menage a Trois Cabernet. (hey, she laughed when I told her what it was so score one for me!).  The wine was quite good and definitely could have been the supporting actor in our own dirty films, but I digress.\\n\\nWe ordered a sampling of their small plates including the Lamb Wellington, the spreads plate, and the baked brie. The spreads were all scrumptious and while she liked the baba ganoush, I took a liking to the hummus and the olive spread was flavorful as well. The baked brie was soft, gooey, nutty and flavorful. The sauce they drizzled on it added to the enjoyment and we also tried it with the strawberry they included with the plate and it actually complimented the fruit quite well.  Both of us agreed that the wine complemented the cheese quite well.\\n\\nBy that time we had both finished our first glass of wine and ordered 2 more glasses, her a nice Chianti and me a nice Pinot Noir. We moved onto the Lamb Wellington and since lamb is her favorite we had high expectations. The lamb was good, but we probably should have had it first as some of the moisture had been absorbed into the puff pastry and it was a little doughy and soggy but was still good.\\n\\nWe decided to order the chocolate lava cake and the prosciutto wrapped figs on endive for dessert. We sampled the figs first and we both agreed that the figs were an unusual choice but it worked as a dessert. With the savory prosciutto and the sweet figs we had the best of both worlds, or so we thought until we dug into the chocolate lava cake!\\n\\nAs a side note, there was a party that came in that was quite loud and boisterous and I think they might have mistaken The Wine Loft for the sports bar 3 doors down. Thankfully, they left after about 10 minutes and silence replaced their loud, abrasive voices.\\n\\nThe cake had a nice crispy cake-like crust that reminded us of Oreos but with a cake center and, of course, the ooey-gooey lava center. Add the vanilla ice cream and the honey they had drizzled on the plate and we were both in dessert heaven.\\n\\nIt was at this time that we needed to leave to start our trek back to the northern suburbs but we were both quite satiated and pleased with our meal. I would be interested in the brunch they are advertising that is supposed to be coming soon and seeing what kinds of entrees they might come up with for a brunch menu.\\n\\nI would definitely recommend trying this place for a date night or as a stop before heading out to the theater or a show downtown.

The sandwiches - in particular the turkey and roast beef - are great but not mind-blowing. The turkey has been pretty dry the two times I've had it and the roast beef is great but is overpowered by the horseradish dressing. Though the portions, even for half a sandwich, are generous.\\n\\nThe sausage, however, is probably the best I've had. I was truly seeking to get a normal lunch here with a friend, order a usual sausage with a sort of \\"had-one-had-em-all\\" attitude, but the pork and lamb sausage with the green chile relish on a pretzel bun was amazing. Really was not expecting that good of a sandwich. Gave the bartender big-ups for that. I would not shut up about this sausage.\\n\\nAnd the bakery upstairs is positively intoxicating, in a good way. A strong, fresh baked aroma into the night I want to capture in a jar and huff all the time.\\n\\nOn top of all of that, Easy Tiger has a solid vibe and a spacious outdoor area nestled in between two buildings which allows noise and chatter to escape.\\n\\nEasy Tiger captures the trinity of service, food and vibe and is one of the few places I can reward five stars to in Austin."},{"name":"Denny's - Winter Park","address":"3096 Aloma Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"2","text":"This location isn't the best Denny's I've been to.

Perhaps their lack of respect for customers could be made up for by quality of food--but the food is rather lacking as well and overall I would NOT recommend this place. \\n\\nThe wait staff has no regard for the well being of their customers and treats customers very poorly. As an example, one time a waitress stood by my table and waited for my party to produce a tip that she deemed sufficient, because she thought we had undertipped her. In another instance, the waitress rudely kicked me and my friend out because we were planning to order just desert--which perhaps is a justifiable reason for not wanting us to take up a table--but the manner in which she requested (demanded would be a better verb) us to leave was extremely harsh and revealed an utter lack of respect for us customers.\\n\\nThe food itself is a very standard Thai experience and does nothing to make up for the poor behavior of the staff. I would advise extreme caution to eat at this place."},{"name":"Bravo","address":"465 Huntington Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Bruto! Let me start by saying that I have never written a review of anything online, but our experience here was so bad, I am compelled to get the Yelp App and put fingers to keys. First, the service was slow. Not just, \\"I'm with two ten year olds who get antsy after waiting for ten minutes\\" slow -- but \\"we waited an hour for food\\" slow.  We got the menus, made our selections, and were told upon placing the order that there were several changes on the menu and that we shouldn't order the chicken or steak salad unless we wanted to wait twenty five minutes. (And reminder-- we waited an hour even without ordering the chicken or the steak.)  The kids menu had French toast without any description, but it came plated on Nutella and sprinkled with nuts. So we had to send it back-- twice. And this was after the ten year old had already waited an hour for it. Honestly, my whole family works in restaurants and I have an incredibly high tolerance for mishaps in service, but this was absurd-- especially accompanied by a hefty tab. I will say that the mussels -- when they finally arrived-- were quite good.  If you have no other plans for your day, and are prepared to eat anything they might have available, then give it a try, but if you are hoping to get to another museum in a day, head to the cafeteria instead!"},{"name":"Chipotle Mexican Grill","address":"2230 Guadalupe St, Ste 32","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"This place is a little overhyped tbh.

Hop's Chicken is a new stall in the recently opened Ponce City Market.  Attached to Holeman & Finch Burger, you have a choice between chicken by the piece, chicken sandwiches, or a whole chicken.  You can order at the counter then eat anywhere in the huge expanse of Ponce City Market.\\n\\nThe wait was really long for the other restaurant I wanted to eat at, so I came here for a snack.  Wings are $1 each, drumsticks are $2 each, half a chicken is $9, and a full chicken is $17.  Saving my appetite, I ordered 2 wings.  Surprisingly, I was asked which sauce I wanted for each wing.  Two sauces for two wings - no extra charge for the second sauce.   I chose the Frim Fram sauce, which is like a remoulade, and Aunt Julia's BBQ sauce.  My friend also ordered a piece of chicken and chose honey mustard, so I tried that too. The Frim Fram sauce was my favorite.  Aunt Julia's BBQ sauce is a very tangy barbecue sauce. \\n\\nSome of my friends tell me that Hop's Chicken reminds them of Chick Fil-A.  I can see the resemblance, but I do like Hop's Chicken a bit better.  The breading on the wings was well seasoned.   Also, the wings were plump and moist.  I can't comment on the \\"full dinner experience\\", but if you're at Ponce to sample all of the different places in the Food Hall, the chicken is worth a try."},{"name":"Uwajimaya","address":"10500 SW Beaverton Hillsdale Hwy","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"Though finding ethnic diversity in Beaverton is not an easy task, Uwajimaya is a welcome oasis.

I was not let down. My husband thought the dinner was better than providence in LA and and Whale Wins in seattle. Sitting right across from the plating island was a treat. I felt that I got a lesson in how to serve a group of guest beautifully.  \\n\\nThe meal started with mushroom soup with morels and it got us all excited because it set the bar high for the rest of the meal.  The charcuterie plate was fun and there was a couple of stand outs for me - the duck and the fois gras Bon Bon.  The others paled in comparison.  Next was the steak.  This was my favorite.  Absolute perfection in the quality and the execution of the meat, the vegetables and blue cheese butter that complement the meat.  I just wished there was a little more meat to finish the sauce with!  Scallop and asparagus was classic but good and the cheese course was good as well. The combination of one of the cheese from Wisconsin with their crackers and the wine that they were paired with, is a stand out.  \\n\\nAfter all this, if the dessert did not help in finishing the meal on a good note, five stars would not be possible. We were not disappointed. It was creamy coconut tapioca with passion fruit reduction(?) topped with crisp tuile, creme fraiche, pineapple and roasted nuts. It was a wonderous experience and which made me want to lick the plate. I didn't because I want to continue to dine out with other people. \\n\\nI enjoyed the meal tremendously but I can see that the format of serving all the diners together can have some drawbacks.

I came here craving something sweet and I sampled the honey lavender, strawberry balsamic with cracked pepper, the almond brittle with salted ganache.  My friend ordered the coffee and bourbon and I had the salted carmel ice cream.  Both were rich with a wonderful balance of flavors.  Something about salt and sweet just makes everything so much better.  The almond brittle was awesome.  If you like peanut brittle, then you'll love this ice cream.  The strawberry balsamic ice cream was great with a nice complex balance of flavors.  You can definitely taste all these key ingredients which make this more than just ice cream.  It'll give your taste buds a new experience that you just can't get anywhere else but Salt and Straw.  The honey lavender is very light in flavor.  Very well balanced and slightly sweet which makes this one delightful dessert!\\n\\nI very highly recommend this place for a unique taste of local customized ice cream.  The ambiance is fun, hip and classic.  This place is very busy at all hours of the day whether it's raining, snowing, or downright smoltering. I can't wait to be back to try more of their ice cream.

To our surprise, we only had to wait about 2 minutes.  We ordered 6 or so plates, and that was plenty of food for 11:30 am.  Everything was nice and hot and the service was pretty quick.  Overall, it was a good place to get our dim sum craving."},{"name":"Maurizios","address":"364 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"We went to Maurizo's during Restaurant Week in Boston. We had actually been meaning to go to The Daily Catch, but the place (and nearly everywhere else we passed) was packed, so we walked up and down Hanover Street until we found something with an empty table. I had remembered seeing Maurizo's listed on Yelp as being pretty good, so we went in to give it a try. \\n\\nThe upstairs dining area was full, except for one table that hadn't been cleared off yet. The hostess told us that they were saving that table for a couple with reservations who hadn't arrived yet, which kind of turned my boyfriend off to the place (but come on, guy, wouldn't *you* be mad if someone without reservations got your table and made you wait for another?) We waited a total of about five minutes - which was a bit uncomfortable since it was a very small dining area and we were basically crammed near the front door the whole time - but the hostess finally told us there was an empty table downstairs and brought us there.\\n\\nThe Restaurant Week menu advertised three appetizer selections, two salads, four entrees and two desserts, and you could pick one selection from three categories (appetizer, salad and entree, or appetizer, entree and dessert ... we opted for the former since we planned to visit Mike's Pastry up the block for some dessert). BF was not too excited about the menu choices, but we settled on a roasted vegetable antipasto, an orange and romaine salad, and chicken marsala for me ... and lentil soup, the same salad and a stuffed filet of sole for him. We also got two Cokes. \\n\\nThe food turned out to be quite good, and we wound up taking our entrees home because there was just so much of it. Normally we don't order appetizers or salads at restaurants unless they come with the meal, because we don't like to eat until we're stuffed, but for $33 apiece we felt like we got a pretty good deal. I don't think the food was phoenominal enough to pay their normal prices for, but for the Restaurant Week deal it wasn't bad. The waitstaff was very friendly and attentive, too, and our food came out pretty quickly. \\n\\nI wouldn't spend a fortune here, but it's not a bad place to grab a bite."},{"name":"Dharani Woburn","address":"474 Main St","city":"Woburn","stars":"2.5","text":"This place is outstanding....the taste of each dish    just took me back to my homeland.

Paired with this sandwich with the bacon cheese fries really completed the meal. The fries stayed crisp under a good coat of of nacho cheese, not to much cheese but also not to little, making it a very nice side to the perfect sandwich.

They also offer dim sum of central and northern China all day and at night, unlike most other such places: a definite advantage if one can only get to Chinatown after work. Winsor Dim Sum has an amazing 7 choices of congee soup varieties; I tried the fish ball variety, which was heavenly. Another notable item not to be missed is their glutinous peanut and pork dumpling. I also tried their their dry fried shrimp and scallion dumplings and their \\"shark fin\\" dumpling full of pork and shrimp. Then a delectable shrimp noodle roll in sweet sauce followed. For everyone's general dipping pleasure are a red vinegar sauce and a home made chili sauce. Dessert consisted of red bean paste filled sesame balls that are breath-takingly fresh and succulent. On weekends they feature their lemon custard tarts. Disappointingly they do not have clams in black bean sauce on offer. The restroom is clean but very microscopic. Winsor is located on the second floor atop a precarious, bending set of stairs, difficult for the arthritic and impossible for the wheelchair set to access. The staff also have to navigate these steps to dispose of trash and to bring up new supplies from their kitchen. The superior quality and vast variety menu of items all fresh make up for the lack of certain items and the difficulty of access. I heartily recommend this place to anyone."},{"name":"Salt & Straw","address":"2035 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"The ice cream is pretty good. I believe the hype.

I love the decor and exposed brick walls. The decor is sort of Industrial with pulley light fixtures and door nob curtains. My favorite table, which I want to reserve next time, is a velvet U shaped booth, with a bird cage chandelier lighting the table.\\n\\nThe dishes are tapa style with some being more filling than others. You are not expected to order all the plates at one time and they tend to come out 2 at a time unless you ask them to do differently.\\n\\nWe started off with the charred edamame with house made \\"pop rocks\\". The edamame was warm and the char and chili oil gave it a nice flavor.  I enjoyed adding the pop rock salt and it was more salt than sweet but, like the candy, pops in your mouth.\\n\\nOur first round we ordered the raw Maine diver scallops. I eat sushi but haven't tried raw scallops. I chose the perfect dish to do so. The scallops were laid on thin slices of cucumber and cucumber sorbet and topped with Hawaiian sea salt. This dish was light and the flavors were perfect. We also ordered the foie gras & Niman (Ranch) pork belly bahn mi minis. This is the new version of what they served at the La Dolce Vita Food and Wine Festival and there was no way I could pass this dish up! The foie gras  was spread lightly onto thinly sliced baguette with pieces of pork belly topped with cilantro and fresh slices of jalapeno. The foie gras gave this dish a nice twist and I liked that the pork belly was in small portions, not making it too heavy or rich.\\n\\nThe second round we decided on sharing the quail. The quail is sourced from Bandera Texas and tasted like it was seasoned sparingly with salt and pepper. It is served with Anna Mary's hot water corn bread and golden raisin rum butter on the side. The corn bread is simple, corn meal and water fried. The rum butter was delicious on the corn bread. \\n\\nDessert kicked ass!  We went with popcorn and a movie. I dubbed it \\"when sweet meets salty\\".  It is pieces house made chocolate crunch bars, with popcorn ice cream topped with sea salt and cracker jacks and dollops of root beer syrup on the side. Things seriously got silent besides the \\"mmmmms\\" and eye rolls as this perfect mix of sweet and salty was devoured.\\n\\nSwift's Attic has a full bar with both an extensive wine and beer menu along with a small specialty cocktail menu.\\n\\nI was sad to see Kyoto close but Swift's Attic is doing this space justice."},{"name":"Gladstone Street Pizza","address":"3813 SE Gladstone St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Crunchy thin crust pizza with the freshest of ingredients.

It's tasty..TASTY.  But we are not done there.  It also comes with a massive side of Mac and cheese so amazing that it can be a main dish all by it self.  Finally for good measure it comes with a nice sweat piece of corn bread.  The Champ is Here...  The Champ is Here!  Pat I would like to solve the puzzle.  \\"Nashville Hot Chicken\\"!!!

Let me talk you through this hellish Italian journey...\\n\\nWe went to Filippo's to celebrate two birthdays in our friend group. They had set up a special table for us in the back. 6 of us arrived on time and the waiter kept bothering us asking when the other 4 would show up. He kept pressuring the birthday girl to order appetizers for the whole table--she said no. Two girls ended up ordering salads and our waiter very angrily said, \\"See! You should have just ordered appetizers for everyone!\\" Clearly his logic was flawed because only 20% of us wanted an appetizer.\\n\\nWe were asked by our waiter before we all ordered, \\"Would you like some homemade bread to start?\\" Of course we said yes to free bread. But alas, it wasn't free! We got charged TWENTY dollars for doused-in-oil focaccia bread. It was horrible, and worse, not free.\\n\\nOur waiter then got mad at us when we only ordered two bottles of wine, didn't ever bring one of our Diet Cokes, nearly sexually harassed every girl at our table (asked one of us if we were texting our boyfriend for action that night). Overall, the worst dining experience yet. \\n\\nOh, and the food? Nothing special. Undercooked, overcooked, and covered in oil.\\n\\nWe were going to complain and tip our sexist waiter only 10%, until we saw that they tacked on included gratuity of 20%. \\n\\nNever going back.

The other things we ordered like the sweet potato fries and the regular fries were a cut above the norm as well.\\n\\nThe only thing I didn't like about this place is that the counter where they make shakes is prominently situated in the middle of the restaurant.  The shake machine is very noisy and it sounds exactly like a dental drill.  It's a very annoying sound.  This evening we were serenaded by that thing the whole time we were there as they made shake after shake.

East Boston is not an area I would normally think of for delicious Italian cuisine but apparently it is. \\n\\nFew negative things but minor and really not much you can do about it but deal. The place is about a 10min walk from the blue line airport stop. Driving wise, sounds like it might be a little nightmare unless you already lived in the area. Parking, most likely wouldn't have been a problem but I didn't really see that many empty spots on the street (so does not have their own parking lot). \\n\\nThen there's the interesting way they handle when there is a wait. The restaurant opened at 4pm and we arrived at 4:40pm to a packed place. We saw it was a pretty small place and asked to be put on the waiting list. The manager said there were 6 parties in front of us and took down my cell number. He said to stay in the area and just be back here within 10mins of his call. We thought this was kinda strange. I told him we wouldn't be going anywhere because we don't know this area and we just came from the train. This guy doesn't mess around, basically if he calls you and you're NOT back in 10mins you just lost your spot. Lucky for us we went from 7th place to 2nd and was seated within 10mins. \\n\\nOk no more negative stuff all positive from here. When you walk in, the aroma from the kitchen starts you drooling. I felt like I was at home for the holidays and all the aunts were in the kitchen cooking yummy dishes for us cousins. \\n\\nWe started off with 1/2 orders of the arancini and prosciutto wrapped asparagus. The arancini was SO good we almost ordered another. The asparagus simple but melt in your mouth wonder. I then ordered the lobster ravioli which were 'ginormous'. I got 9 of them and they were about the size of my hand. Each filled with a velvety mixture of cheese and lobster under a lobster cream sauce that I could have drank from the bowl. My boyfriend got the gnocchi, again bigger than the normal size I've seen. \\n\\nOverall portions were so big we barely made a dent but happily got it wrapped up for a future meal. We didn't stay for dessert since we were taking the train and didn't want to stay out too late but next time we might drive so we can try some of those out. \\n\\nI highly recommend checking out Ringo's, prices were fair, atmosphere was pleasantly casual, service was super friendly and the food was really, really delish!"},{"name":"Winsor Dim Sum Caf√©","address":"10 Tyler St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"On the pricier side with your typical lack of service found in a lot of dim sum places, but for this lady who is starved for good Chinese food in Minneapolis, I am a fan.\\n\\nSurprisingly small place.

Then he took our orders and we waited....for the rest of the drinks and we waited, then the bread and we waited and then our entrees and we waited.  When the bread and entrees came out,  there finely appeared a whole group of waiters so the pace picked up.  I ordered cavatelli with chicken and broccoli in a \\"way too heavy\\" cream sauce.  I normally finish my meals but this time I couldn't -it was way too rich!  Then we waited for our checks-again it took forever.  One waiter told the group that the gratuity was added to our bills and I expressed my displeasure to him about that.

I had the dirty bird with gravy on the side , which looks great on the picture here on yelp. I received a mess of a sandwich. The biscuit was super dry and when it arrived on the table, part of the biscuit was inside of the gravy the other part on the plate with some of the egg and bacon outside of the sandwich.

Luckily I got to experience it today, on Easter, when there wasn't much of a line.  I'm forced to assume those willing to book weeks in advance (as the staff told me one had to for a reservation) or stand in line for an hour are making their selection based on the other clientele, not the food (there were plenty of pretty hipsters eating there).\\n\\nTo elaborate:\\n\\n1) The lack of selection -- their brunch menu sparsely covers one side of one page and I had a hard time finding anything I was even interested in.  Contrast that with Friendly Toast where I think I'd have to go there a dozen more times to try everything I'm interested in.  Or even go down the street to Supreme Kitchen where you'll find everything you'd expect on a diner breakfast menu including many creative items you wouldn't expect.  Or Olde Magoun's Saloon which just has a solid variety of breakfast and pub food.\\n\\n2) The execution on what few items they do have -- the pulled pork sandwich (from the other side of the menu) was too dry to be enjoyed by my friend -- he barely touched it.  I got the Dirty Bird which was certainly decent, but nothing to rave about, just standard soul food.  The Beignets were very tasty -- but that's just sort of how they work.\\n\\nI'll certainly never go back for brunch there and if I'd had to wait more than 15 minutes to be seated I might have demanded my money back."},{"name":"Little New Orleans Kitchen & Oyster Bar","address":"5840 W Irlo Bronson Memorial Hwy","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"3.5","text":"Came in around 8 and the place was not too busy.

I also think it is haunted...I remember a painting that hung over the west wall  (Flat Shoals side) about 8 years ago that had a completely different color to it depending on whether you looked at it straight on or reflected in the mirror behind the bar.  I used to think they put something in the beer and I still have a strained neck from pivoting, disbelievingly, back and forth between these two vantage points.\\n\\nPerhaps the most bizarre and puzzling piece of men's room grafitto in Atlanta is enshrined behind a piece of plexiglas.

I love the old look of paintings and the Michelangelo's \\"Creation of Adam\\" awning warmed my heart hanging above the bar. We were given the window seat for two and perfect time when the sun was setting. Everything about this place screamed Italian and I just loved it. \\n\\nWine - We ordered the House Wine on the menu. I was impressed by it's taste. It was beautiful, a nice smooth wine and new it would go perfectly with my food that I had in mind. Our server Lulu, had us try it first and we both smiled and loved it, specially since it was the cheapest bottle on the menu. ;D \\n\\nThe Service - Our waitress, a beautiful Italian woman who knew her stuff. She was very down to earth, and reminded me of my Italian relatives. She made me laugh and always knew when we needed her. Told us to just call her when we did. I loved that, made me feel like I was back at home. Lulu is the best there, I would request her again in the future. She let us have our time, eat, talk and was sure to be there when we needed. The best kind of service. \\n\\nThe Food - I have been to many Italian restaurants and I always order a tomato sauced dish hoping to find one that comes close to my Italian old world great, great grandmother's gravy. Well, I was HIGHLY impressed by the sauce for the dish I ordered. It was PERFECT! I tell you! My mouth watered! The sausage that I had ordered with my linguini (which they kindly substituted the original rigatoni for) was melt in your mouth jaw dropping good! With each bite, the sausage melted like butter on my tongue. Lulu brought us over some freshly grated cheese to put on it and that delicious sauce, mixed with the sausage was just like I was back with my great aunts who were taught by their mother how to make such a tomato gravy. I tell ya, I must say, that place makes the best gravy sauce for your pasta dish you can ever get. Such a rich flavor. \\nMy friend got the Marsala and it was divine! the flavors melted in my mouth when I tried it. The chicken was tender, the mushrooms were perfectly cooked. I would highly recommend this place again. I took my time eating this food, savoring each bite and Lulu never made us feel rushed. Here, you can relax, take your time and eat slow, really enjoying the old world cooking. This is no modern American food, only the good stuff passed down from the old world onto many great generations who knew how to make good food taste even better. This is real Italian cooking right here. \\n\\nWe then ordered two cappuccino's which Lulu brought over to us and we had a few laughs with her. She then gave us some free pizzelles after our dinner! Between the both of us, we finished the bottle of wine which I heard was made by her boss, enjoyed our time, the decor. I feel many people are missing out on this gem of a restaurant. And, if you are Italian, this place will make you feel like you are at home. I found myself leaving the restaurant, like I knew Lulu all my life, giving her a big hug and hoping to return soon with some of my favorite friends to share the goodness this restaurant has to offer. \\n\\nCompliments to the chef and to our server Lulu, give that woman a raise!

I forgot the name, but I think it's the Brrr... something 35. It was a bubbles cocktail. Mine was pretty good and I didn't realize I'm drinking this strongly poured drink on a dehydated and empty stomach. Needless to say, I had a buzz by the time my food came. At 2 in the afternoon? Nice.\\n\\nMy sister ordered the steak and eggs and I tried it. The cornmeal pancake was good, but I can't say I'm a fan of the steak. The flavor was right on, but it was too tough for my taste. I got the shakshuka with sausage and it was yum! I dug in and totally burnt the roof of my mouth, but it obviously didn't stop me, because I don't think my sister and I spoke again until our food was done. After we had finished, I noticed my sister didn't touch her drink, so I'm assuming she didn't like. Well, no need to waste alcohol, so I finished it for her and by the time I'd finished that, I was feeling preeeetty snazzy.\\n\\nA couple of minor notices, though. My sister asked if they could do a strawberry lemonade, because we saw they had this strawberry jam/puree stuff they used for the cocktails. We were told it's reserved for the alcoholic drinks. Uh... ok. Then we asked if they had a side of fries, because the people next to us had it with their burgers. We were told they only came with the burger... Again... oook... Not a huge deal. I mean you run your business how you do. I just thought it was kind of odd.\\n\\nOverall, great dining experience. Service was super friendly.

The portions have gotten a bit smaller over the years, but you still get plenty and will walk away full. They are also very accommodating to your order preferences - you can substitute almost anything on the menu and rarely get charged for it. My wife usually substitutes grilled vegetables in place of rice and beans. My personal favorite entree is the zesty blackened chicken, although the chicken soft tacos are another regular order of mine. The salads are also fresh and tasty, and the dressings are homemade. Lastly, the margaritas are very good and prices are cheap - I think around $6 for a house marg. The beer is your standard Tex-Mex fare (think Lone Star, Dos Equis, Corona, etc.). \\n\\nIn terms of service, we have rarely if ever had anything other than a great experience - I struggle to even remember one bad trip. If anything, the food comes out a little bit too quickly sometimes, so we usually pace out our ordering of appetizers and entrees. This is a big part of the reason why the wait is usually not bad despite huge crowds on popular dine-out nights.\\n\\nif you couldn't tell from from this review, I love the Border. It should probably say something that we got over $150 of gift cards here for Christmas. If you're looking for high-brow, artisanal Mexican food, the Border probably isn't for you.

The white tuna on the dinner menu is excellent and worth trying. Their salmon is good, and the regular tuna is decent.\\n\\nSo, I'm giving it five stars, not because the sushi is amazing, but because it beats the sushi in all other buffets that I've been to in MA. I like the location too, convenient if you live in the 'burbs and parking is easy.

Both times we went on a Friday night when it was super busy. The first time we went we were greeted by a really lovely and charming hostess and the same happened the second time. It really makes you feel good to enter an establishment and to be warmly greeted right away rather than standing around hoping someone will notice you. The first time we came there was space at the bar so we sat and had a drink until a table became available. The bartender was great. Excellent margarita followed by a delicious dinner and a really great server. Our second visit was last night. The hostess figured it would be about a 20 minute wait. I asked if I could leave my cell # so that we could have a drink down the street at the Cambie (as there was no space at the restaurant's bar). She said that was fine and off we went. After about 30 minutes we started wondering if we'd somehow been forgotten. We came back to find that there was no table available yet. Not a big deal as we realize the hostess can only give an estimate. She led us down to the sofa downstairs so that we wouldn't have to stand around by the front door. We sat there for a few minutes and then my partner went and grabbed us a couple of beers at the bar for our wait. We eventually got a table upstairs and had a delicious dinner. The server was very nice and very efficient. We each ordered soup (super tortilla soup for my partner and black bean for me), then we ordered chimichangas, one veg (mine), one chicken (my partner's). Unfortunately, when they were placed in front of us, the server reversed them by mistake so I bit into a chicken one which wasn't particularly pleasant as I'm a vegetarian. My partner and I switched our plates and I did let the server know. I have to say that she could not have been more genuinely apologetic. She took the charge off the bill for the tortilla soup in recognition of the error and again apologized profusely to me. I felt really badly for her because while it wasn't ideal, it wasn't the end of the world and I didn't want her beating herself up over it. I thanked her very much for apologizing and for making the adjustment on the bill. Mistakes happen. It's all about what happens after the mistake that matters and she handled it perfectly. The only criticism we would have was that the \\"super\\" tortilla soup that is supposed to have chicken in it didn't appear to have much, if any chicken, according to my partner. Otherwise, it was another really good dining experience at this restaurant and we will definitely be back.

However, my boyfriend thought it was one of the best meals he's ever had.  It was a shame I was so full at the end, because the dessert menu was impressive.  \\n\\nOur server was very knowledgeable and helpful.  Any questions we had on the menu, food or drinks, she was able to explain everything to us.\\n\\nEverything about this place is offbeat in the best way possible.

We have been twice sitting at the bar just two of us and recently once as a large party for a birthday brunch at a table.\\n\\nVibe and Service\\nThe vibe of the restaurant is a cool modern country feel with a lot of wood tables and columns with different lighting fixtures. The tables are well spaced so you don't feel like you're eating on top of people, and the waitstaff is friendly and welcoming. Sitting at the bar, the bartenders have always been friendly and are happy to give recommendations based on what you like. One of the bartenders offered to make a custom cocktail based on a description of drinks we typically like. Additionally, a lot of their drinks, both adult and regular, are made in house (the fresh squeezed lemonade is especially tart and delicious).\\n\\nSitting at a table as a large party - out waitress Megan was extremely friendly, and did a great job of attending to everyone at the table and keeping a good pace of the meal. \\n\\nAdditionally, all three times we have been, the Manager on duty has checked in to make sure everything is going well and also chips in some recommendations on drinks and food. Everyone from the hosts to wait staff to managers were incredibly friendly and took the time to make everyone in the restaurant feel welcomed and taken care of.\\n\\nFood and Drink\\nOn top of the awesome service, the food is delicious for all meals. Everything from the biscuits and gravy, the cornbread, the pancakes, chicken and waffles, and eggs were prepared exactly as ordered and tasted delicious. The homefries that come with most meals are perfectly crisp and have a nice kick to them. There have also been delicious specials each time we've one, including a scallop and bacon omelette that everyone enjoyed.\\n\\nThe drink menu is definitely something to be enjoyed, even if you're not typically a whiskey or bourbon drinker. The many pages of cocktails have something for everyone, and everything we've had was delicious. As part of our birthday brunch, the Manager provided some complimentary Peach Bourbon shots for the whole party that everyone loved.\\n\\nPrice\\nThe food and drink pricing was standard for similar restaurants in the area, with entrees typically between $15-$25 and drinks between $4-$12, and each worth every penny.\\n\\nI would definitely recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for delicious, filling, and very comforting food."},{"name":"Chick-fil-A","address":"1065 Cleveland Ave","city":"East Point","stars":"2.5","text":"Only complaint was that the dining room had several flies.

The movie Sweet Hereafter, if you haven't seen it, basically snuffs out any ideas of the light and warmth of humanity you might possess. Kids die, people have inappropriate sexual relationships, lives are uprooted. It's a tough thing to watch.\\n\\nBut hey, why not name your bar after that movie? Go nuts! YOLO! \\n\\nEven if Sweet Hereafter, the bar on Belmont, didn't intend to invoke that film with its name, it's still another term for the afterlife. Which might explain why the inside of the bar feels kind of, I don't know, gothy? Funereal? Maybe it's because it's kind of dark in the bar, from the lack of light to the dark wood booths. I don't think the general air of solemnity is a problem, per se, but it's a curious choice for an inner Southeast bar that brings in boisterous pretty folks, both vegetarian-minded and not. \\n\\nMaybe the name alludes to what chickens, cows, and pigs might avoid for a little while, since Sweet Hereafter proudly serves an all vegan menu. It's all gussied up sandwiches and rice bowls, but they're consistently delicious and perfectly suited to the wide selection of cocktails in Mason jars that the bar is well known for. My only caveat? With most of the entrees priced close to $10 and the signature cocktails about $7 or $8 a pop, you can spend a lot of money somewhat quickly. And the happy hour \\"deal\\" only takes a buck off the regular prices. It's not a tragedy of the \\"kids perish in senseless accident\\" order, but it means I don't stop by all that often."},{"name":"Tasty n Sons","address":"3808 N Williams Ave, Ste C, Hub Building","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"This place was highly anticipated by my friends and I who are visiting from California.

We were blown away (though we may have started with lower expectations). It was very flavorful with a unique blend of sharp sweetness and satisfying spice. The texture was saucy and yet crispy. Amazing. We vaguely remember it coming with some delicious rice and vegetables, though chicken was clearly the main attraction. The Beef Satay had a fantastic spicy peanut sauce. The beef was a little tough but worked well with the aromatic peanut paste. It came on cute little kebab spears, and who doesn't love meat on a stick? I wolfed down my meal with a delicious blueberry smoothie (absolutely recommend it!) The decor was colorful and exotic with an Asian floral theme. I loved their use of natural decoration indoors, to take you away from the bustling train stop out their doors. This funky Asian Fusion joint has quirks and its own sense of trendiness."},{"name":"Muqueca Restaurant","address":"1008 Cambridge St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"This is probably one of my favorite restaurants in the Boston area.

I've been to plenty of small restaurants but I definitely felt claustrophobic in there\\n\\nalthough our order was taken not long after we sat down, we waited for a REALLY long time for our appetizer. Normally we wouldn't have cared but because the party that sat down roughly 20 minutes after us got their appetizer AND entree before ours, we were definitely a bit ticked off. Not only that, in the middle of our meal, the male waiter (possibly the manager or even the owner) came and asked the table to the right AND the left of us if everything was good and whether they're enjoying the meal...and completely skipped us. not sure what that was about. Service: 1.5 star\\n\\nWe ordered a fried garlic chicken dish to start (not on their online menu), fish moqueca and fried plantains. I enjoyed the chicken dish, which came on bones so the waitress gave us an empty bowl to keep the bones (they don't give you plates to eat on), and when I was still working on my last piece of chicken, the waitress came and took away the empty dish and bowl, leaving me with nothing to put my bone on. fish moqueca was good but i certainly don't feel that it was so good that i must go back there again, or that i should bring someone there. it seemed like a simple enough dish that we could just make at home. plus, because we only ordered one entree, we were charged $2.95 for an extra bowl of rice. \\n\\nOverall, I wouldn't recommend against trying the restaurant but I don't recommend going back there after your first try."},{"name":"Salt & Straw","address":"2035 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"This is an update to my update, followed by a follow-up review. Yes.\\n\\nI received another email from Kim, the owner of Salt & Straw. Here it is, verbatim:\\n\\nHi there! Thanks again for your message. I wanted to let you know that I shared your email with our team and everyone was really interested in your thoughts. I have to say, you spurred on a great deal of conversation and tons of ideas. \\n\\nAlthough it can be a little painful to hear constructive feedback, yours was truly valuable and we've used the opportunity to pause for a moment and dream up a few directions to take.\\n\\nSo again, thank you!\\nLooking forward to seeing you soon.\\n-Kim Malek\\n\\n\\nI am so impressed by Kim's dedication, attention to detail, and customer service ethic. I had already planned a return trip to Salt & Straw, and this made me want to get back even sooner.\\n\\nI tasted three flavors: the honey balsamic strawberry with cracked pepper, the pear with blue cheese, and the lemon basil sorbet. The busy staff was again impressive with their help-the-wide-eyed-and-decision-impaired-customers-taste-almost-every-flavor-on-the-board-while-simultaneously-making-waffle-cones-and-serving-scoops-in-a-somewhat-tight-space talent. They more than once acknowledged those of us in line with a smile and a, \\"thanks for your patience, we'll be right with you.\\"\\n\\nAs you've read in my previous reviews, I really, really, really want the honey balsamic strawberry with cracked pepper to live up to its mouth-watering and rather sexy name. It's definitely a customer favorite. I sort of feel as though I'm back in high school, and Balsamic Strawberry is the hot guy everyone wants to hang with --- but he won't give me the time of day. I really want Balsamic Strawberry to be my boyfriend, but it's entirely possible that we're just not meant to be together. However, today's taste drew Cupid's bow back juuuuuust a bit. There was that zingy, tangy bite of balsamic, and the sweet spring of strawberry...I missed the black pepper punch, but my taste was kinda small, and it is hard to judge from just one sample. But yay! Balsamic Strawberry LOOKED at me and SMILED!!  \\n\\nNext I tried the pear with blue cheese. Many have scoffed at this flavor, and for these people I give a friendly point in the direction of Baskin Robbins. Again, a taste is just a small spoonful, not a bowl or a cone --- but this was really good. Smooth and sweet with that delicious funk of blue cheese. \\n\\nLastly, the lemon basil sorbet. I've been dreaming about this ever since I changed my mind at the last minute during my fist visit to Salt & Straw, and opted for a different flavor. Serious score. The sorbet is perfectly lemon-y.. not overpowering and sore-throat-inducing the way some lemon treats can be. And the basil, OH, the basil! Nice, fresh tears (as in rip, not cry) of green in the fruity chill...perfect for Portland's belated summer. I got a single scoop in a dish  -- which brings me to the portions. In my original review I pointed out what I felt were too-small scoops being handed over the counter, and at almost $4 a pop, I cried foul. My scoop today was just about perfect -- almost the size of a tennis ball.\\n\\nI am a converted fan of Salt & Straw, and I will indeed be back. With friends.

This place was definitely on my list, so instead of taking a Cab (which would've been a 35 -42 minute ride and paying a lot of Money) I decided to take the Subway for the Very first time. I got off at the Orient Heights Station and walked the rest of the way, I realized I got off too far and I even got myself lost a couple times. But the scenery and everything were nice to look at, such a nice Italian Neighborhood. I had to ask about 27 different locals how to get here cuz I didn't know my way around here very well Some were helpful, some weren't.\\n\\nThe sun was beating down on me, I was sweating (because I was wearing Jeans instead of Shorts) and my Feet were killing me, but I was still determined to find this place. After about 36 minutes of Walking I found it, I arrived 15 Minutes after they Opened (and to my Surprise I was the 1st Customer of the day) I actually thought I would have to wait across the Street at Prima e Dopo. So they sat me down and I was looking around the restaurant it was really small and there were only 8 Tables. I had a salad to start with (Fresh Salad with their House Dressing) but I didn't want to fill up on that (Portions here are Huge, they make sure you leave with a Full Gut), the thing that I came here for was the Lobster Ravioli.\\n\\nWhile I was waiting for it to come out, I used the Restroom. In order to do that you have to go in through the Kitchen (which is where I met Chef Tony DiCenso), Such a nice Guy he's says he sees Guy Fieri every once in a while. He even said that Anthony Bourdain was gonna film here when he was doing No Reservations still (But he didn't, it still would've been cool). Once I got back to my Table the Lobster Ravioli came out (the filling was Ricotta and Parmesan Cheese, Parsley and the Lobster Meat. The sauce was Shallots, More Lobster Meat, Brandy, Plum Tomato Sauce, Basil, Cream and a little Butter).\\n\\nI take my knife and I cut open these pouches of Pasta to find Rich, Creamy Ricotta and big Chunks of Lobster. The sauce had some Sweetness from the Tomatoes, Crunch from the Shallots (Double the Meat here, Filling and the Sauce) I loved that they freshly grated some Parmesan on there for Me (I also thought the Portion Size was Perfect, 5 is Definitely enough as opposed to 8 which is what they usually Serve). I also skipped breakfast in order to prepare for this (a lot of Reviews keep saying they get filled up here so I planned it out).\\n\\nEverything here is Scratch-made (no Store Bought, Phony Baloney Stuff here) This is the real deal. I also had the Limoncello Truffle (Gelato with a Lemony Center) and a Cappuccino. If I wasn't so full I also would've got either the Baby Octopus and Mussels or the Rabbit Sausage with Broccoli Rabe (Next Time) I also took a Picture of the Guy Fieri Photo and I also took a Picture with Tony. Everyone was really Nice here (a couple reviews said that the Waiters/Waitresses were Rude and Ignorant), Not me. good thing I came for Lunch and Not Dinner cuz I'd be waiting for 2 or more Hours for Food.

I have been able to cut my own meat since I was quite a bit younger than I am now.     That bothered me for some reason and perhaps it was because the steak was a bit on the tepid side as a result of having been carved for me. \\n\\nMy wife had the halibut which was also stacked upon the vegetables and leafy greens served with it.   My wife enjoyed her entree a fair amount  but I think it was also because it was late and she was pretty famished.   In my view the entrees were very ho hum and average, especially for items priced in the 45-50 dollar range.    \\n\\nI was disappointed at the lack of suitable choices as I love steak but wanted to try something different but there were only 4 choices and that's a socialist's paradise but for me it's just not enough.   We did manage to get fairly full but their deserts were so mundane and plain that we opted to pass and get something elsewhere. The total bill for 4 was about 95 dollars apiece  and to me, when you're around 100 per person in Portland, the food should be perfect and this simply was not. \\n\\nI don't think I'd go back.

I'm also surprised that they claim to specialize in American small plates - the United States is not a nation of sharers, and thus, I'd go so far as to say that phrase is an oxymoron. However, to the restaurant's credit, the staff is both personable and competent, which is a seemingly rare attribute these days in the Atlanta dining scene. Thus, I'm rounding up to a solid 3 stars. \\n\\nFood: Saltyard offers a selection of small plates grouped into various categories. Unfortunately, the menu is awkwardly organized and it's difficult to piece together a sequence of courses that reflect a memorable meal. Many of the dishes also lack the ingenuity you'll find at other tapas restaurants in the area. In the end, Saltyard serves food with no pretention, but I'd argue that it's almost too non-pretentious - to the point of being underwhelming. During my visit, I had the stuffed piquillo peppers, cheddar bay biscuits, pimento cheese bruschetta, arancini, and pork cheek, the latter two of which were nightly specials. All the dishes were fine, but nothing memorable enough for me to return. Some were also very meagerly portioned for the price point, even for a small plate. \\n\\nService: Very friendly and eager to please. We ordered three separate rounds of food and each arrived at the table within less than 10 minutes of the order being placed. The dishes were brought out by different staff members each time, all of whom made an effort to ensure that we were well tended to.  \\n\\nAtmosphere: Not to rub salt in the wound, but the seating here is about as comfortable as a colonic irrigation and the music is borderline schizophrenic - in a matter of minutes it went from Ray Charles to Ozzie Osbourne. The restaurant was also at less than half capacity at 7PM on a Friday evening, which was surprising considering that we had to dine at 6PM because there were no available reservations in the online system between 6PM and 9PM that evening. \\n\\nCost: Moderately priced. Most small plates are between $5 and $11. There are also a few \\"biggie smalls\\" plates that are $17-$22. Desserts are all $6. \\n\\nOther: Saltyard is located in the Brookwood building, which also houses Watershed. The main entrance is located on the small street that runs alongside the building, but there's also a \\"back\\" entrance that can be accessed directly from Peachtree. Saltyard is open for dinner only. Hours of operation are Monday-Thursday, 5PM-10PM, Friday-Saturday, 5PM-11PM, and Sunday, 6PM-9PM.

I won't claim to know what is authentic and what is fusion influenced since I'm Asian but neither Korean or Mexican. All in all, your taste buds won't be bored here.\\n\\nTacos are a great deal...meats (I tried the chicken and the spicy pork) are very flavorful and a bit salty, but counteracted with crisp veggies on top (lettuce, shredded cabbage, tomato, julienned carrot, & CORN, which is a great addition that I don't usually see on Korean tacos).  I would have liked to see queso fresco on the taco instead of shredded orange cheddar...would have been more of the Mexican influence, but I'm nitpicking. The tangy lime juice & flour tortilla also balanced with the salty Korean BBQ meat.  Tacos are $2.50-$3 each, and very decent sized portions.\\n\\nBulgolgi bap rice entree is giant in size, with the same options of Korean BBQ meat as the tacos, and comes with brown or white rice, sunny side egg and marinated grilled veggies.  Again, a bit salty, but counteracted by the plain rice.\\n\\nAlso couldn't resist getting a pork belly bun...soft pillowy bun with a good sound of pork belly and the aforementioned kimchee...definitely got a bit of a kick compared to other pork belly buns I've had.\\n\\nDefinitely not fancy, but hearty and strong flavors.  Can't wait to come back to try the Korean junk food, noodles, & other rice dishes: spicy fries (can they rival Hankook's delicious sesame fries.), Korean Fried Chicken, ramyun, bibimbap, burritos, anything tofu...\\n\\nVery big menu, considering the small size of the space...it is basically a takeout spot, with a few counter stools and a table outside.  Bare bones without much decoration other than the photo printouts of the menu food items plastered on the windows, and the big chalkboard with the full menu.  Very promising!\\n\\nUpdate: tried some other menu items so here are the notes. \\nBibimbap with tofu- very fresh, and great textures between the crunchy veggies and the tofu, rice and egg.\\nRamyun- I got the mild, but the broth was still very flavorful.  It probably would have benefited if I ate this on-site instead of takeout...the egg yolk was already cooked through and noodles were a bit soft by the time I got it home.  Giant portion for $5.99.\\nKorean fried chicken wing combo- wings are crunchy, sweet and not too spicy (good for me, though the more adventurous may want to partake in additional hot sauce.

Got here a little after 10PM and managed to snag one of the last free parking spots (but only after 10PM and on weekends) right around the corner  - if you don't manage to do this, you are definitely paying to park.  There was no line outside and after showing my ID, I was able to walk right in.  I am not sure if they charge on certain nights or after a certain time, but I didn't pay any sort of cover, which I appreciated.  About the dress code - I'm not sure what constitutes \\"dressy,\\" but I did not feel out of place in jeans and heels (though I was probably a bit underdressed compared to most). \\n\\nThe set up is a bit strange.  They have two bars on the main floor - one to your right as soon as you walk in that wraps all the way around the corner and another to your left that is in a semi private area, with a DJ booth immediately to the right of that.  The remainder of the floor is covered with not-so-strategically placed tables, leaving very little room to dance - or move at all, really, between all of the \\"velvet\\" ropes closing off most areas.  I saw someone mention in a review that they remove some tables and chairs on weekends, but there were still plenty in the room - most of which were reserved.  I guess it's supposed to add to the ambiance, but all it added to was my anxiety that I would fall face first in my heels trying to stay out of everyone's way.  \\n\\nThe bar to the left was being used by a private party, so I had to stick to the main one.  I ordered a Bacardi and Coke - didn't have to wait long and the bartender was very nice.  They don't stock Bacardi (sad face), but he gave me a mix of Coke and their house brand of rum instead.  I nearly choked when he told me it was $10, but was pretty much buzzed after two sips, so....win?  \\n\\nThe clientele here definitely had me wondering when I got old - which is saying something since I am only removed from my 20s by a few months.  Pretty sure the only people older than me were the bouncers, the DJ, and a table full of guys with salt and pepper beards who sipped champagne at a back table and stared at everyone the whole time.  The music was so loud that my friend and I couldn't carry on any kind of conversation- gesturing was our only way to communicate.  By 11:30 or so, the place filled up and we kept having to move to avoid the waitresses, other people, and the \\"velvet\\" ropes.  We finally decided to give up a little after midnight and head somewhere else.

As far as I can tell, it was a first come, first serve basis, so you stand around for a bit to grab a table or a seat at the bar if it's busy. We probably waited about 10-15 minutes before we were able to sneak in, and you have to really stand right by the chairs to make sure you get them first. There was live music which was a nice touch. The restaurant downstairs was completely empty, however, if you wanted to do that. \\n\\nThe bartenders were nice, but not exactly knowledgeable about the menu. Plus it seemed like they didn't have enough people at the bar to meet demand (not the staff's fault at all). Drinks did come rapidly, but I'm not sure how quick they would have gotten to us if we'd not been sitting at the bar. Even sitting there it took awhile to get the bartender's attention to order.\\n\\nI tried the house rocks margarita, which was fairly weak and a little too sweet, as well as the house frozen. The house frozen was better, but I don't think either had too much alcohol in them.\\n\\nThe food was unfortunately very poor. I would recommend almost anywhere else except here. The chips and salsa were complimentary and sadly were the highlight. We tried the nachos, which were just not great - basically what you'd expect in mediocre sports bar nachos. Also everything seemed to come out cold. For the entrees we tried the seafood burrito and chicken enchilada. The burrito came with rice and beans, and the rice was inedible. The burrito was ok, and seafood was fine, just nothing special. My friend had to order more chicken because they'd barely put any in her enchilada. \\n\\nAll in all...I'd say go if you'd like a rooftop bar experience, but don't plan on staying for food."},{"name":"Swift's Attic","address":"315 Congress Ave, Ste 200","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Absolutely awesome atmosphere, service, and food in Downtown Austin.

To be honest, the first time I really liked it, even went a total of 3 times their opening week. Told friends and family about it too. But I think the excitement of having a cool bbq joint in downtown Sanford wore off and I really became unimpressed. \\n\\nI really love the look of the place, although all the white outside is pretty blinding for sunny Florida days. When you walk up you can smell the awesome smoker and you immediately get excited for what would seem to be some real southern smoked meats. But that's the odd thing, none of their meats seem super smoky. In fact I barely got any smoke flavor at all on them. You can even see the smoke ring on the brisket, but just not a whole lot of flavor. The chicken has been dry both times we've tried it, the pulled pork is good and the brisket is good...just no smoky bbq flavor. Again, it's not bad, it's just meh. \\n\\nThe sides. Baked beans are pretty good, collards are nice, but could use some vinegar, the okra is flat out awesome. I could honestly just go there just for the okra. The mac n cheese is a greasy, overcooked mess. The sauce is curdled and separated and swimming in oil. The green beans where not my thing at all, very greasy and sugary! The amount of sugar in them really turned me off. The cornbread was really good one time and super dry the other times. Love their mustard sauce, though. \\n\\nAll in all, I want them to work out. I know they put care into their meats and their is heart in their food, but it's just not fully showing. Sides def need to be reworked and some flavor amped up on the meats. Hopefully they'll go from meh to amazing."},{"name":"Hat Yai","address":"1605 NE Killingsworth St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Hands down, the best Thai restaurant in portland.

It's hard to mess up a crepe for me though.\\n\\nService: The service was a little spotty. We weren't sure if it was a fast-causal concept (where we order at the counter and take care of ourselves), or it it was a traditional sit down restaurant. Because of the initial confusion on what to do, we ordered at the counter. There were 5+ staff members working and none appeared to be staffed to refill our glasses or take our plates away.

Each time a new owner took over I faithfully gave it my best shot only to be seriously disappointing each time.  So when the current owners took over, remodeled, and changed the name, I took a deep breath and said to myself, \\"one more time\\".  My expectations could not have been lower. Then something magical occurred.  This new place, complete with a new indoor/outdoor bar, addition of new giant flat screen TV's, and a wait staff that looks suspiciously similar to the girls of Hooters, just blew me away.  To say Bonfires a bar-B-Que take on Hooters, is to do this place a serious disservice.  The BEST thing about Bonfires is the Bar-B-Que!!  The food is among the best bar-B-Que I have had, including many business trips to places like Texas.  And the prices are reasonable too.

Goodness gracious this was one night packed with incredible flavors and a wonderful collection of plates aimed for ease of sharing. I had read so many great reviews about Saltyard shortly after moving to Atlanta and I was so excited to have dinner with my lovely, my awesome boss, and one of our mutual friends. \\n\\nIt was Friday night and we had a reservation for 6:30pm; the place was already hoppin'. We arrived a bit early to avoid all of the traffic madness on Peachtree, so we all stooped over the bar for a fine potations. Speaking of cocktails, the folks creating the beverages are something fierce. I've tried a few varieties of cocktails and I've absolutely loved them all. Namely, A Sip Of Spirit -- American Spirit, lemon, iced tea. It's like a grown up version of a grown up version of an Arnold Palmer. Hellllooooo, Summer! Also, my wife (still pregnant at this time) ordered a few mocktails which were splendid. I don't recall the mixture, but I did ask for one, but with gin added. Thus, making it an un-mocktail. It was blissful. \\n\\nFood? Food, you say? I'm pretty sure we had it all. Everything we ordered was perfect for a table of four and not a single one of us to be found wanting. Here's what I can remember -- \\n\\nCheddar-Bay Biscuits -- Um, yes, please. These little devils are the kind of things you could easily devour by the dozen. Fantastic. \\n\\nPiquillo Peppers - Stuffed with chevre. I remember all of us looking up from our plates on this one with a \\"Oh yes\\" type of look. Absolutely divine. \\n\\nTuna Tartare -- It was a pretty generous portion and the freshness was insane. Only two of us dove into this plate, so more for me. Huzzah. \\n\\nBrussels - I know everyone is finally into brussels sprouts these days, but hot damn. These were some of the most amazingly prepared sprouts that I have in my memory. The sweet chili added a dynamic that should be adopted for anyone frying up a batch. Probably my favorite plate. \\n\\nGrilled Street-Style Corn -- My mantra: \\"If there is ever Mexican street corn on the menu, I'm going to order it.\\" We did. It was amazing. I had it all over my face and beard. Win. \\n\\nCrispy fish tacos -- Of course, they were delicious. I don't remember how many came to a plate, but I do remember eating two of them and being extremely overjoyed. \\n\\nBeet and Chevre Ravioli -- This was a dish after my wife's own heart. It was divine. I'm glad I got to have a bite. \\n\\nDessert - We tried the Chocolate Nemesis and the S'more Bread Pudding. I'm not always the biggest chocolate fan in the world, but both of these \\"scratched the itch\\" on the chocolate front. I can definitely see why so many people go nuts for the Chocolate Nemesis. It's not a dessert I'd gravitate towards, but it was really fun to eat. \\n\\nSaltyard is the kind of place I'd love to make a reservation or just saunter in after a long day for a cocktail. The menu has so many angles and plays that you can prepare for a full meal or decide on a snack tim approach with ease. The thing I love about this is that it gives you the option of choosing a specific pricepoint for yourself. You don't get that option everywhere. \\n\\nVery thankful for the serious attention to flavor, ingredients, preparation, and presentation from all departments of the kitchen and the bar.

So you can have a world's different experience depending on what you get. I also got a tamale which I was very impressed with. Not the best I've had (my fave is Cactus Taqueria in Berkeley) but had the same good qualities- flavorful chicken (don't know if they use different stuff for the tamales vs burrito?), fluffy masa and not dry/thick/crusty like alot of tamales can be.\\n\\nI also hear the owner is super nice and the jalapeno martinis are good so I'll have to check that out next time.

So, my mom and I made it a habit to have this as the go-to for dim sum, I insisted she always be with me because she knows Chinese tons better than I do. And I'll say, this place is great for the food, location, cheap prices, and dim sum served all day. \\n\\nHowever, I decided to be brave and went 2x on my own. BIG mistake. First time, I asked repeatedly and loud, for a FORK to multiple staff (there's only a handful there, same ones every day) because my chopsticks skills are less than stellar. I was IGNORED. Thankfully I didn't end up flinging any food at other diners at the table! Second time, I asked for WATER, and again, I asked repeatedly and loud to different staff, and was IGNORED. (Note that I did get water the 1st time when I asked). The staff are not idiots, and they do know enough English to understand 'fork' and 'water'. So they just flat out ignore me and my English speaking ways. \\n\\nSo, if you're Asian/Chinese and too 'American' or don't speak Chinese, then you'll likely get mistreated like I did. Doesn't matter if they're busy or not. Only go there if you speak Chinese or have someone with you that does! I was even tempted to call one of my friends who does speak full Chinese, and have him tell the staff to get me water and a fork! (I didn't end up doing that because that would just be pathetic to have to do that lol, but man, I was tempted!). But when my mom was with me, we got tons better treatment.

The informal structure, the homey feel to the kitchen and his easy-going demeanor all contribute to a great experience. Mark de-mystifies even the most couture-sounding dishes and techniques.  \\n\\nHis firm advantage is that he enures everyone is involved in the prep, and in *every* aspect of the meal (he doesnt divide it up so some people prepare the main, some people prepare a side) so you leave knowing how to cook a complete meal.  It's also the kind of foods that you can cook for dinner for two or entertain with.  \\n\\nHe explains the end-game (eg \\"Chop them to this size, they're going to be eaten/in the gravy/just for decoration\\") so you're not left bewildered/wondering if you did it right.  I do wish he had another stove or two, so more of the students could participate in that aspect, but he explains everything so fully, shows you everything, that you dont feel very left out of the experience at all.\\n\\nGreat for a date night, a gift, or simply to learn something new (even if you've been cooking a while).

Instead of being greedy and charging guests to valet their vehicles for $26 in the valet only parking lot, maybe you should allow customers to park in the \\"hotel parking lot.\\" Never have I ever been to a hotel where I pay $150 a night and not have a specified parking area for guests. It's like a feeding frenzy for parking spots. Not only that, but there is a Salvation Army care spot on the back side alley of the hotel so it's not exactly the safest place to be walking at night to get to your vehicle especially if you had to park far. Unexceptable when you do have a parking lot but rather use it to make money. Where is the customer appreciation? Not only was parking an issue, upon leaving my room to check out, the house keeping lady stopped me and said \\"oh, 406?\\" Looking at here clipboard, \\"are you checking out? Cause checkout is at 11am.\\" I responded in shock cause I clearly had seen checkout time was 12pm on my email confirmation. But doubting myself I listened to her. She told me that instead of getting charged a checkout fee cause I was \\"late,\\" she said she would mark it off on her clipboard stating she cleaned the room at 11am if I left her a nice tip. She ended out conversation  stating that I didn't have to go down and checkout because she would take care of it all. Me being who I am, I thought about it for a brief 5 minutes and decided to do the right thing and properly checkout instead of mysteriously recieving a bill for another night or so cause I didn't check out. Turns out checkout time was at 12pm. I alerted the staff only to over hear the supervisor briefly scold the house keeping lady about it and then telling her to proceed to clean another room. The location is great, right at the heart of the city and attractions. The room was nice. The hotel was nice. The staff was beyond nice(except my checkout incident) Being honest here, I would never come back, I wouldn't recommend anyone to stay here just because of there two sole reasons."},{"name":"Swift's Attic","address":"315 Congress Ave, Ste 200","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"My friends and I decided to check out Swift's Attic while we were in Austin for a conference (it's only a short walk from the conference center).. From the second we walked in, I knew we were going to have an awesome afternoon. The ambiance was incredible and the staff was extremely welcoming. Once the seven of us were seated, our server, Mark, went through the lunch specials including the $4 cocktail special which was a pomegranate and vodka cocktail. Since I still had a few hours until my next meeting, I decided to give it a try. It was definitely worth the $4, although maybe a bit sweet for my taste.\\n\\nAfter we got our drinks, it was time to order. While we ordered, Mark made sure to point out which items were on the lighter side in case people wanted to add an appetizer or soup to their order. I ended up going with the Pop Rocks & Edamame for a starter. The Pop Rocks & Edamame was not only delicious, it was the most fun I've ever had eating a meal. The whole table enjoyed them and it really set the mood for a great lunch.\\n\\nFor my main course, I decided on their burger since they were made out of pork cheeks.  My burger was out of this world. I've eaten a lot of burgers and I must say this one was the best. Plus, it was the perfect size, big enough to be filling, but small enough that I wasn't stuffed. The fries were also perfectly cooked and a great compliment to the burger.\\n\\nThe Haute Country Shrimp Boil was the most popular item at our table, with three people ordering it. The shrimp were grilled wild gulf shrimp and it came with a sausage-corn sufrito, new potatoes, and a preserved celery salad. Since this was one of the meals that our waiter had said was on the light side, most people also ordered a cup of the tomato soup.\\n\\nThe second most popular item at our table was the Swift's Attic Puffy Tacos starter which were an open face corn taco with pigtail carnitas, citrus & red onion relish, and grilled grapefruit. My friends then both chose the Thai Salad. While they had ordered chicken, there was a mix up and they ended up with shrimp. The waiter offered to fix it but it would take about 10 minutes. My friends didn't mind so they stuck with the shrimp which they said probably tasted better anyway. We were really impressed with how great Mark and the other staff were about trying to fix their mistake and make sure everyone was happy.\\n\\nThe last entree ordered by my group was the Beef Kabob with chili & cumin rubbed organic angus flank, chimichurri, creme fraiche, and house made flatbread. This item also fell into the light category but with a cup of soup was quite filling. My friend said it looked as good as it tasted.\\n\\nIt's a rare event when everyone is extremely happy with not only the restaurant but with their choice of meal. However, Swift's Attic definitely accomplished both. They were even able to split our check which was wonderful since we were all paying separately.

Yes, for a restaurant, that's already a very red flag. The place was noticeably messy with a few tables not cleaned (when there were only three other tables occupied, and two servers.)\\n\\nWe ordered our favorite pho and drinks, and when the pho arrived, we noticed that, just like another Yelper mentioned, the noodle was in one big lump still stuck together.  We had to use our chopsticks to separate the noodles.  That was fine afterwards, especially after letting it soaks for a while in the soup.  That, however, made the soup not as hot, but still good enough. \\n\\nWe're not sure the amount of noodle and meat has decreased, but in my case, it was filling enough and so I didn't really notice. \\n\\nThe drinks were fine, and are still our favorite part of going to that location. (BTW, the same franchise owner apparently runs the Granville location as well; so the teas there are relatively the same, although we seem to prefer the ones at the W49th location.)\\n\\nThe funny thing is, when I mention the noodle situation the server when paying, she said she knows, and that the kitchen does that on purpose.

But there was absolutely nothing good about my first experience.\\n\\nAfter reading over the menu I decided to try the chicken sandwich. The less than friendly woman behind the counter quickly told me that they were out of chicken sandwiches. Really? The restaurant serves 3 entrees: chicken sandwich, chicken biscuit and fried chicken. And they're out of chicken sandwiches? Shut down or send someone to Kroger for whatever you're out of! How pathetic for a new restaurant.\\n\\nI settled on the Chicken Biscuit and a side of Mac and Cheese. The decor incorporates bags of White Lily flour so I had high hopes about the biscuits coming of their kitchen. But. The biscuits were disgusting. The flour hadn't been sifted properly when they were made and the result left a less than desirable biscuit. Also... they were several, several hours (maybe a day or two) old. Don't get me wrong. I love old biscuits. Especially to make dressing or stuffing. But for a chicken biscuit? No.\\n\\nThe chicken inside the biscuit was cold and I couldn't taste any seasoning. Pepper and salt would do wonders. Are they using any of the hot sauce they've got in their window display in the chicken batter? It could use some. \\n\\nNow let's discuss the worst part of the meal. The Mac and Cheese. Kraft out of a box would've been better than this! If it wasn't two or three days old I will eat my hat. The Mac and Cheese had been sitting in the wax covered paper bowl it was served in for so long that the oil from the Mac and Cheese was seeping through the sides of the bowl. That doesn't happen in 30 minutes or even an hour. That Mac and Cheese had been sitting for a long time and it sure had a taste to match. It was absolutely gross. \\n\\nOh, and the sweet tea? Dear little baby Jesus. There was enough sugar in that tea to cause instant diabetes. The tea was so sugary it was thick. \\n\\nThis is a simple concept. It's fried chicken. It shouldn't be hard to execute.

Well, they don't call it that, but I don't know Spanish too well. But Creative Loafing reviewed them in last week's issue and it sparked my interest. I'm a big fan of new food experiences.\\n\\nI went there by myself because I know it'd gross out my girlfriend. I brought a magazine (The Wire) to keep myself entertained. When the hostess saw this she sat me by the window. I thought that was a nice touch.\\n\\nInstead of automatically serving you chips and salsa you have a choice of several salsas. I went with the cheapest and the hottest - the habanero ($1). The portion is tiny but powerful. So far so good.\\n\\nI couldn't find non alcoholic drinks on the menu (I was trying to keep the bill down) but I might have been handicapped by my non-Spanish  reading skills. I asked if they have Mexican sodas. They do, and I went  with \\"Mexican cola\\" which turns out to be Coke. The coke they serve in Mexico that is. It uses cane sugar instead of corn syrup and is tasty!\\n\\nSo, on to the tacos. I got the afore-mentioned chicken heart taco and a lengua taco. You have a choice of flour or corn tortilla. Naturally I chose corn. The chicken hearts are about the size of strawberries. They naturally taste much like the rest of the bird but the texture is more chewy. Much like the lengua (beef tongue) taco.

The deal is you can put in your bowl everything you want,  no specifics as to how high you pile it up.  The  choices are chicken, beef,  lamb  and pork. If you want seafood,  add $3.  You then add veggies and/or noodles and the sauces you like.  However,  the bowl is small that you won't really be able to get as much as you like.  They stopped me from adding more veggies and noodles because they said my bowl is full already.  They told me to return the veggies if I want noodles.  I pleaded to get just a small amount of noodles but they didn't allow me.  \\nWhen I took a picture of my food being cooked on the giant round heated plate,  the cook changed his mind and asked me which kind of noodles I wanted and added some.

Knowing this, we ordered two smaller plates (lobster hush puppies and seafood cassoulet) and split the smoked chicken entr√©e.  No complaints about anything, but the chicken was the standout for both of us.  First of all, it could feed two people even without appetizers.  But more importantly, it was delicious.  The mustardy Alabama white sauce was new to both of us, and a nice twist on plain old roast chicken.  \\n\\nLoved the beer selection because it is so seasonal - not just a few house standards with one winter beer thrown in.

Im not too sure about dinner. THe place has a very open air feeling because of the high ceilings and its VERY portland (style, decor, staff). \\n\\nWe came and ordered three dishes to share amongst the three of us. We got the Grilled Asparagus with bacon and fried egg (runny yolk of course!), Shakshuka (which is red pepper n tomato stew with baked eggs), and the Polenta n sausage ragu with mozzarella and fried egg. I have to say the Polenta was my favorite out of all the dishes. It wasnt heavy, but more on the light side and the flavors of the sausage ragu blended so well with the polenta and the runny egg. I liked the asparagus mainly because i was craving veggies (traveling to new cities = not enough veggies or fruits), but it was something you can probably make at home for WAY cheaper. The Shakshuka was A-OK. i think it just reminded me of a tomato sauce with lots of veggies and bread on it. Stil i guess it wasnt the best choice for us to order for brunch, but we had to try it.\\n\\nThere was a lot of street parking and its all walk able. Theres a great coffee shop near by as well. This place gets quite crowded around 11AM, so come early like we did because seating is limited at this place! They dont take reservations either, unless its a large group. \\n\\noverall it was a good restaurant, but compared to the large variety and creativity that is Portland's restaurant and dining scene this place was only just average. \\n\\nRecap:\\n1) POLENTA n SAUSAGE RAGU\\n2) No reservations unless its a large group\\n3) easy street parking!"},{"name":"The Yaletown Distillery Bar + Kitchen","address":"1131 Mainland Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"I came on Monday and they had a special for veal pasta and flat bread.

This place is definitely a big spot for pre-TD game/concert-goers. We went on a weeknight of a game and the place was relatively full and then cleared out by game time. I had the Sulmontina - veal with mushrooms in a spicy tomato sauce. It came with a side of linguine in red sauce as well.

Although, their dim sum menu is vast, we find it was difficult to call to call more than two (2) of the items our favorites this Friday night. \\n\\nAs other dining patron said, \\"Everything's pretty good, but something's just a little bit off in taste and it's in just about every dish.\\" \\n\\nThe \\"bads\\" first: The Bean Curd Rolls are supposed to be savory and a little bit sweet, but at Hai Du, they were sour; from my experience, this happens when the ingredients are old. The Shrimp Dumplings (Har Gow) were not really plump and didn't taste like shrimp. The Sticky Rice in Lotus Leaf and Steamed Pork Buns were unbelievably salty. The Chive Dumplings fell apart easily and the dumpling wrapper wasn't smooth or silky but grainy and thick. The Congee was watery and was missing slivered ginger. The Egg Tarts were dried out and needed more egg custard filling. The Tripe tasted watery and dull. The Turnip Cake tasted a little sour, but not as sour as the Bean Curd Rolls. The Sui Mai were hard, not tender, not fresh and absolutely not visually appealing; worse tasting and looking than the stuff in the Asian markets' frozen aisle. \\n\\nThe \\"goods\\" second: The Sugar Cane Shrimp Balls were perfection and accompanied with Americanized Chinese Sweet and Sour Sauce. The Sliced Fried Tofu with Shrimp was delicious. From tonight's experience at Hai Du, it appears that their food strengths are in fried foods. \\n\\nThe service at Hai Du should not be overlooked. There were two large parties in the first dining room and even though each party had more than 10 people each, we received AMAZING service from Hai Du's staff. They went the distance to fill out waters (maybe because they knew a lot of the dishes were salty) and checked on how our dinner was went throughout the evening. They anticipated our needs, and we never had to ask for extra napkins. \\n\\nWe maybe back for dinner off their main menu.

Generally things that have been touched by Robuchon, Thomas Keller, Hubert Keller, Ogden, Puck, Flay, Conant, Coliccio et all. My issue with just about all of those places is that forgive me for stating the obvious, but they are very commercial and very sterile. \\n\\nI personally believe that the crew at Beast is doing something truly special here. It's intimate, well orchestrated, but never did I get the impression that I was being rushed or that I was part of some machine trying expand a mega-global empire. \\n\\nThe food overall was excellent and since the menu changes constantly it's nearly pointless for me to recommend something. And oh yeah the fact that its a fixed menu precludes that anyway. \\n\\nMushroom soup- small bits of hazelnuts were in the soup and provided a great textural contrast to the creaminess of the veloute. \\n\\nFrom what I can see in previous reviews the charcuterie plate is standard fare, but the foie gras bon-bon is a technical masterpiece. It is single handedly one of the best things I have ever eaten in my life. (Insert off color joke here. HEYO!)  \\n\\nThis particular night we were served a perfectly roasted duck breast. I personally could have tolerated a bit more salt but that is not to say the dish wasn't perfectly seasoned, it's just that I really enjoy my red meats salted a bit more than the next guy.

It was other worldly. \\n\\nI'll spare you the blow by blow of the rest of the dishes but please don't take it as a slight, rather I'd rather not get into a 4 page review. \\n\\nSome people have complained about being seated with COMPLETE STRANGERS at a table. \\nUghh.......

This is one of those ideas that I'm sure a business degree manager came up with that looked good on paper (likely digital paper) but doesn't translate in practice. \\n\\nThe dishes we ordered were mediocre, but considering the price, not awful. My large pasta was $18 and contained a good portion or chicken and prosciutto. \\n\\nIf you're coming for the atmosphere you'll probably enjoy yourself. I'd be very clear when you engage the server to order so you know what you're getting."},{"name":"Jester King Brewery","address":"13187 Fitzhugh Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Cool outdoor picnic area.

I also noticed an advertisement for free bowling after 9pm. Not sure if this is on a specific day... or if it's every day, or other stipulations around it, but if it worked out that you were able to take advantage of it... that sounds like something that would be great to do with a group of friends - come BEFORE 9, pay for a few games, then stay AFTER 9 and play the rest of the games for free... eat, drink, and be merry.\\n\\nHopefully my next venture to Kings won't take me so long to get back!

Having said that, the Brookline location has atmosphere and good service.  Not Natick.\\n\\nMy wife and I were looking for something \\"better than average\\" for breakfast on Friday AM.  A rare and treasured mid-week breakfast outing for us.  We walked in around 8:30 and the place was almost empty.  We like sitting at the bar anyway and did so.  \\n\\nThe bartender initially gave us decent service, taking our orders and getting us coffee, but everything was pretty bad after that.  Once we ordered the bartender ignored us doing prep work and other things as we sat.  I wouldn't have cared except that you can see the food window from our seats and I saw our food come up, 10 feed away from where the bartender was working, and it took her a good 5 minutes to turn around and check on it.  I blame her only partially for this as the kitchen crew could have easily made some indication that the order was ready and they didn't.  Clearly some animosity between these crews.\\n\\nWhen our meals came the over easy eggs my wife ordered were, no exaggeration, sitting in a pool of oil.  We sent them back and the bartender told us they use some flavored oil stuff to cook the eggs.  She yelled back to the kitchen to re-do the order and told them how to make the eggs not so greasy.  \\n\\nHere is the deal, I cooked breakfast in diners and other restaurants for a long enough time to know that using way too much oil makes your job much easier.  The eggs flip easier and cook faster.  But zaftigs isn't some greasy spoon and these two eggs with toast and home fries cost $7.  Simply not acceptable.\\n\\nMy wife's order also included the wrong toast and the side of fruit they garnish the plate with was warm and mushy from being under the heat lamp.  The homefries are nothing more than deep fried potato chunks.  The bartender never came back to check on us or clear our plates and we had to ask for our checks.\\n\\nThe only thing that kept me from 1 star was that my entree was actually decent, although still way too expensive for what it was.\\n\\nI have now been here twice and both times came away feeling kind of ripped off.

The chips are always hot and crispy with the perfect amount of salt, and the salsa is fresh with a kick. \\n\\nOnce you're seated, service is efficient and friendly. The appetizers are delicious and not to be missed. Try their signature Tejas Chicken, it's their version of buffalo chicken served crispy and juicy on skewers with Mexican hot sauce. The Cajun Popcorn is also tasty, a generous amount of shrimp with a tangy dipping sauce. Another customer favorite is the Chorizo Flambado, a skillet of chorizo sausage and tomato with bubbling cheese and warm soft tortillas. \\n\\nMove on to the meal and go for the fajitas. The portions are enormous and I challenge two people to clean the plate. A heaping portion of meat or fish and spiced grilled onions arrive at the table fragrant and steaming. Choose from blackened chicken, steak, blackened catfish, or El Pueblo shrimp. All are delightfully marinated and/or blackened. They're served with all the fixings (cheese, pico de gallo, lettuce, sour cream, guacamole) and come with tortillas and your choice of their popular jambalaya or traditional rice and beans. \\n\\nMinus one star for the ruckus but overall it's a great place to be.

Not bad, but not noteworthy.\\n\\nCheese: Passable, but could have used a bit more oven time to get that slight bubbling that adds to the overall flavor.\\n\\nToppings: Sparse and slightly off-kilter in the flavor category.

So this restaurant seemed like the perfect combination.  My family took me there for father's day this past Sunday, and it was with some excitement and anticipation that we went.  \\n\\nFirst the parking.  It was impossible to find on-street parking.  I ended-up using their valet parking, which was not well marked as such.  I thought that I had found a metered space, but then the valet came out, and I caved in.  $16.  I gave him a $20, and he assumed that I was giving him a $4 tip.  I didn't realize that he didn't give me any change until after I went into the restaurant.  Not a big deal, but I'd like a say in how much and when I tip.\\n\\nIt took a while for the waiter to take our order, but he was very nice -- indeed, the waitstaff was generally very pleasant.  The restaurant is tiny, and the atmosphere was gasto-pub.  We ordered the foie gras terrine and charcuterie.  The terrine was so-so, we had better at Artistry on the Green in Lexington -- not enough liver flavor.  The charcuterie was very good.  A word on the bread basket. It contained two kinds of bread -- a hard crust white bread which was very good, and an irish soda bread which was not.  When I mentioned that to the waiter, he admitted that he knew that the irish soda bread was not good.  *sigh*\\n\\nWe ordered the porterhouse for two, and two pasta dishes.  The portions were small.  My pasta dish (with lamb) was over-salted, and not particularly filling.  The porterhouse steak was not particularly well cooked.  I expect a good sear on steak, and the borders to be a medium, with a good red cool center for medium-rare.  This steak did not have a sear, and was just plain undercooked.  Maybe I'm expecting too much, since my last steak was at SW Steakhouse at Wynn, and the steak before that at Grill 23, but if you're going to serve steak, then you have to be prepared to play with the big boys.\\n\\nThe kids complained that they were still hungry after the meal, as was I.  Check without tip was still $200 (plus the valet).   While we're glad to have gone once, just to see what all the fuss was about, I don't think that we're coming back again.  The butcher shop just doesn't compare well to other gastro-pubs.  For example, we had lunch at the Spotted Pig in NYC a couple of months ago, and we left raving about the food, and the check was very reasonable.

After telling the waitress that we did not want the soup she left it on our table (even though we moved it as far away as possible to the corner from which she was serving) forcing us to inhale the odor until we had to ask her to move it. \\n\\nThe food was decent (not great) the service was terrible. Just to be sure that I would never return as the waitress was giving me a box so that I could take my meal home she spilled my drink all over both me and my food. She said that she would have them make me another meal and when I opened the box once getting home I found that all they did was scrape my old meal into a to-go box after reheating it."},{"name":"Zuffy's Place","address":"1860 Corporate Blvd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Great neighborhood feel but a little smokey.

I would advise reserving if after 6pm, since it seems to fill up quickly. \\n\\nThough I could not partake in adult beverages, my dining mates could and it seems that they do a nice mix of classic cocktails and the menu offerings. There were no complaints from those who ordered. We skipped appetizers since none of us was ravenous and ordered for dinner- getting a good mixture of the menu. I ordered the Bowl Azteca, wtih adobo-spiced quinoa, tomatillo soaked hominy, lightly sauteed spinach, some fresh corn, summer squash, and a spice rubbed chicken. It was delightful. Fellow diners ordered the Earth Bowl, with root vegetables and squash, and added shrimp, the Bowl Azteca with shrimp, Mahi Mahi fish tacos, steak frites, and a Caesar salad topped with skirt steak- all of which were delicious and very fresh offerings. I admit that a return visit full of appetizers will have to happen since the buffalo cauliflower (!?!) at a nearby table smelled delicious and pulled pork nachos are calling my name. \\n\\nThe service was good, including asking if a menu request I made (no avocado) was a request or allergy-related; it's always good when a place will ensure an allergy free experience.

The bustle of CP, but without the horrid shortage of servers (yes there are enough cart pushers, but you need to walk a quarter of a mile to get some h20).\\n\\nWinsor is quiet, and miniscule compared to any of the large tea houses in chinatown.  If you don't number in the 6's or up, you'll probably need to share a table on weekend lunch hours.  I ordered the shumai, uchoy, chang fen with beef (steamed rice noodles), pork soup dumplings, and chao zhou fen guo, which is a rice flour skinned dumpling with waterchestnut, pork, and peanuts inside.  The fen guo had a slight tart taste, and was not as good as CP's, which happens to have my favorite version.  the chang fen was also not so great.  The noodles were mushy relative to the CP version, which again has my favorite along with hei la moon.  The meats though, are really great here.  The pork parts of each dish in every tea house in Chinatown are mostly flavorless, and hide themselves behind the shrimp.  One reason Dim Sum is a love hate thing for me is the freakish overusage of shrimp.  The shumai here are mostly pork, but in all its juicy goodness.  The XLB are mostly the same as most cantonese versions.  they're seasoned with scallions on the inside, but the ones here use chunks of collagen rich bits so it's not a homogenous meatball.  The one issue is that the vinegar in the dish they provide has a funky after taste, like artificial fruit flavoring or something.  The vinegar in the bottle on the other hand, is definitely different.  It's darker than the maraschino cherry red of the provided vinegar, and it tastes normal, so I would recommend using that instead.\\n\\nI will definitely have to try more of the menu to know if this will be my go-to spot in chinatown for dim sum, but if you're sick of the shrimp bombardment, this is basically the only option."},{"name":"Shoal Creek Saloon","address":"909 N Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Omg...the shrimp po-boy and boudin here is FREAKIN AWESOME!!!

The waitress literally forgot we existed. Twice. I have no idea how you do that since we were sitting between two other tables which she was waiting on, but okay. Maybe she was coming down off a 3-day coke and Super Mario bender and forgot about her morning shift. No judgment, we've all been there. Anyway, we ended up getting the wrong food after an hour of waiting all the while surrounded by hipsters who, in their endless quest for being as unique as possible, somehow ended up all looking exactly the same. Seriously, I've seen more diversity in a Mormon church and those people are one Hugo Boss uniform away from the Third Reich. Anyway, back to the food. Have you ever read a recipe wrong and added 8 lbs of salt to your food instead of the 2 tsp it called for? That's what I think happened because there's no other excuse for what we were presented with. This was utterly unfit for human consumption. Since the food was free due to the absent service and we were given a gift card for our next visit, we just ended up leaving instead of spending another hour trying to get something that doesn't resemble deer bait. \\n\\nFast forward two months. On the return trip, the service was an improvement but still absurdly slow. Seriously, these people are half the age of the ladies that wait on tables at Denny's but somehow manage to ambulate as if they were 90 year old stroke victims. When the $15/hr minimum wage goes through there needs to be a provision exempting every single waitress at this place because they move with the gusto of present-day Paul Walker. Even though the service was an improvement the food was still the same. HOW DO PEOPLE EAT THIS MUCH SALT? I'd recommend changing the name of the joint to Salty's but my girlfriend informs me that it's already taken. Maybe Salty n Sons? Tasty n Salt? Salt n Salt?\\n\\nIn summary: Food sucked twice.

I've had to return excessively soggy macaroni 'n' cheese, pushed aside a bowl of spicy Texas beef chili that tasted like the tin can it no doubt came out of, and forced myself through a bowl of mediocre mussels.

The deviled eggs were admittedly tasty, but we don't eat it enough to compare it.\\n\\nThe last dish, goat stew, was good, but it should be for a dish that is  almost $20. It wasn't too spicy and although they give you rice to eat it with, it's not an overpowering flavor on its own. Nonetheless, more rice would have been appreciated.

I got the 3 piece tenders with fried pickle chips. The tenders and sandwiches come with 2 sauce choices so I got the Donkey Sauce and the Nashville Hot Honey. The tenders came out very quickly and very hot, so I would recommend grabbing a fork before digging in. They have a panko style breading, so it's not heavy/crispy, but they did taste really good and juicy. Of my 2 sauces, I preferred the Donkey sauce since the Nashville sauce was too much honey and not enough spice for me. However, both were tasty overall and I like the idea that there are SO MANY flavors to pick from.\\n\\nThe pickle chips were also very good. They were warm when they came out, although not as hot as the chicken. Still, I'd recommend grabbing a fork if you have sensitive fingers.

We didn't have any problems with the lane or anything, once you get the hang of entering the players names (if you mess up like I did and add extra bowlers they can fix it for you at the counter).

Finding a ball ( All weights and sizes are arbitrarily intermingled on one ball return) is just stupid. Large 10's, small 7's and XL 15's and one of everything in between.

Contrary to other reviews I have not been disappointed in the food, in fact I'd rate it as good as most of the other Thai places in Boulder (though they do seem to be out of things rather often each time we visit).

Seriously, what's up with that?  Perhaps I'm just unlucky and catching them on days that they're closed for some reason or another, but the concept of a spur-of-the-moment lunch means not having to call to see if somewhere is open.  We've unfortunately been convinced by this to switch allegiances to a different local Thai place, which is sad because I truly liked the decor and the food here, despite the sometimes-slow service (they were at least quite friendly and kind), but closing randomly in the middle of the weak is a deal-breaker for us."},{"name":"Tasty n Sons","address":"3808 N Williams Ave, Ste C, Hub Building","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"The reviews called the french toast the best in town, and the waitress echoed this claim.

I was excited to have a little bit of home with me here in Austin. I know that Shoal Creek has been great to all of the LSU fans that have bombarded Austin, but I have yet to make it to a game day party there.\\n\\nWhen my friends (all from Louisiana as well) decided to go to Shoal Creek for dinner, I was more excited to go. The menu looked fantastic, and I finally settled on the crawfish etouffee, a great classic Louisiana dish. I was a little puzzled when they asked if I wanted a cup or bowl of etouffee because I usually ate it on a plate, but I went with the bowl. When my etouffee came it out was a soup! Crawfish etouffee is NOT  a soup!  Sure I have had some runny etouffee in my life, but this was a bit ridiculous. Granted, I was starving so I ate it (after adding a good amount of hot sauce).\\n\\nI think the pricing is hit or miss. The price for the seafood baskets is legit, but the soups are way overpriced. \\n\\nI hope the next time I go to Shoal Creek they will stepped up their game.\\n\\nGeaux Tigers!"},{"name":"Habibi Kabob Grill","address":"2451 S Hiawassee Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Had lunch here this weekend with a friend.

The hostess came and told us there was a bar booth available for us. When we got to the table, waiting for it be cleared, someone else  was waiting for the booth.

There was also a piece of bread (as expected) and a slice of watermelon of all things on the table. Anyway:\\n\\nBrisket: Moist and tender, could have used a bit more smoke. Still good with some fat on it as requested.\\n\\nPork Belly Burnt Ends: I am now unsure why more places do not do this. It reminded me some mix of Chinese Cha Siu and Korean samgyeupsal; both sweet and fatty with a satisfying texture. Sure it was sweet but in a very good way. Only thing I'd recommend is to add a bit of spice to temper the sweetness a bit. Highly recommended.\\n\\nCorn Bread: Really good crust with OK bread inside. The bread itself could have used a bit more texture (maybe some larger pieces of corn baked in?)\\n\\nB&B Pickles: Sweet variety, I wanted something light and they helped cut the fat from the pork belly.\\n\\nOther people ordered a turkey club (said it was very moist and a really good sandwich overall,) wings, other meats (BBQ Beef Rib, pulled pork.)\\n\\nIn terms of their sauces, all were on the slightly sweeter side with my preference being the one with heat though I barely used any sauce at all as the meat was enjoyable on it's own.

Last night I had a marinated sirloin over a caesar salad from the nightly specials menu.  The steak was tender and the marinade flavorful.  A side of chimichuri sauce and a hot cherry pepper took the steak to another level. While the specials have consistently kept me happy I can not recommend the ribs.

Their fried ice cream is the only reason I would go though. \\n\\nThe other night, when we arrived, we were seated quickly, although it was busy. Then it took at least 20 minutes for somebody to come over and take our order. We ordered soda, and it probably took 10-15 minutes to get two sodas. After we got our soda it took our food at least 25 more minutes to come out. Again, the food was good, but we were done for quite some time before our waitress came over. I really like their fried ice cream, and we had one of those discount coupons for free fried ice cream with the purchase of $20, so we ordered some. The ice cream took another 20 minutes or so, and when we were finished with that we got our check in probably 15 minutes. \\n\\nThat is where it got worse. So they run a program where you get a card with a grid on it, and you get a stamp for every $10 you spend at Noodle St. After you spend certain amounts you get free stuff, or money off. Now, last time we went to Noodle St. (prior to this visit), we spent $29.85. They gave us 2 stamps, because we didn't spend another 15 cents. Okay, but that's fine. However, on this visit, when we spent about $25, but used a coupon, they refused to stamp our card. Then, we wanted to pay using a credit card, but it seems that since we used a coupon, we were mandated to pay in cash. We barely had enough cash on hand between us, so we paid and left. \\n\\nBottom Line: The food is usually pretty good, but quirky service and rules might ruin your experience."},{"name":"Easy Tiger","address":"709 E 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"The turkey sandwich is absolutely incredible.

Seemed an exhorbitant amount of food, but the bill came and it was $77, which i think is a steal for what was is pretty much my favorite place on the planet for breakfast.

Splitting a pitcher of heavily fruit-laced sangria coming from the massive decanter on the bar with the table is a good thing, but the acoustics of the restaurant could use some work, a bit difficult to talk in there without the ambient noise being a factor. I've never had to wait long for a table, even on a Friday/Saturday night.\\n\\nThe dark green olive oil they use is absolutely rich, though packed with coarse salt. It overpowers the bread a bit but... in a good way.\\n\\nThe Presunto da Casa con Queijo e Tomates is as you'd expect, the 'white cheese' tasting like bit a measure more smooth and less 'sinewy' than fresh mozzarella. The ham is also fairly delicate in flavor, closer to parma than regular prosciutto.\\n\\nThough they seem similar, I much prefer the Arroz de Mariscos a Valenciana over the Cataplana. The former is definitely for 2+, but when they simmer the rice in with the broth, the rice carries so much more flavor instead of having it served separately. Either way, it's messy to pick apart the shells, but the flavors imbued on the dishes from them only adds to the richness of the dish. They are particularly filling. The Carne de Porco a Alentejana was done fairly well, the clams selected fairly large, the loin charred done, though a bit dry. However, that's what the sangria solves...\\n\\nI haven't been there for lunch or tried the desserts yet, but will when I get a chance.

I thought we were in for a real treat.  I eat a lot of Mexican food. It's my favorite cuisine so I've been all over Orlando trying different places. I've definitely found my go-to spots but I'm always willing to try something new.  My husband and I went for lunch. It wasn't busy. We were greeted and seated immediately which was a plus.  Our server also greeted us quickly and another person bought over chips and salsa.  The salsa had a funny aftertaste. Almost like a bitter flavor. I put salt in it (something I've never done to salsa) to mask the aftertaste.  We got an order of queso for an appetizer. It was a pretty small order for the price. I mean it's Mexican food so nothing's ever going to be overly expensive but honestly it might as well have been a side order. I pretty much just let my husband have it because it wasn't really enough to share.  \\n\\nFor entrees, I ordered the lunch shrimp fajitas and my husband ordered the lunch beef tacos.  The food was just ok. My rice was really bland. Usually in a situation like that, I would have put some of the queso on it for flavor but there wasn't enough queso for that so I stole some of my husband's beans (my meal didn't come with beans).  The fajitas were ok.  They didn't come with guacamole which is a first for me. I've always gotten guacamole with my fajitas.  The food wasn't bad. It was just average. My husband agreed.

My oh my, that was a delight. A symphony for all senses.\\n\\nTruth be told, I was reluctant at first as the place was recommended by one of the tour guides on the hop-on hop-off trolleys. The rule of thumb is to avoid all tourist traps if you want to enjoy good food at a good price. But Turner's Seafood rose above the trap into unexpected highs. Those of you who have kids, you know how hard it is to go to a restaurant with a just woken up, fully energized, one and a half year old baby. Specially if it's a seafood place which requires an acquired taste. But that wasn't the case at Turner's. The staff was incredibly gracious and accommodating. Merely minutes after we set we were served with freshly baked bread rolls and our divine waitress Brianna rushed an order off the kids menu. A healthy plate with a hot dog, rice and broccoli, for a little over six dollars, quickly found its place in front of my restless daughter.  Then it was time for us adults for finally have a look at the menu.\\n\\nWe decided to go for a few appetizers instead of main courses as it all seemed delicious and we wanted to taste it all.  We began by ordering Lobster Bisque, Scallops wrapped in bacon, Mussels in white wine and a glass of wine each.  I really don't know where to start now, as my mouth is watery just from thinking about it. But I will try to do my best and serve them justice.\\n\\nA healthy portion of Lobster Bisque with thick chunks of lobster arrived. It was so rich and creamy, almost like a custard. Yet so light and undemanding as if you could eat buckets of it and still not get full.  Along side the Bisque we were served with the Mussels which were perfectly cooked in a bath of white wine, garlic and a hefty load of butter. You didn't even need to eat the mussels as the toasted bread that accompanied the dish was superb dipped in richness. And than it happened, a small plate with four scallops, wrapped in bacon and deep fried to perfection arrived at the table. And next to the plate was a small saucier with what they insist was only reduced Soy Sauce and Honey, but I don't believe it. That sauce was so freaking good, I wanted to drink it as is, bathe in it. It was if all the stars aligned above the stove as this deliciousness was slowly reducing. It had a kick to it and you just couldn't have enough of it. Paired with the scallops, it was a match made in hell, luring you to the dark side. Dear reader, you have no idea what's going on in my mouth right now.\\n\\nWe couldn't help ourselves and decided to order another round of scallops and we also called for Asian Nachos. Fresh Tuna cuddled in Wasabi on top of crispy fresh slaw and fried wonton. And next to it, what if not, the god like sauce.  Once again we devoured the scallops and made our way to the Asian Nachos. There is no other way to describe it but fucking good.  The honey soy sauce with the wasabi and the freshness of the tuna and the crunchiness of the wonton made your mouth clap. I then realized that there are still bread rolls on the table so they too immediately were dipped in sauce.\\nI couldn't resist it and asked Brianna to take some sauce back home with me. After a few minutes she returned with a smile and a container. Over the week I am going to try to recreate what happened there, wish me the best.\\n\\nAs you know, good food is not the only thing you expect at a restaurant and most of the time it's not even the most important thing. Good service is, and Turner's Seafood is a beacon of hope. Brianna our server and her fellow staff were the best experience I had in a restaurant in the US, hands down. So accommodating, so gracious, so perfect at what they do. If I could, I would go there every day. It is one of those places where the costumers end up feeling at home, a part of the family. It is a place that should remain a secret, off the beaten path, but Zagat already ranked them as one of the top restaurants in the Boston area and I am going to go ahead and place them amongst the top restaurants in the US. To top all that, our bill was only $138, including drinks and deserts, wow.\\n\\nI urge you to make the trip to Salem, avoid all the witchcraft nonsense, go to Turner's Seafood and have the best dinner of you life."},{"name":"The North End at 4580","address":"4580 Broadway St, Ste D-1","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"We came here for the second time recently.

It came with sour cream and salsa, which were great additions to soothe the heat. I did kind of wish that I got the tacos because they came with more veggies, and mine was pretty heavy. But whatevs, I had a salad for lunch which merits me eating a burrito for dinner, right? My friend also ordered the soon du bu (tofu soup).

The waitress seemed to have judged us for this matter of not ordering more, and asked in a condescending tone if we were going to order starters. I kindly said not today as we were also not too hungry. I've heard great things about Atlas' bread from friends and colleagues, so I was excited to try it. After about 15 minutes from ordering, the bread has yet to arrive. I had to look for our server and wave her over to ask if the bread was on its way. She informed us that she placed an order in already, but we still waited another 5-10 minutes before it actually arrived. At this points, our waters were empty. \\n\\nIn terms of the food, it was only okay for the price I paid. I liked how the entr√©e came in a reasonable amount of time. After getting our food, we were about 80% done when the server finally came around to check-in on our meals to ask if things were fine and finally refilled our waters (we only got it refilled ONCE throughout the entire meal). When we were done our meal, we waited for another long period to get our bill (again, lots of waiting!). In fact, we had to wave down another waitress to get our waitress to get our bill so we could leave. This waitress kindly took the plates away and went to get our waitress. \\n\\nThis was my first time experiencing Atlas Steak + Fish, and it will definitely be my last. For the same price (or even less), I'd rather take my family to The Keg or Cactus Club, where I'd receive much better service and get treated like a customer."},{"name":"Namaste Indian Cuisine","address":"1403 NE Weidler St","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"I was so excited to go to an Indian DINNER buffet.

I debated whether to out my relationship with you to friends, and when I did it was in a big way - bringing groups of 8 and 10 to your wobbly tables through the summer and fall of 2009.  We'd each pool $20, eat like kings and then distribute what was left -- because there was money left! -- at the end of the meal.  After one of those meals a new convert even ordered take out so he could eat the deliciousness coming out of your little four burner kitchen the next day.  I talked about you all the time; people would say I was in love.\\n\\nThen, after one particularly delicious meal, you told me you were moving.  First it was Back Bay.  Then Allston was under consideration.  I worried, and hoped for the best.  When I learned that you'd  chosen Central Square, I was ecstatic - a place where the quality of your food and the authenticity of your soul could remain pure, without the trip to Revere.\\n\\nAnd, then I waited.  And waited.  During this long wait, I even met someone, got married and during our courtship told him of my longing.  Needless to say, he was intrigued.  So when news came (finally!) of your opening, we came with open hearts and open mouths, only to discover that (at least for me) nothing was the same.\\n\\nLet's start with $80 for a dinner for 2.  That sum used to feed 6.   Some of this was due to alcohol, which you never had in Revere.  But, still, my favorite dishes nearly doubled in price.  I didn't even recognize you.  You had sports on TV.  Your servers didn't know about prahok -- a staple of Cambodian cuisine.  You were advertising chicken wing nights.  What happened to your somlah kako, your bok l'hong and cha krueng saiko?  Where did you go?\\n\\nMaybe it's opening jitters. Maybe you felt the need to be like all the other places, after moving to the big city.  Floating Rock -- you don't.  I loved you even when you were small and in Revere, and I know others did too.  You were great, and I'm hoping you still are.  \\n\\nShut off the strobe lights and just be you.   I'll be waiting.\\n\\nLove,\\n\\nJess"},{"name":"Tasty n Sons","address":"3808 N Williams Ave, Ste C, Hub Building","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Over 1000+ review, I'll keep it simple and explain why I didn't fall in love with Tasty n Sons; 3.5 for em. \\n\\nService 4-star: friendly and somewhat attentive \\nDecor 4-star: Modern / Rustic\\nFood: 3.5 star (See below)\\n\\nBacon Wrapped Dates with Almond 3 stars - I love bacon wrapped dates, but this order fell short; not balance, overpowering sweet even for my sweet tooth.\\n\\nSausage Ragu and polenta 2 stars - You must be a fan of Polenta or you won't like it.

They have a small menu of great offerings and a few additional daily specials on a chalkboard. Tonight I had the French onion soup, (as it was a cold wet rainy night soup was in order),  the steak frites and four dessert had the butterscotch pot de cr√®me. The soup was good but not outstanding. Portion was a bit small. The broth was really good but something was missing for me and I have had better French onion soup but again it wasn't awful. The steak frites were really good, steak was tender and loved the peppercorn sauce which had many peppercorns, and I can never get enough of frites and mayo. The butterscotch pot de cr√®me was the bomb and it tasted almost like salted caramel. I only wish there was more! I had a bite of the beef bourguignon that someone else ordered at the table and it was so tender and the chunks of bacon were great. \\n\\nAll in all a pretty decent meal but nothing really stood out for me. I think I'm possibly spoiled by running a food group and eating out so much.

I am sad to report that I was very disappointed with my first visit to The Maple Parlor. I had high hopes for their vegan soft serve options. I tried a sample of each one that was available today and left without buying a bowl, so I forgot to survey the vegan toppings. My friend didn't buy anything either after seeing my face and deciding to sample the vegan options for herself. She also thought that the place reeked of bacon, which was a real turn off. The chocolate banana flavor just tasted like cold watered down pudding. The coconut flavor tasted like a coconut water Icee, not creamy at all. The strawberry beet flavor was the most palatable of the three vegan options available today, but overly sweet sorbet wasn't what I wanted. I hope that The Maple Parlor is able to vastly improve their vegan recipes. If I hear through the grapevine that things are better, I will go back and sample again. Otherwise, I'll be getting my vegan soft serve at my usual spots around town."},{"name":"Easy Tiger","address":"709 E 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"For years I keep saying I will visit the Easy Tiger as many locals and Yelpers suggest it as must for foodies. Finally after a few years I found myself nearby and quite hungry, so it worked out quite well. \\n\\nThe top floor, which is street level has a small bakery, which looked delectable, but I was really in the mood for a lunchtime meal versus baked goods (Need to revisit for the baked goods though). Downstairs is where the main restaurant is, which offers a pub like atmosphere with plenty of seating. There is also an outside patio with ping pong table (perfect for beer pong), right next to a beautiful setting of a stream, which is nice and cool on hot days. As for the beer, quite a selection on tap and bottled, so it really plays well on the pub atmosphere. The food is your typical pub style, but with some twists. I ended up ordering the pastrami, which was recommended for around 14 dollars paired with a seasonal local pumpkin ale. Not usually a fan of pumpkin spiced beers, but this one was quite tasty! As for the pastrami, it was pretty darn good, but nowhere near the staples of pastrami at Langers or Katz (Google them!). As for the service, the waiter was quite attentive and was quite helpful when navigating the menu. \\n\\nWell worth the visit and on my list still for a revisit to their bakery which seems to get a lot of love on Yelp."},{"name":"Tasty n Sons","address":"3808 N Williams Ave, Ste C, Hub Building","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Amazing!

My go-to order at Tino's is the chicken platter with lemon chicken soup, steamed veggies, baba ghanoush, and rice. They throw in a pita wrap and some tzatziki sauce with your order, as well. Everything is well-seasoned, fresh, and delicious. I've only been disappointed once (and I come here a lot). They served me pre-cut chicken instead of freshly carved chicken and I could taste the difference. It was cold, unflavored, and a little hard.

Salad would be an overstatement... it was more like 2 pieces of lettuce with a soggy dressing. I'll give them the benefit of the doubt and say it was just for garnish. Nonetheless, the food was unimpressive and disappointing... especially for the 12 dollar price tag.\\n\\nTo Bobbys defense, when I called and complained they offered to make it up to me.. however the area has limited parking and I was in a rush so I declined.
