We ended up calling in our order and eating it back at our Airbnb which worked out perfectly. \\n\\nWe ordered 2 fried chicken and waffles, eggs sardou, traditional eggs Benedict, bananas foster French toast, and extra eggs for the boys. \\n\\nThe fried chicken and waffles came with 3 pieces of chicken each and each piece was as big as my head! They were boneless, moist, and despite ordering togo, screendoor was able to maintain its crispiness! The French toast was just as amazing! They packed the banana foster into a  separate container so the toast wouldn't be soggy. I wasn't able to try the rest of our order because I was so stuffed but the sides that came with it, cheddar grits, creamed spinach, and roasted potatoes were bomb! \\n\\nI highly recommend this place and suggest ordering takeout if you don't want to wait for the ridiculous line!"},{"name":"Sonsie","address":"327 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Sonsie delivered awesomeness all around.

I guess if you wanna snuggle with your boo or drink beer, it's okay. But the seating is on unique log pieces and most 2 seaters are across from each other. I went with my baby and 6 other adults. Fortunately, I didn't have to wait the 30-40 min to get our table but my peers did. Service was fairly quick. They tell you when you order that the chicken will take 20 minutes. The wings did not look anything like their menu. I preferred soy over hot. The skin of the chicken was crispy and had a nice crunch but also looked greasy in their dim light. Could only imagine with better lighting. A whole chicken and 18 wings had similar prices. We ended up getting 3 - 18 wings, a whole chicken, 2 soups, seafood pancake, and an order of clear noodles. We split our bill 7 ways and they added 12% gratuity making it just under $26 a person. I personally wouldn't go again. I did not leave full and did not desire the leftovers (pancake and clear noodles)."},{"name":"Little Big Burger","address":"2038 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"The food here is above average, definitely better than your typical fast food burger.

Not as cheap as drinking at home, but they only serve cans to reduce costs. Their fries are also delicious, and they are sprinkled with truffle oil. They're a bit too salty for my liking, but they go along great with the fry sauce they give you (If I remember correctly, it's ketchup mixed with mayonnaise. \\n\\nPrices are also reasonable and you can get a burger, fries and a beer for under ten dollars.

It was truly a wonderful night to be out in the city. My destination for the evening was a southwestern restaurant called Masa in the South End on Tremont Street. It had been over two years since I had been here and I was anxious for my return. \\n\\nI ordered off their 3-course prix-fixe menu for Dine out Boston. My spinach and artichoke flautas were out of this world. Two perfectly crisped tortillas stuffed with cheese, spinach and artichokes, were doused with a spicy, smoky red sauce that made my little tail wag feverishly. \\nThe entr√©e was a slow cooked chicken adobado with black bean mole, jalapeno cream salsa, grilled peaches. Here's where the tail stopped wagging. \\n\\nDon't get me wrong everything was expertly prepared, wonderfully flavorful, and beautifully presented. So why did my tail stop wagging? The portions were way skewed for my taste. The plate consisted of two very large, perfectly prepared portions of chicken (literally a half chicken), their grilled peaches should not be plural, I received  1/2 a grilled peach, and perhaps 6 wilted spinach leaves under the chicken. As I said, very unbalanced. Um, guys? How about some spicy pozole, mashed potatoes, or even some rice with the meal? Perhaps some steamed vegetables, anything, but a heaping plate of chicken with nothing else.  \\n\\nSo there you have it. Masa is a great restaurant, don't get me wrong, just be prepared. If you like all meat and little else, then you're all set. For me, the next time I go back, and I will go back because it's just that good, I will probably order a few items off their appetizer menu. At least that way I'll be able to control the balance of my meal.\\n\\nWith love from my dog bowl to yours...Happy Eating. shatasdogbowl\\n\\n3.5 paws"},{"name":"Cracker Barrel Old Country Store","address":"2150 Delk Rd","city":"Marietta","stars":"3","text":"Thanksgiving 2017 first year I didn't cook!

Bar-B-Q","address":"1238 Dekalb Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"This my first 5 star review!\\n\\nNow, just for some background, I LOVE BBQ! So, my wife and I have been to more then our fair share. We watch Pit Master's on TLC and my grill at home is Commercial grade!  I say that to say this, I may not have a lot of experience on many things, but one thing I do: BBQ!\\n\\nAnd my friends, Fox Bros BBQ in ATL is as good as it gets!\\n\\nI've been driving pass this place for the last 5 months. I kept meaning to stop in, but just never had the time. Until today...\\n\\nIf you want to know where all the cool, artist-type 20-somethings are on Sundays...look no further then Fox Bros. It was wall-to-wall with very cool people who were comfortable with their individualism. \\n\\nWhen we arrived, I was shocked that the parking lot was packed the way it was. As soon as we walked inside though, and the smell of some amazing BBQ wafting through. Immediately I was ready to sign my name on the wait sheet. (A wait sheet is never a bad thing to me...it  usually means something good is happening!)\\n\\nAs we waited, you got the feeling that this was a local folk hero establishment. The kind of place people say \\"When you're in Atlanta, you gotta go there...!\\". The people were laid back and having a good time. The staff were very trendy and friendly and seemed to like being attached to such a place. You can just tell when people are having fun when they're working. \\n\\nWe were seated on sunny, indoor terrace. I loved the feel of the place. Not one table matched and the chairs were old and beat up...in a good way. You could tell that the focus was on the food.  The menu was first class. It was a mixture of art and function, with a distinct feel. I appreciated the excellence put into something so small. \\n\\nTo start of with, ee ordered the Texas Fries for an appetizer! And we were not let down! The sweet sauce covering the golden fries had a hint of spice and were the best version of \\"cheese fries\\" I'd had in a long time. \\n\\nMy wife ordered the 1/2 rack of ribs and I got the 1/2 chicken. Both meats were AMAZING! Fox Bros has really perfected the texas, dry rub, smoking-style BBQ. The meat was tender and every bit was worth every penny. I even devoured my dark meat, which I don't normally eat at all! \\n\\nThe side dishes were good too and tasted more homemade then anything else. The macaroni and cheese stood out. It had a subtle kick to it that set it apart from others. And the baked beans were great as well. But with the meat so good, they really were just an after thought for me. \\n\\nIf there was a low spot to this meal, it was the Collard Greens and the Cole Slaw. I would suggest that if you come into the heart of ATL, you better either know how to serve good Collard Greens or don't serve them at all. Growing up on them, I like them one way...the traditional atlanta way. These were a texas version that I didn't really care for. The cole slaw too felt like it lacked the flavor attention given to the other dishes. Neither were bad, but just didn't feel on part with the rest of the food. \\n\\nWe didn't have room for desert, as the portions were huge! My wife and I both said that next time we would just share a plate. However, since we boxed the left overs and I got to eaat some a hour later, I can't really complain. \\n\\nAll in all, in a world of fast-food, franchised imitations of real BBQ, Fox Bros stands out as the pinnacle of BBQ in Atlanta. To me, they have set the bar to beat and have very few rivals. I expect to be a regular at Fox Bros and highly suggest you do too!"},{"name":"Lily's Sandwich","address":"10901 N Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I can wear a klansmen robe to a MLK Day parade and still not be as offensive as the banh mi here.

The baked goods were, as usual, very good, and I found the bakery staff to be much more effective at getting their food out and attending to the customer.\\n\\nI then waited another hour for my food to come out, and when it arrived it was cold. My food was utterly disgusting and had a clammy, curdled consistency. The gravy lacked any manner of seasoning, and while I ordered a side of grits (which I remembered liking greatly from my last visit in the old location) they were so unappetizing I could not finish them. I actually became very nauseous and thought I might vomit so left about half of my meal on the plate, something I have never done before. \\n\\nWhile the building is larger I feel that Se7en Bites has not scaled properly - it also has lost any signs it once had of being a local place run by passionate owners.

I was allowed to substitute mac & cheese for brussels sprouts, which literally filled me with glee. But not only were they willing to substitute it, they plated it beautifully even though that's not what it's supposed to look like. In addition to my M&C, on my plate was fried okra, lightly battered at an angle cut, and herbed mashed potatoes. On the side in a little skillet it came with collard greens in cheese. It was all delicious. All five of the other members in my party ordered the shrimp, scallops & grits and loved it. \\n\\nThe service was a TAD iffy, though I thought our server was really funny and pleasant. However, they were out of several wines, and when the server came back to tell us, he offered alternative suggestions. We said alright, without looking at the menu item and price, and the bottles turned out to be much more expensive. I don't think this guy did it on purpose, but it was a little careless not to suggest something in a comparable price range.\\n\\nAs a party of six girls, we were very satisfied with our location straight back by the windows, which afforded us a bit of quiet and privacy in the bustling restaurant. \\n\\nFinally, there was only one men's room and one ladies' room for the entire restaurant full of people.

I did like the strawberry vegan milkshake they made, with coconut milk I think, but I wish there were more of it, since it appeared to be smaller than the regular milkshakes.

Everything about the place from the decor, to the outside patio, to the relaxed and unhurried atmosphere created by the staff makes you  feel like you have been transported out of Central Florida to somewhere in the Mediterranean. Even the soft natural breeze that cooled the outdoor patio helped in completing the illusion. I felt like Anthony Bourdain discovering a culinary gem in an exotic corner of the world. Even though the food was the main attraction the staff made the evening. They were friendly, inviting, worldly, and took the time to talk to us like we were old friends that showed up unexpectedly. It was proudly explained to us that just about everything was made from scratch and after tasting it was obvoious that this was true. Maraya's proudly eschews many modern methods and instead chooses to prepare food in a more traditional and time consuming way. This care and love is evident in every bite of just about everything on the menu. I can't wait until my next visit. In the mean time I would not hesitate in recommending this restaurant to anyone looking for a great dining experience. The only tip I have is to make sure that time is not a factor when you dine at Maraya's.

It was hard to eat because the broth was so brined, and it greatly affected the flavor of all the other contents in the bowl. I paid for an over-salted meal that left me still hungry after eating. I understand ramen is trending and that it's something unique, but it's a trend that I don't particular like because of how it all depends on one factor: the broth. \\n\\nThe soup to noodle ratio is off, leaving your carbs soaked in salt water unless you order extra noodles. On top of that, you have to carefully proportion your meat (which in my case was their chashu), which means you get the occasional nibble of protein if you're smart or lucky. \\n\\nThe atmosphere and staff are friendly, but the food itself was mediocre.

They also will let you know what you can expect to be able to order by the time your turn is up as they keep a running list of what they have and what people in front of you are planning on ordering.  That all helps.  ;)  We've been a few times and each time lined up at 9/9.30a to a line that was already probably 30 people or so deep, and got our food by about 12.30/1p or so.  They were definitely sold out by 2.30/3p with some people in line not able to get anything more than a rib or two, and others nothing. I'm sure some days aren't as bad but that was our experience each time so it's what we plan for when we go.\\n\\nIf you live in the area or have time to spend it's totally worth the wait.  Grab a coffee and a snack and plan on lining up roughly 8/9a, rain or shine (rain doesn't make the line go down, fyi). And in case you're wondering, no, you cannot hold the place for someone.  Your entire party must be there (or you can order and just take it to them.  They just can't show up to meet you in line right before Franklin's opens while everyone else has been waiting).  \\n\\nIf you're visiting and don't have half a day to spend on waiting in a Disneyland sized line for BBQ, there's lots of other good options to still get that authentic Austin BBQ that are great without the line.  That being said, Franklin's is probably the best, but only by a point or two, and that point could have been earned because by the time you eat it you're just so thankful for the wait to be over and so starving the food tastes EXTRA good.  :P"},{"name":"Foster Burger","address":"5339 Se Foster Rd","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"We went through a phase of loving this place, the burgers are generally very good and the black and white fries are great!

From the outside, it's still the same great big old white building, situated across from Radke's (another long-time resident in the hood, dating back at least to the mid 70s) on one side, and 7-11 on the other . The name originates from the rather peculiar and at times, dangerous intersection the tavern/inn sits on--- N. Fessenden, Columbia way, and two smaller inlets. Many, many bad car wrecks at this complex intersection over the years. Heck, I can remember many, many moons ago, when the tavern got free A/C, courtesy of Portland's Finest, a squad car that lost control and slammed clean through the wall and parked at a stool right @ the counter inside... no word on what the nice officer was ordering...  ;p\\n\\n(Strangely enough, a cop car slammed into another familiar N. Portland haunt just last week @ The Decoy in Linnton--fortunately nobody apparently was hurt. Haven't these po-pos heard of drive-thru? Haw haw...)\\n\\n\\nBut it's not just the traffic that makes the Six Point personally significant. As a kid in the early 80s, I had an afternoon paper route (Portland Journal, anyone? They offered a pm delivery (except on Saturdays) vs. Oregonians' am... guess we see which one won THAT battle, ey?). The Six Point Tavern was on my route. The lady @ the bar would let me come in, drink a Root Beer and sit at the counter and cool off (it was near the end of my route). She was one of a VERY few customers who tipped me ANYTHING on the holidays. One year she even got me a Valentine's gift (*awwww*). Remember, we had double digit inflation, dbl. digit unemployment AND dbl. digit interest rates in those days. The economy absolutely stunk, and most everybody was hurting. Almost nobody--- and certainly not in that neck a' the woods--- had much discretionary income to spend on the paper boy...\\n\\n\\nThese days, you can expect a friendly,  \\nblue-collar, no-frills, low-key, just folks-kind of ambiance; it's quite clean and has a lovely outdoor seating patio. Comfy couches surround the perimeter of the bar area, and there are several of the obligatory large screen tvs. You could do a whole lot worse, in choosing a place to hang yer hat, if you wanted to meet your buddies and catch a ball game or two....\\n\\n\\nOwnership has changed hands at least once since my paperboy days, even so I wish the folks @ Six Point ongoing and sustained success...."},{"name":"Tia's Waterfront","address":"200 Atlantic Ave, Fl 1","city":"Boston","stars":"2.5","text":"this place had a nice location, on the waterfront overlooking the bay. when i went there i got a view of the street. i got seated where those tour buses were parking. ugh! \\n\\nmy friend and i ate there for lunch which was terribly expensive. expensive because we only had 4 items. we had 3 bloody Mary's and boneless buffalo wings (which was really good), but not worth $50 total. \\n\\nalthough the service was really nice. our server was very pleasant even though you could tell she didn't want to be there, but she was a good sport and kept her game face on. :) *clap clap*"},{"name":"Wink & Nod","address":"3 Appleton St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Very disappointing.

I like the flavor of the end pieces and the fattiness of the middle pieces so try both the lean and not so lean areas to get a well rounded experience.  The ribs are great.  The pork is awesome.  Their sausage is amazing.  Turkey is not too dry.  These guys make meat taste so good.  But whatever you do--don't forget the pie.  The banana bourbon pie is delicious and amazing.

(although I was starving...) The only annoying thing was that there wasn't really anywhere to stand at the front host stand so we were sort of in the doorway. If it hadn't been raining, we probably could have hung out outside, which would've been fine on a nice night. We were seated in just a few minutes; surprising to me considering it was during Midtown Restaurant Week. \\n\\nWe sat upstairs and were greeted quickly by a friendly waiter who I thought provided attentive service. We all chose from the Restaurant Week menu which didn't have any of my usual (read: plain) go-to items like chicken and pasta or a grilled chicken salad, but they did have honey glazed fried chicken, so I thought I would branch out. \\n\\nIn order, I got a Drunken Palmer cocktail, the corn bisque, fried chicken, and chocolate bread pudding.\\n\\nMy drink was delicious, very sweet and in a tall glass, definitely a good way to shake off the stress of a day. It had a little more of a tea taste than I like but the lemonade helped to temper that. I'm not really a huge corn fan since it gets stuck in my teeth so I liked that the soup was pureed and the flavor of corn was mixed with creme fraiche for a mild sweet soup. I had a bite of the other appetizer option, the pork crepe, and it was fantastic too. There were two main course options, the fried chicken and pasta with mussels/some other seafood. The fried chicken was delicious except that it was slightly crispy. It had great flavor though and there were two decent-sized pieces. Perfect amount for a main course to avoid having to take some home. (I'm not much for leftovers.) The bread pudding was made perfectly, spongy and not too sweet but was just too chocolatey for me. There was only one dessert option though, so it was that or nothing. \\n\\nAll in all, SCK was great and I'd definitely go back, except next time I'd get a few different dishes to see how they handle some other southern staples."},{"name":"Christopher's","address":"1920 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"If you want a reliable cornucopia of drinks to choose from, like a whole lot of beer, a wonderfully consistent sangria, and exciting hard liquor, then Christopher's is for you.

Once you get into other things, it is sort of hit or miss, which is a shame, because I wanted so badly to like their seafood risotto.

The faucet in our room was leaky, and the toilet ran a long time after flushing.  Nothing serious (they worked), but just a bit on the shabby side.  Also, as one other reviewer said, the bed didn't face the TV, so you had to lay on your side to see the TV (kinda weird).\\n\\nOn the plus side, the staff was very friendly, and when a couple of missteps happened, they were quick to accommodate.  The buffet breakfast couldn't be beat since the child price (for my 11 year old) was only $5.00.  The hotel was just a couple of blocks from the convention center and a short walk to Lloyd Center and shopping.\\n\\nThat said, the actual stay in the room left me wanting a bit.

Well, if your doc says you need to consult his/her opinion before embarking on an exercise regimen, make sure to heed the advice!\\n\\nSo, my sense of direction is horrible and only in the past month or two did I realize that the park I went to for my first Dunwoody Food Truck Thursday (last year, I think, for a fun UYE) was the same park I was walking to.

So when this dawned on me, I immediately researched to see if the food truck thing was still happening this year and lo and behold, it totally is going down even now, on Thursdays (so not now on Friday but now in general).\\n\\nAT and I arrived at 7 p.m. and found the place full of people of all ages and personal statuses (as in some were with friends, some with sig. others, and some with pets and/or kids in tow). This place is awesome to just have a fun, tame night out. There's music playing and people chatting with tons of food in their arms or while waiting in line. I found the wait for my food truck (WOW! Food Truck) to be semi-lengthy, but not unbearable.

Looking through past events, it looks like there is nice variety, with different food trucks showing up different weeks. You will probably always find King of Pops there, which is a great thing. You'd think after so many years and so many pops, I'd get sick of them but I love how they switch up the flavors, thereby reinventing themselves for their customers. \\n\\nAwesome food truck night in a nice park with a trail that you should hit before you grub, to preemptively burn calories.

I've been a die hard since the trailer days and have been so in love with the brisket that I've stood in line for countless hours to get my fix. \\n\\nSo, why only 3 stars? Well, it's the line. And not the length of the line ... that's fine and I've learned to live with it. It's a part of the experience and kind of enjoyable (though less so in July). \\n\\nMy problem is with  the way the line is maintained/managed (i.e., it's not). What happens these days is that you might line up at the end of a reasonably long line at, say, 10:20. Then, over the next 30+ minutes you will see 50-60 descend on the place and ... what the hell ... you're STILL at the end of the line! That's because half the people in line are holding spots for their friends and now you're 50 people back from where you started. It's ridiculous.\\n\\nWhile holding a spot for a loved one might be acceptable on occasion, it seems to be the rule at Franklin nowadays. I actually had folks in front of me this weekend who called their friends to let them know that they were near the door and then had 6 more people get in front of me before I got in the building. And, of course, the pulled pork I got on the list for early on was long sold out by the time I got to the counter. \\n\\nIt should also be noted that it's this same class of people who will dispatch several members of their party to grab tables before they even make it to the counter, which means folks who just ordered their food can't find a place to sit since tables are being \\"held.\\" It's uncivilized. \\n\\nI've been a Franklin evangelist since soon after they opened, and I've taken every visiting friend and family member there as well. Honestly though, I might have to take a break from their heavenly brisket until they find a way to police up the line situation so that people who get up early and make their way to the restaurant aren't penalized when mobs of folks who wanted an extra hour or two of sleep finally show up."},{"name":"Saffron","address":"3616 Far W Blvd, Ste 113","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"We just had a great meal.

My father and I arrived at 8:40AM, 20 minutes before they opened and we were about #15 in line, of about 45 (and it was pouring down rain).  As we were eagerly awaiting the front doors to open, I realized that this place must be good as the line continued to grow and the rain continued to fall.\\n\\nOnce we were inside, we were promptly seated and served coffee and water.  With so many wonderfully tasting options, my dad and I did more of a family style when we ordered, so we could try more than one item.  I ordered the fried chicken and sweet potato waffle and he ordered the 'big breakfast' with 2 over easy eggs, potatoes, apple pork sausage, and substituted the toast for a biscuit.  We also ordered a side of the praline bacon.  \\n\\nFirst, I tend to lean towards sausage over bacon, and wow, the praline bacon was some of the best bacon I have ever eaten in my life.  The combination of sweet and salty is perfect.  The bacon is also a bit thicker cut than normal and moist.  \\n\\nSecondly, you must try the fried chicken, amazing!  Very crisp and flavorful on the outside and moist and chewy in the inside.  Add a piece of the sweet potato waffle and fresh maple syrup and you realize why you waited in the rain for breakfast.  \\n\\nThirdly, for your typical, eggs, some sort of meat, potatoes, and toast, the 'big breakfast' definitely will exceed your expectations.  The apple sausage links (2) were quite flavorful, the red potatoes were seasoned perfectly, and the eggs were just like my dad likes them.  I would say the only downfall of our entire meal was the biscuit.  It was a tad fluffy, cake-like for my liking.  It was like a biscuit angel food cake in the way it was prepared as far as looks and how it tasted (yet obviously not sweet like angel food cake).  I like my biscuit more flaky and creamy.\\n\\nOur service was fabulous, as our water and coffee glasses were never empty.  The coffee beans are from Stumptown and did not disappoint.  \\n\\nIf you wake up on a Saturday or Sunday morning wanting a delicious breakfast that you will continue to talk about the entire day and keep you full for a while (as the portions are quite large, you will most likely have left overs) try Screen Door, it won't disappoint."},{"name":"Papa G's Vegan Organics","address":"2314 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"My favorite vegan tempeh Reuben would have to be from Papa G's!

To start, they serve you a papadum basket with three different dipping choices, all were really tasty. I especially liked the chutney. We ordered vegetable samosas to start. Then we ordered a lamb curry, lamb biryani and a garlic nan. The lamb curry was served with a wonderful rice, the biryani served with a raita (a yogurt dipping sauce). The garlic nan was a tasty, wonderful bread that I could have eaten endlessly. Everything was great. They offer light, medium or heavy(?), variations of seasoning. I think that's a great idea, in the future I would order my food to be seasoned lightly. This time I went with medium and it was a bit strong for me. But that's my preference and at least they offer you choices on that. I will definitely return to this establishment and highly recommend it. The only reason I did not give it a five star rating is very minor, but they did not offer me a clean dish between courses and then they (mistakenly) took my silverware.

Located in another restaurant and only serves breakfast til 11. Located in a very artsy neighborhood with lots of beautiful murals. Lots of Mexican art and ambiance all around in this restaurant. Very Latin Inspired. We were seated pretty quickly and our server came over to introduce herself. I cant remember her name but we asked for a Cubano, a coffee and some water which came out quick. That's about it as far as quickness. She took some time to get back to us for our order. We ordered 2 of the Adios breakfast advertised with an avocado...(keep this avocado part in your mind) along with an order of their Blue Corn Hotcakes........I ordered mine with eggs whites vs. the sunny side up egg it came with,\\n\\nOur food didn't show up until about 40 mins later and we were getting ready to leave. In that 40 mins another couple was seated next to us and she took a very long time to even come by and even get their drink orders.

When our food FINALLY arrived.......It was brought by another waitress who just slammed it down. Didn't clarify which dish belong to who or who the hot cakes belong to. Our food was cool. My hotcakes were cool cakes and was supposed to be served with a special syrup and it wasn't. The butter melted and then solidified (This butter was a passion fruit butter which tasted phenomenal). The avocado advertised with this breakfast was a sliver of an avocado. At this point we were starving and ate it anyway. The flavors were spot on and their chorizo was very tasty. We only wish we had the opportunity to eat hot food vs. cooled food. You can tell it sat, I tasted that in my eggs. Our server took another 15 mins to come ask us if we were ok and did so rudely while disrupting the couple next to us whose order she was taking. I told her I'd wait for her to finish taking their order. I asked for the syrup these hotcakes came when and she just gave me regular syrup.

First I will say that the food is good. Where things fall apart is with the staff and the place itself. Let's begin with the hostess situation. We arrived early for a 7pm reservation with the intent of having a drink at the bar. The hostess outside was very nice, checked us in and said to feel free to wait at the bar. \\n\\nFrom there we head to the bar which  in general was fine but I'm expecting a southern style restaurant based on the menu however, the bar area has more of a nightclub feel. The neon lights and uniformed bartenders and servers made it all feel very strange. There also isn't a bourbon list. I'd expect a place with \\"bourbon\\" in the name to tout a decent selection of bourbons. Instead there's a standard list of craft cocktails several of which are rum-based and come in Hawaiian/tiki like glassware. We also ordered the same drink twice at the bar and each time the drink tasted completely different so there's a consistency issue on that front.\\n\\nNow here's where things start to fall apart. We expected that someone would come to get us closer to our reservation time to let us know the table was ready. That didn't happen so about 10 minutes after our reservation I walked up to the hostess stand inside and asked about our table. The hostess abruptly asked if I had paid my bar tab and if not, to take care of that first. I smiled and said, \\"of course, as soon as we square away there would you like me to come back here?\\" She confirmed. So following instructions we paid up and made our way back to the hostess stand where we were met by a different hostess who asked us to wait while she proceeded to fold menus while we stood there. After a few minutes of intense focus on her part to fold menus she then escorted us to our table. \\n\\nOur waiter was fine but a little too casual. He touted the beignets from the start after orienting us with the menu and specials. We indicated we would be having those later however, at the end of our meal after clearing our plates he just brought the bill. No mention of having dessert or could he get us anything else. So we took the hint, paid and left. \\n\\nI don't think we'll be coming back which is unfortunate as the food is quite nice.

I was a big fan of the cocktail bar scene in NYC before I moved here so I can't help but compare but maybe thats unfair.

We received biscuits and cornbread with butter and apple butter. My husband does not typically like anything remotely gelatinous, but he really loved the apple butter!

The flavor was excellent and the waffles were the prefect compliment. Chicken is honestly not my favorite, but I can eat theirs daily. Nice crunch, not too much batter, just perfect. I appreciate it being served with real maple syrup, as anything sweeter would not have worked. So good! \\n\\nMy first bite of the lump crab cake hash was literally a dance in my mouth. So much going on and it was amazing! Not too much potato (like some hashes I've had) and so much crab meat, I wondered how it all stayed together. Yummm...\\n\\nThe atmosphere was right up my alley. Casual, people relaxing and chatting and enjoying themselves. The staff was busy. Bobby was great. We don't usually like servers who hover, and I guess he was too busy to do that.

We care, why? Were there to eat, maybe the people didn't have $ to leave a tip. Rude of him to judge. I guess he was hinting me & my friend to leave him a tip. Anyway, he kept talking bad about customers with the other waiter. Whatever, I'm there to eat. My food comes I eat the waffle, its yummy, I start eating my egg and boom; there is a white hair in it. My friend and I have black hair, cook has white hair. I call the waiter and he apologized about the hair. I was disgusted, wanted to throw up. I was not going to pay for food I didn't eat or enjoy. The waiter yelled and argued with me for over 15 minutes that I should pay for the food since I had eaten some already. Are u f**** kidding me! After arguing forever with him since there is no manager at that time. I paid for my friends food and my drink. On my way home we started talking about how hair has oil and dandruff and me and my friend threw up. I felt like I shouldnt have paid for anything. \\n\\nI called manager Mikey who I explained everything to. She said she would watch the restaurant video to make sure I didn't put the hair in the food. She watched it, saw how rude the waiter was, saw the hair and all she said was since my friend ate her food and there was no hair in hers, she wouldn't refund that. But she would refund $2 for my drink. She wanted me to waste $6 gas to pick up $2. Lol.  Anyway, I felt like I shouldn't have paid for food my friend and I didn't enjoy so I call corporate.\\n\\nCorporate is a joke. Its a customer service line where you leave a complaint and they will get back at you. Its been over a week, still no response. I want compensation /my $13 back, I still have receipt.  I also want a copy of the video. I want one of the news channels to play it.

The salad was light and refreshing and had little currants in it which offered bursts of flavor. \\n\\nThe waitress then brought over one of the best bread baskets ever. It had 3 types of bread and all were warm from the oven and bursting with flavor. My favorite was the duck fat corn muffin. \\n\\nFor entrees my wife and I couldn't resist ordering the same thing-- the garlic stuffed sirloin with asparagus on a bed of crispy potato, pepper and onion hash-- all with a Rich sauce that I think was a port wine sauce.

The pancakes were crispy, the chicken gizzards tasty and appropriately chewy, the budae jjigae authentic, and the spicy pork (perhaps a little too) spicy. \\n\\nService wasn't the best, but staff were easy to find because the restaurant is so open. At this type of place it seems fine to wave around a bit to get a server's attention. \\n\\nMaybe Sojuba is legit or maybe it was the soju, but I had a good time.

This would've been overlooked had we not faced problems for the rest of dinner.\\n\\nWe had to remind our server on a couple of occasions of items we never received, which she responded by slamming the second plate and spilling the items around the table. At that point it was as awkward as a Trump-Clinton Thanksgiving dinner, so I asked the manager for a change in service.\\n\\nIn the end, they comped us a few items and the food was terrific.

That being said I would agree with the other Yelper's that the average age of the diners here exceed 70 years old.  We found ourselves dining here way too early on a Sunday.  12:00 noon to be exact.  Long story short  we were looking for a late breakfast or brunch. Turns out they stop serving breakfast at 11:00 & they don't offer a brunch.  Dining here any time before 7:00 pm is like dining in a hall at a retirement castle.  There were people in wheel chairs & some on oxygen.  But these people know how to eat.  The food here has always been and continues to be very good.  The selection and the portions are large and the prices are very reasonable.  You can eat in the formal dining room, the \\"Linden\\" tavern or if you could actually find a bar stool without a regular sitting on it you could hit the bar.    You'll wait for a table at dinner time & the parking lot is set up rather oddly.  If your over 6 feet tall don't stand up to fast or you might hit your head on the ceiling.

We were promptly seated at a table in the middle of the dining room. The restaurant was loud and crowded. \\n\\nWhen we sat down, the host gave us a menu with appetizers and entrees, a sheet of drink specials and a sheet of food specials. When the waitress came to take our drink order, she realized we didn't have a cocktail menu and got one for us. After that, my friend asked about the sides she had seen online. The waitress then went to get her a different menu with the sides listed on it. Then someone asked if it was possible to order tapas (served at the bar). The waitress said that you could order the tapas as an appetizer, and that there was a separate tapas menu (which we never got). So basically, we each had a menu, then we had a paper with drink specials, a paper with food specials, a cocktail menu, a menu with sides listed, and a MIA tapas menu. It was overwhelming and they should consolidate it all into one menu. In addition, there was only one vegetarian entree on the menu- a stuffed chile with pepper sauce. Our waitress was nice but seemed scattered.\\n\\nWe got bread after sitting down for awhile, and it was the highlight of the meal. The bread basket came with cornbread and regular bread, and was served with 3 spreads- some sort of flavored butter, a hummus and something else. They were all amazing, and I liked the dairy-free option of the hummus. We blew through the basket quickly, and the waitress took the basket without asking if we wanted more (we did). Eventually, we figured out what we wanted to eat and placed our order. I ordered an appetizer with shrimp, chorizo and fried plaintains, and 2 sides- the onion rings and the truffle yucca fries. We also ordered a huge margarita bowl. The waitress forgot to put in my order for fries. When I asked her about it, she ran back into the kitchen. A few minutes later, the wrong fries arrived. 10 minutes later, the right fries arrived- 5 of them (they were semi-big), and they were undercooked. However, the onion rings and my appetizer were amazing. Overall, everybody generally seemed to like their food and the dinner was reasonably priced. I wasn't blown away, but I'd come back if I was craving some chorizo, fried plaintains, or a massive margarita.\\n\\nSummary: \\nPros: big margarita bowls, good food, delicious bread, moderately priced\\nCons: spotty service, slow dinner, loud restaurant, minimal vegetarian options"},{"name":"Foster Burger","address":"5339 Se Foster Rd","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Great staff!!

I have been to many of the greats in Lockhart and Dallas Texas including Blacks, Smitty's, Kreuz, Pecan Lodge and Lockhart Barbeque in South Dallas.  I really wanted this place to be amazing like everyone says, but it really was just OK.  I guess I am spoiled after eating at what I consider to be the best in order of pure meat flavor, Lockhart in Dallas, Smittys in Lockhart, and Pecan Lodge in Dallas.\\n\\nI usually get the brisket and ribs but they were out of ribs.  We had fatty brisket and pulled pork.  I didn't get any sides because from what I could see on everyone's plates, they were just the standard potato salad, coleslaw, and pinto beans.  I am not a huge fan of any of those sides, unless they have a twist on them.\\n\\nThe brisket was cooked perfectly as far as it being moist and tender with a nice bark, but it just didn't have any flavor.  No smokey flavor and very little seasoning in the bark.  I am used to the great places having an incredible smokey flavor and when you bite into the meat, you know that it is something special.  This just tasted like a fatty prime rib.  \\n\\nThe pulled pork did have a nice flavor.  I can't say how good it compared to other places because I don't usually get that, but it was definitely nothing life changing, as some people claim.  \\n\\nI decided after eating about half of the meat by itself, like I normally do, to make a sandwich with the remaining pork and brisket and use their vinegar based sauce.  Again, it was good, no complaints, just nothing that would make me a raving fan.  \\n\\nI definitely would never wait in line for this.  We were lucky today and only had a 45 minute wait, but I wouldn't even wait that long for it.  I think the whole lining up for 2 hours for this is just a novelty thing because it is popular, and a social experience, unless most of these people just don't have a better option or have never tried some of the really great places.  I guess we could have just been served a bad brisket, but I would think it would have still had the smokey flavor.  \\n\\nThe service was excellent, the beer on tap was good.  They have complimentary folding camp-style chairs that you can use if the line is too long.  The sandwiches looked good and I am sure they are, just no way I would ever say it was worth the wait.  I have waiting in line for Pecan Lodge in Dallas, and when you bite into that food, you immediately want to post it on Facebook and tell your friends, because it is so amazing.

Nothing against Moojo's, but they aren't blow-your-mind away, I-need-to-fulfill-a-Moojo's-craving amazing. The cookies are kind of small and eh, and the ice cream lacks specialty in texture and flavor. Don't get me wrong--I like Moojo's! It's just one of those places where I was expecting something friggin' fantastic and got something relatively mediocre. But what can I expect? It is literally a scoop of ice cream between two cookies. \\n\\nMaybe Moojo's just needs something that makes Moojo's... Moojo's. You know, instead of just another cookie ice cream sandwich shop.

It didnt help that we were a group of 15 so I was thinking maybe 2-3 hours waiting and total time to finish. Im am please to say that wasn't the case at all! \\n\\nHalf of us showed up about 630pm and the hostness said there was no wait for a 15 top. So we went in and got seated while the others from our party trickled in to the table no problem.  As soon as we sat we were greeted by our lovely and cheerful server, Kayla. Even as big as our group was she was extremely happy and attentive throughout the whole dinner. She was very organized and kept checking in on us every so often. Being a group of 15, our food actually came out fairly quickly for the party size, i'd say 30-40 min or so. Food was nice and fresh. Im not going into detail on everyone's dish, but I had the buffalo burger medium rare and it was delicious :). My neighbor had some sushi dish which she said was the best sushi ever.  The checks came out promptly and overall the dinner was a success. \\n\\nAll in all it was a great experience.

Might as well.\\" \\n\\nMy conclusion- I think it depends on the flavors you get. I keep seeing these reviews about the red velvet being good... really? The multiple times I have tried it, it is overly dense and tastes like cornbread, lol! The cake was on the dry side, the frosting way too sweet (you can get better at HEB), and there was this weird cornmeal aftertaste, I kid you not! Next time you try it, think of cornbread... you'll see what I mean!!\\n\\nBeing said... at the Bun Run I decided to give the Vanilla Dream a chance. I will say, that one was very moist, and the frosting was just the right amount of sweetness! I was a bit thrown off by the pink frosting, but it is kind of cute in a way :-).

Went here today with two out-of-towners who have been meaning to try this place for a few years  now. \\n\\nSo understand that this is a PROCESS, like getting in line for the summer rollercoaster at Six Flags. Yes, the wait is like 1.5 hours for 30 seconds of awesome. Don't dock this place a star because you had to wait in line. You should already know this. It's part of the experience! You talk to people in line, share snacks, stories, make friends. \\n\\nArrived on site at 10am to find a LONG line, we found out the first person had arrived there at 7:45AM!!! Wow.  We got our food and ate at 1:30pm. There were some guys behind us who brought their WiFi hotspot and laptops and sat down and were working. Good planning! \\n\\nBrisket and ribs were hands down probably the best I've ever had! Sausage was good, but WAY too greasy for me. I know, I know, it's sausage, and should be fatty, but wow... too much for me. Turkey was also very good. \\n\\nTips:\\n-be prepared for the wait! \\n-bring water, snacks, something to sit on, hat, sunscreen\\n-There is a CVS literally RIGHT by Franklins. Make a stop there to get water etc.\\n\\nSo the big question... would I go back? On my own, no way. I can find tons of stuff to do with 4 hours on a Friday morning (or any morning). If I have people who want to go, and I had the time, I could be convinced. It is definitely an experience. But to gain about 15% better BBQ than the competition, (bad ROI for me), the time investment isn't worth it to me. I could go to a dozen other spots, still get very decent BBQ and be in and out within 30 min. \\n\\nThe Takeaway: Go for the experience, and you'll be rewarded with AMAZING food. Don't go because you are hungry (though you will be by the time you get to the front). And especially don't go if you don't want to wait.\\n\\nOh also, did I mention that it's now 7pm, and I am just waking up from my food coma... so yeah.

The restaurant was nearly empty with only a handful of tables occupied. My copilot had never been to a Brazilian Steakhouse and I feared that this experience would be his last. The hostess wanted quite a bit of information from me before we were seated (marketing research I'm sure). The decor felt more like Miami Vice meets a strip club with loud music to boot. The waitress pointed to the buffet and said we could start anytime and that the servers with meat would stop by. The buffet looked like a cross between Golden Coral and an all you can eat Chinese restaurant. By this time my copilot was getting that uneasy look on his face and we decided to leave.

My 2 cents of course.\\n\\nAs far as sides go we split greens and potato salad .

I had a plane to catch and was really worried that I'd miss my flight but I was willing to risk it for the food (well, not really). On a Friday night, the place was packed so my wait was 30 minutes and it took another 30 for my food to come out (after I sat down).  Because I rushed myself, I feel like I didn't get to enjoy the food as much I was could have.\\n\\nI was worried that it would be really weird eating there considering that I was the only person there by himself on a Friday night. But the people minded their own business and the waiter was really friendly.  So maybe in the future I should stop staring at people when they eat by themselves. We'll see. They sat me at a table (for two) instead of the bar and I was really pleased that I wasn't rushed at all.  The service was great--the waiter gave me refills for both my water and iced tea whenever I ran low and he also checked up on me just the right number of times.\\n\\nI ordered the crispy-fried buttermilk-battered fried chicken and mac & cheese.  The mac & cheese was served in a medium-sized bowl and it was clear from the hardened top layer that it was baked. While it was good, there was nothing unusually special about it.\\n\\nThe fried chicken dinner came with mashed potatoes and gravy and some green stuff (I'm sorry, I'm not a vegetable man).  I've never eaten fried chicken with a fork and knife before. I picked one of these bad boys up and realized after my first two bites that there was no bone in the chicken. I thought, \\"is this my order?\\" It took me a bit to realize that there was a reason why I was given a knife (I'm slow, I know).  But no matter which way I ate it, the fried chicken was a perfect combination of juiciness and crunchiness. I should probably also mention that I ended up dipping every bite-sized piece of fried chicken into the mashed potatoes. That's just the kind of person I am.\\n\\nI microwaved my leftovers two days later and I was so surprised that the fried chicken wasn't soggy or greasy at all (and in fact tasted really similar to what I had on Friday) that I decided to write a review about my experience."},{"name":"Border Caf√©","address":"32 Church St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Great food, drinks, and atmosphere.

They arrived before I did and grabbed a table -- actually, half of one because most of the tables are community tables. Initially, I was less-than-impressed upon entrance because we found that tables could not be moved or provided with additional chairs, so that reduced our overall space for people that would be joining us throughout the evening. Luckily, the group sharing the table with us were very accommodating and we were all able to scoot in.\\n\\nNow, seating is a big deal to me because I think it is of utmost importance that customers be comfortable while drinking and dining, but we were able to work that out so I am not going to roll this issue into my review. However, it is worth considering as a potential patron.\\n\\nIn addition to comfort, great service is paramount to a good dining experience. That is particularly why I was very offended to find that some of the servers were less than eager to seat us or attend to our questions. However, our server was attentive and informative. When we notified the manager of the behavior of some of the other servers, he responded and corrected the issue immediately.\\n\\nSo, after all that, I was thinking about how terrible my review was going to be of Porter Ale House. I mean, sketch seating and bad service all in one? That's a great way to get one star and a nasty Yelp review. That is particularly why you should pay attention to the fact that I am giving Porter Ale House five stars -- because the food and food service knocked it out of the park.\\n\\nBetween the eight of us, we ordered pretty much one of everything on the menu. Here are some highlights:\\n\\nWe started with sweet and salty beer nuts, black muscles, cheese fondu, fried calamari and charcuterie. All of these were a delight, but the black muscles and cheese fondu were a really big hit. The lemon sauce in the muscles was absolutely to die for -- so rich, zesty, and flavorful. We loved it so much, we asked for extra bread so we could sop up every last drop. The cheese fondu was made with a dark ale and that lended a beautiful richness and complexity to the sauce. The cheese sauce is paired with green apples and the acidity from the fresh fruit really made the sauce. I couldn't get enough!\\n\\nWhen we moved on to our entrees, we decided to order a few different things and share. We got the kale salad, roasted beet salad, an order of the fish 'n chips, oxtail croquettes, and a double order of the evening's chef special: roast sweet potato soup with braised pork belly. Again, everything was amazing, but when the chef brought out his soup to us, I was immediately struck by the intoxicating aroma of the sweet potato puree. I looked at the chef and told him that the soup smelled like a hug. He put down the  food on our table and hugged me! It was such a sweet gesture, and I think it expresses the love that our chef put in that soup. If the warmth of your mother's tender embrace could be combined with the sensation of sitting beside a roaring fire on a snowy day, that would be the flavor of this soup -- it was the best soup I have ever eaten. It was complete paradise to eat this soup, and I can't wait to have it again.\\n\\nWe finished our meal by splitting a heavenly, dark chocolate mousse and an order of house-made donuts. The donuts came with a salted caramel sauce that I could eat all day, every day. A sweet finish to a very sweet meal.\\n\\nAnd so, in conclusion, I have to say that Porter Ale House may have had a late start out of the gate, but they picked it up and ran all the way to the finish line. Everyone deserves a second chance, but Porter Ale House took that opportunity and made it a huge success."},{"name":"South Pacific Rum Bar and Grill","address":"1109 Washington St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Awesome food and service.

After having to wait an hour and  half the last time I was here, this time I came earlier, a little after 6pm on a Saturday. There was still a line, but it was short, and I only had to wait 10-15 minutes to get a table, by the time I left the line hadn't gotten a little longer, but it didn't seem like those people were gonna have to wait too long, so I guess some nights are different? I don't know.\\n\\nthis time I tried #5, the tsukemen, it's a little messier to eat, unless you did what I did which was dump the noodles and everything else into the smaller bowl of dipping broth. While the broth was rich, flavorful, and tasty, it was a touch on the sweet side? It could have been a little less-sweet for me, but I have a low tolerance for really sweet things, so it may not bother others. I really liked the different kind of noodles they use for the dipping ramen, they are much thicker and chewier than the noodles in the other ramen bowls. I also got a salad to start, which was nice and refreshing. Every time I have been here I have gotten the gyoza and spicy edename. They are so good.\\n\\nI don't think the hype on this place will ever die down, the ramen is really darn good, so I'd say it's worth the wait, but if the thought of waiting in line for more then 30 minutes boggles your mind, I would suggest coming here during the week. They are now open on Sundays though! not sure if Sunday nights are less crazy than Saturday nights. Also, on Sundays and Sundays only, they serve their veggie ramen. I'm not sure if it's also vegan, I didn't pay too close attention to it's description on the menu."},{"name":"Bandini Pizza & Pasta","address":"3107 N Lombard St","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"Bandini's is by far the worst pizza we have had in Portland.

As for attire, I decided on a cropped sweater, a skater skirt, and chunky heels. I'm not sure I felt totally comfortable. There were a lot of men dressed in suits and women with Chanel purses and pointy toed Valentino heels as sharp as their hearts. I could snap these Hampton hoes in half with my cankles. Anyway, after we got situated in our booth sans sea shells and citronella candles, we ordered away. \\n\\nWe started off with a margherita pizza, bruschetta, and crostini di sofia. The pizza was good, but nothing compared to my Chitown deep dish. The bruschetta and crostini were both good, but not anything salivate-worthy. \\n\\nThe bread was like eating spongy cardboard, but I was starving. I soaked it in olive oil and downed it just like the professionals at hot dog eating contests. Didn't matter what it was, just had to be in my stomach.  \\n\\nMy friend told me to get the chicken breast paillad, which apparently is chicken pounded completely flat. The menu didn't tell me this! My friend Julie didn't tell me this! With each bite all I could think about is that poor chicken that had to be flattened and pounded to death. What the hell happened to animal rights! Anyway, it was good chicken, not great. It had some nice arugula and tomatoes on top. My friends had the Penne alla Vodka, which was bomb.com. Ate so much I almost had to vom.com.  \\n\\nOne thing that was a nono was when a server came over and asked if we were done. Bitch, do you see the five noodles of penne alla vodka sauce ft. extra vodka still on my plate?

We asked his opinion about order the fried chicken vs soft-shelled crab. \\"Get the crab,\\" he said, \\"the season is almost over, and we'll have chicken all year.\\" Good call--the crab, crisply fried, was served with a delicious, addictive smoky-vinegary sauce.  We also had buttery sauteed wild mushrooms on a deep green, earthy spinach puree, and for dessert the grilled pound cake.

We made friends with our line neighbors and even played Catch Phrase with them. As we started getting closer to the entrance, they handed out sausage wraps which was nice to get to try that. We didn't get our food till about 12:30pm which I know seems like a long wait but it really didn't feel that long since we had activities to pass the time. The brisket was to die for and the pulled pork was also amazing. I only wish I had tried the ribs because I heard such good things about them. The best of their three BBQ sauces is the vinegar based one. I've never tried anything like it. The only things I wasn't over the moon about were their sides. The potato salad was very mustardy and the coleslaw was just coleslaw. I prefer a little excitement to my sides. They also had baked beans but I'm not a bean person. Side note: John Mueller Meat Company has amazing sides.

They experienced some unfortunate equipment malfunctions and delayed supply deliveries.  Accordingly, the food was a little slow, but the service was super friendly, oh, and the food was delicious.  The staff were all apologetic, and humbly requested I come back after they had ironed out some kinks.\\n\\nTherefore, I decided to try it again a week later, and was thankful I did!  The service is always friendly, and the food is excellent as well (and much faster, now!).  So far I have had the d√∂ner sandwich ($7) and the d√∂ner plate ($8) but they offer much more!  They also have sausages, schnitzel, cabbage rolls, and other German delights; I am slowly eating my way across the menu, one day at a time. The prices may seem high when compared to some of the street vendors (tack on a buck or two to what you might expect from the carts), but I think the prices are fine, considering everything is made fresh: bread baked daily, fresh cut fries, they even have an awesome machine where they dump a bunch of oranges in the top and you can see a Rube Goldberg-esque device juice them before your very eyes! (and although I love other German restaurants around, this one is definitely cheaper...and closer!)  At times, with all the attention to the food and friendly service, I feel more like I am walking into a friend's kitchen instead of a restaurant; quite the German dining experience away from Deutschland!\\n\\nI recommend you check it out.

I had a flashback from the Varsity when I had my first bite only 10 times worse!!!!!  But it has a darn good taste to it. The brisket was good and moist! The breast was perfect. The smoke wings were big but just okay. I like Smokey Bones smoked wings much better. I loved the BBQ Sauce here. I was right on point. I had a little kick to it. Nice.

No salads offered with entrees (isn't that illegal for Italian restaurants) and the garlic rolls were basically frozen dinner rolls slopped with butter, and cold to boot. The gnocchi appetizer was potato gnocchi *floating in butter, smothered in cheese. Not the good kind of floating in butter and covered in cheese, but the 'just looking at this makes my stomach hurt,' kind. I ordered the Chicken Cannelloni, because I read good things about it here. It was a disgusting amount of ricotta (did I mention I love cheese?) wrapped up in overcooked noodles with a questionable amount of chicken inside (still not really sure there was any chicken in there). Then, they top the dish off with, and I really mean this, prego or ragu quality marinara and Alfredo sauce. \\n\\nAgain, I can't even express my regret in having such awful things to say about an establishment.

By the time you get to the counter (we had the inspiration to go there on a rainy day and it still took 1 hour and 45 minutes) you are in a good mood from chatting with your cohorts and so hungry that barbecued cardboard would be appealing, and Franklin's friendly attitude puts everybody over the top.\\n\\nThe line is actually not that long... it just moves VERy slowly. If he added a second counter it would move twice as fast but that simply means they would sell out in 1 hours not 2. I looked in the back yard after and he has a series of wacky trailor-mounted smokers all over the place. There looks to be room for one or two more but more important maybe it's time for a high-capacity stationary setup. Franklin's definitely should build on its current reservoir of good will... not by opening inferior franchises, but by making more of the superior product and making more more efficiently.\\n\\nA couple tips. First, don't hesitate to ask for samples when you get to the counter. Franklin will gladly cut them for you and they are BIG. Big enough to really savor the meats so even if you don't order that one you can really get an idea what it's like.\\n\\nSecond, about the Tipsy Texan. How can you go wrong with a Mrs. Baird's bun piled high with chopped beef, sauce, sliced sausage and cole slaw for $8? Well, here's how I would order if I was there again. I'd specifically ask for burnt ends which is what makes chopped beef so great. He chops the beef to order, more or less, so I bet he would do that for you. Second, ask for the sauce on the side. It's the funky espresso which is good stuff but gets in the way of the pure meatness. The slaw and sausage are minor distractions so I guess I'd leave that alone.

I was both impressed by the fact that Alden & Harlow was open and by the service and food, given that the chefs must have had a hard time sourcing ingredients, etc.\\n\\nThey have a daily menu that changes slightly, if I'm not mistaken. Things change a bit each time you stop by. I tried the Secret Burger, the kale salad, the cauliflower pierogies, some bread on the side, and the lemon blackberry poundcake for dessert.\\n\\nThe kale salad was delicious. It was topped with sweetened, deep fried kale, and featured a creamy dressing that brought out the natural texture of the kale. The salad also included pistachios, offering a rich burst of flavor and variety in texture. The cauliflower pierogies were smaller than expected and the entire dish had only 3 pierogies. However, they were flavorful and bathed in a light cr√®me fra√Æche (I believe, as it was lighter than sour cream but richer than yogurt). The burger was delicious and served with a mayo-based sauce and alongside freshly fried potato chips. There were pickles and dressed, chopped lettuce in the burger, both of which really added to the flavor of the meat. Additionally, there was a crispy piece of cheese -- I'm guessing it was shredded cheese that was carefully fried or grilled. Very, very unique and definitely brought out the flavor of the cheese as well.\\n\\nThe bread that they offered on the side was denser than the usual bread you get at restaurants, though it also featured large pores. It may have been a darker sour dough. It was a great complement to the sauce alongside the burger and the cream alongside the pierogies. Would definitely recommend asking for some bread.\\n\\nTo finish, the dessert was both flavorful and not too heavy. The pound cake had a rich, moist texture, and the blackberry preserves on top soaked the cake just enough for the flavor to come out. The cake was topped with almond cream -- whipped cream with almond extract? -- and lemon zests, which formed the perfect palate cleansing end to the meal.\\n\\nWould definitely recommend the kale salad, Secret Burger, and the poundcake.

It's best to make a reservation or get there before 7 to avoid the dinner rush. Seating is ample but the regular (not high top) tables go fast. They have outdoor seating in the warmer months. Since it is tapas-style, a small group of 2-4 people is probably best so everyone can try the dishes without having to order two of each. We usually order the Cajun guacamole (very generous with the shrimp) with housemade bbq chips (good on its own, even better together), short rib croquettes and pork belly cracklings. Skip the fried chicken. It's not crispy enough and the batter falls off the meat. Biscuits are yummy and come with a sweet spread (cinnamon butter) and a savory one (spicy cheese). Without drinks, it's usually around 30 per head, which isn't terrible for small plates in Boston as long as you order wisely. They have the bill pinned onto a little voodoo doll which is a nice touch."},{"name":"Serafina Downtown","address":"10 High St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Appetizers were tasteless and the steak was really awful.

A couple of menu special's were sold out so options can be limited at times.  I thought about getting the curry bowl but then spotted the chili with cornbread.  Luckily it was still available when I ordered.  Shortly after I ordered, the guy working behind the counter announced it was the last of it for the evening.  Eating utensils, water, and napkins are self serve.  If you forget something, the staff can provide it for you too.\\n\\nI took a bite of the chili and I was blown away how well seasoned and thick the chili was.  I only added a little bit of pepper simply because I'm a pepper nut.  The cornbread is a little dense but not dry.  It soaked up well after dipping with the chili.

Sometimes, things are better in your head than they are in reality.\\n\\nSpecifically, I remembered they had a really good burger, so that's what I ordered: grass-fed angus burger. It had gorzongola cheese, sauteed onions, roasted portobello mushrooms, on an onion roll. I asked for medium, but it came out closer to done, and thus was a bit dry. They went a little heavy on the salt too. And this is after I came into the restaurant near famished, so the taste buds would have been appeased with pretty much anything. Needless to say, I was a bit disappointed. The portion size is good though. They also give you a small batch of fries, and a small side salad. I can't help but think that they had something called a Kobe burger back in the day, but I suppose a few years is a lot of time for a menu to change. \\n\\nSadly, I didn't get to stay around for dessert or coffee, but I'll definitely hit that up next time. And I do plan on a next time, because there are promising items on the menu. The service was decent too, no complaints in that department. Our server was prompt, attentive, and had our check ready for us quickly since I let him know we had a time restraint. \\n\\nThere's an outdoor seating area for warmer (but not super hot) weather.

From the outside it looks like a smaller type building with a little outdoor seating while the inside has room for probably 30 or so people.  There isn't much to the place except for a place to order with the kitchen behind it and then the dining room.  Heck, there isn't even much room to stand inside and while I was almost inside the whole time that I was waiting to order, the later it got, the longer the line stretched out the door.  They did also have a few beers on draft and a cooler in the back with bottles as well. \\n\\nFor my entr√©e I decided to go with the Rib Sandwich while my girlfriend went with the half a rack of ribs.  We also decided to split sides of mac and cheese and collard greens.  After ordering we took our number and found a place to sit outside since it was nice out,  Within a short amount of time our food had been delivered to our table and we were eating.  I was a little confused and surprised whenever my rib sandwich came to the table as 3 ribs bone in on a couple of pieces of bread.  Since I wanted it as a sandwich, I tried to strip the first rib onto the bread only but I was not able to.  At that point I decided to eat the ribs as usual and have some of the bread afterwards.  The shame with this is that the other two ribs were fall off the bone tender and easily could have been put on the sandwich.  Even so I really enjoyed them, especially whenever I put some of the BBQ on them.  After trying some of the BBQ it was easy to see why they were selling it and people were buying bottles of it in the shop.  Heck I even poured my leftover sauce on my bread and enjoyed eating it.  The mac and cheese and collard greens were also nice sides that complimented our meals and both my girlfriend and I enjoyed them.\\n\\nThe bottom line for me is that I would love to come back here again in the future.

I ordered a Cowgirl Carmen and a Sarva's Tot-cho dog; hubs had a Chicago dog and.. some other dog, I didn't try it.  We shared an order of onion rings, which were good enough but underseasoned.  My hot dogs barely had any flavor, and what flavor they did have was flat; the Tot-cho comes with jalapenos, tater tots, onions, and cheese sauce, but the only thing I could taste were the jalapenos. The Cowgirl Carmen is topped with a coney sauce, which had a funky flavor to me, like it was an off-brand that comes in a can.   Even my drink was weak on flavor--I had the cheap drink special, which was orange soda and whiskey. It didn't really taste much like orange soda OR whiskey.\\n\\nAnd I totally don't have a cold, heh.

So suck it NO MAS. Here it is... AGAIN!!!\\n\\nSo... you know it's bad when you are writing your Yelp review on the way home. First off, I LOVE Mexican food. I grew up on local flare in San Diego eating taquitos at little food stands, and fresh fish tacos in San Filipe. So if you think microwaved food is worth paying for at a restaurant, then disregard my review.\\n\\nI will rate everything I had on a 5 star scale.\\n\\nChips: The chips are store bought and cold, no chip warmer here. They are thin and broke in the \\"queso\\" which we will talk later. They did have a bit of salt on them. They say they are made fresh there, but there was no trace of oil on them, which is a tell tale sign.\\n1 Star\\n\\nSalsa: Wasn't bad. Not great. Not fresh. But flavorful. I like mine a bit more spicy. \\n3 Stars\\n\\nQueso Dip: It was some sort of gelatinous cheese like food. My guess is it was a form of Velveta. \\n0 Stars.\\n\\nEntree...\\n\\nI always get the same thing when I first go to a Mexican spot. It's an easy way to tell if they are legit or not. I always get a combo plate with a Chicken Taco and a Cheese Enchilada with beans and rice (sounds boring but if done right...) this time I paid 1 dollar extra for the Fresh Tempura Battered Fish taco (you get to choose 3 items here). \\n\\nTortillas: Flour (any real Mexican spot does different types of tacos and asks/assumes Corn Tortillas on tacos, but no option here). Not fresh, but they didn't break. \\n2 Stars.\\n\\nRice: This is Uncle Ben's boil in a bag. This is processed crap with that fake texture of rubbery rice and orange dye number 3. One sad little pea sits in the shit looking at you, laughing. \\n0 Stars.\\n\\nBeans: Canned with absolutely no flavor. \\n0 Stars.\\n\\nChicken Taco: I could eat it (I shouldn't have. Ask my stomach and my fianc√©). WAY too much cheese like food on it. Soggy and poorly executed. The chicken was stewed, meaning it hasn't been fresh for maybe days or maybe weeks. \\n1 Star.\\n\\nCheese Enchilada: Cold and bland canned sauce. The cheese was the \\"queso\\" crap from before. It was a giant block of cold gummy cheese like food. \\n0 Star.\\n\\nFish Taco: So, I work in a restaurant so I know what food is. I took a bite, without looking to much, wanting to give it a taste before I pass judgement (sometimes it looks bad but tastes SO good). Anyway, this aint that. It was cold and flavorless, and I spit it out. I checked the fish, which was FROZEN FISH STICKS! They were not fresh anymore than I am 6 feet tall. The \\"fish\\" was rubbery (not what Talapia does when fresh) and the \\"batter\\" wasn't batter. It had been placed there by some giant machine months before, then frozen and shipped. To add insult to injury, the sauce sucked too.\\nNEGATIVE STARS\\n\\nService: I had a horrible experience, but it wasn't my servers fault. She was nice, got my order right, and could tell I didn't like my food. She even got the manager to stop by. Always tip your server, it's not her fault. She doesn't know the food sucks.\\n3 Stars.\\n\\nThe Manager: He stopped by, which I gave me a little bit of hope. He then told me the reason the fish taco was cold was because of the slaw. I then said it could because the fish was frozen. He did what every manager does, raise his hands, because he has no response. He asked me if I wanted something else, but I was done. He did not remove the item from the bill, which I didn't push. He would assume I am trying to \\"get over on him\\" and trying to get something for free. I don't want free stuff, I want good food, and knowing what I knew then, there was no way that would happen there.\\n0 Stars.\\n\\nIf you like kitsch tall margaritas and shitty food, this place is for you, but if you like food and love Mexican food, this is the worst I had since someone in the midwest gave me marinara sauce as salsa."},{"name":"South City Kitchen Midtown","address":"1144 Crescent Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Yelp once again points me in the right direction!

We weren't the first in line, but we had a pretty good spot, maybe the 10th or so party?(30th or so in line). \\n\\nThe line really didn't bother me, as they provide lawn chairs if you happen to get there enough.

They also let you have a rough idea when you'll be eating, we were told around 12:15.\\n\\nWhen the doors opened at 11, the line moved fairly quickly and we got to our food at about 11:45.

This place makes me so happy because of the thick slab bacon they serve.\\n\\nThe french toast isn't on thick style bread that many are accustomed to, rather it's more like homemade french toast.

Or mad because how dare an establishment have a limited amount of food. Get over yourself, it's a popular place.\\n\\nWith that said, be prepared to wait, especially on a Saturday. I've been here twice. The first time I went was on a Wednesday. We ran a little late (drove from Waco) and lucked out and got some of the last pieces of meat left for the day. I think we got there about 12:30 and the line was to the door. Second time I went was on a Saturday. We got in line around 9:30 and were kind of far back in line. But, we had chairs and a cooler of beer. They also sell beer to you in the line. Once they opened at 11 we were able to sit in the chairs a little linger while the line moved up. It took an hour and a half from the time they opened to get to order our food. So three hours of total waiting time. We were very prepared for that so it wasn't bad at all. Most of the time we were able to sit down.\\n\\nNow, on to the food. Both times, wow. The second time was better I think because we sat outside smelling it for three hours. Both times I got brisket. It was amazing. It was the fatty version. Perfect amount of fat and it just kind of melted in my mouth. Amazing burn on the outside. The second visit I requested burnt ends. Aaron, the owner, said they don't purposefully make them, but he cut off that end of the brisket for me. Wow, the flavor! The flavor and texture of the outside of the brisket is unexplainable, and not just the burnt ends, but any piece. I want all my food that way! The other item I got on both visits was the pork ribs. Geez! So good. I lived in Memphis for a while and their ribs can't compare (I got ridiculed a lot being from Texas and thinking we have good BBQ). They are so tender, it's like the meat was never attached to the bone. Before even biting any meat off, I was able to slide all the meat off the bone. In fact both the brisket and the ribs were so tender, I only had to use one hand the entire time to eat all of it. I kept one hand clean to use my camera with. Sides were coleslaw and potato salad. Alright, but nothing special, pretty fresh though.\\n\\nIn short, get there early (around 9), prepare to wait 2-3 hours on Saturday, bring chairs and beer for the line, don't eat for two days to make room for great BBQ."},{"name":"Stubb's Bar-B-Q","address":"801 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I Love Stubbs in store products however the restaurant wasn't as flavorful and on point like I was expecting.

The meatballs are NOT to be missed - 2 big meatballs for $5 and since we had a party of three, they were able to add an extra meatball for $2. We ordered the Caesar salad and the dressing was made fresh at our table and Jessie explained the process completely. For dinner, we had the filet and the penne a la vodka pasta. Two of us had the filet added to the penne and the steak seasoning seemed to overpower the penne sauce. One guest had the filet with the penne on the side and that was more flavorful (and not as salty). We finished with the coconut cake (a complete small cake that 4 people could share!) based on Yelp recommendations and were quite pleased with it. Two areas of improvement-I agree with a few reviews that state the place is quite LOUD. Although only half the tables were in use, it was difficult to hear at times. We heard the table next to us very clearly. It the place is full, it may be too overwhelming. They need paintings on the wall or something on the ceiling to break the noise level. Second item was the Captain's Cosmo (with dried cranberries at the bottom-excellent!) The first drink was perfectly prepared and the second one was way too sweet, syrupy and took over 10 minutes to get to our table.

Following their instructions, we showed up a few minutes before they were even open up to minimize wait time. Already, there was a short line forming. Crazy.\\n\\nI ordered the #1 (original tonkatsu ramen), and was a bit surprised its appearance. The noodles here are much thinner than typical ramen, and the broth is very creamy. Of course, the broth tasted amazing and the noodles were good. The pork and soft-boiled egg was also very well executed. But about halfway through the bowl, the creaminess and saltiness of the broth overtook the noodles, so it sat pretty heavily in my stomach afterwards.\\n\\nOverall, I'd say Ramen Tatsu-Ya has a unique take on ramen and it is the best that I've tried in Texas so far (here's to hoping that at least a couple of the new ramen places in Houston will actually rise to the occasion), but not worth a long wait (the line I saw piling out the door was ridiculous).

So that's a definite plus.\\n\\nThe taste... as much as I'd like to say the \\"world famous\\" spot had world famous burgers, they didn't. They were pretty bland and basic. I should have opted for the jiffy burger, I think that one would have at least been memorable. I did however really like their fried zucchini and shrooms appetizer.

The worst was when my friend said she had a dairy allergy, that the server suggested the benny, and when we asked specifically - wait, doesn't hollandaise have butter in it, she had to *go check*...and 15 min later, after she had put in everyone else's order, finally came back - my friend ended up ordering a scramble...only to find that the tofu scramble had cheese in it!

The ginger beer is *amazing* though it's almost painful to pay $3.50 for it (though, it is so good...).

The accolades are deserved. We have a little place in Wimberley and sometimes make the trek to Austin to shop and relax. I'd recently read the review for Franklins in A food magazine and suggested it when we started getting hungry on a Saturday trip to Austin. We got there around 12:30 and saw a line out the door. With no other alternatives near by we decided to take out luck on the line. First idea that we were in the right place was when a server came out on the line offering cool drinks and samples of the sausage. Brilliant! Second idea was that at the \\"sold out\\" sign went up a short time after we got in line and people still stayed on the hopes that there would be something left. We stayed too and - although the wait seemed forever - were rewarded for our persistence.\\nThe brisket is spectacular. I can honestly say that I have never tasted anything this good before. We've been to Salt Lick and a number of other BBQ places in the area and there is simply nothing else in this league. The brisket is moist and flavorful. We tried both the lean and the fatty cuts and they were both moist, deeply flavorful and seasoned perfectly. The sausage reminds me of old Polish kielbasa (sp?) from the east coast with a wonderful crunch to the skin. The owner was generous with the cuts we received and he even threw in two ribs since it was my wife's birthday. The meat does not need sauce but I tried it and was impressed with the taste.\\nSince we were one of the last in line I was unsure if there would be anything left but took a chance and asked for a pound to take home. Again, the owner was more than happy to pull an order together and I know we had the better end of the bargain. We just finished it off for lunch today and it was almost as good as fresh. The day in the frig really helped concentrate the smokey flavor. \\nI'd recommend Franklins to anyone. But I'd tell them to hurry to get the full experience. With food this good, i'd be worried that success will change them over time. Get there now before this changes one bit and then you can always have the memories. \\nIn short, Franklins is now the measure I will use whenever I eat BBQ."},{"name":"Jalapenos","address":"1277 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"So I like this place because of the people mostly.

The service was impeccable, the cocktails were deliciously complex with a smooth satisfying finish, and the food....oh my, the food, was an experience a true foodie dreams of. We got the fried chicken complete with maple ice-cream perched on top a waffle cone, which, minutes after consuming, I decided should be nick-named \\"The Breakfast of Champions\\".\\n\\nThe Mushroom Omelet, deceiving in its seemingly simple title, was anything but simple. The mushrooms were tender, the mozzarella was generous, and the use of truffle oil was in perfect proportion. I dont know about you, but I find most places over indulge in the use of truffle oil, which tends to dominate and overwhelm the other aspects of flavors. Not so in this case, with the tempura fried cloves of garlic and the gentle bite from the fresh basil in the finish completed this dish to perfection.\\n\\nWe got the Grapefruit brulee as a side to share, but I unapologetically admit I ate almost all of it. I anticipated it being really sweet, but it was actually delicately balanced. Soft peppermint chips, with the morsels of grapefruit complimented by the 2 meringues, was surprising on the palette, easy on the eyes, and tasted incredible.\\n\\nTheir array of spirits is unique yet versatile, with plenty of options to choose from. I loved that that they had a completely different list of featured cocktails for brunch, yet still happily serving the original concoctions that I have grown to love. We tried the Spring Daisy, which was pleasantly spicy and delicious, (the ginger not over-powering like in most cocktails). The Siamese Caipirinha with Thai chili's and fresh basil, dangerously PERFECT for this ridiculous hot weather. Finally, The Mexican 86, probably my favorite of all, complete with the most delicious cherry I have ever had, waiting for me at the bottom of the glass, like an old friend waiting to give you a high five.\\n\\nWe were so full from brunch, we didn't have any room for dessert on this trip, but I cannot wait to go back and explore more of their menu.

Maybe the vegetarian main courses would be better. The price range of the restaurant is on par with G'Raj Mahal. But the location is not good and neither is the ambience. The lighting is weird and the design is kind of off. Some cool booths in the corner but not much else going for it. For this reason, I deducted an additional star. The best thing about my meal was the naan. The bill definitely was a bit of a sticker shock when we hadn't ordered any drinks, and the portions are on the small size, especially for the appetizer.

NEVER have your bachelorette party here unless they make some changes. First, they charge each person $50 for the meal. We were told we had to do the meal family style, which we thought meant the food would come out on one dish and people would get to pick from the platter to eat. Nope, the food came out individually (so we could've each ordered our own thing). The food itself was not worth that amount; the chicken was very dry and the pretzels that came with the fondue were extremely stale. Second, the Bachelorette Goblet section is very misleading. You pay $36 for a goblet of candy (crappy candy that no one else wants), a candy garter and bra. We could've paid way less than that to buy this stuff individually at a store. The goblet drinks themselves are pretty good, but if you're not used to consuming that much sugar, you'll definitely get a headache and a constant brain freeze. You'll only get a minor buzz unless you drink it really fast (which I don't recommend). When we complained about all of this, the manager was not friendly at all and only offered us a free goblet, probably to make us forget about the $400 (!!!!!!!!) bill. We also thought we'd be able to get a semi-private booth or something similar, instead we were placed in the middle of the dining area at a tiny table (there were 4 of us).

Really blended in well with the fresh veggies and fruit. \\n\\n2) Herb Marinated Beets with Indian Spiced Yogurt - Beets seem to be a common theme between the two restaurants, but I'm not complaining! Another clean, refreshing dish! \\n\\n3) Charcuterie Board with Copa, Lardo, Cured Pork, Liverworst sausage, and Blood Sausage - This was definitely my favorite course of the night. However, I did wish that they had told us they'd bring out 2 boards at the same time. I have a nut allergy so they brought out the nut-free one first, but they didn't tell us there'd be a second board. So the four of us shared 1 small board that was meant for the nut-allergy peeps. However, the manager did offer to bring us a refill of some meats of our choice. There wasn't a single thing that I didn't enjoy on this board. My favorites were the two sausages.\\n\\n4) Squash Risotto - I'm not usually a fan of risotto but this wasn't heavy at all. \\n\\n5) Butter Braised Pork Loin - For being the main entree, I thought that this pork loin could've been a little better. I didn't think the meat had enough flavor, but it was cooked perfectly. It's really hard to cook pork so bravo. \\n\\n6) Lemon and Blood Orange drops, and some hard to chew dessert- Loved both the drops, but there was this one thing that  was insanely hard to eat and it stuck to your teeth.

Was going to go to Cafe Zen but the lineup was insane. The girlfriend randomly thought of Oakwood so we made our way down here. Free street parking - yeh! \\n\\nWe were expecting a wait and there would have been if we wanted an inside table. Why would we? It's louder and darker inside. There was no wait if we sat outside, so we of course sat outside. We even got the table we got last time. I'll admit I'm attached to that table for several reasons: sat there last time, had a lovely romantic evening with my girlfriend at that same table, it has fresh air, is quieter and it's the only table by the door while the other 3 tables across the entranceway are closer together. It felt way more intimate which I loved. \\n\\nHad a tough time choosing between the pork belly and the brisket sandwich. Then the horrible, mean, monkey wrench throwing server (I'm trying to be humorous) dangled the feature sandwich at me. Now I have three awesome things to choose from. Crap! I ended up getting the feature because the other two are staples so I could always have them another time. So what was the feature: a mind blowing, O-sound inducing sloppy Joe with cheddar, fried egg, pickled onions and jalape√±o on an amazingly cloud like fluffy bun. SHOVE THAT THING IN MY FACE. It was a mess. It was all over both hands. One napkin didn't suffice. Those fried cubed potatoes were delicious too with that ketchup powder/salt sprinkle on it. \\n\\nMy girlfriend had the smoked pork hock benedict and that was also really good. That hollandaise sauce was the lightest one I've ever eaten.

It might be purely preferential; I enjoy my ribs wet with meat falling off the bones and tangy sauce. But there's more to it than just taste... you've also got the blues. Live music is played nightly by authentic blues bands making the experience that much sweeter. The ambiance is VERY authentic, because IT IS! This isn't Sticky Fingers or Famous Dave's, this is the one and only Fatt Matt's and there's nothing else like it. Don't expect labels with \\"locally sourced\\" or \\"organic\\"... the bread is Sunbeam slices. Sure you're probably turned off by the blanched flour, but remember when you were a kid and you had that bologna & mayo sandwich with Sunbeam (or Wonder)...yeah, you get to relive that all over again.\\n\\nSeating is limited and they certainly don't take reservations.

That being said, I don't think I would've minded paying $35/person for the show we got.  So let's get down to the nitty gritty of the review, and let's be honest, what you all want to hear.\\n\\nThis review will be categorized in five sub-categories.\\n\\n1) Pre-show - 2/5 - The pre-show is exactly as most people made it sound,... lots of people shoved into a small room with souvenirs lining the walls, a small appetizer cart with pasta/bread and actors giving a prelude to the story you are about to listen to/experience.  That being said, it's not ALL that bad,... sure the acting can be a little campy, but honestly I expected it going into it.  I was all set to roll my eyes at the show in the first place!\\n\\n2) Main Show - 3/5 - The show itself was very confusing and filled with plot holes,... but not much you can do about that.  I mean,... it's vampire pirates.  Not exactly much text to go by there!  With this in mind, the acrobatics and stunts were,... much to my surprise, rather well done.  Once again, I didn't expect much! But I was rather surprised at the quality of the stunts/acrobatics done by some of the actors.  Swinging on a rope, meh.  But the \\"Sun Faerie\\" as they called her,... jesus,.... she was rather amazing.  The story wasn't the show,.... I firmly believe this.  I believe the show is in the stunts and talent that some of them have.\\n\\n3)  Food - 3/5 - I will say this quite a bit,..... I didn't expect much.  The menu was pretty spare consisting of;\\n     a) Buccaneer Beef Kabobs - wife ordered this, she actually liked it (HEY MIKEY!)\\n     b) Gluten Free Meal\\n     c) Roasted Chicken Half - the rest of us ordered this meal, more will be explained.\\n     d) Vegan Meal\\n     e) Veggie Meal\\nThese were the choices you could get with your standard ticket (These are the adult menu items).  Each item is served with soup or salad, and dessert.  The soup was a tomato soup (REALLY thick) and we were told to eat like pirates,.... meaning they didn't have spoons or something. This might be fun for kids,... but honestly I couldn't eat it thinking that not all dish washers/employees do the best of jobs. I just didn't feel comfortable doing this.  I ended up passing it along to my step-father to accompany his salad.  \\n\\nAs for the main entree, I was really surprised.  I heard all these people who came to a show and expected '5 star' cuisine.  I don't understand that personally,.... you pay $50+ a plate at most 5-star restaurants, so why would you even remotely expect this?  My mother, step-father and myself got the chicken.  Mine was extremely juicy and well done, falling off the bone and actually tasting rather good (quite possibly around Applebee's quality or around there).  The vegetables were surprisingly good (standard fair,... carrots, broccoli, cauliflower) and the rice was also really good.  It had pieces of vegetables mixed in and actually reminded me of a mix of Spanish rice and fried rice, a good accompaniment to the meal honestly.  My wife's meal was the Buccaneer Beef Kabobs,.... we didn't know what to expect going into this honestly, as everyone has different interpretations of what a kabob comes with.  The steak pieces had a light sauce on them that prevented it from being dried out, and the vegetables (tomato, peppers and onion for those who want to know) were really well done and delicious.  Honestly,.... dessert could be passed over.  It tasted like a sheet brownie from GFS with ice cream on the side.  The ice cream far out shined the brownie itself.\\n\\n4) Acting - 2/5 - Once again, I didn't expect movie quality here,.... who honestly could?!  The different 'stand vampirates' (the actors who held sections for activities,... such as red/green/blue/purple/yellow etc etc) were very bland.  Obviously that's hard to hide if you've been doing it for so long.  Some were better than others,... we were in the purple section (and as the lady who gave us the tickets commented,... \\"Oh you got the crazy one\\"). He was honestly the best one there,... he was VERY crowd attentive, even playing with some of the kids in the crowd. \\n\\n5) After show - 5/5 - After the show was all said and done the people were moved back into the pre-show room where they had a dance party. There were tons of kids/adults dancing with the vampirates who joined them on the dance floor.  It went on for around 5-6 songs before the pirates went back to the dressing room, and the crowd slowly filtered out of the hall to go home.\\n\\nI know most of you are looking at this wondering how I got 4/5 stars, but it honestly was due to the Purple Vampirate. He more than made the show enjoyable for us as he was 'checking' up on us, making sure that we were all having fun and being part of the show.  Very professional!\\n\\nWithout that interaction I could see 3/5 solid, enjoyable for a one time to see the hype.

Soul fire is truly a gem of the New England BBQ scene. \\n\\nStart with their chicken \\"wings.\\" Each wing is the entire drumstick-wing combo and they've got such a great subtle smoked flavor.

I'll go ahead and tell you that despite the address, this place is not located on West Peachtree, but is actually on Cypress.  Save yourself a headache and go in with that knowledge, young grasshopper.  I made the mistake of parking between 8th & 9th, assuming it was just around the corner, and then walked blocks before calling my date.  He graciously met me while walking, as I probably wouldn't have figured out where it was otherwise and he wasn't all that familiar with the area's streetnames.  \\n\\nWe sat at a giant picnic table near the fire pit on the patio.  Love the fire pit, by the way.  I had a hard cider, which was the best I'd ever had, and he ordered a barley wine.  We ordered food, which was when he found out I'm a vegetarian.  I had the veggie burger, fairly easy choice, and he chose what I henceforth will refer to as the Meatzza.  My veggie burger was flavorful, but fell to pieces--not what I was hoping for.  He seemed to enjoy his Meatzza.  \\n\\nThe server was cute and if I weren't on a date, I might have left him my number.  (Hell, I probably should have anyway.)

I literally just stepped out of this crap hole of a restaurant and couldn't wait any longer to write this review. What a disaster it was. By the way we only came here because fogo de chao wasn't accepting walk ins. So I found this little gem of a restaurant ... Not. Where do I begin? First I was seated by the door and I asked to move . When given a table further inside my waitress ( an older white female) yelled at the girl seating us and told her \\"she has too many tables to tend to\\" and then she ignored us and not once did she look over at us, or come to our table. I kid you not, it was as if we were invisible she did not even glance over at our table. The meat came and we had no plates for the meat. I had to ask another girl for plates. Then came our alternate waiter, a young spanish guy. Worst waiter of the year award goes to this looney tune. No appetizers were given to us (cheese bread and fried plantains) , he didn't even introduce himself or explain the process, and he just kept capping off our water, while we starved waiting for the meat to come around. The salad bar was absolutely disgusting, omg I wanna puke just thinking about it. The sushi was so bad, the Pasta station was a complete joke. I ordered gnocchi and penne Alfredo, and by the time they were done (15-20 minutes) I was full from water and wanted to leave. The pasta was undercooked and gnocchi was as well. I literally had plates of food stacked on my table that I didn't even touch. The same meats kept coming around. The lamb chops were so gamey, the top sirloin wasn't juicy like other places, and the meat carvers were just totally skipping our area. I asked my waiter what the appetizers were that he placed on the other guests table, they are complementary and should have been given to us at the very beginning, he answers \\" oh those are appetizers, you want some\\" ah no, I don't. Everything I ate there was mediocre. No damn fried banana could fix this hot mess. Dessert was also included in our meal, and as per usual, our waiter didn't even offer Dessert or mention it. I saw the free dessert sign as I was leaving. I ended up paying $110 for some mediocre food for 2 people, 2 sodas. I was about to explode and I marched over to the manager to speak to him but my husband pulled me away and wouldn't let me complain.

This cute, boutique-like caf√© is on the same sidewalk as Burger King and the soon-to-be Starbucks. \\n\\nThe interior is definitely different than your typical Vietnamese establishment. From the vintage tea cups to the chic paper lantern lights to the rustic photos on the wall, this caf√© gives you a sense of cozy chicness. \\n\\nThe menu is simple and sweet - ranging from banh mi to one choice of pho noodle soup bowl to appetizers and simple drinks.\\n\\nThe first time I came here I tried the Banh Mi Trio - the bread is super crispy on the outside and freshly chewy and warm on the inside - bread at its finest! The protein fillings were rich in flavour and the pickled veggies were fresh and crunchy. Every bite was delicious!\\n\\nThe one choice of pho noodle soup made the decision easy - fresh beef slices and beef balls - all grass fed and hormone free. The broth was hot and full of flavour and the noodles were al dente. \\n\\nOne unique dish that I order time and time again is the Savoury Mini Crepes. Served in a cast iron plate to keep it hot and crispy, the tiny rice crepes with the savoury shrimp, sweet onions and tangy fish sauce is a delight for the taste buds! The shrimp crackers/chips that come with certain dishes is really special, thick, super crispy and not oily like the typical shrimp chips - a winner in my chip lovers book.\\n\\nTheir macarons are another unique and happy reason to come. A wide range of flavours from earl grey to matcha to vanilla and more but the true reason to get these are because they are decorated into cute characters like totoro, hello kitty, minions and they keep changing each time i go!\\n\\nThere's so much more I can say but you just have to visit here to experience it all.

The conquistador was less impressive, though it sounded amazing with its slow roasted pork shoulder, chile sauce, avocado, cilantro and onion components. It was good, but nothing mindblowing.

I was looking for a coffee shop/bistro that allowed dogs on the patio, and this place sounded perfect.\\n\\nMy husband and I walked up to Apres Diem and almost skipped out because most of the people eating there looked fancier than we did after a couple of hours in the sun, but we were already there, the patio looked great, and we'd heard good things - so we headed in anyway. \\n\\nThere wasn't anyone on the patio to seat us, so after awkwardly waiting for a couple of minutes, we decided to seat ourselves at a corner patio table away from others (since we had our dog). We didn't see any signage regarding pets, and had been told they were allowed - so we tied our 18 lb. pup up on the chair furthest from other people and waited.\\n\\nIt was almost 5 minutes before anyone came to take our drink order...at 2:30 PM on a Sunday. Whatever, we're pretty chill, but when the waitress arrived, we immediately asked if dogs were allowed on the patio (obviously we're not trying to break any rules) and she paused before saying something like,  \\"uhh...yeah...just try to keep the dog over here\\" and gestured to the furthest edge of the patio, where he was already sitting. The drinks came quickly, and we decided to split a turkey sandwich and salad. \\n\\nOne friendly-ish waitress approached to refill our waters halfway into the meal. When we tried to confirm with her that dogs were ok, she kind of whispered \\"yes...it's a good thing you sat over here though.\\" It was almost as if she was trying to hide her friendliness from the other staff, 3 more of which were directly rude or cold to us over the hour + we were there.\\n\\nOver all, the vibe was extremely disappointing and brought down the entire experience. After we finished our meal, we waited 30 minutes before receiving our check. After about 15 minutes of waiting and not seeing anyone, a waiter approached our table and gestured to 'ask' if we needed our drinks refilled. My husband let him know that we were ready for the check, but still, 10 minutes later, no check was there. When our waitress did finally come back to check on us (after having taken our food order 40 minutes before), she let us know that she was trying to catch up after having computer problems earlier that day. I was glad she acknowledged the fact that we had been completely forgotten, but as a customer service/IT professional, I was very disappointed in the fact that on top of slow service due to a computer issue, she was also completely rude to us - personally, I would have been fine with the wait if she had been friendly to make up for it, but that definitely wasn't the case.\\n\\nTo wrap up here, I have to say, the food was awesome. The patio was nice, music was good, and the coffee was great. We felt so uncomfortable that we couldn't even enjoy the experience, which is what prompted me to write this review. It sucks that I won't be able to justify going back, but a wasted hour, $20, and a bad experience later, it just doesn't feel worth it."},{"name":"Pok-e-Jo's Smokehouse","address":"2121 Parmer Ln","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"The first thing you notice is a suffocating smokiness as you enter.

I chose the chasu pork, and I suggest you add it too, as it was delicious.  At the suggestion of the cashier, I ordered the slider as well.  The slider was really good, but the bowls of ramen are big, which makes an appetizer unnecessary.  The broth that my noodles came in was delicious.

If you sit at the large table between the kitchen and the rest of the restaurant, it's feels like you're sitting in someone's home. This place is a great let's-meet-up-for-drinks spot, date spot, and celebration spot. Parking is valet and makes it easy in an area where parking can be a total headache.\\n\\nHere is a run down of the food I've tried. If you're feeling ravenous or just want to sample a little but of everything, try the family menu. I find it a little pricey but it makes for a really nice meal.\\n\\nAppetizers:\\nGoat cheese fondue: This was fun to eat. It's melted goat cheese with mushrooms and you use square pieces of white bread to sop up all the deliciousness.\\n\\nKale salad: with apples (they have some cinnamon on these), onion, cheese. Yum and a great start before you eat all the grease.\\n\\nMeats:\\nFried chicken: This is the best fried chicken I've had in a long time. In fact, I ordered it twice in 2 weeks... The skin is extra crispy and the spices are perfectly done. You get 3 pieces- breast, thigh, drum.\\n\\nPrime NY Strip: Oh my.. This is a huuuuge piece of meat. It's perfectly cooked, and I would recommend it medium rare. It's a really great meal for a 300 foot gigantic person and could be easily shared with a couple of people.\\n\\nPork chop: Thick cut, juicy, beautiful.\\n\\nSalmon: I may pass on this. Salmon is not my favorite fish though. It was perfectly cooked but nothing really to get excited about.\\n\\nSides:\\nMac and cheese: It comes in a tiny cast iron pot and is creamy and delicious. I think the crumbled potato chips add a nice, crunchy touch.\\n\\nGreens: The collards were really good. They were perfectly cooked and added a nice reprieve from all the meat.\\n\\nBeets: Just yum. Marinated perfectly and not too acidic or sugary.\\n\\nCarrots with dill: Nice and light. I don't think I would order these separately, but they were good with the family style meal.\\n\\nLemon glazed sweet potatoes: Sweet potatoes cut into thick disks. These are really good and not too sweet.\\n\\n\\nDessert:\\n- Fried apple pie + vanilla ice cream: It's like a super upgraded version of McDonald's apple pie. The crust is slightly crispy and the apples are cinnamon-y and chunky.\\n- Lemon icebox pie: This is really tasty, smooth, and tart.\\n- Bread pudding with rum raisin ice cream: I don't really like raisins, but in this, I would definitely eat it. You get the rum taste in this, so if you don't like alcohol, don't get this one. This one is huge.\\n- Peanut butter oreo pie: Also delicious. Very sweet though but the texture and the flavors are exactly what you want in something with peanut butter and oreos.\\n\\nDrinks:\\n- Toasted old fashion! Toasted old fashion!:Ok, I like old fashions, but this one is really fun to watch. They have a sugar coated cinnamon stick that they put a few spritzes of 151 and set it on fire.

The hostess and our waitress were very friendly when we arrived. Our waitress told us to take our time and she would come back to take our drink orders and the mood was initially very happy. We would have liked it if our waitress had walked us through the menu a bit, having to Google translate half the menu is a bit frustrating, and having to ask multiple questions to know exactly we were ordering was a bit of a chore given that it is a relatively small menu. I don't know if our waitress became annoyed that we asked about the menu or what happened but despite a relatively empty restraunt after ordering we barely saw her again.\\n\\nHowever the atmosphere was fun and very comfortable. We tried three cocktails all of which were great.\\n\\nWe started with the crab and corn fritters but when they arrived they were completely burnt on the outside and undercooked on the inside (seemed like their oil was too hot). We considered sending them back but as a server never returned until our entr√©es arrived we didn't have a chance. The server who brought out my dates entree removed the uneaten fritters and all of our silverware without a comment as to why we didn't eat them or even give us a chance to keep them. (She also took our silverware without replacing it).\\n\\nMy date ordered a Cuban sandwich and I had the Chiefs choice ceviche. The Cuban looked great but was completely dry, we actually had to look to see if there was mustard or mayo on it. Again we would have asked a server for some mustard but after dropping off the sandwich they walked away before we could say a word. The sweet potato chips that came with the sandwich were also completely burnt and at the same time under cooked both soggy ans blackened. We actually both spit them out. \\nMy ceviche didn't arrive for about 4 minutes after my dates entree so eventually he started eatting without me while I watched. My ceviche was pretty good, although about halfway through the vinaigrette became so overpowering and I was not able to finish it. I would recommend it as a shared appetizer where you only have a few bites each. My date asked for a box to take the second half of his sandwich (which was a very good size) but because they don't have boxes it was returned to us loosely wrapped in tinfoil which ended up dripping all over the car.\\n\\nWe intended on having dessert hoping to redeem the meal, but our server dropped off the check without a word or a chance to order one, or for my date to order a second drink. \\n\\nAt the end of the night we spent over $120 (with tip) on a meal we couldn't even eat. Given the availability of great food not just in this town but in that neighborhood it was extremely frustrating to basically throw away that money. \\n\\nThe cocktails here were really good, and I would probably bring friends back for the ambiance and drinks before going somewhere else for a meal. But I would in the future sit at the bar where we can't be ignored by our server. I would also be willing to give their happy hour a try.\\n\\nI really wanted to like Isla and we both tried very hard to focus on how comfortable and happy the vibe was, but the foods execution and servers complacency pretty much ruined our night."},{"name":"Karoun","address":"839 Washington St","city":"Newton","stars":"3","text":"We went around 6:30 on a weeknight, so barely anyone was there, and there was just a single waitress serving.

When I asked for hot potatoes and to subsequently have hash browns she took away my entire plate. 10 minutes later I had hot hash browns with the original eggs and sausage ( I knew because I had tried a bite of each to see if they were also cold). Of course, the eggs and sausage were now cold and, frankly, rather gross. This is in part due to the fact that they cook the eggs in some sort of oil combination and not butter. I have never been  a fan of this for my fried eggs and didn't think to ask to have them cooked in butter.

Unfortunately the service is beyond slow. I had brunch, or as I call it, \\"dunch\\" since we're sleeper-inners, making our breakfast between lunch and dinner, and we ended up being there for almost 2 hours! We got seated pretty quick, which I was surprised by, since we were a crew of 5, but then we had to wait, and wait, and wait until our drink orders were taken, and then we had to wait and wait and wait again for our drinks to come. I hate complaining before getting my meal because I used to work in a kitchen and I know what kinda shit goes on behind closed doors. Not that I am suggesting this happens at every restaurant, I just know from personal experience not to piss of the chef. So sure, my breakfast was good, was it worth wasting two hours of my life? Not really. Will I go back? Probably if my friends want to, but it won't be the first place I suggest. \\n\\nI have had the Huevos Rancheros which is good, and also the Callaloo Benny, in which I noticed that my eggs tasted very vinegary, so it was not so good. The serving sizes are pretty close to perfect, so you don't feel like you are going to explode after you pile all of your breakfast into your mouth at lightening speed, because you had to wait so long that your stomach digested itself. So that is definitely a bonus!

It means that, if when you hear the word \\"hibachi\\" your mind immediately goes to the dim lighting and wafting odors of high quality, freshly prepared food at places like Kobe or Fuji, then.... well, you'll be disappointed. This is that style of food, but with a fast food twist: much faster, at less than half the price, and probably less than half the quality.  So, sure.  It's a tradeoff.  I won't deny that the price point is a loud, convincing argument.  You just need to lower your taste expectations accordingly.\\n\\nSushi... well, if I were you I'd just pass on that.  Some of the things that make the hibachi not quite up to par (namely, the proteins) also haunt the sushi selections -- but at least with the hibachi, those items are cooked.  And as any sushi lover well knows, as important as the quality of the fish is in ANY seafood dish, that importance is at least twofold when that fish is raw.\\n\\nI rate Kyoto as I do based on the \\"all things being equal\\" mentality.  However, since life is rarely that simple, here are a couple of caveats that would bring the rating up higher, in which case I would recommend it:\\n\\nHibachi:\\n- You are craving hibachi but absolutely CANNOT spend more than $10.\\n- You are craving hibachi but you only have 45 minutes to eat.\\n- It's either this or Burger King.\\n\\nSushi:\\n- You have never had sushi before, so there is no reference point.\\n- You don't eat any sushi with raw protein.\\n- \\"I'm just gonna drown it in white sauce anyway.\\"\\n\\nYou get the idea.

Seriously, why aren't you people at work?\\n\\nAnyway, I was able to park and get seated right away (again, at the only empty table), but the late afternoon crowd illustrates just how good the place is. The building is nicely-converted auto repair shop with lots of indoor space combined with a fairly large patio to hold all of their customers. \\n\\nAs far as food goes, the pulled pork was stellar, and the bbq baked beans and macaroni and cheese (shells, not elbows) were way above average. A nice surprise. Unlike most other bbq places, Fox Bros. only had one sauce to offer (one less decision to make), and I have no complaints. It was delicious--both sweet and tangy at the same time. How is that possible?\\n\\nI paid $15 for my meal (including drink)--an amount that initially struck me as high. But the servings were so generous, that I was able take half of my meal home for tomorrow's lunch. Not bad.\\n\\nThat said, the thing that stands out about this restaurant is the service. Many barbecue joints pride themselves on their rough, blue-collar demeanor, but these guys clearly go out of their way to make you feel welcome. No placing your order at the counter, it's a full-service restaurant with a friendly and efficient staff.

I went to Franklin BBQ on Fri, Dec 19, 2014.  I was in town visiting friends and my buddy's wife told me a trip to Franklin was not to be missed.  We had way too many Shiner Bocks the night before so I really wasn't feeling up to the long wait I had heard about, but my buddy kicked me in the back side and off we went.  We loaded up with chairs since we knew there would be a lengthy wait and then stopped and picked up a 12 pack of Lone Star at 8:30am and joined the line by about 9:30am.  \\n\\nThe staff at Franklin was great and treated all the waiting customers well and sold beverages (we brought plenty of our own), got a head count to determine what BBQ we would purchase and how much.  One of the guys came out and chatted with us for a good bit and told us about the process of prepping and smoking the briskets.  He told us we would be served by approx 12:30p and he only missed it by 5 min.  We were served at 12:35p.  I actually enjoyed the wait in line.  Got to meet a bunch of cool new people, the weather was perfect and seriously what problem is there with sipping cold beers on a Friday morning haha.\\n\\nWhen we got in, I ordered 3 meats:  the brisket (lean cut), the jalapeno sausage and the ribs.  First off, I've had BBQ all over the USA so I feel like I might know a thing or two.  Second, this place is hands down, without question, across the board THE best BBQ I have ever had.  In my life!  Period.  :)   The brisket was better than advertised.  I got the lean cut and it was perfect.  Nice smoke ring, incredible flavor and tender and juicy.  The best brisket I have ever had!  Not to be outdone by the brisket was the jalapeno sausage.  I almost like sausage better than beef and this was one of those days where I was seriously challenged to pick a favorite.  Ultimately the brisket won out but dang that sausage was good, juicy, spicy but not too hot and perfectly smoked.  The ribs were also very good but truth be told, I'm not much of a rib guy.\\n\\nYou cannot go wrong with Franklin.  Just don't be a jerk.  Yes, you are going to wait.  No matter what.

When one of the owners came back again with the dreaded black sharpie, you could have heard a pin drop as everyone waited to see what was going to be next on the sold out list. The crowd rejoiced as he wrote \\"potato salad\\". Hallelujah! After an hour we were next in line and the guy in front of me polished off the pulled pork. Damn you pulled pork guy! I love the pulled pork and I'm not really even a fan of pulled pork! Ended up with sausage (hot off the smoker) and both lean and fatty brisket along with a chopped beef sandwich and a tipsy texan (chopped beef and sausage).  Both sandwiches were loaded with onions, pickles and cole slaw.  Absolutely divine. Sauces (especially the sweet and espresso) were perfect compliments to the meat, and the beans and cole slaw as well. \\n\\nOwner said the queue now forms at 10:20 or so. They sold out of everything except chopped beef by a little before 2.

They are seriously the bomb.com when it comes to that.....i cannot go anywhere else for my pumpkin chai's. \\n\\nTheir mocha is also exactly the way I like it. A little more on the milk chocolatey side, as opposed to sometimes that harsh, bitter dark taste you get at places like Starbucks.\\n\\nTheir iced coffee is also to die for. It's so rich, and almost has this chocolatey, caramel taste all by itself. They suggest the best way to drink it is not to dress it up with cream and sugar too much because it doesn't need it. They also I think told me they cold brew the coffee, which gives it a different flavor. \\n\\nI haven't tried any of the baked goods, mainly because I'm trying to be diet conscience, but everything looks homemade and self prepared. \\n\\nFor me, a poor college student, the prices are steep, with a small latte being $4, or a medium iced coffee being over $3, but at the same time, it's super worth it!"},{"name":"Screen Door","address":"2337 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Excellent food , chicken is a must have, gumbo, mac & cheese and potatoes.

She had no idea about any of the drinks on the menu or the desserts. Nor did she care to find out.

I finally tracked her down rolling silverware in the corner inside the restaurant. At this point it had easily been 30+ minutes since we had seen her. I handed her my credit card and asked for the check. It was 10:30 pm and the place was clearing out. She looked at me like a deer in headlights. She never once apologized to me. In fact she stared at me like she didn't know that we were her guests ( probably because she never spent any time waiting on us). I finally told her where we were sitting so she can pull the bill. I returned to the table to fill out the credit card slip. I always tip generously, especially around the holidays, but was so irritated that I left a minimal tip.

He was always there and always polite but not overbearing.  My first mistake was to stray from the specials menu--should have tried the Sunday brunch Huevos Rancheros, but opted, instead, for the Spinach and Artichoke Chimichanga ($7.95).  I love chimis cause they're crispy, but the menu warned it would be covered in a red sauce, and this made it kind of, well, flabby and soggy.  Plus, artichoke is a tough flavor to pull off in large amounts, and this poor drowned chimi was absolutely stuffed with it.  Serves me right.\\n\\nShe had the real reason you should grace this place with your presence: Blackened Sirloin Salad ($12.95).  The conundrum was this: can they blacken the sirloin while still serving it rare?  Yes, they can do that, and did, dammit.

This does not mean it was bad, just not my standard.\\n\\nStarted off with beef tataki and hokkai yaki. \\n\\nBeef tataki was okay, could be better if the beef were served chilled instead of room temperature. Their portion was generous however comparing with the rest of the menu, it lacked flavor. Smart move on their part to serve it with lemon and ponzu sauce. Gave it the acidic flavor it was missing. \\n\\nHokkai yaki is really good. Just enough flavor and the texture was there. Wasnt over powering with spicy mayo, mushroom gave it the crunch and scallop were broiled perfectly.\\n\\nFor entree, had the sashimi regular. Generous amount of sashimi rested on top of ice to keep it chilled. Presentation was crowded with oba leaf and daikon. Had 15 pieces as listed on the menu. 3 tuna topped with tobiko, 3 salmon topped with ikura, 3 yellowtail with scallion, 3 seared suzuki topped with their torched sauce (fried onion, sesame, oil, scallion), 2 octopus, and 1 scallop topped with tobiko.\\n\\nThe fishes were extremely fresh. Their torched sauce is lip licking good! Gave it a nice smokey flavor yet does not over power the dish.

It steals the soul out of a food that is best served luke warm and freshly made. The pickles were a canned middle eastern brand. Eh. The amba, a dried mango sauce, was tasty, but the tiny spritz of it, just on the eggs was hardly adequate. \\n\\nThe eggplant slices were good. They were griddled rather than fried, as is typical, and I like the lighter and less greasy version here. The felafel balls were premade, and simply reheated before service. While that's convenient for the small kitchen, they lacked that crackling crust of a freshly made felafel ball. \\n\\nSo all in all, the price is fair for a decent size portion of tasty enough food. The food truck itself, along with the hard shell canopy over the tables, was charming and practical. \\n\\nIf you are drinking on Mississippi and want an affordable and reasonable healthy quick grab, wolf and Bear totally rises to the challenge.

That being said, this is a great place for groups bc everyone can all order different things and you can share-zies.\\n\\nBetween all the starters and the daily specials and their local vegetable selections and their standard menu items it was really tough to decide what to get.. THEN they decide to throw you a screwball and complicate it either further by giving you the chance to build your own combo plate... Hopefully you are not the type of person who is overwhelmed when you have too many options to wade thru...\\n\\nNeither my husband or I wanted to commit to the fried chicken dinner, but we did get the friend chicken fingers appetizer. YUMMERS. I ended up getting their gumbo (good -- but even better when I added hot sauce), the carrots, and the potatoes. Served w/ corn bread. Hubs got pork shoulder that was served with giant (canneloni?) beans and slaw. THEN we had pretty much 20% of an upside down gingerbread apple cake.\\n\\nConsidering we brought home a good sized lunch's worth of leftovers, not really all that pricey -- 2 cocktails, an app, 2 dinners, and a huge dessert for $60."},{"name":"S&S Cafeteria","address":"3583 Chamblee Tucker Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"I have to place a disclaimer that I'm not a big fan of cafeteria food so therefor I might be a bit biased. \\n\\nWent here because boss was gonna take me to lunch.

I've heard of comparison of this place vs ma tthews or Piccadilly but while I've never visit either of the mentioned restaurants, I can't make a direct comparison. \\n\\nYou walk in, get in line with a tray and start loading up on what you want. They charge by the little plates and portions seems to be reasonable. They start with the salads, move to the dessert and then entry while finishing off with side items. \\n\\nWhile moving through the line, there are a lot of options and I ended with this on my plate: bowl of salad, chocolate moose pie, roast beef, corn muffin and a side of green beans. \\n\\nMy favorite of all the items would be the moose pie, it's hard to go wrong. But I felt that everything came out of a can. Roast beef was decent but a little chewy (is it supposed to be that way?), corn muffin was a little dry and the green beans was salty. The salad was ok if it had more ranch just to drown it out but what bothered me was the stale and chewy croutons.\\n\\nOverall, it's ok. This is what comes to mind when people say \\"southern comfort food\\" I don't really think it's my type of food, but judging from their clientele, they've made some life long customers so that gotta stand for something.

We actually attempted to come twice during the soft opening but without luck...each time we showed up there was a note staying they were closed. Bummer...I was a little irritated to be honest. If on my third attempt the restaurant wasn't open I probably wouldn't have returned for awhile. \\n\\nBeing the ramen obsessed folk that we are, we ALWAYS go for one broth only - Tonkotsu. So naturally the husband and I both ordered #1 Tonkotsu Original with an extra soft boiled egg (extra egg $1.50). The broth was very rich and flavorful. The noodles although a bit thinner than I would prefer, we're delicious. My only complaint? They are very stingy with the pork belly. They gave us one very small piece! Most ramen places we have been to (and we have been to many) always give you 2-3 good size pieces. I know you always have the option to purchase extra toppings but theybdo include a couple of pieces. Anyway, the pork belly is very tender...perfectly cooked....I just wish they gave you more!\\n\\nOverall, I thought the portion of broth and noodles were perfect and not too shabby for $8.50. They do allow you the option of adding more noodles if you end up with extra broth...all you have to say is \\"Kaedama please\\" (means to refill your noodles) and pay $1.50 and voila! More deliciousness!\\n\\nYou also have an option to add different \\"bombs\\" to your broth. The bombs basically change/enhance the flavor of your broth. You can choose from Mexican (makes your broth taste like tortilla soup), corn (seasoned corn and butter), spicy or fire in the bowl. The first three bombs listed here are $1; the fire in a bowl is $1.50. \\n\\nWe also tried the Munchie Katsu Slider. Be warned! It's delicious but you only get one small slider for $4.\\n\\nI am so glad that there is finally a good place to satify my ramen cravings here in Austin.

The entire thing was absolutely covered in the tasteless, horrible, golden goo and I could barely finish what I'd been served. \\n\\nMy parents meals were equally as disappointing, my mom having gotten a chicken burrito in which the rice within was undercooked and very underwhelming.

It's definitely one of the best 2 or 3 in the Atlanta area, and it has been consistent each time I've ordered it. The level of smoke flavor is pleasant, but not as powerful as some other restaurants. The pork is definitely good enough to eat without any sauce (the true test of barbecue, to some), but I like the sauce they have a lot, as well. \\n\\nLast week, on my most recent visit, I ordered the burnt ends special as a sandwich. This was absolutely delicious. Nice charred brisket burnt ends, premixed with sauce, on a soft roll - heaven! I'm not sure what the roll was that it was served on, but it was surprisingly good despite looking like a relatively average hamburger bun. I absolutely recommend this to anyone who goes on a day it's available! They were serving it as sliders, as a sandwich, as a platter, and some other way that eludes my memory. I look forward to trying it in some other iteration. \\n\\nAll the sides I've sampled have been top notch. My favorites are the brunswick stew and mac and cheese. Delicious! You also need to try the tomminator..... ridiculous and awesome.\\n\\nPretty good beer selection - always seem to be supporting Sweetwater, which I appreciate. Sweet tea is always solid. \\n\\nOne thing I love about this place is that they have Hotlanta hot sauce on the tables. That stuff is killer, and I love that they support a local company like that.

I don't know if they just buffed the floor or if they wanted to add to the whole gas station feeling theme and just oiled the whole thing, but it was very uncomfortable walking to the table (and I had Dr Martens on which aren't prone to slipping).\\n\\nThe waitress was very friendly and the menu is like you would expect from a burger place.\\nSo I got the bean burger, boyfriend got the Big Kahuna and we got fries with gravy. All excited cause you know, eating a burger is like a treat for me, since it's hard to find a good veggie burger.\\nAnd it's still very hard to find a veggie burger.\\nHoly crap was that thing SAAAALLLTTYYYY.

I thought \\"maybe I need to get used to the taste?\\" and tried another bite. But no, my stomach didn't want it and said 'WOA if that's it, I'm full'. I didn't taste anything except for salt. \\nSo to get the salt taste out of my mouth, I fished through the fries to find one without gravy and that worked. The fries were crispy as they should be, but just like the burger it was a little too salty.\\nMy boyfriend wasn't impressed with the Big Kahuna. He likes different tastes, so that's why he picked the Kahuna (pineapple and teryaki) but he didn't finish it, which was surprising cause he can eat.\\n\\nWhen the waitress came back to check up on us she saw my burger with 2 bites out of it so I told her that it was too salty. She was very apologetic and offered something else but I just wanted to leave.\\n\\nI know it's hard to make a good veggie burger, I've been to many places where they have bean burgers and none of them have been worth coming back for.

I'm sorry, but that's the cost of doing business. Don't treat me like a child not able to behave accordingly. Our food was timed poorly, app came out, immediately food came after. It was ok. But the service was poor. We tried Bambinelli's again this past week for lunch. We purposely came towards the end of a normal lunch hour to avoid the crowd as I had my 1 year old with me. We were told upon entering that we would have more privacy on the patio. We declined as it was quite warm outside. We were seated at a booth not even close to big enough for us, and moved to a larger table upon request. 12 minutes went by and no server. By this time my child, who was hungry, was starting to act up a bit. As I was consoling her, the owner came by and I asked if we had a server. She replied \\" maybe you would be happier on the patio\\", again. I got the hint lady, you didn't want my child in your restaurant!

There are three reasons why we keep going back and why I think Rovente's is a solid 4-star joint.  First, they get their pizzas out fast, 10-15 minutes top.  Second, the outside seating is nicely shaded and right on Hawthorne Blvd.  Lastly, the prices are reasonable.  $12.99 for an XL cheese and toppings are only $1 apiece (plenty to choose from).

Of course there options are the same when it comes to the meats, seafood and veggies. They also have several sushi rolls that I can never find anywhere else. One thing that I find Tokyo has that other places don't is the fish noodles, which is fish paste that is placed in a plastic bag with one end cut of that you can squeeze the noodles out into the pot. Its quite fun and the fish paste is amazing and well flavored. It's not bland like some others.\\n\\nFashion Roll & Fancy Roll: I always order these two together, one is fried tempura and the other is rolled. These two are extremely good and I like that they work well together. I can't order one without the other .\\n\\nFried Oysters: The oysters are based on head of people there. Honestly, it is good because the oysters aren't canned but I don't think I want to pay $7.95 for 2 oysters because only two people are there. This is one of the items that I think they should let us know come in an order.\\n\\nFried Gyoza: The fried dumplings tend to come a little too browned but the filling is good. The only thing I have to complain is that there is always too much oil that is left over. I don't understand why too because only the bottom is fried. \\n\\nCilantro & Preserved Egg Broth: If you want a broth that is light and healthy try this broth. I think it stands out from the others. Don't let the preserved egg scare you!\\n\\nIf you dont plan to be here for a few hours, stay away as the service is really slow as there are only two main servers on the floor for hotpot, three if its during intense hours I believe. But they are slow and tend to take forever to get your food to you. There is a younger server that always introduces himself as a relative of the head chef of the grilling side. This gentleman is quite talkative and literally would come around talking to us every time he made a circle. I can honestly say that he was at our table 5/6 times in 30 minutes and kept talking for while. \\n\\nI do not like how he had asked me if I was vietnamese and when I answered he didn't further the conversation. After he came back and talked to me in vietnamese saying that he was going to go eat. He also attempted to pick up my friend and was not successful. He works weekends and tuesdays, I believe and honestly, I avoid those hours because he is way to interested in the customers. \\n\\nHonestly, I love hotpot and I crave it for months on hand.

Where else can you find a coleman beef burger for $6.95?  It tastes amazing.  Most places charge more for gimmicky burgers that have regular, run of the mill, factory beef.  Coleman beef plus the preparation make it a gem that is not commonly found, at least not for the price.  Also the nachos are awesome and they even have specialty burgers (think buffalo tofu, epic).  The entrees are pretty good too but I usually stick to burgers b/c I'm cheap.\\n\\nThe ambience: Cool and relaxing in the summer, warm and inviting in the winter.  It's always clean and the layout is nice.  Love the fireplace.\\n\\nThe beer menu (OMG!): They have something like 12 rotating taps.  You can tell the taps are always clean as well because the beer has never tasted anything but fresh.  The selection is delicious and local and as I mentioned before, the staff know what they're talking about when you ask them about it.  They also have a lot of static taps and bottled beers.\\n\\nOverall: This place has been a great spot for me for about 3 years now.

Turns out it was The Oakwood. A lucky discovery indeed! It's small and unassuming from the outside, but inside the restaurant is warm and organic with a decor that balances rustic and modern. The service exuded a friendly vibe. TVs played up in the rafters, but there weren't so many as to be distracting. Also, I'm a bit of a music nerd and I have to mention that they do a good job on the in-house playlist! A mix including Andrew Bird, Miike Snow,  and The Whitest Boy Alive has to win some extra love from this reviewer. \\n\\nThe menu is focused around local ingredients with a blend between fresh West Coast seafood and gastropub/grill dishes. It is a smallish selection, but hits a lot of good angles including a burger, delicately battered fish and chips with house-made tartar and ketchup (!!), seared scallops, mussels, a Waldorf salad, steak and grilled salmon. I tried the steak, while my girlfriend had the aforementioned fish and chips. Both were very well done! The steak arrived cooked to order (I like mine medium-rare) pre-cut into thin portions drizzled generously with peppercorn sauce - lots of peppercorns included, but the spice didn't overwhelm. It wasn't exactly what I was expecting (normally, I think of ordering a steak and getting a slab o' meat!), but it was an exceptionally flavourful and juicy cut of meat. The fish was flaky, light, and crisp without too much greasiness in the batter. Those homemade sauces were tasty, too - you could really tell the difference. \\n\\nThere's also a pretty good beer selection, with on-tap offerings from local brewers Driftwood (I love their White Bark and summer saison) and other local and import labels. Wine selection seemed good too, though I didn't look it over fully. \\n\\nIn summary, the Oakwood has a great casual atmosphere, but it comes with a refined palate!

The problem with this, is that on any given night, with the possible exception of Sunday or Monday, you need to be here before 7 or you'll be waiting a long time to sit down.  I'm referring here to the bar, so before I go any further, I'd better discuss the bar and the restaurant separately.  \\n*RESTAURANT:\\nI've eaten in the main dining room a few times and while it's gorgeous to look at with it's eclectic, overstuffed chairs and couches, I've not yet been blown away by the food.  I'm the first to admit that I have a rather plain palate, but I'm usually willing to try things at least once.  The problem here is that, in my opinion, the menu is actually too eclectic.  You can't just get a piece of grilled chicken or a steak with potatoes.  I applaud Crocker's attempts at bringing Boston dining to Beverly, but wouldn't mind at least one or two staples on the menu.  I've never seen the dining room completely packed, and you can't sit down and only order dessert/alcohol until after 10:00 P.M.  It's pricey.  Enough said.  \\n*BAR\\nI've been to the bar many times.  It's always packed, but you already know that since you read the beginning of this review.  It's small with a bar and stools, about 6 high tables, and 3 or 4 booths.  This might seem generous for any other restaurant's bar, but with the crowds that the Wild Horse pack in, it's not nearly enough.  If you manage to land a table, particularly a high top, expect to have people standing right beside you, eying you, and hoping that at any minute you'll ask for the check and offer up your table.   The food in the bar is much more comfort-based and is delicious.  Burgers and sandwiches are great, salads are huge and the potato-nacho thingys are to die for, but don't eat too many in one sitting.  Just trust me on this one.  They used to make their own ketchup that was the best I've ever tasted, but they stopped.  I can't imagine why.   The coffee sundae and \\"Hunka-Hunka Chocolate Love\\" are divine and generous desserts.  I'm a big martini fan, and the martinis here are generous and delicious, if not particularly strong.  I couldn't pick one to recommend.  I think I've tried the majority of them, and haven't yet found one that I don't like.  The bar is expensive, and in fact, more expensive than a bar should be.  The huge salads I mentioned will run you about 17 dollars and don't expect to pay less than 10 for a sandwich or burger.  Service has always been good with bartenders and servers who know how to navigate the crowds and not make you feel forgotten.  \\nIt's funny.  The more I read this review, the more it sounds like a 2 star review than a 3 star, but I've always had a good time here and plan to have more fun here in the future.

Of the many sushi restaurant in the area, what sets Fuji at WoC apart from others, in addition to the food tasting amazing, is the atmosphere being more upscale. However, just because everything is modern, new, and nice, it doesn't necessarily break the bank as the menu has a wide range of offerings between the typical/standard makimono you can get at most common sushi restaurant, choices of nigari/sashimi (including the availability of uni), more unique and specialized \\"finer makis\\" and \\"finer nigari\\", along with kitchen prepped cooked food (fried rice and noodles etc.) that can cater to many different price points depending on your mood and appetite.\\n\\nFor those who have not been to Fuji at Woc (or Fuji at other locations), I would recommend picking a few things off of the \\"finer special\\" section, as those creations are not offered by other sushi restaurants I've been to in the past.

What?  \\n\\nMom and I went here for brunch on a Sunday, and upon arriving a bit before 1, was told that the dining room was filled with reservations, but we could just grab a table in the bar area.  Plenty of space, we grabbed a high top, and I'm actually glad we ended up on this side, as it seemed to be buzzing with more of a lively energy than the family filled dining room.  Service was prompt, immediately bringing over water and a basket of cornbread bites while we perused the cocktail menu.  Two margaritas soon appeared in front of us, and while my mom dug the apple juice addition to her masarita, I was loving the clean taste of the original margarita, just tequila, cointreau, and lime juice.  Perfection.   My mom couldn't stop eyeing the mac and cheese, so I decided to go for the cobb salad, knowing we'd inevitably end up sharing.  When she ordered the mac and cheese, the waiter/bartender held up a finger, and made a mad dash to the kitchen.  He came back explaining that there was only one left and he'd wanted to make sure she got it.  Thanks man.  Another margarita for me (poor mom was still nursing the tequila) and our food arrived.  First, major accolades to the buttermilk jalapeno dressing (get it on the side, this stuff is thick).  My salad was a huge plate overloaded with greens, hard boiled egg slices, chunks of juicy chicken, and strips of spicy chorizo (although suspiciously lacking in any of the advertised avocado).  And now it's time for the mac and cheese.\\n\\nDios mio.  Served in a hot dish, still bubbling over from the oven, the rotini pasta was smothered in melted smoky gouda, and studded throughout with chorizo chunks and peppers, it was topped with a thin breadcrumb crust and then drizzled in BBQ sauce.  Not a combination I ever would have thought of on my own, but lordy, this was good.  It was a good thing we had the salad, as this is a very big and very rich dish, the two paired together were the perfect brunch nosh.

Sometimes too much rice on the rolls, but hey, they are BIG!!  Large pieces of Nigiri and Sashimi.  Sometimes the service is a little flakey, but one time we were given free Miso Soup because we waited too long...but it actually wasnt long at all.  Other times our waitress is busy socializing with the chefs...but no free soup.  I come for the cheap food not the service or atmosphere.\\n\\nThe prices are the best on Hastings, but sometimes it does look like the rolls are thrown together.
