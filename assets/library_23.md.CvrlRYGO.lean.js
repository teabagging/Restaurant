I had never heard of Jade before but am always interested in trying something new.  \\n\\nWe got there around 6 pm on a Sunday so it wasn't too busy and they were able to easily accommodate our large party and were even willing to hold some extra tables in case more people came.  The atmosphere was nice and the restaurant was clean.  The staff was also very friendly and attentive.  Our server rocked and didn't miss a beat with us all throwing orders at him at different times and spreading our meals out to try a bunch of different things.  \\n\\nThe menu is two-sided with one being the \\"hot\\" side including all the cooked items and dinner entrees.  The other side was the \\"raw\\" side, including sushi options as well as different connections and small plates made using the sushi-grade seafood.  They also had a pretty extensive drink menu of sake and some beers I had never even heard of.  I ended up trying the Japanese Porter that was delicious and on par with some of my local favorites.  \\n\\nAfter looking at the menu for wayyyy too long I definitely had trouble deciding what to get and decided to get an array of items from either side.  I started with the Himachi truffle and the Ika rollup from the raw side of the menu.  I had heard good things about the Himachi and the Ika roll-up just sounded too interesting not to try.  Both were very good!  The seafood was fresh and the truffle wasn't too overpowering.  The roll-up was like a sushi roll, but instead of rice they stuffed spicy tuna inside squid and fried it, which was different than anything I had tried before but worked really well.  \\n\\nFor the second part of my meal, I got a ginger salad (got to have some vegetables right?) and the honey duck entree which came with a side of stir-fried vegetables and white rice.  The ginger salad was on par with what it is most other places, but I did like that they used a wider variety of lettuce than just plain iceberg.  It made me feel a little more nutritious in my decision.  The duck was cooked perfectly and the honey sauce wasn't overly sweet.  The vegetables were also cooked really well and my wife just about ate them all mentioning how good they were.  \\n\\nI'm really glad I was able to make it out and give this place a try.

She ordered the Florida roll and the Spider roll. The Spider roll had fried soft shell crab in it and it was extremely fresh. We saw them bring out a plate of the fried crab from the kitchen and the sushi chef immediately cut it up and put it in the roll (it was a huge crab, too).\\n\\nWe also ordered the Godzilla roll and the King Kong roll to share. The King Kong roll was our favorite because it's panko fried and has a little bit of spice to it (it has spicy mayo on top and spicy tuna inside), it's the perfect combination of flavors.

Ignoring the sulfur taste, the root beer was very delicious, and had a vanilla flavor to it similar to A&W.\\n\\nOn the burger, the beef was flavorful, and not dry, cooked well throughout, but was a bit on the fatty side, and left a weird film feeling in your mouth. The cheese was standard, nothing special, as were the lettuce and tomato. The bacon, thin crispy what I imagine was pre-cooked.\\n\\nFor dessert we shared a single scoop kit Kat cone.

Parking can be a little challenging. \\n\\nRecommended by our knowledgeable Bostonian friends, we knew we were in for a treat.  At 5pm we were quoted a wait of an hour for a party of eight.  When the last person of our group arrived and checked in with the host about 5 minutes later we were taken right in.  So nice to know a relation of the Godfather.

I wish they had this restaurant in the Tacoma-Seattle area because I would be there all the time!\\n\\nThe service was also friendly and attentive. Even though there was ample sushi on the conveyer belt we were encouraged to order anything else we wished. Typically, when you visit a conveyer belt sushi joint towards the end of the night it's bare pickings and the plates seem old like they've been sitting there a bit, not this place!

The bakery was smaller than I thought it would be with about 4 stools at the window and a big table with 6 chairs. Luckily it wasn't that busy that we were able to get seats at the table. We were shocked at how big their pastries were and how cheap they were! The most expensive thing on their display case was priced at $3.5! Our friend got an apple fritter, my bf got a spicy beef sausage roll and a slice of chocolate bread pudding, and I got a double baked chocolate pain au chocolat. \\n\\nApple Fritter - This was massive! Only priced at $2.50 too! This was delicious! It was tender and fluffy, and it actually had pieces of fresh apples. (4.5/5)\\n\\nSpicy Beef Sausage Roll - This was very tasty! The pastry was flaky and tender. The beef sausage wasn't as spicy as it could of been but it was flavorful enough. It was just the texture of the sausage that I wasn't fond of because it was quite soft and puree-like rather than clumps of meat which I would of preferred. (4/5)\\n\\nChocolate Bread Pudding - Absolutely amazing!! Especially after we requested for it be heated up (I would totally recommend it!). It was so moist and tender, and it had swirls of melted chocolate in between the layers which made it extra gooey and delicious. (5/5)\\n\\nDouble Baked Pain Au Chocolat - Another delicious treat! You could pick the regular pain au chocolat instead but I wanted to try it double baked. Mind you, the double baked version is not for everyone since it was extra crispy. It was so crispy that when you slice through it with a knife, you had to give it some effort and the pastry would just break apart so easily but I didn't mind it (I enjoy eating crunchy food). The pastry was not only crispy but flaky as well. The filling was also very yummy since it had both chocolate bits as well as this creamy almond paste.\\n\\nOverall, staff were super friendly and their pastries were so worth it! The only thing that I didn't like about this place was that their lunch menu and drinks menu had no price labelled on them so you wouldn't know how much they cost unless you ask but that's sometimes a pain in the butt.

King King Roll was so fresh with warm rice and crispy skin, high quality sushi. For the noodle soup, it's spicy with sufficient seafoods and think soup, the best part was with the spicy dry squid, made the whole soup more dynamic and texture. \\n\\nIf you like Japanese food, I will recommend Jade, however there are few things to improve: \\n\\n1. They don't provide Happy Hour Menu until you ask for, it happens to every single table, I believe it's order from owner, try to earn more from the same dish. \\n\\n2. Bring out appetizer and main course at the same time, my roll got cold while I tried hard to enjoy my noodle. \\n\\n3. It may happened just because I got there so early around 5:15pm, I ordered 3 things and they were all not available. \\n\\n4.

The food is tasty, and that's what matters most. They're very quick when it comes to take out too, so you'll never wait more than 15 minutes (in my experience). If you do decide to dine in, they have a fairly large dining room that appears to get pretty busy around lunch time. Hopefully you won't mind the smell of pizza as the Marco's next door permeates the entire restaurant.\\n\\nSo far I've tried the chicken wings (both hot/spicy and the plain), Dan Dan noodles, and the hot and spicy pork ribs. Like everyone else has said, the wings are legit. The chicken wing itself is perfectly crispy, and the meat is very moist and tender enough to enjoy the plain wings on their own. However, the hot and spicy wings with green onions and chili peppers is superior as far as taste goes and if you're looking to make a meal out of them.\\n\\nThe Dan Dan noodles were a little weird to me. First off, it's a full meal, and the flat, white noodles aren't normally what I'm used to when with this dish, and the sauce was a bit too sweet. I know it had minced pork and maybe some scallions, but this was borderline a different dish all together. I took it home though, and honestly, it tasted better cold.\\n\\nMy favorite dish was the hot and spicy pork ribs. They were fried and didn't come with any sauce and weren't at all what I was expecting, but the subtle flavor and spice made them really hard to put down. They probably could have used a little bit of sauce to cut through all of the fried goodness. By the end, they were getting a little dry.\\n\\nBesides a small Chinese menu that I'm looking to make my way through, this spot has all of the usual American favorites. There's really not a whole lot of authentic Chinese places in this part of town so having this option is pretty great, and I'm happy to have it.

My wife and I were excited to check it out, so we walked in and put our name on the long list. We took a seat on an old couch, staring at 7 open seats at the bar. When we asked if we could just sit there, they said they only seat it in order of the list. OK, so why is no one sitting there while a bunch of us are waiting for a table? So we still had to wait. We looked at the menu and drinks in the entry/bar area, and tried to order a coffee while we waited. They told us we could order, but we had to pay for it there, and that it wouldn't transfer to our meal tab, even though their set menu would also later include coffee. So I have to pay twice for coffee if I also want some while I wait for a table while staring at empty seats? \\n\\nAfter 45 minutes our table was nearing ready, and the host came out, took our order in advance, and asked us if we were OK with a 'community table.' We said yes, and when he took us to it, it was literally a small 4-top table where we'd be awkwardly seated directly across from another couple. That's not a community table. So we waited a little longer for an actual table of our own (while the bar was still empty).\\n\\nBy the time we sat down, out food arrived shortly after, having already been ordered. I appreciated that they got it in the kitchen early. If you aren't familiar, they have a semi-prix fixe menu where you can choose one of 4 drinks, one of 4 savory dishes, and one of ~4 sweet dishes, all for $22 plus a $4 service charge in place of tip. I don't mind the menu setup, but my issue was that everything was way too sweet, and just more food than I needed. My wife and I ordered all different items so we were able to taste a lot of the options. The biscuits and gravy were good, some of the best gravy I've had, but it included maple syrup (even tho it was a 'savory dish'), so by the time I got to the sweet dish, I just couldn't. I don't care for sweets for breakfast to begin with cause the mid-morning crash from the sugar rush isn't worth it. If I were still 10 years old, I may feel different about Hunnymilk. Ended up taking most of the fortune cookie waffle home with me and throwing it in the trash. My wife's savory potato hash was mostly just giant chunks of potato, and her crepe was ok, but who the heck wants white chocolate with it for breakfast. \\nAll in all, neither of us are eager to go back. May stop in to try the snacks at the bar and skip the wait and leftovers. The portion sizes were large, and frankly more than either of us needed, but of course they don't let you share plates. I will say I appreciated the sound system, which played good music and had a nice full sound."},{"name":"Life of Pie Pizza","address":"3632 N Williams Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"This would have to be one of the worst dine-in pizza experiences I've had since I was 17 and went to a Pizza Hut in Montana where our meal was interrupted by a rat! The inside is fairly spacious. Probably about 15 small sized tables they can put together to form bigger tables. The atmosphere is LOUD. Hard to hear each other. I entered the restaurant around 5:40pm on a Thursday. It was fairly busy- the tables and bar area was filled. We placed our order at the counter, was given a number and was told they'd grab a table for us as soon as they had one. Only had to wait about 5-10 minutes to get a table- Not bad! The worst part was we didn't even see our food until 6:50pm. Over an hour from when we ordered the food. No one checked in on us during this time ether. When our food was delivered, a waitress came by to check if we were enjoying our food. By the time I was on my second slice, another waitress came by (I figured this was a manager who would apologize for the delay, I was wrong) told us to move to another table so they could make room for a larger party, WHILE WE WERE IN THE MIDDLE OF EATING! are you kidding me? You had a whole hour to move us to a different table and decided to wait until we had begun to eat our pizza? Awful customer experience. No apologizes. It seemed like this place was run by a bunch of 20/30 year olds who just wanna make pizza and collect tips...probably why they want you to tip at the beginning. The pizza itself was actually fairly good. Unfortunately our dine in experience was so poor we probably weren't able to fully enjoy the pizza. Don't dine in.

I don't usually give out 5 stars after one visit, but this is definitely a 4+ establishment doing some really lovely things in the kitchen. \\nThe space itself is quite small, but it is set up with some creative imaginings. Mostly bar stools and high tops/ chairs, with a few large booths in the back. It definitely reminds me more of a bar + food rather than a full eatery. I see the area outside has space for a summer expansion, at which point I hope they also expand to brunch, because daaaaaamn those biscuits were good. \\nButchery and pork are clearly the chef's strong suit, so I am unclear why a fellow Yelper labeled this establishment \\"seafood\\". They have fish, but it seems like you would almost be missing the point to order it. We shared the pork platter special, biscuits with siracha maple butter, and brussel sprouts cooked in duck fat with bacon. With the pork platter you get to try all different parts of the pig from the cheek meat to classic NC style (vinegar based) pulled pork, to pork meatballs, to cracklings. The highlights for me were the meatballs and the pork chop with apples. Both were perfectly cooked and gorgeously presented. \\nService was also great - the waitress was very present, but not stalkerish, and was educated on the offerings. She explained how they use heritage meat, which, to me, has a higher quality taste. It's particularly important to use the better meats when you are using the odd bits. Beer was served in fun beer-can shaped glasses. The waitress asked us what our favorites were as they were still adjusting the menu. Our advice: ALWAYS KEEP THE MEATBALLS. (This is life advice, really.) \\nI did not enjoy: how the cold air rushed in as people entered and left and the pork belly square (too tough to cut with the utensils given). \\nI will be back to try lunch at some point, and again, I do hope they try a seasonal brunch during the summer.

The squid was spicy and delicious and came out in a large portion.  The fried dumplings came out piping hot from the oven and was served with a small plate of soy sauce.  The Bulgogi smelled nice and sweet as we cooked it on the grill. The cuts are nice and thin so it really doesn't take long.  We each got a little pot of rice in addition to the many sides they brought out (Kimchi, eggplant, pickled radish, potato, etc).  It truly was a feast and I was able to wash it all down with a few bottles of Hite Korean beer.  Very mild in strength and as another reviewer put it, it doesn't seem too far from Budlight.  The service was friendly, attentive (coming and tending to the meat if they thought it needed turning. Asking us if we needed more rice or lettuce, etc.) and just overall welcoming.

I remember Brazilian pizza being explained as thin, less saucy, and having more diverse toppings - which certainly sounds appealing to me.   So I was understandably excited when I learned that a Brazilian pizzeria had opened not far from where I live.  \\n\\nWhen we entered there was no one to greet us at the door and no signage that said \\"Seat Yourself,\\" but after a few moments we made an executive decision to select a table and sit down.  A server passed us on our way to visit another table, and said that he'd be with us shortly.  We waited for a number of minutes, and just as we were discussing leaving to find somewhere new, the server finally came with menus.  The menus were cute - large circles in the shape of a pizza, with each wedge focusing on another category (chicken, meat, veggie, etc.)  The chicken with sweet corn caught my eye, my mom ended up with a salad, and both my dad and boyfriend ended up with different types of sausage pizzas.  When the pizzas finally arrived, I was underwhelmed to say the least.  While the crust was a great texture, the toppings left a lot to be desired.  The chicken atop the pie was so incredibly dry, and I had to wonder if it came from a can based off of the texture and flavor.  The corn was a nice addition, but the abundance of dried out chicken really made the pizza hard to eat.  I ended up scraping all of the chicken off, which subsequently pulled the cheese off.  Very disappointing.  The consensus around the table was just as disappointing; my mom's salad had canned fruit, and the onions on the sausage pizza were raw (this may be traditional, just not our thing).  \\n\\nIn summary, I went home hungry - so this is not a place I'll be coming back to; though I think I'd like to give Brazilian pizza a try at another establishment (perhaps one of the more trusted locations on I Drive with higher Yelp ratings)."},{"name":"Gilaneh Grill House","address":"222 Pemberton Avenue","city":"North Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"Probably the worst Persian restaurant i have ever been too.

The frutti di mare had clams, mussels, calamari and shrimp is a more tomato based sauce. It was also delicious and saucy. The rollati di pasta came out super hot and very cheesy as well.

A cop on foot gave out several tickets in front of me. \\n\\nMy daughter and I had no reservations but tried by calling a few hours before and was shot down. We knew that we wanted to eat on the North End so we gave it a shot. The menu is posted outside.

He agreed to put my name on the cancellation list and took my cell. \\n\\nMy daughter and I killed time and walked over to Mike's Pastry and took in the sights of the area. Lots of people watching as the restaurants were all full on a Thursday around 630. The area seemed safe and overall clean. All of the properties were occupied and neat in appearance.\\n\\nIn around 15 minutes I got a text to return. After doing so it took another 5 minutes and I got a high top table for four. The place is very small, maybe seating up to 40 max. The street side tables are open air, so if nice weather your practically eating outside. \\n\\nA waitress got waters out and said bread would be coming. The menu is pretty small, wine list is not huge but a respectable mix. I found an Italian by the glass that was pretty good. Orders taken and I decided on the gnocchi. The waitress said the kitchen could comply with my daughters request for butter noodles with chicken. At this point it had been over 10 minutes and no bread and just when ready to ask it came warm with butter and was pretty good.\\n\\nThe meals were out  relatively quick in less than 20 minutes and piping hot. My gnocchi was excellent and huge with sauce being a highlight. My daughter noodles and chicken was equally large and she enjoyed but could not hardly put a dent in it. A quick check-in was performed. Water refills were slow and at one point mine dropped to empty. \\n\\nThe prices are exceptional for the quality and portion size. I would love to return.

There's also a dinner set promo also due to expire at the end of May, but which includes one main course, one appetizer, and the house salad, but for $15.12 from 6:00PM-9:30PM.  I hope they consider extending it, particularly the lunch set, since their all day menu pricing is a bit high for lunch - think $10.12 for a vegetable pad thai a la carte.\\n\\nTwelve Hours has the corner spot where Oak Square Ave meets Washington Street.  The stretch in front is a bus stop - don't park there.  I lucked out and managed to find street parking just on the next block over.\\n\\nThey are friendly, but service is kept at a minimum, and No Tip was pre-selected for me before the pad was presented for my signature.  Ordering is done at the counter.  Grab your own silverware and napkins at the edge of the counter.  Food is delivered to your table, but you bust your own table before you exit.  The trash and bins for the plates 'n stuff is located beneath the television.\\n\\nTheir house salad was snazzed up with 3 pineapple chunks.  The dressing was flavorful.  The rest was basic, being lettuce, a grape tomato, and raw red onion.  The red onion was a bit on the strong side, and went up my nose (not literally), so I tried to hamper it some with higher ratios of everything else in each bite.\\n\\nOur main courses were a bit slow in coming - an apology was extended by the one who took our order, since she noticed it as well.  This we appreciated, and the plates arrived shortly after, with the carb of choice in portions larger than expected.  Mine was the Korean Noodle (Stir-fried Korean style clear big vermicelli noodle with mushroom, broccoli, green bean, carrot, onion, cabbage, red pepper, and egg in sesame sauce) which I ordered with crispy chicken.  Sure, they prepared it with their crispy fish, but as soon as I let them know of the error, they asked the kitchen to make up the missing crispy chicken for me.\\n\\nThe crispy fish came in squares of fried fish.  One DC received 2 squares of fried fish as ordered, while my pieces were smaller and came as a count of 3.  They were nicely crispy on the outside yet moist and tender within - not the freezer fish sticks of childhood!  The chicken was one large piece fried with a crispy crust and sliced.  Thin tender chicken hid within.  Ironically, I ended up preferring the fish.\\n\\nMy Korean Noodle resembled Jap Chae visually, but not in flavor profile.  It was still tasty, but I prefer Jap Chae.  The veggies were cooked well, retaining proper bite.  Another DC ordered vegetarian and found the tofu to be hard and dry, so I was glad that I had gone the way of the meat.  I sampled the Crispy Wonton Pad Thai off another's plate and found it light and crispy indeed (though probably not a good candidate for leftovers), but rather sweet and the portion a bit lighter than the other two entrees at the table.\\n\\nFor my two appetizers, I picked the Crab Blueberry Rangoon (6 pcs $6.12) Homemade wonton filled with crabmeat, cream cheese, and blueberry, which came as 3 pieces of savory-sweet creamy blueberry wrapped in hot crisp skins, and Sweet Potato french fries (V) ($6.12) which were lightly crisp and sweet.  Good choices both.\\n\\nIf you're lucky, as you make your way out, you'll hear the sweet chirping of \\"Thank you!\\" from a little pint sized cutie pie hostess who is gunning for a future in hospitality.\\n\\nI left with a full belly and a snack for later.\\n\\n*** 7/2016 ***\\n\\nThey've extended their Happy Hour Special through August!\\n\\nI came for take-out before lunch ended, and got the SN3. Udon Garlic (Stir-fried udon noodle with mushroom, broccoli, green bean, carrot, onion, cabbage, red pepper, and egg in garlic sauce) with duck, with the Crab Blueberry Rangoon and Seaweed Salad.  I liked how it came in a compartmented container.  A whole bunch of yum for $10.12, with some left over for later.\\n\\n*** 5/2018 *** \\n\\nLunch Specials still going strong!  Yay!\\n\\nI think they've changed up their appetizer options somewhat since my last visit a couple of years ago.  I opted for the Crab Blueberry Rangoon and Shrimp Toast, Iced Taro for the drink, and Tofu Falls Ramen $10.12 Lunch Special.\\n\\nI still enjoy their snazzed up salad.  The Iced Taro was good.  I may switch out of the Crab Blueberry Rangoon next time - since it was no longer so special since I've now had it a few times, but the shrimp toast was good!  The ramen had well cooked vegetables (in that they were not overcooked), but perhaps I would ask them to serve the seaweed and crisps on the side in the future, and have the meat variation or something else."},{"name":"Moorish Medicine","address":"2440 Wesley Chapel Rd","city":"Decatur","stars":"4","text":"Just an update from my first review.

I never went when it was a trailer, so this is just about the new brick and mortar building. I had dinner there with two friends on a Saturday in late June. The hostess seemed confused when I asked if they could seat 3 and it took her long enough to get back to me that I said I'd run to the ladies room while she looked through her lists. The restaurant never filled up while we were there, so I'm not sure what the confusion was.\\n\\nAfter being seated, our waitress was perfectly nice, but didn't know how certain ingredients on the menu tasted nor had she tried the special, which should have been a warning sign. I ordered a La Fresa cocktail only to have her return and say they were out of it, which seemed odd as it was early still-around 7pm. So I ordered the Brass Knuckles which I thought I might like instead. It was drinkable, but unexceptional. The Guacamole Tradicional appetizer we shared was good. \\n\\nI ordered the Pipi√°n Verde Al Estilo de Puebla after asking our server about it. She described it as \\"delicate\\" and having had excellent pipi√°n mole before, I thought I would like it. (I in no way expected the usual highly-spiced red mole poblano. I've had pipi√°n mole before and loved it.) When it arrived, it looked extremely simple--white rice, shrimp and green sauce on a plate-and after 2 bites I realized it was incredibly bland. The mole tasted like pumpkin seeds and water blended together with no other seasoning whatsoever. I couldn't detect salt, epazote, garlic, tomatillo or anything. I asked my fellow diners to try it and they agreed it was unacceptable, so I felt OK sending it back. \\n\\nWhen I told our server about it, she said that she really needed to find a word to use other than delicate to describe the dish, and implied it was probably my \\"palate\\". It seemed strange to put the blame for bland food on the diner, but I let it go and ordered the Cochinita Pibil instead. The manager came out, ostensibly to apologize, but instead went on about how \\"delicate\\" and \\"authentic\\" the pipi√°n mole dish is and how some people don't have a sophisticated enough palate to appreciate it. Again with that word! One of my friends asked the manager if he had tried the dish and he said he had. He then asked him if he had tried it that day and he said no. My friend gently suggested he should do so and that maybe they needed time to work out some kinks. There's nothing wrong with our palates, I enjoy a wide range of flavors from all over the world and can appreciate delicacy done right. \\n\\nI've never been treated so condescendingly as a diner. Even if it WAS some coincidental dysfunction of three fairly sophisticated eaters' and cooks' palates, it shouldn't be such an ordeal to send back an order. I have only ever sent back an order in extreme circumstances and if I genuinely have a problem with it, which is why I drank my unexceptional cocktail. More than the bland dish, I feel that El Naranjo needs to rethink their approach to customer service. They could easily have turned the situation around and made me a happy, loyal customer. They chose to insult me instead.

The slicing person gave him two fat pieces of beef ribs which could not have been 2 lbs, so miscommunication on that front I guess? She probably didn't hear him, but who the hell orders 4 lbs of beef ribs for themselves? So she took one of the ribs away and the one he was left with was approximately 2 lbs.\\n\\nThen I came up and asked for a beef rib that was 1-1.5 lbs, ya know, because I can only eat so much. This person then takes the rib that my friend didn't buy before and gives it to me, telling me it's 2 lbs. I'm then like, \\"um, are there no smaller ribs...\\" to which she then proceeds to tell me \\"yeah usually our beef ribs are 1-1.5 lbs. That's just how they are.\\" \\n\\nI then look at her with a confused af face because she literally just told me exactly what I wanted to hear in terms of what I ordered, and yet she's standing there with the 2 lb rib that I obviously do not freaking want.\\n\\nAt that point I was pretty sure there was something wrong with this girl...

Sit down. Prepare to eat. I really loved the beef rib before and highly recommended it... to the point where I convinced my friend to get it too... but to our dismay, the rib was 75% fat.\\n\\nImagine how frustrated we were when I was raving about it so much before, in my previous picture it looks at least 80-85% meat, but today it was just..garbage. It was so fatty that I could barely eat it, and my stomach was off the wall the rest of the day.\\n\\nI honestly felt so gipped out of my money. I paid so much just got inedible trash.

The first one received his drumstick but our friend that showed up at around 5:15-20 was told they had already sold out. I liked around the  establishment and concluded that they probably make/sell about 20-24 before they reach their limit for an evening so if you want the $1 chicken drum you better be there early and order it first thing!  The only complaint I have is that it's just a lol pricey, I suggest definitely going for happy hour between 5-7 it's $2 dollars off cocktails ( I suggest the mule with the pear -yum) normally $9 and some sort of discount on their bar snacks!

Unmemorable, malnourished MIDGET calamari rings sitting in a bed of fried banana peppers. The dish was probably 40% banana peppers, now that I think about it. Came served with a hot side of marinara sauce, which was actually one of the highlights of the evening. \\n\\nScallop and shrimp entree - $22.99 with an extra $3 charge for angel hair pasta that the waitress basically forced upon me without telling me of the extra $3 surcharge (to switch to anything else other than linguini or penne). I am actually FURIOUS about how obscenely charged I was for this terrible dish. Basically, you have a random smattering of WAY overcooked vegetables (think: lies limp on a fork) 3 bites of broccoli, 3 stems of soggy asparagus and a few slices of zucchini. On top of a terribly cooked bed of angel hair pasta that was CLEARLY not freshly prepared as it sat in one major CLUMP on my plate. The 3 scallops and 3 grilled shrimps were way overcooked to the point where they were rubbery. No flavor had been infused into the seafood and it just felt like I was eating rubber bands.

Plus, it's easy to do so on Yelp. \\n\\nAnyways, we were seated in a little corner which kind of sucked. We didn't really get any attention and our waitress seemed to forget things like a request for additional bread and whatnot. The bread was nice, toasty on the outside, soft and fluffy on the inside.

After reading how much everyone loved the dishes - they just seemed to fall flat for me. The pasta here is likely homemade - but it's THICK. While I appreciate the fresh pasta, it did seem a bit \\"doughy\\", likely due to its thickness. Nothing really stood out to me about these dishes. I was expecting the alfredo to have some crazy flavors (as par with the name), but it was just simple alfredo with minor kicks of spicy here and there. \\n\\nThe Sunday macaroni was huge - I mean, it was 29 bucks. But it also wasn't very wowing. The braised beef rib was dry and tasted overcooked. The meatballs were decent, although some were also dry and overcooked as well.

The meat was amazing and the sauce that they had at the tables made it even better. The ribs were my favorite part. The meat literally fell off of the bone. The beans were great.

My experience here certainly ranks among the lowest I've ever had at any restaurant. If I was more bold a person I would have sent my entire meal back to the kitchen and simply left. \\n\\nThe Food\\nI ordered the Stuffed Center Cut Pork Rib Chop with a side dish of Sauted Rapi Greens and Chicken.\\nThe pork certainly had an impressive presentation but it turned out that was about all that was right about this dish. The meat comes atop veggies (which wasn't mentioned on the menu and why i thought to order a side) with the sauce poured over the top. Had this dish been properly cooked the flavor combinations would have probably been quite nice but unfortunately it wasn't. The pork itself was way too salty and cooked to the point of being nearly over cooked. Meanwhile, the veggies underneath which included things like brussel sprouts and carrots were all undercooked, super stiff and too chewy. \\nThe problems with the main dish were dwarfed by the overwhelming failure that was the side of greens and chicken. My seat at the bar gave me a front row seat to the kitchen and I watched this dish become a failure before it even hit the plate. The greens were completely unseasoned and thrown in a pan with some water to 'saut√©' (The owners need to look up the definition of that word) and the chicken was thrown in some time later also completely bland and unseasoned. The resultant dish presented was completely void of taste, most notably the water bath cooked chicken, and sitting in a pool of water on the plate. At $9, this is one of the biggest rip offs I've ever seen. \\n\\nThe Service\\nA complete embarrassment. \\nThis place is extremely small and had two waitresses yet the service felt like I was nearly forgotten most of the night despite being in plain view of the kitchen and serving station. After being seated it took far too long for the waitress to even check in and ask for the order. After being served it again too far too long before the _only_ check in while food was being eaten to see if anything was needed. During the entire visit I did not receive so much as a top off for my glass of water yet I watched from my seat as one of the waitresses literally her entire pasta dinner standing at the service station. I get it, everyone needs to eat, but if you're going to take a break then get someone else to handle your tables. It's called 'waiting' tables for a reason, if you're just going to carry my food from the serving table and make me flag you down for even the most basic of needs then I'll just go eat at the servicing station with you and forego wasting money on a tip. \\n\\nThe Kitchen\\nSince I was seated at the bar I was treated to a front row seat of the open kitchen. In addition to seeing the terrible preparation of my side mentioned above I also witnessed a few questionable activities. On different occasions I watched both cooks check their cell phones while still wearing their gloves and also watched one cook use the same tongs he used for food to adjust the knobs for the burners. Near the end of my meal I watched a cook chop up greens on a surface he had been resting pans on all night when adding ingredients and which was lightly blackened from the pans. \\n\\nWhy 1 star?\\nSome nights service can be off, some nights the cooks can be off but when this happens on the same night it means management has no idea what's happening in their own house. I'm 100% confident that no one is watching/tasting the food coming out of the kitchen or watching the staff wait tables because it wasn't until the maitre d' saw this 1 star review being written while still at the bar did he bother to check in and ask how things were. Nothing else tipped him off, not the long empty water glass or the constant picking and poking at bland uneaten chicken. The threat of 1 star on the screen is what caught his eye. His attitude was that of 'you should have told us so we could make it right' but honestly what could have been done? Do I wait another 20 minutes for less salty pork or wait for more greens and  unmarinated chicken sitting in water to arrive? I was hungry, I suffered through so I could get the hell out of there. This is a far from authentic Italian, I've eaten all over Italy and this would fall into the tourist trap category at best. It seems to fall into it even in Boston."},{"name":"la Barbecue","address":"2027 E Cesar Chavez St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Yessss! I would love to come back for more BBQ!

Cookie on top was delicious, frosting was rich but not diabetic sweet, and the chocolate cupcake base was light and moist. Perfection. \\n\\nMac & Cheese: fresh out of the oven, so very hot (perfect for this cold day). Flavors were nice and the textures were even better. Bread crumb topping was an excellent pairing. It came out right after I finished my first cupcake. \\n\\nSelf-serve water: chilled, but no ice (my personal favorite way to drink water), and tastes way better than local tap water, so it's at least filtered. Good sign for their baking ingredients, too. \\n\\nLemon Blackberry Poppyseed: OMG this cupcake was even better than the first, and I expected to have less interest after filling up on the previous two items. I think it's some kind of cream cheese icing, and every bit of it melted in my mouth. The tiny bits of crunch inside were a pleasant surprise. The lemon base flavor gave just enough tang to carry the sweetness to a level like some kind of drug.\\n\\nBuster Bar: my go-to with candy is pretty much anything with chocolate and peanuts/peanut butter, so I had to get this. It's basically a giant Reese's cup, but more decadent. Firmer on bottom, super soft in middle, and an almost fudge-like chocolate on top. Classic goodness. \\n\\nAtmosphere: quiet music, warm (not too hot), homey feel, and well lit but not fluorescent bright. \\n\\nPrice: I paid $20 for all of the above, tax and tip included. \\n\\nConclusion: I'm coming back for a lemon blackberry, and writing maybe my sixth review ever after several years of using this app. Vegan AND gluten-free?!

If you order on app you get the lamb plus the rice for one price, in the restaurant I ordered the same  and they charged a dollar more (no I didn't get more then the Uber price) and it's just the meat no rice, so 2.99 is added for rice and it's basically the same amount you get through the app of the included meal."},{"name":"Helen Asian Kitchen","address":"1070 E Dublin Granville Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"Visiting for business and tried out Helen's Asian Kitchen.

If you arrive here 5 minutes before the plane opens, there will be a few people line outside the door. If you come here 30 minutes after they open, the line will have quadrupled in size. If these numbers say anything, it means you will have to wait. I had to wait about an hour from the moment I arrived to the moment I sat down to eat. But once I had my food, it was a beautiful sight to behold and taste. \\n\\nThe sausage was not the best I've had, but the composition of flavor was worthy of fine dining. I don't personally like chipotle heavy flavors, so I was hesitant to order this. I'm glad I did, as a story unfolded in my mouth with each bite. What it lacked in texture, it made up for flavor profile. With every bite, the spice shined like the sun over the river of porky grease, flowing through the streams of my veins. The casing was the ONLY thing I could complain about, as the full bodied flavor of pork and spice lubed my happy belly.\\n\\nThe pulled pork took me by total surprise. I wasn't really sure what to expect, as I saw no textured bark or real structure. The pork was well pronounced, the moisture¬†level was consistent with every single bite, and the sweetness factor was Mild yet detectable. I imagine it makes for a great sandwich at this place.¬†\\n\\nThe pork rib was an absolute masterpiece. It transcends any expectation on what you may have. I was able to eat it with a fork, yet at no point would I say this is fall off the bone. I'm not sure their exact method with smoking the ribs but it seems like it harder since the best of both worlds when using or not using foil. The glaze on top was sweet, in the realm of an orange and hoisin sauce, yet never was it out of control or in the forefront. If you were going to order anything, make sure you get this.¬†\\n\\nThe brisket was my least favorite, although I'm not sure if I had the best cut that they could have offered. It was never dry, but for being marbled brisket, it could've been more moist. It definitely had a peppery beef taste. The one thing that impressed me the most was the smoke ring and the bark. The bark was consistent,  and all-around tightly packed like cement on brick work. It's truly a artwork of technique and craft on the bark alone.¬†\\n\\nLeann Mueller not only knows what she's doing, but pulls it off with grace and finess.

It's not remotely like anything in Vegas if that's what you think it's like. This is shit for backwards Midwesterners. It has ridiculous prices so that part's the same at least. The slots all seem pretty boring and there's an annoying system for playing them. \\n\\nIf you like to gamble you may come here anyway. It's not in a good area of Columbus, but this is getting much better. The slot machines are kind of annoying for me. It's not like you come into the casino, then sit at a slot and put money into it. What you have to do instead is to get something called a club card to use any of the machines. It may not seem like much of a hassle just to get a card at the front. That's before you consider the need to interact with the staff, who if you're able to find them are usually assholes or fucking idiots. It has several dining choices. The only good thing about that is the number of choices, because the food is a rip off. A drink at the bar is usually at least $7 even at the lame happy hour. They have watered down $10 cocktails like they think it's Vegas but the cost is the only thing they're imitating. Its most popular dining option is probably the Epic Buffet. One good thing is they have lots of food. The price is certainly epic, often costing more than $18 most days and more than $25 on some holidays or any time they have an excuse to say it's a special time. If you're looking for a buffet you have some better options. There's a few buffets with better selection and a fraction of its price. It has an Asian restaurant called Zen Noodle, where each entree is at least $12, the fuck? This is even for the pretty small portion of tofu and vegetables. If you're hungry go to one of the cheap Chinese restaurants on Broad Street. The quality is about the same. \\n\\nWhen I feel like gambling I would rather go to any of the sketchy gaming halls than Hollywood Casino. Its lame for a casino and the staff sucks. The only authentic thing about it is you're able to spend all your money on lame games like these."},{"name":"Carmelina's","address":"307 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Fantastic!

My colleagues stated that they had healthy options, the food is tasty, and it's a locally black-owned business. So of course I was sold. \\n\\nPrior to arriving I didn't have any preconceived notion about the restaurant I just went. To my surprise the store front was actually pretty inviting. The restaurant is located at the end of an old shopping plaza and the signage is clean and legible. Nice introduction to a new place. As you walk in there are various size tables, so you can either take the food to go or eat it there. There is no large menu to view, however, around the cash register/counter top their are plenty of menus to look at. There are to go menus and the dine in menus. All employees were extremely nice and patient as I stood oogling the menu. \\n\\nI decided to build your own smoothie (which I advise you to take a look at the menu before you go, as to not look like a complete fool... like I did. lol) and the Salmon Spinach Salad. \\n\\n*Beverage: Build your own smoothie ($6.00)\\nTo build your own smoothie you take a laminated card, a dry erase marker, and some time to check off the items you want in your smoothie. I built my smoothie with an almond milk base, mangoes, pineapples, oranges, sweet potato (compliments of one of their employees), ginger, and honey as the sweetener. I decided to forego the protein, just because I already had my fair share of protein for the day. As the employees prepared my smoothie I was able to peek over the counter top to watch as she prepared my beverage. When the young lady was done she poured a small portion of each of our drinks into a sample cup and asked us if we liked the flavor. This was especially special to me, because at that point you can continue customizing the drink if it is not to your liking. Very unique to their restaurant, and must I say I tasted all of the freshness in this drink, Amazing!\\n\\n*Entree: Salmon Spinach Salad($10.00)\\nThe Salmon came on top of a bed of spinach, pecan, strawberries, and cranberries. This salad was very hardy and filling that I didn't even get a chance to take a picture (rookie mistake). Nonetheless, the flavor of the Salmon alone had me excited. It wasn't the typical bourbon, salt and pepper, or lemon flavored Salmon... it was curried. Surprising but delicious. I couldn't stop eating once I started. \\n\\nOverall this restaurant deserves an A. The employees were a delight, the freshness of the ingredients were appreciated, the build your own drink was fun and a good opportunity for people of various walks of life, the smoothie sampler was thoughtful, and the price point was expected for great ingredients. Pitfalls, their is no overhead menu, but this isn't really a problem because the paper and laminated menus are easy to read."},{"name":"Pizza Caboose","address":"11670 SW Pacific Hwy","city":"Tigard","stars":"4","text":"This is our favorite place for pizza.

Rosa Mexicano has balls in that department, let me tell you, because they don't assume you're weak.

It came with a side of creamed corn and I requested that they chop up some habaneros as an additional topping because the dish is not that hot.  Our efficient waiter, an utter professional, recognized that this was not a huge ask and indulged my soon-to-be-gutted ass.\\n\\nThe beef is really good but there always seems to be a few more dimensions of flavor you could add to it, even if it means making the braising liquid more saucy.  I wouldn't mind the sauce running down my wrist like emo blood.  Tacos are supposed to be juicy and messy.  Figure out a way to make it bolder and this is a 5-star dish.  \\n\\nBut that is such a minor criticism, especially in light of the perfection that was Miss K's shrimp and rice dish with the salsa verde.  Not sure whether you want a main dish or tacos?  Order both.

I've been here a few times years ago, and just recently on Monday evening. Some items are better than others, but overall, you're better off going elsewhere if you want good soul food. \\n\\nThis week was the first time I've been there and haven't had to wait. We came on a Monday night around 8:30, so that was a pleasant surprise. There are plenty of times when I drive past and see a crowd of people waiting outside. \\n\\nI ordered a chicken breast a la carte, along with sides of fried corn and yams. My SO ordered the smothered chicken with mac & cheese and collards. We also ordered the fried green tomatoes to start, and a waffle to share. Here is a breakdown of the meal:\\n\\nFried green tomatoes: Pretty good. Not greasy. Well-seasoned, although the flavor of the tomato got a little lost. \\n\\nFried chicken: Okay, our food came out suspiciously fast. A taste of the chicken confirmed that it'd been sitting around for a while. It was dry and a bit chewy. Flavor was okay, nothing out of this world. \\n\\nSmothered chicken: My SO said it was only okay. I didn't try his chicken (which is boneless breast meat), but did sample the gravy and rice it comes with. The gravy was missing something...it was a bit bland. The rice was even more bland (blander?). \\n\\nFried corn: Ummm there was nothing fried about it. It looked and tasted like heated canned corn with chopped bell peppers thrown in. I mean, I love corn so I ate that mess up anyway, but really. \\n\\nYams: Not sure if they used some exotic spice I've never heard of or tasted, but it smelled and tasted a bit like Pine-Sol. \\n\\nCollards: A-okay. Not great, not bad. \\n\\nMac & cheese: A good amount of cheesy flavor. Not overly creamy. \\n\\nWaffle: Also good. Nothing exceptional, though. I found myself using some of the syrup to dip my chicken into. \\n\\nService was friendly all around. Our server was attentive without being overbearing. The lack of alcohol here kept our bill in check. There is free parking off Courtland, directly behind the restaurant. The lot is tiny, but I've always managed to find a spot. It's also worth noting simply because it's free parking downtown. \\n\\nBottom line: The only reason you should end up here is if you're entertaining an out-of-towner who insists on the tourist traps."},{"name":"Pancake Social","address":"675 Ponce De Leon Ave NE, Ste 185","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Very Disappointed!I was told at first the wait was 45 minutes.

As I am being seated I notice that 1/3 of the tables in the restaurant are empty. I wish I could say the experience got better but it didn't.   It took 45 minutes to receive my food which I was surprised because other customers who were seated after me received their food first.

With a self-imposed bougie beer background after living in San Diego, I can proudly say that Spokesman has done a great job curating their beer selection and music overhead--might I add. All of the beertenders are knowledgeable and can direct you to the right beer or coffee for you. I'm not a coffee drinker, so I'm no use for those interested in the coffee aspect.\\n\\nI enjoyed my Electric Jellyfish IPA (Pinthouse Pizza) and forgot what other IPA I got previously--but that's OK because their list rotates all the time. I also love the cheezy goodness of their well-made grilled cheese. It also comes with a sundried tomato pesto spread--watch out for my nut allergy folks! The dill pickle and veggies that come on the side are a wonderful little addition to the order. They also have pastries and small salads too if you don't want something like a sandwich.

We ordered our drinks as we waited for our friends to arrive. We had made a reservation, but seating looked not to be a problem, even though it was a Friday night. I ordered a gin cocktail, the Saint, which included a whole bunch of bubbles and some St Germain and St George gin. The sprouts gave it some color, but didn't do much in terms of flavor, so seemed a little unnecessary.

They didn't get them for so long, that the server comped our dessert and the hush puppies we ordered for appetizers. Speaking of which... Food...\\n\\nBeing the good Asians we were, we went family style. We ordered a bunch of appetizers and three entrees to share among the four of us:\\n\\nSnacks and Starters - \\nParkerhouse rolls: I'm a huge white bread enthusiast, especially if complimentary. Unfortunately, we had to order these off the menu, but we got 5 rolls per order and they were hot and buttery, although more butter was also provided. \\nBlue Crab Hushpuppies: whoa. Not expected. Wasn't too much like a hush puppy to me, other than the shape, but each puppy was chock full of crab. The accompanying green goddess was tasty, but the hush puppy stood well on its own.\\nPan Roasted Mussels: OMG so good. The soup was rich and with an amazing kick of spicy. I could have dipped that bread roll in it all day (which was the reason we put in a second order of bread). Of course, the mussels and bread themselves were great, but I won't ever be able to stop raving over the mussels juices.\\nSides - \\nRosemary Elote: the hype is real. This corn is riDICULOUS. The ginger kick is a little overbearing but tasty nonetheless. Would definitely order again when I come back to visit. \\nMains - \\nSmoked and Braised Pork Shank: not bad - flavors were on point. Reminded me slightly of a Christmas ham. A tasty Christmas ham, of course, but we REALLY got it because it was on top of a bed of mushroom risotto. And THAT, was beautiful. \\nPork Chop: this wasn't bad, but was my least favorite of the three entrees. It was just ok. Harder to share since it was one large chop. I did appreciate the seeded mustard on top, though.\\nRibeye: the best entree of the night, all 10 oz of it. The farro was even better than the mushroom risotto because of its lightness in consistency. A must order, even though it is pricier than the other entrees. Definitely worth it, though!\\nDessert -\\nPopcorn Ice Cream: maybe my tastebuds became numb after all those amazing flavors from dinner, but I couldn't really taste the popcorn. But it was salty and sweet and delicious! And the chunks of blondie? Yes please! Yay for complimentary desserts!\\n\\nAt the end of our meal, Tiffany M. offered us 10% off coupons, as we identified ourselves as \\"locals\\" to the Atlanta area.

Both dishes were cold and tasted really bad. We both grew up with asian food and the Nasi Goreng was by far the worst I have had. There was no salt in the dish and so no flavor, the meat in it was hard. If you want flavorful food from that region there are many great restaurants in Atlanta.

Duck fat fries are better, especially with a runny egg and accompanying sauce. While this is my first experience with Duck Fat Fries, they were good, but not out of this world. Maybe in my mind, I expected them to taste like Truffle Fries, but they weren't as flavorful. Still good and you should still try them.\\n\\nCrispy Brussel Sprout Leaves- As the name suggests it's just the leave. The flavor was perfection, but don't expect there to be enough substance (or density) to alleviate any hunger. Try it, but one cannot survive on Brussel sprout leaves alone ;)\\n\\nPork Belly Taco- It's a decent sized taco, but a $5 taco (on happy hour) feels a little steep. I would still recommend it for flavor, however, you'll find better value in other things.\\n\\nEggplant Fries- Don't do it. They look really good but are severely lacking in flavor and even saltiness. The tomato sauce was ok, but being as bland as they were, they probably needed a richer, thicker sauce to balance the flavor. Either way, this was the only dish we did not finish.\\n\\nIn addition to the appetizers, we also enjoyed Creme Brulee which was good. Nothing particularly unique about it, but a familiar taste for those who enjoy the dessert.\\n\\nService was fantastic; friendly, water glasses always full, and the appropriate amount of \\"check-ins\\".\\n\\nIf we return to Austin, we will be back!"},{"name":"Bistro 7","address":"231 Peachtree St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2.5","text":"My review might be biased.

I pretty much picked this place solely based on the fact that they have chicken & waffles on the brunch menu. We were going to go right when they opened at 11am but then I read about the noon alcohol Brookline thing, and decided we'd aim to get there at 11:30 knowing we might wait a few minutes, making it close to noon by the time we ordered. Well, it seems that was all for naught. We put our names in at 11:30, waited for about 12 minutes outside (it was a lovely, warm day), and then as we were seated I realized the table next to us had bloody mary's.\\n\\nOnce seated, it took between about 8 minutes to be acknowledged. Actually, the hostess noticed we didn't have any waters and brought us those. Within a moment, the waiter arrived with water. We placed our drink order - a bloody mary and a mimosa and two coffees. When he came back a few moments later with the coffees, we placed our food order - two orders of chicken & waffles (no sausage gravy on either). We were offered coffee refills about 10 minutes later, and I'd say another 5 minutes later our food arrived - but still no cocktails, 20 minutes after ordering! That was pretty disappointing, but the food was a great distraction.\\n\\nThe chicken & waffles were close to perfection. The waffles were quite dry, as Belgian waffles tend to be, and could have used an initial buttering. I smothered mine in room temperature butter from the packets on the table (in the little cup with the jellies). For $13, I would've liked fresh, warm, possibly even whipped, butter. The maple syrup was the real deal, not the cheap pancake syrup. I used a LOT of that. The chicken was perfectly cooked and not at all dry. In fact it was on the greasy side (pre-syrup). Finally our cocktails arrived, and we were checked on during the beginning of our meal. I had long-finished my mimosa by the time I was offered another, and since there was an empty table next to us, I didn't feel bad ordering a second even though we were almost done with our meals and knew the cocktail would take a while. Sure enough, it did, but it was well-made. I will say the waiter appeared to have all 7 tables on our side of the restaurant, so I don't fault him for the infrequency of his check-ins, but the bar seemed to be really slow and unable to keep up/coordinate with the kitchen.\\n\\nMy biggest complaint is that I was seated with my back toward the window on Beacon Street, and I was melting the entire time. They don't have any shades or blinds, and it was a cloudless, 55-degree day. Two parties sat down next to us and promptly got up because they were immediately uncomfortable.

We were greeted warmly as we walked in the door, and headed right over to the bar, where there were plenty of seats.  The bartender/server, Chelsea, was right over, welcomed us, handed us menus, and offered to take our drink menu. We told her it may be a bit since the drink menu was rather long, and Bestie was looking for something different than a glass of wine. I, not in an adventurous mood, decided on my standard glass of Sauvignon Blanc. As a side note, there's a relationship between wine and the glass--some wines (especially reds) need room to breathe, and I don't understand why restaurants use the same sized glass for both the small and large pours of wine; It does make a difference in the taste. Anyway, Bestie decided on a specialty cocktail of some sort, and once that arrived, we attacked the menu, trying to figure out what we wanted to eat. \\n\\nThere are options for everyone available. If you can't find something you like, then you're too fussy an eater. We agreed on the Asian Calamari as a starter to share. She was a bit more hungry than I was, and ordered the Cuban Swordfish, while I decided on the Chicken Cordon Bleu sandwich. Each came with a side, and while I picked the Roasted Brussel Sprouts (my favorite), Bestie went with a 1/2 Seasonal Salad. Chelsea was right there to take our order, and to refill my glass, and brought Bestie wine, as well. \\n\\nFood started to come out quickly. The calamari was a decent-sized portion, and was coated in a light crust that was crunchy. The sweet chili sauce was a welcome change from the basic marinara. We polished that off quickly. \\n\\nHer swordfish was perfectly prepared, and the wedge of lime brought the spices on top to life. My sandwich was fairly standard, which was a good thing, but my only comment was that the roll could have been a bit more 'pretzelly'-it really lacked the texture of other pretzel rolls I've eaten had, but given this was outside of the New York area, is forgivable. My sprouts were perfect!\\n\\nSurprisingly, we each decided on dessert. Bestie ordered a hot apple -served crustless in a cast-iron pan, with a huge scoop of ice cream on top. I felt decadent and ordered a specialty brownie sundae, with lots of hot fudge, ice cream, and covered with crumpled Reese's peanut butter cups. Both were delicious and filling. \\n\\nWhen we were ready to leave, Chelsea settled our tab quickly. The prices were more than reasonable for the quality and quantity we received. Service was impeccable, with Chelsea able to read our need to relax and enjoy the night out, and when we needed attention: no hovering, no check to see if we needed anything every five minutes, and always there when we needed her. \\n\\nI wish this chain would expand into Connecticut.

And although I don't know Lebanese food too well, I can say that all the dishes were executed perfectly. I couldn't complain any dish. The eggplant dip was the best I ever had, smoky and creamy. The pita was piping hot and fresh. My mouth was in sheer ecstasy the whole time. \\n\\nWe also has the dessert sampler and it was just amazing. We of course had baklava and knafeh.

They are worth a try. The beef cheek I had had that visit was not on the menu, so for my main I chose the Milk-Braised Pork Shoulder, which comes surrounded by white beans, escarole and Pecorino cheese. No need for a knife, but a spoon is encouraged to get every drop.\\n\\nMy dinner companion had the Slow Cooked Beef Shoulder (insert shoulder-related joke here, the server did) that arrived in a pot with Yukon Gold mashed potatoes, glazed carrots and other root veggies and topped with a fried egg.

We love Magical Dining Month, but we also wish there was a dinner for two option. Like, one app, two entrees, and one dessert for like $55. That would be awesome. Anyway, I digress. So the atmosphere of this place is absolutely beautiful. It's definitely southern, but it's also definitely upscale southern. It was like eating in a five-star barn. Btw, if you check in on the Yelp app offers you 15% off your bill, which awesome, but it does not stack with the Magical Dining Month. \\n\\nSo we ordered two apps, the Fried Avocado (stuffed with lump crab meat salad, warm house remoulade, pico de gallo) and the Crispy Pork Belly (house-made slow roasted, scratch cornbread, citrus & balsamic glaze). \\nThe fried avocado was super creamy. Super duper creamy. The richness of the avocado and the crab salad was heaven on my tongue, and the pico cut right through it with it's acidity. It was a really nice bite. \\nThe pork belly was just that, pork belly. Just imagine a really nicely cooked cube of belly. The fat was rendered down perfectly and just melted in your mouth. The really different thing on this plate was the cornbread. It was not traditional cornbread. It was in the shape of a French toast stick, and with the glaze on the plate, it was reminiscent of one, too. It's hard to describe, because it's so unique. If you have to have only one app, make it this one.\\n\\nWe also got two entrees, the Grilled New Zealand Lamb Chops (served with crispy fingerling potatoes, grilled asparagus, cherry demi glace) and the Maple Leaf Farms Duck and Waffles (confit of Maple Leaf Farms duck, savory rice waffle, blueberry hoisin reduction). \\nThe lamb chops were cooked to a perfect medium rare, and there were six little chops on the plate, which is more than you usually get at restaurants, I feel. So good. So decadent with the glace. The glace was very cherry-like, though, which shocked me, but it works. Potatoes were good. Asparagus is never done well enough at restaurants, in my opinion. Get some char on those suckers.\\nThe duck and waffles were mind-blowing. That waffles was so thin and crisp on the outside, but light, airy, and fluffy on the inside. Perfect waffle. I feel like it being a rice waffle made it more crisp. The duck was sooo good. Moist and juicy and seasoned awesomely well. It was the perfect partner for my waffle. The hoisin reduction was a good sauce to tie it all together. Sweet vs savory waffles is always a debate, but this kind of made it both. Top notch. Get this entree.\\n\\nFor desserts, we got the White Chocolate Bread Pudding (golden raisins, rum caramel sauce) and the Bourbon Pecan Pie (topped with whipped cream and candied pecans). \\nThe bread pudding was interesting. It was more like a bread pudding flavored cake, but it was still delicious, and the caramel sauce was top notch.\\nThe dessert winner, however, was the pecan pie. Take pecan pie filling and use it for the glue of some pecan squares. It was ooey and gooey and delicious. Look at the photo and go get it. \\n\\nOverall, this place was awesome. It had some truly unique offerings that I have never seen before, and it executed them very well. Our service was top notch, and the flavors were truly contemporary southern, as promised. Looking at the menu, there are so, so many offerings that I have to go back and try.

I was extremely disappointed because at $6 almost $7, I expect to get more than dissatisfying rabbit food in a salty broth.\\n\\nI wanted to give this place another go so just the other night I ordered a wonton soup and General Tso's chicken which came with fried rice and an egg roll. Everything seemed tasteless and old. The soup's broth was really, really salty and didn't even have scallions. Some of the chicken pieces  had cartilage still attached so that was an unpleasant surprise when bitting into them. The rice didn't have any pieces of pork or peas or onions like most places. It didn't taste great and I ended up not eating most of the food.\\n\\nThe people that runt the business are extremely nice and that's why I'm giving this place 2 stars instead of 1."},{"name":"Whataburger","address":"801 E William Cannon Dr, Ste 300","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"Can't give them zero stars but they earned a zero.

I've had the sweet corn, pork, and chicken. Each tamale is $3 and topped with your choice or mild or hot sauce. I've tried both sauces and I have to say - I would buy either sauce if they started selling it at the Farmers Market. The mild green sauce was the perfect compliment to the sweet corn tamale. The pork tamale had a very generous portion of tender pork. All of the tamales are gluten free, and they have vegetarian options as well. \\n\\nThe ladies running the stand couldn't have been sweeter.

The two of us ordered a ridic amount of food for $53.\\n\\nHoney rosemary dipped fried chicken $6- probably our fav (also because it's a protein). Comes with 1 small boneless chicken breast and 1 thigh. Juicy and moist, seasoned well, and very crispy. The biscuit was good too. \\n\\nChicken liver mousse $5- my husband surprisingly really enjoyed this. By itself, it is VERY salty, however w/ the crostini, it's fine. Our first loaf was so hard that it could cut our gums (probably toasted and sat out since they space out your food). However, the 2nd loaf was better (yes, you can get more bread for free because it's a lot of pate). Pretty tasty and complimented well w/ the pickled onion.\\n\\nCrispy Brussels sprout leaves $5- i always love roasted brussels sprouts and these were definitely good if you need something green\\n\\nTruffled deviled eggs $5 (4 eggs)- pretty tasty and very filled, but then again it's your typical deviled egg\\n\\nDuck fat fries $5.50- not sure what the hype is about. The fries were normal and actually a bit too salty. The egg was normal. The bearnaise sauce was good however and helped tone down the saltiness. Wouldn't order again. \\n\\nBlackened redfish $25- would've been okay if we didn't order this since we were already SO full from all the appetizers and it took a LONG time to come out. The waiter asked if we still had room for the redfish after we pretty much finished our food already, so clearly they hadn't even started preparing it. Surprisingly it was a nice size filet. The crust was good and tasty, however the fish itself was bland and a bit overcooked. Not sure if I've ever had redfish though so I don't know what to expect. Quinoa and lentils were good, chipotle Tabasco lemon butter sauce was good to dip the fish in since it was plain.

When we walked in I was immediately hit with the overwhelming smell of shrimp, and about an 80 degree room temperature.  There was a lobby full of people but we signed in, and only waited about 15 minutes for a table, not too bad.  We were seated in the bar, and it took about 15 more minutes for our waitress to acknowledge us. Once she took our drink/appetizer orders (Thai iced tea and veggie spring rolls), she didn't return until they were ready (15 more minutes), and that's when she  finally took our food order.  My guy ordered the chicken pad Thai, and I had the tom kha soup.  Our food took about 45 minutes to get to our table from this point.  \\n\\nThe breakdown:\\nVeggie Spring Rolls, they were delicious.  The inside was filled with cabbage, noodles, carrots, and some corn.  The dipping sauce was a very viscous well-balanced sweet and sour sauce that complemented the rolls perfectly.  The Thai iced tea was way too sweet for my liking, almost unpalatable.\\n\\nThe Chicken Pad Thai was extremely dry, there wasn't enough sauce, and it lacked depth in flavor. It was sub par for sure.  The tom kha soup was decent.  It is a far thicker consistency than I'm used to for this soup, not a bad thing just very noticeable.  I chose to have chicken in my soup, and it was fine I guess, it basically\\n tasted like boiled chicken (how much raving can you do for that).  I did notice that there weren't the normal large chunks of galangal root to avoid, which was nice, and just a few lemongrass layers needed to be removed.  The flavor was spot on, but they had crumbled a chili into the soup and it was really hot.  I've never had this type of soup be spicy, the chili is normally intact so that you can choose your level of spicy.  Not this night.\\n\\nThe spicy soup combined with the extremely high temperature and loudness of the restaurant, and the overwhelming smell of shrimp started becoming unbearable during the meal.  Halfway though our meal we both started feeling sick from it all, and just wanted to leave.  It took us 20 minutes just to get our waitress's attention so that we could have our check.  \\n\\nAll in all, the food was just okay to dine is such a loud, smelly, hot atmosphere with kind of terrible service."},{"name":"TILT","address":"1355 NW Everett St, Ste 120","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Cocktails were delish!

I'm a pescatarian, he loves meat. Our one common admiration- sushi. He asked me where to go; I provided 3 options, he chose Hanabi. I'm glad he did. He made reservations for 9 and I too eagerly awaited.\\n\\nWe were sat at about 9:10- not bad at all, although there is no real waiting area inside, so be aware that if it is 50 degrees outside (when it was 70 degrees 30 minutes earlier), you will need to wait outside in your gorgeous, sleeveless mini dress like I did.\\n\\nThe restaurant is in a mini mall. Not glamorous, but definitely not uncomfortable. Hanabi could certainly fit the bill for any occasion with their fine interior design.\\n\\nOur first dish was the chili escolar. We both made audible sounds of pleasure almost immediately. The dish was perfectly executed, cut to perfection with an amazing sauce. The texture was great. I knew this would be a terrific meal from the second the escolar hit my tongue.\\n\\nNext was the sashimi platter. If I'm correct, 16 pieces of 4 varieties. Now, don't get me wrong, I like rice. I like nigiri. But.. sometimes you just want fish. This was the right time. This was a STERLING PLATTER. Back was the escolar just reminding me how fresh and flavorful their selection was. The other three were... awesome. I had no clue what one of the cuts was, but I'm calling it right now- best raw fish I've ever had. I'm not sure I'll ever recover from the regret of not asking the waiter what I had just eaten.\\n\\nThe soft shell crab tempura was great! I naturally dislike fried things- including tempura-  but love soft shell crab, so I took the chance. It was worth it. Delicious, with a mushroom sauce that was SO GOOD. I don't even really like mushrooms, but I strongly recommend this.\\n\\nThe seafood cucumber sunomo was also great. I'm very partial towards gelatinous creatures so I really enjoyed the squid and octopus, but; reviewing the menu now, it seems it came along with scallop, clam, and shrimp? I only remember the Krab left over after I ate the good stuff. Which, by the way, was REALLY good- but there was way too much cucumber for my liking. There was also added roe, which was fantastic.\\n\\nWe also ordered various nigiris. The octopus was AMAZING. I'd already had an enjoyable cut in the previous dish, so the sushi grade cut in this was just delicious.  The roe sushi was amazing! Really... amazing. My boyfriend, however, was unimpressed with the Mackerel (his usual favorite).\\n\\nWe walked out for about $65 which, in my experience, is EXTREMELY reasonable for wonderful sushi. Have you seen their lunch specials?! I actually felt upset that I worked down the road for YEARS and never took advantage of the eel bento box for $12?! Man, I messed up.\\n\\nI would recommend you come here for breakfast, but you can't. I recommend it for lunch, and you really should. I recommend it for dinner, and I hope you do.My big take away is that Hanabi has some really high quality fish that they may not fancy up as much as other places around town- so, really, you get a steal. GREAT fish cuts, but a very reasonable price.\\n\\nYou want fancy shmancy raw fish with sauces and planks and weird shit? Yeah, you can get that here... but you should really just order some sashimi and appreciate that Hanabi will provide you with perfect cuts of the best fish. THIS is what matters\\n\\nMan, this is some GOOD FISH."},{"name":"Al Wadi","address":"1249 Vfw Pkwy","city":"West Roxbury","stars":"4","text":"I've been trying to come here for a long time and I finally did wit my family.

For a Tuesday night, it was pretty packed. But then again, it is the North End, so every restaurant was busy. We were seated within 10 minutes and our request to sit by the open-concept window was granted (yay!). The House Salad was up first, and it was a nice balanced mixture of greens and garden veggies. Their balsamic vinegar is what makes this salad (and the bread dip) so damn good. I would recommend getting a salad with your pasta if you're going for a cream-based pasta. \\n\\nNext, the mains. I ordered the Crazy Alfredo, which is apparently their most popular dish, and my girlfriend ordered the carbonara. As a disclaimer, I am huge on Alfredo and carbonara, but I very rarely finish my plate because of the heaviness of the sauce. Well, this time around, I finished both of our plates. The slightly spicy crazy Alfredo included chicken and sausages, along with smoked red peppers. The spice balanced out the sauce beautifully and the fettuccine was the best I've ever tasted (I believe they make their pasta in house). The carbonara sauce was a wonderful mix of rich pancetta, cheese, cream, and eggs. I could taste each component working together in the sauce. \\n\\nLastly, I paired my meal with a New Zealand sauv blanc. \\n\\nMake sure to ask for reservations if you have a party of more than two, or if it's a weekend.

We waited 45 minutes for our entrees AFTER we finished an appetizer that we had already waited half an hour for (which was one order of chicken wings). When the entrees finally came out, nothing came at the same time. The last to arrive was a chicken Caesar salad--how hard is it to time a burger, fish and chips and a chicken Caesar? The person who ordered the burger did not get the right toppings. The fish and chips came with cole slaw in the same size cup as the tartar sauce--doesn't the cook know that cole slaw is a side, not a condiment?  Also, fried foods are served in metal racks with paper in them. It would be better if the cook took the time to drain the fry oil, rather than serving on grease-loaded paper. The server also didn't even bother to remove the used app plates before serving the entrees. In 45 minutes, he couldn't manage to remove dirty plates with chicken bones?  We will not be back.

We were disappointed to see that there were no longer any free tables/seats in their caf√© area, so we asked one of the servers if we could sit at one of the dining tables even if we were just going to order drinks. The server said it was fine since there were other free tables and we were seated at one of the tables.\\n\\nAfter a friend and I went up front to order our drinks, we came back to our table and one of the servers comes up to us and hands us a food menu. After we kindly tell her that we were told that we didn't have to order food,  she gives us the dirtiest look  and after a short pause goes \\"uuhhhhhhh no, you HAVE to order food\\" while rolling her eyes at us. I get that it might be a matter of miscommunication between the server who we previously talked to and her, yet it does not excuse her rude manner of communicating with us. We were thus put in this very uncomfortable position where we had no choice but to order food even though we were already full from lunch we had just moments earlier. When that same server served us our food and interacted with us, she was very cold and seemed to be highkey judging us. Her demeanour towards us did change though when we saw another employee (probably a manager or superior who overheard us complaining about her) talk to her for a brief moment. She came back and suddenly started to be nicer to us, though we could tell it was fake and forced. This experience left my friends and I a bit peeved, which is a shame since we often came here for their milk teas.

It was worth every minute of wait and every penny for the food. We were in the area hoping to eat some lobster rolls at the famed Neptune. We had to find an alternative because the wait over there was ridiculous. It was approaching noon, so plan changed and we decided to try another legend - Carmelina's instead. When we got there, apparently there was also a line waiting prior to restaurant's opening time (they open at noon) and again we had to wait unfortunately  (but do yourself a favor by making a reservation if you plan to dine here). We decided to wait out this time since the neighborhood was getting quickly filled with even more hungry tourists. And it turned out to be the best decision we've made for food. There were four of us and we obviously underestimated the food portion size and ordered way too much. If you like to sample appetizers, I recommend one appetizer per person and splitting an entr√©e between two people or skip appetizer. It is home cooking after all, so sharing is welcomed. I ordered my all-time favorite pasta dish spaghetti in white clam sauce and it was the best white clam pasta I've ever had (with NYC and Rome Italy accounted for). The plate was huge with generous amount of fresh little neck clams (like a dozen). First, let me start with the pasta, spaghetti here is home made and everyone knows nothing beats the texture of fresh pasta, al dente but not too chewy, has that elastic feeling that bites you back in the mouth. The clams were super fresh and clean. They were so juicy and plump and not chewy at all. There were also chopped clams in the white wine sauce to add more umami flavor. Among our group of four, we also had spicy shrimp, baked meatballs as appetizers, Frutti di Mare (x2), and Colorado Lamb Shank. All of the dishes were quite outstanding which you could definitely taste the quality of ingredients. I also wanted to highlight their tomato sauce, which reminds me of the sauce I was taught in a cooking class back in Rome with ripe tomatoes from Sicily. So naturally tasting and perfectly balanced; not too thin and not too thick, just perfect to coat every string of the angel hair pasta. I recommend definitely trying at least one red sauce based dish among the group."},{"name":"Hy's Steakhouse & Cocktail Bar","address":"637 Hornby Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Great place for large party.

It was literally 2 untouched items that I had payed for in a Togo box. When I had tap his shoulder telling him that was my food he had taken it out of the busboy bucked and tried to give it to me !! Yuck! That made me highly upset. Yes I know I walked away from the table and it's their job to clean the table however our waitress was right behind him he could have given it to her.

I had my luggage with me waiting in line which was a good hour wait since I arrived during the lunch hours.

Well, this is what you will get there, they are giant! I was hoping it would be more tender but the outside was too charred for me and the inside was slightly dry when I had it. I wouldn't order this again.\\n\\n1/2 a lb of the pork ribs- The only reason I would consider giving the place 4 stars instead of 3 stars. The pork ribs were slightly sweet, savory, tender, and ON POINT! Definitely worth getting, not the beef rib. \\n\\n2 homemade sausage- The spices of the pepper comes through and they are large. Don't expect to find little itty bitty sausage cause they could be shared between 2-3 people. \\n\\n1 chipotle coleslaw - I definitely needed my veges with the meat so I liked how this wasn't too salty. Def worth getting. \\n\\n1 pickles- Too sour for me.. it tasted like allll vinegar\\n\\n1 mac and cheese- I had the chipotle flavor mac and cheese and it was tasty, I liked the jalapeno spicy flavor and the cheese sauce def makes it nice and savory pairing with the meat\\n\\nLet's say, for 2 people, I apparently ordered food for more like 5 grown adults!!

They did a stand up job though! \\n\\nThe Food: \\nPork Chop stuffed with Prosciutto and Mozzarella: I was on the fence about ordering this since it could have gone either way: really delicious or really dry and over kill. Obviously, given the rating, it was AMAZING. The pork was juicy, succulent and savory. The mozzarella inside was melted and gooey, just how I LOVE it. The prosciutto was the perfect seasoning that added that salty, meaty kick to every bite. This is no joke of a meal, and if you are hungry, and I mean HUNGRY and want something DELICIOUS, put your phone down and order this! \\n\\nMy friends ordered the meat sauce penne and the crazy alfredo.

Nothing special! I think the best item on the menu is probably their sea salt iced coffee.\\n\\nThe general vibe of Tea Haus is a hipster spin off of your regular boba tea spot.

From the moment we walked in we were hit with rules. No outside drinks (a diet coke for a friend who was not drinking alcohol), not outside food (even though they serve no food other than bags of chips) and everything thing you do in your room is watched on camera. We were the ONLY PEOPLE THERE so the staff legitimately watched our camera and monitored everything we did. A friend of mine grabbed two french fries out of  her bag, yes two fries, not the box or bag or container, but two fries, and they swung open the door to yell at us. Another friend stood on his chair while singing, BAM! The door opens again to yell at us. Another friend was sitting on the table to use the screen to select songs, and then the door swings open again to tell us you can't sit on the table. Now there is no chair in front of the screen to sit on while using it, so there is no option but to stand and bend down every time you wanted to put a song on... which took 5 minutes every time you wanted to select a song because they have a HORRIBLE AND MINIMAL song selection and the system is NOT USER FRIENDLY AT ALL!! After being bothered every 10-15 minutes by the staff we decided we couldn't deal with it anymore and decided to leave.

The staff came in to bother us over and over and over but shockingly they never came in to tell us we had gone over our time, or what the cost would be if we stayed longer so they basically run a scam to let you stay longer and charge you double!!

Not my top choice for beer, but glad to see they roll out better beers on weekdays.  In addition, oysters were $1 each from 3PM - 6PM.  Yay for deals.\\n\\nThe plaza is under construction so the pub is a bit hidden and you're looking out into a construction yard.  However, it has a pretty good dark, modern vibe with an appreciated lack of pretentiousness despite the sleek decor and gourmet gastropub-angle.  On the weekends, it takes on a bit of a lounge/club feel with a 3AM closing time and a live DJ.\\n\\nNo complaints about the food overall - the menu is quite creative and upmarket from your typical pub food.  The oysters (served with 4 unique sauces) and the potato wedges fried in duck fat were pretty good.  My friends enjoyed their tourti√®re meat pie ($15) and Po' Boy ($15) which were decent portions.  Not amazing food, but a damn sight better than what you would expect from a typical bar/pub.\\n\\nService was very prompt and attentive and let us be when my friends put in a marathon 'catch up over drinks' session.\\n\\nOverall, I like the overall formula of this place - everyday drink specials and good food in a relaxed environment.

Stepping out a few times a week to try different places close to home. Tonight we had a nice experience with Mandalyn as our server. She was very informative and had a great personality. Our food was brought out at a pretty good pace and the flavor profiles were very tasty. We both decided to dine from the regular menu and not partake off the Portland dining month menu. \\n We started with the fried calamari, flavorful but sad that it was not crispy.\\n Next we each tried a salad. A little pricey for a small dinner salad. I tried the spinach salad which was drowned in  tangy dressing and it made it difficult to finish my $10 starter salad. My husband got the winner salad which was absolutely perfect. (It was big enough we could have split it.)The blue chopped salad was definitely a step up from my salad.  Again,  I was sad. \\n We ordered the Braised short ribs . The meat was tender but not fall apart soft. It had wonderful flavor atop al dente pasta and topped with crispy onion straws. \\n I ordered the chicken Madeira over Parmesan risotto. Amazing flavor profiles with each bite and each item on the plate sampled separately. The chicken was not cut with a fork tender, a bit on the rubbery side but the flavor of the sauce and combined with the risotto it was delicious. Eating my two favorite things, Chicken Madeira and Risotto I was no longer sad. \\n We ended our dining experience with a Pluot cobbler which was more like a crumble but was tasty whatever they want to call it! Served warm a la mode with Vanilla Bean ice cream we ended our evening on a high note. \\nIt was refreshing to see the owner interacting with all the patrons and actually thanking everyone individually for coming in.

My friends raved about Salty Sow so much that I came in with high expectations and maybe that's what caused my disappointment. My boyfriend and I got a reservation during happy hour, and I had a list of recommendations from my friends. What could possibly go wrong? \\n\\nFirst of all, the atmosphere is great and so was the service. It's very classy and romantic. Now, onto the food (the most important part of any review).\\n\\nHere's what we ordered:\\n- Triple Fried Duck Fat Fries: Imagine fries with a partially cooked egg and some cold sauce that I'm not quite sure what it tasted like. It tasted GOOD, but I don't think it was off-the-wall amazing. \\n- Crispy Brussels Sprout Leaves:  Imagine deconstructed brussels sprout that have a nice crispy texture with some yellow raisins sprinkled in. I liked this appetizer because it wasn't heavy and it was slightly sweet.  \\n- Crisp Chicken Thighs:  This is two chicken thighs with a crisp exterior, sitting on some small potatoes. There's a \\"neck bone gravy\\" sauce but it's not thick like gravy. The chicken was cooked well, very moist, but the problem was there wasn't any real outstanding flavor. I felt like I was eating chicken over and over. I got a little tired of eating chicken + potato + chicken + potato... I was very disappointed because my friend claimed this was her favorite entree here. \\n- Candied Pork Belly:  My boyfriend ordered this and he said the pork belly was cooked well (moist) just like my chicken. The collard greens that come with it are a little sour (I think so you don't get tired of just eating pork belly). Smaller portion than the chicken thighs. He, too, got tired of eating the pork belly. He claimed that everything here just tasted \\"salty\\"..sounds like the name of the restaurant so there's no false advertising there lol. \\nTotal:  about $40 for two people (2 apps + 2 entrees during happy hour) \\n\\nI really wanted to try the dessert (maybe Salty Sow would redeem itself with dessert) but by then I was just so disappointed and full of chicken that we opted to go to Dolce Neve (a place we knew for sure was good for dessert). \\n\\nThe bottom line:\\nThe food at Salty Sow is cooked well, there's no doubt. However, the flavor isn't spectacular or special enough to make me want to come back for more. In my opinion, I think $15 is a little much for two chicken thighs that were cooked well and some literally squashed potatoes. I wouldn't have paid full price for the appetizers either. Maybe this place was too fancy for me and I couldn't appreciate their culinary skills. Who knows. Also random side note, everything I ate made me REALLY thirsty.

We are four Harvard educated Asian women, which is a fact unfortunately really important in this post when it shouldn't be.  Our waitress brought us the wine menu and we all ordered our drinks. We first noticed that she seemed to have a bit of attitude but we didn't really care about it that much. But after we ordered our food, this woman came back and violently shoved me towards our table because she was serving the couple behind us. Mind it that this restaurant is really packed and I just sat in the chair where they put it. It was in a tight corner and the most human-like behavior is to ask nicely that whether I can squeeze in a little bit, even though there was no space. But she did not say a word, just violently shoved me. Again I did not want to read into it. However, this woman came back around and gave us more water. I was not aware that they had a no phone policy, but even when I am aware I believe they just don't want you to talk on the phone. So I pushed my home button and checked a quick message quietly, and my friend told me the waitress give me stinky eye for doing that. Again I did not want to read into it but at that point it was really annoying. Later a man came around leading some guests towards the table behind us. There were a lot of people in the restaurant and there was a big table with approximately 8 people sitting around. They were enjoying their conversation too, laughing and just talking like we were. However, then waiter turned around and told us to keep it down when people at the other table were making 10 times more noise then we were, which is out right racist and disrespectful. At this point we were really annoyed and just wanted to pay and go. The waitress came back with the check and I nicely asked how many cards they take. She stared at me with a smirk on her face and didn't say anything for a minute. I said 'just wanted to check, some restaurants have a limit' and she was still smirking and said ok we will take four. I don't know what kind of racial profiling she was doing over there but it was the most uncomfortable moment I've experienced. We decided based on the combined experience of decent food quality and horrific service, to give a 15% tip. This waitress came back to pick up the check and checked all four receipts to see how much tip we gave her, while we were still sitting there. It was the most ridiculous and utterly disturbing experience anyone can ever have. Other than the two waiters, the rest of the staff is fine and again, the food was decent.

Before I even talk about food! Let me tell you the 411 on the style and what to expect at 12 hours! Its cafeteria style so they serve you but you clean up yourself. THAT MEANS EVERYTHING including water and utensils, im not complaining trust me, im just letting you guys know. Other than that the restaurant is clean and extremely homey when it comes to decor as well as the personalities that you will interact with. The host ladies are the nicest thai people that I have ever met! \\n\\nOn to the foood! There are so many good options here, but you should go soon to try out the lunch and special dinner sets! the exclusive promotional offers are over May 31. They are amazing. \\n\\nI have tried a variety of things here including the Green Bermuda Triangle (fried chive cake), Curry Bunker, Hot Lava Cheese Explosion, Pho Beef Noodle Soup, Oppa Noodle Soup, Street Noodle Soup and of course the Blueberry Crab Rangoons which are to die for. Seriously, if my boyfriend wasn't nice enough to share with me I think we would be fighting a world war over them. They are delicious, light and definitely not too sweet despite blueberry being in the name. \\n\\nI honestly dont even know what to say about the place to YOU who are reading this to drop whatever it is your doing and get in your car. NOW. and drive to this place, you honestly won't regret it. The portions are big the flavors are there and on point without overwhelming any tastebuds. This place has made itself onto my weekly restaurant outings list!\\n\\nI will see you guys there !"},{"name":"Contigo","address":"2027 Anchor Ln","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"The scene: An all outdoor patio bar, with an inviting and relaxing feel. Their food is also far above what you'd expect at a 'bar' styled venue. I've now spent a couple hot afternoons and evenings here, yet they do a great job of keeping it rather cool and well circulated. Already they're busy so try to come in before 7:30 unless you don't mind having to wait/stand.\\n\\nGood for: Their small plates. Grab a couple friends and order a selection of them with your drinks. I was impressed with the menu items and how simple yet delectable they all are. I personally love the pickled beets, and the fried potatoes and pig ears. The pickled beets are housemade, a great fresh, light (and addicting) dish. The fried potatoes and pig ears are a little different than I would of expected (your normal thick french fries and the dried pig ears you'd eat while watching football). Both items are 'shaved' thinly and lightly fried. Yum.\\n\\nMust have: Rabbit and dumplings - I'm a sucker for a good dumpling dish, especially if made correctly. Contigo does it. The vegetables are perfectly cooked, the rabbit juicy and tender, the dumplings (while this the only part I think is not to die for) made fresh and delicious, and the sauce is perfectly made - just pulls the whole dish together.\\n\\nDessert: They had an off menu dessert the past two times I was there. One trip I had a dish with fresh and local peaches topped cream fraiche on the side of a  shortcake slice. The peaches themselves were delicious but the shortcake was dry and left something to desire.\\n\\nVeggie review: Stay away from the white bean dip (while really good, has duck fat). The last time I went they had 'fried' okra, although it's not listed on their menu online. Instead of batter and deep frying them, they pan fried them. If you like okra like me, you'll devour them fast. For my vegan friends, while there are one or two items to eat here I wouldn't come here hungry.\\n\\nOther comments: Their Burger and fries were a little disappointing here. While the burger itself wasn't at all bad, compared to the rest of the dishes I just wasn't impressed. I cannot put my finger on it, either the meat was under seasoned or a tad overcooked. I will have to give this dish another try in the hopes it was just a bad fluke (if I can pull myself away from ordering the rabbit & dumpling dish)."},{"name":"Kobe Japanese Steakhouse - I-Drive","address":"8148 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Came here over the weekend With my family  and everything was great. our server Jessica was amazing and she was super attentive and gave some great recommendations!

Abigail and a new waiter shadowing her took care of us. she carefully explained the daily special, the menu, the expansive wine menu and if we had any questions, to not hesitate to ask.  the bang bang shrimp for an appetizer was delish.  fresh, crunchy and mild heat seduced our taste buds.  going from wine to water to cleanse the palate after each bite to experience the flavors was refreshing. the filet mignon was on target.

The slightly spicy alfredo sauce felt like it was confused between being alfredo or being spicy, and the chicken pieces didn't really add a whole lot flavor-wise. The texture of the noodles was the most redeeming quality. My mom got the gnocchi which she thought was just average. I think the key issue for me here is that if you don't like the first few bites then you've got a huge portion of pasta to finish.

Won't be going back unless they reduce their prices or drop the service charge.

It has a great buffet for lunch and it's a fairly cheap one for being all you can eat. There's also an all vegetarian buffet on Tuesdays. It also has a menu with some good appetizers and beverages to complement your buffet items. There is pretty friendly and good service here too and they are happy to make recommendations. \\n\\nI always come for the buffet. I have never ordered off the menu so I can't say what I like on it. The lunch buffet has several vegetarian options, usually including biryani and soup. At about $9 it is reasonable for the amount of food you can eat. They also have a totally vegetarian buffet on Tuesday for a few dollars more, so that is worth checking out. It's also a nice looking restaurant inside so you could take someone here and still not pay that much. There is a full bar and they have several Indian beers. Another bonus is seeing into the kitchen. They have their tandoori oven right there behind the window so you can watch them cook your food.  \\n\\nI recommend Taj Palace for cheap Indian food.

We waited about an hour and a half to get our food. When we got our food at 12:30, they had just set the place for last person in line (outside the fence) to be guaranteed food. My advice: at the very latest, you need to be here by 11:45 to get food. You need to get here before opening to have your pick of whatever you want; they had run out of beef ribs right before we got to the counter.\\n\\nBut man is it worth it. I got brisket, sausage, and pork ribs. Wowza. So good. I tried both the lean brisket and the fatty brisket, and while the lean brisket is probably healthier and had a smokier flavor, the fatty brisket is so tender and delicious, your head might explode. The sausage was tougher than I expected, but that was okay because every bite is juicy and full of flavor. I would rate it behind Micklethwait.

Normally, I would whole-heartedly support this -- if the service was decent. But, sadly, that's not the case with Tilt. First, every time I have gone to Tilt, there is a long line to order your food. Second, you have to collect your own silverware, napkins and so on. And your (uncooked) food when they buzz you. Third, you must bus your own table. This is all fine, but it begs the question: what is the 14% \\"tip\\" for? I routinely tip 20-25% at a restaurant where I actually get even mediocre service.

Fresh piping hot bread was brought over straight from the oven and extra virgin olive oil and high quality balsamic were poured for dipping. We asked the server what dish our neighbors were indulging in and it was the Sunday Macaroni Plate which is on menu but one could easily have skipped over it not realizing it's fame. It was fricken amazing---everything you want in a slow-key late Sunday lunch with braised beef short-rib that falls off the bone, housemade meatballs and sausage, al dente noodles sauced thoroughly in a savory well-seasoned tomato sauce and a beautiful dollop of fresh ricotta.

I had the honey duck which was fantastic, perfectly cooked so it wasn't soggy or too gooey and the flavor was on point, perfect mix of spice, sweetness and duck umami. My friend had the perfect match which lived up to its name - delightfully crispy orange beef and perfectly cooked shrimp with just the right amount of spicy kick. \\n\\nThe fried cheesecake was decadent but not overwhelmingly sweet or heavy, which is hard to do with that much carb and sugar, but they pulled it off. Can't remember what appetizers we had, likely the crab rangoon and crispy calamari, but the fact that I can't remember them is likely a testament to just an okay experience. \\n\\nSo first impression was definitely a 4, nearly a 5. But the second time we went on a non-special dining event (typical girls night out) was a different story. \\n\\nIt wasn't too crowded since it was a weekday night and there were maybe two other tables seated when we got there. My friend ordered sushi and I ordered the honey garlic chicken. Her sushi arrived first, which was a bit unusual since most places end up with the hot dishes coming well before sushi since it's more labor intensive. My friend waited until I got my entree before she started eating, but when we hit the 5 minute mark with no chicken in sight, I told her to eat before the fish went bad (a terrible joke, I know). During this time, our waitress had disappeared into the ether and I spied what I believed to be my dish sitting on the pass through growing colder by the second. \\n\\nI was finally able to track down who I believe is the owner, a delightful little woman, who positively flipped out and retrieved my dish from the window. She apologized profusely, said she thought I just didn't order any food and wasn't sure whose dish that was on the counter. But that was it, I got lukewarm (yet tasty, I'll admit) food and nothing more than an apology. \\n\\nWe haven't been back since, not specifically because of that experience, but just that it's sort of out of the way and there are so many other great places with similar offerings that haven't had ghost waitresses on staff.

Same server never checked in after our food was delivered, and we had to flag someone down to get forks, as metal chopsticks were the only utensils on the table. One item was never delivered (cup of soup) but it was left on the check. Honest mistake to forget, but I could have asked for it had a server come by to see if we got everything we needed and more important, asked if we were enjoying everything we ordered. You know, standard steps of service. The servers all seemed much more preoccupied with their takeout orders than caring about giving good service to their dine-in guests. \\n\\nAnother thing, food does not come out all at once. So if you aren't sharing (I recommend you do at most Chinese restaurants!), there were a few minutes between each dish landing on the table. Two of our entrees came out before the appetizer.

That being said here's my list of issues with Hollywood Casino.\\n\\n-As others have said it's in a ghetto neighborhood.  They really blew it by putting it on the west side.  Downtown would have made for some amazing nights out to the Arena district and casino.  \\n\\n-Try getting a drink while you are gambling. It's nearly impossible!  Drink girls rarely walk around.  I've had at least 3 times during weekend nights where we have waited 45 minutes or longer for one to show up.  Remember, you have to pay for drinks they are not free like Vegas.  You would think they would be around MORE often since they are making money on them!!  I've complained to numerous pit bosses and table dealers who all agree it's a joke and customers complain all the time.\\n\\n-As others have said prices for drinks are steep!  I'm actually OK with this if you get good pours.  You don't.  Bartenders push a button for many shots and it automatically dispenses the alcohol.  The pours are so small it's almost a joke.  Also, as others say you can't order more than 2 drinks at a time.  I drink makers mark on the rocks.  Based on the terrible table drink service I'd like to order about 4 drinks (which would equal about 1 actual glass of alcohol) to get me through an hour or so of gambling.  Tough luck...I can only order 2 and then hope a drink girl actually shows up while I'm playing.\\n\\n-Customer Service - I've sent them emails several times regarding the issues above.  Never a response.  Black hole. \\n\\nBottom line is this place serves a purpose if you like to gamble.  Pre-game or pound some drinks in the parking lot to save money and actually get enough alcohol to feel good would be my biggest top (don't drink and drive of course!).

I informed Riley about this issue and she tried to argue with me by telling me the wings were cooked just fine. She finally had enough and grabbed a chicken wing to bite into it. After she bit into it, she placed it back on to my plate and told me it was fine. I demanded that I get better cooked wings or I'm speaking to the manager. Riley rolled her eyes then took the wings back. When I got up to use the restroom, I overheard Riley and another server talked about how they wanted to spit in my food. Thirty minutes later, we got wings that were better cooked. I paid the bill and left. I didn't bother speaking to the manager because I was pissed and wasn't in the mood.

I've been to the Walmart, Tea Haus, and Phonatic on Anderson, yet this jewel has been out of sight on the other side of the complex.  When it comes to spending money on sushi, I always think, \\"Why don't I just spend about the same and go to Junai?\\"  NO.  There's a time and place for everything, and if you want high quality sushi, you gotta give credit where credit is due.\\n\\nThe establishment is small, but fairly intimate.  I ate here with my girlfriend, and we chose to sit at the bar.  Our server was really nice and friendly.  Slow on the water one time, but overall really on top of things.  The sushi chefs were super fun to watch and occasionally asked us how our meal was.  We shared the Chirashi, Caterpillar roll, Hanabi roll, and the Hungry roll.\\n\\nThe bowl that the Chirashi came in looked small, but it was stuffed with so much sushi.  We counted at least 12 different things; 2 pieces per item with 3 pieces each of tuna and salmon.  Each piece was much larger than I expected.  I can't believe what I'm saying, but they may have been too large....WHAT???  One piece of salmon could be two pieces at another location.  While having a piece so large and thick was heavenly to my tongue, it did not melt in your mouth as easily.  Nevertheless, each bite we took was complete raw fishy bliss.  A couple highlights include the Scallop.  I don't know if I've ever had raw scallops this plump.  All flavors from the scallop are there and may have been my favorite 10 seconds of my meal.  The eel also stood out.  You can really feel the rough texture of the eel, something that I don't experience from many places.  Even the octopus and the surf clam, which can easily be pretty tough and chewy, were tasty, gelatinous, and went down easy.  The Chirashi is more expensive than other places at $25.95, but its quality and quantity is clearly worth it.\\n\\nWatching the sushi chefs in front of us constructing our rolls was hypnotic and searing the escolar with a blow torch even more so.  Go look at picture of the Caterpillar roll.  Embrace in its adorable-ness.  I filled my weekly quota of avocado alone on the Caterpillar roll and the eel and its sauce were both delicious.  Now on the Hanabi roll.  Escolar is in my top 2 favorite sashimi and searing it really bring out a different flavor and stronger texture.  I still hold space in my heart for the creaminess of purely raw escolar, but I don't regret not passing up the seared escolar experience.  Of the three rolls, the Hungry was my favorite.  It's essentially a salmon/tuna/escolar candy cane.  Everything else on the roll backs up the fish flavors rather than covers it.  A really confident roll that speaks to Hanabi's quality.\\n\\nThe sushi competition is tough tough tough, so I have to be more picky than I want to.

I think I had the yellowtail, red snapper and flounder.  Everything was very fresh, and was presented beautifully.  \\n\\nThe calamari was very tender and not chewy or served in the way you typically get calamari rings.  More of a calamari steak cut in small bite sized pieces served with a savory sweet barbecue like sauce.  Very nice appetizer.\\n\\nThe nigiri was a good size and super fresh and reasonably priced.  The rolls were all tasty, and the wildflower i'd say, was the most unique as it was spring roll wrapped and with mango giving it more of a sweetness than the other rolls.  \\n\\nThe spicy sauce had a nice kick on it with the other 2 rolls and both were delicious.

Save your dollars from having to park on the side street if you can.\\n\\nBefore you read further - take a look at the photos I've supplied for this review.  You'll see:\\n\\n1) Miso soup\\n2) Edamame\\n3) Mango roll(that I'm pretty sure that's what she told us it is)\\n4) Salad + greens\\n5) Two orders of pop(not pictured, but that's fine)\\n6) Chicken Yakisoba\\n\\nSo that constitutes a \\"dinner for two\\".  How much do you think all that comes to?\\n\\nDid you answer somewhere in the neighbourhood of $35 - $40?  If so - you're a great estimator, because that's exactly what we paid for this, on the Groupon offer(more on that in a minute).\\n\\nThe main theme of the day for these dishes is well...a combination of mediocre, quantity-over-quality and way, WAY too much mayonnaise. I think the the mayo was particularly cheap that week(not subject to tariffs *wink wink*), because they just totally slathered it on the salad and the rolls.   It's a LOT more mayonnaise than what the photos might suggest.\\n\\nOut of all the dishes, the chicken yakisoba was probably the best one, with a peppery flavour(which we needed to cut out the taste of the mayonnaise) and reasonably well cooked, not too hard and chewy, it was about right...with yakisoba noodles which were fine.\\n\\nThe miso soup had an over-abundance of onion on it and this is one of the very few times that it was bad enough that I actually had about half, and pushed it aside.  As for the Edamame...it's fine, but you can't screw that up.  At this point I have over mentioned the presence of a certain ingredient so I'll keep it short with the rolls.  They were quite simply bad.\\n\\nAnd finally we reach the end of our journey here, with the bill.  So the way it works is, when you pay for a Groupon, you still owe the tax + tip at the table.  So get this - the total for all those items came to a colossal $57 dollars.  So according to the bill, that Groupon \\"dinner for two\\", had you ordered all the items sans Groupon, would have been north of $50 bucks.\\n\\nLook at the photos again.  Does that look to you, a meal worth over $55 bucks?  The miso soups are maybe a $1.50 each, the edamame which is complimentary in many other establishments.  So that leaves the rolls, the salad + sushi, and the chicken yakisoba.  I know what you're thinking...maybe they inflated the value on the bill just for show(and to make me pay a little more for the tax).\\n\\nIn truth - this is one of the many instances where, what we've paid on the Groupon is actually what the meal was really worth - there was no magical \\"discount\\" or extra value of any kind.  This is the conceit of the whole Groupon thing, especially when it comes to restaurants.  In the end this place is at best average, OK to come to if you happen to live in the area.  But I wouldn't come here for just for the sake of doing so."},{"name":"Small Pharoah's","address":"340 SW 5th St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"My wife and I were hungry after an extended happy hour down the street and stumbled upon this little cart serving tasty and filling gyros.

There's many great things to say about this place. It's extremely creative and the atmosphere is fantastic.  It feels like being a blue collar factory workers kitchen.  Food is served on metal trays, shop rags are used as napkins, and there's old production line machines around the rooms for context.  Very cool concept and a fun place to be. It's clean, spacious, and has well kept bathrooms.\\n\\nFood wise it's also pretty good, although my experience wasn't as great as the group I was with. While Tilt is known for making awesome hamburgers, their veggie burger needs some work.  I'm glad to order a veggie burger, my usual option in a meat heavy restaurant, totally fine.  Tilt makes a nice house made patty, full of peppers, corn, etc. It's a little mushy, but no worries.  It's topped with the usual BLT combo and mayo.  The trouble is, while it makes a great picture, the massive hunk of iceberg lettuce just makes it hard to eat.  they use quality bread buns, but it all falls apart very quickly, leaving a huge pile of mush and lettuce on the plate.  \\n\\nI know it wouldn't keep with the \\"blue collar\\" theme, but using some basic greens or even romaine lettuce would make this a much better burger and easier to eat. At $9 for a meatless burger, you would expect better, especially when it comes with no sides!!!  They do offer a great plate of beer battered fries, easily shared by a group. Light, crispy, and full of flavor.  Other varieties include fries with pork gravy smothered over, tater tots, etc.\\n\\nTilt really suffers from lack of service, and that's where it loses stars from me in a hurry.  'There is no table service, you order and pickup yourself with the use of a buzzer.  For the price of their food, table service should be included.  Also, their workers don't exactly have the best attitude.  I sat at my table for waiting for our group to arrive, and when the girl working the bar came to collect the leftover glasses, she couldn't even bother to say 'hello', 'welcome', or anything at all.  Totally ignored me!!!  Doesn't exactly make me want to make me order beers or bother to tip well accordingly.  Ordering and picking up food I wasn't really pleased with the snippy behavior of staff either. Not so much as a hello or thank you.  You've got to be kidding, and with only one person taking orders the line was a 15 minute wait.  Certainly you could figure out a better system during high traffic times.\\n\\nOverall, this is a great place to meet up with friends and grab burgers.  No way I would consider this a good date place or even bring a group again.  Loud background music and a strange disconnect between staff and customers is a huge turnoff.  It almost feels like they really don't care if you come back.  However you have to decide for yourself and I would encourage you to try it out and see.

I discovered this place from browsing Yelp one day because I was tired of the options we had around here and wanted something close by. I'm so glad I found Sushi Yoi because I don't think I'll ever go to Sushi Garden ever again.\\n\\nHighlights:\\n- Their toro was great; seared toro is $1.75/piece which, in my opinion, is quite reasonable. Toro is my favourite type of sashimi so this is a huge plus for me.\\n- They have a great all-day special where you get to pick 3 items from their list for $10.45 and you receive a miso soup with that combo as well. This time, we picked Tuna Nigiri (3pcs), Salmon Nigiri (3 pcs), and a Spicy Tuna Roll.\\n- They have really good pressed sushi! FINALLY we don't have to go all the way to Kishimoto or Miku/Minami for good pressed sushi! I would say that it is very good but probably not to the standards of Kishimoto/Miku/Minami yet, but it's pretty darn close and for literally a fraction of the price.\\n- Service was decent! I liked all the servers that we came across and they were all happy to help out.\\n- Even the decor was creative - this place was definitely unique and seating was very comfortable.\\n\\nNeedless to say, I'm a huge fan.

This place was so good that I ordered from here 2 days in a row, and you should too! I got it delivered, but apparently, if you eat in the restaurant, you DONT have to pay tip because it's essentially self-serve. \\n\\nThe lunch specials include the entree, a salad, two appetizers, and a drink.\\n\\nENTREE 1: Drunken noodles + chicken ($10.12 + $0.99) - The noodles were really flavorful and a bit spicy, so expect to be drinking a lot of water during this meal. Noodles aren't really my thing, so I took a risk when I ordered this but I was pleasantly surprised, with the taste but especially with the quantity! 7/10\\n\\nAPPETIZER 1.1: Blueberry crab rangoon - It has a very unique taste. It's similar to eating fried yogurt, if you've ever had that before. I was hesitant on getting it, but I was happy that I chose it. A unique twist to a classic American-Chinese appetizer. 8/10\\n\\nAPPETIZER 1.2: Triple C - This is your standard crab rangoon. Filling seemed to consist mainly of cream. Not bad overall. 6.5/10\\n\\nDRINK 1: Thai iced tea - A bit too sweet for me, but the taste was pretty good. 7.5/10\\n_____\\n\\nENTREE 2: Street noodle soup ($10.12) - The soup is very different from the soups that I've had. It is extremely SOUR, to such an extent that dipping your spoon into it to drink the soup is something that you don't really want to do.. but they do give you a lot, so I do give them props for that. 5/10\\n\\nAPPETIZER 2.1: Fried shumai - Your standard fried shumai. Pretty good. 6.5/10\\n\\nAPPETIZER 2.2: Shrimp toast - I'm not sure that it actually contained any shrimp. It might've just been the shrimp powder (like on the Asian shrimp crackers) but it was pretty good. They stuff the toast with it. 7/10\\n\\nDRINK 2: Thai iced coffee - According to my girlfriend, she said that it was better than average, and she loves coffee so I think you can take her word for it. 7.5/10\\n______\\n\\nENTREE 3: Pho beef ($10.12) - It's a little less tastier than the pho at Le's, and the noodles that they provide aren't the best quality but for this price, you can't beat it (keeping in mind it includes other things as well). It's not the worst pho I've had, and I'd gladly drink the warm broth. 6.5/10\\n\\nAPPETIZER 3.1: Fried dumpling - Your standard fried dumpling. Nuff said. 6.5/10\\n\\nAPPETIZER 3.2: Green bermuda triangle - I'm still quite unsure what this is.. but it's like a veggie scallion pancake that they molded into a triangle. Pretty tasty if I do say so myself. 7/10\\n\\nDRINK 3: Iced Taro - It taste like a taro slushie from Kung Fu Tea but without the iced blended into the drink. It does taste somewhat artificial.. so beware when ordering this drink! 5.5/10\\n______\\n\\nENTREE 4: Kimchi fried rice + crispy chicken ($10.12 + $1.50) - MAKE SURE TO GET THE CRISPY CHICKEN. It's basically a chicken katsu, and for a price of only $1.50, it's definitely so worth it to get it. The kimchi fried rice was yummy. Lots of kimchi in every bite, but I don't think it's wise to pay $10 for some rice and kimchi.. but that's on me. It was really good nonetheless 8.5/10\\n\\nAPPETIZER 4.1/4.2: Repeats of the blueberry crab rangoon and the shrimp toast. The taste was very consistent with the first time that I ate it.\\n\\nDRINK 4: Iced Pinky - Not sure what this is but IT TASTES SO BADDD. It tastes extremely artificial. It's like you mixed a cherry jolly rancher with corn syrup.. I STRONGLY advise AGAINST getting this drink. 1.5/10\\n______\\n\\nIf you order delivery, they also ask you for additional items you want at no cost, such as: utensils, soy sauce, duck sauce, straws, napkins, salt and pepper, and APPARENTLY fortune cookies (I NEVER GOT ONE).\\n______\\n\\nWORTH IT? This place gives you SO MUCH FOOD. I think that it's one of the most-worth places in Boston to go eat at. Make sure you try this place out! Also, if you use Yelp24, you can get it delivered to your place with a $5 code. And make sure you try the lunch special! And get the crispy chicken!!"},{"name":"Tea Haus","address":"10815 Ranch Road 2222, Ste 207","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Best bubble tea I've ever had!

It's a legit 15 min walk in the cold but it's worth it.\\nLunch combo continue to be too damn affordable and amazing. \\nNew menu items are added all the time.\\n\\nSo since last time I've added to my belly:\\nStreet Noddle Soup - like a soupy cousin of pad thai, very sweet, warning diabetics. Flavor is bomb really good. Although I'm not into hard boil egg in my soup so I should have ask to skippy. Their portion is gigantic so I can't really finish it without regreting at the gym later. But for those days you want to carb out, this is perfect. \\nShibuya Street Noodle - it's ok, not my favorite. I love dry style noodle. I inhale Mi goreng instant packets on the daily. But taste similar to that, with meat but I still like my instant MG more :/ So it's only an ok.\\nSahara noodle - another dry noodle style. The taste doesn't wow me, since I've had better (per my review of Pad Thai Cafe's Ba mee song kruang). I think it's the sauce as it's not as impactful and I would like. I like to get kick in the teeth w/ spiciness. So maybe that's just my preference.\\n\\nAppetizer:\\nThe lunch special offer a lot of ways to explore their appetizer menu. \\nTo date, the crab blueberry rangoon have been consistently amazing. Food Purist might be offended by the fresh new take on crab rangoon but those who like to try new things will really love this. Just the right amount of sweetness, saltiness, creaminess in one perfect bite.\\nShrimp toast is still just as awesome. It's a great bite. \\nSeaweed salad is really good as well. The portion they give you for a side with your lunch special is HEAPING. It's HUGE. I can get full on that amount of seaweed salad alone. But can't even help myself because it's addicting.\\nBut my new true favorite is the GREEN BERMUDA TRIANGLE. Vegetarian, fried to perfection, chivey goodness. Literally could be downing these all day with no regrets.\\n\\nIced green tea is a great drink. It's not pow pow with the matcha flavor so some people might complaint, but it's perfect for me. It's super sweet with a hint of green tea, taste like dessert. It's my new thai ice tea! I attempted to ask what the \\"Iced Pinky\\" mean and she said it taste like bubblegum and I was too scared to order that but if anyone have try it lemme know if you like it! XD\\n\\nWhat's also exceptional is the service. Yes you serve your self.

The man was very knowledgeable and helpful and I didn't feel rushed at all.  My only complaint is that the lamb meat in my gyro was not shaved from a rotisserie like it has been at every other Mediterranean place I've eaten, it was very thinly sliced, pre-packaged cold cut style meat. It really changed the flavor. All of the other ingredients were fresh and delicious so I was a little bummed to see him whip out those thin frozen strips of meat when preparing my sandwich.\\n\\nA few weeks ago, the owner contacted me and told me that they had read this review and had made the decision to start using fresh lamb instead of the cold cut style meat. This is great news and from some of the photos I've looked at, the gyros look absolutely amazing now. I can't wait until my next trip to Portland so that I can stop in and have one. If they taste as good as they look, I will definitely be re-editing this review afterwards.\\n\\nSo far, I've been back to Portland twice and both times, I've stopped by Zaalook to try the new meat. The first time, it was early in the day and I didn't realize that their hours are 8pm to 3am. Last night I tried again at about 9:25pm and they were closed again. I only make it to Portland from Seattle a few times a month at that so I guess I'll have to keep trying. I was pretty disappointed that they were closed because I really wanted a gyro but not from any other place. We settled for On Deck Sports bar just a few blocks away and that made me really wish that Zaalook had been open. Oh well. Maybe next time.\\n\\nI finally made it back to Zaalook when they were open and I got to order the lamb gyro. Just as the owner said in the message to me, they have changed their ways and started using real lamb meat. Everything else about the gyro was the same. Quality ingredients but it still didn't taste right. Instead of the traditional lamb/beef combo meat that cooks all day on a rotisserie, they are using roasted lamb meat. Don't get me wrong, the meat did taste good but it just isn't right in my opinion on the gyro not to mention that they seem to use very little of it to stretch their profits. I wasn't lucky enough to have a little meat in each bite of my gyro. It's definitely way better than the cold cut meat they were using before but still a let down after trying so many times to go back and update my review. With so many other places to try in the downtown Portland area, I'm afraid that I won't be going back to Zaalook for a very long time if ever. If ever the owners of Zaalook are in Washington, make a point to stop by a place in Tacoma called It's Greek To Me located at 1702 6th Ave, Tacoma, WA 98405\\n(253) 272-1375.

But, while the gnocchi was amazing pillows of dough from heaven, the other dishes were just okay. The angel hair with the frutti di mare was overcooked for my liking, and the sauce was bland - the dish looked so much better than it tasted. The mushroom rigatoni was super tasty, but it was so heavy/oily that eating this for a meal crossed the line from decadent deliciousness to sorry-I-ordered-it-sinful.

The total food bill was $40 plus an additional $15 for two beers. Would I go here again and would I recommend it to others?, probably not unless you can get through without an hour wait, then it would be worth a try.

Food-wise it's generally the same as the other location. The menu seemed to be identical. This location seemed to have more seating, or perhaps felt more open. It was less loud as their kitchen is separated so sounds don't really escape from there. The decor was also really nice and hip, I thought it seemed a bit more modern than the other location. Service was really friendly and they definitely tried to give us attention and make sure our experience was a good one.\\n\\nTheir toppings are as good as always!! They have many different combinations of toppings on the menu so it is always a challenge deciding what exactly you want. I was deciding between the spicy mazesoba and zenbu mazesoba, however I wasn't feeling hungry enough that day so I went with the former. The spicy mazesoba is great as it includes the minced pork, cube pork cha shu, chili flakes, and seaweed flakes. If it's not already spicy enough for you, you can always add more chili flakes on top! I always leave a lot of sauce cha shu pieces at the end, so I can mix it in with the rice they give you after you finish your noodles. I love going here every once in a while as it is not really something that I can eat too often, it's pretty greasy and doesn't necessarily make you feel healthy afterwards. It's so good though, so it's worth it going every so often.\\n\\nMy brother is a picky eater so he wasn't feeling adventurous enough to try the mazesoba and ordered the tonkotsu ramen. I've never tried the brothy ramen here, but I tasted it and the broth was very rich and delicious. This dish seems to be a good option when I'm not quite feeling the greasiness of mazesoba. The donburi bowls are also a good option when I'm feeling something a bit less greasy!\\n\\nThe flavours in the mazesoba might not be everyone's cup of tea, but I do think it is worth checking out because if you like it, you'll be hooked!"},{"name":"Abby Lane","address":"255 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Came for lunch and would certainly return.

After waiting about 5 mins someone finally greeted us and we were told that we could be seated but it would be at least 15 minutes before someone could help us. We decided to wait it out since our usual experiences were great but that should have been our first warning to run. After about 17 mins we placed our food and drink order. We went with unlimited mimosas since those are usually the same price as 2 and we can usually do 3 during brunch. The mimosas were awful. All juice and so sweet it was almost sickening. We didn't even have enough to pay for the \\"unlimited\\", they were that bad. The last one didn't even have bubbles in it and they weren't even filled to the top of the champagne flute. I ordered a BLT which was supposed to come with mayo... no mayo, 4 slices of bacon and maybe slightly toasted bread, I ate less than half of it. The au jus for the French dip was literally clear with some seasoning at the bottom, it tasted more like seasoned water.

We have tried all manner of restaurants. There are the fancy chi-chi places, the places that really enjoy making fusion-y rolls, the places that have Korean influences in the flavoring, the holes in the wall, the buffets, and many more. But Jade stands out above all the rest as top quality, authentic, fresh Japanese style sushi.  \\n\\nIn the art of making sushi , there are two elements that really make or break the quality of the whole: \\"Shari\\" is the rice component. It needs to be not too soft and not too hard. There should be just the right proportion of rice to fish, there should be the right proportion of vinegar to rice, and the rice should be served slightly warm, like the temperature of your skin (this is really what the Japanese word for that right temp translates to).  \\n\\nThen\\"tane\\" is the fish component. The raw fish should be of ultimate freshness, you want a high quality cut of the fish, the right part of the fish, and the fish should be cut at just the right angle and thickness to accentuate the natural flavors.\\n\\nSo here is why my mom and I love Jade - Unlike most places we've tried, Jade gets the tane AND the shari correct.  This perfect balance makes for some pretty darn awesome sushi.  In addition to delicious nigiri, we actually love the Chirashi don dish the best (both lunch and dinner), because there are so many different varieties of fish at their freshest with lots of the fabulous Shari done just right. My mom says every time we go to Jade, that Parker must've been trained very well by authentic chefs to know how to do both so well.  We have a wonderful meal every time.  Check out some of the other delicious dishes too! Spicy miso ramen, Singapore mei-fun, the chicken wings, the Chinese dishes! We love this place.

If you have a craving for a lamb gyro, this is not the place to go. I'm all for creativity with chefs, but NOT if this isn't even suggested by the menu. Ingredients I'd normally find in soup (carrots, celery, cauliflower, etc.) should NOT be in a gyro. Or, if it is, there should be some expectation of this set up.\\n\\nNo thick dill sauce on top of that crap. And hummus. I'm allergic to sesame seeds, so I don't eat hummus. I know the common things in a gyro, so I didn't think to ask for no hummus since hummus (along with cauliflower, carrots, and celery) is not normally in a gyro.\\n\\nI'm all for inventiveness, but not without warning, and not when gyro expectations are pretty straight-forward wherever one goes. Had I wanted something new, I would have sought it out. Instead, I had lamb covered in something I'm allergic to, surrounded by vegetables I wasn't in the mood for, and my craving for a gyro still stands.\\n\\nVery disappointed. Throwing away a big ball of crap wrapped in foil. This reminded me more of the stew I hated as a kid than a good gyro food truck experience.\\n\\nIf you like the unexpected, this is the place for you. If you've got a hankering for a traditional gyro, go to the stand at the opposite end at SW 5th and Oak.\\n\\nThis gyro was not a gyro, and it sucked.\\n\\nEDIT:\\n\\nI would like to share that Yelp notified me that I had a new \\"fan,\\" and then I immediately received a private message:\\n\\nHi Tara, Islam E. sent you a message on Yelp:\\nSubject: Can you please remove your review from small pharaoh\\n\\"And you should tell that you have illergic\\"[sic]\\n\\nAlthough I don't really appreciate someone becoming fan in order to message me, here's my reply:\\nMy review is accurate. The gyro was non-standard and not good. As I pointed out in the review, the food item I am allergic to is not a standard item in a gyro. They're was no need to mention my allergy, as hummus is not a standard gyro component. And my complaint has more to do with the non-standard ingredients than the allergy. The review is accurate, and I'm keeping it up.\\n\\nAND ANOTHER EDIT:\\nI received the following message from another Yelper who has only reviewed another food cart in the same food pod. I suspect he's another food cart owner or a friend of the original guy. He posted a glowing review of the same food item I criticized a few hours after I did. And then sent this:\\n\\nRon E.    Hey my bitch\\nHow are you today? Clean your pussy I am coming to put my drill in it\\n\\nYou know, it would be nice if the food cart person could either just shrug off one unhappy customer or just say they're sorry I didn't like the food, and either let it go at that or ask me to try them again and consider revising my review based on another try. And I probably would have tried some other dish. Instead, I'm having to block users, report that guy who messaged me, and watch my credit card statements--because the cart owner has sicced some guy named Ron on me with sick messages, so nothing is beneath him as far as I can tell.\\n\\nBased on the owner's follow up message and this guy Ron E's message, I suspect some of the positive reviews for this cart are bought or by friends. In any case, a person should be able to criticize without being personally attacked in a sick manner like Ron E's message above.\\n\\nBUT WAIT! THERE'S MORE!\\nIt's clear that Islam (the owner) still doesn't quite understand my original review or that continuing a negative conversation does him more harm than good. But here's some more of the saga if you aren't bored yet:\\n\\nIslam E: \\"What did you write here in my business. I am the owner. And my name is Islam. No one here called Ron. Could you please remove this shit from my web page and solve your problems with your friends.\\"\\n\\nRon is the guy who wrote the vulgar stuff above AND a five-star review praising the thing I criticized, so while I don't think Ron works with Islam, I suspect that Islam complained about my review to Ron. In any case, Islam seems to think a Yelp page is his web page. It's not. It's a consumer page ABOUT consumer interaction with his business. Not from his business. But you wouldn't know that by the five-star review Islam gave himself (!!!) where he talks about me by name and suggests that Ron might be my boyfriend, which is pretty illogical considering that that Ron guy loves the things I hate!\\n\\nAnyway, I hope you find this review useful.\\n\\nThe owner's five-star review (an appalling abuse of the system): \\n5.0 star rating 4/22/2014 4 photos\\nHi.

The boy and I were doing a classy pub crawl/progressive happy hour with Black Point being stop number 4. It was 2 days before NYE and around 5 pm so most of the establishments that we visited were a little slow on customers, with BP being no different.  Sometimes bartenders can seem a bit bothered by your presence when things are slow, but this was not the case here - The bartender was just the right amount of friendly without being weird (you know what I mean). I got a pear cocktail that came with a little dry ice, and I am a sucker for smoke and mirrors so bravo there - and it tasted good too! \\n\\nThe best was yet to come with the happy hour appetizers though. We ordered the jalape√±o tuna roll and the truffle deviled eggs. Both cost around $5 and were an amazing value!  The tuna roll was not one of those dainty 4 piece rolls - it was a mammoth 8 -10 piece (I can't recall exactly due to the wasabi high) roll covered in avocado. It was phemons.  The deviled eggs were even better than the sushi. You get 6 nice size egg halves with a filling that most assuredly contains essence of unicorn tears.  Excellent salt balance and a truffle flavor to flip for! \\n\\nWe had such a good time on our prestigious pub crawl that we decided to spend the next night there to celebrate my birthday. When making the reservation, we let them know we were celebrating and there was a handwritten card on the table the next night - nice touch! \\nSo fast forward to Bday dinner: The chef brought us a tasty tuna and avocado amuse bouche to start the meal, it was a quick stop on the way to round 2 of my deviled eggs.  We perused the menu pretty quickly because the surf and turf special seemed absolutely perfect.  You start with the crab bisque or a salad, 8 oz filet with a lobster crab cake or seared scallops and a dessert of chocolate or cheesecake.  I think I remember them saying that the surf and turf special changed seasonally so it could vary on future visit. I was pleasantly surprised to see the scallop pairing as an option, since I've been known to say that I'd propose to a perfectly seared sea scallop if mollusk marriage was legal. But I digress. . . \\n\\nI ordered the wedge salad, filet/scallops and chocolate bomb. The fianc√© got the crab bisque, same entr√©e and the salted caramel cheesecake. First course: The wedge was pretty classic except it was served with a French dressing rather than something like blue cheese. Being that I would name my first born child \\"Ranch\\" I would have preferred something of the white varietal but it did the French did pair well with the other ingredients. The crab bisque was the real star. It was basically like a bowl of crab with an afterthought of bisque, which is to say it was perfect. \\nThe filets were cooked perfectly, his, a respectable medium rare and mine practically mooing.  The scallops were also cooked perfectly and very large to accompany the 8 oz filet.  Neither of us could finish our steaks and took them to go (see also: breakfast of champions) \\n\\nWe also got the desserts to go which I was worried would hinder the flavor/overall blissful sugar experience but they were excellent the next day (see also: breakfast of champions part 2). The chocolate ganache was very rich but full of chocolate flavor and not just basic sweet on sweet.  The cheesecake was more on the savory side (I mean not like a turkey leg savory, but much more so than the sweet  bomb of chocolate). \\nWithout even tasting the food I thought the $42 price tag for this meal was a deal but after eating it, I truly can't believe the price. Neither flavor nor ingredient was skimped! \\n\\nI also had a glass (yes just 1 glass which is unprecedented for me, but please see previous day's classy pug crawl, and current day's classy hangover) of red wine. The glass I did have paired perfectly with the filet. It was a red blend coming in at $18 a glass which is a little more than I normally spend.  If I am going to spend $18 on something it is going to be dinner for 2 at Boston Market, or an oil change, or a couple of 3 wick candles at an after Christmas sale or . . . OK I think you get it. Regardless it was the blend featured in a 1 page add (see wine. drink wine) in the back of the menu. I give it an A+.  \\n\\nThe servers were very attentive and accommodating. They remembered us from the prior day (and not because I danced on the table. . . this time) and after a second trip there, we already felt like regulars.  Isaac introduced himself toward the end of dinner and let us know if we ever needed anything when we came back, to ask for him and he would make sure we were taken care of.  I'll have to admit we felt very VIP. \\n\\nOverall 5 I have nothing to complain about and I was continuously surprised, that is a 5 star experience."},{"name":"Hopdoddy Burger Bar","address":"9101 International Dr, Ste 1208","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Yaassss!!

You see, I was on a no drinking binge.  And, I must say, I was a bit tempted to imbibe at New Jumbo, buuut, I had one sip of my fiance's chardonnay (and I don't even like Chardonnay).  I had to get a sip of something because their food is a bit on the greasy/salty side.  It is not a bad thing, but I have definitely had better Chinese in places other than Chinatown.  We had a table for 8, no reservation and of course, I was the first to arrive.  Always am.  That's just how I roll.  \\n\\nI met Larry, the very friendly host and probably owner.  I also waited for about 10 minutes while he set up the table for our party.  I hung out right near their bathroom and lobster/miscellaneous crustacean tank.

It took awhile for us to get our check to close. \\n\\nIt was a fun experience for date night, but TBH I make a pretty bomb cheese plate and I think buying 3 bottles of wine for $40 instead is probably what we'd typically opt for.

With little kids -- waiting that long was torture. We were pulling out every trick trying to keep them from being a nuisance. We asked for the kids food as soon as possible, but they only brought part of it and had to go back to get more. At least the food was tasty. I do think the chef knows what they are doing.

It is served with a parmigiano cheese crisp on top and a thin toasted bread crisp at the bottom - if you're a cheese lover, you'll really like this!\\nThe pastas are made in house! The gnocchi were cooked perfectly and the flavours were vibrant. The truffle pasta was amazing! A super simple dish, but if you're a truffle lover, I highly recommend...they bring the truffles to the table and shave them onto your pasta, right in front of you, in what I would consider to be a generous amount!\\nWhile the orange almond cake probably isn't their most popular choice, I really loved the flavours of the dessert. The cake was extremely moist and the citrus flavour was just what I needed to round out a richly flavoured dinner. \\nWe enjoyed Prosecco by the glass, some burrowing owl white Chardonnay, and for our anniversary, they topped us off at the end of the meal with complimentary ice cold moscato - we thought this was a really nice and refreshing touch! \\nOverall, it was a wonderful experience and a place for special occasions, celebrations, or intimate date night. I would definitely go back and recommend to others! Thank you Lupo!"},{"name":"Dexter's Windermere","address":"4757 The Grove Dr, Ste 100","city":"Windermere","stars":"3","text":"I love this place.

For the better part of a week, my wife and I have been stuck at the hospital as we waited for the induction to do its thing and introduce us to our son. Well, about two days into our adventure, we had become absolutely sick of hospital food, and found ourselves craving soup. Particularly of the flavorful Asian variety. Pho was considered. As was hot and sour. Finally, we decided that Thai was the ticket. \\n\\nWe settled on Thai Bloom, since they're well-regarded and close to the hospital. I ordered my usual Tom Yum, and the mother-to-be went with a prawn wonton soup. We chose well. \\n\\nThe food was ready exceptionally quickly. This, by no means meant that corners were cut. The tom yum was among the best i have ever had. Every ingredient played its part flawlessly. It was tangy, it had the right amount of heat, zing from the galangal, lemon grass, and kafir lome leaves. The mushrooms acted like savory little sponges for the broth, and the grape tomatoes were little flavor bombs full of juice and broth. I tend to avoid raw tomatoes and I gobble these up with gusto. I went with chicken for the protein. The noble fowl's sacrifice was not in vain, the chef cooked it up to the point where it was just almost tough, but not to the point of inedibility. Like everything else, the meat was a repository of amazing broth, each bite releasing its unique flavor.\\n\\nThe prawn wonton soup was no slouch, either. Again, the broth was the star of the show. This was a more subtle show than the tom yum. It was more of a balance of savory flavors than anything else, and it was amazing. Garlic seemed to be the predominant flavor, and it should be, because it worked very well. The prawns were fresh and tender, and the wontons were as good as any that I have had.\\nMaybe I'm not being as objective as I would like, but Thai Bloom has my vote not only for making great food quickly and inexpensively, but also for helping add a bit of a bright spot to our weekend.\\n\\nTL;DR: Go here. Get soup. Feel better."},{"name":"Newcomb Farms Family Restaurant","address":"1139 Randolph Ave","city":"Milton","stars":"4","text":"Thought we would give this place a try...disgusting.

There were 5 workers on duty and we still had to wait to be serviced; no one came to the register.  We ordered 2 pizzas and cheesy bread.  The one pizza and cheesy bread was brought to our table, but the second pizza didn't come. We thought we'd wait a bit to see if it was still cooking.  After 5-10 minutes after the first pizza was received, we asked about the second pizza.  Found out that no one was working on it.  Apparently the order didn't come through??  None of the 5 workers knew what happened.  So one of the workers attended to the issue and made the pizza.  On top of that, the first pizza was made incorrectly as it was missing a topping (ricotta).  But to not create even more of a scene, we decided not to bring it up.  We were over it and this pizza shop.  Best advice, try the pizza shop down the street."},{"name":"Silver's Delight","address":"2879 E Point St","city":"East Point","stars":"3","text":"The jerk chicken and rice is dry and the portions suck!!

The bark has tons of flavor, the meat is rich, and every bite makes you question how do they do this so well? Great stuff from beginning to last piece.\\n-Sausage is a winner, I know some don't think of BBQ sausage as something to get but you will want a link or two. \\n-Pulled pork was the last meat I got and was delicious, I would say the other two items were better than this.

Erin go Bragh! \\n\\nOwned by Kathy Day and Rick an Lisa Boyd, the restaurant opened in 2007. In 2017 they were able to purchase the building. The restaurant is made up of two rooms. The room we were in, Celt had a bar, TV's to watch soccer, and tables. Obama stopped by for a beer in the Celt during his 2011 campaign tour. The room that connects next door, Harp also has a bar and 19th century style booths created that were created from wood from 1923. In the early 1900's the building was a brothel. It is said to be haunted by the ghosts of Max, the caretaker of the brothel, a middle aged woman, and a young boy. Kathy kindly let me look at The Harp even though it was closed. I asked her about the ghost stories and she told me that her partner has heard footsteps. I asked Kathy if she had ever directly experienced anything and she replied that she had not as she would not come over at night alone. I love a place with history and a ghost! \\n\\nAlthough I have been drooling over the pictures of cottage pie my daughter has been sending me we both decided on the Reuben sandwich and we were not disappointed.

Such an occasion was delivered, and I along with a group of five others descended down upon Contigo with empty stomachs and high expectations.  Early enough to hit up happy hour, we had a fantastic experience all around, from the service and ambiance to the wide variety of dishes.\\n\\nIt was 6pm on a Thursday, and one of the first piece of advice was to get their Thursday-special: fried chicken legs.  It was a limited amount and our party cleared out the last 11 in their inventory (sorry).  The chicken was truly fantastic.  The meat itself was just seasoned enough so that you get to taste the chicken in its purest form without it being bland.  There was just a small layer of the breading, but it was enough to get a nice crunch.  I guess the word to describe it was minimalistic (that's a word, right?).  It just felt and tasted fresh and not coated with grease.  Another round of appetizers included their Ox Tongue Sliders.  Overall it was only okay.  It was a bit on the smaller side as it was a two-biter.  The meat was well seasoned, but lacked the amount of fat that I was expecting from ox tongue.\\n\\nWith a stomach already satisfied, out came the Rabbit & Dumplings.  This selection was motivated mostly from curiosity.  I wasn't sure what to expect from rabbit meat and, spoiler alert, it was pretty similar to chicken meat.  Specifically, chicken breast meat.  There were a few nice tender and fatty pieces, but I probably wouldn't have been able to tell the difference.  Nevertheless, the flavors were good.  The biscuits did a great job soaking in all the sauce and juices and the amount of food was perfect.\\n\\nContigo gave the impression of knowing what it's like to make good food, so even though what I got was just okay, I can see myself coming back and trying their other options.

I love my milk tea hot and not alot of places in Austin that will do it. Hot milk tea gives me memories of the motherland! So when i heard from Errol that this place will do it, i was all over it. I have been back now three times for their hot boba milk tea. The first time I was very disappointed that my cup was only filled up to like 70% full. I felt a bit ripped off but the tea was so delicious and I wasnt sure of the norm so I didn't say anything.\\n\\nSecond and third time my cups were actually filled so that's how I knew my first visit wasn't the norm. This is easily the most delicious hot boba milk tea in town. The boba is warm and the right amount of chewy and bounce. The milk tea is smooth and soothing! On the 2nd trip, my milk tea was SUPER hot, so I actually had to wait a bit before sipping. I think now that I have found the right sweetness and temperature level I can give them more instructions on how to get my milk tea right. \\n\\nTea Haus, I will be back.

It's not like the waiter was busy, I could never find him when I looked up and could see that the other couples felt the same.\\n\\n2. Drinks: Forget about asking for caipirinhas, might as well as for straight up cachaca or vodka. No flavor whatsoever\\n\\n3. Meats: There was only one meat runner and he was barely passing by. Only served Picanha, pineapple, chicken wrapped in bacon, and sausage... seriously that's it.\\n\\n4. Food: Food was tasty but badly presented (This one is dumb I guess)\\n\\n5.

This was the 2nd place (Micklethwait's being the first) that I tried. My friend from San Antonio had also been wanting to check it out, so we waited a little over an hour to try brisket and pulled pork.  Unfortunately, if you're wanting ribs or sausage, you've got to get there when they first open b/c they pretty much sell out of those items within the first hour or two.  We also ordered the slaw and potatoe salad sides.  The brisket was good, but still too fatty for me.  I really am not a fatty meat person, so I think all the brisket I tried between both this spot and Micklethwait's was just too much fat for one person to consume in good conscious and think it tastes delicious but clearly several people have no problems with it!  Perhaps it really just depends on the cuts of meat you get, but I did find this brisket to be better than the one from Micklethwaits.  However, between the 2 places, that's the only item of meat that I tried that was the same besides sides.  Sides here were definitely a huge disappointment for me.  Bread is store bought and nothing special, it actually doesn't necessarily taste better than Wonder bread but perhaps it's good for soaking up alcohol for hangovers?  The slaw was very unique and super spicy, which I generally like, but I guess in the traditional ideas of what coleslaw should be, I found it to be offputting and unappealing.  I'm all for thinking out of the box, but this slaw just seemed completely random and ill-fitting to the meal. The flavor profile just didn't seem to match. The potatoe salad was ok, but again, I found the sides to be something I'd definitely skip in the future.  There's a large dining area with benches but really nothing else in this lot but it is located on Cesar Chavez and close to East 6th so you can definitely venture to grab other items, drinks, beers or shop after a meal. One thing I would highly encourage is a different ordering system.  You wait in line and order and you stand there until you pick up the food. Then you move to a 2nd window around the side to pay. Although people will wait, I think allowing people to order and pickup food when it's ready would be more efficient and customer-friendly."},{"name":"Hot Rod Coffee Trailer","address":"6546 Burnet Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"5","text":"I really dug this coffee shop.

Without a doubt, one of the best vegan places in the area. Let me elaborate a bit more... \\n\\nI discovered this place on a Friday for dinner, and then I felt compelled to come back on Sunday for brunch and again on Monday for brunch (it was a long weekend). This is what we ate during the three pilgrimages to this fantastic diner:\\n\\n.- Buffalo Chick'n Tenders: Perfect appetizer. How does it taste? Well, exactly like any other buffalo chicken tenders that you order in any other good place. The difference? Yes... this is vegan!\\n\\n.- Poutine: I am a fan of poutine... I discovered it years ago when I first visited Montreal and I loved it ever since. I honestly thought it was not possible to create a successful vegan poutine but... I was wrong!! This appetizer was excellent. I don't know if the flavor is exactly the same... But... Who cares! It's simply amazing! Try it, you won't regret! \\n\\n.- Chicken Cutlet Sandwich: That was a special so... I am quite sad with the possibility that I won't be able to order it again since it won't be available any more... Once again, that was fantastic... I think that I never enjoyed a chicken sandwich that much even when I was still a carnivore and I ate real chicken... As a side I ordered their potato salad and I discovered something: potato salads can be addictive! \\n\\n.- Reuben Sandwich: When I first bit it I wanted to stand and yell to the waitress: \\"You made a huge mistake! You gave me a real reuben with real corned beef!\\" Luckily I did not... because that was just another example of their talent. When I switched my diet to a plant based diet I assumed I would not be able to enjoy my favorite sandwich anymore: the reuben! Well... Now I know that that was not right. I can still have it at Veggie Galaxy. THANKS!\\n\\n.- Oreo Cheesecake: a lot of vegan places show some weakness when it comes to dessert... Veggie Galaxy is not one of them. They proved with their Oreo Cheesecake that you don't need actual milk or animal fat to deliver wonderful flavors. I would actually say that the cheesecake was more successful that most of the non-vegan cheesecakes I had in my life before switching my diet. \\n\\n.- Mile High Lemon Meringue: Another thing I thought I would never be able to enjoy anymore after switching my diet... And again, I was wrong. THANKS! Excellent soft meringue with flavorful lemon filling. The crust is also exceptional. You can try the three parts by themselves, (the meringue, the lemon filling and the crust, and you will think they are all good, but... get a bite with all three of them together and you will suddenly understand what perfection is when it comes to dessert...\\n\\nI think that at this point I don't have to say I will come back there soon (like very soon)."},{"name":"Pepe's Cantina","address":"120 W Church St","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"The best Mexican food in Orlando hands down!

She was super sweet and was always making sure we have what we needed. Our soups and salad was brought by Tony, super nice! Then finally our chef came to the table, Ken. He made the best fried rice! His food was full of flavors! Everything he cooked was perfect! My filet came out just as I ordered, medium rare. My lobster, shrimp and scallops was also cooked right! His show was great!

It's home to some high-end stores like J. Crew and Lululemon and is a clean area to be sure but don't let the clean attractions fool you.  You pay for parking and definitely need to take a second mortgage on your home just to stay and eat here.\\n\\nMake sure you also time your eating period as well because this place is definitely not for those with an OCD schedule.\\n\\nPancake Social recently opened up from what I gather and it seems to be a place of less than hyped up-ness according to the reviews.  It's a quaint little brunch spot located next to Mountain High Outfitters.  You can't miss the large banner-like signage.\\n\\nUpon arrival, you'll see a tiny patio outdoor area able to fit about 5 small families or so which is decent since Atlanta weather tends to be nice during the spring.  Summertime, pack some sunscreen and light clothing.\\n\\nUpon entry, you'll see paper menus to your left and the ordering counter in front of you.  The menu is basic breakfast/brunch items of soft boiled eggs, smoothies, and a plethora of pancake type items available.  They also have sandwiches.  Now you might think it's breakfast items so that must mean they are inexpensive.\\n\\nThis is where you are wrong.  Three strips of bacon cost you $6, a single pancake is $4, and a decent sandwich is $10.  Yes, that is what I bought and with tax, that's a $21 brunch.  Smoothies are $8!  See how you need to take out a second mortgage on your home?  \\n\\nDon't get me wrong!  Everything was tasty!  And filling!  The chicken sandwich was flavorful.  But for $10, it was basically a bougie Chick-Fil-A chicken sandwich with a biscuit bun and some syrup they called \\"hot syrup\\" but I don't know what defined it as \\"hot\\".  Temperature maybe?  Because it wasn't spicy.  The pancake was fluffy and sweet.  The bacon definitely had a decent quality to it.  But the price point for these items is just not worth the drive to PCM if you live outside of Midtown.  And then paying for parking simply adds to the financial hassle.  Obviously, you need to price these items that high to cover the exorbitant rental cost of being at Ponce City Market so, go figure right?\\n\\nAll in all, this is a one time deal for me.

(We should note the restaurant was not overly crowded, so timing issues did not seem to be due to their being slammed or any such.) Water refills were a bit too long in coming too. Terrific food but a bit pricey, esp if you consider we were running dry. We skipped after-dinner drinks or dessert, opting for a faster take on those at home. A final \\"nit\\": Don't take a diner's plate while others are still eating. We'll give it another try, a bit reticently, but it's going to have to get back to its old standards.

They have bottomless salad and soup, I'd consider getting that next time.\\n\\nThen, the chicken came.  The mashed potatoes and broccoli were decent, but this poor piece of chicken had the texture and color of meat from a can.  The cheese, bacon, tomatoes, and bbq sauce couldn't hide it.  I had ordered too much food anyway, so I boxed it up and ate it later after cooking it in a pan, and the made the texture a *little* better, but it was still pretty nasty, and definitely low quality meat.\\n\\nI mean, it's chilis.

They have a few different seating areas as well as a larger space in the back, so this would be a great place for a special event or party. Secondly, they have a pretty solid food menu ranging from small bites/tapas all the way up to full size entrees, but not so many items that it's overwhelming. You can build your own cheese/meat platter, which has a good variety of tasty cheeses to pick from. \\n\\nFinally, THEIR HAPPY HOUR IS AMAZING. From 4-6 PM you can get a glass of their featured red or white for $5, and ALL food is half off. Yes, ALL food.

I was very glad this question was asked, since I had different plans and would have made a couple more stops before heading home had the medication not been temperature sensitive.\\n\\nI was asked if I needed to speak to the pharmacist since this was the first time I had taken this medication.  Steve D. gave succinct, friendly, and proper advice, answering questions that were within his purview and referring me to my prescribing physician on those issues that were beyond his realm.\\n\\nAlong the way, I learned that compounded medications are treated differently than patent medicines from an insurance perspective (meaning co-pays did not apply), so People's gave me a detailed receipt that I could file a claim with my insurance company.  Steve ensured that the NDC numbers and exact quantities of each medication present in the compound were listed on the form, and even went out of his way to complete a few fill-in-the blanks that had obvious answers as a courtesy to me.  The cost of the medication was very reasonable considering the extra service required to dispense, just a few dollars more than my non-preferred prescription co-pay\\n\\nAfter dropping off the prescription at home, I suddenly realized I had another question.  There were antibiotics included in the compound, and it dawned on me that my medication allergies weren't listed with People's Pharmacy (although they were on file with my new doctor).  A quick call back to Steve met with the same wonderful courtesy and reassurance that none of the medications in the compound were in my known allergy list.  He also took the time to add my known allergies to my patient profile at People's for future reference.\\n\\nI am very pleased with my experience with People's Pharmacy in this, a very different role than I have experienced with them previously.

My friend didn't even realize it was gluten free at the festival when she took a bite.\\n\\nWhen I remember my pizza experience with my out of town friend at Southside, I have images of juicy big fresh mushrooms on my pizza.  I have never seen the like of them before, or ever since.  My friend is a meat lover, and when he tasted my veggie delicious gluten free creation.  His eyes went big, and said he didn't even miss the meat, that is a lot coming from him.  Because of the heaped fresh juicy toppings, if you don't eat the pizza fast, the crust does get a bit soggy.  Its holding up so much lusciousness it can't keep up.  The crust itself also holds its own.  It actually has some flavor, not just tasteless cardboard. In summary, for all these reasons I would never want to deliver or order the pizza to go as it would negatively effect the quality. This was pizza meant to eat hot out of the oven.  \\n\\nThe place has a small outdoor seating section, and is nothing fancy on the inside. But definitely clean.  Those table staff are so quick to clean tables, that I had just gotten up to order and left my purse on the chair that I had a brief heart attack when I turned around and noticed my purse was gone.  I went back to the staff, and like magic my purse was behind the counter.  Be sure to not miss the show in watching your pizza crust getting tossed into the air and thrown around and popped into the wood fire stove.  Brings back my Milan nights.\\n\\nThe menu is very customizable and they even let me order 1/2 one kind, and the other 1/2 a something else on their gluten free crust (which they make by hand in house).  I tried the Zygmont and the Sun Dried Tomato Pesto.  The Zygmont was my favorite of the two.  \\n\\nThe staff were friendly and the prices affordable.  I will definitely be back.

It is, for the majority, not a bubble tea shop. I will write primarily about the bubble tea but will adjust my final rating accordingly. Today I deviated from my usual order and got a jasmine milk tea with regular boba. \\n\\nAuthentic flavor - 5/5 stars\\n\\nThis is as authentic as it gets (the window says the teas are 100% organic). This is literally loose leaf tea steeped over hot water, blended with milk and ice on top. It is nowhere close to artificially sweet. This is genuine, pure, high quality tea. This is also the first place I've tried where the milk does NOT overpower the tea! So many bubble tea shops try to overcompensate for the slightly natural bitter taste of tea by putting way too much milk in their teas. Not Tea Haus, though; the natural flavour of the tea is allowed to shine. In fact, I would argue I tasted much more of the tea than the milk. In short, it was perfect. \\n\\nBoba taste and consistency - 4/5 stars\\n\\nPleasantly surprised. They use a natural sweetener (I'm guessing honey?) so you won't taste the sickeningly sweet and sticky goodness of sugar coated boba, but for a store that prides itself on freshness, that makes sense. Consistency is nice, a little chewier than I like but not too tough. I do wish they had given me more, though. There was barely a layer at the bottom of the cup, but I did also order a small, so.....\\n\\nMenu offerings - 3/5 stars\\n\\nA little bit of everything, but not enough of any one thing. This can either be taken as a plus or a minus. They have a good selection of loose leaf teas and coffee (their main menu item), but the food, fresh juices, lemonades, and bubble tea are almost an afterthought. I would be interested in trying out the loose leaf teas in combination with some milk/boba, but in terms of bubble tea you're fairly limited; the  grapefruit honey green tea is their only fruit optio. This means, sadly, I probably won't return because I don't really like milk teas (I'm more of a fruit tea person), but what I did drink today was delicious enough that I would recommend you try them out if you enjoy milk teas. Other things to note: get their basil chicken, it's delicious. \\n\\nCafe decor and ambiance - 5/5 stars\\n\\nI am such a sucker for quaint looking cafes. This is what Starbucks would look like if it fused with one of those warehouse coworking spaces that startups like to rent. It's a little unfinished, but that's part of the ambiance. Lots of individuals were sitting around at 5pm on a Monday, tapping away on their computer trying to get work done. Jazzy music plays in the background. It's generally quiet, a space to relax or focus instead of a place to bring a huge group. Even the tables, which can seat six, are taken up by individuals working alone. There are ample outlets (thank god) and speedy wifi. \\n\\nFinal rating - 4/5 stars"},{"name":"HunnyMilk","address":"40 NE 28th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"This is one of the coolest places I have ever been to.

Now I understand that this is Boulder, and it was around election time, but whether or not I happen to agree, this is not what I darkened thier doors to get. \\n\\nThey are twice as good as any restaraunt in Boulder for half the money.

I try to go there as much as I can, when I can. Usually when I go, I have a nice time. I've never have such an unpleasant experience like the one I did. I went with a few of my friends, and we're teenagers. From the start of our experience, we felt discriminated because of our age. We waited the long 45+ minute line to get a table, just to be treated improperly. The waiter (I don't recall her name) was a heavier older woman, caucasian, with brown hair. She gave us the menus immediately after seating us and then gave us a little over 3 minutes to discuss our options. She did NOT do this to any of the other tables who were older than us. Then, she told us that we had to order an appetizer because there was a certain amount of people in our party. Please keep in mind we ordered our drinks before we ordered our food. I have been to La Famiglia with the same amount of people and that hadn't happened to me before. We all found this unusual, but we went along with it because we didn't want to cause a scene. Then, our appetizer was brought out very quickly- as if it was pre-made! Our drinks hadn't been brought out at this point. Then, our food came out about 15 minutes later. She tossed our food onto the table as if we weren't paying customers! We noticed that she was friendly with the other tables near us and put their food on their table gently. By this point, our drink still hadn't been brought out, so I asked another waiter if they were being brought out. By the time our drinks came, we were done with one of our dishes already. As if this weren't bad enough, our waitress was extremely rude and unpleasant. She not once checked on us, but we noticed that she was checking in with other tables. When we were in the middle of a conversation, she interrupted us and asked us if we were ready to wrap up our foods. Not only is this rude, but it felt almost discriminatory. She had not once done any of the things she did to us to any of the other tables that were older than us. It was just plain wrong. When the time came to pay, she complained about her too tip being too little, as if she deserved a dollar more! That being said, I will no longer be visiting this restaurant.

My mom had no where to put her walker due to the confined space and so we put it between the 2 of us to help keep it out of the way. \\n\\nWhen our server came over he seemed to be in a rush and kicked the walker.

When he brought everything out we dug in. As my mom was eating she noticed the bread that was supposed to come with her meal was missing. She managed to flag down our server to let him know.  He said, \\"Yes it does come with a slice of Texas Toast. Did you look under your Chicken Fried Steak?\\" Excuse me What? It was not under the steak. He said he would be back with it in a moment. It was about 5 moments before she received her toast. \\n\\nWhen we finished eating our server was no where to be found. Finally he walked over and we requested our checks. No offer of dessert or refills at all. He said he would right back. Two of us stayed to wait for the checks while the other 2 in our parry headed out to the car.

This is a great place to hang out and study! The store is nicely decorated, the tables are spread apart, ample light flows through, and there's free wifi. It does appear to have a identity crisis though since it serves pressed juice, boba (only Jasmine Milk tea and Milk tea), and coffee... They also serve two food items: brick toast and basil fried chicken. \\n\\nI've tried their Boba Milk Tea, Jasmine Milk Tea, Mint Mojito Ice Coffee, and Basil Fried Chicken (over multiple trips!). \\nMy favorite items are their Boba Milk Tea and Basil Fried Chicken. \\n1) You could actually taste the tea in their milk tea! It was definitely not made from powder. Since Coco's and Tea Haus are about the same distance from me, I come to Tea Haus when I'm craving just a milk tea as it's $1 cheaper and of higher quality. Their boba do sometimes have off days when it's harder than I would like, but it's usually perfect 90% of the time. I also love that they don't give you a cup with half ice and half drink. It's usually 80% milk tea and 20% ice :) \\n\\n2)Their Basil Fried Chicken was one of the best popcorn chicken I've ever tasted! The chicken was moist inside and flavorful outside. Every piece was high quality. No tough, small pieces of random chicken part here.  \\n\\n3)The Jasmine Milk tea tasted very weak; I could barely taste the tea. Maybe it was an off batch of brew, but since their regular milk tea is so yummy I'll just stick to that. \\n\\n4) The Mint Mojito Ice Coffee was good, but not the best I've had. I wish it was creamier and had a heavier mint taste like Philz back in SF. I'll probably get it again if I'm craving that particular flavor seeing as SF is way too far. \\n\\nThe people that work here are super friendly!

The ambiance of the place makes it a popular place to study or hang out with friends. However, I feel as if the boba milk tea here isn't as tasty as other locations. The milk tea tasted a bit watered down and didn't have as much flavor as a place like Kung Fu Tea. The boba itself was sweet and chewy, but I didn't receive that much in my cup. Thankfully, boba is already included in the price so you don't have to pay extra. \\n\\nI've heard good things about the strawberry brick toast, but I found it underwhelming. For $5.95, you get a huge slab of freshly baked bread (imagine 2 Texas Toasts on top of each other) covered with a few strawberries and slathered in condensed milk and sugar. It wasn't overwhelmingly sweet, but you're paying a lot for bread and strawberries. \\n\\nTea Haus' saving grace is its basil fried chicken. They fry up half a pound of large chicken thigh chunks to a perfect crispiness and juiciness. The chicken is also seasoned amazingly and reminded me of chicken I would get in Taiwan. I'd come back for this dish alone! I don't think I would ever come here to study because it can get crowded and it's far from campus, but if that's your cup of tea, then come and get a basil fried chicken while you study.

I feel it's a key point to mention I have been to Hy's in Waikiki and feel it was one of the best restaurants I've ever been to. Hy's should take their name away from this Vancouver location as absolutely nothing about this restaurant embodies the Hy's experience whatsoever. \\n\\nFirst let's talk about the decor. The decor was like someone's idea of decorating a basement like a \\"haunted mansion\\" for a joke. Horrible black panelled walls, gold framed portraits hung on the wall side by side with about 1 inch of space between, various sizes, cheap looking and all askew. Wall sconces made to look like lanterns that were honestly hilarious. To make matters worse they hung tacky red/orange tinsel Christmas decorations which were truly heinous. The person who was responsible for the interior design of this restaurant should be laughed out of the industry. \\n\\nTable positions were really odd. They sat the 2 of us at a round table for 3. Directly and awkwardly beside a square table for 6. The whole time my chair was bumped from the back by servers or the people sitting there because there wasn't enough room. \\n\\nDress code... what dress code? There were people in cotton polo shirts, jeans and even a person in a hoodie!  Dress code should be mandatory and enforced. \\n\\nBabies - why on earth would you EVER bring a baby to an upscale steakhouse? And why on earth would a restaurant allow this in the first place? Parents - leave your babies at home or bring them to White Spot. Give us a break. Give yourselves a break! And Hy's - enforce adults only, or at least no children under 5. Seriously, take a stand. \\n\\nNext let's talk about the food.  We were offered their \\"signature\\" cheese bread. Which was great. But then charged $10 for it at the end. Hy's in Waikiki gives it complimentary. Why is an \\"upscale\\" steakhouse charging me $10 for a piece of bread with cheese melted on it?\\n\\nProsecco - flat and sweet, i.e., nothing that I was looking for. A terrible recommendation by our server. I'm guessing he has never actually tried it himself. \\nCalamari appetizer - bland. Waste of money. \\n8oz Filet mignon - just ok, nothing special. Again, very bland. \\nMashed potatoes - very plain, no garlic, had an odd taste. \\nAsparagus - a side dish you had to order separately because of course the steak dinner you are paying $52 for couldn't possibly come with a few measly vegetables. \\nPistachio creme br√ªl√©e - I will admit this was really good. \\n\\nAlso, it was my husband's birthday and I noted this on my reservation. They did not offer any complimentary cake, which they did in Waikiki, and I saw them bring a similar cake with a candle to another couple in the restaurant.  \\n\\nAll in all I would NEVER go back and waste $300 at Hy's Vancouver. I would NEVER recommend the restaurant to anyone. In fact, I would tell them to go to The Keg for half the price and way better food and ambiance."},{"name":"Tastings - A Wine Experience","address":"958 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"This location is a unique wine tasting facility.

I would have much preferred, and thought it more appropriate, if they removed the roll we waited an hour for. Comping an item that was $3.90 seemed a little insulting and cheap on their end.\\n\\nThe waitress had also expressed that the wait took so long because they have a new sushi chef. Way to throw your coworkers under the bus.

Pretty good, but not my favorite thing, probably because all the other dishes had such strong flavors.\\n* Chicken with Hot Chili Sauce - A good chicken dish but nothing special. Was good with the fried rice (which was on the blander side).\\n* Yang Zhou Fried Rice - We got to order this dish for $4.99 off a special menu because we hit the $40 order cap.

We were a party of 6 (for lunch, mind you) and after being asked if we had a reservation (only 4 tables were occupied) we were seated in a very cramped table in the front.  I told the hostess that we were celebrating my 89 year old father's birthday and had a small cake with us, could they accommodate us after our meal.  She said no but she would check with the manager.  After waiting another 10 minutes another woman came over and said we could not have our cake. She stated that they don't serve dessert or coffee at the restaurant so we couldn't eat our cake.  How would it harm them to be kind, even if we had to pay a plating fee, especially since we weren't taking away from our bill by not ordering their dessert?  We're talking about some plates and forks, that's all.  Remember, we had an 89 year with us and my 85 year old mother!  How mean spirited and short sighted! Just read the list of \\"rules\\" on the right side of the menu to know what kind of people run this establishment: \\"don't ask us to add or remove ingredients from our dishes,\\" some mention of children being controlled by their parents, etc. We took our business down the street to another (of the hundreds)  Italian restaurant where it was delightful and they were happy to serve our cake."},{"name":"Ovation Coffee & Tea","address":"941 NW Overton St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"WOWOWOW.

Their appearance as well as taste remind me of the frozen shrimps from winco. They went cheap with their ingredients, using the same prawns and cheap mushrooms in every dish. All dishes that we ordered lacked flavor, were extremely bland, and lacked the overall Chinese cooking style to make for a worthy Chinese dish. Being Chinese, I grew up eating authentic Chinese, providing me with the experience to confidently say that think they do not use traditional ingredients and seasonings. \\n\\nThe general t'so chicken: 2/5. This could've easily been mistaken for orange chicken. It was overly sweet. However, it was in fact cooked to perfection, and its consistency was nice and crispy. \\n\\nShrimp fried rice: 2/5. Cheap shrimp and lacked flavor. Rice was moist and cooked to perfection.\\n\\nTofu fried pot: 1/5. Uses cheap vegetables that taste like they came from frozen. Tofu seasoned American style-red pepper flakes and something else that's non traditional...paprika?

My girlfriend played it safe and went with a BLT.\\n\\nThe food did not take long to come out at all, and we chowed down on the wings first. They're smoked and grilled, which has become my new favorite thing, and we had them with the Hot BBQ.

El Naranjo was disappointing in each of these areas, and sadly a waste of money and our date night.\\n\\nService was quite poor, starting from the minute we walked in the restaurant.\\nWhen looking for our reservation, the host said \\"There's no (lastname) reservation here\\". That's because they put the reservation under our first name. In other words, the server made us think he couldn't find the reservation before he had thoroughly searched for it.\\n\\nSecondly, my wife had specifically asked for an indoor reservation, which she was promised. In fact, due to a large party dining that evening, my wife specifically took a less desirable later time to ensure we could sit inside. Then, we were told they couldn't seat us inside, only on the patio. What the heck?\\n\\nThe server, a thin white woman, was generally absent from our table. You know those restaurants where you just wait and wait and wait for any kind of service: order, water refill, bill? El Naranjo. I think the server extended our dinner by 45 minutes because of how slow she was.\\n\\nThe door from patio into the building kept locking itself so that no one, not servers nor customers, would be able to leave the patio. Twice I witnessed a server get locked out on the patio. The second time it happened, believe it or not, he freaked out and started knocking/banging really hard on the door... The patio became quiet as all the customers stopped to wonder what was going on, and the server continued banging on the door until someone finally opened it...\\n\\nTo top off all this shockingly lackluster service, El Naranjo added a 20%, yes, 20% included tip to our bill (party of two). The menu makes NO mention of this and says only that 18% tip will be added for parties of six or more. Again, what the heck? Clearly, they lie.\\n\\nThe only thing that seemed to fit the pricey, hip restaurant niche was the building itself. The exterior is inviting, and the inside had a chic modern design. The patio was pleasant and clean with a large tree overhanging it and scattered twinkle lights, but patio chairs were rather uncomfortable. Little things were off. The wall mounted fan that was supposed to be pointing at our patio table was instead reversed to blow over the fence, cooling no one. No one noticed or cared to redirect it, I suppose.\\n \\nThe food was not impressive, and vegetarian options are poor. When asked about vegetarian options, the server recommended two dishes which were comprised of vegetables with sauce. I don't know about you, but I like more than vegetables for dinner. I had one of the dishes the server recommended, the Chile Poblano Relleno de Picadillo de Verduras, Chile relleno stuffed with vegetables in a thin tomato sauce with rice. It was delivered lukewarm, and wasn't flavorful or substantial. The salsas and orange butter were honestly my favorite part of the meal. \\n\\nWe had Tres Leches cake for dessert but it was dense and dry.

When I was not having any caffeine they have organic honey milk and boba which has no tea in it, it has a really nice honey milk flavor. I just tried the basil friend chicken today and it's so so so good. I feel like I'm back in a cafe in Seoul or Taipei. Even the decor reminds me of Asia. The coffee is also solid. They use summer moon beans and they have a delicious sea salt creme coffee which I saw in Taipei but didn't try until here. It's not really salty more like a very rich sweet latte.

However, on my birthday, I'm somebody, at least in my own mind.  Or maybe I just want to be treated as such, especially when I get a small group of friends together for a celebration.  Or perhaps I want to have dinner at a place that doesn't treat me like a nobody.\\n\\nBut that's precisely what happened to me on February 2nd, 2013 at Salty Sow.  I had been planning my event since New Year's.  OK, so maybe I could have called more than a day-and-a-half in advance for a reservation.  However, calling a week ahead often leads to lost reservations in Austin, as happened to one of my friends at Paggi House.  Sorry, I just didn't think it would be a big deal to get a table for eight for 4:30 PM on a Saturday.\\n\\nSalty Sow's website indicated that parties of seven or more were to call for reservations rather than making them through OpenTable (this has since changed).  I called and left a message at 12:29 PM on Friday.  Tamra, the manager, got back to me at 2:39 PM.  Her call caught me indisposed, so I had to make a hasty apology while I retreated from \\"the meeting room\\".\\n\\nMy party had been a bit iffy on final count and arrival times, but six expected to be there within about 30 minutes of opening, with the balance to arrive within an hour.  I honestly explained to Tamra that the party could vary from six to eight during the course of the evening.  She said that she only had one large table, and that table MUST be cleared by 6:15 for another reservation at 6:30.  Intended or not, the message received was \\"Take it or leave it.\\"\\n\\nThe conversation that ensued was more than a bit bizarre.  At one point, Tamra chose to interpret my hesitation as intentional deception, when, in reality, I was mulling over taking my business elsewhere.  She then proceeded to impress me with how \\"her 15 years of restaurant management experience\\" entitled her to call customers liars.  Had it not been that one friend had expressed a fervent desire to try Salty Sow, I would have moved the party to the more familiar Eleven Plates in a heartbeat, where I knew I'd be treated well.  In the end, Tamra offered to seat us on their patio where she had more flexibility, and I reluctantly accepted.\\n\\n[After making the reservation, later that evening my friends re-centered their arrival times to 5 PM.  I dutifully called Salty Sow at 8:47 PM to let them know, and had a polar opposite experience speaking to a gentleman who could barely hear me over the din in the restaurant, but couldn't thank me enough for calling and insisted the slight change would be no problem to accommodate. Wow, what a difference--genuine appreciation and real customer service!]\\n\\nIn the end, the evening went amazingly well.  Salty Sow's \\"patio seating\\" left a bit to be desired, since it turned out to be a series of six-top picnic tables with high, leg-dangling bench seats on blacktop next to the sidewalk along Poquito Street.  A couple of friends unexpectedly cancelled at the last minute due to illness and contingencies, so the party truly averaged four over the course of the evening, although it peaked at six.  Thankfully, we were served by an over-the-top totally amazing waitress (perhaps her name was \\"Amanda\\", but I can't truly recall).  Everyone on the staff that night treated us incredibly well.  We even got a chance to meet a gentleman who introduced himself to us as a part of the new Salty Sow venture in Phoenix.\\n\\nI managed to enjoy a couple of Curly Tails which were very tasty, if a bit overpriced, along with the Slow-Cooked Beef Shoulder, which I found to be diminutive in portion size for the price, a bit fatty, and not particularly impressive.  I was a bit distressed that Salty Sow was only able to accommodate one friend's medically-founded dietary issues with an order of toast (her suggestion when all else failed).  Thanks to our waitress, we each received a complimentary glass of bubbly to celebrate at the end of the evening, which was completely unexpected.  What really saved the day were my friends and their eternally scintillating conversation, and that our loving waitress let us keep the full table to ourselves for over two hours without table-sharing (as had occurred to most patio tables by that hour due to patron demand).\\n\\nI personally won't set foot in Salty Sow again, thanks to the reservation drama, but my friends continue to visit and enjoy--and I'm happy for them.  I'm sure they could tell something about me was off that evening, but they never knew what was up; that is, until now.\\n\\nSo, my shot across the Sow is, when a first-time customer entrusts their special occasion to your establishment, don't lead with your chin and behave like an ungrateful pig.  Cheesy though it may sound, I'm reminded of the old American Airlines slogan, \\"We know you have a choice when flying, thank you for flying American\\".  It might be a lesson you should learn gracefully before your customers help you learn it the hard way.

Kudos to the owners and designers of the 110 Grill as they have harnessed the power of the cosmos and physics which I didn't expect from a restaurant group, but they did it. As you walk through the front door of this \\"brand new\\" restaurant, you are magically teleported back to 1986. It's amazing, but they figured out time travel and built it into a restaurant. Formica bar top, rugs in the dining room, dated entree choices and no effort given to food prep. I think to complete the look of 1986, they are installing a tube tv in the bar next week.\\n\\nSince it's new and they have 1600 locations, we thought we would try it to see if it was decent. Good crowd for a Friday but guessing this is because it just opened. Sat down at the bar and ordered a couple drinks. Vodka soda was good, but if you mess that up you should never handle a bottle again. Old fashioned was not good. Sweet and just off. So they are batting .500 at this point.\\n\\nThe the strike outs begin. Like Pedro in his prime. Dropping curve balls on the corner of the plate. Take a look at the menu...totally underwhelming. $26 for steak tips? Come on. If you are charging close to $30 for steak tips, at least give me a granite bar to put my plate on. \\"Here sir...enjoy\\nyour overpriced beef on our plastic bar.\\" No thanks. Or how about the short rib flatbread? Sounds decent until you read it's covered in truffle oil. Can we all agree that truffle oil is just awful and overused at this point? There are no truffles, just crappy flavored oil. No thank you again...next.\\n\\nWe decide we should at least try something, so the app that might be intriguing was the crab rangoon dip. Cheese, crab and cream. How bad could it be? Well it wasn't great, but it wasn't horrible either. Solid 2 stars. It would have been far better if the kitchen staff took the time to put the bread over a warm flame and toast it a little as opposed to opening the package and slapping it on the plate. A little effort goes a long way and they didn't try at all.\\n\\n$35 for a cheese dip ($14) with room temperature bread and cold potato chips, and 2 drinks.

In the past it had been $26 for all you can eat crab legs. My friends and I used to go daily. We even called last night to make sure the deal was still going on and whoever was at concierge assured us that all you can eat crab legs was still a-go. When we arrived there tonight, we were told that was not the case and that we had to buy a limited number of crab legs separately. My friends and I each added two \\"clusters\\" that were absolutely horrible. The legs were over cooked and probably reheated in boiled water again when they were ready to be served. The meat was discolored, and shriveled up to nothing inside the crab legs. The crab legs were impossible to crack open because they just... bent. They were soft and over cooked. In addition, the buffet price increased from $26 to $30 + the clusters (additional $12 for 2). Ended up being $50 a person. Not worth it. I've been to Jack Casino in Cincinnati, and the crab leg buffet there is much better--and endless. So I know it IS possible to get good, unlimited crab, in Ohio, but not at Hollywood Casino. Disappointing that we called to specifically avoid this situation but were still told misinformation."},{"name":"Yebo","address":"3500 Peachtree Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"This may now be my top ranked spot in the ATL!  Yay Yebo!\\n\\nIts been a minute since I was here for the grand opening last September, and honestly, I'm not sure why its taken me so long to get back.  Its super easy to find parking (without the $10 valet) and honestly, I love walking through the mall to get to Yebo (even though you totally don't have to).  Yebo + Phipps movie = best ATL date night?\\n\\nWe came for hubby's birthday.  We lived in South Africa for over 2 years and are huge fans of 10 Degrees South - Justin Anthony is just brilliant!  Anyway, we loved the opening at Yebo and decided to hit it up for a birthday dinner.  Reservations were easily made via OpenTable and when we got there, we were promptly seated at a lovely outdoor table that actually made us feel like we were back in Joburg.\\n\\nTo our delight, the menu features \\"beef jerky,\\" which is actually a very common SA delight called biltong.  We ordered it and were pleased as could be that this tasted just like what we remembered (and ate all the time!) back in SA.  We were also pleased at the wine list, which contains several of our favorite wines.  If you've never had chenin blanc, this is another fantastic South African varietal that is just as much worth trying as the pinotage.  YUM.\\n\\nWe pretty much ordered the entire menu and were pleased as could be with every bite.  The ostrich sliders were HEAVENLY and again, reminded us of SA, as we only used ground ostrich for our burgers instead of beef when we lived there.  These were spot-on amazing.  The lamb sliders were equally as good and the tzatziki really balanced out the flavors in the lamb.  Both sliders had terrific bread, which was soft and in the perfect bun-to-meat ratio, which can often be ruined with sliders.  The chicken curry bunny chow tasted just like what you would get in South Africa in Durban, where the dish reigns supreme.  This version is served in a ciabatta, which isn't traditional (in SA, its just a big loaf of white bread), but I actually enjoyed the ciabatta very much.  The fried chicken was stellar, and I gotta say - those grits were to die for.  This was the best South Africa/Southern fusion on the menu, so if that's what you're going for, order this.  I also really enjoyed the mac & cheese, which went super well with the chicken.\\n\\nThe piece de resistance was the foie gras pancakes.  Having just had the foie gras french toast at Iberian Pig (HEAVENLY), I had to order up Yebo's pancakes to try.  Yup, heavenly.  This dish made more sense to me at Yebo than it did at Iberian Pig, as foie gras is a menu staple in Cape Town at the upscale restaurants (at one place, I had a foie gras soup followed by springbok loin with foie gras - crazy!).  I thought the blueberry cream balanced delightfully against the pancakes and foie gras, and oh man, the bacon crumbles.  Yesssssssssssssssssssssssss.\\n\\nThis was truly a perfect dinner out:  great service, perfect wine, perfect al fresco dining weather, perfect food.  I will definitely be back and will drag anyone and everyone to just get a fabulous glass of wine and biltong pre-movie, or a full meal, start to finish.

Fries are amazing! Burger had the regular toppings of onion, tomato, and lettuce.  The cheese was nicely melted on the burger and bacon cooked to perfection. The burger was accurately cook to a perfect medium, it's a good looking burger. Unfortunately it lacks in taste and is quite greasy which is easily noticed by the sopping wet bun. The BBQ appeared to be missing from the BBQ either because none was added or it was taken over by the grease of the burger.

The food & service make this more than a meal...it's an experience. Every bite is lovingly & thoughtfully prepared, & I love that they make an effort to source local & organic foods. \\n\\nThose who complain about the smaller portions & slightly more expensive price need to keep in mind that you're paying for high-quality ingredients. This is not Panda Express. And, besides, it's obvious that they're not trying to get rich off of you since the owners are a husband & wife who work as server/host & cook. They're always so friendly & hospitable & are so gracious whenever you compliment anything. I would probably still go there for those reasons alone even if the food wasn't that great. \\n\\nBut the food is that great. It's always fresh & perfectly prepared every time. Each ingredient is thoughtfully included & the nuances of each bite definitely evoke yummy noises. We usually get the same thing...tom kha gai to start (too hot outside for that tonight though), crispy duck for the hubby & pad kee mao spicy for me. The soup is the best I've ever had. It hits every note & is perfect in every way. The crispy duck is an orgasmic experience for my husband. He absolutely loves it & I think it would probably be a contender for his final death row meal. It's perfectly pan-fried super crispy duck with saut√©ed vegetables that are never soggy with a slightly sweet tamarind sauce. The pad kee mao is chock full of chicken & lots of fresh vegetables which may not be authentic but it definitely elevates the dish to the next level.  In fact, I always miss the extra veggies when I get this dish someplace else. It's always perfectly spicy for me too. Almost on the verge of being too spicy but perfect with a creamy & refreshing Thai iced tea. Today we also tried the Thai fried rice for the first time because we were extra hungry &, let me tell you, it was better than any other fried rice I've ever had. And I'm Asian so I've eaten a lot of fried rice in my day. There were tons of veggies, chicken, & shrimp & we both adored the inclusion of the cashews & pineapple. Every bite was a flavor & texture explosion! This is not just fried rice put on the menu for the sake of having fried rice on the menu, as Rich revealed to us. It is entree-worthy for those of you who aren't piggies like us. We also tried the sticky rice & mango dessert with the tapioca sauce. Very mildly sweet but very yummy. It was the perfect palate-cleansing ending to a meal of robust flavors. My only critique would be that I wish the mangoes were cut slightly thicker. I can't wait to try the other banana dessert next time!\\n\\nAs much as we love our regular entrees, we both vow to try something different next time due to reading the other yelp reviews & expect that it will be just as delicious as everything else!

We spent a lot of money for the dinner, and want to have a great night and memorable experience for celebrating the birthday. \\nManagement need to look at this ! !

It is important to manage time and make sure guests are satisfied and enjoy their special dining experience for any occasion!!"},{"name":"Hanabi","address":"2525 W Anderson Ln, Ste 120","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Wow was this place great.

Additionally, I can't recommend their bento boxes enough! You get 2 Gyoza, salad, an entree, rice, and a side dish of your choice (I usually go for California rolls or assorted tempura) for about $10 and the portions are perfect. I've also had their Sushi platters as well as their specialty rolls. Can't find a single bum dish in the house. Literally everything that I've had so far has been great. My personal favorite special roll is the PDX Roll. They're also on Eat24, so if you're in a hurry, you can put in your order early and they'll have it ready for you.\\n\\nTheir staff is superb. The moment you walk in, several member of the staff greet you and you're seated in no time. They are attentive but not hovering and they're always there to address anything that you need. They're also well versed in their menu and can always answer questions that you may have. Service is fast and well timed. When you finish up your Miso Soup, your main dish is brought to you within a few minutes. I've never found myself idly waiting for very long.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is good. There are basically 3 sections, one with couches on the wall, the sushi bar, and the other with tables. The servers can push the tables together on the couch section to make a big table, which is great for groups.

I stood at the bar for over 10 minutes, 3 out of the 5 bartenders walked past me without acknowledgement. It was IMPOSSIBLE to get their attention, extremely frustrating. No one would even look up. I was seriously about to leave. Another bartender (Raven) saw me waving from the opposite end of the bar, came down and said I'll be right over. How is it that one bartender can acknowledge the entire bar, but three can't even look at half of it? Even if you can't help someone right away, at least look up and acknowledge my presence.

I can't believe bacchanalia is associated with this restaurant. \\n\\nThis was my second time dining here, and after the first time I thought this would be the right place for the right occasion. Boy, was I completely wrong. \\n\\nWe were celebrating our one year anniversary. Although our comfy and secluded seating area helped the intimacy of a special night, the food was a major let down and the service was a train wreck. \\n\\nThe minute we sat down, we were greeted by our waiter who informed us he actually wasn't our waiter but would start us off with our drinks. The night called for celebration, so we ordered 2 glasses of prosecco. After 15 minutes, the same gentleman came by and was shocked we didn't have our prosecco yet. Since we had waited so long, we ordered our appetizers with him. Another 10 minutes pass, and finally our prosecco shows up. (25 minutes in). Appetizers (Tuna tartare and burrata cheese) were somewhat prompt. The burrata was delicious. Tuna was bland. \\n\\nNo fault to them, just my own disappointment was that the lamb shank was no longer on the menu, although their website says it's on the menu. Halfway through our apps, another waitress comes into the fold, introduces herself and takes our dinner order. We ordered hanger steak and risotto which took about 40-45 minutes. The service staff came by once between dinner order placed and dinner order served to clear our apps, plates and replenish silverware (20 minutes before the food came).  Dinner was alright, steak was cooked as requested (medium), pomme frites took a salt bath, risotto very very (very) bland. \\n\\nThe grand finale, after little to no service, the best gesture (and tip saver) was a dry cupcake for our anniversary. The idea was there, very thoughtful but I wouldn't go back after being unimpressed by the food and feeling lost with little to no service."},{"name":"la Barbecue","address":"2027 E Cesar Chavez St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"So good!

Okay, so the brisket here is prettty darn close to Franklin's.  The brisket here is equally tender, moist and flavorful as Franklin's and if you were to do a blind taste test of the two, it would be hard to differentiate between the two.  If I had to be snobby and really pick at what the difference was, I would say that la Barbecue's brisket is slightly fattier and also saltier but both briskets are perfection.  Really can't go wrong with either one.  The ribs at la barbecue are definitely different.  Delicious, fall of the bone tender, but not as fall of the bone tender as Franklin's.  Franklin's ribs were like, if you tried to pick it up, the meat would just fall off.. if that makes visual sense.  Franklin's ribs were quite peppery, and la barbecue's version was a little sweeter.  Also can't really go wrong with either one.. just different.  That all being said la Barbecue is a tough contender in the world of Austin barbecue and I would rank it at the top of the list.  Franklin's wins by an ever so slightly \\"pinky-up\\" margin in taste, but you can't beat the significantly shorter wait time.  I would say if you are really short on time and can't make it to Franklin's or can't do the wait, I promise you will not be disappointed with la Barbecue.

After 20 min, I walked up to the register to check on it, only to find that it had just come out. I didn't want to disrupt their service so I sat back down.

The sushi was okay, you couldn't even taste the \\"crunch\\" from the shrimp tempura & the rolls were pretty pricey for the size... \\n\\nMy fianc√© was super bummed because they were out of the Miso Butterfish (which he was looking forward to...), so he had to settle for the Saba.

The miso soup was pretty cold & had no taste what so ever (I'm a huge miso soup fan & cook it all the time at home), it just tasted like water with a hint of miso taste. Their dressing for their salad was meh, it was some type of ginger miso dressing. Although, their tonkatsu was cooked perfectly BUT their tonkatsu sauce sucked. I would've settled for shoyu & ketchup mixed together than what they served me. My fianc√© did enjoy his saba but they served it with sometime of salad concoction that served no purpose; they could've just plated it on a bed of cabbage on a smaller plate.\\n\\nI would go back & try their bento box or just a plate of different specialty rolls (hopefully they'll make the sushi a little bigger...).

So we came in for a date night last Saturday at 5 pm as a party of 2. We had reservation and got seated on the second floor. \\n\\nOur waiter suggested the infamous cheese bread so we ordered that as appetizer, tasted nice but not outstanding to my taste. Then we ordered a medium rib steak with baked potato and a med-well filet mignon with mashed potato and a glass of orange juice (yes we were kinda hungry). \\n\\nMy rib steak tasted nice and juicy, but the baked potato was mediocre. I was given some options to choose as the toppings on the potato, but the potato itself was still very bland on the inside. The potato flesh was hard to scrape off the skin and we weren't given a single spoon for our food, so I didn't bother to mix the toppings with the flesh. Overall, I would say my steak tasted better than Keg's but  it doesn't impress me too much.\\n\\nOn the other hand, my partner's med-well steak turned out to be cooked to pretty much well done as she cut through and ate a couple pieces. So we told our waiter about it and got a refire. The old one was very tough and the new one was ok according to her, but I didn't expect this mistake from the restaurant because the place was not very busy at the time. Her orange juice also just looked like a glass of regular store-bought juice and charged quite high as I remembered. \\n\\nThen there happens something I really don't understand. We were in the middle of eating steaks and suddenly a waiter came twice to ask us if we are finished and wanted the food packed. First of all we weren't even close to being done, and we didn't look full or anything. Secondly it's like they want to rush us out when we've only been in the restaurant for like 45 minutes. We found this very rude and unreasonable...\\n\\nWe spent about $190 at this place and got not-outstanding food and really weird services. I came with great expectations of this restaurant but left really disappointed, especially when I've got a much better experience in Gotham that actually kinda impressed me prior to this.

Ask for chili flakes in the olive oil for the extra boom. \\n\\n1. Baby Eggplant Appetizer (5/5) - I love eggplant and this was perfect.

Rich, cheesy, but great flavor and unique. My favorite. \\n4. Ahi Tuna Pasta - (4/5) Tuna on pasta is also a rare one to see, but the tuna was cooked perfectly and plentiful. The pasta underneath tasted great with a red sauce. \\n\\nI'm sure everything here is great, overall a wonderful experience. The main dishes are enough to split among even 3, as we had plenty of leftovers. I would probably order 1 app and 1 pasta for 2 people, maybe that would even be a lot.

So, basically, no sharing dishes at this establishment and if you dare, then no side dish refills for you!   Also additional rice is a hefty $2 and side dishes are $1.50.

I've been trying dishes from different cultures and expanding my palate. Recently a friend and I went to a restaurant in called Assaggio. Upon walking into the restaurant we were welcomed by a friendly face and the wonderful scent of Italian cuisine. Our waitress sat us at a table by the windows giving us a view of the wonderfully busy streets in the North End. While the inside of the restaurant was painted in a way that made it seem like they had built a little bit of Italy into it. There's a bar at the front of the restaurant allowing people to have drinks and enjoy their meal in a different way as well as a downstairs eating are that I have been told is very romantic. After looking over the menu we ordered the brushetta as an appetizer just 6.95 serving two. It was a combination of deliciously marinated tomatoes under a slice of mozzarella covered with some cilantro all on top of a nice crispy yet still soft piece of bread. My favorite part of the brushetta happened to be the tomatoes. Although the marinade came off extremely strong it may very well have been what brought them out the most. As we ate our brushetta my order of Spaghetti Carbonara came out just 13.95, and the aroma filled our table area. My mouth watered just at the site of it. Taking the first bite I knew I had made the right choice. The combination of saut√©ed onions, mushroom, and pancetta tossed into a bed of Alfredo sauce and spaghetti was just magical. It may very well be the best pasta I've ever tasted. Sadly all good things come to an end, my friend ordered the Chicken Broccoli Ziti at 14.95 and it wasn't very impressive. The chicken was bland and the sauce had no zing. Compared to my dish it was really a huge disappointment, but that's just my opinion. I would still recommend this restaurant to anyone that asked especially the Spaghetti Carbonara but not the other we don't want to disappoint others. Assaggio is a cute little place on Prince St., just off the corner from Mike's Pastries a sinfully delicious Italian bakery, but let's save that for another review."},{"name":"Salty Sow","address":"1917 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Great food, but cramped waiting space!

The most important reason was to see my long-time friends. However, a close second reason was to try some of the best BBQ in the nation. Initially, I had my heart set on Franklin's BBQ, but my husband was not about waiting in the 5 to 6 hour line. After quite a bit of research, we found that La Barbecue was a close competitor of Franklin's (and I think also a James Beard award winner??). \\n\\nNow don't get me wrong. There is also a line to wait in La Barbecue. However, the cool thing is that the line is not as long as Franklin's, and they serve FREE beer. We got there on the Sunday of July 4th weekend around 10 am. The line doesn't actually form until about 10:30 or so. Move fast because otherwise, you may end up in the back even if you were waiting at the benches for a while. The truck starts serving food around 11.\\n\\nSadly, despite getting there early and getting served around 12:15 pm, we missed the beef ribs. They looked pretty freakin' amazing so I am still a bit sad about that. I asked the guy that works there and he did say they run out of those typically within an hour. Plan accordingly!\\n\\nOn to the food. We ordered beef brisket and pork ribs. OMG delicious! The brisket was extremely tender and had a nice seasoning. I also loved the sauces that were on the table to accompany our food. The pork ribs fell of the bone and melted in my mouth. If it wasn't for the sweltering heat, I know I would have been  able to eat a lot more. Another thing to note is that the food is a bit pricey. For example, 4 pork ribs is about 1 lb and that is about $20.\\n\\nNow- there is also a smart way to go about getting this Barbecue WITHOUT waiting in line. They do have a preorder option where you can order your food and then pick it up (without waiting in line). You do need to order at least 5 days in advance and there is not necessarily a guarantee they will grant your preorder wish.

I had too bites of meat and an unexpected boiled egg (no thank you, I'd rather stick with chicken). \\nFunny how when presented in a big plate to share it looks like generous portions with the salad in the middle and the cr√™pes all around, but when you actually start eating you realize that if it was plated individually it would not be that much (not that I am a huge eater).  Anyway, for $17, ordering the spicy meat dish, I expected more than a couple bites of chicken.  And no, I don't need that boiled egg.

The creme br√ªl√©e was delish and made even more special with \\"happy anniversary\\" written in chocolate across the top of the plate. Finished the evening off with a decaf americano and smiles on both our faces. We look forward to returning soon. Best service we've had in Vancouver (and many other parts of the world)."},{"name":"Tea Haus","address":"10815 Ranch Road 2222, Ste 207","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Lovely place!

We also added a few homemade sauces and those were really good as well. It wasn't busy when we were there, so we got our food relatively quickly as well.\\n\\nThe reason this doesn't get five stars is the service. This was our first time there and the woman who took our order was super rude and seemed really annoyed with us when we asked questions about what we were ordering. When we asked to add a sauce, we were told we had to switch out a sauce that we already ordered. When we asked to just pay for an extra sauce, she obliged, but it was just a really odd encounter. When we were discarding our trays, there were two employees cleaning the area. They stopped what they were doing and stared at us throwing our stuff away the entire time we did it and then started giggling and whispering, which again, was really odd and made me feel unwelcome. They charge a service fee automatically and I get why. They would receive no tips otherwise because of their bad attitudes."},{"name":"Contigo","address":"2027 Anchor Ln","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I had higher hopes for Contigo as their menu looked fantastic, as did the concept of their restaurant.  My wife, toddler son and I decided to use a gift card that we'd received this past weekend.  We didn't have a reservation and were immediately seated at 12pm on a Saturday.  The hostess was very sweet and friendly and even apologized for making us wait a full minute while she seated a party ahead of us.  \\n\\nWhen we were finally seated inside, we commented on the interested ambiance.  We had never been to a restaurant before that had dirt and rocks on the ground inside, which gave it a rustic \\"farmhouse\\" feel, which seems to be what they were going for.  From there things went a bit downhill unfortunately.  \\n\\nWe had ordered an orange juice for our son first and foremost.  Our waitress was not really personable to any great degree and even when we told her it was our first time at the restaurant she didn't give us really any further information about the food or concept.  We kind of just shrugged it off and ordered the hamburger with cheese and fries from the kid's menu as we were still deciding on our food and drink.  The waitress went to go get our son's juice.  She came back a few minutes later to take our drink order.  My wife ordered an iced tea and I ordered a frozen painkiller.  She came back about 7-8 minutes later with only my beverage, which was a blended alcoholic drink.  It was delicious and very stiff!  We ordered our food.  We ordered the Fried Chicken and Biscuits & the Burger and Fries with Cheese.  She left and few minutes later my son's burger plate came out.  It was a pretty small, kid's sized burger but really nothing special at all.  I was concerned that we still hadn't received my son's OJ or my wife's tea.  Finally a couple minutes later the OJ came but still no sign of my wife's tea.  \\n\\nWe didn't see our waitress for a little while at this point and I started feeling bad that I was getting buzzed and my wife didn't even have her iced tea, so I flagged our waitress down to remind her.  She apologized and brought it right out.  \\n\\nOur food took a while and when it finally did come out it really wasn't anything to write home about.  The burger was small, the patty was very thick so the medium rare quality only really existed directly in the middle while the outside of the patty was charred.  The veggies on the side did not seem very fresh (a bit odd for a farm fresh restaurant).  \\n\\nWe decided to skip the dessert we were planning on getting because we didn't feel like it was going to be as good as it sounded based on the quality of our meal.  \\n\\nWhen the bill came, I noticed that my son's small cheeseburger plate with bland fries came out to $10 total.  Everything here was pretty expensive and we didn't really think the food justified the price tag as it lacked the \\"wow\\" factor that so many other Austin restaurants deliver.  \\n\\nThe best thing I had in this experience was that frozen painkiller, of which I will be replicating at home.\\n\\nAs we left, the hostess was again very sweet and wished us a nice day.  \\n\\nIn a town full of great restaurants, I think this place needs to step up their game if they wish to compete...especially for the price."},{"name":"Salty Sow","address":"1917 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I have to admit it took me a few visits to get what all the rave is about but I am now a fan! \\n\\nMy first two visits I was seated in a corner of their enclosed patio. The first visit it was sweltering hot to the point the cr√®me fra√Æche in my \\"fresh & smoked\\" salmon rillette turned runny (I know first world problems). On my second visit even with reservations we were seated once again in the corner of the covered patio and this time it was freeeezing outside. Both times I asked to be seated indoors but I was told everything inside was reserved.\\n\\nMy recent dining experience was for a conference in which the attendance cost included dinner at Salty Sow. A las the weather and ambiance was perfect. Initially we were set up inside near the bar area and later we moved outside in their courtyard where Chef Harold was roasting up a pig. Our buffet/family style feast included:\\nChicken liver mousse\\nBrussels sprouts salad\\nTruffled deviled eggs with Salty Sow bacon\\nCharcuterie and cheese board\\nRoasted organic beets \\nOyster Boudin fritters \\nRoasted sow with sides of slaw and greens to make tacos\\n\\nEverything was absolutely delicious and service was excellent. While pork is their specialty the vegetarian and pescetarian dishes equally shine.  I tried two of the playfully named cocktails and they were also great. I liked the open relaxing atmosphere of the courtyard, weather permitting this would be prime real estate for happy hour. \\n\\nAs others have mentioned the daily happy is exceptional. It's 4:30-6:30pm and includes $2 off seasonal sips, $4 beers and a $5 menu that includes appetizers, cocktails and wine."},{"name":"Bin 26 Enoteca","address":"26 Charles St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"We had the most fantastic shrimp scampi with squid ink pasta.

I had a fettuccine dish in Seattle a month later and almost threw the plate out the window because all I could compare it to was what I had here. We also got the Frutti de Mare and it was just as amazing.
