The sauce and cheese and toppings were distributed totally unevenly, some parts covered in huge wads of mozzarella, some with none at all.  The crust was soggy at parts and crispy at others, and completely unable to support any of the toppings in the center.  The bottom of the crust had burnt cornstarch bits on the edges and the garlic flavor was overpowering...  But it was a divine specimen of a pie.  The Works was so loaded with toppings, it was impossible to eat without a fork and knife.

We live fairly close so we decided to walk there since we knew we wouldn't be eating the healthiest food. \\n\\nTo our surprise, there was no line out the door ( this was well before noon on a Saturday) and barely a line to order food.   We jumped in line and before you know it, we were at the counter. It's a cafeteria sort of setting where the employees prepare your plates behind the counter.  I was a little overwhelmed by the choices but the employees never made me feel rushed. I do see how the line can back up if people are indecisive. I would recommend grabbing a menu before jumping in line to decide what you want , then jumping in line. This would really prevent those lines that wrap around the restaurant.   Anyways, I skimmed the menu on the chalkboard and ended up getting the 2 piece fried chicken plate with a choice of 2 sides. I decided on the fried okra and the macaroni and cheese. Oh yeah, there's also a dessert case that catches your eye with all sorts of yummy cupcakes, pies, and sweets. I ended up grabbing a fried apple hand pie so that I wouldn't have to wait in line again.    My husband went with one of the signature plates and tried the chicken and dumplings with cornbread and something else that I can't recall.\\n\\nOur total was about $25 which is pretty hefty when you consider that you can go to Cracker Barrel and get the same kind of food for far less. So we call this a \\"Fancy Cracker Barrel\\" now.   The food was good. I did taste the peppery flavors in the fried chicken but I actually liked. The pieces were pretty generous in size and the skin was crunchy which is just the way I like it. I didn't get skimped like a few other reviewers did. So I wonder if it's because we came early. The fried okra was just ok. The breading fell apart easily but didn't matter since I tend to dunk mine in ketchup which is a personal choice. The mac and cheese was super rich and very velveeta tasting. I ended up getting a takeout box (yay for having them displayed at the drink counter) for my chicken and sides. It was heckuva lot of food for me.  My husband was content with his meal but did comment that the chicken was a tad dry.   I think the small handpie is waaaay overpriced at $3.50 so I know better than to get again. \\n\\nThe restaurant is really nice on the inside and it's great that they put this restaurant in an area of Winter Park that is evolving and changing.  The employees were friendly and even took our trays when we were finished..and with a smile.

I don't have any qualms with the taste or the cooking, but it was just ok. I was excited about tasting something unique (e.g. pomegranate ketchup or the vodka battered rings) but the tastes just didn't stand out enough. The price was ok, not too expensive, and the portions were just enough. I will say the desserts sounded and looked appetizing. Unfortunately I didn't try them.\\n\\nConsidering I don't eat beef and only eat bacon as far as pork goes, there was not a lot of options for burgers. I could see some of the beef burgers tasting really good, oh well. \\n\\nI'd suggest trying this place once. However, Farmburger is still the best burger place I've been to and will continue to be my regular burger spot."},{"name":"Cafe Paisano","address":"182 W State Rd 434, Ste 1000","city":"Longwood","stars":"4.5","text":"A friend recommended their pizza, so we took the family in for a try.

Being impatient I went back to the desk after about 30 mins and was told that we'd be sat in about five mins.\\n\\nDuring the wait. I asked a manager if it was possible to get some water while I waited, he went to the bar and told the bartender to give me some water, and the bartender complied but acted as if he was bothered to stop doing what he was doing to give me a cup of water.  Please note if you get a to-go cup of water, it does not come with a lid, and you are not able to take the cup into the stadium when you enter.\\n\\nOnce we were sat our waitress came to the table within a short period of time and explained she was training someone and he would be responsible for bringing us our food and we could stop her if she passed by, but that the trainee would be over shortly to introduce himself and would take care of the order.  Since we had already waited about 40 mins to be sat at the table, we explained we were ready to order and she took our drink and food order.  The trainee came and brought our drinks (water and sprite), but never introduced himself.\\n\\nAbout 20 mins after we order our food it was brought to the table by, we ordered three different types of wings, buffalo, Korean, and firecracker.  We also ordered the crab lobster artichoke dip and the onion ring tower.  All of the wings were cold, the dip was slightly warm and although the onion rings weren't cold, they weren't hot either.  We sent the wings back and requested they be removed from our check.  The manager we spoke with agreed and took them back, while we finished up the dip and onion rings, they brought out another order of the wings and we explained we no longer wanted the wings and although the waitress rolled her eyes and said they were now hot, she did take them back and removed them from our check.  These are baked wings, they are not fried, maybe that would help them hold some heat, and who wants baked buffalo wings??\\n\\nThe dip was passable, but you can tell its something they warm up in the microwave, because the bowl it comes in is piping hot, but the dip itself is barely warm enough to enjoy.  They give a good amount of chips and pita bread to accompany the dish.\\n\\nI'd order the onion ring tower again if I was to ever go back, it was the most appetizing of all the items we ordered and the two dips they provide with them are tasty. \\n\\nNot anything special but their menu will give your way more options than is really necessary for a restaurant at a baseball park."},{"name":"Blue Star Donuts","address":"1155 SW Morrison St, Ste 102","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"All of the yeast donuts at Blue Star have a very odd citrus flavor.

The entire place is nicely decorated, especially the fireplaces, and the servers look good too.\\n\\nBabette's serves brunch and dinner.  At dinner, they offer both a prix fixe menu and a regular menu with small plates and entrees.  The menu is European-influenced.  Here some dishes I've tried:\\n\\nSmall plates:\\nPiroshkis of pork and veal with tarragon butter sauce\\nSmoked salmon and trout with grapefruit\\nArtichoke and olive ravioli in a wine butter sauce\\n\\nEntrees:\\nChicken breast with artichoke, heart of palm compote lightly breaded and sauteed with a tarragon butter sauce\\nSlow roasted pork with semolina gnocchi, plum chutney, sauteed spinach, and a natural pan jus\\n\\nThe piroshkis are unbelievable.  I could order 20 of these bad boys and be happy.  The flavoring inside is fantastic and each bite is melt-in-your-mouth good.  A must-order.\\n\\nThe smoked salmon and trout are good.  Both of the fish are fresh.  The salmon portion is commonplace.  The artichoke and olive ravioli is another superb dish.  Maybe it's all the butter they use.  The flavors of the artichoke and olive really come out.\\n\\nThe chicken breast is impressive.  I've never had chicken breast so soft and tender before.  How does the chef do that?  Babette's has, hands down, the best chicken breast I've ever eaten.  Kudos.\\n\\nThe slow roasted pork plate is pretty good.  I'm drawn to the semolina gnocchi more than anything else.  It's got great consistency and is simply delicious.\\n\\nBabette's is quite popular (est. 1992) and the restaurant runs like a well-oiled machine.

We ended up with a wooden board covered with Serrano ham, manchego cheese, olives, and ceviche mussels and it was perfect. Next, we got the white asparagus, which was cooked perfectly and sprinkled with crispy pancetta, and the hangar steak with truffle vinaigrette, which was a perfect medium rare. And because we're pigs, we also ordered the paella with pork belly and chorizo. The paella is huge so one serving still works for two people. There was so much protein that it was almost overwhelming. The flavors were deep and complex and the crispy bits of rice around the pan were the best part.\\n\\nAnd, because we are that fat, we decided to do the crepas for dessert.

I came here with a friend for dinner, and admittedly, at first, I was nervous because I had read past reviews, and most of them said that there'd be a wait, so I was a little apprehensive. However, it was a Tuesday night, so I decided to give it a chance, and luckily, through the windows, we could see that there were a few empty tables.\\n\\nMy first impression of the restaurant was that it was cozy--the lighting was dim and there were a few sofas in the waiting area, so comfort was my first emotion. We were automatically seated, and the impression I got from the hostess was that service was going to be amazing. And I wasn't wrong, but I'll get to that later.\\n\\nMy friend and I had a difficult time choosing what to get because everything sounded amazing, but ultimately, she ended up getting the Tikka Masala and I got the Jeera Saag, both with chicken. A little thing that I appreciated was that each item on the menu had a recommended wine pairing, which if I were in the mood for it, this would make things so much easier as I know nothing about alcohol pairings. \\n\\nOur waiter was incredibly attentive and friendly. When we got our food, he would periodically check up on us to make sure we were happy with our meals. And when he saw that we were both running out of rice, he went to get us some more. Our water was filled without asking, so that made for a +1 in my book. \\n\\nFood-wise, our meals were nothing short of incredible. With both of our dishes, we decided to share everything to get a full experience. The Tikka Masala was creamy and flavorful but not too overpowering, and I can definitely see why it's everyone's favorite. But what really stole the show was the Jeera Saag. It's pur√©ed spinach full of spices, and the flavor was delicious. I don't normally say this about a lot of foods, but I really loved the texture; it was creamy and smooth on the tongue while also emphasizing that it was made with spinach, so it felt like I was eating a healthy dish. The rice wasn't too hard or too soft, which I really liked. Balance is difficult, but this restaurant has it.\\n\\nAll in all, I would definitely come back here if I'm ever back in Austin, and I'd totally recommend anyone who loves Indian food to give this place a try.

I remember enjoying it during my previous visits and was looking forward to eating here again on the night we stopped in for dinner.\\n\\nAfter being seated and ordering some wine, we were served with a basket of rolls (garlic and butter rolls, I believe) and then ordered Bruschetta and calamari appetizers. I didn't try the calamari (it was at the other end of the table, and my sister/father/sister's fianc√© ate most of it before I even had a chance to ask for some), but the Bruschetta was very good. We also had salads before dinner; those were good, as well. Mine had a house dressing, which was decent ... but perhaps I should have chosen something different. I don't know very much at all about wine, but the wine (red) we had was delicious. That, I know.\\n\\nFor dinner, I ordered the Fettucine Carbonara ($12.99) and added grilled chicken ($2.99 extra) to it. The dish already included saut√©ed bacon & onions in a creamy Parmesan cheese sauce, and then is tossed with the Fettucine. As I ordered, the server told me that this was his favorite dish here, so I was expecting good things. It did not disappoint - the portion was just right and it was better than I expected it would be. It could've used a little more bacon flavor, but I can't complain. It still was delicious and I ate nearly all of it, leaving only a little bit left to take home with me. For dessert, we shared a few cannolis, which also were great.\\n\\nA few weeks before this visit, I had a slice of cheese pizza from here after some friends ordered some and allowed me to try a piece. It was very good. I'd like to come back here again soon to try some more of the restaurant's pizza so I can form a thorough opinion. I think that was the first time I tried it - during each visit here, I've ordered a pasta dish or something along those lines.\\n\\nThis really is a nice place and I was impressed with the service and atmosphere during the recent visit. It probably is more of a 4-star establishment, but I'm giving it the full 5-star rating since everything here during the recent visit was excellent and, in most ways, better than I remembered/was expecting. If you're in the area, give this place a try! You also can't go wrong at Luna's (down the street & in the Bayridge Sushi shopping center). Both are excellent.\\n\\nNote: This restaurant's shopping center is a little tricky to get into. You can't access it with a left turn if you're coming from 427/Casselberry/Winter Springs/etc.; you'll have to pass the restaurant and then make a U-turn down the street, and then come back the way you came and turn right into the shopping center.

Staff was great and place was spotless. Don't see many places with a revolving door! I had the en-light-end menu item with a half flat bread pizza (California) and it came with a tiny little salad where dressing was not evenly coating all the pieces of lettuce, a very minor thing. I want to reiterate, the salad was just tiny, but the half sized order of pizza was filling enough for a small lady like me. Nice touch leaving the cucumber and tomato on the side of the salad instead of mixing them in like most places do. The flat bread pizza was AMAZING! Crust was awesomely crispy and the toppings were just divine. My date had the classic burger with thin fries and it was fantastic. I would give 5 stars except that the staff was really trying to upsell us on appetizers and deserts to the point of being sorta annoying. Also tried to clear my date's plate while we were still munching on the last of his fries. Don't try to hurry us out when business is slow, if there were people waiting for a table we would've hustled but the lunch rush was definitely over. On the flip side we were checked on frequently and our drinks were always full, so great service on that aspect. I suspect the upselling tactic is an agenda pushed by management. Maybe I'd order the chips and salsa if they were not $5. I mean seriously, five bucks for chips and salsa (which many places give out for free) when the new chicken fried steak is only $6.50 until 3pm? What non-sense.

We patiently watched it being renovated while the smoke house was being built and it was only a matter of time before my picinic-basket-raiding partner Boo Boo Bear and I both decided we needed to investigate the meaty goodness of Terry Black's Barbecue. Upon entering, a large sign explains how it works; \\"grab a plate, choose your sides, get your meat.\\"\\n\\nWhile all of the sides and cobblers looked delicious, I wanted a traditional barbecue experience and opted for small sides of barbecue beans, cole slaw, potato salad and macaroni and cheese. All were high-quality barbecue fare, though the potato salad definitely outshined the others with a perfect mix of seasoning, creaminess and a light mustard tang.\\n\\nAs I was choosing sides, I noticed they had smoked turkey breast. Turkey can go one of two ways -- moist and delicious or dry and flavorless. Being a big fan of turkey done right, I had to try it to see how Terry Black's stood the test. With 1/4 pound of smoked turkey breast and 1/4 pound of pork ribs on my plate, and Boo Boo Bear with turkey and brisket on his plate, we were ready to dig in and chose not to bother with white bread, sliced onions or pickles.\\n\\nThere were three bottles of sauce on the table -- a Sweet & Tangy sauce, Terry Black's original and another that lost it's label but seemed to be the original. Both sauces were great but being a barbecue joint, it's all about the meat. After drizzling a tiny amount of Terry Black's original sauce on half of the turkey, I sliced into it and took a bite. This is smoked turkey done right! Moist, delicious, flavorful and in no need of any sauce at all. Then I sliced into the pork rib, which slid of the bone and fell apart on the plate. Again, moist, delicious, no need for sauce and bursting with flavor. \\n\\nI don't know what woods Terry Black's uses or what their rubs are composed of, but Terry Black's is the real deal and simply some of the best barbecue I've ever had in Austin.

We are both in our early 70s. This year, she didn't feel like a full lunch, but wanted to have a fancy desert, and suggested Prosperity Pie in Multnomah Village.\\n\\nAfter loading her motorized wheelchair / scooter into her car, she drove us over to Multnomah Village. Parking was actually available, which helped. Getting the wheelchair up onto the sidewalk where the car was parked mid block was impossible where we parked, so she motored along next to the parked cars, in a traffic lane, to a corner where there was an accessible ramp. After getting up the ramp onto the sidewalk, we traveled a block further east/ north to Prosperity Pie.\\n\\nGetting into the store would have been impossible for my friend if I hadn't been there to open and hold the door. for her to motor in. Door is heavy; no automatic door opener, and not do-able from a wheel chair. No apparent bell or buzzer outside the door fr a person to use to signal the staff behind the counter.  Based on what happened with the rest of our visit, I doubt the staff could be bothered to respond if there was a  bell / buzzer.\\n\\nWe got in and looked around. There is a counter on the right behind which most of the deserts sit and where there is an ordering spot and a cash register toward the rear. No apparent order taking at a table. You need to order first, then find a table.\\n\\nWe ordered, my birthday guest first. The person taking the order -- middle aged woman. brownish reddish hair - just wasn't paying attention, only going through the motions. Never figured out that the two of us were together, even though she was looking at us come in together with me holding the door open so my guest could get her wheelchair / scooter in. My companion gave her order - berry pie slice, coffee - and counter lady rang it up and requested payment from companion.  I interjected and said that we were together and I 'd like to order as well. I, too, ordered a slice of berry pie and coffee. I was presented with a bill for $ 15.00. Kind of high , to say the least. Cash register / order lady walked away, came back with two slices of pie. Placed them on the counter next to cash register.\\n\\nNot sure how the cash register /order lady thought my companion was going to carry her pie to the table. On her lap in the wheelchair / scooter maybe, while steering the chair with one hand and operating the motor speed controller with her other? \\n\\nThese were not paper cups with lids; these were ceramic standard coffee cups, with saucers, with hot coffee sloshing around in them as one carried them. Just perfect for transporting on one's lap, no?\\n\\nI just sort of stood there, dumbfounded. I eventually picked up both orders of pie and we went to find a table. Did so, and I got my companion situated at the table after removing a chair so there was room for the wheel chair /  scooter.  Getting to the empty table was just special given the way the tables were spaced and the chairs blocking the aisleways between the tables.\\n\\nThe coffee? Two cups, also deposited at the counter / cash register while we were getting a table. Apparently we were also  expected to big  carry the coffees to the table. Glad I was there to do so, because that would have been a neat trick for my companion to carry the hot coffee to the table on her lap while driving the motorized scooter /wheelchair. .\\n\\nWhat was even more annoying than the rude -- indeed almost cruel -- service was the large jar near the cash register at the counter with the big sign \\"TIPS\\" on it. Apparently for their total non service, the two ladies at the counter expected to receive tips.\\n\\nWow.\\n\\nThe pie was good. Generous sized piece. The coffee was okay, after I made a third trip back to the counter to get napkins; forks for the pie; spoons for the coffee, and sweetener and creamer.\\n\\nFor a place that sells its \\"New Age\\" \\"vibe\\" and loving care and concern for its greater community, these clowns have no concept how to take care of a differently abled or wheelchair / scooter bound customer.  This place spends a  lot of time and effort selling its image, but thats all it is -- phony image of caring and concern.  They sure have no concept of actually performing what they appear to profess to practic\\n\\nHaving that \\"tips\\" jar out there when they weren't willing to do a damn bit of actual service added yet more insult to injury, and really was the ultimate in arrogance.\\n\\nTo paraphrase Alice B.

Of course this is subjective, but to semi-validate the point, the only two things I remember from both Gusto visits are their wonderful homemade potato chips and their unique Orange Olive Oil cake. That particular dessert is good stuff, if arguably a one trick pony after the third or fourth bite. But if you do try it, have them accompany it with their salted caramel ice cream, for a near perfect combination. I should probably disclose at this point that I've not been to either of the Vespaios, mainly because I can't figure out how to park backwards at an angle on South Congress. \\n\\nGusto does offer lunch combos at a good price from 11am to 4, and I hear the Happy Hour discounts for wine and apps are a great deal.

We brought my mother here too, and she also enjoyed it. The casual decor is really cute and fun. They have a lot of big tables and booths and they're pretty good about putting you at a nice table with some space around you when it's not too busy. It can be pretty crowded and noisy, but you still feel like you have some privacy. We have also really liked almost every waiter we've had here. They're friendly but not intrusive. They have a lot of interesting and delicious appetizers. I like the \\"be good to yourself\\" special, which is some kind of fish, broiled with salad and brown rice. I often get bluefish here, and it's always good. The bermuda chowder is really interesting and spicy. I also like the cornbread, bread, and beer selection is pretty decent. Deserts are quite special as well, they tend to be an interesting take on some homespun classic like banana cream pie or rhubarb cobbler. \\n\\nI would have given SS 5 stars a few months ago, but I felt they were slipping at our last couple of visits. First, they stopped doing cheap date night on Thursdays, and the waiter was a little snippy about it at our first visit after they stopped. Second, on the last two visits they've done something I find super annoying, which is seat a party of two right next to another party of two on a shared banquette when there are empty tables nearby. That's just lazy and rude and awkward for the diners who get stuck right next to each other in a half empty restaurant.  Third, at our last visit, the fried chicken, which is usually awesome, was overcooked and a little dry.

Arrived around 6:30pm on a beautiful, albeit hot, night.  Since it was so hot outside and the sun was going down, we opted to sit inside.  There was a wait list to sit outside, but we were seated promptly.  Our waitress immediately came over, pointed out the drink menu, and took our drink orders.  Ordered the spicy shrimp as an appetizer - not my cup of tea, but was deemed very good by the others.  For our entrees, one ordered the fish taco, another the pastrami sandwich, hubby got the fish and chips, and I ordered the mussel appetizer.  All in all, everything was ok.  Food came out way to fast though - we were still working on the appy and they wanted to clear it before it was finished.\\n\\nWhile service and food were good, it was very hot inside the restaurant.  That was partially due to the fact that the servers were constantly leaving the sliders open when they went onto the patio.  But I don't think the a/c was working well.  It was also very loud inside, making conversation an issue.\\n\\nIf you are not eating, or are waiting for a table, another bar area is upstairs, where the old restaurant was.  They were very picky when checking in - your party had to all be there, you had to be eating to get a table, etc.  Parking lot is small, but they have another lot next door, so all is good there.\\n\\nWould I go back?  Probably not.  For the four of us, the bill was $140, without tip.

Both times have been busy so if you're coming with a larger group, I'd recommend making a reservation. The inside is modern, dark and intimate; interestingly enough, it was previously a pho place. Service was decent but you'll have to flag them down if you want more banchan and/or tea refills.\\n\\nThe menu is split into appetizers, bibimbap, hot pot, off the grill (pork, beef and chicken), meat on rice and makguksu. Basically, 28 items. Some of the prices are out of wack so you do need to pick and choose what you order.\\n\\nTrip #1\\nFirst visit, we dropped in on a Tuesday evening (around 7:15pm)\\n- Banchan - kimchi, sliced fish cakes, pickled daikon and spicy cucumbers. The spicy cucumbers was fantastic. We may have asked for a few refills of just cucumbers...\\n- Gamjatang jeongol (#16) ($29.95) - pork back-bone hot pot with two bowls of rice. Five decent chunks of tender pork bone. Loved how much vegetables were thrown into the mix. The only thing lacking was that the broth didn't have any heat/spiciness to it.\\n\\nTrip #2\\nSecond time around we came with a group of 5. For a Sunday evening (6:30pm), it was busy.\\n- Banchan - same kimchi (homemade, good kick) and sliced fish cakes. The other banchan this time was bean sprouts and Korean lettuce salad. Never seen the latter before but it had a good vinegary dressing.\\n- Haemul pajeon (#4) ($17.95) - seafood and green onion pancake. Decent but there wasn't much seafood in it and it could have been crispier. It was also a bit salty.\\n- Haemul soondubu jjigae (#12) ($12.95) - soft tofu seafood soup that comes with a bowl of rice. Again, not much seafood (maybe a couple of prawns) but the tofu was soft. Soup was standard. \\n- Ttugbaegi gamjatang (#15) ($15.95) - pork back-bone hot pot with a bowl of rice. Delicious and satisfying; just like the first time we had it. Meat was fall off the bone and broth had good depth this time. \\n- Wine samgyupsal (#20) ($19.95) - pork belly marinated in red wine. Never tried this before; you can really taste the red wine marinated into the meat but we've had better pork belly elsewhere.\\n- Spicy dakgalbi (#26) ($19.95) - stir-fried chicken with vegetables in spicy sauce. We added mozzarella cheese ($5.00) which is excessively overpriced. The spicy sauce was satisfying as was the chicken. It also came with teokbokki (fat pieces), onions, mushrooms and green onion. \\n\\nWill come back again to Yook's.

Poncey-Highland Chipotle is located along a very busy stretch of Ponce, next door to Friends on Ponce, and across the street from Green's and Murder Kroger.  The clientele at this Chipotle is often young, hip, and urban.\\n\\nThe parking lot is small.  The restaurant acknowledges this with signs that say, words to the effect of: \\"Our burritos are big, but our parking lot is small.\\"  It's not uncommon to see a panhandler directing traffic in the parking lot and asking for money later.  If you can't find parking, I suggest parallel parking along Maiden Ln. behind the restaurant.  I don't know how strict Friends and other neighboring businesses are with towing Chipotle customers, so be careful.\\n\\nCompared to other locations, this Chipotle is relatively small.  It does have a nice enclosed and elevated patio which is a prime spot for people watching (traffic watching?) on Ponce.\\n\\nI've generally found the food and service to be good, which is consistent with other locations.  Chipotle takes pride in its naturally raised meats, organic vegetables, and sustainable building practices.  Tastewise, I can't tell a significant difference between a burrito at Chipotle and a burrito at Moe's or Willy's -- they all taste good to me -- but it doesn't hurt to know that you're eating better stuff at Chipotle.\\n\\nBurritos, burrito bowls, tacos, and salads range in price from $6.25 to $6.65 per order depending on the meat selection.  Meats include chicken, steak, carnitas, and barbacoa.  Cilantro-lime rice, black beans, pinto beans, salsa, cheese, sour cream, and other toppings are included.  Guacamole is $1.80 extra.  I'm a fan of the rice.\\n\\nLike other burrito joints, Chipotle has a made-to-order, line ordering format.  You control what goes into your burrito from the very beginning.  The open kitchen is located behind the ordering counter, so you can see all the meats and other ingredients being prepared and cooked fresh.  During peak times, it's possible for the ordering line to run out of certain ingredients when it's your turn to order.\\n\\nOne of my favorite items to get is the burrito bowl because it's simple, tasty, and relatively healthy.  It's also easy to transport on-the-go.  I like to get chicken or steak.  All of the meats aren't bad.  The chicken is surprisingly tender.  I usually load my burrito bowls with all available toppings, particularly corn salsa and spicy salsa (in addition to the standard pico de gallo).  The spicy salsa is indeed spicy.  If that's not enough, hot sauce is available.\\n\\nDrinks, condiments, and silverware are self-serve.  Satisfactory service.\\n\\nOverall, not a bad in-town Chipotle.

Asked if these meals come with anything like french fries. Was told  'no'. I ordered small fries for our son.   I ordered lobster roll. Was asked if I wanted lunch or dinner size. Asked what was the difference. Was told one is with hot dog bun and the other is bigger putting on a hoagie bun. I ordered the dinner size. When the meals arrived,  a plate of fries came and I also had fries on my plate.  Didn't know mine came with fries since when I had asked,  was told no.

Most definitely not 5 stars. C'mon four dollars per taco? You can get an authentic fresh taco (minus the cheese and avocado) for one dollar in Houston. With added ingredients, it ought to be around the $2 range, but nope, not in Austin, where the diversity and differing socioeconomic classes are limited. I wasn't even a huge fan of the additional cheese and avocado; maybe because I crave real tacos instead of texmex. \\n\\nTheir complimentary sauces were legit, but my bf and I who love our hot sauce couldn't enjoy theirs at its full capacity. Our tacos are supposed to have the sauce drizzled all over, but since it was too spicy, we had to use it sparingly, even when we craved more saucy flavor. \\n\\nTheir version of a pastora taco did have impressive flavor, but the one here could of added more fresh herbs and onions and halved the amount of the cheese and avocado which gives more heaviness than the flavor. Or they could omit the cheese and avocado all together, making an authentic taco with corn tortillas. \\n\\nAs for the Fish tacos, my bf loved it, but ...the steak taco was so completely passable. It was shredded steak with no impressive flavor. Reminded me of leftovers or pulled pork without tasty marinade. \\n\\nRepeating others reviewers important info: the truck shares a small block with the BBQ truck. The sign is small and missable. \\nAlso they have call in service so you won't have to wait 20 minutes \\n\\nLastly, the service and ambiance is cool, like most places in Austin\\n\\nBut what matters most, is the quality of food and value.

Upon sitting we were given menus, but not offered kids' menus. We simply assumed they don't have a kids' menu at all and because our kids eat anything this was no big deal. We look at the specials and see spaghetti and meatballs. What kid doesn't like that, right? We sell our kids on that and go to order it. Our waitress then tells us that they are out of meatballs. On your 'specials'? Three tables into the day? Not so special, I suppose. So I then ask what else are you out of before we continue ordering. She mentions THREE other items they don't have! THEN after all of this she volunteers an entire kids' menu verbally, but says to hold tight while she makes sure they still have the kids' menu items.  (SIGH)  Sadly, as the place is filling up the time between her trips to our table are longer and longer. They DO have chicken fingers. Success! I order the Bison Burger, my husband and our friend both ordered the There Burger, and our two kids had chicken fingers and fries. She asks how I want my burger cooked and I said Medium. While waiting on food, I take my 5 year old to the bathroom. It is a wreck. Toilet paper is all over the floor and hairs are scattered in both sinks. I easily gathered this place gets more bar-like in the evenings and the bathrooms had not been touched since. Our friend was on his one hour lunch break and at 5 minutes to 1pm we still didn't have our food. He finally left with no food. Another server joins her on the floor. Our food finally arrives and my husband is very pleased with his There Burger.  I thought the Bison Burger was good, but certainly not a touch pink on the inside and most definitely not worth $14.50. And - of course - our kids think the chicken fingers are great. She boxes our friend's There Burger (as we requested) and discounted our ticket 20% (without our having said a word about our displeasure with the experience). As people who love eating experiences ranging from Six Feet Under and the Food Truck Park to Rathbun's and Miller Union, we know what good food is and don't mind paying the appropriate value. Ultimately my vote is that I've had way better, I won't be back, and this place needs some organization and quality assurance."},{"name":"Veracruz All Natural","address":"2505 Webberville Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Tasty tacos, quite unique flavor also.

Quack's always closed at 2pm... and there were cars outside, and people inside, so I was felt  something strange happening here... and what it was ain't exactly clear ... until I noticed the new sign out front.\\n\\n\\"Wow, so Quack's is gone?\\" I asked the waitstaff  hopefully. \\"Yes,  a month ago. The place has a new owner now, a new name, a new attitude and a new philosophy.\\" \\n\\nStarting modestly a month ago, and in such a subtle way that many coffee hounds in search of an early morning java fix may not have even realized they were are no longer in Quack's, Cherrywood Coffeehouse already shows a LOT of promise. Good coffees, good food, good beers, good people, and they are now open 7am until 10pm weekdays, later on Saturdays. They are gradually upgrading the place, say they'll add live music on weekends soon, and have free wifi and a free internet terminal in the corner for use by customers. \\n\\nThe menu is modest and short, but growing. What I've tasted so far has all been great. I particularly liked the specials i've tried... Crunchy Fish Tacos, made with real fish and Thai Slaw, two for $5.50; and the  Pulled Poblano Pork tacos, with deep flavor, also 2 for $5.50. Beers currently on tap include Fireman's 4, Lone Star, Abita TurboDog, Spaten Optimator (!!) and Woodchuck Cider. \\n\\nFor breakfast runs they make such neighborhood favorites as Sol Tacos, Luna Tacos, other breakfast combinations, and an assortment of pastries which go well with their tasty coffee, which the preceding crew never seemed to master. \\n  \\nFunny story - the first time I was in the place I thought the new sign might just be sly new packaging of the stale old Quack's formula, partly because I was served by Eli, who used to work for Quack's. He was the only person in the old days I could count on to rise above the famous indifference the Quack's staff regularly displayed. Great guy, helpful and knowledgeable as usual, he answered all my probing questions... then he asked if I was the person who had written the (now somewhat notorious) Yelp review slamming the service at Quack's. Outted by the staff within only a few minutses, oh my!! \\"Yes, indeed, that was me.\\"\\n\\nHe went on to tell me that he had shown my review to the previous owner, who proceeded to blow off my critique with a shrug. I guess we now know the source of Quack's irritating indifference and slack attitude, eh? \\n\\nIn any case, the new owner seems to come from the opposite end of the scale. Drop in if you're in the neighborhood and check out the new Cherrywood Coffeehouse. Nice folks.

The two of them have a pretty sophisticated methodology for rating breakfast tacos... we've spent many a Sunday morning running around town, trying one taco per establishment, and carefully rating each place against the same set of standards. Ratings are based on 3 criteria:\\n\\n- Tortillas (home made or store bought)\\n- Fillings (how delicious and greasy is the chorizo)\\n- Salsa (home made, how spicy, does it add or detract from the fillings)\\n\\nVeracruz All Natural knocked it out of the park on all 3. The tortillas are homemade and you MUST TRY THE CORN. The chorizo is great with just the right amount of grease, and the salsa is a great combination of roasted ingredients and fresh avocado.\\n\\nI also love their fresh juice drinks, specifically the magical spinach/orange/pineapple concoction.\\n\\nThere are THREE downsides to note, though I have figured out how to work around them.\\n\\n1) Word has spread, and they stay busy on the weekends.\\n\\nWorkaround? Call ahead, and expect 20 - 30 minutes for food prep.\\n\\n2) Regular menu isn't available on Sundays. \\n\\nBrunch menu isn't bad, but they don't do tacos on Sundays. Go on Saturday if you're craving their food, or be prepared to find another spot for your Sunday morning hangover cure.\\n\\n3) They like to put cheese on EVERYTHING, even when you order it without. My wife can't do cheese, so this has proven problematic with a couple of call ahead orders. \\n\\nOnce I realized that \\"chorizo\\" and \\"cheese\\" sounded very similar on a cell phone in a tiny food truck, I simply started adding \\"NO CHEESE\\" loud and clear to the end of my order.

Yes, I realize they are new and that going only once isn't the fairest way to review a place. So call this a prelim review. How's that?\\n\\nMy only other experience with Twisted Taco was a few years ago when my husband and I attempted to go to the one in Midtown on a weeknight. We were told they were holding a Texas Hold'em tournament and that this took precedent over other customers (never mind the rest of us). We got the message and left.\\n\\nMy friend and I went to lunch around 11:20 a.m. on a weekday and it was not very busy. The place definitely looked different than it had as a Chilli's. Much more open. I was not expecting the booths that edged the room to have individual flat screen TVs. That was a little odd. By the time we left, the place was pretty full.\\n\\nI will give kudos to our waitress. She was pleasant, helpful and came back often to check on us. The refills were always at the ready. I have not a single complaint about her. The chips were crispy and hot (a plus) and the salsa was decent. I've had much worse.\\n\\nWhat I did take issue with was the extreme mediocrity of the food. As someone else here has stated, the black beans tasted as if they'd just come out of a can. Complete with the broth they came in. Not good. The rice, while plentiful, was dry and flavorless. \\n\\nI ordered the Wyatt Earp taco (pork, cilantro, onion) and the Down Home taco (fried shrimp, remoulade, salsa). The first thought I had when our waitress put the plate down was, \\"Man, the chef here sure is stingy.\\" There was more tortilla than filler, never a good sign. \\n\\nThe Wyatt Earp had decent pork but had no real juice/sauce to make the cilantro and onions work well with it. At times I felt like I was chewing grass (not that I hang out in a pasture). I immediately thought of the carnita tacos at Taqueira Los Hermanos and thought what a pale imitation this was. Not even close to that perfection.\\n\\nThe Down Home taco was somewhat better, the remoulade sauce had a nice flavor. But again, stingy with the shrimp. I would have loved just a few more.\\n\\nI am definitely going to return to see how things progress at Twisted Taco. It wasn't horrible. But it was a bit of a yawner."},{"name":"Santarpio's Pizza","address":"111 Chelsea St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Jared: \\"I'll have a combo and we'd like to split a sausage pizza.\\"\\nMe: \\"I'll have a combo.\\"\\nMike: \\"Can I see a menu?\\"\\nServer: \\"That's not going to help you, hun.

It is a Boston landmark that attracts curious transplants (like my friends and I), but at the same time it maintains popularity with actual non-rhotic English speaking locals. This could be due to the simplicity of the place. She wasn't joking about that menu, you can have pizza, a lamb kebab, grilled sausage, or a combination.

Then the Manager David walked up and explained that they did not have the booth I had requested for our reservation. He explained it would be another 30 minutes or more to get the requested booth. My wife was upset but also very hungry so we reluctantly accepted the table they had open. Our waiter took our drink order and David offered us an appetizer for our .inconvenience. For a regular dinner this would have been a nice gesture, for a wedding celebration not so much. We ordered the crab stack and waited a long time for our appetizer. The waiter hovered around but never came back , finally the crab stack arrived. It was good albeit the scorching sauce completely covering the plate. Eventually our waiter came back and took our order. We both ordered the ribeye steak and mashed potatoes. Salads were good , then we waited again. I guess the manager David noticed the look on our faces as booth after booth were seated after us and finally offered to move us just as our steaks were being brought out. David had the steaks taken back into the kitchen and they cleared a booth for us and moved us to the booth. The same two steaks came back out to our booth , mine was slightly overcooked and my wife's was slightly undercooked. Our waiter asked how were our  steaks and I told him my wife's was undercooked he just looked away and said try it and if we need to we can bring another hot plate ? ( I assume to finish cooing it ? ) My wife was over this entire dinner and refused my insistence to return the undercooked steak. Our waiter walked by and noticed her picking at the edible parts, she ate maybe 5 bites from a 16oz steak. No other inquiry's from our waiter on the undercooked steak,  just we are giving you a free desert because of your experience . Both of our steaks beyond the cooking errors were also not of the quality you would expect from a great steak house. Mashed potatoes were hard just after being brought to the table. The waiter asked if we wanted more bread we said no they promptly brought us a complete new loaf and exclaimed here is the bread you asked for.

They have a good selection of beers, enough TVs for you to watch most of the sports, and the seating is communal. I went midday, so hard to say how the communal seating would feel late at night when the place is packed; my guess is it'd be a fun environment. I see this more as a way to get the classic donuts late at night without having to wait outside.

No, not that way...\\n\\n\\"According to Wikipedia, the 'Farm-to-table' movement refers to the stages of food production that...\\n\\nNo.  Not that way either.  Let's go with:\\n\\n\\"Many people will walk in and out of your life, but only true friends will leave footprints in your heart\\" - Eleanor Roosevelt\\n\\nWalking into North Burnet's \\"Barley Swine\\" on opening night was like bumping into an old friend that you don't remember why you lost touch with.  \\n\\nI've had memorable experiences at the original incarnation on South Lamar.  I've been for a quiet, special occasion evening with my lovely young bride.  I've enjoyed a pork-and-alcohol-fest with my visiting sister who lives overseas, where neither pork nor alcohol is allowed.  I've joined a group of yelpers, post-event, just to sample that night's complete dessert menu.  I met my bestie there, aptly while sharing a \\"hoe cake\\" with her, while seated at the \\"rockstar\\" (as we called it) table in the back.  But it's not just the \\"moments\\" that spark my fondness for Barley Swine.  I'd never have gone back so many times, if not for the food.\\n\\nSo, just how does the new version's food stack up?  Since the happy hour menu was not yet up and running, and since my dining buddy and I wanted to be (literally) running later that night, we chose just four of the fifteen current shared plate offerings, and the bar staff helped us pair beers with them.  It started with the carefully plated (yes, garnish is often placed with tweezers) pickled Spanish mackerel.  The knock on mackerel is that it is \\"too fishy\\", and this course did celebrate the bold flavor of the ingredient.  The \\"peanut ranch\\" was very subtle, but the citrus bits brought a fresh and bright counterpoint. The \\"crab tamale\\" was a clever play on the double meaning of that word, with the inside of a crab shell lined with masa (acting like a tamale's corn husk), but also the \\"tomalley\\" (the rich crustacean delicacy often called \\"crab fat\\") being used here as an ingredient.  The pig skin \\"noodles\\" were reminiscent of thinly sliced calamari.  The accompanying shrimp dumpling was not the dim sum play I was expecting, but more like a \\"chicken and...\\" version.  The spicy fried chicken had an interesting smoked fish infused caramel sauce.  My dining buddy, however, seemed to have swiped all the pickles from that plate, after swooning while tasting the first one.\\n\\nI could wax poetic about the \\"good old days\\" at Barley, with GM Jason greeting us at the door (and telling us about the wait), Billy being our charming food and beer \\"sommelier\\" at the bar, and occasionally, if we were lucky and he wasn't too busy expediting, getting a plate brought to our table by Mr. Gilmore himself.  Things are different now.  The kitchen (and staff) seems to have quadrupled.  The seating is just about doubled (65 now vs. 36).  The charm of the original cozier location has not yet been replaced by the still developing personality of the new. \\n\\nTwo of the items we chose were described as having a \\"hot sauce\\" or being \\"spicy\\", but I felt they could have been more bold than they were.  I never felt absolutely blown away by a course, like I had so many times on South Lamar.  But this was opening night.  They are still getting their feet under them a bit, still playing with platings, not yet having their \\"Swine Time\\" happy hour up and running, no board specials yet, etc.  I have no doubt that they will soon be knocking it all out of the park (and have a wait list to match).  Was it perfect?  No, but it was close.  We were extremely excited to go, and left happy.  \\n\\nIt's like foodie Epcot Center, NOT the single-plate-that-can-feed-a-small-village \\"cheesecake factory\\"-like business model.  I go there when I want to experience new flavors and textures I won't find anywhere else, and pretend that I'm smart enough to understand everything that Mr. Gilmore is trying to do.  Bring a close friend or three, make a run at the whole menu (four courses or so for each person is usually about right), and then watch the edible floor show unfold in front of you, one bite at a time.  \\n\\nWelcome to the neighborhood, Barley Swine, my new/old friend. 4.6 stars.\\n----------------------------------------------------\\nThis review is dedicated to the one that always left small, but deep, footprints in my heart..."},{"name":"Amrheins","address":"80 W Broadway","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"We were spending the day with my stepson and his girlfriend on a  nostalgic trip around Dorchester and wondered where to have a late lunch.

My company and I decided to get the $32/person 5-meze + 3 spreads deal. Next time we're ordering at least 2 octopus dishes for sure. \\n\\nOverall, the restaurant is very good. The service (impeccable) and the octopus being its stronger suits. The food hit some very high marks and some lower ones too. We liked the zucchini fritters and the desert (we ordered a trio of baklava, galaktobourkeo, and loukouma and all three exceeded our expectations especially since two of them came with a spoon of heavenly ice-cream). I loved the greens (kale) Greek style (EVOO and lemon), but  they had too much lemon for my American bf (see, I like \\"too much\\" lemon, because for Greeks, that is jus \\"enough\\" lemon). They also carried my favorite Greek wine (Sigalas Assyrtiko Athiri), which I wish they had brought the bottle at the table to open and serve (it tasted as if it had been opened for a while, but still good).\\n\\nWhy not 5 stars? First, some of the dishes were oversalted. We were very disappointed with the tuna tartar special, and typically we are big fans of tuna tartare. But the salt (and pepper) over-powered it.  Also, the spicy lamb pie would have been an awesome dish, but again, it was oversalted (and not spicy in any other way). Now if you can taste the salt, they say, the dish is oversalted. We didn't just taste it: We were slapped in the face with it! Last, yes, it was a little overpriced. Not too bad. We had the 3 spreads, the 5 meze plus the greens, 2 drinks, and one desert and our check was 108 +tip.  As for the ambiance, whoever said that it was dated hasn't been to the checkered-tableclothed, Afrodite statute, Santorini picture, Greek flag decorated restaurants across the US.

Hey! What about that \\"raw vegan\\" place in the West End, I've seen lots of people post food from there, let's try it. \\n\\nYou walk into Tassili's and automatically you're not sure what to expect because it's a bit dark inside and not the most appealing aesthetically. There's only a small menu taped to the front counter, so you can't really prepare what to order until it's your turn at the register.  After 5 minutes of anxiety at this unknown menu (you tried to Yelp the menu but, of course, no data) it's finally your turn at the counter. You look at the menu but get confused/overwhelmed by all the options. Finally, the person working register suggests the \\"Punani\\" wrap, and yes - they're all named after nicknamed genitalia. So at this point, you're probably like \\"what da fuck did I just order? Why da fuck am I here?\\" \\n\\nAfter 20 long minutes of waiting with the now empty $7 smoothie you bought from the fridge next to the counter on a whim, your food is ready.

I have once gotten an order in less than 15 minutes!\\n\\nFood:\\nI love Indian food so I was more than happy to find that this place did not disappoint. The Chicken Tikki Masala was so incredibly tender and delicious that I ordered another one. Their garlic nan bread is a must have alongside a Chicken Tikki Masala meal. It is fluffy, savory and pairs perfectly with that excess curry sauce. I have also tried the Chicken Madras and Pork Vindaloo, which were both fantastic in their own right. If you want spicy, they always have the option to make it as spicy or not as spicy as you like it. \\n\\nOverall Rating:\\nThis restaurant earns 5 out of 5 stars (I would rate it higher if I could). This place happens to be my go-to spot for Indian food, with good reason. It is truly the best Indian food in the area. I have eaten many Indian places and yet this one is the one I always crawl back to. I highly recommend this place and make sure you order the garlic nan, it's the perfect pairing for any entr√©e."},{"name":"Wild Chix & Waffles","address":"7714 Burnet Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Gave it a try after reading some good reviews.

The rest was a mess. Management needs to work on their service model and/or hire people who know how to jump in & make things happen. Our poor waitress was struggling & even admitted that it was a mess. She was assigned to 2 completely separate sections, maybe more. I didn't see one lead or manager jump in to help - if anything I saw one other waitress, she might even had been the manager on duty since I saw our waitress run decisions by her, hanging out chatting it up with one table while everything else fell apart. We asked for the TV above us to be changed because it was showing surgeries on animals - nothing anyone wants on while they munch on a burger. Our waitress passed along the request to the head waitress or manager & I heard her say something like hang on because they're changing all the TV's for FIFA Final, which wasn't set to start for 15 minutes!!! So when she came back we asked again & pointed out the issue & she escalated it.  Finally they jumped on it but then all TVs started going to the wrong channels because they have a million remotes & don't know where they're assigned to. It was certainly a night to remember!

It reminds me of the old Ten Pin Alley in Atlantic Station (closed 2011), but better, and Ormsby's, the popular bar with lots of games in Westside.\\n\\nThe Painted Pin is located in an old warehouse on Miami Circle. Its location is non-descript, almost hidden, much like Ormsby's. Miami Circle is a collection of art galleries, antique shops, furniture retailers, and interior design showrooms just off of Piedmont Rd. in Lindbergh. You wouldn't think to find a high-end bowling alley in this part of town and maybe that's just the way the owners like it. Eclipse Di Luna (tapas bar) is tucked away back here too.\\n\\nThere are two signs on Miami Circle that point you towards the driveway to The Painted Pin. The bowling alley's entrance is on the side of the building. Parking is complimentary valet. The entrance is a giant hinged door flanked by gas lanterns. Upon entering the building, it feels very much like a chic and posh nightclub and lounge. The warehouse has been nicely renovated and decorated with billowy curtains, sexy furniture, ornate rugs, and even Greek and Roman statues.\\n\\nThe Painted Pin is only open during the evenings on weekdays and opens at 11:00am on weekends. After 7:30pm, it becomes 21+ and a dress code is enforced. Before 7:30pm, feel free to wear whatever -- T-shirt, shorts, sandals if you want.\\n\\nWhile the focus is bowling, this place offers a whole lot more than that. Other games, which are free, include:\\n\\nSkittles - an old English pub game, similar to bowling - two sets\\nDarts - one board\\nTable tennis - two tables\\nBocce ball - two indoor courts\\nTable shuffleboard - two tables\\nSkee ball - two machines\\nBasketball hoops - four hoops\\n\\nThe two ping-pong tables are located in a tight, but well cooled room. The basketball game is not electronic. You have to keep score yourself.\\n\\nThere are a total of 20 bowling lanes. These 20 lanes are split down the center, 10 on each side of the space, by a beautiful, rectangular-shaped, standalone bar. Behind the bar is an open kitchen with two Naples-style pizza ovens. I haven't tried any of the food or drinks here yet, so I can't comment on any specific dishes or cocktails. However, I've read the chef previously worked at One Midtown Kitchen and Parish and the bar manager previously worked at The Spence and Restaurant Eugene.\\n\\nSeating consists of a variety of comfy couches, chairs, and booths, along with a few high-top tables near the bar. There are several large TV displays, so the venue can double as a sports bar if you want to catch a game.\\n\\nAs for the bowling itself, here are the rates:\\n\\nMonday thru Thursday: $25 per lane per hour\\nFriday thru Sunday: $35 per lane per hour\\nRental bowling shoes: $4.50\\nSocks: $4.00\\n\\nThe cost of the lane can be split among the number of people bowling. Time can be added to lanes in less than one-hour increments. I know they can add time in as little as 15-minute increments.\\n\\nSince the business is new, everything is in great condition from the balls to the equipment to the shoes. The Painted Pin uses QubicaAMF brand bowling shoes for its rental stock. I like these shoes because they are comfortable and have easy/convenient Velcro tops.\\n\\nUnlike your typical bowling alley, the service at The Painted Pin is nicer. Examples: Staff will input bowlers' names into the computer scoring system. Shoes are delivered and picked up from the lane, not at a counter. A server is assigned to your lane(s) and takes/delivers food and drink orders much like a restaurant.\\n\\nI'm not sure why this place is called The Painted Pin, but one of the pins in each rack is painted red.\\n\\nOne complaint I have is there is not enough space between the table and the couches at each lane. It's incredibly tight, uncomfortable, and awkward for people to get up and bowl their turns. The couches are nice though. They are UK-style chesterfield couches, presumably made of leather, with buttons. Old school and classy.\\n\\nOverall, The Painted Pin is a neat place to go, have fun, and hang out with friends. It's great for a group activity and I can see it working out well for private functions like a company party too."},{"name":"FLIP burger boutique","address":"1587 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Oh wow!

But, I enjoyed it.  \\n\\nThey are lacking in prompt, attentive service.  We did have a large group.  The place wasn't that busy.  The food came out in pieces after waiting over an hour.  We had people finished with their meals while others were still waiting for our food.  The waitress didn't clear the table of finished dishes.  Our tables were crowded with excess plates.  With the delay in the food orders, there were no apologies from the hostess or our waitress.  No one will probably return.  We have friends who live in the neighborhood who were excited to share the new restaurant with our group of friends as a regular brunch location, but after the experience, none of us will ever return. \\n\\nThe impression I got was someone opened this restaurant with no idea of how to run a restaurant.  You can't anchor your success on the quality of the food.  Customer service is a huge part of a restaurant's success.  Bad customer service will kill a restaurant.  If a restaurant is still in business in 6 - 8 months, I may try it again to see if there has been any improvement.\\n\\nBreakfast is a pretty quick meal, you shouldn't have to wait over an hour to eat. We arrived at 11AM and left the restaurant around 115PM or 130PM. It's just kind of ridiculous.

The concept of burgers and sushi is a unique combination. I was actually in the mood for both since we were there. My wife wanted both as well but our server (who was training a new employee) was not the most helpful. After coming by three times he finally informed my wife that she could add an extra mini burger to the Bento box which includes a mini burger and a 4 piece sushi roll. If he would have said that the first time it would not have taken so long for her to decide. We are here for the first time and he was training, this was the time to train. The trainee did a better job of explaining the size of the mini-burger as the guy training her. It also took awhile for my wife to get a refill on her Dr. Pepper. I ordered the veggie burger with avocado and bbq on it with an order of the veggie sushi roll which consisted of cucumber, asparagus, and avocado. The sushi was nothing special. I have had better sushi from the grocery store but the veggie burger was outstanding! It was a great texture and together with the bbq knocked it out of the park. Also, the house seasoned fries were some of the best french fries I have ever come across. We were blown away with their taste. One of my wife's mini burgers was brought incomplete as it did not have the bacon or onion fries it was supposed to have on it. Our waiter brought some onion fries but she was over the service at that point. The food was definitely the saver but we will probably not be back as the special rolls are a bit on the pricey side even after living in the DC area for many years. We would go to a 100% sushi restaurant for those prices before returning here.

That's a good thing, because on a Friday evening this place is packed. Nevertheless, our group of maybe 12 or so people was seated within about 10 minutes of arriving. Most of us opted for the Autobahn, which is an all-you-can-eat buffet of sausage, salad (if you swing that way), potato and veggie dishes, and several other types of buffet items (like chicken, etc.). I thoroughly enjoyed my beer with two heaping plates of sauerkraut, red cabbage, sausage, yams, green beans, mac & cheese, and more. Thankfully we walked/waddled back home! Go to Schmidt's with an appetite, that's all I can say.

In fact, the food was so good that mid-way through dinner my wife wanted to shoot the chef to restore equilibrium, just like Johnny Depp in Once Upon a Time in Mexico.  \\n\\nFor those not from the neighborhood, Southland Whiskey Kitchen is brand new and occupies a recently renovated space.  Upon entering we really dug the understated mixture of weathered wood, red brick, and industrial lighting.   Lots of thoughtful details round out the experience, like plenty of coat hooks and the groovy 70s music that floated over the aroma of woodsmoke.  Service was prompt, knowledgeable, and friendly.\\n\\nBefore getting to the food, let me say the drinks menu is damn impressive.  When they called this place a whiskey kitchen, they weren't joking.  The eater is presented with a very extensive list of whiskeys from all over the world, along with a thoughtful assortment of classic cocktails, some with a bourbon twist.   Given that we were having lunch, I opted for a fresh made lemonade that delivered just the right amount of tartness to offset the bbq sauce.\\n\\nThe food, oh, the food.  Let's just say the chef and kitchen staff know how to cook proper barbecue.  The meats were smoky and fork tender, with none of the stringy leather one so often gets.  I'm a brisket man, but the wife ordered a sampler platter from which I stole bites.  Every selection was distinctive and tasty.  The eater is presented with five sauces to accompany the meats, each clearly labelled with a descriptive title (i.e. \\"Spicy\\" or \\"Sweet\\") and a list of ingredients therein.  Too often I'm thrust a container of jars and left to fend for myself with the flavor selection.  Our favorite was the house sauce, though all were interesting in their own right.\\n\\nAccompanying the meat are a selection of traditional sides.  We can vouch for the beans, collards, and slaw.  The beans are pleasantly meaty, while the collards tasty without any of the bitterness that can sometimes linger.  The slaw was pretty decent as well, though it lacked the horseradish kick promised on the menu.  With 7 or 8 additional sides on the menu, it's not hard to say there's something for everyone.\\n\\nI did leave with one criticism, though to be honest it's more a matter of personal preference than poor cooking.  Whiskey Kitchen's cornbread is respectable, but a little bland and on the overly sweet side for my taste.  It also lacked a coarse cornmeal texture.   As my Oklahoma grandmother used to say, keep that northerly corncake away from my plate!!!  All of that said, I ate the cornbread because of the mind-blowing honey-butter whose floral aromatics and distinctive sweetness left me in a puddle.

However, in this case, there is a very compelling reason why I am writing this review: its because I feel that is my duty to warn all potential customers of this shop of something so very WRONG about the shop that they MUST know this fact in advance.\\n\\nSo, exactly what is this big bad fact? Here goes, and it is a BIGGIE:\\nThis Blue Star donuts DOES NOT CARRY ANY JELLY DONUTS! NONE! NONE AT ALL! \\n\\nLet me repeat that, because it is so important, and yet impossible to believe: \\nThis donut shop (along with all other Blue Star donut shops) DOES NOT CARRY ANY JELLY DONUTS! NONE! NONE AT ALL! \\n\\nLet me tell you how I wasted a half-hour of my life in discovering this horrid fact: During a recent stay in Portland, I mentioned to some locals last week that I was craving a jelly donut, and was planning to walk to Voodoo Donuts to buy one. \\n\\nThese locals acted horrified, and told me sternly that Voodoo donuts are \\"cheap donuts\\" and that if I wanted only the best donuts, I should only go to Blue Star for donuts, because, they told me, Blue Star uses only all-organic/sustainable ingredients, all of their staffers are highly spiritual, all of their staffers are virgins, and further, all female staffers are Vestal Virgins! These traits, they assured me, were highly desirable for donut makers. \\n\\nI asked them if they were sure that Blue Star offers jelly donuts, and they told me scornfully that this was a VERY stupid question, because ANY RED-BLOODED AMERICAN knows that ALL donut shops are required -- by Divine law, by cosmic law, by federal law, and by the holy books of every major religion (except, curiously, for the holy book of Zoroastrianism, and that of the Urantians) -- to carry jelly donuts, because jelly donuts are one of the five most sacred and necessary foods in the universe.\\n\\nSo, one morning I went on a very very long walk from my hotel to this Blue Star donut shop. When I arrived at the shop, I went inside, and tried to order a jelly donut. The store clerk, who had been torturing small donuts with a propane torch, looked up at me and told me that Blue Star does not carry jelly donuts, because, he told me loftily, jelly donuts are the food of commoners. He further advised me, again with a superior lofty attitude, that Blue Star offers only very expensive ELITE donuts, usually donuts that look very artsy, and that are so PRETTY that customers will be compelled to share photos of the donuts on social media. \\n\\nHe further told me smarmily that most of their donuts have ears (bunny wabbit ears) or faces, or both, or bear other cute designs on them. He told me that their donuts are decorated donuts, works of art, and that artsy photos of these donuts are widely featured on the social media accounts of social media \\"influencers\\" from around the world! \\n\\nAs a courtesy, I bought a garish artsy donut with sprinkles and left the shop dejectedly, crushed and totally depressed. Disgusted, I tossed the donut in the first trash bin that I passed, for I couldn't bear to take even one bite of it -- it was fake all the way through. \\n\\nThe next day, after numerous sessions of psychotherapy and energy healing had healed most of the pain of my earlier horrid encounter with Blue Star, I asked one of my concierges to please run over to the nearest Voodoo Donut shop and purchase two REAL jelly donuts for me. He did so in short order, and those Voodoo jelly donuts turned out to be PERFECT! SCRUMPTIOUS!   \\n\\nNow, I rarely use terms such as \\"evil\\" or \\"perverted\\", because those words seem to be primarily the province of scary hateful religious fundamentalists, but in this case, for perhaps the first time in my life, I am compelled to state that Blue Star donuts, in their refusal to offer jelly donuts, is EVIL AND PERVERSE. \\n\\nIn fact, I am quite sure that one day very soon, God, sitting up in heaven, will tire of her daily routine of watching Latino telenovelas on South American TV channels, and will look down upon earth, and will notice, to her great horror, that Blue Star does not offer jelly donuts. She will then either send down massive bolts of lightning to obliterate all traces of Blue Star shops, or alternatively, she will dispatch a team of teenage radioactive mutant opossum stormtroopers to storm each store and shut it down forever. I can also say that anyone and everyone connected with Blue Star management who had anything to do with the decision NOT to offer jelly donuts will, when they die, be condemned to a fiery HELL for 10 billion years!\\n\\nIn Closing\\nSomewhere in a fiery pit in the deepest depths of HELL, Satan is cackling with delight because of the fact that Blue Star Donuts does not sell jelly donuts."},{"name":"Parish Cafe and Bar","address":"361 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"The d-bar is one of the best sandwiches I've ever had, but the bread pudding is lacking."},{"name":"FLIP burger boutique","address":"1587 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I am going to make this short and to the point, as you have a ton of other reviews to scour of this place that may be less accurate...\\n\\nSimply put, the burgers live up to the hype.

There were plenty of tables open and it was not busy at all. The atmosphere is amazing, and if this review was just based off of the atmosphere then it would have been 5 stars. It is an open restaurant and the breeze felt great. For the food, i tried the chicken taco, 2 fish tacos, 2 shrimp banh mi tacos, the portabello mushroom taco, and the secret taco which was the short rib taco. My friends and i also decided to split the guacamole and salsa. The guac and salsa tasted good, and it was $3 per person for 3 people. My favorite taco would have been the fish tacos, as the fish was crispy and overall very tasty for $2.50 each. The shrimp bahn mi taco for $3.50 also tasted pretty good. It had a nice sauce with carrots and onions. The chicken taco underwhelmed me, as it was only a chicken with sauce and nothing else. The special short rib taco for $3.50 was also tasty as the meat was tender and seasoned very well. The portabello taco was good as the mushrooms were cooked well and had a nice smokey flavor. The reason this place is 3 stars is because the service was extremely slow. It took 25 minutes or so to get 3 tacos that were eaten in  about 2 minutes. Then when you want to order more tacos because you realize how small they are you end up waiting 20 more minutes. Then when we ask for the check it takes around 10 minutes for the server to come by. I will assume that the service will not be this slow all the time, and that this is not a 3 star restaurant. If the service was faster, i would have given it 4 stars as the food was good, and the atmosphere was great. Personally, i feel like this place is a little too expensive. For a normal human, you can expect to eat around 5 tacos per person along with chips and salsa and a drink. You can expect that to be around $20 plus per person. As a college student, my heart skipped a beat when i saw the check and it was $36 just for me."},{"name":"Gourdough's Public House","address":"2700 S Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"LAAAAWWWWDDDDDD!

Not too much--just perfectly balanced lavender flavor. \\n\\nDespite the fact that we were stuffed, there was no way I was leaving without one of those waffles. Correct decision, turns out. The waffle was SO good. The perfect balance of light and dense and chewy and crystallized bits of crunchy sugar. The passion fruit sauce we ordered with it was sweet and tart and perfect.

Not a terribly big fan of sausage, I glazed over the list of sausage platters and focused on the German Traditional Dinners and Sandwich lists. (There was also a buffet, and I noticed a good percentage of the customers choosing that option instead.) I had initially wanted to order the Chicken Griller sandwich but decided that  it would defeat the purpose of checking out Schmidt's. So instead I went with the Bavarian Cabbage Rolls and the Potato Pancakes and Green Beans as my two sides. DanDan had originally ordered the Sausage Sampler. What did he get instead? A second plate of Bavarian Cabbage Rolls with Potato Pancakes and Green Beans as his two sides.\\n\\nSo... not only was the waitress annoying as heck, she misheard DanDan's saying \\"sampler\\" for \\"same\\" (or something along that line.) The dish itself was decent but not too terribly exciting. Imagine spaghetti meat sauce mixed in with rice and then wrapped with overly cooked cabbage and then topped with another layer of tomato sauce. The green beans were a bit on the salty side. The highlight of my dish, however, was the potato pancakes; they were good enough the way they were served, ie sans applesauce.\\n\\nI knew I'd be having/splitting a cream puff as soon as I stepped inside Schmidt's so I made sure I left ample room for dessert. Boy, was I glad I did. I ended up splitting the peanut butter and fudge cream puff with DanDan. I inhaled it within minutes of arriving at the table.\\n\\nSchmidt's provides a very different, yet cozy atmosphere. One of the three stars goes for its--literally--ambient atmosphere. Not so much the poor service. The second of the three stars goes towards its cream puff, which made up for the unsavory cabbage rolls. The third star?

The decor was very modern and made it seem incredibly upscale - everyone remarked how it felt like one of those places you go to \\"be seen.\\" Unfortunately, we were missing one person in our party, so we couldn't be seated at all until they arrived. Larger groups were seated before us even though they showed up well after we did, and one wound up taking our table. I'm somewhat used to being told to wait for the entire group, but it seemed ridiculous to give away our table then scramble to get another one ready when our final person appeared.\\n\\nAll the \\"drama\\" aside, we settled into an odd-looking booth for our dinner. I'd observed people getting burgers that were three times the size of my mouth, so I opted for the turkey burger with no bun (I'm not a fan of a sandwich that is over 50% bread). The turkey burger was all right but nothing special. The french fries were delicious, though, as was the beet salad. The mayo for the fries has liquid smoke mixed in which was a nice touch for flavor. I don't eat sweet potatoes, but I was told the sweet potato tots are not good at all. The taste just isn't right - it's worth trying them for yourself, but it sounds like you shouldn't expect too much.\\n\\nMy boyfriend picked up the Krispy-Kreme milkshake and seemed to enjoy it. I didn't try it so I can't personally vouch for it, but the sight of ground up doughnuts and ice cream was a bit much for me. The toasted marshmallow milkshake went over well with two other friends in the group, so overall if you're a milkshake lover, you'll enjoy the shakes here.\\n\\nThey do serve funky bottle sodas (I believe they are all organic or old school sodas) which was fun and felt like a diner, but then you see the crisp white lines and plush sofas and realize this isn't your 60s carhop-style diner. :)\\n\\nService was good, ambiance was nice, and the food was okay.

I feel turkey is not praised a lot but it's a delicious cut of meat.  They probably season it with the same rub as the brisket.

I am a 100% breed, born and raised Texan and I know my BBQ !!! I judge all of my food on six levels. Nasty, Alright, Good, Delicious, Slap Yo Momma Good and the \\"Very Rare\\" Slap Yo Momma Twice. I do use different versions with words such as very, pretty, somewhat, etc. to bring it up or down to the next level. In my professional opinion it is very hard to find better BBQ in Texas than Black's. I have eaten a lot of BBQ in my lifetime and as a first timer, I must say that I was very very very impressed. I would say that they are certainly within the top five for Texas BBQ. We had brought in a ton of food today from Blacks for a luncheon meeting at our office. Since this was my first time having Black's I went for an all meat plate. I had their most and their lean brisket, their turkey and their sausage. The moist brisket and the sausage where Slap Yo Momma Good. The moist brisket was juicy, tender and it melts in your mouth. The sausage has an excellent balance of spices with a hint of black pepper to cause your taste buds to shout Hallelujah !!! The turkey was good, but a little dry, and the lean brisket was alright, but it too was dry. We had green beans, mac n cheese, beans and potatoes but I didn't try any of those. For desert there was peach cobbler (didn't try) and banana pudding which made it to the \\"very rare\\" Slap Yo Momma Twice category !!! Finally, as I said I've eaten a lot of BBQ in Texas and Black's is a million times better than The Salt Lick (all locations) and also Louie Muller's in Taylor which cost me $75 for two people to eat and it was totally nasty. Black's is definitely worthy of a bookmark and a try if you you're just passing through or you live near-by.

Tea smoked spare ribs - Gamy, gamy, gamy!  Tasted like it was not properly marinaded or prepared.  It's not just about falling off the bone.  That's an American concept.  It's also about falling oof the bone with tenderness and perfectly cook, not overly cooked to make it looks like it was leftover cooked multiple times til the bone falls part!  Even the Americanized Chinese spare ribs is better.  \\n4. Hakka Eggplant - This was the only dish that was okay.  Even this, you can do better elsewhere.  They made the eggplant a bit too mushy.\\n5.  Tiger's Tears - This is a joke.  The beef just didn't come together.\\n6.

We had almost every taco, 1/2 of the non-tacos, almost all the sides, will try the rice bowls next time.  The only thing we didn't care for was the corn.  Even thought it was fresh corn, something about the underlying taste didn't appeal to any of us.  I will say that when the server heard us debating how to share \\"a corn\\" - she said, \\"Oh, we can take it off the cob and put it in a bowl.\\"  They did that, and we could all share the one order.\\n\\nAlways enjoyed the way their other restaurant, Barcelona, is run and its food.  So glad they are taking another shot at Atlanta with Bartaco.  We thought that the prices were very reasonable.  Four of us, drinks, and enough food to feed 6 came out to $130 with tax, not tip."},{"name":"Panera Bread","address":"11563 NE Glenn Widing Dr","city":"Portland","stars":"2.5","text":"The bread seems like it's changed.

It's not your traditional white tablecloth fine dining.  There will be no fleet of waiters changing your silverware for each course, no 3 foot long pepper grinder brought to your table, no amuse bouche or palate cleansers.  It's also not a steakhouse.  There are no giant hunks of meat with a wedge salad and baked potato to sink your teeth into.  Finally, despite what the owner says, it's not really a bar.  You're not going to find burgers and fries, or fried chicken, or pool tables.  Also, you won't find any fancy cocktails, since it's beer and wine only.\\n\\nWhat you will find is a tiny little place with as many people packed in as it can hold, some indie music playing, and friendly servers who will make you feel welcome.  You'll find a selection of interesting beers and wines, many local or from small makers.  And you'll find some of the most amazing food I've ever had.  Bryce Gilmore is a genius at combining ingredients you'd never think of putting together and coming up with flavors you've never imagined before.  Not everything works brilliantly every time, but everything we had worked at least very well, and the best dishes were shockingly, stunningly good.  My wife and I took turns sampling the dishes, and then watching with a grin to see the other's reaction to the flavors that had just blown us away.  \\n\\nMy advice:  If something on the menu looks crazy to you, try it.  You'll be amazed at how good crazy tastes.  Or ask the servers what's good.  They know all the dishes, and they're delighted to recommend their favorites.

After 10 minutes, still no dinner for our daughter and we've been letting our dinner go cold so we could wait for her. I had to flag down the server to get an update and he mumbled that it would be soon and speed off. At that point, I went up to the hostess (and maybe manager) and explained what was going on and she did absolutely nothing. The food finally came out 15 minutes after ours--hers was scalding hot while ours was freezing cold (and cold gyro meat is not that great).

They said they don't seat anyone outside at the moment, but they can seat me right next to the window. So I agreed. \\n\\nUnfortunately, there were only three tables right next to the window. The first table had a couple who was just about to leave when I came in, ( meaning the table isn't ready, or clean ), the middle table (where I was shown) and the next table, (tables, grouped together to accommodate a company lunch). My seat was right next to the work-lunchers. One of them was having a presentation at the moment and it was loud enough that I didn't want to hear how their company is growing  and thriving. \\nI of course, asked to change my seat. \\n\\nAnyway, had the ceviche, which was a waste. They use salmon or some other reddish fish, with tomatoes and cilantro. So, imagine a sort of pico de gallo, with raw fish that is too thick to be in a ceviche, with a lot less citrus. Fortunately, I ordered it off of the happy hour menu. \\n\\nAlso ordered the roast chicken adobo. That one was on point. Nicely roasted on the outside but still very nice and not dry on the inside. \\n\\nHad two drinks. The regular margarita, which hit the spot.

The drink was swimming with whatever hard liquor on the top, and it was very light on the juice on the bottom. It was so terrible, I had to politely ask if I could just have another Margarita instead because after one sip of the Paloma, I just cannot drink anymore of it. \\n\\nFortunately, the waiter, (the one who threw the empty box over his shoulder while he was folding napkins on to the floor) was gracious enough to not take it personally, and just made me another Margarita. \\n\\nBy the way, the restaurant was about empty of customers except for me and another table (3 people).

The char they put on it is just right, but I think that's just because the bread is so good it's taking on the char so well. They cook is so perfectly in the oven. It has a solid crusty outside, with a pillow of deliciousness at the edge and it's pulled even throughout the bottom for a perfect bed for sauce and toppings.\\n\\n2. Toppings. I had the White Anchovie pizza which came with basil, olives, capers, and tomato sauce. All of the ingredients were super fresh and all of the flavors came out. I think the way they cook it is amazing. And regular anchovies are the bomb on pizza, but white anchovies are blow your mind (I'm drooling as I'm writing this, and I just devoured the entire pie by myself, not recommended, but may be necessary). The white anchovies are just the start, because if you love olives and capers well just bring all of your paychecks to A4 to deposit into their pizza bank because I wish I could eat this everyday!\\n\\nDo not hesitate, just eat here.

NOTHING in this world I love more than cheeseburgers. Besides my daughter. And my mom. And the other people I'm related to. And being gainfully employed, I wouldn't quit for a cheeseburger. And the guy I married. But other than just those things, I love NOTHING more than cheeseburgers. \\n\\nSo, Hopdoddy won my vote. I've heard people give it a mediocre nod here around my office, mostly based on the physical layout: You stand in line, cafeteria-style, order your burger at the register, and you can either order a drink there, or at the bar after you loop baaaaaack around to the diningroom. I will admit that the negatives of the restaurant are the layout, the being herded through the ropes to like a cow just to get up front and ask to please eat some cow is a bit ironic, and the oddness of paying for your food in one place, then opening a tab in another place to get your damn beer. And you must have beer with your burger. You must. \\n\\nI had a classic cheeseburger the first time, a jalepeno burger the second. They were both delicious, cooked perfeclty medium-well but without losing any greasy drippy yummy moistness, and delivered in a timely manner. You supply yourself with utensils and condiments from the cattle chute area after ordering. The experience will be what you make it. Propped up in their high booths, swinging your feet like a kid with ketchup dribbling down your chin, or you can opt for a regular table or a picnic table outside. The feel is extremely casual, perhaps not as comfortable as some, but a nice vibe altogether. And whatever it is lacking in atmosphere, it makes up in food quality.

The seats were spread out enough so we can enjoy our conversation, but not be completely ignored either. The bread that they serve you first is absolutely delicious! Make sure you ask for more!! This isn't that cheap Italian bread you can buy at market basket. This is fresh baked bread. The slices are a little bit small though but ask for more! We got the fried calamari to start and this was delicious. Perfectly cooked where it wasn't soggy or overdone. My boyfriend couldn't stop raving about it. My entree was one of the specials which was Pasta with porcini mushrooms with a light cream sauce drizzled with truffle oil. YUM! I could really taste the truffle oil which made it amazing! My boyfriend got Chicken stuffed with ham and mozzarella cheese with a some type of wine sauce. He thought it was a bit plain and didn't really like wine so that was his own fault ( he thought so too haha) For dessert we got a chocolate creme brulee. It was good but not my favorite because it tasted like fancy chocolate pudding. My boyfriend devoured it! It was still good just different than what I expect! Also the prices weren't horrible either because for 2 entree, and appetizer, and a dessert with a cup of milk came out to be $60 before tip. We got a restaurant.com coupon for $25 so it came out to be $35 before tip.\\n\\nOverall: Would deffinately go back again!\\n\\nNote: The service was a tad bit slow even on a Wednesday night where it wasn't busy.

What is this fucker-y that Buckhead business deem an unacceptable accessory, not to mention it's winter, so people wear hats!!! As a female, bc I can't speak for males, if we are wearing a hat, one of two things is happening ..... 1) the hat is a part of my ensemble.

We get to the third incorrect lane, and by this time, the pregnant lady is about to lose it, and I have acquired quite the attitude from the lack of competence in the workers here. No one knows what's going on, nor why they can't get our line correct. They finally just tell us to stay where we are, and that they'll just change the names on the screen so that we may stay where we are. \\n\\nThe bathroom. Ladies beware ....

There is plenty of swanky seating for you to sit and sip while you wait on a lane. There are little games, that I was unfamiliar with, to the side for you to play as well while you wait. There are plenty of televisions for your viewing pleasure if you want to still catch that game that you thought you'd be missing bc you don't want to tell your out of town friends that you MUST see the Iron Bowl and Alabama whoop some azz!!! (they're from NY, so they don't understand) I LOVED the atmosphere here. It's like a plush, grown up, not family friendly, way to bowl. I don't have to worry about kids running around everywhere. It really reminded me of Ormsby's on the Westside. My friends that don't really care to bowl would still like to hang out here for drinks. There was a live rock band performing the night that I went which was really awesome! I hate going back to places with horrible customer service, and the only reason I may go back is bc of the atmosphere of this bowling alley.

While I try to be brave in eating new things, I'm not a fan of lamb and I wasn't brave enough to try the goat, so I went with the chicken tikki masala.  I ordered it medium spicy, which can be dangerous in an Indian place, as their \\"medium\\" might not be what I call medium, but it worked for me.  Hot, spicy, but not overwhelmingly so.  It was very good, chicken was cooked perfectly, sauce was tasty and very flavorful.  it came with a side of rice, which was well prepared and had a nice flavor to it, and tempered some of the spiciness of the sauce.\\n\\nMy veggie friend was impressed with the menu selection, she picked the spinach and liked it very much.  We also ordered the onion nan, which was fresh out of the oven and quite Delicious.  You could go there and just get the nan and an appetizer and go home fed, as the portions are pretty generous.  The appetizers looked very good, actually, although I'm glad I didn't order one, as the dinner portions were so large that I had to ask for the doggie bag.  I always think it's a bit unmanly to ask for the doggie bag, but there it is.  \\n\\nI didn't have a drink there, but they do serve beer and wine.  The decor is very nice, spotlessly clean, and sort of modern, but with a few Indian touches, including the music videos which were, oddly, playing on a TV in the corner.  The place was maybe half full while I was there, but service was fast and very friendly, waiters were very happy to answer questions about the menu.\\n\\nOverall, a good place, I would go back there in a second.  \\n\\nSo go check out Allston Village.

It's cozy inside and dog friendly outside. The staff is very friendly and easy going.Their club sandwich is massive,  and extremely delicious. The hot chocolate is smooth and delicious. Plus, they make a pretty mean breakfast taco, which is a morning necessity in my book. \\n\\nCons: Aside from the hot chocolate, I haven't had many good drinks here. My chai tea was heavily watered down and lacking in flavor and my mocha latte didn't have much of a chocolate flavor. Food wise, there are lots of tasty choices, but a burger is not one of them. My boyfriend and I both got burgers and they tasted sweet rather than savoury. The meat was mushy and I pretty much lost my appetite a few bites in. \\n\\nOverall, I would recommend Cherrywood if you are looking for a dog friendly place to relax with some coffee or a snack."},{"name":"Brown Bag Deli","address":"898 Mohawk St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"I was searching for a good place to enjoy a sandwich.

The combination of good food, a reasonable BYOB policy, and a laid-back atmosphere make it a great place for dinner.\\n\\nFirst things first:  bring your wine with you.  It's a measly $3 per person corkage fee, which is a very small and reasonable price to pay to enjoy your choice of bottle and avoid the usual restaurant markup.  Phara's provides glasses and bottle openers (I think they are legally prohibited from opening it for you), and will recycle the empties.  If you get there and realize you've forgotten the grape, there's a convenience store just down the street with a convenience-store-like selection (though I hear there's a wine boutique in the works across the street - stay tuned).\\n\\nParking is not bad - there's a single row of spaces in front of both sides of the street on this commercial strip, and I don't believe any spots are reserved for a particular business.  If you can't find a open spot, there's street parking on Avenue F just around the corner.\\n\\nThe indoor dining area is small - there can't be more than around 10 tables, if that.  So if you're going on a night when outdoor seating is not an option, I would definitely make reservations.  The patio is bigger and offers a nice al fresco experience, weather permitting.\\n\\nThe food:  I like the hummus - it's nice and thick, well-seasoned but not overdone, and comes with olives.  The pita is fresh and they will keep it coming if you run out. The \\"la zeez\\" dishes (choice of beef, lamb, or chicken) are spicy and delicious.  Of the various sides I think the tzatziki and basmati rice are excellent.  And although the prices for the meat dishes may seem a little high ($16-$18), it's a great value because you get a heaping plate of food.  You'll likely be doggy-bagging some of it.  There's also a handul of vegetarian dishes.  I'm usually too full for dessert, but the baklava is the best of the small selection.    \\n\\nI've always had great, attentive service here.  Phara herself is often around has always been very welcoming and gracious.  \\n\\nThere's belly dancing Thursday through Sunday, if that's your thing.  On the other nights there's usually some low-key live music."},{"name":"Locke-Ober","address":"3 Winter Pl","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"If you're not from the area, or even if you are, and you're at all interested in Boston's history, this is a great place to go.  If you are also a decorative painter that specializes in finishes, this is a phenomenal place to go.  If you're all of these things and you really really like rich foods (like livers and foie gras and pate and truffley things), you will think you have died and gone to heaven.\\nA maze-like warren of at least four floors of small and large rooms off of narrow hallways and sitting areas, you can only guess that this was a standard restaurant/gentleman's club with sleeping rooms for let upstairs, which have now been turned into private dining spaces.  Even the room where JFK supposedly proposed to Jackie, although the Omni Parker House also asserts to have been that happy location.  Whatev, the history of this place is still amazing.  There is no room 13, only rooms, 12, B, 14.  Ah the superstitious - my hotel also has no floor 13.  Just 12 and 14.  In 1894 another company had purchased both Locke's and Ober's and took down a wall, linking the two spaces and creating the Winter Place Tavern (just a little history lesson for our bartender/server - who had no idea why some of the plates had a shield with \\"Locke-Ober\\" on them, while others featured the same shield with the words \\"Winter Place.\\"  I think a little history lesson should be a requirement to work here - I know I'm not the only one curious about this place's past.)  I just love that once upon a time at least part of the space was Boys Only, and now it's run by a female chef.  Ha, take that Victorians!\\nSeriously, I cannot even tell you how in love I was with the finishes on the walls here, and that would probably only serve to bore you but this is my review so sit tight.  The paintings on the ceiling, the raised plaster fleur de lis on the walls, the metallic paints, the gold leafed walls, the lacquered ceilings, the hand painted tromp l'oeil tables, the thin wood veneer panels with scrolly designs (I do believe that's the technical term, yes) - man I was so in love with this place.\\nOn to something you might actually care about - the food.  I think in retrospect we were treating this place far more casually than it's used to.  This is one of those places where waiters hang on your every movement ready to sweep in and adjust, replace, refill, whatever you may need.  And we wanted to sit and order food around a lounge table like we were in a pub.  No wonder they were spazzed out by our orders of apps and soup and salad only.  \\nWe split an endive salad with crisp, thin pear slices and walnuts; scallops (some bacon wrapped!) served with a little sweet potato pie; duck confit with gnocchi (apple perhaps, I can't remember - there were a few glasses of wine before dinner. . . . ); and someone also got the lobser bisque which came out thinner than one may be used to, but filled with big pieces of lobster meat.  Rich rich rich food, very tasty.  That duck didn't stand a chance, let me tell you.  It was phenomenal.  The dishes were gorgeous and lived up to their reputations.\\nAll in all, as long as you're not trying to break any rules, operate outside the norms, or watch your waist line or budget, dining here is a fantastic experience; one I would highly recommend on a trip to Boston.  I'm just knocking off a star since I don't think \\"No\\" or \\"We don't allow that\\" should ever come out of your mouth while you work here, especially when folks are paying what they are."},{"name":"Punjab Palace","address":"109 Brighton Ave","city":"Allston","stars":"4","text":"\\"Desi Indian\\" food that is nothing to write home about.

My husband was feeling burger-ish, so it seemed a great time to right a wrong and scratch an itch all at the same time. We were there for lunch, so I can't rate the beer. First things first, the service was S-L-O-W. It should not take 30 minutes for a burger and a sandwich.  From my corner of the room, it looked like one server was covering the whole place. When I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich, I asked the server which were better, the tots or the fries. On his recommendation, I ordered the fries. He was right that they were better; I got to try both since he delivered the sandwich with tots instead. The sandwich had all the makings of something yummy:  grilled chicken breast, beautiful smoked bacon, arugula, garlic mayo, avocado, lettuce, tomato, and onion on grilled ciabatta. Sadly, the chicken was painfully over-cooked to the point that it was very dry and chewy. The rest of the condiments could not overcome the shoe leather consistency of the chicken, although it looked fabulous. The spouse enjoyed his burger very much and was pleased that it was actually cooked well-done as ordered. The nibble of the patty I tried tasted like high-quality, fresh beef. Both meals suffered from meat-to-bread ratios that were way off.  It's not that they needed more meat. They were ample servings, it's just that they were overwhelmed by the cocoon of bread. I left 2/3 of the bun on my plate.

I decided if I was in Austin, I would definitely have to try it. I came on a Thursday around 8 p.m. There was a line that curled around the door. I thought this was a bit strange at first, but didn't really mind the 8 or so minute wait. It was hot but there were fans close the front entrance + interesting characters that would walk past the rest. \\n\\nOnce in, the process, I felt was cattle like. I really didn't know what was going on...I was pushed to move forward from line to line. Wanted to try a local Austin beer + got a sample. Really didn't seem like this bartender wanted me try a sample... she gave me one anyways. I felt so rushed, I simply said yes. I gave her my debit card + another worker told me to move forward. I was so confused...  I told her the bartender still had my card. She said she would give it to me. With people anxious and filed with aggravation behind me, I trudged on. I couldn't help but continuously look back waiting for my card + kind of freaking out?!! She walked out from the bar + gave me my receipt. I still don't understand this process... + with this many people this procedure seems un-safe.\\n\\nIn this second line I ordered food. I admit both lines were quite long. 7 minutes in the first line and probably 10 in the second line. It was hot as hell... dinner time + this second and last line was stationed close to the cooks grills. I started feeling aggravated (the heat from the stoves) + even impatient. Starving and having to wait for the host to give me a table number, then telling the order taker my order. With out the table # by order wouldn't even be taken!\\n\\nOrdered the turkey burger. Came out after 12-15 minutes. It wasn't the best burger. Had little dressing. It tasted like chicken. But it is what it is. It was a good size but I've tasted a better turkey burger else where. Burger was cold as well as the fries.\\n\\n--\\n\\nI went to Hop Doddy a few days after my first visit to give this place another try. I figured the beer I had probably off set some of the flavor. This time I came on a Sunday. There was another line. It was 2 p.m. + I guess this place is just that popular? I really don't know?!! This line was about 3 minutes.\\n\\nSaw the two lines again + immediately sped up to the food line. Out of no where someone is excusing us + telling us that we need to get to the back of the line. I keep telling this foreign dude we were already in the line + we are here now. He keeps saying that we are in the wrong line. I said no, this is the food line + that is the beer line, we aren't getting beer, just food. The hostess who recognized walks over. I tell her what's going on + say we are here for food + not beer. She apologizes + says we have to stand in BOTH lines even if we didn't want beer. I apologized to the guest + the hostess + said I didn't know. She apologized for not explaining.\\n\\nFelt like an idiot + got back in line!!! Felt like the hostess should of educated me, us.. all guests!! Finally got to the food line, heard the Ahi Tuna Burger was good. Ordered that...got it...  was not good. Not a fan of wasabi + still didn't like the wasabi flavoring but dealt with it. The Tuna chunk is a great slice but the burger just not very satisfying. Didn't like the cold bun or cold burger feel. I did also try the bison burger + it was good. Nice + warm. Total was $28 and thought that price was pretty RENDONKOLOUS for two burgers and a small fry!!!!\\n\\nI've tried this place twice + wont come for a third.... just can't be a fan. Hate the cattle process with a passion.... 3 lines of waiting.... service with zero smiles... hot in the restaurant + food that isn't appetizing .. or maybe just don't try the ahi tuna or the continental turkey?!!"},{"name":"CafeNineteen","address":"265 18th St Nw","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"4 stars for the berry tart ($6 per slice)\\n3.5 stars for the limoncello raspberry cake ($6 per slice) because it was a bit dry although delicious.\\n5 stars for the velvet ice ($4, comparable to Starbucks Frappuccino, but I prefer the CafeNineteen velvet ice because you can add flavors such as caramel, mocha, vanilla, hazelnut, etc.) \\n5 stars for the macchiato caramello ($5) which is sweeter than the Starbucks version. \\n3 stars for the cappuccino because it was too bitter. \\n\\nThe atmosphere is very cool and European.

I consulted Yelp to find restaurants in the Woburn area and happened upon Pintxo Pincho Tapas Bar.

We were greeted by Pepe, who we learned later, was one of the owners. What can I say, we put ourselves in his hands and we were not disappointed......from the full bodied but slightly fruity red wine he recommended to the succulent lamb chops, paella and Croquetas de Bacalao that we had.

I choose spicy for tika, and I was literally crying but it was so delicious! They send it in a plastic container with a ton of sauce. Rice came in Chinese take out box which was nothing special and not bad either. The samosas are gigantic but they were pretty cold which was disappointing but the filling was very generous. I felt adventurous and tried the onion naan which was perfect. Perfect smell of being cooked on fire or some kind of wooden oven. One side of the ma'am was burned a bit but the other half was enough to satisfy my craving for a good naan. And lastly, the rice pudding (khreer) did not disappoint. I was surprised that it is liquid as something similar in Turkish is pretty solid and it didn't have as much dried fruits as I wished it did. However, I liked the taste and would get it again.

I chipped my tooth biting into one, and the response was \\"yeah everyone has been complaining about this today\\"... which is probably a good sign to stop serving them as a topping. On one occasion my husband ordered a slice of cake. There were multiple pieces in the to-go fridge but the employee did not allow him to take his slice from the fridge. After waiting almost an hour for a piece he asked to just be refunded for the cake, at which point the employee grabbed a slice from the fridge and gave it to him. My order is usually always wrong in some capacity. And most recently, I visited last night and ordered the Ahi Tuna salad. It didn't look quite right or smell normal. The tuna was an odd color, the cucumbers looked days old and the carrots were soaking wet. I mentioned it to a server and he said it was normal. After a few bites I stopped eating it and waste my $14 salad. Well unfortunately I was sick soon after eating just a few bites.

I don't write many Yelp reviews. It takes a lot to motivate me to spend the time on it, but this place merits a few moments. \\n\\nThe pizza is outstanding. Exactly what pizza should be. Thin crust - a bit of crispness on the outside and the perfect amount of chewiness on the inside. I normally don't eat all of the crust but here I do. The sauce is delicious. Just altogether perfect. \\n\\nThe atmosphere is charming to me in that it seems like a throwback to another era. Red and white checkered table cloths, cement floors, football playing on the tv. No frills just great food. \\n\\nIt's a great family place. I don't feel stressed bringing my three kids (four and under) here because it's so laid back and they even give the kids some pizza dough to play with while we're waiting for the food (i.e., free babysitting).

Definitely deserves to be up there with the best!\\n\\nAnd a quick note to the owner/management, something seems to be off with your fountain soda machine. I've gotten the Maine Root Beer three times now and each time the taste is off. First, it tasted like carbonation and nothing else. The employees agreed it was not right that day. The next two times, it was just too sweet. I have this same drink fairly often at Torchy's Taco and it's tastes normal there - just like the bottled drink. Anyways just thought I'd mention it.

So I split the fauxlofal burger and the lamb burger with my sister. The fauxlofal burger was amazing!  I actually couldn't get enough of it!  The chickpeas, vegetables,and tzatziki sauce are a great combo.  I would recommend this to anyone, vegetarian or not!  Trust me, you won't be disappointed with the flavors of the fauxlofal burger.\\n\\nOne of the main reasons I ordered the lamb burger was because it came with citrus goat cheese, and i was intrigued.

The first was a four-star experience, but the second was only worthy of one star. \\n\\nAlthough the restaurant is in a strip mail with a Jack in the Box, my husband chose the restaurant for our first wedding anniversary based on the positive reviews on Yelp. We were pleasantly surprised by the good food and good service. It was a little expensive but we thought it was worth it for a special occasion.\\n\\nHe decided to take me again for Valentine's Day. Our experience was much different this time around. Being pregnant, I get a bit bummed sometimes when we go out to eat because I can't have a cocktail or glass of wine with my meal. Being six-and-a-half months' pregnant, I thought the waiter would have noticed my condition. But I can't blame him for not figuring that out. Most people don't want to guess that someone is pregnant when she is not.\\n\\nAnyway, our waiter, Michael, got my husband's drink order (a beer) but seemed to have very little patience with me because I was not ordering wine. (I get it, the more we spend, the better tip he gets.) I asked if they had anything else, and he told me they had iced tea, soft drinks, and that's it. I tried to ask if he had anything without caffeine, and he cut me off. I got water. \\n\\nAdmittedly, I was a little sensitive because of my hormones, but I did believe he was a bit rude, especially for such a special occasion. When my husband left the table, I took the opportunity to tell Michael directly that he was a bit too abrupt with me and could we please try to take my drink order again. He said he was sorry. I asked if he had Sprite; he said they did; I ordered one. I guess he didn't know Sprite was caffeine-free. Was that so hard? He apologized again to my husband when he came back to the table, but I am not sure if it was sincerity or the fear of getting a bad tip that made him do it.\\n\\nWhen you spend the kind of money my husband did on that meal, you expect a higher level of service. I have been to places much less formal while pregnant that will try to be creative and find something for me to drink. I get it; some waiters don't like working on a holiday, but don't let your attitude affect your job performance. I heard him talk to another table of regulars and he made an off-cuff remark to the lady at the table about how she ate all her food. No lady wants to be made to feel like she is a pig. Maybe he's just not good at serving women.

Lemon poppy was a little but sour for me. The chocolate one was really sweet, too much frosting in my opinion, and creme br√ªl√©e was disappointing :(. Both my sister and I loved the OG and blueberry the most which makes sense why those are two are the top sellers. \\n\\nWe got a small coffee to go with the sweets and I was surprised to see they offered Soy milk on the side.

They have an omelet station, and I like how they have you fill out a little card with your order and bring it up to them. They bring it out to you when it's ready, so you don't have to waste time waiting around for it while drooling over all the scrumptious food and smells that surround you. \\n\\nI've had great service each time that I've been here. Two of the times I stopped by - lunch on Saturday and then brunch on Sunday - were during my lunch break in the midst of a weekend-long class, so naturally I was in a bit of a rush both times. Both times, our waiter was extremely accommodating and made sure that things moved along as quickly as possible.\\n\\nOverall though, Tavern in the Square isn't really a location that I'd be likely to return to.

They had such delicate flavors, which were accompanied by two sauces, which had bold tastes. I loved the bread on its own and with the sauces. The vegetarian dumplings were a little disappointing. While they were very meaty in consistency, and it definitely is a hearty meal for a cold day, the flavor was a little bland. However, the chickpea dish was amazing!

We had already started our meal, so they knew we couldn't do anything and took advantage of the situation. Even if they had postponed clearing up everything by 10-15 min, that would have been fine.

There is a fine line between tender and juicy and tough, particularly when delivered.  We never had a problem before but this time the calamari was very tough.... kinda like rubber bands.  I strayed from my usual pepperoni and sausage calzone and decided to try the cheese steak Stromboli.  Wish I had not done that... the cheese steak was filled with raw white onions and the steak was a bit thick and tough.  I really expected tender meat and and no onions at all, as I had specifically asked to NOT have onions.  Raw white onions are VERY over whelming in this dish.

The Shooting Point oysters however were definitely good. It was like night and day compared to the other 5. \\n\\nAs for the plates, we had the following:\\n\\nBang Bang lobster roll- This was a relatively small H&F roll stuffed with a decent amount of lobster drizzled with a sriracha mayo-type sauce. It was surprisingly good, and left a lingering burn on my lips that was actually pleasant. \\n\\nSeafood stew- Braised tilapia in a tomato-based sauce (with a kick!) with octopus, clams, shrimp, and chickpeas. A solid seafood stew- the chickpeas served as a filler, but complemented the rest of the elements well. \\n\\nManila clams- Swimming in a tart yet creamy broth, this clam dish was definitely interesting on the palate in a good way. \\n\\nIf oysters are the main draw of this place (as per their name), they should pay a bit more attention to their oysters.

The cheesecake wasn't in slices but in a cute tart-like form and so thick I couldn't eat it all at once and saved it for later in the fridge. All of the desserts I chose were excellent (especially the fruit tart and the sweet potato cheesecake).\\n\\nThe boyfriend, while snacking on my desserts also found them heavenly.

Had read about the great price fixe dinner ($24 includes 3 courses and a glass of house wine).\\n\\nI made a reservation for 6:30, but my wife didn't get done work until that time, so I called and they quickly changed to 7. No problems at all! \\n\\nParking:\\nParking lot was full when we got there, so we had to park in a lot that was marked for some baby-store, but the store was closed, so that was ok. They share the parking lot with 2 or 3 other businesses. There's really not any on-street parking next to the place-- have to go a block or two away.  there was a parking garage behind the restaurant, but we didn't need it, so I don't know if it's public or private garage.\\n\\nDecor: alright. There was some giant chandelier that looked like it was covered in cobwebs, which was the main light source for the area we were in (by the front door), and was kind of off-putting, but not too bad.\\nMost tables are two-seaters, but they did have a few four-tops. There was a large group in the back corner when we arrived, but I didn't see if they had tables pushed together or were all sitting at tables close together.\\n\\nStaff:\\nVery friendly and attentive wait staff, and the owners/managers greeted us as we entered and when we left.  Very smiley and asking us how our day was, etc. small talk you don't usually get at a lot of places. Water glasses were constantly filled. one staff person stopped by 3 times asking if we would like some complimentary wheat or garlic bread. \\n\\n\\nThe food:\\nWe both had a slice of the wheat bread. Dense, but very flavorful and not overly filling. Served with olive oil and spices for dipping.\\n\\nI had the hanger steak price fixe dinner. Started with a \\"skewer\\" of shrimp. Absolutely delicious! Shrimp cooked perfectly, and great seasoning! The \\"smears\\" on the plate really enhanced the flavor, but were totally unneeded!  The glass of house Merlot was pretty good. I'm not a big red-wine fan, but this stuff was tasty!\\n\\nWife ordered a bowl of the lobster bisque, and I decided to add one as well. Delicious! Creamy, without being overly thick. Just a hint of heat at the bottom of the bowl.\\n\\nCaesar Salad--- I was most disappointed in this, but mostly because wife makes a kick a$$ caesar dressing.  The lettuce was a little wilted, and there was too much anchovy, IMO. Very salty.\\n\\nMain course: I had hanger steak, as stated previously. A little too medium for my taste (had ordered medium rare), but still very juicy with a touch of pink in the center. Again, a bit too salty, but incredibly flavorful. The pomme frites were excellent-- I like 'em crunchy, and they were! I'm not a big fan of ketchup, but tried the home-made ketchup they provided and wanted to spit it out instantly. I was almost like a tomato gelato-- very sugary.  Of course, the fries were wonderful on their own and didn't need the ketchup.  They were stacked on a smear of some type of smokey bbq type sauce, which was much better than the ketchup.\\n\\nMy wife had the Kobe Beef Burger. She said it was the most delicious burger she had ever had. Topped with home-made pickles, and blue cheese crumbles (usually comes with Swiss cheese, but wife hates Swiss-- they kindly made the substitution).\\n\\nFor dessert they were out of the chocolate cake, so we had the white cake. OMG! AMAZING. \\n\\nIn all we spent about $80 for dinner, including a glass of white wine my wife had and dessert (plus the extra bisque I ordered). Spent about an hour and a half, and had a wonderful time! \\n\\nPS-- Price Fixe dinners are only on Monday and Tuesdays from 6-9:30. A lot of older people were in the restaurant.

I would give this \\"food court\\" like Korean cafe a better rating if they simply just had better customer service, to all clients and culture. In the many years of patroning this place, since before the availability of Yelp, I often wondered how I would get my feelings heard.  Now with Yelp...all businesses are at the mercy of Customer Service. \\n\\nSimply put, the people behind the counter, often give better service to their own, meaning their own Korean race.  If you don't speak their language, your portions and side dishes are smaller and less. This hasn't been a one time incident. The test have been tried time and time again, when I dine with and without a Korean friend. If you are not Korean, dine alone, then go with a Korean friend on a different time and order the exact same things, you'll experience two different treatments each time. Sad, but is the reality.  This have been going on for years...I've come to terms with it and still go back because the food is good. I'm sure they know this. \\n\\nAlso, the straw that broke the camel's back was when I went in to order take out this evening. DON'T ORDER TAKE OUT here; you would have to pay an up charge of $1 to take your food home..., really?!?!!  That is just ludicrous! It's not that I'm not willing to pay the additional measly dollar...it's the principle of the matter. Do you want my business or not?  This is the only cafe, facility I know of that charges you additional quarter per box, if you do not finish your food, in which you paid CASH for, because that is all that they will accept (tax evasion red flag), and need a box to wrap up your leftovers, when you dine in; it is also the same facility that has an up charge to do take out. To me, that is no different than telling your clients that you would have to charge them a separate charge because you need utensils to eat their food with while dining in. The next thing you know, they'll charge you for the dish soap that is needed to wash the bowl you ate from.  Sigh!\\n\\nThe price of each entree have gone up in the years, as expected with everything else. Their price also supposedly include tax, but wait...they only accept CASH and the prices are in whole numbers...so what is the price of each entree and what percentage tax am I charged...or is all this a fa√ßade in confusing you and I so much that no one cares, or just over looks it?! Hmmm?  I'm ok with the price at whatever each merchant want to set it at. I will pay for it if it is followed with good food and consistent service, and as listed.  I just feel ripped off when the merchant seems entitled to charge any price for any reason, selling the same thing, be it dining in or taking out. Having an up charge for takeouts over dining in, just tells me that this business do not want a take out business. Either that or they are encouraging people to bring their own Tupperware boxes to contain the food that they are buying to take home.  So, not only is this place in the food business, they are also selling containers, styrofoam ones too. Every time you order takeout, you pay for the styrofoam to take your food home.

It just needs something else, and I don't know what! The Salmon got a rave review at our table. \\n\\nI ordered a beverage, a Spiced Rum and Apple Cider drink made with Captain Jerry's Rum. The waiter was in disbelief that I hadn't heard of this wonderful Rum, so I asked, what's so wonderful about it, like where is it made? He goes to check the label and comes back to tell me it's made in New Jersey!  I roared with laughter. Then I asked for a straw.

We had no reservations on a Saturday night. I had heard that they didn't take them, but I was wrong. However with a little patience on our part and theirs, we were fitted in. They dispatched us next door to Henri's first - for a glass of wine. Nice touch.\\nWe were seated at one of the high 6-top tables. It was going to be a dinner with strangers. It felt like we had been invited to dinner with friends, and we were going to meet new people. We did, and our dinner companions were fantastic. Added greatly to the experience. A bonus.\\nNow to the main event (or in this case the 14 main events). We had the tasting menu and drinks pairings. Being used to Dallas prices, this didn't really phase us. $75 for the tasting menu itself + $8 for the extra plate (of mushrooms in a fish sauce caramel)  + the wine pairings meant we were for a fairly hefty bill. But, I think, well worth the money.\\nI loved it that we didn't like all the dishes! That's part of the idea. You are taken beyond the comfort zone and get to try things you otherwise might not have thought about. So bravo!\\nIt was very busy/hectic, but then getting 14 dishes in 2 1/2 hours is bound to be.  Because of the cramped quarters we were slightly uncomfortable - difficult for the wait staff to get in and manage the table. But that was a minor quibble.\\nSo what was there to love? The aforementioned mushrooms. The duck blood crepe was to die for, the duck custard was very special and the compressed watermelon with squid jerky and pumpkin seeds paired with a somewhat funky Sake (Yuho Kimoto Junmai) was unbelievable.  \\nThe rest of the dishes were well prepared and beautifully presented too, but those were, for me the standouts.\\nThanks to my Austin friends who had been pushing me to try Barley Swine.

If there wasn't a big hill in the way - I'd be able to see their building from my house. \\n\\n Unfortunately, I checked this as I was eating the pizza at home.  After meeting their minimum then adding tax plus their delivery fee - I was in to my single delivered pizza (and added garlic knots) for $35.

Having been to The Cowfish at Perimeter Mall numerous times now, I feel that I can give a fair review.\\n\\nThe Cowfish tends to get very busy, so either make a reservation in advance online via Zomato (find link at The Cowfish website) or be prepared for a wait.  I've made a reservation before every visit, so I haven't had to wait for a table.\\n\\n| Appetizers |\\n\\nI normally don't order appetizers, but I've tried several here because they are so good!  Each of the following apps is served with wonton chips:\\n\\n* Blackened Tuna Nachos - \\"Crab Rangoon Dip, avocado salsa, tomatoes, seared rare blackened yellowfin tuna and microgreens.\\"  The tuna is fresh and this app is unique and delicious!  It's my favorite of the apps I've tried here and I highly recommend it!\\n\\n* Spicy Poke Dip - \\"Spicy tuna poke w/salmon and yellowtail, seaweed salad.\\"  If you're a fan of raw fish and spicy food, this is the app for you!\\n\\n* Crab Rangoon Dip - \\"Creamy crab rangoon w/parmesan panko crust, Thai sweet chili sauce and chives.\\"  There's a surprising amount of crab in this dip, and if you love the traditional crab rangoon, you'll love this version of it!\\n\\n| Entrees |\\n\\n\\"Burgushi\\"\\n\\nIf it's your first time dining here, I recommend you flip towards the back of the menu to the \\"Burgushi\\" section.  I feel that the entrees in this section really capture the essence of what The Cowfish is all about!\\n\\n* What's Shakin' Tuna Bacon Sandwich - \\"Seared rare blackened yellowfin tuna, applewood bacon, iceberg, jalape√±os, tomato salsa, Asian slaw and spicy mayo, served between grilled spring roll wrapper 'buns' filled with kani and sushi rice.\\"  I fell in love with this sandwich in Orlando!  It's a unique way to eat seared tuna, but the hubs and I agree that the Orlando location makes this better.  The slice of tuna you get in this sandwich at the Atlanta location is about half the thickness of the one we had in Orlando - and we have pictures to prove it.  While I still enjoy this sandwich and recommend it, be sure to check that all toppings that should be in the sandwich are in it!  Once, the kitchen forgot to put bacon in it - and \\"bacon\\" is in the name of the sandwich!\\n\\n* The Cowfish Bento Box - \\"Mini-burger with American cheese, pickles and chopped red onion, sweet potato fries; Thai cucumbers; edamame; and choice of 4-piece sushi roll (California, Spicy Tuna, Vegetarian or Philly).\\"  I ordered this during my first visit to the Atlanta restaurant and was underwhelmed.  The \\"mini-burger\\" was served cold, as if it had been sitting out for a while, and it was cooked well-done when we wanted it to be medium.  Everything else in the box was just mediocre.  I don't recommend this.\\n\\n* The All-American Bacon Double Cheeseburgooshi - \\"Seasoned all natural Angus beef, yellow cheddar, white cheddar, applewood bacon, and red onion, wrapped in soy paper and potato strings then flash fried. Topped with ketchup, mustard, dill pickle and Roma tomato. Served atop Cowfish sauce.\\"  This most peculiar roll I've tried at The Cowfish literally tastes like a cheeseburger with rice!  The ingredients in the roll made an interesting mix of flavors that is not bad, but I didn't love it.  Try this if you're feeling adventurous and want a roll with no raw fish in it.\\n\\n\\"Fusion Specialties\\"\\n\\n* The Angry Lobster - \\"Tempura lobster and cucumber, topped w/premium salmon, fried kimchi, green onion, honey kimchi sauce.\\"  I'm not a fan of salmon, but this lobster (sushi) roll is tasty!  Try it if you're up for a splurge!\\n\\n\\"Burgers & Sandwiches\\"\\n\\nEach of the following burgers I've tried consists of a half-pound beef burger and comes with your choice of a side: \\n\\n* Black Truffle Cheese Burger - \\"Black truffle cheese, roasted shallots, saut√©ed mushrooms, roasted garlic aioli, lettuce, brioche bun.\\"  This is my favorite of the burgers I've had!\\n\\n* The Boursin Bacon Burger - \\"Garlic & herb boursin cheese, applewood bacon, saut√©ed mushrooms, grilled onions, lettuce, tomato, onion roll.\\"  This burger is messy but tasty!\\n\\n* Granny's Southern Pimento Cheese Burger - \\"Housemade pimento cheese, fried green tomato, jalape√±o bacon, red onion, lettuce, Duke's mayo, marbled rye.\\"  This was okay but also very messy, and I wasn't a fan of the rye.\\n\\n| Dessert |\\n\\n* The Mousse is Loose - \\"Layers of classic fudge brownie, chocolate mousse and vanilla mousse.\\"  If you celebrate your birthday here, this is served complimentary as the staff sings a Japanese birthday song.  Since it's a brownie, it's much denser than a cake, but it's good!\\n\\nOverall, The Cowfish Atlanta gets 4 stars for their unique and tasty fusion food!  We've had great service during two visits, but service has generally been mediocre.

I'll just touch on a few:\\n\\nBueberry bourbon was dry and didn't even taste unique, just sweet. \\n\\nThe carrot zaatar was a huge miss, it was overwhelmingly meat-like in flavor which was very off putting. I love zaatar spice, but I think I'll pass on it being used in desserts in my future. \\n\\nThe PB&J was good, but I wish they left the spice off. I'm a fan of unique combos and spiced desserts... but this one seems a little thrown together. It's like you take a bite, and it's good, but then your mouth gets a little spicy afterwards... I just don't really get it since it wasn't actually adding to the flavor overall. \\n\\nCreme br√ªl√©e- yeah this is delicious and I would get it again and again. Crunchy candies outside, nice custard inside with a pipette of Cointreau - yum. \\n\\nSo, I want to try going AGAIN...

My grilled cheese.  $6.19 for a bad sandwich.  I have come to expect more from Panera (I have used their catering and it's always been good).  This sandwich was two pieces of soggy bread with 1 slice of American cheese, slapped together,  very uneven, no thought to appearance (see the photo I am attaching).  Did I mention it was $6.19?  It does come with a bag of chips, so that offset the cost a little.\\n\\n2. A cup of tomato soup for $4.29.  That's a lot for a cup of soup that was filled to just over half full.  The soup did taste good.  It came with a roll.  No butter.  Not sure if I am supposed to ask?  I wouldn't think I would need to.  \\n\\n3. Poor packaging---My cup of soup was set on my sandwich, so one half of the sandwich was even more squished and soggy than the other one.\\n\\n4. No soup spoon.

My companions and I started with different soups and found them all to be bold and satisfying. In particular, I was pleased to try the duck soup, an item uncommon in US Thai restaurants I have been to. The broth was rich, the duck tender and pleasingly fatty, and the cilantro a good balancer. We also were happy with the curry puffs, which came out piping hot. Not strong on the curry flavor, they were nonetheless tasty, with more emphasis on the enjoyable texture -- crisp on the outside, revealing a medium flaky crust, and a potato soft interior. The accompanying dipping sauce was more tangy and acidic than typical, but it was tempered by sweetness. The standard pad Thai was well executed, combining classic flavor with good attention to textures. Not only were the noodles cooked well, avoiding the sloppy oily mass some other Thai places get away with, the shrimp were exceptional. Salted, seared ever so slightly, and cooked to tender perfection, they had obviously been removed from the heat at just the right time, avoiding the toughness encountered so often at most restaurants where churning out tons of food means losing a sense of timing so crucial to seafood. To close the meal, we tried three desserts -- a black rice pudding, a squash custard, and a golden bean pudding. All were good, we thought, but the black rice was a favorite. Both puddings were doused in coconut milk, harkening to the restaurant's name, with the rice pudding flavor a delicious mix of sweet with some salt, resulting in a buttery sensation. The golden beans were mashed, and the flavor was less sweet for those seeking a lighter end to the meal. \\n\\nIf I lived in this area, this would become a regular place for me. The use of better initial ingredients results in better tasting food, and this much was clear to my party. Although other reviews show some growing pains with service, we didn't encounter any problems with accuracy or speed and, in fact, were able to chat with the friendly manager about food allergies and how some dishes were prepared.

This restaurant used to be Ararat.  Ararat was a Kurdish middle-eastern restaurant with a complicated and unusual menu.  Ararat started out great but suffered from bad management and poor upkeep. Ararat circled the drain for a couple of years until the bad management eventually drove away even the most loyal of their fans.\\n\\nBack then, there was a very friendly belly dancer named Phara who danced at the restaurant.  Phara bought the place and has done a marvelous job of turning it around.\\n\\nThe restaurant is clean.  The host is friendly and makes you feel welcome.  No reservation?  No problem- they'll try their best to work you in.  Phara is usually there and chats with most of the patrons or at least stops by every table to say, \\"Welcome.\\"  When is the last time the owner of a restaurant in Austin stopped by and greeted you and thanked you for coming?\\n\\nWhat used to be a dusty, dirty, dark restaurant with middle eastern carpets on the walls now looks like a charming, clean and trendy space.  There's a beautiful, spacious patio out back that is great for large groups.  She recently bought the shop next door and has added \\"Christopher's Casbah\\" (named in memory of her son) that can accomodate large groups, parties and special events.\\n\\nThe food was good.  Nicely prepared middle eastern food- kebabs, basmati rice and traditional sides like hummus and baba ghanoush.  For the novice eater, it's not overly spicy.  For those who are familiar with middle eastern food, it has fresh ingredients and the simplicity of home-cooked food.  I did miss some of the more unusual dishes that were on the Ararat menu but to Phara's credit, she has stuck with the basics- a simple menu that appeals to the more American palate.  And the freshness of the ingredients and the welcoming atmosphere made for a pleasant dining experience.\\n\\nAreas for improvement- the baba ghanoush tasted a bit premade- it should be a bit smokier and less pureed.  Everything else was fresh and the rice was particularly well prepared.\\n\\nThe restaurant takes reservations (and reservations are probably a good idea for weekend evenings).  It's BYOB since they don't have a liquor license.  There's ample parking in front of the restaurant and local businesses on North Loop.  If you have children, you may prefer to sit on the patio since the inside portion of the restaurant is small.  If you have a large group, you should either request a reservation for the Casbah or the patio."},{"name":"Kee Wee Entertainment","address":"780 E Sr 434","city":"Winter Springs","stars":"3","text":"Food was gross and bread rolls and app was frozen.

Customer service.. where?? My fries.. where?? The ranch.. WHERE?!? I came here with my girlfriend and her sister. Oddly enough I was actually excited for Popeyes, as I usually go to the Mcloughlin Popeyes. To my surprise I made the worst mistake and ended up with a frantic outcome. At first I wasn't greeted or asked at the front counter if I needed help or was ready to order. The girl behind the counter had a rude and uncomfortable attitude. She had this look on her face which was unpleasant. We asked for ranch dipping sauce with our meals and the girl said for sure. After our order was done we got the food almost immediately. Though she forgot to put ranch in our boxes, I asked her for ranch. Next thing you know is, \\"oh sorry we're out of ranch\\". I was astonished as she told we would get ranch and now they all the sudden ran out. We asked for sauces and the girl looked very annoyed. Well honestly I'm just trying to get and eat some good food. There is legit no reason to have an attitude for us to enjoy our food. We sat down and started eating and I realized something. I ordered a #7, 5 piece chicken tenders with a side of fries. My box had at most less than 10 fries. Where at Popeyes at Mcloughlin, I would get at least more than 20 fries. As I was eating my girlfriend's sister was eating her meal. A kids meal of 4 piece nuggets and fries. Her box was stupidly filled with fries and had way more than 4 nuggets. Like do these guys have a single clue what proportioning is?? The meals with almost always come with a Biscuit as well. But when we got our food they didn't put in or asked us if we wanted anything for our biscuits. I went to go ask for some honey to the girl behind the counter. After getting her attention and asked for honey. She then went on to get 4 packets and straight up threw them to me rather then handing them to me. The lack of customer support for this restaurant was belittling. After that atrocity, the tops for the cups didn't fit the cups that they give you. They were very hard to put on and I had to use at least 3 before I could get one to properly fit. But after getting one to fit on, I then picked up my cup only to have it spill all over me because the top failed to grip the cup. Like this Popeyes has been top tier garbage. Frantic customer service. Lack of any good reason to even go here. So everyone who actually wants Popeyes, just go to the one in Mcloughlin.

I can see how folks would want to jump on the bandwagon and say this place is great cause it's the easy thing to do - but it isn't great. \\n\\nI had an out of town guest come in - someone who I really wanted to impress - and he wanted Thai. I should have vetoed his request and taken him to Vij's. \\n\\nTo start - \\n\\nIt's nice inside. A cozy space, clean, and can accommodate small groups. We sat at a two top along the wall, which was nice and out of the way. \\n\\nOur server was very ... interesting. Both my guest and I are pretty outgoing guys and we wanted the server's thoughts on what she would recommend. NOTHING. She didn't give us ANY insight into the menu after my friend asked her. After she danced around his question, I asked her again what she would recommend - I tried to help her - what's popular? What do you like? Etc. She stonewalled me too. She turned it back to us and asked if we saw anything that we might want. Honestly. WTF?!? Why give us such a hard time? Both our first time there. My guest originally asked, \\"what dishes you recommend get you the biggest tip?\\" Well since she didn't recommend anything I'm sure the tip was standard. It's like she hadn't ever tried any of the dishes. It's like she had never served there. It's like she had never looked at the menu before. Actually she did recommend on thing ... Pad Thai ... So many unique things on the menu, and we're told ... Pad Thai ... \\n\\nBefore delving into the food - portion size are for birds - or regular people who ordinarily don't like to stuff their faces, like me.\\n\\nSOOOOO ... we just picked at random. We started with the Tom Kaa Gai (Creamy Hot and Sour Soup of Chicken Thighs). It was really tasty, nicely spicy, sourish, and the broth left a clean after taste. The chicken and mushrooms were good too, although wish there was a little more chicken in it.  A four star soup.\\n\\nPla tort Samun Plai (8 Spice Fish)\\nShould be renamed 8 Sugar Fish. I think they might have forgotten to put any spices on ours. Or maybe they just want to drown the spices out with the overly sugary and sweet sauce. Shame. It ought to have more of a spice bite, more crisp by just drizzling some of that sugary stuff, and placing the crispy fish ON the sauce. This is an unfortunate one star dish. \\n\\nGeng Hung Leh (Burmese Currey of Sloping Hills Pork)\\nGot this mainly for the name. Sloping Hills Pork - awesome. This was very aromatic. The taste was pretty good. Nothing over the top but a four star dish. \\n\\nFor dessert, I had the fried Banana - it was pure shades of the 8 spice fish. I think they might use the same crispy batter on the fish, that they use on the banana, and the same sugar sauce they use on the fish, on the banana. Came with a side of soy ice cream, but to have the same consistency in a main then in a dessert - not so hot. \\n\\nMy guest had the mango with sticky rice. He thought it was OK. Funny thing, though. We got there at 6 p.m. and when he ordered his dessert he was told that it was their last mango, so he was lucky. So the joint only had one mango for the night? \\n\\n----\\nOn a good note, a couple of weeks ago I emailed these guys because their website menu was coming up as an error for me in Firefox. They have since fixed it so kudos. Now if you can only fix some of the quality of food and service, maybe I'll return. It's tough, though, in such a rich foodie market to make a luke-warm impression and get a return visit."},{"name":"Wilfs Restaurant & Bar","address":"800 NW 6th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"We chose this restaurant because it was a Groupon which I had purchased.

The burger was cooked medium perfectly, something that is normally done correctly, and the fries were tasty, but nothing special.  The cheeses were melted well, the only thing I would have changed was to give the bacon a little more flavor, it was overtakes by the burger sauce.  After the burger, I was still slightly hungry (as I usually am - the burger was very filling) so I ordered two scoops of Ghiradelli ice cream.  Usually I don't do chocolate ice cream, so it was a little too rich for me but that is just personal preference.

She rolled her eyes and assured us that there was no pork in the dish. When we got the food and tasted it, it clearly tasted and smelled like pork. We said to the server \\"We really hope you checked with the kitchen, because he has an allergy to pork and I would hate for this to be pork.\\" Her eyes got really wide, and she ran back to the kitchen. She came back with a \\"manager\\" that looked no older than 15, who apologized and told us that it was in fact pork!

It's rare that NYC journalists give Boston a win, but after matching NYTimes and Boston Yelp's love for O Ya, I came to see if WSJs love for Speeds was justified.\\n\\nFirstly the dog is huge, but it's actually meat you can buy yourself from the store... a foot long Pearl Knockwurst (made in MA). I felt cheated at that point but I guess you aren't going to pre-marinate them like Speed does and your charcoal BBQ isn't going to be just right like Speed's is, pouring soot out all over his sweet people in their cart.\\n\\nI got mine with onions and Speed's sweet sauce and oh yeah it was tasty, in a toasted sub roll with a hint of sweet and a lick of spice. Filling too. Chili, mustard and relish are also tempting options. Everything's tempting when you're starving, panting and in some random dirty parking lot / meat-packing warehouse.\\n\\nSo is it worth the hype? It's a very good hot dog but for the nation's best and for $7 I was expecting something more than just store-bought sausage. Maybe more like handcrafted from endangered wild boar by captive children in Senegal or something?

The braised short ribs were truly remarkable. The flavor was like a rocket ship to the moon in my mouth and every bite just melted. Definitely would recommend it.

What is THAT!\\" Will have to come back and try everything.\\n\\nI finished with one of their small fresh Belgian waffles. Cooked to perfection, so light, so sweet, and couldn't have been better. They have several toppings or sauces to dip them in and the white chocolate pistachio rosewater was recommended. Absolutely perfect. I look forward to trying different ones next time.\\n\\nAll in all this was a perfect place for brunch. They wait can be easily an hour or more for 2+, but when I went solo it was just 25 minutes.

The menu is completely different from what their usual menu is so no point in rehashing the dishes and making recommendations... \\n\\nWhat really did it for me was that the service was phenomenal. Firstly, they had lost our reservation and it was a busy busy night. But instead of turning us away, they offered to seat us in the Tiki Room once it opened and serve us in there, and in the meantime seated us at the bar and brought us complimentary champagne. Not only that, the hostess continually checked up on us to make sure we were comfortable and to update us on the situation. Luckily, we were seated sooner than expected. Secondly, our server was SO patient and SO great at explaining what each of the dishes were and what to expect.

The pace of freshly stocked carts was also very good.  We were stuffed in the first 15 minutes (a clear tactical error).  Next time we will be more patient and pace ourselves.

I add just a little extra chili oil to give it more spice as preference but it is already spicy enough in my opinion.  Add a milk tea or bubble tea with your noodles and you are set for a nice lunch.  The menu recently changed and it seems like they have added more variety so look through it as there are a lot of photos for those who are unsure what they are getting.

Let's make a nice fresh sauce, nice simple crust and you can't miss? ....except you can. This was a difficult review for me to write because I'm all honesty the ambiance, location, and the staff were amazing. I would have to say that without a doubt the host and waiter were the friendliest I have met in a long time. Respectful yet casual, and course accommodating. So this review reflects the overall experience.\\n1) The setting and staff: Again, impeccable, clean, accommodating, and made everything very easy to enjoy. The restrooms were near, freshly cleaned, and well maintained. The tables were spotless and the silverware and napkins fresh. It almost seemed that the cleaning was double checked which I greatly appreciate. \\n2) The Price: Too much for most items, see examples in the food description.\\n\\n3) The food: a rundown..\\nAppetizers: a) The Meatballs: were perfect. The proportion of beef to pork was completely balanced, with just the right amount of herbs. The sauce ruined this dish though. It's a good sauce, but in all honesty if you close your eyes and take a spoonful, it tastes very similar to Chef Boyardee. I don't know if it's canned tomatoes im tasting, or a heavy hand of salt, but the sauce could be improved. b) Fritto Misto: Okay so this restaurant apparently loves olives. There is olive oil and fried olives in everything including the bread itself which was horribly bland. The batter on the Fritto Misto was salty. The high crime of this dish is the lack of protein and actual calamari in the appetizer. Literally, I counted, and my portion was 70 % fried onions and olives and 30% small pieces of calamari and 2 medium sized shrimp.\\nThe Entrees:none of them were bad...but one of them was not good either..\\n a) house special braised beef, perfectly tender, well seasoned and nicely plated. The Jus was lovely but way too similar to french onion soup, I would have liked the sauce reduce a little more. To make it worst they serve a potent cake which absorbs all the salt making the polenta almost unbearable so the point that you hardly notice the spinach on time. This dish was a 2.5 out of 5\\n b) Mushroom Pizza ( add prosciutto ) , I'd go back this alone. This pizza was simply one of the best I have had in a long time. The crust was perfectly rolled, nice and thin, and the proportion of cheese ricotta truffle oil mushroom and prosciutto were perfectly balanced. 4 out 5\\nc) Finally, the think to go back for..The Alfredo rotini. This was a unique spin on a classic Alfredo sauce that used nuts to add a lovely surprising texture. The chicken was moist, well done, but the sauce...oh my god the sauce was just amazing. I could keep eating this.\\n\\nDessert: The Flourless Chocolate Cake: Meh its basically a brownie. Nothing too special. It was good not great. Not bad at all. \\n\\nOverall: I recommend that if you're gonna order an appetizer just get the meatballs. Don't bother with anything else.\\nStick to the pasta sauces and the pizzas. I have not seen any evidence of ability to season balanced, without too much salt or olive oil. \\nSkip the bread it has no flavor except on top. \\n\\nThis restaurant was good. I'd go back. But I wouldn't go out of my way. \\n\\nMental note: I was very disappointed to know that any italian restaurant does not have cannolis and/or tiramisu. That is a high crime in my book. The dessert menu needs work. I'm sorry, but it's not a dessert a place.

It deceivingly doesn't look like enough food but the effort of grabbing small bites at a time with pieces of injera, and then the injera slowly expanding in your stomach ... you will feel full near the end of your meal.

We had a vegetarian in our party so we ordered 3 of these.

It's probably their signature & most popular dish. The sauce was the best part. This dish has tilapia marinated in a special blend of houses spices, onions, tomatoes, and peppers layered over shiro. I loved the garlicky flavor. \\n\\nRIBEYE TIBS - $12\\nEveryone else (minus the vegetarian of course) liked this dish - I thought it was just ok. The sauce with the fish tibs was much much better. This dish has prime ribeye sauteed in a special blend of house spices, onions, tomatoes, peppers, and Ethiopian butter, with a house salad. \\n\\nGOULDER BOL - $24\\nWe also tried a bottle of Ethiopian dry red wine - b/c we were curious.

All the food on the menu sounded great. Just wished it hadn't taken over an hour for the waitress to come back, and that was after trying to wave her down a couple times only to watch her look away and start talking to another waitress as they just stood around and then joined by another server. One of my friends actually had to go to the bar area and ask to have the waitress sent over. There were 5 empty drinks by the time she showed and we ordered another round and I ordered the French bread pepperoni pizza and the sweet potato tots. The tots with the sugar and cinnamon were amazing and was extremely surprised to not see a Stouffer's French bread pizza brought out. It was fresh French bread, but it was extremely buttered instead of having pizza sauce with generous portion of cheese and fresh chopped pepperoni. The butter oozing out the bread made it taste strange, would like to see them change to a pizza sauce instead. Some of the others got the chicken tenders and said they were OK. Needless to say we pretty much didn't see the waitress for the following 2 hours we were there. Service is huge in the restaurant industry. If a server chooses to be inattentive, less sales for the restaurant and lower bill and poor service means less tips.

Hands-down \\"The Orient\\". Where else can you find BBQ duck, chicken, green onion and tomatoes in a deep-dish pizza?\\n\\nAside from the aforementioned pizza creations, there are also the classics and create-your-own.

Some people have complained they are soggy; well I guess kinda at the bottom they are, but what do you expect when they're sitting in all that delicious grease?!  Ok downfall for me actually was my grilled cheese. Pains me to say. But it was on a hamburger bun and the bun was one of those big onion buns and I don't like onions. Totally ruined it for me. They did cut it up into four cute triangles though and I only managed to get through two of them (the cheese combo was yum). Tubs ate the rest.  He also raved about his burger - told the cook as we were leaving how good it was (the kitchen is open to the seating area).  The price for that burger for what you got is a great deal.  This restaurant was very close to our AirBNB and is casual and good. Nice indoor and outdoor seating areas.  \\n\\nOh also - I left my purse and my glasses inside when tubby and I left.

But I realized, never mind...that's not why I go there, and I know now just not to order them. In fact, Thierry's saved my butt a few times when I had promised to bring macarons to a function, and was going to try out a new bakery but they were clean out of them. I called up Thierry and they still had some at 4pm!\\n\\nThe deal is that they make batches of macarons through the day. If you get there right after the lunch crowd, they're likely to be completely out, or if you get there too early, say at 10am, those delectable delicacies are still being baked. Either way, when they're out, they'll make more later. If you know you need an order ahead of time, just call them up and ask, and that'll save you some disappointment. \\n\\nAnyhow, if you are in the neighborhood, definitely stop by and treat yourself to some macarons.

The 4S's is the key to good Thai food people. \\n\\nNext, try their specials. The chef here is innovative I will give them that. Definitely what they say is a twist to the traditional Thai dishes. I was there over the weekend and had the Phuket style kanom jeen. I was in Thailand three years ago and that is what I ate. This is the real sheez. It is a curry based noodle dish that has fish meat and fish balls stirred up in a spicy red (or yellow?) curry over thin rich noodles. What's great is that it comes with a side of medley veggies. How perfectly balanced. \\n\\nAs for their cocktail, Tom Kah is by far the most inventive thing here. It tastes like the coconut soup but with vodka.... why didn't anyone think of this?!?!? I can eat my food and drink it too! I also enjoy their house infused vodka in their rendition of Tom Yum.. can't wait for summer because this will be very refreshing.

On one occasion my boyfriend and I were sat upstairs in a half booth, and we were touching elbows with the couple next to us as they discussed their sex-life and how they were a wonderful couple because they like to eat at places like Coast (it actually added to my entertainment).  Another time we had a waiter threaten that if we didn't order \\"right now\\" that we were going to have to wait a long time to get our food.  It's just not what I expect from a higher-end restaurant."},{"name":"Gus's World Famous Fried Chicken","address":"117 San Jacinto Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"With the little Elvises, Memphis Grizzlies signs, and a black and white photo of downtown Memphis, you might be wondering what Gus's connection to Memphis is.  Well it's a chain, and Memphis seems to be its home.\\n\\nIt seems to be a trend now to replace flavor with heat.  The breading of the chicken is bland and hot.  I don't mind hot, but it should be combined with actual herbs and spices like, I don't know, maybe Popeye's, or even KFC.  Both make better chicken, and you don't have to wait 30 minutes for your order.\\n \\nThe cole slaw is creamy, and tastes all right. I subbed fried okra for the beans.  It was cold and hard.  Fried chicken doesn't have to served hot, it can even be eaten cold, but fried okra is best when straight out of the fryer.  If not, it gets hard."},{"name":"The Cowfish - Atlanta","address":"4400 Ashford Dunwoody Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"While we enjoyed the sushi, I am still confused by the concept as I don't see them going together at all.

The Aberdeen Centre & Chef Hung happened to be right across the street from our hotel; seemed like the best idea for this tired tourist. \\n\\nWe were sat quickly and began to peruse the menu. I settled on a passionfruit tea and my husband opted for a soda. For my meal my eyes were drawn to the noodles in ground pork sauce. When the plate arrived the aroma reminded me of the Hamburger Helper my mom used to make as a kid. The flavors were all there and I was immediately catapulted back to the happy memories of my childhood. The noodles were tender but still had a good toothness to them. The ground pork sauce - more like gravy - warmed my belly in the best possible way. While adding the extra spice to my order wasn't an option, this noodle dish would be even better if it had a spicy option. However, a memory of home on vacation is always a nice thing to find.\\n\\nI agree with those that commented negatively on the service.

The price is far closer to what it should be for Columbus and the toppings are more generous and balanced, while not suffering from any quality loss. \\n\\n2) While their pre-made sandwich menu only has a couple of vegetarian options, you can build your own sandwich really easily. Their build-yer-own menu is not too complicated and is laid out really nicely with no hidden costs--very simple pricing structure.\\n\\n3) I've always had good service here. They're friendly, attentive, approachable, and fast, which is all I really want in counter service. \\n\\n4) The space inside is really cute and they have outdoor seating when the weather is nice.\\n\\n5) The deli salads all look really good, and they have a small amount of yummy-looking baked goods. I like that they have other things besides just chips (though I love chips).\\n\\nThe only things I'd change would be the placement of the menus and maybe have an obvious list of beverages available. It's a little awkward standing in the middle of the dining room and staring at the walls. Since the build-your-own menu doesn't face the counter at all, I typed my order into my phone so I could actually remember it when I got to the counter. The beverage cooler is off to the far side of the cafe so browsing it for drinks isn't always good for order flow.\\n\\nOtherwise, two thumbs up."},{"name":"Terry Black's Barbecue","address":"1003 Barton Springs Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I came to Texas from California literally just for the BBQ and Terry Black's was everything I hoped it would be.

Totally a Texas BBQ bar with the wood everywhere and rustic vibe. \\n\\nI of course had to get the brisket and the pork ribs and mac and cheese and beans for my sides. Perfect choice.

We even sat down on the lush lounge furniture to watch The Texas Longhorns beat up on Oklahoma University a bit on the big screen TVs. It was a good day. :-)\\n\\nDid I mention food? No? There's a reason for that. Did we order some? Yep. We ordered the pepperoni pizza (was okay... salty to me), the crispy chicken tacos (they come on cold corn tortillas), and the loaded fries (cheese, sour cream, bacon chives... very underwhelming). None of the food was good to me. It was all just... meh. Not to mention, it was pricey (which, by the way, is never a problem for me if it's also good).  I didn't even take a pic of the food. \\n\\nWill I go back? Definitely! It's quite an impressive place to bring people, from the mandatory valet, to the giant and dramatic entry door, to the upscale decorations and plush furniture.

However, the gentleman at this counter took his time-explained everything, showed us cuts, sizes, etc. I never once felt rushed and felt good about our order. You pay up right there grab your food and find a table. \\n\\nThey have rolls of paper towels floating around everywhere as well as coolers with all of the sauces you could want. The meat was deliciously tender, the mac and cheese was great (not the best I have ever had), LOVED the cream corn, the seasoning on the beans was phenomenal. We saw that the corn bread was in saran wrap and waffled on if we needed it. The lady at the sides counter said its really good and as I grabbed it to discover it was warm to the touch it was game over. That muffin was DELICIOUS.

This is probably one of the worst experiences at a restaurant. The power outlet can only support one pot at a time as using two pots will cause the breaker to shut off. We asked to have this fixed and after 4 attempts they brought a gas burner that failed to boil the soup. Each time we told them it needed constant pestering to get some real service. 1.5 hrs later, the pot was not used so we asked for a refund on the one of 3 pots we ordered. They refused. Basically we had to pay for 3 pots when we only used 2.  Attitude given to us throughout the night when asking for service. This is probably because they do not have enough staff and don't have any real restaurant service experience.  They also are super slow to provide us with food and so we ended up asking for the bill because after asking 3 times where is the food they had no answer.  Another table also complained about the lack of service and food while we were there. Most of the issues could have gone a more positive way if they were more apologetic or tried to give us the best solution and service. \\n\\nNot very business savvy as to save $13 off of a Hotpot for them, they lose out on all tips. \\n\\nPlease don't screw customers, especially when we did not receive what we paid for. \\n\\nAlso had the nerve to say we stayed for longer than the 2 hour time limit.

The food was good, the decor was cute, but lack of fun ambiance, simply a-ok service and immensely disappointing drink kinda made it a less than noteworthy experience.\\n\\nI came here with Evilyn T and my mom to check out the tiki bar, not realizing it was closed until 8pm and after that would be hosting an event with a ten buck cover. We figured Nuba would still be fun because they had cute tiki-ish bamboo decor, and i recalled that the tiki Bar shared certain menu features with Nuba that i had been really into the last time i are at the tiki Bar.\\n\\nWell, they did have some of the same drinks but... Okay, i don't know whether it was our server (who at one point had to come back to the table because she forgot what out order was and didn't write it down) or the bartender, but between when we placed our order and our drinks arrived at our table someone screwed up big time. We ordered three mai tais... and whatever the brought us sure as hell wasn't a Mai Tai. We were all wondering what was up since it was yellowy and light... It seems most likely that we got mojotis instead of mai tais. I really love the mai tais in the tiki bar, but for whatever reason, Nuba's suuuuuucked.\\n\\nFor food, i had the rosted eggplant tartar and goat cheese and the chorizo, both from their guest chef's Argentinian menu. The eggplant tartar was good, but the menu failed to mention that it would be served cold... When i hear 'roasted' i think warm, right? So while it was good, it kinda just reminded me of those lazy nights where instead of cooking you just dive into the chilly container of baba ganoush you have sitting in your fridge. Evilyn mentioned this in her review but i'll say it again: the goat cheese that came with this dish straight up tasted like cream cheese. It' kinda bad when you're eating something and you think 'wow, the warm roasted veggie salad with goat cheese from Panago tastes better than this.'\\n\\nAside from that, even though it was a cute place it just felt weird sitting in there... Maybe it's because we were seated in the section where the interior decorator failed to include any lights (seriously, it was bright everywhere else but we were tucked into this spot that managed to be in the middle of the restaurant but still very dark) or maybe it was just a lack of music and activity. The space is really huge, so even though there were other people there it just felt kinda empty."},{"name":"The Cowfish - Atlanta","address":"4400 Ashford Dunwoody Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"We had a great time.

Just make sure you ask what taco special they have, so you can take that into account when picking your taco fillings. \\n\\nI find the food a mixed bag - guacamole, understandably, not as good as we have in the west. It's lacking the oomph and the size. The tacos were decent though, as they were filled with interesting things like duck, pork belly or mahi mahi. Most of them lacked the kind of spice I have come to love in Mexican cuisine - but like I mentioned, they are reinventing things here, so perhaps I need to keep an open mind.

For this type of restaurant, where each item is separate (rather than a big plate of pasta or salad that can be shared), I think individual plates for each guest would be better."},{"name":"Medina Cafe","address":"780 Richards Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Busy place, looks casual and up beat.  Had great reviews, so decided to take the family.  Had a line up which reviews said was normal.  \\n\\nGot a seat after 30 mins.  The menu looked interesting with descriptions that seemed exotic, enticing and wetted the appetite.  \\n\\nOrdered the much recommended fricassee and a mocha, wife ordered the avocado toast and a latte.\\n\\nThe fricassee came out and looked delicious, the short ribs where tender and juicy.  However once you mixed the dish with the tomato base layer, the flavour of the dish disappeared and the strength of the tomato paste sauce over powered the dish and was way too salty.  \\n\\nCould only taste the salty tomato sauce.  I don't eat moroccan food often, so not sure if this is the taste that is normal.\\n\\nThe espresso's came out luke warm, for a $6 drink, this is unacceptable.  Could get a better coffee at Starbucks.\\n\\nOverall, the food was meh, the drinks where meh, atmoshpere and decor was cool and hip.  So if you are looking for a hip place to be seen, this is the place, if you like quality food then I would look elsewhere."},{"name":"Whiskey's Food & Spirits","address":"885 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"2.5","text":"Classic sports bar for 20-somethings.

First off we were were waiting in line outside and asked the bouncer if we could wait at the bar instead.  Nope.  Can we at least go in, order a beer and come back out?  No.  when we finally had our chance to go inside we waited in line next to the bar and asked the bartender about bringing alcohol outside while we waited in line and she said that it was OK and that the doorman didn't know what he was talking about.  \\n\\nAnyway, after a 15 minute wait outside we finally got permission to go inside and wait in another line (where we were allowed to order a beer), we shuffled along a circuitous route to finally place our orders. \\n\\nThe food delivery system was very odd.  Wait in line outside to wait in another line to order your food at a counter, pay for you food at the counter, receive a table assignment, pick up you r condiments, and sit down at your assigned table.  The waitstaff then brings food.  If you need additional beverages or food, you order from the waitstaff and pay again.\\n\\nI ordered the \\"Primetime\\" (American Kobe Beef, Brie Cheese, Truffle Aioli, Arugula, Caramelized Onions, Steak Sauce) for $12 and a large order of Kennebec Fries for $4.50. \\n\\nThere was a large sign at the counter discouraging substitutions. \\n\\nThe burger and fries were very good, but I can't say that they were $16.50 good. Particularly if you figure in $5 for a pint of good beer (I drank Peacemaker).  Lonestar longnecks were $3, if that's any indication of pricing.\\n\\nYou'd think that a $12 hamburger would at least come with fries, but they're separate and cost $2.25 or $4.50 depending on the size. \\n\\nAll told I spent more than $30 including tax and tip for a burger, fries, and two beers.  Granted, I ordered the most expensive burger on the menu, but even with a cheaper burger and one beer, you should still expect to pay $20.\\n\\nThe food was good and the prices weren't worse than those at an upscale cocktail bar, but upscale bar this is not (no matter how hard it tries to be).  I don't care how good a burger is, If you have to order it at a counter, eat off plastic utensils, and pay three different times over the course of a single meal, there's nothing upscale about it.  \\n\\nIf they ditched the oddball multiple lines and multiple payments and instead just seated patrons, took their orders, brought out their food and drinks, and then brought the tab at the end of the meal, the experience would have been more satisfying and would justify the prices.\\n\\nAs it is now, this place is basically an upscale Fuddruckers at 3x the price."},{"name":"Terry Black's Barbecue","address":"1003 Barton Springs Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"This place is pricey but worth it.

I asked for medium, medium well done- warm pink. However, the burger was cooked well done. If this is a burger joint, they should know how to cook their burgers properly. Also, lamb meat wasn't seasoned as well as I would have liked. Also, it's a good thing I don't mind the lamb meat smell too much because this burger reeked of it.\\n\\nMy friends all went with different types of beef burger and they enjoyed it. rbq is brisket on top of beef burger so if you are in a meaty mood, it'll be a good idea. My other friends got raw steak tartar. They thoroughly enjoyed as they are pure carnivores.\\n\\nThe lamb and steak tartar are $11, but take note that they are pretty small. It's a bit taller than regular burgers, but I have definitely seen and eaten taller burgers that taste better. So, to satisfy our hungry tummies, we ordered sides. I got sweet potato tots while rest of my group got vodka batter onion rings.\\n\\nFirst off, vodka has no strong distinct taste on its own so batter fell flat for me. I much prefer beer battered onion rings. Especially the ones made from locally made beer. Yum. Actually the tater tots were pretty good. Slightly sweet, with a light crisp exterior. Not bad, but $4 for those? Mm.. you can be the judge.\\n\\nThink the ambiance is hipster and cool, but not sure if I'll go back since they didn't know how to cook the lamb burger properly. Maybe I'll give it another go if I happened to be around the area. I still have to try the krispy kreme flavored milkshake."},{"name":"Amrheins","address":"80 W Broadway","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"\\"Just\\" not a good restaurant!
