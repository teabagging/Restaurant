I grew up in the Northwest, and looked forward to this delicacy. It's only available for a couple of weeks a year, and is extremely rare to see served outside of Washington and northern Oregon. The moment I read the story, I booked a reservation.\\n\\nArtist Point is tucked into Disney's Wilderness Lodge. The location has large windows, but they do look out at the rest of the hotel and tree-lined pool area. I don't think sitting by a window adds much to the experience -- from farther back you can still see the pine trees and sky without seeing the pool itself.\\n\\nMy dining companions both got the Duck \\"Two Ways\\" -- one of which was a souffl√©. Both complimented the flavor. My salmon was served directly from a cedar grilling plank, adding its own aroma to the dining room. My only quibble was that the salmon was a bit drier than I expected for \\"medium rare\\" (the chef's recommendation) but the flavor was everything I hoped for.\\n\\nThe wine list is incomparable, made almost entirely of Oregon and Washington wines. Our meal was complimented by an Argyle Pinot Noir. If you dine here and aren't familiar with the wineries on the list, take a chance and ask your server for recommendations. You'l find some amazing, one-of-a-kind wines, especially in the whites. There is also a three-glass \\"wine flight\\" option available if you'd like to try a variety.\\n\\nEvery time I go, I get the Artist Point Cobbler for dessert, made with seasonal berries and a house-made berry ice cream. This time I took a chance and had \\"Chocolate Indulgence,\\" which may be best shared by two. It was like soft fudge, topped with shaved chocolate, blueberries and sauce, along with a chocolate ice cream scoop. Very rich, but a worthy second place to the cobbler. The dessert wine and cordial list is worth a visit of its own.\\n\\nIt is at Disney, so expect to pay a price premium. The salmon was about $48 but is at the top of the price scale. Appetizers were $9-14; desserts, $10-12."},{"name":"Kneaded Pleasures Cafe & Pizza","address":"3573 Far W Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"Food and deserts are good.

There are a couple Indian carts in Portland that you can get fresh baked naan bread, so this is not the place to get your naan fix.\\n\\nThere is three chicken dishes, mild medium and spicy.  Mild is with cow milk, medium is with curry & coconut, and spicy is red spice and coconut.  You have the option of the curry potatoes, cauliflower curry, or garbanzo.

It also would get another half point if I could list it that way, for the really nice staff and clean and modern interior. But I don't love the food well enough to go to 4 stars. I wish people would stop comparing it to Chipotle. It's a different cuisine and I appreciate that. That's what attracted me to it to start with. I have never been to Brazil or another Brazilian style restaurant. So I'm just judging on what I like and what I've read about Brazililan food.\\n\\nI have been here twice, I will definitely go again, but maybe the sort of place I go to a few times a year. The portions are generous. The \\"regular\\" was much too large for me. The small was plenty. The base is a variable selection and for me, the all rice option was just too heavy. The second time I had a rice and crisp greens base which I would have enjoyed more had the greens not been so coarse, a lot of huge center ribs of romaine. But completely fresh, not a single brown edge. All of the sides choices are put into the bowl and I liked each one. I have had the black beans and the collard greens, and the toppings of farofa, cilantro, and lime. I have had the beef both times and my understanding is that in Brazil it would be char grilled on a spit and this looks and tasted like plain roasted beef. But it was tender, well done meat. A bit of char would have been flavorful. I have had the mango BBQ sauce both times and it was a bit sweet, so I added some hot sauce but still sweet. The other sauce is a curry, which is a spice that disagrees with me so I haven't tried it. I love the pao rolls which are a tapioca starch cheese  dough and I always get two. All of the drinks available, other than water, are also a bit sweet for me. There must be a tart citrus option that would go well.\\n\\nMaybe as this new concept menu evolves they will have some offerings that address my issues. I hope they do.

I hate when a place tries to heat up quiche fast and they just end up cooking the outsides, leaving the center cold. But onto the quiche - I was surprised and impressed that the flavor of all the ingredients were spread throughout the egg mixture evenly. Usually, the flavor of the ingredients are just by themselves alongside the egg, so major props to the quichemaker. :)"},{"name":"Polaris Grill","address":"1835 Polaris Pkwy","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"I've eaten here twice and both times the food and service was great.

I've never had buffalo before but I have to say this dish was amazing. The server recommended having the buffalo cooked medium in order to keep it tender. I'm glad I followed his advice because the meat was almost melt in my mouth tender. I ate every bite, there was no fat to be trimmed away.  Next we moved on to dessert and I've got to say the strawberries and cream was the hands down favorite dessert of the table.

Simple menu: tacos, burritos, quesadilla... Cilantro's is a more traditional taco joint. The tacos are street style. The are topped with cilantro and onion with a side of salsa and fresh lime. In my opinion these are 'proper' tacos. If you are looking for some tacos 'with a twist' or some other highfalutin hipster taco, then keep on marching. \\n\\nWith my first visit I tried the carne asada tacos. They are served in a double shell; corn tortillas and tasted fresh. The asada was good quality. No gristle. It could of used a bit more salt, but what was really impressive is the meat is actually moist and was not over cooked. The quality of the flank steak is superior to most taquerias I've tried in Central Florida.\\n\\nI noticed the burrito comes with lettuce, tomato, sour cream (gasp)... so if you want to get your gringo on, the option is there, but for the most part Cilantro's leans more authentic, than say your Gringos Locos, or Hunger Street Tacos. If you are looking for a more traditional taqueria, then I highly recommend this place. They have lengua if you want to eat like the Romans do! \\n\\nMy only real (minor) complaint is the salsa. I appreciate the complimentary side of fresh salsa. It is high quality, but it has no bite. I need it to be a lot spicier. It would be ideal if they served a red, green and a habanero salsa. They have a plethora of store bought bottled salsas, but I can get those anywhere.\\n\\nThe people behind the counter were friendly. The service is fast. They have a 2 taco/soda special each day for 6$. Otherwise, the tacos are a little on the pricey side. Three tacos and a Mexican Coke will set you back about 13$. But you know what? I've paid a lot more than 13$ at many a trendy, upscale, hipster 'Mexican' establishments in town and have eaten very bland, soulless food, and felt ripped off. I do not mind paying a premium for the more authentic taco you will find at Cilantros. I wish them good fortune and will return again soon to explore more of the menu.\\n\\n**Update 2/25/18 - They've added several types of fresh salsa. Second visit was as good as the first.

I topped it off with chunky tomato vinaigrette, cilantro and a lime wedge. I opted for two of their cheese breads which were .50 each. It was a little pricey for such a small bowl, plus I hate how these places ding you for all the \\"extra\\" sides and such. But I will say, it filled me up and definitely wasn't lacking in flavor.

I love making my own chicken fajitas and I LOVE their salad bar (sadly it seems like nobody really eats their salad bar first, they all just go straight to the main food). But the problem is that the grillers are no longer as fun as they used to be and they don't seem to care as much about properly grilling your food. They would rather try and entertain (and fail at it) than pay attention to your food as it falls onto the floor. I mean, they literally dumped a quarter of my chicken and veggies onto the floor as they were wildly flailing around with their grill sticks and there was no apology, just a \\"oh well you can go back for more later\\" attitude. The problem with that is that I only go for one bowl (reason for eating the salad bar first) and it would cost me more money to go for seconds. The servers have always been kind of lackluster too. Not sure how it is that they are so busy given that they don't even have to serve any actual food to anyone, they only have to keep drinks refilled and make sure you have rice and tortillas if you need them but sometimes they can't even do that right.\\n\\nI still love BD's and I will not stop going there but I do not go as often as I used to because it depresses me to see the decline.

Considering one of the best BBQ places in Atlanta is less than 5 minutes away my rating is based on a comparison. I gave the other one 5 stars. The Cons: the sauces are all quite thin and runny and taste like something from the grocery store. I settled on the mustard based sauce. Anyone can smoke meat but what sets a BBQ place apart is the sauce and seasoning.  Another disappointment is the small sandwich size and the fact that they use store bought white flour buns. The brisket was dry and unseasoned and the pulled chicken is mixed with white and dark meats.  Most BBQ places allow you to designate light or dark. The Pros: the fast service, especially for a Saturday at 4pm.The corn pudding is a treat as well as the collards and cole slaw that is made the old fashioned way without mayonnaise. They have a creamy option too. The fries were a bit under cooked but had a great flavor.  The side items seem to be the best option and they have fresh salads too.  We will give it another try."},{"name":"La Hacienda","address":"900 Monroe Dr NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Holy moly this place was awesome! Hubby and I came here because, thanks to how awesome our La Hacienda is in Collierville, we have a tradition to try a La Hacienda everywhere we go. So far it has worked out well for us. This is just one more proof that this name is blessed among almost authentic Mexican places. \\n\\nThere's parking in the back and both front and back entrances look gorgeous. The entire building, inside and out, looks like it came straight from Mexico. The music, according to hubbs, isn't exactly hacienda style, but it was catchy so we didn't care. The upstairs isn't open until 5, so next time we may try and come here for dinner. \\n\\nWe were about to head back home so we decided to find something we would both enjoy. Hubbs got a margarita and ordered tableside guac and we checked out the menu. It its leather-bound, which looks awesome. The only issue is that it sometimes covered up part of the menu. You can easily lift it up to see what's underneath if you need to. It took us a minute but we were tempted by the amazing picture they have of the Burrito Hacienda, so we went with that. I wasn't sure if I'd like it, as I usually am not that fond of pork, but I knew hubbs would like it. \\n\\nThe tableside guac was delish but it honestly wasn't worth the $10. Usually, when you get guac made at your table, the waiter does a little show, talks to you about the process, and has extras you can add. I'm not sure if maybe it was because we were there during an unusual hour (2-3) or if it's just something they don't do. It was as good as anywhere else but with the extra cost we were hoping for a little more than that. Of course, we may have been spoiled by other places. \\n\\nThe Burrito Hacienda was perfect. It was filled with delicate marinated, shredded pork that melted in your mouth. Its plating was aesthetically pleasing, which is part of what made us pick it originally. Looking at my own picture makes me want to eat it again! The pico and avocado on top was a nice touch as usually burritos like that just come with cheese or the salsa verde. It had both but neither overwhelmed the dish. Hubby and I split it in half along with the sides. I kept asking hubby why their beans tasted better than most I had eaten and he wasn't sure why, either. \\n\\nAll in all, this place was amazing. We will definitely come back if we are in the area again. \\n\\nLoved: \\n- Arroz\\n- Burrito Hacienda\\n- Frijoles\\n- Guacamole\\n- Roasted Salsa\\n- Salsa Roja\\n\\nDisliked: \\n- Tamarindo Margarita"},{"name":"Vanbarry's Public House","address":"4120 S Orange Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"This is actually my second trip here.

You had to ask for butter and juice (they said juice was included but didn't put it out and didn't come around with it). It was obvious that Disney was trying to save some money at this buffet by putting almost nothing out. Even the pancakes they did put out were sweet potato pancakes!

The crowd is sophisticated, older and stylish.  The flooring is concrete with cube like tables and an upstairs with more cube tables.  There is plenty of room here to work and sip your java.  There is even outdoor seating if you can take the Texas weather.  My favorite spot is the leather red couch near the front door.

Edward was my barista and I asked for a sweeter coffee drink on ice so he made me what he called the Toddy S.S.  It was coffee made with vanilla and it was a delight.

The quality at Medici is what I noticed the most about this place.  \\n\\nThe Austonian Medici location also has a small piano where a local Austin composer plays on Thursdays.

Soon after her manager comes out and says they can't honor the coupon because the online ordering system is different than the store system. When I tell him the only reason I come here is to use the coupon and that they advertise heavily that you can order online (it's on the front of the store and several table tents), he tells me I should have come in and ordered or called instead.

A good menu with lots of fun-sounding pizza toppings. I have not been to the place, so I can not speak for decor or in-restaurant service. I ordered a pizza delivery from work.\\n\\nI will never order from them again.\\n\\nThe pizza was ok, but the service was awful (and I'm really not a stickler for service...) I ordered a 'Wanna-be' Shi-shi pizza. I had the option of making it green or red (as in pesto or tomato sauce). I was in a VERY green mood, so i went for the pesto. A large part of why I got this pizza was for the... oh, my good ness... I just looked at their new menu online and this misunderstanding might not have been entirely their fault. Well, still giving them the same rating.\\n\\nNow to continue with the story... I just figured out that I had an old menu... the old menu (which given my source, really could not have been very old and the website says 'new menu' and it's been well over a month, so who knows...) said the pizza had arugula on it, it apparently doesn't anymore, but when it showed up without arugula, I was really disappointed. Also, the other ingredients which could have made up for the lack of leafy greens were not very generously used. There was almost no basil to speak of.\\n\\nThen when I called Bill's and tried to complain, nobody could understand what I was saying AT ALL. I spoke with one women, she was really confused, and then I got passed without warning to another woman, who started to list ingredients that were clearly for a sandwich. \\"Ma'am. I ordered a PIZZA, not a sandwich.\\"\\n\\nAfter a lot of deliberation, I was told they were 'out of arugula' and I could ask for some extra next time I ordered from them. To which I said, 'Please, in the future, let customers know if you don't have all the ingredients for what they ordered, BEFORE you give it to them.' and something about there not going to be a next time, which there won't be.\\n\\nThat was a bit of a rant, but I'm going to have to agree with someone else who stated that Bill's 'takes their customers for granted.' Now, given that there may have been a menu change that took the arugula off my pizza, this all seems a bit silly, but it really wasn't just me:\\n\\nA. Shouldn't they know that there's been some recent changes to their menu and not just tell me they're out of arugula??\\n\\nB.

Bottom line is it is OK-good food, a little pricey, but given the WW's accolades, I expected more.  In general, there seemed to be a dependence on spicing up most of the dishes that robbed the food of the flavor of the ingredients, and instead substituted the taste of spice (Raddichio salad, Banh Mi are examples).  The other big thing was the vibe: the place was a little cold, and worse, was playing Pandora's Hall & Oates channel (I asked).  I am no hipster, but c'mon, is Phil Collins' \\"That's' All\\" really a representative song for your target demographic?  I would like to see this place improve so that it can become another dining option for us.\\n\\nWe had:\\nred miso soup: good, especially given the fact it was a cold day.  Citrus-spice side was inventive and tasty. \\n\\nOyster Shooters: Interesting idea with the asian treatment, but the after taste was way-fishy.  Most people enjoy oysters for the cool taste of the sea, not for an overly fishy experience.  Either it was the sauce or... the oysters.  Latter thought makes me cringe.\\n \\nRaddichio salad: OK.

The White Dragon Roll had a lot going on but definitely could've used a little less sauce; I personally liked the Spicy Yellow Tail Roll, simple enough but flavorful.

Now when someone says anywhere, I assume that it means anywhere. Well, maybe not with other patrons, although I am not ever ruling that out, it can be fun. So we select a lovely table by the bar, adjacent to the open wall. Perfect on a warm evening. Well then one of the clones informed us that we were not to sit there as it was reserved for dining guests only. And she shamed us right there in front of other guests. Poor form! \\n\\nSo we moved to the chairs surrounding the fireplace. Then we were bombarded by clones who kept asking us if we had decided. Pushy. I hate that.

When she returned again and took our order, Margaritas on the rocks, my date told her that we move dutifully. She said yes we reserve the table for diners. He quipped that he could fully understand why, given that it was late on a Sunday night and there were surely droves of patrons just waiting to come in for dinner.

My girlfriend and I were thirsty and it was a bit frustrating as I have stated earlier, we didn't get any bottles of water that we were supposed to get with the resort fee that I paid. We thought it was a joke so we went to another floor and it was a similar scene. We went down to the shop at pool level and it was closed. At that point we just head back to bed as it was late and didn't want to bother with it any longer."},{"name":"The Busy Bee Cafe","address":"810 Martin Luther King Jr Dr SW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Might just be the best fried chicken in Atlanta!!

Waited about 30 mins for the food...which wasn't bad compared to the people waiting 2 hours for tables.

I ate my order maybe 3 hours later and the chicken was still CRUNCHY!! Not soggy at all. And filled with so much flavor. I got a breast & a wing and they were both super juicy and seasoned just like your Grandma's homemade chicken.  The mac & cheese was pretty good. I'm sure it's better warm. The greens and the yams were superb. Definitely taste like my Grandma's!!! The green were tender, cooked just right, seasoned, just plain good. The yams had just the right amount of sweetness.  Didn't even get to the dinner roll.  The sweet tea was really good too!!\\n\\n* Almost forgot, the banana pudding was great!!! Homemade just like on Thanksgiving.

As Oscar Wilde once said, \\"I can resist everything but temptation.\\" Sigh.\\n\\nHowever, last night my friend and I stopped into Mojo with the actual plan of getting drinks. It was happy hour, and mojitos were five bucks - so seeing as I haven't had a mojito in god knows how long, I decided to take the plunge. We sat at a high top table in the middle of the (awkwardly well-lit, imho) bar, and waited for table service. This did not happen, even though the bartenders looked over at us a couple times, so I finally ventured over to the bar to obtain said mojito and my friend's rum+coke. As soon as I did so, the server rushed over to our table and asked my friend if he wanted to order food. WTF? FTW! \\n\\nAnyway, bar service was reallllllllllly slow - but the bartenders were nice. It was stoner slow, and I have nothing against that, but maybe if it wasn't so well lit I would feel more comfortable with the *nods* \\"duuuuuuuude\\" vibe. However, the mojito the bartender made me was excellent. And also five dollars. Which isn't like the best deal in the world, but I suppose it's better than seven or eight dollars.\\n\\nAfter some nice convo, we decided it was time for another drink. Again, I went to the bar, and again, the waitress swooped in on my friend and asked him if he wanted to order food. So weird. The bartender spent a very long time making three mojitos before he made my friend's rum+coke, which was also weird. We finished our second round and gave up. I don't know what think, really.

Love dim sum, but avoid going because of the unpredictability of the wait for a table, the wait for carts to come by with things the kids will deign to eat, and the wait while trying to flag down a waiter for the check while your kids are whining about wanting to leave?  Well, you're in luck - Get Sum Dim Sum is here to save you.\\n\\nGet Sum Dim Sum serves very decent dim sum in a setting that works for parents of little, wiggly kids.  You walk in, grab a table (pretty much always available), sit down with the menu, enter into extensive negotiations re what to order with the family, write the settlement down on the order sheet, and while one parent entertains the kids, the other goes to the counter to order.  By the time the ordering parent has grabbed chopsticks, drinks, soy sauce, vinegar, hot chili oil and napkins from the self-service counter, dishes are already arriving at your table.  Then you eat.  Mmm.  When you are done, you just leave - no bill to wait for - you've already paid!\\n\\nI'd dwell more on the food, but it really isn't necessary - you can read the other 45+ and counting Yelp reviews for that.  Bottom line for me is that it is quite good - not Hong Kong, San Francisco, or Toronto good - but as good as any other place in Austin.  Twelve years ago, that would have been damning with faint praise, but given the happy current state of affairs, that's really not bad.\\n\\nThanks, Get Sum Dim Sum, for making good dim sum kid-friendly.

The pecan pie was very bad; it had a very thick buttery custard filling with some chopped pecans on top.

The chocolate silk tort is awesome however! Plenty of better places around Austin.\\n\\nFood (6/10)\\n\\n(7/10) Crispy Oysters (Appetizer)\\nCrispy Gulf Oysters served with chipotle tartar sauce, green goddess, and a pico de gallo garnish. This specialty of Ranch 616, has been named the \\"Best Oysters of the South\\" by Southern Magazine and received numerous rave reviews on other websites. With all this hype, we had no choice but to give it a try.  The order came with a dozen pieces about the size of a small shrimp so it is enough for a couple of people to experience. The fried batter of the oysters were delicious and the inside was juicy and had a mushy texture. If you are scared to try raw oysters, this might be a good place to start! We did like it, but feel it did not live up to all the hype. The two sauces were equally delicious.\\n\\n(6/10) Camerones Rellenos (Appetizer)\\nApple Wood smoked bacon wrapped shrimp, stuffed with cilantro and serrano jack cheese. This is an appetizer we have not come across very often and decided to give it a try. This dish matches its yummy sounding description. The bacon was soft, tender, and flavorful. However, it was not overpowering and we could still taste the shrimp. We could barely taste the cheese, perhaps it was just for texture? Now the bad....As you will notice from the picture, this appetizer came with a paltry 4 pieces of shrimp and the presentation was sub-par. There was much more salad garnish than shrimp and the pieces were poorly placed on the plate. That may sound nit-picky but since the flavor was less than inspiring, we thought presentation might help a bit. We would not spend over $8 for this tiny appetizer.\\n\\n(6/10) Tenderloin 616\\nYour choice of ancho honey glazed Pork Tenderloin or Beef \\"Petite\\" Tender, served with roasted poblano mashed potatoes, topped roasted corn and portabella mushrooms. We chose the beef option, but do not let the word \\"petite\\" scare you away. The pieces were sliced in small pieces but there was plenty of them. The beef was very tender and not fatty. The flavor was light and subtle, but good. The mashed potatoes were creamy and complemented the beef well, but the mushrooms seemed out of place. The presentation of this dish is scary, but luckily the restaurant is dim. Overall, this dish was decent but we've had better tenderloins around Austin.\\n\\n(5/10) Tilapia Tiger\\nA cilantro basil pesto baked fillet of Tilapia topped with pineapple pico, served over poblano mashers with four crispy Tiger Shrimp and a saut√©ed vegetables. With our tummies growling, we wasted no time digging into this dish. We took our first bite and thought to ourselves, \\"What an interesting texture of fish....it feels and tastes like potatoes.\\" Well, we realized that the fillet of fish is sitting on top of the mashed potatoes. For an $18 dish, we figured they would want to keep it separate so people can enjoy the succulent flavors. However, this all made sense after we carefully separated a piece of fish and tried it by itself. It had NO flavor whatsoever and they tried to cover it up by making you eat the potatoes with it! But seriously, the fish was one of the most bland we've ever had but the fried shrimp and sauce that accompanied it was excellent. We wish the entire dish was just shrimp. We caution you to stay away from this one.\\n\\n(5/10) Ghiradelli Chocolate and Pecan Brownie\\nA Ghiradelli chocolate brownie with Texas pecans served warm with a scoop of Mexican Vanilla ice cream and chocolate sauce. As you know from our other reviews, we love chocolate. Our waitress informed us that that this is the most chocolaty and rich dessert on the menu so we couldn't pass it up, especially when we saw the \\"Ghiradelli.\\" When we first laid our eyes on this massive brownie, our mouths began to water and we eagerly tried a bite-full. You know the saying that looks can be deceiving? Well...in this case they were absolutely right. The top layer of the brownie was hard and crispy and the inside was dry. There was no fudgyness or ooey-gooeyness that makes a brownie heavenly. This was not a restaurant caliber brownie and in fact, HEB has much better ones - really!\\n\\n(9/10) Chocolate Silk Tort\\nA very rich and dense flour-less tort made with Callebaut chocolate in a pecan praline crust, finished with whipped cream and chocolate sauce. It is a shame that we had to wait this long, but alas - a dish worth raving about. They were not kidding when they said very rich and dense. This is easily the most dense chocolate we've had. In fact it was a struggle to cut a piece without the fear of flinging it across the room. It was so rich that you'll get cavities while savoring the chocolate melting in your mouth. We promise you'll be in heaven when you eat this chocolate delight. This is one of the rare times that serving a small portion is actually a good thing.

Would stay here again.\\n\\nWe stayed here for 5 nights and were first greeted by the most polite and enthusiastic staff member at the front desk, Stephen Rosa. He was very courteous, funny, and helpful. He let us check in early (checkin 4pm, checkout 11am) even though we arrived around 1pm. He helped us plan our itinerary; he let us know about Quick Queue passes and transportation (both complimentary and public) to parks and nearby areas, helped us budget our time, suggested which day to visit which park, etc. I'm sad I didn't get to see him when we checked out to let him know what a wonderful time we had during our stay, thanks to him. \\n\\nAt check-in, we received complimentary glasses of sparkling wine. Our fairly spacious room had the view of the hotel parking lot, the hotel's pool and outdoor hot tubs, and SeaWorld. There was a mini fridge, a security vault, hairdryer, and coffee maker. It seemed pretty standard (If you've been to Atlantic City in NJ, the hotel was comparable to those of Harrah's, Caesars, Bally's, Showboat, etc). However, the bathroom lacked a vanity mirror. \\n\\nSeaWorld was within walking distance, a short five minute walk across SeaWorld's parking lot. There were free shuttles to Discovery Cove, Aquatica, and Busch Gardens in front of SeaWorld at the bus station. Right outside of the hotel, there are two bus/tram stops which can take you anywhere. The bus was $2 each way (you can ask the front desk for a bus schedule). I don't frequent public transportation, so let me tell you now before you make the mistake we did: bring exact change or acquire it from Starbucks (inside the hotel). We used this bus to visit downtown Disney (a quick 15 minute ride). \\n\\nWe ate a buffet dinner inside this hotel, which was reasonable ($18/pp). The rest of the food options inside the hotel was a little too pricey for our fresh-out-of-college wallets, but looked good. \\n\\nWe spent a couple evenings relaxing in the hotel's outdoor hot tubs, pool, and table tennis tables. They even had two water slides and a kid's water play area. \\n\\nOverall, our stay went well and we would stay here again. \\n\\nHowever, check your bill before you check out. We were charged on the first night for two waters ($6), which we didn't use. It didn't even make sense because the maids didn't come in to tidy up our room the first night! We got the charge taken off our bill before checking out. It's only $6, but really? For something we didn't use and on a day no one serviced our room? After reading other yelp reviews, it could have been a little more ridiculous if they charged us a parking fee (we flew in, hah), but they didn't. :) This little mishap did sour my review of this hotel, but Stephen Rosas really made our trip.

Let me explain.\\n\\nWe had tried twice to go here previously on a weekend morning and, after waiting 45 minutes, decided to go elsewhere before we starved to death. Third time was a semi-charm. I don't know how you actually get a table inside, maybe through bribery, but at least there was a patio heater above our table hot enough to burn our hair and keep our food hot. The menu is really good, with a great breakfast selection that made it difficult to decide. The food, when it eventually arrived, was delicious and well-portioned, at reasonable prices. The coffee was problematic.\\n\\nApparently, Tin Shed is one of those places that has unspoken rules and expectations of its customers, such as: get your own damn coffee. Problem was, the coffee station on the patio was constantly empty of coffee and clean mugs. I think it's cool that people waiting for a table can just walk in, grab a mug, and get some joe while they wait, but I feel like there should be a priority for actual sitting and paying customers. Or at least the wait staff should be checking to see if it needs maintenance. But when we finally did get coffee, it was good. \\n\\nSo, why do I still only give Tin Shed 3 stars? The people. Wait staff and other customers. I don't go somewhere to \\"be seen,\\" I want good food and good service. And apparently, Tin Shed is so fucking cool, their wait staff can treat you like you're a charity case. Our waiter was inattentive and never came back to check on us.

That Thursday was today.\\n\\nYou will have to be quick when you turn off the interstate or you will drive right by it.  The outside and the inside are utilitarian with nothing spent on feel good visuals.  To do that and be in business for over 100 years you must have good products.  The meat cases are not packed, but I imagine they have stuff in the back and bring it out as needed.\\n\\nI got a couple of punds of the double smoked bacon, some pastrami, some capicolla, and some hot souse.  I got a sample of the souse while I was in there as I was a souse newb.  Nice flavor, solid heat at the beginning and I still had some heat on my tongue when I got home almost 20 minutes later. The smell from the bag was soo good that I had to open the pastrami on 270 on the way home and sample some.  Then when I got home to drop the meat off I had just enought time to make a capicolla sandwich and head back to work.\\n\\nI give the meats I tried a 5 across the board.  Quality throughout.  So many more varieties to try in the future too!  Dinner tonight? BLT's.

The burritos are good, falling somewhere close to El Pelon's (R.I.P. - for now) monsters in size, but slightly behind in flavor and texture; Romano's are a bit dry for my taste.

Much like a strip club, I frequent this venue and hate myself every time.\\n\\nThe biggest reason PCDR is deserving of Yelp's lowest possible rating is their service. Our complaints started well before Patty even opened her doors. As occasional patrons of the Pu Pu Hotpot (R.I.P) we had mixed feelings to see a going-out-of-business/coming-soon sign partially advertising the loss of a central square comedy staple. So after waiting over a month for the Dumpling Room to get its shit together and open its doors we decided to call ahead and find out when they'd finally be serving.  They claimed it'd be open in 2 days but in actually it took about 2 more weeks.\\n\\nPatty decided to open her dumpling room on the day of the Cambridge Dumpling Festival. Awesome marketing idea...assuming that you are actually going to have food to serve. Half an hour after dumpling fest started, we headed to the newly open PCDR to see what they had to offer. Turns out, nothing! None of their food was going to be ready for half an hour! How does the Asgard Irish Pub across the street have dumplings out for dumpling fest but the dumpling room not?! On top of that, the dumplings that the Asgard served us that day were BETTER than the ones that the PCDR serves daily.\\n\\nThe first time we tried to sit down and eat at the restaurant we were on schedule, but we had 40 minutes before we had to leave. There was only 1 other group in the restaurant so we figured service would be relatively snappy. The host/server/only-employee-in-sight sat us immediately and then proceeded to promptly call his college buddy. After 15 minutes of listening to our server describe his weekend plans over the phone we still had not received water, let alone had our orders taken. Needless to say, we left and got falafel.\\n\\nAfter getting ignored in person we decided maybe ordering online was the way to go. We placed our order for pickup on foodler and waited until it was supposed to be ready. When we showed up at Patty's and asked the dude at the register about our food he let us in on a secret. Apparently they had set up their foodler account, but they weren't processing the orders! After starving ourselves for 40 minutes in anticipation of finally getting to eat dumplings we were informed that Mrs. Chen completely ignored our order and we'd have to start all over again in person if we wanted to eat.\\n\\nThis one time, we were driving back from NH and called them on the way. They said our order would take 40 minutes. WTF? 40 minutes? Good thing we called early. We arrived at the Dumpling Room 45 minutes after calling and were told that our order would be out shortly. We then had to wait another half an hour while they put together our order! There were 3 other angry customers also waiting. Luckily there was this waitress that was easy on the eyes to keep us entertained while we waited.\\n\\nThe contents of the take-out bags have always been a surprise. We once ordered over 50 dumplings and were given only TWO pairs of chop sticks. Now, don't get me wrong, we eat a lot of food, but TWO pairs of chop sticks? They also can't seem to make up their mind on the dumpling sauce. Sometimes there is none, sometimes they charge you for it (not cool), and other times there is just hot sauce (how the hell do you not give us dumpling sauce with our dumplings and call yourselves a legitimate dumpling establishment?).\\n\\nTLDR: it sucks, but so does riding the redline to Chinatown"},{"name":"Friendly Confines","address":"7025 County Rd 46A, Ste 1001","city":"Lake Mary","stars":"3","text":"Good solid bar food with a friendly staff.

After being aggressive shooed away by the security for just trying to understand the situation, one security guard stepped aside to talk to us. We could not have been more composed and mild mannered, but he informed us that none of us would be allowed to go into the bar that night.  We honestly didn't want to be in the bar that badly, we just wanted to say goodbye to our friend. After being denied from the bar with absolutely no explanation, we went to the other side of the bar and said goodbye to our friend through the fence before we left. When we were on the sidewalk outside the bar(public property?) we were again confronted by two security guards who insisted that we leave. After explaining to them that we were just saying bye to our friend, they apologized and let us go.

I think the overall portion size is generous, but the ratio could be tweaked a bit. Noodle portion was a bit skimpy on one visit, whereas the rice/quinoa on another visit was just right. So maybe they are still adjusting a few things. I love having a healthy option that is still delicious and not the same old same old.

I had a taste of his rice and you could tell it had been cooked on a hibachi grill, which gave it a wonderful flavor. \\n\\nThe shrimp tempura and tempura veggies were outstanding. The batter was light and crispy, not caked on or heavy and did not over power the delicate flavors inside. The choices of vegetables was refreshing, I had never had tempura eggplant or sweet potato, both were delicious. The bento box also came with a choice of soup or salad, I got the miso soup a it was a cold night and I love miso soup in the winter time. And then there was a spring roll (unique and also quite tasty), and 4 pieces of a crab roll. Like I said, a good bit of food to be sure. The only tiny tiny complaint I have is the use of cucumber in the crab roll, this seems to be a trend in all \\"normal\\" rolls now in many sushi places.

The ambiance is contemporary and somewhat trendy, way better than other chain restaurants like TGIF, Chili's, etc. In terms of the classiness of the decor, it's on par with Cheesecake Factory but with less frou-frou. I really liked \\"West Coast Prawn Salad with Citrus Honey Vinaigrette\\" which contains prawns, quinoa, and avocado. So healthy and tasty!! And their spicy shrimp pasta too was pretty good for what it is,  but the salad was definitely better. I think people should stop judging chain restaurants.

I assumed that it was just a mistake, since I used to get a 12 inch pizza under the \\"small\\" heading, or that they'd just added a smaller size.  After eating there again last night, however, I realized that they've changed their menu.  Instead of having a 12 inch small and a large that was probably 15 inches, they now have a 9 inch, a 15 and an 18 inch \\"extra large.\\"\\n\\nOkay, here's the thing.  A nine inch pizza is too small.  I'm fully aware that I should eat less, but it just isn't enough food for one person (at least not an adult, American, pizza-loving male who isn't counting calories).  Their \\"large\\" pizza, the 15 inch, is way too big for one person (as evidenced by the leftover pizza currently in my fridge).\\n\\nI know this seems like a small gripe (and that some people are probably all for the change), but their 12 inch barbecue chicken (or occasionally chicken and broccoli) pizza was perfect and now I either have to find someone to share with, or end up feeling unsatisfied.

We both prefer the charro beans. Jose Pollo is a dish my husband discovered and now it's become a fave of mine too. It's a delicious grilled chicken breast topped w/mushrooms,bell peppers,onions and monterrey jack cheese and it comes with beans and rice. The third dish I love is their Spinach Enchiladas and I like to add chicken fajita meat inside for some protein. Other customers used to rave about them when we would sit at the bar and I finally got up the courage to leave my comfort zone and try them! They are as amazing as everyone said. We eat at Flores without fail at least 1/week and know several of the staff by name. I love their mexican martini's but beware they are POTENT!

Board games copious.\\n- Baby quotient significantly higher than the average brewery. Lots of toddlers running around, kids on tricycles, a few dogs here and there (there were 2 very sweet and well-behaved Goldens there during our visit). \\n- Can be crowded; seating not guaranteed - if you don't mind finding a corner to stand in for a bit until seats open up, then you're good.\\n- They have tasty Slumbrew beer on tap, served in plastic cups. Selection varies: be flexible about your options in order to have the best time. Current Slumbrew options are available in 4-pack cans for purchase, too.\\n- Very, very casual. Very casual. Did I say casual? Like a bar in someone's backyard. Service is on par with the atmosphere. If you go with that in mind, you'll have a good time.\\n\\nWhat this place isn't:\\n- A reserved-seating, table-service place that can guarantee a certain experience for you and your group. Don't like little kids running around, dogs, or a super-casual atmosphere? This probably isn't the place for you.\\n- A traditional bar. You can run a credit card tab, but still need to go stand in line again to order every round.\\n- A restaurant. Don't come here to eat, come here to drink. The food is overpriced, microwaved, and not good. If you need a bar snack, that's one thing, but this isn't the place to go for a meal.\\n\\nPersonally, I had a great time and really enjoyed this place. The casual, friendly atmosphere made it feel more like a traditional British pub than an American bar, but with cold IPA's, sunshine, and Connect Four instead of warm ale, wood paneling, and darts.

Oh is that pint glass full of truffle shoe-string fries mine?  And that homemade (slightly spicy) ketchup?  Why yes, yes they are and if you like fries in any capacity (and honestly, who doesn't?) you'll flip for these lightly truffled delights...

They were stuffed with chicken and some other stuff (I was realllllly hungry so I wolfed it down quickly, failing to notice most of the ingredients). The crust was nice and crunchy and drizzled with sour cream, and my portion was a very good size. It came with guacamole and pico de gallo. Good shit!\\n\\nThe snake bites are basically jalepeno poppers. Not the best I must say. They would be awesome if it wasn't for two things: 1.) It came with \\"citrus sour cream\\", which did not compliment anything about the poppers. Regular sour cream would've been just fine. 2.) Instead of the standard breading (which the peppers are covered in, then deep fried) they used cornmeal. Cornmeal?? Really? You're fucking kidding me. It was not good. Not good at all. Sucks too because the peppers were just right, good size and very spicy, and the cheese was really good too. They really ought to change that.\\n\\nOverall though, I did like the food and drinks, and will probably come back again.

Treat your Feet and Manilla Mart are also in this same plaza. There's limited parking out front but a lot to one side.\\n\\nI've been going to the \\"other\\" \\"Cafe\\" Mozart Bakery for many years, the one inside the perimeter next to Hello Chicken and Sinaloense Pollo Asados. It seemed strange to me that there would be two so close together but apparently one is privately owned and this one further north is part of a franchise - from the website there appears to be several locations around Atlanta and in Dallas.\\n\\nI first entered this newer location shortly after opening so the photos reflect the new space. On the night I visited with my wife there were few customers (granted it was close to their closing time and they hadn't yet had their grand opening). My first impression of the space was \\"beautiful\\" - it has a loft/industrial feel with painted concrete floors, rich finishes and some fantastic slab-walnut tables. The bakery is extremely stylish with clean lines and well thought out spaces. It's well list and well stocked with plenty of Asian-inspired pastries and breads, both savory and/or sweet in beautiful packaging - much like you would find in the nearby White Windmill and former Maum Bakeries.\\n\\nI love Asian bakeries - maybe because I'm Asian?  Well, actually it's because they tend to have less sugar which works better for my taste preferences. While there's much to be said for sugar and there are some fantastic bakeries around (Alon's comes to mind), most of the Americanized Euro-bakeries seem much too sweet to me. I don't know how people can eat that stuff all the time - even the non-sourdough breads seem slightly sweet. Asian bakeries, on the other hand, seem to have many more savory options and the sweet baked goods are sweet but not over-the-top death-by-sugar confections.\\n\\nOn this night we hit this new Cafe Mozart after enjoying Korean Tofu pots at Cho Dang across the street and noticing the sign. We were more curious than hungry but still managed to speak to the staff and split a coffee and a single almond dessert. The staff were quite kind and accommodating and answered all our questions. I've since dropped in a couple of more times - the service is efficient and very business-like, the baked items I've tried very good and the place kept immaculate.

I really like the food and love to bring friends here. I sometimes get reservations and other times just fight for a bar table. I have yet to have something here that I don't like.

Hand made mixers and great cocktails. Great off beat selection of wines and liquor. Now this place is not cheap, cocktails are $12 each and a couple can easily spend $100 before tip but that's OK and I have never had a bad dining experience. Wait staff if great! \\n\\nOK now for the annoying part. The Hostesses are flat out rude. Not just when it is busy (which is understood) but when it is dead too!

Why didn't the hostess tell us that when we asked her? Why did we have to wait at a table to be told by our server? So instead of just leaving, I unwillingly decided to stay for dinner. I didn't like the idea of sitting at a table for 20 minutes or so and then getting up to leave so I stayed. BLEH.\\n\\nOn the upside, the service was good and so was the food. I had their clam chowder mashed potatoes with scallops. The potatoes really did taste like clam chowder (very rich too) and the scallops were sweet and tasted like glazed ham (probably from all the ham that was in the dish). Tried their Roscoe's silver dollar sandwich because I've been to Roscoe's in LA many times in the past and was excited to see a fried chicken and waffle sandwich on the menu. Unfortunately, the waffle wasn't all that great. It was soft, no crunchy outside and it was drenched in syrup. The chicken was a little better but didn't have that fried chicken taste that I was after.\\n\\nAt least they serve mint juleps in the metal julep cups with crushed ice! Take that, Miss Delta!\\n\\nTheir dessert menu had coconut cake that I was aching to try but didn't because at the time, I had a slice of coconut cake from Otto and Anita's waiting for me in the fridge at home so instead I had their ice cream sundae with everything in it. \\n\\nAnd lastly, to top it all off, instead of being given after dinner mints or whatever after receiving the bill, we were given each a more than generous spoonful of thick and decadent house made chocolate ganache. It was super rich and super creamy and I took a teeny taste and called it a night.

I've tried their Bacon and Pulled Pork Poutine and their Crispy Chicken Frites. The food was fresh, piping-hot and flavourful. I did find their regular size to be a bit on the smaller side and not quite large enough for a meal. However, they do give a generous amount of topping, and I think that it is still pretty good value for the price. I highly recommend visiting this place.\\n\\nBacon and Pulled Pork Poutine (Regular Size, $8.99):\\n3.5/5\\nThis came with a very generous amount of topping: there was a good heap of pulled pork and bacon bits. The pulled pork was sufficiently tender and juicy. It was more on the savoury side, and I personally prefer to have a bit of sweetness in my pulled pork. The bacon was smoky and had a good salty flavour. Now, I don't know if it's true, but I heard that authentic cheese curds aren't supposed to melt, and theirs did, but seriously I couldn't care less, I enjoyed the cheese. The fries were thick and flavourful. I do feel that they did use a bit too much gravy however, and the fries on the bottom got quite soggy.\\n\\nCrispy Chicken Fries (Regular Size, $8.99):\\n4/5\\nThis consisted of pieces of fried chicken and your choice of sauce: I picked their peanut satay, which was creamy and sweet, with a slight bit of heat; I did find the peanut flavour to be a tad weak however. Once again, there was a generous amount of topping. The chicken was tender and flavourful, although the batter did understandably get a bit soggy from the sauce.

The chicken was overcooked a little bit. And there was so much juice in the tacos that it made the soft tortilla shells soggy VERY quickly. I had to eat my TACOS with a knife and fork.

They make you pay for wifi, the rooms aren't all that big, and some of the gimmickry (tv's in the bathroom mirrors for example) are a bit Kitsch. If you're at a conference, be prepared to be shut off from the world. They will charge you $100 to access the hotel's wifi network.\\n\\nThat said, the hotel is generally very nice and I like some of their schtick. The duck thing is a lot of fun, and I very much enjoy speaking with and watching the duckmaster. They must be good to their employees as well, since we are always waited on by the same bellhops, the duckmaster has been the same every time, and I even recognize their desk staff (I come up twice a year). Overall, it's great, but ti's nothing to write home about. If you're looking for luxury, I'd pay a bit more and stay at one of the suites in the Omni. But if you want something that isn't waifish like a Holiday Inn, and affordable enough as well as comfortable, I highly recommend the Peabody.

Today I am enjoying, as I have on multiple occasions, their cappuccino and one of their blueberry oatmeal jars.\\n\\nI love their mindset on the community.  Credo did not start as a coffee shop, I don't think, but instead as an idea that a business should be involved in their community as much as possible.  For that reason, they host workshops, they have rentable spaces, and find other ways to be involved in the community.  Check out their site for more info, downtowncredo.com.  They are awesome.\\n\\nFinally, their transaction model is quite unique.  They believe in building a connection/relationship with the customer to the barista and as a result they remove the 'transactional feeling' from their business.

They were clearly pulled from another dish. And it being Saturday evening- that is a DISGUSTING thought. \\n\\nThe real loser of the meal was the margherita pizza. Size and initial glance of ingredients made me think it looked great. Then I noticed a green sludge sauce at a few corners of the pizza. No matter, I figured, so I took a different piece and took a bite. \\n\\nIt was (again) nauseatingly mushy, and the taste reminded me of egg salad. There was a THICK layer of green tinted mayonnaise coating the entire flatbread under the cheese. The entire thing went in the trash. It was easily the grossest thing I have ever eaten. \\n\\nI understand a restaurant trying to put a spin on dishes- but mayonnaise?!? And no, that was not listed in the menu's description. \\n\\nAbove all, the pita bread that had clearly been removed from another dish is what killed this place for me.

For anyone who is unfamiliar on hot pot, here's a quick description.. You choose your option of 4-5 broth's, ranging from chicken to super spicy.. There's a menu that let's you select from, such as seafoods, meats, veggies, etc.. The broth is then brought out to your table and set upon a hot surface in the center of your table to bring it to a boil.. Then your food selection is brought out and what you do is pretty much cook your food in the boiling broth and then eat up.. My family has been eating hot pot at home way before hot pot restaurants as been around but I do enjoy dining here because there's already a variety of foods at your convenience.. The only thing I dis-like about this place is the service.. It seems like every time you ask for an additional menu to order additional food they seem to have this body language as if your making them work to hard..

The dates were caramelized and the cheese/bacon combo works perfectly; I'll definitely try to recreate these at home. \\n\\nMy Mac The Knife had smoked gouda, mac & cheese and bacon.

The beef taco was shredded beef inside a deep fried tortilla rolled up! I believe those are called taquitos. Aside from that there was barely even any meat inside of it.

If they just put 2 more pieces of the \\"beef taco\\" and eliminated the coleslaw and fries, it might have been a better deal considering the price - $6.20!  The coleslaw tasted like shredded cabbage with thousand island dressing on it. The chicken turnover was a little tiny turnover encrusted with some bland tasting chicken, if there was even any chicken in it. It was served with the same salsa they served with the chips. My dish cost $6.99! \\n\\nLet's just say that for $6 - 7 for a dish, I should at least be filled.

Seven Fifty Three South aims to be a kind of neighborhood bistro, which would be a fine addition to the mix of restaurants in Rozzie Square.\\n\\nI'll start with the good. Servers are friendly, the setting is comfortable and aesthetically pleasant and there's a vibe that says, \\"We want you to like us.\\" It's fall and they have two rose wines on the menu. (For a short wine list, it is moderately interesting.)\\n\\nAnd now for the not-great. The specialty cocktails are fine conceptually, but lack balance and finesse. The food is just okay. My Cuban sandwich was dry and lacked distinction. The calamari was pub quality, My dining companions said their food was also alright but uninspiring. This is just a side note, not a major criticism, but they have two Mexican-inspired items that are made with  flour tortillas instead of corn. I never understand why restaurants do this. It's not authentic, it's less healthy than traditional corn tortillas and it cuts out substantial number of diners who avoid gluten. I avoid white flour so it cuts me out too, and I love Mexican food.\\n\\nI seem to be in the minority as other reviewers seem to love the place, so maybe 753 South should just keep doing what it's doing.

Not sure if the restaurant ran out of what they needed for Thai spring rolls, but it wasn't great to have a surprise appetizer that I could not consume.

No, on Yelp, a 5-star restaurant does not have to be high end, expensive, or elite in any way.  Dives can be 5 stars - if they do better than any other dive around.\\n\\nThe Tin Shed definitely isn't a dive.  And it's not Paley's, either.  But boy, for a neighborhood restaurant, it really is as good as it gets.  I moved to the neighborhood shortly before the Tin Shed did, so was very excited to see it open.  Since that time, I've been a regular (or was until I moved to SE PDX last year).  For years I ate there several times a month - up to a couple of times a week.  It was consistent, friendly, creative, and always great.  While I was willing to wait in the lines, it always surprised me that others would do it as well (this was MY neighborhood restaurant, after all - who are these other people?)\\n\\nOver the years, my menu selections have narrowed.  Gradually, I became strictly a Baby Beluga girl (and I'm not vegetarian).  Where else in Portland can you find a dish as creative?  Where else in the world?  I've never seen it anywhere else.  But I've have my share of Mac and Cheese, fish tacos, M-Cobb and Berry Garcia (and they tempt me thoroughly when I dare to open a menu).\\n\\nThere's too much to write about when I think of my favorite neighborhood restaurant (Paley's is my other favorite - and you can't compare the two).

Beautiful inlaid wood tables, unique wrought-iron work, a variety of attractive lighting fixtures and tasteful decorative accessories make it obvious that this place was both well thought out and well done.\\n\\nI've been here 4 times now and I've had some very good food and service. The chili, prawns and blackened fish tacos from the happy hour menu are all good choices. You can mix and match among fillings and sauces for their enchilada selections (I had the carnitas with red chile sauce). The enchiladas are individual, recognizable entities on your plate, as opposed to the typical Mexican restaurant amorphous blob and quite tasty. The chipotle baby back ribs are cooked to perfection, though the sauce was not my favorite. I'm looking forward to sampling additional offerings.\\n\\nAt their grand opening party we ordered the Top Shelf margarita and were disappointed. Sure didn't taste like the cocktail described on the menu. They were cheerfully replaced (by Gran Centenario Silver tequila, neat) from their menu of 75 tequila offerings.

They took all the 'experience' aspect out of DIm Sum, and turned it into a McDonald's that happens to serve Dim Sum.\\n\\nThe aspect of shared plates is great to me, however, this place doesn't do enough to explain how it all works. I think the act of making people fill out a menu (on too small of tables), and go up to the front to order is pretty inconvenient. What happened to the carts? The carts enable you to take your time in choosing what you want in the comfort of your own table. I saw a couple angrily leave because they didn't know what was going on. \\n\\nSecondly, I think the environment feels cold and uncomfortable. I appreciate the clean modern look they're going for, but I thought the plastic tables and chairs were uncomfortable, the decor was bland, and it overall didn't feel like a nice place to be. \\n\\nWhen it came to the food, I was also disappointed. The food didn't taste fresh, and many of the hot dishes came out cold (as compared to T&S Dim Sum). The stick rice felt as if it was days old. I appreciated the variety of the food, and the creativity in some of them, but it wasn't anything memorable.\\n\\nI'd probably give the place another shot, but I did think it was expensive for the quality. Bring the little carts, and it might change my perspective!\\n\\nOn a side note, although not as big of a deal, we had a coupon that we wanted to use which required the purchase to be $50 +. However, because we ate in two rounds (decided to get more after the first ticket), we had two receipts (combined equaling around $55), however, they would not accept the coupon because it was two separate checks.

The pastry also has more of a deep-fried texture than baked one. And dip it in the spicy vinegary sauce for extra zing.\\n\\nMINI BANDEJA PAISA ($10)\\nI love sampler platters. This one had grilled steak, pork skin, fried egg, sweet plantains, corn cake, avocado, rice, & beans.

If you want form instead of function, if you care more about the decor and the service than the food, enjoy the uninspired gimmickry. \\n\\nOne out of town elite reviewer chastised the local elites for \\"being such downers in Portland\\" for their bad reviews,  even going so far as to suggest that \\"We in The South are a little more gracious I suppose\\". Considering that she tried three, rather stodgy restaurants in Downtown, her standing is questionable. I can only hope that during her next visit to the NW she ventures beyond The Pearl district and tries some of the truly phenomenal restaurants before she lectures us our manners. I imagine that I would follow the advice of local yelpers in choosing dining venues in her 'gracious' South."},{"name":"Century Bar","address":"930 SE Sandy Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"This place is clean and has an interesting and unique layout, kudos for that!

Just had the worst dining experience in my life, period. The tablewares at our table greeted us with sticky leftovers from the last users, the air smells of filthy oil and the entire time we ate with the accompaniment of many fruit flies. Most importantly, the garlic bean sprouts (usually $4-9, but ALWAYS UNDER $10 at other restaurants) SELLS FOR ALMOST $20. The price is double that listed in the menu and we weren't given any heads up what so ever!! WOW SUCH SERVICE!!!!  When we got the bill it was almost $70 !!! WHAT????!!!! And when we paid the bill up front, we asked why was the bean sprouts EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE FOR SUCH A SMALL PORTION, the waiter gave us a excuse that made no sense. NO BEAN SPROUT AT SUCH A SMALL PORTION SHOULD SELL FOR $20??? And for the overall quality, it shouldn't be $70 for a light meal (2 young teenage girls with extreme light appetite and 1 adult)  THIS PLACE IS FRIGGIN RIDICULOUS AND ITS A MIRACLE IT STAYED ALIVE FOR SO MANY YEARS!!!! The waiter also gave a bad attitude and demanded 10% minimum tip when he gave the most horrendous service EVER!! (Asked for table ware for the 3rd person for many many times and not informing the customers with basic knowledge of the dishes). When he saw our tips (which was generous enough for the mistreatment we've had here) his own words were \\" 10% is the minimum u need to give (or else we don't get the packed take outs) BUT YOU CAN GIVE 99% IF YOU WANNA \\" all in an extremely sarcastic tone and rolling his eyes at me.

This is a very neighborhood friendly place and lacks any tacky signs or bright lights from signs. If you live in the area, you might not even know this place exists! The waiters here are quiet and respectful; you barely notice them, except that your glass of water is constantly full even though you've been drinking it all along! \\nThe menu is simple. They offer about half a dozen basic sushi rolls and a dozen house specialty rolls - most of it tastes the same anyway. The lunch specials come with miso soup and a salad. And for those who don't appreciate sushi, they have teriyaki and a few noodle dishes with chicken to choose from. \\nBesides a fish tank in the corner (which I think is a requirement for any Asian restaurant), the dinning room has a few small tables and large booths lining the walls. The mismatching ceiling tiles and dull colored carpets make the place look a little too much warn in, but long time Dunwoody customers appreciate the simplicity of the place and the lack of modern, Ikea type decorations reminding them of corporate chains taking over their once humble neighborhood.

We were seated at a table by the door, hidden by all the people waiting for a table. No problem. After not being seen, I went and asked for menus. Got them and figured out what to order. We tried to flag down a server but it was impossible because there were so many people. Again, no problem. Went up to the \\"hostess\\" and told her what I wanted. She put in the order. \\n\\nAfter awhile, the server finally sees us at the table, comes over and we tell her we've already ordered.

Finally someone comes to clean the table. With a dirty cloth. Again, whatever. \\n\\nDuring that whole time, people keep coming in to eat in and order take out. After about 20 mins, the crowd is getting more manageable and we keep looking out for our food. The server sees us and says, it's coming out. Great. We're hungry.\\n\\nAnother 15 mins goes by and still no food. By this time, tables seated after us have all been served and are half-way done their meal. \\n\\nNow, not so happy we decided, screw it...we've already wasted 45 mins here so we get up to leave.

She says, \\"they're about to start cooking your order now.\\" WTF?\\n\\nThe \\"hostess\\" steps in to say, those take-out orders were called in ahead of time. Uhm, I understand Chinese and since I'm seated 3 ft away from you, I can hear what is being ordered and see when the take-out order is given to the customer.\\n\\nThe service was HORRIBLE the entire time but it is what it is in that place.

However, I didn't because I wanted to give this place the benefit of the doubt.  Unfortunately, I learned a life lesson that I should never give anything the 'benefit of the doubt'.  And I feel bad that I am giving a negative review of this place because the owners were SO nice.  But jeez.\\n\\nWhen we arrived they were both eating - and weren't eating anything off the menu.  Which, as my boyfriend says, is like an immediate red flag #1.  They pointed us to the dining room and we had a hard time finding a place to sit because all but two of the tables still had the dirty plates of food.....red flag #2.  We sat down and immediately noticed the guy who looked like a serial killer sitting alone in the back, coughing, and staring at us.  Now, this isn't their fault.  But seriously....creepy.  So then they disappeared for about 5 minutes and came back and we ordered.  Immediately, we heard beeps from the microwave....red flag #3.  Now, the orange juice was fresh and it was really delicious.  Thereby making the orange juice the only thing I wasn't disappointed with.  Finally amidst the coughing of the serial killer, we got our breakfast.  We both ordered meat with hashbrown, 2 egg, and toast.  I couldn't finish mine - NO, I wouldn't finish mine.  It had really no taste, which is fine because there was salt on the table....but I was too freaked by then.\\n\\nListen, I love dive places and I love supporting local businesses.  It's my thing - which is why I was into going to this place even when everything was screaming DON'T DO IT.  My boyfriend barely spoke and we left pretty quickly.

Be forewarned - I cannot do that here.  I love waffles.  They're architecturally sound (unlike the pancake with it's laissez-faire attitude towards cleanliness as syrup and butter pour from it like Niagara Falls, the waffle comes pre-ordained with the good sense to maintain these adornments within its honeycomb shape) and when properly cooked are warm mouthfuls of rich goodness.  So, I entered Waffold about two weeks after opening day with high hope and a high desire not to be too disappointed.\\n\\nI placed a To Go order of Gaucho Chicken ($6.95), a Breakfast BEC ($6.95), and a Nutella & Banana ($5.95) for lunch.  For myself.  Again, I really like waffles.  I waited in the restaurant (mostly empty at 11:30am on a Saturday) for about 15 minutes until the food was ready.  While I waited, I \\"checked-in\\" socially and was surprised FourSquare lists it as a \\"Dessert Shop\\".  Yelp more properly lists it as a \\"Sandwich\\" shop, but more on this later.  When my food was ready, I drove home and 20 minutes later was ready to eat.\\n\\nI started off with the Gaucho Chicken.  The waffle is a hearty, full-sized waffle (imagine a Waffle House size, but slightly thicker).  I was concerned the wait would result in a squishy waffle, but the waffle was firm, warm, golden brown, and cooked enough to be almost crispy (but not crispy).  You know, perfect.  The grilled chicken breast was akin to a hunk of chicken from an Applebee's/Chili's - thick, juicy, a full piece of meat for this sandwich.  Still not sure how the waffle stayed crisp wrapped taco-style over this chicken and the adornments, but it didn't stay uneaten for long.\\n\\nAbout six minutes after opening the Gaucho Chicken, I opened the Breakfast BEC.  I originally planned to save it for later, but so much for the best laid plans of mice (for any Douglas Adams fans?).  Anyhow, this waffle (somehow in the same perfect shape as the previous waffle) encased large slices of bacon and an incredibly, deliciously unhealthy amount of egg and cheese.  How do the waffles maintain their shape/warmth/perfection?  Don't know, but I was pleased.  This one took 7 minutes to eat.\\n\\nNaturally, I wasn't about to leave the Nutella & Banana treat for later.  A deceivingly simple combination of the same size waffle again folded taco-style over nutella and bananas and whipped cream, this concoction of sugary goodness slowed me down, but didn't stop me.  I trudged through and consumed every bite.  I am not a quitter.\\n\\nAfter inhaling all three sandwiches, I realized why FourSquare lists Waffold as a dessert shop.  Maybe it was because I finished with the Nutella & Banana, maybe because I ate three sandwiches within 20 minutes, but I was not only full but almost jittery from the sweetness.  This was a waffle bacchanalia, and I was in the throes of the delirium tremens.  Luckily it didn't last for long, as within a few minutes I fell into a hour-long food-induced coma.\\n\\nSo, GO.  But, know your limits.  Don't go crazy.  Enjoy, but within reason.  And if you go for lunch on the weekends for the next few months, you will probably see me."},{"name":"Barrel & Boar - Westerville","address":"8 N State St","city":"Westerville","stars":"3.5","text":"Food was ok.

They both have their merits and both are done very differently.  Fortes uses chicken breast, which I suspect was brined.  That way, it stays juicy and not dried out.

We visited for my wife's birthday. We were seated promptly and embarked on our expedition to the grill. Upon arriving to the grill I noticed the line was fairly long in comparison to previous visits. When it was my turn I was directed to an open spot at the bar; 3 other people stepped up to the bar at the same time. I noticed that 4 spots were open on the grill and wondered why they were not putting food on them. I then noticed one of the cooks walking around with money. Over the next 5 minutes I became increasingly aggravated by the lack of professionalism I witnessed.\\n\\nThe reason the cook was walking around was because they were trying to divide up tips. It appears that they initial miscounted. This caused an almost panicked response from the cook trying to divvy the cash. They were all taking money, giving money, counting money and conversing about the situation. All in the meantime, nobody was actively cooking. I am sure that the food that was on the grill was overcooked while 4 open spots did not even have food on them. By this time we had 3 rows of people waiting for their food to be cooked. I looked around to the Grill Manager as he was trying to get everyone lined up. I assumed this person was a manager but I observed him watching the tip dispute and he did not make one comment to them. I would like to point out that one of the grillers was actively trying to get everyone to stop and get back to work. Unfortunately I was not able to get his name. If I was a manager and observed that behavior of my staff, I would have given everyone at that grill a free meal. The whole concept of BD's is the grill experience. I enjoy hearing them joke with the patrons, singing, dancing and having fun. What I do not enjoy is people who are supposed to be cooking that are bickering with each other about a couple dollars instead of providing the service that I am paying for. I overheard numerous people in the restaurant commenting on what they did. In a comical way they probably lost more money in tips than what they were disagreeing about because of their behavior.\\n\\nOnce The Great Tip Dispute was over we headed back to our table. While walking through the dining room my wife slipped on lettuce that was on the floor. This caused her to fall to one knee and get a nice bruise. The people around us were very concerned and came to her aid. No employee seemed to notice, or if they did, they did not care to respond. Luckily she did not spill her food. Eventually our server did come back to the table. I made him aware of the food on the floor and that my wife had fallen as a result of it. He simply said sorry and walked away. I was completely in awe of his lack of customer care. We had several guest ask if she was ok but our server failed to show enough concern to ask a simple question, \\"Are you okay\\"\\n\\nI did want to point out a bright light on the staff. The Manager that works at the hostess both is very impressive. Shortly after we left the grill, and the line was 3 deep, I witnessed him go back and work the grill until the line came down. This is a great display of leadership and understanding that you have to do what needs done. I am sure that he doesn't want to work the grill but he understood he had to."},{"name":"Subway","address":"4920 Flat Shoals Pkwy, Unit 109","city":"Decatur","stars":"2.5","text":"A typical Subway lol.

I ordered the filet mignon and while it wasn't the best steak I've ever had (or even close), it was seasoned well and the texture was nice. They cooked it to temperature just as I had asked. Definitely better than decent. The filet came with grilled asparagus and was kind of salty (but I think I'm sensitive to salt). I don't recall the rest of the meal very well, but that may have something to do with all the mandatory hobnobbing and drinking that was done beforehand with colleagues.\\n\\nI've read a couple of reviews of this place and it seems some consider Miel to be ultra upscale. Really? I didn't get that vibe at all, but I also lived in Manhattan for 8 years so maybe I'm a bit desensitized. I would liken it to a Financier Patisserie in the city, except the dinner version...\\n\\nOnly other comment is that the restaurant layout is a bit odd. It's not one of those large, sleek and modern, opulent spaces. Nor is it cozy and intimate. It's sort of in between with a bit of awkward spacing towards the middle of the restaurant where people can stand around and mingle (around you) while you're having dinner.

I have amazing in-laws who pick out fantastic places like this to eat when my husband and I come to town. Be jealous.\\n\\nKicking off the Christmas holiday in style, we had a reservation for Saturday night and as we strolled up to the front door, we caught a glimpse of a man in a kilt outside smoking. Normal. After the double-take, we stepped inside and were escorted to a quiet table near the back of the restaurant past the bar - a perfect spot for lively conversation and catching up.\\n\\nIt took a single glimpse of the cocktail menu to make my selection - who can pass up a bacon garnish?! I anticipated more of a novelty than a delicious libation, but was pleasantly surprised with a scrumptious thin slice of candied bacon perched atop the ice cubes. While the drink itself didn't have a significant amount of bacon flavor, it delivered just enough smokey sweetness to carry the theme.\\n\\nI admit I got caught red-handed by the waiter checking Yelp for food rec's. Doh. He was super fun about it - teasing me that if I need suggestions, that's what he's for. I promptly stashed my phone and put faith in my server - what a novel concept!\\n\\nI have to give kudos to my in-laws again - this time for being so adventurous as to go along with selection of the charcuterie plate as a starter. Compared to plates we've had in the past, the portions on this plate are quite generous, making the pricetag quite reasonable. There were a few meats that didn't sing to me, but the majority of the dish was excellent.\\n\\nThe main course is where our waiter really came through. I'm ashamed to say that given the name of the restaurant, it took coaxing from our waiter to get someone at our table to order the Pork Porterhouse. I come from a family where it's shameful to order more than one of any dish at the table, and if you're of the same ilk, you need to buck with tradition and get the porterhouse no matter how many others in your company order it. You will eat the entire thing and perhaps lick the plate. It's insane. My father-in-law graciously offered all of us a morsel and it was voted hands-down the best dish at the table. Mind you, the venison put up a pretty strong showing, but the pork is simply untouchable. The corn pudding is something dreams are made of, and I'm convinced that the pork is rubbed with fairy dust. \\n\\nHow we had room for dessert is beyond me. But have dessert, we did. My pork/venison trance may not have worn off completely, as I don't recall all the details of either of our selections. We had a chocolate cake with peppermint garnish that was decent but nothing over the top. Our other selection was fantastic, so you'd think I'd remember what it was other than the fact that it was gone as quickly as it appeared.\\n\\nLessons learned = trust servers, order by the namesake... oink."},{"name":"Romano's Pizzeria and Taqueria","address":"4249 Washington St","city":"Roslindale","stars":"3.5","text":"This place has excellent tacos and burritos.

My friend and I were the only 2 people sitting at the bar (until a gaggle of purple-shirted folks came in on some sort of a pub crawl).  Try that on a Friday night.  We have been trying a lot of Boston's Best Burgers and not wanting to cross the river to drive around looking for parking for 3 hours in Harvard Sq, we settled on Dillion's.  Once I figured out how to use the incredibly elaborate parking sticker machine on Boylston, we were in.  We sat down and ordered a couple bloody marys.  I forgot to ask for mine with Citron vodka so while it was good, it could have been better.  My fault.  \\n\\nThey seem to have remodeled.  There is now a large outdoor patio area on the Boylston street side.  It was too hot to sit anywhere without AC so we remained indoors.  We asked if there was still the lower outdoor bar area and the bartender said they had closed it.  I had been there a few times years ago and since at the time you were allowed to smoke out there, it was always packed and smokey so I was not exactly crestfallen to hear it's gone.\\n\\nThe standard, top of the menu burger, comes with cheese and applewood smoke bacon.  Glad to know the base-line burger involves bacon.  I went with it sort of because that's probably what I would have gotten anyway and partially because I wanted to know what their signature burger was like.  What was it like?  Delicious.  It was a big hamburger patty but not so large that it fell apart.    The bun was soft and fresh and lastly the toppings.  The cheese was a tasteless orange square.  On the other hand, the applewood smoked bacon was as good of a slice of bacon as I've ever had on a hamburger.  Thick smokey and lean.  The bacon made up for the Kraft singles cheese slice.  The fries were OK but nothing to write home about.  \\n\\nThe service was prompt, friendly and as a result, we stuck around for another couple rounds after we finished eating.  I'm not sure I'd wait in line to get in on a weekend night but as a place to get a Saturday afternoon burger and beer and watch golf on tv, they were terrific."},{"name":"Red and Black Cafe","address":"400 SE 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"This place is a DUMP !!!

It happens, but what was particularly annoying is that the waitress wasn't able to explain which component was out. We'd have been happy to substitute for something moderately similar, and their menu seemed to show all sorts of vodka, fruit, etc. options. Still, she refused to offer up any recommendations and just shrugged. Yes, physically shrugged and didn't even verbally respond.\\n\\n* My girlfriend's water glass had something light brown caked onto the inner side of it, just under the size of a penny.\\n\\n* The food was fine, I guess. Each item was cooked totally accurately to request (as in, \\"medium well\\" was exactly \\"medium well\\"), but the flavor/seasoning was disappointing.\\n\\n* The waitress (and later, a manager type) offered a free dessert because of the dirty glass, and we refused because we're not really dessert people/don't eat sweets. Seriously, no big deal; it sucks to be slurping down someone else's gunky water sludge, but it happens. Still, they came back out later with some random dessert that we didn't really know what to do with.\\n\\n* The waitress took our valet stub as we were wrapping up (there doesn't seem to be self parking, so there's free valet), and when we stepped outside a few minutes later, two guys were chatting among themselves. I made the mistake of assuming there was a third guy who went to get our car, but after about half a minute, one of the guys asked if we were waiting for an Uber. I said something about our waitress sending out our stub, and one of the men responded something to the effect of, \\"Yeah, we get a lot of those.\\" Okay, cool.

The cured meats and soft cheeses and hummus dip or really a great way to start the meal. I also had a fiery habanero margarita and the girl got her glass of red wine.

I've had 4 people, including myself, eat there and the full bill was barely $70. Try that at an Emeril's or Season's and you'll run well into the triple digits (and this is better, anyway).\\n\\nIt's also incredibly laid back and not at all what you'd expect from a place that's generally regarded as ritzy - sure, you have some douchey popped collars occasionally, but the atmosphere created by the staff is like a well-maintained and extremely classy bar where anyone who appreciates good food is welcome.\\n\\nAnd all of this, when it comes down to it, ALL of it really doesn't matter when you get to the food, which is the absolute heart of everything done at this establishment. The menu changes seasonally and seemingly on the whim of the chefs themselves based on the availability of ingredients that mostly come from local farms (even the meat!). There's a few seemingly permanent staples -- the truffle fries, the biscuits, the mussels, the monthly whole animal roasts, all excellent and well worth a try.\\n\\nYou can sense the adventure in the preparation of each dish, especially if it's one you've never seen on the menu before. There's an experimentation with flavors here in every meal that just melts into a melange of amazing tastes.\\n\\nThe only drawback I see to this is you may encounter something you don't like in this little dash across the uncharted culinary waters. But it's a small price to pay, and the staff are always unerringly accommodating. \\n\\nEither way, even if you're not an adventurous diner, give the Pig a try. There's always something delicious there.

I will never ever ever order pizza from them again, or anything else. And I wish I could get my money back that's how bad it was.

The green goddess (shrimp/avocado/lettuce/herb dressing) lacked acid, the R&R chopped (radicchio/romaine/filberts/blue cheese) was uninspired, and the sliced tomato salad was comprised of overripe tomatoes, barely any cheese, about 5 leaves of watercress and a \\"not-so French dressing\\" that was virtually all vinegar.  \\n\\nWe tried a couple of \\"Roscoe\\" sliders...chicken and waffles.

We decided around 12pm that we would call for a reservation seeing as how the restaurant always looked so busy as we drove by. The woman who answered the phone was very nice, but informed us that if we wanted to sit inside the restaurant, the earliest reservation that was available was for 9:30pm, too late. So we decided to bundle up and hope for the best with an outside patio table. \\n\\nWhen we arrived at the restaurant around 7pm, we were quickly sat and visited by our waiter, a nice young gentleman whose name I didn't catch. After getting our water and ordering our normal drinks ( Wine, Beer, and Scotch) we waiting about 15-17 minutes to get them. A little bit long to wait for drinks, but we shrugged it off as it just being a busy night. When our drinks finally arrived, we decided to order out staters quickly so that it wouldn't be a long wait. We ordered the Cheese Plate and the biscuits (which we were told are now included in the meal). Both items arrived at the table about 15 minutes later (thankfully since it had gotten quite nippy outside and we needed something warm) Both items were absolutely superb! The biscuits were flakey and their Vermont sea-salt butter was so rich and smooth. The cheese platter had three types of cheese with different pairings of jams/purees. The serving size was small by the looks but hearty when shared between three people. \\n\\nOnce our waiter returned to pick up our plates, which had been all but licked clean, we ordered our main meals and refills on our drinks. Again the service was slightly slow but with the nice atmosphere (minus an angry outburst from a animal-rights activist with a jumbo TV that drove by) and great music, the wait didn't seem too bad. My mother's Pork Porterhouse and my summer squash raviolis (can't remember the name of the dish) arrived first, both smelling wonderfully. My husband ended up having to wait for his Steak Frites for about 10 minutes after we got our food (part of the reason my review is lacking a star). It's such an awkward dance you have to do when one persons meal is missing from the table, to wait, or not to wait. Once his food arrived, you heard nothing  but us eating. My mother definitely ordered best with her 20oz piece of meat which I was told was \\"smooth and butter with immense flavor\\".  I, being the vegetarian, had the raviolis which were divine in flavor. Each bite was so complex but made so much sense. My husband was happy with his, but wished he had gone for the Pork Porterhouse instead. \\n\\nOnce we finished eating, we waited a while for the desert menu, mostly because my stepfather, who was out of town, had called and paid for our meal and ordered a birthday desert for my mother. She ordered her Espresso with Sambuca and my husband and I ordered the Creme Br√ªl√©e (since we are both such fans.) My mother got a chocolate macaroon with a lemon curd and ice-cream with what I think were cocoa-nibs and a strange spicy chutney on the side of the plate. Other than the chutney, hers was delicious. Our creme br√ªl√©es however, were not as amazing as the rest of our meal. The nut brittle topping was so amazing that we had high hopes when we cracked the surface of the smooth creamy inside. I wouldn't say that it was bad, it just was simply not great. We ate a few bites and then let the waiter take the rest.\\n\\nOverall, our night was very enjoyable and we will be definitely returning to see what other dishes make it to the ever-changing menu. But in order for me to re-visit the review and give this place a 5/5, they would need to work on the speed of service, as well as make sure all dishes come out at the same time, and maybe invest in some of the heating lamps for the patio area for nights where it gets a bit chilly."},{"name":"Palio Dessert & Espresso House","address":"1996 SE Ladd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"I really like it.

I do enjoy dining at Dinesty (it is a restaurant of my choice when it comes to Shanghai food). But I will be honestly that I don't think I will come back to this location after my first visit. Don't get me wrong. Service was ok and food was good. It was the pricing. This Dinesty charges $2 - $3 more than its other locations. The difference was so big that I noticed it. For instance, the beef noodle was $12 and at the other locations was less than $10. A little here and a little there adds up to quite a bit. I think overall, the meal costed over $10 more if I were to dine at ... say the Richmond location. \\n\\nWe ordered:\\nBeef noodle, \\nDrunk Chicken\\nClams\\nBeef pancake,\\njuicy buns (xiao lung bao)\\npan fried dumpling\\n\\nI didn't like the beef noodle out of everything that I ordered.

The first time I stayed basic and tried the traditional lamb & beef gyro with a side of hummus.  The sandwich was just the right size, and the gyro meat was seasoned well and moist.  The side order of hummus comes with fresh pita slices.\\n\\nAs good as the traditional gyro was, the chicken gyro I ordered for dinner the next time could be considered a revelation.  A noticeable-but-not-overpowering lemon flavor said \\"fresh\\" and was a much lighter take on the gyro sandwich.  This time I got a side of French fries, which are dusted with yummy spices and make you want twice as many as the standard small portion.\\n\\nMy main complaint is the inordinate amount of time it took to receive my order on both occasions.  The time I was in for dinner, in particular, was a good 20 minute wait, which is unacceptable for a quick serve restaurant.\\n\\nBeverages are limited to a soda fountain and (sometimes) fresh brewed tea.

Ugh. You wouldn't believe the experience I had there yesterday. It was likely the worst bar experience I've had in my entire life. Actually, it was. It's not even close.\\n\\nThere were two NFL playoff games yesterday, so I was expecting the place to be relatively busy. I walked in the door and immediately couldn't hear myself think. Music was playing, and it was too loud. There was some sort of raffle game being done as well, and it was hosted by a guy who may have been drunk. He had a microphone so that everyone in the bar could hear what he was saying, which is acceptable. However, he was screaming into it. So, to summarize so far: I go to this place to watch a football game and instead have to listen to music that's too loud and a drunk guy screaming into a microphone.\\n\\nThat's only the beginning.\\n\\nSo, the game I wanted to see begins, and I'm trying to hear the announcers, but can't due to the aforementioned noise pollution. Usually I'm not bothered if the TV's sound at a bar isn't that great since the bars I go to when I want to see a game aren't overcrowded and rowdy. Normally I can get by and be able to follow the game with average volume. It was such a zoo in this place yesterday that I think they had the volume turned up a decent amount, but I still couldn't hear anything. The aforementioned drunk idiotic guy running the raffle game then started running a Bingo game. From what I could tell, if you had a specific letter + number combination, you get a free shot. (For example, if you had B1, you could go up and get a free shot from this schmuck.)\\n\\nThis is where things really got bad.\\n\\nThe free shot was something called a \\"wet pu$$y.\\" The belligerent guy kept saying it, too. \\"Come up and get a free wet pu$$y.\\" \\"Wet pu$$y for anyone with (letter + number combination)!\\" I heard this idiot say that word maybe 25 times in a 5-minute span. Then the next free shot had a sexual connotation. I forget what it was exactly, but it was similar to \\"wet pu$$y.\\" This might be acceptable in a bar in a college town, or maybe at a dive bar that no one would bring their children into ... except that I counted at least 10 young kids (likely between the ages of 8-12) in this place while this nonsense was going on. One was standing right behind me and watching the football game, so if I heard what this moron with the microphone was saying, I'm sure the kid did too. Two other young children were standing right next to this guy's soapbox, and I saw a few others scattered throughout the area nearby. To me, this is just totally classless and inexcusable. (NOTE TO MANAGEMENT: This is not the Delta House from Animal House. It's a restaurant and sports bar. The food menu is at least 2 full pages long, and maybe even three. People come here to eat and probably think that it's okay to bring their children along. Their children shouldn't have to be subjected to this disgusting behavior. If brought my child to this place and had to have him listen to what the guy with the microphone was saying, there would've been a serious problem. If anyone who is responsible for running this place is reading this, you should know that you're very lucky some adults who had their kids there didn't cause a scene. I would've, and I know some others who would've as well.)\\n\\nTo make matters even worse, some drunk meathead one table over (you know the type; the guy with the spiky hair, the bulging biceps barely fitting into his shirt 2 sizes too small, tattoos all over himself) was playing the \\"quarters\\" drinking game with a few of his friends. You know, you do stuff like that at your own home, or at a friend's house, or maybe at a bar that hosts drinking games. Not in public. This isn't a dive bar. It's a RESTAURANT where someone should feel comfortable taking their children to watch a game. Kids between the ages of 8-12 shouldn't have to watch some gorilla playing \\"quarters\\" and another one infinitely screaming \\"wet pu$$y\\" and the like. I realize that children learn about bad language, sex, drugs and alcohol at very early ages these days, thanks to what's shown on TV and in movies (not to mention what they can find online), but their parents shouldn't have to worry about them seeing or hearing this stuff at a place called The Friendly Confines. Seriously, what kind of a name is that for an establishment that permits the behavior I experienced yesterday? Sickening.\\n\\nNow, some people will say that children don't belong in bars during football games and so on. Right - they do not belong in \\"bar\\" bars, where smoking is permitted, gambling is going on, etc. They should feel welcome in a restaurant/sports bar. I'm sure parents take their young children to T.G.I. Friday's and Buffalo Wild Wings and so on. They probably feel it's okay to take them to The Friendly Confines, too. At least at this location in Lake Mary, they SHOULD NOT."},{"name":"Vij's Restaurant","address":"3106 Cambie Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"I've been wanting to go to Vij's for about 8 or 9 years every since my brother and I became regulars at Toronto's Amaya - The Indian Room on Bayview (which went through numerous reincarnations and no longer exists as it was back in 2009/2010.) So on my recent trip to Vancouver I made sure to clear the schedule and get to the restaurant early on a Monday to score a table.  \\n\\nTo put everything I'm about to say into context, I've tried many Indian restaurants in Canada, the US, the UK, Dubai and, of course, India.  My absolute favourites have been Masala Library by Jiggs Karla in Mumbai, Indego by Vineet in Dubai, Dishoom in London and Pukka in Toronto.\\n\\nThough my expectations of Vij's was high, I had prepared myself to be somewhat disappointed since I thought he may have taken the eye off the ball being distracted with things like the Dragon's Den.  I was wrong.  My expectations were high and Vij's delivered.\\n\\nLocation, ambience, music, decor blah blah blah....great.  But I'm not here for that.  Let me talk about the food.  The beef and lamb samosas are to die for- tender meat infused with properly toasted Indian spices- not your local 2 or 3 for a $1 samosas.  \\n\\nThe Braised Short Ribs are a must have as well.  This delicately braised cut of beef is accented wonderfully by a thin consistency curry which pairs wonderfully with rice and naan.  That naan by the way is so light and pillowy you could almost float on it to heaven- but not before having the sought after Lamb Popsicles.\\n\\nNow let me go back to 2009/2010 when I used to visit Amaya in Toronto.  One of the staple items at Amaya were lamb popsicles which at the time I thought were amazing.  I can recall sitting next to a couple who saw this dish come to my table and watched as I took bites.  One of them said \\"How is it?  Seems like its straight out of Vij's cookbook.\\"  And boom.  Right then I had realized who Vij was and begun reading about this Vancouver gem of a restaurant. \\n\\nBack to Vij's and the Lamb Popsicles. I'm now an addict.  I'm telling you now this is my personal opioid crisis.  I'm literally sitting in my living room planning my next trip to Vancouver.

It's a mix of grown up and family environment that works.  \\n\\nService is a bit weird here.  I've only been on Saturday nights, and it seems as though they don't have enough people working.  The people who work the lane reservation counter could not care less about your experience.  Most of them don't make eye contact just in case you ask them for something or mention a problem with the lanes. The service at the bar has been the best for me - whether sitting and enjoying food while waiting for our lane or walking up to place an order.  The bar service can be slow (because of understaffing), but you can tell that they are trying and they don't ignore you.  \\n\\nThe lane machine is easy to operate, and there are plenty of balls if you don't have your own.  Also, the shoes are not ugly at all.  Whoever decided on the shoe style - two thumbs up!  The lanes themselves are quirky.  They seem to have system issues, i.e. you hit 9 pins, and the machine removes all the pins, including the 1 that's left.  But you still have to roll a ball down the lane for the computer to give you a spare.  This is fine in a non-competitive setting, but I can see it being a major problem for a league tournament. \\n\\nAnd although I've visited before the Kids Curfew goes into effect, I do enjoy that kids have to be out by 10pm.

It's not fair, but now I can't help doing it too! Not the judging part, just the weak link search. So this dish, to us, sounded like the most fusion-y, wacky, most unlikely to succeed entrant. But it was delicious. It was aggressively savory, which I don't mean negatively at all. I think the dish might be a nod to the korean dish, duk boki,  a favorite of mine. I never would have thought of it when I looked at the menu description, but the look of the dish, with the gnocchi standing in for the tube shaped rice cake in duk boki, as well as the mix of flavors, was familiar.\\n\\nWe ordered the chicken ballotine (chicken ballotine, black garlic, endive, onion rings)\\nIt was tasty, but fundamentally just the chicken dish.

Despite the noisy (and due to the nearby nail salon, somewhat smelly) location, the food is wonderful! It's tricky to find really good interesting food in Orlando, but El Buzo fits the bill! Run by a spearfisher (who loves to show you photos of his catches before the meal), the place definitely specializes in seafood. While I can't certify that it was fresh-caught, or caught by the owner, it certainly tasted good enough to have been! I had the Ceviche, which was delicious, and very fresh-tasting. It came with some kind of interesting corn kernel on the side, which was very good. It was $10, which was a fine deal for the amount I got. The service was excellent, although that's partly because business was unfortunately slow. My companions had the Causa, shrimp salad rolled in a thick yellow paste (potato?) It looked very interesting (all the food was presented very fancily for the price), and tasted like a shrimp-potato-seafood salad. It was reasonably priced, but I think it was cheap to make, because the owners were very enthusiastic about it and encouraged him to get it. My other companion had the fish filet, which was delicious, very fresh, buttery and salty, but not to the point of losing any flavor. Peruvians love potatoes, and the yellow mashed potatoes that came with the fish were delicious.

They always have great beers, friendly faces, and something going on.  I sat down to write this as a five star review, then decided that four would be better.  That's not to say there's anything wrong with this place at all and I absolutely recommend this place to any and everyone, however there are a couple of small things that keep it from the star rating I want it to have...\\n\\nWhy does a place this small have to have live entertainment six nights a week?  I'm all about live music - but I'd prefer in a place this small to not have as much and the sort that they have.  This is a much better environment for acoustic or low volume acts rather than the dudes with 2x12s and 4x10s who play here.  Again, don't get me wrong, I have both of those amps, but they're for larger venues.  That being said, the music here is awesome!  It's just a little loud and sometimes.\\n\\nBrunch.  Apparently they have some sort of brunch but when I came in a couple of months ago to soak up my hangover I was greeted with the dinner menu and wound up with a burger that was sub-par at best.\\n\\nNow, the food is actually VERY good, but the items mentioned above didn't quite blow my balls back, if you will.  Definitely get the Po' Boy Du Jour and the fried zucchini fingers.\\n\\nOverall Bulls is a great place to go and get a few beers, watch a game, and hang out.   I'd just recommend getting in and out before 10pm when the music starts.  I've never been down there for trivia but I bet it's a good time, it's a real good set up for it.  Go down here if you haven't, the bartenders are great, the food does the job, and the beers, man.

Today I decided it's time to speak out about my experiences. I agree with the person who says their food is \\"blah\\" at best. Salads are often dry, tuna salad is very bland, soups are overrated. The very best thing they serve is a baked potato with all the fixings - those rock. And the gelato is pretty good. DON'T waste your money on the coffee. I ordered a latte and it was the most horrible thing I've ever tasted. A latte is supposed to have a lot of milk - this one tasted like it may have had a tablespoon. And it was very bitter - like it was a 12 oz. cappuccino. If I had wanted strong coffee, I would've ordered it. I called and told the owner, nicely, that I had just wasted 4 dollars and thought he might like to know that whomever is running the coffee machine doesn't know what they're doing. He proceeded to try and set me straight by telling me that there are three shots of coffee in a medium latte. I replied that I've probably had lattes in more than 30 restaurants in Austin, and this one was nowhere close to ANY of them. He then told me that they put more coffee in their drinks than most, and I said, \\"I guess so!\\" While he was still trying to defend the drink, I very nicely said, \\"take what you like and leave the rest. I'm not happy with it, and I thought you might appreciate that feedback.\\" He then offered to give me a free coffee drink when I come in. Hmmmm - I'm not terribly tempted.\\n\\nBottom line is that their sandwiches, salads, omelets and soups are ok, but just ok. If you're low on options this place will suffice. But if you have the opportunity to look elsewhere, I'd say go for it."},{"name":"Tin Shed Garden Cafe","address":"1438 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"We walked by and had to stop because the outdoor garden patio looked to inviting.

I'm gonna have to side with the Yelpers on this one. The Florentine is utterly and completely average.\\n\\nI try not to hate on places where I've only been once and had a bad server. Maybe that person was having a really tough night or maybe it's just that one person and not the rest of the establishment. That being said, our server was pretty condescending to the older folks in my party (e.g., talking really slowly and loudly, patronizing them, etc) and when I tried to make friendly small talk about the restaurant with her - hey, I'm a friendly guy - she pretty much ignored me.

The place was quite crowded.  I walked up to the hostess station to put my name down, but there was no one there.  Not a big deal, everyone was busy.  A person stops by the station, doesn't make eye contact, grabs something and leaves.  Then the hostess comes back, also doesn't make eye contact or say anything to me, shuffles some papers, and then leaves.  But third time's the charm, and the hostess then did the normal greeting things.  I was told of a 30 minute wait for a table for 2, but got seated in just over 10 minutes.  They don't take your phone number to call you when your table is ready and there's really no room to wait for a table inside, so I hung out outside the place.  They poke their heads out the door and yell names every so often.  It's not an efficient system, but it works.  \\n\\nOur waitress didn't smile once the whole night.  Everything was strictly business, but if we ignore the lack of friendliness then she did a good job.  I ordered chips and guac as an appetizer and was surprised when they rolled up a cart to make the guac tableside. Unfortunately I had to shift my seat to the side significantly so the table didn't block an aisle.  The guac table also had a tipjar on it, which I found very strange.  Why would I tip the guac-maker separately?  Isn't she sharing tips with the rest of the waitstaff?  She also didn't smile at all, but the guac was delicious.  It didn't come with chips, so I had to ask for the waitress to bring some because the guac-maker left without leaving us any.  Hard to eat guac without chips, right?\\n\\nOur entrees were delicious.  I could nitpick the flautas as being slightly overcooked, but the delicious sauces on each covered it up and I didn't mind.  Dessert was good too (we got the flan).  The atmosphere of the place was good, but it's incredibly loud.  I had to do a lot of yelling to be heard.  \\n\\nOverall we had two drinks, an app, two entrees, and dessert for $65, which my wife and I were quite happy with.

This is the 4th location for the Barrel and Boar chain (others in Newark, Gahanna and the North Market).\\n\\nWhen we made reservations for tonight, I didn't realize that this was Restaurant Week and that the Barrel and Boar was participating.  After looking over their regular menu, we opted for their Restaurant Week menu which offers a choice of 3 appetizers, 3 entrees and 3 desserts for a flat $25.00.  \\n\\nMy wife choose a potine while I opted for a a crab salad/spread with thin, crispy slices of bread.  For dinner, we both had their 1/2 rack of ribs. I ordered mine with fries and Cole slaw while my wife opted for the sweet potato fries.  The ribs were EXCEPTIONAL and the Cole slaw was very good.  My fries were great but the wife's sweet potato fries weren't anywhere close to hot.  We mentioned this to the waitress who indicated that she'd bring a fresh order.  It took quite a while for the fresh order to arrive and this batch was definitely hot but also over-cooked (quite dark in color).\\n\\nThey offer four sauces - original smokey, sweet and smokey, spicy Chipotle and Carolina.  The ribs were great without any additional sauce but I still had to try all four.  My personal favorite was the original smokey. The spicy Chipotle was good but didn't really have much of a punch to it; it was really pretty mild.\\n\\nThe positives -- the food (with the exception of the sweet potato fries) was excellent, the waitress was very nice and was very accommodating.  The managers were circulating the dining area and kept checking in with people to see how things were going.\\n\\nThe negatives -- they need to work on \\"timing\\".  Our appetizers came out REALLY, REALLY quick but there was a long gap between the appetizers and the entree.  In fact, the waitress apologized for the delay and brought a side of hush puppies to make up for the delay.\\n\\nI think this restaurant will be a great addition to Uptown Westerville.

However, we gladly accepted the challenge, and the bartender/server/owner(?) was more than happy to bear witness. \\n\\nWe started with the Chicken & Vegetable Dumplings appetizer ($7), which consisted of 6 freshly fried potstickers and a sweet chili sauce.

We sat at the bar for a little bit while we waiting for our table to be ready.  They had a large selection of beer but I am not really a beer drinker so I waited till we sat down to order a cocktail.  We didn't have to wait long and I'm not really sure why we were sent to the bar at all since there were many empty tables in the dining room.   That is another thing I wasn't sure about since every time we tried to get a reservations they were always booked but when we were there we saw so many empty tables.  \\nWe started out with the Lobster Tacos for appetizers since I read that they were a must.

There were a lot of other choices and their menu changes daily so I would definitely try something else.   We also had a burrata and fig salad and  I was wondering why they called it a barrata salad since there was only a schemer of barrata cheese.  There was a piece of pork bacon in the salad that was very tasty and that really made the salad not the burrata.\\nFor the main course we had the rib eye steak and a the pasta chiratta.  The steak was very tasty and was cooked just right.  The pasta was very good as well,  but a little on the mushy side with all of the ingredients in it.\\nWe skipped on the dessert since I was pretty full after eating all of the above mentioned.

Worst service of all time.\\n\\nThis is the first time I've taken the time to review a bad restaurant experience but I feel compelled to get this out there to hopefully enact a change of management and service from this establishment.  I have been going to Taco Mac and have been a Brewniversity member for a quite a long time.  Five of us went in yesterday (Wednesday 7/29/2015) to have some wings and beer.  We arrived at 6:45pm and were seated upstairs.  We ordered the queso dip and a pitcher of PBR.  15 minutes later we receive the queso, and 5 minutes after that we received the beer.  20 minutes to get a pitcher, seemed like a long time but not a huge deal.  Our other friends show up and need glasses.  Waiter tells us that the entire establishment has run out of glasses.  I don't see how this is possible, especially since they have a bunch of extra \\"special\\" glasses every Thursday night.  He then lectures us about how we may not use our plastic water glasses to improvise.  We put in an order for a 2nd pitcher and our main food orders.  30 minutes goes by and we still do not have our next pitcher.  We ask the waiter where it is and he says to hold on.  20 MORE minutes goes by, the waiter has come in our room at least 5 more times since then with no pitcher.  I ended up walking downstairs to the bar and ordering a pitcher for us in less than 2 minutes.  The waiter saw me do this and then brought up a pitcher 5 minutes later and acted surprised that we went and got one ourselves.  After that we asked again where our wings were and he made up some excuse about how the wings were ready but they were waiting on sauce, keep in mind that this has been an hour since we put our food order in.  20 minutes later we are finishing our next pitcher and still no wings.  We decided that we could no longer wait since we had been there for almost 2 hours.  We put $22+ on the table and left due to being so displeased with the service (total bill would have been $14 for what we consumed).  This entire time our waiter didn't refill our waters even once, it was hands down the worst service I've ever received.  On our way out we went to get our parking validated with the hostess, she asked how our wings were.  I told her that we never got them because they took 2 hours to get out.  She just stared at me and said \\"Ok\\" and that was it.  I've seen this before and this is a direct cause of extremely poor management.

Super busy when I went, and a bit chaotic, and I felt lost at times. After getting seated, nobody realized I wanted to order until one of the other customers waved down someone to take my order. It seems like a lot of the customers were locals / regulars and would greet the waitstaff by name.\\n\\nI tried their famous fried chicken with carrot souffl√©, collars greens and fried okra. The fried chicken was pretty good for southern fried chicken, I liked the batter as it was very flavorful. I got the dark meat which came with a leg and wing - the wing was in my opinion better because it was juicier and came with a lot of the delicious batter. The crispy batter is the best part. The leg was kind of dry inside it. The collard greens were pretty good, very savory. Honestly didn't know what to expect with the carrot souffl√© and it ended up being like a sweet mash that reminded me of sweet potatoes. Very good but too sweet (from added maple syrup? Or honey?) for me. The fried okra was nice and crunchy but I honestly prefer my okra not fried, because I felt like frying made it lose a lot of what makes it so unique. \\n\\nThe desserts were too sweet. The sweet potato pie was fine but too sweet, and I was hoping it would be similar to pumpkin pie but it wasn't quite as smooth and didn't have the same spices.

I didn't try that so can't comment but I'm happy it's an option.\\n\\nThe crowd for lunch on a rainy day was not terrible, I had to wait in line behind a group of four, and by the time I left every table was full.

The floorplan is open and you can check out the action in the busy yet organized kitchen. We typically order steaks and they will go to great lengths to make sure everything is perfect with your meal.  The side dishes are a la carte and are large enough to serve 2-3 people.

I need to get me one of these!\\n\\nI stayed here for work and was assigned a room in the newer tower (to the left if you are facing the front desk) on the 21st floor, even though the room number started with a 22...weird.   Since I was on a higher floor, I did have a nice view from huge windows in the room and while I was waiting for the elevator.  The elevators are numerous and very fast...much needed with such a large hotel.  The standard rooms are large, clean, and have all the amenities of a nice hotel.  Beds are very comfortable with very smooth linens.  Bathroom, with the aforementioned cool nightlight, is spacious with lots of counter space.  The in-room wifi and resort fee was free with our work event, so not sure what would be charged if staying here outside an event.\\n\\nGorgeous giant lobby with a well staffed front desk and busy bell stand.  There are multiple restaurant, coffee and bar areas in the older & newer parts of the hotel, so you don't even have to leave the hotel if you don't want to.  Convention space was great and very large, but be prepared for a long walk from the lobby area.  No wonder there are so many couches and sitting areas everywhere...it is so you can rest while walking around the hotel.  The hotel is also right next to another convention center...I can just imagine the traffic if there were large events going on in both venues. There are nods to the Peabody Hotel with duck references (I still wish they have the twice daily duck parades) in some places...my favorite is the duck in the marble floors in the elevators.\\n\\nParking, while some grumbled about the cost and it being a short distance away, was actually way more convenient than having to valet the car...I saw some lines of people waiting for their cars often, while I passed by and went directly to my car.

The #2, spicy miso ramen is great too, but be careful before adding all the miso paste, a dab will do ya! Unless you want it super spicy, then dive in!

Especially the slush or smoothies. Sometimes there will be too much powder or they will be blended way to much, which makes for a very milky or watery beverage.\\n\\nBut overall, I don't feel bad spending $3.75 on a black tea or slush. Very enjoyable drinks.\\n\\nDecor is always kept nice as well. Sometimes the chairs and tables will wobble, but it gives a small stop like this character.\\n\\nThe Mochi is always unreal too. Especially, the seasonal ones.\\nIt is a bummer when they only have two or three flavors to choose from.\\nI don't know if it is a lapse in orders or what, but the demand is always there, so I feel the products should always be there as well.\\n\\nFour stars for this reason: I have never felt like a regular. It is almost as iff it is my first time there every time I walk-in. I feel like the counter staff won't try to do more than necessary when it comes to their guests.

It's a great place to hang out with friends. With two floors, the restaurant is ginormous, so they can easily accommodate large parties.\\n\\nYou can share large pots or have your own small pot. You can split the large pots and have two broths at each half of the pot. The broth doesn't have very distinctive flavors. Once I came with a group of 6 and we had 4 different broths. Honestly, they all tasted similar, with the exception of the spicy broth, which is probably my favorite.\\n\\nFood is decent. It's all you can eat for a fairly low price. The menu has a large selection of food - from vegetables, meat, seafood, to noodles and rice. Some of the food don't seem very fresh but most of them are okay. They will definitely fill you up. I didn't particular love the dipping sauce. I prefer mixing my own sauce.\\n\\nThe service is very inconsistent. Last time I was here on a Saturday night, service was as slow as it could be. One of my friends wanted a bowl of rice and didn't get it until the FOURTH time he ordered it off the menu!!

I really like the concept of eggplant on a pizza and thought the toppings were well done.\\n\\nThe crust is thin, which meant it was soggy by the time we got it home. It was flavorful and crisp at the edges, though. Overall I think I like the pizza at Sweet Tomatoes better, but Bill's seems to have a lot of other tasty-sounding offerings (salads, entrees, GELATO) so I'll definitely try again next time.

The balconies are all painted a bright blue, there are giant screens featuring close ups of various sea life, and there's a general nautical vibe to the place. Very cute, goes perfect with the SeaWorld location, and the kids in the group were mesmerized by the turtles on the big screen. The adults benefited from the big screen TVs showing Sunday football in the bar. \\n\\nWhile the bartender was fast on drink service, the wait staff and kitchen crew could've been a bit more attentive and speedy. Do not eat in the bar restaurant if you're in a rush. REPEAT: DO NOT eat at the bar restaurant if you're in a rush. We waited at least half an hour between each stop the waitress made, even for our checks!

While we were offered a discount rate for the conference, even the rack rate, which you pay if you don't book in advance, wasn't expensive. The price was worth the hotel quality. A few added values include free wi-fi in the lobby (or on your indoor balcony), Aveda products in the bathroom (ACTUAL shampoo and conditioner, not the fake all-in-one stuff), decent sized flat panel TVs, and yes, even little Shamu toys in the bathrooms. \\n\\nWhen all was said and done, even though I felt a bit silly checking into a hotel 45 minutes from my actual home, I had a great time.

I'd be lying if I wasn't intrigued by the name alone, considering that I was pretty much raised on comic books, video games and any other form of nerdy media that pitted heroes versus villains.\\n\\nAnyway, they're located at the corner of 8th and Peachtree, on the other side of the street basically facing the Midtown Vortex.  I can't speak for parking since I walked there, but I can't imagine it's great, considering the tiny strip including Villains has like literally five parking spaces, shared between three businesses.  There are pay lots right next door, but people are inherently always pursuing free parking, so I'd say it'd be safe to assume to not bank on getting one of their spots.\\n\\nThere's a good bit of outdoor seating, but in the middle of a Georgia sauna summer, I opted to sit indoors; despite the fact that the bar is of the double-sided variety that keeps it wide open to the outdoors, the inside is still vastly cooler and drier than it would be sit outdoors in the summer.  On a weekend morning, I tend to assume that any place advertising brunch options should have people already there when I arrive, but Villains was almost deserted.  I hoped that this wasn't a sign of things to come and/or people, like always were instead crowding outside of Flying Biscuit, leaving the vast other breakfast/brunch options open for people like me.\\n\\nAs for the interior itself, it's dimly lit and decorated with lots of darks and metallics, since clearly villains in literature tend to like things of such variety, or lack thereof.  Identity-wise, there's not a whole lot about the interior decoration that really goes with the name \\"Villains,\\" other than silhouettes of comic book characters on some tables, and a chalkboard wall with some scribbles of formulas and plots to take over the world or something.  Needless to say, the identity of the place seemed a little lacking in relation to the name.\\n\\nBut none of the previously mentioned is why I rate Villains what I rate them, because when the day is over, the food is all that matters and should matter.  And unfortunately, I have to say that I was widely unimpressed with my choice at Villains.\\n\\nI ordered an El Macho, which is described as a pork belly torta.  Admittedly, this was chosen because I was feeling adventurous and kind of forcing myself to stray from comfort picks like Cuban or bahn mi sandwiches, but the idea of pork belly in a sandwich sounded like a good idea too.\\n\\nI'm not sure whether or not it was deliberate, or it was just not mentioned, but the pork belly had bones in it.  Now I can't tell if it were bone, soft bone, cartilage, or tidbits of pork so braised, they were hard as rock, but the bottom line is that I couldn't chew it, and was forced to spit out pieces of protein that I couldn't eat.  This is a massive turnoff to discover from a sandwich, something I should be able to eat entirely without worrying about extracting anything from my mouth mid chew.  \\n\\nThe chunks are also cut into these big cubes, rendering it kind of difficult to take a small bite and not pull an entire chunk out with it, resulting in a terrible disparity between bread and filler to succulent animal flesh.\\n\\nFurthermore the radish-onion salad within the sandwich was simply overpowering.  This is made worse when you take a bite, pull out an entire chunk of pork belly with a bone in it, and then have the next bite be just avocado and a very powerful radish/onion flavor.\\n\\nHonestly, I think I just made a poor decision with the sandwich.  I would highly discourage anyone from getting the El Macho, unless they really like radishes, and have teeth strong enough to devour bone.\\n\\nThe bacon potato salad I got on the side was pretty good.  That, I'd consider getting again; because sure, I'd give Villains another shot.  They have a Cuban sandwich, and I'm always on the prowl for a good Cuban sandwich, so it would be worth a second try.  But as far as first impressions go, overall I was pretty disappointed with Villains.\\n\\nOn a scale of mutant-hating bigot to Magneto, I'd have to rank Villians somewhere in between Toad or the Blob; interpret that however you wish, but I'm saying that that's completely underwhelming."},{"name":"Tin Shed Garden Cafe","address":"1438 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"This place was amazing.

There's velvet paisley all over the walls. Funny artwork that would not look out of place in a gaudy grandmary's penthouse. A clean cake tray prominently displayed on the counter. I have an unexplainable love of cake trays, as in, want to buy one for my kitchen despite the fact that zero cakes have been baked in said kitchen. Maybe I can put cigarettes on it. What's not to swoon over?\\n\\nWell, a few things. Dot's gets an E for effort. But there are too many \\"almost but not quite\\" instances, dining quirks that nearly work except that they don't. Like the utter absence of light, which is more than expected at night while sipping vanilla Stolis and sharing fries with a number of greasy fingers. But during the day, it's grungy in a place that doesn't come to its grunge naturally. And the hummus spread, which would be a thoughtful dipping sauce for the veggie slices that come with burgers, except for the fact that it's mostly cream cheese and the sticks get stuck in there without much dressing to show for the experience. My beef with the burgers themselves is that while they are chock full of meaty goodness the way a burger should be, Dot's uses the thinnest and most inconsequential buns that can't hold up the heft of the inner contents. Pet peeve alert: I think of the bread section of burgers as handles for the exciting stuff, so it bugs me when my handle begins to crumble after about three bites. \\n\\nI like that Dot's can substitute garden burgers for the cow kind, and I like that veggie options exist. I'll even give them a pass for the totally-not-Mexican Mexican menu they offer.

Extensive renovations by Owner Dylan Welsh, GM Sarah Hanson and Chef Aaron Parsons have transformed the space. With the kitchen now in the basement, Five Horses Tavern can seat 74 inside and 20 on their patio in good weather.\\n\\nThe redesigned space will give you pause upon entry. You'll first notice the new bar featuring 40 taps that seats 11 followed by a comfortable dining area filled with tables and booths. The decor has rich colors like hunter green walls, dark brown molding and exposed brick. The large windows facing Columbus Avenue helps to make the space feel open so the effect is more cozy than cramped.\\n\\nThe menu is exactly what I would like to see more of in the South End (and especially in SoWa). It is filled with comfort food created with a twist that makes it distinctly their own and priced so one can visit again and again. The lunch menu's most expensive item is $19 but most items range between $11 - $18.\\n\\nWe started with the Grilled Brie ($10), served with frisee, pomegranate seeds and honeyed almonds sprinkled with togarshi for additional flavor. The brie nicely spread over the lightly toasted bread, and I layered the frisee and almonds with the cheese to enjoy all the flavors and textures this plate offered.\\n\\nSergio ordered the Fried Chicken Sammy sandwich ($12) with a side of cheddar jalapeno mashed potatoes. The sandwich was bland and the wilted greens under the chicken were bland and the bun was slightly stale. I opted for the Tuna Tacos (3 for $16) served on flour tortillas with greens, jicama, avocado, and a blood orange chili glaze. These were far better. Upon biting into the taco I first tasted the blood orange glaze but the flavors of the seared tuna and shichimi dusting quickly follow. I loved the tacos and would recommend them.\\n\\nFive Horses Tavern is a neighborhood pub that serves and affordable food with a friendly and knowledgeable waitstaff. Our server, Richelle, proved to be very helpful which only enhanced what turned out to be a favorable first visit to Five Horses Tavern.

Yes, the menu is extensive and covers the spectrum of Shanghainese food must-haves: XLBs, hot and sour soup, dandan noodles, etc. It also doesn't hurt that this location can ride off the popularity of its sister location in Richmond. But the one HUGE tip-off that you need to adjust your expectations? The menu is in impeccable, descriptive and accurate English, complete with pictures.\\n\\nYes, you read that right. It was our ability to order exactly what we wanted off the menu, with no guesswork involved, that made me suspect that this place wouldn't be up to snuff. Sadly, I was right. \\n\\nOf the dishes we ordered - XLBs, pan fried pork dumplings, hot and sour soup, jellyfish, chilli wontons, braised pork with shaped buns, salted vegetable and pork noodles in soup, and rice - every single one was just, well, bland. And not just bland in the not spicy sense, but bland overall. The soup in the XLBs and the noodle soup was thin and watery, the pan fried pork dumplings was mostly dough, the hot and sour soup lacked both hot and sour, and the chilli wontons had no kick at all. The braised pork was passable only because you can't go too far off on a piece of fatty pork in a steamed bun. \\n\\nWith my menu-tip off in mind, I suspect that Dinesty Robson knows that it can get away with blander food because it's catering to a less discerning crowd than those who frequent the Richmond haunts. Shanghai River, Northern Delicacy, Chen's Shanghai Restaurant, and Dinesty Richmond all have this place beat by a mile. In fact, I blame the excellence of these Richmond places and places in Shanghai itself (yay Yang's Dumplings and Din Tai Fung!) for spoiling my expectations of Dinesty Robson. That being said, the dearth of any Chinese restaurants in downtown likely means that I'll be going back. Whether it's Shanghainese, Cantonese, Szechuan, or what have you...a Chinese restaurant has been a long time coming and everyone can rejoice that there's finally an alternative to Hon's, Victoria, and Wok n' Roll."},{"name":"Santorini Cafe","address":"11800 N Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Like the exterior, Santorini Cafe definitely has that homey vibe.

The gyro was PACKED with lamb, and I had a difficult time making room in my stomach for it all.  The lamb was seasoned well and was in large chunks.  It was great how well the tzatziki sauce brought the lamb and the pita bread together.\\n\\nThroughout the course of the meal, I was eying the Greek Beignets and was a bit disappointed that I wouldn't have room for it.

It's pretty easy to just sit and get lost in people watching at Ladd's Circle and counting the near-collisions between bikes and cars coming into the loop.\\n- Jasmine Lemongrass tea -- their tea selection is pretty excellent.\\n- PEANUT BUTTER PIE. I can go weeks without visiting Palio and it will still sporadically enter my brain.\\n- The back room: Especially in the evening, Palio is a wonderful place to get. Shit. Done. The back room has a wonderful ambiance that provides an exceptional atmosphere for plowing through homework, novels, or a frustrated NaNoWriMo session. I HIGHLY recommend sticking to the back room, though, as explained below.\\n\\nThings I really dislike about Palio:\\n- The weak coffee. I'm not the pickiest coffee drinker, but this is the only place I frequent where I will not purchase a coffee. The tea selection more than makes up for this inadequacy, but it is sad given that the rest of their menu is pretty excellent.\\n- I often forget this place is in the dead center of an extremely affluent neighborhood...that is, until the back room is full and I get a seat in front. Some conversations I've overheard sitting in the front included the woman who enjoyed firing 20-year-old nannies to help build their character, a woman who was so bored now that she married a man with so much money, and a discussion of the best pet therapists in town.\\n\\nSo...if you're looking for yummy tea and peanut butter pie in front of a pretty and serene park, come to Palio!
