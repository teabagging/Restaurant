We ordered the Hummus appetizer which was very good and proceeded to order a \\"Build Your Own\\" pizza as they've got the standard pizzas with a variety of toppings. Our choice of Feta, Spinach, Applewood smoked bacon, and Roma tomatoes was perfect, the dough is made differently than usual pizzerias with a more cornmeal flavor adding a sweetness. With the appetizer and a slice of pizza each, we were full and took home the pizza.

Yup, you can't make a dinner reservation here for 7 or 7:30 since they expect all people to spend 2-2.5 hours here when they come! Why?  Because it is a Spanish tapas style place! Hooray!\\n\\nI am a big tapas fine, and their menu here is not authentic tapas by any means, but they are straight up with telling  you that on their menu announcing  that they are taking a newer approach to tapas and they definitely do that. First, this place is awesome looking. Don't let the outside fool you, they have  a downstairs area too complete with bars on both floors, live plants growing off the walls, tall wine racks everywhere, fake doors installed on the walls of the stairwell, cool floating candle holders...the list goes on and on! They style it in a modern house like fashion since the B in the Casa B actually stands for Bonisse (sp?) which is the chef's grandmother I think is what they said--adorable!! So really cool decor.\\n\\nFood story wise, we started with the ceviche tabla which was supposed to have three kinds of ceviche but they ran out of the salmon one so gave us an extra lobster which is fine by me! And both the lobster and the hake ceviche were really good, served with yucca chips. You also get a free plantain chip and artichoke hummus like dip to start too, but the yucca chips won in my book. Their yucca brava were decent, but the cod fritters with that cilantro dressing by far were addicting. We could not get enough of those and I wish more than 3 came in an order! So good! The chorizo spiders with goat cheese were good, but definitely not the spicy chorizo we were hoping for. The avocado rolls were also bites full of goodness although they could have had a hair more avocado. BUT you have to get their tres leches cake. AMAZING. Cinnamon creamy goodness. Their creme brulee trio is also tasty, with the chocolate brulee being some of the richest chocolate you will get in a restaurant anywhere I bet!\\n\\nWe had such a good time here, and we will definitely be back. The menu is a little  limited meat wise and it can add up, but good thing they have paired up with some MIT people and have new ipad like credit card tablets that let you swipe your card at the table, split the bill by item or person or whatever, calculate tip, text you receipts, and wait for it...rate each of the dishes you ordered too!

I ordered from The Hanger (the originial \\"Wings over\\") so often, that 12 years later, I still remember their phone number.  That being said;  I ordered from Wing's over Somerville for the first time today, expecting what I had been accustomed to so long ago in Amherst.  The Wings in Amherst had awesome customer service, delivered when they said the would, and for the most part, remembered any extras you ask for.  Wings over Somerville, on the other hand, has awful customer service.  I placed my order online... I was only allowed to order one type of wing sauce, and was not able to order extra bleu cheese (which, I hate to admit, is my favorite part).  Ok, I can deal with that, since I only ordered the Hang Glider (DC-3 with fries and a drink).  What irritated me was that at 11:33 am I got a call telling me my food was here (I work in a 4 story building in Somerville, and had specified the 4th floor in 2 separate places when placing my order).  I asked the delivery person if they were on the fourth floor, he said \\"no, I'm downstairs and I'm not coming up\\".  I told him that I would be down in a couple of minutes.  I now had to get my keys from my desk so I could get back into my office suite and go down 4 floors.  I got on the elevator and walked out into the downstairs lobby at 11:36 am (3 minutes later), but there was no one in the lobby.  At that time, my phone started ringing again... it was the delivery person, asking where I was.  I hung up on him when I saw him standing outside, about 20 feet away from the door. I walked over to get my food, which he handed to me without a word, and without making any eye contact.  I was infuriated by all of this, because not only had I been charged a delivery fee, but I had also already tipped him since I had ordered online.  The food wasn't horrible, but it wasn't great either; definitely not what it was in Amherst.  \\n\\nI will never be ordering from this place again... It was an enormous waste of my time.  I order delivery a lot while I'm at work, because I don't have time to be running around.  In my opinion, Wings over Somerville only half delivered my order, which is unacceptable to me.

Also the driver only calls you once and if you don't answer, your out of luck. He will deliver it back to the shop. Then when you call the shop to try to get an understanding, they only offer you one of two things. 1. A refund or 2. Deliver you the already cold food.

Very clean and the layout is great. You're not sitting a foot from the next guy as he's stuffing food into his face.

They had the traditional fare (tuna, california, etc.) as well as specialty rolls (super crunch, lobster, oyster, etc.)They don't skimp on the fish either. Quality is what I would compare to Rusan's. It's decent and definitely hits the spot. They also had a very extensive row of asian inspired salads. Taste-wise was hit-and-miss. I didn't bother to try any of the hot foods cause it looked like standard buffet fare and I was there for SUSHI. There was a whole fried fish that I thought looked impressive. I did scratch my head a bit when I came to the end of the aisle and found FRIED CHICKEN. Guess they're trying to have something for everybody? They had a make-your-own-udon soup station. I'm not a big fan of udon, but my friend really enjoyed hers. The miso soup was awful. It was very watered-down and I couldn't finish it.

It came with a side of incredibly fresh romaine and purple cabbage mixture with a light but vibrant vinaigrette.  The eggs were cooked perfectly and the greens were room temperature which made a perfect pairing.  I opted for the $2 pancake-for-toast substitution, choosing a plain gluten-free pancake.  The MASSIVE pancake was perfect for sharing and light and fluffy with a great texture for a GF option.  DELISH!\\n\\nMy man Dan had the butternut squash, vegan sausage, coconut milk stew which was creamy goodness and very satisfying.  The portion looked small but it was hearty and rich.

The salad was dressed perfectly with a slight coating of dressing (not a large creamy gob like some places) & the parmesan was grated into these little balls, not the normal \\"shred\\".

Because kukai is \\"shit\\" in Hawaiian.  The corporate line justifying the name change reads, \\"we had to change our name because the French fashion label Kooka√Ø had a significant presence in the United States\\".  Perhaps, but that sounds like a little bull kukai to me.

This is a respectable bowl of noodles. I know because I have almond eyes, OK?  And I'm from LA, which has plenty of good ramen-yas.  \\n\\nThis bowl is not voluminous in size, merely adequate for a big guy like me.  Yet there are some good flavors here.  Sadly, I would avoid the miso, which seems to be rather one-dimensional and does not explode with umami, like proper miso should.  Instead, the shio broths are what you slurp on.  They are rich with collagen, dense and opaque - I'll bet it gels if you put it in the fridge.  But I never have enough leftover to bring home.  Tonkotsu shoyu ---- I'm down for that!  And the yuzu slots right in there.\\n\\nThey got some of the obligatory izakaya dishes like agedashi (fried tofu) and korroke, which is like a highly refined, super elegant McDonalds hash brown. There is takoyaki and gyoza.  The real shining star here is the chicken kara-age (pronounced kada ahh gay).  Big balls of chicken crispy on the outside yet tender and brimming with juice on the inside. Not your typical kara-age which is fried to the consistency and dryness of calamari.  You can get donburi, too!  But let's face it --- you come for the noddles.\\n\\nI personally liked the name Kukai.  It got my attention.  And this place did not become a laughing stock.

But grandma is no longer with us, so I'll tell you the not nice stuff. \\n\\nDo not stay at this hotel! It's dangerous. There are huge fire hazards in the stairwells. There are rolls of carpet and bits of construction material to stumble over. Oh, and the mercury-laden compact fluorescent lights are not protected, so if they break, guess what you'll be breathing as you try to escape the building.  \\n\\nIf there's no fire, there are other things to deal with. It doesn't seem as if the carpets have ever been cleaned, so there's a general stink. Indeed, the first room we were offered smelled as though someone had died in there last week. The (really very nice) desk clerk said, \\"oh, someone else said the same thing about the room next door.\\" A clue? \\n\\nThe room we ended up in had an amazingly small window (it didn't open) so the place was very dark and dingy, not helped by the dreary 1960s d√©cor.

We also shared the mixed vegetable platter appetizer comprised of  samosa, pakora and onion bhajiyah, all deep fried and a trifle too heavy/greasy.

Porterhouse cut, my favorite. Half filet and half NY strip, I believe you can never go wrong with a bone-in medium rare Porterhouse. We ordered the thick slices bacon as an appetizer and the sides we split a la carte with my birthday friends, who each ordered a dry-aged cowboy ribeye. We were all pretty excited about the jalape√±o cream corn, Brussels sprouts, mashed potatoes and mac and cheese.\\n\\nComplimentary bread was pretty good. The cheesy bread was delicious and warm, but the brown bread was a little meh for me...\\n\\nThe thickly sliced bacon was ok. The meat was tender, but it reminded me so much of the all you can eat cuts of marinated Korean BBQ pork belly... I don't know if that's worth $10.\\n\\nThe dry aged porterhouse was just enough for the two of us, although we didn't had huge appetites. The server brought us the steak and showed us the cook on the medium rare meat. Near the bone, we found later, it was nearly raw. Like, we couldn't chew the meat and it was cold. But that's the risk you run with bone-in steak... Different from the Bone's porterhouse where they remove the bone and the meat is cooked evenly throughout. \\n\\nJalape√±o cream corn and mac and cheese are the way to go. The cream corn had a great jalape√±o kick, and the corn wasn't just mush, as I have seen seems to be the trend of southern cooking. The Mac and cheese is light but still cheesy. The Brussels sprouts weren't bad, but they had me at bacon and mushrooms, which I didn't see much of throughout the dish. I was also hoping for a less soggy dish. The menu warned us in the description of the ingredients for the mashed potatoes that they only had \\"butter.\\" And that seemed to be the case here. Those mashed potatoes were super salty.\\n\\nI know some of the guys struggled with their dry aged cowboy ribeye. They were severely undercooked, but when they cut me a piece, it was tough and hard to chew. I wasn't too impressed with their meat, but I loved the filet portion of our porterhouse steak.\\n\\nNo complimentary dessert for birthdays, or so we thought until our server June brought us a small slice of chocolate cake to go. Thank you for the thought... The three birthday boys could share that one slice.\\n\\nI wasn't as disappointed in my meal as the boys were. My recommendation? Go ahead and make the plunge into the deep end and order the Dry Aged Steak for 2 or for 3, as the porterhouse cut is much better than the ribeye. I don't know if it was an off night or what, but the ribeye was pretty bad quality.\\n\\nKevin Rathbun's gave us a great attempt at a good dry-aged steak, but Bones is still number one in my eyes (and mouth and stomach)."},{"name":"Cuba 512","address":"6800 West Gate Blvd, Ste 112","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Everything was excellent.

I have heard Oregonians and Seattle locals talk left and right about this place and when I FINALLY went, WOWZERS! Every single dish was APOCALYPTIC in every good way possible. \\n\\nIf you like spicy, come here. I got a kick every time I took a bite and to save me from the danger of fire, either a special green or sauce was placed before me. I HIGHLY recommend the two dishes below and again. \\n \\nIke's Vietnamese Fish Sauce Wings - Spiced the bee jeebus out of me, but MY-OH-MY, the flavors were well marinated. It shot Ratatouille-like sparks in my mouth. I was only able to kill about three or four wings because the spice took over my tastebuds for minutes. I died for a moment....of happiness. \\n\\nMuu Paa Kham Waan - Boar collar rubbed in spices and came with mustard greens to balance out the spice. Boar collar is going to be my top five favorite meat because it's so juicy and tender the way they make it here. If I had a plate of boar collar meat, I'd willfully hand it to the chef at Pok Pok. \\n\\nMy other favorite dish was the Pet Pha Lo (Braised duck with mustard greens and 5-spiced soup). Every Asian restaurant has their version of a duck confit; this one was immersed in a 5-spiced soup which was neither spicy, nor tasteless. The meat fell right off the bone and the meat was flavored inside and out.  \\n\\nSticky Rice - the stickiness I love! \\n\\nSangkhaya Thurian - Sticky rice with durian coconut custard. I LOOOOOOOVE durian, so any restaurant with fresh durian is on my list. I've eaten durian in all forms, but the custard was amazing. Almost like a bread pudding, the smell and taste was all present. I'm positive the chef didn't use much durian in the mix, but just enough for the lovers to smell and taste it. This brings sticky rice desserts to a WHOLE new level. Seattle, hurry up and pick up on this! \\n\\nMango sticky rice - A different type of mango, this one was orange-ish color and both sweeter and juicier than the yellow ones I normally eat. I have seen this at nearly every Thai restaurant I've been to and I wish they sold those at the market. \\n\\nYou can see just from the wait at the door, how popular this restaurant truly is. They even have restaurants across the street advertising for their restaurant or even sub-serving their food. IT'S THAT GOOD! Service is fast and they know their food is filling, so they will wait a bit before they come by to take dessert orders. The restaurant is clean and has both inside and outside seating. Good for large groups if you arrive early enough and also has bar seating. \\n\\nIf you've been to Portland and haven't been here, you are missing out.

All I can say is it's not even close to the best Thai food in town, much less in the neighborhood. I crave all the amazing little joints in LA with zero interest in catering to non-Thai palates.

Chances are you will be mostly ignored or even treated rudely before or during your meal.  In fact, if you're read  reviews complaining about being treated horribly here, they are more true than false and I've witnessed a number of incidents myself (all minor).  If you're the least bit thick-skinned, and you don't insist on being fawned over, you will actually enjoy the semi-refreshing aspect of coming to a place where you KNOW they're not faking it.  Take away message:  Leave your ego in the wait line outside.\\n\\nSecond, do not come here for the warm, comfortable decor.  The place is small (seats 20 at most) and cramped.  You will wait in line.  If it's winter, you'll be cold outside and cold inside (unless parked at the table near the oven).  You will likely sit with one or two people you've never met or at a tiny table crammed in a corner.  But, oh the counterpoint: You sit only a few feet from the kitchen and the smells of garlic, fresh pasta and seafood is beyond compare.  Moreover, the cramped quarters make the experience ultra friendly if you're the least bit outgoing.  So this is the place to talk, have some (average to crappy) wine and just enjoy yourselves.  Interestingly, they've never rushed me there, so you can take your time and eat at whatever pace you want (obviously, with the line outside, we try to move things along somewhat to give others a chance to eat too).  \\n\\nSo now, having managed your expectations as to what to expect, let's talk about the food.  As I indicated in my review, I love this place.  It's right up there with my favorite Italian restaurants anywhere and I've been all over the US and Italy (and elsewhere).  So why only 4 stars?  Hard to say.  Mostly, I want to properly manage the expectations of those who do read this review.  Anyway, about the food:\\n\\nDon't expect unique, just delicious.\\n\\nThe pasta is tremendous and perfectly cooked.  The white sauces are crammed with garlic.  The fish is exceptional too - fresh and perfectly prepared.  I always get the same thing.  Broiled haddock with a side of pasta with red sauce (more like true Italian \\"gravy\\") and a perfect complement to the haddock.  In cooking the fish, the chef first pan sears the fillet and then lightly breads it and finishes it under the broiler.  Simple and perfect.\\n\\nAlso and perhaps something many overlook, everything is served to you in the pan meaning it's hot, fresh, and it stays that way for the entire meal - better yet, you can dunk the  Italian bread (mediocre but authentic) in your pan to soak up the garlic and oil which is nothing short of food heaven.\\n\\nSo bring your appetite and bring some money because at The Daily Catch they don't take kindly to you or anyone for that matter, and they don't take American Express...or Visa...or MasterCard...or any plastic.  IT'S CASH ONLY.  \\n\\nENJOY."},{"name":"The Daily Catch","address":"323 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Small venue with big flavors. This place did not disappoint.

I came with a group of 6 at 2PM on a Sunday afternoon and the wait was 1hr +. It's great that they just text you when your table is ready so you don't need to wait around. Given that it was in the triple digits that weekend in Portland I was more than happy to head to a taproom and sit in the AC with a drink.\\n\\nThe establishment has an indoor A/C'd area and the rest of the seating was outdoors. We were seated outside and boy was it humid. That's probably the one thing I wish they did was ask if we wanted to wait for an indoor or outdoor table.\\n\\n| FOOD | \\n\\n- Papaya Salad - Nice started dish that prepared us for the spicy to come. Can't really go wrong with this really. \\n\\n- Fish Sauce Wings - The raved about wings! I liked that the wings were large and had a sticky consistency on the outside. The flavoring was tasty but I think they were overhyped for what they were. I still would suggest getting them since they are yummy and great to share with people since you can decide if you want them mild or spicy. \\n\\n- Yam Wun Sen - These glass noodles are a sneaker! We don't even remember ordering this dish but we expected it to be sweeter but it was the opposite. After a couple bites my mouth was on fire but it a good way. The flavors meshed well together and although spicy it's one I think it popular here so def try it. \\n\\n- Kaeng Hang Leh - MY FAVE. This curry was recommended by our server and I'm so happy we listened. The meat was tender and absorbed all the flavor. There were tons of sauce that after put over the white rice was heaven.\\n\\n| DRINKS | \\n\\nWe also got the Mango Alexander, Southside, and Pok Pok Bloody Mary drinks which everyone in our group enjoyed. They all paired well with the dishes and the Mango Alexander in particular for the spicy ones. \\n\\nAfter my recent visit to Portland this place did not disappoint.

Ordering is a little tough, especially if the cashier isn't very helpful. \\n\\nPepper rice is rice with corn and green onion. Most of the dishes come with this. Then you can add other items like kimchi, fried egg etc (for a fee). \\n\\nWhen your dish comes out, it has a paper skirt around it telling you to mix your food so it can cook evenly. If you don't like crispy rice this is a good idea! It also comes with their two house sauces - a sweet teriyaki style one and a salty garlic spicy one. \\n\\nOverall, I liked the concept a lot. The portions are decent but not huge. The food is good. I think the person at the cashier station can be a little more helpful when new patrons are ordering.

I would also like to say that I have never seen guacamole that was the exact color of sweet peas and the consistency of emphysema lung phlegm before this.

When he recommended that we eat \\"family style\\" I remember thinking that family style ordering increases their profits.  When I asked about rice the guy said that there was only the amount of rice that goes with each dish.  We quickly discovered what that meant after we ordered one order of rice and they brought out a very small bamboo box containing perhaps 3 oz. of sticky rice.  I had about a tablespoonful.  I've been to many asian restaurants and most places will include the rice without charge and in large to unlimited quantities.  This was not one of those.  As you may know rice is only a few pennies a pound and sticky rice is just rice with a bit of vinegar.\\n    We almost ordered shots of whisky but did not; the prices were outrageous; $6 for an ounce of George Dickel, $11 for single malt scotch, etc.  We ordered three dishes and got not-enough food for four people.

I'm not sure if the other reviewers who excuse their under-employment as \\"artisinal\\" are familiar with any of the famous bars on which these drinks are based, but they are grossly under staffed.  \\n\\nIt is not acceptable in my opinion to ask someone to wait 20+ minutes for a drink in a bar which is less than 1/3 full.  I would excuse their slowness but for the fact that it has been the exact same situation each of the four times I've gone.  \\n\\nThat said, they make a truly fabulous drink.  I've tried at least 60% of the drinks in the \\"rum\\" section, and have found them head and shoulders above every other bar in Austin, excepting Congress. Their menu is carefully thought out, but does employ terms which are not necessarily in the vernacular of every customer, and I have a fairly broad familiarity with beverages and language in general.  I think they either need more complete descriptions or less stand-offish waitstaff.  I understand that K Wetherup believes that bar tending is a craft, not a social position, but I still think they could be a bit more...welcoming.  I think they need one more bartender and one more server so that their customers can receive a reasonable level of service\\n\\nSo I guess I love to hate this place.

So when the food came i was surprised to see a beef kabab on it. Yellow rice that came with it were microwaved and i could tell were old, but the real surprise came when i started on chicken kabab, it looked fine but was crisp as a rock, and completely dry inside, so much so that i had to drink lemonade to wash it down.

This restaurant recently opened and not too far from my home. It is located in a small shopping center with lots of parking. I walk in and quickly seated in a booth. Got a feeling from the d√©cor as if I was in a traditional Mexican restaurant and even the booth stated it was made in Mexico. I ordered water and a margarita, and started to explore the large menu. I quickly noticed they serve breakfast in location where most people usually head to work in the morning, but may be a great choice in picking up breakfast tacos for the workplace.\\n\\nAfter navigating the menu I decided to get a beef fajita taco plate.  My margarita showed up and it was huge, but not frozen which was fine with me.  It tasted very good and took my time drinking it. I also ordered a small bowl of queso where chips was already provided. The cheese was good and also had three very small bowls of salsa.  One was red (moderate), chunkier (mild) and green (extremely hot!). I tried all three and only the mild one I did not care about besides the green one. \\n\\nSoon my food arrived and very organized.  I got flour tortillas and began building my tacos.  It came with Mexican rice and refried beans. The food was excellent and was enough to fill me up.  It has a great atmosphere and the servers are nice. The pricing was also normal to this type of place, and not sure if they have a frozen margarita machine, but would not disappointed where at least mine was very good. As for bringing in kids, the booths seems t be designed for younger ones where each boot is enclosed by a nice cushioned chair.\\n\\nI'll be back to trying other items on the menu like enchiladas and steak."},{"name":"Rocking Frog Cafe","address":"2511 SE Belmont St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Great little homey cafe with the best donuts in town and a fireplace."},{"name":"Torchys Tacos","address":"4301 W William Cannon Dr, Ste G-400","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I've known about this place for years but just now had the chance to try it.

Mike had the Putanesca (black pasta with grilled shrimp), David had the halibut special, Steven had some normal dish like shrimp scampi and I had the Anglio Olio (ground squid on black pasta with garlic & olive oil). I had everyone try my dish and mine was hands down the envy of everyone on the table, I was soooo happy with my food that I enjoyed every single bite. I'm sure by the time we left that little hole in the wall (there were only about 5 tables total) my breath smelled of garlic and our clothes of everything that was pan-seared. This place is so tiny that the kitchen was literally a part of the space.

Don't be confused in thinking it's closed down because of the dark covered windows and look out for the neon \\"Open\\" sign on the door. In order to get one of the tables with the built in grills, you need to order a minimum of 2 entree BBQ meats. Three of us opted to do this and went with pork bulgogi and LA galbi. We also ordered a bowl of soondubu tzigae to share. Table space was really limited once they arrived with our meats, banchan dishes, rice bowls and steaming soondubu. Banchan selection was okay- less than I'm used to in NJ, but still decent. They came to refill these once throughout our meal. I was surprised an egg wasn't included to crack into the bubbling soup, but I'm guessing I could have asked for one. Despite our server asking if I wanted the soondubu just a little bit spicy and me emphasizing multiple times I wanted it very very hot and spicy, Korean spicy, I was disappointed it came out at spice level 0. The dish didn't taste bad, it just lacked any spice. The flavor of the BBQ meats made up for this though. Each meat packed a punch of flavor. The raw meat plates were conveniently served with a pair of scissors and a basket of lettuce to wrap up little balls of deliciousness to pop in your mouth. We asked the waitress to switch our grill plate when we switched meats. Overall the food was pretty good and service was quick.

Next time I might ask for double the greens, as it the regular salad base is maybe a handful of spring mix\\n- Salads are not tossed - this is kind of annoying, since the dressing is not spread and if you're eating in there's no way to shake it.

It's all about Thai street food here and it lives up to the hype. I've always wanted to check this place out and finally had the time and money to do so on Monday night. \\n\\nDining by myself, I had zero wait time. They walked me right up to my seat at the bar...which meant I just HAD to explore the drink menu, or so I'm tellling myself. The basil limeade (with vodka) was one great cocktail. I had to restrain myself from ordering another and all of it's friends off the drink list. I'll be back...with someone to drive me home.  \\n\\nI had great service the entire evening. The bartender gave great recommendations and was extremely attentive. Be aware that it's really dark in here. I had to read the menu by the light of my iphone. \\n\\nI chose to go with the Khao Soi Kai (curry noodle soup) and the famous Ike's Fish Sauce Wings (ordered \\"spicy\\"). Let me just say that I HATE chicken wings. I hate eating any kind of meat with bones, skin and dreaded tendons. However, I just couldn't resist ordering them here. I feel like that says a lot. They were so flavorful - like savory candied wings. Note: they're huge wings and there's really no polite way to eat them. You'll get messy and sticky, but maybe that's part of the fun? \\n\\nThe soup was amazing. It was a large bowl of fragrant curry soup with delicate coconut milk, noodles, chicken and topped with crunchy noodles. It came with a side plate of goodies to add as you pleased (pickled cabbage, shallots, cilantro and roasted chili paste). Next time, I'll order it vegetarian because a) I can, and b) I'll have had enough bones and tendons to deal with from the wings. \\n\\n It was the best Thai food I've ever had and possibly one of the best meals I've ever had.

Second, out of nowhere the lady procceds to tell me her business is struggling because everybody want meat but it is costly to her. I didn't pay too much attention to that but I was happy to help out. I walked back to my hotel, took a bite and....ewwww?! what is this????! I peeled off the cheese and then realized the buffalo chicken is in fact buffalo potatoes!!!!!! large chunks of POTATOES...not a single piece of chicken. I was furious so I called the number on the box and the lady answers. I told her I came in and got the buffalo chicken with no chicken and she says oooh the buffalo potatoes and chicken??? um, you didn't mentioned potatoes before you said 3 kind of meat lovers...then she goes oh sorry maybe I forgot to tell you there are potatoes on it...straight BS.

The side of green chile cheddar grits that we ordered as a side were better than these grits but I know I won't have second thoughts about getting grits next time I'm here. 5/5\\nThe pan fried chicken almondine was the other favorite dish of the night. It was fried to perfection and so juicy! (Maybe it's because I loved this dish so much that I didn't enjoy the chicken fried steak as much.) The capers and lemon buttery sauce drizzled on the chicken really brought out the flavor of this dish and the garlic mashed potatoes was a good item to pair with this dish. 5/5\\nThe chicken fried steak was ok.

So, when my friends were looking for a good Chinese place to eat, I immediately suggested Din Ho from my previous experience.  Little did I expect that they treat their normal patrons during the day differently than private parties that rack up a huge bill and very generous tip.  \\n\\nThe first time, I came in with several Caucasian friends, and the server only talked to me.  He would ask me what to order for everyone.  For an establishment that is so popular, I was surprised the server would behave like that.  We didn't realize we came in so close to closing, but because there were a few tables still eating, we didn't rush.  But, our server did seem peeved we were taking our time, and he brought out our check as soon as our food were served.  He never returned until we put our credit cards down.  2 of the friends didn't like their food, and said they won't be returning again.  I personally did enjoy my food, so that was deserving of some stars.\\n\\nThe second time, I came in for a date with my husband during Saturday late lunch.  The place was crowded, but not packed to the brim, and there were many servers on staff.  After being seated with our menus, we waited 10 minutes before we got water.  Then we never saw that server again.  It was another 10 minutes before we were able to flag someone down to take our order, but she rushed off to look for a server to do so.  We then watched and waited as we saw several servers talking and trying to figure out who to take care of us.  Finally a waiter comes over and takes our order.  My husband specifically asked if they had the General Tso's Tofu, and if so he'd like to order it.  It's a very popular dish, but not on Din Ho's menu.  The server mumbled something to himself as he wrote it down, and left.  We waited 20 minutes before our food arrived, but what my husband received was General Tso's Chicken.  He told the server he ordered Tofu, and the server flat out said, \\"we don't have that\\" and walked off.  We were not happy that my husband had asked if they had it and the server didn't refute or correct him, then assumed he wanted chicken.  We were not happy that the server rudely dismissed our shock and dashed off.  We flagged down another server and told her the problem.  She replied with, \\"General Tso's Chicken is very good.  Why you have problem?  You should eat it.\\"  She didn't give us an option to send it back to order something else.  What if my husband was vegetarian?  (He's not, but he really would have been happier order another tofu dish)  To avoid further drama, we finally accepted the problem and just asked her for silverware and chopsticks as our table had none, so we can eat the food we did not order.  And at the end of our meal, we had to flag someone down for the check, and wait an additional 10 minutes before we got the doggie bags we asked for.  \\n\\nMaybe we're being too demanding expecting services that a normal operational restaurant should be offering.  Maybe my stories sound so ridiculous that they almost sound contrived.  But I've worked restaurant part-time for more than a decade, so I sympathize with servers, and this situation is just plain bad in all ways.  I'm not saying Din Ho's food isn't worth their $$ two dollar signs price tag, but for $$, I would have expected the service to reflect that!  There are fast food places that have cheap food and doesn't take tip that has consistent exceptional customer service, compared to this sit down restaurant that serves lobster and expects you to tip 20%.  \\n\\nTL; DR: 2 stars purely from food.

And I can't wait until the day I can proudly say I have.\\n\\nWhat's great about Powell's is that you can: \\n\\na) spend a whole day in there quietly by yourself perusing every - and I do mean EVERY genre of book.  Most of which you've not conceived of - which makes it more beguiling.  For the chocolate lava cake of treats, check out the rare book room.  \\n\\nb) spend a whole day in there peoplewatching.  Oh yeah.  It's awesome.  And you'll go largely unobserved - it's like all those rows of books are a blind.\\n\\nc) spend a whole day on a date in there.  What better way to learn something about your mate/potential mate than to see what literary treasures they are drawn to?  My favorite text exchange happened here - it went: (him) where are you? (me) Powell's. (him) what section? (me) I'm in the military history section researching Korean military uniforms from 1920-1945. (him) that is the hottest thing I've ever heard a woman say. I'll be right there.\\n\\nd) get your kids addicted.  I've seen me do it.  When I was a kid, all I could do is wait for my next time to get a McDonald's Monopoly game piece from a trans-fat laden pile of twice-fried McNuggets.  Now, my offspring are constantly asking to go to Powell's for new books.  I dig that immensely.  Better than my love of McNuggets, which I grew out of in 1981.  I never grew out of Monopoly."},{"name":"Soto South Lamar","address":"1100 S Lamar Blvd, Ste 2115","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Had Soto South roll and it was delicious.

The Nook has most of the trappings of a sports bar with multiple flat panel TVs, a large covered patio, a large bar including 13 beers on tap, and food offerings that are mostly organic and locally grown.\\n\\nWe arrived at the Nook about 10:00 PM and by this time I believe we were about done with drinking. The interior was very tavern-ish and reminded me of some of those bars/pubs you see in Daytona Beach - flashback city! We set up shop on the patio in front of a huge TV and ordered drinks and snacks including two fishbowls and two different tater-tots.\\n\\nThe Fishbowl is a whole gallon of mixed drink served in a spherical, clear \\"fishbowl\\" plastic bucket, served with multiple \\"jumbo\\" straws so a group of 4-6 can all share in the same drink. We ordered two different, one was tart and citrusy and the other was more like a vodka/cranberry. These were way over the top and really, it was much more alcohol than what we should have attempted.\\n\\nWe also ordered two different tater-tot dishes that the Nook calls \\"Totchos\\" - the Nacho Totchos and the Buffalo Chicken Totchos. The food was quite good and the service fantastic. We sat for a bit and I tried like hell to finish one of those fishbowls (the tart one) - I managed to drink about half before being too full to continue.\\n\\nIn all, loved the place, the atmosphere and service.

This is the spiciest Thai food I've ever had, but it wasn't in such a way that killed the flavors for me. Again I'll say I loved the combination of flavors, but I feel like I could get these things just as good but at separate places.

She told us the wait was about ten minutes but those ten minutes felt so long -- since there was no heater outside. \\n\\nWe got called in about 10-15 minutes later. The inside of the restaurant is small. It has a handful of small and large tables and small L shaped bar. Our waiter came by and was super friendly. The menu didn't have any curries, pad thai or anything you would see at a traditional thai place however after reading reviews we opted for the papaya salad, the spicy wings and some sticky rice (recommendation from the waiter). The food took about 10-15 minutes because it wasn't too busy.\\n\\nThe wings were good. However, they weren't spicy. When I see chili peppers next to an item on the menu, I expect spicy. However, this dish wasn't anywhere near spicy. It was more salty if anything. Also on top of that, only six wings were served. The papaya salad was refreshing but it was a small portion. Also, I found the sticky rice to be bit forgetful. The sticky rice wasn't sticky but was hard... tasted like day old rice. Altogether, our meal was about $30 and I didn't think the food tasted like a $30 meal. The wings were expensive, the rice was forgetful and the papaya salad was too small. I should've felt satisfied after that meal, but I left hungry. \\n\\nThey also have a location in Chinatown in LA, however I don't think I'll be stopping by that location. \\n\\nTL;DR -- The food is overpriced, parking is hard and the restaurant is small.

I was there last Saturday, celebrating a bday and valentines day. I understand it was busy, but from the time of reservation, it was a disaster. After booking the reservation and calling twice to ensure they understood that a birthday was being celebrated. And they still didn't acknowledge it at the restaurant. The second time I called to confirm the birthday I asked if I could add two to my reservation, the very rude hostess said no. I asked her why, she said because they switched out all of the 4 tops to 2 top tables and there was absolutely no room. I arrived 15 early, and was sat in a decent amount of time. However, I was sent to the wine cellar, a nice way of calling it a basement......at a four top table, which I was told wouldn't happen. The table was too close to the stairs. they didn't offer any alternatives. After getting tired of hearing the staff stomp up and down the steps and watching another couple get a choice of where they wanted to sit (upstairs or downstairs) I asked the hostess if I could switch to sit upstairs, she needed to consult with someone else. That lady explained that the wine cellar was nice. I told her it no longer was an option. Ron was my server, really nice guy, got everything right with the order. The food is always amazing as usual.

Jonathan W. and I went to Moonshine at 10am for Sunday brunch and found it spectacular.  When we arrived, a crowd was milling around outside the doors, but right after 10am, the hostesses started calling names and seating people, and everybody got in fairly quickly.  (You do need to tell the hostess your name when you arrive.)  When we left, the wait looked like 30-40 minutes, so I recommend getting here right when they open.\\n\\nMoonshine offers a variety of seating options, some outdoors, some indoors.  Outdoors is probably better as you don't have to hear the bustling crowd in the buffet lines. Actually, that might apply all the time because I ate dinner indoors back in August and found the restaurant unpleasantly loud, maybe a result of the hard floors and stone walls.  Air conditioners are set up outside, and there's plenty of shade, so the patio probably remains comfortable year round.  I noticed another building just north of the main restaurant.  It seemed to be filled with brunch eaters, but looked like something you might be able to reserve for special occasions.  This would make a nice venue for a special event, as it is a historic building made of attractive cedar and limestone.   \\n\\nThe brunch buffet ($15.95/person) consisted of a wide variety of delectable options: sausage, roasted new potatoes, migas, scrambled eggs with sausage, scrambled \\"green eggs\\" with pesto, \\"steak and eggs\\" omelette, biscuits and gravy, quiche, chile cheese grits, mini bagels with cream cheese, salmon, mini turkey pesto croissants, king ranch casserole, steak fingers, chicken tenders, broccoli casserole,  salad, fresh fruit, muffins, waffles, bread pudding, cinnamon rolls, and more!  Coffee is available for $1.95, and I recommend it.  The coffee is a flavorful, dark roast, and the servers do a good job of keeping the cups full.\\n\\nDinner at Moonshine is also a special treat.  My parents took us here to celebrate my birthday in 2007.  I enjoyed the pork tenderloin ($15), which had an interesting sweet, spicy sauce with it.  My dad didn't leave a bite of his buffalo meatloaf ($15), and my mom raved about almond encrusted chicken with artichoke sauce ($12).  I tried a bite, and even though I don't like artichoke, that dish tasted awesome.  Jonathan W. had the flat-iron steak ($20), the least impressive of the items we ordered.  It just didn't have a great texture, kind of tough, really.  Each item came with vegetables and your choice of side.  Even with no salad or dessert, we all left VERY full and satisfied.\\n\\nMoonshine earns my highest recommendation anytime, but especially for brunch.

Big google images of otters with teeny tiny font of the food, no descriptions and many prices sharpied out. \\n3) Food - Expensive for mediocre bar food. Nothing unique, fresh or exciting here. Their cuban is ham, turkey, swiss, pickles and GUACAMOLE... so that's unique. It said it was served with black beans and rice. After it arrived with fries, we asked for the black beans and rice. They took the whole plate, and 8 mins later, a cold cuban with microwaved yellow rice and dog food looking red beans arrived. My aunt took one bite and lost her appetite. When the owner came over b/c she sent it back for good, he had an attitude. Kept saying how they sell so many of these. No apology, just finally agreed to take it off the bill. \\nNothing else was worth a mention. Dry burger, tasteless wrap, greasy melt. The fried fish was ok. All so expensive for what you get.  \\n4) Bathroom - So there is 1 men's and 1 woman's bathroom outside. Now, this place is probably hopping on the weekend and I'm sure those bathrooms get dirty with wet, drunk people everywhere but this is a Tuesday @ noon and the place is practically empty.

I love dishes that are chewy (raisins) while crunchy (almonds) and sweet yet grainy which was really satisfying.  My chai alive was so good that I drank it within the first 5 mins, so my only regret is that the drink is too small and I wish they made it in a bigger size.

The estimate was 25 min and after waiting 35 min and still no call, I went inside to find out they'd marked us off the list for 'no response.' Turns out the pager they gave me wasn't working and no attempt to just call out our name was made. Then we finally get to our table and the music was ridiculously loud. They were unwilling to turn it down, and if we wanted to sit outside, we'd have to wait all over again. The food was okay today, but the drinks were awful (tea and soda were no good). We didn't do alcohol so maybe that's why they didn't care about us in general (had to ask for silverware, napkins, ketchup, etc.). I would've been okay with all of this as I know things can get hairy when it's busy, but it just seemed like they didn't care to try to remedy anything from the start.

On there website it advertised a late night menu that started at 10:00pm and that it was also 3$ pizza night. We were pumped because we were just five minutes away. Too bad we weren't even in the building for more than a min. We walked in and there was two employees sitting at the bar and one standing behind it. All three were watching a movie on one of the bar tvs, (weird). As we got closer to them we asked if they were still open and not one of them even turned in our direction. Again we asked and no answer or even a head turn. Now sitting at the bar the bartender turned and rudely said, \\" I need Id's\\" (oh hey, you can talk). Gave her our id's and asked for the late night menu too witch she replied \\" No, everything in the kitchen has already been shut off\\".  So we told her thanks anyway were looking to eat because we moved all day and we're starving. Rolling her eyes \\"are you sure\\" she says. So my sister and I quicky discuss our next move. Now watching her movie again she says \\"so are you leaving or no?\\".  As we made our way out I said thanks anyway and she ignored me and said nothing. Again THANK YOU...nothing. Now furious with her BLATANT disrespect, my sister loudly repeated THANKKKK YOUUU... (and I'm not kidding you) she said nothing!!!! \\nOkay, okay I get it no one wants late night customers after a slow or busy day they want to go home.

Its literally your JOB to be nice, polite and provide a service. Your kitchen is closed down for the night... fine. Been there done that (there's nothing better than unexpectedly closing early or whatever). All this being said maybe next time you decide to treat your \\"late-night\\" customers like they are stupid (and or an inconvenience) for just walking in the door, you should keep in mind your website that offers a 10:00pm \\"late-night\\" menu and a promotional pizza night.

The tea was great and just the perfect relaxing cup you need after gorging yourself.

For our last entree we had the Catch of the Day absolutely delicious and not overcooked, though when we had this dish the couscous was drowned in the sauce making it inedible.

We ordered an appetizer of chips and guacamole; I ordered the bravo pork, and my girlfriend got the chiles rellenos.\\n\\nWhat we liked:\\n- Both of the main dishes were good - my girlfriend enjoyed her chiles rellenos, and I thought the bravo pork was (pardon the pun) quite well-done. Both dishes were full of flavor, the pork was juicy and still had a bit of fat dripping off of it (which I like), and the hand-made tortillas that came with the dishes were pretty good - we actually finished all 8 of the tortillas that they gave us!\\n- The green chili sauce - I don't know what was in it, but damn it was good - full of fresh green chili taste, and complemented both the pork and the chiles rellenos very well.\\n\\nWhat we didn't like:\\n- Though the food was good, it was nothing spectacular or mind-blowing (with the exception of maybe the green chili sauce). Everything was very solid, nothing we had was bad, but nothing blew us away, either.\\n- Service was a bit slow. There was only one waitress working, and, though she was very friendly, she wasn't around a lot and we couldn't flag her down for the initial glass of water.\\n- The guacamole was good, definitely home-made, but the serving size was very small. For the $6 or $7 (I can't remember) that it cost, it wasn't worth the money.\\n- The menu stated that the bravo pork came with fried jalape√±os, fried onions, and pico de gallo; I didn't have any of those three things with my bravo pork, only pickled jalape√±os, rice and beans, and tortillas. I didn't have the menu on-hand to double check at the time so I couldn't call over the waitress to ask about it, unfortunately.\\n\\nOverall, we thought that everything was good, though slightly overpriced. Hillsboro is not lacking in good Mexican places (Hermanos Ochoa, for example), and this place is just a little below some of them in my preferences. Again, I'd have liked to give a 3.5-star review; a 3-star review would have been unfair to the quality of the food, so I went with 4 stars.\\n\\n(Sorry for the poor quality of the pictures - the decor and lighting of the place all skew yellow!)"},{"name":"Commonwealth Restaurant and Market","address":"11 Broad Canal Way","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"I went back after the owner responded and the service issues and time to serve we're gone.

Food is such an evil hypnotist that way.\\n\\nYou really can't miss this orange building, with a tall roof-like portion to it. The inside feels like a festive Mexican restaurant. A flat-screen TV plays Spanish programming. There's a place near the counter with a bunch of Mexican candy/goodies for sale.\\n\\nI got the Super Burrito ($6.25): choice of meat, pico de gallo, sour cream, lettuce, cheese, beans, rice, and guacamole. I nixed the sour cream and chose lengua (beef tongue) for my protein. An extremely thick burrito awaited me. I'm no expert on guessing burrito weight, but it had to be over two pounds. Maybe closer to three.\\n\\nI've never had lengua prior to this, and boy, was it a great choice. Very tender and moist, seasoned well. The refreshing lettuce and pico de gallo helped offset the more filling beans and guacamole. The Spanish rice was cooked very well. Nice steamed flour tortillas somehow kept the filling inside this thick beast. They also have habanero salsa as a condiment option. Nice spice for a heat-seeker like myself!\\n\\nI'm a big breakfast burrito fan, and if I'm ever down there again, I'll consider their breakfast burritos. The regular is a very reasonable $3.99, containing cheese, two eggs, hash browns, and meat (ham, bacon, or sausage). The super breakfast burrito is $6 and contains all the meats PLUS chicken fried steak, mushrooms, onions, and peppers.\\n\\nAside from the usual tacos, quesadillas, and tortas, Casa del Sol also offers huevos rancheros, sopes, chiles rellenos, and Mexican breakfast plates. All reasonable prices, in my opinion.\\n\\nAre you a person who can pack away a serious amount of food? Take on their Man v. Food Carne Asada Kilo Challenge. It's a kilo (2.2 lbs) of carne asada, an order of beans and rice (basically a large plate of each), ten tortillas, and salsa. If you want, you can opt to do double order of rice or double order of beans instead. There appears to be no stated time limit, although I could be wrong on that.\\n\\nIf you finish, the meal is free, you'll get a free meal for your family or friends, and your pic will go on their wall of \\"Kilo Champs.\\" Fail, and your pic will go on the wall of \\"Kilo Chumps\\" -- and your wallet will be much lighter. As of early August, only two winners in 14 attempts.\\n\\nWill I try? Hell no. I know my role these days: stick to normal amounts of ridiculously spicy food and love it. But my competitive eating buddies would easily nuke this challenge. It probably would be a matter of whether they would smash the house record (whatever time that is).\\n\\nBut yeah, I liked my burrito here. It wasn't life-changing, but hey, still great.

It looked kind of dumpy on the outside, which is sometimes a good sign.  It was, because as soon as my feet met the plastic screened in entrance, I was served most efficiently.  We were seated right away in a small, cozy booth, greeted immediately by our waiter, and instantly disappeared into the eclectic and unpretentious atmosphere.  We ordered two salads.  The waiter recommended the salad with fried egg, thank goodness, because it was outstanding.  Amazing how flavors one would never suspect would mesh nicely together, did.  The Pok Pok papaya salad was ok, but not one I would order again.  My friend ordered Ikes fish sauce chicken wings, and apparently he could eat them for the rest of his life, so I conclude that they were good.  Overall, all 3 out of the 4 dishes were outstanding.

Food - 4 stars. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 for food was because one of our dishes was very bland.  To set the scene...party of 7, Wednesday evening.  Restaurant was crowded but it's a small place so it doesn't take much.  Seated promptly.  Staff very friendly.  I love the Grandpa that walks around randomly and sparks up random conversations with folks.  He's great!  I was craving and eyeing a pasta dish on the menu (linguine, clams, garlic and cream sauce) but am not a fan of clams so was anxious to speak to the waiter and see if I could sub chicken.   When he did come and told us the specials I became torn because a slow roasted ox tail dish with carrots, onions and celery sounded delish!  Luckily DL agreed to order one and I the other so we could share and try them both.  Unfortunately they had NO chicken in the entire house so I opted for no meat and added vegies (oddly though I was charged $4 for adding vegies even though I chose the dish sans clams).  Pasta was bland and the \\"garlic and cream sauce\\" seemed to be missing the cream.  Was more a buttery garlic sauce.  Tried to doll it up with salt and parmesan cheese (which was very nice and fluffy btw) and that helped.  OX TAIL was to DIE for~  Lots of bone and not enough meat but it was oh-so-tender, fell off the bone and the vegies melt-in-your-mouth with tons o'flavor.  Could have had 3 of those~  \\n\\nAll in all it was a good experience and I'll def go back.  Keep an eye on those waiters who keep refilling the Italian butter.

The place was busy and packed.  We had part of the upstairs mezzanine area, there were other groups up there too.\\n\\nSo let me explain why the 1 star.  I would have given a 2 star or 2.5 star before, for their good beer but what the waitress said to us totally killed it.  Because we had a large group, it's an automatic 18% gratuity which I wouldn't have mind too but again, the waitress ruined it.  \\n\\nSo first, we ordered our food.  Most of us got our food but a couple of friends waiting over 45-55 minutes for their food.  They had asked about it a couple of times. The waitress came and said sorry, it went to another table and that she'll talk to the manager about getting a discount for their food (1 item).  That did not happen as the manager didn't know (mentioned later on).  Strike 1.\\n\\nNext, after we ate, we were all chatting and having fun.  The waitress comes up to us and says \\"you want your bills, you all look tired\\".  We were so shocked that she said that, that we all looked at one another, thinking \\"WTF, did we hear that right?\\".  We were chatting, laughing, catching up and some of us still had our drinks.  How does that translate to looking tired.   Strike 2.\\n\\nWhen the waitress brought the bills, my friends asked about the food item that the manager was supposed to look at. ( This was how we knew the manager didn't know ).  After the waitress and my friend discussed it for a few minutes, she says \\"Remove it? but you ate it!\\" with a smug look and whispers something else under her breath.  We couldn't hear the exact words she said after but we were so offended with her attitude and demeanor.  He said \\"Remove it!\\".   She could have said \\"let me check with the manager\\" and actually check with the manager or have the manager come.  My other friend asked for the manager to discuss it.  Manager came and my friend talked to her.  We did tell her that the Steel Toad beer and some other items were good.  My friend and manager did talk further about the situation. \\n\\nAnother friend didn't even get her food at all.  She asked about it.  We were there for about 2.5 hrs and she still didn't get it. She was told it should be out shortly.  How do you forget an order, even after being asked about it????  At least this one wasn't charged but my friend left hungry since she didn't get her food. Strike 3.\\n\\nThe waitress organized the orders by name to know who ordered what. Our group, there wasn't any duplicate names.  We'd watch the food runners come up with the food since we were hungry.  Still somehow two friends' food went somewhere else and one friend didn't get her food at all.\\n\\nI've never had a server tell my friends and I that we looked tired, when we're laughing and chatting with one another.   I've never had a server argue so much and give so much attitude.  We weren't the only group up there either.  \\n\\nHave you ever had a server tell you and your friends that you all looked tired while you're laughing and chatting?  What about forgetting your whole order?  What about giving attitude and whispering under their breath?  If you want to experience all this, go to Steel Toad with a group. \\n\\n\\nOTHER:\\nThe food was average.  My friend's salad had a lot of salt. She mixed it up too, in case the dressing was in one spot but there was still an area that was extremely salty.  It was a kale and scallop salad so not sure why they would need salt.  \\n\\nThe JFC (Japanese Fried Chicken) was bland.  The sauce that came with it wasn't good.  There is a lot more potato chips than JFC.  \\n\\nI had the pulled pork sandwich, was dry and not a lot of flavour.  The sauce for it was bland and I thought it was supposed to be coleslaw in it to but was mostly carrot strips. \\n\\nI had a couple of drinks: mojito and a rum & coke.  They used crushed ice so the drinks tasted watered down or you are drinking crushed ice instead of the drink.  It was more like a slushy than a mojito. That crushed ice melts so quickly that it waters down the drink.   If you get a drink, ask for it with ice cubes, not crushed ice.  I didn't want a slushy.  Maybe I should have said \\"mojito on the rocks\\" instead of just \\"mojito\\".\\n\\nI'm pretty easy going and would try a place a couple of times before reviewing but the bad service, attitude and average food, I won't be back here.  \\n**"},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"My daughter and I had brunch there this morning.

They have many interesting dipping sauces, and all the flavors are bright and extremely well balanced. The Thai iced tea was different from the many times and places I've had it in the SF Bay Area. This was more subtle, less sweet, and I liked it a lot. The dessert with ice cream made with evaporated milk and coffee poured over it was fabulous.

I am not exaggerating either."},{"name":"JW Marriott Orlando, Grande Lakes","address":"4040 Central Florida Pkwy","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"For the most part, this hotel was excellent.  \\n\\nRoom - 5 stars\\nFriendliness of staff - 5 stars\\nAmenities - 5 stars\\nCleanliness - 5 stars\\n\\nEverything was immaculate, everywhere we went.  However, the experience wasn't perfect, and here's why I can't give it the 5 stars I so wish I could: the service was only good, not excellent.  Although the staff was incredibly friendly, they always seemed to be shorthanded.  It could take a while to get service.  I know that's a nit-picky item, but I have expectations of the JW Marriott and the Ritz Carlton (a shared property), and when they fail at that service, then in my mind, they have let me down. I'll give a few specific examples:\\n\\nI never had a good drink there.  I ordered a mojito at both Primo and at a lobby bar at the Ritz, and both times, the drink was just undrinkable - at Primo because I simply didn't like their version (not a fan), and at the bar in the lobby of the Ritz (same property) because it was just incredibly bad.  \\n\\nAlso at the lobby bar in the Ritz (as well as at the bar in the lobby of the JW Marriott), it was incredibly tough to get service. A server would walk by only every 20 or 30 minutes or so to check in.  I'd finish eating and just sit there ... waiting.  They were obviously short handed.  For the meal at the lobby bar at the Ritz, I had the filet burgers with regular fries.  The filet burgers were delicious, but the fries were some of the nastiest fries I've ever had.  I also had a strawberry daiquiri by the JW Marriott pool, which had practically no alcohol (if it had any) in it.  You don't have to make the drinks strong - you just have to make them right.  The chicken strips and fries out by the pool, however, were fine. Fried pool food, and decent, as one would expect.  \\n\\nTheir lazy river pool is very cool, and a great way to relax. There are a lot of kids there, though (as expected), but you can always pack up and move to a more secluded spot - one of the great things about the pool area.  However, there should be a way to pay a little extra in order to find A) more comfy chairs to layout on, and perhaps B) a quieter place to relax with fewer kids. And they DO have that - at the spa. There are much more comfortable chairs by the pool at the spa, and it's much quieter.  HOWEVER, once again, the service at the spa was only good, not excellent.  For example, there were 9 people laying out by the Spa pool, and yet it still took 30 minutes for someone to come by and give me a menu. The next day I went, someone met me at the gate of the pool, walked me to a lounge chair, prepared the chair for me with towels (finally - THIS is the service I was expecting). But then I never saw them again, even though I said I'd like to order something soon and there were only 4 people laying out by the pool that day.  I want to make it clear - at no time during our lengthy stay on the property was anyone ever NOT friendly.  The staff were all incredible, and very busy.  It was obvious that the reason the service was lacking was because they were shorthanded.  I would ask for a check, and it would take 10 minutes to get it, or longer.  On another visit, there were no dry towels in the Spa's main bathroom, and the dirty towel bin was filled, which told me that no one had serviced the bathroom in some time (I dried my hands by the pool before going back to the restaurant to eat).  Also while at the spa, they ran out of water at the men's section. I waited to see how long it would take to be filled - over an hour.  The men's locker room and shower areas would be pristine in the mornings, but showed their wear by the afternoon (towels in the showers not replaced, overflowing garbage cans filled with cups, water everywhere and never mopped up).  Service seemed to depend on the day, some days the bins would be emptied, other days they wouldn't.  \\n\\nAgain, these are little things, but they're the types of things that a 5-star resort should have or at least should aim for.  They have a great property, and a great staff - why wouldn't they want to be 5 stars?  This whole property has everything it needs to be the best - it just needs perhaps a few more hands on deck."},{"name":"Piazza Italia","address":"1129 NW Johnson St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Go to Italy if you want better! Just got home from a  wonderful meal with my wife and 3 year old daughter. This place is the real deal. From showing Italian football on the television screens to speaking in Italian to each other to the food, this place is a real as it gets in the states. We had the oso bucco and boar with their homemade pasta and both were excellent. Just as I've had in Italy. The restaurant itself is sort of an eclectic combination of classy/casual which is fun.

I'm playing a hunch that they'll be excellent too.\\n\\nAlso, there were a few reviews that dinged the service pretty bad. Based on our 1 visit, we had almost too much service with someone circling and asking if we needed anything or delivering something. I'm guessing it was a couple of off nights for the servers for those reviewers. I'd feel the same way as they did for sure but again, in our one visit, it was excellent.

They have free wi-fi in their cafe area, but it's best to get there early (and on a weekday, if possible) so you can get a good spot (or a spot at all).

Within the first month of settling down here, there was only 1 restaurant that has been repeatedly recommended to my husband and I from both friends and family alike in the area. Life Alive! So curious to check out this holy Mecca that so many have sworn we must try, we bundled up and walked the 20 minutes in 17 degree weather last night to have our minds blown. Alas, the food did NOT disappoint. We felt just like we were home again in health food lover land, San Francisco! Sadly, as we were happily enjoying our meal downstairs at the only available table in the place on the couch and chairs placed a stones throw from the emergency exit, a young girl with 2 large Cambros filled with prepped kale stood right behind me and, I kid you not, demanded to me while sitting in my seat (which I never moved from the place I found it at the table originally) to \\"move!\\" so she could get by and go through the door. Bewildered by her loud, demanding, and rude bark, I turned around to look at her, baffled that someone would be yelling at me. To which she stared at me, rolled her eyes, and pushed past me after I very apologetically moved my chair for her to squeeze by. Best part was when she came back through the door, sans 20 pounds of prepped kale and ,I kid you not, told me \\"I'm going to be coming through a lot so you should probably just move altogether\\". We sat at a table that was placed by your business and everything else is occupied...I'm sorry, what? Still, we jumbled our chairs around to try and accommodate the staff as much as possible only to have another employee come downstairs and literally place his hands on my chair and told me \\"listen, you have to move, you're blocking the emergency exit.\\"  Dumbfounded and feeling so unwelcome I STILL slammed my chair another 2 feet into a couch and hurried to finish my meal and get the heck out of there. Just for a frame of reference to how unwelcoming the entire situation was, please let me inform you, I've been a cafe general manager for years and I've been in production kitchens in the BOH even longer. I completely understand how frustrating and exhausting this industry is but at the end of the day, if you choose to work in hospitality, please remember, your job is to be hospitable to your guests.

We normally have our date nights on a Friday, but a change of plans brought us here 2 days earlier than planned (that's probably for the best since Diners, Drive Ins and Dives featuring The Meatball Stoppe airs Friday night and I'm pretty sure it's going to be impossible to get in after that show drops). We had the best experience and I sincerely hope after Triple D airs, this place doesn't get completely crushed, because I want to come back here many many more times.\\n\\nWe walked in around 5pm to a small line of people that had gathered around what I can only describe as \\"The show before dinner\\". Isabella, the owner/chef, was standing at the front counter gushing about the food and explaining what was in each meatball and the different ways you could order your meatballs. You could hear the pride in her voice as she talked about her food. I honestly stood there in awe of the love this woman had for her business and I couldn't wait to order. All I can say is that someone that shows that much emotion for her food and her customers is all right in my book.\\n\\nMy hubby ordered the Lamb Meatballs over Polenta and I ordered the Triple Meatball (why limit myself when there is a world of meatballs to experience), also over Polenta (if you've never heard of Polenta, it is summed up best by saying it's Italian grits). Their Polenta is served creamy, which is tricky, because Polenta starts to set almost as soon as you take it off the heat. Theirs was everything I could have hoped for. The meatballs were wonderful... I'll break it down for you (in case you miss The Isabella Show):\\n\\nMediterranean (aka The Lamb Meatball): This was a delightful meatball that was somehow soft yet firm at the same time... my husband said it almost felt like a p√¢t√©, without any of the heaviness he would expect from a meatball. He truly enjoyed his meatballs, and how delicate they were.  The spices were everything you would expect to find in a Mediterranean style meatball. The flavor reminded me of falafel (which my husband adores), and we both agreed that the sauce with the little chunks of cucumber really brought this meatball to life.\\n\\nJeffy's Crab Balls: As I listened to Isabella describe the different meatballs, I knew I was going to have to try this one. I'm from Maryland, home of the Chesapeake Bay Crab, and Isabella promised a meatball made of blue crab. SOLD! One bite of this meatball almost brought me to tears, this was literally everything I have been searching for in a crab cake (but never able to fine)... only in meatball form. The Crab Ball was so light and airy with this wonderful golden outside and the sauce was so perfectly matched, with just a touch of heat. It was amazing.\\n\\nMac and Cheese Meatball: I had decided before I arrived that I wanted to try this meatball, but listening to Isabella talk about it, I grew more and more intrigued. The thing that really grabbed my attention was the use of orzo instead of elbow pasta. Once she said it, it made total sense to me... orzo is an Italian pasta, it's slightly larger than rice and doesn't overwhelm the meatball like an elbow pasta would. The meatball just had this wonderful simplicity to it, the cheese sauce on top helped to add to the overall gooey mac and cheese feel.\\n\\nNonna's Traditional Meatball: Well Nonna.... you make one yummy meatball.  I think what I was enjoying most was the overall freshness of each meatball. The Traditional meatball was a little heavier than some of the others, as you would expect a meatball to be, with the classic array of spices one would expect in a traditional Italian meatball. The red sauce on top was one of the best things I've ever tasted (I sat there for a while pondering how I have spent my life eating red sauces and never knew they could taste like this. My brain just doesn't understand what they did to make that sauce taste so good). The combo of the red sauce with the creamy Polenta was enough to make my heart skip a beat. Yes. It was THAT good.\\n\\nThe Desserts:\\n\\nI have never ate a Tiramisu or Cannoli that didn't leave me feeling... misled and disappointed. We shared desserts (1 free Cannoli with Yelp check in) so I had each of these tonight and can finally say I understand these classic Italian desserts. I don't think either is meant to be overly sweet... but here there was finally a touch of sweetness that brought out the other flavors so they could shine. Both the Cannolli and the Tiramisu where light, didn't feel overcooked or over soaked and mushy. The flavors danced together, in a harmony that was just beautiful to experience. I wish I could sit here and talk about these for a while, but my Yelp is telling me to wrap it up by limited how much more room I have.\\n\\nI'll end this by saying that we were so happy and we plan to return. Isabella, you are so sweet and it was wonderful to meet you. Best of luck on Friday and we'll see you again real soon."},{"name":"The Taste of Yucatan","address":"1375 S Semoran Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"For an authentic taste of Mexican food, this is the place!

I've been here at least a dozen times, both for kickball and just because.  You just never know what the service will bring.  I try to be fair - I was a server in college, I know when someone is in the weeds or when it's the kitchen, etc.  More often than not, the place is just not fully staffed.

The first time we tried to go to Pok Pok there was a multiple hour wait, so we ended up eating at the Whiskey Soda Lounge across the street (also a great choice).  So we decided this time to go on an off time - 3pm.  One warning about this strategy - the menu is REALLY limited, so don't go assuming you get the full menu.\\n\\nI enjoyed the curry soup, which comes with tofu and mushrooms instead of chicken if you ask.  The soup had good spice, was velvety and smooth going down, and didn't make me overfull.  My partner ordered the pork skewers with a peanut sauce.  The pork seemed a little dry, but was still paired well with the sauce and slaw.\\n\\nOverall, I'm glad we could finally eat at the actually Pok Pok.

My perception changed however after my first experience at the salad buffet restaurant on the NE corner of International Drive and Kirkman Road.\\n\\nWhen you first enter Sweet Tomatoes, you will notice the long salad bar in front of you with a sign above showing you the pricing. For $8.19 the price is pretty good for all you can eat for an adult and even cheaper for children, making it an ideal healthy family friendly place to go. After you go through the line picking up your items, you pay at the register at the end.\\n\\n\\nThe salad bar itself has a mind boggling variety of assorted salad toppings and greens and it was kept pretty fresh that day because of the crowd of people there (I assume they were tourists visiting Orlando).\\n\\n\\nIn addition to salads, Sweet Tomatoes also has soups and a bakery filled with baked goodies. I particularly enjoyed their meatball soup, a rich savory soup with rice, veggies, and small succulent balls of meat that just burst with tender goodness. They also have vegan soups for the vegetarians out there.\\n\\n\\nDessert at Sweet Tomatoes was also delicious, they had chocolate brownies and a unique tasty muffin top, complete with self serve soft serve ice cream.\\n\\nThe service was good as well and the elderly man who took care of us was kind. He asked us if we wanted to get discounts next time and free food by signing up for their email program too.\\n\\nOverall I was satisfied with my experience with Sweet Tomatoes and I know where to go if I am in a salad mood, but also for a place with endless soups, pastas, and desserts for cheap!"},{"name":"Island Creek Oyster Bar","address":"500 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Since first coming to Island Creek my satisfaction with my dining experience has declined boooo. \\n\\nWe got some drinks at the bar and I'm glad we did since we ended up waiting for a table for nearly 30-40 minutes PAST our reservation time.

We declined and said we'd wait for a table in the back area, along the oyster walls. \\n\\nFinally we were seated!  Throughout the meal we had 3 servers...Once again, something I am not crazy about.

Adsfdhsflk;jdsa... See, I can't type about it without losing control. The seafood appetizer (there, that's better) is literally the best I've ever had (so far). The tomato sauce in it is chunky but light, with olives and the right amount of spice. When I lived down the street I used to get it all the time and add tons of paprika (I'm Caribbean, so spicy food is A MUST). Someone must've noticed, because every time I go there now and order it, it is HOT not SO HOT you can't taste it. Mystery chef who takes notes, KUDOS!\\n\\nThe pesto panini and chicken marsala are my favorites. Though, I've had pretty much everything on the menu at this point, and can confidently say there is NO RISK with ANYTHING. Literally anything you've been thinking about getting, get it and it'll be good. God FORBID that it's not, talk to them and they'll make it YOUR WAY. \\n\\nIt costs more than your average pizza joint but definitely less than your average big chain restaurant. No matter though, the portions and quality make the prices more than fair.\\n\\nOnly downside to this place is that it's small (seats max 25), closes at ten, and they don't deliver.

The coconut rice was very broken and dry, not as moist as I wanted it to be. Sticky rice only paired well with the papaya salad for the dipping. Other than that with the meat dishes, I think white/jasmine rice is a better option. Fish sauce wings were a little on the salty side. Good flavor, good amount of sweetness, and spiciness, but if you don't pair it along rice, it would be extremely salty. Papaya Salad, nothing out of the ordinary, Kai Yang took a little longer to come out, we were starving! By the time the  charred chicken came out, we were almost done with our meals. My favorite dish out of all the items was the kao soy. Their Kao Soy as very unique it had a mild curry taste to it. The noodles were bouncy. \\n\\nWould I go again? Yes, maybe for lunch, where the wait is less than 30 minutes. Waiting 1 hr is ridiculous!"},{"name":"Island Creek Oyster Bar","address":"500 Commonwealth Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"I love Island Creek Oyster Bar! The seafood is always fresh and delicious. It's an added perk that they have their own pastry chef that makes all the breads and baked goods in house, AND they have sparkling water on tap which is pretty much the best! They have the best clam chowder I've ever had hands down (and I've lived on the cape as well as worked at a seafood restaurant for 2 years). If overwhelmed by the menu I recommend the chowder and a lobster roll (maybe a few oysters as well), very classic but you really can't go wrong. The only issue I have with ICOB is their wine list. I would love to see a good value white wine under the $10/$12 mark. Honestly, I would come and sit at the bar for dinner and a glass of wine much more often if they added it.

Then she told \\"us\\" that we were seated there, however she didn't speak to us as she did speak to the air around us, or perhaps to a phantom image of a lover who scorned her in the past.

I went in about 8/10/14 about 3PM and got the cold shoulder from a waitress.  No \\"How are you doing?\\", \\"Welcome to Kiku.\\" She just put down a bunch of menus, as I stood there, and walked off.\\n\\nI stood there for another 3-4 minutes as waiters and waitresses talked to each other - in different groups.  When I got served, it didn't feel as though there was any urgency.  I could see if the place were busy ... but it was half full.  I was served by the waitress in a timely manner when she came around, but I find that there used to be someone there to greet you when walked in;  not so much these days even though there are waiters/waitresses having enough time to talk about cell phone plans and other trivial matters.\\n\\nThe food was good, but it seems as if they are now cutting back on the amount you get.  Usually, I had received 5-6 pieces for all bigger sushi rolls and 7-8 for smaller rolls.  Now they are only giving 4-5 for bigger rolls and the smaller rolls have ... smaller pieces ... which is unusual because the Kiku in Fayetteville actually may go over by giving you 6-7 pieces for bigger sushi rolls and 8-9 for smaller rolls.  I have been eating sushi at enough different Kikus to know the difference.  Weirdly enough, the food was the only thing that kept me coming back.  The service started getting so blas√© that I wondered why should I come in and give waiters and waitresses tips who can't even come back to check if your Sapporo is done; when you're paying 300% markup in alcohol, I would expect that they would want to keep you full.\\n\\nAlso, they are charging for weird things nowadays.  I asked for extra wasabi ... they charged 50 cents.  Never got charged this before ... and for the $70-90 I used to spend there every week or two for almost 7 years, I wouldn't think that one single small plastic container of wasabi should even come into the equation. \\n\\nI really expected Kiku to remain a glowing fixture in the Camp Creek community, but it seems they are falling victim to lackadaisical management of employees and odd cost-cutting measures which will start to alienate their customer base.  Now, I will just end up going to Strip, even though it is far.  I may even go to the Kiku in Fayetteville - if I am in the area.  I'd rather waste the gas and get good service instead of going to a place I used to like as it slips into the gutter.  The worst part of this is my rating 'Meh. I've experienced better.' actually refers to the old Camp Creek Kiku - which is just sad consequence of things in certain neighborhoods."},{"name":"Salamanders Sports Grill","address":"859 State Rd 434","city":"Winter Springs","stars":"4","text":"Awesome place!

I ordered the rainbow roll and was surprised when our own waitress made it herself.  When it came to the table it was made to look like a work of art and it tasted just as good as it looked.  That one was so good that I thought that I might sample another roll and ordered the North Beach roll.  Now I looked over and saw the chef heating it up and got a weird feeling.  Warm sushi, what?!  When they brought it to my table I started eating and it tasted ok but there was something not right about it.

My only reason for not giving this place five stars is due to pricing, the food price was a little higher than what I'm use to as other reviewers mentioned.

Although that sounds like heresy to proponents of Bone's, Hal's, McKendrick's, and Chops, the atypical dishes make KR Steak stand out.  For instance, I doubt you'll find venison carpaccio or any other number of more creative starters and entrees at the old school steakhouses.  And they're not gimmicks; KR Steak prioritizes its meat too, making the touted Allen Brothers available for non-Chicagoans.  There wasn't much that was bad.  The venison carpaccio, which I did order, was a little bland and I found a small piece of cling wrap in the dish.  I understand though - that stuff is sticky and sometimes you can lose track of it.  But, Mr. Kevin Rathbun himself was inspecting all dishes as they left the kitchen and missed it!  The server apologized, brought a new dish, and the manager assured me it would be removed from the check.  It wasn't a huge deal, and I doubt it happens often.\\n\\nThat incident was far outweighed by the incredible steaks.  The bone-in filets were so flavorful, and the 8 ounce strip was incredibly tender.  We had the mac and cheese tart, which was baked to perfect in a small cast-iron dish, and the agave-laced kale with fennel and pine nuts.  Both were great complements to the heavier flavor of the steak.  The truffle butter (holla, Drake) topping was amazing.  I know the steaks are best enjoyed alone, but it wasn't like I was drenching it in A1.  The two desserts we had - strawberry shortcake and the chocolate decadence - were really impressive.  The presentation was great, but the taste, obviously, deserved the most praise.\\n\\nAll in all, KR Steak combines the meat-centric options and cabin-y feel of a more traditional steakhouse but features a lot of modern concepts, including a less stuffy environment and more options for those on particularized diets.  It's well worth the pricey check you get at the end of the night."},{"name":"Piazza Italia","address":"1129 NW Johnson St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I hesitate to write this review because I don't want more people to crowd this fabulous restaurant and keep us from getting a seat!

I am a fellow smoker myself and really enjoy GREAT BBQ! When my family dropped in on a Monday night we were immediately greeted at the front door which was held open by the Manager. Enjoyed that. The interior is amazing and makes you feel right at home. Smoke Ring has a very Southern Small Town Rustic feel to it even though you are two  minutes from Downtown. \\n\\nWhen you sit at your table the menu looks great. You can tell the Chef has talent and it shows through the wording of his menu. It gives off a very \\"farm to table\\" approach to BBQ.  The drinks have a flair of mixology with a touch of Southern Charm. I had the Hurradura Skinny Margarita with Watermelon in it. Delicious!! Service was great, but the dinner I had a few problems with. I ordered the two meat platter, which I had no idea they would take it so literally because I got just that, two pieces of meat! I had ONE spare rib and ONE slice of brisket on my plate. I guess the $14 I paid were to make up for the over sized piece of unseasoned toast I got because it definitely did not cover the amount of meat I received. Most places serve at least 3 pieces each guys so I would change that immediately. Now it would be fine if it was the best BBQ I have ever had, but that was not even close to the case. The sides were amazing, and you can tell the Chef has talent, but he needs to go to school on the finer points of BBQ'ing.\\n\\nLet's first start with the Brisket and Rib I received. Your place is called Smoke Ring so I would make sure that both would have them. Mine didn't. My brisket was so well done and over dried that I could of slapped somebody in the face with it. Need to work on getting that thing juicy. Try injecting or pulling off the smoker a little earlier. Second, there was barley any bark on it, and what bark there was is very under seasoned.  Don't need to get complicated, equal parts salt & pepper with a little garlic and onion powder and a touch of cummin and you'll nail it. That's the mecca of BBQ's recipe, Franklins, try it out. \\n\\nNow on to the Rib. Very under seasoned as well!! You're in Georgia which this year became the #1 state for BBQ with 3 of the Nations top 10 BBQ Restaurants in Georgia. And in Georgia we like SWEET HEAT!! Rib did not posses either. It also tasted like it had been cooked well before we got there, sat around for a while in a hot box, and then reheated to plate. Rib was also very dried out. The one thing you did nail was the one bite tug. I was able to get a perfect bite with the just the right amount of tug to it. \\n\\nAll in all, you guys are close and I love the menu. just need to execute it a little better. So close but you you have some work to do. I hope by my next visit some of these issue are handled. I still recommend a stop through to Smoke Ring though."},{"name":"Baco Banh Mi","address":"1095 Commonweath Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"CLOSED\\n\\nThe short: Solid bahn mi for the price with friendly staff. \\n\\nThe slightly longer: So for a total of a mere $4 you can get a good vegetarian or meatatarian banh mi sandwich on a fresh toasted baguette.  \\n\\nEverything is prepared rather quickly and they have a whole smorgasboard of options to suit the palate of any passerby. \\n\\nThere's plenty of seating at Super 88 so that never seems to be a problem, but they are also able to pack your order nicely and ready to go in seconds.  \\n\\nI've had bahn mi from trucks, I've had bahn mi from many a Chinatown and I've had bahn mi in my dreams.

They were at the front of the store, and I believe I saw them all throughout the store as well. It's a great idea, because you might actually get lost in this labyrinth of books! (which is a good thing, but still...;) ) \\n\\nMy husband and I went pretty close to store opening on a Friday morning. It was pretty busy, and it only seemed to get busier as the two-three hours we spent in there went by. The staff was pretty helpful, and although we didn't ask them to help us find anything specific, I kept hearing over the intercom that they would page you up front or to a specific area once they found a book. That's really cool to know, because it could take them awhile, so at least you can wander around and explore while you wait, without the worry of not being helped or wasting your time. \\n\\nThey have a small coffee shop located on the second or third floor I beleive. I don't drink coffee, but my husband had a coffee and he said it was delicious. The aroma in the shop was to die for, everything smelled great. There were even book sections intertwined in the coffee room, so you could browse while you waited for the line to die down if you needed!\\n\\nThe prices are phenomenal here at Powell's. I would say a fair amount were even better than Amazon (which is a very big deal to us, because we look up everything on Amazon to see if we should buy it in person, or if the better deal is on Amazon). i  would even say a fair amount of the books were used too, so it wasn't like some used book stores where everything is new and crazy expensive. Keep that in mind if you're looking for a book, because odds are you can find it used first, and if not you can bite the bullet and pay new price if you need to.\\n\\n We bought about $70 worth of used books, and if we were anywhere local to here, or driving back home, it would have been double that easily. There were plenty of huge cookbooks that were dirt cheap that I wanted to buy and haul back, but I'm not quite sure how that would have worked when we have limited luggage space to fly back home with (sadly). :( \\n\\n\\nWe didn't do many things on this vacation, but this was one of my favorite things to do up here, and if we ever came back, we would definitely come back and spend several more hours here!

Well I have some mixed feelings about their menu. I first thought it was a Salvadorian menu and food, because they serve the same tortillas that are used for making pupusas. \\nAlso the salsa that came with the chips, was not red but green and had an odd, not bad, but an unusual, odd taste. Not familiar with this flavor. I prefer the usual red salsa for the chips. But it seemed it is a Mexican restaurant even if they have Italian pizza and Italian pasta dishes as well. Anyway I tried few things, the Tacos are extremely good but very tiny, way too tiny. I had also a sandwich made of some kind of corn waffle, soft, filled with meat and salsa. It was good, not bad at all. \\nBut they do not give you the real Mexican salsas (green & red) at the table, as all other places do, just some avocado already made sauce and the bottled red sauce you can buy at Safeway or grocery stores.

We arrived a bit before our reservation and enjoyed cocktails at the main bar. They were perfectly mixed and very delicious. The price and quality actually surpassed my expectations, as it is not uncommon to find $11 cocktails on menus all over Columbus. I enjoyed a couple of the Strawberry Basil Gimlets and he went with two of the \\"Dirty Goose Martini\\" - truly the best dirty martini I've ever tasted.\\n\\nThe ambiance of the main dining room and bar are nothing short of palatial. Softly dimmed lighting and infinitely high ceilings really set the tone for the entire experience. Detail work from the building's historical past as a bank creates something to notice at every glance and immediately sets this place apart from the modern/rustic/industrial we're so used to seeing. Unfortunately when we were seated we were taken away from the main dining room and seated in a brightly-lit room that held no more than 8 tables and had the feeling somewhat like a den, though not as cozy. Cue the disappointment.\\n\\nDespite the seating situation our service was superb and we definitely never felt forgotten. Their wine list seems to have something to please all palates, though I would caution against some of the lower-priced bottles that clearly had markups over 200%. We opted for the Daou Cabernet, which was delicious. Our server allowed me to taste a bit before we committed to the entire bottle. One thing I noticed was that the year we were served was different than the year listed on the menu. Not a huge deal since the wine was amazing but just something to note as wine qualities can vary year to year. \\n\\nI had been dreaming of a filet for weeks prior to our dinner and it did not disappoint. The cut and temperature were perfect on both of our steaks and I sliced through it like butter. We opted for the crab and bearnaise topping with a side of asparagus and it was simply delicious. \\n\\nOther positive takeaways from the meal: The sourdough bread was a basic starter but tasty and helped with the initial cocktail and wine buzz. For salads, I thought the Chop Chop was amazing and would return regularly simply for that. My date enjoyed his Wedge salad as well. \\n\\nSome not so positives: The mac and cheese is just simply not good here. The flavorless sauce was very thin and relatively nonexistent. Compared to other steakhouses like Capital Grille, this one just does not cut it. Our server graciously took ours back to the kitchen for a bit more sauce but overall it was just bland filler for the meal. Sadly they also ran out of the dessert we had been saving room for (who runs out of cr√®me br√ªl√©e?!). Again, our server was very kind to apologize and bring us back espressos on the house. \\n\\nOverall we had an amazing meal and cozy date night to ring in the new year.

My eyes opened up in gratitude at the sight of a Tex-Mex restaurant in the area. I decided to check it out on a whim. Because why not? It was dinner time!\\n\\nFrom the entrance, I could see that the ambiance was very swanky and cool. A poster on their door announced they were holding a fundraising for the McCallum High School Senior class. That melted my heart right away. \\n\\nThe hostess showed me the way to my lil table (because it was only me, myself and I on a date with myself) and she was very warm and friendly. I loved her outfit as well, but we don't need to go into that....\\n\\nSo, the waiter brought me a menu, along with chips and salsa to chew over what I wanted to eat as an entree. She automatically brought me water without asking!! (Yasss) As I continuously downed my water, she was very perceptive and came back to refill it once it was half empty (or half full). \\nThe chips....well, i've had better. They were much rather too salty for my taste.\\n\\nWhen the waitress came back, I ordered the Emma's choice with the piccadillo puffy taco and the chipotle enchiladas. \\nThey came out super fast! I dug into the Enchilada first. My first impression was that the sauce was the same as the chip salsa, but heated up. Perhaps i am not fond of over-tomatoey flavors for Tex-Mex. It somewhat tasted like pasta sauce on spaghetti to be honest. But the filling was incredible, and definitely filled me up!\\n\\nBut i kept going and dug into the puffy taco. oh yessss. The crunchy/soft shell, the sizzle of the fried corn, and the juicy picadillo got me like WHOA. (Mya reference anyone?)\\n\\nAll in all, I definitely recommend this place. I personally think Chuy's is the most overrated Tex-Mex joint in town, so that shows my loyalty.

Further, the concept of giving thanks to life/food is similar to Cafe Gratitude, now defunct in the SF Bay Area but still going on in the LA area. I said the food was fresh; I can elaborate. The mix greens had a nice taste and the cashews have a nice crunch. Bragg's dressing? Or maybe it was homemade but definitely had that tart flavor. There was a dollop of crunchy textured hummus and carrots. It's a relatively straightforward salad!!!! The turmeric tea was good and you can tell the black tea was steeped very well. The tumeric did not add additional flavor just color. It's sold as \\"spicy\\" but that came through the aroma not the flavor... so don't expect something like a spicy mojito.

Have a few drinks and maybe some wings at Whiskey Soda Lounge next door until they're ready. Or come during lunch. The seating is a bit of a gamble. The place clearly used to be a house that slowly got extensions added. A porch here, another porch there. Christmas lights strung up. Thai music playing. The garage is converted to a storeroom but still has the roll up garage door. It adds a very unique, hodgepodge vibe, but sometimes you won't get the best seating. Anywhere outside or on the first floor patio is best of course, but you just gotta take what you can get in this case. Just as a note, because I see reviews to the contrary: I've been here a few times now and I've never had a problem with service. A bit rushed perhaps, but always willing to explain menu items and give you hints or suggestions if you're stuck.\\n\\nThe food, instead of haute cuisine, is more like a stepped up version of old-school Thai home cooking. I loved it. Despite being of a different heritage, it reminded me a lot of what my family and grandparents would cook. I think due to the reputation as one of Portland's best and a well reknown chef/restaurateur at the helm, some expect crazy inventive and off the wall and avant garde. Of course a few of the dishes likely have unique twists, but really the idea here is a celebration of country-style cooking and old-school dishes, particularly from Northern Thailand, particularly from Chiang Mai.\\n\\nThe fish (I forget what I had, it was a special) is deep fried. It's not \\"fancy\\" but it reminds me a lot about how my mother and grandmother would cook fish and how we preferred oilier fishes like mackerel and corvina/croaker. It's fishy, a little greasy (as fish is supposed to be, stop being scared of fish that tastes like fish), and delicious. The pork belly and shoulder curry is rich and deeply flavored. It's strong and fatty, not something delicate like haute cuisine (though pork is melt in your mouth kind of slow cooked), but undoubtedly delicious. Reminds me of a cassoulet, a French country dish of slow cooked beans and sausage, which was only relatively recently considered high cuisine, long regarded as a peasant dish, well, because it was. The khao soi, very rich curry soup with noodles (kind of like a ramen), heavily endorsed by a friend who had recently come from a trip to Chiang Mai. Had a few other dishes, and rarely disappointed.

It made the event that much more special. At just over $35 a person, we had assorted snack food and a four flight tasting for each guest. Great value.\\n\\nWe loved the staff, they were incredibly personable and  helped to make the event that much more fun. Having the place to ourselves was priceless and although I think this was luck more than anything else we absolutely loved it.\\n\\nThe only thing I think would have been nice would have been if our bartender had been a little more knowledgeable on the whiskeys. The chef had to leave for an event and although the testing menu at each place setting had facts about each whiskey (on where it was made, what flavors the taster might experience etc) many of us had no experience at how to tell what constitutes a good whiskey and some additional guidance would have been icing on the cake.\\n\\nI would highly recommend The Warren for a tasting event, I think we are even planning on coming back the The Warren for another birthday event in June because of how special, classy, fun and intimate it was.

My friend & I split a Smoked Turkey & Bacon minus avocado - I'm allergic ($12) and a Spinach & Honeycrisp Apple Salad ($10).\\n\\nWhen our food arrived I wasn't sure we'd be able to finish everything. The salad was huge and had plenty of apples and cheese. I did feel there could have been a few more candied pecans. The salad was lightly dressed with a mild apple vinaigrette. I thought it was a nice touch that knowing we were splitting our meal we were given serving utensils.\\n\\nThe sandwich was larger than I expected. It came on a baguette and was generously stuffed with smoked turkey. The bacon was good - not too salty and crispy at the ends. The duck fat fries were tasty although a bit uneven - some parts were soft and others were so crunchy they hurt my teeth. The ketchup seemed to be Heinz (which was fine with me since I'm a fan). The small salad was a pile of greens lightly dressed with some sort of vinaigrette. There was also a very sour pickle spear. I love pickles but it didn't seem to go with everything else since it was so strongly flavored.\\n\\nIt was a great meal, we finished everything, and we'll go back. My friend said she was stuffed - I could have used some dessert. They don't serve the dessert menu at lunch but they do have baked goods in the market that our server offered to bring to the table.\\n\\nEverything was delicious and fresh and we thought the prices were justified. If you're used to buying your salads and sandwiches at ABP and Rebecca's then Commonwealth will seem overpriced, but the quality of the ingredients was definitely superior to other eateries in the area. We've eaten elsewhere in Kendall and paid $14 for smaller sandwiches and greasy house-made chips and I've gotten a $9 salad elsewhere that lacked the freshness and generosity of ingredients. Lunch at Commonwealth is a fair price if you're dining in. You're clearly also paying for the service and the nice silverware. It may not be worth it for take-out.\\n\\nMy friend commented that she's been trying some of the other new places in Kendall and that she hasn't liked them because their food is \\"too fussy.\\" Commonwealth's food is the opposite of fussy. I'd called ahead to ask questions about the menu because of my food allergies. Their food is uncomplicated enough that they seem to list all the main ingredients on the menu but they don't list salad dressing and bread and they left out the pickle with the sandwich so if you have allergies, ask questions. Like Henrietta's Table, they emphasize the flavor of the ingredients and they don't even have salt and pepper on the table. If you're someone who likes complex and strong flavors, this probably isn't the restaurant for you.\\n\\nAs other people have noted, the service was excellent. I didn't find the hostess to be all that friendly, but I was seated right away even though my friend hadn't arrived (we had a reservation - definitely necessary at peak times) and our server was delightful: polite, friendly, funny, & cute (yes, we noticed).\\n\\nThe main dining room is bright and doesn't feel like New England. I saw a review that commented that it felt like being in Palo Alto and I got that vibe too. Some downsides: the acoustics, uncomfortable chairs, and linty napkins. When we arrived at 1pm the dining room was packed and it was difficult to hear each other until the crowd thinned out. The small, hard, graffiti-covered chairs apparently came from a school in Belgium (via the owner's column on Eater). The napkins are a strange choice given their business crowd. If you're wearing black DO NOT put them on your lap. My friend saved me from being covered in lint by doing it to herself. The check comes in an origami pocket made from their market menu. It was a cute touch, but made less awesome by the fact that our pocket had food stains on it.\\n\\nAfter lunch we wandered the \\"market\\" which looked more like a curated gift shop. They had very little on offer and it was curiously organized in some spots (small bags of quinoa with popcorn balls). The staff at the baked goods counter were not so helpful. There were many of them hovering yet when we asked what items were, they had to look at all the signs (which are not necessarily located with the corresponding baked goods) and they couldn't accurately answer questions about what was in stuff (one person told us that yes there were nuts in the blondie but then someone else walked by and said no they were white chocolate chips). If you have allergies, ask for a manager.\\n\\nParking in this neighborhood is very difficult. There's some on-street metered parking but I drove around Kendall Square for 20 minutes before I got a spot. They validate for a garage after 4pm M-F and all day on weekends ($1 for 3 hours), but it's expensive during weekdays - $14 for 1-2 hours.

Totally undercooked.  Couldn't even break them apart.  Getting the meat off the bone was a real challenge.  Once again, the smoky flavor came thru, but not really sure if they even used a spice rub, and since I like my ribs well-rubbed with little sauce, I was not happy.

I called around and I talked to this woman at Steel Toad who was in charged of large events. I explained that we would have about 25-30 people, and we would have this event in the new year - as it can be very busy in December. She had no problem explaining the options and where we can hold the event (balcony - for extra no charge). She said that we can order our own entrees or they could create something for us. She was going to send me an email within a week for confirmation. After not hearing back from her, I emailed them. I didn't know if my email went through or not, so I called to see if I could talk to someone. The host said that she would let the manager know and if I could give her my name and email address - which I did. A few days later, I got an email with their newsletter (I DID NOT want to be signed up for their mailing address)! So after another week or so, I really needed to figure out the plans. I called to see if I could talk to a supervisor or manager. A man came on the phone and sounded really unprofessional (annoyed and rude). I told him my conversation with the other lady, and he explained that they \\"changed\\" how large parties work now (even though it was only about 1 week that pasted). It would have to be \\"family-style\\" food and that they are still working on the menu. There would be a few menus I could choose from and for various price range. I asked when it would be ready, and he said \\"at the end of the week\\". He said he would email me the menu once they created it. I booked the reservation for 25 people for mid January. However, when he did not send me the menu by the end of December, I gave up. When the day of the event arrived, I assumed they would contact me asking where my large group was, but they didn't (I did not cancel my reservations, because I was pissed at their customer service). I am assuming that he did not even book the reservations for that day!\\n\\nIt is very disappointing for this establishment to loose out on such a large party. Especially since we work in this neighbourhood and would have loved to frequent this restaurant during our lunch breaks. However, with the lack of communication and horrible customer service -- our location will never come here again.

This book store is more of a modernized store and offers a variety of different genres of book for everyone. I must note that before visiting Powell's, friends told me that tourists MUST visit this store because it is famous! I thought this place would be similar to \\"The Last Bookstore\\" in Los Angeles, but Powell's is definitely not the same. Powell's is more of a legit bookstore than a hip art place so keep that in mind.\\n\\nAlthough this place is one of the biggest or the biggest bookstore in the country, it is very well organized and the selection is just simply amazing. They have computers for customers to look up ANY book they want and each floor is a color coded room. Each room has it's own specific genre etc. One could simply get lost in the selection in book forever. The staff was very friendly and approachable when I needed help finding several books.\\n\\nThe place becomes very easy to navigate once you explore around. Parking here is tricky because Powell's is located in downtown Portland. On weekdays, expect to pay at the meters if you decide to drive into the city. Otherwise, carpooling or parking and walking to the store is recommended. Don't be discouraged about the long cashier lines either! they move super quickly and checkout during the busy December holiday shopping was roughly 5-10 minutes.\\n\\nThe pricing of their books are also very reasonable! I love how they sell reused books too because the prices are just way more affordable for everyone. You can also go to Powell's to resell your old books as well! I have not personally done this yet although I did see a line for people to do that as well.\\n\\nTLDR: Powell's is a modernized book store that is worth visiting if you're in the area!"},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"There's not much I can say about my beloved Pok Pok that hasn't already been said by other Yelpers.

I enjoy the Kai Yaang (rotisserie chicken) or the Kaeng Hang Leh (Pork shoulder/belly curry) for entrees. \\n\\nThe cocktails utilize drinking vinegars which are popular in Thailand and they have a unique selection because their drinks contain flavors that are unique to Thailand and SE Asia.

We often snuggle up with a breakfast power sandwich and a coffee to plan our day, or brunch over an Asiago bagel and ponder the mysteries of the world.  Recently, however, I have discovered a disturbing trend to move away from smiling American customer service model to a more Norman model of cold, uncommunicative human analogs. Not that I need a blathering of emotional joy whenever I walk in the door, rather, I'd like to be treated as though it is their privilege to serve me today instead of being yet another bothersome warm body which they are forced to accommodate. Today, this particular location made Chick Fil A look like the gold standard in warmth and, dare I say, all of the McDonalds run by JonCo in our town also look a little more polished. \\n\\nSo what happened? Consistently out of the most popular bagels you would think that they would adjust their ordering and stocking to accommodate. We walked through the door at eight minutes until 11 (when breakfast is no longer served) and found the following to be true: they were out of plain, Asiago, everything, and... Well it will be easier to list what they did have: cinnamon raisin, jalapeno cheese, sesame, cinnamon crunch, and that's about it. With a few customers in front of us being forced to choose their fourth choice of bagels by the time we got to the line it was 2 minutes to 11 and almost too late. The kitchen ignored calls from our cashier to determine if eggs are still available while our order was pending. Out of 6 people behind the kitchen counter any one of them could have looked but they chose to ignore the cashier. Laughing instead while the last 2 eggs were snatched at the drive through window. The nice and visibly disappointed young lady at the counter pushed our order through anyway.  \\n\\nIndeed we did get what we asked for, but not without that greasy feeling you get when you know you don't belong somewhere and you're being served only out of obligation.

ICOB, with nothing more than a note on OpenTable, went above and beyond to make this night even more memorable. 1 - Our menus were specially printed with \\"Happy Anniversary!\\" Such a nice personal touch. 2 - Every single ICOB employee that stopped by our table congratulated us and also told us how awesome it was that our first date was here. Once again, such a little touch that is a reminder as to why ICOB is so great. 3 - Our dessert was comped and brought out with \\"Happy Anniversary!\\" written in chocolate on the plate. On top of that, the Banofee Pie was outstanding. I don't even like banana and I couldn't put it down. 4 - The wine recommendation was on point! So much so that we left the specially printed menus in the cab on the way home. We called ICOB the next day and they instantly said no problem and that they would print new menus for us from the night before. We picked them up the next day and were ever so grateful.

But I saw some of the reviews on here and I just had to justify Pinky's because I do order from here often. Not as often as I would like, but often enough. Just keeping it real. I literally made this account TODAY just so that I could post my review about Pinky's Famous Pizza. \\n\\n*Cracks my knuckles* Let's do this.\\n\\nTRUE AND HONEST REVIEW (4.5 out of 5 stars)\\n\\n\\nFIRST OFF - I can only speak on behalf of A.) Their delivery service/attitude, B.) Their pizza (which is going to be the shortest review, I can already tell), and C.) What I order EVERY single time, without a doubt, their mouthwatering steak and cheese subs. So, if you're not interested in any of that then feel free to skip over this review, because it may be quite lengthy.\\n\\nLet me start by saying that their steak and cheese subs are honestly the best that I have ever had in my entire life, and I'm a foodie, so I would know. I have yet to travel to Philly, but for what is here in Medford, and its surrounding areas in Massachusetts this is by far the BEST place to go if you want a bangin' steak and cheese sub.\\n\\nI normally place my order online (which I HIGHLY suggest, because they have a 5% off coupon code that you can use under the \\"Deals\\" tab) and ask for stuff on the side (ex: Pickles, hot peppers, etc) and they NEVER mess it up! Other places that I have been to usually tend to forget that I asked for something on the side (happened to me three weeks ago, actually) and when that most recent experience happened, instead of cussing up and down and becoming frustrated with the fact that they (a company which shall remain anonymous for the sake of all humans everywhere... actually, I don't remember who they were. This is how often I have Pinky's on the brain. Everyone else just fades off into the distance) forgot my sides, I THANKFULLY had a leftover container of hot peppers from-.... you guessed it, PINKY'S! They saved my life. I no longer had a tasteless sub.\\n\\nBut back to the actual steak and cheese from Pinky's itself - it's fantastic. \\n\\nI'm a cheese gal, big time. I swear that I must have been born in Wisconsin then teleported here to Somerville without a clue in the world because cheese is my thing, so more often then not I tend to get extra cheese on my steak and cheese subs (yet another thing that I recommend, because their cheese is made with love. I swear.) My order never, ever arrives cold. In fact, one time I nearly burned my mouth because I was so eager to have my first bite of heaven. By the way, did I mention that the delivery DOES take a LONG time (mostly forty minutes to an hour) but keep in mind, that my food always gets to me piping hot, so I don't know how they do it and I also don't mind the wait, because I know that my food gets here in proper condition. Just don't order from here when you're about to keel over, is all.\\n\\nI could go on and on about their steak and cheese subs but, let's get more into their delivery service AND their pizza.\\n\\nThe drivers are friendly 9/10 times. So that's a good bet to go on. My last order from here, the guy was so friendly, smiles and all, even after I gave him his tip. I swear, I used to think that drivers (not all, but some) only smiled to get a larger tip, or something, but he wasn't like that, and it was nice for a change to have a delivery man say \\"Have a nice day, miss.\\" Do people even say miss or ma'am anymore in the food industry? Pinky's drivers sure do.\\n\\nNOW, the reason why I mentioned earlier that the pizza will be the SHORTEST review of them all, is because I only had it ONE time, because honestly their steak and cheese is so darn good that I ca-.... I'm doing it again, aren't I? I need to forget about their steak and cheese sub for one minute, Jesus. Okay, where was I? Right, their pizza. The first time I had it I bought one pepperoni slice, and one cheese slice, and to keep the rest of this review short, sweet and to the point?\\n\\nThey were hot, melty, and delicious. I liked the pepperoni more than the cheese, and this is coming from the cheese fanatic. I just found it to be bland, is all (the cheese slice, NOT the pepperoni.) But if you want to order pizza from Pinky's know that it is not a thin crust. It is rather medium to thick, so if you like less dough for your pizza I wouldn't suggest going here for that and that alone. You can't fold their slices very well if at all, so that may also be something that some people are interested in knowing.\\n\\nNot even gonna lie, I know that I said I'd stop talking about their steak and cheese, but I just made myself want one by writing this review...\\n\\n-Xoxo Erika"},{"name":"Hit The Spot Cafe","address":"5121 Albert Brown Rd","city":"Garfield","stars":"4.5","text":"In the area for work and decided to try the cafe based on good reviews and pics of food that looked really good.

I'm really picky about them. I hate when they lack flavor or are overly dry, way too sweet, etc. Texture is key: You should be able to break off little chunks and snack on them (as opposed to watching the entire thing crumble into a million dry pieces or, worse, BEND because it's filled with rubbery dough conditioning chemicals). In case there's any confusion (ahem: Starbucks), a scone is not just a triangular muffin. It's not supposed to be fluffy or super soft, but it's also not supposed to be something you could chuck at somebody like a rock.\\n\\nSo, all that said, the BCCO vanilla almond scone is friggin DELIGHTFUL. The orange one is also really good, and the little cheesecakes with sour cream topping are kind of a steal for $4.

Your order will be brought to your table, so just grab a seat. The Porchetta sandwich was so flavorful and generously portioned! So, with any sandwich with too much filling, you wonder how long do you have until your bread starts falling apart? Well, luckily for me, my sandwich didn't turn into an instant pile of bread mush. The bread had soft, fluffy dough on the inside with a crunchy crust on the outside. Total yum! \\n\\nAs we were eating our cashier came out and checked to see if we needed anything. As we nodded no, he left and then surprisingly came back to give us samples of other menu items that we inquired about earlier.

As boring as it sounds, they make a mean gin martini. \\n\\nApps: The lobster fritters will make you want to cry they are so good and you can't go wrong with the bacon puffs - it's bacon, in a puff!  The beef tartar is also excellent.\\n\\nSalad: Their wedge is done right - the perfect balance of flavors.\\n\\nSteak: If you are dining with another person, the steak for 2 is 100% the way to go.  You get a little bit of everything, seasoned so unbelievably well.  And while it sounds entirely extreme, get the foie gras or black truffle butter.  You will thank yourself.\\n\\nSides: Perfect for sharing, the creamed corn is always a crowd pleaser and the mac-n-cheese is a must.  We try to balance our side-choices out with at least one green item and usually go for the broccoli - super simply done but a really nice accompaniment.  \\n\\nDessert: If you can manage to eat another bite, the salted caramel bonbons are delish.

Even the bussers were courteous and attentive complimenting me on my choice of Thai affigado. I especially liked the remarks as it was a tough decision between that and the thai ice cream sandwich. Our waitress  described the ice cream sandwich as authentic street food AND adventurous which alarmed us. I am so glad that we went with the affigado it was the perfect end to a ABSOLUTELY perfect meal. the sweetened condensed ice cream was luxurious.\\n\\nI would also like to add that there was only a five minute wait to be seated as I have heard horror stories about long waits to and my husband is very impatient!\\n\\nI highly recommend this restaurant if you are looking for a Thai meal.\\nI myself will be returning to try the famous chicken wings and am so pleased my veggie husband will be returning with me as he was thrilled with the veggie options!!!!"},{"name":"Panera Bread","address":"1619 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"3","text":"The food was filling but kinda generic.

After reading all the high marks in Yelp I was very excited to give this restaurant a try. Went in on a for dinner on a weeknight with the four us being the only customers... Hmm. I ordered the tallarin lomo churascco with huancaina sauce. I have small children and I am a confirmed expert in cooking up Mac N Cheese since that's pretty much what they only eat :( Firstly the side skirt steak had a taste that was somewhat ripe (meaning that it may have been a few days old) it certainly did not taste like what fresh meat should. Secondly it was overly salted and drenched in sauce that probably used to hide the lack of freshness of the skirt steak. But here's the kicker... The huancaina sauce was NOT huancaina. There was not a hint of taste of aji in it at all. Did I mention earlier that I'm a certified Mac N Cheese cook. The huancaina sauce was no different from your typical Kraft's Mac N Cheese sauce. I swear to God. I gave some to my 7 year old son and without prejudice from me, said it tasted like mac and cheese but with linguine. \\n\\nWe also ordered the ceviche mixto and it too lacked freshness and was overdone with leche de tigre that was unlike the leche de tigre that I've come to love. \\n\\nI came away with a couple of impressions after that dinner. The lack of freshness in both skirt steak and ceviche was masked with sauces trying to hide what is most likely old meat and old seafood. The only good news is that I haven't received food positioning. \\n\\nVery disappointed with this restaurant and I  cannot in good conscience give this restaurant a review that's gives merit to it's Yelp rating."},{"name":"Bistro Marquee","address":"200 SW Market St","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"Happy hour with co-workers.

Although the ribs leave much to be desired, the extra moist brisket, the turkey, and the \\"hottie\\" jalapeno sausage are pretty good.  I also like the sauce, which is nice and peppery.

Maybe the Rudy's cows are one in the same as the Chik-Fil-A cows.  \\n\\nRudy's is not the place to take someone you are trying to impress, like a boss or a first date.  Case in point: A few years back, my boss was in town and someone planned a team dinner at Rudy's.

I was a loyal customer for 3 or 4 years to this place. The Chinese lady that used to work there no longer works there anymore and has gone back to China. Made me sad because I had grown fond of her and she was so nice. The rest of the people in this place seem so dead and don't speak. Now that I came back from GA I gave it another try. This place has gone down! The food is NEVER fresh and there is hardly a decent selection. What they do put out is all dry, cold, and not fresh looking. Plus the service sucks. The Mexican woman that works the register is cool and all but she's always on her cell phone or talking to her friends and family that stop by.

How much can you complain?  \\"How much can I expect?\\", is a better question.  Going in, I was really expecting a lot...and there is a lot of food.  Great food?  No.  Good food?  Maybe...how numb are your taste buds?  Okay food?  Sure,it's edible...sort of.\\n\\nI was soooo excited when I heard that there was practically every kind of sushi imaginable...even Uni (my #1 favorite)!  Too good to be true.  Normally this stuff goes for $4 a pop!  But  they had it!  It was my game plan to pig out solely on this, if not anything else...yet,  I only had one piece.  My favorite sushi and this one tasted blah...*sad*  Not even good enough to make me want a 2nd piece.  Sadly, the trend continued downward.  The tobiko tasted even worse.  So bad, in fact, that I made an involuntary face and one of the guys we went with asked if I was ok.  Stay away.  Same with the squid, octopus, spicy salmon, eel, etc.  The ikura (\\"Fish Gushers\\", as I affectionately call them) was good enough to go back for seconds (thank goodness!), but surprisingly, my most favorite \\"sushi\\" here was the Galaxy roll...guess what!  No fish, no rice.  It was made up of raw vegetables...which is the one that tasted the least foul.  Oh, and the spicy salmon maki roll was also a let down...it's cooked salmon!  Where's the fun in that?!  My main complaint about the sushi tasting off isn't b/c it's not fresh.  It tastes fine in that aspect.  But I think they go around adding sugar, mayo, salt, or other weird seasonings to where it kills the tastiness of the fish.  So, if you don't mind sugar in your eel, excess mayo in your shrimp roll, weird tasting leafy things on your squid, then please, knock yourself out.  I will not indulge.\\n\\nHowever, all is not lost.  There is plenty to savor on the other side.  Typical Asian buffet things, but all good, none the less.  The crab legs were good.  There's also a meat station, where they cook short ribs (good, but extra greasy...some blotting w/ napkin may be required), shrimp and pineapple skewers, etc.  \\n\\nIronically, my most favorite thing about this entire place is the crepe station.  They make fresh crepes with all sorts of fillings!  This was the redeeming aspect of the night.  Also, the green tea ice cream was a nice treat.  Soft serve...that's a new experience.  What's wrong with this picture?\\n\\nSo, will I ever crave going back?  No.  \\n\\nWill I go back?  Only if a group of friends insist on it...and then I will protest, scream, throw a fit, pout, threaten to stay at home alone and eat microwave dinners...and then eventually give in, b/c I am that big of a pushover, and at least it's not poisonous.\\n \\n2.3333333 stars."},{"name":"Pho Basil","address":"177 Massachusetts Ave, Ste A","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Impeccable tasting pho and fried rice!

So when my wife and I headed here with some friends, a part of me remained healthily skeptical. In my opinion, really great sushi relies on two key things: fresh fish and time / care taken to construct the sushi. The concept of mass-produced sushi seems like it just couldn't work, but fortunately for me, Nori Nori puts out some really good sushi.\\n\\nI'll start by saying that, know this is a buffet, and that the fish to rice ratio in their sushi and their rolls is heavily slanted towards the rice. For the amount of diners they have on a given day, this is about the only way they could make their sushi and stay in business. But I will say that their portions of fish are generous compared to other buffets. I'll also add that we came here with for lunch, so their selection wasn't as extensive as it is for dinner (I have heard that they offer sashimi for dinner). Despite that, they still had a decent selection of sushi and rolls from which to choose.\\n\\nThe sushi and rolls aren't particularly well-constructed. However, what they lack in quality of construction of their sushi / rolls, they more than make up for with the freshness of their fish. Of all the sushi I consumed (which turned out to be a lot!), none of it had a fishy taste. The salmon (my personal fav) was rich and buttery, the tuna was light and fresh. Their rolls were all right, but if we find ourselves back here, I'm going to stick mostly with their sushi, plus a choice roll or two.\\n\\nThe other thing that stood out was the fact that, despite it being exceptionally busy, they did a great job at keeping the buffet stocked. There were times when a plate or two would be empty, but before too long, they'd have it refilled.\\n\\nThey also serve up a nice selection of cooked items and desserts. I didn't have too much from their non sushi / rolls selection, but what I did have was much better than I thought it was going to be. I didn't have any of their desserts, but that was mostly because I was over-saturated from all the sushi and rolls.\\n\\nAll in all, Nori Nori serves up some good, fresh sushi. It is nowhere near the best I've ever had. However, it is among the best sushi I've had for the price we paid (~$17 per person for lunch on a Sunday). If you're looking for good, fresh, and relatively cheap sushi (i.e., good bang-for-your-buck sushi), Nori Nori is a place worth checking out."},{"name":"Summer Moon Coffee - Buda","address":"316 N Main St","city":"Buda","stars":"4.5","text":"$4 - 12oz mocha moon latte was bomb. \\n\\nAlso the cafe is beautifully decorated, cute and comfy furniture!

Made with rice flour and made to order, they arrive hot and delicious.  Are they as good as other top rated donuts? No.  They remind me of something you would make at home if you had the patience.  I would order them again, though. \\n\\nThe sandwich was done well with good flavors and a nicely toasted bun.  We only tried the one, but enjoyed it for what it was.\\n\\nThe mochas - horrible!  If I wasn't so tired I would have returned them for a refund.  It tasted like left over bitter coffee with someone mixing in some hot chocolate mix.

Clam chowder was really, really good and creamy with generous bits of bacon. They were kind enough to split the chowder bowls for us to share.

I've been eating vegetarian/vegan for a few years now, so I'm not new to this type of food. I had the kale, orange juice, lemon, and ginger drink. It was really sour and there were tons of ginger \\"strings\\" in it. If the juice were strained, it would have been more palatable. I really wanted to like this drink. I think adding a sweet, natural juice to the mix would make it more tasty.\\n\\nI also had the lentil loaf with pickled vegetables. The loaf was tasteless and had sharp pieces of I don't know what in it that jabbed my throat as I swallowed. The tomato topping was sour. Nothing was seasoned... Not even salt. The mustard sauce on the side was pretty good. The pickled vegetables were just beets soaked in plain vinegar. I think using an organic pickling spice would be a better option. I also had the very bland quinoa salad... I don't recommend it. The quinoa was cooked well, but the sunflower seeds threw it off. The seeds make is seem as though the quinoa is uncooked. My bf had the jackfruit BBQ sandwich.\\n\\nThe texture of the jackfruit was fine, but the sauce was really tart and nothing like BBQ sauce. It gave me heartburn. He also had the roasted vegetables (of which he really liked the roasted sweet potatoes) and the jalapeno cornbread. I didn't like the mushy and overly sweet beets and carrots. I did not try the sweet potatoes. Neither of us liked the very dry, tasteless cornbread. I also disliked the natural root beer I ordered to replace the juice. It reminded me of the sweet taste of mouthwash, and I did not finish it. I do not drink soda often, but I think a cane sugar or beet sugar soda would be better than a stevia soda in my opinion. Beet sugar tastes more \\"natural\\" than stevia to me. \\n\\nMy boyfriend is not as particular as I am when it comes to food, so he finished most of his meal and said that although my lentil loaf tasted like wood it wasn't \\"that bad\\" lol. He also liked the juice minus the ginger pieces. I was extremely hungry when I got there are just as hungry when I left because I barely ate or drank anything. We ended up paying $36 for the 2 meals and I was not pleased as it was really late and I was still hungry.\\n\\nI would not recommend Counter Culture.

Please beware. You will be spending way more money than you anticipate!!! The reason being, because the shuttle schedule is very limited. For example ,if you go to a park in the morning ,you probably won't be able to get back until late that evening. Doesn't the hotel realize that some people might want the chance to go back and relax for part of the day. You also won't actually be brought to the park of your choice. You will need to continue to take another form of transportation once you get to the magic kingdom.Buying a Disney park hopper was a complete waste of money. You won't be hopping anywhere if you stay here. You will be lucky if you make it to one park and back without spending 35 dollars on a taxi. You will spend taxi money trust me!!! Also other hotels throw in perks like a few free breakfasts or kids under 12 eat free. You won't get that here. The breakfast buffet looked and tasted great but you will spend well over a hundred bucks just for breakfast here. The pool area is pretty and nice. The beds are comfortable but next time I plan to stay way closer to Disney. This was far away. I wanted to be away from the hustle and bustle but this was just to far. When there was an accident on the highway it took one hour to make it to the parks. That is a long time with kids. So if you visit here look beyond the gorgeous lobby and pool.

It's pasta you know, it's not chinese noodles\\", and even went back to his corner of the room where the cash register is and scoffed/laughed at us, repeating once more to the chef that \\"they asked if it's supposed to be chewy.\\" (We asked if it's supposed to be THIS chewy, because it was bordering on hard.) Of course I could not tolerate it, this being my first racist encounter after 3 years in the US and I made sure he knew he was being a racist, and to stop being insular thinking that Asians have not tasted pasta before.

Yup, there it is, confirmed on the receipt that I signed. So I take a few more bites... I hit the tomato - it's grainy. Bleh. I hit more chicken... where's the honey mustard?

Years in the future, when we have the technology to solve this problem, Basta Pasta will take over the world."},{"name":"Focaccia","address":"2 Lowell St","city":"Wilmington","stars":"2.5","text":"The food is not my big complaint at Focaccia. The food is between o.k. and good. Since I don't live really that close to Wilmington I wouldn't make a trip back for the food. Way too many fantastic Italian restaurants around. My complaints are a lot of little things they do bad that add up to a bad dinning experience. When we first walked in they had the 3 specials plated and on display in the little waiting area. WHY?? It looked disgusting. I even witnessed a grown man stick his finger in the mashed potatoes! We were informed after we were seated that they had run out of menus and they were waiting on clean silver wear. We did get a menu with the specials, but I had already been introduced to those when I walked in. The wine list was really strange. Not bad, but just a strange selection. No beer on tap, either. When we did get a menu it was filthy.A real pet peeve of mine. Not only was the plastic grubby with big globs of...food?, the paper under the plastic was so covered in stains it made it hard to read the menu. The decor is so dated and tired and not very clean. The booth we sat in was so uncomfortable. Really bad design. It seems to me that the owners are really concentrating on the lounge and ignoring their restaurant. The band was so loud that we had to shout to be heard by our waitress, who was fantastic, by the way. The people from the lounge started spilling over into the restaurant. It was more like a bar with live music with a small eating area, than a restaurant with a lounge. I know it sounds like nit picking but for the prices they charge you expect much more. If Focaccia was a small whole in the wall pizza place with $8 eggplant parm I may be singing a different tune."},{"name":"Monterrey Mexican Restaurant","address":"4924 S Cobb Dr","city":"Smyrna","stars":"3.5","text":"This place is awesome!!!

And while I'm an ardent fan of Amazon and online shopping, there's something special about being able to physically browse books, receive actual human recommendations, and see displays of colorful book covers and delightful words.\\n\\nThat's where Powell's Books comes in.  The flagship store is on Burnside and is conveniently located and accessible from multiple stops of the excellent Portland public transportation system.  With a spacious and welcoming entrance and thoughtfully designed rooms that allow for exploration and discovery, Powell's Books is one of the best bookstores I've ever been in.  \\n\\nTruthfully, I spent 95% of my time in only one section of the store, but just walking around you get a sense of the vastness of the multiple floors, the design-your-own-book self published area, and even a hint of the rare books collection that requires a special pass.\\n\\nEveryone I know who we went with here loved it and I'm sure you will too.  In this age of everything online, Powell's has found a recipe to thrive and survive.  We happily bought lots of books here and even a souvenir or two.  I have no idea what the cost was compared to buying online, but that's the kind of attitude that the very best places engenders when they get the buying experience right (Trader Joe's, Costco, etc.).\\n\\nPowell's Books accepts credit cards, including American Express."},{"name":"Caf√© Luna","address":"612 Main St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Excellent waffles, eggs, and bacon.

The Greek style green beans cannot be beat, served in a red tomato sauce that's slightly sweet and savory. The Moussaka and Pastichio are THE best - imagine the big ole slabs of these with roasted potatoes and green beans -OOOOOOHHHHHHHHHHH! The lamb kokinisto is great - braised lamb in a red sauce - great. It's definitely not a strict Greek restaurant, they serve Italian and American food as well. The desserts are incredible, baklava, chocolate cake, cheese cakes -wooooo. \\nHere's the best part, I recently found out that they serve breakfast - really good breakfast. Huge pancakes, great omelets, Greek sausages, kielbasa.

We ordered the squid ink pasta (so gooooodddddd), calamari (meh), and the stuff clams (amazing!). The price is good for the quality and the quantity of food. You should also try the lobster fra diavolo. Very much worth your money. The one waiter was also the best. \\n\\nWhat might make you hesitate to visit this restaurant is that there are about 5 tables. You will probably sit next right next to the people you stood in line with - and when i say right next to, i mean at the same table.

This meant that there were a TON of people there...at max, I would guess that they were near capacity.\\n\\nIt was standing room only for the first hour or so that I was there...I think they are limiting the number of reservations they take in the future for Nerd Nite.  But the servers were happy to take our order while we were standing around.  They told us it would be 35 minutes or so to get anything out of the kitchen, but we had their trout dip in maybe 5 minutes.\\n\\nYou guys, the trout dip here is AMAZING.  When we got it, it was still hot...the bread wedges were hot and right at that point where they were crispy on the outside and soft on he inside.  So, so tasty.\\n\\nThe servers seemed a little annoyed at the massive influx of people...but having figured that I would have been much more annoyed than they were, I'm not holding that against them at all.  I just heard from a server that they only expected a crowd of 50-60, and ended up with probably 200.  So, ultimately, they did an amazing job taking care of everybody\\n\\nWe will definitely be coming back here.

I even took my 4 year old son for brunch and they made him feel perfectly welcome (not always the case with high end restaurants) and he loved the oysters.\\n\\nOnly thing, and it's a very small complaint, the cocktail sauce was a bit too ketchupy for my taste.

But take a deep breath and find confidence in knowing that there is no wrong choice. The menu features fresh ingredients, and everything is customizable with no extra costs incurred (generally speaking). \\n\\nThe reason I did not give them 5 stars is because although the staff is very accommodating and friendly there is just not enough of them. During my last visit the greeter took my reservation, my order, and bused my table. Whatever they're paying her just isn't enough.
