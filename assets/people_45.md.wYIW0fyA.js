My 13 year old son and I wanted something in our neighborhood that would be relatively fast and healthy. The food here is good, but definitely not top notch- but I knew that going in, and that's ok.  \\n\\nWe went in for happy hour, which is from 4:00 to 6:00pm. We arrived at 5:34pm, and we were seated promptly. Our waitress took our initial order at around 5:45pm. She announced at 5:50pm that it was last call. At that moment, we didn't order. At 5:55pm, my son wanted to order another Las Vegas roll. We ordered it immediately after our waitress took the order from the table across from us. They too, had ordered off the Happy Hour menu. At that time I believed that we would be getting the happy hour price (which is $3 less than normal price) as it was still five min to 6pm.\\n\\nWhen I got the check, they charged me full price for the LV roll. I asked my waitress to make an adjustment, she initially refused. I then requested that she ask her manager and she did- Only to get the response of \\"NO.\\" I brought up the point of telling them that I ordered it before 6pm, they said that it didn't matter, that there was no way for them to override the price. When I asked why they honored the other patrons order, at that specific time, she stated that it was the hostess's fault for giving them that happy hour menu, therefore she had to offer the deal.\\n\\nSo much for customer service. I can't believe that they were willing to loose me, or any customer at that, for $3! Going forward, I'll take my business elsewhere.

At 7 pm we were finally seated - I guess the purpose of reservations hasn't set in with Ray's yet.  After we were seated, the waiter came up and asked us if we had any questions on the menu - didn't mention any specials, tell us his name, or if we'd been to Ray's before (we had not).  My wife ordered the horse-radish encrusted grouper, I ordered the broiled seafood platter.  We ordered a couple of glasses of wine - again, with zero input from the waiter - he was merely there to tell the kitchen what we wanted - he didn't even bring out our orders.  The grouper was bland - no taste of horse-radish at all - and this is supposed to be one of the signature dishes at Ray's - I guess everyone likes bland grouper?  Seafood platter wasn't bad, though the lobster and salmon were both over-cooked.

The side slaw was wilted, undressed and at room temperature. I looked behind the counter before I left and a bunch of plates had the slaw already on them, sitting uncovered on the countertop.

The liver was good - although I think I would have liked it with baguette slices instead of crackers. And maybe a touch of garlic to jazz things  up just a wee bit.  It was quite tasty however.  My steak was delish.  And huge.  No was was I going to finish it.  Fries were super crispy and nice and thin so they had a nice ratio of crispy bits.  I am not a fan of fat fries which just end up being mealy I think.  But I digress.  The steak is a good value.  I was not left with a single bit of room for desert however, which was a mistake.

Luckily, upon getting there we found ample on street parking, so no worries there. It is metered parking, but hey, it's Cambridge.\\n\\nThe food:\\n(Note: not everything on the online brunch menu is actually available at the restaurant so you probably don't want to get your heart set on something in advance.)\\n\\nWe chose to start with the chicken nachos which were very tasty. The pulled chicken worked well with the rest of the dish without overpowering any of the other toppings and the salsa had a perfect amount of heat. The toppings were actually layered pretty well but only on one side, the other side was a just a pile of chips. It isn't that there weren't enough toppings to go around, just that you had to get in there and spread the topping love yourself.\\n\\nI got the Sunrise Burrito as my entree and boy was I expecting more. I know I wasn't at Anna's Taqueria but the burrito was small by any standards, especially considering the price. But it's not just about size, if it were fantastic the lack of sheer girth would be more forgivable. Alas, that was not the case here either. Of the entire burrito I would say two bites actually contained everything that was described on the menu, with the majority of bites being just egg, a few beans and tortilla, as well as the self added sour cream and salsa. The chorizo and cheese were underrepresented entirely. It is my opinion that a good burrito should contain everything the customer paid for in nearly every bite, and this did not measure up in any way. I will say that it was the prettiest plate of the day, sliced in half and splayed open with a pretty little fruit cup of grapes, honeydew and cantaloupe, but unfortunately that is the biggest compliment I can offer.\\n\\nMs. Sarah-pants ordered the Smokehouse Burger with curly fries on the side. This did not have any of the portion issues I had had with my burrito. She ordered it medium-rare and it was cooked perfectly. Flavor wise, It wasn't exceptional nor horrible, merely a fairly bland and forgettable burger with a pile of seasoned fries and a pickle.\\n\\nDessert came through in a big way, and left a good taste in our mouths to finish off our meal. We ordered the special that day. Unfortunately I cannot remember what they named it, but it was a pumpkin cheesecake with a cranberry chutney underneath and a buttery graham cracker crust that I would have been happy to eat sans filling. Certainly the high point of the experience.\\n\\nThe service:\\nWe walked in at just about noon and were seated straight away, at the last open outdoor table no less. We did have to request it rather than being offered the prime outdoor seating by our hostess. It's not a huge deal, but it is always nice to be asked. After being seated it took a few minutes before our waiter appeared, but just as I started to think we'd been forgotten he showed up and all was forgiven. For the rest of the meal the service was good with the only noticeable issue being that we received our entrees within minutes of starting on our app, which actually worked out in this instance since as mentioned my burrito was woefully small, so I knew to keep plowing through my nachos during my main course instead of stopping and having them taken from the table.\\n\\nThe final rundown:\\nFor brunch there are a lot of better, cheaper, heartier options around. You may not get a seat at those places quite so quickly, but as in most things in life, your patience is usually rewarded."},{"name":"Strip","address":"245 18th St","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Um. There are mixed feelings about this place. The food was pretty awesome. The atmosphere and vibe was pretty great. However, service wasn't really there.

The complimentary birthday dessert for my friend was nice of them: brownies with a scoop of ice cream & whip cream. \\n\\nMy friend was peaked about how a table wasn't immediately prepared for us since we had made a reservation, and the fact that they called to confirm the reservation, well, this seemed to be the beginning of a slight decline with my enthusiasm with this place. A quick synopsis of what was wrong: no utensils even after the food was brought out, no seasonings on our table, our little table light wasn't lit, my entr√©e looked plain, and then the roof top bar was closed--on a Friday evening too. \\n\\nI got the lobster burger since I heard this was pretty good. The burger itself was appetizing, but nothing super wowing in any aspect. The mash potatoes I choose as a side was a mistake. It was plain as heck and seemed like it was slabbed on the plate with no care. There was no gravy or any sauce for seasoning nor for appeal. I ended up seasoning the poor thing with salt and pepper. I'm not much of a season user, but in this case, it was much needed. So my entr√©e literally only had the burger, mash potatoes, and some pickles. Plain as can be on a mega plate. Overall, the food was good as everyone seemed to enjoy their food. Such a disappointment.

We went here looking solely for a few cocktails and a nice view. That was my only expectation. And did The Oasis manage to screw it up? Yup.\\n\\nUpon entering we, very specifically but very politely, asked the hostess for a table right up against the railing as we wanted to enjoy the view. We added that if none were available at the moment, we would be more than happy to wait. It was mid-afternoon, there were ample tables available, tons of servers. This was not an unreasonable request. The hostess acknowledged that request then promptly leads us to a table nowhere near a railing, crammed underneath a fan and smashed between four other tables. We looked at her slightly confused, then, still very politely, said \\"I'm sorry, I must have been confusing, we would like a table against a railing so that we can enjoy the view.\\" With this, the hostess audibly huffs, plops the menus down on the crap table, and tells us now she has to walk all the way back up and ask her manager where else she can put us. Then she leaves there and stomps off.  After a few minutes we wonder WTF we're supposed to be doing and we trek back up the stairs to find her on the phone with aforementioned manager, clearly very put out that we really do want the scenic table we asked her for the first time and we weren't making a joke. She caught us recognizing her shit attitude and promptly took us to a railing table like we originally asked for, we thanked her, and she bounded off to give her shit attitude to the next poor patron. \\n\\nSo yay, we now had our lovely table overlooking the lake! What a view, fantastic! A bus boy brought chips and salsa, which were not good - but they're chips and salsa and I'm of the opinion that even bad chips and salsa are pretty good. In a few minutes our server arrived and took our order. While he wasn't very enthused about his job, he wasn't outright awful either. We put our order in, figuring queso, fajitas and a burger should be safe. The server took our empty basket of chips at this time, promising a refill. A few moments later, a busboy brought our queso. We mentioned that we had no chips and he promised to be right back with some. We waited. And we waited. We watched the queso congeal and get hard on the top. And then our entrees arrived, sigh. We told the busboy who brought the entrees to just take the congealed queso back, that we never received any chips to eat it with and now the entrees had arrived. He did so without any comment at all.\\n\\nThe burger and fajitas weren't terrible, they were about what you'd expect at an Applebees. No one got sick, thank god. And that's about all I can say of the food. \\n\\nOur actual server returned after we'd finished eating and dropped off the bill. He didn't ask how it was, if he could bring us anything else. We didn't get offered a refill on the beer or margaritas we'd ordered, water, never did get the chips. His only remark was that he took the queso off our bill as requested. Well, that was big of him. Pay the bill and f-you very much. \\n\\nSo... the whole experience was right on par with the other 575+ Yelp reviews. Crap service, crap food, stunning view. Is the view worth it though? Nope.

Some of the favorites I look forward to are the garlic blue crabs (lots of work but love the flavor), snow crabs, fried clams, and salt and pepper shrimp.

We purchased one plain ricotta cannoli from Mike's and one from Modern.  Both were better than anything I ever had, possibly only comparing to a cannoli I had at Vaccaro's in Baltimore's Little Italy.  Modern's slightly beat out Mike's with each bite.  The shell is thinner than Mike's, flakier and tastier (just by a bit).  The filling tasted more like ricotta and was smoother.  Both were excellent and I would recommend trying both.  Mike's has many more flavors and I think it's a tourist favorite.  Modern focuses primarily on the classic ricotta cannoli.  Modern's is smaller than Mike's for about the same price.  Service was quick.

Here's how it earned itself one lonely star:\\n\\nIt's Friday night, I'm hungry and my friends and I settled for some Hong Kong-style cafe food (soup, noodle and rice dishes with drinks). My standard for this type of \\"cuisine\\" isn't high since there are literally hundreds of these cafes in Richmond. The dishes are the same boring dishes you find everywhere else.\\n\\nFirst impressions of the place: It was busy, long line-ups with an even longer wait list. While queued, I observed the waitress cleaning a table in front of me and she's just sweeping rice, vegetables and noodles from the table onto the seats. I thought to myself, \\"People need to sit on those seats and they're littered with a stranger's left overs\\". Gross.\\n\\nAfter 20 minutes of standing around, we were seated and given our tea. Our waiter didn't bother making eye contact with us or smile. He just herded us into the corner like cattle (Hah.. get it? I'm being serious though.). And it gets worse..\\n\\nThe four of us were selecting our tea and we noticed a large clump of long hair stuck along the inner edges of one of the tea cups. Don't believe me? I've a photo on twitter to prove it, but I refuse to upload it on Yelp. I alerted the waitress and informed her it was disgusting but she said nothing to me and refused to even look me in the eye or apologize. She just took the cup away and returned with another one.\\n\\nThat occurred 10 minutes after being seated since service here sucks as much as their courtesy and manners. Our order was taken, food arrived but I lost most of my appetite. I had a boneless chicken with mushrooms and black pepper corn sauce or whatever - I didn't care from that point on. Why did I bother staying? What's a food review without me trying the food?\\n\\nFood wasn't great; it was mediocre. I reiterate: it's the same boring dishes you find everywhere. Only everywhere else has better service and would actually give a damn if customers found a lock of hair in their tea. \\n\\nI'm done ranting. Don't eat here.

My best friend told me a story about Mike's Pastry. Her husband living in Boston at the time came back to her with a love offering of Mike's Canoli's. He can be a little let's say distracted at times and sat on the box and exposed it to temperatures that were not ideal. Yet she still ate the canolis. Jon actually took us to Mike's on our first trip out to Boston, and I must say I would not hesitate to eat a canoli from Mike's even after being sat on and heated. These things are delicious. i don't even know what the heck is in a canoli I just know I like it. I had a regular canoli and a chocolate chip canoli. The other pastries also looked quite tasty.

The actual place itself is very small, and could not fit more than 10 people at a time at most. Service was good. The waiter was really attentive, though the food itself took a while to get to us, which I believe was due to the high number of people at the time we ordered, and the lack of sufficient staff.\\n\\nWe ordered tostadas. My girlfriend had the cheese tostada, which she said was very good and it seemed to have a lot of cheese.

The meal consisted of \\nSpinach and baby arugula salad with candied pecans, Vermont goat cheese,  strawberries and Balsamic vinaigrette and chicken pot stickers as appetizers.  You would think that the salad would come first (especially since it was listed as the first course on the menu), but it came second. Both were delicious though.  I picked the flat iron steak as my main dish.  Interestingly, the dish came with a breaded, crab topping.  This was not mentioned on their online restaurant week menu.  And we probably wouldn't have come if we had known because my friend is allergic to seafood.  Luckily, they modified the dish and she was able to get it without the crab on it.  I should have made the same modification because I did not like the crab.  The potatoes that came with it were pretty good. For dessert, we shared the cobbler of the day- it was apples and blueberry (not a mix I would have thought of).  It was sooooooooo good.  I would come back just to get that again.

They pour other brands as well.\\n\\n- Super cereal is an excellent, hoppy pale ale\\n- The saison is very good too, although too high in ABV for me.\\n- Hops-on-Ponce is a solid IPA, but should be poured in the larger glass.\\n- Smoked porter is one of the better examples of that breed I've tasted.\\n\\nFood:\\n- Fried green tomato BLT very well prepared and tasty. They probably should offer it sans bacon though, to make another vegetarian option.\\n- Tots are spectacular.\\n- Red cabbage side is good, maybe a bit shallow in flavor\\n- Seasonal tomatoes very good.\\n- St. Louis ribs are TDF. You get four meaty bones but I could eat three orders, they're so good.\\n- Caprese pizza is solid. The pizzas are big enough for a somewhat filling meal for one person or to share if you get a couple of apps. I ate half the pizza and one order of ribs and was sated.\\n\\nOverall, the food is cut above pub fare, making this a true gastropub. While the beer is not expensive, the food will set you back a few bucks. You do get what you pay for, though.\\n\\nService was top shelf the first time we came, during a peak Saturday time. After being seated at the end of the long banquet (the bar was full), our server got us drinks fairly quickly and then dropped by every five minutes or so until we were ready to order food, and checked up often after that.\\n\\nSecond visit on a slow early Thursday was at the bar. Plenty of seats and the bartender took care of me just fine. Weirdly, he asked for a credit card to start a tab. I'm not used to that in Atlanta and as I always pay cash, I just laid a twenty on the bar. That seemed to satisfy protocol.\\n\\nWebsite menu is incomplete - it doesn't list the sides, which are offered with sandwiches or ala carte. Theres at least one entree I've seen photographed here on Yelp that isn't on the menu as well.\\n\\nTorched Hop can be quite loud when crowded. Not so much during off-peak.

I've considered driving five hours just for Mike's Pastries. I've even calculated the cost of shipping the pastries to my home in a refrigerated box... until I realized that would cost me a couple of hundred bucks.\\n\\nThis place is good. Real good.

We had our wedding ceremony and reception at this hotel and it proved to be an absolutely horrible hotel.  Many things went wrong with the catering side of things, but the hotel accommodations were atrocious as well. First off, my wife, the bride of the event, was VERBALLY HARASSED by two of the HOTEL STAFF members and PHYSICALLY ASSAULTED by one member of the HOTEL STAFF!  We also had many issues with the reservations department, our guests were very frustrated as they were unable to book rooms at the rate we were guaranteed. After several phone calls with the reservations department we were still unable to get this issue fully resolved and our guest rooms were higher than we were guaranteed they would be. Their front desk staff was incompetent even with dealing with basic issues such as the cleanliness of the rooms. Rooms were not available for our guests at 3pm as they were guaranteed to be, which caused a lot of issues for our guests who were traveling and needed to get ready prior to the wedding ceremony. The cleanliness of the rooms were atrocious, many of our guests reported mice in their rooms, and the front desk staff would not even replace the linens in the room or assist with the situation. One of our guests even reported their toilet seat was located in the middle of the hallway and it took several hours for the maintenance staff to correct the problem. The security at this hotel was also very concerning. All of the doors to the outside, although they had key card readers, were open 24/7 allowing anyone to enter the hotel. The on staff security guard was even lower than a \\"rent-a-cop\\" and was unable to assist with the above mentioned physical assault by a hotel staff member on my wife, he stood idly by as the entire situation ensued.  When we went to get the police report to file charges against the hotel staff member that physically assaulted my wife, we found out that the video surveillance equipment was non-operational. Last but not least, the building is hideously out of date and they were doing construction in the lobby and sports bar even when we were promised the construction would be completed by our event.  \\nThe hotel staff proved to be incompetent and when we went to seek assistance from the General Manager regarding the physical assault situation , he refused to meet with us or even acknowledge the situation. We escalated the situation and got in touch with their corporate offices who eventually got us an apology letter, unfortunately about 4 months after the situation occurred and did everything they could to brush the situation under the rug. \\nThe Boulder Millennium Harvest House Hotel is by far the worse hotel experience I have had in my entire life, and the fact that we invited our friends and family to stay at this establishment is embarrassing. I warn you DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL!!! Millennium Hotels is just another money hungry corporation that obviously puts the all might dollar as a priority over its guests, needless to say, we will never step foot inside a Millennium Hotel ever again!"},{"name":"Modern Pastry Shop","address":"257 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Thank you for being a wonderful Italian bakery that reminded me of the wonderful cannolis that I used to get in NYC."},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"There's not much you can say about Mike's that hasn't already been said : YUM YUM YUM...and YUM!

Although I was having some issues with what I ordered, my friend's entree was very good. I ordered the rainbow trout St. George style (Pan-saut√©ed, topped with saut√©ed crabmeat, served over herb beurre blanc). The fish itself was nicely seasoned and it had a bit of a kick to it, which I liked very much, however it came in a bed of thick cream sauce, which was distracting me from the fish and the vegetables. I was aware that it came with a cream sauce I just did not expect the large amount of it.  Every time I took a bite of the fish, its flavor would be overpowered by the cream sauce. My friend ordered the special, which was a redfish with four blackened shrimp and roasted red peppers and mushrooms cooked in parchment paper. This was accompanied by grilled asparagus and dirty rice. This plate was so much better. All of the flavors blended nicely and the presentation was creative. No bed of thick cream sauce to get in the way of the flavors. \\n\\nFor dessert, we ordered the two bread puddings on the menu: the chocolate and the south Louisiana served with whiskey sauce and topped with vanilla ice cream. Although they were generally good, they were not outstanding. I like my bread pudding rugged, when I can see the little cubes of bread that went into making it and then the crunchy, caramelized top. These two puddings were too \\"clean\\", in that they lacked the interplay between different consistencies and textures that others have.  Also, I could not really taste the whiskey in the whiskey sauce.     \\n\\nThe service was good although not particularly friendly.

I believe they have 3 or 4 locations in CO now.  It gets packed at lunch, so try to go before 12 or after 1 if possible.\\n\\nThe specialty here is a potato burrito.  Yeah, pretty weird for a specialty.  The potatoes are like breakfast potatoes with heavy seasoning.  The potato burrito comes with, uhhh, potatoes, caramelized onions, sour cream, and cheese.  \\nThey also offer meats including carne asada, chicken mole, chicken bay leaf, carnitas and chile verde.\\nNote - I read in a review online that the carne asada is more like stew meat, so I would avoid this option.  \\nDamn, makes me miss Southern California and perfectly cooked, thin sliced carne asada...\\n\\nYou can also choose to add meat to your potato burrito, or you can order a regular meat burrito and add potatoes.  The major difference is that the meat burritos include options of Spanish rice and either black or pinto beans. Check out the website for a full breakdown of the burritos and options:\\nhttp://www.bigcityburritoboulder.com/\\n\\nYou first have to choose from one of the seven tortilla options.  They warm the burrito with the cheese on it which is a nice touch.  They then add generous amounts of beans and rice, but a rather small amount of meat (slightly less than an ice cream scoop).  Next comes a large amount of potatoes.  From there you get to pick from the four different salsas (sounds like Chipotle no?) and you can add sour cream and/or guacamole.  Note to all the vegans out there that they add sour cream to their guacamole.\\n\\nSeeing as this was my first time here, I went with the carnitas burrito and added both potatoes and guacamole.  The total for the burrito came out to $7.50.\\n\\nMy burrito was absolutely huge and was actually quite tasty.  The carnitas was a little dry, but had good flavor; I just wish there has been more of it.  Given all the dry items on this burrito, I would recommend having them add extra extra green sauce, which adds flavor and wetness without a ton of heat.  \\n\\nThey also offer 40 or so bottled hot sauces of varying exoticness, but I stuck with my tried and true Chalula.\\n\\nThe burrito was tasty, but not extraordinary.  For me personally, I prefer a real authentic burrito, so while these Americanized options are okay, I can not recommend them.

Nothing seemed particularly Japanese about the assortment of pains au chocolat and I was a bit confused as to why I couldn't  buy the same mochi ice cream (which they now have!!!) and  lychee jellies that I typically scurry off with from their Porter location. However as I've opened my mind and the bakery has opened up its menu, I've started to enjoy the cafe a lot more.\\n\\nPastries: Somewhere in this establishment, there is a pastry chef who knows what's up (which is a lot more than most other places can say) and the staff members seem to know the recipe in-and-outs and are heavily invested in all of the products. Accordingly, the pastries are AMAZING. I haven't encountered a bad one yet. My personal favorites: the African Queen, An Pan, the Cafe Japonaise, and the Ichigo Cream.\\n\\nAs of right now there are only three vegetarian sandwiches: the caprese and grilled veggie paninis and the fresh veggie sandwich, which is the grilled veggie panini without the grilling part. All three are fine, the caprese is probably the best. Before I stopped eating meat, I was fond of the ham and gruyere, but I found the chicken katsu to be entirely overwhelming. \\n\\nDrinks: With the exception of the hot chocolate, this is one of the weaker parts of their selection, in my opinion. They have a rather strong Thai iced tea that is tasty, but I can't handle it on a daily basis. Their teas are delicious though they are not loose leaf as the sign claims. That said, I think I would much prefer that they worked out the kinks of some of their cafe drinks as opposed to introducing beer to the establishment. Beer would totally change the atmosphere.\\n\\nPeople watching and atmosphere: Cafe Japonaise is one of the rare cafes that doesn't seem to have a specific patron. I catch BU students hanging out here about as often as local hipsters with a sprinkling of middle aged folks on lunch break. Part of the appeal is probably the fact that the space is so big and rarely crowded. There are a number of  easily accessible outlets and the wifi is free (you'll need to ask for the password though). \\n\\nCredit card policy: Cafe Japonaise has one of the best hybrid credit card policies ever. I understand that small businesses lose money on small credit/debit card purchases due to the fees credit companies assess, but small businesses also need to be realistic about urban dwellers' increasing preference not to be carrying cash on their person.  Cafe Japonaise simply charges $.25 per purchase beneath their $8 limit. I don't mind paying an extra quarter to offset your credit card fees when you give me the option to. I often announce the fact that I'm ok with the $ .25 charge before they ask. (I'm just that damn excited about it!) I wish more places would adopt similar policies.

I live around the area, and Denny's/Pho 99 was not gonna do it for me. So I checked out Yelp and we found ourselves here, since it closed at midnight. \\n\\nConsidering the time we went to the restaurant, parking was no issue and there was no lineup. But maybe during the dinner rush or the weekend, I can see it definitely being crowded. \\n\\nWe were going to order our own individual food, like rice bowls, etc. But we saw the Tambom Signature and decided to try it out. It's essentially a REALLY BIG hot plate with a variety of food. If you look at the menu photos uploaded on Yelp, there is a photo that shows what it looks like and the different options. \\n\\nWe chose the crab soup for the middle part of the plate. For the sides, we decided on half cheese, half corn and chili shrimp. We also ordered 3 bowls of rice. The concept was quite different from the other Korean places I've been to. Normally, they either offer only soup or just a dish, not both. But as soon as it was put on the grill, and the heat was turned on, the soup started to bubble and the cheese started to melt, and I was instantly sold. We ordered the large, but we could have gotten away with the small, especially with the endless sides. \\n\\nThe soup wasn't too spicy, and I liked that the waitress broke apart the crab pieces so we could all grab our own legs, etc. But she kept the big shell pieces in the soup for the flavour. The soup itself was flavourful, without being too overbearing on the sodium and spice. Just enough for me to keep eating it without having flaming regrets. There was chunks of veggies in it too! The waitress also said if we ran out of broth, she could refill it at no charge. SCORE. \\n\\nThe corn and cheese reminded me of an old Korean spot I would frequent on the weekends that made the best cheese corn ever!!! So that was a solid star right there. The chili shrimp was more on the sweet chili sauce side, but still pretty good. I liked how they had veggies as well on the sides, and it wasn't all seafood. Overall, after tip, this meal was about $67, which was about $22 per person. And I'm sure we would have spent that amount (give or take) individually, since a regular rice bowl was about $15-$16. And we definitely left full and VERY satisfied. \\n\\nOverall, great experience. They didn't rush us while we were eating, but closer to 11:45pm, they asked us to pay (we were done eating and just talking) so they could settle.

Pizza is three simple ingredients: Dough, Cheese and Sauce. But combined properly those three simple ingredients add up to such complex flavors.  Like Italian mad scientists, they've perfected the formula of combining flour, cheese, sauce, fresh toppings, and a very hot wood-fired oven to make the perfect pizza.  And luckily I know where they're located so I can reap the benefits. \\n\\nAs far as the other Italian fare, Vespaio has a very authentic Italian feel to it.  The food is spot on.  They have a variety of fresh salads and authentic Italian dishes to satisfy any Italian cravings.  Risotto is definitely something to try and, even though not a typical Italian dish, their crab bisque is outstanding. \\n\\nClean, relaxed atmosphere.  Friendly staff.

The place is pretty cool during the day for families and tourists, and stands independent of this review.)  \\n\\nWell, my wife and I decided during a recent vacation trip to Orlando to hit Downtown Disney/(not-as-much-a-)Pleasure Island as an after-hours/after-theme-parking nightspot, to wind down the rest of our evening.  Much to our disappointment, PI has become a sad shell of its former self. As a result of Disney's decision (prompted by guest requests supposedly) to make the area more family-friendly - even during the later hours of the evening - all of the \\"nightclubs\\" in the area have been closed to make room for more places to dine and shop.  So, if you're expecting to hit PI with the aspirations of dancing yer @ off throughout the night, sorry - you'll have to search elsewhere.  As seems to be the trend in most places in the South, apparently the only activities worth paticipating in are feeding one's face and spending or drinking oneself to oblivion.  How extremely frustrating... The nightclubs at PI weren't the best, they weren't the worst, but they WERE at least.  After a full day of paying financial homage to \\"the mouse\\" at the various theme parks (which are admittedly wonderful), it used to be a \\"pleasure\\" to get out in an adult environment and just have a good time, without the worry of screaming, uncontrollable kids or their equally miserable parents, that way b/c of the former.  But now it seems that there is no reprieve for the over 21 crowd, aside from drinking and eating the night away. *sigh*\\n\\nJust so we're clear, I'm not throwing off on families, or parents, or kids, or anyone else that wants to have good clean fun.  I'm right there with ya - I'm not looking for drama, just variety.  And with the latest change to PI, that search yields null results for those that would enjoy something more/different than the business-as-usual amusement park offerings.

Our check-in representative was pleasant and jovial and cheerfully advised us on the best methods for getting to the downtown festivities with the least amount of hassle for a girl in heels. The room was modern, well appointed and even smelled new. It was very clean and we thought the king sized bed was very comfortable. Our view wasn't the best, but it didn't take away from how pleasant our stay was. We felt our TV was a little small, but we're spoiled at home. I loved the all tile shower and rain-fall style shower head, which conveniently was already pointed away from me so I wouldn't be doused with cold water when I turned it on (the glass on that side of the shower is fixed.) When we arrived back around midnight, we realized we had forgotten some things and went to the pantry. When it didn't have everything we were looking for, I approached the front counter asking for the items and the same gentleman who checked me in earlier in the evening assured me he would track down my requests and bring them to our room. There wasn't a hint of irritation in his voice despite the fact that I was asking for club soda at midnight.

Unfortunately when I got my dessert I  realized that they don't even use real whip cream. Also the quality of the ice cream was very poor. I ordered the flan sundae. The description of the flan sundae  I ordered was inaccurate. They're not actually using flan but flan flavored cheesecake I think. The quality was very poor so I wasn't really sure if it was cheesecake or not. The ice cream is self was very poor quality. It was very icy and chalky.

It was absolutely half prepped and then finish cooked to ordered (most American Chinese places do this). So my rice and chicken/Broc we're good. The beef teriyaki was absolutely awful. Tasted bad, super dry, no flavor. The chicken wings were terrible as well. They say they give you 2 wings (always 2  whole wings?) They gave 3 but they are like KFC deep fried.

I'm sad to not be able to give more stars and praise because I want it to do well and I hope the staff don't take it too personally because they are so nice and seem to care about the food and experience. \\n\\nThe chicken sandwich was overdone and probably had too much batter on it. The flavor of the condiments didn't cover the overcooked flavor and texture of the chicken or blend harmoniously with it. It is dark and I was trying to taste the papaya and avocado. I couldn't taste the avocado. I did feel the papaya texture. I did taste the pepper. The staff offered to redo the chicken sandwich, but we said no and I ate the whole thing because I don't like to waste food. \\n\\nMy companion ordered the farro dish and the lentil dish. The farro was reminiscent of Thai and Chinese food (food I grew up with) Both are wonderful cuisines that stand up well on their own, but this wasn't exquisite. From the 1- 2 bites I sampled, it seemed too salty. \\n\\nMy companion thought some bites of the lentils were good and other bites were not. I thought the rice was clumpy. There was some bitterness to the dish and I thought the texture was off for lentils. My companion did not finish either dish and I didn't want to either. (I'm tiny, but I love to eat and if food tastes good there's a high chance I'll ask for more or dip my spoon in a few times). \\n\\nThe bowl of ramen was flavors I personally don't like such as whatever mushrooms were in there and the rye croutons. I think, but don't know for sure that the noodles were common premade noodles from a factory. The bowl just wasn't my cup of tea.\\n\\nI get the concept of Little Donkey being a motley of delicious ventures and I like the attitude of learning and improving. My overall thought about Little Donkey is that sometimes, it is best to master the  traditional flavors you are inspired by before you experiment. (I have a lot of respect for traditional food for many reasons.

The owner was very knowledgeable and didn't hesitate to share her South African culture when we had questions about the food and seasonings (which were incredibly delicious, by the way).\\n\\nMy mom had the shakshouka and I had the lamb bacon sarmie. The shakshouka was seasoned really well with delicious feta sprinkled on top of a perfectly runny egg. The owner even brought out the spices for us to get a smell of them. My bacon sarmie was incredibly soft and moist, with a really pleasant lamb flavor from the bacon. I enjoyed it so much I don't know if I could bring myself to order anything else. We finished with the bread pudding topped with rooibos gelato. It was really delicious. I couldn't believe she makes the gelato herself. I could eat a bucket of it. \\n\\nOn top of the great food, there are so many little details that make this place awesome. The laid back feel, the assorted vintage flatware, even the tables and chairs. It is open yet intimate, a great place to enjoy a meal and the company of others.\\n\\nLast, I hope the owner isn't paying too much attention to the single one star review. If that guy couldn't wait just a couple of minutes for some incredibly delicious coffee, maybe he should have walked to Starbucks down the road.

This is especially impressive because it is located on one of the shadiest streets in Chinatown.   As soon as you walk into Ginza, you are greeted by a man behind a booth and women wearing Yukatas (spring type Kimonos).  When I go, the wait isn't particularly too long, and the environment feels like you're being summoned in for a tea ceremony.\\n\\nThe waitresses give you approximately 3 menus, one general, one with specials, and another for alcoholic beverages.  They also hand you a heated cloth, which is given to cleanse your hands before your delectable meal.\\n\\nBecause there is so much to choose from, it is hard for me to decide what to order.  Therefore I just let my friend pick; lucky for me, I like whatever she picks out.  \\n\\nGinza hands down has the best Avacado salad I've ever tasted.  Theres a good ratio of avacado, to cucumbers, to crab meat, and to Japanese Mayo.  Delicious!  Usually we end up ordering another because it is just . that . good.\\n\\nWe also order a few other appetizers including Hotate Hokkayaki (sp?) which is baked scallops with a mixter of some type of mayo and crab baked into the scallop shell itself.  Holy Crap.  DELICIOUS.\\n\\nAnd, lets not forget about the Agedashi Tofu (sp?).  It comes with four pieces that sit in this type of soup based broth;  So delicious!\\n\\nAs for the sushi, I've had the Bombay Maki, Dragon Maki, Crazy Maki, the Volcano Maki, and the Catipillar Maki.  A majority of these are on the special menu and are a bit pricier than the other rolls, but they are oh so delicious!  Anything with tempura, eel, avacados or scallops score high on my list.\\n\\nThe Ice cream mochi are also delicious, but are over priced.  They have different flavors including red bean, tiramisu, mango, and green tea.\\n\\nParking in Chinatown/Downtown areas is always a huge bummer, so the best way of getting there is hopping on the T and taking a nice walk.  \\n\\nThe only HUGE downfall is that Ginza is so pricey!

Both are cash only.\\n\\nModern Pastry has two sections to it--a larger cafe-esque store on the left with more tables and a wider variety of offerings, and a smaller grab&go segment on the right with a few tables and no trashcan (which is why I figured it's grab&go).\\n\\nWe ordered the ricotta cannoli with a plain shell and pistachio toppings, $3.50 total, cash only. $0.50 more for a chocolate dipped or chocolate covered shell. The server went to the back to prepare our cannoli (i.e., pipe our virgin shell with cream). Since we were in the grab&go store, he placed our cannoli in a box and wrapped it with string. We then proceeded to undo all his hard work by devouring the cannoli a minute later.\\n\\nWhy did we prefer Modern Pastry over Mike's? The key is in how the cannoli is composed: made to order or prepped in advance. Piping in the cream at the last moment, as Modern Pastry does, keeps the crispy, crunchy deep-fried pastry dough from being softened by cream. We also thought that Modern Pastry's cream was lighter and more homogenous in texture, though that might be due to the fact that we ordered the traditional ricotta filling at Modern Pastry versus an Oreo filling at Mike's.\\n\\nAs Jack R. put it, Modern Pastry wins for the quality of their cannoli. Mike's wins for the variety of their fillings.\\n\\nTo me, Modern Pastry is the cannoli king. Though word on the street is that Maria's Pastry Shop is now the place to be!?

Boy, was I wrong.\\n\\nThe menu inside does not even have translations or descriptions, and most of the staff don't speak English enough to answer questions. Pro tip: there is a laminated menu hanging in the window (I didn't see copies inside) that has descriptions of what everything is.\\n\\nThe food is served on metal trays like you find in real Indian restaurants (in India) -- like your school cafeteria lunch trays, where the food goes into little separate compartments, except metal.\\n\\nLest you think I was seduced by the gimmick of a metal tray into thinking the food was good... It was really, really good. So far I've had a masala dosa (huge pancake made from rice flour, filled with a mix of potatoes and spices) and the chole masalewala (chickpeas cooked with tomatoes and \\"exotic spices\\"). In the little tiny compartments they put an assortment of chutneys and sauces for your dipping and mixing pleasure. \\n\\nEating here is quick and dirty... and by that I don't literally mean the place is dirty. There aren't many tables, and the ones that are there are fake-wood formica, with small metal napkin dispensers. No frills. You order your food and when it is ready (within 5 minutes) it is handed to you across the counter. If you want to buy a drink you pay for it and get it yourself. But, everything is super cheap. $6 for a generous portion of chole masalewala with rice. $6 for the masala dosa too.\\n\\nOne thing I love here is that you can actually get unsweetened masala chai - you add the sugar yourself. One thing I didn't like was the mango lassi. It was weirdly thick and orange.

Therefore, let's begin with the old adage \\"you get what you pay for\\".  While service is friendly,  that's just part of the equation here.   It just can't negate the void of flavor, quality and freshness.  Let's start with the veggie pakoras, the extra thick donut-like crust blotches most of the flavor.  The thickness of the crust does create an illusion of quantity, similar to fried rice or noodles at a chinese lunch special.    I can give an example to help illustrate, Little Cesars or Cici's Pizza vs. thin crust Neapolitan Style / NY crust.   \\n\\nNext, we shall talk about their dosas, I will admit their crepe is quite large and presentation is decent, brownie points here.   The dosa filling was nice to say the least.   However, their sambar is watery void of most ubiquitous indian spices used in \\"south indian\\" cooking.   The sambar is analogous to bbq sauce on bbq chicken.   Chicken alone is just blah, similarly the potatoes used in most of the dishes at this place would be blah as  stand alone.   The samosas were definitely deep fried at time of order, points for that!   but the filling was more of mush similar to frozen veggies thawed out- another deduction.  Although, we can't ascertain for sure but any discerning foodie can spot this flaw.  Let's move on to their 3 sauce trio -Green Chutney was the best, drum roll......................while I like the Olek Vietnamese chili paste, just didn't expect this - no points lost on that.

Okay I am so impressed by this place its not funny.  We just wanted to give it a go because we've had a hard time finding GOOD coney dogs around here.  (Before everyone mails me, yes we've been to DF's downtown, not impressed)  We got 2 Greyhounds (chili dogs)- I got the mom sized, he got the dad sized.  We got a kid sized onion and mustard only to split.  For sides we got tater tots and the mac and cheese wedges which aren't listed on the website but are in store.  All of that and 2 drinks for $16.\\n\\nThe people here are so nice and make you feel like family.  They were talking to 2 guys who had just gotten a Dawg Pound (1 lb hot dog) and told him it was 3000 calories!  I don't think the guy cared.  A couple came in and he was explaining each dog and apparently there is a 10 year old boy in me that comes out via giggle as he told them \\"the bigger you go the longer and thicker they get.\\"  The chili dog was perfect.  It's so hard to find good chili for chili dogs any more that isn't either runny or looks like Alpo.  The mac and cheese wedges were awesome and perfectly cooked.  I was kind of concerned about getting tots since others seemed to not have luck but ours were cooked perfectly and better yet, NO SALT!!  Most places that serve tots salt them beyond being edible.  It's sad I was so excited to see this but this is all we run into now at restaurants.  Little nuggets o' salt licks.  \\n\\nMy only complaint is actually my own fault.  I like my dogs grilled or more of a char on the outside and these weren't.  They were boiled with a slight grill.  So I asked before we left if they are able to do them grilled and he said whatever the customer wants, the customer gets.  He can grill it or fry it if you want a ripper  and went into why the turkey dog is the best to use for a ripper and explained that hot dogs split because of fillers and was just knowledgeable as hell about his all beef products as well as others who use cheaper quality.  They hand shred their cheese too.  I applauded him on the lack of salt on the tots.  He said people oversalt the tots because the salt retains heat longer every time they reheat and these are made to order and there's salt on the table if you want it.  For what I would've taken off for the lack of a crust on the dog, I have to add back for sheer customer service and knowledge of the product.

A few minutes later the waitress came back to ask me what I ordered since she forgot. 10 minutes passed and no drinks.

The wild boar ribs were pretty good - an acceptable level of gaminess, edges crisp, and the meat fell off the bone.  They were just too sweet for my taste (I generally don't like my bbq sweet), but my guess is it's intentional to help cut the gaminess of the boar.  In my eyes, the highlight of the night was actually the duck proscuitto.  It tastes exactly as you'd imagine - duck heaven!  My friend generously let me have 3 of the 4 slices since he's a Lambert's regular.  I also mastered up the courage to try foie for the first time - I figured in spread form it was less likely to be off putting in texture.  Indeed it was super smooth and buttery in flavor.  They also took care to toast the baguette on the grill, which was a nice touch.  To drink, I had the Live Oak Schwarzbier, a local black lager since they didn't have any darker beers on tap.

For the first time in 30 years - we were turned away and asked to leave because we could not be accomodated. \\n\\nWe were hungry and left to hustle. Finding somewhere else was way too last minute - all other restaraunts in the area were booked solid.

An amazing dinner here may push it nearer 5 star territory, but I believe that 5 stars are not to be thrown around lightly.\\n\\nFirst, I have to address my biggest problem with this place: the Specials board. It's in an odd location that's out of view of customers. I have to sneak behind the host stand to see it, and then the servers all look at me strangely as if I were stepping into their domain. On every visit I've had to get up from my table at least once and walk over to see it, either because the server could not explain the specials in sufficient detail or, on today's visit, the server completely omitted the \\"Grain Salad of the Day\\". I asked what it was today, and he said that they no longer do a \\"Grain Salad of the Day\\", even though it was on the menu. Knowing that I saw it before I was seated, I got up and walked back to the awkward specials board and there it was, Quinoa Salad, with about 10 delicious ingredients that I would have loved to hear about without getting up. PLEASE either post your specials board where customers can see it, or even better have a small printout with each menu that customers can look at. Even when the servers have been able to remember all the specials, they always left out details or ingredients that were important, at least to me. Small details matter when great food is involved.\\n\\nNow on to the food.\\n\\nShrimp Po'boy - Perfect. Nice large fresh shrimp, perfectly battered and fried. Great lemon garlic aioli (although today it had been changed to smoked tomato aioli, which sounds equally tasty), great cabbage slaw, and great fries - thin cut, lightly browned and crispy. Not a traditional Po'boy roll but it was good and worked well. My only complaint here is that \\"garlic aioli\\" is redundant. \\"Aioli\\" literally means \\"garlic oil\\", or garlic mayonnaise.\\n\\nThe Sala - Very Good. Lightly smoked chicken in chunks, tender and not dry. The cilantro mint yogurt was delicious and worked well with this sandwich. The concept of \\"fries on the sandwich\\" is different but with these perfectly crispy fries it works well. The bolillo bun was perfect - ever so lightly toasted and soft.\\n\\nSalmon Burger - Good. This was a daily special. It wasn't bad, but I can see why it's not on the regular menu.\\n\\nIn summary, I'd say this is a great restaurant.

So sweet you don't need any oil.   We got a flat bread to start which was actually larger than expected and very good.  I ordered the duck w/ crispy duck leg confit which was the best duck I've had anywhere.  Tender and rich with a delicious sauce, but the best part was the crispy leg confit.  Not usually a fan, but it was cooked to perfection.  Crunchy and salty but not overly fried.

At first, things started alright. The server was friendly, got our drinks out promptly, and we enjoyed the outdoor patio seating. \\n\\nThen our food came. There were four of us at the table and two of us ordered the chicken w/ brussel sprouts. We also ordered the shrimp/avocado salads. The salads were pretty good and came w/ dressing that had a lillte kick to it. There really wasn't much avocado in it though. Unfortunately, only after we'd taken a couple bites, we realized both orders of the chicken breasts were still raw in places. The server was apologetic and offered to make us another, but I think we were turned off at that point. She did comp the two chicken entrees, which was the right thing to do.\\n\\nFirst issue: really isn't about the undercooked chicken. That can happen to anyone. It's the way they handled it. If I were the manager of a restaurant where two guests had just consumed raw chicken on my watch, I would be front and center at their table w/ my apologies. The manager never even came over, leaving the server to take the brunt of it all.\\n\\nSecond issue: Since the restaurant is within walking distance of the concert arena, we noticed a line forming out front of folks waiting for tables. There were 7 in our group, so we had two tables on the patio. I let the server know we'd crowd into 1 so they could seat the next party in line. They thanked us, but 20 mins later as we were still enjoying our cocktails (after we finished eating), said we should probably go into the bar area if we wanted to order more cocktails. Excuse me? We just gave you one of our tables and now you want both??\\n\\nThird issue: So we go into the bar, since they encouraged us to finish our cocktails there and 3 times, the bartender advises my friend he doesn't have the drink she's requesting. Now if I'm a bartender and a person requests something I'm out of, I should be the one to recommend something similar my guest might enjoy. Instead, all he kept repeating was, \\"We're out of that too.\\"\\n\\nSo this one started out well, but when things don't go as planned, they really struggle to make it right for their customers."},{"name":"The OASIS on Lake Travis","address":"6550 Comanche Trl","city":"Austin","stars":"2.5","text":"Overall bad experience.

The white vegetable fried rice was amazing. White rice sauteed with Chinese broccoli, American broccoli, carrots, mushrooms and onions. The ginger scallion lobster had just the right amount of sweet and sour balance, although the lobsters were small. The salt and pepper deep fried calamari was my favorite. The calamari was tender and fried to perfection. I highly recommend this dish. I do not care for the lo mein at all. It was flavorless and the noodles were dry. The seafood nest was stir-fried lobster, shrimp, calamari, carrots, and mushrooms resting on a bed of shredded deep fried potato. Very flavorful. The food was great. Our waiter gave us a complimentary dessert when he delivered our bill. I'm not sure what the name of the name, but it was a tapioca and condensed milk pudding. Two thumbs down.

The bar seating tempted me but I wanted to see the restaurant so I let the greeter seat me at a two-top.\\n\\nAfter taking in the coolness, the first thing I noticed was the music was a bit loud - I didn't catch all that the greeter and the water guy said to me, but I'm hearing impaired. Normals probably won't have trouble, and I believe it got turned down while I was there because I didn't have near as much trouble with my server, who was awesome, by the way. That was the second thing I noticed - service is great here.\\n\\nPerfect chips with two salsa varieties, red(ish) mild and green spicier. I liked them both.\\n\\n The menu is not huge but there's still a lot to choose from. I considered asking my awesome server for a suggestion based on the premise of someone on a one-time visit, but I know servers sometimes hate that question. I asked her anyway and received a well-considered response. So, given this was a lunch visit and after contemplating the puffy tacos, we decided on the El Lopez - two cheese enchiladas, queso puff, crispy beef taco and guacamole salad. If it were a dinner visit, she recommended the short rib. \\n\\nAnd I went with the cucumber/lime agua fresca drink, which I really liked - I had two. Apparently that's not the best seller here? Server was mildly surprised I liked it and gave me a third to-go drink after the meal. Awesome.\\n\\nEl Lopez: came out fairly quickly on a nice hot plate with a side plate of beans & rice. Everything good and about the right amount of food for lunch. Basically a well-executed enchilada/taco plate with a couple of unusual sidekicks. The queso puffy thing is not structurally substantial but very interesting, and the guacamole salad sits on a hollow crispy shell thingy. As a plate, it all worked together quite nicely. Beans & rice were good, too.\\n\\nExcellent service - did I mention that? \\n\\nPricing is higher than what you might be used to with Tex-Mex (or Mex-Tex, as they refer to the food), but it is about right for the whole package - food, coolness and service. I'll be back for that short rib."},{"name":"Little Donkey","address":"505 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"We had the matzo ball ramen, manti, and short rib.

In fact, I would say that the flavor in the broth was the second best (next to Luc Lac) that I've had. So, if this is all you are about and this restaurant is in a convenient location for you, it might be your new spot for dinner or take out on the cheap. Unfortunately, this is where the good things end for Pho Thien. \\n\\nI began to have reservations about this place from the moment I saw the parking lot. It is not easy to park there and certainly not to back up into the main street to get out. The inside of the restaurant is a little sad (as is the outside) and the murals on the wall do not really fit in with the restaurant for me. The Jazz music in the background was definitely out of place for a pho restaurant. \\n\\nThe servers were both very bleh and added absolutely nothing to our experience. We were asked if we were ready to order in less than 5 minutes from entering the front door. They have something like 50+ meals, so any normal human needs more than 2 minutes to even just read through it. They weren't rude but they definitely weren't warm and inviting. \\n\\nAgain, the pho was pretty good, especially the broth. I liked the fresh basil still on the stem that accompanied the soup. My gf ordered the regular sized soup with lean brisket and only got 3 slices of meat. Even for a 115 girl this was not enough. I got the signature dish (the Pho Thien). Definitely had enough meat but I didn't like all of them. The meatballs were downright bad, and and fatty brisket and the tripe were not my thing either. Would have preferred veggies to the meats!\\n\\nWhen we were done with our meal, we waited. And waited. And waited. Nothing. No bill. Didn't check in with us. The same thing was happening with the couple next to us, who eventually asked for a check and were told they could go up front to pay...that was definitely not made clear anywhere and I found it a little annoying that they would have just let us wait forever. \\n\\nOverall, I probably wouldn't even go back if I was in the area. Maybe for takeout if it was super convenient and I was craving pho, but otherwise my experience was very lackluster."},{"name":"New York Pizza Exchange","address":"2810 Paces Ferry Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Over priced poor quality pizza.

To the point that the hype begins to make you jaded because you have been let down before? Well that happened to me, but with a much different result. Months before trying HTC people would not stop talking about how good the chicken was, or how amazing the Mac and Cheese is, and the ranch, how could I forget the ranch? People were going crazy for HTC! So I finally decided to see what the hype was all about. Is the chicken really that good? Will the Mac and Cheese honestly fill a void in my jaded heart that has been broken so many times by hype surrounding new eatery's in Columbus? Is the ranch really life changing that it will make me call all the people I have wronged in life and ask them for their forgiveness? Yes. The answer is YES and here is how it went down. I ordered the Boneless meal and went with the double Mac and Cheese because I was feeling adventurous (hungover). This is when it began, total chicken euphoria. As I dipped my perfectly fried chicken into the ant sized swimming pool of ranch dressing that I had prepared, my pupils dilated, like a scene pulled straight from Requiem for a Dream. My taste buds erupted, sweat began to bead on my forehead, memories of my childhood played in my head, images of puppies, candy and laughter. It was really happening, an establishment that finally lived up to the hype. HTC changed my entire perspective on fried chicken. The chicken was so perfectly crisp and seasoned that it made Colonel Sanders look like Gomer Pyle with Guy Fieri's frosted tips. I have genuinely never been more blown away by a meal so simple. Thank you Hot Chicken Takeover for bringing hope into an industry that is constantly using gimmicks, manufactured hype and paid twitter followers to build their name.

If one were to go to Morton's or Ruth's Chris, it would be comparable in quality and experience.\\n\\nMy wife and I had 4:30pm reservations on the 2nd of the year. We made our way toward Canada and walked down the path next to the miniature Butchart Gardens that leads into the cellar (aptly named) of the big building. Inside, darkness enveloped us as we approached the hostess for our reservation. The warmness of the cabin-like environment which sheltered us from the cold outside was inviting and welcomed. We put our names in and were told to sit tight for a few minutes while our table was prepared.\\n\\nSoon we were escorted to a table for two in the corner of the restaurant and given menus to peruse. While perusing, a few highlights caught our eye: 1) they have a great set of Canadian beers (including those from Unibroue) available, 2) they have a flight of icewines to taste, and 3) they have a list of wines that they serve by the glass via Coravin. They take their beer and wine very seriously, and served out of Reidel glasses (which is what we experienced as standard when wine tasting in the Niagara region). Very exciting!\\n\\nSoon our server, Veronica, introduced herself to us and told us she was from Ontario.  She was very friendly throughout the meal and answered our questions about how folks from each Epcot country are recruited to come and work at Disney World. She also revealed the secret off-menu poutine option which is the most \\"authentic\\" version that they serve. Here is what we ordered:\\n\\nCheddar cheese soup - Nice and hot. Great tasting and wonderful texture.\\n\\nFrench onion poutine - Delicious. Toasty with great savory gravy, tasty cheese curds, and excellently fried fries.\\n\\nFilet mignon medium rare - A fantastic steak! Perfectly cooked, super tender, very flavorful, and supplemented with wonderful side elements. Amazing!\\n\\nIce wine flight - Not big pours for $27, but a good sampling of three pretty different icewines.

Another room had the door lock fail and they had to remove the door in the middle of the night. After the 1st week we were there, the lock on the guest laundry was removed and never replaced. One of the elevators was broken the entire time we were there - no repairmen were ever seen. The gym is immediately adjacent to the indoor pool so it is hot and humid. Our sheets had holes in them. And, lastly, there were mice in the restaurant.   \\n\\nSo basically, there are a LOT of problems with this hotel. But the location is excellent, so there is that."},{"name":"Fusion Bistro","address":"180 Everett Ave","city":"Chelsea","stars":"4","text":"Very comfortable nice area to eat at!

The interior is full or stone arches and wooden chandeliers casting a soft glow on the patrons below. Cool atmosphere for sure.\\nTo start, our waitress brought us a basket of bread, each loaf a symbol for one of Canada's provinces. I can't recall all of them, but I can't forget the pretzel sticks. This tasty treat is worth the trip alone and to think that they give it to you pro bono!\\nIn fact, when the server returned with our drinks and saw the pretzel bread was already devoured, she came back with 3 more for the table.\\nBless her for that. \\nBless her.\\nWe ordered a few appetizers--The charcuterie and the house poutine.\\nI say house poutine as it's not the type you'd expect north of the border eh, but more Le Cellier's take on the traditional treat. \\nNo cheese curds, aged white cheddar shavings. \\nNo brown gravy, but a red wine reduction. \\nI was eating with two people who grew up in Ontario so they would be the experts on whether or not the dish was blasphemous.\\nIt was not.\\nThe charcuterie was also quite nice. Some thinly sliced meats and cheeses, as well as some duck confit which I had never tried before...really enjoyed it.\\nWhen the entrees came out, that's when it got real. \\nThat was game on. \\nDense filets ladled with a flavorful white truffle butter sauce, cooked to perfection atop a bed of mushroom risotto. \\nOnly in America (read: Canada)! \\nThe steak was divine. I swear if it were socially acceptable I woulda Big League Chew'd the whole thing...cramming the juicy cut into my mouth as one bite then just letting my molars ride it out. \\nFunny, thinking about it--the filet was so tender, one could've actually done that with no problem and no lock jaw.\\nAll in all, I would love to go back and try a few other items.

I quickly looked at their dim-sum menu, which has two sides, one in pure Chinese, and the other side in English (smart) and ending up ordering a plate of pan-fried rice noodles with beef and Yang Chow fried rice, the manager then asked for my number, and he said I could pay later when I get the food.\\n\\nI walked a bit of the mall, instead of wasting my time windling away in the waiting area, and in about 25 minutes they called me saying my order was ready. This is called take-out service, it is... warning.... not cheap, but hey, this isn't a congee-noodle type joint, this is a high end Chinese seafood restaurant. My two items came to just under $40, yeah... you get less surprised with cost when your not forking it out! They had two sets of chopsticks packed with chili sauce and some napkins and plastic spoons. They had me set to go, and I got back to my office fast with the food hot.\\n\\nThe food was real good, no cheaping out on the ingredients, the Yang Chow fried rice had big butterflied prawns sticking out like flowers, the egg was nicely laced through the entire dish, and the pieces of pork where chopped in nicely diced, the big tin takeout was packed, and for $18 it better be! As for the rice noodle and beef, it was cooked to perfection, the beef pieces were big, but not monstrous, and they were not chewy where I was harshly working my molars. I will say it first, this take-out wasn't cheap, but they didn't skimp out on the food quality at all.\\n\\nThis place is new, and really needed around this Oakridge area, you can see the flocks of Chinese people here from the lineups while I was there. I can tell this restaurant has some deep pockets, as they are part of a bigger chain as their business card and other advertisements and awards in the glass display upfront suggest. I can't wait to come in here and eat and see, with some time gone by, if the quality slips, or they keep it excellent, but for now, if you got some money to really burn for some damn good Chinese food.... come in here, and make sure you have a reservation, it's new, remember that!"},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Only wish it was the old Mikes.

We ordered the Texas Red Fish and it was HORRIBLE, it was dry and hard, the rice that came with it had no taste and the vegetables were oddly placed, did not go with the dish at all and tasted like they were straight from a can. I know we should of have expected it but I thought given the higher price of the dish it might be better quality. Complete waste of money, the entire dish was inedible. We also ordered the Ahi Tuna Salad, it was edible but not worth the price we paid for it. The queso was pretty good but also over-priced. There is no way this place doesn't know their food sucks, it almost feels as if they are so busy they don't want to serve food they know people will still come for the alcohol and the view.

In short, top quality ingredients, well prepared, with unexpected but surprisingly apt new flavor notes, along with sophisticated presentation. \\n\\nThen late night Lambert's turns into a full blown nightclub 6 nights a week, with DJs or live music upstairs in the second floor bar, and that action takes the place over until closing. If that's your thing, you'll probably love it. Seems to be very popular. If not, I recommended an early dinner at Lambert's, because the whole place gets very loud once the music starts. Check their website for the music schedule. \\n\\nMy favorite way to introduce people to Lambert's is their Sunday Brunch, 11-2, when they put most of their signature items out on an all you can eat buffet, so you can taste a little of everything on the menu. Then lots of great brunchy items are added, like cheddar and roasted poblano grits, and spicy deviled eggs with caviar. Finally they take custom orders for things like Hanger Steak Benedict or Brioche French Toast. Wash it down with a Mimosa made with fresh OJ and champagne, or a Poloma with fresh grapefruit juice and El Jimador. But leave room, if you have the willpower, for the dessert table, with sweet treats like Valhrona Chocolate cake and lemon cream pie. \\n\\nMy, my, my, it is oh so good. At $25 ($12.50 for kiddos) it's double the cost of more \\"down home\\" Sunday brunches like the one Threadgill's offers, but for a more upscale, elegant experience, and considering the outstanding quality of the food, I find Lambert's to be a great value for the money."},{"name":"The OASIS on Lake Travis","address":"6550 Comanche Trl","city":"Austin","stars":"2.5","text":"Well, I've had nothing but a good time there.

This is a serious bbq joint located next to a mini market in the parking lot. I was dying for some bbq right when I first moved in so i jumped on Yelp and typed in bbq and guess who popped up first...yup...RayRay! Little did I know that the first bite was all I needed to be eternally greatful to true bbq like RayRays. I showed the first time on a Sunday not knowing that they were only open Sat & Sun's, nor knowing that only only sundays did that have grassfed brisket. It's also worth noting that although this is a truck, there is always a line. I dont like lines except for when Ive never been somewhere before; it gives me time to hear what the others are ordering, and hopefully, you can weed out the regulars and see what they order. I'm very perceptive by nature so I tend to find the locals fairly quickly and I order exactly what they do. The first time I got a lb of the grassfed brisket (clearly the biggest seller) & a rack of ribs, I noticed a case of berch beer with only 1 left so I ordered 2 (I heard they had more in the truck). It truely does pay to be perceptive! Dam that brisket...that juicy brisket...Ive been signing about it to everyone who's come to visit and I've forced them to try it; everyone agrees with me to! It has to be the best brisket I have ever had. I hate brisket too...but this...its so good, putting it into words would only down play the flavors. Nothing gives this meat justice except going to try it for yourself. \\n\\nNow I'll admit, I'm a dry rub girl. My first ribs were in Memphis with my grampa at Rendezvous. Nothing I have ever had has ever beaten that meal, ever, nor do I have any hope that I will find anything that can even match it let alone beat it! But Ray Rays..oh my dear Ray Ray...you do come close. It's Carolina bbq and had a vinegar base which I usualy hate, but these guys do it right. They do ribs right, even for a dry rub girl. \\n\\nThey also do sandwiches and have pulled pork and some sides that are worth noting. The mac and cheese is good, the peanut butter cobbler was 'ick', and the beans were ok. The birch beer is worth buying in bulk."},{"name":"Moxie's Grill & Bar","address":"180 W Georgia St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"2.5","text":"I guess the food is alright overall. It was nothing special. The waitress told me that my Salmon and Prawn pasta would be so good with their Lobster Rose sauce. Well I got that and it was just okay. It costed 17 dollars and realistically I would have probably paid 10 or 12 maximum. The prawns themselves were not that big and was fairly inadequate. The salmon was okay other than being dry. I ordered dessert like a high roller. It was the tasty trio or something. The sticky toffee pudding was meh. The chocolate biscotti was ridiculously hard, but I guess that's how it should have been maybe. The white chocolate brownie tasted like whatever. The thing costed 9 dollars.\\n\\nThe service was p weaksauce. We had to basically do jumping jacks to get their attention and even that didn't work.

My boyfriend and I were in different moods as far as what we wanted to eat went, so he opted to order a beef tenderloin entree, while I ordered 3 small plates. Our happy hour wines arrived quickly, followed by his miso soup.  My seaweed salad arrived shortly thereafter the soup.  About 5-10 minutes later, both the oysters that I had ordered, as well as my grilled lobster arrived.  I went ahead and ate the oysters, but planned to wait to eat the lobster when the beef tenderloin arrived.  Our server did mention at least twice that he was aware that the tenderloin should have already arrived, but that he had checked on the order and it should be out shortly.  Unfortunately, it did take a good 30 minutes longer than expected to arrive.  HOWEVER, when it did arrive, the manager (Steve) brought it out himself, sincerely apologized and noted that the reason for the delay was that he was not happy with the temperature upon first cooking, so he had the kitchen remake it so that it would be a perfect medium rare.  This customer service was fantastic.  In addition to his apology, he insisted upon taking the tenderloin item off of our bill, and also gave us a complementary lobster ceviche (yum!!), which we would not have expected or demanded.  They went above and beyond to make sure that our experience was perfect, and that the food served was above expectations.  We have always enjoyed the food at Seito, but wanted to make sure to point out that the customer service is something you cannot find at many restaurants these days.  Kudos to the restaurant management - we greatly appreciated all you did for us.  Cannot wait for our next visit.

And the choice is REALLY limited.\\n\\nNow, with bad food and a bad first impression from the reservation service, you would expect service to raise the bar a bit? Welp, another miss. The man that appears to be the manager is really rude and cold (again, other reviewers talk about this), as were other waiters. Only one waitress tried to keep smiling even though everybody at our table was obviously not impressed by the dining experience...\\n\\nAll in all, do not waste your money here. If you want \\"cheap\\" AYCE, try other places downtown, same food provider, cheaper price, no rude faces."},{"name":"Jersey Mike's Subs","address":"4105 SW 117th Ave, Ste A","city":"Beaverton","stars":"3.5","text":"It was fine.

It never ceases to amaze me how many places that should serve good fries just butcher them. Limp, greasy and Luke warm from the warming tray is never a good combination. Skip the fries. \\n\\nThe crowd was light and the service was attentive which was nice considering I was drinking a diet coke and the tip didn't increase with each refill. \\n\\nIf they could make good fries I'd bump the star rating.

The cream was fluffy and the other she'll was crispy and didn't feel like the cream had made it soggy. There are a ton of other treats as well but you come here for the cannolis. The service is good and very efficient so you are in and out within 10 minutes including waiting in line. Take the cannoli home or enjoy it nearby at the park or even just outside the shop.

Not a huge fan of cannolis because of how heavy they are, but it was a good experience. I liked it more than I thought I would.

I didn't notice it at all. I did come in early, but I was just one diner and felt free to enjoy my meal at leisure. No one else seemed hurried either, and the other wait staff seemed very friendly.\\n\\nFood: Delish! I had a special and contrary to a few reviews, felt it was reasonably priced for a huge, huge portion of seafood, lobster included. The seafood was super fresh, and I particularly loved the mussels and shrimp. It's true the oil that accompanies the bread before your meal is incredible. It has some cheese, spices, tomatoes, and olives in it and it was so yummy. I wished the bread was more crusty, but minor details. The only disappointment was the sangria. I just didn't care for it, there was a weird and potent taste to it that was unlike other sangria dive had in the past. Again, easily avoidable.\\n\\nI'm surprised so many people have had poor experiences here.

Perhaps unappreciated outside of NYC, some excellent barbecue options have appeared in recent years - offerings my Dallas colleague confirms can compete with Texas options (shocker!). My favorite choices for BBQ in NYC are the brisket and brontosaurus rib (short rib) at Mighty Quinn's and the burnt ends and pork belly at John Brown Smokehouse.  So I am basing my review off a comparison to NYC options (and prices).\\n\\nThe positives - appetizers were nothing short of excellent - we enjoyed the hummus (delicious grilled vegetables mixed in) with flatbread, fried oysters over Texas toast with a tasty cucumber dip and a pleasant version of just-right-spice TexMex queso.  The drinks selection was also strong.  My brother's girlfriend works in wine distribution and she was able to attest to the quality of the wine list, plus a good beer selection and fresh cocktail ingredients rounded out all options.  Finally, the ambience and decor are delightful.\\n\\nThe negatives - main courses are horrendously overpriced for what they are.  Don't forget, I live and eat out in Manhattan.  I don't typically even blink at a $30 main course.  The issue at Lamberts is the quantity and the quality for the price.  The $19 brisket main has only 5 thin slices of meat, the $19 pork ribs number only 3 and the $42 signature short rib isn't anything to write home about.  I can purchase the same or better(!) quality meat in comparable quantities at Mighty Quinn's in Manhattan for $8.50 (single serving brisket), $8 (single serving spare ribs) and $23 (brontosaurus rib) respectively.  This is shocking to me!\\n\\nI'd recommend coming here for drinks and apps, but don't bother to stay for the barbecue.  I haven't been able to visit the other options in Austin but there must be several that are better than this.

It wasn't until I showed the confirmation email that I got the charges removed.\\n\\nOne of the elevators were out - I mean, I guess there's no real good time to fix it but holy moly, 3 days of sawing and drilling midday was fun. Luckily we were out for the most part but when we came back to take a break or woke up in the morning they were just working on the elevator. This also means that during check-in and check-out elevators were taking 5-10 minutes to get called.\\n\\nFor a new hotel it didn't feel that new. Wouldn't be surprised if they used some old salvaged stuff from other hotels. Simple things like wallpaper that was already peeling, cabling that was tucked behind carpet, light switches that were screwed on shoddy. Not a huge deal but I expected it to be a bit more pristine.\\n\\nThe overall vibe and customer service is great. Everyone was friendly and overall the hotel was clean. The restaurants will come in a different review, but were average at best and was hoping for a more high end experience.\\n\\nThe location is prime if you are taking a boat tour, or are walking to downtown or taking rides into downtown.

Nothing.\\nOh, and when they split the bill 4 ways, they tried to be sneaky and want to charge us an item twice. Luckily people in my group caught it.

First of all the decor is over-the-top, yes we get it there is a restaurant right next to a laundromat on Ponce De Leon very cool neon signs, y'all. The protein plating are sloppy, which kind of reminded me of cafeteria food from high school, my mother did not enjoy the very low lighting visibility of the decors and Lighting for the purpose of making this restaurant look cool. We skipped the appetizers and went straight for the entrees because the appetizers were not appetizing-purely for the fact that you can get these appetizers at ANY fine dining restaurant in the city. There was also a confusion- what my mother asked me is this an American style restaurant or French or Hispanic or Italian or Asian ? And she also asked me if I just took her to a hipster bar because of all the other customers who all seem to be from college fraternities. The duck confit was greasy and unappetizing. And why in the world would anybody put fennel in shrimp and grits which is a southern staple that nobody should mess up. Service was pretty slow, but nothing to really rag on because it was a Saturday night. But if you enjoy loud cracks suddenly that sounds like two bowling balls cracking  together as hard as they can (and what sounded like cheering from Frat Boys)- which my mother did not enjoy.  If you don't care about Subpar cuisine and a culturally confused menu, then this is the spot for you. The only good thing from our dining experience indoors was the beers, they did have a good beer selection so I'll give them that one star. Unfortunately as we walk our parked car in the side street,  my mother and I caught a massive whiff of some smelly marijuana from the back of the restaurant. We saw some chefs standing around so that must be where the smell was coming from. Maybe that's why the food was so subpar and Confused, when your Chef's and line cooks are all smoking weed and stoned as hell on the line as they're putting out food for customers. My mother hated this place. I'm still confused as to whether if this place is a bowling alley or a restaurant or a hipster bar or just a simple Brewery. But the cultural confusion with the cuisine and having to pay to park with no validation is enough to make us not come back and we will make sure to tell our friends and family this crazy adventure my mother and I decided to go on. \\n\\nPS- if you are a frat boy this is your spot the beer is pretty good.

In fact, this was probably the first time I had a Cannoli that I thoroughly enjoyed without feeling its sickly sweetness after just one bite. I loved the crunch of the almonds, I loved that the shell wasn't as thick and overpowering as the one at Mike's, and the ricotta was the perfect level of creaminess. In contrast, the vanilla custard/pistachio cannoli was two sweet for me, and I didn't feel that the pistachios complemented the rest of the flavors of the cannoli. The pistachios were big and filled your entire mouth so that none of the other flavors with the chocolate shell and the custard meshed together. \\n\\nAlso, I went to both Modern and Mike's at 8am on a Saturday morning, when there were not any of the staggering lines that I've heard accumulate later in the day and I was the only customer there. At Modern, I was greeted by a nice cashier who gave me a homey feel and was more than gracious to have me standing there trying to figure which pairings of flavors I wanted for my two cannoli's.

That classy move on the part of the manager (kudos to her), keeps this place on the upper end of the star scale for me, and they apparently put us with one of their better servers who understood why we were moved and took good care of us.\\n\\nOur appetizers were wonderful (I highly recommend the cheddar cheese soup), the steak was very good (although not the absolute best I've ever had), and the poutine was certainly not a traditional recipe, but it was a very good, upscale version, made with, I believe wine and cheddar cheese. \\n\\nIn addition to the champagne, I also had the Canadian Beer Flight, which was a sampling of three Canadian beers.  I enjoy a good beer, and love sampling different types, and I know I haven't tried everything, but in all my years and extensive time spent in Canada, I personally have never tasted this brand before (I believe it was from Unibroue, and known as La Fin Du Monde [aka The End of the World]).  Personally I am not a big fan of it . . . I drank the first two samplings, one of which I believe was supposed to have been an \\"apple\\" beer.  The third beer -- a dark beer -- in my opinion was undrinkable.  I might try one of these the next time I am up north, but as of now, I am not a fan.\\n\\nThe dessert was very tasty, as we had the maple creme brulee and, as if I didn't have enough alcohol, I enjoyed a warm Irish coffee with my dessert.\\n\\nSure there are components of our dining experience that weren't the best, but the atmosphere is nice and warm, MOST of the service was pleasant and the food, for the most part was very enjoyable.

And everytime after I leave I wonder why I came back.  I will admit the patio is very inviting when you are walking down the street on a sunny day and thirsty for beer.  However, the beer is not very good.  The cloudiness of the unfiltered style beer can be unsetteling, but the flavor of the beer is not good.  The two IPAs taste too similar, and the golden was just plain boring.  The food consists of a polish sausage on a bun or a burger, veggi versons are available also.  But don't bother with these, just ask for the free cup of goldfish crackers from the bar.  \\n\\nThe worst part about this place is the  agonizingly slow moving line to order from.  There was only one bartender during happy hour!!  He was taking each individual beer order and then going and filling that order one at a time!!  The line was out the door just to get a beer.  It felt like a damn beer fest:  Get your beer and then get back in line for the next one because you will have ample time to finish your beer before you get up to order another.  \\nThe only redemable thing about this place is again the patio.  It is dog friendly and it's fun to sit out and watch the people go by.  But then you realize that you have to drink this sub-par beer and are eating goldfish crackers!!

Speaking of flavour, our fries tasted kind of off- like the deep fryer could use a change of oil. \\n\\nMy conclusion? This is still an okay place to cozy up for lunch, and the customer service is lovely enough to make me come back. But I wouldn't set Prestons aside for any great foodie expectations.

I usually only eat the regular ones, but many other varieties they carry are good, but the true test is how their regular flavor one is, and I like that they do not overly sweeten them where you can still taste the Ricotta cheese which is the key ingredient for the Cannolo filling. A lot of places use synthetic filling or the filling may not be fresh. Everything is super fresh here and due to the high turn-over, you are very likely to have them that were made very close to the time of your purchase as they roll out the batches very frequently throughout the day especially during peak times.\\n\\nThis place offers many flavors of Cannoli and surprisingly maintains quality and unmatched consistency which is usually rare considering the volume of foot traffic and quantity of flavor options. This is really as good as it gets and if there's a line, the staff plunges very quickly through the line, usually there is no more than a 5-10 minute wait at most.\\n\\nCannoli does not tend to maintain freshness long, at most into the next day, so if you want to really enjoy how they are supposed to be made, you have to try this place!"},{"name":"Disney Springs","address":"1486 Buena Vista Dr","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"I absolutely love this place.

I would not recommend this restaurant for a large party. We went with 30 people and the service was horrible. We had this reservation booked for weeks however they were clearly not prepared. It took almost an hour to get a round of drinks. When we inquired they said that they only had one bartender for the whole restaurant and that he was backed up. By that time our entrees were coming out of the kitchen, most people had not even received their drinks. As the party coordinator, this is really embarrassing. When we were finished, it took them almost 45 minutes to clear our plates. We didn't have a specific server so it was just anyone that had time to clear the plates. Nobody ordered dessert or coffee because we all wanted to leave after waiting so long. I think it's sad for that restaurant because they could have got at least another $500 out of us had we all dessert. I had to ask a server where things were like 5 times throughout the dinner, when I had called and come in personally to make sure the plans for the dinner were clear. Very poorly organized, and a big disappointment."},{"name":"Disney Springs","address":"1486 Buena Vista Dr","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"If you're looking to stroll around the Disney property and not pay to park, then go to Disney Springs.

I always feel like everyone around me knows about wine and can speak perfect Italian. And this restaurant isn't even that expensive--I think I'd probably die of shame if I ever even came near Joel Rubuchon. \\n\\nBut Vespaio does a good job, I think, of elevating their food a bit while keeping the atmosphere really casual and upbeat. It's lively without being too noisy, dressier than the trailer park across the street without being stuffy. Most older dudes did the khaki/polo thing and I felt fine in a sundress. The service I experienced was attentive and friendly without being overpowering or too color-by-numbers; our server was more interested in hearing our thoughts on the food and emphasizing its strengths than dribbling platitudes about \\"checking if everything's OK!\\" \\n\\nAnd the food had a lot of strengths. Everything I ate seemed perfect in portion, ingredient quality and temperature. The spinach salad was probably one of the best salads I've ever had--really fresh greens, a bizarrely cute little coil of bacon, and candied nuts that balanced out the saltiness without getting too over the top. The only slightly off note was the sticky little pile of gorgonzola on one side of the plate; it may be my fault for being unfamiliar with this incarnation of the cheese, but it felt a little strange to have to sort of spread it onto the greens because it was too viscous to really mix with the rest of the salad. \\n\\nI chose the seafood mixed grill for an entree and was really happy with the choice--turbot (?), a crab cake over arugula, and bacon-wrapped prawns over a polenta that made me weep with joy. Not culinary rocket science, but everything was delicious and well-prepared. Dessert was kind of an afterthought, and maybe we chose wrong in selecting the creme brulee at an Italian restaurant. In any case, the pastry on the fig crostata was pretty dry, and the elements of the plate (the custard, the crostata, a sorbetto) didn't work well together for me. That makes me sound like a Top Chef judge, but it's true. \\n\\nVespaio probably doesn't serve the most exciting kind of food, but it's very well-crafted and good enough that it surprised me. I agree with some of the other reviews on the slightly high prices, but I think that the quality of food is probably worth it. Michael Cera and Jason Schwartzman were eating there, too, so they probably agree."},{"name":"Doc's Motorworks","address":"1123 S Congress Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I only had a margarita, but is was YUMMY!!!

But on a Saturday afternoon in Northwest Austin, they all came together for Joe C.'s ROTDC at Sweet Caroline's Snow Shack.\\n\\nLocated off Anderson Mill and 183, Sweet Caroline's is one of several family-owned trailers located around the city, and thankfully they decided to set up shop in the far flung nether regions of NW Austin. They're on the grass right outside one of those shopping centers that actually has a sign that says \\"Liquor & Guns\\". You know, the type of sign that doesn't do a thing to dispel any awful stereotypes about Texas. \\n\\nBut Sweet Caroline's and the employees are just as sweet as can be. Boasting 50 flavors from old stand-bys such as cherry and bubble gum, to the more exotic such as sweet nectar and dill pickle, there is certainly something for everyone. Add in toppings such as whipped cream and Nerds candy, and it may take you a while to figure out just the right combination. \\n\\nWhen I walked up, Shannon B. was already there with her family. I met her husband, and noticed her son whom I had met at our Yogertz shin dig was dressed as a Ninja Turtle. Having grown up a Ninja Turtle fanatic myself, I was heartened to see they were coming back. (Side note: I discovered a banana and lime snow cone here is called a \\"Ninja Turtle\\". Two references to the Turtles in as many minutes? How crazy is that?)\\n\\nThe woman in the cart told us we could sample anything, so I copied Shannon and sampled the dill pickle (with AND without their \\"sour spray\\"), just for the hell of it. While I liked it without the spray, I totally prefer a flavor more \\"in my comfort zone\\". \\n\\nAfter much thought, I ordered their signature \\"Sweet Caroline\\": Coconut, Strawberry, and Cream. I added Nerds, because I hadn't had Nerds since I was like, 10. We sat in the comfy lawn chairs just a step away, and they will bring your snowball to you once it's ready. We received a special offer of a medium size for the price of a small, and believe me--a medium size is a VERY generous portion.\\n\\nI agree with Errol--I was never much of a snow cone fan, either. I couldn't tell you the last time I had one, but again, it was probably when I was like, 10. But once I started digging into my treat, I realized I might be a fan again. \\n\\nIt was sweet, of course; but the best part was that it was chock full of Nerds. The initial presentation was deceiving. Once I started digging into the flavorful ice, I found more and more of the sweet and sour candies. I loved it. And even though it was kind of cold outside, I was still actually really jazzed about my deliciously cold treat. I can only imagine what it's like to enjoy one when it's scorching hot outside.\\n\\nAs I worked my way through my snow cone, not only did we discuss Yelper restaurant topics, but I realized I could carry on a conversation with a child about Ninja Turtles better than I could have imagined. We discussed such weighty issues as the difference between a \\"katana\\" and a \\"sai\\", why Donatello is our favorite (he's usually the best player in any TMNT arcade game), and I may have lost my cool during a very heated debate about why they shouldn't change the Turtles' catch phrase from \\"Cowabunga\\", to \\"Booyakasha\\". Seriously, it's a real thing. Look it up. DO NOT mess with a classic, I say! \\n\\nAs we wrapped up our time at the cart, two things occurred: 1.) We insisted Keri B. show us her recently purchased panties from Victoria's Secret, along with her cute dress from bebe, and she said that was fine; and 2.) It was decided that since I was the only person in the circle who hadn't been to Barley Swine, Errol would go with me that evening and introduce me to the phenomenon. I was excited. Finally--I could feel like a complete person again.\\n\\nOne disappointment: a Neil Diamond \\"Sweet Caroline\\" sing-a-long was conspicuously absent. But I'll live. \\n\\nShannon remarked (as we ate our snow cones in 60 degree weather): \\"One day, we will all say: 'Remember that time it was the first cold day after summer? And then we had snow cones?'\\" \\n\\nAnd with a hint of nostalgia, I can say: \\"Yes, I'll remember.

I reserved the table a couple of months ago. We were at the middle seating. We walked to our table at exactly the time of our reservation (7:05) When I made the reservation, and even up until yesterday,  no one could tell me what was on the menu. Only that the chef was going to prepare something special for New Year's Eve. I , of course , expected the steaks that they are well known for serving,  but thought maybe as they had tripled the price ( it was in the $600 -700  range for my family of 4)  that maybe they would throw in a lobster or two.  Nope. It was basically the same menu they usually have,  minus the Poutine. They did have a couple of choices- the NY strip, filet with mushrooms, couscous ,and  some kind of fish dish which I don't remember. My husband ordered the filet with mushroom sauce topping and I ordered the NY strip steak- both medium rare. That way we could share. Both were excellent. The flavor of the NY strip steak was amazing. The filet was also very tasty. My husband loved the potatoes that came with the filet. I didn't try them. My potato dish was not as good, There was a small (very) teenie  appetizer consisting of one less than  marble sized tasty flavored tomato\\nthing - looked like a bean  -on a tiny piece of bread per person, which they called bruschetta.  It tasted delicious. But really...they could have given a few of those to each person. The soup was their usual tasty cheese soup. The pretzel bread was yummy.  The dessert- we all had  the usual maple creme brulee -was also very good.  The waitresses seemed in a hurry to get us in and out. They kept trying to clear our plates away before we were done. As it was New Year's Eve I expected a glass of champagne, as they had advertised we would be able to take home a souvenir champagne glass. Nope again. I was told by our waitress that the actual champagne was for the people at the 3rd late dinner seating. I assume they probably paid even more for that privilege. As we were leaving they handed us a small shopping bag with 4 ( cheap looking) empty champagne glasses wrapped in tissue paper. They were not souvenir glasses as there was nothing written or pictured on them. (These were later confiscated from us at the entrance to Magic Kingdom as we could not bring glass in). They took our name and phone # and said to pick them up at guest services on the way out. Not a chance as thousands and thousands of people were leaving at the same time after the fireworks. Definitely not worth retrieving them. All in all it was a nice meal. I certainly would not do it on New Year's Eve again.

We ended up making a list to keep track of all of our choices, haha, and when our server came around, she ended up recommending a bunch of stuff that wasn't on our list! After all that work, lol. So we just surrendered and let her pick out 8 of her favourite dishes for us. It was awesome, because we never knew what was coming next (the dishes typically came out one at a time). And each one was more delicious than the last. The last dish was a rice bowl served super hot in a stone dish, mixed with cheese and chipotle curry. It was the crown jewel of the meal!

I ordered the western omelette with home fries along with a side of biscuit & gravy (sausage). My better half ordered a combo, 2 eggs, home fries, sausage and bacon. I had the waitress bring out the biscuit & gravy 1st so we could share it. It looked good at 1st but unfortunately it was like tasteless wall paper paste mixed with different chunks of left over sausages. (Scraps) \\nNow my omelette was so, so. (kinda greasy) home fries done the southern way....fried, dry & hard. Doesn't anyone know how to do them up on a flat top grill. \\nNow for her combo deal. She told me the eggs were ok and so was the bacon but the sausage and home fries, simply put, horrible. When the waitress came by she told her she couldn't eat the home fries because they were to hard and if it was possible to get some not so well done. The waitress immediately brought her some but insisted on taking the other home fries back.

Indeed, it was unlikely for us to find it on our own, seeing that was almost the only business on the block.\\n\\nWalking in, we found the host/hostess desk unmanned and when we peered down the narrow entrance hall, we saw staff running about with body language that suggested you interrupt them at your peril.  We were also engulfed in a sea of noise; the first floor dining room is rather small, maybe 8 tables seating 2 - 4, but cacophonous.  A few staff marched brusquely to the host desk a few times but paid us no mind.  I dared to interrupt one to query that perhaps reservations might be needed but before I finished the thought, I was politely but firmly told we'll be seated shortly.  Then we were.  Thereafter, the wait staff  were generally quick and competent.\\n\\nTucked into a corner table, we were in close quarters to a couple at the next table; luckily they had good humor and were quite friendly.  The dining room was simple, Italian-styled decor but somewhat bland, with terracotta and marble tiling on walls, and wooden tables.  I loved the painted glass top on each table; ours had layers of buildings but others that we examined as we were leaving were just as beautiful.  Food here is mostly served on modern, white plateware, which surprised me; brightly painted ceramics would have been a better fit with the place, but no matter.\\n\\nThe host, striding around the room with barely contained energy, did a bit of everything and boisterously announced the specials to us (although our neighbors already tipped us off).  We opted for a bottle of white wine and decided to share two specials, the antipasti appetizer and lobster fra diavolo.  Warm bread that was otherwise unremarkable was improved by a very tasty, seasoned olive oil dip.\\n\\nThe antipasti appetizer arrived on a wooden paddle, toasted flatbread and cured meats topped with a mountain of arugula greens, crumbled cheese, sliced grape tomatoes, and mushrooms, accompanied by a small glass of marinated artichokes and olives.  It was a gigantic portion.  Everything in this dish was good.\\n\\nAfter clearing away the appetizer, our host cheerfully tied our bibs on, then served the lobster fra diavolo in a huge square plate, mounds of brightly sauced linguini tossed with mussels, clams, calamari, and half a lobster.  I found the pasta overdone for my taste, flavor decent but not very interesting.  The seafood was mostly fine, although again, not extraordinary.  What they don't lack are huge portions (although the specials are quite expensive relative to the regular menu items).  We were quite full and skipped dessert.\\n\\nThe reviews for Massimino's are all over the place, and based on my experience, I can see why.  This is not the place for careful, considerate service.  Probably more like visiting a chaotic relative's house for the holiday's where you need to speak your mind and speak it firmly to get attention.  Keep a light mood and I think you'll find the service just fine.  I found our host entertaining, and he checked in on us often.  We didn't experience any reservation fiascos because we didn't have reservations, but I don't think you should come here if you're rushed for time.  The food is decent but by no means incredible; generally lacks depth, not much finesse.  I liked Massimino's because it ended up being a fun experience, with the whole being more than just the sum of the individual average parts."},{"name":"Clover Food Lab","address":"100 Burlington Mall Rd","city":"Burlington","stars":"4.5","text":"Always tasty, friendly and reliable to make you and your tummy happy.\\nMy advice is if your a first timer go for the \\"falafal\\" or chickpea platter.\\nI tried many other platters, but always come back to the original."},{"name":"Sala and Betty","address":"5201 Airport Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"This place has grown on me.

Next, had a hard time deciding b/c all the desserts sounded yummy - a good sign that desserts are important to Hudson Grille. (Birthday Girl decided on the carrot cake.) Next, amazed by the size of the dessert - huge piece for just $5.95 ... we couldn't finish between the three of us. (All the desserts are $5.95.) Also, beautiful presentation with the swirls & the powdery stuff & the fresh whipped cream with the mint leaf - remember, Hudson Grille is a sports bar not a fine dining establishment.

So we put our names in and waited 40 minutes for a table, and decided to eat off the lunch menu because we were already there.  I had a burger with skimp toppings, seriously could get a nicer burger from any fast food joint. The view of the lake was nice. This place is just ok, but what really pissed me off was how the management seemed completely disinterested with our situation.

It begins with the finest neighborhood pub in the land, extends into a hefty handful of nitty gritty-to-nice/casual eateries, and then spills into much shopping, ending in industrial and car-centric sorts of businesses.\\n\\nAnd there is no lack of Tex-Mex encasing each of the above components. If you are really in the know, you would probably head to one of the more traditional Mexican eateries for some hefty grub. Alas, El Mercado is fully-serviced, a smidgen cleaner than the run-of-the-mill taco shacks, and it is an Austin longstay.\\n\\nThat doesn't mean it provides the best of Texican fare. On the contrary, it is actually quite disappointing. The accompaniments to your combinations of enchiladas, tacos, and the like are pretty mediocre. On this, the dishes, themselves, are often lacking in any sort of flavor complexity. The portions are small, to boot. Small, in comparison to some of the other bad boys in town.\\n\\nAnyway, there is not much I can elaborate on, aside from the fact that this joint cranks out offerings that are simple, humble, and cheap."},{"name":"Hot Chicken Takeover","address":"59 Spruce St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"I LOVE Hot Chicken Takeover!

I'm not a huge fan of coleslaw, but I love Hot Chicken Takeover's slaw. I think it's paired perfectly with the spicy chicken. As for the mac 'n cheese, it's an added bonus to the meal. To top off what's in the box, you have the slices of white bread. Hot Chicken Takeover is one of the only restaurants in the North Market to include a drink with your meal. What goes best with fried chicken? Sweet tea! So good! Oh, don't forget the housemade ranch. \\n\\nDo not let the long line discourage you.

We've had a couple of really weird and ridiculous incidents there (not being able to order over the phone to come and pick it up, but the girl on the phone said if we call again in 20 minutes we can order over the phone, after asking why we have to wait 20 mins. to order over the phone, she put us on hold for 5 minutes befor she just hung up on us without giving us an answer) but last night just really topped everything. Nothing on their menu really sparks my interest in the first place, but i really like the burger they offer. So i had my heart set on the burger and after i couldn't find it on the menu i asked the waiter if they don't offer it anymore and he told us it's only on the bar menu. So i asked if he could order it from the bar for me and he said (and those were really his words) \\"Lamberts doesn't allow bar food on normal dining tables, but if you sit right here (- he pointed to a tiny little coffee table right next to our table) you can order it.\\" He was dead serious. Thats not only ridiculous but also just simply stupid. I did not want to make a big scene so i did not ask for the manager, even though i would have loved to throw my disappointment in the whole restaurant right in his face. \\nSo i went with the ribs, and the only reason this review gets 2 stars because the ribs were served promptly. They were ok, although i had better ribs in my life, even at more inexpensive restaurants. To sum it all up, Lamberts is so NOT worth spending your time on special nights like NYE, because chances are like 80% that you will leave only half way satisfied because they are making such a fuss about on which table you're allowed to eat a freaking burger.\\nMe and my boyfriend will avoid Lamberts from now on cause this experience was just too damn ridiculous for the price they charge. \\n\\nJust offer a full-price option for the burger on your regular menu and everything would be cool."},{"name":"The OASIS on Lake Travis","address":"6550 Comanche Trl","city":"Austin","stars":"2.5","text":"I love the location of the Oasis but the food is just blah.

I stopped at the Cambridge location one day after work (horrible parking) and tried the only thing they had left by the piece: Pecan Chocolate Bourbon pie.  It was EXCELLENT and right up there in scrumptiousness with some of the best flourless chocolate cakes I have had.  Intrigued, I repeated my after-work visit a few days later and went for a more traditional Strawberry and Rhubarb pie.  FINGER-LICKING GOOD.  Nice and tart with a flaky golden crust.  Now I was a fan.  I drove to the Somerville location, so that I could properly park and indulge in a tasting spree at a leisured pace without worrying of being towed or ticketed.  I started with the Mud Pie.  I was amazing, chewy and strong flavored.  My mistake was that I ate all of it, rather than stopping half way through, when my stomach said \\"enough\\".  This is a bomb of a pie and even a single piece can put you out of commission for a while, so enjoy in moderation!

Definitely better than other joints known for slices like Sizzle Pie and SFNY or even EFNY.

Tonight changed all of that and I am not happy.  \\n\\nTonight was my 40th birthday party and it should have been an evening of celebration.  Instead, it was a chaotic, unorganized, stressful mess.  My friend reserved the upstairs (which is a gorgeous space) of the restaurant a month ago.  Earlier this week and again the day of the party, she called to confirm that we had 35-40 people attending.  No problem, she was told.  We arrived to find that there was one server assigned to our area.  ONE.  For 40 people.  She also had someone 'new' to help her bring waters and bread.  It turns out that our server, Vicki, was also acting as the bartender.  They both tried their best, but with so many people, they could not keep up.  Some people felt she was rude.  When we attempted to order drinks, half the people were told that there was a VERY limited bar.  The other half seemed able to order drinks just fine.  They couldn't make half the basic drinks we asked for because they didn't have the ingredients.  It took a long time for the drinks to arrive, since the server was also acting as bartender.  I did appreciate the comp pomegranate margarita for my birthday.  \\n\\nA few friends went downstairs to complain to the owner/manager.  The manager stated that we had booked the room for 15.  However, when we reserved, he told us he could accomodate up to 40 and to confirm the number attending early in the week, which we did.  When we arrived, the room WAS set up to seat 40 people, so it wasn't a surprise to them like they made it sound to my guests.  In the conversation downstairs, he also stated that parties of this size are usually served buffet style.  This was not told to us when the reservation was made. I feel that if he could not accomodate us, he should not have accepted the reservation.  Most of us feel he was too cheap to hire more staff to come in and work.  Shortly after that conversation, we saw him drive off.  He should have put on an apron and helped serve or pour drinks! \\n\\nAfter two hours, several of my friends started leaving because they still hadn't received their dinners.  I was so embarrassed and it ruined my party.  We were also told that there weren't enough dishes and that they had to wash some more.  \\n\\nThank goodness I had lovely people at my party or it would have been totally ruined.  When the food finally came, it was excellent, as usual.  However, I would never, ever recommend Arabian Breeze for a party.

I told her that wouldn't be a problem since we were 15mins early we would happily wait - that we would just cozy up to the bar or go listen to the music upstairs, we weren't in a hurry.  She said no.  I noticed that there were three dropped checks so i would happily wait for any of those other tables and that she could get us at the bar when they were ready.  \\nShe said no, the only table i would get would be the one she offered. \\nWhen i asked why, she said the other tables were reserved.  I pointed out to her that i did reserve a table and I would prefer a table that wasn't in the kitchen, and that she could get me when they were open, and that we would be at the bar upstairs.\\nOnce upstairs we saw a completely open table and asked the waitress if we could sit there and she happily seated us - no problem at all...that was until the hostess came upstairs and saw us.  She kicked us.  She said that our table was the one near the kitchen, take it our leave it.\\nWe got the manager.\\nHe was stunned.  At this point there were multiple open tables with no more reservations on the books.  The manager tried to make right what the hostess had screwed up, but by that time our experience had been soured.\\n\\nIF the BBQ had been the best in ATX, then I might have been able to get past the wasted hour of my life arguing with a horrible hostess, but it is not.

It is unlikely that it was locally sourced as it had a crisper taste than Columbus city water so I am guessing that the owner boiled it first then flash froze it and let it re-melt (this is only done by top water connosieurs to give the water an extra layer of flavor) and was the best I've ever had.

Their volcano roll, not anywhere near as good as what I've had, and the volcano is one of my all time favorites, . Their pad Thai however was very good, and their fried bananas were amazing.  I wouldn't recommend their sushi or maki. If you want REAL sushi, try maki sushi on main st in Peabody.

There were three of four booths open but with reserved signs on them.  \\n\\nI asked the hostess if it was possible, since we had our friend in town, to either sit at one of the tables that was reserved (they were reserved for dinner, not HH) or sit at one of the dining tables (the dining area was 80% empty) and enjoy the HH menu.  She looked at me disgusted and without any real desire to help, said a robotic \\"the bar is first-come first-serve, and you can always stand up\\".  I explained that we'd be ordering lots of food and drink, but she didn't seem to care.\\n\\nI get that you have to put policies in place, but use some common sense and at least be kind...that's part of your job description.

We decided to meet up at citywalk on a Saturday night around 630 pm. Last time we were here we didn't have the best experience and the citywalk manager contacted me and went above and beyond what I ever imagined. I was promised a free reservation so when I went up to guest services I was a little nervous about what they were going to tell me about the newest restaurant at Citywalk. To my surprised they were able to get us a table right away by calling the restaurant. Awesome service. We walked in where you are checked in and then asked to wait for a greeter to walk you to the table. The outside looks massive so we were surprised at how little tables were in the inside area (which is why there's always a long wait). As soon as you come in the have the service for he milkshake and ice cream that you can get in if that is what you are looking for. When seated you walk by a huge window where you see them making all the desserts. Made me excited to try a shake. I could probably stand there all day and just enjoy the sights. \\n\\nOnce seated we were given our menus (huge in size for some reason) and drink orders were taken. My gf ordered the peach mix drink which sounded good. She did not like it as it tasted like straight liquor. There is plenty to order as far as food. I loved the mix of different options they offered. A lot of cool items made with chocolate. I wanted to try the chocolate wings but was not feeling too adventurous. We decided on ordering the chocolate bread with the almond butter for the table. It was delicious. I kinda wished the bread was free and offered by the restaurant but for $2.95 I can't complain too much. It almost tasted like a chocolate muffin. As far as food my gf and I ordered the Tour de France. It was a burger with a fried egg, avocado, and crispy onion rights. It was excellent. Probably one of the better burgers I've had at citywalk. My gf thought the same thing. It is offered with fries and kettle chips ( highly recommend the fries). Everyone in our party seemed to really enjoy their food. Only complaint was that it seemed to be a little pricey but exactly what you expect at a tourist location. Our friend got the filet mignon medallions and it was $50.00 ( super pricey considering you can go to Charley's steakhouse 10 minutes away and find he steak for $40 dollars). Everyone did seem satisfied with their food. \\n\\nThe main even was the dessert. They have about 3 pages of dessert and anything you can possibly choose from. You really feel like you are in the work of Willy wonka. All that was missing was the umpa loompas coming out to serve our food. We ordered the peanut butter milkshake and it was excellent. Loved how all the flavors mixed perfectly. Once again my only complaint was that $12 was a little much, considering you can go to Disney springs and get the gharadelli shake ( the best in the world) for about 7 dollars. You get to keep the cup your shake comes in here which is probably why it's highly priced. The desserts are plenty to share with someone. \\n\\nThe docor of the restaurant is awesome. It is very dark and makes you feel like you are actually inside a factory. There are TV screens on the wall making a projection of the factory at work. The service was top notch and even had Penelope come visit the table 2 times during our dining experience to tell us a little history of the emporium. It is def a place you want to come visit at least once. If you don't want to fork over for a dinner then I highly recommend trying one of their milkshakes. Def worth it."},{"name":"Lee's Bakery","address":"4005 Buford Hwy NE, Ste C","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"This place was delicious.

I got the BBQ pork full banh mi sandwich and a bowl of the beef pho. Everything was so delicious and fresh. The baguette for the sandwich was baked in house. Just crunchy enough on the outside and soft on the inside. The pork was sweet and a little spicy, served with lots of cilantro and a sort of asian slaw. I don't recall which kind of sauce was used on the bread but it was delicious. The soup was just as tasty. I've actually never had pho better than the pho at Lee's! The broth was very flavorful. I didn't even had to add any lime or hot sauce for flavor, as it was flavorful enough on its own. The beef was tender and tasty. \\n\\nI believe for the whole combo it was around $10 or less, which is amazing for that much food. I left having eaten all my soup and half the sandwich; I took the other half home for a snack later.

I usually get the mom size, although I recently had the dad size which seemed sort of...a bit underwhelming and mushy.

We spoke to the owner about natural casing, and he says they don't sell, because it grosses people out.

The veggies were cooked perfectly, and the purple sweet potato sauce was the perfect accompaniment to the dish.\\n\\nThen the start of the show arrived, the pork ramen. First the broth. A delicious pork bone broth that was incredibly rich with deep pork flavor. Ramen broth always runs the risk of being too salty, but it was seasoned very well. The pork belly itself was also very good. It had good flavor and was cooked very well- fall apart tender in the broth. The noodles were also pretty much perfect as they were tender but still had just a hint of a bite to them. Finally, all the other ramen accessories gave a great balance to the dish with the vegetables adding just the brightness that a rich dish needs. On top of all that, I didn't even look too ridiculous in my attempt to eat it  all with chopsticks, so win-win!\\n\\nOverall, I definitely recommend checking this place out!"},{"name":"Panera Bread","address":"430 Market St","city":"Lynnfield","stars":"2.5","text":"The food is fine, provided you get what you ordered.

Italians would never ever ever ever put anywhere close to that much sugar or butter in their pastries. The closest you can come to an Italian pastry in the North end is Modern Pastry and a small caffe that imports them like caffe dello sport or the paradiso. \\n\\nBy the way if you want a cannoli that was filled yesterday surrounded by a soggy shell, then yes this is your place, as well as the rats in their alley way playing around with their bags of sugar, thats always a sight for soar eyes. I saw that someone mentioned that there are always long lines and no prices, why is that? MARKETING they know how to con all of you! They advertise and commercialize themselves towards Americans that no offense, don't know a good pastry if it hit you in the face. So basically they get all these people who don't know any better telling people it's great. As well as the prices, well they can raise the price at will, and they make people that have never been there before stand in line without knowing the price so when you get to the counter you wont just walk away because you just stood in line for an hour and have to pay a good amount of money, I will say this though, they are not too expensive, although some people may think so, but you need to realize the cost of supplies have gone way up. \\n\\nAnyways don't go here please... there are sooo many better places"},{"name":"Mike's Pastry","address":"300 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"oh mikes, youre like the beatles before dylan. everybody fucking loves you."},{"name":"Ray's on the River","address":"6700 Powers Ferry Rd","city":"Sandy Springs","stars":"4","text":"Place is always amazing no matter how busy they are.\\n\\nFinally had a chance to take the wife to dinner and decided to go to Ray's, took the chance to go without a reservation (which is a big mistake, make one before you go).\\n\\nPlace was packed, must of have been prom night for some schools, but was told we would be sitted in the bar area, since the main dining was booked for the night.
