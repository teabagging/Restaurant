Honestly, 5 stars isn't enough for the amazing food and experience we had!   The ambiance is simple and beautiful, and the staff was friendly, attentive and knowledgeable.  They made sure that every detail of our experience was perfect.  And then there was the food.  OH. MY. GOD.  THE FOOD.  It was beyond perfection!  My husband and I love to go out for good food in our hometown of San Diego and everywhere we travel, and Saltyard truly stands up with the best meals we've had!\\n\\nWe stayed there for over two hours and the food and drinks kept coming the entire time.  I think we were all rolling ourselves out by the end but every new dish was too good to pass up.  We started with a cocktail from their signature drink list (I loved the Swift Kick in the Tito) and continued with bubbly and wine over the course of the meal.  In a typical review, I would highlight the dishes that I thought were truly exceptional....but that's not possible this time as I can't name one that WASN'T exceptional.  We feasted on deviled eggs, fresh oysters, charcuterie, brussels, burrata, street-style corn, smoked pork empanadas, duck confit, sliders with pimento cheese, gnocchi, and more!   Our group even had to order seconds of a few items because we just needed a little more.   After all of the amazing savory dishes, I was insistent that I couldn't possibly fit even another bite in my stomach.....and then dessert came out.  Once I saw the plate of impossibly perfect sweet treats, I was prepared to fight my friends to ensure that I got a few more bites of heaven!  \\n\\nChef Nick and his team have truly created something magnificent in Saltyard.  On our way out, we told him that we wanted to find a way to kidnap him and have him open a restaurant in San Diego so that we could enjoy his creations regularly.  In the meantime, we will dream of our Saltyard experience.....and if you are in Atlanta,  you MUST go to Saltyard and experience it yourself!!"},{"name":"The Rambler","address":"4205 N Mississippi Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I love this bar.

I'm a vegetarian, so I usually stick to the vegan tacos. The ingredients are usually fresh and delicious, but they've started pickling the radishes rather than having fresh ones on there. I know that's probably more \\"authentic\\" or whatever, but I miss those fresh ones. They just tasted better. I like that the menu is constantly changing, but I do miss some of my old favorites. Like, can we bring the arepas back? I know those aren't seasonal. Lastly, as other people have said, the chips are no good. This is probably to my advantage because I know I can go there without being tempted to fill up on fried chips. However, chips would be nice every now and then, and I just can't deal with Holy Taco chips.\\n\\nNow for the good: Servers are generally very friendly. Sometimes the service can be slow, but these guys get very busy, especially on a beautiful sunny day. By the way, that's good thing #2: all of the outside seating is really great. If it's a nice day out, I'm always really tempted to eat here. The drinks (especially the margaritas) are also very tasty. \\n\\nI frequent this place often, especially since it's in my 'hood. I don't know if I would bother if it weren't so convenient. But that might be more of a commentary on my laziness rather than on the restaurant itself. Holy Taco is a nice standby. I'm really glad it's there, but I'm never overly excited by the food I get there. It's still probably the best taco place in Atlanta."},{"name":"Beat Brasserie","address":"13 Brattle St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"The Beat Hotel is a fun place to get a drink, no doubt. The atmosphere is funky and the live music on the weekends is good. I would recommend The Beat Hotel for a drink. The Beat Hotel for a dinner experience? Not so much. My experience for dinner was disappointing from when I arrived. I went with a group of friends for my birthday. I made reservations in advance, arrived a few minutes early and checked in. Understandably, the table wasn't ready, so we hung out at a small table near the bar until it was. I noticed a large table had been cleared and set for some time (a little over 5 minutes after my reservation), yet no one had come and notified us. I had to go over to the hostess and ask about my table again, to then be notified that yes indeed that very table was for us and ready. Once we were seated, our waters were poured but the very last glass was only filled a third of the way since the pitcher ran out of water. Instead of the glass being promptly filled soon afterwards, I had to ask if this glass could be topped off when our server was taking our order. Having someone come over to top this glass off with water also took a long time.\\n I was also disappointed by the food, especially given how much we were paying for our meals. My friends also brought a cake in with us and asked the server if they could serve it to us. We were notified that the restaurant has a $2/person serving fee. I guess some restaurants have this fee. Instead, my friends decided to order me a chocolate tart complete with a lit candle. When the bill finally came, to all of our surprise, we were charged for the tart. Most restaurants will comp a single birthday dessert. Overall, I felt my dinner experience was very disappointing, considering we were each paying at least $40 per person. The food was definitely not worth this much money, and neither was the service. I would not recommend The Beat Hotel for a nice dinner."},{"name":"49th Parallel Coffee","address":"2902 Main Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Excellent service and coffee every time I visit this location.

We have done a few cooking classes before so we had an idea of what to expect. This class was a little different, but in good ways.\\n\\nFirst off, the space is very communal and beautifully decorated. There is one long, wooden table in the center of a large room where all the class attendees gather, making for a very social experience. After just a few minutes - and a glass of BYOB wine - everyone felt like old friends at a dinner party.\\n\\nEveryone takes turns doing something while the other folks watch. Unlike other classes where you are assigned a station that limits you to making one dish for the meal, here you will get to either see or be part of making every course. I thought this was a smart move. Rather than only learning how to make one dish, I felt like I learned how to make a full three-course dinner here.\\n\\nThe food - vegetable soup, chicken with handmade pasta, and strawberry cake - was very good. Having said that, the attendees (my amateur self included) were responsible for making it, so it was not utter perfection. \\n\\nA few notes about parking and other logistics for prospective attendees: \\n\\n- I didn't really believe, as the website indicated, that there would be free parking available on a Friday night in Somerville. There is. The class is located in a building that is a bit secluded, so you can hold off on the Uber if you don't mind driving.\\n\\n- The experience was long, and we didn't actually sit down to eat until about 10:45 pm. There was cheese and bread available as a snack when we arrived, but if you're coming really hungry, know that you're in for a long wait.\\n\\n- It gets hot in the kitchen. Mark mentions this in his email. Dress for a hot kitchen.\\n\\n- This is not a course on knife skills, saut√©ing, or other core culinary skills. You will learn how to make a dinner, and you'll do work that feels like the work of a prep cook. That's what my wife and I expected, so we weren't disappointed.\\n\\nHappy cooking!"},{"name":"Maurizios","address":"364 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"So, I scoured Yelp looking for an Italian place that would \\n--meet my dad's desire for a nice Italian meal, \\n--be casual enough to entertain families so my eight-year-old sister wouldn't be bothering anyone (because she tends to wander around and talk to people),  \\n--have classic Italian dishes that would satisfy my aunt, who is one of those Italian-Americans that is ferociously proud to be Italian without actually having any sense of Italian culture or cuisine,\\n--have some regional, authentic Italian dishes,\\n--be reasonably priced (apps $9 - 12, entrees $21 - 27), and finally\\n--have good reviews.\\n\\nMaurizio's met all these parameters so I made a reservation and that was that.  Here's how it all played out:\\n\\nATMOSPHERE:  Homely, charming, family-style.  But also cramped, cold and awkward.  There is no barrier between the dining room so on cold nights the air swooshes in each time the door is open and freezes both the upstairs and downstairs dining room. We were sitting downstairs and the air came right down and chilled us each time a patron arrived or left.\\n\\nSERVICE: Variable.  Our server was charming and patient, even with my sister who was quite tired and grumpy at that point after a long day of ice-skating and Museum of Science attending.  But there was also this hippo of a woman who barked at everyone to close the door and get out of her way.  Look lady, it's not the customer's fault that your restaurant is teensy.  Valet service was very efficient--they helped my Dad get my sister's toys out of the car right quick when we realized she was a bit antsy and needed a distraction.\\n\\nFOOD:  Very good.  Not amazing, but comfortingly hearty with very generous portions.  Some dishes were a little heavy handed with the salt and/or the cheese, but mostly everyone was happy and satiated.  \\n\\nWINE LIST:  Very cool.  A variety of Italian styles and a variety of prices.  \\n\\n\\nVerdict:  Pretty good.

This kid just loves eating six slices of pizza in one sitting with no two slices being the same. He's a kid so his quality standards are nil. CiCi's is relatively inexpensive so I've indulged this love for a few years. \\n\\nI can't do it anymore. Today I told him we couldn't come back again. In addition to the steady decline in what little food quality it had over the last several years, they now do not even have real tea. They have one of those four flavor \\"tea\\" dispensers that serves tea flavored  beverage. The four choices were green, black, southern sweet, or raspberry. I filled my cup most of the way with the unsweetened black and topped off with the southern sweet. When I tasted my \\"tea,\\" I wanted to gag. It had a very strong discount, off-brand, Kool-aid raspberry taste despite the fact that I did not choose Raspberry. I tried to drink it taking a couple of more sips, but the flavor was too repulsive. I dumped it out and filled my cup, designated for paid beverages, with plain water.\\n\\nI could overlook a place that has no tea. I can and will drink water. The entire restaurant, however, was filthy. There was debris, food, and general gunk all over the floor especially near the beverage station. They are apparently remodeling, perhaps to celebrate going out of business soon, and the remaining walls look dingy and stained. Too many tables were not cleared and not wiped down. They do expect patrons to clear their own tables now, but ultimately it is their responsibility to see that it is done. And patrons sure as hell can not be expected to clean the tables. \\n\\nThe area where the, now plastic, utensils are kept and the beverages are served smelled like rotting garbage. My stomach was turning before we even had our plates in hand. Fortunately, the kids chose a table far from beverage service and the smell was not noticeable there. Unfortunately, I had to use the restroom after our meal. That meant walking through the filth and stench near the beverage area to the restroom. The restroom, though not visibly dirty, smelled like an open sewer and cloyingly sweet air freshener. I had to struggle not to throw up while hurrying to finish, rapidly wash my hands, and get the hell out of there.\\n\\nI really, really regret letting my kids eat there today.

First off, the bartender was actually nice and funny.  His treatment of us, as the night progressed, was not good, for whatever reason.  I ordered a mixed drink (vodka/tonic) that tasted like straight rubbing alcohol. No big deal, I got a rum and diet instead.  Still tasted VERY strong and like really bad cheap rum with a dash of coke. I was sick to my stomach after a few sips so I just didn't drink at all.  NEXT, ordered a simple nacho appetizer, I asked for no onions and the chili on the side. 15-20 mins later comes back with a chili meal with chips on the side (not what we ordered) then the nachos with onions all over it shortly after.  Politely asked for new order of nachos done correctly. 20 minutes later they come out almost correct.  Had to keep asking for sides and drinks (water) repeatedly and wait so long between getting his attention and getting any food etc. At the end it took just about 25+ minutes to get a bill and have him run our cards. LASTLY he said oh why didn't you drink your drink?  I said I still really didn't like it and he goes \\"Hey, think it might be YOU?\\" to which I didn't respond.  I was so uncomfortable, couldn't wait to leave.  I actually planned on coming back but I would never now and on top of that the entrees were grossly overpriced for an average bar ($22-29) although there were some burgers etc.  Manager was fairly useless too, on top of all this.

I must admit I was skeptical as I am not a sports fan and considering it was rated really low by some Yelpers. However, I was willing to check it out with the promise we would only stay for one drink.\\n\\nOur experience consisted of being greeted at the door and being seated right away. Upon being seated we were given two free drink tickets each as it was their anniversary. The servers were very attentive and made sure we had everything we needed. The drink selection was pretty good for a sports bar where one would expect to only find the old standbys. I noticed they had a number of inventive cocktails and Caesars on special, hard cider, wine, PBR for the hipsters, and locally brewed beers on tap.  We all ordered the seasonal Whistler Chestnut Ale as it is delicious. We then all decided we would try the Sunday special which was three sliders on a pretzel bun for  $6.75. All the sliders have to be the same, but you are able to choose from  pulled pork, beef brisket, smoked duck, smoked turkey, and I think one other kind of meat  I can't remember. When the sliders arrived I was really impressed. They are definitely worth ordering. For my main I tried out the organic bison sausage chilli with cornbread. Again this was another winner having just the right amount of heat balanced against the moist sweetness of the corn bread. My partner ordered the smoked rib appetizer, but guarded them ferociously so no one could get close enough to try them. I figure they must have been pretty good. The staff told us that they smoke all their own meats in a smoker out back. So it is no wonder the food is well above your average pub fare. \\n\\nThe decor is actually way nicer than the downtown location. The only thing that bugged me was the blaring football game commercials. It was pretty loud last night and I would assume most nights. So not exactly a place to bring a girl on a date. However, this would be the perfect place to go watch a hockey game if they ever decide to play again. Or just go to a hockey strike support meetings. \\n\\nI will be the first to admit Yelp is not always right. I sort of felt bad sitting there eating a nice meal, drinking really good beer, in a bar full of people having a great time thinking 'I can't believe Yelper's only gave this place two stars'. So sports fans I would recommend checking it out. As for Yagger's turn the volume down on the commercials and maybe consider having a cask night."},{"name":"Rize Artisan Pizza + Salads","address":"675 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"After hearing another review about the waverly, I was a little apprehensive but the pizza sounded too good not to try.

Anyways to the food...\\n\\nSmaller Plates:\\nChocolate Potato Doughnuts with Creme Anglaise- Mehh.. could have done without it. Basically, it was mediocre but for 1.5/each it seemed like a good deal and worth the try. There was no chocolate taste in this \\"Chocolate Potato Doughnut,\\" and the creme was boring. Overall, it was nothing special and I wouldn't order again. \\nErin's Sweet Biscuits- Now this is something to come for. Yes, there might be complains about the biscuits being too small (which is understandable) but they're worth the 6 dollars for 3 biscuits. They are plated nicely with whole blueberries drizzled on the top and fresh homemade whip creme. The biscuits itself have a thin sweet crust and a fluffy middle. Delightful.\\n\\nBigger Plates:\\nCast Iron Frittata- The frittata was a thin layer of eggs mixed with mostly asparagus and kale. It was light, fluffy, and wasn't a heavy meal. My only complaint might be that it tasted a tad oily. \\nAuntie Paula's French Toast- This was my favorite \\"Bigger Plate.\\" The french toast was so delectable and tasty. I was expecting for there to be the typical maple syrup, but I was pleasantly surprised by the wonderful compote of what I'm guessing was peach that covered the bottom of my plate. for 12 dollars, you get 4 medium/large slices of french  toast. If you're dining with others, opt for the full rather than the half order because it's just too good not to share. \\nMoroccan Chicken Hash- This hash was pretty darn good. It was well seasoned and came with a big sunny side up egg on the top. Kale, asparagus, bell peppers, and sauteed onions are mixed in with the flavorful potatoes. \\n\\nDining with two other petite girls, we were skeptical at first if we could finish all of this food.

I appreciate what the Fuji group has brought to boring Quincy and regularly eat at Fuji, Beni, Kama, and Shabu, but tonight at Kama was truly pathetic. In so far as a single night at a venue can utterly undo years of good faith, this was it. We sat at the bar for 30 minutes before we were able to catch the waitress/bartender's eye. When we finally did, we ordered drinks and several small plates. She forgot my drink order and all food orders. Eventually I was able to order a single drink and ask for a few small plates again. She served the drink but seemingly forgot the food order. I understand that restaurants such as Kama make money off of drinks and not the fine food which differentiates Kama from its neighbors but this was absurd. We went out tonight expecting to spend hundreds of dollars. Instead we spent say $30 and promptly went elsewhere. I'm sorry to say but a single shit server is all it takes to lose regular customers forever. We'll never visit the spot again.

No one is perfect and we all have our bad days. However, there is only a degree of \\"poor service\\" that I believe you can accommodate or overlook before it affects your eating experience and you (I) would refuse to return regardless of how good or cheap the food may be. In the past, I had heard from other friends that they don't like coming here because of the terrible service; however, I had excused it as that hadn't been my experience until now. \\n\\nI came here with my parents and siblings for a late Mother's Day brunch about a week ago. However, we were appalled that the waitress/hostess completely ignored our group after we had been waiting for awhile to be seated and chose to seat the Chinese family standing behind us. Worst part is, she never even came back to us or even acknowledged us. We had to finally approach someone to point out the blatant lack of service and acknowledgment to us before they seated us with an attitude. To make matters worse, after we were finally seated, the waitress informed us that we could not order from the menu and could ONLY eat whatever they had available for dim sum. As this was late afternoon, we were confused since 1) other tables were obviously eating food from the menu; and 2) the dim sum selections were limited to only 4-5 dishes!! My poor elderly parents were very hungry since we had waited for so long to be sesated so we attempted to overlook their rude service and limited food options and stayed. My younger sister was getting very upset and my mom was trying to calm her and all our growing agitation regarding the whole experience by telling us it was \\"all right\\" although she was having difficulty swallowing the bland and over oily food. I drank a lot of tea to wash down the heavy oil in the food. \\n\\nWe eat a lot of chinese food since my mother is a quarter Chinese and there are a lot of Chinese influence in the Vietnamese culture and food; however, I would have to admit that since this establishment has gone through new management, the service AND food was highly lacking and honestly, unacceptable. I've definitely had better chinese food AND service somewhere else. Portland is a diverse city where we have many restaurants that accommodate all different palates and cultures. So, if you want good chinese food AND acceptable service, I would not recommend this place.

The pastrami has a thicker cut than usual so it's really filling, especially if you order the whole sandwich. The sauerkraut is also a thick cut of cabbage, almost like cole slaw but smothered with house made Russian dressing.

Good start, MuQu, I liked you already.\\n\\nMe and my friend started with Mango Nana smoothies, which were sooo tasty.

Black beans stew\\nwith fresh & dried meat, pork, sausage\\n& bacon. Served with collard greens,\\nfried plantain, farofa & orange.\\n\\nThis was not as special/different, but okay nonetheless. Too bad, I'm still deducing 1/2 a point.

Based upon the menu, with the inclusion of Haleem and Chicken Karahi, I think I can safely say the food is of the Pakistani variety which is great because I don't have to drive down to the Lamar/Rundburg area for my fix of Pakistani food. The Korma was exactly how I would expect it to be. And despite complaints now and forever by those outside the cuisine, I am happy to say the chicken is bone-in (Oh, thank you thank you!!). The rice could have been better,it was a bit hard and dried out. \\n\\nAlso if Teji's which is the gold standard at the moment can sell a curry and include rice for under $10, then so can this place.

They take barbecued meat or chicken and add different twists to each one. The Pork Belly taco is bursting with flavor in every bite, with delicious soft meat melting in your mouth. My second favorite taco is the Chicken Al Pastor Tacos (whoever decided to add pineapple to tacos is an absolute genius.) Not only are the tacos delicious, with various ingredients tantalizing your taste buds but they are also affordable ranging from $3-4 each. \\n\\nMy significant other had the brisket which was juicy and flavorful. \\n\\nMy favorite part of this restaurant is the American Barbecue with a Hispanic twist.

Our table for 9 was ready on time, and our server (feel terrible that I forgot his name, but he's Swedish!) was friendly and attentive without being overbearing. He went over the menu, noting that dishes on the left side were original house recipes. While mulling over the entrees, we ordered 2 bottles of wine (used the 25% yelp check-in deal!) and several antipasti to start. The prosciutto and fresh pears was the perfect combo of sweet and salty, and the calamari was fresh and crispy, accompanied by a tangy caper sauce. \\n\\nWhen asked for his entree recommendations, our server didn't hesitate to say the Tortelli di Mele - 3 or 4 of us at the table ordered this, and everyone licked their plates clean. The apple, sausage and brown butter was such a decadent pairing that, ironically, did not feel heavy. Hands down winner of the evening. My linguine and shrimp was also fantastic, with the noodles cooked perfectly al dente. The complimentary bread was hot and fresh, and simply sublime when paired with the olive oil - easy to fill up on this alone! Finally, I alerted the server that it was also my sister's birthday, and he brought out a lovely tiramisu with a lit candle at the end of the meal....the extra spoons were a nice touch, ha.\\n\\nWe loved the dark, cozy ambiance of the restaurant - though small, it was lively and we didn't feel out of place with our loud, celebratory behavior! Service was on point throughout, and the food was simply top notch - authentic, simple, flavorful. I love restaurants with smaller, more curated menus that stay true to their roots - this is such a place. Couldn't have asked for a better venue to celebrate my sister's birthday and engagement!\\n\\nWhile we didn't utilize it, there appeared to be a large pay-for-parking lot directly across the street.

Absolutely delectable layers of vanilla cake and lemon mascarpone cream are topped with streusel and served with strawberries, syrup, and whipped cream, and I think I tasted lady fingers as well. The cake is so moist and soaks up the strawberry syrup, strawberry juice, and lemon mascarpone. You can see the photo I posted. The mixture of the strawberry and lemon made it taste like passion fruit. I am not a fan of their cheesecake; I find it too soft and lacking in taste, and it just doesn't have the right texture - I am quite smug about the cheesecake I bake (my secret recipe), although ordering cheesecake is fun here because of all the choices. The rest of the menu is just okay; this is a chain. I was recently in Austria and Germany and was terribly disappointed by the desserts there, even in Vienna's famous cafes.

Our waiter came over swiftly, and water was brought by support staff.  I would have loved a little cornbread on the table, cause I looove cornbread, but that's ok (sniff sniff).  My wife ordered the green goddess salad to start, and was not disappointed.  I ordered the crab bisque, and it was tasty, just a tad thicker than I prefer (acknowledging personal preference entirely!).  The crab was shredded to the point of pretty much dissolving in the bisque, slightly heartier pieces would be great.  We ordered a few drinks, that all tasted great; slightly larger portions would have been nice.  Entrees, my wife ordered the 1/2 rack of ribs, I ordered the catfish.  The half-rack was a bit small for $26, but the meat fell off the bone.  I requested the peppercorn dressing instead of pepper cajun remoulade sauce, and felt that it complemented the fish quite well.  Our total bill came to just north of $100 pre-tip.  \\n\\nCircling back to the service.  Our waiter was very attentive.  The bisque & salad came out not more than 5 minutes after we placed our order.  Our water glasses were never left empty more than 2 minutes before someone came by to fill them up.

The place has all the right ideas but didn't deliver in my book. We started out with the smoked bluefish cakes that were served with a mango mustard sauce. These cakes were great and mango would have been nice except for the fact that they must have tossed in extra hot chilies that night because our mouths were burning so badly that we couldn't taste anything. Next, David's pulled pork sandwich was basically soaked in vinegar. It was so sour that he eventually just had to stop eating. When I tasted it I made the face that you would make when eating Sour Patch Kids. Finally, I order the pasta bolognese against every bone in my body since I read that someone enjoyed it on yelp.

If you have a craving for an actual, good salad, don't set yourself up for disappointment like I did. If you choose pasta instead of salad to go with your entree, be prepared for a second course -- it's a HUGE portion, and not too bad.

She reported that it was just ok; I think she might have found a foreign hair in it, which understandably turned her off.\\n\\nAtmosphere: 4\\nIt's a tiny place, but it has very cute old-world-ish decor. I can definitely see how it fills up quickly and stays full around dinner time & after. Good thing they recently opened a bar right across the street where you can get drinks & apps while you're waiting for your meal.\\n\\nOverall, I give this place 3 stars.

I like the size of the place. Pretty cool concept. No tvs (thank you thank you, wish more places would adopt that idea) Intimate, yet not really cozy. Good for a date, a quick TINY bite.A bit loud. Bring large bills and a small appetite. Service is ok, but seems fabricated, not truly friendly,  just good enough to get you to splurge your money and then replace you with the next number. Bar seating arrangements cracked me up. The invisible velvet rope. Someone polices the bar seats. If you walk in and find empty seats at the bar, you will be approached immediately with a lame excuse. \\"We have a waiting list\\" \\"Someone is here for those,\\"  except no one ever showed for them. Once seated, two more opened next to us and others were steered away in the same fashion, yet they stayed empty for almost an hour. Bizarre! If you BS, at least dont get caught at it.....I was there last on the Spain menu night.... Being from Spain myself, I know all about tapas and Spanish wine. Tapas are traditionally meant to be small bites to enjoy with bevies in between lunch and Dinner, to carry you over, really a social event.\\nTapas are in fashion and many locations that are trend followers add them to their menu. Most of them do a terrible job. Butcher shop does a pretty good job with it. Even though tapas were never meant to be pricey, it can be understood since it is the South End. . By the way, Frijoles is not a word from the Spanish Cuisine. That would be Jud√≠as!! Frijoles is a latin term and dish.  Spain is not a state in Mexico.\\nThe special menu was relatively dull. It gave me the impression of the chef while on vacation, visited and entire Country in a quick afternoon. Then mixed up its regional food from a Spain cook book in an odd menu. Now serves it up on large white fancy plates, which can make small servings look even smaller. No biggie this far, but pick some better choices!!! Especially when it comes to wine. Spanish wine has gone up in price, but still remains affordable. There are fantastic wines to be had. None of them at this location. $14 for a glass of mediocre Mencia? Thats ridiculous. For that price range I expect top choices. Not boring table wine with a cheap label. The Crianza from Rioja was a little better. The Catalu√±a wine...ehhh \\nBTW, Crianza wines are best served around 17 celsius...slightly below room temperature. Not soup warm. \\nInteresting over salted butter. More like a dish of salt with a pinch of butter. A salad with no flavor. Ok Manchego, though you can find a better one at Costco. Meat is good. All and all pretty disappointed. No Ooumpf!

I tried fried spring rolls, chicken buns, sticky rice stir fry, and custard buns. \\n\\nThe spring rolls were delightfully crispy and predictably greasy and were nuclear-hot on the inside. Great. Lovely. Except they had fat slabs of mushrooms on the inside. I just pulled em out. But if you love fungus, you know where to go!\\n\\nThe chicken buns were unexpectedly good. The bread was soft and warm- in fact, everything we got here was really hot and fresh. There's also a hot pepper oil on the table that can help kick things up a notch. Yum.\\n\\nThe sticky rice stir fry was GIANT, especially considering you're paying just over $3 for it. It was a big crock that could easily and generously be split 4 ways. It had little chunks of pork in it and a nice flavor that got even nicer with liberal application of the aforementioned pepper oil. \\n\\nI was pretty full by the time the custard buns came out but I still jammed one down for kicks. It was great. Just top notch. Really soft warm bun, delicious custard, blandly sweet comforting flavor. Awesome. Would recommend. \\n\\nI think most dim sums are a little hit and miss.

I had given up on any chance of having a transcendent frozen dessert experience altogether when I read Portland Monthly's review of The Maple Parlor.  I quickly added the Maple Parlor to my to-do list for my next visit to my hometown of Portland. I admit, I was a bit skeptical but the proprietress, April, hails from Jade, one of my all-time favorite Sellwood haunts, so I had hope. I should have known the MP would be nothing less than fabulous. Finding one non-dairy option is a miracle at any fro-yo place but the MP is an echelon above those strip mall joints dispensing sticky-sweet piles of fake colored goo. This stuff is gourmet, and the MP has multiple non-dairy options (coconut, beet-strawberry - which wasn't as bad as it sounds) and even a Paleo friendly option (chocolate banana, and it was to die for). Toppings were mostly gluten free and house made - the sesame crunchies are AMAZING, and this caramel lover just about died over the coconut caramel sauce. There was candied bacon, local berry sauce, all kinds of amazing foodie topping options. Super cute decor and friendly service rounded out the experience. Yes, it costs a little bit more than the mall rat fro-yo, but your body and taste buds will thank you. This would make a great date night dessert stop for your vegan/gluten-free/Paleo sweetie (hint,hint!) or for anyone looking for some amazing frozen confections.

To have and to hold, to order then devour, forsaking all others when you need inexpensive $1.99 dim sum on a weekday? Do you promise to honor, patronize, and tip well for as long as you both shall live (or at least until you find a better/cheaper/more convenient dim sum restaurant)?\\"\\n\\n\\"Hai Du!\\"\\n\\nI'm far from the most experienced connoisseur of dim sum - though I'd heard of the term, I didn't even really know what it was until about 5 years ago - but for now Hai Du has become my go-to place for dim sum in pdx!\\n\\nIt seems like by now everyone knows and loves dim sum, but if like me you're a little behind the Chinese cuisine curve it's really simple: dim sum is just a collection of smaller sized dishes, traditionally offered in the late am until early afternoon, and served with tea (think Chinese tapas). You can order just a few for a snack, or a bunch for a whole meal, and typically the dishes are a little more exotic than your average Chinese-American fare. For me it's a great and inexpensive way to try new things that I might not be ready to gamble on for my entire meal.\\n\\nIt seems the \\"trendy\\" way to serve dim sum here in the States is via a rolling cart making the rounds to your table, but I prefer how they do it at Hai Du where you get check list (like in some sushi places) and a picture menu that substitutes pretty well for the visual appeal of seeing what you're ordering on display before you actually make up your mind. It also means that your dim sum will be super fresh rather than sitting on a cart for god knows how long before it comes to your table. And at Hai Du they bring it out your plates as they're cooked, so depending on how much you order you can have an endless stream of plates delivered to enjoy, rather than everything all at once.\\n\\nWe had been eyeing this place for some time now, but often were lured away at the last minute by the fabulous Cha Ba Thai just a few steps west on the same stretch of NE Sandy (http://www.yelp.com/biz/cha-ba-thai-portland#hrid:xcA2nAQmuUSpvFN4nt0j-A); however this past Sunday we arrived few hours before Cha Ba opened, and decided to finally give Hai Du a shot (they open @ 10:30am 7-days a week!) - so glad we did!\\n\\nSince we're still exploring the world of dim sum, and we'd never been to Hai Du before, we decided to anchor our meal with an entree of Kung Pao Chicken, and supplement it with a number of dim sum plates. As it turned out the Kung Pao, while fairly tasty and very cheap ($5.50 on their lunch menu), was not terribly spicy, didn't have any zucchini or squash, and was only average; certainly not good enough to tear me away from my favorite Chinese place in NE Portland (http://www.yelp.com/biz/lucky-house-restaurant-and-lounge-portland#hrid:ozgaE7DNpb0iB9oH-3lfOQ). They do offer cheap $5-7 lunch combos (with fried rice, crab puffs, fried shrimp and soup), as well as reduced price entrees without all the extras; probably the way to go if you're also ordering dim sum, which in truth is what really made this meal.\\n\\nSome was a little hit or miss, and due to my lack of experience with many of these dishes I can't say if it was poor execution or just a well-prepared item that's doesn't really float my boat, but most of what we had was fantastic. On the weekends they price each dim sum plate differently, and while it's all quite inexpensive, it's a crazy cheap flat rate ($1.99/plate) all day M-F. At those prices I might even get adventurous enough to try the Chicken Feet!\\n\\nItem's we loved included a Turnip Cake (sorta like a mildly seasoned hash brown), Siu Mai, Potstickers, and Fried Shrimp (in a soft, bready, almost pretzel like batter - though it was included as part of our Kung Pao combo, I think it's also available on the dim sum menu). They really cook tofu well, searing it on the outside and leaving it soft, though not mushy on the inside. The only dish we wouldn't order again was the Steamed Shrimp roll; imagining it would be sort of like a salad roll, we were disappointed by the gelatinous, translucent substance in which a few small shrimp hid.\\n\\nMany of the dim sum items come with their own sauce, and while I'm sure they were tailored to compliment the specific item, it was fun and tasty to mix 'n match. The service was very attentive, frequently refilling out water, clearing away empty plates, and even asking how we'd like our leftovers boxed up. The place was rather empty at midday on a Sunday, but I'd say roughly 80% of the other diners or take-out customers were Asian, so take that for what it's worth.\\n\\nAll in all Hai Du is decent enough if you're looking for \\"regular\\" Chinese-American food, and really good for dim sum - especially if you're a newcomer to the cuisine. For lunch, even on the weekends, their prices are hard to beat, and we'll definitely be back often."},{"name":"The Butcher Shop","address":"552 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Wow this food - A-mazing!

Two of my friends worked at a branch and they seemed to have a lot of fun. Of course, they both worked at another location. As soon as I learned a cheese collection technique that involved scooping the runoff from the trough that caught it and sprinkling the runoff on the pie, I knew that the fun to be had when working at a pizza restaurant only existed on TV.\\n\\nAnother job I once held involved serving slices to fratty types long into the wee hours after the bars closed in the Marina. The position boasted constant contact with a blazing hot oven and various slurred vernaculars I learned from numerous patrons. Of course, I got to drink on the job and met my boyfriend from the experience. On the other hand, it took a year after I left that job to really want pizza again.\\n\\nI bring this mini-resume up to illustrate a point: I have no delusions about pizza. I know how easy it is to make, how low the overhead costs are of running a halfway functional pizza parlor, and how even the most disgusting of pies will taste like heaven after a few shots of whiskey. So I don't expect a lot out of the pizza I eat, but I don't really seek it out that often, either.\\n\\nLuckily, Gladstone Pizza and Coffee - if you're like me, you're all \\"There's coffee?!?\\" - came along and un-jaded my outlook. How can a thin slab of dough covered in nothing but tomato sauce and cheese with some basil leaves here and there, for the sexy, taste that good? Do they put crack in it? Or do they trust in the freshness and local sourcing of most of their vittles and forgo the narcotic route to bring you nothing short of a moan-inducing meal? I've eaten Gladstone's margherita pizza a few times now with different groups of people, and even the most pig-headed carnivore (see what I did there?!?) swoons at the taste. \\n\\nPersonally, I'm sure the microbrews on tap probably help.

Needless to say, I came back (that very next day of course). I brought a different friend this time (who had never tried Cambodian) and I am sure I have converted her also. This time I order the curried pork and she had the fish with the mango. We also ordered their version of a scorpion bowl (it was huge) which was quite delicious and cost $25 dollars. We sat by the window and could not understand why people kept staring as they walked by. Once we left and walked by where we sat (the bowl was still on the table) we understood why! IT WAS HUGE!

The decor is very trendy-chic but what is so great about it is, that they managed to weave their culture into it. Nice touch!

The doorman looked barely drinking age himself and clearly didn't know how to tell the difference between a fake ID and a real out of state ID, so much so that he bent hers in half, nearly breaking it, so that it now has a crease down the middle. On top of that he was extremely rude about the whole ordeal and reminded me more of one of my high school students than a doorman. Needless to say The Hereafter did not receive our business (we would have easily spent $100 as a group), and we will be patronizing a different establishment when our friends come to town.

Good balance of tart and meaty flavors\\n\\nMexican corn - I really likes this dish, fun take on Mexican street corn. They used corn kernels and mixed it with mayo, cheese, lime and Mexican chili.

I think this octopus has been frozen, thawed, refrozen, and rethawed then overcooked to hell.

I figure just a little bit will do... but then ended up adding an entire mountain of salt to suffice for the somewhat strange tasting congee. And even then I'm just eating salt. The har gow is just as you'd expect har gow should taste, and the har cheung is about the same. No one ever asked me what kind of tea I wanted, both times I went; maybe because they assumed automatically from my fluent English that I'm a jook sing? So all in all, I don't know.

However, should the the passerby happen to give this small, warm establishment a chance, they would find their initial thoughts to be...off the mark.\\n\\nTang's Wok certainly serves their variation on the dishes that are typically found at American-Chinese restaurants such as: General Tso's Chicken, Kung Pao Chicken, Honey Walnut Shrimp (all extremely delicious by the way).  \\n\\nMany primarily miss out on the full \\"TW\\" experience due to the fact that they do not order off the \\"Asian\\" menu, which has offerings of delicious authentic Chinese & Taiwanese dishes.

It is difficult to find authentic Taiwanese fare in the Vancouver area, which is why I was pleasantly surprised to discover that they served it (much to my stomach's delight).  \\n\\nThe owners are an older couple that are exceptionally kind and warm people.

We have been anticipating it's opening since finding out about it, and it did not disappoint at all!\\n\\nWe randomly decided to try and see if we could get in at all, since the restaurant had been open less than a week and had so much buzz surrounding it. To our pleasant surprise we were told it would only be a small 20 minute wait for a table for 2. We wandered over to the bar area to get a better idea of these in-house crafted beers we had heard so much about.\\n\\nThe service in the bar area was a little confusing to start with. There is a bar (completely full) and a couple of standing room long tables (brilliant idea) and then a couple tables and booths on the opposite wall. We were unsure whether to try and order from the bar or if there was service at these tables. It turns out either way is an option, but if you're not at the bar, it's better to wait for a member of the service team to get you what you want.\\n\\nMy fiancee ordered the Ravenous Red and I ordered the Raven's Head to start with. Wow are both of these beers amazing. The Ravenous is the perfect summer ale, light and crisp with a citrusy finish. By contrast, the Raven's head is a much darker beer, but only in color. By keeping the ABV down and aging the beer in grenache casks, the beer takes on an amazing complexity reserved for darker beers but was still possessed a light mouth feel. As soon as our beers arrived we were told our table was ready. We were also informed that if we had an open tab it would be no trouble to transfer it to our table.\\n\\nHaving worked in the service industry, this is a minor miracle. Everyone seemed to be okay with this set up, so I don't know how they're splitting the tips, but thank you for putting the focus on making the customer's experience as painless as possible!\\n\\nThe main dining area is very nice. It feels at once both comfortable and spacious, like being invited to a grand Sunday dinner. And the menu! My goodness. We had so much trouble deciding which dishes to try for our first time here. Thankfully, our server was very well informed and was able to guide us around some potential pitfalls. We ordered a half-dozen oysters, the ham tasting, and the lamb heart to share.\\n\\nA word about the oysters: My fiancee was initially confused because she thought there were 4 types of oysters and you picked which ones to try. While this option is available, it's more expensive. The regular option is called the \\"shucker's choice.\\" You get 6 or 12 oysters that they pick for you. This is a great option, though we probably should have ordered 12 so there were at least 2 of each type of oyster. Regardless we had some of the best oysters I've ever eaten here.\\n\\nThe ham tasting: Please don't think of this as a regular, brown sugar style ham that you may have eaten for Christmas or Easter. This is high-end, grade A, competing with the best prosciuttos and serranos ham. As a previous reviewer noted, the hams progress in intensity and flavor, with clear, distinct differences between the 3 we tried. The biscuits and jam were equally delicious and a great accompaniment to the presentation.\\n\\nIf you are nervous about ordering anything \\"weird,\\" like the lamb heart, please try it here. The balance of all the flavors is absolutely wonderful. When I read the description of the dish, I was a little curious how peanuts and popcorn would pair with something like grilled lamb heart, and pleasantly the answer is beautifully. A note for those who tend to order meats past medium-rare: Either enjoy this as it comes or don't order it. The parts of the heart that were medium (the edges), were much tougher and had a completely different quality than the beautiful inner part. Wow.\\n\\nAfter all of this delicious food, we were on such a natural food high that we decided to order dessert. If there's one thing I've learned in all the time I've known my fiancee, it's this: If you're offering pie for dessert, that's what she's ordering.\\n\\nThis was no exception here, and the lemon meringue pie arrived on it's own little pie stand. Having ordered some lemon meringue in my day, I can say that this ranks as one of the best I've had. The crust was perfect for the size of the pie, a little crumbly yet also buttery at the same time. The lemon custard was perfectly balanced, expressing the tart lemon flavor but balancing it with just the right amount of sweetness. The meringue was amazing as well, perfectly baked off without any hint of that baked egg white flavor so common in most meringue toppings.\\n\\nIt's safe to say we plan on coming back here many times.

We'll see you again soon."},{"name":"Salsa & Agave Mexican Grill","address":"1205 Pacific Boulevard","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"This restaurant gave me the worst food poisoning I've ever had.

The cauliflower usually isn't something I'd get, but it was cooked perfectly in what I can assume is some delicious fish sauce.  The braised beef cheek curry was sweet, savory, beefy, and peppery.  The chunks of cheek were tender to the point of being able to be cut by my spoon.  The roti was buttery and warm and just amazing to dip into the remaining curry.  On the second visit I got their turmeric curry, even after ignoring the spice warning, and more roti.  My goodness, the curry was sweet spicy goodness that made me sweat and cry with joy.

It was the Morning in Seville. The gin was a bit light and it had too much absinthe.

The decor, concept and menu are really great, but I felt like I had to navigate the menu to feel like I got my monies worth.  Though a $2.50 per skewer (lower end of the price range) may look cheap, you're going to end up paying $5 for two, according to their policy.  It's hard to mentally keep a tab on how much your racking up, but be sure it's going to be a bit expensive.\\n\\nBetween the two of us, we ordered five skewers.  My ranking starting with the best:\\n\\nBaby Octopus:  The best!  Spicy with a tangy taste to it.\\nIndonesian Lamb:  Cooked perfectly!\\nChicken Heart:  Simple, yet enticingly unusual.\\nBBQ Buffalo:  Very tender and flavorful.  Worth trying.\\nQuail Egg:  Pretty filling for bacon lovers.\\n\\nI also got the salted duck salad, which I thought was very delicious.  \\n\\nSo I have to tell you why I rounded up for Ping:  THEY HAVE THE BEST PORK BUNS EVER!  I'm not kidding!  The. Best.  I don't rant and rave in my reviews, either.  I didn't even want to order the damned things, because my experience with pork buns tends to be flavorless dough with gross BBQ sauce and pork gristle.  But these are so sweet, made with good pork and has a flavor I can't quite place.  We had to order an extra one to split.  Get them!  They're worth the $4.\\n\\nThey have a fancy new wireless payment system where you can swipe your card, choose how much you want to tip, then enter either your PIN or sign for credit.  It seems really cool, but it is kind of awkward when the server is hovering while you select a tip.

The Gnocchi was pan fried and had a very doughy flavor...they didn't taste like or have the texture of typical gnocchi at all. The gnocchi came in a broth which was under seasoned and didn't add anything to the dish...just made the gnocchi mushy.

I had to eat with napkins wrapped on everything from then out and couldn't finish the sandwich for fear I'd ingest the part my now-jockstraped hand had touched.\\n\\nThe sides were the highlight, they were both surprisingly tasty!  The sweet potato was sweet, a bit chunky, and seasoned well while the dirty taters had yummy onion bits and a good coating of salty steaky seasoning.\\n\\nLeaving was the hardest part.

This makes it a convenient drive and nice enough to remove yourself from the city setting for  escaping into nature's glory for a refresher on the beauty of Texas. Since the brewery primarily has only outdoor seating served by picnic tables, it's best to visit when the weather is not going to bake your skin off. This brewery is family friendly which includes kids and dogs. Not being a parent, I must admit that it was a little unusual for me to see kids playing on the grounds of the brewery, but there was plenty of land for them to run off their energy away from the sitting areas. We enjoyed some live music from a guitar playing popular covers on is guitar which added to the wonderful ambiance. \\nNote: Stanley's Farm House Pizza shares the property with Jester King and also serves beer that is not Jester King's but other popular Texas beers, if Jester King's beer does not satisfy your palette. I'll review Stanley's Farmhouse pizza in a separate review though. \\nFrom previous Yelp reviews that I read and other brewery tours that I have taken, I thought Jester King was going to follow suit by having the customer pay a flat rate of $10 or so with a designated amount of tastings. Perhaps they used to do that or maybe still do that on other days but Sundays. When I went on Sunday, I presented my ID, got my hand stamped, and was told to go to another building on the property slightly on a hill which is actually Jester King Brewery. We were given a menu and told that we could create our own flights of 4 oz pours since  they all had different prices ranging from $2.50-5. I've been to several dozen wineries and breweries, and don't think I prefer this concept. Also, there were certain beers that they would let you try before you committed to a 4 oz. pour or full glass, but they would not do that for any of their farmhouse brews which made me a little disappointed. Going with a small group of friends was nice as it provided this sip sample concept that I was hoping to get. My favorite was the Mad Meg farmhouse ale, Noble King farmhouse ale, and Commercial suicide. I generally love stouts, and the Black Metal was pretty good, but the type of hops they used threw the taste off a little for me. I enjoyed the tour that they gave at 3:00pm and learned that they even grow their own local yeast here to put into their beers. They have some beers that they let the yeast grow wild from 1-3 years in different types of barrels. The tour guide said that they use all types of barrels, but they prefer wine barrels most because of their size. The tour was very informative as I love becoming educated on the process of brewing beer. Overall, I didn't prefer most of Jester King's beer due to the sour profile taste found in most of their beers. This is the description that they printed on their menu in case you're wondering, so I'm not making it up. However, while JK's beer is not my personal preference, I appreciated that there were other beers to drink at Stanley's farm house so I can come back here to enjoy the scenery and drink with friends. I wish I could give this place 3.5 stars because my rating for the beer is 3 stars and my rating for the establishment would be 4 stars."},{"name":"Island Hopper","address":"91 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"I always pass by this place when trolling through Newbury for many more ways to spend whats left in my bank account, however considering the location, the lack of customers always comes off as conspicuous.

Classy clientele I gotta tell ya. \\n\\nSo, the remodel is cool. Amazing metal entrance to a semi dark space. The bar greets you immediately which I like. Cocktails are semi fussy which leads me to a small rant; I shouldn't have to google what ingredients are in my drink. Also, when the bartender warns you a drink is spicy...heed the warning. Wifey didn't finish the habanero infused peach number.\\n\\nWe dined with a local celebrity in the bar and dining scene in Drippin' Springs. We loved the bacon and bourbon infused chex mix so much we had to reorder before he arrived. Moving onto the deviled eggs with pickled onions and sliced radishes. I usually condemn what I consider holiday family slash reunion dining food; but it was good bites. \\n\\nMight as well get the bad stuff out of the way; the ribs sucked. Imagine retirement home ribs where you put it your mouth and pull the bone clean. I don't remember the flavor or ingredients; just a vision of ribs in a pressure cooker. No tear means not BBQ material. Chili's makes better ribs than Proof and Cooper; and thats sayin' alot. \\n\\nThe catfish sandwich wasn't much better with a strange starburst orange citrus flavor in the remolaude. I'd suggest ordering it on the side as the sammy was covered in it. As for good grub we found the fried chicken to be moist and delicious. We also marveled at the addition of squash in the Texas Caviar. Some good dishes, some bad. A few tweaks would make P&C a damn fine establishment."},{"name":"4 Rivers Smokehouse","address":"11764 University Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"I had the pulled pork sandwich, the meat was tender and moist.

Just smoke-flavored meat that sits there in your plate, lacking excitement. \\n\\nSausage: average. The skin doesn't have much char, or carbonization. The meat has decent flavor, but it's a little squishy and doesn't have a firm texture to it. \\n\\nRibs: Above average. Flavor comes from a very salty, spicy rub. The flavor of the rub is actually a little overpowering, you can't really taste anything else. Luckily, I liked the rub flavor. Texture-wise, again, the ribs are a little... gooey. But the flavor is good. \\n\\nChicken: Exceptional. Very good flavor on the chicken. Real surprise there. The texture is a little slimy, but I don't care. It just plain tastes good. \\n\\nTurkey: Average. But you can't go wrong with smoked turkey. It's just good no matter what .\\n\\nMac and Cheese: Way below average. Obviously frozen and heated up.

Pretty sure the manager even came by to ask if we needed anything extra or any refills, which I always appreciate the hands on, get your hands dirty management.\\n\\nThe food was good. Could wow me more honestly though. The tacos were a little messy (be they were pretty full and saucy) and I wish they'd gave me a bigger plate for the two tacos I ordered. One small plate wasn't enough. I was impressed by the fried plantains thought! Bigger portion that I thought I would get for under $3--about 6 crispy chunks.

Apparently that translates to 'overcooked, dry, over crispy and cold'.   My dining partner ordered chicken wings which looked over battered (why does anyone batter deep fried wings) and apparently weren't good at all.

I take points away from any restaurant that charges for condiments, especially when I'm paying $15 for a sandwich.

The appetizers were wonderful. The portions on the food are huge. When my order came the eggplant was extremely salty and a little burnt tasting. I ate some of the veal which was good but the eggplant was not really edible. I mentioned it up one server when I said I was done eating. She didn't have much to say so I just boxed it and took it home. As we were finishing up the waiter stood behind us staring us down waiting for us to pay making us feel very uncomfortable.  I have been here a couple times before and I have only had good things to say before. I tell all my friends about this place in fact.

Sooo tacky. Example: the sloppy hand-written \\"use next door\\" sign taped to the glass door that's been torn down and retaped countless times, until it's practically a big smear of paper pulp and tape remnants defacing their door. You know what I mean, right? See it all the time, all over. That's the initial impression some places want to present when you approach their door. Is it just as sloppy and unprofessional inside? Yeah, sort of. It's not hideous, but I didn't like it. Shabby seating, with tears in the upholstery (at least they matched). Some tables had tablecloths, topped with glass, which is an awful awful awful look. Overall, it was nicer when it was a Panda Express. Ouch. \\nSERVICE:\\nWell, it's a buffet, so... The greeting was awkward. It wasn't too hard to figure out you grab a plate at the left and work your way right, and then find a seat, but I was approached and asked (in a very unconfident English) \\"how many\\". Umm...okay, I guess they get you a seat and bevs first. That has the advantage that you don't have to worry about getting through the line and then discovering you don't have a decent seat, so kudos to them for that, but I was taken aback. It would be better if they were to say something like \\"would you like to pick a table before you select your food\\" or something like that. And I felt weird about the busing situation, because there was a discreet bus tub towards a back corner, but no \\"please bus your table\\" sign, so I wasn't quite sure what was expected. \\nOh, hey, I just remembered the website has a menu, so you don't have to do buffet...but they never asked what I wanted, just steered me to the buffet. Hmm, weird.  \\nFOOD:\\nI think my only previous experience with Indian food might be Bollywood Theater, so I can't say if it was authentic. To my American palate, it was pretty good. Not too spicy, but not bland. I did pick up a bit of garlic where it didn't belong, but otherwise I thought the seasoning was fine. I think the people who say it's bland and \\"all the same\\" probably have some preconceived notions of what Indian food should be. If you gave a plate of Namaste food to a typical American who was feeling slightly adventurous and willing to try Indian for the first time, they'd probably like it.  \\nOVERALL: \\nIn spite of all my gripes about this place, the food was satisfying, and when you're eating a cuisine you're not accustomed to, it's nice to have so many dishes you can sample. So overall it was a good experience and I'm glad I tried them. Will I be back? Probably, but honestly that's mainly because the options within walking distance of home are pretty lame.

The menu is already set and is a tasting menu. You can order wine tasting with it or individually. The food we had here was amazing with great flavor. I think one reason for their ability to do this is less customers and more quality control. They have 2 seatings a night and I think the restaurant only holds maybe 25 people. The only bad thing is everyone gets the same thing and there is no substitutions. We had a vegetarian in our party and they were not able to substitute for her. Luckily her husband and I were there to grab the meat products on her plate. Not sure what they do about allergies since no one in out party had any food allergies. \\n\\nThe courses were very flavorful and I seriously could have ordered two meals for myself, but I probably would have had to be rolled out of the restaurant.

Since we did arrive early we planned on heading across the street to their sister restaurant and bar, Expatriate, which had great drinks and a rocking bartender. \\n\\nThis is definitely a fine dining restaurant that you must try if you happen to be in Portland.

After about 2 1/2 hours of skii ball, air hockey and drinks, I went to check on our lane. They said there was 8 people in front of us and that it could be up to 630. I just think that is unacceptable. If you're quoting up to an hour span of time for a wait as it is, then you should make sure that's correct. Otherwise, I would've wanted to hear what they really meant: 2-4 hours and probably not 2 hours. I know that maybe there's nothing they can do about it by that point, but then the manager should have the task of telling customers this news, instead of passing on the responsibility, like she blatantly did. Saw this happen. It was clear we were disgruntled, yet no one tried to make it okay. When we did get a lane after 3 1/2 hours, we had to hurry to make our dinner reservation so played one game only. And of course our lane had technical issues several times and it never seemed to be being addressed with the urgency you would hope. It seems like it could be a fun place, we were having a great time up until the end, just seems poorly managed. Another example of this was When we tried to do skii ball - they were all being used so I asked if I could be out on wait list and was told their was no wait list and we just had to wait until one opened. When one group was leaving, I asked for the balls to go next, to be told - oh actually, there is a wait list.

This was the original location of the nearby Kroger and home to several other good restaurants including Heart of India and The Mediterranean Bakery. The center is behind the McDonald's and right off of I285 - you basically hit the Chamblee-Tucker exit and swing to the west-southwest (the road starts out east-west then bends toward the south to intersect with I85 and beyond). Parking is in the large lot out front.\\n\\nThis Pizzaria is quite near my home so I've experienced it pretty much from inception - the guy who originally owned it now owns another pizzaria - I had heard he opened this one, decided to sell and retire, then got bored and opened another. I learned all this by visiting one night when I was on my own and wanting a couple of slices. This is the closest pizzaria to my Northcrest neighborhood that sells individual slices at all times. The current owner has kept the same interior and pretty much the same ingredients on the pies. \\n\\nThe restaurant is tucked right in the corner of the \\"L\\" shaped shopping center and has put up a banner with some of the offerings. The interior still has the same quaint chefs painted along the walls and was quite busy while I was there - this was around 7:00 PM on a weekday night. New York Pizzaria has an unusually large selection of beer held in two locked cases - your choice for $3.50 - quite reasonable in my opinion. I drank a couple of Torpedo's while enjoying my slices.\\n\\nThe style is very reminiscent of the pizza you find in New York so the restaurant is quite aptly named. I think if anything the ingredients are a bit better with the newer ownership - the sausage previously were the little pellets - now you have quartered slices. The crust was perfect and one of the reasons I like slices so much over individual pies - this is the type of pizza that just works better when reheated with additional ingredients added (my biggest complaint of Felinni's  Pizza - the slices are so much better than the whole pies - the same applies here).\\n\\nWhile I was there I think 3 different groups of neighbors came by - I hadn't realized it was still so popular but I guess I shouldn't have been surprised.

Buffalo chicken pizza is WAYYYYYYY too spicy. They must have chosen an extra hot buffalo sauce because we all (including 2 boys who love spicy food) had trouble eating it. The lasagna pizza was pretty good. Pasta is good for delivery but again nothing special. Mozz knots and garlic knots are the same thing just one has a slab of mozz cheese on top, they are meh too. A little too greasy. Loaded fries are not worth it so don't bother. Its sad cause I like going there and I like the people who have waited on us and I want to like it but usually I just go pick up Mellow instead of paying almost the same price for something thats no where near as good.

Luckily for me, Nando's was just steps away (same plaza as Superstore on Lougheed).  I've had Nando's before at the Metrotown food court and wasn't impressed with how dry and bland it was but my laziness to go elsewhere limited my choices to more boring sushi or exotic, Portuguese peri peri chicken.  \\n\\nI'm mighty glad I gave it another shot.  This location is super clean, all bright and shiny inside with flat screen TVs playing hockey.  Hurrah for other options besides pub food when hockey's on.  A variety of folks were happily chowing down inside, from three-kid families to couples to a bunch of UFC-looking guys sharing laughs over chicken breasts.  On a side note, there seems to be a lot of men in Coquitlam deriving inspiration from the UFC look.

I need to get BH on the wagon ASAP.  \\n\\nThe medium peri-peri half chicken I ordered was \\"flame-grilled\\" to perfection indeed, with the tanginess and spiciness done extremely well. Get it with the medium-spiced garlic sauce if you want to tone it down a bit or the hot sauce if you want to dial it up. Here's another tip: They do sell just the chicken (half or whole, not on the menu for some reason) but it's a better value to order half chicken with the sides.  It was about $10.95 for a half chicken only but it costs only about a dollar more for half chicken and a side.  I wish the cashier had told me that.  Also, an order of whole chicken is pretty expensive, about $17.50 when most groceries sell rotisserie chicken for less than $8.99 usually.

So we get to the counter after a short wait, and being new to the 5 Guys phenomenon, are trying to figure out how to order.  Couldn't you just tell me (verbally or in writing) that the small is one patty and the large is two?  Do the words \\"single' and \\"double\\" not explain better than \\"small\\" and \\"large\\"?  Thinking the small was like a kid's burger, hubby and I each ordered a large, large fries to share, and two drinks.  Set us back 20 bucks.\\n\\nOkay, I'm over the peanuts on the floor already.  If your food's that good, no one needs to pig out on peanuts before eating it.  God forbid you or anyone in your party has a peanut allergy-- guess 5 Guys is off your list.  Also, I felt bad for the poor guy sweeping up the shells..... if we're supposed to throw them on the floor, why are we in a hurry to pick them up?  More confusion.  While waiting for the food, my ears were assaulted in 3 different ways: 1) the worker-lady clearing tables and dragging metal chairs around the floor instead of lifting-- to me, this is like nails on a chalkboard, especially while you're trying to eat/converse.  HATE IT!!!  2) The employees screaming the order #s for pickup, with such volume and urgency that you feel like you'll get in trouble if you don't run up there to get them fast enough, and 3) classic rock (though I like it) blaring through the speakers.  Sometimes a cacophony of noise does not add to the enjoyment of a meal, even fast food.  It just makes me wanna hurry up and eat too fast and get out of there.\\n\\nOkay, the food:  meh is all I have to say.  The fries were pretty good (4 stars), they pile way too many into your plain brown paper bag on top of your order.  (grease spots everywhere, eww)  I guess it represents value to some, but for me, it's just wasteful.  Like we don't overeat enough as it is in America.  Threw about 1/3 of them away.  The burger?  Like a cross between your uncle's on the backyard grill, but with a frying-pan burned-edge effect.  (3.5-4 stars, would have been more if I'd known what I was ordering-- I felt so rushed, I didn't even order onion, and I LOVE onion on my burger)  Definitely thick and juicy, but not the best I've had by any means.  How anyone can compare this place to In-N-Out (there! I said the forbidden phrase) is beyond me.  The 5G burgers IMO are not as good, and I love my 'Light Well' fries at INO.  In-N-Out just feels more sane, organized, less frenetic.  The empIoyees greet you pleasantly instead of yelling at you. Honestly, 5G employees reminded me of the soup Nazi on Seinfeld.  I felt like I was on speed the whole time I was in there.  Also, 20 bucks seemed a little on the pricey side for our meal.  I would expect to pay 15-18, but not 20-- and that's with no sales tax!\\n\\nOne more thing I didn't like:  the GIANT signs plastered all over the windows, with headlines proclaiming how good the food is-- if the food's good, shouldn't it speak for itself without all the hype?  This is just one more turn-off for me.

You'd expect a restaurant like Beast to act professionally, but my friend and I were treated like adolescents--past curfew! \\n\\nBased on the reviews we read, we arrived preparing to have the highlight meal of our trip, only to be greeted by the host like we turned up at the wrong place. She basically asked what we were doing there and if we had reservations. Um, duh? She looked at us like we took up valuable space since there was only one bench for early arrivals. I understood they needed to to prep and we were 10 min. early, but this host and whoever else served us acted suspicious the entire time. People--your restaurant is not that expensive! \\n \\nWhen I declined the wine pairing and requested a glass a la carte, she asked for ID. Common and legal procedure, but she spoke in a derogatory manner making some snide joke about my age. Next to us sat some girl who hardly looked 20 with her sugar daddy (and believe me--he was NOT her daddy) and she was not carded. But fine, they're selective...\\n \\n...as in selectively attentive!! The host, after hesitating to take my wine order, neglected to actually bring me the glass. Tried flagging her down for 10 minutes but she didn't pay attention to me. Without an apology, she finally brings it, and unlike with the other diners, she did not bother asking me for an initial sampling. \\n\\nWhat made matters worse might not relate to the restaurant itself, but definitely exacerbated the general sentiment at this time: Friend and I had to tolerate racist chatter from 2 of their regular patrons. Throughout the meal, we had to listen to them define their non-Asian friend's face as \\"Chinese\\" because \\"You know, her nose is flat\\" and because \\"Her face is flat\\" and because \\"She just looks flat so she's Asian\\" or \\"Japanese\\" or \\"Chinese\\" because of course there's no difference when we're apparently all 2-D! Ladies, do these people look Chinese? Because they are! And there are MILLIONS OF THEM: http://cdn.wn.com/pd/0b/87/809957d9776e537b4aebe248590a_grande.jpg\\n\\nAside from these ignorant women who, by the way, happened to roll their eyes back as they chewed, Beast's food was SUBPAR. And I base this relative judgment on the other highly-starred dining establishments I've been to with similar reputations. It's typical New American and nothing special, which is fine; I understand their \\"all about the ingredients\\" concept but their food just wasn't spectacular especially when the service already left a bad taste in my mouth. Dishes were overly salty and I felt the whole place was just one pretentious show trying to come off \\"real\\" and grounded when it was just a pig wearing lipstick. \\n  \\nThe only thing that stood out was this scoop of foie gras on shortbread topped with champagne gelee. The flavor literally exploded in my mouth and I wish I had mouthfuls more to substitute for the average dishes that made up the rest of the dinner, though that would've made me barf from flavor overload anyway."},{"name":"Swift's Attic","address":"315 Congress Ave, Ste 200","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Love happy hour here!

For dinner this time. Let's say it was so good that I didn't even mind the over-the-limit fee. That's saying something! \\n\\nBut there were a few (literally two) things that made me reconsider my four-star review for my previous trip to brunch.\\n\\nLet me start by saying that Beast isn't about playing it safe (and perhaps more so at dinner). Maybe I'm getting old? Maybe that's why they are getting such great press and the like. For this past experience, 90% of the food was great. Amazing. Different. Rad. But then... there were a couple exceptions. Big ones, I hate to say. \\n\\nFor example, on the 3rd or 4th course, whilst eating clock wise around of plate of delectable little meaty treasures, I find myself gazing at something, well, different. The server explains it's a peanut butter-truffle-pate-with-jellied....blah blah... I hesitate. I look around at everyone else in fear of being uncivilized. I bite. \\n\\nIt was awful! It was like peanut butter liver with plenty of salt.\\n\\nThe following courses were amazing and my taste buds soothed me upon each bite of something new. I put my guard down.\\n\\nThen it struck - chocolate-dipped-bacon. \\n\\nYou know, I'm all about trying new things. But this was two great tastes that should never be together. Salty greasy sweet chewy wrongness. \\n\\nBut I digress, as my dining mate along with a few other people at our communal table seemed to love it.\\n\\nAnyway, net-net, go to Beast*. Just use your nose and judgment when deciding to eat what they put in front of you. Don't feel like you have to try everything - you wont leave unsatisfied even if you skip a few things.\\n\\n*Unless you are vegetarian or vegan.

There is no more filling than the requisite ham, roasted pork, Swiss cheese, pickles, and mustard, but each is of good quality, especially the roasted pork, the element that tends to be dry, was moist and flavorful. The majority of the pleasure I derive from eating a good cuban sandwich is from the bread. The satisfying crunch from a good press is what puts the smile on my face. I heard that the bread here comes from New Orleans. I am not sure if New Orleans categorically makes better bread, but this one is definitely wonderful when pressed. Another thing to note is that this sandwich was pressed flat, the way that cuban sandwiches are supposed to be done in my mind. This seems to be a detail that was consciously thought out, since my friend Debra's pressed turkey sandwich got the press grill marks.\\n\\nI had meant to ask for the broccoli salad, but failed during execution.

So we joined, feeling glad we hadn't left it any later... When they opened, the line moved quickly, and we were seated really fast. Our waitress was really good, very attentive and helpful - we asked for advice on our choices as there are so many amazing options, and she was very helpful. We both went for the Dirty Bird, which was amazing - buttermilk biscuits, with a piece of fried chicken, egg, bacon and sausage gravy. The chicken was incredible - apparently it had been brined for 24hrs then marinated in buttermilk for another 24, and it was so delicious. The whole meal was great, and I don't even know how to begin to describe the sausage gravy... just yum. We also had a Bloody Mary each - the guy at the table next to us said they were the best he'd ever tasted, and while I'm not sure I'd go that far, they were certainly very good!\\n\\nThe atmosphere was great - really buzzing. And the service was very good - attentive but not pushy, and the food came out really fast which was great as we were starving. It's not somewhere to linger over brunch necessarily, but at the same time we didn't feel rushed.\\n\\nThis week, we decided to pop back in on Sunday afternoon for a drink. We arrived about 4pm, and the place was very quiet. Again, the service was great, the barman was very attentive, offering advice when asked but never pushy. We had a few drinks and managed to resist staying for dinner... By the time we left just after 5, it had really started to fill up for dinner.\\n\\nI think this is a great place which really gets everything right - the food is inventive and delicious, the drinks top notch and the prices are reasonable.

Anything less than a fully functional sandwich technique-wise (cooked to temp, seasoning, etc.) and it just opens the doors to a justified list of criticisms. I've gone on and on regarding the merits of high end versus low end and quality when factored into the complete package. When successful, the \\"high end\\" burger is a divine treat; examples being Craigie on Main, Back Bay Social Club and Radius, whereas places such as the former Oak Room, Catalyst and Neptune Oyster fell short. The Butcher Shop, Barbara Lynch's South End restaurant and butcher spot, unfortunately lies in the less accomplished category.\\n\\nSlow to arrive to the table, a towering burger on a sesame seed bun landed in front of me, easily one of the sexiest looking burgers I've seen, adorned with a giant pickle spear pushing its way through the top of the massive burger. Sitting next to the burger was a very generous portion of (gulp) salad, and no fries to be seen. It's not that I don't care for eating a salad, it's just hard to beat a serving of hot fries with any burger. To say I was disappointed with my forced healthy balance of a meal would be an understatement. But my disappointment did not end with the acceptable salad, as the burger, $18 for lunch only, was mostly unremarkable. The first couple of bites gave way to a mildly beefy, unevenly cooked (beyond my ideal medium-rare) patty with a pretty solid juiciness factor. The sharp cheddar cheese dominated early on, and the house-made bacon offered a fruity, sweet and salty undertaking to the burger at hand and was easily the most enjoyable component. Caramelized onions felt rushed and lacked the depth they deserved, not offering much more than a minor textural note. The beef is very loosely packed, more like a Sloppy Joe than a burger, it's almost too loose. It crumbles and has virtually no structural integrity and for $18 you can't help but feel a little cheated.\\n\\nThe bun thankfully is fresh and lightly toasted and it has the ideal chew and tenderness I look for in a bun, but it's disproportionate to the patty, which slips into the great unknown and a miss in the meat-to-bun ratio. The beef is clearly the letdown here; expecting some phenomenal blend of aged meat should not have been a reach, but it's ordinary and just not all that special. A lot to live up to, especially at the hands of (arguably) Boston's most accomplished chef, the Butcher Shop burger ends up being a sort of satisfying yet very expensive lunch and not much more."},{"name":"Southern Kin Cookhouse","address":"500 Assembly Row","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"I had such an amazing time here!!!

It was pathetic. We didn't even finish our beer sampler, which is unheard of. That was dinner - and the very next afternoon, we made it back over for Sunday brunch. Over the two meals, I got a chance to try pretty much all the beers that were on tap, and I came away with a few favorites.\\n\\nThe 5 Points Harvest IPA, brewed with one of my favorite hop varieties, Citra, was phenomenal. This is what a fresh IPA is supposed to taste like - bitter, yes, but also with very bright, citrus-like flavors. No cardboard or oxidation to be found, this was fresh all the way. I had high hopes for the Olde Southern Wit, a witbier - while it was flavorful and floral, it was a bit too perfumed for my taste, like the beer equivalent of an Aviation cocktail. That aspect kinda took away from the witbier's main function as a \\"refreshing\\" beer. \\"Never have I ever,\\" in any setting, marked a beer down for being \\"too flavorful,\\" but I guess there's a first time for everything.\\n\\nOther than the IPA, I thought that one of the best beers brewed here was the Lone Palm Golden Ale. As a beer snob, it's rare for me to think that highly of a plain, easy-drinking blonde ale, but this was one of the best I've tried in a long time. As the menu states, it is crisp and refreshing, with pleasant floral hop character. Very clean, which is an accomplishment - it's tough to hide flaws in a 4.9% ABV blonde. This one will prove to be highly versatile with food; it'll make for many a successful pairing. \\n\\nAlso, don't overlook The Black Eye, a deep, roasty English stout. It looks, and tastes, like a \\"big beer,\\" but at 4.9%, it's truly no \\"heavier\\" than the blonde ale I mentioned above. Don't be a beer racist. The roasted character of this one will pick up on any grilled or otherwise charred item from the menu.\\n\\nSpeaking of which, for the too-full dinner, we ordered grilled lamb heart, and crab-stuffed squid. I thought the lamb heart was great, perfectly cooked to medium rare...though I could see how some would have trouble with the heart's consistency. Since the heart is such a strong muscle, it's chewy. Very lean and tasty, though - I didn't have a textural issue. Crab-stuffed squid with confit lima beans turned out to be the only misstep for me. It's a great idea, but I felt that the crab stuffing was over-salted. \\n\\nBrunch was full of winners, most namely, the \\"Bakeshop on a Board,\\" a sampler of baked goods that netted us light and fluffy beignets, zucchini bread muffins, brioche cinnamon twists, and a couple especially tasty profiteroles boasting raspberry jam and a peanut butter mousse - a perfect, whimsical take on the classic PB&J. \\n\\nChicken and waffles with buttermilk ricotta, maple balsamic and blackberries was fine, though I thought the buttermilk ricotta was the best part of that dish. I felt it needed a little more syrup - I didn't taste much of the maple. Just that little hint of sweetness would have made the dish much better.\\n\\nFried green tomatoes with escabeche vinaigrette and tomato jam were so good, we ended up ordering another portion. This is a sexed-up version of FGT, so don't go in expecting the classic Southern take. I'm not sure what was in that tomato jam, but it was so pure and punchy. Sweet, acidic, some crunch with the perfect golden-fried green tomatoes - this dish just has it. \\n\\nFrench toast with rum raisins, banana and spiced pumpkin was of the \\"light\\" French toast class, not heavy at all. It tasted like fall, but more like a warm-weather autumn; the golden October sun rather than a dense, cloudy, cool November. Some French toasts *are* brunch by themselves, whereas this one is more of a sweet complement to the overall meal. In this case, that's a good thing. \\n\\nFinally, we chose brisket hash for our main savory item. This one gets you perfectly smoked brisket, boiled peanuts, and a fried egg - the resulting mashup is a hearty hash. A solid choice if you want to go in the pure savory direction. \\n\\nI did not get to try any cocktails, but it should be noted that lovers of whiskey and gin cocktails will likely be happy here. Having attested to the Ravenous Pig's cocktails, I'm pretty sure that its sister restaurant is doing a strong job at the bar as well. \\n\\nJust one month in, and this place is a smash hit.

I ordered the half grilled cheese sandwich & cup of tomato soup lunch combo. The tomato soup was delicious but what really knocked me off my feet was the grilled cheese. It was not your average grilled cheese because it contained caramelized onions & goat cheese. It was the perfect size portion & didn't feel too heavy after I ate it.

If you haven't experience Chinese food from this gem, you haven't experienced Chinese food in Canada. \\n\\nIt operates like an authentic Chinese restaurant, plastic cups for tea, sterile beige plastic plates, and some sauces and chopsticks to use at your leisure. The menu is vast and thorough and will pretty much accommodate any diet. \\n\\nWhere to begin...\\n\\nThe beef tendon on lettuce is pretty much my mainstay, go-to appetizer. Not only is tendon exceptionally healthy for you, they stew it to perfection.

A brilliant way to start any meal. \\n\\nNext up - tai chin chicken. Jeeeeeeee-zuz! I don't know who or what tai chin is but s/he or it makes a great stir fry. This is perhaps the best damn sauced Chinese stir fry you will ever eat. You return to it again and again. And each time you think, \\"I recall it being like a black bean based dish\\".

It's only a few dollars more than Willy's or Moe's depending on what you order. We also had a coupon for a free appetizer and decided on the shrimp and lobster dip. It was essentially queso with chunks of shrimp and lobster meat in it. It's not what I was expecting, but it was still tasty. I decided to continue the theme and order the shrimp tacos. They were also good, but I'd filled up so much on chips that I could only finish about half of it. Everyone else seemed happy with their orders as well. It wasn't the best Mexican food I've ever had, but it was fine.\\n\\nThe waitress was more than a little frazzled. She was very sweet, but didn't quite have it together.

I had one foot in the room when I heard somebody yelling \\"NO NO NO STOP NO NO NO!\\" My boyfriend and his parents turned around and started back down the stairs saying \\"okay, okay, we're coming down.\\" To which a woman in a Miami Vice tank top kept saying \\"No, no. I CANNOT let you up here. It's a mess and we're having a private photo shoot. No.\\" First of all, there was no signage telling customers that the upstairs patio was off limits, or a sign saying \\"please do not go upstairs.\\" The way the woman yelled, you would've thought her dog was about to make a mess on the carpet. It was very demeaning and we felt uncomfortable after that. We had no intentions of causing any problems or going into areas we weren't allowed, we just were unaware.

The tour and selection of beers on tap make it reign supreme on the list.\\n\\nThe tour will run you $10, but you get a nice JK glass (Saison stemware!) and 6 half-pours of stellar beer. If you facebook them, they'll post the list of available beers (including guest taps, usually imports), though I've never been really disappointed by what's been on tap there.\\n\\nAbout the tour -- on the ones I've been on, the owner himself conducts it, and he'll run you through the entire process, from start to finish, explaining each step, explaining each room and hardware, explaining all the local and imported ingredients. For me, the tour gave me a deeper appreciation for the art of Jester King beer, it invested me into loving the styles they produce, and I've been as hardcore of a fan as I can possibly be, having been on those tours.\\n\\nMy one gripe about Jester King is that what I taste on tap is typically NOT what I taste out of the bottles I get at HEB or Twin Liquors. Several times I've been quite disappointed -- having fallen in love with an offering on tap at the brewery or whatever bar I'm at, I'll rush out, get a bottle, and it's just not the same. Still good, mind you, but the subtleties and nuances are off just enough to make me sad. That's the ONLY reason why this ain't a 5-star review.\\n\\nBecause it's way out in BFE, Jester King is very much a destination location, and best enjoyed with friends or family who enjoy local craft beer. The upside is once you are there, you can stay for hours, as there's a pizza place out there now, and places to sit in the shade.\\n\\nIf you like craft beers made in Texas, if you especially like Belgian styles as much as I do, you owe it to yourself to make the drive out and experience the tour and the beers on tap directly at the source.

The cuttlefish was tender and fresh, and the duck egg sauce was tangy and savory-- well balanced. I docked a star from my overall review however because the portions are teeny tiny itty bitty and the prices are expensive especially for the tiny amount that you get. We went back to the counter and got a couple more pieces of the roti bread to try to fill ourselves up a bit more and so we could finish scooping up and eating the sauce with it. Also, the harvest salad we got was saturated with way too much dressing. It was dripping. I wouldn't get that again, even though it was a beautiful salad. Or maybe I would get the dressing on the side.

Bratwurst was tender and flavorful, served with mustard (to which I am partial). I ended the meal with an Old Fashioned in the form of a cherry ice cream float in bourbon.

Most of them are from the raw bar (maki, sushi, sashimi) Not many of them are cooked, so don't expect a full Asian experience with rice, chicken, veggies, etc. When we arrived we were told to wait for about 15 minutes, even though half of the place was empty. When the 15 minutes passed the lady comes and tells us we can only sit at the bar because they will close in 30 minutes and there isn't enough time to eat? WTH? Finally we are seated at a table, but discouraged from going for the 'all you can eat' so we try a Bento Box. In general it was good, especially considering the very reasonable price of $10, but I've had MUCH better bento boxes. Something as simple as the Miso soup was lacking TLC, mine was really tiny, had very little seaweed and no tofu whatsoever. Service was not particularly friendly.

We could see several kitchen employees in the back area but only one person in the restaurant and she was doing something behind the bar on the register, we waited again, but she didnt acknowledge us at all.  There was a guy eating at the bar and maybe one table inside.  But what really turned us off, was not just the lack of attention, you shouldn't have to beg to be seated when there are so many other dining options in Decatur.  It was noon so they had been open for 30 mins and there was a bucket of dirty water sitting on the bar, a table covered in tools and another table covered in decorations, as if they were in the middle of a project - shouldnt you do that when the restaurant is closed? I had eaten there before and it was OK but my friend who was there for the first time said lets just leave and I didnt blame her.  Not a great first impression!  It always amazes me that owners spend so much time and money opening a new business and then dont employ enough staff or train them properly.  We ended up eating lunch at the Brick Store and on the walk up the gentlemen who had been waiting in front of us walked past so apparently he gave up too.

I will give her that. But she was super nice friendly and funny.\\nSeemed the kitchen was out of a few items to make some key menu items and drinks.

It was smooth and creamy and, I know this might be a little silly, but I liked how hot it was too. Somehow, that added to the flavor... It wouldn't have struck me as much, I think, if it were lukewarm like soup can be at many other restaurants.\\n\\nThe gnocchi were like little pillows of happiness in my mouth. The portion size was perfect, but oh.. the glutton in me wanted to eat two more portions of it.

It was a very satisfying end to our meal.\\n\\nService was incredibly efficient and professional.

We tried a lot of dim sum, namely, chicken feet, fried shrimp balls, chinese broccoli in oyster sauce, shu mai, and some more. They were all good so we ordered another round.

If I didn't know better I  would have sworn  that I was in Mexico - the juke box blasts Mexican tunes, pinatas hang from the ceiling, the waitresses speak to you in Spanish.  Don't be too worried if you don't speak Spanish as the menus are actually in English so you can just point if you are in a bind.  Apparently they even have mariachis there on weekends.\\n\\nThe salsa that they serve with their chips is delicious. When the waitress set the salsa bowl down on the table, I picked it up and started devouring it. After about 5 minutes, I asked my companion how he liked the salsa.  He said that if I put the bowl down that he'd love to try it.  They make terrific homemade corn and flour tortillas.\\n\\nLos Comales is known for their carne asada (grilled meat) so we ordered the fajitas for two ( $16).   All the different   fajita dishes come with onions, tomatoes, rice, beans, guacamole, sour cream, & pico de gallo.  When the fajitas arrived, the metal platter was really sizzling; if it had been any hotter then it would have ignited.   after our waitress burnt herself on one of the plates, she warned us that the plates were hot too.  And boy were the beef fajitas tasty with a great smoky flavor.\\n\\nThe other time I was there I had the T-bone Los Comales which is served with chorizo (spicy sausage), grilled onions, chiles, rice, and beans. That was great as well.\\n\\nThey have a number of lunch specials for $5.25.\\n\\nThey serve a good margarita as well.

We had to try the dessert, so we ordered the chocolate one, which had a dark chocolate mousse, with chocolate soil (yes and it was delish and added crunch), and blueberry foam. I could have died and gone to heaven, it was perfectly balanced with each element complementing the other. Rarely, have I had mousse that was light as air and not heavy with cream.

Unpretentious and welcoming (unlike some parts of midtown). Walked in on a Friday night with a few friends. The restaurant wasn't super busy. The employees were very friendly. We even joked around with the owner (or manager? not sure). According to some other reviews, he seemed a little too involved in the customer experience, but we found his sassiness refreshing and entertaining, lol. The food, of course, was delicious. I had the tilapia sandwich with fries was full after only a few chomps. Plus, since it was my friend's birthday, the owner/manager-guy gave us dessert for free!! sooooo, nice of him. \\n\\nThe only odd thing about this place is the fact that they don't list their prices on the dinner menu (or at least it wasn't conspicuous). We just ordered, without knowing the price, got our food, ate, and then paid as we were leaving (that's when we were told the prices). Maybe it was just a slow night so they weren't that concerned about us paying upfront? It wasn't shocking,though. The food was definitely reasonably priced for the amount of food you get.

I ordered a cup of lobster bisque and the scampi linguini with, what the menu described as, sea scallops. I have zero issues with the taste of the food, but I've never seen sea scallops so small. They looked more like bay scallops - about the diameter of a quarter, maybe a tiny bit bigger. As for the rest of my party, I didn't hear any complaints about the food.\\n \\nAtmosphere: Wonderful. I love the d√©cor and the music they had playing - it's what I expect from a higher-end seafood restaurant.\\n\\nService: Terrible. We were seated immediately at our reservation time of 8:30pm, and we didn't leave until 10:30pm. One might say that's to be expected with a larger party, but honestly, we could have been out of their by 10pm at the LATEST if service had been even the slightest bit prompt. I sat and watched a table of two sit down and leave between the times of receiving our food (not when we sat down, and not when we put or order in, but when we RECEIVED our food) and the time we walked out of there. Also, throughout the night, I happened to notice that other servers were boxing up their customers' leftovers for them. When I had leftovers, I was given a box to do it myself. This normally isn't a problem, I'm a big girl and can box food appropriately; it's just the fact that it's obviously a restaurant policy that was ignored by our server. After all of this, my husband and I decide that we would not be tipping our customary 15-20%....but wait a minute! We're a party of 8, which means the standard 20% gratuity is tacked onto our bill's total.

There's not much I can say about this place and its product that hasn't already been said, but what impressed me most on my visit was the customer service.

The jar had graham cracker crumble on the bottom, topped with roasted pumpkin, then with a cheesecake flavored whip on top, and pumpkin seen brittle. Simply awesome!

I thought staff were really friendly and if this review was primarily on staff I would give them a 5/5. However this review is based on taste and value. \\n\\nI heard about this place because it was heavily hyped on IG and their photos looked really good. Luckily I really had no wait because I came around 1145. I ordered a chicken sandwich for $12 and was told that at medium there would be a bit of a kick but if I wanted more spice, to order \\"hot\\". I got medium and it was the right amount of spice; side a coleslaw for $3 (this to me was a true rip off). Maybe looks can be deceiving...if you are going to serve coleslaw in a container that looks like a mini soup container and is only half full, superficially, it looks bad. Coleslaw was neither terrible or amazing...it had a nice pickling to it, but for $3 I wish I didn't order this; side of fries (crinkle cut with some seasoning and some kind of mayo type drizzle sauce)-they weren't hot or crispy (they definitely had been sitting out for a bit)...for $4 we got a generous portion but they really shouldn't have been cold...so I brought those home and I'm sure will taste fine when reheated in the oven! I also ordered a single \\"big wing\\" a chicken wing for $3 just so I could try their fried chicken. It was good. But for $32 for a dozen wings, I'd never pay for that. But what I really came for was their touted fried chicken burger. It looked crispy and super flavourful in their IG photos. \\n\\nI recently visited a food truck in downtown who also specializes in a fried chicken burger (not Nashville fried chicken flavour) and really loved it, so my hope was that DL chicken shack would deliver the same way but with a Nashville style kick!\\n\\nInstead, I found the chicken to be super greasy (the breast and wing). It's not appealing when u can see the grease run down your hands and you haven't even taken a bite. I don't know if the color or the chicken should be that dark (it looks as though maybe their fried oil should be changed more regularly). The point is I felt the chicken-both sandwich and wings lacked a bit in seasoning, which you can't do especially if you're paying these kind of prices and didn't have that crunch. I'm happy to pay $12 if you can deliver an amazing tasting fried chicken burger. I was looking for that super crispy batter (it got a little soggy Cos of the oil I think) and more seasoning. Jukes and the frying pan have found that perfect crisp on their chicken sandwich. DL chicken shack hopefully can too. \\n\\nI also had a taste of their cornbread, it was on the house which was nice. Flavour was good but it was too crumbly...I should be able to cut a slice of it without it crumbling all over the place. Lemonade and ice tea aren't made in house just yet...it sounds like they are working on that in the future. \\n\\nI think if I had to wait in line for more then 20 minutes I would have given this place 3 stars. I was really rooting for the place and I do hope it does well cos the people are nice and I appreciate the old school tunes. For now it may be a while until I come back...unfortunately the hype didn't live up to my expectations."},{"name":"Plum Tomatoes Brick Oven Pizza","address":"145 Summit St","city":"Peabody","stars":"4.5","text":"The owner pat is the best guy he's there every day making sure your food it perfect! \\nThe sandwiches are the best around and their pizza is incredibly delicious! !!\\nGet the southwest roast beef sandwich."},{"name":"Little New Orleans Kitchen & Oyster Bar","address":"5840 W Irlo Bronson Memorial Hwy","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"3.5","text":"Well...

The frim fram sauce is a combination of mayo and ketchup and some spices, but it's not hot. The nashville style is supposed to be reallllly hot.

Chicken-a little on the bland side 5.5/10, Chorizo-full flavoured succulent, 8/10. \\n  \\n  If you are anything like me you just can't have Mexican without a bevy. I had an on the rocks lime margarita, it was just okay. They didn't use rock salt on the rim just regular old table salt, and it didn't have that white bit of creamy frothiness on top either. It also did not taste like a double as the alcohol was hardly noticeable. Buuut, I am glad they do have Margaritas and many varieties, (did I mention I LOVE margaritas?) 7/10. \\n\\n  The price was decent as it came to $18.60 for the Marg, 2 tacos, and the small soup.

The Mexican street corn was fine, but my wife is full so I got to finish it. I also got to finish her yucca fries and let's just say that though I agree with the sauce being a strange pairing, I ate my entire meal and still polish them off. The bread that my sandwich came on was a slightly sweet bun, almost like Hawaiian bread, which I love. They had a sweet and a hot barbecue sauce, I preferred the hot, the suite was somewhat lacking.

Sure, Atlanta isn't the first place you'd think of when you're looking for some Mexican food, but, if a city's making it, I'm trying it. So, I was off to Holy Taco. To play off of the name, the decor fits its namesake with paintings and pictures of some crosses, mixed with a bit of a Dia de los Muertos vibe.\\n\\nThey focus on a modern Mexican cuisine with a seasonal and locally influenced menu. I started off with their Organic Margarita, mainly because, I don't think I've technically had an organic margarita, and I've tried many margaritas. So, yeah, it tasted like a regular margarita, but, it was still lovely and refreshing (and yes, I know you can't taste organic).\\n\\nTo start, as an appetizer, I ordered their Ecuadorian Salsa (pureed San Marzano tomato, serrano chile, scallions) and Guacamole (smashed avocado, onion, jalape√±o, tomato, cilantro, lime) with chips. These were both awesome, along with the chips. The salsa had a really nice, fresh flavor with a little kick of heat, and the chips were crisp, perfectly salted, and a little bit on the thicker side, making them excellent little salsa and guac shovels. The guac was great, really fresh as well, excellent texture and just the right amount of spice.\\n\\nThen, I got two tacos, Vegan (black beans, saffron rice, avocado, radish, Ecuadorian salsa) and Fried Mahi Mahi (mexican slaw, chipotle mayo), both on corn tortillas. So, to my surprise, I actually favored the Vegan taco a bit. Wrapped in two tortillas, for extra filling support, this was a really substantial taco. You really can't go wrong with the combination of ingredients here. All the flavors went so well together, and the salsa added some heat to round out the creaminess of the avocado, while the beans and rice added some heft. The fish taco was really nice as well, the fried Mahi Mahi had an excellent crunch, and I really enjoyed the slaw as well. I was maybe just missing a little bit of salt on the fish, just to bring out the flavors a little bit more, but, you can always add it afterward, to your taste and liking."},{"name":"The Tenth Thai Cuisine & Lounge","address":"132 10th St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Excellent Thai restaurant in midtown.

When I walked in to pick up our to-go order there were only two couples dining. It's a small interior but has a nice, clean, open and welcoming feel. The young man was nice and prompt with helping me check out.\\n\\nWe ordered #1, #37, #38, #57:\\n\\n#1 - springs rolls (usually called summer rolls at other places) - these are the rice paper wrapped shrimp and pork rolls served with peanut sauce. The rolls are good but the peanut sauce was thinner and less flavorful than peanut sauce at other places. \\n\\n#37 - pho soup with pork, shrimp, eggs, liver, noodles and other veggies. My husband enjoyed it.\\n\\n#38 - pho soup with pork, shrimp, noodles and other veggies. (Basically #37 without the eggs and liver.) The broth had decent flavor but felt like it was a little greasy/oily - however I liked the fact that it was on the lighter side and didn't seem overly salty. Mixed with all of the meat and veggies it was a nice lunch dish and filled me up.\\n\\n#57 - chicken w/mixed veggies bahn mi sub (I think that's what it was called) - it was a big size for only $3.75! The sub bread was fresh and crisp and the filling had good flavor. Big enough for two people to share as an appetizer or even for someone to eat as their entree.\\n\\nThe prices were pretty inexpensive and I think one person could easily eat well for $10 or less.\\n\\nAs many reviewers have noted they don't have a website. Even a simple website through word press or something could help. Just to have their menu online and come up more in search is a must for business. We had to view the pictures of the menu on Yelp to know what to order for take out. Not everyone will exercise that much effort for take out. Plus, I think the pricing is slightly outdated. Add at least 25 cents or more to many of the prices.\\n\\nOverall though, it was satisfying. While I'm not dying to go back ASAP, I'm sure we will return and try other dishes.

Chicken Guy is the perfect addition to the quick service line-up.\\n\\nThese were some of the best chicken tenders I've ever had. Not too much breading, not too much chicken, perfectly seasoned with just the right amount of crunch. I prefer not to use sauces so I can't speak to them, but these beauties are fine just on their own.\\n\\nThe seasoning on the fries was absolutely amazing. Some of my favorite fries at Springs!\\n\\nThe cost was high for just chicken tenders and fries, but not absurd. It's a cheaper option than most here.\\n\\nWhat's stopping me from leaving 5 stars? The space is way too small, especially compared to other quick options. If waiting outside there's no shade and the sun directly hits you during peak sunshine hours. Once inside, there's barely any seating, so you'll probably have to head back out and hope a table with an umbrella is available. \\n\\nAlso, I know it's a chicken tender restaurant, but the menu was a tad limited. Consider checking before you bring vegetarians. Most places usually have a few more options than they do.\\n\\nThis will be a regular in my Disney Springs dining rotation.

Most sushi places are dinner only affairs and I was doubtful we would find anything that was open. However, after a call out to the Twitterverse, SanSai was suggested. Being a Saturday we decided we were up for the trip across town and were hopeful parking would not be the nightmare it usually is for this part of town. On that account we were wrong. \\nThere were only a few other people at SanSai and we picked our usual seats, at the bar, placed our order and waited for our pot of tea. We had figured that we would end up placing a second order but when our platter, yes, huge platter of sushi arrived, we wondered if in fact we had ordered too much. Looking past the quantity, the quality was average. Nothing scary or bad, but nothing outstanding either. The sashimi we had was eel, tuna and yellowtail (our favorite of the three). Then there were three rolls: Red Bull, Garlic Roll (which was the first time I'd had a roll wrapped with soybean paper) and Marina. None were rolled as tightly as I would prefer and the Marina roll was nearly too huge to fit in my mouth. After all of that I really didn't need any more but couldn't pass up an order of salmon roll, on of my sushi meal favorites.\\nIf you want top quality sushi, this isn't it. But if you have a sushi craving and you're hungry, especially for lunch, SanSai is a good choice. I'd recommend the sashimi sampler which at $18 might sound spendy, but you get three different types of sashimi (your choice or the chef's) and SIX of each. $18 for 18 pieces.

Its essentially breakfast tapas served family style. It's been in the public eye since its opening & I finally woke up with enough time and energy to conquer the inevitable wait. The wait was not nearly as bad as I thought it would be. The fresh rain might've helped. They have self-serve stumptown hair bender blend & decaf for the \\"waiting area.\\" We wandered the cute area to find awesome crafting places I never knew existed. \\n\\nWe were seated facing the kitchen similar to our Toro Bravo visit. The built-in entertainment of the kitchen rush was fun. After several back and forths, we made our choices.\\n\\nFirst came our \\"appetizer\\" of chocolate potato doughnut. It was a fresh doughnut hole in a pool of vanilla creme angalise (think liquid ice cream). It was dusted in cinnamon sugar and it was divine. Somehow it was fluffy and almost creamy in the middle. It made me want 129038 more. \\n\\nNext was the biscuit sandwich with cheddar, fried chicken, and a soft fried egg. The biscuit was much flakier than pine state's. I also liked how it was dark meat chicken which made the whole thing juicer. The yolk dripped, which was perfectly soaked up with the biscuit. Although I love pine state with a passion, I think this was somehow a more grown up version because with each bite you tasted every ingredient vs. just plain messy but gourmet goodness of the reggie deluxe. \\n\\nThen, the moroccan chicken hash came, which the waitress said was a staff favorite. I could see why. Every ingredient was just right. The potatoes were crisy, the veggies (cauliflower, corn, red pepper) were all crispy and fresh, saltiness from the green olives, butteriness from the confit green beans, the chicken was very flavorful and spiced, and the egg pulled it all together. It felt like something you could eat everyday and never get sick of.\\n\\nWe ended the meal with the french toast, which is also a must try. I watched them making it on the griddle and each slice was perfectly browned. It was normal bread, but somehow the batter carmelized on the griddle to make it taste almost like a liege waffle from waffle window. It was surrounded with blackberry maple syrup and topped with fresh whipped cream. Divine!\\n\\nI saw a lot of people get the breakfast board, so I'll have to try that next time.

The only differentiating factor was the Pacific Island 'influence,' which I think influenced the d√©cor more than the food (I admit, the restaurant is much nicer and cleaner than your average Chinese food restaurant).\\n\\nHowever, I'm not a fan of Americanized Chinese food, so I admit my 2 stars may be another Yelper's 3 or 4 stars (my coworkers seem to like it).  Besides, I never got around to reviewing it and I had no intention on going back, so it really didn't matter.\\n\\nThen I stuck my head in during Marc's Scavenger Hunt, in search of a Chinese food takeout menu.  Jen H followed me in, loudly saying, \\"Ooh, ooh, ask them for a fortune cookie!\\"  At that point in time, I expected to get turned away (I was still a little gun shy after dealing with the bitches at Not-So-Sweet 'n' Nasty across the street).  \\n\\nInstead the clerk responded with a big smile, \\"Are you guys on a scavenger hunt?\\"  I admitted we were, and the girl beside him started to giggle as he rushed to get us as many fortune cookies as we wanted.  And a takeout container.  And a tooth pick.  And business card.  I don't think they possibly could have been nicer.\\n\\nAs I walked out, I noticed a sign that announced Island Hopper was serving Dim Sum on Sunday mornings.  Based on my scavenger hunt experience, I may have to try them again after all.

Large skewers of meat keep circling you until you just can't eat anymore.  Go for the rodizio experience (like mostly everyone else) and eat everything in sight.

Standouts were the chicken cheese lasagnae, fresh fruit (their pineapple was excellent), collard greens, and fried plantains. There were definitely a couple disappointments but not bad considering I tried about 15-20 different items. You will not leave hungry, and you will probably eat until you are feeling a little sick (from being so full).  I would say we were offered around 10-12 different meats while here.\\n\\nWe came with a groupon and while service took a bit to get started it was great once we were greeted.  The main server (older man) there was very personable and funny.  The servers carrying around the skewers of meat were helpful and friendly as well.

First of all, I'm not sure what they're going for. I get the whole tapa/small plate menu but what I don't get is why its so expensive. If you are going for small plates/tapas, refer to other high end tapas places for their prices-  Masa in the South End does tapas right.....1 dollar each... should be a sampler menu so you can pick a few to share- this menu ranges from 4 dollars (for nuts...) to 15 or so bucks.. all plates are too small to share and a bit too expensive to get a bunch. \\n\\nThe tuna was FANTASTIC and reasonably priced (8 or 9 bucks) - not spicey though---\\nwe also got the duck which was small and the calamari- calamari was disappointing- although actual squid was FRESH (2 thumbs up!) it was over-battered with no dipping sauce or anything! \\n\\nThe wine list is not cheap- 7.50 for the cheapest glass ... no beers on tap although this could change- the place isnt totally open yet.\\n\\nIf you are looking for a nice pre-dinner drink and snack, im not sure this is the place although that is what they seem to be going for. The music was SO LOUD at 7pm! Who bumps bass at 7pm??? I mean, if you're going to turn this place into a hip bar do it at 10 or 11 after people have had dinner. The music was awful- typical pop/hip hop but the bass was so loud you couldnt actually hear songs. People sitting at the small stool/table thingys were blocking their ears and looked like they were in pain. They need to fix that STAT.\\n\\nThe decor is definitely very cool- MUCH improved from Jury ROom.... the bar is comfy and nice but the small tables with little footstools look uncomfortable and there is no back or anything- just one couch the rest these little stools... perhaps they need a few more couches so the stools can go on the other side- looks very awkward for big guys to be crouching over these little tables... Lounges are meant to be comfy not awkward!\\n\\nOverall I'd like to see this place improve after their grand opening.

What I like is the slightly different spin they put on breakfast stuff (yeah, I need to get in for dinner also, that's when I can make a toast at Toast, perhaps).  They feature a shortish menu that covers the spectrum of meat to vegetarian, though I tend to hover on the meaty side....in fact, I almost always opt for the side order of delicious pork belly (though I think if they put a bit of a cure on that belly, say a day or two in a salt/sugar mixture, it would make it shine even more than the belly makes my coat shine).  I think they make all or most of the bakery items, including the bread for the toast. Yes? \\n\\nThe oft-mentioned potato rosti is a nice touch and a nice change from the usual hash browns/home fries starch option.  The housemade sausage is great, but not sure they still offer that. And that onion tart with the poached eggs and hollandaise...the so-called Occasional Hedonist (as if I were just an occasional one...???).....is really a home run. Now, if they would only restore their version of the eggs benedict, I would be a very happy camper. Dudes, what happened to the EB? You still have all the components, I'm sure....\\n\\nThose bloody marys, by the way, were really top-notch, but the last visit included a cup of the Courier coffee which I thought was a bit on the burnt side...since I've been roasting my own beans much lighter for the last year or so, I've become a bit more aware when roasters go a bit over the French roast mark which features more charcoal flavor than coffee bean...just my two beans about that...\\n\\nIf you don't want to stand in line for mediocre chow as so many do all over town (i won't mention any names), give Toast a try....you should be delighted by the experience.

My party of 4 was seated at a large wooden table that we shared with 8 others. Tasty and Sons is like a warm-hearted Christmas dinner with everyone eating together. \\n\\nProduct/Prices: They offer a small but very unique, atypical brunch menu that is broken up into two categories - smaller plates & bigger plates. The dishes are meant to be shared. I went with 3 others and we shared: 1) Open Faced Monte Cristo with spiced maple $6 - sandwich sits in a pool of spiced maple. A bit sweet for my liking but still delicious. 2) Potatoes Bravas with over easy eggs $7 - one of my favorite dishes. Served in a cast iron skillet - food tastes better when served in a cast iron skillet! The egg was cooked to perfection and the yolk was still runny enough to coat the potatoes beneath them. Sigh. 3) Steak & Eggs with cornmeal pancake & jalape√±o butter $11 - another memorable selection. Served in a cast iron skillet. Four cubes of thick steak that are perfectly marinated and cooked next to scrambled eggs sit atop a thin cornbread-like pancake. All the flavors went together splendidly. 4) Croque Madame with sunny side up eggs $10 - This is a bit disappointing. Just a simple, mild flavored sandwiched topped with an egg. I felt like I could've made it at home. 5) Polenta & Sausage Ragu with mozzarella & fried egg $8 - This dish was forgettable. A bit to \\"mushy\\" for my liking. They also offer a drink menu with beers, cocktails, and such. We ordered two mimosas, a whisky mixed drink, and a bloody mary.\\n\\nBottom line: Unique and flavorful brunch dishes. Family-style. Left satisfied and still discussing the creative menu.\\n\\nService: We waited about an hour for a table for 4 during brunch hour on a weekend - worth the wait.

Overall, we had a good experience. This place seemed more 'bar' than 'restaurant', at least on a Saturday evening. The atmosphere and other patrons weren't preferable. I was hoping for something a little less rowdy. The other patrons were redneck and biker types and were very loud. They had a live musician playing which would have been nice if it wasn't so incredibly loud. The volume of the microphone/speakers was deafening, we couldn't even hear our server nor could she hear us. We were also seated next to the musician which made it worse, however, the establishment is a small size and the volume would have been deafening anywhere inside. My husband asked if we could be relocated to a table outside and the server very kindly moved us without incident. \\n\\nI was underwhelmed by the menu. It took me forever to find something I actually wanted to eat. It was all BBQ and sandwiches, more of a lunch-style menu. Honestly, from the name \\"bar and grill\\" I thought that there'd be more styles of food offered, but it was only BBQ and BBQ-esque sandwiches. I think they should update their name that way it's obvious this is strictly a BBQ joint. The appetizers and side dishes offered were equally underwhelming and unattractive. BBQ nachos? If it's a bar why not just normal nachos? Who wants tortilla chips topped with BBQ sauce? Is that a thing?\\n\\nAnyhow, my husband and I both settled on the prime rib. I thought it was a fair size for the price ($12.99) and it lasted me for two meals. The side dishes were a bit small. We both had macaroni and cheese and grilled veggies. I wished for mashed potatoes and steamed vegetables, but neither were offered on the menu. The grilled veggies weren't that appetizing as the smoky, grilled flavor overpowered the taste of the actual vegetables. I'm one of those people who likes to taste the flavor of my vegetables rather than masking it with other flavors. The macaroni was a nice southern-style mac that was reminiscent of a grandmother's recipe, which I enjoyed.

After letting the rush of the new restaurant die down, we decided to check it out. From the start this was a negative experience. We sat outside at the bar and while three people asked if anyone had been by to help us, no one did after we said no. We finally got a bartender about ten minutes later, which would have been okay if it was busy, but it was not at all.\\n\\nWe decided to try our luck inside. We went in and after another wait, my husband finally got a chance to order his beverage. We proceeded to order nachos but wait on the rest of the order until we got them. It took at least thirty minutes to get them. Someone did come by and apologize, but again, it was not crowded so I did not see the reason for the delay. In the meantime I overheard a server say she did not want to check the status earlier because they give her \\"death stares.\\"\\n\\nSince we really did not have a ton of time to go somewhere else as it was getting late, we decided to order dinner. While we waited, all we heard was chaos of lost drink tickets, not knowing where the refills of printer paper were and gossip. Overall, I think the dinner was okay. I got the jerk chicken pasta but I do not remember it being as dull as it seemed to be today. My husband ordered the seafood paella and it was the same reaction from him.\\n\\nWe ended up cashing out at $100. I feel like it was not worth the time or money being there.  I don't mind spending the money, but I really expect at least good service when I do. I am really disappointed. I was hoping a month or so would give them enough time to adjust.

As far as I know,  this place recently opened as there was a Peruvian restaurant in the same space for some time.   Firstly,  you should know that they do not yet even have a beer/wine license so if you are looking for a pre-dinner drink or wine with dinner,  forget it unless you bring your own.   Now on to the food & service.  Ordered guacamole as an appetizer.   Not at all good.   Very bland and not prepared table-side.  Had to add salt.   Did not come with sliced limes on the side either.  Then had carne asada as the main course.   Unlike the guacamole,  beautifully seasoned and prepared.   Also quite a nice sized steak and well worth the price of $10.99.   HOWEVER - as I am on a mostly gluten-free diet,  I asked if I could substitute French fries for the tortillas that come with the steak.   They said they'd have to charge me $1.99 extra for a small order.   I mean,  Really???!!   It's not as if I was asking to substitute a meat dish or even green vegetables for the tortillas.   I paid the extra $1.99 and then told them to leave the tortillas off my plate.    To their credit,  when they asked how I had enjoyed the food,  I told them that the guacamole was not great.   They took the charge for the French fries off the bill because the waiter said the owner did not want me to pay extra if I didn't enjoy the guacamole.   Strange,  since it was the guac I didn't like,  not the French fries.   But,  whatever.....it was a nice gesture just the same.    I would go back to La Fiesta but honestly,  this place has a long way to go in order to compete with,  for example,  Garibaldi's which is close by and has far superior food and service.

We were at the large community table near the front with 5 other parties, plus probably another 5 parties at the long bar in front of our table along the front of the restaurant.\\n\\nWe ordered a handful of dishes and got the first one within a few minutes. However, we then watched all ~10 parties around us receive their dishes, one by one, the next in well-timed succession as replacement for the last while everyone smiled and ate. Unfortunately for us though, we sat for ~25 minutes waiting for the next major dish, receiving nothing except a tiny order of 2 dates we had requested (which took 20 seconds to eat). I'm not sure if you have experienced something like this, but waiting 25 minutes in between courses kills your appetite and causes you to lose interest in eating. It's also extremely frustrating to watch almost a dozen parties around you get their food delivered plate after plate and eat happily while you stare at your watch.\\n\\nFinally after 25 minutes we received the next dish, but then received our remaining dishes just a minute later (and they weren't dishes you would want to mix together, but eat one after the other), so the food sat and got cold while we tried to eat the dish we had waited so long for. In addition, we had somewhere to be, so we had to rush through the food to get out of there, so we couldn't enjoy it.\\n\\nDuring all of this, nobody said anything to reassure us our food was coming until we complained, and then the waiter said he would check, but that didn't seem to make a difference.\\n\\nWhen we first sat down, the waiter told us the restaurant is a bit non-traditional and that plates are meant to be shared, and things come out as they're ready, not simultaneously.

The pates came with various breads on which to spread them - including an Irish Soda Bread that tasted amazing with just a simple slathering of their creamy, salted butter and a drizzle of the local grower's honey that was brought to our table...who knew such a simple combo could taste so damn good?

For example, early Tuesday night when there were empty tables, we saw our waitron at approximate 30-minute intervals.  Why?  Was she snuggled around the corner and compulsively texting?  Hiding out back smoking meth?  She had ONE table to tend to!  A meat dish that was ordered medium was delivered very well done.  The to-go containers had big pieces of broken white plastic in the bottom.  And worst of all, a pumpkin raviolo was thrown into the container with salad and oil and vinegar dressing.  Why?  Was someone in a hurry to go home?  More than likely, too lazy to perform correctly, as though it would make a difference when the work day was done.  These are highlights of the negative dining experience, not nearly all that was lacking in service and product.\\n\\nRIP, Rino's. We knew you when.  After this week's visit, and a similar, but not quite as bad, previous visit, we will not be back.  One would think with all the hype and press, that the service as well as food preparation and care would be top-notch.  To the contrary, it was abysmal.

They texted us back within about 5 minutes letting us know our table was ready. I got the raspberry lemonade bourbon drink which was amazing and my boyfriend got a glass of pint noir. For apps we got the Bayou tacos which were delicious! However they are extremely small! Like I'm talking 1 to 2 bites max small. We also got the Mac and cheese which was creamy with a nice cracker top. For our main dish we split the chicken and waffles. I was very impressed when they came out and the chef had split our order on 2 separate plates and presented them beautifully with a couple different options of syrups to put on them.

Tonight my husband and I came here for his birthday dinner.  It's a cute place with somewhat confusing decor.  Kind of beach house versus country-cozy eclectic.  We were given a booth just two down from the entrance.  Almost immediately, we heard some kind of generator kick on and then the floor under our feet started vibrating. It was weird. When the waitress came by we asked her what that was.  She said she would check. We were suprised she had never noticed this before.  When she returned she told us that the noise and vibration were coming from the restaurant's walk-in refrigerator below.  Apparently the refrigerator generator kicks on periodically.  This noise, vibration and thrum went on and off throughout our dinner and it was a bit annoying.\\nWhat I will tell you about the booths that line either side of this narrow restautant, is that the seats are very shallow. I weigh about 115 pounds and I barely had enough room on the bench to sit on. The booths are not comfortable in the least, from the high, hard backboard to those narrow benches!  You feel like you are being ordered to sit perched and at full attention at all times!  This was especially hard for my 6'3\\" husband.\\nOur waitress was very helpful and sweet . She introduced herself and took our drink orders prompty.  Wine for me, vodka tonic for the birthday husband. There was only one pinot grigio choice by the glass.. It was a Sicilian pinot grigio; odd I thought for a restaurant that claims to be Northern Italian.  It was a nice, dry pinot though and I had two glasses.    Bread and olive oil brought out to us.  Good.\\nWe ordered two appetizers: Fried oysters and a prosciutto something or other.  I didn't try the proscuitto.  Husband thought the prosciutto was okay but found it was somewhat overwhelmed by the shaved cheese and balsamic vinegar on top. He felt the flavor and delicacy of the prosciutto was lost.  The oysters were a disappointment.  They were two lonely-looking fried oysters on a plate without the shell.  If I hadn't ordered them myself, I wouldn't have known what they were. I ate one and found it completely uninteresting. There was nothing at all to exclaim about and there was no oyster taste apparent.  Husband ordered the free-form ravioli with scallops, shrimp, fennel, and onion finished with a sambuca cream. He loved his dish and devoured every bit.  As it was his birthday, I was thrilled that he really enjoyed his meal.  I ordered the cavatelli with broccoli, pine nuts, golden raisins, romano cheese and garlic. It was swimming in a sea of too much olive oil and tasted primarily of garlic.   This should have been a really flavorful dish but for success the chef needed to demonstrate a more subtle hand. \\nSadly for me, there was nothing amazing or transformative about the dish.  Isn't that why we go out to eat most of the time and certainly for a special occasion?  We want to be impressed and bowled over with deliciousness. This didn't happen for me.  I could have made my dish at home and I think would have done a better job.\\nWe decided to skip dessert and go elsewhere for that.  But very unexpectedly, the waitress brought out a lovely piece of dense, flourless chocolate cake with berries and cream and said it was on the house for hubby's birthday.  I had mentioned in my emailed reservation request that it was my husband's birthday and this was a nice touch.  The cake was very rich (so perfect to share) and quite good and we were touched by this thoughtful gesture. We did have a  nice night but based on other reviews I was hoping for a better overall experience and more wow factor.  Maybe I was just cranky because of the awful booth seating."},{"name":"Uwajimaya","address":"10500 SW Beaverton Hillsdale Hwy","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"This place is quite a bit of a drive for me since I live in southeast.

Upon entering from their side entrance (garage door type) I proceeded to walk up to the middle of the counter. There was 5 TOTAL employees working but only one of them was helping a couple ring up their food. The other four were moving around the store but making no eye contact with me (6'4 BLACK MALE)ÔøΩ? I step-BACK from the counter to look over the menu and to as well let a couple who came in shortly AFTER me get helped for their order. Perfectly fine, they get attention and proceed to get helped. I then stand as close by to where they had been approached to get helped, make myself noticeable i.e looking for eye contact with a employee but still nothing happens. This goes for what has to be 3 STRONG minutes until a women then walks in, proceeds to step a few steps away from me... SURPRISE she gets helped (5'3 white woman)... I then IMMEDIATELY receive eye contact from a employee as she had saw the whole situation. I smirk then turn my back to walk away. Waiting for a \\"hey SIR, I'm sorry\\" I received nothing. Walking back to work I'm upset. I decide to call and voice my displeasure.

The Matzo Ball soup is great and even gives some North Eastern delis a run for their money. Here's my recommended picks off the extensive menu:\\n\\nBreakfast - The cheese blintzes and the potato pancakes are as good as you will find in Central Florida. Yum!\\n\\nLunch - I love the 3 salad platter. I go with the Dijon Chicken Salad, Egg Salad and Shrimp Salad. This combination is not what's listed on the menu, but just ask and they will give you whatever you want. The previously mentioned Matzo Ball Soup is a good light lunch or a perfect match with a garden salad. \\n\\nWhat's a deli without a great sandwich, right? The Rachel is a Pastrami version of a Reuben and is delicious though its virtually impossible to finish this meat loaded beast. For added decadence add a \\"shmear\\" of Chopped Liver!! Your bubbie would approve.\\n\\nDinner - I love the stuffed cabbage, the lasagna and my favorite comfort pick, Shepard's Pie.\\n\\nDesert? I don't think they have a bad one. All of them are large enough to share with a two or three friends and all of them will blow your mind then leave you in a sugar coma. \\n\\nMy pick you ask?

This instantly jumped to near the top of my list.\\n\\nFirst off, the space is stellar.  Upstairs, you've got the bakery, and descending the steps, you find yourself into a spacious, relaxing pub.  As if that weren't enough, they've also got a great outdoor space overlooking a lovely creek that flows under 6th street.  On a weekday night, this is the perfect place to unwind, with more than enough space to accommodate anyone weary from a long day of school or work.\\n\\nAnd I haven't even gotten to the food yet.\\n\\nAll the food here I've seen and tried have been excellent.  The mixed plates can be pricy, but delicious.  I had the grill plate with steak, pork tenderloin, and some sausage - absolutely fantastic.  All the meat was perfectly - perfectly cooked.  The pork tenderloin was just the faintest pink, and the steak was brilliantly juicy and tender, paired well with a great chimichurri sauce.  \\n\\nThen there's the bread - oh the bread.  If Easy Tiger didn't have such delicious meat, I'd just gorge on the pretzels.  You certainly can't go wrong with one of those pretzels paired with the beer cheese (most probably the best thing ever.  period.).\\n\\nEasy Tiger has without a doubt clawed its way into my heart.  I'll be back!"},{"name":"Easy Tiger","address":"709 E 6th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"The bakery at Easy Tiger is one of, if not the, best in town.

The 3 stars are for the staff, who were friendly and were really trying to do a good job, and the food, which was absolutely outstanding.  \\n\\nI feel compelled to write this review because I think it's important for people to realize that they shouldn't go here if they are holding theater tickets and may have a time constraint.

While we waited for the food, we were not acknowledged by any staff member that our food was on its' way, or that they were sorry it was taking so long.  \\n\\nI want to emphasize to any staff member or management reading this that telling my personal experience while visiting this establishment with honestly, is not slander.   Feedback through online reviews is important for a business to see what their weaknesses are in order to keep them honest, and also make the changes that are necessary to improve and create a better customer experience.  \\n\\nTo the Chef--it is not a complimentary meal that I was looking for by writing the previous review, but an apology, which I still have not received.

The torta was made with what looked like an 8-inch hoagie roll, which is not what I'm used to but worked fine. The chicharr√≥n was also not what I was used to - it was soft as opposed to crunchy and tough-ish - but it had great flavor. What I really loved about the torta was that it was chock full of avocado slices. El Pueblo definitely does not skimp on that. The two hot sauces they brought out were pretty good as well - they gave us some small to-go container for both of them. The burrito was huge and slathered with sour cream - and, also, full of avocados. On our way out, we ordered a small to-go cup of horchata, which is essentially cinnamon rice pudding in drink form.\\n\\nThe icing on the cake was that our dinner and drinks only cost $12.

The brisket was very well done and tender - I think I got a piece of the point because of the amount of fat I received. I felt, though, that I received more fat than meat, which was a slight disappointment. Still, it had great smoke flavor and amazing tenderness (believe me; I know brisket is difficult to get right).\\n\\nI felt the pulled pork and sausage didn't have as much flavor and was just there on the sandwich. The slaw topping was a nice addition, but I can't say I tasted very much of the \\"citrus peanut\\" flavor as listed on the menu.\\n\\nThe bun is listed as a \\"toasted coconut pineapple roll\\" on the menu, but I don't recall any of that flavor being present.\\n\\nI had the spicy barbecue sauce on the side but I can't really say it's spicy at all. It's a thicker sauce, so if you're into that, you'll like it. I, unfortunately, did not feel the sauce added much to the sandwich at all.\\n\\nThe rice and beans were fairly standard, but I will give a huge complement that they were seasoned. Very often a lot of places just mix rice and beans together with nothing else, but Pig Floyd's gets big credit for making them more flavorful.\\n\\nService here is excellent. I like how the entire staff is checking on the whole place, and how quickly the food was served, though that makes me question the food itself based on how fast it was.\\n\\nOverall, there are some good things going on here but I'm not sure it lived up to all the hype.

I originally withheld from writing a review because I figured it may have just been an off-night. Instead, I wrote a thoughtful email and sent it through the feedback page on the restaurant's website. No one from the restaurant ever apologized or even responded to me, which was perhaps equally disappointing to the negative experience at the restaurant. Given the prices, I really expected more. \\n\\nWe arrived at the restaurant and were seated in a timely manner. Our waiter came to tell us about the menu and provided helpful explanations. He came back a second time to take our order but we weren't ready yet. I regretted turning him away, because then he did not return for a very long time, probably 15-20 minutes. We only needed a minute or two to make up our minds. \\n\\nIt took a long time for our appetizers to arrive (20+ minutes) and an even longer time for our main course to arrive after the appetizers were cleared away (30+ minutes). We ordered the special Ribeye which was over $60 - definitely a splurge but we thought it would be worth it. Unfortunately when it finally arrived it was not hot and the meat was tough. It was difficult to cut through the meat with sharp steak knives, even though we ordered it medium.\\n\\nOur waiter's shifted must have ended during our dinner, because someone different brought us our main course and began waiting on us after that point. Maybe there was a miscommunication and our entree was left standing in the kitchen and became cold.\\n\\nUltimately this restaurant was off the mark on almost everything - service, food, and price.

We arrived at 6:30 on a Saturday evening, and I was surprised it was so crowded (only because I thought it was early for a Saturday dinner...).  There was standing room only, so we hung out by the jukebox.  The others at the bar seemed hip and trendy, and I was starting to feel out of place in my jeans and Birkenstock clogs next to the stylish woman in her cute red skirt and red patent leather heels... until I noticed that the dining toom was full of families with children, elderly couples, and generally all sorts of patrons with varied clothing tastes.  I also came to the conclusion that these must be our neighbors since there's no parking, and surely no one would walk from Davis in those heels!   \\n\\nA 45-minute wait and one frou-frou cocktail later (yummy Bloodhound, by the way), we were seated.  We ordered a couple of appetizers: calamari and the chicken wings.  The calamari had a nice breading (like a coarse cornmeal... or maybe semolina?), and the smoked tomato dipping sauce added a nice touch, making the dish a little less New England and a little more \\"down home\\" (I am from Texas; this is a good thing).  The chicken wings were coated in hoisin sauce and sesame seeds, served with sliced scallions and kimchi - delicious!\\n\\nFor an entree, I settled on the Cuban Reuben, with definite plans to taste the meals of my companions as well.  My sandwich was perfectly pressed, with just the right balance of cheese, meat, and pickled stuff.  The fries were equally tasty.  My husband's pork shoulder was tender and juicy, and the grits and greens were great.  Our friend got the fish and chips, and I thought the beer batter was fantastic; the tartar sauce was possibly the best I've ever had.\\n\\nI ate half of my sandwich and, feeling full, decided to take the other half home.  My husband took another bite of the half that was left, and seeing how much he enjoyed it convinced me to take yet another bite.  At that point it was just a mangled third of a sandwich that I thought wasn't worth bringing home anymore... but then I couldn't just WASTE it so I kept nibbling away at it until I was nearly sick.  Sigh... this is why I've spent my life *imagining* what it would be like to be thin.\\n\\nNeedless to say, we left no room for dessert.  The banana bread pudding will have to wait until next time.

It was in fact, already open.  Apparently only a handful of people were aware of this because I was able to walk in to a half-empty restaurant and was seated immediately.\\n\\nService was a little slow at the get-go.  It took a while to receive a menu and then significantly longer to get my drink.  Things were not off to an altogether great start.  They have a standard typed menu as well as a handwritten single page menu which lists the current specials.  I decided on the Arancini for an appetizer with the gnocchi as my entree.\\n\\nThe salad arrived first and it was drowning in the house vinagrette.  I picked on the greens at the top of the plate and left the bottom-dwellers.  Along with the salad, they delivered a bread basket.  The bread was your run of the mill italian bread, served at room temperature.  The arancini arrived fairly quickly (half-order is $5.00).  The presentation was nice with the two rice balls placed on a rectangular plate, surrounded by their ultra-tasty plum tomato sauce.  These bad boys were tasty.  Steaming hot and full of flavor.\\n\\nThe gnocchi arrive approximately 15 minutes later.  The bowl was enormous. And it was filled with gnocchi, bathed in a bath of tomato sauce and mozzarella.  The taste was terrific.  Very flavorful and rich.  I managed to eat about a third of the dish and took the rest home.  \\n\\nBy the time I left at 5:00, there was a waiting list to get into the small 50-seat restaurant.  Will I come back again?

Perhaps you meet that lover months or years down the road and it seems they've changed....a bit hesitant, you throw caution to the wind for another essay, and thank your lucky stars...Lackluster has become explosive, hum drum is now mmmhmmm. \\n\\nMerci, Elephant Hut, for being my culinary parallel to the above scenario!  I was excited to see the (significantly) expanded menu, and the clear offerings for vegetarian options on most dishes.  Sampling the Summer Rolls, the Crimson Noodles, and the Green Ultimate Curry, subtly nuanced flavors peeked through waves of heat  (rendered by a smooth chili reduction instead of chewy chili flakes - hooray!), and the assorted veggie accompaniment was much more varied than in the past.  While I gave four stars instead of 5 because their tofu could use a bit more work (a bit bitter), it is miles above their first offerings.  \\n\\nService was spot on, decor interesting and unique per my initial review - seems to be aging well and still feels very clean.\\n\\nPerhaps the experience was underscored by the pointed contrast with my first experiences; nonetheless, I can happily say that this has potentially usurped my favorite Thai spot in Boulder.   \\n\\nSo, in conclusion, I left with some leftovers (portion size seemed great to me), that certain glow of a good (food) session, and a reminder that it's not a bad thing to try, try again."},{"name":"Pho Dalat 3","address":"2904 E 4th Plain Blvd","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Pho Dalat #3, you have won my heart.

We had always had a good experience here.  Unfortunately this location has changed quite a bit and not for the better.  \\n\\nIt seemed ok the first couple of times back but I started to notice issues.  For one, the line was long no matter what time of day I came by.  You would think that was a positive indictor.  The problem was that the line was moving but very slowly.  I used to always be amazed at how fast this place would be able to handle large crowds of customers and still do a good job.\\n\\nAnother issue is that there is a weird funky smell.  At first I assumed it was someone in the line with BO but I noticed the same odor every time I went back.  The only thing this does is make me worry about how clean this place is.  Considering the recent issues Chipotle has faced, that makes me very concerned.\\n\\nFinally, and I have heard this complaint from several other people, the chicken was overly spicy.  I usually get the carnitas but the rest of my family gets the chicken as it is supposed to be one of the least spicy things on the menu.  Not so anymore (at least at this location).  In fact it seemed to get hotter every time we went there. \\n\\nI used to have a lot of loyalty to this location.

About 8 people got their food out the first round while the rest of us just sat and watched them all eat. About the time that they were done, the remaining food came out.

This is for the following reasons:\\n\\n1.) Mason jar of booze. A lot of folks on Yelp complain that this place is snobby and the bartenders have attitude. No one is snobby after you've ingested a mason jar of booze. Be grateful to the heavy hand the poured this potion, as you likely won't need to see him a second time that evening, unless you really want to see if the Legacy Emmanuel Emergency Room is as awful as everyone says it is. At worst you confess too much to a perfect stranger about your brief stint in a rehabilitation facility and how that factored into your understanding of how your mother never loved you, and you're pretty sure that if you could just find the right person you'd feel free to finish your scrapbook of scrapbooks. This is a risky beverage. Don't go with someone who won't forgive you the next day. \\n\\n2.) The best patio in the southeast. Warm, clean, and expansive tables to host each member of my obnoxious cast. It could also seem kinda romantic, if no one falls into you. And flirty! I've found Portland to be a shy place in terms of flirtation, but not here. Perhaps item #1 on this list has something to do with it...\\n\\n3.) Vegans! I'm not vegan, and never will be, but since they're generally vitamin b12 deficient and weaker, in event of an earthquake or other apocalyptic disaster they'll be easy to push out of the way. The Zupan's right across the street will be an excellent option for immediate looting. \\n\\nMy one complaint is that their \\"absinthe\\" drinks are really just a spritzer of absinthe, which is an insult to absinthe everywhere.

In the summer, the tomato and watermelon salad rules.  Fried Chicken night was what we had before my Tuesday night wedding believe it or not with the family...Last time I ran the Boston Marathon, we went here before raceday because I knew I'd get good, homey, quality food.  This is our home away from home:  We also took our relatives from Europe here when they wanted to go to some low-key local venue.

Where Tasty n' Sons has me is uniqueness/my own culinary limitations: I've yet to whip up my own shakshuka, and after trying theirs, I'm afraid I'm going to need to put that in my face fortnightly, at least. And I think the chocolate potato donut has probably gotten enough play, but yeah: it's damn good.\\n\\nTheir dinner is great, too - and their small \\"breakfast for dinner\\" menu includes the shakshuka. Otherwise, they've designed a thoughtful but fun menu, neither too small nor to large, with a good variety of small plates, higher end entrees & more accessible comfort foods (both price & familiarity-wise), which makes it a great place for a family dinner.  And those old standbys are no slouches: I'd probably never have thought to order their cheesesteak or cobb salad, but my parents did & believe me, you want them.  And if you like radicchio salad, please, please try their version: Nostrana's has been my standard bearer for years, and I might like this one better.\\n\\nDrinks are creative & solidly tasty, though dare I say that's just pretty much a baseline requirement in Portland anymore. \\n\\nOne small \\"know before you go\\"-type caveat: Tasty adheres to Toro Bravo's tapas-style service, which is to say, things come out as they're ready, in no particular order. I love a good small plates meal, but with the number of composed entrees they offer, I have to imagine there's a goodly amount of non-sharesies ordering, in which case the random food appearances just get annoying. \\n\\nIf you can deal with that one caveat, though, Tasty n' Sons definitely deserves a go - they'll be staying on my regular rotation."},{"name":"Salt & Straw","address":"2035 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I live right by Salt & Straw located right in the heart of Alberta, and I must say that it is a blessing and a curse. A blessing because I have an awesome ice cream shop that's just a few short blocks away from my house, and a curse because ice cream. Also, because it's so dang popular!  Whether you're from Portland or just visiting, Salt & Straw is a staple of the cities food scene and rightfully so!  They have a wide selection of flavors on the menu to choose from. Their flavors consist anywhere from basic Vanilla to weird flavors like Dill Pickle, Honey Lavender and Pear & Blue Cheese.  Nonetheless, there is sure to be a flavor here that suits your taste buds.  Also, the waffle cones are a must!  They are handmade and made fresh right in front of your eyes and are bound to make you salivate while you're waiting in those long lines. Oh yeah, did I mention the line to get into Salt & Straw can be RIDICULOUS?!  But that's because Salt & Straw is that ridiculously good!  As you finally approach the inside of the cream parlor the friendly staff gives you the option to warm up your pallet by trying the many flavors before you order.  \\n\\nEven though I'm not a huge lover of ice cream, I'm always pleased whenever I visit here.

The pudding is very creamy and the best part is, either they deep fried the banana or put some crunchy thing with the banana.  It tastes super good!

My wife had just received her first speeding ticket after 12 years of driving (welcome to the world, dear), and it was my night to cook (didn't feel like it), so I took her out to cheer her up.  So nice of me! It is what it is.  Downtown surburban people-watching while sipping down a bottle of wine. The restaurant itself is nice.  With that said, I'll enjoy anywhere with a patio so that I can enjoy the breeze and the sunset.  The waitstaff has always been extremely pleasant and helpful when we visit. In fact, they were easily able to accomodate a change in our reservation when we needed to move outside due to unforeseen reasons (a psychotic coworker who conveniently showed up and circled our pre-dinner Starbucks twice, proceeded to make out in front of our window and then continue on toward Mezzo.  This made for a completely interesting night...but I digress).\\n\\nThe food is ok.  Not terrific, but certainly not terrible.  Completely typical of the downtown Dublin \\"strip,\\" both in price and quality.  There is certainly something on the menu that you will find that you would want to order again.  Unfortunately, nothing really sets Mezzo apart from other restaurants in its tier.  As others have said, this is a great place to share drinks with friends.  I feel the best way to describe Mezzo is that people visiting from out of town would absolutely love the place.  However, personally, living just down the street detracts from some of it's charm.  It is definitely a capable middle tier restaurant that can hold it's own, but if I want a true date night experience, I'm probably going to choose somewhere that offers a bit more allure.  But I know I'll definitely return for casual dining and half-priced wine."},{"name":"MJ O'Connor's","address":"425 Summer St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"I am staying at the Westin for a conference and wanted a quick, quiet dinner so I could get some work done in the evening.

The menu is decent - I got the steak salad which was quite tasty and the steak surprisingly tender and flavorful.  I had a really nice glass of red wine. The wait staff  were very friendly and accommodating.  They had the right amount of chatting me up as a solo traveler and leaving me alone to eat in peace. (those of you who travel alone on business know what I mean) I think I would have given it 5 stars if the \\"atmosphere\\" would have been a bit better.  For an Irish pub, the beer selection wasn't great and the menu was a bit...boring?  I don't want to sound too negative because I had a really good experience.

I caved in yesterday. I had mediocre memories of the previous deli, Joan & Ed's, that was there. I ordered a Reuben Knish, a Meat Knish, a Slaw Reuben sandwich and a diet Dr. Browns Black Cherry soda. because, I AM watching my waistline. The Knishes were delicious. They were different than what I remember getting in Brookline in the 70's. They were, in fact, a whole lot better. The Slaw Reuben was also excellent. To me, the best sandwiches are the messiest sandwiches. This definitely did not disappoint me. Being borderline geriatric, I still learn things daily. And the meal reinforced the theory that you get what you pay for. I am glad that I went. \\n The service was also wonderful. I tend to do lunch between 2:00 & 4:00. So the place was pretty much empty. My server Max, was efficient, made NO mistakes, friendly and courteous. He did disappoint me once, since he is from Sudbury, I asked him what the phone number for the Wayside Inn was, and he didn't know. Most all of Sudbury uses a 443 prefix, and the Wayside Inn number is 443-1776. Which also happens to be Sudbury's zip code & the birth date of the United States of America.

A $19 earthern ware pitcher of sangria with painstakingly chopped apples was the best that I have had in Boston. We opted for the Valenciana style arroz con mariscos, which takes 25 to 30 minutes to prepare.  The wait was no problem, as we lounged on the beautifully gardened balcony and sampled giant grilled prawns with piri-piri sauce and bread grilled to perfection, pureed potato-leek soup and crab cakes (good though I have had better.) \\nThe rice dish outweighed the paella at even my favorite Spanish restaurant in Greenwich Village. The saffron-scented, incredibly moist arroz was bursting with tender pork loin, chicken breast, calamari, clams, mussels, prawns and linguica. The only thing missing was a bit of salt and heat, but this was easily repaired with condiments at the table. The dish was just as good if not better the next day.
