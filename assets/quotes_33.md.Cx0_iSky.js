We Went to G Michael's several times for our anniversary, birthday and other celebratory meals.  Literally each and every time time we had stellar food.  Once it was Sturgeon, that was flaky, tender and moist. The sides were every bit as good. Another it was Filet Mignon that was perfectly crusted with blue cheese and with a side of yellow squash.   While I will agree the parking is difficult, they went the extra mile to help us in that department, as my husband and I are disabled and needed close parking.\\n\\nWe moved from Ohio a while back and miss their food terribly.  Also, I wanted to mention that they were more than willing with enough notice to do a \\"chef special\\", where the head chef would simply cook what he felt was his best meal with what was available for menu that day; and friends, you can't beat that: really.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is cozy, warm and inviting.  Yes the seating venue (Hostess) is past the bar in the entrance and you do know where you need to go to find it.

Also, their wait staff is superb in working with you, especially if you have any dietary concerns...they will accommodate.\\n\\nSo, come here if you want a strong meal that is consistently good, fresh and just be willing to pay what you need to here. This is not a cheap dinner, but then again, consider it an adventure in gastronomic travel, you will thank me for it.

It's not bad, and everyone including Yoshi himself are polite and attentive. But at times they seem overwhelmed and may forget requests for more rice or water.  Other times, the bill comes too soon, before I've finished  my meal, which were it my first time there I would interpret as rude.

All of the cheeses are from Antonelli's, a local Austin cheese shop known for carrying some of the best and most interesting fromage around. The plate also had house made balsamic grapes to accompany the cheese...SO good!  The wine selection was perfect...not so extensive that it's overwhelming, but enough to keep you coming back to try more. The only thing that was a bit frustrating was the service. Our server was lovely and knowledgeable, but Apothecary seemed to be a bit under staffed and sometimes it was hard to get her attention.

When I lived in Decatur I always wanted to try this place, but being a poor student with poor student friends didn't really offer me that opportunity. Enter grandma with a credit card with a much larger limit. Thanks Nana. \\n\\nWe started at the bar with what was possibly the best part of the meal... the cocktails. My mom and grandmother got this purply creme-de-lavender somethign or other in it...sweet and well balanced. My dad got something with grapefruit, and naturally I ordered the best drink of the bunch--something with gin and ginger beer and lime. I can't think of the name but all the drinks were good. Loved that they actually squeezed the fruit right in front of you. \\n\\nI don't remember the bread, which leads me to believe it wasn't memorable or that we didn't get any. Either way, weak sauce. The appetizers, however, were anything but weak sauce. We got three to share: a cured pork with homemade pickles (awesome and balanced when eaten together but the pork was a bit overwhelming when by itself); a feta and heirloom tomato salad (classic but not at all boring b/c it had some fried couscous in it for crunch!) and a mozzarella, pecan and tomatoe salad...dont remember this one as much so may not have been stellar. \\n\\nFor the entrees, my mom and I both ordered the striped bass in parchment paper with salsa di salmoriglio and pea shoots. The fish was moist, the salsa was fresh, and the pea shoots added a nice crunch. Also, it wasn't overly salted or rich, making my tummy happy. My grandmother ordered an appetizer-sized serving of scallops which were deliciously sweet and, again, not overly salted (some may have thought they weren't seasoned aggressively enough). My dad ordered a chicken dish because he was afraid of the cold roast beef. He made a mistake for sure. The chicken was good for chicken. But not that flavorful and not that moist. His was the dud of the group. \\n\\nFor the table we also ordered a fregula (couscou) and green bean salad as well as roasted corn. The corn was a throw-away. it was overcooked, mushy, poorly seasoned, and didn't taste any fresher than you can get from publix on sale. Don't order the corn. The fregula and green beans were delicious though and worth the addition.\\n\\nWhew, my fingers are a-gettin-tired! Dessert time!!!! We ordered a chocolate cake of sorts and a rum-soaked angel-food-styled cake.They were both decent, but I can't remember them that well, leading me believe there left something to be desired. But I also don't remember leaving any on the plate...\\n\\nOverall, I WILL be back for more Cakes and Ale.

The bar was pretty crowded.. so the hostess brought us allllll the way to the back of the lounge (which wasn't that crowded). The lounge is pretty cool.. it feels more like a funky house. Lots of chairs that looked like they came right out of the mitchell gold + bob williams catalog... (that's a compliment). My friend and I were seated really close to a couple who was clearly on a date. I, fresh off a breakup, really was in the mood to bash men... so I don't think they loved being so close to me. \\n\\nLuckily for us, the hostess was so sweet and offered to let us know when there were seats at the bar. We ordered our drinks and before we knew it, the hostess came by and said that they found us two seats and our drinks would be there waiting for us. smooth move, Hawthorne.\\n\\nThe drinks were realllllly yummy.

There really wasn't a false step at all in the meal that my husband and I had at Jack Allen's, so it's getting a rare 5-star review from me.\\n\\nMy husband and I arrived at around 3pm (yes, another post-yoga combination dinner and lunch meal).  This happened to be during the weekend happy hour (which I believe is 3-6pm) where all drinks are $1 off (I think) and appetizers are 1/2 off.  \\n\\nWe were worried that the place would be super-crowded because I'd read many reviews that said it was always crowded.  But while we were there it wasn't even half full.  Once we were seated, we were impressed by the architecture and other design choices in the dining area.\\n\\nMy husband ordered a Fireman's #4 and I ordered a very good cocktail called the \\"Texas Sipper\\" (tequila, St. Germain, grapefruit juice, mint, and Fresca).  Our waitress had offered a complimentary amuse-type thing of homemade pimiento cheese with crackers, and that came with our drinks.  My drink was great, his beer was good, and we really liked the pimiento cheese, even though I normally hate the stuff.  Basically it was more cheese and less goo, and I love cheese, so I really liked it.\\n\\nSince appetizers were half off, we decided to order one.  We got the \\"layered chunky queso.\\"  It was amazing.  I dunno, maybe we got a good batch or something, but the pork that we got was not fatty at all, but was still super-tender and easy to divide between chips.  The guacamole included was definitely some of the best I've ever had, and the actual cheese component was also good and balanced well with the other components.  And the chips were great too ... thick and crisp and homemade, obviously fresh but not greasy at all.  After we ran out of queso we kept on eating the chips, even well into our excellent main dishes.  \\n\\nWe decided to order slightly lighter things for our main dishes since we'd already had the appetizer.  This was apparently a good choice.  My husband got a lunch special, which was ruby trout with salad.  I got the \\"crispy salmon with crab and hothouse tomato wedges\\" from the regular dinner menu.  Both of us were really pleased with our fish, and we both liked my food the best (my husband's was good too, nothing at all to complain about, just not quite as flavorful).  Our waitress had told me that if I wanted the salmon cooked more than medium rare I should let her know, so I asked for it medium, and that's how it came.  The \\"crispy\\" aspect to it was awesome ... it was crispy on the outside without being dry.  The crabmeat and hothouse tomatoes (and yes, they had a bunch more flavor than plain old grocerystore tomatoes) were perfect compliments to the fish, and the chimichurri-like tomatillo sauce worked well with everything.  \\n\\nWe didn't get desserts this time since we'd already eaten enough.  We gave our wonderful waitress a good tip.  I want to go back to Jack Allen's ASAP!  I'll go to a yuppie place any day of the week if the food is this good!"},{"name":"Deschutes Brewery Portland Public House","address":"210 NW 11th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Had better.

Now, between the two, I would prefer Little Sheep because A) The portion size for the all you can eat order items that little sheep gives you is small so you can eat other stuff as well.

So if you order meat balls, they give you ALOT of meatballs and you can't eat it all. \\n\\nBut the thing that made Little Sheep Mongolian Hot Pot stood out to me compared to all other hot pot places is the following:\\n\\n-The complimentary soup dumplings that you get with your hotpot price. \\n-Also pancakes, fried donuts, and red bean buns. \\n-The fact that the pot is a big pot so you can bring your family here and have a real hot pot like at home. \\n-The fact that they cut the meat at the meat window and you know its cut fresh lol. \\n\\nNow, for the cons:\\n-The sauces are very limited\\n-Alot of their stuff (like shrimp meatball, fish fillet, corn,) is frozen.

I thought it'd make a good Yelp! review too. I should have been tipped off that the place was almost completely empty.\\n\\nThis place used to be a PIetro's Pizza, as I understand it, back in the day.  It would have stayed better off being an empty husk of a building.  Maybe the service would have been better.\\n\\nWe were seated instantly, at a half-booth/half-table sort of thing...it was pretty awful to be honest.  We received a basket of chips and salsa and while I'll say that the salsa was actually pretty decent, being spicy without too hot, the chips were as stale as stale can get.  STALE.  STAAAAAAAAAAAAAAALE!\\n\\nI forget what my girlfriend ordered, but I know that all I ordered was a quesadilla and a beef taco and a beer.\\n\\nThe beer came quickly.  I drank all of it.  Twenty minutes later I flagged down the waitress, who hadn't been back at all to check on us, and got another beer.\\n\\nMy girlfriend, having worked at a Mexican restaurant in the past, was unhappy at the amount of time this was taking.  Cheese between tortillas, it's pretty simple, for the quesadilla.  And the place was pretty empty at the time.\\n\\nSo we flag the waitress down AGAIN and ask her how long it's going to take.  She comes back and says something along the lines of, the kitchen is busy and it'll be another fifteen minutes.\\n\\nNope.\\n\\nIt doesn't take forty five minutes to make this kind of food.  We threw enough money on the table to cover the beers and left.\\n\\nI would be suspect of those five star reviews I see here.  They smell more like Friends Making a Yelp! Account To Rave.  They fooled us.  Our experience was more in line with Erin's, but at least the money I paid for the beer was worth the product.

Bumped to 5 stars for two reasons: 1) the executive lunch special and 2) customer service \\n\\nIf you didn't catch this from other reviews, the executive lunch special nets you one of their traditional/veggie dogs, a side, AND a Texan beer. This would cost $20 coming at any other time, but for the weekday lunch? Only $8. It's like Banger's wants you to rob them. \\n\\nI absolutely love taking my friends for lunch here, and I'm convinced that this is one of the best specials that Austin offers. They usually have ~50 Texan beers on tap, so I always have the good problem of deciding what I want to drink next..\\n\\nIn addition, the customer service is phenomenal. Banger's has a great staff. The hostess greets you warmly, and the bartenders are friendly and make conversation. Your waiter/waitress is helpful, kind, and patient - all qualities needed for a place that has so many different choices for sausages and beer. \\n\\nThis place is great to come to for dinner and on the weekends as well, but I'm especially a fan for lunch.

The sign, the decor, the wait, even the prices practically ensured nothing had changed.  But this of course is just a facade as a recent visit confirmed what I had been hearing as of late - this place is disgustingly filthy.\\n\\nMost if not all of my previous experiences were in the Japanese style private booths, where the only way to get in and out is to step or crawl into the seating area.  This meant the bottom of our shoes collectively scuffed the seats and over years of shoe scuffage makes the booth a cesspool of nastiness.  If it's hard for customers to get in and out, it only means it's even harder for the staff to get in to clean it.   \\n\\nOur table looked as if it was clean, shiny and practically embossed, it came as a surprise to my guests when the table was unbearably sticky.  Bubble gum had nothing on the surface of this table, it was just one giant adhesive, presumably from the accumulation of grime and grease.  There was no worry of items shifting around, this table provided the grip for everything from cups to napkins to plates.  At one point I had draped the entire end of the table with napkins to keep my forearms from touching.\\n\\nThe menu looks to have the same prices from the last 10 years.  It also seems to have the same stains as well.  The lamination was breaking down and it seems the food had somehow snuck it's way into the plastic, almost like a makeshift scratch-n-sniff menu.\\n\\nMy cup had a little bit of food as well,  dried out pieces of rice stuck to the side made for an interesting texture.  After switching out several stained seating mats, I realized there were food crumbs, dust, and dead bugs all collected along the rims of the wall and seats.  It's one thing to see it at a restaurant, it's also another to actually sit in it.\\n\\nThe food was nothing more than a mediocre Japanese food extravaganza.  The sushi was remarkably smooth, but disturbingly warm.  Gyoza was almost gummy, all stuck together like it stayed in a pan for too long.  The surf clams were just a seacup of baked mayo with some sour seafood bits within.  Though the fish jaw was the crowd favorite, it was merely the standout of a lackluster spread.  It all felt frozen or precooked, with no hint of freshness or anything unique, the only thing missing was the crew from Kitchen Nightmares and Gordon Ramsey.\\n\\nYears of popularity for some establishments sometimes translates to years of neglect.  Some places are willing to cut corners to continue the high profits without maintaining the growth.  The added pressure of a half hearted cleaning job and quick food preparation, while rushing customers out, is only sure to create more bad experiences along the way.

Aside from the presentation, I don't think the dill salt was necessary as the wings were salty on their own (probably from the brine). I didn't find this dish any special.\\n\\n3. Chicken Seoul Good: Korean fried chicken, mushroom cream sauce, truffle oil and parmesan cheese - This was a tasty and hearty appetizer. The boneless chicken was fried nicely, but I didn't taste enough truffle oil. I found this dish too heavy with the cream and could only eat around 2 pieces.\\n\\n4. Shio Koji: Salted rice malt, roasted chicken thigh skewers, potato salad and pickles - This was one of my favourite dishes. The chicken had a nice char on the outside and the inside was juicy and tender. I didn't try the potato salad, but the pickles were pickled in-house and had a nice sweetness.\\n\\n5. Steak Your Claim: AAA ribeye, fries, Chinese donut in a balsamic soy glaze - We ordered the ribeye instead of the sirloin steak. The steak was grilled very well; it was tender, but not overcooked. The chimichurri sauce complimented the meat and gave it a brightness that lightened the dish. My favourite is the side dish, which was something I haven't eaten anywhere else before. The fries were soft, but the fried Chinese donut was crunchy. It was very flavourable with a strong soy taste. \\n\\n6. Belly-to-Belly: Pork belly in a coconut curry, served with steamed bao and pickle vegetables - You can make your own bao (like a sandwich) and customize it the way you like. I think this was a fun, but average dish. It isn't bad, but not memorable.\\n\\n7. Heart Attack Rice: Stir fried rice, chicken confit, sous vide egg with chicken crackling - This is one of the most popular dishes at the restaurant. This is a hearty rice dish with great texture; the chicken crackling added a crunch and the sous vide egg was a binder adding creaminess. Like many of the other dishes however, I found this way too heavy.\\n\\n8. Squid ink pasta with roe and uni - This is a new addition to their menu. I enjoyed the creaminess of the pasta and the roe gave a little \\"pop\\" with every bite. The flavours were good, however, a little bit of acid would have lightened the dish.\\n\\n9. Chai It - Tiramisu, chai lady fingers and spiced rum marscapone - Tiramisu is one of my favourite desserts. This was presented very cute and dainty in a cocktail cup. The chai flavour is very strong. I think you either love or hate chai, and for me, I am not a fan. I found the chai and spice flavours too strong, overpowering all the other flavours in a tiramisu.\\n\\n10. Mean & Green: Matcha lava cake, red bean and red bean ice cream - The cake was baked very well. It was hard on the top, liquid in the middle, and the bottom was batter that was solidifying. The cake was on the sweet side, so I do appreciate the red bean and red bean ice cream on the side. The red beans were unsweetened and helped cut the sweetness.\\n\\n* Overall, I think the owners put a lot effort in the restaurant. The restaurant tries to incorporate locally sourced ingredients and Ocean Wise sustainable seafood, which I don't think they advertise enough. The menu is creative and truly highlights what fusion cuisine is all about. The restaurant doesn't have a strong focus on vegetable dishes. Aside from the entrees, I recommend sharing because many of the dishes were too heavy or strongly seasoned. A couple bits and I couldn't eat anymore. Prices are not cheap. Be prepared to spend around $30 per person. This restaurant has an interesting concept worth trying, however, I don't think I would crave it or go specifically there."},{"name":"Wayne's Smoke Shack","address":"406 Center Dr","city":"Superior","stars":"4.5","text":"Best BBQ around! Seriously, I've been to every non-chain BBQ joint in the North/Central Metro area and this is by far the best. I went based on the stellar review from a family friend, who said it was his favorite place to grab BBQ. I was not disappointed. Perfectly smoked ribs that fall off the bone and don't need any sauce. The rub used was amazing, and they were cooked to perfection. The other pork products, the shoulder and belly are also top notch, with plenty of flavor and moisture. Unfortunately, when things run out they run out, and I didn't get to partake in the brisket (which I've heard is their flagship entree) this visit, but next time I'll be sure to get there early. They open and are only doing business as long as they have supply; which for a Saturday isn't very long. An hour and a half being open and half the menu was sold out. Worth it? You bet! The sauces are amazing, the sides are delicious, and the variety of meats are exquisite!

I like Waitiki's location, especially the outdoor seating, so I wasn't too disappointed in the move.\\n\\nAfter making my way across the street to Waitiki and finding a seat I was reviewing the Sauced menu (along with a copy of the Waitiki menu) with a sweet tea at hand.  Not sure whether I wanted the pulled pork or beef brisket, I asked the waitress for her reocmmendation.  She said she really liked the brisket so I ordered the brisket.\\n\\nWhen delivered my sandwich was piled high with brisket and covered with my chosen sauce.  (I am a sauce gal so I would have preferred more sauce, maybe even some for dipping my fries as well.)  The first bite of beef brisket off the plate wasn't too impressive but a few more bites into the actual sandwich I was a happy camper.\\n\\nThe brisket was tender and had good flavor but not too over powering on the smoke.  The meat was very juicy and did I mention it was stacked high?

But we've found in multiple occasions that the staff find it an absolute chore to prepare orders past 11pm -- 2 hours before their store closing. Now I'd understand if it was an hour before closing as restaurants do need time to close their kitchens up but two hours before, and during a Friday? Now that just screams lazy kitchen to me.\\n\\nTheir pricing seems way over the top for the portion size and quality of the food. They pad their padthai with majority bean sprouts. The Bao's are very basic baos that cost pennies to make on their own but they overprice them and justify it with a half serving of meat and veggies with a dollop of sauce. The fried rice is MOSTLY rice with less than a cup of the actual meat and veggies, so you're paying $18 bucks for 95% rice. The entrees are small for what they charge ($17-$20) with NO sides, what is up with that?\\n\\nBut wait, you're telling me they want to focus on drinks instead? Well look no further than one block to see two much better places for your alcohol needs, plus those other places are open even later with cheaper prices. \\n\\nIt makes sense to me now why their downtown location closed.

It is on the exclusive side, as reservations go up the first Friday of the month for the next month and are typically fully booked (For example, I made our 6/16 reservation on 5/4). It took us 3 months to finally get in.\\nAlso, every after-tax dollar you spend goes to \\"The Giving Kitchen\\",  a non-profit organization that provides emergency financial assistance to restaurant workers in need. \\nService was also amazing. Everyone was great.\\n\\nNow the not-so-good....\\n\\n3 months ago (when we first started trying to come here), the reservation was $105 a person. It is now $150 per person and is prepaid. If something comes up inside of their 48 hour cancellation window, there is a no refund policy. Anyone with younger children should be aware of this as (as you probably have experienced) anything can happen. They ask for dietary restrictions and were definitely responsive when we sent ours over, but could not truly accommodate any of them. But as long as your dietary restriction is vegan or gluten-free, you should be ok.\\n\\nThe part that it pains me to type, is that the food wasn't that good. It is a 10 course tasting menu (for those of you that haven't done that yet, it's small about 3-spoonful-sized portions of 10 dishes) and is determined for you. You do not get to order or change anything. We actually felt like this was pretty cool at first, as it was kind of like having a personal chef. The difference with that though, is your chef knows your likes and dislikes. \\n\\nThe smoked duck (pictured below) was tasty, and probably the best dish. I've included others from our experience. \\n\\nIn all honestly, it just ended up feeling extremely pretentious and like the focus was not on your dining experience. At $400 (after drinks and tip) for 2 people, I expected a lot more. I walked away feeling like I had bought into the hype. It was a shame, as it was my wife's birthday. \\n\\nIf you like trendy, and are one of those people that love saying \\"I ate at the top-rated restaurant in Atlanta\\" give it a shot.

AMAZING!\\n\\nThis time we went for their Sunday brunch. If I said \\"BAMM!\\" again it wouldn't do it justice. What I can say again is that I don't know everything, but I know great  service and great food when I get them, and this was BOTH!  AND EVEN BETTER THAN THE FIRST TIME!\\n\\nI had the Eggs Benedict. This was simply one of the two best Eggs Benedicts I've ever had. A tie for first. They do Benedict right. They do Benedict the way it should be done. They use fresh shaved Ham instead of Canadian Bacon. Such a great choice for texture and taste, and they don't skimp on the Ham. Served with the most perfectly done Hash Browns in the right amount. Not a massive amount of Hash Browns and a medium sized Benedict like the trap so many restaurants have fallen into (I call the the Denny's dilemma). Amount over substance is not a cure for mediocrity in restaurants, but a band-aid that leaves you full and getting fat and unhealthy.\\n(Side note - As a person who eats clean everyday, and has a fitness plan that he follows, a cheat meal that's good enough to make me go back two days later for another cheat is so rare that I've only found four others in my whole life (I'm 46). That's about one every 9+ years. Pretty impressive to make that list).\\n\\nMom had the Croissant-e Cristo and all I can say again is that I am SOOOO thankful that she bass a small stomach and I got to finish this when we got home. A sweet croissant with shaved Ham, Dijon, Marionberry, and Swiss cheese.Holy Hell this thing was good (and I only got 4 bites - kinda' frustrated she finished as much as she did). Again, the right amount of everything as to not let one taste overpower any other, and I love the use of Oregon produce. The Marionberry. Yum!\\n\\nDad had the Ham and Cheese omelette which he quietly ate without saying much or bringing mention to it. That's his way of making sure no one will ask for a bite of something he really likes. I could smell it and wanted to ask for a bite, but was too Depp into enjoying my food, and before I realized it, his plate was empty! Good plan Dad.\\n\\nLast, my little lady (daughter) had the Oreo Pancakes. BAMM! and NOM NOM! Dammit these were incredible! I want to use all the expletives in the book to emphasize how amazing they were, but I'll just say that I stole more than half of them from her. They came with Oreo whipped creme on top which was a taste sensation in its own right. The pancakes.......... the pancakes were the best I've ever had. You know when you see a commercial on TV and the pancakes have the perfect texture and they're fluffy and they lay down gently on the plate? Ya, that commercial was filmed in the kitchen at the Original Dinerant. And then they folded bits of Oreo cookie into the batter. Holy Cow!!! They were the most perfectly cooked, soft, fluffy and tasty pancakes ever. Did I already say that?\\n\\nOne additional food find here is the hand folded honey butter. DAMM was that good!\\n\\nAnd on the service side, all the regular players were there......... Anna was supervising, Max was managing, our killer assistant server Allison wasn't there, but there's a new star to add to the line-up. Drew. He was warm and funny but not overly funny or cocky. He was genuinely concerned with how we felt about our meal and about the dining experience overall. He's another server that embodies great service.\\n\\nI also ordered a Salty Jim shake. Vanilla and Bourbon and Caramel and I think a hint of cinnamon maybe. Not sure. DELICIOUS!  IT WAS SO DAMM GOOD!!!\\n\\nAnna was super attentive and courteous even more than our previous visit. She cares. It's that simple. You don't get amazing service from a crappy, uncaring person. She personifies a good, caring person, which makes the best server.\\n\\nMax............. What can I say? He's on point all the time. He said Hi early on and thanked us for coming back in, and he took time to talk about how the last couple of days of my parents' vacation had been and just spent some time with us being Max. He is another person that CARES. GENUINELY! It's obvious he does. He gives a crap, and it shows. We asked if they had a kids small t-shirt for my 5 year old daughter, and he found one for her. AMAZING!\\n\\nSimply put, if you  want great service and great food, you'd better get your butt down there. Like, now! The Original Dinerant is the newest addition to the BEST IN MY LIFETIME list. This is in the top 5.\\n\\nAMAZING!!!!!  We will be back there next weekend for sure. Probably at 1130 Sunday morning for brunch.

First impression was a little bit odd because it is set up with sort of an order counter and tile floor and a lot of little tables - it looks pretty much like any type of fast casual food place you would go into.  However, it had a \\"wait to be seated\\" sign. We were seated promptly at a somewhat small table divided from the other tables by little miniature screens. So it was a little out of the ordinary that it was set up for table service when we expected more of a fast casual restaurant. The menu was our next shocker because the average dish is probably $11.99 with many dishes north of that. The table service was excellent, friendly, fast and the ambience was fair -  not too noisy although there was only one other patron in the restaurant.  The food? Well, between the four of us we only had three dishes because two of us got the same thing and I guess none of us could complain or rave too much, I don't want to say average but just nothing that exciting. Basically 12 bucks for a bowl of noodles.

Off the menu, the food was well made and should be perfect if you've got a craving for a classic waffle that doesn't get soggy.  My one qualm would be that the omelette filling wasn't cooked into the egg, but was wrapped in egg instead.  Great filling, but the stuff spills out.  I prefer the egg to stick to itself when folded over fillings.\\n\\n--Service--My friends and I could tell that BSC was indeed high in demand and one busy busy place.  However, we didn't feel particularly rushed out.  We felt rushed IN, but not rushed OUT.

Mike and the others really pay attention to details.  While we were waiting for our table (we knew which one we'd be given), I wanted to turn the table and chairs for max comfort and walking space.  Turns out Mike and Co. were thinking the same thing and positioned the table and chairs exactly as I had imagined.  OMG I think that made my experience!  That, and the help-yourself coffee while waiting in line in the cold ... very nice.  And the small crumb that Mike found hiding under the condiment tray.  Details, people!

Also, it was a glob of gooey mess - what a disaster.\\n\\nI also tried the pad kee mow, also known as drunken noodles. It was pretty blass√©. Wasn't spicy enough for me and unimpressionable. I had to add the hot sauce (that I had to ask for).I guess the other reviews with 3 or more stars are from patrons who hasn't had (real)Thai food in the city and usually order Americanized asian food in the suburbs."},{"name":"OSAKA Japanese Sushi & Steak House","address":"14 Green St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3.5","text":"We came on last Thursday night with a group of 15 people for a birthday.

Everyone else had Hibachi and they loved it. The portions were HUGE. We did have to wait a while for it to come out, but once they started cooking it was really fast.

You really can't go wrong with any of the beers you choose but 6 - 4oz beers was a good ammt for me. The highlight of the sampler was the sour beer. It tasted like a lemon cider beer of that sort. I've had some cider beers but not ant labeled a sour. It was pretty good. Their IPAs were also on point with a food hoppy flavor and hints of citrus is some. Look at the ibus and read the description for an accurate taste. \\n\\nThe food was pretty good as well. I got the elk burgee which tasted like beef and would never know if someone didn't tell you. It was a tad gamey but barelyyyyyyt and it was a lot leaner. It was good though and glad I got it. \\n\\nMarking it down a star because their special was a rib eye and it was \\"the worst ribeye I ever had\\" quoted by one in out party. Ribeyes are usually juicy, well marbled, tender and a little fatty. The most flavorsome and best part of the beef in my opinion. The steak was dry,chewy and looked over done or cheap. I would've thought it was a new York steak because of the taste and everything. Its not even hard to make a good rib eye either! Salt and pepper and throw that baby on an iron skillet for a few min and it comes out juicy and great, even from Safeway steaks. This one was not even in that category of being good. Beware of ordering steak from here even if it is the special.\\n\\nThey also charge a lot for the items. Burgers were $14. Bison burger was about $17. Add one were $1-2. They even forgot mushrooms on our burger which was an extra $2, but they took it off our tab eventually and we still ended tipping over 20% anyways.

The ambience and service are both fantastic. I wish I were better at remembering names, our server was fantastic. Very attentive without being intrusive. \\n\\nWe tried four dishes tonight, two I've had before and two I've never had before. All of them were mind blowing. \\n\\n1. When I think of Hawkers, the first thing I want is the roti canai. The bread is always warm, fresh, and flaky. The curry sauce that comes on the side has a nice kick to it, and a wonderful spice profile and seasoning. I want a recipe for that sauce. \\n\\n2. Pad Thai. Spot on. Always a classic hit. \\n\\n3. The green beans with a thick soy/hoisin sauce was yummy! The green beans were perfectly crispy, and it was paired with sweet shredded carrots and the sauce. What a perfect balance. Eating vegetables is always fun here for that reason. \\n\\n4. Finally, Hawkers rarely ever adds new plates, but in the month or so that I've been away, they've added pork belly bao buns. They were DELISH. Perfectly seasoned and cut pork belly stuffed in steamed buns with pickled vegetables and sliced hard boiled eggs? Yes, please. This dish will be a hit once it catches on. \\n\\nHawkers is one of the best restaurants in town because while they have a wide variety of Asian food options, they execute almost all of them perfectly.

This is when the manager approached her and at this point she was tired and just wanted her coat. The manager told her that if she didn't have her claim number they couldn't retrieve a coat for her, which is hilarious because the girl had already taken it! So at this point its been probably 30 plus minutes and still no coat has been found, my friend is very agitated by now and of course is not happy. \\nOk, so they've lost her coat and/or given it to someone else; they've taken her coat tag number so she is left standing there looking stupid and angry.

But this review isn't about \\"normal\\" Steamrollers, it's about the Steamrollers that serves turkey burritos for two weeks around Thanksgiving (and perhaps now Christmas).  What's the big deal about Steamrollers turkey burritos you ask?  Why it's a home style Thanksgiving turkey dinner complete with carved turkey, stuffing and potatoes stuffed in a burrito and smoother in gravy and cranberry sauce!  Did I mention it's delicious?  Because it is!\\n\\nGranted if you don't like Thanksgiving Turkey dinners this will be a let down, but if you do...  Boy oh boy!  I have been known to have one for lunch and dinner on the same day.  In fact For the third year in a row have called Steamrollers desperately asking them when do their turkey burritos start?  Answer:  Monday October 1st for two weeks.  Joy!\\n\\nP.S.  I've never reviewed a small chain.  Is it fine to cut and paste a review from another location you frequent?  Too late, I just did.

We got here and were promptly seated for the hibachi. Our waiter was really attentive, and it didn't take too long for the hibachi chef to come out. I got steak and chicken, my husband got shrimp. The chef did all his usual tricks, except with a few new ones we haven't seen before. The rice was awesome, and there was enough food left over for lunch the next day. The family next to us had a kid and he was totally into the chef. He exclaimed, \\"its dinner and a show!\\" - The irony, here, being that my husband totally feels this way about hibachi... as a result of a number of birthday parties at the place when he was little.

I had a bite and as someone who doesn't normally like beets, it was very tasty!  The goat cheese really makes a difference.  We also split the kangaroo appetizer which was also excellent.  The chefs here really know how to make flavor work!  I had the rabbit for my entree and my BF had lamb.  Both were excellent.  Had I less breeding, I would have licked my plate.

After hitting a few Rainey St. bars, we needed something to soak up our cocktails. We didn't realize (but should have) that Bangers isn't just a lame name for a bar, but rather a highly appropriate name for a sausage place. The ambiance from the huge back yard/patio lured us in, despite being en route to a nearby food truck. And man what a meal! (more like a gutbomb.) The food was good but man, the ambiance! It's like the perfect place like Shady Grove (minus the wait) or Freddy's...just a good groove there. We had poutine - my first time and while it was tasty, seems like a cold weather thing...and I can't say how it ranks among the other poutine offerings in the world. My friend wasn't wild about her brat, only because she thought the pretzel bun (while awesome) overpowered her toppings. Mine on the other hand was rockin (like Dokken, as she'd say) - I had the chicken sausage with spinach & sun-dried tomatoes, on a kolache bun and DAMN DAMN DAMN it was good. And oh yeah, with carmelized onions. Get that. Srsly. \\n\\nAlso... not only did we meet a dog with a green mohawk there...among the families, hipsters and other dog lovers, but there is a playpen for dogs. Pretty awesome concept except...the dogs don't play there, they screw there.

Bonus points!\\n\\nps. for those you who care, they have a zillion beers on tap, some wines and their menu is HUGE -kind of intimidating.

I will go into explicit detail. \\n\\nI can imagine Cafe Java as the \\"alt-rock\\" sister of the classic Texas diner; replete with (very cheap) comfort food breakfast choices, families and members of the local community, all congregating for a simple yet legitimately delicious & fulfilling meal. \\n\\nStepping inside this restaurant will make you feel as if you were just transported to one those late-90's sitcoms.

There have been more than a handful of times that I solely come to have breakfast here because I'm having a not-very-good day and the servers/staff will immediately cheer me up-- I swear to God this place has the sweetest servers I have ever had the pleasure of meeting. \\n\\nCafe Java is a good distance away from the noisy and over-animated downtown area of Austin, and that makes it a truly special place.  Its location is so concealed that their (very understated) front sign humbly hides behind a tree. I overheard one patron express how this diner doesn't need the extensive marketing & inexcusable overpricing of items other business have to rely on, in order to stay afloat. The number of regulars (who have been living in the neighborhood for years) and ACC students are  enough to keep this place busy and operating. \\n\\nFinding employees as lovely and attentive is rare in our city nowadays; the people who frequent this cafe are part of a generation of Texan urbanites who still hold Southern values with the stylish edge that made Austin attractive in the first place.

We decided to venture into Buckhead for dinner before going to an 8pm show. We made 6pm reservations. We arrived right at 6 after parking in the adjacent parking garage. There were several other parties checking in as well. The hostesses moved the line along quickly and professionally which is rare these days. We asked to be seated on the patio and they were very accommodating. \\nOur server, Sherry was wonderful. She introduced herself and used my husbands name when addressing him. She went over the specials and was very attentive throughout the meal, even taking away used flatware and replacing it which is sadly not the norm these days. My husband ordered the 3 course meal, butternut squash soup which he devoured, we split a salad, he had the trout and the flourless chocolate cake. I ordered the hanger steak and the apple tart. My husband throughly enjoyed his meal, even saying he was happy we went there rather than another place he had suggested earlier. My steak was a little to charred for my taste but good just the same. I don't typically order anything non chocolate but since Sherry said the desserts were made in house, I decided to have the Apple Tart. It was very good and not too sweet. I ordered it without the caramel sauce. \\nMy only complaint is the restrooms. The door knobs aren't the same on each door and neither are the locks.

On the first, probably about a year ago, I went fairly late to pick up some dinner.  The girl working the drive thru window was very nice, but as I was waiting for my food I witnessed her bend over and proceed to projectile vomit into a garbage can.  I get that people can get ill, but doing it right in front of the window was a little alarming.\\n\\nThe second issue involved an online order using the Taco Bell app.  I submitted an order and then called the location about five minutes later to verify that it had received it and if the food was ready to be picked up.  The person I spoke with informed me that they hadn't received any orders.  I placed the order again and called back shortly after; same response.  I then checked my bank account online and saw that I had been charged for the order (once).  I called this location back asked to speak to a manager, who apologized and said I would be refunded immediately.  I waited three days or so and still no refund, so I eventually contacted Taco Bell Corporate, who finally granted me the refund.\\n\\nLastly, this third issue was just last week.  I was on my way to work and stopped to pick up dinner.  As soon as I pulled up to order, a female employee rudely informed me that \\"We're out of lettuce, so if you order something with lettuce you won't get any lettuce on it.\\"  Very nice.\\n\\nIt took three strikes, but I won't be back.

A friend and I first tried Via Tribunali on a Thursday evening and were pleased to find that the place was bigger than it appeared to be from outside and there was no wait for a table. However, actually getting seated was a bit difficult. Another couple came in right behind us and we explained to the hostess that we were not together.  Our server came over, conferred with the hostess, and said he would take us all upstairs.  There was some confusion as he started to seat us at a four-top, with the other couple lingering behind wondering if we were meant to share a table. I explained again that there were only two of us and we were moved to a two-top...but then had to get up again so he could adjust the open window behind our table. While deciding what to order, several times he approached us while we were obviously still looking at the menu. And once we had our food, he kept coming to check how we were doing, but every time seemed to awkwardly interrupt our conversation to ask. He was very pleasant and friendly but didn't seem to have the rhythm down.\\n\\nWe ordered the TONI LUPINO (pomodoro, fresh mozzarella, Italian sausage, coppa, grana, basil) with Caesar salads and a half carafe of house red wine--all delicious. Our server explained that the pizza was not pre-sliced because it was intended to be cut as it was being eaten, so we had to wrangle it some to get the misshapen pieces to our respective dishes.  Not a problem, just a little messy.  Aside from the frequent interruptions--which were made with good intentions, just poor timing--we had a lovely meal and really enjoyed the food.\\n\\nAnother dining companion and I stopped at Via Tribunali the following week when we happened to be walking by on a Sunday night. It was just after 10PM and we were pleased to see that they have a late happy hour from 10-11.  It was a warm night and we started inside for a spot, but quickly realized that the place was Way Too Hot, with the pizza oven so close to the booths (the upstairs section had already been closed for the evening). We asked if we could sit outside and were promptly seated, no confusion this time around.\\n\\nSitting outside was kind of a necessity due to the heat, but I wouldn't recommend it unless you are prepared to be thrust headlong into the Old Town culture. While waiting for our food, we were approached by a homeless man asking for a cigarette. Soon after, another guy came up to our table to ask for spare change. Then a group of young street kids descended on the nearby benches in the alleyway next to us, complete with a large barking dog that they invited to sit on top of one of the tables. Next, a man came up to our table selling roses...all the while a mentally ill transient was pacing back in forth in front of us on the sidewalk, talking to himself.  Certainly not the fault of the restaurant--you want to eat in Old Town, you get Old Town--but it was by no means a relaxing meal and I would not choose to sit outside again.\\n\\nAs before, the food was excellent. We had the Happy Hour Salame pizza with an antipasto plate and house red wine.  The Happy Hour pizzas are more one-person-sized than two, but at $5 you can easily afford a couple or three, which our server did recommend (interestingly, the little pizzas do arrive sliced). The antipasto plate had a good mix of items that were all fantastic, really tasty. The negative:  my companion's wine glass had greasy smudges on it, definitely not clean. And both of our water glasses were covered with what appeared to be pizza flour--a Lot of it.\\n \\nI would love to give Via Tribunali five stars but the awkward staff and dirty glasses were definite detractors. Everything on the menu looked great and I want to try about fifteen more things, so I will be back. I hope next time that the staff has settled in to their groove and the glasses are clean."},{"name":"Hawkers Asian Street Food","address":"1103 Mills Ave N","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"This place is good.\\n\\nAsian Tapas.. not sure what you would call that.\\n\\nGreat beer selection, great menu, good service.... its a fun place to go with some friends and share a little bit of everything!"},{"name":"Harry and Larry's Barbeque","address":"54 W Plant St","city":"Winter Garden","stars":"4","text":"You know - this place is cool looking and it sure smells good.

Our table specifically chose dishes unfamiliar to us and couldn't be happier with the new flavor experiences.  We got a chicken tikka masala too just for comparison.  It was too spicy (not heat but the shear amount and diversity of spices) for one of us but I thought it was the best I've ever had.

Yes, they didn't have a couple of things we asked for.  The food came out at different times.

I have not had a chance to do so since this is such a busy time of year for me, but I appreciate the gesture. \\nObviously, I cannot change my rating or words but I did want to include this piece of information as well. It is an indication of general concern for their customers and, in my opinion, classy.\\nI will certainly post again when I have had the chance to return to Hawkers.\\n\\n\\nThe space feels absolutely modern diner: unfinished floor, lightweight aluminum chairs and tables, TVs that deliberately feature the likes of Anthony Bourdain and Andrew Zimmern. The only suggestion of anything Asian in ambiance are oversize photos of food \\"hawkers\\" with a caption below that inform diners that these photos were taken in Malaysia, Vietman, etc. None of this is a bad thing. It states 'fresh,' 'simple,' 'perfect for lunch.'\\nService was non-descript and generic. Perfectly fine for what appears to be the concept here except that we waited just a little too long for glasses of water, the check, etc.\\nThe Bulgogi Bahn Mi Slider was not a slider(s) at all but, rather, a pressed bahn mi cut into three pieces. Still, my companion reports that it was crunchy, flavorful and fresh though he could not specifically identify the meat. The Five Spice Fish Tacos were a $6.50 joke with two small sticks of unseasoned frozen fish and a few flakes of cabbage hidden somewhere inside of a tortilla with a side of what could have been jarred pico de gallo. The Five Spice French Fries were small in portion, recently frost-bitten and sad. So sad. The Summer Rolls were as they should be, but good execution of such a staple can hardly be expected to make up for some of the items mentioned previously. \\nI cannot say I wouldn't try Hawkers again because it is well located and the concept is wonderful and so, so seductive. It could be that some of the larger, heavier dishes like udon and hot soups will deliver on the concept in a way that our light lunch choices did not. However, I am quite certain that nothing I ate thus far will incite the kind of desire or irrational cravings that I have known this style of food to inspire in me previously... and for other restaurants."},{"name":"Breakfast Club of Orlando","address":"63 E Pine St","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"Though the name of the restaurant mimics that of the fantastic 1980s Molly Ringwald movie, they don't have much in common except for both being great.\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I wandered there for some quality first-meal-of-the-day food.

How dare you?\\" \\n\\nThis tea salon lives in the same skeleton as the Urban Tea Merchant, which I liked. It was one of my go-to high tea places in the city. It was one of the best tea salons. It was sophisticated; neither flowery nor infantile. The old staff was dissolved, according to our server, and the management remained. The place has taken a more Oriental look... I guess they want more people to purchase the teas and/or experience fine dining, not a social event. Their menus included filet mignon and sable fish, which piqued a bit of my curiosity to consider another visit.\\n\\nThe customer service is top-notch both in the dining and sales areas. I didn't purchase tea but I was intrigued and learned. What happened to the former high tea room in the back, I don't want to know. There is no three tiered high tea service anymore. There is tea time that starts at 2...there are three sets: five finger sandwiches ($24), chic ($32) and fortune ($36? Not sure). My friend and I ordered two chic sets, which included $10 credit for tea, three finger sandwiches, an option of scones or blueberry muffins, and tea jelly and...cream? Supplements would cost $10. Macarons? $3 a piece. The tiny sandwiches were okay (the server didn't care to mention what they were): smoked salmon with one side covered in...what looks like nori furikake with crunchy grains (it didn't taste like tea), egg salad with a cut out yolk on top of it...and some chicken thing in avocado (maybe? I can't taste it). The pastries were fresh and warm. The blueberry muffin was delicious and the scone was average. Since the set tasted average, I am wary to try the menu items. I ordered my usual White Earl Grey tea and there was no refill for hot water...I guess that's fine. I only paid $20 for it. There is no reason for me to visit the dining area anymore.

The menu changes rapidly with their Farm-To-Table philosophy which results in total freshness. The kitchen turns out some of the most creative and well prepared dishes anywhere.

The great experience started with the valet service and Robert - and ended the same way - with every portion of the meal in between being fantastic. The portions were refined - but by the end of the meal we were all full and the food experience was amazing. I will say we are not fussy in general, but we selected the \\"tasting\\" menu with some concerns about not having enough control - but everything was well worth the experience of letting a top chef provide you the top of his art form. The dedication to providing an great experience was evident at every step with very friendly staff who explained every part of the meal; a nice wine selection that paired very well with the meal; and a nice laid back atmosphere in which to relax. We will certainly be back if we get within a 100 miles of Atlanta in the future. For the tasting menu - the 1st course was blue crab, with asparagus, radish and a touch of egg yolk. The combination was spot on as the crab flavor enhancing the asparagus perfectly. The second course was a ravioli with green garlic, koji and snap peas - and in between the first and second courses we received some of Lucille's Bread - which was derived from a family recipe. The 3rd course of this evening was sablefish with salami, lime and some nasturtium for a very attractive touch. The highlight of the meal was the 4th course which was Bear Creek beef with ramps, favas and abalone mushrooms which was fantastic. Not that we needed dessert - but the last course was strawberries and butter cake. The complete experience was great with very friendly and helpful staff - a very friendly environment and a place I look forward to returning whenever I'm back in the area.\\""},{"name":"Deschutes Brewery Portland Public House","address":"210 NW 11th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Having a hard time with the other reviews.

The toppings I've tried: sauerkraut, spicy sauerkraut, spice peppers, curry ketchup, aioli sauce, sweet and spicy mustard were all good.\\n\\n I definitely recommend getting the pretzel bun instead of the pumpernickel/wheat bun as the wheat bun is not substantial enough in texture to hold up the huge sausage and toppings piled on.\\n\\nJalapeno creamed corn was tasty and creamy.

I can only assume that the restaurant must feel that they can serve just about anything they want and give you enough barbecue sauce to sufficiently smother it that you can call it barbecue.  Growing up in Texas I KNOW what real barbecue is supposed to be.  First of all, brisket is supposed to be served sliced with the fat trimmed off.  There is a pink ring around the border that shows that it was smoked.  What Smokey served me tonight was cubed beef, predominantly consisting of chunks of fat.  Think pot roast, and you'd get an idea of what they served.  Second, barbecued sliced chicken is NOT broiled chicken with some liquid smoke drizzled on.  It is supposed to be chicken that has cooked on a smoker pit for hours.  Disgusting.  Third, steamed broccoli is bright green and has a little crunch left in it.  It is NOT broccoli that has been sitting under a heat lamp so long that it barely resembles a vegetable any longer.

You can read about their backstory in GQ among other places as one of the best new restaurants of 2016. \\n\\nFor me, the magic of Staplehouse is partly in their ability to provide a unique and elevated food experience that rivals or exceeds many that you may have had at much more stuffy and expensive Michelin starred restaurants...all while keeping the soul in the establishment, service, drinks and general ambiance. Yes, Staplehouse is still pricey but I promise you, if you go to restaurants that provide similar quality of food you will leave with a MUCH higher check and be forced into a tasting menu. So comparatively, it's good value and you don't have to dress up and have people watch you eat. \\n\\nReservations: If you can't get a reservation for dinner any time soon, don't. They take walk-ins at the bar. And while reservations are encouraged for dining in, I think you will be fine if going for lunch on Sundays. They do have a tasting menu available which you do need reservations and to be billed up front for.  Also, the lunch menu on the weekends is very similar to (I believe some of the same dishes) and same price as the dinner menu if I recall correctly. So unless you're a vampire, go for lunch, order a drink, and enjoy. But, if you want reservations and the tasting menu, they do offer that on their website. \\n\\nFood: Changes regularly but we all agreed that the beef sausage on the menu that day was the best any of us had ever had to date. Everything was nuanced, flavorful, creative, and memorable.\\n\\nDrinks: This caught me off guard. Usually, if I'm already busy getting blown away by the food, it becomes harder for the drinks to stand out for me, but not here. Tried three different drinks and all were great and refreshing while strong and complex. Aka dangerous. \\n\\nParking:  Not any directly on lot of restaurant. Valet and street parking exists and I recommend the lot directly across the street that has a scrap metal yard (if the parking spots on one side of it  are full just park by or in front of the scrap metal side and others will follow suit). \\n\\nThe main entrance is NOT in the front, it is in the back of the building.

I only was looking for a great brewery with delicious beers. I was actually VERY surprised with how the food tasted! One of the dishes I must say was a 'must-have' was the Mac n cheese with chorizo. The chorizo is made in house and they use their porter to cook it. It was quite delicious and surprised me greatly. Even when I full, I found myself picking out of that plate with the Mac n cheese. My second favorite dish was the appetizer pretzel. I don't like mustard as much so we ordered the pesto jalape√±o cheese. Wow! It was great! Way better than i expected it! As for my other two appetizers (garlic fries and deep fried cauliflower), I could have gone without those items. \\n\\nBeer Experience: The beer selection is quite nice. I did the beer flight and I wish I took a photo of what I ordered. The beer weren't the best to me, but that's probably because a) I ate too much and b) the food didn't compliment the beers so it left quite a bitter taste in my mouth. I had to power through with finishing my flight. I'm pretty sure their beers are great but, tonight, it just didn't compliment my foods. Just to give you a heads up, I only order IPAs, porter, and stouts. \\n\\nRestaurant Experience: The staff was very kind! Also, the restaurant was very nice. Wasn't able to find a table at the self seating bar so we had to sit in the restaurant, which is fine because I prefer seats that have a back. We only waited 15-20 minutes before we were seated (this is on a Wednesday night). \\n\\nOverall, I'd most definitely recommend people to try this place out.

This block of stores is definitely worth visiting at least once even if you don't have a passion for old furniture.  Take for example the bright orange sectional sofa with purple accents that was sitting outside when I ventured by.  \\n\\nMost of the items you'll find here are not as shocking as the orange couch, but they do have character and charm.  Some pieces are more expensive than others and might not be for everyone.  For example, also sitting out in front, there were two plush black, white and red chairs that looked like they would go well in a play room.  These fun and playful chairs were each marked $700 though which seemed shocking to me considering their style.  On the intriguing side, they had 2 turquoise movie seats for sale that appeared to have been constructed in a different era.  They were distinctive and very cool to see and each chair was marked $195.\\n\\nInside the items were less vibrant and more artsy.  Even though I'm sure most of the items are considered antique, some felt almost modern and chic.  There was a great presence of pieces that would match an art deco inspired home.  Wrought iron furniture and large mirrors were also notable to me and mostly very beautiful.  Lamps and other lighting fixtures were in attendance and marked a different decade--the 1960s maybe?\\n\\n Not because I don't enjoy them, but I am not an antique person.

I mean the C&C was good but it did not compare to the BSB for me. \\n\\nWe also got their Tomato Bisque Soup which was just ok and a order of fries to share. The fries were nice and crisp but a little on the salty side which we didn't mind because we had just come back from hiking. \\n\\nThe service was good. The girl at the counter was friendly and nice along with the people that delivered our food to our table. Overall a very friendly and relax place. \\n\\nI will definitely be back for the BSB if I'm ever in Portland again! :)"},{"name":"Bukowski Tavern","address":"1281 Cambridge St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3","text":"Our server was awesome !!

The \\"white guy behind the sushi counter\\" is, at least in my opinion, actually one of the more skilled sushi chefs in the city.  He is extremely well-schooled, skilled with the knife, informed and very innovative.  And honestly, I am not sure I have ever seen \\"sole, cod, pollock, lingcod\\" on any sushi menu in town.  Cooked, certainly, but not sushi.  Would love to see it, but I am guessing those varieties are less suitable for sushi.  \\n\\nHowever , what you WILL often get at Bara are rarely-seen items for Portland.  Last week it was Tasmanian Sea Trout, which was delicious and the specials list quite often reveals  great selection of rarer Hawaiian (like Kampachi) cuts and Far East fish, live shellfish, too.  I find it really fun and interesting to sample the rarely seen items, and in fairness, there are a lot of Northwest items on the menu here, but the bonus is the abundance of fresh specials frequently flown in.\\n\\nOne complaint.  Upon subsequent visits, these days we seldom get the same sushi chef at the counter.  A couple of the guys are REALLY skilled, but last time the guy was rushed, somewhat sloppy in presentation and not up to the usual standard.  What gives on the apparent high turnover or unpredictability on Saturday night dining?"},{"name":"Krishnas' Dosa Grill","address":"8910 120 Street","city":"Surrey","stars":"4","text":"Honestly would not even give it 1 star, this place is so dirty and not welcoming at all.

Beer snobs need to be reminded:  The primary purpose of good craft beer (or any beer) is to be drinkable.  Bottom line, Deschutes makes a wide spectrum of beers that are drinkable and appeal to many pallates.  When combined with good pub burgers, a great location, and unique decor, you've got a winner.\\n\\nFood & Drink:\\n\\nThe menu is diverse, though the feature presentation here is probably the burgers or \\"sandwiches). Both the black butte and porter burger are consistently juicy and good.  At $12.00 to $14.00 you're paying a bit of a premium but it's a good sized burger and the fries (or salad) that you're going to select with it will fill you up.  The hot-corned beef, which is kind of set up like a reuben, is lean and has a good mixture of sweet/sour flavors.  I can also endorse the halibut and chips (quality fish and very tasty breading) as well as the mac and cheese.  I have yet to try to personally try the pasta, ribs or the ribeye--though I've been told that the ribs are good but the pasta and ribeye are probably the two weakest items on the menu.\\n\\nIn terms of starters the salads and soups rate as above average for a pub due to freshness and variety.  They are also decent sized.  There's nothing here that I'd steer you away from, though I can't speak to the beer cheese soup--simply not something that I'm willing to try just yet.  At price points ranging from $6.00 to $14.00 (the high end to add chicken/salmon to a salad) the value seems about right.  \\n\\nPro Move:  Try the Deschutes porter mustard on the table for anything that you can see going with mustard--good stuff. \\n\\nIf you haven't gotten to try much of Deschute's work you're in for a treat.  Deschutes piles up tons of World and American Beer Awards (the hallway to the restrooms will illustrate that).  Like almost all breweries I'd suggest getting a taster flight versus diving right in.  A couple of thoughts:\\n\\n1.  Mirror Pond is an easy to drink (only slightly bitter) Pale Ale\\n2.  Black Butte is a mild inoffensive Porter (ones with roman numerals are more complex) but if you like dark beer I'd steer you towards The Abyss\\n3.  Red Chair is an easy drinking fall/winter seasonal (American Pale) that regularly piles up more awards/hardware than Peyton Manning or Tom Brady\\n4.  Twilight (Summer Ale) is an under-the-radar very good summer seasonal\\n5.  Fresh Squeezed is a good IPA if you like citrus\\n\\nSix 4oz samplers are only going to run you $8.00 so you'll get to try a wide variety at a reasonable price.  When going taster flight here I'd personally steer you towards the \\"Brewmaster's Choice\\" as most of the standard Deschutes beers you can pick up elsewhere.  The Brewmaster's Choice will be beers not typically sold elsewhere and ones that are more unusual.  A must try if you enjoy craft beers.\\n\\nAmbiance & Service:\\n\\nSet in downtown Portland, it's in a busy area.  Pro Move: If you've got some time check out the giant bookstore (Powell's) nearby.  That said, while the location is great, I'd still advise you to sit inside and avoid the outdoor tables--unless you like getting accosted/harassed by some of the more colorful Portland folk.\\n\\nInside you can tell the place was craft by, and for, guys--lots of iron, wood carvings, and exposed beams.  It has almost a new-age lodge feel.  That said it isn't uninviting.  The wood is a lighter color, the amount of people give it life, and the large windows keep it from seeming claustrophobic.   \\n\\nA couple items I will ding which prevent a five star review:\\n\\n1.  The bar is too small--especially for a brewery\\n2.  The TVs are poorly located/set-up\\n3.  Place can get loud as you don't have many dividers or rugs\\n4.  The wait time is crazy, especially on weekends\\n5.  You sometimes feel like it's over-commercialized (surrounded by shirts/growlers/glassware et.)\\n\\nFinal Thoughts:\\n\\nIt's hard to find fault with a public-house that well placed downtown, with a wide array of in-house beer types (including seasonals), and excellent burgers (and other pub food).  If you want more hoppy/interesting beer I'm sure many Portland faithful will direct you to Hopworks.  If you're looking for more complex non-pub food I'm sure some would tell you Burnside Brewing.  They're not wrong (all are good choices), but for a blend of good in-house beer and pub food, Deschutes is an excellent choice.\\n\\n-AC"},{"name":"Oga's Japanese Cuisine","address":"915 Worcester St","city":"Natick","stars":"4","text":"This place's food is so good.

Bummer, but c'es le vie!\\n\\nI finally made it successfully there one Sunday afternoon, which was great for me since street parking is free then.  Although it would seem that their grounds has parking available, most of those spots are claimed by specific neighboring businesses, so I didn't want to risk a ticket.\\n\\nSeveral parties had already filled much of the front dining space by the entrance.  We placed our order at the counter, found ourselves a seat at one of the 4 tables set along the hall towards the back dining space (where there is also a ladies' room available) and waited for our lunch to be delivered to us.\\n\\nWhite meat chicken is what they hawk here and that is what we had in the Charbroiled Chicken Plate $9.99 listed under Jake's Delights on the menu.  It comes served with one of the exotic rices, salad, tahini & pita.  I inquired and was told that their exotic rice choices by order of popularity were sweet, tomato & onion, lentil & raisin, cherry.  So sweet it was!\\n\\nI found the rice on the slightly wet/mushy side, but still, I enjoyed the pleasantly sweet taste with my moist enough chicken.  Salad was salad, but there two dual pieces of each type of pickle laid out nicely on top.\\n\\nWe also tried their falafel (the fellow at the counter seemed awfully proud of it) in the form a roll up with hummus (I figure that meant that we ended up with Jake's Famous (Falafel [Chickpeas, herbs and Persian spices ground and cooked into golden spheres ] & Hummus) $7.99, which per our special request they kindly sliced in half for us.

While I found the grilled onions and red and green bell peppers to be juicy, and both wraps stuffed generously with the named ingredients alongside fresh leafy greens, shredded carrots, sliced tomatoes and pickles, I came to the realization that perhaps wraps were not the ideal choice for take-out.  The pita became slightly sodden and broke apart in places.\\n\\nInstead, I suggest ordering the wraps for eating in, and a plate for take-out."},{"name":"Sckavone's","address":"4100 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I've probably been here 10x over the past few years.

Their menu looked big with lots of good selections to try...so we thought. \\n\\nIt's in a great location and the decor is nicely done.  We were sat right away, but the hostesses barely made eye contact and were not very friendly.  First weird thing is that they have no drink menu.  I get that their beers are seasonal, but nothing to read over.  Really?  We had to listen to the waitress ramble off a long list of beers before making a selection and having no idea what the price was.  First red flag!\\n\\nI ordered the cheese fondue with beer sausage and the walnut pear salad.  The cheese sauce for the fondue was little like water with cheese flavor in it.  It barely even coated the bread cubes or sausage before running off onto the plate, table or all over my lap.  And my salad, was not even edible.  It looked and tasted like they had drowned it in the dressing and let is sit in the fridge for a couple weeks before throwing it a plate to serve.  So much dressing it turned the pears and what little cheese there was on the salad red.  The waitress did notice that I barely touched it and after I explained to her the problem she offered to remove it from our tab.  My husband got the burger which was definitely a frozen patty before going on the grill.  Our tab was almost 50 bucks with my appetizer, salad, and one short cocktail,then my husbands burger and beer.  Way over priced for mediocre food.  Will definitely not be going back or recommending!

My sister had just flown back home from college in Chicago, so she was ready for some upscale, cool, non-college-budget, Texas food. So naturally we went to Jack Allen's! Tacos, queso, fries, burgers, all the goods of Texas with a cooler flair, right? Well It's not as good as we thought.\\n\\nWe get there after calling ahead about the wait (we were told it was only a few minutes). We get there and the hostess tells us it won't be long at all. (Cool! We'll just chill by the door). Well. Another group walks in behind us and gets seated immediately. Then another. We confront the hostess and she acts as though she had never seen us before. She tells us a man will seat us shortly. 5 minutes later he walks over and gives us a once-over, as if he was judging our middle-class appearance (he had just seated two groups of finely-dressed diners). But he led us to our table, finally, and told us our waitress would be there shortly.\\n\\nWe wait ten minutes for a waitress to come over. And BOY was she an airhead. She takes our 4 drink orders, and my parents both order margaritas in addition. She comes back with 4 drinks, two waters, two teas, and speeds off without a word to my parents about their late drinks. She comes back about 5 minutes later with only my mom's drink. My dad tries to get her attention, but she doesn't notice his raised hand and attempted eye-contact. My dad is now angry, and you don't get my dad upset, no sir.\\n\\nShe comes back to take our appetizer orders (this is about 15 minutes into our meal. Bit later than should be expected), and we order the fries, the barbacoa stackers, and three oysters with remoulade. My dad stops her before she can speed off again and asks about his drink, and she says \\"oh? You ordered a drink? I didn't hear you. How weird. I'm sorry about that.\\" and she speeds off again. She comes back with his drink (it's on the rocks instead of frozen like he asked, but he's tired of waiting and just deals with it). When ol' airhead comes back, she places the appetizers on the table and acts like she'd done us an amazing favor by bringing them over based on her attitude and appearance of accomplishment and pride. I've never seen a more pathetic waitress at a supposedly gourmet restaurant.\\n\\nOn the up-side the fries are amazing. NEVER HAD BETTER. Red chili rubbed, with some kind of white cotija cheese and cilantro on top. Garlic aoli for dipping. Those were damn good. The barbacoa stackers were also quite tasty and we split them up by halves amongst ourselves. On the down-side: the oysters. They were awful. Weirdest oysters we've had. My sister, dad, and I each had one. Remoulade roasted on to an oyster? It was unpleasantly harsh tasting. Really bad remoulade. \\n\\nAirhead came back for our meal orders. I got a salad, as did my sister and my mom. My dad got some tacos I believe. The salad sounded good on paper, but the cornnuts were far too crunchy. My mom and sister agreed. I thought I was going to break off one my braces brackets. Yes. They were THAT hard. My dad's meal was sub-par this evening. I can't recall what exactly he ate. Whatever it was, it wasn't memorable.\\n\\nAfter completing our meals, we waited for her to clear the table. Ten minutes go by. Still no sign of her. We then stack up our own plates and put them on  the very edge of the table for her to see. Finally we wave her down for the check and she takes the bowls and goes \\"well y'all did a great job cleaning off those plates, huh? Victory over that food!\\" as if we were all morbidly obese. It was a very unusual. (FYI, we're all around 20 BMI. She's probably a 17...). She brought the check. We pay it. Wait another extended period of time for her to come over and pick it up. Thankfully she brought it back in a speedy fashion, and we left.\\n\\nIN CONCLUSION (ohh middle school english paper-esque paragraph connections), the food is pretty darn good if you order the right things. The service SUCKS. I am so disappointed. So. So. Disappointed. The ambiance is soft and romantic, yet rustic, which was nice though. Order the fries and something deep-fried. And some barbacoa stackers. Your waiter may be an inexperienced bimbo though. So beware. Overall, i'd have given them 4 or so stars if they wait staff was good."},{"name":"Joy Cafe","address":"1100 Peachtree St NE, Ste 110","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Soooo.

All of the five stars reviews are no joke - this place definitely lives up to expectations!  \\n\\nFor coffee, there's a huge variety of iced and hot varieties, and they're flavored beans rather than just syrup or some other artificial flavoring.  The french vanilla is very tasty, but the banana hazelnut is the hidden gem and my go-to order - it's just a subtle hint of banana and is the perfect weekend treat. It's up there with the best coffee I've ever had. Kushala Sip down the road is good, but it just doesn't compare to Java Grind.\\n\\nIn terms of food, this is good, solid breakfast fare. I'm a bit of a breakfast snob having worked in a breakfast/lunch joint through high school, and Java Grind meets my high expectations.  The omelets have been perfectly cooked with tons of filing - no skimping here. My wife has gotten a few different varieties of breakfast sandwiches and has enjoyed each one. We haven't tried the pancakes or french toast yet, but they look huge and fluffy. \\n\\nAside from the coffee and great food, the service is top-notch. The owner (unfortunately don't know his name) takes his time to make sure your order is exactly right and to let you know of all your options, even when busy. He is non-stop motion, working the register, taking phone orders (always offering to go above and beyond to accommodate any need), waiting tables and checking on patrons. His sister, and I believe co-owner, works in the kitchen on weekends cranking out dine-in and take-out orders just as quickly. A free coffee every 5 trips definitely isn't a bad perk either!\\n\\nThe only suggestion I have is that they consider bringing in a waiter/food runner on the weekends. As the positive reviews pile up and word-of-mouth spreads, we've noticed Java Grind getting busier and busier on the weekends, and it might alleviate some of the wait time if there was separate counter and table service. Not a huge deal, just be prepared for a bit of wait during busy weekend times.\\n\\nOverall, a great local business that we will keep coming back to again and again!"},{"name":"Banger's Sausage House & Beer Garden","address":"79 81 & 81.5 Rainey St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Sausages with Grits, Sausages that are made of turkey, chicken, hamburgers, I was in sausage heaven and the presentation, I didn't want to eat it, Itvwas beautiful!"},{"name":"House Blend Cafe","address":"10730 W Colonial Dr","city":"Ocoee","stars":"4.5","text":"Why does Yelp say its closed today?

We had Wonton Noodle Soup, Beef stir fry with flat bold rice noodles and Salt n Pepper Calamari (Squid).\\n\\nThe flavor was good.  The Squid, slightly over cooked, it was a bit chewy.  The Wonton's itself, were a bit salty, however the soup base was bland.  So, it balanced out.  The best dish was the Beef Noodles.  Overall it was a good dining experience.  \\n\\nThe only downside, it seems like some of the servers, busser/food runner persons, act a bit like they're shy to come to the table.

She bitchingly said that that is all they serve so therefore it is the \\"Regular\\". As a beertender at Bukowski's, she should know that there is a \\"Regular\\" version of the 2 X's lager.\\n\\nLater I ordered a Tecate which came out to four bucks and change.

Actually, truth to tell, the service has always been good. Friendly to a fault, which is more than enough in our book to forgive occasional lapses in pacing dishes coming out of the kitchen. But while our first meal there not long after they opened was \\"meh\\", and our subsequent meals solid (if unremarkable), our latest dinner was quite good. We like the new menu, the new chef, and the emphasis on fresh regionally-sourced ingredients.\\n\\nTonight I ordered rather idiosyncratically and on the light side - having had a fairly substantial breakfast and lunch. Just the oysters (from Cape Cod and excellent) and their version of the now ubiquitous beet salad (with mustard, labneh, lemon zest and pomegranate seeds). But the spousal unit was so hungry she ordered both an app (a very interesting green salad with almond butter) and a main (the butter-poached lobster with johnny cakes and berries - which was a big win on the flavor front). She also got her socks knocked off by their powerful Planter's Punch, while I remained relatively abstemious with an American pilsner.\\n\\nDessert was also very good. A blueberry crostini with (probably house-made) vanilla ice cream. Downnotes were minor. We would have liked some bread to start - or something starchy to go with the tasty house-made pickles they put on the table in small crocks. And - due to a broken espresso maker and the resultant unavailability of frou-frou euro-coffee - the decaf coffee was too harsh for primetime, and too big to finish.\\n\\nWe definitely plan to return in the near future and check in on their progress. Especially since we heard Brother Cleve has joined the staff. And that's just ... you know ... cool.\\n\\nBut I do feel impelled to note that this Yelp page has been infested of late by a person or persons that have a real ax to grind with First Printer. And I find it highly problematic that the much-vaunted Yelp review filter has failed to flag several attack reviews being posted by people with only a few (or one) reviews under their virtual belts. A number of which appear to be written by the same person using sockpuppet accounts SINCE THEY ALL FEATURE LOTS OF OPPROBRIUM IN ALL CAPS. Others seem far too detailed to have been written by a casual diner looking to highlight some (perceived) offense to their palate, hygenic standards, and/or personhood. And all of the offending reviews are clearly exaggerated at best and fabricated at worst.  \\n\\nWhatever bad blood might have been generated by the recent staff turnover, that's no excuse for trashing the place in the guise of real reviewers. If these faux-reviewers have some dirt on First Printer that the public really needs to know, then they should take it to local news publications and bring all relevant info into the light of day.\\n\\nBut if ex-employees or potential competitors (two of which are within a block of First Printer) just want to use Yelp and other social media to spread enough disinformation to sink the place while hiding behind fake identities, then I call shenanigans.

This review concerns the location in Tucker located on the intersection of Lawrenceville HWY and Fellowship RD. \\n\\nThe building itself is nothing much to look at. It's a rather old with a blue roof, that as one user pointed out, resembles a converted fast food restaurant. The interior is small and unremarkable with several tables and booths on one end.

One jack wagon customer was too lazy to take his used plate with crumbled up napkins and plastic utensils the required 10 feet from the chair to the garbage. I mean, seriously, do people really think it's standard in a restaurant like this to eat your food, get up and leave the trash on the table?\\n\\nNow, to the reason I came here and you should, too. The food. It's really good. I've actually only had the gyro as while there are other items on the menu that look delicious, I'm currently indulged on a fix on such a sandwich and not ready to try something new just yet. It's not the best gyro I've ever had, but it's definitely good, affordable and made very quickly. It is what you'd expect - roasted lamb meat served in warm pita bread, with tomatoes, onions and \\"Grecian Sauce.\\" I don't think it's Tzatziki - at least I can't taste any cucumber or yogurt in it.

Appetizers are decent. Some lack on the flavor, but some are unique and have some nice depth to them. The skillet cornbread is one of their unique dishes that is packed with flavor. The artichoke hearts and calamari are mildly bland though. The ambiance of this place is awesome: they have a beautiful biergarten patio and the service is fantastic. \\n\\nThe reason I'm giving them 3 stars is for the lack of consistency in their food. I often order the smoked pork tenderloin with a cherry madeira sauce and bacon arugula risotto. Some days, the pork is perfectly cooked, others,  it's very dry or untrimmed. Some days, the risotto is perfectly cooked and others, it's got some crunchy pieces of rice or too much arugula. Some days, the sauce is smooth and velvety and rich, and others, it's watery and bland. You get good parts of a dish depending on who's in the kitchen that day.

However with the orders placed I was back to being excited to try this food. How could a place with Chili in the name not have amazing chili I thought. Well kudos to you guys because you did it. I will say the queso, while extra runny, was good. However everything was horrible. The food was all just room temperature. My chili cheeseburger had a meat patty that was smaller than the dollar hamburger at McDonalds. The mac and cheese was identical to a kraft box flavor. The guacamole chalupa was literally just a tostada. I do not mean figuratively, it was actually on a flat, hard tortilla shell. The chips were I'm pretty sure just the dollar store brand version of ruffles. But most disappointing was the actual chili. It was cold and so bland. It had three big chunks of beef. On their own the meat was tasty, however with the sauce I was eating a pot roast with gravy on top. The chili sauce (gravy more appropriate) was like I was eating the beef flavored sauce that is left at the bottom of a crock pot when you cook a roast. It was as much a chili, even Texas chili for those who will want to whine and defend how its different, as I am; as this place deserves anywhere close to 4 stars. The food was cheap which helped soften the blow but still honestly by far the worst food I have had in my 2+ years in Austin. And I eat at Taco Bell at least once a week so I am far from picky.

Strong start.\\n\\nSecond course was a salad with pickled apricots and crispy fried pig ear slices. This was probably my favorite dish of the night. The salad alone would have just been average, but the addition of pig ear made it very different and interesting.\\n\\nThird was the roasted snapper with semolina gnocchi and a bean and pistashio mash. The fish was okay. I wish it was pan seared instead of roasted though to give the dish some more texture. Soft fish plus mashed beans (which weren't very good) and a soft gnocchi kinda make for a boring dish texture wise. The gnocchi was more like a fried polenta cake.\\n\\nFourth was a piece of NY steak with a succotash (more beans?) and a fried green tomato.

The prices are still amazing, especially for downtown, and for that, I will continuing coming here once in a while, but I've found that I'm no longer a regular. \\n\\nFirst off, the service is sub-par. The servers are really nice, don't get me wrong, but they just seem to be all over the place. My orders would get mixed up with others, and they would forget to bring food out until I remind them. Today the speed was okay, but other times that I would come here for lunch, I'd wait 45 minutes to get my food. Totally not okay if you're on a schedule or if you're looking to impress. Luckily my company today were also good friends so it was no big deal. \\n\\nOnto the food. I ordered off one of the lunch special sheets where you pick from 3 items that came with a free item (choose from miso soup, rice, ice cream etc) for $11.99. I chose tuna sashimi (3 pieces), nigiri combo (a piece each of tuna, salmon and chopped scallop), and a chopped scallop roll. The miso soup was brought over right away and it was just your average miso soup, nothing special. The tuna sashimi arrived first and I was very happy with this. Each piece was very thick and it was fresh enough so I was pretty happy. Next came my 3 pieces of nigiri. I couldn't seem to pick up the pieces with my chopstick as the rice kept coming apart from the fish so I just ended up eating them separately. I couldn't put my finger on what it was until my chopped scallop roll came. You can tell just from looking at it that the rolls were formed really poorly. The seams were coming undone and the rice was pretty disappointing. The pieces of rice were not nicely packed together and you can see the nori poking through, and it was pretty sparse. No wonder my nigiri pieces were coming apart - it was due to the rice. \\n\\nYes, it was a cheap lunch and the food wasn't necessarily bad, but I've had better sushi for similar prices at other places downtown. The only reason I come here for lunch is because you can actually order sashimi for lunch for a great price, but just stay away from any rolls or nigiri."},{"name":"Cakes & Ale","address":"155 Sycamore St","city":"Decatur","stars":"3.5","text":"I agree with Paul's assessment.  The atmosphere of this place is very cool.  I loved the chalkboard menus, and I like that there are only a handful of dishes to choose from.  There is nothing wrong with a kitchen concentrating on a small selection of good items.  \\n\\nHowever, I felt like the food was very overpriced.  I was not wowed by my entree, the gnocchi, and I definitely did not feel like it was worth $18.  My boyfriend ordered the trout, and his was far and away better than mine.  The chicken looked delicious, but $24??? Come on, chicken is one of the least expensive things a restaurant can get, even if it is local and organic.  The wine selection was good, again overpriced but what wine in a restaurant isn't?  \\n\\nOur server was very nice, but a little over-eager to please and a tad bit awkward.  She was knowledgeable about the menu, but her recommendations were not a hit with our table.  Overall, the food was good, but not good enough for what they charge.  My impression of this place is that they don't quite know what kind of restaurant they want to be.

It's a small restaurant, but the ambiance was good. Dimly lit and cozy. The Max runs by every few minutes, but once you  get to the point where you don't pay attention to it, the place becomes much more enjoyable. I ordered paneer in a Punjabi sauce and a sweet Lassi. I didn't know what to expect as there was no description of the Punjabi sauce. It was a spicy, tomato based curry without any cream (unlike some of the other tomato based curries I've had at various Indian restaurants) and it was quite tasty.  My boyfriend wound up ordering a dish with a very similar sauce, which was a bit disappointing, but what can you do? Indian menus are had (at least for us) to navigate. \\n\\nI received a mango lassi by accident, which was good. The waitress realized I got the wrong one and gave me a sweet lassi as well as let keep the mango one. The sweet Lassi was delicious! Better than the mango. \\n\\nAll in all, it was a pretty good experience. Not the best Indian food I've ever had, but definitely pretty good. The waitress was attentive and very nice."},{"name":"Mister Tramps","address":"8565 Research Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Last night, I wanted to watch football.

While visits in the past have proved ok for food, the visit we had yesterday 3/9/13 was anything but ok. First thing I have to say is NS needs to decide what their rules are regarding the ages of people allowed in. For the last two years our family has gone here for lunch and/or dinner and have never had an issue with getting in with my daughter who is under 21, however last year mid B's season we were turned away due to her age. The guy working the door said no one under 21 allowed and that it has always been that way, not true! I did write to the manager and was told this was a misunderstanding on the door mans part but that she was allowed in, which was quite evident in the past seeing that there were quite a few kids in their gathered around the video game machine. \\n\\nFast forward to the playoffs last year and we were then told that no she couldn't come in during playoff games....make up your mind. Yesterday we went there for lunch and were able to get in no problem, within 15 minutes of seating the same doorman came to the front door area and was turning people away with people who couldn't produce an id yet if the person was clearly a minor say teenager with parents they could get in. The management needs to make a decision one way or another, you cannot discriminate against one person for being 20 and not having an id and then let a family with an 16 year old walk right in and get a seat. We watched this happen the whole time we were there and it was beyond frustrating.\\n\\nOn to the food, in the past the food has been good, my favorite item being the French Dip Sandwich. Yesterday when our party of 8 arrived around 1130am we were promptly seated in a large booth that we were told sat 8, however we were so squashed in that we could barely lift our arm up to drink our drinks or use our forks. We asked to be moved but were told it was the only seat that could accommodate us, this to wasn't  true since it was completely dead when we arrived. We all began to order and I got my usual French Dip, when the sandwich arrived it was cold! Normally the french roll is toasted, the meat is hot and the cheese is melted...not today. The bread wasn't toasted, the meat was cold out of the fridge and the cheese was just placed on top without the slightest hint it was warmed at all. The sauce served on the side was lukewarm and the fries were cold as well, what a huge disappointment. The worst part was the waitress never returned to ask us how things were, I left my plate barely touched thinking when she finally did return she would wonder what was wrong...nope!\\n\\nWhile I used to really enjoy NS, there are plenty of other places to go in the area that know their policy on age and do not adjust it daily.

One remarkable thing that I did notice in our most recent visit that made me quite sad was that they now serve their drinks in these very cute and tropical mugs that serve one true purpose: to make it appear as though your drink is much more substantial than it is.

It was crusty and tasted as if it were \\"redone\\" or \\"corrected\\" with something old and leftover. :-( Also, the staff--some sketchy young guy and another thirty-something-year-old male--had been smirking as they took almost *fifteen minutes* to prepare and hand me my order.\\n\\nNow, I won't go so far as to accuse them of putting some unwanted bodily fluids in my burger--it was nothing like that--but as quiet as I was at the time, I was fuming inside over their off-putting attitude and was *especially* disappointed with my food.\\n\\nA few weeks later, I somehow decided to try this Wendy's again. After all, my dad has said that he'd sometimes grab a quick meal here during his law school days in the '80s, and so for my family, it has somewhat of a sentimental value.\\n\\nThis time, the guy behind the register was an older fellow with a bitter disposition, and he obviously wanted to be elsewhere. He was silent as he took my order. He proceeded to let out a *very* audible sigh when I suddenly remembered--and politely but swiftly requested--that I didn't want ice in my lemonade just as he'd already scooped ice into my cup.\\n\\nLook; I know that employment in a fast food joint doesn't enjoy the same level of respect as a desk job. Its stigmatization is so unfortunate, because I think all restaurant jobs--although many take place in more high-end settings than others--require a similar degree of tenacity and adhere to the same basic tenets expected of all respectable service workers.\\n\\nWith that said, I have to reiterate the crucial fact that the image of one individual employee directly reflects the image of the larger company for which he or she works. His or her service may also affect psychologically the customer's reception of any food that company serves, although my burger and lemonade turned out fine that time.\\n\\nSo, I gave this Wendy's yet *another* chance this past week, and this time a very nice guy--maybe an international student in his late twenties?--rang up my order for a Junior Bacon Cheeseburger and a cup for water. (Out of curiosity, he also asked me whether I'm Korean--a question that I tend to get a lot in Ohio. Again, I'M AMBIGUOUSLY FILIPINO.) I think the older guy from the first incident I mentioned in this review was also there again, same old smirk and all. This time, though, my meal again tasted just as I'd hoped it would.\\n\\nI assure you that I've had prior dining experiences at this Wendy's that were quite pleasant, and so I hope it doesn't fall short again!

A friend was visiting from out of town and both of us being foodies, there were a list of restaurants in Austin I wanted to take her to. Her first night here, I chose Apothecary because it is very close to where I live (we didn't have much time before a concert we were headed to), I hadn't yet been and I'd heard good things. My friend and I arrive around 7:75 PM on a Friday and are seated in a pretty empty restaurant. We were a little overdressed as we were headed to a concert afterward, and we both felt the restaurant staff glaring at us as they brought us to our table. We sat down, took a look at the wine menu and ordered two glasses of wine. \\n\\nThe server asked us for our driver's licenses and we handed them to him. While I live in Austin, I have not yet had an opportunity to get my Texas driver's license changed from a Florida one and my visiting friend still lives there. He looked at our IDs and then started walking away with them. My friend asked \\"where are you going?\\" and the server said he needed to take another look at them and show them to his manager. Mind you, both of us are 28 years old, so while we found it strange, we were not too worried. After he went over to the bar, we sort of giggled amongst ourselves at how strange it was as we watched him and his female manager scrutinize over our IDs. \\"I guess we should take it as a compliment?\\" we joked. So you can imagine how dumbfounded we were when the next thing we know, the manager comes over to our table and lets us know that they can not serve us the glasses of wine we ordered because they could not verify that our IDs were legitimate! Remind you, we are 28 years old, they were not expired and there was absolutely nothing wrong with either of our IDs! Her excuse was that both of our IDs seemed \\"bent\\". Anyone with a Florida ID knows that these very rigid cards tend to often form a slight bend just above the swipe strip over time (probably due to the way they're made somehow). However, both of our IDs are in great shape and would certainly not be considered damaged. The \\"bend\\" she referred to is almost unnoticeable. However, even if they was very bent, they are legitimate IDs! \\n\\nNeedless to say, we were dumbfounded. Neither of us have EVER experienced this before (and I travel all over the country 2-5 times per month for work).  I asked her if she had a driver's license scanner so she could test them and prove they were legitimate. She simply said no and stared at us. It was obvious that we were getting nowhere with her and they didn't want our business. I asked for our IDs back and we proceeded to walk out of the small restaurant. While we certainly did not make a scene at all, the restaurant had so few patrons that it seemed like everyone was starting at us as we walked out as if we were teenagers who had just gotten caught. I was so incredibly embarrassed to have taken my friend to a restaurant that had treated us so poorly and obviously did not want our business.

It's a shame their purpose is merely to divert attention from a lack of substance where it counts.\\n\\nHopefully for Portland's sake my experience was an exception rather than the rule.

Sausages were very tasty and the prices are very reasonable. I had the buffalo chicken sausage over salad. Yummy, but we all felt it tased nothing like buffalo chicken. However, I'd order it again because it was very tasty. Waiter was great and working his butt off but restaurant was definitely under staffed as we saw him rarely. NOW FOR THE DOWN SIDE: We waited 30 minutes for a table which was expected due to it being a Saturday night. We waited another 20 minutes for our order to be taken. Meh. Then we waited another 52 minutes (yes, we timed it) for our food to arrive. Sausages - that should have taken 10 minutes to throw in a bun. We were about to leave and hit the food trucks across the street when our food finally arrived. This day and age food should NOT take that long to come to the table, especially sausages that are already cooked/smoked and ready. This restaurant is on Rainey Street, a really hopping Austin area bustling with activity. They should be used to busy Saturday nights and should concentrate on prompt and efficient service. This will be the last place that I go again on Rainey Street which is a shame because the sausages were really good. In a nut shell...  tasty food but lacks efficient service to compete with all the other delicious restaurants nearby."},{"name":"Vendetta","address":"4306 N Williams St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"It seems people have some very strong feelings about Vendetta.

We weren't expecting the show we got and I don't mean that in a good way either lol. Most of the time the hibachi chef spent his time banging a pizza pan or his cutlery on the grill. This was neither skillful nor fun. He was also making random noises with his vocal chords that were quite awkward. He did do some cool tricks with an egg and he lit an onion on fire which was cool, but that was about it.\\n\\nThe most annoying thing was that during the beginning of the show, he had a bottle filled with clear liquid (that everyone soon figured out was sake) and he was encouraging everyone had the table to chug it as he squired it into their mouths. What is this a college frat party!?!? When we all refused he kept asking us and that felt uncomfortable. He also had this weird device to squirt water at us. It was a boy who pulled down his pants as you squeezed him and he squirted water on you from his.... EWWW why? What part of any of this is remotely an Asian experience!?!? \\n\\nAs for the actual dinner, it tasted more like greasy Chinese food (of a slightly higher quality) than actual Japanese food. My friends were not impressed and they said none of this happened at other local hibachi places. I felt embarrassed I took them here. Save your money and go to a better hibachi place in the area.

That being said with the world at our disposal thanks to grandma the babysitter we set off to conquer wherever we ended up in a 2 hour period. We debated on dropping some serious dollars at the fancy place out on the bend; but opted for the cheaper route as multiple friends had been raving about Jack Allen's Kitchen.\\n\\nThe dining room and the bar were almost full at 5:30 when we arrived; a welcome sign that Oak Hill and neighboring Bee Cave is fueling the dining scene. Considering that Jim's has the seniority in the area any restaurant that adds some additional sparkle is more than welcome. I have to weigh in on the door as most folks have; I miss it too. A minimal yet probably expensive remodel with a covered patio and some barnwood accents and this place was ready for Jack Allen's creations.\\n\\nWith happy hour in full swing we hit the appetizers with full throttle. The guacamole with toasted pumpkin seeds was delicious. There must be a silo of avocados in the back! So I know that probably 80% of restaurants in Austin serve the same dish with a different or similar twist; but this version was chunky and worthy of a try.\\n\\nI moved on to the bacon wrapped quail while the wife sampled the fish tacos. The quail while tasty was a bit of a disaster on the plate. All chopped up and wrapped with bacon; I longed for a whole bird that was cooked just a tad less. The fig and micro green garnish gently accented the gamey flavor of the dish. The fish tacos nudged our experience again in the right direction. Gently grilled fish, more avocado, and pico with corn tortillas was a winner. \\n\\nThe red chile fries was a winner for me while the wife really didn't care for them. She felt the same way about the JAK's slaw that accompanied the fish tacos. Mayo based everything she deduced without the bite of vinegar and salt in any of the dishes we sampled. We ended up trying the fried catfish which we both liked even with the jalapeno tartar sauce. What else do you serve fried fish with? \\n\\nFor a first visit, Jack Allen's warrants 3 stars and I will be back for a dinner round. I had a tad O food envy seeing dishes fly by destined for other tables and the menu descriptions and ingredients sound intriguing.

We also ordered seconds for the Beef Bulgogi Lettuce Wraps.

EVERY WEEKEND! (although we've missed the last few)\\n\\nOnce again the Original Dinerant outdoes my expectations!\\n\\nThe waitstaff and management are always on point. Max is without a doubt the best Manager I've seen in a restaurant setting and to the owners of the Original, if he hasn't gotten a raise in the last few months, HE DESERVES ONE! He always spends time and makes people feel welcome as well as goes above and beyond to insure the customer's happiness and satisfaction, but more so their fulfillment. And isn't that what we all want in life? More than happiness or satisfaction, we all want to be fulfilled.\\n\\nSo let me tell you about the little things that are fulfilling to me as a single-Dad.\\n\\nThey are things like getting a french toast breakfast for my daughter on Valentine's Day that is not only the best tasting french toast I have personally ever had (yes I stole a few bites), but it being a serving size more than one thin piece of bread cut in half. Two big thick pieces of French toast cut in half. It was the perfect serving size for her, minus my few bites. She wasn't full but wasn't hungry for anything afterwards except a few stolen bites of my hash browns. It's also things like our waitress and even other waitresses, coming to comment on my daughters Original Dinerant T-Shirt and converse with HER, not me.\\n\\nFor my part in this Valentine's Day brunch, I had the steak and eggs. It came with hash browns and toast as well. The toast choices included a gluten free option. Now let me just tell you from numerous experiences with restaurant experiments in gluten-free, I'm very hesitant to order anything gluten free from a menu. But, the gluten free bread that's made in-house at the original, is soft and chewy with a slightly more dense consistency then your normal everyday bread filled with empty pockets of air. It was a surprisingly good gluten free bread which I will order every time we're there for breakfast. The steak was cooked to a true medium rare, and it was incredible. I don't know exactly what spices aside from salt and pepper the chef used, but it was perfectly savory, again perfectly cooked, and well worth the inexpensive price of $12 or $13 compared to other $20 to $25 breakfasts at other establishments.\\n\\nTo close this shorter than normal review I'll simply say that my Daughter and I have a regular brunch date paned now at the Original Dinerant. That is a rare thong for me.

We ordered the meatloaf sandwich, grilled cheese with fried tomatoes and bacon, and a croque monsier. Wasn't terribly impressed by their interpretation of the croque monsier - I felt the bread was too thick and the sandwich was too heavy overall. I am typically used to thin cuts of ham that subtly sweetens the gruyere, so the thick cut of salty ham was unanticipated and not well received .. I also don't think there was a bechamel cream on this sandwich here. Oh well. The grilled cheese with fried tomatoes, however, was quite delightful. The fried tomatoes really enhanced the sandwich by adding a sour element. The meatloaf was also excellent.

Seems odd, since I have lived here (on and off) for 35 years that it would take a passing glance, or flipping channels, or my TiVo to tell me about some place amazing for brunch just up the street from me. I'm a terrible Atlantan. Well, sometimes.\\n\\nYou can call me a fan, for sure.  But I will start with the negatives. A large group of us showed up for brunch early on a Saturday - one or two of us showed up earlier than the rest and were quoted 30 to 45 minutes for 12 people. Great! However, it was more like an hour and a half before we were seated and we had told them we were okay being split into smaller tables. Don't quote a time unless that time is at least close to accurate - especially when you start seating smaller groups who came later than we did. Pretty disappointing.\\n\\nOkay, the positives. Free parking in the lot where the cafe is located. Free coffee outside while we waited (until it ran out and it was not refilled) - especially great on a cold morning. They split our checks, even though the menu said they would not do that for us (I was well-prepared to do some higher Math functions). And free pastries when we finally sat down. Score!\\n\\nI knew what I wanted to eat before I ever stepped foot into the cafe - Thanks, Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives and Instagrammers of Atlanta. I wanted the Biscuits and Sawmill Gravy with Chorizo. Done. No waffling (though I looked over the menu), I was going to have it. And that I did. First, that biscuit is seriously HUGE. I was starving and I could only eat half. The gravy was spicy, but in a good way and the crumbled, crispy chorizo on top was delightful. An excellent choice on my part, I must say.  I am curious why the biscuits are not snowy white, as one would be accustomed in the South - I should go back and watch the episode, I guess.\\n\\nThe coffee was good and I did receive a refill and the water was kept full (pretty good for one server and a table of 12). For dessert, Kristin B and I ordered the Cookies and Milk Pie. This one, I blame on our fearless CM, Jonathan T. Having posted it on Instagram and Yelp weeks earlier, I knew I had to eat it. It is the simplest of desserts, but probably one of the best I have eaten in town. Layers of homemade, unsweetened whipped cream, and chocolate chip cookies (no tree nuts). That's it - no frills, just damn good.  Get it and make sure to have some coffee.\\n\\nOverall service was great, especially considering the size of our party and the tininess of Joy Cafe. All our food came out at once, despite a warning it would not. I would definitely come here again, but probably with just a couple of friends and not a huge party,"},{"name":"Aisha Beauty Salon & Spa","address":"4118 Town Center blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"I always come here to get my eyebrows threaded.

Our waitress, Tori, only came to our table one time to tell us that they did not have any caramel syrup for dessert.  We did not even get our coffee.  On top of that, there were only about 10 people at most in the restaurant that night.  There was no excuse for this poor service.  Maybe that explains why it was not crowded there on a Saturday night.  The table next to us had a loud bunch of college students.  No effort was made by management to tell them to keep their voices down.  Perhaps they were given too much alcohol.  The problem starts with management allowing poor service to carry on to begin with.  If management is good, then the wait staff would have been more timely and efficient with service.

We wanted to share and asked if the plates were big enough and our waitress assured us they were.. she was so right! \\n\\nThe Chicken Fried Beef Ribs are actually two very large ribs with one bone removed, battered and deep fried and then covered in amazing gravy. I couldn't believe how delicious and tender they were... I didn't even have to use my knife! They were served with charred, fresh veggies and fresh mashed potatoes.\\n\\nThe Chorizo Stuffed Pork Tenderloins were very unique. They were tenderloins that appeared to be unrolled, fulled with a chorizo and stuffing mixture. The pork was then wrapped around the stuffing and they looked like large prork medallions. They came slathered in an amazing sauce with the charred veggies and potatoes as well. I really liked the flavor while the consistancy made me think of seafood....\\nvery odd but tasty nonetheless.\\n\\nWe had seen the desserts being savored at tables around us, and hoped to have room for some, but our entrees were so large and yummy that we couldn't have placed another morsel of food into our bodies.\\n\\nNot only was the food really good, but I was impressed with the attentiveness of the staff.

Has been overcooked once or twice, but usually very good\\n- Tzadziki (on very first visit)- thought it was kind of a strange option for a side \\"dish\\" but order b/c I \\n  definitely wanted some with my Gyro and pita - not necessary - they give you a\\n  small container with your order\\n-Hummus: uh Hum! So fresh, just the right amount of Tahini, great texture\\n-Tabouli: VERY fresh herbs, cracked wheat cooked perfectly\\n-Dolmathes: As expected - can order without meat in them\\n\\nThe BEST Greek food I've ever had? Maybe not, but actually pretty darn close. Great Greek food is really hard to come by.\\n\\nFor the quality, serving sizes, and price - Deserves a solid 5 star rating!\\n\\nService:\\nSuper FAST and friendly- I guess I was right about being operated similar to fast food. Walk up to counter, order all of your choices, and they prepare and box right in front of you. Seriously, this is \\"fast food?\\" Good food fast is A-OK with me!

I've had Pho in various parts of the country, and all over Austin, and even the bad Pho I had before was at least decent, and had a pho-like taste.  This was seriously bad Pho, as in I couldn't even finish it.\\n\\nI found this place on Yelp, not realizing there was another Pho place in the area of South austin.  Being lovers of Pho, my girlfriend and I decided to try it out.  When we go out for Pho, I get really excited because the mere thought of good Pho makes me crave it.  So, we were all excited when we got there.  Things started to go downhill quickly.\\n\\nThe first sign was the herbs.  They brought the herb plate out and there were only two stalks of basil, each with about two or three leaves and the leaves were wilted, rubbery, starting to turn black.  There was no cilantro (they put that in the broth already apparently), and the jalapeno was dry, more like dried jalapeno chips.\\n\\nThen the bowls came out.. 'how bad can it be?' I thought remembering our last bad Pho experience which at least satisfied our Pho craving, even though they also had wilted rubbery herbs.  I had the combo Pho (with all the meats, beef, flank, brisket, meatball).  The broth was the next sign.  Tasted like water, with only a faint hint of beef flavoring.  The meatballs were absolutely horrid.  I ended up fishing them out of the bowl after trying one.  I normally like a little spice in my Pho so I usually put one or two jalapeno slices in it.  I put all 5 slices in it, and the broth still tasted like water.  I bit into one of the jalapenos which was the only way I could get any hint of spice.\\n\\nBy this point I was desperate.  I had to do SOMETHING.  There was salt on the table... I kid you not I actually had to put salt in my Pho to add any kind of flavoring to it.  This is something I've never done in my life, salting my Pho, and it pained me to do so, but it was just that bad.\\n\\nIn the end, I left half my bowl of Pho (I usually lick the bowl clean practically) and we paid our overpriced bill and left.... still craving Pho.\\n\\nI can't believe this place is so highly rated.  Hopefully my review will help bring a dose of reality.\\n\\nFor Pho in South Austin... Dong Na is still my top pick."},{"name":"Fresa's - South 1st","address":"1703 S 1st St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Love love love this place. Dog friendly on the adorable patio.

I've not had other meals here.)\\n\\nWhen we go to dim sum, we either go east or west.  To the east lies Wongs King off 82nd, and to the west lies Jin Wah in Beaverton.  Since we live on one side and our dim sum-loving friends on the other side, we bounce back and forth between these two restaurants, and I have many opportunities to compare them.  \\n\\nIn a nutshell, Jin Wah's dim sum is a half-notch, maybe a quarter-notch, down from Wongs King's.  The differences are not big or frequent, but they are noticeable.  \\n\\nFor example, this morning at Jin Wah, the shu mai was a bit dry and only warm, rather than moist and hot.  The shrimp dumplings were tasty, but they were a bit stuck together, which suggests they were on the older side - if they had in fact been steamed in Jin Wah's kitchen, it had been done too many hours ago (yesterday?).   Another dish that was quite stuck-together was the steamed meatballs.  The potstickers were a bit bland and had not recently seen a hot pan. \\n\\nBut many of the dishes were good, and gave me nothing to quibble about.  The char siu baau (steamed buns with pork filling) were fine, the lo mai gai (lotus leaf-wrapped rice) was moist with enough meat, the pork spare ribs were tasty and juicy.  We ordered some salted squid that was quite tasty, if not a normal dim sum dish.  Overall, I'd call Jin Wah's dim sum very good by Portland standards, and at least decent by the standards of some place with a more developed Asian cuisine scene - say, the SF Bay Area.\\n\\nThere is one thing that is consistently much better about Jin Wah, compared to its rival on the east side.  No waiting!  The dining room is just the right size (from the customer's perspective).  By 11:30 AM on a weekend it is maybe 85% full, and the restaurant is doing good business, turning over the food, but they are still able to seat patrons right away and serve them quickly and well.  At Jin Wah's, 10 minutes after driving into the parking lot, I'm well into the meal.\\n\\nMeanwhile in the alternate universe where we headed to Wongs King, I'm still waiting.  And waiting.  And . . . \\n\\nI'm a fan of Jin Wah.  I've rated it three stars, until I get around to reviewing more dim sum places in town, then I'll consider whether to adjust the rating higher.  It isn't my favorite dim sum in the Portland area, but it is a pretty close second, and I'm always happy to go there and eat, rather than stand in the parking lot at The Other Place.  \\n\\nThis review is based on about 30 visits to Wongs King and maybe 15 trips to Jin Wah over three years.  I know, I could have posted a review earlier.  Maybe one of those \\"Yaay, this was my first dim sum experience ever and I loved it, XYZ is the best dim sum place in town, five stars!!! - signed, airyelphead\\" reviews.  Really, why post those?"},{"name":"Habanero Mexican Grill","address":"166 Brighton Ave","city":"Allston","stars":"4","text":"I've tried pupusas from 3 other places and this one is hands down the best pupusas so far!"},{"name":"Perkins Restaurant & Bakery","address":"6813 Sand Lake Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"This Perkins is on the ball!

I could go on about the incredible beef bulgogi, the yummy baby bok choy, or unexpected hits like the snail salad...\\n\\nBut really what I need to talk about are the braised pork ribs. Every time my pals and I come here we get these ribs and every time we conclude that it might just be the single most delicious and enjoyable-to-eat dish we've ever had. Oh my, these tender, melt-in-your-mouth braised ribs. They're served with tasty mushrooms and chewy little rice cakes, all swimming in a luscious, dark sauce that is savory-sweet-spicy with subtle hints of cinnamon. I daydream about this sauce, guys. I crave it. Often. Which is why Du Kuh Bee is the only restaurant I'll head to the 'burbs for - and I do so about every 1-2 months. It's just that good. \\n\\nSure, you can expect a wait.

I grew up below the Mason Dixon so my standards for taste and authenticity are high. Southern Proper has a nice space, and a great staff. But that's where the good ends. The menu reads like a stereotyped concept of what Southerners eat. As a result it was hard to put together a coherent meal. We selected different items to sample. Everything was okay at best. Nothing really stood out, including the cocktails. I got a piece of pie for dessert and found that it tasted like someone dipped a granola bar in mushy chocolate. It did not at all resemble the wonderful home baked pies of the South. On top of all this the restaurant for some reason BLASTED rock music. It was so incredibly LOUD my friend and I could barely understand each other. I saw other people straining to hear what guests at their tables were saying. You would get a brief moment of reprieve before the next random song came blaring out. The restaurant had a lot of diners eating outside and inside so I couldn't understand why the restaurant felt it had to add to the atmosphere with music at such an obnoxious level. My friend commented on how she would never be able to bring her relatives to the place because they would hate having to scream over music. I was hoarse when we left and my throat hurt. It seriously was that loud. My recommendation would be to check out Southern Proper only if it is convenient for you in terms of location. It isn't worth going out of your way for. My friend and I agreed that we much prefer the Frogmore (about 20 minutes away in Jamaica Plain) to Southern Proper-though the service can be spotty there. However the food and especially the cocktails are better."},{"name":"Sarpino's - Cedar Park","address":"10401 Anderson Mill Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Ordered in on our first night staying in Austin...really good pizza!

Fitting for it's location in the pearl district, this pub is decidedly more upscale, a bit pretentious, and a little \\"cold\\". I'll take the more cozy, lodgy feel of the bend pub over this any day.

I haven't tried any of the larger entrees, but everything I've seen come out of the open kitchen looks great.\\n\\nService here is pretty decent. When it gets real busy, table service can be slow (to serve) and rushed (when they are there with you).

I liked the extra effort put in to the carrots (see the pic).\\nThe salt and pepper squid was also a bit on the salty side, but perfectly cooked. Crispy, soft, and not rubbery at all. \\nThe wonton soup was rather good. As I said, it was only a small bowl... Scratch that... It was a tiny bowl.

AWESOME\\n\\nJoy cafe is located in a small shopping plaza off of Pharr Road by Frankie Allen park. Parking is an open lot and right across from Sahara hookah. First thought walking in was that the place is small, airy, and cute. Wooden chairs, white table cloths, fresh flowers and mix matched white coffee mugs gave it a super calming and unpretentious feel to this place. Even though no one greeted us, I was still fairly excited about their food. We started off with coffee and asked our server for suggestions because it was our first time. She was very kind and helpful, so we settled on the BREAKFAST BURRITOS AND BELGIAN WAFFLE with fresh berries. (Banana, raspberry, blueberry & blackberry)\\n\\nWe sat at the end corner of the restaurant, therefore I had a full view of the whole place. It was 11:20am on sunday and the place was half full (~9 tables). As we were all waiting on our food/some to order, I noticed a server dropping off some complimentary muffins to a table that just sat down next to us. I got super excited thinking we were going to get some too because we had been waiting for some time now and I was hungry. So I waited and waited and watched every table after and before us get their load of goodness. Boy was I getting bitter.\\n\\nLong story short, we were completely forgotten and felt abandoned. \\n\\nI've worked at plenty of restaurants to know what it takes to be successful front and back. You can't just depend on the food or decor to bring customers. It's about the customer's experience from beginning to finish. If you are going to announce 'out loud' that you are giving away complimentary starters, make sure you take care of everyone in the restaurant. It's fine if you(server, owner) want to take care of specific/targeted customers (It's wrong, unfair but I've seen plenty and I get it). Please be discreet about it. I don't think you want your customers to leave thinking that you only welcome certain type of people. Sigh. \\n\\nThe food:\\nThey were fresh none the less but nothing really wow'd be. Maybe I'm picky, maybe I have standards but whatever it is, the food was just ok good. I appreciate the generous amount of berries that came with my waffle and the amazing dip that came with the breakfast burrito but I think this place is still lacking their signature twist. \\n\\nI don't know what else to say... i really wanted to like this place but i guess it's just not my thing.

It was dry with cinnamon and just not enough fruit. \\n\\nThe menu is divided up into Teasers, Small bites, Small plates and Shares. We ended up getting about 8 little plates and skipped the entree section. We  started with the breadbasket which was complimentary..and amazing! Rosemary Foccacia bread with some of the best hummus I've ever had! The Olives, warm and delicious with thyme and garlic. Delicious tortellini, house made with an amazing pumpkin filling and a coconut broth. So good, I wish we got a second order! Shrimp toast was just okay for me, but my boyfriend liked it. Empanada had a beef filling, so I had to opt out since I don't eat red meat. Fish Tacos were good, but just a basic beer battered fish in a tortilla with salsa, guac and sour cream. \\n\\nThe following is my top 3 plates:\\n 3. MAC and CHEESE- wow. I had seen this mac on Phantom Gourmet and I knew I had to try it even though I don't eat bacon..I made an anniversary exception. It was like a bowl of cheese and corn chowder. Rich, delicious, salty and umami. had to wrap this bad boy up.. but as a mac and cheese lover it was up there with the best macs of all time!\\n2. CRAB CAKES- Perfectly seared crab cakes. The spicy remalaude sauce was the perfect companion to these craby little darlings. Wow, one of the best crab cakes I've ever had.\\n1. JAPANESE SEAFOOD SALAD- OMG this salad was amazing!! After all the heavy bites, this salad was a bright, light treat! Crab, shrimp, avocado, cucumber, sesame seeds..SO MUCH YUM on this plate! I basically took it over and ate every last bite. Good portion size for $12 too.\\n\\nFor desert on Jackie's recommendation we had the Churros.  These were the lightest and fluffiest I've ever tried.

As far as quality, it's basically eating grocery store sushi but at sit-down restaurant prices - so I would say it's not worth the value.  Since they rent a huge space right in the middle of the center of the mall as opposed to a counter at the food court, I'm guessing the rent ain't cheap and that's why it's kind of pricy.

My first experience wasn't amazing but I don't recall it being horrible either.  On the exterior, the place is well maintained and has an obvious Asian influence.  Parking is limited and I ended up parking on the street instead.  Upon entering, there is a bar on the left and restrooms to the right.  Hawkers serves beer, wine and sake.\\n\\nAll the tables had Chinese newspapers as the underlying decor. My server was Megan, very friendly, prompt and courteous.  She explained the menu well since there were some first-timers in the group.  The laundry list of food we ordered were the Basil Fried Rice, Siu Yoke, Pot Stickers, Hawkers' Delight, Roast Duck, Char Kway Teo, Korean Bulgogi Beef Skewers, Five Spice Fish Tacos, Roti Canai, and the Mango Sticky Rice.\\n\\n \\nI absolutely love basil. So, naturally the Basil Fried Rice appealed to me.  Overall the flavor was fine.  My friends said they thought the rice was too greasy.  I probably wouldn't use the word greasy, but it was more \\"damp\\" than how I would like my fried rice to be.  Also, the flavor of the basil was not as prevalent.  Overall, it was a good portion size.\\n\\n \\nNext up, we have the Siu Yoke. The roasted pork was served with hoisin sauce.  The pork was tender but very salty.  I don't mind salt at all, but this was just salty.  Also, the hoisin sauce didn't look right.  The sauce tasted fine but it looked like it had been warmed up.  The consistency was a bit off from the standard. At the same time, the Pot Stickers were brought out.  You can either have it steamed or pan-fried.  The Pot Stickers were decent although the sauce accompanying it, was very watery and lacked flavor. \\n\\nOne of my friend's selected the Hawkers' Delight, which consisted of carrots, straw mushrooms, shiitake mushrooms, napa cabbage, red bell pepper, green bell pepper, tofu, and broccoli.  That's a good bit of stuff and the flavor was good.  Not bad I say, not bad at all.  Unfortunately my next few dishes weren't that spectacular.  I was quite displeased with this duck.  It was bland, the duck fat definitely wasn't rendered properly.  \\n\\n I had the Fish Tacos, which was alright.  At least this dish wasn't bad, but I probably wouldn't continue to order it. Next up, we have the Korean Bulgogi Beef Skewers.  The flavor of the skewers were okay although the meat itself was a bit of the charred side.  Some portions of the meat were a bit tough. The beef here could have been marinated more.  On the end of the plate, there were a side of kim chi.  This kim chi was just overtly sour, not spicy and just awful.  One of my friends and I both stated we're glad we didn't get the Kim Chi Fried Rice.  Sour fried rice just doesn't appeal to me.\\n\\nChar Kway Teo, Flat rice noodles, bean sprouts, shrimp, chicken... What's not to like?  Oh yeah, the lack of flavor.  I'm glad the proteins weren't overcooked but the overall flavor of the dish wasn't that great.  I was half tempted to ask for some fish sauce and some sriracha.  Half of the dishes we ordered were \\"signature dishes\\" but I think they need to reevaluate some things.  \\n\\nThe Roti Canai.  It's a Malaysian flatbread served with a curry sauce. Warm, flaky, crisp flatbread dipped in a spicy, curry sauce.  The consistency was there, the flavor was there, the color was there.  I could recommend this although for $3 for one flatbread is overpriced in my book.  If you have others that want more flatbread then it's an additional $1.50.\\n\\nThe Sitcky Rice with Mango sounds good.  Purple rice simmered in coconut milk, with mango pieces and mango ice cream.  Sounds really good, doesn't it?  I do love me some mango.  Well, they get points for presentation.  Purple rice, how pretty!  Now for the actual taste of it.  Well, I could taste the coconut milk in the rice although the rice was very stiff.  I found the black grains of rice very distracting to chew through.  \\n\\nSo final thoughts on this place?  I probably won't be coming back here anytime soon.  It's such a shame, because I've read so many good things and heard so many good things.  How can it be that the whole group and I didn't find anything we really enjoyed?  Hawkers really ought to kick up the flavor about 4 notches.  I really feel like I got a good sample of the menu and no dishes really impressed me.

Although the service was top-notch (aside from a not-so-great recommendation), and the decor metro-spiffy, the food was disappointing.  The Mac & Cheese of the Day featured pulled pork which was totally overpowered by the heavy-handed sauce and ill-chosen sweet peppers (pimento).  In short, the ingredients that (theoretically) belonged together were buried in cheese to the tune of, say, 1500 calories. The pork could have been chicken, tuna, cardboard or the check.-- it all succumbed to the thick cheese sauce, which made stadium nacho dip seem watery.  The ingredient that should have been omitted, the pimento, was like sweet pickle (only red).  It might have been okay on a burger or in an olive, but was out of place in this dish.  Sadly, the pimento was sufficiently potent to compete with the cheese.  Red bell pepper would have been a far better choice.  Aside from the spot-on texture of the pasta itself, this \\"special\\" had no redeeming characteristics. \\n\\nMy friend ordered the Deluxe burger, which came with nondescript fries.  He liked the burger except that it was obviously overcooked.  Ordered medium-rare, it arrived without a hint of pink.  One might excuse this if the grill had been operating at full capacity.  But, the Dinerant was less than half full, so every order should have been carefully monitored.  Still, he felt that the meat was quite good.

I'm going National baby! Well...an hour and a half East.....\\n\\nMy first introduction to Hawkers was at the 2015 Yelp party and I've been wanting to visit them ever since. While visiting family in Orlando we decided to give them a shot for lunch and we were definitely glad that we did. Be warned parking is tight to say the least and the venue itself is small so this may not be the spot for a large group. The staff was very friendly and happy to explain the dishes. Everything we had was cooked to perfection but some flavors were bolder then others. The chicken skewer and coconut curry shrimp were average but the beef skewer and chicken curry had a kick and this group of home cooks were smiling with every bite. The home run though is the wok fired lettuce and ginger cheesecake! The wok fire lettuce actually had one of the strongest umami flavors and is a great accompaniment with any other dish you may order. As for the ginger cheesecake...it's amazing because it's very different and my taste buds were just flat out excited while devouring this treat. All said and done this is a great spot to hit to try a mix of new flavors and to have a relaxed time with friends at.

You may have read the most recent issue Atlanta Magazine, featuring The 50 Best Restaurants in Atlanta. I have. Why this restaurant made number one is beyond me. As an employee of a Decatur business and resident of Lake Claire, I had been eagerly awaiting my first visit here. My husband and I made that visit for his birthday dinner, back at the end of November. I had heard from plenty of people that this restaurant was fantastic, and the bar had been set high. The reviews here on Yelp certainly leave you expecting the best -- a solid 4 out of 5 stars from 280+ reviews sets a high expectation in my book. Atlanta is no stranger to chefs with some major culinary cojonoes, and Fifth Group's Ecco didn't even make Atlanta Magazine's Top 50; I'm not sure what happened there.\\n\\nWhy the three-star review? Straight to the point, the food was not that great. I had a white fish dish (one that I don't believe is on the menu regularly), which didn't read to be all that interesting on the menu, but I figured I couldn't go wrong with anything here. It was served in a broth, accompanied by some calamari, cilantro, and probably a few other ingredients. The dish was fairly bland overall, and the fish, a bit fishy. Not a winning dish by any stretch of imagination. I should have sent it back and asked for something more interesting, but I don't like to make a fuss. It was pretty, but pretty only gets you so far, my friends. My husband had a pork dish, again, nothing that blew our hair back -- easily forgettable. We started with the citrus marinated olives and saucisson sec & Bresaola, which were fine, olives and some shaved meats, but nothing that knocked our socks off. We also shared a small salad, spinach, apples, nuts, etc. It was good but, I prefer my food to be a bit more memorable. \\n\\nIt was a huge let down for us. What really surprised me was the lackluster decor in the main dining room. If you look on their web site, you'll find one main picture of their dining room in the photo gallery, and for good reason. It's minimalist and dull. The bar is much more aesthetically pleasing, as you can tell from that photo gallery, where it's presence is showcased. \\n\\nOn a good note, the service was good. We had one of the many gentlemen buzzing about checking on us on a regular basis. I asked a question about one of their cocktails, I think I was inquiring about mezcal, and I was presented a little taste of it before I decided to go with a Tripel.\\n\\nThere are better restaurants in Atlanta, so I hope that Atlanta Magazine hasn't sent too many of it's readers here disappointed. There are plenty of establishments we've been to on their list that should've had the number one spot, Gun Show for instance. If you're looking for good food, fantastic chef creations that will please the palate, head there.\\n\\nI have to think that when something like this happens, perhaps it was just an \\"off night\\" for the restaurant, but you can't have \\"off nights\\" here in Atlanta. With the vast array of restaurants here in our great city, we rarely visit the same place more than once, unless we are wowed. A good example of this is Wisteria. We had dinner there so long ago, a few years ago at least. I simply cannot forget how amazing the gnocchi was; if it's the same dish, I believe it is still on their menu as Beef & Veal Meatballs (served atop the best gnocchi). Again, it was both of our dishes that were just okay, not just one. As of right now, I can't honestly recommend a visit to Cakes & Ale, there are far better restaurants in my opinion worthy of a better dining experience."},{"name":"SPITZ","address":"2103 N Killingsworth St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Yummm!!

I loved the interior, the tap wall, the large family style tables and the outside patio. The place has charm. \\n\\nWe sat at the bar and ordered samplers. You can request a variety or pick your own. They have a VERY nice local and beyond selection of beer. We came back again on another day and with all the samples we tried, I never tried the same thing twice. \\n\\nThe sausages are good, house made and very unique flavors. The first time I came here, I ordered the Drunken Chicken. It's a spicy good sausage that was really good with the curry ketchup on the side. I was really impressed with all the flavors. \\n\\nThe second time we came, I ordered the Duck and Fig sausage. I wanted something a little different. It was so savory, very sweet with the flavors of the fig and caramelized onion - not to mention the duck meat itself.  I'm happy we tried something new, it was good. \\n\\nI ordered the pickles both times. I make my own at home, so I always want to try them when I am out. The Spicy Dill pickles were my favorite. Very tart with a slow heat, fresh. The Fermented Pickles were so interesting, my mom told me about them and I had no idea what they were. A different way of making them with a different flavor. \\n\\nWe ordered the Jalape√±o mac and cheese, which was good enough to fight over. It was so creamy without being too heavy with so many different flavors. SO GOOD. \\n\\nThe Pork Rinds with the Habanero Pepper are so damn spicy and addictive. Crunchy and freshly made, burning the tip of my tongue and then relieving that with an ice cold beer. \\n\\nSo yeah, I really think that Banger's is one of those \\"Good as it gets\\" places for me.

Kettle chips (did not appear to be homemade). I suggested to the owner to think about offering a Chicago style version. He seemed open to it.\\n* QUESO: This might be the best queso in Austin. Chips were thicker stone ground variety (aka: what I like).\\n* SLIDERS: Better of the sliders I had have. Nicely seasoned meat with fennel. Served with a BBQ (?) sauce on top. I gotta remember to stick with mustard on hamburgers. (They had brie. How good would that have been?

Out running mindless errands, and in need of sustenance, the Hubs and I decided to check it out.\\n\\nThe building does not stand out (gray/tall) and the parking is limited (small lot to the side and 3 curb side in front) but the inside is very modern. Aluminum paneling, white modern chairs, both low and high top tables and a well lit bar area.  The hostess sat us immediately (even though they were quite busy around noon) and within seconds the waiter came to take our drink order. \\n\\nI'm one that likes to look over a menu (if possible) before going to a place, so I had been planning some of my choices for a few days.  I was a bit disappointed when they did not have the Chrysanthemum Tea I had been wanting.  I settled on a cup of Oolong, served hot with lemon, and it was quite good. \\n\\nThe menu is tri-fold and goes from left to right appies/small plates, to noodles/rice/soups and then original dishes.  We knew we wanted to sample several things so it was small plates for us.  We decided on what we wanted and when our waiter made some recommendations, I couldn't help but laugh as we were only ordering one of the recommended dishes.  \\n\\nFor our tasting we had Curry Meatballs, Roti Canai, Crispy Roast Pork Belly, Stir Fried Green Beans with Pickled Vegetables, Bok Choy and the Bulgogi Beef Banh Mi Sliders.  They recommend 5 small plates for 2 people.\\n\\nThe food comes out in stages, so you aren't hit with 6 dishes all at once.  We started with the Meatballs and the Fried  Roast Pork Belly.  I wasn't a fan of the meat balls.  They were dry and rather bland, the curry sauce was quite tasty though.  If you made a point to drag a meatball through the sauce it was quite good.  The Fried Roast Pork Belly was DELISH.  Perfectly crisped, served with hoisin dipping sauce it was amazing.  The sweet and salty sauce helped to cut through the fat of the pork and the pieces were the perfect bite size.  The Roti Cani is one of their house specials.  It is served with one piece of the most amazing flat bread I've ever had so we ordered a second piece.  The sauce is a spicy curry that I could have sucked down with a straw.  The green beans were also wonderful.  The perfect al dente with a sweet sauce and pickled veggies mixed in.  The Slider is an odd name for the dish.  It's more of a banh mi sandwich that they then cut into thirds to give you multiple \\"sliders\\".  But the taste was fantastic.  The beef was perfectly marinated, the pickled veggies crisp and sweet and sour, the butter on the bread was creamy and the bread itself was moist on the inside and crusty on the outside.  I could have easily had that as a meal.  The Bok Choy was just not appealing to me.  I usually love it at the buffet's all wilted and drenched in butter and soy but this was not like that.  They quarter the bok choy and then steam it and cover it with an oyster sauce and add shitake mushrooms.  I was immediately put off by the mushroom.  When I bit into it was spongy and watery and just not good.  The cabbage was still firm and the sauce didn't stick to it well so it was ultimately rather bland.  \\n\\nThe prices for each dish vary.  For the two of us for 6 small plates and two drinks it was $35.  Not too bad, and it was quite filling.  I gave the place 3 stars because I couldn't get 3.5  It was better than \\"A-Ok\\" but not quite \\"I'm a Fan\\".

As usual, BF ordered a martini straight up, with blue cheese stuffed olives.  I ordered the \\"Trois martini\\", which consisted of: Grey Goose infused with a blend of strawberries, raspberries & blueberries.  The drinks were OK.  BF's martini wasn't served in a traditional martini glass, which was quite odd, because my own martini (the Trois) WAS served in the proper martini glass.  Also, I ordered the trois martini because I like my drinks sweet and fruity...but this drink was neither.  It was quite tart, but in their defense, they were generous in the amount of alcohol.  \\n\\nFor an appetizer, we started with the classic steak tartare, it came with toast points - which were really stale (like it was difficult to even bite into it).  However, the flavor of the tartare was really enjoyable.  \\n\\nBistro Niko was having a special, and BF ordered his main course from this menu.  It was a veal tenderloin with escargot - very yum!

Great choice! \\n\\nFinally, we ended the meal as it should be - with dessert!!!  We shared the Lindt chocolate flourless cake, and it was rich and yummy.  BF also enjoyed a treat of espresso with sambuca and said that it was legit! \\n\\nSo I ask myself, what prevented this from being a 5-star review?  The main thing is that it was loud.  I mean LOUD!  We had to yell to talk to each other, and we each had to ask \\"What???\\" each time the other said something.  Also, a few other things, like  stale toast points, odd martini glass, and while the service was okay - we've had more attentive service at other restaurants, so that could have been stronger as well.

I actually have had the fish tacos before, just for the record, and they were good. \\nHowever, there are many things about Sausalito that I just can't get past.\\nOne is the loud music that I'm just not ready for at lunchtime played on speakers that make otherwise nice music sound like it's coming out of a busted out sub-woofer in the back of a Honda Civic. \\nThat by itself isn't that bad, but it means that I can't communicate with the people behind the counter who get visibly upset if you have to ask them what they said a few times. \\nToday, I had the pork tacos. The roast pork looked delicious, and I was so excited that people had to ask me to get out of the way of the chips and salsa. \\nAs I ate the first one, I thought it was a little salty. Then the grease started dripping. Ok, I know what you're thinking...it's a taco, live with it. So I tried. Tacos wouldn't be tacos if they weren't fatty. And pork roast would be no fun if it weren't fatty. I get that. But I (who am a big fan of pork fat, btw) looked down to see a pool of congealing grease on my plate. On my salad, actually. Pork fat vinaigrette, anyone?\\nAs I was making the decision that the super-salty greasy pork tacos were too nasty, I heard someone walking out exclaiming that the pork tacos made his day, so I might be alone in my opinion that the pork tacos were unacceptable. \\nThe last thing that made this a bad visit to Sausalito was that my shoes stuck to the floor. Not just like a spilled Coke in the last few hours, but like a tar pit.

(I've lived in Korea on three occasions and so have a basis for comparison.) The side of kimchi was small but freah tasting; it lacked a bit if bite that many other people's kimchi might have, though I suspect that it's a good level of pickled for the restaurant's overwhelmingly non-Asian clientele.

I believe the door staff is the very first impression of the bar and they should be the most professional and impressive people in the whole place, having rude or anti-social door staff is a big turn-off and a stupid business choice.  However, with the way that bar staffs turn around in this city there is a great chance that the people I experienced on my visits don't even work there any more.  \\n\\nDrinks are reasonably priced for Warehouse District, the crowd isn't as stuck up and crappy as some other nearby bars but not as laid back as Sixth Street either.

No reservations, but if you get there before noon on Sat/Sunday you should have no trouble getting seated - unless you are 8 or more. Not as many of the bigger tables, so you may wait a bit or get there earlier.\\n\\nLove the communal dining, very similar to Chinatown in Los Angeles and San Francisco, with metal carts whizzing past laden with delicious eats. Steamed dumplings, many versions of shumai, steamed pork buns, veggies, sticky rice, and more. Enjoy their hot green tea, perfect on a chilly day. I'm obsessed with the Egg Custard Tarts, I have to have them at the end of the meal. However, the cart may not come when I'm ready for them - so if there is a dish you have to have - it's best to grab it when the cart comes by. \\n\\nDim sum is fine for two, but it's better to go with a group if possible since the portions are large and you can try more dishes. Attentive servers are there to fill your tea and water, also if someone wants to order off the regular menu. I prefer this place to Canton House by a mile and will be checking out Oriental Pearl this year as well to compare. Did I mention this place is so inexpensive? You'll gorge yourself on amazing eats and be out around $20 or less per person.\\n\\nIf you go before noon, parking shouldn't be an issue, but it does fill up fast on the weekends. Free parking is available in their own lot. Also, they host a Chinese New Year's show the Sunday around the holiday - this year (2016) it's on Valentine's Day - 2/14.

The roll was good but the mini muffins are blissful.  I ordered the steak tacos... Perfection!  The hashbrowns were a good compliment to the meal.  My wife ordered the breakfast burrito. It was huge!  She enjoyed it but could not finish it. We shared a waffle that was also delicious. \\n\\nThe atmosphere was quaint and inviting. The staff was extremely nice.

After lots of researching on Yelp and elsewhere, we settled on Canoe. In sum, neither of us could have been happier with the choice. We both absolutely loved our experience at this place.\\n\\nTo start, the ambiance of the restaurant is magnificent. Everything is soft, from the lighting to the color palette. On top of that, it sits right on the Chattahoochie River, adding a level of depth to the experience. It kind of takes you out of the city in a great way. We had the option of sitting outside, but chose instead to sit inside, but facing the river. A wonderful view while eating! On top of that, service throughout was excellent.\\n\\nIn terms of their food, they seem to specialize in seafood and gamier meets, which suit my wife and I perfectly. For our first courses, my wife ordered the Shrimp Dumplings and I had the Duck-Stuffed Quail. The shrimp dumplings are served in a bouillabaisse. My wife (an avid seafood lover) was in heaven with this dish. The shrimp dumplings were clearly hand-made, and were expertly prepared. The bouillabaisse itself was also wonderful, and packed a bigger seafood punch (=loaded with seafood) than we expected given it's smaller size (being a first course). My duck-stuffed quail was also amazing. The duck was chopped into smaller pieces and was cooked (I believe) with bacon, all stuffed inside some quail. Stuffing two of my favorite meats inside another one of my favorite meats will always make me a happy man! We were certainly off to a great start.\\n\\nFor our main courses, my wife ordered the Sage Roasted Pheasant, and I had the Rabbit. Just like with our first courses, we loved our main courses. Where I liked my first course a bit better, I did like my wife's main course just a hair better than mine. That's not to say the rabbit wasn't excellent, I just thought it was among the best pheasant I've ever eaten. On top of that, one of the sides for the dish was pheasant croquettes, which were (almost) better than the pheasant itself. Overall, both main courses were cooked perfectly, and the accompanying sides seemed to compliment our dishes as well as one would hope they would.\\n\\nI honestly cannot remember what we ordered for dessert. It was fine, but was served in a shallow pool of frangelico (hazelnut liqueur), which kind of overpowered everything else. About the only misstep of the evening for Canoe, and neither my wife nor myself are big dessert people, so not a big misstep.\\n\\nOverall, we both loved this place. In the end, I'd probably say it was a solid 4.5, but I'll round up to a 5. It wasn't the absolute best food we've ever eaten, but everything we had was consistently wonderful. We're planning on going back for our next anniversary...and probably the one after that as well!"},{"name":"Deschutes Brewery Portland Public House","address":"210 NW 11th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I came here with a group of nine other people for a birthday party for my good friend Nathan.

The Beer, Leffe and Hefe Weis, was on tap, cold, refreshing and promptly served.  That and the fact that they had the football game on television were the positives in what would be a sea of negatives.  \\nWe asked about the Foie Gras and were told that in addition to the Faux (fake) version there was also the real deal with ham hock bits--in my book, the real deal is the Alsation variety made only from geese.  Based on the description from our server, the menu should have referred to it as duck pate.\\nWe decided to start with the Parma ham with blue cheese on flat bread (kind of a thin crust pizza), steak tartare and the salmon croque monsieur.  The tartare was made with beef (unfortunately), came with no egg yolk, no sauce, no pickle, no onion, and was was off color in places.  We made it edible with lots of dijon, pepper and salt.  The salmon croque was soggy, cheesy, cold and bland.  The parma ham thing was tasteless despite what looked like blue cheese. It was the lesser of three evils.\\nOur main dishes were the haddock with cous cous in lieu of the polenta and the shrimp with salad.  The shrimp were deep fried?!  WTF--if you deep fry, mention it on the menu or when ordering.  The shrimp had been left in the oil or under a heat light until it was somewhere north of vulcanized rubber--what a waste of good fish.  The haddock was not edible.  It was over cooked and too salty.  I have never complained about too much salt ever (I love salt), but this dish was so salty that I felt nauseous.  This was one of the rare times I have left a meal only partially eaten.\\nThe people at the bar were fun and familiar, but the bartender kept mixing up the Leffe and Hefe and did not seem to have much of clue about what drinks would suit the food or any concern about whether we liked the food.  \\nThe Beaujolais Nouveau should have been poured out.  It had been left in a lame looking mini keg for over a week and tasted like a combination of a cleaning fluid and vinegar.  Kudos to the bartender for having the sense to warn us that it might be off and suggesting that we try a sample first.  That said, he should have thrown it out.\\nMy guess is that the regular chef was not on duty and/or the owner just does not care.

I almost felt like I shouldn't tip when I went (very bad manners to tip in Japan because the chefs and staff take great pride in serving the best quality of food with the best service and think the practice of tipping places a conditional system of service and food quality that leads to many poor quality restaurants). But please, DO TIP, as this is America after all, they will still expect it! \\n\\nIt is really the small things that count, the flavoring of the rice in the donburi, the chawan-mushi (steamed egg served in a cup with a bit of chicken and a ginko nut) is the best since Japan.

If you're a mid-20s college student looking for a hype place to hangout, sure. If you're looking to get together with 11 of your friends for a birthday dinner this is not the place to come. I'll explain. The restaurant is HUGE. It stretches out far and wide. It looked like it was maybe 2 or 3 restaurants patched together then there was an entire downstairs portion, which I'll get to later. At 9:00pm on a Friday night there was a line outside to get into the place. I've never seen that before, but we had reservations so we were able to surpass the peasants waiting in the cold. We were sat in the very back left corner, seemingly away from the action... wrong. It was right at the end of their massive bar rail. Whatever, should be cool right? Nope. We had to yell literally across the table to hear one another and I was at the end of the table so I was getting bumped every so often. Whatever. It was cool, 'cause I'm a young kid too. Lol. Our waitress (I can't think of her name at the moment, I feel like it started with an \\"M\\") took excellent care of us. With this party of 12 she still had other tables to tend to, but we never felt neglected so shout out to her. The drinks were absolutely delicious. I had a Dirty Absolut Martini with blue cheese olives, but was quickly hit with the Boston prices. $14.00 for my drink and an extra $2.00 for the olives. Wildin'. All these college students up in here must be drinking beer or are LOADED. First issue. Our waitress comes up to the table and tells us that fresh bread will be coming out since the kitchen ran out. We're all like, \\"Cool! YYYAAASSS fresh warm bread to soak up all this liquor.\\" NAWP. The bread comes out COLD. Like, out the refrigerator cold. (Check my picture of me holding the piece of bread over the candle to try and warm it up.) How is \\"fresh\\" bread cold? It means it was \\"freshly\\" out the fridge, that's what. That rubbed me the wrong way. We told our server about the cold bread and she went and had the kitchen put some bread in their oven and bring it out warm. Still, it was okay. Bland even, but it's complimentary so I'm not going to complain too much. We added olive oil and pepper to a place on our own to try and flavor it up. Now for my food! I had our waitress, pick my entree for me because too many choices looked good for me to land on one. I often do this because who else knows the menu better than the staff, right? She brought me the Veal Milanese which is a nice cut of veal cooked to perfection, heirloom tomatoes, baby kale smother in a lemon caper butter sauce. ($28.00) It was FANTASTIC. I will give them credit. The food was fire, but.. it was gone too fast. I was left hungry after my meal and that usually doesn't happen. So now it was time to go downstairs and party! Our sever was the plug so she was able to get about 6 of us downstairs to party (they were at capacity all night, hence the line outside) when the other 6 went home. The downstairs atmosphere was just a bit better than the restaurant. Drinks were priced MUCH better than upstairs, but the DJ... my goodness the DJ just was not playing music I wanted to dance to or was vibing with. Like, come on, it's a FRIDAY NIGHT IN 2017. We ain't trying to hear stuff from the 90s fam. Anyway. In conclusion this place is OHHKAAYY. Would I come here again? Likely not, but check this place out if you're around.

They have a big patio area but due to it being 20 degrees, outside seating isn't an option. The venue now has a coffee/bar area in the back that you can get coffee and mimosas while you wait, and then there's a to go station along with pastries that you can purchase as well. We did both since my step dad is a diabetic and his sugar was dropping. Both of these are new good additions because it gives the waiters something to do. \\nFor food, we ordered the shrimp and grits, the Belgian waffles, and an omelet. Everything was delectable. The shrimp and grits has huge shrimps And corn were added to the grits. Great flavor profile. My Belgian waffle was big and fluffy and had very fresh fruit on top. I didn't try the omelet but it had raved reviews from my sister in law. We cleared all of our plates.

I remember eating maybe only 3-4 little pieces of shredded chicken! IMO, this is totally unacceptable, especially since this is a restaurant specializing in chicken AND it's a $10 bowl.

We asked for grilled wings but got fried as well, to top off the night. The decor that everyone raves about, is what I would call- cheap. That chipotle look is because they used corrugated metal, an inexpensive building material. The lights are cheap looking and the stools look like they are from ikea.

One of the members in my party didn't get his sauce for his chicken tenders until a reminder was prompted. I keep coming back because of the good location and because other people choose to meet here. Food is okay; the wings are the best thing on their menu, obviously. Plenty of televisions all around broadcasting multiple sport channels if you're into that sort of thing.

The restaurant/brewery is very cool and staff was very friendly to us. We were able to sample a few beers before ordering our own pints, and got chimichurri fries and deviled eggs to snack on.\\n\\nI totally forgot what we ordered, but it was a seasonal beer and it was delicious. It was a summer ale, I think. I need to find out the name for future tastings. The food was also very good... loved the chimichurri fries and the deviled eggs. It was also good to share. I wish we weren't so stuffed from brunch earlier so we could have tried more of the happy hour items.\\n\\nOverall, Deschutes was a pretty cool restaurant/brewery to visit in our visit to Portland.

It was delicious. We shared a salad (they're gigantic bowls, which reminded me of the way my Italian grandmother used to serve salad), and a dessert pizza with pecans and cinnamon (it was excellent... albeit a touch heavy on the frosted glaze... but we both can't wait to order it again.)

I had a little trouble changing my reservation of 5 to 8, but I was accommodated well--I was pleasantly surprised. \\n\\nBut on to the food! For a table of 8, we ordered a lot (mainly me though). \\n\\nThe wine on tap was surprisingly good. Totally recommend that! \\n\\nAppetizers:\\nBeef carpaccio -- Nothing too fancy going on here. Meat, seasoning, and shallots. The beef was buttery and pretty darn good. Overall, good, but nothing amazing (other than the quality of the beef, holy cow). \\nChicken empanada with mayo thing -- I actually really liked this! I think the pastry could have been a tad flakier, but overall, I liked it and would order it again. I think the mayo really sold it. I honestly can't tell you the flavor of the chicken... \\nGarlic sourdough bread with some flavored honey lard -- Really disappointing. The sourdough was really dry and not very flavorful. The lard (butter) thing was also not rich in flavor. It sounded delicious but wasn't. \\n\\nMain courses:\\nSupper club fried chicken -- Some of the chicken was fried really well and super juicy. The breast wasn't though; it was a bit dry. The biscuit and gravy was good though, but not too special. \\nGrilled giant beef rib with potato/sauerkraut dumplings -- Holy crap was this thing expensive, and I ordered it. I was expecting Flinstone level giant rib, and it actually was pretty massive. Was not disappointed by size haha. Flavor was really good. Slightly overcooked but most of the meat was prepared well and was falling off the bone. Very good, but REALLY pricey! Big enough for 2. \\nPork chop -- Disappointing. Flavor just wasn't there. Cooked well though. Nothing much else to say. \\n\\nDessert: \\nBlackberry cobbler -- Good! I'm not the biggest fan of blackberries, but I enjoyed it. \\n\\nOverall, pretty good dining experience.

IHOP and Denny's aspire to cook Cafe Java's fare.  After an early trip to ACC last week, I ended up here, and the place was busting at the seams.\\n\\nI'd been to Cafe Java several times before, as the ex-boyfriend-asshole lives in the apartment complex adjacent to ACC, so we went there frequently.  Funny thing, though... I always mean to try something different every time I come here, yet I ALWAYS get the same exact thing.\\n\\nThe other day, I looked over the menu and THOUGHT that PERHAPS I had had the egg sammich before.  But I couldn't really remember, so I ordered it again.  Once it arrived, I realized I'd had it SEVERAL times before.  However, there's a secret subconscious reason I keep ordering this dish:  It's THAT good.\\n\\nI ordered the eggs over-easy, and that yolk explosion all over my sammich was a dream come true.  Dare I say my sammich orgasmed?  It was like finally finding Mr, Right, except that I don't have to put up with any male bullshit.  Absolute perfection, in other words.  The lettuce, the mayo, the cheese, the bread... everything was just as I wanted it to be.  And their hash browns completely knock IHOP's outta the fryer.\\n\\nThe mocha drink I got was good, too, as was the service.  Service is always top-notch at Cafe Java.  It's almost like they've been customers themselves before.  Hmmmmm...\\n\\nTons of fun art on the walls, but I'm uncomfortable with the number of kokopelli in the place.  Seriously, they all watch me eat, like that Michael Keaton poster I had in my bedroom when I was a teen.  Maybe the kokopelli are CIA spies, or al Qaeda terrorists.  And did you know that Kokopelli is a fertility deity?  This makes me more nervous.  Is that why they serve *eggs* here?  I had one pretty pregnant-looking egg on my sammich the other day.\\n\\nRegardless, I'm sure I'll continue to go back and eat more egg sammiches.  I guess I'm lucky I haven't gotten knocked up yet with all those kokopelli hanging around.

Definitely not a typical bar and I would not be hesitant to do a business lunch here.\\n\\nOur server messed up our food order but I didn't complain and ate it anyway. He brought me the elk burger with sweet potato fries instead of the lamb burger with some other side dish I can't remember now. I do remember enjoying the burger and fries anyway. He did get our beers right. We had an Arctic Blastanator Weizen Bock with our food and a snifter of Streaking the Quad after we finished eating. I said I wouldn't review the beers from memory but I do remember being very impressed with each beer and believe that the Arctic Blastanator was probably the most banana nuanced beers I have ever had.\\n\\nGreat lunches at Deschutes are frequently enjoyed by my wife and I.

I've been excited to try this place because of their purportedly superb cocktails.\\n\\nGnudi - Mushrooms, cheese and pasta = my (almost) favorite things in life. Eating the arugula on its own was weird but combined with everything else made it ok. I dunno, maybe I'm just picky with my vegetables. \\n\\nPEI Mussels in 420 Broth - I thought the sauce was too...fishy...like they just cooked the mussels and was like, well, here's the broth (that's not to say that I didn't enjoy the mussels though). The boyfriend greatly enjoyed though so take it how you will. They definitely give a lot of mussels, even though it's technically a small plate. \\n\\nBeltline Burger - The tots are great. The burger isn't anything fancy but they do it well. They also give you a decent amount of bacon for the $2 add-on.\\n\\nBufala Negra - Oh my god this was beautiful. I don't like really strong drinks so this was perfect and refreshing with a slight hint of sweetness.\\n\\nSmokescreen #2 - They apparently brought this drink back because it was so popular. The boyfriend thought that it was a bit strong and didn't really like it very much but it was definitely well made. The \\"smoky\\" bit comes out as an aftertaste.\\n\\nService - The service was nice and quick. I think we received our entrees in around 10 minutes and we were out of there in about an hour. Prompt and efficient! \\n\\nSidenote - The restaurant is in an old train station (hence the name...) and is beautiful to walk into in the early evening since the entire space is so open.\\n\\nVerdict - It might be a bit pricy but I would definitely go back for more cocktails.
