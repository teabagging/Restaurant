The decor, the upgraded fast food menu, and especially the selection of milk shakes and malteds all contribute to a really excellent throwback feel. The food is far better than any fast food drive thru, but I wouldn't say it's the best food I've ever had, either. Everything is tasty in that way you feel guilty about, if you know what I'm saying.\\n\\nI look forward to future (rare) visits for an occasional malted or to take advantage of their specials, but it probably won't be a regular stop. It reminds me a lot of the DQ stops or my youth or maybe going to the Varsity on the way home from a long road trip."},{"name":"Palmers Restaurant","address":"Warwick Place, 123 Pleasant St","city":"Marblehead","stars":"3","text":"I want Palmers to be good! I have eaten there at least 4 times over the past year or so.

The bar scene looks very active and fun- so this keeps up the atmosphere here...but the food...middling at best. The best meal we had there was a brunch where we sat on the patio in the summer. We had mussels and I had the salmon last time we went. The mussels were not fresh...actually pretty awful...the waitress had to take them away with the little guys still in their shell because we concluded we might get sick if we ate more (we did not get sick). The salmon was kind of dry, the accompaniments were not anything I can remember. My husband was also completely underwhelmed. Lastly, if it is the same kitchen that cooks for the Warwick theater (which is attached) it is never good and the service in there is horrible. PLEASE....I want you guys to be good.

Our server was helpful in answering our questions and making recommendations.  She was wonderful. What was not so great was the slow service. For example, the person to bring out the wine was slow and unfriendly. They came and dropped off the wine or food with a grim face. Not friendly at all. Must be a bad night for all of them or something. The person who refilled the water and gave out bread was the same way. Maybe I was expecting some friendly service with the high price food I was ordering.\\n\\nSpeaking of high price food, I'd give it three stars as well. I thought the menu was overrated and selection was mediocre. There were three fish options on the menu, a chicken, a rabbit, a burger, pork chop and a steak.  The items were between $26-$38 I guess. Then there was the usual King entree with the prime ribeye and marrow for $87. For an average menu the price was unexpectedly high! I did not enjoy my rabbit served with BBQ al dente peanuts and pickled okra. It was an odd combination. It tasted bland and could be a free range chicken for all I know. There wasn't anything attractive about the entree and the ingredients used. \\n\\nThe starters/appetizers were more interesting. We had the lobster fritters, pimento hush puppies, Spanish octopus, GA shrimp, and wagyu tartar.

We had the chocolate tart, key lime cheesecake, peach crisp and the toffee cake.

The pizza is fine, and the cheese was good - it's just... the sauce was kind of plain, and the dough was kind of soft & thicker than we wanted - and the whole thing wasn't cooked quite as long as we'd have liked (it wasn't raw, per se, but the cheese was only just lightly melted, instead of being browned a little).  \\n\\nAnyway, it's fine, nothing egregiously wrong with it."},{"name":"Full Moon","address":"344 Huron Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"GREAT.

Everything else is just okay.\\n\\nWent to lunch here because it was right at the end of a walking tour we had just completed and highly recommended by the tour guide.  It's the oldest restaurant in Boston and oldest restaurant in continouse service in the U.S. ... dating back to 1826.  Amazing to think that this place was open back then.  \\n\\nWe arrived on a hot Friday around lunchtime ... not crazy busy, but busy.  Did not have to wait for a table, but were ushered upstairs and through a dining area to our table.  An unfriendly gentleman poured water and dropped off cornbread without speaking.  Cornbread was okay (keep in mind I'm from the South, so the bar is set rather high for cornbread).  The waitress was an old leathery Boston lady with the most quintessential \\"Bahstan\\" accent ... very friendly and welcoming.  Put in an order for a Sam Adams, a bowl of Clam Chowder, and the Fish & Chips.\\n\\nI wouldn't ordinarily critique the Sam Adams, but it was surprisingly warm.  Again, I'm from the South, so I politely drank the beer without wanting to be disrespectful to America's oldest restaurant.  The Clam Chowder was the first of three (3) \\"chowdahs\\" I would have during this weekend trip to Boston, and it would be the absolute best by far (compared to Abe & Louie's and Grill 23 ... both very upscale restaurants).  The Fish & Chips was good, but it didn't knock my socks off or anything.  The fries looked like they would be soggy, but were surprisingly crispy.\\n\\nLast thing to mention ... the bathroom looks like it is the original (from 1826).

The taro was SO FRESH and the sauce was tangy and sweet enough to cut through the heavy, dense nature of taro.  Such a perfect balance of flavours.  The second dish is the mock pork.

The oldest restaurant in the United States currently operating.  The place is definitely a classic.  I love the oyster bar and the general feel of this place.  It is cool to think that folks were eating oysters in this same spot a couple hundred years ago.  We sat at the bar and I have to say the service was fantastic.  The bartender that served us was very friendly and competent.  The food itself was just okay.  The clam chowder was the best I've ever had.  The bartender told me they make a new batch hourly and never keep any  overnight.  The oysters however were not that good.  They were small and kind of dry which was weird.  They were also served with prepacked cocktail and horseradish in these plastic cups.  They were probably the worst oysters I've ever had in boston in all my visits.  Matt ordered mussels which were okay, but nothing special.  They were served with really good buttery, cheesy, garlic bread.  Also tried the clams casino which were a little better than average with some nice breading and bacon.  The best thing about this place is the service and meeting the other tourists at the bar.

The Thai iced tea was on point and you could actually taste the tea. \\n\\nWe had the lobster Mac and cheese as an appetizer which was great. It is served on a skillet that is still sizzling when it comes out. The cheese was hot and gooey. The tiny little tomatoes that they add on top compliment the cheese and pasta really well.\\n\\nFor our entrees I had the crispy beef which was good, but not great. It was a little too salty. The sauce was a bit overpowering, but the jasmine white rice helped balance this out. The rice was a little hard instead of being soft and sticky which is not a good thing. \\n\\nMy wife had the special that evening. It was fish on top of risotto with artichoke. My wife enjoyed this dish very much. The fish was well cooked and seasoned. I actually liked her dish more than mine and we ended up halving our plates.\\n\\nFor dessert we had the pandan cake with ice cream. The dessert was amazing! It was garnished with fresh bananas and strawberries which went well with the pandan cake. One thing that might make this dish even better would be adding coconut or macapuno which is typically how I have pandan cake. However, the dessert was still amazing and I would highly recommend giving it a try.\\n\\nThe service was great throughout our dinning experience. The waiter was very attentive, the hostess made sure to call us an uber and the manager escorted us to the car when it arrived and made sure we were well taken care of. I think it is awesome that the restaurant offers free uber service to and from the hotel via Yelp from downtown hotels. This is a very convenient service if you are from out of town. The reason I deducted a star was I made reservations for 8:30 pm and tried to call the restaurant to request pick-up at our hotel at 7:45. I must have called 5 or 6 times and no one picked up the phone. The phone kept going to voice mail after ringing for a few minutes and the Poor Calvins voice mail box was full. In the end, my wife and I ended up walking 25-30 minutes from our hotel to the restaurant.

I called again, this time getting a message that the restaurant was too busy to pick up the phone (I kid you not).

Mr. Ford, any ideas from heaven? \\n\\nI didn't think so...

Sauteed lemon grass beef, fragrant as ever with noodles, awesome rare beef pho with good acid notes which usually lacks, sate peanut noodle with beef, oh, like spicy and beefy liquid peanut butter broth that you keep on sipping until you are grossed out or satisfied... Too much to list.\\n\\nI am a big fan of 2-4 times a week kind of restaurants. They feel real, they taste real, that's what you need when down and out, or happy and proud, quality time, affordability, being a part of the kinetics of a room, the energy of staff, the salt and pepper shakers that you know of, the obvious of the spots that needs updates in the place, the new cook signing in...\\n\\nYou know, like going home to the good ol partner, beauty of the routine rather than a short lived date with a super-model.

It was very different than what I expected given the Yelp reviews I'd read speaking of an unattractive space with unfriendly staff and un-Texas-sized portions.\\n\\nAmbiance:  Okay, I kinda see what you guys meant when you said it wasn't the most stylish or well-decorated place.  But it was clean and some of the decorations were nice/interesting, such as the wall mural.  I was expecting much more of a tacky taqueria from reading the previous reviews.  \\n\\nService:  Our service was awesome.  We were served by a man whom I think was the host/bartender/waiter, and also by a woman that I strongly suspect was the owner (because when we got our to-go boxes she came to our table and we talked for a long time about dear departed Las Manitas and its relationship with Elsi's and such).  Both of them were extremely attentive in responding to our needs, and even proactive at times (for example, after we ordered queso, the fellow offered to bring small plates for us to use ... we didn't even have to ask).  Even the bus-person who refilled our drinks was very attentive without being obtrusive.  It was truly some of the best service I've had recently.\\n\\nFood (appetizers):  As mentioned, it narrowly missed being perfect.  Our chips and queso were very, very salty.  I tend to over-salt, so at first I appreciated this, but it even became too much for me after awhile.  This was a shame because the chips were so delicious ... obviously fresh-fried, and a bit thicker and puffier than tortilla chips at restaurants usually are.  The queso also would have been amazing if it was slightly less salty, adding some of the excellent (and quite spicy) salsa also provided did help somewhat.\\n\\nFood (main dishes):  Well, I can't even remember what my husband actually ordered because my food was so great and I can't at this time access a menu.  I know he got one of the vegetarian plates, because he got black beans and white rice.  The black beans were refried even though the menu didn't say that, but he didn't mind.  He ate most of of his food even though he didn't really have room for it, only leaving a little bit of beans and rice, which he was sure to take home to eat later (when's the last time you got a to-go box so as not to waste a few spoonfuls of beans and rice?  That's how good those simple items were).  We were told that two tortillas per meal were provided free of charge, and that also made me happy.  They were good, homemade, tortillas.  I got the enchilada trio:  one beef (with rojo sauce I think), one cheese with ranchero sauce, and one chicken with verde sauce; with beans and rice.  Everything was just so delicious!  The beans and rice were amazing, great homemade flavor, and the enchiladas were all great in their own ways ... the sauce on the beef enchilada was really interesting and the meat was flavorful without being greasy, the chicken verde enchilada was up there with the best I've had, and the cheese enchilada managed not to seem like a stepchild even compared to those two.  And did I mention the huge portions?  I took home half of my dinner, and was still soooo full.  It made a wonderful meal another night ... the beef enchilada actually got better!  When does that ever happen?\\n\\nSo anyway, we're going back to Elsi's ASAP, most likely for breakfast.

This place sucks big time.  The food and drinks are over-priced, the music/band is always too loud and the suburbanite/conference attending clientele perpetuates the hype of this mediocre restaurant.  I think people fall in love with the decor, which is the only great thing about this place.  They think that for some reason it's a really good restaurant that serves great food.  That and the fact that it's owned by the over-hyped Concentrics Group make it irresistable for some reason I cannot seem to understand.  The service is described as \\"snooty\\" and \\"cold\\" by other reviewers and I certainly have experienced that at Two.  I personally find the food boring, uninspired and not consistent.\\n\\nIf you do happen to still want to eat at Two, you probably do not want to valet your car.  I know someone whose car was stolen from the valet lot and I heard it was most likely an inside job.  The valet is an independent company (only contracted by the restaurant) and for some reason, Two management hasn't gotten rid of them despite the fact that they have almost run me and several other people over while trying to park the cars.  If you have a really nice car, make sure you watch them park it.  They like to drive your really nice cars really fast through the little lot and over the speed bumps.  If you do not valet your car, you will have to park on the street though, since the rest of the lot is reserved and you will get booted.\\n\\n[Note:  Why do so many people write in their reviews that it's acceptable/cool/OK to make a reservation and then have to wait 20-30 minutes for your table????  That's NOT cool...that's really bad management/customer service.  This place isn't worth it...trust.]"},{"name":"Home Slice Pizza","address":"1415 S Congress St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"This place is an amazing mix of real NY style thin crust pizza and a quintessential Austin joint.

The Shoyu ramen has a richer flavor, but was a bit too salty and soy saucey for my taste. The texture of the ramen was a bit crunchy, which is how I like it.

I went there last night with my wife for the first time and will be repeat customers in the future. \\n\\nIt was a nice day yesterday so the front roll up door to the tasting room was open to allow a nice breeze in. The location itself is near a train crossing and in the span of a few hours we had to hold our conversation for half a minute while the train went by. The train and industrial feel to the place lent to a certain counter-culture feel that will receive a ton of support from beer geeks and HotD fans. There was a central bar and several tables around the perimeter. The restrooms were easy to spot and accessible unlike a couple tasting rooms I've visited. \\n\\nOur waitress was extremely attentive and quick to bring us our drinks. Alan Sprints was there in the kitchen but seemed approachable for any beer related banter. It was a family affair for him as well because a couple young boys the spitting image of him were walking around the room as well. \\n\\nThe beer! For $12 Misty and I shared a half dozen 3 ounce taster glasses of the HotD beers available on tap. Greg, Blue Dot, Fred, Adam, and 2007 Doggie Claws were all great but the 1 beer that we both needed our very own 12 ounce tulip of was Fred from the Wood. For $6.50 a piece I got to try for the first time I beer I called \\"my new favorite beer\\". While that is a little spendy for beer in Portland, I think it was absolutely worth it. Apparently last week Cherry Adam was on tap in its place so expect that sixth tap to be an ever changing one. \\n\\nGo to Hair of the Dog, get a beer, and enjoy one of Portland's finest.

This place is definitely unique.  Its got so much character it doesn't know what to do with all of it.  Case-in-point, their maple bar which has bacon on it.  Their Maple Bar alone is what earned them a 3rd star.  If it had been based on taste alone, I would've given them only 2 stars.  I agree with others' reviews that say that their doughnuts are too sugary.  Some may argue that this is what they're going for, but that doesn't take any talent.  I can dump sugar and candy and frosting on a fried piece of dough, but it doesn't make for a 5-star doughnut.  The Maple Bar was pretty awesome to take pictures with, but again it tasted like a more sugary version of your average grocery store bought maple doughnut with a piece of old bacon on top.

We were put on the wait list for a table in the bar area.  After a very short wait I received a text that our table was ready.  We were seated and given water.  Our server came took our drink orders and then left us to decide on our entrees.  He returned to take our orders and left.  An expediter brought out our food.  Our server did not return until 20 minutes after the meals were brought out.  We had empty cocktail glasses and fortunately nothing was wrong with our food because our server was literally taking care of every table around us and not even a glance our way.  When he did stop by I ordered another pina colada (they are excellent here).  A barback brought my drink and we literally never saw our server again.  We sat with dirty dishes in front of us for another half hour until my partner got up to ask the hostess to find a server to bring us our bill.  Meanwhile our assigned server was clearing dishes and brining menus to neighboring tables.  We were going to order dessert and coffee; but didn't want to wait another hour to see our server again.  We passed him on the way out and he just walked past us angrily - never apologizing or even wishing us a good evening.  We understand when a restaurant is busy that things may take longer; however, we were clearly being ignored.

Combination hotel, movie theater, restaurant, bars, historical site, and neighborhood setting.  Rated separately you might say each is average, but combined they make for an unique experience.   We stayed in the main school wing for a couple of nights. We had one of the classroom hotel rooms which meant it was very big, with chalkboards, more closet space than some hotel rooms I've stayed in. The room was off then main corridor which was filled with people when we arrived so I was a bit worried, but the corridor door lead to a mini entry way which had a separate door to our room and that eliminated all the hallway noise.  The school's old auditorium has been converted into a bar and movie theater so we saw a first run feature one night that was included in our room rate. The salt water soaking pool was a nice feature and we took advantage of it, although it is very popular. The Courtyard restaurant was ok but it had the advantage of being about 10 feet from our room door. That sounds weird and noisy, but it wasn't.

To our surprise, all the food was delicious. The deep fried squid  came with a mayo they made which helped bring out a lot more flavor. The tuna croquette tasted like a tuna version of crab cakes and there would never be any complaints about crab cakes, the specialty roll we got was very elegantly plated, and when the sashimi arrived to the table, the waitress told us the chefs gave us a few pieces of expensive complimentary red tuna sashimi to taste. \\n\\nI've had a couple instances before where the chef would provide a couple pieces of fancier sashimi on days where there are only a few customers, but it never will cease to surprise me how grateful I am they took extra effort to make us feel special. \\n\\nAll in all I had a wonderful experience at Hime.

Cod tacos were good but had a weird flavor think there was Parmesan instead of Mexican cojito cheese. Service was great everybody was nice but this place definitely not a Mexican feel restaurant.

Pizzeria Locale is not anything inventive, it's just good ol' pizza, great salads and sides. They have a very simple menu that keeps your experience homey and familiar. So far, I've tried their Insalata Antica (arugula w/ parmigiano reggiano & balsamic), Insalata Amalfi (citrus fennel dill salad), Pizza Campagnola (san marzano tomatoes, anchovies, olives, garlic, capers), Pizza Mais (corn, creme fraiche, prosciutto cotto, mozzarella di bufala) and Pizza Margherita (mozarella di bufala, san marzano tomatoes, basil). So far my favorites have been the Antica salad (so simple but so refreshing and delicious) and the Margherita. Their pizza dough is full of flavor, you'll want to finish every bit of that crust. The only sucky part is that every single time, my pizza has been soggy in the middle as if I didn't get the pizza straight out of the oven or they put too much topping on. I don't know if it's because they're too busy but there's nothing more disappointing than a soggy middle where the topping has soaked through the crust. I like my Italian pizzas crispy and thin and I didn't find this in Pizzeria Locale. Otherwise, everything is pretty spot on. Although I haven't tried it yet, I hear that their Budino (butterscotch pudding) is amazing.

Very expensive for less than average food. The waiters are rushed under pressure to turn and burn tables.You fill out your own order form which is very confusing and ends up being more time consuming because the waiter has to stand there and tell you how. Fried chicken was tough and chewy, sides were cold (we went at 4 in the afternoon so clearly had the lunch leftovers), the Mac and cheese so over warmed the cheese topiing was literally plastic, and the green beans were literal mush. The tomato casserole was good and different.  If you are a tourist with a car- go up I-75 (USE HOV)  six miles to OK Cafe where the cost is the same, but the food 100% better.

We ordered some uni nigiri as well as aburi toro and they were amazing! Chopped scallop roll has less scallop than i hoped but not too heavy on the rice. The sunset roll is very heavy and creamy but different and tastes very good with mozzarella cheese on top with assorted BBQ seafood. The nabeyaki udon has more toppings than noodles but the broth is flavourful without being overly salty! \\n\\nThe spicy charashi don did not have as much sashimi as i expected but was filled with veggies! They also use a lot of fresh veggies for decorations and such. The tuna carpaccio was also very fresh although a little heavy on the sauce. Lastly, the tatsu tower was again small for the price paid but i believe it had fresh crab and had amazingly sweet mangoes as well! \\n\\nWe weren't exactly full after the smaller portions so ordered the spicy dragon roll. Also very small but well constructed, it was a dynamite roll topped with unagi, spicy tuna and avocado. the prawn tempura was quite battered but this roll was not overloaded with sauce which I liked. \\n\\nOverall, beautiful presentation and good food but for quite a high price!"},{"name":"Poor Calvin's","address":"510 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"The beignets are a must!

The restaurant is tucked away on a quiet street which makes it ideal to sit outside. My server was Mac and even if you have to wait, please request him because he only added to my experience. I started with the lobster Mac n Cheese which was topped with lightly toasted Kale pieces that added a slight crunch but some how made sense. The lobster pieces were small but you could still taste them and not too over powering. \\nFor the main course I asked for Mac's advice and decided on the Chilean Sea Bass.... Wow is all I can say! The meal had so many components that worked perfectly together and the fish was cooked just right. Mac was very attentive and gave me additional suggestions for restaurants for the rest of my stay. When he came back with my check he sneaked me a small slice of one of the desserts because he said, \\" hopes this makes up for your bad experience last night\\"! I didn't need the dessert( even thought it was delish) my whole experience tonight more then made up for my not so great dinner experience the night before ( another restaurant). \\nSide note- they offer an amazing service of calling you an uber to take you anywhere in the downtown area on them! \\nMy overall experience was so great, from the friendly staff to the food to the ambience so definitely a 5 star rating!"},{"name":"The Eisenhower Bagelhouse","address":"3990 N Interstate Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"These bagels don't fit into a frowning mouth.

The advantage of coming at that time is you can find on street  parking at meters AND still take advantage of the Happy hour menu which ends at 7:00 p.m.  Half off beer, wine, well drinks and appetizers.  Appetizers include salads, lamb lollipops, soup and fried green tomatoes.  In other words, something for everyone.  \\n\\nWe ordered  the pasta dishes for our entrees.  Pasta De-Nova and the seafood pasta.  You have a choice of sizes..... seems to me, big or bigger??? We both agreed the Pasta De-Nova had more flavor than the seafood pasta.  I'm probably being critical when i say, the seafood pasta lacked seasoning.  It could have been something as simple as adding more salt.  I don't like chicken, but if you do, my partner really enjoyed the Pasta De-Nova.  Warm bread was served with cinnamon butter. Interesting.  \\n\\nKudos to the bartender/waiter for recommending the peanut butter and chocolate pie.  For the serious peanut butter lovers.  Orgasmic!!!  Sent me over the edge. For real.

Well, let me rephrase that...I'm not a coffee lover unless it has alcohol in it.

We felt so terrible that no amount of water or Advil could touch our throbbing heads. We had already planned to meet up with some friends that night and didn't want to flake, so we dragged our sorry butts out. Drinking was the last thing we felt like doing, but they suggested a Spanish coffee to make us feel better. We reluctantly tried one and all was right in the world again. It was an instant hangover cure, and I was forever hooked.\\n\\nFast forward several years to the Cypress Room at Kennedy School. That's the former grade school that's been turned into several bars, restaurant and movie theater by the McMenamins. We were tired, didn't feel like a lemon drop and thought a Spanish coffee would give us a lift. The bartender suggested a Moroccan coffee instead. It's like a Spanish coffee but instead of triple sec, they use Baileys. It's a mixture of 151, Baileys, Kaluha, coffee and a touch of cinnamon. It's simply divine and goes down so easy.\\n\\nNext time you're hungover, cold or just want to try an awesome drink, head to Kennedy School. \\n\\nTip: Forget sitting inside.

Along with a beef arepa, beef empanada, dulce de leche pastry, and a tiramisu. The pan de bono was AMAZING because it was hot and just a pillowy ball of goodness. It's as if the cheese and bread dough combined into a chewy texture on the inside and crispy outside. I could probably eat 4 in one sitting. The empanada was just as good as your typical empanada. The main star was the arepa, which you have to wait a good 5-7 minutes for since it's fresh and made to order. Be sure to get the cilantro sauce to smother all over your arepa. The corn pocket is thin and crispy with juicy beef and cheese stuffed inside. The meat is super flavorful with the crumbly cheese as a compliment. The tiramisu really hits the spot if you're not quite full from the other goodies. The mousse is airy while the espresso soaked cake is very aromatic and helps the dessert not to be super sweet. \\n\\nOverall, I've found my favorite place to go whenever I want something fast and delicious.

They were fully staffed (about 4 waiters and 3 additional people in the kitchen and a manager...that's a lot of people for the tiny place) which would make you think they would be on top of everything...however there is such a thing as \\"too many cooks in the kitchen\\".\\nThey were very disorganized and I could see everything because I was sitting at the bar. It seemed that everyone was doing everything but nothing was getting done if that makes sense. My order was delayed because it was burnt and they had to re do it, my friend's dish was not what she ordered so we had to send it back for them to get the right order out.\\nIn spite of that, the food was quite delicious and the manager/owner came to us and apologized and comped the food that came out late. That is always a nice thing to do.\\nI strongly recommend they work on their presentation. Their sandwiches have absolutely no garnish and they don't even cut them in half which was kind of weird. Maybe a drizzle of some sauce or something to dress up the plain white plate their sandwich is served on would make it more appealing and equal the superb taste.\\nI also recommend they assign roles: one person is in charge of making the juices/extracts, the other of making tea/coffee...maybe that way they could avoid confusion. This particularly strikes me as odd because this place is owned by the same person Machu Picchu restaurant so you would think they already know the gist of managing a restaurant.\\nI am looking forward to coming back as they were very kind and apologetic and the food was quite tasty and different, with a mix of Salvadorian, Mexican and Peruvian dishes to try from and the prices are quite reasonable."},{"name":"Inka Chicken","address":"1707 Wells Branch Pkwy","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I almost never write a review, but I had to this time!

My experience in a nutshell was just that:  the food and service were good, but the place was filthy, even more so than I expected it to be.  \\n\\nI went during lunchtime and I was pleasantly surprised that it wasn't busy.  There were only 3 customers there when I arrived.  Despite this, there were only 2 clean tables to sit at.  I was greeted promptly by a sweet waitress named Angelica.  I had had to grab a menu from a spot on the counter and I had to hold the menu at the very edges because it was so filthy with splashes and smudges of food.  Somehow my fingers still ended up with something sticky on them.\\n\\nI had no idea what to order, and apparently there was a \\"big,\\" more complete menu that I wasn't given.  I ordered hashbrowns with chilli and cheese and asked for a pecan waffle for after the meal.  I didn't ask for a particular size hashbrown dish, but the waitress gave me a \\"regular,\\" which is the small, and it was plenty filling enough.  My food came relatively quickly. And when I was nearing the end of the hashbrowns my waitress had my waffle made, so I only waited a couple of minutes for it to come out fresh, which I preferred to having it ready too early and get cold.  The hashbrown dish was pretty good (but then I was starving) and the waffle was very good.  My complete bill came out to only $7.42, which was awesome!  I did hate to give the waitress such a paltry tip since 20% of that is still so little, so I gave a little extra.\\n\\nThe waitress invited me to come back and I really don't know if I will just because it was that filthy (but I wouldn't rule it out).  When I say filthy, I mean that it needed to be hosed down badly of all the food residue and trash on the tables, but there was no \\"sewage\\" like some other reviewer put it.  (I don't know why he would come to the conclusion that it was sewage instead of just dirty water, which I didn't see anyway.)  But at least what you see is what you get.

I understand why.  I decided to order the portobello mushroom panini, but of course I wanted to make a few minor changes.  Simple ones though.  No peppers, different type of cheese.  I asked for it on a croissant, opted to have the 'side' for $1, and thought that all was going to be well.  I get all the way to work to dive in and my face fell when I looked at the 2 ounce size of cole slaw that I had been hoodwinked to purchase.  I am NOT exaggerating.  It was literally the size of a ramekin that you get if you go to Hardees and get the ketchup in the little plastic cup.  WHAT?  I ate it, it was okay, I think... but I really didn't have enough to taste.  On to this sandwich.  Bite...  hmm... that isn't what I expected.  Bite... WHA???  NO CHEESE!  They done put a mushroom on a daggone croissant and charged me nearly $10?  No sir!  I called them back to let them know that I'd be coming back to pick up the correct sandwich.  They initially told me that they would be happy to fix it for me when I got back, no... I am on lunch, I need it ready.  I recited the specifications of what I needed on the phone and walked back over with the first sandwich.  I get there, no one was able to speak with me because there were about 4 other folks orders that they had messed up & were correcting.  Finally someone paid attention to me, they gave me an order, I walk out & a sneaking suspicion told me to look at the order.  Its wrong.  I take it back inside and they say that they are fixing it again.  After another 10 minutes, I finally get a sandwich.  I am starving at this point, so I have told myself that no matter what... I am eating this sandwich.  It was a gross, sloppy mess with tons of pesto sauce that had the cheese & mushroom swimming on it.  They never bothered to take any of the old sandwiches, so I took them back to the office & gave out lunch to a few of my co-workers.  I made sure to let them know that I wasn't pleased on their website feedback.  I don't think that they cared or they have so many complaints, they haven't gotten back to me yet.  \\n\\nI'm not going back, it doesn't look like the rest of downtown is taking to them well either.

Not in my opinion--factor in the attitude I got (or didn't receive) from the staff at FotM and I'll take Rockin Wings anyday of the week.\\n\\nIf you're not completely stuffed I highly suggest the deep fried cheesecake--the Banana with strawberry sauce will rock your world!\\n\\nLong live the wing!"},{"name":"The Optimist","address":"914 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"After a quick lunch of she-crab soup with shrimp toast and a few east coast oysters, I'm sold.

Krystal made our night. She was very knowledgeable of the menu, drinks, gave us a few suggestions and was ready to serve us.

We all ordered H2O and they have a variety of alcoholic beverages, wines and coke products. I ordered an Arnold Palmer, but ended up getting sweet tea due to them only having pink lemonade. The tea was really sweet. I added water to the glass to dilute it. We ordered fried shrimp and crab cakes as appetizers. Sweet baby Jesus, the shrimp is huge and the taste was everything you want your shrimp to be. The crab cakes were not as big as they should have been, but nonetheless were good too. As for our main courses, I ordered the Asian Lamb chops, with mash potatoes and substituted my asparagus for collard greens (don't judge me, I heart good collards). My chops were prepared medium (just smack your momma, sista, auntie, whoever because the chef that prepared my lamb cooked it to perfection) and the collards had a spice to them(no pork is used to prepare their collards: turkey instead).  My mash potatoes where fine, nothing really special.

Everyone was pleased with their food, except the Caesar salad. The portion did not match the $13 price. \\n\\nOverall, we all enjoyed our evening and food. I was hesitant on eating here because of the mixed reviews, but you must try it for yourself. We met the chef for the night and gave him his props, because a brother did his thing in the kitchen.

We were referred by a friend of a friend who said this place has an amazing brunch menu. Needless to say, we were eager to give it a try. First things first, it is hardddddddd to get a reservation here, so make sure you book at least a week in advance. Because of my mistake we ended up missing our original reservation and had to sit outside on a horribly hot and stuffy day. Despite this we were still super pumped about the food. \\n\\nWe arrived after the other 4 people in our party were already seated. The first thing I noticed is that it took FOREVER for our waiter to come and take our drink order. When he gave us the menu I was shocked to see how limited it was. There is literally very little variety. In addition, there are only 2 items on the menu that might appeal to non seafood eaters like myself. After we placed our drink order with our waiter it took about 30-40 minutes before we received our drinks. My friend ordered an alcohol fruit drink. When she received it, it literally tasted like dish soap. She brought this to the waiters attention and he simply pointed to a blurb in the menu that basically said \\"no take backs if you don't like something.\\" He even went so far as to tell my friend that he would need to get the manager if she had questions about the disgusting drink she was given. I thought this was strange because literally every restaurant I have visited offers customer satisfaction. Not this place! You are basically on your own if something takes like crap. \\n\\nThe waiter literally left off some of our drinks and didn't return to our table for 20-30 minutes between stops (and when he did he was STILL EMPTY handed). When we paid the check he left with my credit card and didn't come back for 30 minutes. By this time I was alarmed and flagged him down. He came over to our table and asked me if I needed something.

One of my most disappointing meals in Atlanta. I had three apps and two cocktails and it was all mediocre at best. Everything tasted like a very low-class/low-brow version of food that was trying to be high-brow. The pistachios on the beet salad were soft and tasted stale, and the brie-avo combination was flavorless and creamy. I should have been able to taste more avo for sure. The oysters were SWIMMING in their sauces/sides, so the \\"crispy\\" part of the sauces was lost. Also the chow chow and aoili weren't tasty in addition to being Too Much. The salmon chips were fairly tasty, if salty and greasy, but not as good as the rave reviews made them out to be.\\n\\nCocktails were imbalanced and nothing special. I expected fresher ingredients, especially from a place that house-infuses.\\n\\nI sat at the bar, where the service was hard to get and rushed.\\n\\nIt was clearly the kind of place where regulars get special treatment, and new people aren't treated like *potential* regulars.

Even if you ask for them to change the gloves, it's still all gross. I don't eat meat so I was so upset to see that they use the same utensils for pancakes eggs French toast and greasy bacon. Everything is cooked on the same section. It's so gross, so your French toast would have a hint of grease. What about people who only eat halal or kosher?

The elevator security desk folks were cheerful and sweet, and at the front door the host was great. The table we got was fine, we made no special requests on placement (i.e. window seat). It was on the later side of a Sunday night and so we had a half full dining room.\\n\\nWe went with two Prix Fixe dinners with 3 wine pairings ($80 per head), so we mixed and matched dishes.\\n\\nLobster Bisque - It seems silly to say that a Lobster Bisque is heavy, but this was bordering on cumbersome. Menu mentions that this comes with Aleppo Chili and chives. It was viscous and lacked any of the fruity heat you might expect from Aleppo. A large bowl of heavy cream with lots of lobster flavor and plentiful chunks of well cooked meat. Not bad, but not balanced, subtle, or interesting.\\n\\nDuck Confit Pappardelle - Enjoyed this more than the soup. The root vegetables were well cut and had just the tiniest crunch without being undercooked. Montmorency Cherries in the dish seemed to add more sweet than sour notes. Again, not bad, heavier than it needed to be, but just fine.\\n\\nThe wine pairings were interesting -- very bold -- which at least allowed them to stand up to the heaviness of the food. It was a shame that the server didn't seem to know more than the grape variety. Going into the second course they poured a Cabernet that was stunningly usual, with deep coffee tones that I was not expecting. Wish I'd gotten the name on it.\\n\\nJumbo Sea Scallops - Highlight of the meal. Scallops well cooked. Edamame perhaps a tad al dente, but good. Really the great thing about this dish was the nice balance of sweet parsnip puree, scallop, brown butter soy and just the right amount of sea beans (salicornia). A well composed dish. Delicious and memorable.\\n\\nBraised Lamb Shank - Huge disappointment. Profoundly dry. Meat was stringy and chewy, polenta had half hardened into a \\"cake\\" at the bottom of the bowl, the roasted root vegetables on the dish were translucent and a tad gummy. Had the half-wilted/half-dry look of something that had been sitting under a heat lamp. Had two bites, my partner had one.\\n\\nAt this point the evening took an unfortunate turn. Plates dropped off in the reverse order (totally forgivable) but it meant awkwardly switching plates ourselves, we chatted about what we were looking at, then shortly after we had our first bites, the server came over and checked in. I said it was fine, because frankly I hadn't tried it as a whole, and I wanted to get my companion's opinion before complaining. Unfortunately I never got a second opportunity. We sat there with one empty plate, and one full plate for a little while. Eventually a gentleman came by and asked if I wanted to take it home. I said no, and he immediately put my companion's empty dish on top of mine, covering my nearly full plate, and scooted away. While the busser is not directly responsible for letting the kitchen know there's a problem, if nearly a full plate came back to the dish it would normally send off some flares to the kitchen, but it was obvious no one was going to see this plate.\\n\\nJust before dessert came I had the opportunity to tell the server that my main course wasn't good. She didn't ask for specifics or ask if I had even finished the meal. She made it clear that if I'd said something sooner maybe she could have done something. While she didn't specifically do anything wrong, I didn't appreciate being made to feel guilty for telling her the food was bad now that I had the opportunity.\\n\\nThe desserts were fine. Creme br√ªl√©e and Blackforest cake. Neither remarkable. Didn't finish either. No one offered coffee or tea. Server came over and pointedly asked if the desserts were ok. Server then dropped off two tickets to the skywalk observatory as an apology for the meal. We took the check.\\n\\nThe short of it?\\n\\nTOTH strikes me as the kind of place where no one cares about the food or the service details. It's about the view, and the table linens, expensive service ware, and a fancy glass wine cage. The service is on a par with, but possibly not as good as, say, The Cheesecake Factory. They're friendly, but that's about it. The two tickets to the SkyWalk, as opposed to either a financial apology or some other appeal to return to the restaurant tells me that even they know that their only value is as a place with a view.\\n\\nThen there's the price: somewhat friendly people don't make up for the hefty cost of a meal here. Dining here is just not worth it. With the exception of #13 (fortuitous?), I would recommend any of these other restaurants over TOTH for food with a view: http://boston.eater.com/maps/boston-restaurants-with-views-map"},{"name":"Pescatore","address":"158 Boston Ave","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"I bought into the hype, made my 6:30 reservation, and had my tail wagging on my walk from porter to ball square. I had a slight skip of the heart as I couldn't find Pescatore (the door is not on the Boston Ave side of the restaurant), but once found, the tail was wagging again. My friend and I were soon the only people in the place...but it didn't have that empty doomed feeling.  Moreso, it was almost inviting in the personal attention we were about to recieve, food and service alike.  Our waitress was exceptional, versed in friendly conversation and knowledgable, but not intrusive.  I, myself, have no sense of moderation, so my partner had to keep me in check when looking over the decadence on the menu.  I got distracted by the lobster fra diavlo special, and closed the menu.  My friend went with the Fruit-de-mare fra diavlo.  To give the sense of healthiness, we also got the mesculen salad, with goat cheese and seasoned walnuts.  \\n\\nThe starting bread basket with accompanying olive oil ANd olives was above average. The bread was fresh, and had I not been trying to show a little restraint, I would have decorated the oil with red pepper flakes and parmesian and indulged.  But it was my virgin tour of Pescatore, and it was only bread, so it was one and done.\\n\\nThe salad was huge, and very tasty.  They serve the dressing on the side, so if it's drowned, it's your own fault.  The walnuts were slightly sweet, which balanced the acidity of the dressing, the greens were fresh, and the goat cheese was plentiful and creamy.  We both had to temper our appetites and cease before we spoiled our meals, but my friend took it home with her for today's lunch.  It was a good call.\\n\\nOur meals were abundant.  I got mine with the homemade fussili, my friend, linguine. I don't particularly get why people don't select homemade over made everytime, and i was not disappointed.  The fussili had a nice chewy texture, the spirals caught the fra diavolo for that little something extra with each bite. The lobster tails were in-shell, and just a little tough.  As a treat, the dish also included mussles and clams.  I am still partial to the fra diavlo at giacomo's, as was my friend, but we agreed this was still an 8.3 as opposed to giacomo's 9.2 (both well above average).  I ate all the shell-fish, as they don't keep quite as well, and will have tasty spicy noodles for days to come. color me marinara.\\n\\nAt the moment, Pescatore does not have a liquor license, and though maybe a glass of wine woulda been nice, there's also something pretty sweet about being able to have a great meal, but be impossibly challenged to make the bill for a dinner-of-two to exceed $50.  We were deliciously satisfied, had leftovers galore, and it was still on the cheap.\\n\\nSo my overall opinion?  For straight up italian, head 2 blocks up to Lil Vinnys.  But if you're hankering for an intimate place with fresh ingredients, a wonderful waitstaff, a budget, and probably one of my top somerville destinations (with redbones, lil vinnys, greek corner), it's a sure bet.

My friend asked her what she would recommend out of two dishes and she replied \\"both\\" with an eye roll as if she was annoyed. We had to ask her to refill our drinks after she came to our table and saw our empty glasses. Our food took over an hour to come out and they gave us what looked like sliced Subway buns to hold us over. She also told another friend that they only had Swiss cheese which im guessing was a lie because the cook didn't want any changes to the dish or she just didn't want to tell him. \\n\\nI will say that our waitress did ask for us a 15% discount for our food taking so long and the manager approved. That was the only positive from the service. We were also informed that groups of 5 or more received one check and they could only take 3 forms of payment which was the biggest pain in the butt. I don't think I will be back. There's nothing on the menu that was outstanding, but it was worth trying once. They are very strict with the dress code.

I was iffy since my experience with the meat always tends to be way too dry and tough, but decided I would just listen and try it. I have no regrets and am so glad I asked for extra meat because it was delicious. The ramen noodle portion itself seemed a bit small though.\\n\\nI came on a Monday night so it wasn't that long of a wait (~10 minutes). I think it was pretty nice that they had a waitlist where they could notify you when your table was ready as opposed to having to sit and wait in their small waiting room.

Parking would be tough as well since it's only street parking. \\n\\nI didn't really like the set up of the tables too much. I don't usually like to share tables with strangers because I find it a bit  awkward. It's not really that much of a major issue to knock off a star.

Since we were flying out of Orlando, we decided to stay at a hotel near the airport and searched for vegan-friendly restaurants in the Orlando area. To my surprise, we found a nearly all-vegan Chinese restaurant located right in Orlando. After suffering in a non-vegan friendly area all week, this was a real treat.\\n\\nThe Garden Cafe reminded me of other wonderful vegan Chinese restaurants I've been to in the past like the Loving Hut chain and the now defunct Vegetable Garden previously located in Maryland. The outside appearance and inside decor left much to be desired, but that wasn't why we went there. From the outside, the bars on the windows might be a bit off-putting, but don't let that deter you as good stuff awaits inside. Inside, there was a television showing Asian movies and paper lanterns hanging from the ceiling. But, the oddest thing was really the random sci-fi nature pictures on the wall like the horse below. Odd.\\n\\nThe menu was pretty extensive with faux seafood, poultry, pork, beef, and lamb dishes as well as vegetable- and tofu-based dishes. We started with an order of steamed dumplings filled with cabbage, served with an unusual sauce that I just couldn't place.\\n\\nFor my entree, I ordered the house chicken, which was described as delicious on the menu so how could it not be?! Oh, and it was delicious although, as usual, not spicy enough. The \\"chicken\\" was made of soy protein and had a nice, chewy texture. It was served with cauliflower, zucchini, carrots, and broccoli in a black bean sauce.\\n\\nZach went with the Orange Beef, which was also soy protein in a brown subtle orange-flavored sauce with carrots, mushrooms, bamboo, and broccoli.\\n\\nWe both couldn't decide which one we liked better because they were both delicious. The portions were huge though and afterwards we felt like we could have just split one entree. I'm glad we didn't though. Plus, there are no desserts so it isn't like we missed out on anything by eating large entrees. Oh, and I should mention - I told the waitress that I was aware that they didn't have a website. She told me that they did and gave me a take-out menu that showed www.gardencafevege.com as their website, but when  I went to it, it was all in Chinese other than the word \\"BMW.\\" I don't think this is their website. I find it funny that they don't know if they have a website or not, but whatever.\\n\\nThe entrees were both $12.95 and for the portion size, I think that was a pretty good price.

I made a reservation in advance, requesting window seating, and when I arrived I was seated at a table furthest away from the window. I asked to be relocated and was told I would have to wait in line (with no reservation) for another hour. Obviously everyone wants to be seated by the windows, so the restaurant should have two reservation options: one for windows and one for any available seating. It was a special occasion and we only picked the restaurant to have the views. Instead the seating is left to timing, and the couple who cut in front of us in line was able to take the window seats. Our waiter and food was fine, but not great. I had the scallops which were good, but cold as though the dish had been sitting out far too long. Since we were seated far from the windows we decided to walk around the restaurant afterwards, only to be greeted with signs that said this was not an observation area and we could not walk around. So we went to the observation deck on the floor below to finally get some pictures of the views only to find it was closed for the night.

The hash browns seemed like they came straight from the supermarket freezer. The waiter described them like Waffle House hash brown and he didn't lie maybe even worse as in a place like folk art I would expect better quality. \\n\\nTheir lunch is also really good and affordable. My husband had the shrimp po boy which was Amazing!!! Shrimp was flavorful fried to perfect crispy State! The fries were also good! I had the grill cheese it's been voted to be the best in Atlanta. Although really good I guess I expected more but might be that I make a really good girl cheese at home. It's the best I've tried outside my house but would order the shrimp po boy before the grill cheese. The tomato soup was delightful with the sandwich and I'm not a tomato soup fan. Great job! I had the Mac and cheese and thought it was only ok. \\n\\nIn sum must get:\\nBreakfast-lobster Benedict and huevos rancheros \\nLunch - shrimp po boy \\n\\nParking is tricky in the neighborhood as your car will get towed in residential parking only, at night it's worth parking in the valet and tipping a couple dollars.

It starts off slightly sweet with the mango, has a middle kick of spice, and ends with the savory taste of the scallops and kabayaki sauce.

Not the best I've had but it was flavorful enough to say ok, they know what they doin and the portion size was pretty good. The collard greens were a five out of ten but I appreciate them using turkey. The Mac and cheese is a winner. I needed to add salt for my taste but the texture and execution is top notch. They also had ribs and pulled pork but strangely no BBQ chicken which I found a lil weird. Other menu items included fried chicken, wings, burgers and desserts. It's tight in there, maybe the size of a large elevator but there is a patio with tables and umbrellas as long as you don't mind looking at the back of a gas station.

That genre, by the way, is the Harvey's of San Francisco and Hamburger Mary's of everywhere genre.\\n\\nWe were here on Christmas, so it can't be said it was a fair trial of this place.  If they have a more limited menu or different staff or whatever, it's to be expected on Christmas.  I don't think that changed too much, though, except maybe making the general mood of the place more laid back, and that's fine by me.\\n\\nThere was, unfortunately, nothing too special to speak of.  The food and staff were what you would expect from what you should be expecting this place to be.  The first problem, however, is that you're probably not expecting it to be what it is.  So, let's start there.  Tiger Lily?  That is not the name for an American restaurant and bar.  It's the name for an Asian restaurant.  Lesson #1 in the restaurant business, don't make your place confusing.  And, looking at the logo posted on Yelp, the tiger and lily drawings don't help, either.  I hate to say it, but change your name now, while you still can.  You don't want to be the Cougar Town of Vancouver dining.\\n\\nOddity #2: More name issues.  Tiger petals?  What does that mean?  There was no explanation of what these \\"tiger petals\\" were on the menu.  I assumed they were onion petals, and I decided to get whatever weird named tater tots they had, instead.  I was glad I did.  The tiger petals ended up being sliced potato fries, and they didn't look very good.  The food was all fine, nothing special, but nothing too terribly wrong with it.  About what you'd expect out of a diner, you just may not be expecting this place to be a diner.\\n\\nComplaint #3/1: This is the third thing to point out, but really the only complaint I actually had.  We're here.  We're eating your food.  Let your food, service, ambiance, whatever speak for itself.  Don't make your guests feel like they're being held hostage until they succumb to the brainwashing that you want them to receive.  It wasn't just us, either, I heard it being done to the next table, as well.  We had to listen to what they want the restaurant to become, what they're doing with the remodel, what they have planned for events, etc.  If you want people to know about these things, advertise.  Or, have something to hand out, notes on the table, whatever.  Don't make us feel like we're in school and we're not allowed to go to our next class until we have met all of your teaching goals for today.  This is the only thing that would actually make me question coming back here.  I really don't want to go through it again.\\n\\nAs I said, I think a place like this is a good thing for Vancouver.  I don't know if it will survive or not, but it would be nice if it did . . . just hire a PR expert or something."},{"name":"The Optimist","address":"914 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Delicious!!

I grabbed a menu and browsed. There are sandwiches in addition to the pizza and you can get slices. Beer and dessert are available.

I adore red peppers and hey, since I practically ate meat the entire trip I decided why not have my last Austin meal be full of steaming meat? \\n\\nWe waited...and we waited. We picked an inopportune time, the lunch rush, to try to get our pizza eating on. After about, what I would say, 45 minutes our pizza was ready for us.

The most anticipated of these was the arnold palmer but it really didn't taste like iced tea. It was tangy for a second and then the taste went away and it was basically a vanilla doughnut. Sadly, I didn't get to taste the others because I handed them out, but everyone really liked the maple bacon bar. The cock n balls was pretty mediocre, but I did enjoy the texture of the doughnut. \\n\\nDefinitely a must when in Portland, but next time I might stick with the more extreme versions like grape and fruit loops just because you can't be disappointed with something so creative. \\n\\nBeware that the line can be long (and it's rainy and chilly) and that there aren't any descriptions for the doughnuts.

The menu is humble but extensive. It includes some of the deepest cuts of Southern cuisine, and of course their vegetable menu is particularly strong, including several souffles, potlikker, turnip greens, AND collard greens.

At a place that prides itself on being able to order in a unique way, this seemed simple enough.

This sounded good, but when it was all delivered my wife's fish was delivered with the 3rd starter, and my entree came out by itself almost 30 minutes later.\\n\\nThat's a big mess up.  My wife had a hard time enjoying her main course, because I didn't have much food in front of me.  I scarfed down my goat entree like it was a race because I felt weird eating it alone.

I like calamari, so I went with it. The portion they brought out was very large. It was served with a red sauce and several slice of lemon. The sauce was tomato based and super spicy. It just seemed to have a one note flavor: spicy. The calamari itself was pretty good. Maybe not the best I've ever had and like with any dish of this kind, it was better hot and fresh. \\n\\nThey bring plenty of bread sticks to the table as well. They were nice and soft and the ones we were served were warm. I think the biggest disappointment was in the entrees ordered. I ordered chicken picatta. The chicken was cooked well, but the pasta was overcooked and the mushrooms in the dish didn't seem fresh, more like canned mushrooms.

While I lived in Atlanta for 2 years, and have a southern belle girlfriend, I will always be a northerner at heart.  That said, like many of you, I have a soft spot for southern cooking - that delicious combination of butter and butter and frying.  While dating my lovely girlfriend, she has taken me to a number of authentic southern cooking establishments in Atlanta, with the most recent being Mary Mac's. And like the others before it, I have to go with 5 stars.  This is southern cooking and butter and frying and butter and butter at its finest.\\n\\nAs other tipsters and reviewers have noted, if you have never been before, they will bring you a sample of their Pot Likker with Cracklin' bread.  Apparently, collard greens are made in some kind of pork broth and this is the left over pork drippings after the collard greens are made.  Cracklin bread is cornbread.  Anyway, I've never been a fan of collard greens, but this...oh lord was this delicious.  Imagine the best tasting pork you can think of, then liquefy it into a soup.\\n\\nFor my entree, I had to go with the fried chicken.  They offer it 2 ways - a breast and 3 legs, or essentially a half a chicken, which is what I had.  This tends to me my \\"go-to\\" in a southern restaurant because if you claim to be southern, but do not have the best fried chicken in 10 counties, then you should have your southern cooking card shredded.  I never eat fried chicken otherwise - I love it, but you know, heart attacks scare me.  Anyway, this was slap yo momma good.  And how good is that?  It is so good that if someone told you that you could only have some if you slapped your momma, you would gladly do it for one bite.\\n\\nThe entrees come with 2 sides, and I went with sweet potato souffle and cornbread dressing and gravy.  Before I go on, can we stop calling it dressing, please?  Dressing is what goes on a salad.  Or, dressing is what you do before you leave the house (unless you're senile or live in a nudist colony).  Otherwise, it is stuffing.  And I don't care if it didn't actually stuff anything.\\n\\nAnyway, where was I? Oh yeah - this is a tremendous amount of food and every bite was delicious.  The souffle was cinnamonny and sweet potatoey good.  The STUFFING was fantastic - loved the gravy - and the chicken was, again, phenomenal.  They even bring out a basket of yeast roles and corn bread, and warm cinnamon rolls.  We saved the cinnamon rolls for dessert and had them with coffee, which was also fantastic coffee.\\n\\nI think anyone giving this place less than 4 stars should have their yelp privileges revoked.  You people are nuts.\\n\\nSome advice - first, they take reservations, but not on the weekends.  I called at 5:30 on Saturday and they weren't on a wait yet, but when we showed by 6:00, it was a 30 minute wait.  Tables of 2 will get sat much faster as multiple parties of 2 and 3 who showed up after us were sat within minutes.  Problem is a lot of large parties show up.  The restaurant is very big, and while the parties move fast, when they have parties of 7, 10, 15 and 20 on their wait-list, a party larger than 4 is going to take some time to get sat.  Also, the ordering is a bit strange - they give you an ordering card and pencils, and you write down your own order.  I assume this is to prevent people from claiming the server messed up their order, but it was weird.  Guess what I am saying is, make sure someone in your party knows how to write.\\n\\nDidn't mention the service, but that was excellent as well.  Very friendly, helpful, and honest.  My girlfriend asked for a recommendation between a couple of items, and the server gave her opinion of one, but was honest and said she hadn't had another.  She could have just pushed her to that one (which I think was more expensive), but she didn't.\\n\\nOne final point - we went with her mom and 2 nieces.  The young girls are picky eaters, but loved their fried chicken and apple sauce.  As for her mom - this woman knows southern cooking like no ones business.  She's a fantastic cook, even if she does believe in 1 stick of butter per person per entree (but really, who doesn't believe in that?).  And she loved her seafood platter and fried okra.  We were concerned she'd pan it, but she really enjoyed herself, too.\\n\\nIf you're in Atlanta, stop here.  You won't regret it.  You may have a heart attack before it's all over, but you'll die happy."},{"name":"De Novo","address":"201 S High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"Great time.....good food & music.

Sushi Me is probably the worst sushi place in Beaverton. For starters, when you walk in the restaurant smells rancid, I thought I'd accidentally wandered into a fish slaughter house.

She had no customer service skills and made up additional conditions to the all you can eat (conditions that weren't listed on their 'rule sheet'). Don't waste your time coming here.

Importantly though, the wait staff does speak fluent English, and have always been very friendly and helpful. \\n\\nBut onto the food. For under $5, I typically buy two items that are superb, and that I've never seen anywhere else. The chicken and hearts of palm Pastel ($2.50) is a generously portioned Brazilian fried turnover filled with seasoned shredded chicken and hearts of palm. The combination is really well balanced, and the hearts of palm add a depth and consistency usually not found in a fried food. And because this is a bakery, I get the \\"Sonho\\" dessert ($2), which the owner told me means \\"dream\\" in Portuguese. Its basically a donut-like pastry filled with a creme that exceeds any superlatives I can think of at this moment. It's THAT good. \\n\\nLastly there is the iced coffee. Let me start by saying this: I don't drink coffee. I don't like coffee. But I LOVE Modelo's iced coffee. At $2, it far exceeds anything you can get at Dunkin', as this is Brazilian coffee with lots of cane sugar mixed in. \\n\\nPanificadora Modelo is simply one of those truly special hole-in-the-wall places that you feel great about when you find.

My husband and I searched Yelp for reviews of a nice restaurant for our trip to Atlanta. We stumbled upon The Optimist and MAN am I glad that we did! We started out by sharing the seafood gumbo appetizer and it had such a different consistency that made it stand out from the rest. The garlic bread that they paired with it was also phenomenal to dip into the gumbo. I had the Lobster Risotto and my husband had the Scallops. The risotto had pumpkin seeds in it which made for a very unique smoky taste that was out of this world. The scallops were seared and very tender, or \\"perfect\\" as my husband said. We shared two sides that were a la carte that we are SO glad we decided to order. The creamy grits and the hush puppies were amazing. The grits were the perfect texture and the hush puppies were served topped with powdered sugar beignet style. I have never seen this before, but it made a world of a difference in taste. It was like a miniature dessert during dinner. Our waitress, Melody, was also a pleasure. She was very sweet and helped us make our decisions for dinner. She made sure our glasses were always full and we were happy with our meal. When we told her we were from out of town, she thanked us for choosing their restaurant and brought us complimentary The Optimist koozies as a nice keepsake of hands down one of the best restaurants/meals we have ever had.

You'll have to deal with people asking a million questions about what's what, asking for samples, and taking photos with their donuts, especially those brave souls who buy the phallic-shaped ones.\\n\\nSince I'm an engineer and I fix roads for a living, it seemed fitting to try the pothole donut (chocolate, cream filling, Oreos). I couldn't even get through half of it without running out of coffee to balance out the sweetness overload. I also made the mistake of buying a second donut (Portland creme) which I couldn't finish either. Between the two, I struggled to finish what amounted to one full donut.\\n\\nYou'll see lots of people buy entire boxes. I saw a group of four tourists each walk out with their own individual boxes, and they attempted to eat them in the table area in the alleyway. Those poor souls...\\n\\nOne final HUGE complaint: all their coffee stuff (creamer, sugar, etc.) is on top of the trash can. They can't even spare a little bit of counter space? How does this place not get shut down from this alone? Get your coffee across the alley instead."},{"name":"Pho Goodness","address":"1150 Davie Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Good pho place considering it is in Downtown. \\nFirst impression was negative, apparently clean but actually dirty.

This was my first time at Pannullos.\\nI work as a server while going to college.\\n\\nThe food here is incredible honestly, I had the bruschetta which was amazing and then stuffed shells which are my favorite. My girlfriend got the frutti di mare and she absolutely loved it. The scallops tasted so fresh.\\n\\nThe only part that really got to me was just how poorly we were treated. It was a Monday and I had set a reservation for my birthday, I just wanted good food I didn't really care about much, I'm an easy going guy. So we were sat by our waiter Carlos who took around 8-10 min to even get our drink order. When he finally dropped off our drinks, he didn't ask us if we had any questions about the menu or wanted to start with an appetizer and walked away quickly. It was not busy in the restaurant. There were about four tables sat including us. There were quite a few staff members just walking around. After another 10 mins go by, a waitress comes up and says very hastily, \\"are you ready to order?\\" She didn't introduce herself or anything. This restaurant is a decently nice place with entrees ranging from $15-45 and I felt like we were being treated like we were in a Waffle House at 2 am. It was also confusing why Carlos handed us off to another server, especially when the restaurant was dead. Did he think because we were in our 20s we would not tip? The waitress had a weird tone, throughout our dinner, almost condescending. She was very passive aggressive about me ordering a wine to go with my meal and cut me off when I spoke. Every time she came to check on us, she would basically sigh like taking care of our table was an extreme inconvenience. The manager pre bussed our table for us and picked up our check when I needed my card to be ran, and he was very nice.  We just played the entire situation cool and tipped correctly enjoyed our food and went about our night, but just the whole dinner was just so unprofessional. Restaurants thrive from not only the food quality, but for the experience. Like I said, the food was delicious, but I may only be coming back to order take out. \\nBtw, our server was Sydney.

He DID NOT APPOLOGIZE... He simply looked at my wet pants and said, \\" let me get you another drink.\\"  SERIOUSLY?!?!?'  This of course detracted from our dinning experience and so at the conclusion of our meal I asked for this \\"manager\\" in question so that he could explain to our server (blond haired female who was actually excellent) why she was not getting any tip... after 10 minutes where the manager in question did not come, I had to once again request the actual manager that we were dealing with and when he did come it seemed to be such a BURDEN to him... I myself worked in the customer service industry for over five years and what my girlfriend and I experienced here is by far THE WORST customer service ever.

Went last night for a 6:30 reservation. First the positives. \\n\\nService was fast and knowledgeable. The fresh made bread was delicious, hot buttery and a great start. Got a half dozen oysters half east coast, half west coast. They were wonderful! Without a doubt overpriced but they are so fresh and tasty that I really didn't mind. \\n\\nUnfortunately we went downhill from there. Followed with:\\n\\n-Frothy She Crap Soup  - very very buttery, wads of oil floating on the top... yuck. Shrimp toast that accompanied it was DELISH though\\n-Little Gem Salad - essentially a ceaser, nothing to write home about and started a trend for the rest of the meal of everything being overly salted. I am not at all sensitive to salt so this is a lot for me to notice.\\n\\nFor entrees we had the Scallops and Skate wing, again very very salty but once we gave them a splash of lemon they were very tasty.\\n\\nThe real downer was the sides. We had the roasted beets which were tasty and standard to many other restaurants around town. We also had the gnocchi and potato puree. They were both TERRIBLE. The gnocchi were so soft, literally boiled to death and very little flavor. The potato puree had been whipped to death and literally dripped off a spoon... like soup. Disgusting.\\n\\nWe then followed with literally the worst dessert I've ever had. Grilled pound cake with ice cream and fried peanuts. The pound cake was so dry, it was below grocery store quality. The cake had no warmth but grill marks.. how long had it been sitting around? Ew!\\n\\nThe thing that really made me lose it were the two floor hostesses who I had perfect view of all night. Clearly neither have been trained on how to serve because both of them had their fingers in peoples plates all night. One of them would not stop playing with her hair, eyes, teeth everything and then taking plates from the window. I meant to call today and complain on this matter because it was truly disgusting.\\n\\nBottom line - so many kinks to works out, expensive menu, lots of potential.

Maybe I'm not as picky with my burgers, maybe the stars were aligned for a stellar experience, I don't know.

I already liked that as I hate ordering a burger and drink with a server and paying tip for a food that costs next to nothing to make.  That brings up a good note to make while on topic.  Prices here are a bit high for a burger.  Not sure that's a Canada thing, or just a Vera's thing.\\n\\nI ordered the four cheese burger which included feta, blue, cheddar, and provolone.  Perhaps that hightened my experience as these four cheeses blended really well and made the burger very flavorful.  I also had \\"the usuals\\" on there.  I ordered a side of sweet potato fries. I didn't have an excessive wait time.  Maybe 10 or 15 minutes.

Four out of the six in our group have or still are waiting tables and would have tipped him the requisite amount for the time he worked and if I understand the law correctly, it is ILLEGAL to charge a tip unless the group is 8 or larger.

The bread basket including cinnamon rolls, cornbread and buttery dinner rolls. The dinner rolls were best... The rest just mediocre.\\n\\nYou order yourself by writing down on individual sheets. Ok. No problem. Our server came by and noticed we wrote down fried okra which he put in first. Then after we finished writing down our orders, our server was no where to be seen. Waited like 10 minutes before he showed and I was like can we place our order? He was like oh I thought I put it in? Uhhh... You only took the appetizer order and then left us hanging. My friend's sweet milk, which tasted just like 2% milk, came out super late too while I got my water downed fruit punch right away. Finally order put in.\\n\\nThe meals came out fast, however order came out a bit wrong. They got our sides mixed up and forgot my friend's fried green tomatoes.

After encountering some vehicle trouble and becoming stranded (as well as *starving*), I made the judgement call to check out Alle Amin after smelling an intense aroma that reminded me of Halal food back home in New York. The place was close to empty and the vibe was divey, just the way I like it.\\n\\nAs it turns out, Alle Amin has barely been around a year and was still relatively \\"undiscovered\\" as the manager explained. The menu was small, barely a page in length, with just enough dishes that covered the spectrum of simple veggie dishes and rice + meat combos. As it was explained to me, the food is largely Somali and contains influences from Europe, SE Asia, and Africa. After ordering a hot Somali tea (a spicy cinnamon), I went with the Hilib Ari - a rice plate with stewed goat meat.\\n\\nThe result was something wonderful. Upon arrival the food was piping hot, full of aromatic notes that would make any hungry hippo salivate upon consumption. The textures of the meat and rice had me thinking of Indian cuisine briefly, though the goat was stewed in a way where the only reference I had was something similar I had from travels in the Caribbean. Nonetheless, Portland needs more of this food and badly.\\n\\nAlso had an order of the sambussa, which was essentially an African samosa. I opted for the chicken version, which was delightful: chunky bits of juicy meat, and a nice crunch from the perfectly fried exterior. Throw in a bit of hot sauce and an appetite to boot, this is probably a near perfect appetizer.\\n\\nEventually someone came to relieve me and offer me a ride home. Thank goodness I was finished with the meal at this point, or I would've never wanted to leave.

Also upon occasion, donut disappointment. \\n\\nParking is street only which means there is no parking. There is a garage not any too far away(naito/davis and or the us bank tower), and the  local light rail stop isn't even a block away. Like a lot of things in portland you are best served by getting here some way that does not involve  driving a car. \\n\\nI won't lie. This spot is gimmicky. There will often be lines, especially on weekend mornings. It's cash only and you won't get luxurious customer service. Some-but not all of the stuff seems overpriced for what you get especially the cock and balls. Sure it's enough chocolate frosted cinnamon roll to conceivably feed three people, (Normal people I mean. For folks like my bransonville cousin Big Jim, it's only enough for one. And for the love of god don't stay to watch him eat it.) but at the end of the day it's just a funnily (funny as in hur hur hur, not funny ha ha) ten dollar cinnamon roll. The triple chocolate is pretty decent but the addition of the cereal topping arguably detracts from the chocolate cake richness. on the plus side the signature voodoo donut is consistently the best here. Nothing at all wrong with the standard non gimmicky line of donuts,and they typically are very wallet friendly. \\n\\nFor those that don't want that line (like me. I don't do lines. Life is too short) there are some alternatives. For starters there is another voodoo donut close by which typically has less of a line because it's not THE original location. Which somehow means less mojo for folks who want the experience as opposed to those who just want to try the donut. typically less then half the line at this spot. Secondly come back on a weekday, We looked at the Sunday line and said nah. Came back the next morning at about the same time and viola! second from the counter. \\n\\nSo I get some of the complaints, but I kinda liked it.

My criticisms - I'm a small person, prefer small portions and with 3 courses I wasn't full. I think that if you have mostly fish and meat, it won't be a problem. But since I only eat fish and otherwise vegetarian, it's difficult to be full on 3 courses. If you're a pure vegetarian, male sure and order pasta and/or bread.  I've had good bread here before.

I come here just about every other day whether it be the drive-thru or dine in. I could seriously go on and on about this place. Instead, I'll give a summarized list of the joys this place has to offer. \\n\\n1. Prompt service. No matter how long the drive-thru is, you can guarantee the employees are working their hardest to get you through in a timely manner. \\n\\n2. The employees. The service is unmatched. When you're dining in, you're likely to get an older waitress/waiter that cares so much about you and your order. They take your order with care, the cook cooks it like he's cooking for his own family, and he gives you the portion size he would give himself. (No seriously, order an omelet.)\\n\\n3. The menu. Unlike the other locations you're not limited to fries, salad, yogurt and fruit as your side item. They have fried okra, Mac and cheese, green beans, collard greens, cornbread, and sweet potato souffl√©. All delicious. \\n\\n4. The place itself. It's 24 hours 6 days a week! Who doesn't want Chic-fil-a or their delicious (always working machine) ice cream at 2am? Andddd you get to decide. Are you in a hurry? Breeze through the drive-thru and order the regular menu. Have a little time? Sit down and try their chicken and waffle combo, or the omelet, or the infamous \\"Hot Brown\\". \\n\\nIt's truly just an humble refreshment in the Hapeville community."},{"name":"Anchovies","address":"433 Columbus Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Our favorite local place.

He already knew the best things on the menu, spoke knowledgeably about them, and was personable and frankly, very fun.  And cute.  Where is De Novo getting their servers from?  Fashion magazines and catalogs!?  \\n\\nTo start, we had a bottle of Veuve Clicquot.  We were celebrating after all!  The price was great for the bottle, and it was a perfect complement to the hot summer day.  And they put all of their chilled wines in a really cool glass ice bucket that is mounted on a glass base and tilted.  Ordering a bottle of chilled wine is worth it just for the presentation.\\n\\nThen we had the spicy ahi tuna cups, a favorite of mine, and the Kobe beef sliders.  The tuna cups were perfect as usual and the Kobe beef, which I hadn't tried there yet, were tasty and just the right kind of greasy.\\n\\nI opted for the Char Sui Pork Belly Bahn Mi for my meal.  I'm a Taiwanese guy, so I know my char sui.  It was wonderfully cooked, perfectly fatty and made a great stuffing for their delicious french bread.  And I of course had to have the truffle fries with the homemade ketchup.\\n\\nSister had the smoked chicken ravioli, bistro-sized.  It is an intimidating plate of food, but so tasty that they were gone before she realized she had really started.

So great that my sister who came out with us from DC decided to go ahead and make brunch reservations for the next morning!\\n\\nBut before I get to our brunch, I must make note of the desserts!  We had the mojito torte which was incredible.  The cake is intentionally just a little drier than moist, but that's so it can soak up and strike a balance with the delicious lime mojito cream in between the layers of cake and the delicious sauce slathered on the plate.  A true delight!  The bananas foster creme brulee had great flavor, but could have maybe been a little colder.  It was too warm and didn't really have the bite that creme brulee normally should.

We also ordered the daily feature which was the lobster wonton. I am not a big fan of wonton skin. It was ok and again was 3 pieces. Next we had the pork dumpling. I found the dumpling skin a bit thick and this one had 4 pieces. Not a big fan of the pork dumpling For main course, we got the braised pork cheeks and that was delicious. Too bad, we ordered too much appies. But I have to say the pork cheeks are tender. On the bottom is daikon (I think). Like the Chinese Daikon cake. The next main dish we ordered was the duck. I personally love duck meat. Probably because of the light gammy taste or something. I have to give that duck a 5.5 stars. It was delicious. Cooked perfectly with lots of taste. Some reason if it was served elsewhere, I would not think that this is a Chinese dish or Chinese fusion dish. For desert we had the fried mantou and it came with 2 different kind of dippings.

Went on a early Sunday evening sitting at the bar. The bartender was really good refilling my water, getting me another bottle of beer, and taking my order. The hot dogs here are very good and taking on the artisan sausage I got the Jackelope which is a rabbit/antelope fusion inside a pretzel roll topped with cheese and cranberry sauce. Its very sweet and the meat is excellent. For those who would pay around $7 for a rare finding sausage this is one of them. In addition I also had the Polish dog which is basically with mustard and sauerkraut. Also equally delicious. That one is a bit cheaper slightly over $4. Finding parking is hard and difficult but the dogs are very worth the time and effort to find a parking spot. Meat in tube form is not big here in this city compared to New York or Chicago which means finding a successful place is pretty easy. Combining a bar asesthetic to a sit down meal makes Frank stand out compared to what most people are used to when going to get a hot dog. Its hipster but damn the dogs are good."},{"name":"LYFE Kitchen","address":"1600 Pearl St","city":"Boulder","stars":"3.5","text":"Stop In for early dinner, not crowded.

In fact, I asked my mom for bacon and waffles pretty much every morning for breakfast.  Whenever she'd make me breakfast, I'd always beg for MORE BACON!  Alas, she was a good mom and would only give me on or two pieces.  One day she got fed up with my begging, and thought if she cooked me an entire package of bacon, that I'd get sick of it and never want it again, much like the old school stories you hear about parents catching their kids with cigarettes and making them smoke the whole pack to make them sick and never want to try a cigarette again.  Well, my poor mom's plan backfired.  I ate the entire package of bacon, which would be a pound, I think......and.......and then......I turned to her and said:\\n\\n\\n\\n\\"Mom, can I have some more?\\" Her plan didn't work and I have loved bacon ever since. \\n\\n \\n\\nThere's been a bacon craze lately, in which bacon has risen from unhealthy breakfast companion to hip, cool ingredient.  In fact, I've seen bacon infused liquor, maple bacon donuts, chicken fried bacon....and more!\\n\\n\\n\\nLast night we finally tried Frank, the new-ish Austin eatery that took over the building where Starlight used to be near 4th and Colorado.  They feature gourmet hot dogs, and locally made sausages, but there is a lot of bacon treats too.  We loved our meal, the atmosphere, and the waiters.  I ordered the Zweibelwurst; a locally made beer-brat with carmalized onions, kraut, and spicy mustard.  It was AMAZING.  I have never had such a tender and juicy bratwurst in all my life.  My boyfriend thought his Chicago Dog was good until he tasted my zweibelwurst, and then a major case of meal envy struck him.  We also tried the cheese waffle fries with chives, bacon, and sour cream.  I honestly was dissappointed by the fries.  They seemed like they had been cooked earlier and had been lying around under a heating lamp for a good while.  If the fries were fresh I would have given them a 5 star rating for sure!!!  \\n\\nThe service there is great and the menu has a lot of options and even has a few menu options for vegetarians. We were about to leave when I noticed a Bacon Chocolate Chip Cookie on the dessert menu.  Say What?????   So we got The Frankencookie.....which was a hot cookie made with bacon, chocolate chips, dried cranberries, and walnuts.  Then it has Amy's coffee flavored ice cream, candied bacon bits, and was decorated with a lovely bacon swizzle stick.  It was hilarious to see and delightful to eat.  \\n\\nFrank, I love you, and I will be back.

At the time the place was not packed at all so I asked if we could be seated at a booth vs. a table.  The hostess informed me that it was table booth, one side was a booth and the other a table, so I said okay.  After being seated our waitress came and took our drink order, but they were out of everything on the menu (strawberry lemonade, peach tea etc..) all due to the white party the night before, so we just took water.  We waited about 10 minutes trying to place our order, we asked another waiter to get our waitress.  She never showed, so he took our order which was Lamb Chops, the Salmon and Peach Cobbler. He repeated our order twice and 2 minutes after that our waitress came.  We told her we gave it to the other waiter, but we still repeated it to her as well.  She did not write it down either but put in our order. \\n\\nIn the meantime, the hostess sat a couple next to us at the booth table and then came back and asked the couple if they would like to move to a booth.  At this point I was livid, because from the vibe it seemed as though you had to be a couple to get a booth.  When the hostess came back I then asked her about her moving the couple to a booth when I specifically asked for a booth not a booth table!  I said do I need to be a couple to be seated in the area and she said no.  I told her at the time I was so far unhappy with the service.  She apologized and later the chef came out and stopped at our table.  He asked had we eaten yet and my mom said does it look like it since the table was empty.  He said well let me guess you ordered the Lamb Chops and the Pork Chops.  I said no, I ordered the Salmon, he looked shocked and said I know what I cooked and it was Pork Chops! I knew at that moment my food ordered had been screwed up by not 1 but 2 waiters!!  I immediately asked our waitress did she put in the Salmon, she said yes but the food was delivered with Lamb Chops and Pork Chops.  She said I'm sorry let me leave this with you and get you the Salmon. By this time my mom had been quiet long enough she told the waitress what you don't understand is that we do not eat pork, so you cannot leave this here.  I stated that you can just cancel the order and bring me a box and we are leaving.  The chef and waiters were apologetic and said we have only been open 8 days.  We would have been more understanding but how do 2 people mess up an order.  So the chef took us to the owner and the manager.  The owner's name was Charles and the manager was Steven and he gave me his card.  We recounted our story and I told them I was going to write a review about my visit. They told me please don't do that give us another chance to redeem ourselves, so I agreed I even removed my Facebook post. The owner told me to contact the manager and when I was ready to come back I would receive a complimentary meal for two.  The owner even walked us to the car and got our money back from valet, so I did leave happier and hungry.\\n\\nNow it has been 2 months I emailed Steven the manager in July and have yet to receive a response back.  I have called the restaurant and no one ever answers.  So since they did not hold up their end of the bargain I am not holding up mine.  This restaurant needs to understand the importance of customer service and following through.  I am so upset about my experience and not being able to reach anyone I don't event want to go there again.  I wanted to take a friend for her birthday but never got a response.

There was no menu, but the owner poked her head out of the kitchen and said they had beef, with ful (sort of a bean soup) and chapati. Sounded good to us-- and it was! Plenty of food for the two of us and delicious. We also loved the warm, spicy tea (cardamom, cloves, cinnamon) that came with the meal.\\n\\nWe took friends for the second visit and this time there were menus (!). On the menu it said closing time was 8 pm, but we were there at 7:15 and they said they had been about to close. Someone had also just gotten a huge order of take-out, so they were out of sambusas, and ful (both of which we had planned to order-- one friend is a vegetarian and there weren't many other veg options). The owner and her helper (son?) were very nice and made more ful for us.\\n\\nWe got the goat and spicy chicken with rice (plus ful and chapati). The vegetarian friend was able to get the rice dish with no meat, which was great. \\n\\nThe meal was good, lots of food, and we had a fair bit of leftovers-- for $10 each. This place is small and homey.

Especially for the price you pay of $3.75!  Ingredients are fresh and local -- cascade natural beef, locally sourced greens, red onions, local cheeses.  You have a choice of three cheeses; chevre, oregon bleu, and tillamook cheddar.  I'm an oinker so I ordered all three to \\"share\\" with my hubster last night.  The oregon bleu was my favorite -- totally daydreamed about the bleu cheese creaminess spread on the patty this morning..  The chevre (goat cheese) was my second favorite.  Also, the burger may seem a bit unassuming due its size, but it's filling.  If you get one cheeseburger and truffle oil fries, there is a good possibility you will feel full.  The patty is still 1/4 lb even though smaller in diameter.  Makes for a juicy and thicker patty.  Also, buns are tasty too.  \\n\\nTruffe oil fries were crispy and yummy and the truffle oil flavor didn't overwhelm the fries.  It's actually quite subtle.  The Camden's catsup is good -- it's got a little kick to it with the Sriracha component.\\n\\nFor taste rating only, I'd give this place four stars.

To my dismay the potato was boiled and the 'kale' was actually wilted spinach loaded with salt.\\n\\nMy significant other ordered mussels and clams which we typically associate with a magnificent broth that you want to dip everything into.

This past Saturday night we stayed at the Kennedy School for the first time, we have tried to stay here several times but they are booked out usually about 3 months. My wife called and was able to get a room for our anniversary. We arrived at Kennedy school at 4pm and the check in process was fantastic and full of great information. We were given our room key #105 and once we arrived we were delighted to find out it was the room we had already toured and booked last year but due to a family emergency it had to be canceled. The room is very spacious with a king size bed enormous closet and plenty of sitting areas with a desk as well. The bathroom was small but understandable as it was obviously added at a later date. Like all McMenamins there was no TV or Fridge in the room yet we are accustomed to this. Also like many older buildings the lack of air flow and high ceilings makes the room warm and you can feel warm air blowing into the room so we had to keep a window open and the fan on high. As we got settled in and began to read all about what to do we realized we needed to make a choice between watching a movie and going to the soaking pool due to the crowds in the pool and the fact that it is open to the public until 8pm and the movie started at 9pm. I headed out to the boiler room bar right across from check in to get a bucket of ice as it was stated in writing we could get ice at any bar or the restaurant. When I went into the bar I waited patiently next to the ice that was by the door waiting for the bartender to finish making a drink, after about 5 minutes he walked over and told me I had to go to the bar in the restaurant if I wanted ice this was confusing as I stood right next to the ice, I could only assume he had to bring it there himself? So I headed to the restaurant and after about a 5 minute wait I received some ice.  We headed to the soaking pool around 6:45pm to find it very crowded and loud it was also not very warm. Once 8pm came around the public guests left however there were still many children in the pool. In the room there was an information card that stated children were not allowed in the pool after 8pm so we were very surprised. At around 9pm all the kids were now gone and just us and another couple were in the pool. Suddenly a staff member came out and with the intent to alarm us stated a child had thrown up in the pool.....we immediately got out and saw large amounts of throw up on the bottom of the pool and floating. Within 30 minutes of being back in the room I began to puke uncontrollably I could only guess I had ingested some of the vomit. We understand having 10 children of our own however it would be advisable that Mcmenamins would have staff members come out to the soaking pool more often to make sure children were not jumping all over the pool and couple were not fighting both of these things we observed. The soaking pool should be relaxing and it would make sense to modify the children's hours to perhaps afternoon times say 1pm to 5pm family time? Mornings and evenings would be nice for hotel guests to relax. Sunday morning we woke up and my wife was very congested as we began to look around the room she noticed mold on the lamp shades and heavy stains on the curtains she is very allergic to mold so this created some problems. Upon departure we let the front desk know of these challenges and we were pleased to talk to Lauren who I can only assume is a manager she was very apologetic with extreme sincerity and did not charge us for our stay, this was an excellent recovery and we are thankful that she did this for us we even stayed for brunch! Then headed to the Mission Theatre for a movie. We will continue to be Mcmenamins guests and would not hold this 1 bad experience against them!

That is about the time for which the Brasserie has been my favourite restaurant in Vancouver, bar none. But perhaps that's been my problem. How does one write a review about their favourite restaurant - in a city full of great restaurants, no less? How does one write a review about a restaurant in which, quite literally, every single dish they've ever had has been stellar? I guess the answer is: I don't know. Hence the absence of a review for so long. But I can't go on any longer without at least throwing my five stars in the mix for this great place and I'll at least try to tell you why.\\n\\nDisclaimer: I'm German. Second Disclaimer: I loathe German restaurants. That is, at least the ones that cater to the 'heritage' crowd with both their ambiance and their menu dripping of stereotypical Germanophilia. Unfortunately, that covers just about every German restaurant in the GVRD, possibly in Western Canada. Every one but the Brasserie. Granted, this is really an Alsatian restaurant and the definite French influence makes a big difference. But a large number of their dishes is nonetheless essentially German, as is the chef. As I said, it's difficult to write about any dish in particular, because everything I've had there has been spectacular - both for brunch and dinner. I am, however, especially partial to their selection of small plates and the Pate de Campagne at the Brasserie is quite likely one of the best things I've ever eaten. Between the consistently amazing food, the extremely pleasant classy yet casual atmosphere and the great service, the Brasserie is everything anyone, from gourmets to gourmands (with the likely exception of vegetarians), could ever look for in a restaurant. Nouvelle cuisine it surely is not (which, just for record, I also enjoy now and then), but it is a selection of simple but outstanding ingredients, prepared to perfection every time. If you have not been to the Brasserie yet, you have been missing out on an enormous scale. Come for the buck-a-shuck ($1 oysters every night after 9pm), stay for everything else."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"So two stars for the cool concept but that's all this place is.

Baked in a traditional Aebleskiver pan and thus devoid of any semblance oiliness each of these little puffs tasted like a nice quality buttermilk pancake and when paired with the house lemon curd and lingonberry jam the overall effect was pleasant, though at $9 one could have just as easily gotten far more interesting baked goods made with better quality ingredients at dozens of Portland bakeries, breakfast nooks, or even donut shops."},{"name":"Tijuana Flats","address":"991 E Semoran Blvd","city":"Casselberry","stars":"4","text":"First of all, I was there 30 mins before the closing time for a ToGo order, so do keep that in kind before reading the rest of the review.\\nI am a huge fan of Taco Tuesdays and tijuana flats.

With amazing vegan options that I regularly crave (Spicy Garlic Tofu with extra veggies, I'm looking at you!) and a variety of other tantalizing takes on chinese-takeout fare, and MORE, how can you say no?! \\n\\nI first ate here before I was vegan, and let me tell you, eat one of your go-to meals here and you'll have trouble eating it anywhere else. After my first try, I never looked at crab rangoon and sweet and sour sauce the same way ever again. Keep in mind though, you really can't go in here expecting the same exact taste as when you order american chinese food at a typical takeout place. Since they use different (and better) ingredients, the flavor profiles are not exactly the same - but I like Sun Tong Luck's versions so much more, plus I feel GOOD after i eat it. My stomach is happy, I have energy... I had never before felt HEALTHY after chowing down on chinese takeout.\\n\\nThey never charge to add extra veggies to your dish, and offer full and half size portions all day long - which means that at dinner time i can still get a smaller portion, and also protect my wallet, if i don't really need a giant meal.

But other than those few picky opinions, I had the Chicken Fried Chicken with White Pepper Gravy and sides of glazed carrots and whipped potatoes.

While many of the other bars had long lines of people waiting to PAY to get in, this place didn't. Around 1:00pm there was a light crowd and almost felt too good to be true. Sure, it wasn't an \\"Irish\\" bar, but who really cared? We wanted a place to meet up with all of our friends and that also wasn't trying to break the bank with $20 or even $30.00 cover charges. So here we are...\\n\\nAtmosphere/Appearance: This place reminded me of like, being on an old pirate ship. You know, because I used to be a pirate back in the day. It's hard to explain. Lol. The type of woods used, the decorations and everything inside made me feel like I was at sea or at least eating on a pier. I enjoyed it. The restaurant is broken up into several different sections. Right when you walk in is the main bar and the host stand, the busiest of the sections. If you made your way to the right you'd venture into another small dining area and then to the gift shop. Upstairs was MORE dining that I never got to check out. Back to the entrance, if you had gone left you circle around the bar and it opens up into what almost felt like a private dining area. There were about 12 tables back here, several of them HUGE round ones where you could easily seat 10. This is where we ate after hanging out in the bar for a couple of hours. Pretty loud atmosphere, which is to be expected on a Boston St. Patrick's Day, but when you went back into the private dining area there was a night and day difference. It got much quieter and we had an individual server take care of us.\\n\\nService: Shane was cool. I could tell that he was maybe tired or frustrated from how busy things were that day. He still did his job, got us everything that we needed, but lacked enthusiasm and a smile. I still tip my hat to him for keeping his cool while serving multiple huge parties among his other tables.\\n\\nFood: Since I've been watching what I eat fairly closely I have to shy away from fried foods and items that are heavy in carbohydrates. That literally eliminates maybe 72% of all items at almost any restaurant. Lol. Complimentary warm cornbread is served at the beginning with a bit of butter. (It was placed right in front of me, I couldn't be disrespectful by NOT eating it. Lol.) It was very good and certainly had that homemade taste to it. For my entree I landed on their house salad with grilled salmon. It was grand. The salad was crisp, salmon was soft, warm, flavorful and cooked very well, The balsamic dressing was delightful, but I used too much. So if they give you an entire 3 oz. cup, you probably won't need the whole thing.\\n\\nValue: It's downtown Boston, so the prices are a bit elevated. The salmon salad was around $25.45. You have to buy the salad for $7.50 then you add your choice of protein, salmon was $17.95. So not too bad, but you get what you pay for and it was worth it. The drinks of course were pricey. Most of their cocktails were in the $10.00-12.00 range, but I stuck with my vodka-seltzer for $6.50.\\n\\nIn conclusion, The Union Oyster House was a great way to start off our Saturday. It was also a great way to end it because we came right back here at the end of the night for another drink aaannnddd because they still weren't charging to get in. Lol. Check this place out, you won't be disappointed."},{"name":"Mary Mac's Tea Room","address":"224 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"After visiting for dinner, I'm a little confused about why this place is so hyped up.

I had BBQ pork, which was okay, but not on par with others I've had in Atlanta. The meat tasted like it was just smothered in store-bought BBQ sauce as an afterthought. The mac & cheese was also disappointing - it was sort of chunky rather than creamy and lacked flavor. The portions were huge, so if you happen to like your food, you will get two meals out of it.

The pizza was good, a hint of parsley and rosemary (I bit more might have been even better), earthy flavor of the potato, tangy flavor from lemon and cherry tomato harmonized the whole pizza (if you order this pizza, make sure to ask them not to add extra salt, Feta cheese has plenty of salt), the pizza crust was very nice.\\n\\nUnfortunately they don't have a \\"Lunch Menu\\" so we needed to pay the regular dinner price, it will be better if they have some kind of lunch menu combos like other restaurants near by.

It took longer than usual...I think they forgot to ring it in immediately because it came out late and...wrong. There was no avocado or bacon.

Please take note that this experience is only on the Rheinlander side, not Gustav's. That is another story to be told later..... \\n\\nI prefer Rheinlander over Gustav's simply because of its ambiance, better deals for full portion dishes, and service seems to be better too. So far, going there with a steady group has not disappointed me. I go out of my way personally to make reservations in advance if possible. One time I could not do reservations but when my group arrived just as they opened on a Saturday, we were taken care of right away.  \\n\\nI enjoy the complimentary hot apple cider in the lobby during those cold winter storm days. Another plus for Rheinlander is the free cheese fondue. Gustav's makes you charge for this appetizer. Rheinlander provides it as a free staple and is more than happy to replenish when the bowl runs dry. I enjoy their early bird specials since the chicken schnitzel cordon bleu is one of my favorite dishes; plus I save a few bucks and use that towards a big mug of beer. Even the early bird dishes comes with loaves of bread and side dishes to keep you occupied until the main course arrives. I also like the fact I can get more vegetables when opting out of the red cabbage; sorry not a fan. \\n\\nI enjoy the music when appropriate and they do ask my group if they can play or not. I came here one time on my birthday a couple of years back and I managed to sneak in a reservation on a Friday the last second. We were seated promptly when we arrived and one of my friends told the waitresses it was my birthday. They provided a complimentary apple strudel with all the singing and pampering. The dessert was quite tasty! \\n\\nA forewarning in case coming here during the winter holidays. Reservations do fill up fast and can get quite busy. My best advice is simply arrive when they first open for dinner. You will get seated right away; even if your going with a group.

The issue is that \\"hot dog\\" is ingrained in the American vernacular, and I can not seem to get even my closest of vegan friends to use the term \\"non pig-centric or cow-esque dogs.\\" They'd rather say, \\"I'll have a hot dog, but vegan, soy, with no cheese, of course.\\" \\n\\nRight. That could not stay on your tongue if you tried. \\n\\nSo knowing that m'boys - Mark D and Kevin N mention some alternatives to the oink or the moo, I decided to try it. You know, not all meatless dogs are cut from the same cloth. In fact, some of them taste like they ARE cloth. \\n\\nIf you are going to go for the soy versions at Franks, you will enjoy. That said, the dogs themselves are fairly \\"blah\\" and not as richly seasoned as they could be. It's what you put on them that makes the experience. Franks does a great job on the caramelized onions, and a personal favorite - saurkraut. Now THERE is an underrated condiment. \\n\\nIf you are going to drop in late at night, beware that the menu takes a shaving, but you can still get vegan dogs as a substitute. \\n\\nBeers are plentiful, and they even have Lone Star and Miller in the can.

As soon as we sat down, the server wanted to take our drink order.  We were a group of four for dinner on a Friday night and were talking and taking our time looking over the menu.  Give us a few minutes to look at the menu, please!--which is exactly what we told him.  He was back in literally five minutes.  We ordered drinks, appetizers and mains.  We hadn't finished our drinks when the apps came, and then the mains came within 30 seconds of his removing our app dishes.  So far, nothing really out of line, except that we felt rushed.  But then as three of us were finished eating, they took away our three dishes while my wife was still eating!  This is totally inexcusable, amateurish service.  My wife felt more than rushed.  At least ask \\"May I take your plates?\\"  This is sadly common in America.  In Europe, they never take plates off the table until every diner is finished.  Look, I'm all American and like that servers here don't ignore us, but I wish we could find a happy medium here.\\n\\nFood:  First the good, then the bad.  The good is that the dishes seemed creative, and everything I saw waiters carrying by our table looked very pretty--really artfully plated.  Now the bad.  Okay, I get it that this is \\"fusion\\" cuisine.  I also acknowledge that this was my first visit, and I have now only sampled a couple of main items.  Being a little wary of Asian fusion, both my wife and I had simple curries: she had red, and I had green.  We've been to Thailand and had no expectations that Thai fusion in Atlanta would resemble true Thai from Thailand.  Despite these realistic expectations, we were disappointed to find that both of our curries were just WAY too sugary sweet and loaded with coconut milk. You'd never find anything like that in Thailand.  Maybe some people like their curries that way, but it just didn't appeal to us.  Again, I realize the menu is billed as fusion and not Thai or any other specific cuisine, and I know we took our chances in that respect.  I'm afraid we just did not enjoy the curries.  That said, the piece of fried chicken that one of my companions let me sample was good, though not stellar--I think there are much better places for fried chicken in Atlanta.\\n\\nI might actually be persuaded to give Poor Calvin's another try, because it's unfair to base my opinion of the place on basically one menu item and some amateurish service.  I'd like to try a few other things on the menu before I decide the place is just not for me.

I have managed, owned, run, and done real estate for restaurants for over twenty years. I understand a bad shift, a bad meal, and even an arrogant server, but I do not understand how a restaurant charging these prices can have such offensive and incompetent servers and management.\\n\\nThe series of disasters started on Mother's Day of this year. Granted, Mother's Day is a day that is bound for failure as many rookies navigate restaurants for the only time of year and inundate restaurants not properly trained or managed, Although it is tough to toss a mulligan at a restaurant charging $350 for two adults, two children and an infant to eat, nonetheless, I did. From the beginning, the entire experience was doomed to failure. The poorly trained service staff and the mediocre food was miserable. However, each guest on Mother's Day was \\"treated\\" to a $50 Gift Card to return. Instantly, my reaction was to toss it out- how desperate to have to give away this much to bribe people to return. However, I decided to give the restaurant another chance.\\n\\nPoor choice.\\n\\nSoup ($11.00 bisque) came out cold. Told server that although it was flavorful, the soup was cold. He took it (with an attitude) and returned ten minutes later with another bowl. Colder than the first one. Oh well, I thought, no soup for me tonight.\\n\\nNext course was Top Of Hub Chopped Salad. Menu listed lettuce, tomato, haricots verts, and cheese, Salad came out with little resemblance to description. Lacking some of the ingredients and adding scores of olives as the most prominent ingredient. After twenty minutes of no server involvement, it was clear I was stuck with a salad that I could not eat (being allergic to olives).\\n\\nAfter the server finally arrived, I decided that I would consider the two mistakes bad luck and press on with dessert and asked for the menu. Server rudely mentioned that we better make it quick since the kitchen was closing in fifteen minutes. To me, it hardly seems appropriate to mention kitchen closing time this far ahead of actual closing time. I reviewed menu and noticed that the salad description was as I had read it originally and decided it was too late to order dessert. Server arrived and smugly asked if we were having anything. I politely noted that the salad description lacked olives and I was not happy with that. Server said that I should have said something earlier (again, he was never present). To which I replied that I would like to speak with a manager.\\n\\nOf course, manager never arrived, and the check was presented by arrogant server nastily pointing out that the soup was comped. As the server looked on, my wife crossed out the tip line, totaled the check, adding nothing, and politely said good night. The server was incensed that he received no tip and was very vocal about it. This is outrageous for a server to comment on a tip.\\n\\nI asked for the manager and a young man no older than 22 arrived ten minutes later. I explained the horrors of not only the food, but the service, and the best he was able to say was that he comped the soup.\\n\\nLong story short, incompetent kitchen, incompetent service and most importantly incompetent management.\\n\\nHIGHLY not recommended."},{"name":"Jalisco's Restaurant and Bar","address":"6601 S Congress","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I\`ve been to this place three times and what can i said i could give five stars in lunch time nice welcome but Friday night it really sucks they have a lot of help but all the staff its just talking & talking Im not coming back"},{"name":"Am√©lie's French Bakery & Caf√©","address":"840 Marietta St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I loved this place.

I had to pick out at least a third of the lettuce as it was inedible.  Then our pizzas came.  I tried to pick up my first piece but could not because the dough was still raw. The he dough on the bottom was so thin in some places, that I could not even pick the pizza up and the toppings just fell back on to the place.

I thanked them.  2 short minutes later, they brought the pizza back to me and it was not remade, rather simply put back into the oven.  This would have been fine if there were not issues with the thickness of the dough in some places, and the artichokes!

My sister ordered mussels which was amazing and my friend ordered spaghetti which I couldn't believe had wonderful  look like slices of meatball/flat sausage throughout this delicious homemade spaghetti sauce.

I called the restaurant earlier that day, told them that the dinner will be a casual birthday celebration, and asked if they could use a chocolate pen to write happy birthday on the dessert plate, which is a very common practice for this kind of restaurant. I also reminded the restaurant not to mention this arrangement when we arrive at the restaurant because I want it to be a surprise for my friend.\\n\\nHowever, when I arrived and checked in with the host, she said \\"this is for a birthday celebration right?\\", which was very embarrassing to me. We also arrived early and would have to wait for the table. I asked the host if we could be seated at the bar and order some drinks. She simply replied \\"yes, sure\\" but there was no more seats at the bar. Then, we had to help ourselves and wait at another area near the entrance before the table is ready. Her ignorance and neglect give the impression that the restaurant doesn't welcome us at all. I almost wanted to leave for another place but didn't, with hopes that the experience would get better.\\n\\nUnfortunately, that wasn't the case.  Apparently, the host failed to notify the waitress about how this is a birthday celebration. Therefore, our desserts came without any birthday note. I rushed to the front and asked the host about it. He said the restaurant simply doesn't have a chocolate pen and therefore couldn't write happy birthday on it. He didn't apologize at all and left the host area right after, while his attitude was also very cold and insincere.\\n\\nWhen I returned to the table, I told the above situation to our waitress Stephanie. Although this wasn't her fault and she took good care of us at the table, she apologized several times and made us feel better. She offered to take the desserts off the bill but I didn't take the offer, because I never intent to complain and get complimentary food. Still, she took that off the bill, which I did appreciate and tipped accordingly.\\n\\nThe restaurant has such a convenient location and offers decent food. For my previous visits, I met the unfriendly and unhelpful younger female host already, but at that time, there was also another female host who isn't as young and was polite.

The branzino was beautifully plated, but there was nothing particularly exceptional or memorable about the taste. I'm always happy when I see duck on a menu, it's my favorite bird to consume. Alas, nothing special. It wasn't seasoned in any special manner, wasn't seared crispy, the rice on the side was just \\"eh\\".

A group of us cabbed it over from the hotel and waited to be seated. Once I saw the menu I was in awe, there were so many things I wanted to try! I ordered like 4 sides(mac and cheese, cabbage, creamed corn, cheese grits), an appetizer (crawfish)  and catfish. Can you say FULL!!!! I ordered dessert, but they were kind enough to let me cancel it. There was no way I could eat dessert.\\n\\nI loved the food so much, I made one more trip back before I left Atlanta. This time I got the fried seafood platter. The shrimp were very tasty, but I should have gone with the fried chicken since that's what I really wanted and I had seafood the first time I came. Nonetheless I enjoyed my food and this time saved room for my strawberry shortcake I had to cancel on my first visit. Each time I came I had enough food to take home for at least 2 more meals.

The waffle fries were very good as well and the portion was just perfect for the two of us, now the the Mac n cheese was a complete disappointment.

I will not be going on a second date, unless my other options fall through.  Why?  Well, the food just doesn't cut it for the price.  If I go to a cheap Mexican restaurant my standards are lower and I'm more easily impressed.  On the contrary, when I order a $29 plate of duck, it better be perfect.  Here's what I liked.  The service was nearly perfect.  Everyone from the hostesses to the waiters are beyond attentive and accommodating.  The interior is nice.  It does get a little loud, especially when live music plays.  The presentation of the food is very artistic.  However, the pimiento piquillo rellenos (stuffed peppers)...were nothing special.  Pretty much anything tastes great with ham and cheese, right?  The palta rellena de cangrejo (avocado stuffed crab) was bland and flavorless.  All four people at my table agreed on this.  The yucca rellena is tasty, but so are the previously frozen jalapeno poppers sold at Fred Meyer's.  That's literally what I was reminded of as I ate them.  As for our entrees, two people at my table ordered the duck \\"two ways\\".  The leg was tasty, but the breast was impossible to chew.  My boyfriend didn't eat his because of this.  My father stated his lamb entree was bland, other than the rice.  I had the squash soup and it was tasty but when I eat a $19 soup and I get about a cup of soup on my plate (plus rice), I expect to be wowed.  I've had much better soups elsewhere.  For dessert, we had the lucama/espresso semifreddo, the cannoli, and the peruvian cookies.  They were all pretty tasty.  The cookies are overwhelmingly sweet though.  My conclusion is that Andina needs to either bring their prices down or bring the quality of their tapas/entrees up.  I've had much better food for the same price, so I have little incentive to come back."},{"name":"Not Your Average Joe's","address":"4C Wayside Rd","city":"Burlington","stars":"3.5","text":"Ehh. \\n\\nWent on a date here recently.

There's a small room in which ticket holders wait to get in, more people wait in separate lines to buy tickets and food.  There's no organization here and it's too many people shoved into a tiny room with no movement.  After 25 minutes in line I ordered my food and tickets.  The cashier wasn't overly friendly.\\n\\nReceived my food after another 25 minutes.  I ordered a Greek pizza.  The crust was excellent.  The toppings were all tossed in the very middle and the sauce was only covering half the pizza.

They concept is great, but the couch cushion I sat on was sunk into the floor of the couch and I wondered if I might fall through.\\n\\nAlthough I didn't have a great experience in the theater, it's still a good value since they feature $3 movies.

I think the concept had potential but the execution fell short.  The draw is mostly hype but I guess it keeps with the theme of Portland in that it's weird.

There was one large party (about 12) seated near the windows.  We did order fairly promptly and were brought drinks.  We probably waited at least 35 minutes for food.  An older couple seated next to use waited over 20 minutes for a salad and the waitress had to come back over and ask them which salad they wanted.  The large tables food was brought out in 3 or 4 different groups.  By the time we got our food, the large table was finished eating and the waitress apologized for it taking so long.  The food we ordered was ok - definitely not with the attention to flavor that has been served other times.  I will agree that a table of 11 is large for a restaurant that seats 40-45, but it shouldn't freeze up your kitchen on a Saturday night and affect rest of the quality.  Will we go back?  Maybe.  But probably not very soon."},{"name":"King + Duke","address":"3060 Peachtree Rd NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"All hype, no \\"wow\\".\\n\\nMy boyfriend brought me here for a date, because K+D was on my short list of places to try. Upon entering the restaurant last Saturday night, there was certainly a buzz - the bar was full and lots of folks waiting for an empty table. Luckily we had a reservation and were sat immediately. \\n\\nWe were sat at the most awkward table ever. Imagine a long U-shaped bench, with 3 tiny table squeeze up next to it, and a single chair. So the two tables on the edges, the diners sat next to each other on the bench \\"corner\\" portion. But we were sat in the middle portion, which gave us the awkward pleasure of feeling like we were being stared at by the two other tables the entire evening. Also, the tables were crammed so close together, that they had to pull out the entire table for me to even get in to the bench area. Once I was locked in, there was no getting out for the rest of the meal. Maybe request this table for a first date if you think she might flee. There were MAYBE two inches between our table and each of our neighbors. This meant we also had the pleasure of hearing their entire conversations and them hearing ours. \\n\\nI thought that maybe, with it being so busy, this is the only table they had available. I saw two tables set for 4 open, and thought that perhaps they would eventually be filled. But they weren't. I hope that the owners seriously reconsider their seating arrangements or better yet, eat a meal in their own restaurant at one of these tiny tables when the two diners flanking your table are strangers. I can see how this table would be okay for a table of 6 but for 3 tables of 2, much to close for comfort.  For this reason alone, I won't return. I shouldn't feel uncomfortable when spending this much for dinner. Maybe it's what they are going for and if so, it's not for me. \\n\\nWe ordered an apple / bourbon cocktail that was good, and nice for the season. We also ordered a \\"bite\\" dish that was bacon, poached egg, and corncake. This was a great dish but unfortunately a little difficult to share. I was a little confused about the difference between their \\"bites\\" section and the \\"starters\\" section. Our portion was probably better for just one person. \\n\\nFor dinner, we ordered \\"The King\\". It should be noted that their menu online doesn't match what we had in the restaurant so menu items (and price) must change frequently. Online this item is listed at $80 and our menu at the restaurant had $87. I only remember because this price seems so shockingly ridiculous. But I couldn't convince myself to get anything else on the menu, which was really surprising.  After hearing about the various fish dishes, I definitely didn't want any fish \\"boy scout style\\", nor did I want the spicy monkfish dish. Pork roast and ratatouille aren't appealing to me. Pork chops and chicken sounded plain. Rabbit and duck could have worked but the accompaniments didn't sound great. \\n\\nSo we got the steak, and certainly the presentation was a showstopper. It arrived on a huge slab that was almost too big for the table. Both of us being steak lovers, we had no problem tackling the steak. But, we both didn't think the steak was all that great. We were given this speech about their smoking process but really couldn't taste it in the meat. The jus that was provided was a necessity to add some flavor to the meat. Also, the steak was quite fatty; both of us had a nice pile of fatty pieces on the plate leftover.\\n\\n The steak came with two humungous bones full of marrow. The marrow was actually overpowering-ly smokey. I only had a few bites. \\n\\nIt also came with a single (?!?) tiny salad, that was completely forgettable, and served WITH the steak. I'm not sure why they serve a single, small salad with an entree that is for two people. And why it was served with the steak... I don't know. Very confused on that one. \\n\\nOur server was nice but seemed somewhat overwhelmed or distracted throughout the meal. Probably because all of his tables were so close together that he never had the opportunity to \\"check in\\" with us - anytime we needed something he was right there. Having been a server myself, I know that would make me a little frantic. \\n\\nHaving heard such great things about K+D, I really wasn't impressed. The clientele is definitely \\"trendy buckhead couples\\" and that was a bit of a turn off for me too. The prices are really high for what you get. I definitely won't be back on my own accord, but if a friend wanted to come here, I'd make a pass at trying to convince them to go somewhere else."},{"name":"Andina Restaurant","address":"1314 NW Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"By far my most favorite restaurant in Portland.

Would it kill the staff to spread out a bit? These are mostly things responsible by management, not the waitresses. \\n\\nAs far as the waitresses, never had an unfriendly one. I've even had a couple, dare I say, great ones. One thing that has been a constant is the delay of the first drinks arrival. Come one now...get that first drink out, THEN give a chance to look at the menu. I'm a beer drinker, but even when I only order water, it's like I have a sign on that says, \\"Please ignore me.\\" A little more sense of service could be tolerated from the beginning. \\n\\nSunday I had one that got my drink order, it was still slow, but not way, way slow like in the past. After I told her I wasn't ordering food, and after she made sure a few other tables in her area were topped off, she joins another table and probably sits there for like 15-20 minutes. I understand that some waitresses want to sit down for a few and get to know patrons paying their tip, or visit with their regulars. But she was sitting directly behind me and these fellas were caressing her back, doing the whole 9 yrds that creep out women. She was either a trooper or just into it. I heard a question, \\"Did you ever drink that wine?\\" Answered, \\"Yeah I did, last week before work haha!\\" That sounds about right. l in all I was a bit creeped out, but mainly from the patrons. \\n\\nI went to Bone Daddy's with work friends last week. Holy moly, the ladies, service, and food is all more talented there by the thousands.\\n\\nI realize this isn't Glassdoor, but my advice to Management is that they need an overhaul."},{"name":"Home Slice Pizza","address":"1415 S Congress St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"How can you not LOVE the slice?

The last time I was there, besides the pakora there were only two dishes I could eat, neither of which were that great. There are so many good vegetarian Indian foods out there! And as (you guessed it) a vegetarian it hardly seems worth eating at Tikki Masala when there isn't much I can eat. Of the food that is there, I don't find any of it spicy enough, which is something I really desire in Indian food. If my nose isn't running, it's not spicy enough. \\n\\nI've often found that the service is kind of strange, too.

This pan-Asian restaurant's byline: \\"wok, grill and sushi\\" understates how huge its menu is - and there truly is something for everyone! The menu contains a variety of traditional and innovative sushi combinations, Japanese, Chinese, and Thai cuisines and even tacos. The location off Hammond Dr. is easy to miss although it's near the corner of Peachtree Dunwoody and Hammond and there is ample parking once you find the right lot.\\n\\nMy overall favorite dishes include the massaman curry (above): a huge portion with good spice and flavor; and the salt and pepper soft shell crab. Get the crab over the calamari - it's something different and it's better. The special sushi rolls we tried were also tasty. R Rice uses some unique sushi wrappers including soybean paper and cucumber, although I love the traditional seaweed wrappers personally. Several in our party tried the cocktails, which came in an array of rainbow colors and were determined to be on sweet end of the spectrum - good for those who enjoy fruity drinks. The fried green tea ice cream was a nice end to the meal - I'm a sucker for green tea ice cream so I knew this would not be a bad choice!

The doughnuts were light, airy, and at the same time chewy. The BEST doughnuts I have tasted in my Life. \\n\\nFast-forward to a month ago. I live in Southern Oregon, but blessed to have my Son and five grandchildren living in Portland.

The way we get the doughnuts is to get maybe 8-12 at a time on our way home (a 5-hour trip) and we m-a-y-b-e will eat one in the car. So we did on our first take home. And they were good but not great.  it was such a bummer. They tasted like day-old doughnuts from a grocery store. \\n\\nUgh!!  Sad as we were, we went back a second time with the same result!!

Are they doing a weird Candid Camera spin off and we'll get our first residual check any day now!?!  And by the way, we didn't like the ones they gave us.
