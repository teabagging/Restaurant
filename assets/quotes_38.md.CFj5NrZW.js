Shortly after my review posted, she e-mailed me and apologized for my experience and the hair in the salad. She stated that she appreciated my feedback, and hoped I'd give her restaurant another chance to make things right. She also offered her time, willingness to speak to me in person and mentioned that the chefs would be happy to make a vegetarian dish upon request, which is awesome. It was definitely one of the most appropriate and professional responses an owner could write.  \\n\\nThe second time around, I ordered a fish dish and a Cesar salad, both of which were incredible. And hairless. Once again, the sourdough rolls were hot and fresh and the service was wonderful. We had a large group that, even during the busy lunch hour, was seated promptly and served all at once. And just for the record, we weren't given special treatment because of me.

Whenever I see Creature Comforts Tropicalia available I know a restaurant is going to be good.\\n\\nSo why write all this about a fast casual restaurant?\\n\\nI was originally annoyed by a handbill that was placed on my car and managed to stick on my windshield. I eventually got over it and decided to give the spot a try. When I visited ended up meeting the owner former Jags QB, Nate Hybl. He is a super nice guy and has clearly put his heart and soul into the restaurant. When I told him about the hand bill he knew the exact tweet and let me know the lengths he had gone to get in touch. I guess it was fate I'd run into him at the restaurant.\\n\\nIt's tough when you are building a business and there is no doubt the advertising was done with the best of intentions.

This place does NOT serve sweet tea, but unlike Houston's, will provide you with a generous serving of simple syrup. We started with the white bean soup and the cheese puffs. It was a chilly and windy evening, so dipping the cheese puffs into the soup was great, perhaps my favorite part. It was warm and thus warmed the soul. That soup is excellent. For an entree, my sweetie chose the Steak and Frites, which was prepared well and a good hearty man pleaser. I chose the mushroom and guyre tart, which was tasty.

I visited early in the morning on a weekend and managed to beat the crowd. My friend and I were seated within 5-10 minutes of arriving. I ordered the biscuits & gravy, and my friend ordered the steak tacos. The server gave us some complimentary coffee cake as we waited for our meal (it was delicious). I'm being petty, but I was kind of upset that we got significantly smaller pieces compared to some of the other tables... But it was probably for the best, because the food we ordered was more than enough to fill me up. \\n\\nThe biscuits and gravy are just amazing. My friend who had tried them before warned me that they were \\"too sweet\\"? But I thought they were perfect. It's extremely heavy, so maybe split another dish with a friend. I was so happy to share the two dishes, because I think the biscuits and gravy would have totally overwhelmed me if I tried to finish it on my own. The steak tacos deserve their own praise and acted as a decent balance with the biscuits and gravy. Half the biscuits and gravy and one steak taco was enough to keep me full for half the day.\\n\\nOverall, a great experience! Probably one of my favorite brunch places in Atlanta.

It's offered at three heat levels; I got a large bowl of the XXX for less than eight bucks. It was a very thick chili -- basically chunks of sauce-coated meat. It came with saltines, white onions, and pickled jalapenos, and an optional cheese garnish. The meat was slightly dry, but not egregiously so. It was a pretty simple chili, with not much going on besides meat and chiles; that's a good thing. The XXX had a decent kick to it; you're definitely going to want a beer with this chili.\\n\\nSpeaking of beer, even though this place looks more like a grimy dive bar than a restaurant, drinks aren't really their thing. They do have a full bar with a bunch of margarita options, and a few other not-so-appetizing-looking mixed drinks on the menu. No beers on tap, though, and nothing more interesting than Shiner Bock in bottles.

For my 150th review, I'm so glad ill be writing about Canoe, this gem deserves 5- stars all the way around.\\nFood: \\nMarinated beet salad over goat cheese: An excellent to start the evening, the salad was presented similar to tuna tartare, the beets were ripened to perfection and had that cornerstone of crunch and smooth ripeness. The beets paired well with the goat cheese and the candied walnuts gave it a nice texture and sweet flavor with every bite.\\nLamb bolognese: Canoe has got game literally  and I give it  praise for their lamb, duck and rabbit dishes. The lamb bolognese though very simple in its presentation was filled with flavor and unlike its traditional form was lightly tossed in its sauce and served with orecchiette pasta and mint and top with freshly shaven Parmesan, this dish was surprisingly light in texture and high in flavor.\\nDuck N Beef burger:  This burger was served with a sunny side up egg, just the way I like my burgers, spinach pickled cabbage and cozied up with Canoe's homemade bun and served with a side of truffle fries. The pairing of a duck and beef burger topped with an egg makes this Hands down the BEST burger I have ever tasted. The BEST!\\nSlow Roasted Carolina Rabbit with Bacon Ravioli!!! Just like duck, rabbit can be either a very juicy and tender dish or a dry and chewy dish. I will say when I saw this dish on the menu, I got excited. Ever since my go to spot in Los Angeles, stopped serving rabbit, I've been at a loss for some good game. This fine dish is served boneless served with potato hash and a delectable candied garlic sauce over a bacon ravioli , which can individually stand on its own as a pasta dish. The rabbit was tender and moist and married well with the sauce and the bacon ravioli. \\n\\nDessert:\\nWe had the home made sorbet, the makers mark creme br√ªl√©e, the highly  acclaimed chocolate grotto with salted caramel pretzel dust and the popcorn ice cream sundae with house made Cracker Jack to name a few.  The popcorn sundae was definitely the standout dessert that surprised all of us.\\n\\nAmbiance:\\nGreat Job of carrying the canoe theme from the bordering river through the restaurant. Lighting and acoustics were perfect, design was beautiful and welcoming. The outdoor garden bordering the river is a great place for an after dinner stroll and/or drink.\\n\\nService:\\nWe drove in from Alpharetta and I swear Atlanta traffic is no joke! We completely missed our reservation and the GPS kept on updating us on how late we would be. Mid way through our journey, it was the unspoken rule not to talk as we were all fungry! The hostesses yep many of them were polite and displayed good ol southern hospitality. We were seated at the bar until our table was ready. Unfortunately the waiter at the bar was some what snooty and rude because we had moved a few chairs to be seated next to each other. He then rudely let me know that chair I was seated on, belonged to the Patron behind me who was seated in a booth. I knew where I got the chair from, duh. I politely asked the patron if I could use it, before the waiter decided to interject his rudeness before assessing the situation.This same waiter who was serving the empty bar didn't offer us a wine list or a menu either. He was just rude, and clearly having a bad day and was going to take it out on our group. Well lucky for us we got seated shortly with an amazing waiter, who did an excellent job of explaining all the dishes, and was attentive and added to the pleasure of our dinning experience and outweighed the bad day the other waiter was having."},{"name":"Bar Lolo","address":"2940 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"With new owners that have given this Alberta District spot a breath of life, Bar Lolo can make for a great spot to socialize over a curated collection of Spanish or Pacific NW wines coupled with traditional Spanish Tapas.

I literally told the chef not to throw me the food, but he shoot it to me anyway and landed in my eyes. Yes, in my eyes. Another note is that, the way the chef serve the food. I guess he was trying to demonstrate how quick he is with his tools, so he literally buried my wife's fork and knife with the fried rice. It was just simply rude. I have been to various type of Japanese restaurnat: uper scale, budget type, buffet, traditional... etc. I have never ever encountered such rude chef.\\n\\n2.

Our group was practically scraping the bottom of the dish. The poudin fries were OK.

I had the chicken spinach sun dried tomato sausage on pumpernickel with grilled onions, spicy peppers, spicy ketchup and spicy mustard. I like it SPICY! It was incredible! Very, very good. My boyfriend ordered the hot italian with sweet peppers, garlic aioli and the marinara meat sauce. This place knows its sauces! The marinara sauce was delish and the hot italian was really tasty.

We figured we'd come in with our food and drink order ready to go [we scoped out the menu ahead of time!] and be ready to order everything as soon as someone arrived at our table. \\n\\nHere's the key: get there as soon as the doors open! [Side note--we were told by the manager that if we sat down before 7pm, our meal was 20% off....well, the doors didn't open until 7. So that was a joke.] Anyways, we were there as soon as the doors opened and and were greeted pretty quickly once we sat down. We went ahead and ordered our first round of drinks and both of our food orders immediately, and they came out pretty quickly. I can see how if you get there later, the service slows down. Once the show starts, they try to stay out of the way and not be distracting by constantly moving around so I can understand how the service halts at that point. So my tip is to just get there early.\\n\\nWe ordered a cheese board and the shrimp and grits. The cheese board was SO good [smoked gouda FTW] and it had some great side compliments like stone ground mustard, a sweet jam, and honey. It is a very small portion of each cheese, though. The shrimp and grits was ok, it was nothing to praise. It lacked in flavor a bit. \\n\\nOh, and be ready to pay up because this is a pricey venue. The food is expensive and the portions aren't necessarily generous, same for the alcohol.

We hadn't made dinner plans ahead of time as we'd just decided to wing it. We later discovered that on the way to our hotel, both she and I had noticed a particular restaurant on the way, though she was the one that remembered enough of the restaurant name for me to be able to look it up and find it. It also turned out that the restaurant, Rustic Kitchen, was right next door, almost adjacent, to the hotel we were staying at, so that was very convenient, and a perusal of the menu satisfied us both. We were going to be joined by a new friend for dinner, so I called the restaurant at about 4:30pm, and I made a reservation for 6pm.\\n\\nWe walked across the covered valet area to the restaurant and discovered a rather circuitous route to the hostess desk. The main entrance of the restaurant was actually off the street, so we'd really gone in through the side door. There were signs directing us through part of the restaurant to get to the hostess desk, and when we checked in, we discovered our dinner companion had already arrived and had been given a table, though she had made a visit to the ladies room, so we were led to the table as well, where she joined us shortly thereafter.\\n\\nWe perused the menu and there were a number of items that sounded really good, but all of that went out the door for me at least when the server came up and told us about the daily specials. I ended up ordering off the daily specials choices. The special soup for the evening was Boston clam chowder with smoked pancetta. Well, I was in Boston - why not some Boston clam chowder, and the addition of the pancetta sounded even better. All three of us ended up starting with the chowder. I then ordered the swordfish with lobster mashed potatoes and broccolini while my companions each ordered an entree salad.\\n\\nBread was also brought to our table, and it was accompanied by some kind of hummus as a dip (which was delicious) as well as Italian olives, which I loved.\\n\\nWe chatted a bit, and then our chowder arrived.

I love having clam chowder that actually has clams as a main ingredient and not simply as an afterthought. It also wasn't very heavy on potatoes, which I like. I like potato chowder too, but I don't like it when potato chowder masquerades as clam chowder.\\n\\nAfter enjoying our chowder, we had more time for good conversation before our entrees arrive. This time, I decided to spare my dinner companions the inconvenience of photographing their food, but they both enjoyed their salads very much. I also really enjoyed my swordfish. It had a nice texture and flavor and was very moist and tender and flavorful. The mashed potatoes were good, though I didn't finish them because the portion size was pretty generous, and I loved having the broccolini, which I'm partial to anyway, but again, it was a generous portion of vegetable on the dish.\\n\\nWith my dinner, I had also decided to enjoy an adult beverage called \\"Tastes like summer\\". I can't tell you what it tasted like in comparison to other drinks, but I can tell you that it was pretty yummy.\\n\\nIt wasn't particularly crowded when we had arrived, but that was probably earlier than most people normally have dinner. As our evening progressed, the dining room did get full.\\n\\nWe didn't end up having dessert at the restaurant partly because we were already full but mostly because we were headed to a show and needed to leave at a certain time.\\n\\nOverall, we had a terrific meal, and the room was very nice and had great atmosphere, and our server was very good as well. He was attentive and available when we needed something, but he wasn't obtrusive as to interrupt our conversation. If I have the opportunity, I'd certainly go back, and I'd definitely recommend it to others.\\n\\nParking can be a bit tricky in that part of town since there's not much parking available, but there's a lot that serves both the nearby Radisson Hotel as well as Rustic Kitchen."},{"name":"Umi","address":"3050 Peachtree Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"When it comes to sushi in Atlanta, this is where I go.

It's time for dins and something different. \\n\\nMerguez sits in an odd, little deserted plaza with a lot of unused storefront. There's a outdoor seating area that's oddly ornate and majestic next to this humble eatery. You order at the counter and can choose from some appetizers, sandwiches, tagines and more. I go with the chicken bastilla and kefta tagine. The kitchen takes a bit of time but it's totally worth the wait! My tagine consists of meatballs (beef/lamb?) immersed in a dark, crimson and spiced tomato based sauce. Two eggs are baked on top and it's a wonderfully hearty bite. The chicken bastilla is a hexagonal pastry of phyllo dough stuffed with chicken, nuts and drizzled with some sort of syrup-honey. Wow, wow, wow, I haven't had chicken bastilla in a while and this version was great.\\n\\nService at Merguez is family-like and friendly, A+ there and with the great portion sizes and prices, you really can't go wrong here.

I'll start by saying that my wife and I have only ever dined here for dim sum, so I can't comment on their menu (aside from the fact that it looks really good and extensive).\\n\\nOverall, the dim sum at Royal China is quite good. It's not as good or refined as the dim sum my wife grew up on, but we both love almost everything they serve. On a Saturday or Sunday, this place gets packed. Luckily, they do a wonderful job at bringing the carts around to every table, and also in keeping the carts stocked with fresh and (importantly) warm items. Even during peak hours, carts pass by our table every 5 or so minutes. They also have some carts that solely deliver soup, congee, and one with a skillet to fry up some items for you right on the spot.\\n\\nSo far, nearly everything we've had at Royal China has been quite good, and among the best dim sum we've had outside of Toronto. Their dim sum selection is also quite extensive, serving up dozens of different items from which to choose. The shrimp dumplings (har gow), pork dumplings (shumai), rice noodle rolls (cheong fun) are all as good as you're likely to find in the area. My favorite dish has always been the turnip cakes, which are made even better here by the fact that they fry it up for you on the spot. This way, it comes out piping hot, with a wonderful crust. They also serve up a custard-filled pineapple bun that has supplanted egg tarts for my favorite sweet item to finish the meal. I couldn't possibly list out everything we've had here, but needless to say, it's pretty much all been great.\\n\\nThe only misstep we've had here is their congee, which is mediocre at best. It's not particularly bad, but it's also not particularly good either. We tried it once, but now know just to avoid it here.\\n\\nOverall, my wife and I both love the dim sum at Royal China. Of all the dum sum we've had in the area, Royal China is the best we've eaten (so far at least -- we haven't been to all local dim sum places yet).

This was my first visit to City Winery and we were not in the main area but in a nook on the bottom floor adjacent to the larger area.  \\n\\nThe only good thing about the nook we were in is the decor.  It's a great-looking space with dark woods and lots of shiny liquor bottles. It's also a very intimate space; it's more suitable for a date (not a first date though!) than it is for trivia.  The tables are tall, circular and tiny; my friends and I were (all FIVE of us) were squeezed around our table like toys stuffed in a box; it was very uncomfortable. \\n\\nThe negatives on this experience are around the food, drinks and service.  I ordered the flatbread special which was buffalo chicken.  The bread was really pale, as if it was cooked just enough to make it not be dough; it wasn't a good look.  There were only a few crumbles of chicken and overall it was a pretty naked piece of flatbread; it tasted OK - not good but not bad, and definitely not worth the $16 price point. One of my friends ordered the mushroom flatbread and his didn't look any better than mine except it had more cheese.  \\n\\nMy friend ordered the truffle fries which they make by cutting up one large potato into 5-6 long chunks, frying the long chunks and then sprinkling them with cheese.  I love fried potatoes but these didn't look that appetizing.  And no one wants to eat fries with a knife and fork. \\n\\nI ordered 2 cocktails (Bernheim Berry and CW Daquiri), and both had too much juice; but of the 2, I preferred the Bernheim Berry because I'm a sucker for blood orange anything.  Not worth the $10-11 price point; I'd rather have the tiny coupe glass that's mostly liquor than a tall cocktail glass that's mostly juice.  (Please google \\"coupe\\"; I did.)  \\n\\nAs for the service, in the beginning our server was very nice and somewhat attentive because very few people were there.  However, once people arrived; the ONE guy servicing about 24 people couldn't handle everyone, and it was terrible. What made it worse were the staff who came to the area to hang out with our server and not help him out; and he seemed totally okay with that.  *eye roll*    \\n\\nI was also annoyed that there were drink specials that our server didn't mention when there were only 2 of us at our table.  We probably would have spent the same amount of money, but we likely would have enjoyed ourselves more.  He just showed that he only cared about his tip and not about our experience there.  \\n\\nOverall, this experience was a loss, and I wouldn't visit City Winery again."},{"name":"Goldbergs Fine Foods","address":"6000 N Terminal Pkwy","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2","text":"Really????

I have had a few bad experiences at the Waterford Lakes Buffalo Wild Wings and it kind of left a bad taste in my mouth, but I will say that after going to this new UCF Buffalo Wild Wings on University...I think I'm realizing that when it comes to chain restaurants, a unique atmosphere and/or location can really make a huge difference. \\n\\nFirst off, this BWW is conveniently located off of University Blvd., literally down the street from UCF. This in and of itself basically means that the restaurant has that college sports bar feel--young, female servers wearing black & gold jerseys, giant flat screen projector screens in addition to flat screen TVs, and an early-20s clientele. If this atmosphere excites you, read on. If not, you might want to try out another BWW. \\n\\nAs far as the food goes--it's pretty much the standard Buffalo Wild Wings menu and fare. In my opinion, their prices are on the high side for what they offer (wings, burgers, beer, nachos). But at the same time, when I was at this particular location, our wings were fresh and especially delicious. And the Amstel Light wasn't bad either. \\n\\nPerhaps the best thing about the location of this Buffalo Wild Wings is the sheer size of the place. It's basically one HUGE open room--tons of tables, there's even a room off to the side with even more seating. Definitely a plus considering UCF tends to be accepting more students every day, and also a plus for when it comes to huge sporting events. \\n\\nOverall, I think I've changed my opinion about Buffalo Wild Wings.

As is, I am wavering between 3 and 4 stars - I wish I could give 5, but tonight the service was definitely a 1-2... waiting 15 minutes after the waitress greeted us to have my first beer order taken is not cool and that was only the beginning of an evening of pain and excuses (as we were juggled between two waitresses).  Maybe I will be able to bump it up a star once the collegecritters are gone for the summer.\\n\\nI'm not a 5x200-plate regular (it will make sense after you've been there), but in recent months I have been in roughly once a week.  There is so much to love about it, but the quality of service is extremely random and there is way too much yofratbro vibe going in the Austin location -  it's more of a rowdy college location than a cool mellow bar for the nurturing an appreciation of rare and special malts (the Fort Worth location is so much cooler, but whatchagonnado).  And naturally, the outside seating is never usable thanks to the chemical warfare being waged by the herds of nicotine addicts.  Inside, there are way too many televisions - that seems to be a problem everywhere in Austin.\\n\\nI love love love the beer club - ok, it's a gimmick, but I am got.  You buy into the \\"UFO Club,\\" and from then on you can log into a kiosk, scan the beers you have tried before and select new beers to select - it will print out little barcodes to give your waitress, and the beers you try will be tracked at the kiosk and on the web site.  The more unique beers you try over time, the more valuable prizes and recognition you receive.  I am such a sucker for leveling up.\\n\\nThere is a really good cheese and sausage sampler plate with hot mustard and an olive tapenade.  The cheese soup is a nice, spicy and smokey flavor and is served in a sourdough bread bowl.  I might prefer the lower carb option of a bowl bowl, but this is pretty tasty.  My usual date has really enjoyed here burger there, except that she was not asked how she would like it cooked.\\n\\nThe place is always busy - we can almost never get a seat without waiting 10-30 minutes unless the back/side room is open.  I do not understand why it almost never is open.\\n\\nLike I said before, the biggest problem here besides the hordes of heybrojocks among the clientele is the randomness of the service - the waitresses (no men taking orders?  Argh, I thought Austin was better than the Hooters model) are almost always friendly and upbeat, but more often than not are also pretty flakey.  Be polite, firm, and patient (especially patient), and you will eventually get good beer and food.  And sometimes they pour the beer into glasses for us, sometimes they ask, and sometimes they don't and don't ask - consistency of experience is not their strong suit.\\n\\nReading all this, you probably ask why I go back.  I guess I am particularly down on them because of the service and seating issues recently - I really do like the idea of most of what they do, it is just the implementation that falls way short.  Most times I can ignore what I don't like and enjoy the variety of beers, the food, and the friendly service but sometimes all the other stuff is just too much of a pain in the ass.\\n\\nIf the parking were easier downtown at Ginger Man, I would probably frequent there instead, but for now I'm grinding beer achievements at the Saucer.

Southern Sweets Bakery bakes some of the greatest cakes Atlanta has ever seen.  Cakes aren't this business's only specialty, though, as they have a pretty decent lunch menu too.  Southern Sweets' cafe is open every day from 11am to 5pm.\\n\\nSouthern Sweets is located very close to Your Dekalb Farmers Market, off Laredo Drive.  The cafe is small and casual.  It's decorated much like someone's house with old-school black and white checkerboard tile flooring and homely artwork and decor on the walls.  Seating is limited to a handful of small black wrought-iron cafe-style tables and chairs (the kind you typically find outdoors).  The cakes and desserts are on display inside glass cases towards the back of the space.  Behind the register is a giant, beautifully painted Southern Sweets curtain.\\n\\nSouthern Sweets' lunch menu contains about 20 different sandwiches and wraps, a half dozen salads, and some soups.  Everything is homemade including the salad dressings.  Sandwiches and wraps are offered in a variety of breads including multigrain, marble rye, country white, Ciabatta, and spinach wrap.\\n\\nWhole sandwiches and salads will set you back about $9-10 each.  You can also get various combos (e.g. half sandwich + soup) for $9.20 each.  The sandwiches are regular size.\\n\\nThe bakery's most popular sandwich is the \\"Grown Up Grilled Cheese\\" sandwich.  These are $8 each and you get your choice of two cheeses: cheddar, fresh mozzarella, Swiss, Provolone, smoked Gouda, pepper jack, or white American.  You can also add fresh greens (lettuce) and tomatoes at no charge, plus grilled onion, homemade basil pesto, crispy bacon, and other meats at an additional cost.\\n\\nI really like the grilled cheese sandwich here and recommend getting smoked Gouda as one of the two cheeses (or the only cheese) you have prepared with your sandwich.  The sandwiches are served hot from the kitchen and each bite produces long stringy bites of melted cheese.  The Gouda has a unique sweet taste to it.  I also like to add lettuce and tomato for extra flavor.\\n\\nAs mentioned previously, the cakes at Southern Sweets are pretty dang good.  They always have a sample of some cake next to the register.  Be sure to try some!\\n\\nI've tried the following cakes:\\nCarrot spice cake\\nChocolate red velvet cake\\nCaramel cake\\nChunky apple spice pound cake\\n\\nOut of the few I've tried so far, my favorite is easily the caramel cake.  I'm not a huge fan of caramel, but the caramel cake is just so smooth, creamy, and rich.  It's delicious.  My mouth waters just thinking about that fine, light brown caramel icing.\\n\\nThe other cakes are great as well.  Both the carrot spice cake and the chunky apple spice pound cake have, to me, larger-than-normal grates of carrots and apples.  This gives these respective cakes extra texture.  I also like how they have that extra spice to them.\\n\\nThe chocolate red velvet cake -- in fact, all the cakes really -- are moist and not too dense.  The cakes are prepared and baked well and it shows.  I look forward to returning and trying different cakes.  I also want to try some of their cookies.\\n\\nService is excellent.

I got the Kung Pao beef for $10.50, which was just ok.  I was pretty disappointed the dish only had beef, hot peppers and scallions.  Perhaps its more authentic that way but when the menu describes the different peppers, I guess I thought they meant bell peppers and not black pepper and hot peppers.  The dish was also very greasy.  Which I guess is common for them but it still made my dish a little gross.  And I was also honestly expecting more food.  I was pretty hungry and got a dinner entree so when I finished the entire dish easily, I was surprised their portions weren't larger.

Expensive to be sure, but most certainly far less than one would pay for a similar experience in Tokyo!  One hint would be to focus first on the specials, as these will have the freshest ingredients, and that means a lot because many are prepared with minimal cooking and flavorings, the freshness of the ingredients coming straight through at you.  This time, the tempura-style fried soft shell crab, and a maki-type dish made of three fishes (tuna, hamachi and ?) rolled up in a vegetable (I did not order it) were exceptionally fresh and tasty.

You can find this dish in a lot of authentic Chinese restaurants, but the mileage varies.  Royal China does a very good job of it, so if you are a fan of this dish, have a go at it here. To me, salted fish is one of those \\"acquired taste\\" Chinese ingredients that don't come naturally to most non-Asians.  If you were sitting at the next table, you might even be offended by the smell, if you are one with a sensitive nostril. Others in the same category might be pig's intestine, chicken feet, thousand year old eggs, stinky tofu, blood cake, etc.  If you just think of salted fish as a kind of cheese, albeit a strong smelling one, only added sparingly to enhance the flavor and taste of some dishes, then it becomes easier to understand.  The dish takes a while to steam, maybe 20 minutes, so be patient.  The minced pork is thin enough that it is flavorful, yet easy on the palate.  A generous amount of salted fish was added, yummy!  There is a nice oily residue from the steaming process that really enhances the dish and prevents it from drying out.  A sprinkling of cilantro and green onion complete the dish.  The dish sits on top of a stainless steel plate, a perfect crucible for it.

By far some of the best salsa you can find in the Boston area. \\nWent here yesterday for a friends birthday and we pretty much had the whole place to ourselves... which was perfect cuz we can be a loud and obnoxious group when we get our day drink on. AAAAAAANNYYWAYS.  I ordered a strawberry mango margarita that was fan-friggin-tastic. Nothing worse that a margarita you pay 10 bucks for that A. tastes like syrup and B. has no booze in it. This drink not only tastes delicious but also gives you that warm fuzzy margarita feeling after just one (or maybe I'm a lightweight all of the sudden).  The boy got a margarita on the rocks (times 3) that I had a few sips of that was also pretty good. Other friends had the Pina Colada which I also could have drank a few of. \\nSo the food? Was it the most earth shattering Mexican food I've ever had? No. Was it nice to find I can have a decent Mexican meal in Southie about 3 blocks from my place rather than getting on the T to La verdad or Border? Yes. We ordered the 3 taco combo and the Papo Taco with steak. The Papo Taco is this magical concoction in which they take a baked potato and smash it in with cheese, sour cream, steak and other delicious things. They serve it up in a little crock with rice and beans. I pretty much ignored the 3 taco combo and let Mark get after that while I dove in face first to the Papo Taco. The meat in the Papo Taco was a bit dry and I cant say much about the taco combo because I never tried it. Leftovers will have to suffice.  I was full after about 4 bites of the Papo Taco. Could have been the two enormous frozen drinks I consumed before the food came... could have also been the two baskets of tortilla chips we ate because the salsa is REALLY that good. \\nSo all in all, I will be back for some good solid warm weather day drinking, but to be honest... their drinks do outshine their food. Good service, friendly waitstaff and the atmosphere is cute and cozy. It was a perfect place for a Sunday afternoon birthday celebration in Southie."},{"name":"Dai Due","address":"2406 Manor Rd, Ste A","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Bought some kim chi and venison breakfast sausage there and started making that Dai Due breakfast at home.

It reminds me more of an old European Bar with several 100 types of beer. The beer is cold and they have special $2.75 per pint deal on most nights.

They say they have the largest selection of quality had-crafted beers form around the world.\\n\\nThey have a deal called the U.F.O Club and one you drink 200 different beers you will be immortalized in their ring of honor with a gold plate with your name on it on their wall. I know that would take be 10 years to accomplish so none of us signed up.\\n\\nNow for the food again my friend from Wisconsin loves Sheboygan brats which they had. He said they were the best in the USA. So I bit and ordered the cooked in beer brats on a bun with sauerkraut, mustard and diced red onion.  They were really good I was impressed. The brats came with fries, or German potato salad or just plain cold potato salad. I had the fries and he had the German potato salad, both were good.  Their menu has everything from pizza, burgers, wings, sandwiches, salads, Bratwurst and fish.\\n\\nThe place itself was great and the service was excellent.  The serves appear to be all college age girls wearing a logoed T-Shirt of various colors and Styles, Their skirts were reminiscent of school girl type, short. Very nice indeed.\\n\\nThey have both tables and booths and outdoor seating.  There seemed to be only 2 TVs above the bar in the whole place but not sure if there were some I could not see. So for football it may not have enough TV viewing for a large crowd. Update based on picture from Marshall it has at least 1 TV in the larger room I did not see.\\n\\nTheir location is found in what is now called in the triangle between Lamar and Guadalupe on 47th Street.

Not completely bad if you just go for a sangria and the fries with the works and you want to get the kids out of the house. The white sangria was delicious as were the fries but the doners were not, and the noise level with kids playing board games etc did not make for a nice, casual dinner out. The place is loud. Even without the kids the acoustics make the noise level of even just the partially occupied restaurant not conducive to dinner time conversation. The menu is confusing and the falafel doner was bland  - the bread was thin and flavorless. The doner is held together because it is tightly wrapped in a covering, otherwise it would fall apart in your hands. Best to go to any number of the traditional Middle Eastern spots in town for the real thing. The fact that this is a chain from LA makes sense and makes it even sillier to go here instead of say, Alladins on NE 33rd. Here in PDX the culinary field is so competitive. Watch the Spitz space.

There always seems to be a special that's a lot more interesting than most and sometimes there's free glassware.  \\n\\nThe only issue is that it's a little too popular, so finding a table can be challenge."},{"name":"OSAKA Japanese Sushi & Steak House","address":"14 Green St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3.5","text":"I went he with six adult and five kids and have hibachi.

I do have to give them props for the size of the bowl and the amount of  beef they serve in the chili.  There are no beans so this stuff is definitely a go for all meat lovers.

Despite the menus potential to be amazing (Country Pate, \\"Faux\\" Gras Terrine, pork rillettes, salmon rillettes. tartar) it is exactly what one would expect from a Buckhead Life restaurant - safe, boring and merely adequate.  The food certainly did not offend me, but it is not going to make me come back either.  The charcuterie appetizer with pork rillettes, chicken liver mousse, country pate, salami and prosciutto lacked flavor - how they managed to do that is beyond me.  The lamb sandwich I had also lacked flavor.  The only thing that reminded me that lamb was even on that sandwich was the texture - short of that, it could have been anything in between those two pieces of bread.  Other than that, the food was \\"great!\\"  In short, the food was about as exciting and interesting as watching a game of checkers between two mimes.    \\n\\nUltimately, the fact that Bistro Niko was \\"flat\\" should not have surprised me because, time and time again, every visit to a Buckhead Life restaurant yields more or less the same story - jejune food that is never outstanding nor offensive, \\"themed\\" environment, adequate service and prices that normally won't break the bank (albeit expensive for what you get).  I guess that is why the restaurant group is successful, it refuses to take chances.  Bistro Niko is absolutely no exception to this rule.\\n\\nOther than the food, I would be remiss if I did not give two quick words on parking before concluding - absolute nightmare.  The valet situation at this restaurant is about as organized as a goat rodeo.  You will wait in utter confusion both to bring your car in and to leave.  The valet seems to service several different businesses and is completely understaffed.  If you are in a rush at lunch, good luck.        \\n\\nAlthough I have gone way to much in depth on a restaurant that has none, I have a few final remarks to round out this review - If you are in Buckhead and on an expense account, go for it, you won't be wowed or disappointed, you will just be. If you are paying for the meal yourself and really want exciting and flavorful food, save your money for somewhere else or just give it to me.  If you are looking for safe food sold at relatively decent prices in a sterile environment, this may be the place for you.  It is not for me."},{"name":"Shiki","address":"9 Babcock St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3.5","text":"Shiki people moved from Harvard sq. to Coolidge corner.

He indicated it was tenderloin, so it must have been really good!\\n\\nThey have both a covered and uncovered patio outside, depending on the weather.  One thing about the patio I didn't like was eating with dogs.  While there wasn't one next to me, there was a dog constantly barking two tables away.

The main bar goes the entire length of the establishment with beautiful mosaic tile on the floor in front of it. There are cozy little areas through out and there are even 2 working (gas I assume) fireplaces to ad to your comfort. There is even a community center bar rail (I guess that's what you call it) where you can grab one of the comfortable padded bar stools, pull up and sip a perfectly poured pint, nibble on some food and watch the band or the giant High-Def projection TV. Speaking of TVs, there are several HD Flat screens throughout the place, not an over whelming amount but certainly enough to catch every moment of the European soccer games and the Red Sox.  Did I mention this place is BIG!!!\\n\\nAfter visiting several times now I have tried many items on the authentic Irish menu. Appetizers, the muscles are prepared like I have never had before. Served on a sizzling skillet, some sea salt and fresh lemon made us order 2 more rounds!

Also a favorite is the Gaelic Steak and the Beef Stew.

The average price for a pint is $5 which beats out most of the over priced bars in Boston. I will say the Bartenders full of brew suggestions certainly know how to smile, give great customer service and pour a PERFECT pint of Guinness! Not many bars can boast this, these bartenders have done their homework. \\n\\nOverall the staff is friendly, attentive and have a solid knowledge of the menu.

Observations:\\n\\n1)  Taste.   History is replete with two-item combinations that transcend thought, feeling, and perhaps humanity itself.  I think of Anthony and Cleopatra,  Shakespeare and the person who REALLY wrote his works,  Bert and Ernie.  You, know, the big ones.  Given that standard, a grilled cheese sandwich should be positioned to embrace its destiny:  Cheese, nature's greatest food, combined with its second-greatest platform (bread, only slightly behind your bare hand).\\n\\nWith that historical perspective ,and perhaps education, I beg the question that this cart has prompted: How do you screw this up?  The cheese tasted greasier than Steve Buschemi's comb, and the bread that had as much flavor as the Osmond Family Christmas Special, circa 1978.  It was reminiscent of an EZ Bake Oven creation, only not as warm and coming from a smaller (and probably less hygienic)  place.\\n\\n2.  Service.  The woman who handed me this shame sandwich was not happy to be there, and even less enthused about having to actually do something while there.  I felt more welcomed by the Viking Soul Food cart, and it was closed.  Unless you are a Carny, you should show some level of enthusiasm when you are luring people to a parking lot to eat out of your trailer.  At least carnival workers know that once you finish your corndog you leave said parking lot and go back to the Tilt-a-Whirl.  My only ride was the emotional roller coaster of shame, disappointment, and dread at the ticking grease bomb working its way to my colon's sense of foreboding.\\n\\n3. The name. The only thing that makes sense. Imagine the scenarios:   \\n        Q:  \\"What cart did you hate the most?\\"\\n        A:    \\"No Name!\\"\\n\\n        Q  \\"Which cart befouled history's greatest creation?\\"     \\n        A:   \\"No Name\\"\\n\\nAs we learned in \\"A Horse With No Name\\":\\n\\n            The ocean is a desert, with its life underground, \\n            And a perfect disguise above. \\n            Under the cities lies a heart made of ground, \\n            But the humans will give no love. \\n\\nI hope there is some life under this cart, because there wasn't above, and I certainly got no love (unintended rhyming).\\n\\nIn sum, (which is what you should politely say after a long-winded rant):\\n\\nInvest 16 cents buying their ingredients, and make the thing yourself. You will ride the wave of success with your own created sandwich, or fail horribly and won't have to try and remember the name of this place."},{"name":"Passport Sips & Tapas","address":"59 Washington St","city":"Weymouth","stars":"4","text":"Best Mac & cheese, hands down!

Though I hear good things. Where the lacking comes in is within it's staff. Not necessarily the waitstaff or even the restaurant management but within the music Booker. To me to run any business that is successful you need a full team that will represent your brand or name well.\\nMatt however does not. His lack of professionalism with the bands he books is appalling. My husband is part of a very well known group here in town and played a gig a month or so back. Have they been paid for their work? (And yes this IS a career for these individuals) They were given partial payment of the agreed upon amount weeks late (payment in full was to be that evening) And now after weeks and weeks of my husband talking to Matt, he agreed to meet up with remaining payment. Note to promoters and booking agents a RED BULL gift card that is not already part of the bands contract is NOT equivalent to payment. Which is what he tried to offer in place of the remaining compensation. I'm not sure what experience other performers have  had,  but if this is the way they conduct business with individuals hired to heighten their atmosphere and get patrons in. Matt you are mistaken and should be fired. If the owners care about the way their business is  portrayed they would remove him from his position and fill it with an individual that actually cares for the business they represent, as well as the people who help make it a place people want to go.

In fact, I was not just expecting it to be great; I inherently knew it would be. On paper, it has everything going for it with the fantastic bar setup, vintage prints on the wall, live jazz, and extensive exciting cocktails of yesteryear menu. Unfortunately, this is where First Printer stops succeeding. In the past month or two I have been here twice, and will not be returning for a third.\\n\\nFirst visit:\\n\\nEarly on a Friday night some six weeks ago, a group of friends and I were walking down Dunster St. and happened to spot FP. Originally heading for another bar, we decided to stop in here to check it out. None of us had heard of the place and figured it had just opened. Once inside we were all surprised that it had been open since the summer. We were sat at a booth toward the back on our right when the waiter came by asking us what we would like to eat, only to tell us that the kitchen was closing and we probably would not be able to put in any orders. Fine. We were there for drinks anyways. After informing him of this, he instructed us that we could order our drinks at the bar and bring them back to our table. What is the point of having a waiter in that case?\\n\\nUnfazed, I head to the bar to grab a drink menu and spot a drink special for some sort of beer and some sort of bourbon combination that I do not recall. Why is it that I do not remember? Well, before I had a chance to order it, I asked the bartender about the drink special and he immediately ripped the menu out of my hands and said, \\"That's an old menu, we don't have that special anymore\\", and walked away. Yup. He literally, in an over-exaggerated fashion, yanked the menu from my hands and then left me standing there. Fortunately I did not cry (only on the inside). The bar was not busy and he did not leave to go serve other customers, he just straight up walked away to go stand on the other side of the bar. At the time I was laughing about it because it was such a ridiculous thing to do, but who does that? My friends who had already ordered at this point received and finished their drinks, and we promptly left to quench our thirst elsewhere.\\n\\nSecond visit:\\n\\nThis previous weekend the same group of friends and I, along with a few others, decided to try FP again and go earlier for dinner. We made reservations for 8 PM on a Friday night and after walking in it was clear that we did not need them. Quite foreboding, but at this point I was just crossing my fingers that I could get a drink here.\\n\\nOnce again we were sat in the back at a booth and we were given our menus. A waitress brought our waters over and managed to completely forgo eye contact with everyone but the floor and did not speak a word nor even remotely smile. I would have settled for a smirk and a nod. \\n\\nFor over 15 minutes we sat there waiting to put our drink orders in. Our waiter arrived and I ordered the Boulevardier. Though the menu stated it would come with Four Roses bourbon, I clearly got a drink that had a heavily peated Islay scotch instead. Not one to waste whisk[e]y, I did not say anything, and it was at least decent. I call it a happy mistake. My friend who ordered a bottled beer was brought the beer and a glass, and before serving it to him, the waiter tipped the bottle completely vertically over the glass creating a violent pour leaving the contents of said glass mostly head. You could the disappointment slowly engulf his face. It took over 10 minutes before the foam died down until the beer was flat, albeit drinkable. Everyone else was happy with their drinks.\\n\\nAfter putting our food orders in, four of the five dishes came out together and I was left sitting there waiting for my meal for over 10 minutes after everyone else. By the time my bison burger (YEAHHHHH) came out everyone was half done with their meal. My burger was both overcooked and nearing room temperature. It was clear to me by the temperature of the meat and the sogginess of the bun that it had been sitting around for about, oh say, 10 minutes. What the hell? The burger itself would have been great if it were not for these facts. Others ordered the fried chicken and waffles, scallops, and flatbreads and all reported that they were ranging from mildly content to content. At this point we were all just ready to leave and move on with our lives.\\n\\nThen the bill came. Everything was in order save for me being overcharged by $1 for my meal. It's not the money, its the principle. This on top of everything else just sealed the deal for me. \\n\\nBottom line / TL;DR:\\n\\nLook, First Printer. I am your target demographic. Mid to late twenties, likes swankypanky places that dish out bourbon cocktails that my great grandfather drank, and has disposable income. After coming here twice you have completely alienated myself and friends who really wanted to like this place and make it a regular haunt.

The others had wursts and burgers, which all looked good.  My fries were kinda bland and meh.  They had chilli under them and looked like the store bought fries and a bunch of jalape√±os on top.  I mean alot!  The fries were like eating a bunch of cardboard slivers covered in cold cheese and barely there chilli.\\n\\nThe beer:  That was good, which is why I went there in the first place.  I had an Abita Turbo Dog, which was poured out to a glass by the waitress in front of me.  I guess to ensure I get what I ordered?

I finished with a Racer 5 for that extra special touch.  \\n\\nThesse beers got pricey, probably cuz I wazs there for trivia night instead of special beer night.

We had a pleasant experience and considering they've only recently opened and will continue to work out kinks, they did a pretty good job on all fronts. \\n\\nWe were on a time crunch with only 45 minutes to eat and let our waiter know when we arrived. There was decent traffic at the restaurant this night but our waiter was still very attentive and very friendly/helpful. The ambiance is hip and welcoming. We ate upstairs with the high tables where the large windows and nice lighting create a pleasant environment. The outdoor patio will probably be packed on Friday nights as the weather warms up. In the end, we had an excellent dining experience and made it out on time.\\n\\nThe beers are giant specialty beers so the $15 price tag doesn't seem so bad, but we'll be looking forward to some smaller options as they bring in more booze. We tried one specialty cocktail which was quite good. \\n\\nWe tried a variety of different dishes. This place is great for bringing a group and sharing food as many of the plates in the $10 range are smaller portion meant to be shared. It's not quite tapas but you would probably still be hungry if you only ordered one of these plates. On the other hand, the $20 chicken pot pie (which comes in an attractive cast-iron skillet -they do a different dinner pie of the day like this) was very tasty and would be too much for just one person (we split it 3 ways). Nothing was bad although I wasn't a huge fan of the duck liver salad (but I think that may be more because I remembered I don't love liver). The beef gyro was decent, the vegan wrap was surprisingly tasty, and ragu turnips were also a surprise but very delicious. One dish came with some pickled stems from some green (collards or swiss chard I believe?) that were really nice, and again a bit unusual.The menu is quite eclectic (at times seemingly all over the place) and features local, ethical meat, and in-season produce which is cool. \\n\\nThe place is a little bit off the main road in a somewhat strange location (no other commercial businesses around it) but the facility itself is beautiful and it's worth trying out.

To my surprise I saw that there is a new place here now, with a similarly dosa-centric, South Indian menu and same color scheme but that's really where the similarity ended.\\n\\nThere was a staff of a few friendly people, which hadn't been my experience before, and also there were more customers coming in. Both good signs. I had a look at the buffet which was good standard authentic Indian dishes with parathas, salad and pickle/chutneys, served with a dosa, but I wanted to see the new menu so had a seat at a comfortable booth and had a look.\\n\\nEverything is pure vegetarian, which is wonderful as it means the whole menu is up for choosing. My eyes alighted first on the Pesarattu with upma and it ended up being what I ordered after perusing the various apps, entrees and dosas. You hardy ever find pesarattu on a menu here and I love them so it was a winner.\\n\\nThere was a bit of a wait for the dish to cook, so I was kindly offered some chai, which was lovely, served in a steel cup on a little tray. The chai was nice and thick, and had black cardamom in it which is unusual, but I love any kind of cardamom. The atmosphere was pleasant enough to wait in, with Indian music at reasonable volume and artwork and framed photographs of India around the walls. I don't know if this larger space looked the same before, or not - at the last place I always sat near the door.\\n\\nI didn't realize how enormous the pesarattu would be, good thing I came in very hungry! It was the size of an aircraft carrier and came complete with chutneys and sambar. Inside, a mound of upma (I think it was rice upma?) with dal and vegetables and lots of diced red onion. I tackled it, and in the end it defeated me - my stomach was full while there was still some on the plate. The pesarattu itself was a little overdone and the upma was a little salty, but overall I give this dish a thumbs-up. They have really good coconut chutney, fyi. The rest of the chai from earlier was a perfect finish before attempting to waddle out of the restaurant.\\n\\nAnyone who reads my reviews knows I'm a Ritu Ki Rasoi devotee, so my immediate impression of this restaurant is that now Camberville residents will have their own local version - with some differences. The atmosphere here is more upscale, with waiter service and water in goblet glasses, and the everyday menu is larger, with a bit more variety.

It was quite an odd experience and I can't say I have a desire to ever go back.\\n\\nFirst: there were a crazy amount of employees hanging around.  We were there in the 3-4pm hour on a Sunday afternoon (7/2/17), so it definitely wasn't rush time or anything.  But I counted at least 6-7 employees in the dining area alone (evidenced by their Gus's t-shirts), not even counting the cooks I couldn't see.  They far outnumbered customers and it felt a little uncomfortable, like we were \\"invading their space\\" or something.  I also mention the amount of workers there for a curious incident that occurred.\\n\\nWe sat down to order our chicken and noticed a big Coca-Cola cooler behind the counter that displayed cans and bottles of beer, and bottles of wine.  Cool.   So we asked what kind of beer they had.  We were told  \\"oh, we ran out of beer yesterday.\\"   Ran out of beer?  Of all the beers?   Hmmm. Okay.  So then my friend requested a glass of white wine instead.  \\n\\nOur waitress checked IDs and left to get it (so we thought).  But then she came back about 5 minutes later and said:  \\"I'm sorry, I can't serve you wine.\\"\\n\\nWe were perplexed.  Why not?  We are well over 21, and it was late in the afternoon on Sunday.  Were they perhaps out of wine too?  \\n\\n\\"Oh no,\\" she explained. \\"I just can't because I don't have a liquor license.\\"\\n\\nUm.  WHAT?\\n\\nIn all that is holy on this green earth, how is it my ability to have an alcoholic drink dependent on a waitress's eligibility to serve it?  The restaurant clearly has license to serve beer and wine or it wouldn't be there.  And surely someone out of the 6-7 other employees just standing around should have been old enough or licensed enough or whatever else enough to be able to help us instead, no?   And if she really IS ineligible to serve it, wouldn't she have known that already 5 minutes prior when we ordered it?\\n\\nWe weren't going to argue; just got Coca-Colas instead (which at $2.50 a pop is pretty expensive for a fountain drink, in my opinion).  I've had the food before at the downtown Atlanta location and I will say that was spot on and lived up to past experiences.  It's good chicken.  But it's still a little pricey in my opinion. The three tenders comes with beans and slaw but if you want anything else (potato salad, fries, etc.) it costs more: no substitutions are allowed without an up charge.  But the pricing is consistent with all locations, so I'm not slamming Chamblee location for this.  I'm just really turned off by the atmosphere and the service.\\n\\nOn a side note: Halfway through our meal, we saw another employee come in with 12-packs of various beers that were purchased somewhere; he started stocking the Coca-Cola cooler behind the counter with them.  At this point, we had our Cokes so we didn't bother with beer....but it would have been a nice thing had they pointed out they were restocked and we could get one now if we'd like.   (Although, apparently, we wouldn't have been able to anyway since we were sitting at a table served by a woman who couldn't serve us...?   So weird.)\\n\\nI wouldn't come here again and wouldn't recommend it to others.  The chicken, sure.

Tonight was my second visit and just like the first, Black Horse Tavern did not disappoint. \\n\\nMy first experience at the tavern was about a year ago. A few friends and I planned a low key night out for drinks/appetizers and wanted to try something different, but local. The menu at Black Horse has a great variety of classic pub fare starters (mozzarella sticks, buffalo wings, shrimp cocktail, etc) and traditional dishes with a bit of a gourmet twist (New York Sirloin, grilled chicken with a Tahini sauce, mushroom and chicken ravioli, etc). I was a huge fan of the spinach artichoke dip served with homemade tortilla chips. We also ordered a basket of onion rings that night which were delicious. Keep in mind this was a year ago and I still have not forgotten about that fantastic spinach artichoke dip. The menu contains a small, but unique selection of beer and wine. \\n\\nFirst impressions are everything and I had instantly admired the decor upon entering the tavern. I love the dimly lit atmosphere accented by tiny white lights and modern fixtures with a rustic feel. The restaurant is rather small and tables fill up quickly during peak dinner hours so plan accordingly.  A large bar is on the left with a few high top tables nearby for additional seating options. The main dining area is on the right featuring a mixture of booths and tables surrounding a cozy fireplace at the far wall. This is a great date night spot or perfect for meeting friends after work. \\n\\nTonight my mom and I returned to Black Horse for our special night out of dinner and shopping. It seems most of the complaints on here are related to customer service issues, but tonight's staff was extremely friendly and helpful. The hostess greeted us with a smile and our waitress was super sweet and attentive (I wish I could remember her name). The dinner crowd was just slowly starting to arrive when we sat down at 5pm. I ordered the Tavern Chicken (the grilled chicken with the Tahini sauce accompanied by rice pilaf and vegetables). My mom ordered a burger. Our food was served up quickly, unfortunately maybe a little too fast as my mom's burger arrived very rare. She is never one to complain, but we knew this burger was undercooked. Our waitress agreed and quickly alerted the kitchen staff to prepare a new one. It definitely was a big mistake on behalf of the chef, but we felt the issue was handled efficiently and professionally. Our waitress offered my mom bread as she waited and I shared my chicken with her. The new burger arrived within a reasonable amount of time and was cooked spot on according to my mom.

And this is a damn good restaurant. \\n\\nYou know you have a well known obsession when you start getting texts and PM's from fellow Yelpers to test out a cheeseburger joint that's just opened up so that they can get your take on it. After my third nudge in this direction, I actually arranged my precious date night to begin at Smashburger yesterday. I'm classy like that. \\n\\nOff the bat: they're new, people - Give 'em time to grow and settle. The inside is crisp and clean and plain so far - the personality will come with age. And this is a counter service restaurant, not full table service, so this is casual, simple, clean cut and straightforward. Think Mighty Fine or Five Guys style. Walk in, grab a menu on the wall if you can't see the board above the counter, order there, they'll hand you your beverage (they have local craft beer selection, too) and take a seat wherever you want, your food will be delivered. And it comes out promptly. \\n\\nIf you're interested in what \\"smash\\" is all about - it's their cooking technique which you can observe on the screen above the counter. They literally portion out the meat, smash it under a press for 10 seconds, flip once and cook to the perfect temperature. What you get is consistent, dependable flavor and texture. It's a good method as far as I'm concerned. They use 100% Certified Angus beef that is simply seasoned and just well done. \\n\\nI had the Classic Smash  My gooey melty cheese was perfect (I posted a picture of that sucker - tell me you don't drool when you look at it. Wipe the drool away from your mouth and then tell me you didn't drool.) It's served on a butter bun with fresh cut veg. \\n\\nHere are some things they do really right with their burger: \\n\\nMeat - well cooked and seasoned simply, perfectly\\n\\nBun - nice flavor that stands on its own\\n\\nTomato - ripe\\n\\nLettuce- Green leaf lettuce, whole leaves, very fresh\\n\\nRed Onion - First of all, onion on burgers should be red onion, IMO. They slice these perfectly thin so the flavor is subtle, the sweetness shines through. Muah.\\n\\nPickle - Gotta have pickle. Just as I praise them for thin onion, I praise them for thick pickle slices. \\n\\nSignature Sauce - Although I'm pretty sure it's just mustard mixed with mayo, every good burger joint needs a signature sauce to set them apart, and this is a good starting point. Ain't bad, either. \\n\\nHere's what is right about their Avocado Club:\\n\\nErmafriggin'gerd Everything. That chicken is marinated to beyond tender, perfectly seared and juicy, but still a thick, whole chicken breast. On the butter bun with ripe avocado, bacon, lettuce, tomato. They make these flavors sing. I had one bite, ONE, because that's all he would share with me but I swear I'm considering cheating on cheeseburgers next time I'm there. \\n\\nHere's where they're shy of 5 stars:\\n\\nThese puppies fall apart. The butter bun is very tender, it wants a little more substance to be able to hold all these amazing fillings together. The club specifically dismembered itself pretty quickly. \\n\\nWhile this has NOTHING to do with the food and quality you're getting here, and they're extremely new, I'll really be happy to see some character added to these walls. It does feel a little too much like a cafeteria right now, all clean and crisp and red and white. It'll just make the experience warmer when they really settle into their shoes. It'll happen in time. And that patio's got some great potential. \\n\\nTheir fries - I had regular fries which are what I could get at McD's - which is fine. I like some McD fries every now and then. \\n\\nI hear their signature fries which are tossed with herbs are much better and sweet potato fries are always the way to go, so I suggest opting for them or another side, instead. \\n\\nEverything a la carte: I have no problem with this, but it can be off putting to customers, especially those eating alone. The sizes are actually the perfect splitting portion for two which makes it cost effective for a duo. \\n\\nSo, there's my first time assessment. As it stands, I give an enthusiastic thumbs up to the flavors and quality you've got goin' here, Smashburger and I can say that any time I'm on my way to the Cinemark, I'll stop here first. And maybe after."},{"name":"Feng Shui Sushi & Dumplings","address":"1926 Beacon St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Customer service is absolutely terrible!!!

Upon hearing that a new Asian fusion restaurant had finally opened in Cleveland Circle, I absolutely had to give this place a try!\\n\\nFirst things first, the place is very aesthetically pleasing. You could tell great thought was put in transforming this spacious space into a modern, sleek, and clean interior. I love that there are tons of seating and a bar. Compared to its fast-food neighbors, you can't help but expect that the food will be a slight level up from your average Chinese food restaurant... \\n\\nBut my friend and I found our food to be quite average with a price tag that was much more than we thought was worth. My friend and I ordered the house fried rice, sesame chicken, and the soup dumplings--all were good but very average and with slightly small portions. We really felt like we could have paid half the price of our bill and get the same type of food if we had went to Chinatown. \\n\\nGiven that this place is frequented by many college students, I am afraid Feng Shui might have a hard time thriving here given that there are many cheaper options. However, the fact that it is one of the few Asian restaurants here is also an advantage, so I wouldn't be oppose to come back if I am REALLY in a need for an Asian food fix.

Today's experience wasn't competent, and I would downgrade \\"uninspiring\\" to \\"bad.\\"\\n\\nMy wife and I arrived at 11:30, and I was surprised to see that we were the only patrons, as I remembered it being quite lively the other times I'd been. Not a good sign, I thought, but it is a tad early.\\n\\nOur order was taken and we sat down to wait. Ten minutes passed, and we started to wonder just how long it could take to cook some falafel and slice some shwarma. We waited some more, as did the dozen or so other patrons who had come in and ordered. There appeared to be only one person cooking, and she didn't seem to be in too much of a hurry. \\n\\nFinally an order came out--not ours, but for a table that had come in a good 10 minutes after we did. Clearly, something was amiss in the kitchen. At this point, it had been half an hour, so I went up to the counter to see when--or whether--we might expect our order to come (as I had only an hour for lunch). The counter person called back to the cook (only 20 feet away and in plain sight, again in no hurry, it seemed, to get anything done), who, in a very UNapologetic tone, \\"explained\\" that they had been closed all weekend, and so she had to do all the prep work now, and she was the only one to do it. \\"There's nothing I can do about it,\\" she said; the only thing polite about this exchange is that she didn't append the word \\"a$$hole\\" to the end of her sentence, even though she clearly thought it. The only thing that kept me from demanding a refund right then was that the girl working the counter truly was apologetic and promised it would be just a couple of minutes.\\n\\nAnd it was just a couple of minutes, but that's about the only thing good I can say about the food. My beef shwarma was leathery and cold, and the portion was small, perhaps half a dozen scraps served on a bed of lukewarm, insipid saffron rice, which might have been yellow from food coloring rather than saffron. The hummus was OK but forgettable, and the green bean salad was ho-hum, and that's being generous (pretty sure they were canned beans). The plate came with a sad little piece of pita that was stale and tough. The only interesting thing about the meal was trying to figure out how to stretch that miserable little piece so that I would have enough so that I wouldn't have to eat the hummus by itself with my fork. I felt like I was in some miserable canteen in the Eastern Bloc, and there was a pita shortage on.\\n\\nMy wife's salad was nice, and her falafel was a cut above my shwarma, but that's not saying much. It was harder than it should have been, very bland, and, I'm sure, had been reheated in a microwave (like my beef shwarma).\\n\\nIt was truly miserable. The only reason it gets a star at all is that in the past it was OK. My wife, who had never been there before and who is a much more generous soul by nature than I, suggested that perhaps they were indeed just having a bad day. I think not. Judging from the lack of customers in the middle of the lunch hour DOWNTOWN (there were perhaps 15 people in there when we left at 12:30), I think they've had lots and lots of bad days, and the word is now out. \\n\\nI don't think I'll bother ever going back."},{"name":"Pastamore Ristorante & Market","address":"6000 Universal Blvd, Ste 700","city":"Orlando","stars":"2","text":"The food here is mediocre.

My mom commented to the servers in Mandarin that the plates may not all fit on the table, but they assured us they would make them fit. How did they do that? They brought over a little stand to hold our pot of rice and one of the plates. Haha.\\n\\nI didn't try any beef in the beef tendon claypot, but everyone thought it was good. I didn't care for the beancurd sheets though -- they seemed thick and undercooked. I personally enjoyed the scallops, but my mom, brother and fiance all said there were some scallops that tasted very off/not fresh/chemical. My dad and I didn't come across these scallops or taste them, or maybe our tastebuds are defective. I very much enjoyed the salt and pepper squid, wish they had given more! It was served with long noodles of carrots. The beef chow fun was good too, albeit a bit greasy, but that dish typically is. And lastly, the snow pea leaf tips were excellent, well-flavored and tender.\\n\\nDoes Royal China beat Bobo Garden? Overall, no, but I would say it takes second place in my list of Chinese restaurants in the metro Atlanta area.\\n\\nRoyal China is one of the only restaurants in the metro Atlanta area that will do an 8-10 course Chinese dinner -- very key if you are having an Asian wedding. I attended a friend's wedding that was catered by Royal China and everything was excellent, and my fiance and I are also using Royal China for our own wedding.

We surprisingly had room for desert and Jeff, our waiter, suggested the Tortra di Chocolate. It was fantastic with a side of the Nutella gelato and two espressos. It was the perfect end to a great meal. Ross, the manager, invited us down to the basement where we enjoyed a live performance by the @sugarbabiesband who absolutely killed it.

I have been to this place for dinner on two different occasions and I can't speak of any redeeming quality about it. The first night was on a Friday. There was a \\"Live DJ\\" who just played a set list from his computer which was too loud to have a conversation with anyone at the table. Our waiter was nice but had to repeat our order back to us multiple times. We ordered their $2 canned beers which took almost 10 min to get. The food was Almost good and would have received some praise if it wasn't for the roach attack that was going on at our feet. I was ready to write this place off but a friend had a coupon and we thought we would give it another chance. We were seated right away but again it took 10 minutes for Katia to lackadaisically shuffle up to us and, without a hello, ask us what we wanted to drink. We went with the same $2 beers which were brought to us with the same lackadaisical, lifeless personality as before. At this point we decided that we were just going to have the beers and leave. When we asked for the check, we were given attitude from not only Katia, but the little boy who seated us. It took Again, Almost 10 minutes To Get Our Check.  No manager approached us, no attempt was made to inquire if we weren't pleased with our service. They were just willing to write us off. It is important to note that even though the nights were a Friday and Saturday night, it was not busy and were probably more workers that patrons. We will likely never return to this place Which probably doesn't matter cause they are a generic mex restaurant with nothing unique to set them apart and survive along places like taco veloz, corner taqueria, el guaro, or the king of them all Taco T's which after leaving we could, literally, not run fast enough across the street to. \\nSave your money guys.

Went in on a Saturday night in March and was promptly seated in their very small and cozy restaurant. \\n\\nTook forever to get a server to come to our table and when she did, she was so cold. We thought, whatever that's fine, ignore it. Except she went out of her way to be nice to all of her other tables around us. We know because we heard their conversations. She offered to tell them her favorite things on the menu, including drinks, which we certainly didn't get. In fact, when we asked about certain ingredients on the drink, she seemed so annoyed that we didn't know what the obscure licquors were. We tried a couple of the drinks and hated them, so ended up with a bottle of wine. \\n\\nNow for the food...\\n\\nI don't mind when restaurants just list the ingredients of their dishes, instead of the name. Don't mind at all. Except at this restaurant. Where the ingredients/preparations were so inaccurate. Told the server that I wanted the beef dish and she replied, \\"the tartare?\\". Nothing on that list indicated that this was going to be a beef tartare. And I was fine with it, I love tartare, but I hated the smug way she said tartare as if I was supposed to have said that (unknowingly). Anyway, I digress. \\n\\nThe food overall, was not that great. Out of the 6 or so dishes we ordered, there was only like 2 that were worth eating, the tartare and the cabbage. Everything else was mediocre and lacking in flavor. Actually one dish, the mussels, completely ruined the rest. We got it in the middle (everything came out when they felt they should come out) and it had such a strong alkaline taste, mixed with the wine, it was terrible. \\n\\nOverall, great concept and great location. Loved the 2/6 dishes. I would recommend adding more meat dishes into their menu (a lot of vegetarian stuff for that price tag).

I highly recommend the mixed grill/any of the grilled meats and the chicken bastilla--delicious!!! The mix of savory and sweet is not for everyone, so have open-taste buds if this is your first time trying Moroccan cuisine. I think it takes specials skills to do savory baked dishes, and Moroccans have this down to an art in their cuisine.\\n\\nThe merguez tagine was good and very, very hot, so take caution before you scald your mouth and lose the ability to taste anything else.

If we wanted to be served at the bar we had the option, but to let them know so they could get a waitress. We declined saying we prefered a table. The waiting area was in the bar area and was full, so we decided to pull 2 chairs up to a small end table and went to the bar to order 2 glasses of wine while we waited- after a glass of wine and surveying multiple parties being sat, I finally went to see what the problem was- I told her we had been waiting a good half hour and to check our status- we were crossed off the list and at least 5 other parties were sat ahead of us! The hostess apologized and said it gets'confusing' when people sit for wine and thought we had ordered- WE STILL HAD the BEEPER- duh! \\nanyway, we got sat outside and ordered an app of ravioli, which was pretty good and mac n- cheese. The mac n- cheese was ho hum and we expected more than just velveeta and shredded jack melted into elbow pasta. I wish they would have provided more menu options- for eaxmple they had bacon wrapped quail with jalapenos. Good if you're a hunter from Texas, but what about a real simple quail with and nice artichoke wine reduction sauce? It just seemed like they have narrowed down the menu, but don't provide twists to their entree's. I guess I expected more- we will go back for the fried chicken breasts and red mashers, but other than that, take your chance.

My BF (he went to school in singapore, and a big fan of laksa there) said it doesn't beat the one back in singapore but, it was okay if you miss the taste of home.

I had a very hard time believing it was the same bar (in a good way).\\n\\nFor one thing, the layout is completely flipped. While we were there, every table was full, but we felt cozy, not crowded. Highlight: the bar has coat hooks AND electrical outlets. Sorry, but this millennial ALWAYS has a dead phone. So nice that I won't have to bother the bartender or search for somewhere to plug in when I need to!\\n\\nBrian Poe's new menu for Buk's is absolutely fantastic. We each got a different burger with tots, and each person in our party was thrilled with the outcome. I got an Elk burger, and damn but I felt majestic. We all agreed that we were comfortably full--the burgers seemed small, but they were hearty. We split the three desserts on the menu. My favorite was the caramel pecan tart, but there was something for everyone for sure.\\n\\nOur server was ON IT--our water glasses were never empty, and she kept the beer flowing. I'm picky, and she didn't mind. She brought me samples of a couple things I probably wouldn't have ordered on my own, and I found a new favorite! Great success!\\n\\nOne fun thing I noticed was that the room filled up for dinner. We weren't the only ones enjoying these incredible burgers. I can't wait to go back, everything was so good. THIS is what a renovation should be (coughcough, Brass Union/Precinct, take note)!\\n\\nFor those complaining that their favorite dive bar is gone...there are still countless dive bars in the area. Druid, Atwoods, Bull McCabe's, Sally O'Brien's...need I go on? Don't begrudge me this awesome culinary experience! You can still get a hot dog and a forty for $7 here."},{"name":"Madras Pavilion","address":"9025 Research Blvd, Ste 100","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I was in town for a few days from Chicago and I got a taste for some Indian food.

Food was great pretty big portions got the seafood combo (shrimp,lobster tail,scallops) came with rice and mixed vegetables w/ a side of salad.Place is nice and clean but the reason I gave it 3 stars is the wait staff they were really rude and quick to hurry us along. We waited a good 20mins before anyone asked us if we wanted anything to drink. Ordered wine and wasn't placed in a bucket or anything just placed it by the grill to get warm. Barely done with my salad and he was already reaching over me to collect my bowl just really annoying when your trying to enjoy yourself and get a feel for a new place your trying out. When dinner came to an end we were being rushed and they continued to march over and say thank you have a good night and we were not ready to go still had some drinks to finish. I understand that there are other people waiting but we just needed 5more mins to finish up and there was other tables wide open. Overall food was great but would rather go elsewhere and be treated like your welcome and not being rushed out the door.

The prices are reasonable, it's a bright, sunny place, they serve breakfast all day, and there's plenty of parking and coffee. However, we must reserve 5 star ratings for perfection. \\n\\nFood - 4 stars: While my spinach, tomato, and feta omelet, hashbrowns, and multi-grain pancake were incredibly fresh and good, I couldn't help but feel it could have been a little better. I loved the thick, cinnamon-y pancake, and the hashbrowns were good enough. The omelet was stuffed full of veggies, but it had no flavor other than whatever flavor is inherent in cooked spinach and fresh tomatoes. I also found the eggs to be dry. At least it was a healthy breakfast, and I didn't feel like I was going to pass out in the parking lot like after leaving Trudy's brunch. On my second visit I treated myself to some fantastic $1.85 breakfast tacos which seemed to be made with homemade tortillas. They use the hashbrowns as the potatoes in their tacos - genius.\\n\\nDrinks - 4 stars: My large nonfat macadamia nut latte was served up in a giant mug and satisfied all my coffee desires for a month. My friend's caramel and whipped cream drink was equally delicious, if far more guilt-inducing. Unfortunately, the chai latte was made with a store-bought mix and thus a totally over-sweetended disappointment and lacking any sort of chai spice personality.\\n\\nService and atmosphere - 5 stars: This place has a great vibe, with lots of eclectic artwork and random cafe type items on the walls. The waitstaff is incredibly friendly, along with a particularly cute waiter - who doesn't like some eye candy with their syrup?

I will be back just for that drink!   We ordered the calamari, which was surprisingly fresh, and a different take with a cornmeal coating rather than the typical bread crumbs.  It was served on a bed of spinach greens, and good (different from typical calamari at a restaurant) but very good.  \\n\\nFor our \\"big bites\\", I got the cast iron pie (chicken pot pie) and it was amazeballs!  I couldn't finish it so my husband finished it and said he was one of the best pot pies he's ever had.  My husband ordered the carbonara, and said it was fine, but just reminded him he was not at bocca lupo.  He didn't say it was bad, just would not order again.  It's hard to serve pasta, when you have bocca lupo and sotto sotto spitting distance away.  \\n\\nService was very good, and kept my water glass full, which was really good since I was so dehydrated from drinking at the festival for 6 hours.   \\n\\nOverall I'm thrilled with Ration & Dram, and can't wait to return!   \\nP.S.

Think, micro-brew orgasms all day long from some of Portland's best and then the epic fail of trying Deschutes after. \\n\\nI was interested in their porter and stout styles, and my boyfriend was interested in their hoppy pale ales. Two different styles, compromise right? \\n\\nWe sat at a cocktail table near the bar, and got choppy service from one of their bar girls. We ordered a flight of 6 tasters for $6.50: Black Butte XXII, Bourbon Aged Graveyard Stout, Armory XPA, Amber Dawn, The Virgilator, and Pepper Keller Bier. All were sub-par for microbrews, but nothing to write home about (coincidentally I am writing Yelp about). Their styles and flavors reminded me of \\"oh this just tastes like any ol' pale ale to me.\\" The only one that stood out was the Bourbon Aged Graveyard Stout. \\n\\nOther than that, save your beer buds for Hopworks, Hair of the Dog, Upright, and Cascade.

For years I've eschewed Bukowski's, having assessed the food to be sub-par.  I'm just not a fan of greasy bar food.  And since it lies between two of my most favorite places, The Druid and Atwood's, why would I bother with Bukowski's?\\n\\n\\"But they have really good french fries!\\" people would say.  Maybe so, but there are a lot of places with good fries, and a few places with amaaazing fries (hello, Garden at the Cellar!) so Bukowski's supposedly good fries weren't enough to entice me into its darkened space.\\n\\nBut I ran into a couple of good friends on Cambridge Street this evening, and they invited me to join them at Bukowski's.  My heart sank ever so slightly and for a moment I considered suggesting All Star Sandwich Bar.  Or The Druid.

Maybe it's because when I first moved to Ohio, I was living near Cleveland and visited the West Side Market, and somehow equated it with the North Market when I moved to Columbus.  Regardless, when I feel like splurging on some high quality, fancy-schmancy groceries, this is where I go.  You can most often find me at the Greener Grocer, where I've purchased kale, potatoes, mushrooms, apples, bananas, lemons, peppers, oranges, and so on.  They, like many of the other vendors, prefer cash for smaller transactions, but will accept your card even if it is under $10.  I've been getting a good deal on kale here this summer, although some of the non-local items like citrus and tropicals can be found cheaper at Whole Foods.  I've also splurged on bison from Bluescreek Farm Meats and gnocchi at Pastaria.  I'm trying to avoid getting too accustomed to buying groceries here though, since it can really add up quickly!\\n\\nI have not tried many of the hot food vendors yet, usually because when I do go around lunchtime, there are SO MANY PEOPLE that I just want to grab what I need from the Greener Grocer and get out.  Weekends are worse, since there is the Farmer's Market and, during the summer, tons of events at nearby Goodale Park, so trying to find a place to park and navigating the narrow aisles when masses of people are crowding around the different stands is a nightmare.  Add in kids, confused tourists, and people carrying hot lunches, and you'll understand why I try to swing by on weekday afternoons rather than any other time.

Plus they serve it with a little fruit salad that is SO GOOD!  I was initially surprised that the ham in the sandwich was cold, but it actually warmed up from the hot bread and cheese after a couple of bites. The portion size was huge, the quality of ingredients was amazing, and the service was very friendly.  Eric got the Cuban, which he said was just as delicious.  I ordered a red velvet cake pop because i wanted to try the dessert, but couldn't possibly eat anything full size. \\n\\nThe owner, Joy, and her husband checked on us a couple of times and when she found out it was our first time there, she ran and got us a cupcake each to try.

I'm not sure if it was just my high expectations from the past OR if my standards have changed OR if the restaurant has gone downhill.... but overall I just felt the quality of the food wasn't as amazing as before. Still made for a very delicious meal with wonderful service at a perfect pace, and the environment is totally spot-on. They ran out of the petite porkchop which was my go-to, but my hubby and I split a medium porkchop. Same flavor but just overcooked compared to before and not quite as melt-in-your mouth. The kale salad sounded potentially delicious but was lacking in dressing and wasn't fully incorporated, resulting in some bitterness to the kale (in my experience this improves from the acidity of the dressing if it's adequately applied).

By that point everyone else had finished their meals. \\n\\nAs for the service, you are only able to order from your server when they come to your table. This includes drinks. It takes forever to get refills once the sets start (understandable, as it gets quite dark in there), and we barely saw our server in between the acts, which meant we were there for 3 hours and only able to get 2 drinks.

But there always seems to be something that happens that makes my experience less than. I've once been told that an Irish coffee was a \\"bad\\" drink and if I wanted one I'd have to mix the ingredients myself. On another occasion the restaurant decided to close early because it was slow so we were rushed out. \\n\\nThis past occasion, we walked in without a reservation and were told it would be approximately 10 minutes for them to clear a table. Not a problem - we would sit at the bar until the table was ready. Forty minutes later we ask about an update and they realize they forgot to seat us. Still, not a major problem, but a little annoying. Once we were seated at our table, we tried to order a couple of snacks/appetizers. In fact, we ordered them twice. However, the waiter still never brought the snacks/appetizers. We ended up separately ordering bread service and another plate to tie us over until the entrees arrived. It was too awkward to have to ask for a third time about the original order. Luckily the missing snacks/appetizers didn't show up on the bill at the end. \\n\\nIn the end, I'd still recommend this place - the food and drinks are really great as I mentioned at the onset.

Without designating one person to the register and one to the pizza line. \\n\\nStraight from the cocaine-dipped dollar bills and bacteria-wielding register keypads to dipping those fingers directly into the olive bin.\\n\\n!!!\\n\\nThe fluorescents were overly bright and the floors under-cleaned.\\n\\nOn top of that, the pizza was so lacking in any sort of pizzazz or fulfilling character that the marinara sauce was visible around holes that should've been filled by self-sacrificing cheese and veggies.\\n\\n*sigh*\\n\\nThe plus side is that I'm over my pizza cravings now!"},{"name":"Tarka Indian Kitchen","address":"11501 Rock Rose Ave, Ste 124","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Tarka is Indian Kitchen for name sake!

I chose to come to this place since I saw a lot of good reviews and since I'm a vegan, I decided to give this place a shot. There's barely any parking and you cannot park in the parking lot on the side of the building.  The restaurant itself is on the smaller side and is outdated with hardly any air conditioning. No one was up at the front to seat the customers and I had to find a server to tell me I wanted to be seated.  The main reason why I'm giving this place a bad review was the horrible service.  The waitresses were extremely slow and the food took an hour to arrive. AN HOUR.  I would have been out of the door by the time an hour passes if I ate at a regular restaurant or less.  I had to ask the waitress several times when my food came out and she reassured me it'll come by soon, another 20 minutes passes by. I finally get my food and it was delicious, especially the cauliflower BBQ.  I checked the time and I've been in the restaurant for an hour an thirty minutes.. ridiculous. I asked for the bill and when they didn't come back to take the cash, I put my money in the book and left.  Incredibly disappointed in the service.

As a vegetarian, I asked about their menu option that says \\"we can make any meal vegetarian- just ask!\\" but this wasn't really the case. When I asked the server, she said I could just be served what was already vegetarian on the menu, which was about 2 items, neither of which would have been my first choice. The server was not phased by the strangeness of having something on the menu and then telling me that actually no, that was not the case. Had she expressed apologies or gave an explanation as to why I could request a simple burger to be made vegetarian (i.e. all the ingredients minus the meat patty), they could have gotten 5 stars. Also, the entree I got involved some ricotta-filled noodles as the main dish, garnished with mushrooms and spinach. However, there were about 5 tiny noodles, and mostly mushy-textured mushrooms.

I stopped in a while back and picked up a few slices of cake to try.  Unfortunately, my helpers backed out on me and left me with 3 huge slices of cake to contend with on my own. :(  It took a few days for the record. \\n\\n- German chocolate cake: This was my favorite.  The chocolate cake was good flavor-wise and the cake had bits of chocolate in it.  The traditional coconut/pecan icing was good, but there needed to be more of it.  In addition to the regular icing, there was a second chocolate icing that was really tasty and had maybe a hint of (Kahlua?) in it.  While it was great, there was maybe a little too much of that secondary icing though.  All in all, this was very good, but needed more of that standard German chocolate cake icing.  \\n\\n- Key lime pie cake: The concept was intriguing, but I wasn't feeling the execution - it really just didn't taste much like key lime pie at all.  The cake part is just regular cake.  For some reason, they put tons of shaved white chocolate on the outside of the cake which makes it way too sweet.  The only time you can even tell it's supposed to be like key lime pie is when you get some of the lime filling in between the layers - but it's so minimal that it doesn't really make much of an impact.  Overall, it was too sweet and not tart and limey enough to recall key lime pie.  \\n\\n- Caramel cake: I'm a huge fan of caramel cake, but I thought this was only ok.  I think the caramel cake at Piece of Cake is much better.  The caramel icing was decent, but nothing special.  And the cake...  \\n\\nMy main problem with all of the cakes I tried was the texture of the cake itself - it was a little too dry and sponge-y/airy for my taste (I prefer a moister, denser texture).  It wasn't bad or anything, but it just wasn't totally in line with my taste.     \\n\\nOverall, I thought the cakes I tried were good but not amazing.  The slices were a little over $5 each, but I thought it was a decent value since they were large slices.

Lively and full of people enjoying themselves. Of course the beer was on point and I was even able to sample some labels I've never had before.

Comes with pub fries. It was good, but I feel the bun could have been a little softer. It was one of those that you really have to chew into to get through and that squeezes out everything from the other side. \\nService was pretty slow.

I sat down and every immediately was attentive and friendly which is a huge plus in my book. They were not overly annoying either with coming back to the table.

It was a great way to try a bunch of things, instead of committing to one entree.  I found everything okay, but nothing spectacular, while Matt raved about his.  You get a trio of Indian condiments so you can add some spice or flavor, if you like.   I also tried the wine that goes well with spicy food.\\n \\nThe next time, I tried the lamb masala.  I ordered it medium spicy.  (The choices are mild, medium, hot, and very hot.)  It was okay, but the lamb was a tiny bit fatty and tough, as lamb often is.  Masala isn't ordinarily that spicy, so I had no problem with the spicy level.  Matt got the veggie thali, again.\\n \\nThe third time, on Black Friday, we were too late for the lunch buffet, since it was 3:00, but we were the only ones in there, so the owner himself took care of us.  I decided to go for the Chicken Vindaloo, and ordered it hot, thinking that was a level I could handle, since the medium Masala hadn't been that bad.  The owner suggested that I try medium, since the hot is well, hot.  (I guess they use the Asian scale of spiciness, rather than the gringo scale.)   I'm so glad he talked me into medium, because the medium vindaloo was so spicy it gave me the hiccups.  Thankfully, I had ordered a mango lassi, since I knew that was the best antidote to overly spicy food.  Along with our check, we were given a small bowl of fennel seeds.  These are great for breath-freshening, cleaning up the last of any spicy after tastes, and aiding in digestion.\\n \\nI'm not sure why people are complaining about getting charged for naan or rice. This is what I'm used to at sit-down Indian restaurants. Yes, rice goes great with curry, but so does naan OR rice. (Or roti, if you're at a place that serves it.)

The beef was definitely not cooked to order--so at least it came out quickly!--but it was old, dry and sinewy.

Personally found the peppers / tomatoes here more flavorful and less mushy than Sound bites but maybe it's just cuz I had the added mushrooms. They give you A LOT of eggs, and despite my ravenous hunger, I couldn't finish more than half the food. I subbed out fries for fruit and was surprised by the diversity of fruit they had! There were kiwis and mango and pineapple and strawberries and watermelon."},{"name":"Habanero Mexican Grill","address":"166 Brighton Ave","city":"Allston","stars":"4","text":"Great place.

In true Thai style, the service is friendly and professional; you are made to feel welcome immediately. \\n\\nThe menu is very well organized and classified by flavorings and spiciness, plus you can vary it as needed.  I always try to get soup. It takes me a couple of sips to get use to their Tom Yum soup because it's slightly spicier than I'm used to in a soup in general, but it's worth it for the deep flavor.  Appetizers such as their rolls and gold bags are again full of flavor and complimented nicely by the accompanying dipping sauces.\\n\\nFor entrees I've enjoyed their curry dishes, chicken dishes, and just about anything which can come with a peanut sauce. I've never had a bad - or even a bland - meal here.  \\n\\nI'm sure all their desserts are enjoyable, but they do such a great job with their fried ice cream, my take has been \\"Why order anything else?\\" \\n\\nThe one thing you might not get here is Wi-Fi coverage, at least if you have Verizon.

She was patient and knowledgeable about the menu and bar items. We hated the mac and cheese. The collard greens and grits were ok. We all enjoyed The fried chicken and wings.  The sausage link was a nice addition to the menu. We weren't sure about the cornbread at first, but the more I ate it the more I began to like it. Our drinks were very good. Try the pinochle if you like peanuts and coke. Parking can be a challenge in south end. There are meters nearby and they're free after 6.

They've been open less than two weeks and just got their liquor license so things aren't perfect yet, but they're promising. The upstairs space is bright, airy and sleekly designed; more inviting than the smaller downstairs space. A small list of creative cocktails, craft beers and good wine options. My vodka and citrus cocktail was well-balanced and refreshing. Duck wontons were hot and crunchy, with a slightly-too-sweet sauce. My duck liver salad, served on a soft, buttery roll, might have used a bit more seasoning. The sweet potato wedges ordered as a side by my teen were artfully stacked and multi-hued, but inconsistently cooked and partly raw. My husband ate every bite of his carbonara. He loved the sausage in it, and wished they'd been less stingy with the chard. I thought the bacon caramel popcorn was a perfect finish, but my companions found it too sweet. But we quibble. Fresh, local meats and vegetables, affordably priced, unique dishes, two bars, pleasant outdoor seating areas?

It probably would have been healthier too. I simply wanted some baked fish and veggies to go.  Apparently, I now have to wait in line 20 some odd minutes instead of utilizing the \\"to go\\" area which appears to have been vacated. Ok, times change, I get it.  So, I join the crowd in peak lunch hour anticipation.  The almandine is no more, sad- but I can adapt to these obstacles in life, and opt for the plain baked fish, planning to scrape off the mayo topping.  I add my two sides, pay, and return to the office 45 min later - bag in hand, hungry enough to eat Styrofoam at this point.  That might have actually been a better option in retrospect, as I anxiously open my container to find my fish swimming in grease, I mean it is literally fish soup - had this little guy not been butchered and baked, he could've stood a chance of survival in that mess.  Though I suppose clogged arteries or a heart attack would've done him in before long.  Then there was the squash and spinach - at least I think that is what it was -forget about touching that -much less eating it- it is saturated beyond rescue, much less recognition.  A big mac would have been healthier than these once were vegetables.  Still, I have to eat something or will be passed out on the floor before day's end and there is no time to go elsewhere now. Not to mention the lunch funds invested. So, I blot the fish the best I can, grabbing an entire roll of paper towels to take on this task. It is oozing w/fake butter, oil, whatever it is you put in there.  I did the best I could w/what I had and haven't had to call 911 yet.   So life is good.  But the Luby's on Oltorf is far from it.\\n\\n \\n \\n \\nI have eaten at Lubys for ages.  Mainly the locations off Far West, and the stores in Round Rock and Georgetown.  The food has always been good - you order the baked fish - you know what you are getting.  It is always pretty much the same every time, which is good enough to keep me coming back. Yes, there is butter on the food, I get that - sometimes more than others, but it has never been like this -oiled up, sure.  Infused insanity - not til today.  Thus, why I will never return to the Oltorf location.  If I want that much oil, I will go to Groovy Lube.  If I want a meal, I will go somewhere that has the conviction that oil is used to prepare food, not for it to be served as a main course."},{"name":"Bistro Niko","address":"3344 Peachtree Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Outdoor high end shops and nice restaurants in this self contained newer area in Buckhead, give up on parking on the street go straight away for the parking garages.

To sum it up...I will be back to try a sandwich and hopefully take a pal to share it."},{"name":"Saba","address":"350 Mead Rd, Ste E & F","city":"Decatur","stars":"3.5","text":"Thanks Scoutmob, for introducing me to new restaurants I would have never tried had it not been for your 50% off deals. Such is the case with Saba restaurant in Decatur (Oakhurst). Waiting until just two days before the deal expired, I had reason to visit Saba when I picked up a friend from the Airport. Ok, maybe Saba was a bit out of the way, but hey, 50% is reason enough to visit, right?\\n\\nI checked out the Saba address and was taken to the Emory location (via my Google Maps app on my phone), not the Decatur location as what the Scoutmob deal was for. The Emory location was empty on this Saturday night, save for one couple with their toddler. As we ordered at the counter - no table service here, I presented my Scoutmob deal. Since it was the wrong location, they politely refused to honor it. Had it been my restaurant, I'd have honored the coupon, welcoming the new traffic and increased business but whatevs.\\n\\nSo, we trekked out to the Decatur location. Made up of pastas and sandwiches, Saba's primarily Italian menu has some unique offerings like Thai Ravioli with peanut and cilantro sauce as well as Vindaloo Tofu Spaghetti. Saba is great restaurant for vegetarians as there are lots of vegetarian options on their menu.\\n\\nOne vegetarian item I had to try was the Pumpkin Ravioli. It is offered as an entree rather than an appetizer. But I ordered it for the table to share, asking our server to bring it out ahead of the meals. It was a good choice, albeit, almost too sweet with it's brown butter glaze. It was also a little on the dry side. I would have liked to see more sauce to the dish. But all in all, it was tasty and I was certainly not sorry I ordered it.\\n\\nWe all had salads as well. Although they are technically sides for our meals, we asked that they come out with ahead. The plain salad as well as the Arugula salad ($0.50 upcharge) I ordered, while fresh, had no pizzaz. There was barely any dressing and I was hoping for at least a couple grape tomatoes or something, but nothing except some cheese. The Caprese salad  was the only salad that was exceptional in any way.\\n\\nMy boyfriend opted for the Thai Ravioli with chicken. It was quite tasty. And not spicy at all as some Thai dishes can be. It is like your basic Pad Thai sauce put with Ravioli instead of Thai noodles. George, our friend, ordered the Wild Mushroom Ravioli in a garlic cream sauce. It was very bland and completely forgettable. I heard him mutter the words \\"Chef Boyardee\\" shortly after digging in.\\n\\nI loved my sausage sandwich. It was huge and hearty - well worth the $8 bucks even without a side dish. I was expecting a sausage link on a hoagie bun or something similar, but what I got was ground sausage with onions and red peppers served up on two huge ciabatta buns. The bread here is insanely delicious and so fresh. I fully intended to save the rest of my sandwich but I couldn't help but share with my dining companions.\\n\\nIt is kind of a shame Decatur is so out of the way, otherwise I could see myself spending a lot of fun evenings there. I enjoyed my evening at Saba, but it definitely is a neighborhood restaurant (read: if you live in Decatur worth visiting) but not a dining destination in my opinion."},{"name":"Gustav's Pub & Grill","address":"10350 SW Greenburg Rd","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Originally had \\"reservations\\" at the Red Lobster, next door, but when we go there, they \\"lost\\" our names.

However one thing that keeps cropping up that really tests that optimism and has made me a horribly cynic pizza eater over the years are jack of all trades restaurants that just happen to serve pizza as well.  So when the super-friendly duo behind PizzaAdventuring.com , Karin and Ian, invited us out to eat some pies with them at NXNW we were very happy to meet some fellow pizza lovers on one hand, but on the other naturally skeptical about the pizza we were about to indulge ourselves in.\\n\\nOur typical thought is that these types of places are never baking with a proper oven or even employing decent pizza makers. The pizza station is usually filled with a dude who hasn't worked his way up to line cook territory yet.   When we walked in we were shocked to see an honest to goodness pizza oven burning real wood.  (Although we joked that we may have to look closer as it may have just been one of those gas burning fireplace effect logs in the back of the oven).   At this point we are thinking that maybe the pizza would be legit at NXNW.\\n\\nWe ordered a few pies; they offer one size and it's for a child (this theme will continue to resurface).   Very quickly our pizzas arrived and I felt like I had just been ripped off, like a band-aid on an open wound...it hurt.  WTF was this?  Once again I ask the question to whoever will listen....why have a wood fired oven if you aren't going to use it to its potential?  You are just cheapening your product and insulting pizza lovers and chefs everywhere in the process. My guess is they had that oven cooking at about 500 degrees (although the dude working it said 300), what are we going for here? Is NXNW part of the new slow pizza movement that they just started?  All of our pizzas featured the same bland tasting crust.  The toppings were only a little better.  The cheese was average tasting, the pepperoni's reminded me of store bought Hormel brand meats, and the sauce was pretty much absent.  However the little that was present managed to give me acid reflux for some reason, so for that I thank you NXNW.   All of that coupled with some poor table service had me thinking that we deserved better.\\n\\nThe bottom line is that I have had this pizza before here in Austin.  It reminded me very much of EZ's but really wasn't as good as that sub-par place.  Red Robin serves a kid's pizza on their kids menu and honestly I think it's even better than this place.  On the Brightside NXNW just happens to brew its own beer, and it's pretty damned good.   Maybe getting wrecked on their micro-brews would make that train-wreck of a pizza better....but I doubt it"},{"name":"Ruth's Chris Steak House - Buckhead Atlanta","address":"3285 Peachtree Rd NE","city":"Buckhead","stars":"3.5","text":"We were given a gift card from a friend that was $100.

After exchanging an ID as hostage for the table buzzer, we went to the bar to grab a drink while waiting for our table.  Even though the bar was full, once we were in the vicinity of a bartender, they made sure to acknowledge us over the people sitting at the bar, which meant we got our drinks within minutes.  Sure enough, in 13 minutes our table was ready and we were seated outside.  While it wasn't impossible to talk inside, it was definitely much easier to have a conversation at an outdoor table.   \\n\\nThe menu boasted a decent selection of Irish Pub fare with sandwiches around $10 and dinners around $20, but what the menu didn't fully reveal was how deliciously gourmet everything was!  I ordered a simple grilled cheese and was pleasantly surprised to find a truly unique homemade brown bread, almost cornbread, thick and dense wrapped around melted cheddar.  The tomato chutney was a sweet and chunky compliment that I couldn't ignore after one taste.

We have tried before, but it was too busy. Thought that was a good sign, and normally is. We eat and cook Asian food, so we were excited to get in here. \\n\\nI understand the good reviews this place gets as it feels pretty authentic. I dont really get the 5 stars, and maybe it is just me. \\n\\nPerhaps we should have gotten different dishes for our first time through, but I got Spicy Squid, my wife got pork and noodles, son got chicken and noodles. Oh, we got an order of the homemade dumplings. \\n\\nQuite honestly, I make dumplings as good as theirs, but mine are pretty good. No big deal there. Our dishes came out and tasted good. Not great, but pretty darn good. Generally speaking, my belief is that the dishes are a touch too oily. I am not a fat-phobia, but the food came across a bit greasy. This is not necessary. \\n\\nAlso, although my dish was named Spicy Squid with Noodles, it probably should have been more acurately named Stir fried cabbage, with some (good) noodles, and wisps of squid. Really, there was not much squid in this dish, and for the price ($12) there should be more. Same for the other dishes- heavy on the stir fried cabbage, some noodles, and dinky amounts of meat. \\n\\nFinally, our dinner for the three dishes (plus the dumplings) was $40 plus tip. That was just too much money for what we got. It was good (pretty good), but Asian food of this caliber should not be that much. Ok, I will give them some for the handmade noodles, but for my money, I will spend a whole lot less at another Asian Rest. Just my thought. \\n\\nOne really good criteria for us on how good the restaurant is, is when we get in the car to go home we ask each other if we would go back. I am not sure we would go back again.

But, I've been twice now, and they were terrible both times.\\n\\nThe first time I went was several months ago, and a few of my friends and I went for hangover breakfast tacos one Sunday morning.

And all they did was not charge me for that taco.\\n\\nWent again to give them another try today. I ordered what they called Migas. That was NOT migas. That was a bunch of hashbrowns (which were actually decent, though bland), some scrambled eggs with soggy tortilla chips in them, some COLD cheese thrown on top (it didn't even attempt to melt), with some salsa (\\"meh\\" at the salsa) on the side. Given, it was sort of described that way, at least as to the eggs, tortillas, side of salsa and hashbrowns. Oh! And 2, count them, 2 *small* flour tortillas. It *was* a good amount of food, I'll give them that. Enough that there's no chance that 2 tortillas would be enough. All around, one of the worst migas's that I've ever had, and I hesitate to even call it Migas. Even the chai sucked! It was bland and kinda watery, for a chai. Rich and spicy and yummy? Nope. Not in the least. It was also so hot that I couldn't touch it until I'd finished eating. And served in a glass (not ceramic, just glass) mug, so I scalded my lips before my mouth. (I'd never actually complain about a coffee-ish drink being too hot, as that's just silly. So I just waited for it to cool enough that I could put my lips to the glass. But worth noting.) Oh, and the waitress today wasn't friendly at all. (I tried to discount this at first, because my companion wasn't very friendly or polite, but *I* tried to make up for that, by being very much so to her, to no avail.) And she didn't even come back to the table to check on us, until she came to clear plates.

The special events coordinator, Kristen P., is great to work with and the service is always top-notch!  The managers are all really helpful too and the owner Jim Cafarelli is always around, usually assisting with the tapings in the kitchen studio.\\n\\nOur server, Jonathan, never introduced himself (only know his name from the check) and brought ONE Restaurant Week menu for a table of six.  He did not smile ONCE during the meal which is key to me.  You should make people feel warm and welcome at your establishment, not like you'd rather be someplace else and are only doing this job for the tips.\\n\\nOne of my friends loved the hummus/olive oil dip and asked for seconds to go with the bread.  Well, there are two small pieces of bread left in the basket so you think the server would have known to bring an additional basket to the table with the dip, but no.  Hrmm, I guess we can dip our fingers in the dip and eat it off of our hands.  Why would we ask for dip if there is nothing to dip in it?!?!?!  I recently went to Bertucci's and our waiter there not only brought extra bread as soon as he saw we devoured it, but gave us extra to take home.  Surely, RK should be able to match that service.\\n\\nAnyhoooo, again, thank goodness the food redeems itself.  From the fresh potato crisps at the bar to the fresh pasta and bread, nothing I have ever had at RK has disappointed me.  Tonight, my starter of arancini was DELICIOUS.  I've had arancini at many venues, even Fenway Park, and RK's beats out Aramark's dish hands down.  The serving was plentiful too!  Three huge balls of mozzarella (hey no comments from the peanut gallery) lay underneath a bed of arugula and grapefruit in a decadent mystery sauce.  The cheese was melty and gooey and the rice inside the balls was fresh and a good consistency.  \\n\\nI won't go into detail regarding all of the courses because I am drooling just thinking about it, but  suffice it to say that all 6 of us finished our plates for courses 1, 2, and 3.

Unfortunately my experience was not great, not even good or palatable. \\n\\nI started by trying their beer. This is a brewery, so I figured it would be good and tasty. WRONG!...licking a dripping hippy armpit in Hyde Park would have tasted better. I am very aware of what an unfiltered beer should taste like. Having it so chunky that you can see the hops powder is not cool. \\n\\nAfter a sip of beer I needed something to absorb it before my meal, so I got onion rings. Description says \\"beer battered\\". You'd think they would be big and doughy. Not so. They must be beer battered minimally and then packed in panko breadcrumbs. Very crunchy, without a lot of flavor. They are served with ketchup that tasted like it had cinnamon or nutmeg in it. Not a fan of chefs getting creative with a bottle of ketchup....maybe if you make it from scratch, but it was obviously regular ketchup with something added.\\n\\nI ordered the chicken club sandwich... something that is noted as a *favorite* on the menu. It came with \\"famous\\" garlic fries...only thing famous about the fries is that if I ate more than the few I had, I might have blown up. Fries were soggy regular thick fries with a strong garlic shake salt blend on them...very gross. Sandwich was ok.

Together it was just unbelievable. \\n\\nI saved the filet mignon for last because very few; VERY few things cause me to be at a lack for words.  Capos filet mignon is simply beef done totally correctly, seasoned perfectly, temperature held to a degree and it does melt in your mouth.

What's so difficult about cooking a blue cheese and bacon burger, frying up some fries and delivering it to the customer while the food is still hot? It's apparently quite a challenge at Deschutes Brewery because what landed on my table tonight was not tasty, hot or even fresh. It was a mess. \\n\\nI had my reservations about Deschutes Brewery yet decided, after reading a series of mostly positive reviews [3-4 stars] here on Yelp along with a glowing review in The Oregonian, to finally give it a try. Until tonight I had resisted coming here assuming [correctly] that this slickly-designed popular brewpub would offer little more than over-priced sub par 'pub grub' in an otherwise smartly designed northwest-themed dining hall. It turned out I was right. \\n\\nThis is not the first time I've been steered wrong by Yelpers and likely won't be the last. But for the umpteenth time, I've realized that my gut instincts serve me well and my gut has always told me to 'skip' Deschutes and find another place to go for basic burger and beer type fare. Tonight I didn't listen to my own good senses and paid the price. \\n\\nWhat I find so frustrating about a place like this is that it has so much going for it - except, of course, the food. It's in a great location, is attractive, has friendly outgoing staff, decent beer and the prices are - while a bit steep - reasonable. The problem, of course, is that it's a 'brewpub' and essential to the success of said 'pub' is that the food is edible. Mine wasn't. My companion called her entree 'mall food' and after a taste of her tired looking and tasting reuben, I couldn't agree more. Even the cole slaw served as a side was watery, tasteless and forgettable. \\n\\nI'm not being mean or spiteful, the food is just a notch below mediocre, like something you'd get at a Carl's Jr late at night when the kitchen staff was tired and in a bad mood. The only difference between the Deschutes burger and a Carl's Jr burger is that your burger from Carl's Jr is $3 not $12. \\n\\nSpecifically, the plate of food that landed on my table was certifiably unexceptional in every respect. Let's review: \\n- The bun: stale, tasteless and out of a plastic bag. This is what I'd expect at a fast food place and even there, I'd probably get a better bun. I left two thirds of it on the plate. \\n- The beef: In a word, tasteless; overcooked, tired, plain, not moist. \\n- The bacon: two dried out tasteless slices that didn't even look like they were cooked that day and reminded me of the 'bacon' they serve at Subway; one of the reasons I no longer eat there either. \\n- Oregon Blue Cheese: Some small tasteless 'dots' of something white on my burger which I can only guess is what constitutes 'blue cheese' in Oregon. I'm sorry for the cows forced to participated in every aspect of this meal; it's as much an embarrassment for them as it was a disappointment for me. \\n- Fries: A thoughtless indulgent pile of tasteless mushy inedible fries served warm bordering on room temperature - a result of sitting too long under a heating lamp. I probably ate 7 of them and left the rest which thankfully ended in the trash - where they belonged in the first place.\\n- Tomato: The best part of the meal. I didn't contaminate it by putting it on the burger and just ate it separately and it tasted good. It was, in fact, the only thing I ate with any flavor. \\n\\nFrustratingly Deschutes got a lot right when they built their $5 million brew pub in the heart of the Pearl but they unfortunately grossly miscalculated on a key ingredient: the food. Check out the following quote from the Oregonian just before Deschutes opened: \\"As a brewpub, we'll exceed people's expectations,\\" said chef Jeff Usinowicz. \\"We'll definitely be a brewpub, but we'll also be a great restaurant -- the kind of place where, if you don't feel like getting dressed up for Bluehour, you can drop by as you are for some great food and great beer.\\"\\n\\nHere's a news flash for you Jeff: There's no comparison between your food and that served at Bluehour - it's not even close. Not for nothing, Bluehour actually serves french fries worth eating. And I doubt people who frequent Bluehour would ever be bothered to stroll down the street and stand around waiting 30+ minutes while holding a tacky plastic flashing 'table-is-ready' hockypuck for the privilege of eating your sloppy, unimaginative and tasteless overcooked food. In fact, I'd guarantee it. Most of the customers, eating at Deschutes tonight, looked like they came for the portions; not the quality if you get my drift? \\n\\nWell you got my $40 bucks once; but you won't get it again."},{"name":"IL Mondo Pizzeria","address":"738 Huntington Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"The kindest people and the yummiest food we came across.

So after a single margarita (which was large and refreshing but set me back nearly $10, even during Happy Hour, something I didn't know when ordering because for some strange reason, as others have pointed out, prices aren't listed on the drink menu). \\n\\nI headed upstairs to the dining room after nursing my margarita, and right away got better service, and a much nicer atmosphere - painted murals, wood beam ceilings, music. A platter of chips and salsa were placed on the table before I'd even sat down, and they were good, the chips crispy and warm, and served with two types of salsa: a traditional red that was pretty spicy, and the aforementioned mushroom salsa, which sounds like a weird combination but is really quite good. \\n\\nI ordered pork carnitas, and the meat was just so-so. I make them at home in the crockpot, and my fiance declared mine to be better. I had to agree - but I wish theirs had been better. What's the point of paying to dine out if you can do a better job yourself? At least her shrimp fajitas received high marks. The shrimp was plump and tasty. Rice and beans were standard - acceptable but not spectacular. The guacamole was chunky, fresh, and very good. \\n\\nThe best part about the meal was the after-dinner mints. I'm not joking. They were your basic hard, round candy, but these were lime and coconut flavored and were so good we saved the wrapper in hopes of buying them somewhere ourselves. So far, we haven't been able to find them. \\n\\nOh, well. Between the mints and the mushroom salsa, we've got a great excuse to come back."},{"name":"IHOP","address":"2741 Clairmont Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2.5","text":"Waited 1 hour for my order after being asked to move to accompany a bigger party.

I do tend to sit outside in the common area of the student center with my burrito, as sitting in Anna's can feel a tad too hot after a while.\\n\\n99% of the time, I'm getting a large burrito with cheese, beef, salsa and guacamole. The salsa and guacamole are always fresh (you do have to pay a small premium for guacamole but the $7 price tag for a meal is a bargain anyway especially given its convenience, and they don't have unreasonable extra charges for toppings either). The beef isn't too tough, unlike the burritos you might find at other chains. The cheese adds to the overall texture of the burrito, and believe me when I say that the first bite is always one of the favorite parts of my day.

The mashed potatoes was a favorite between all of my friends and I. \\n\\nAs soon as my waiter noticed my dog, he brought out a big dog bowl of fresh water and ice.

Chef Billy and his crew are masters at seemingly everything - whether it's perfectly prepared fish, lighter than air gnocchi, or the complex, layered flavors in the vegetable-forward small plates, you will find yourself saying \\"wow, this is so good\\" over and over. The flavor combinations are unique and always spot on. We usually order a few of the ever-changing small plates & an entree.

Both of us ordered them medium rare, Du Val had a small Caesar on the side, in quest of a strong garlicky Caesar dressing, the server said it wasn't very garlicky, but Will plunged ahead in any case. Bold move, my friend.  The poutine was amply gravied, as I had asked the server to tell the chef to be generous with same. I guess he figured that being overly generous with gravy meant he could skimp on the curds, which were few and far between. I believe I had that same experience my first visit.\\n\\nThe burgers were prepared exactly as ordered, and while mine was supposed to be laden with both Gruyere and Gorgonzola, the latter wasn't present in a detecable amount. Du Val thought that the Cascade Beef patties were super grand, once he added a little bit of NaCl.

However the broth they were served in was aromatic, smelled strongly of herbs and fresh vegetables and bumped up the dish a couple notches.

The bartenders on this night, Brandon and Parris, were very young and inexperienced and did not know how to appropriately deal with guests. My boyfriend and I went there to get away from the typical college crowd, since it's more expensive than the dive bars, and we were treated as second class citizens. We are both young professionals and I, personally, am a bartender in dr Phillips, have been in the industry for years and am also a consultant for aPrivate security company that monitors and surveys bars/clubs/restaurants on their bar staff, so it takes a lot for me to complain. We were very disappointed when both bartenders took more than a generous few minutes to get out drink order. Even thought they weren't busy I didn't mind because I am in this industry as well And am very patient. When my boyfriend tried to ask questions about the menu and order, Brandon told,us to wait a few minutes because he had to make shots for another group of guests, and did so in a rude manor. He, at first, seemed friendly other than than that,  but his drinks were questionable and had to be corrected. Then at 1:49am, approximately 30 minutes after we arrived (we both work late) I asked for a \\"last call\\" drink and was informed last call was at 1:30, when we ordered our first round after waiting a while. When I brought up that I had been waiting to order but he was busy with other guests, I was told he didn't know I would have \\"such an attitude\\" in a veery rude manor and he reluctantly served me my 3rd drink, even though I said not to worry if it was going to be an issue. I am normally very patient and tip well over 20% knowing how hard I work for my own money, and I won't doubt that he is still a young kid who doesn't know any better, but someone definitely needs to,adjust his attitude because that rudeness will not fly with anything other than the college kids. I work and have worked in this industry for a long time so service has to b very, very poor for me to tip poorly, let alone make a complaint, but both of these bartenders attitudes need to be adjusted and fast."},{"name":"Asian Chao","address":"Hartsfield/Jackson International Airport","city":"Atlanta","stars":"1.5","text":"General Tso chicken ok.

If you want the Greek potatoes, I guess you have to specify those, or you just get regular fries.  We also ordered Moussaka and would not get it again.  Its taste was not up to the standards of the Gyro, and it was greasy.\\n   In the Atlanta area, I think the Gyro at the Falafel Cafe in Marietta is a match for Nick's, but its not as big.  They import the meat from a supplier in Chicago and its exceptionally good.

During bouts of vegetarianism I experimented - and fell in love - with hummus, falafel, tabouli, and the heavenly dessert that is baklava. One thing that stands out about the food at Marrakesh is the richness of the flavors I had come to associate with said dishes.\\n\\nThe falafel, in particular, stands out as superior to the standard fare in two key ways. First, it's more crispy on the outside, indicating freshness. Second, it's green on the inside. These guys don't skimp on the parsley.\\n\\nThe spanakopita (they call it spinach pie) also stands out, fresh and fluffy with quality feta and whole baby spinach leaves. The phyllo dough is light and flaky compared to the (and I hate to keep using this but for lack of a better term) standard fare.\\n\\nThe hummus is killer, if not a little salty, but the entrees are on-and-off depending on freshness. Good news is there's a laid back and honest waitstaff who will guide you in the right direction (and away from dishes that have been sitting out all day). Sit outside if you can, the view is great and there's always people to watch.\\n\\nIn the eyes of many reviewers, the service is the dealbreaker here. The staff is laid back to the fullest extent, but I can appreciate that. Marrakesh isn't the most heavily-trafficked Mediterranean joint in Austin, so I figure the downtime requires someone with this personality type. The best way to describe the service is that it's like your servers are your really close friends and you're eating over at their house. Maybe that's just how I justify it, but I say whatever helps me eat without getting offended.

I'm a little shocked at some of the poor reviews of this restaurant, and I think it's because they're doing something a little different...including showing you where meat comes from!  Different enough that we plan to go back with some regularity.    \\n\\nWARNING:  If all you're looking for is another *amazing-yet-cheap* cocktail experience during your party night out in the pearl, I recommend you keep moving along and grab snacks at Whole Foods as one reviewer recommended.   If you're looking to try an array of rare, freshly cut hams with a variety of esoteric wine styles well-matched to the salty/fatty goodness, by all means proceed and definitely ask the staff for guidance through the menu.\\n\\nThe decor of the place is understated and very lovely.  The lighting is dim and the paneling is dark, save for an amazing wall of Spanish tile along the south side of the room.  An impressive selection of bottles lines the northern wall, both liquor as well as various permutations of sherry and madeira.   But the highlight of the room are the two legs of ham, bone and hoof in, where the meat is cut to order so you know it's as fresh and lovely as can be.  Unfortunately many people are used to buying prosciutto pre-cut, which can often be dry and chewy, so I can't highlight the importance of a fresh slice to the enjoyment of the product. \\n\\nThe staff was amazing as well.  Each customer was warmly greeted as they came in, and all appeared professional and friendly.  We sat at the bar and the bartender helped us navigate the menu of traditional Spanish sherries and madeira.  This was a real highlight as most establishments don't serve more than one or two of these, and we got to take a guided tour through multiple bottles and really understand the different styles available from southern Spain.  To say the man was passionate was an understatement, and while we didn't try his mixed drinks, I'm sure they would be prepared with both knowledge and passion.  \\n\\nAs I said above, you should approach the menu by starting with the ham, and proceeding from there.  We were initially worried about the portion sizes (2 oz for machine cut, 1 oz for hand cut), but found a total of 3 oz the perfect snack amount for the two of us.   I recommend a variety of styles, as we did.    Traditional pairings are offered such as bread, biscuits, cheese, pickles, nuts, and warm olives (OMFG).  We were close enough to watch them slice our ham, and my wife was taken back to Spain where each restaurant has a dedicated ham carver.    The food came reasonably fast given the amount of labor involved, since each table's ham is cut to order.\\n\\nI can't comment on the mixed drinks as I prefer whiskey over wine in my cocktails.  That said, I spotted some lovely bottles such as Rittenhouse Rye, so don't be afraid to order a more traditional drink if that's what you're in the mood for.  Hopefully their mixed drink menu matures somewhat as they get a feel for the crowd.\\n\\nAs for pricing.  Yes, the wines are expensive.  Yes, the ham is expensive.  But do I think it out of proportion with the quality of the product or portion sizes?  No.   Also, cocktails are on par with the remainder of the Pearl.  I find that really annoying wherever I go, but it's probably the price of rent in this ridiculous real estate market.\\n\\nGo enjoy this for yourself.  I expect things to change and mature since the place has been open for less than three weeks, but I think they scored with the core concept."},{"name":"Deschutes Brewery Portland Public House","address":"210 NW 11th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"This place might be known for their beer, which is great, but their food was unbelievably delicious.

The first time we went in, they were completely empty, and they served me one of the best daals I've ever had.  Daal is my litmus test; like a cheese pie at a pizzeria, I really believe that if your daal sucks, so will everything else.  Other menu items were of the standard quality, but the daal was great.\\n\\nOn visit #2, the daal was drowning in oil and the rice was crunchy and dry.  And, for some reason, had a little bit of spinach on one edge.  Someone on another review site mentioned that they believe that India House reuses their rice, and I have to say, I think that's probably true.  Hm.  \\n\\nSomehow, I forced the memory of reused rice out of my mind and returned again for some of the awesome daal, and they delivered on it once again.  On visit #4, I got heartburn when I licked some of the daal spillage off my finger.  \\n\\nAs time went on, it became apparent that the quality of the food varies enormously.  And more often than not, it's not very good.  \\n\\nLike a crack addict, I had to go back, with the memory of their great daal, hoping that this time might be good.

There weren't any vegetarian entrees when we got there (their website shows 1), and there was only one fish entree.  Everything else had sausage, beef, etc.  Perhaps this isn't a big deal for most diners, but since the only \\"meat\\" my wife and eat is fish, it's something we like to be aware of ahead of time.\\n\\nI ended up eating their one fish dish and my wife had a couple of the vegetarian appetizers (cheese plate and a salad).  My halibut  was nicely cooked and the veggies it came with were fresh and tasty.  It was a subtle dish, but good.  We also had the Arancini appetizer which was good and the coconut cake.  The coconut cake came with ice cream which was very icy (i.e. not creamy). The cake itself was fresh but I'd probably try something else next time.\\n\\nWe'd definitely go back if we knew there was always a vegetarian and fish entree, but without that knowledge it's a bit of a crap shoot.

Again, most people probably won't have this concern but I'm making it known for the vegetarian/fish crowd.\\n\\nI probably would have given them 4 stars on food, but I was so irritated by the seating situation that I can only give them 3.  We got there at 6pm, with at least half of the tables empty.  We were told that all of the available tables (at least 8 or 9) were reserved so we had to sit at the bar.  A few other diners came in after us and similarly were forced to sit at the bar.  Like us, they all looked incredulously at a half-empty dining room as they took their bar seats.  We finished our dinner AND desert by about 6:45 and not a single one of those reserved tables were claimed.  Even worse, two or three of the previously occupied tables were now empty since those people had finished eating.  So, there were actually more free tables when we left than when we got there.  I guess it's remotely possible that all of those reservations were no-shows, but I highly doubt it.  Instead, I think they just block out the tables for an hour (maybe more?) before the next reservation.  The bar was ok, but when you're spending $70 on a meal for two (before tip), it would be nice if you're actually given the courtesy of sitting at an empty table.

Typically, there's a gas stove or some sort of heating device to continuously boil the broth (hence, \\"hot pot.\\") The dining experience is extremely social since it requires you to (1) gather around a single pot to cook your food and (2) wait while your food cooks. I remember stories from my father about hotpot in Shanghai when he growing up--it was the equivalent of a block party. The whole neighborhood would come out to cook from a single make-shift oil barrel stove, with a massive pot placed atop it. \\n\\nLittle Sheep is one restaurant of a larger chain of restaurants found all over the US and the world. This one is probably one of the less glamorous locations, but still good! It's ~$20 / person for all-you-can-eat. Not only does that include your standard types of thinly-sliced meat (beef, chicken, lamb, but no pork, sadly) and vegetables, but they have added cooked foods like dumplings and different types of pancakes (like green-onion pancake) that you also can order! Definitely, an added bonus. \\n\\nWhen you sit down, they will hand you a menu that you use to mark what you want. For whatever reason, you keep reusing that same piece of paper to demarcate your order, even if it's been scribbled on multiple times. There's a 2 hour limit, but that's plenty of time to get lots of food. The food gets brought out on these carts, which really helps in regards to table space. \\n\\nThere's a center sauce bar where you can mix your own dipping sauce. There are also a few deserts that you can try, such as coconut macaroons and a coconut sago. \\n\\nIf you order a soda, they are super on point when it comes to free refills.

The Veranda was one of these.  Liz C. and I ventured here for a girls' night out recently and found that the drinks were tasty and strong, but the food...not so much.\\n\\nWe ordered a smattering of appetizers (baba ganoush, chicken liver pate, smoked salmon & caviar, and fried artichoke hearts) and a Greek salad to share (yeah, we were hungry).  Three of the four appetizers were served on beds of limp, shredded iceberg lettuce with cold pita bread, and the Greek salad was mainly composed of iceberg, as well (they must go through a TON of iceberg here).  The small lump of pate was greyish and rather unappetizing looking and tasted like it had been served straight out of the fridge.  Come to think of it, pretty much everything we ate that night tasted like it had been served straight out of the fridge (or the bag, in the case of the pita bread), except for the fried artichoke hearts, which were just kind of boring. \\n\\nAlso, the service was kind of...weird.  Our server was reasonably attentive, but a little TOO friendly and casual given the fact that this is trying to be an upscale place.  At one point during our very first contact with him, he actually threw us what looked like a gang sign when we asked how he was doing.  He kept trying to chat us up when we were obviously in the middle of serious conversation.  And he gave us kind of a hard time when we asked for some more pita bread.  Hey, we can't help it if everything on your damn menu must be consumed using pita bread.\\n\\nI think Northcross Mall must be going through some kind of strange identity crisis.  As most of you probably know, they are hoping to bring in an \\"upscale\\" Walmart as their anchor tenant.  The Veranda is what I imagine an \\"upscale\\" Walmart to be like - an attempt to disguise cheaply-made goods by placing them in nicer-than-average surroundings.

Oh Burgerville, I want so badly to love you. Between your organic, local ingredients and NW sensibilities there's so much about your corporate culture that just demands excellence. Sadly, while your corporate buyers do a great job I fear it all goes to Hell at your locations.\\n\\nFirst, let's talk cost. Burgerville is a fast food chain, you order your food at the counter, they deliver within five minutes to your table. It's very \\"Carl's Jr.\\" And as such you'd think you'd be in the same ballpark as Burgerking, McDonalds, etc. It's not, expect to pay between $8 - $9 per meal. This price point could be excused because of the fresh, organic ingredients. So this puts it in league with Chipotle where the price points are similar. With that considered Burgerville is fairly priced.\\n\\nBut where Chpitole excels, at the grill, Burgerville just comes up short. Burgerville's patties are small, dry, and stiff. My bacon burger today was overcooked and hard as tack. The Bacon, while crispy, was also slightly burned. The vegetables were fresh but the lettuce was too large for the bun. Look at Five Guys which has a similar price point. The burgers are large, moist, and hot. I really fear that whoever is manning the grill at Burgerville presses the patties and squeezing the juice, and with it all the flavor, out of the patties. The smaller portion would be fine considering the supposed high quality of ingredients, but I think they are being ruined at the local level. For a place called \\"Burgerville\\" having kick#*^ burgers should be a requisite.\\n\\nThe service, too, is simply lacking for a restaurant at this price point. Providing friendly service is something restaurants can provide at zero cost. A smile and friendly banter cost a restaurant nothing and can increase sales, it's the single best return on investment the owner of any business can provide. And while McDonalds can get away with it, the \\"Good for the Earth\\" Burgerville just can't. You can't make a claim to helping the planet if you can't even upturn your own lips. The other location I've been too, Albany, has similar service issues. It's not awful but it's hardly the high level of service I get at Chipotle, Panera, or Five Guys.

As I was told by a local, \\"Deschutes is a classic\\" and one of the most well known. They have a very large space with open viewing windows into the brewing process. You can either seat yourself at the bar or get lucky and be seated in the dining area. With lots of wood themes and garland decor for the winter holidays, it makes for a warm, cozy atmosphere. I would highly recommend getting one of the brew flights if you haven't visited before. For $14.00, you get a taste of 6 different beers, whether thats their classic flight or their brewer's choice flight. The brewer's choice flight changes pretty frequently. As for food, I personally ordered the Dungeness crab roll (voted best crab sandwich in Oregon in 2017). It was amazing! The bread was toasted to perfection and easily torn apart to eat with the crab; it was filling without being heavy. The one negative I will say for Deschutes is that parking can be very difficult, and it's definitely on the pricier side."},{"name":"North By Northwest Restaurant & Brewery - Stonelake","address":"10010 Capital Of Tx Hwy N","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Followed others reviews and went with cedar salmon.

In fact, I usually avoid it altogether (this is actually my first post ever!). But I was greatly disappointed with this restaurant. I'm not sure if the rave reviews (which was the factor that impressed me to take the journey out to Atlanta to eat there) are fake or made biasly (new word) from friends/relatives, but it seems IMPOSSIBLE that this restaurant would garner such stellar remarks. I'm tired of being fooled. So here it goes. \\n\\nFirst, food was very much overpriced. Me & my mother both ordered the same thing: the country baked steak (we both ordered water). Total: $30+. Even for Atlanta--that's ridiculous. Nowhere on the menu did it signify that it would cost so much. (At this time you might be saying,\\"Why dear lovely Kristin, $30+ is not THAT crazy!\\" Keep reading beautiful readers. Keep reading.)\\n\\n2nd: I (being cheap) might not mind dishing out $30 dollars if the food was good. It wasn't. I couldn't even eat my food. Warning: Not Exaggerating!! It was disgusting. My mother, feeling bad & not wanting to make a scene, took a couple of bites & moved her food around the plate.  I've been a vegetarian for years-- & never have I ever had something this bad! It was shocking. Oh, & the food on my mother's plate was cold (like ice cold). We literally felt like vomiting after we left. We drove over to the Whole Foods market and got some food (see I don't mind dishing out money for food!) but our stomachs were so messed up, that we ended up not eating anything at all! \\n\\n3rd: the place looked unclean. We later looked online to see the restaurant ratings.  We probably should have done so first.

In less grandiloquent language, our eyes were getting tired of our computer screens and our butts of our chairs so we decided to take a break. \\n\\nOne of us had been to Oudom before so we decided to check it out since it was right around the corner. The location is open and bright with plenty of natural lighting. Our waiter, CJay (according to the receipt), was in rare form, cracking jokes and apologizing at our misfortune of having him as a waiter. He was going to be on shift all day so I guess he was making the most of it. \\n\\nLunch is served with small ginger salads, a standard for Thai restaurants. I thought it was refreshing and the dressing was sweet but not overly so. My only disappointment was that most of it settled on the bottom of the plate and didn't stick to the lettuce. \\n\\nI ordered the wonton soup with medium heat. Boy, was I glad I only did medium. It had a nice burn that left my lips tingling. The real star was the broth. It tasted homemade with a beautiful richness that seemed to indicate it had been simmering for hours. The wontons were equally tasty and tender not overly chewy. \\n\\nMy co-workers got pad dishes and one got the Beauty and the Beast roll. The roll was eloquent in presentation and my coworker said it was excellent. The roll menu seemed fairly priced for it being downtown and a sushi restaurant. You could get a California roll freshly made for $5.99. I'm not sure even Publix could match that. \\n\\nThe restaurant was not overly busy during the lunch hour. It could be because it is located in the opposite direction of the business center. My suspicion is that it may also do with the slowness of service. Though the staff was friendly, it took us an hour and a half to have lunch. With few people in the dining room, it should not have taken that long even if dishes are being made fresh. With it being downtown, in order to survive as a restaurant, the staff will have to adapt to faster service in order to attract those for whom time is money. \\n\\nAll that being said, our foray out of the office was a great success.

But ice cream is always welcome!\\n\\nMy friend -- a competitive eater -- and I arrived midday on a Saturday during Memorial Day weekend, when there basically was only a limited menu.\\n\\nThe ice cream flavor on my visit a couple weeks back was Gary's Spicy Peanut ice cream. Very creamy, with a strong peanut presence. A very slight kick for me on the back end, but people more sensitive to spice will probably feel it more than I did. I actually ended up adding some hot sauces to this. Hey, it still tasted good!\\n\\nThe 5-pound poutine challenge probably has at least 2-3 lbs. of fries (perhaps a bit more), with the rest of the weight comprised of gravy and cheese curds topping all that starch. No traditional white cheese curds here; it looked more like small blocks of cheddar cheese (perhaps it's Tillamook cheddar to help local businesses?). The dish is served on a butcher's block. Gotta love that presentation! My friend demolished the challenge in record time. The staff and I just marveled at awesome food gluttony.\\n\\nEven though I wasn't feeling 100%, I wanted to try my hand at this $25 poutine challenge anyway a couple months later (meaning last month). Needless to say, that was one colossal mistake. My friend joined me again for my \\"stupid panda\\" moment.\\n\\nWe arrived right around peak lunchtime on a Sunday, so it was fairly busy. We snagged a booth near the back right corner of the dinerant.\\n\\nFor the heck of it, we took the challenge on side by side. My friend showed why he's a pro and finished it AGAIN in a leisurely 14 minutes. I ate as fast as I could, and at least for the first few bites, it was pretty good. Not that it would have mattered in the long run, but the crispy fries (which I generally prefer) didn't help my cause to finish. For quantity challenges only, I wish the fries were softer.\\n\\nThe abundance of cheese cooled and hardened, and when it became clear I wasn't finishing, I just started avoiding it. Oh, and I am not eating that much gravy again. Totally messed up my insides afterward.\\n\\nI'd say probably half of the challenge (perhaps a bit less) was still on the butcher's block at the end, but I got a T-shirt anyway just for attempting it. It's a nice gesture. Normally when I hear about food challenges, you'd only get a shirt if you beat the challenge.\\n\\nThis is a hard one to rate, but in the interest of fairness, I'd eat that poutine again in much smaller amounts. It's probably just a question of when that would be. Feeling all poutine'd out, really.\\n\\nPretty good service, very friendly staff. It was a bit slow getting the poutine to us, but when you have to cook up all those fries, it naturally would take a while.

I invited my friend here for her birthday brunch today and the experience was largely \\"meh\\". \\n\\nThe way things ran, I figured the place had been open less than a month. And yet when I glanced at trusty Yelp reviews, I found that people have been leaving reviews as far back as August! So it baffles me as to why Dai Due does not take brunch reservations AND offers no wait area/seating while patient patrons are asked to wait 30+ minutes. There's a pseudo-patio area adjacent to the tiny parking lot near the restaurant entrance, but there is absolutely no furniture on it. I saw many patrons just sitting on the ground during the wait. In my book, that's not a way to treat your guests! \\n\\nAnother counter-intuitive aspect is that the main storefront is really for the butcher shop. If you want to check in at the hostess stand, you're expected to walk through the entire length of the restaurant and to the back door to speak to a hostess.

There's one seating area (a bench) that is located near the butcher shop and very far from the hostess stand. Guess where the hostess goes when she's calling people to their table? The back patio area with no seating. Yeah...still makes no sense to me.\\n\\nOur waitress was very sweet and kind and helpful in making menu recommendations. I was surprised that the restaurant doesn't offer decaf coffee at all and instead offered herbal tea. I had the wild chorizo breakfast sandwich and my friend had the Dai Due breakfast. The chorizo sandwich was very heavy on the bread and light on the filling. And the Dai Due breakfast was largely flavorless. Both dishes could have benefited from much more seasoning and flavor. Unfortunately though, both dishes tasted like health food without health food perks like low calories or low fat.\\n\\nWith the plethora of delicious dining options in town, I don't see myself coming back to Dai Due anytime soon."},{"name":"Buckstop","address":"833 Denman Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Great bar and beverage selection is what seems to stand out here. \\n  The venison burger, served cooked 'province rules', was \\"not outstanding\\" and \\"a slider at best\\".

Our group was seated in the back of the restaurant in front of a large window. The view wasn't spectacular...a dry creek bed...but at least it was a wooded area.\\nOur server Tara made the evening a real pleasure. She was really on the ball. She knew the menu and was very patient and accommodating with special requests. She kept drinks filled as soon as she saw an empty glass.\\nI started with a pomegranate basil Martini. It was different but tasty...keeping with the local produce theme.\\nThe menu isn't huge, but had a nice variety of Texas favorites. A plus is knowing that they use local farms produce in their kitchen. They have a gluten free menu and options for vegetarians. \\nWe started with Tom's house salad. The ingredients were simple but very fresh. The green goddess dressing had a nice zip to it.\\nBF and I both had the Ruby trout which came with rice and wilted spinach.  It was topped with an apple pecan relish, which gave a nice hint of sweetness and tart to the delicate fillet. Others in our group tried several different meat dishes and everyone gave a thumbs up to their meal. A few people had dessert. We didn't try these, which included a peach cobbler and chocolate bomb, but they looked delicious.\\nTara was very kind to do separate checks for everyone at the table.

The salt on the rim provides a nice balance to the strong, but not overpowering, beverage itself.

The roti canai remains one of my favorite things on the menu (buttery bread and a slightly spicy dipping sauce) - always order it with the extra piece. The summer rolls were the best summer rolls I've ever had, though admittedly I'm relatively new to Vietnamese food. Basil fried rice was great. Pan fried potstickers weren't worth ordering when there are so many better things to choose. I liked the roast duck better than the crispy roast pork. Hawkers delight is delicious. Don't bother with the chicken skewers. Stir fry udon is quite good. The curry mashed potatoes are tasty, but are a sort of random menu item and also a large amount of potatoes. Beef lettuce wraps were enjoyable, too. I had some oolong iced tea that was mostly indistinguishable from regular unsweetened tea. I've had the Vietnamese coffee on a previous trip and liked it. We ordered some other things as well, but there was so much food on the table that I didn't try everything; it was too overwhelming. This really is a fantastic place to go with friends who are willing to be adventurous and share and swap dishes.

I definitely recommend a family style meal so you can order as many dishes as possible. \\n\\nOn top of that, our service was top notch. The waiter was very patient with us as we struggled to choose a wine. He offered tastes of as many bottles as he could and worked with us until we found \\"the one\\". He also rolled out the dishes at a perfect pace, obviously keeping a close eye on our table to make sure we were served at just the right time. I wish I'd gotten his name.

Who wouldn't give this place five sta ... whoa, WTF? Wait, someone didn't give this five stars?! \\n\\nI drove past this place for years without knowing it was open; it's near literally a hole in the wall. Once I tried it, I was hooked. The gyros are awesome (including chicken) and the Greek potatoes are stellar as well, as are the daily specials. Oh yeah, get feta on your gyro.\\n\\nTo address the reviews about Nick's personality, I guess you're right. As a regular, you know he can be a bit cranky, but then he'll shoot you a disarming wink or smile to let you know he's in on the 'joke.' And you're right, the dude does not like you using a CC when the order is less than $10. And if you come in to order right as they close, he will mutter something to you. But his wife makes up for it and is remarkably nice, even if I only understand every third word through her accent.\\n\\nBut more importantly, the food is awesome and the kitchen stays clean, despite being a dive. As long as you keep your expectations in line and know you're getting an awesome, divey gyro from a surly Greek dude, I'm not sure how you wouldn't give this place five stars.\\n\\nUpdate after reading more reviews: For first timers or anyone else, call ahead and use cash and Nick will love you. My wife and I have always used CCs at Nicks and he might ask us if we have cash, but otherwise has never been an ass to us. Just a few comments about how everyone uses CCs and he makes more money off cash. \\n\\nAlso, Nicks is as good as any gyro spot I've ever been, but as you know as a gyro connoisseur, there can be a bit of variance from gyro to gyro. Nicks is a bulkier gyro, with thicket cuts of meat and a thinner tzatziki with small cucumber strings. Having had great gyros in many countries, Nicks is the best thing in Atlanta and up there with any best I've had."},{"name":"Banger's Sausage House & Beer Garden","address":"79 81 & 81.5 Rainey St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"The beer selection can't be beat, the service is excellent - knowledgable and helpful and fast and fun.

One of my friends asked if we could get some glasses for the water carafe that had been sitting there before we even sat down.  He scoffed and then came back and put the glasses down.  He asked what we wanted, but we only had the one menu and only one person had a very short time to look at it at this point  I asked for coffee while everyone else was trying to decide on beer or cocktails.

Well, the nachos have been stripped down to a third of their size, but still cost over $10.  It's a rip.  Also, while they do have a large beer selection, the day we went they were out of three drafts that were both on their beer menu (on paper) and chalkboard menu, so that was disappointing.  Our server provided good service, maybe a little slower but she was the only one on the floor that Sunday.  Honestly, it will be a while before I go back."},{"name":"Texas Chili Parlor","address":"1409 Lavaca St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"The Texas Chili Parlor has good chili which is more like cubes of pot roast or chunks of meat in a nice sauce and seems much better than the typical ground meat style you find elsewhere.

I ALWAYS order from Il Mondo even though the delivery takes longer, because it's great pizza. I'm probably not going to order from there after they insult me via a delivery driver because my tip isn't appropriate. I'm not the one who started the social institution of paying people who get tipped nothing. Pay them a fair wage, and if gas is expensive raise the price of the pizza.

I ordered the bacon and scrambled egg sandwich, and it was 95% delicious.  The other 5% I'll get to in a minute.  The scrambled eggs with cheese..man, those were like, the most perfect scrambled eggs I've ever had; I strive every weekend at home to scramble eggs right and sadly don't come close enough.  The bacon is thick-cut and is cooked the exact way I like it: meaty and not burnt-crispy, but not a greasy mass of white fat either.  Coffee selection was excellent too.  \\n\\nI didn't want to Yelp about it or tell co-workers or anything because I'd rather the place stay relatively quiet (that's totally selfish of me, I know.) If it's one thing I hate, it's a long line.  This is why I never go to the Highland Bakery, the only other high quality restaurant nearby, during lunch hour.  I can't deal with the line in a tiny space.  That was another reason for not saying anything about Joy Cafe; I'd feel like I was cheating on HB, since I go there for coffee and snacks all the time and they know me, and didn't really want them to lose any business.  \\n\\nBut, it's too late.  Word got out, apparently, because the next few times I went back to the Joy Cafe, they were packed.  Lunch time especially, and even more so when there are film crews in the area, making the next Marvel nonsense movie.  I'd still wait patiently until I learned to order online, which works great.  Best thing to get for lunch on a cold wintery Atlanta depressing workday is the Grilled Cheese with Avocado and a tomato soup.  So soothing, it makes the rest of the day better.  Their chicken and feta burger is also good.  \\n\\nBack to that 5%.  What I didn't care for, in the breakfast sandwich, is that they put it on a  'brioche' bun (seems like standard hamburger buns they buy at Kroger).  These people are chefs and super cooks, would it kill them to use an actual biscuit, the one southern food item that seems to be disappearing in Atlanta?  \\n\\nOn a Saturday, however, I had to be in the area, and decided to come in to Joy Cafe, when they have an actual brunch menu.  I wasn't but maybe vaguely aware they served brunch on weekends, I thought it would be a more chill and quiet place, but no, it turned out to be bustling and happening.  Again, with all the new residents.  It turns out that they totally have biscuits during brunch, too.  There were no empty tables, but since I was alone, I didn't mind sitting at the bar.  I order the sundried tomato, feta and spinach omelette with a biscuit and hash browns, and let me tell you, I wouldn't need to eat for the rest of the day.  The omelette is huge, and beautiful.  They fill it with plenty of spinach and full-sized sundried tomatoes.  The biscuits, I reckon, are homemade and they're also gigantic.  Not flat and round like a cat's head, but giant, fluffy, buttery square biscuits.  I did not need to jam them.  I was stuffed.\\n\\nMost of the time, they're packed and the waitstaff are super busy, but they're still very friendly.  I came in for brunch at around 10; getting a bar seat is easy.  Didn't take long for the food to come out.  At weekday lunch, if you order ten minutes ahead of time, it's usually ready to pick up.  If you go in and order to go, be prepared to wait.  But it's worth it.  Thank you, Joy Cafe..

Everything is set up to create the impression of fine dining without actually effecting it. I'll start by mentioning the strangest thing about Ruth's Chris: they run your credit card *at your table*. They make you operate the reading machine yourself. The waiter stands over you, teaching you how to work it and how to enter the tip amount.\\n\\nIt sounds like a joke, but it's true, and it's scummy as heck because it puts pressure on you. If the service was terrible and you want to leave a low tip, you'll avoid it to avoid conflict with the waiter standing literally over your shoulder. Even if you had good service, the waiter standing over you makes you feel like you need to move quickly. You don't feel like you have the time to do the mental math for the tip, and when you pause to think, the waiter will \\"helpfully\\" point to the suggested tip amounts on the bottom of the receipt - which start at 18% instead of the conventional 15%. It's a highly manipulative tactic.\\n\\nEven putting the manipulation aside, there's no reason for this policy. Why am I being asked to operate a credit card terminal when I'm out having a nice evening on the town? That job, like the jobs of cooking my food and bringing it to me, should be handled by the staff.\\n\\nMy fiancee and I ordered the same cut of steak to the same temperature (medium rare), but in different sizes. It's obvious that they cooked our two steaks for the same amount of time. Hence, the big steak came out closer to rare, and the smaller steak came out closer to medium. The steaks had some gristle, and were not tastefully seasoned or prepared. I have had significantly better steaks at half the price they ask for here (about 45 bucks for a 12oz).\\n\\nThe plates and silverware our food was served on had seen better days. They make a big deal of serving the steaks on 500 degree plates, but they don't tell you that those plates will be covered in nasty brown spots and streaks where the juices from previous diners' steaks has penetrated into the ceramic and gotten baked in. Gross. The silverware was cheap and chintzy - you'd expect a steak place to have high-quality authoritative-feeling steak knives.\\n\\nThe sweet potato casserole was coated in a thick layer of brown sugar on top, but the sugar was still granular. They must have added a bunch of sugar on top *after* it came out of the oven, so it wasn't caramelized. No one wants to bite into a big cluster of granulated sugar. The mashed potatoes were visibly oily and tasted like they were straight out of a box - which isn't a knock on boxed mashed potatoes, I just expect more when I'm paying this much. \\n\\nThe desserts were inedible. Our cheesecake tasted like it had bathroom cleaning chemicals in it, and the syrup on top tasted like it had gone sour and rancid. The chocolate mousse was tasteless, though inoffensive.\\n\\nThe atmosphere leaves a lot to be desired. It looks like a fancy place at first glance - there's even a sign at the front that says \\"Proper Attire Required\\". However, most of the people inside are wearing t-shirts. I even saw a man in camo cargo shorts. \\n\\nThe restaurant is large, and when we came in, it was mostly empty. I was disappointed that when we were seated, we were brought over to the *one* corner in the whole place that already had parties seated. The staff continued to seat new parties near us, leaving most of the restaurant empty except our corner. When you have so much space available, you might as well use it to give diners some privacy.\\n\\nThe drink menu doesn't come on a menu, it comes on an iPad. The iPad and its stand are clunky and large and far less practical than a conventional drink menu. It's a gimmick, and a poorly executed one at that.\\n\\nTo sum up: the prices and the decor make Ruth's Chris seem like luxurious dining, but the food and the service and the fellow diners and the iPads and customer-operated credit card readers all shatter the veneer. There is no reason to go here. If you want good meat and fine dining at this price point, there are other places in this area that will give you a wonderfully unforgettable experience and cost about the same or less."},{"name":"Banger's Sausage House & Beer Garden","address":"79 81 & 81.5 Rainey St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"The SUNDAY BRUNCH here is amazing.

Tiger is my fave but there's a lot to explore on here! Our server was not familiar with most of them, so I might ask for recs at the bar next time.\\n\\nMost of the plates are tapas sized with some larger noodle and soup dishes also available. We opted to go with tapas and started out with the roti canai raved about by so many on here. Definitely order the extra roti to go with the curry dipping sauce, which is SO flavorful and good. Next up were the steamed dumplings, warm pockets of pork-filled goodness, and the hot iron mussels, off the Hawkers' Originals section of the menu, which were seasoned with garlic and fresh basil - I'd recommend these too. Our final item to arrive was our order of ten wings: half Szechuan, half thai chili. You can choose to get your wings 'naked' or breaded and with sauce either on top or on the side. Both sauces we chose were billed as 'hot' but the Szechuan definitely was not. It tasted more like a BBQ sauce. The thai chili was more on point. We were glad we got the sauce on the side bc we mostly stuck with that one. I'd probably order the wings again, but would order a few diff sauces in search of something hotter.\\n\\nOverall, it was a really good value, I think - the check was around $30 before tip. Will definitely be back to try the prawn mee, roast duck and summer rolls, all of which I was eyeing on the table next to me on this trip..."},{"name":"G. Michael's Bistro & Bar","address":"595 S 3rd St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"Stopped here for restaurant week and I will be back again....and again..\\nI started out with the steamed muscles in a white truffle and sweet corn base. Muscles were on point each falling out of their shell effortlessly and not a single one had reached that chewy over steamed texture. Next up was the broiled pork loin. Deeeeeelish the bbq sauce they use as garnish was so savory and paired perfectly with the corn bread that came with it. Finally I enjoyed a vanilla tart which was the weakest portion of the meal but coming from someone who really isn't a desert lover, this still wasn't all that bad."},{"name":"Gourmands Neighborhood Pub","address":"2316 Webberville Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"My first trip to Gourmands was for their Beerlympics.  I had absolutely no idea what to expect, a friend of mine who lives close to Gourmands suggested we form a team.  I'm always down for dive bars and drinking games that include a LOT of beer so I thought what a great way to spend a Saturday.  Did I mention I love sandwhiches like in a really insane, could eat them every night kinda way?  It was like Gourmands was my idea of heaven.\\n\\nThe staff was super friendly and I thought they had a good selection of drinks.  The food was amazing, my friend is still raving about his Godfather sandwhich.  I heard some of the jukebox (which was good) but would like to go back to explore a little more.  The team we played sounded like they were regulars and couldn't say enough good things about the place.  If they are the type of patrons Gourmond's gets, I'm in because they were fun, funny and nice.  I participated in the foosball event, but they had darts, pool etc.  All in all, my whole team of newbies was ready to make Gourmands a more frequent destination, with or without drinking games."},{"name":"Wise Guys","address":"172 Brighton Ave","city":"Allston","stars":"4","text":"At first, I have to be honest: I thought Wise Guys was going to be some Disneyland attraction the way it was decorated.  But I decided to stop by anyway.  I must say, the waiting experience is pretty sweet when the eatery puts on Goodfella's.  I ordered chicken, salad, and side spaghetti.  It was remarkable.  The quality of food was, without exaggeration, on par with an actual Italian restaurant.  The owners are really friendly too.   Definitely check this place out, hope it sticks around the block for a while."},{"name":"Sizzler","address":"3737 SE 82nd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"2.5","text":"Right off the bat, I knew my experience would be world class when the guy behind the counter \\"What are you doing here?\\". I assured him that I had no idea this place survived the 90s and I was here to prove all of the negative Yelp reviews wrong. I decided to order the fried shrimp and a Budweiser. I was given a Bud Lite by mistake and the problem was immediately rectified when the employee closed the bud lite bottle back up and placed it back in the fridge. I then had the choice of taking any table that I wanted for myself. Me and my dining party decided to sit in the back corner of the restaurant so we could observe all of the geriatric couples slurp down their salad bar choices through their gums. My party and I sat down and enjoyed the views while we waited for our food to arrive. When three of the four of us received our food, only one of the entrees had a giant hair in it. As we all dug into our plates, we were delighted to find that the mushrooms tasted like they were cooked in lighter fluid. The steak might have actually been a rubber dog toy. The fourth member of my party decided to sit quietly, hoping that his food would show up, until we noticed a man come out of the kitchen with no shirt on. At this time we finally asked where his food was and the waitress apologized for leaving it on top of the garbage can by the coffee machine. We all finished our food and despite all considered suicide it was exactly the experience that we expected. Cheese toast was off the chain though!"},{"name":"Togo Sushi","address":"3380 Shrum Lane","city":"Vancouver","stars":"2","text":"You usually find this chain in food courts where expectations are low. This location sets the bar lower. Came by with a few friends and got some of the sushi specials listed on their board. Not inexpensive. Definitely poor value. Lots of rice, not much else. Fish was cut thin and tasted a bit old. Keeping fingers crossed we don't get food poisoned. Staff not very friendly, don't come here for service or quality."},{"name":"Hai Ky","address":"3736 Bee Caves Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"So this caps off my trifecta of Hai Ky reviews. And, as is indicated by the respective ratings, this is my least favorite location. The food is still solid, I mean, it's the same stuff, so absolutely no complaints there. But I am really, really irked by the price discrimination here. It's in Westlake, so, for those of you unfamiliar with the Austin Caste system, it's a big money hood, and it seems Hai Ky is familiar with that. So even though I'm not a westlaker and have to worry about the price hike in that part of town, the times I have been able to go, I feel cheated, because I'm having the exact same thing for at least a dollar more compared to other locations. However, I suppose I understand, as from a business perspective it's the logical thing to do. The restaurant itself is nice and clean, intimate lighting in the evening, with rotating art and photography pieces on the wall. It loses some of it's quirk by trying to compete in Westlake, but I respect Hai Ky for branching out and wish the best for them of course."},{"name":"Joy Cafe","address":"1100 Peachtree St NE, Ste 110","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"As tourists we were looking on Yelp for restaurants close to the hotel and we are sooo glad we came here- it's the best breakfast and brunch place we have ever been. They truly live up to their motto that if it can be made from scratch it will be but also the service is over the top. The owners check with every table to see if its alright and even gave my little boy dessert. He said it was the best burger (chicken) that he ever tasted. We loved the high quality food, delicious tastes, and fantastic service. The tables turn over quickly, which is good because they are all full! No wonder, the food is really food. We will be back on our next trip to Atlanta."},{"name":"Fellini's Pizza","address":"4429 Roswell Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Will never go back! The dough wasnt fresh and it was very clear that it had been sitting for to long. The toppings fell right off. This by FAR was the worst pizza I have ever had. If your not going to keep it fresh like it is during the day then please close at night. I have had there pizza during the day and it was great. With that being said stay away from this place at night."},{"name":"Burgerville","address":"15650 SW Upper Boones Ferry Rd","city":"Lake Oswego","stars":"3","text":"Every time I log into Yelp I am motivated to write a review!\\n\\nToday I choose.....you, Burgerville!\\n\\nI am not sure where their locations are but I have only been to the ones in Oregon so my review will be limited to Oregon locations.\\n\\nWe're 2 Californians who enjoy Burgerville.
