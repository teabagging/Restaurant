Maybe not worth the $$ though.\\n\\nMy friends had traditional pad thai, crispy pad thai and pad se ew.

The last time we went there was about 5 years ago, when our entire $250 meal was comped because the service was so horrendous. \\n\\nNot much has changed.\\n\\nWe asked for a 6 pm reservation, and were told that they were full at 6. We took a reservation for 530. Traffic on 93 was HORRENDOUS and we ended up getting there around 6 anyway, and found the place practically empty.\\n\\nWhen my daughter and I walked into the restaurant, there was no one working at the desk. I waited for a while, and when no one came to the desk I just went in and tried to find my party. It wasn't hard, there wasn't anyone else there. Maybe it was because of the weather, it was absolutely pouring, and I feel like you would go there when the weather is nice so you can see the boats come and go. It was fine, though, when my daughter got edgy we went for a little walk in the rain on the dock and looked at the boats from a little pagoda. \\n\\nThe bread and hummus was excellent. It was the best part of the meal, hands down. We shared the mussels and the fried calamari for the app. The mussels were excellent, and the fried calamari was average.\\n\\nI ordered the scallops and risotto with asparagus. It came as the rest of our 6 person party was finishing their meal. I insisted they start eating when it became obvious that mine wasn't coming any time soon. I don't know if they forgot me, or what, but it was not what you would expect at a restaurant in this price range. We were at the Yard House earlier in the day, and when my sister's meal was 10 minutes late, they comped it and offered us something else in addition. This is basic hospitality.\\n\\nThe food tasted average once it arrived. The scallops were a little small, and nearly undercooked. I had eaten so much bread while I was waiting I only ended up eating half my entree and took the rest home. It was actually better reheated.\\n\\nMy sisters and parents all enjoyed their food, and agreed that it was better reheated. The view is amazing. The bathrooms (the back, side bathroom, you have to kind of go outside) is not as clean as it could be, and is not as nice as the rest of the restaurant. If someone is at the sink, you have to ask them to move to open the door.\\n\\nIf my dad wants to go back, I might suggest other places, but as long as I'm not paying, and as long as I'm in the mood for bread and hummus, it's OK."},{"name":"Antico Pizza","address":"1093 Hemphill Ave NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Good,  but did not live up to the hype.

A lot of good food is one thing, but if you have snooty hosts, inattentive servers or any kind of rudeness, it totally impacts the experience.

Shortly afterward our sides, meat, and plates hit the table and we dug in.\\n\\nBetween the four of us we polished off 6 plates of solid meat. I will say that my competitive eater friend single-handedly probably took down three of those plates which made it totally worth it. In reality it's a great value. For reference a brisket plate is $13.95 while the family style is only $19.95. The brisket plate comes with about 3/4lb of brisket so if you eat any more than that then you might as well just go big or go home and get the all you can eat. \\n\\nOverall it was a really satisfying experience. Our server was impressed with how much we ate and we all had a great time.

First time visit for me here. Good vibes from the start. A young dude greeted me behind a cafeteria style counter and I proceeded to order. This young dude turned out  to be the manager, L.J. He was enthusiastic about this being one of the best Pok√© chains in the area and after the awesome customer service I received and the fresh quality of the food I ate... YES, my little dude. I concur.\\n\\nYOUR ORDER, SIR? So pretty much like all Pok√© joints in the area, they start you off with your base: white rice, brown rice, or salad (I chose white rice). Then, 3 scoops of protein: tuna, salamon, and spicy tuna -- not sure the other protein options apart from the fish (I chose Salmon and I ordered an extra serving of protein, tuna at $6 extra, serving size 3 scoops). I asked if they can mix up the fish for you with sauce (I chose OG sauce - like a sweet soy, and A HEFTY serving if spicy mayo), green onions, furikake, and OG onions. Then you pick your toppings (look at the menu online). I chose pickled veggies, OG onions, seaweed salad, shredded krab (+$1), orange masago ($+1), avocado (+1), spicy mayo on top of that, then a hefty load of fried onions and fried garlic... with a side of diced green mango and, of course, more spicy mayo. 'I luh dat' spicy mayo. AND, I ordered a dole whip float for dessert... yeah, I balled out a bit today. It was purdee expensive.\\n\\nDIGGING IN. I was ready to eat this ginormous amount of food. Everything I expected. The taste was fresh, lightly salted, citrusy, spicy, sour, acidic, sweet, crunchy, savory, and decadent. Good stuff. I tore up the whole bowl, quiet, and muching down this bowl.\\n\\nDESSERT. After having such an explosive amount of taste from that bowl. The dole whip was a good break from the flavor madness. Eventually, halfway through, the sweet, sour, and tart flavor of the pineapple took over and I was throwing in the towl, full as hell.\\n\\nOVERALL. A good chain, but I hope to find a more authentic Hawaiian restaurant in Central Florida.

The Elevator is \\"rickety\\" as someone stated earlier but, it adds to the age of the building and there are always the stairs if you'd rather.  Zeuses. What can I say? Ask what the Chefs pizza of the day is. You can't go wrong there. We did miss the cinnamon roll they have there but, we had so many great meals that we just couldn't fit anything else in.  The shared hot tub is HUGE and even on our last night there, after a Lindsey Sterling concert at the Crystal Ball, There were four separate groups of people... with LOTS of room to spare!

After I got back from my trip, I decided I was going to give myself a chance to cool off before I wrote this. Well, here we are, a week later and I'm just as angry. \\n\\nSo, we check in. So far, so good. It's a very nice looking hotel. The lobby and bar is very nice, and it has nice decor. I had asked for an upgrade, but was told they had absolutely no upgraded rooms. Seeing as how this was a normal, non-busy weekend, I thought it was odd, but whatever. We get to our room. Also very nice. It was cozy and had a great at-home feel, as well as a balcony, which is a big plus. I loved having the in-room bar, even if the drinks were ridiculously priced. I know how it goes, so I wasn't surprised. $5.50 for a beer. Eh, whatever. It's vacation! The real problems started with room service. We decided to get a couple glasses of wine. Called down. $26 for 2 glasses with the service charge and other \\"fees\\". It took about 20min for them to bring up the wine. We went out to eat and came right back after. So, no complaints in this time period lol! The bed is super comfortable and I slept like a baby.\\n\\nOur problems were mostly the next day. First off, the shower drain is pathetic! I was standing in 3 inches of water throughout my entire shower. My girlfriend had warned me, but I didn't expect it to be this bad. We were there for a wedding. So, after my shower, I took out my button up and started to iron it. I put water into the iron to steam the shirt. Upon first press of the steam button, water just pours out of every hole and soaks my shirt. Great. We called the front desk and they assured us they'd have one brought up. 20 minutes later, no iron. We call back to say that it is urgent as the wedding will be starting soon. They again tell us that it will be up shortly. 15 minutes later, I realize that was a lie AGAIN. We called another department. They tell us that the request has to go through housekeeping and that EVERY SINGLE MAID is on lunch break. In hospitality, everyone DOES NOT get the same lunch break. After getting rather rude, they brought one up. It took nearly AN HOUR. And that's after we told them we were on a time crunch. I put water in the iron again, and start steaming. It works for a while and then does the same exact thing- water just pours out of it! Luckily, my girlfriend had a blowdryer. We dried it off and said screw it. We ended up barely making it to the wedding because of these clowns. \\n\\nI paid almost $200 for the room.

It has a nice sauce, good chew to the dough, and can be picked up by the slice.

Of course like any legitimate establishment serving subs in the Boston area, you must say yes when they ask you if you want \\"hots\\" on your sub. If you are unfamiliar, it is a pepper chili relish of sorts and is amazing. Compliments tons of things.\\n\\nIn addition, the regular style pizza is also awesome, though I do have less experience with it.

At Nakato, you can trade a night out in Atlanta for an experience like you would likely find by the seaside of Japan. Executive Sushi Chef Kaki is a third-generation sushi master, and everything he concocted behind the sushi bar looked absolutely amazing, having us repeatedly asking, \\"What was that??? We'll take one!\\"\\n\\nBesides ultra fresh fish sourced from Japan, Nakato offers the ultimate in service. This was our first time, but we were treated like longtime regulars. Everyone walking by seemed to be aware of any of our needs, and I can think of at least five different employees who tended to us (at the sushi bar, no less.) Many thanks to Sachi for great recommendations on sake and menu selections. \\n\\nMake sure you walk around this place....because it has it all, from a Japanese garden outside, to private tatami-matted rooms tended by kind servers in kimonos, to hibachi tables. This place is coming up on 40 years in business in Atlanta, which should tell you all you need to know when you are looking for the comfort, tradition and service associated with real Japanese restaurants. Seeing seasoned professionals whose working lives have been dedicated to slicing precious fish is a rarity in Atlanta, where the majority of sushi bars don't even employ Japanese nationals.\\n\\nAnother impressive quality we noticed at Nakato: VALUE. The prices do not gouge you because you are dining in luxurious surroundings. An amazing portion of abalone for under $8 is a great example, and most of the simpler sushi rolls are similarly priced. \\n\\nOne thing I've always loved is the Japanese version of flan. At Nakato, we opted for the green tea cr√®me brulee, and there is no more perfect way to finish your exotic night out. \\n\\nA few other notes: Kaki-san recommended dining on Thursdays, to avoid the weekend masses, and to get a firsthand look at what he picked up from the Tokyo Fish Market.

My favorite from here is the New Yorker.  Its a hefty sandwich that will fill you up eating only half.  The prices are decent but can be a little steep if you add anything on.

Their menu specializes in cuban food and a lot of seafood.  The food was definitely not fresh.  I ordered the paella, and its prob one of the worst ive had.  It was overcooked rice, very mushy.

I always get the drunken goat, Macao (love the rosemary), jamon serrano, and jamon mangallca. The only thing I can say about this is that I wish they would get duck breast prosciutto for my friends who do not eat pork - my mother and I went to a DC location and they had it there! \\nFor the rest of the tapas? Honestly, you can't go wrong with ANY of them! I do have a couple favorites though - patatas bravas are ALWAYS a must at any Spanish tapas place, but Barcelona puts a little creamy spin on their's that is to die for (suggestion: save your plate to dip your bread in there!), spiced beef empanadas, squid ink fideos, HANGER STEAK (that truffle sauce? Oh my word), Grilled Pulpo, albondigas, chorizo and fig, honey whipped cheese, anchovies, duck egg migas, and the swordfish. Remember that these are small plates so if you're going with one or two other people, you may still even be hungry after ordering all of that! As for drinks - I'm a huge fan of the Guns n Roses - it's a little spin on an orangey rose, and I also get a pitcher of white sangria whenever I'm with friends. Last time I went here, I got the wine flight - you get 3 half glasses.\\n\\nAlso for other tips - TRY THEIR BRUNCH! They have a full on bloody marry and mimosa bar - I wish they would do a bottomless option, however last time when my friend and I expressed this opinion to the manager, he gave us a bottle of champagne for a good deal since it was my birthday - for the bloody mary bar sometimes they have cured meats and anchovies, but most of the time it's your classic pickled veggies, carrots, celery, etc. For the mimosas, they have other juices and syrups like raspberry and pomegranate! They also have bitters - so much stuff to spice up your drink!

We came on memorial day weekend, and they were doing specials like a foot-long hot dog and kabobs that were plays on traditional BBQ fare. The menu looked excellent, but we wound up going with the traditional brunch menu.\\n\\nI have no dietary restrictions, but my boyfriend has celiac and a dairy allergy. As you can imagine, that makes going out to eat rather difficult at times. Our server, Maliyah, was wonderfully sweet and did everything she could to help accommodate. She made multiple trips from the table to the kitchen, and made a ton of suggestions to help make sure we had a good experience. She was absolutely lovely, and we appreciated her patience and the willingness on both her and the chef's parts to provide us with exceptional service and a really great meal.\\n\\nTHE DRINKS: I can't remember the name precisely, but I got a peach martini that was delicious. Not too sweet, and not too strong. He got a \\"pickleback\\" bloody Mary that was awesome. I don't usually like bloody Marys because of the texture but the pickle juice thinned it out enough that I really enjoyed it. I also got a black coffee and was quite pleased with it.\\n\\nTHE ATMOSPHERE: Beautiful. Many different styles of art adorn the walls, windows, and hang from the ceilings. When you walk in the threshold and space around the bar is gigantic, tall, and airy. We were taken to the side to a dining room, which was still open and bright but slightly cozier than the entry way. Throughout our meal they were playing an ongoing soundtrack of 90's hip-hop, which set a great mood. \\n\\nTHE FOOD: Especially given my boyfriend's allergies, we were very impressed with what we received. I got the brioche French toast, and I'm not usually a sweet breakfast sort of person but this absolutely melted in my mouth. Not crazy sweet, but buttery and airy. \\nWe split the linguica sausage, which was a little spicy and delicious. They left off the sauce that they normally serve for us. We also got a side of bacon which was exactly what we wanted: crispy and tasty.\\nWe ended up going off menu for his dish, and I was already incredibly pleased that the chef offered to make something off menu in the first place. He received steak and eggs, a traditional dish but the steak was absolutely mind-blowing and the eggs were fluffy and creamy, surprising given that there was no dairy involved.\\n\\nTowards the end our server brought us a bowl of berries compliments of the chef. So sweet and kind, what a great gesture!\\n\\nSo why am I not giving this restaurant 5 stars?\\n\\nI didn't appreciate the interactions we had with the woman who was ostensibly the manager. When we walked in we were about 15 minutes early for our reservation, but surprisingly the restaurant was nearly empty. She was very short and huffy with us asking if we wanted to get drinks at the bar before being seated, but I asked if it was okay if we could just order a the table if it was ready. She wasn't very kind to the host when she told her to seat us.\\n\\nLater on I went to find the restroom, I asked the host where it was and she gave me directions. I'm injured and have a very pronounced limp, so I do have a hard time walking around but it seems in this moment the manager made a lot of assumptions. I was going where I was told when she came running up behind me to ask if I was looking for the restroom. I was at the top of the stairs leading down to where the restrooms are when I said yes and she told me to just keep going. I think she thought I was going to wander into the service station or the kitchen.\\n\\nThese things aside she spent much of our time there stomping huffily around the nearly-empty dining room staring at her phone. I'm not sure if she was just having a bad day or what but it was awfully distracting.\\n\\nTL;DR: Wonderful server, amazing food, great atmosphere, accommodating to allergies, but a manager with a sour attitude who seems to spread it."},{"name":"Jimmy Hula's","address":"11556 University Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"This Jimmy Hula's is very close to the UCF campus so I used to come here often when I lived on campus  a little over a year ago.

I also ordered mojo fries to share with my fianc√©. \\n\\n-Burnt Reynolds- It's a burger with an egg, bacon, American cheese, ketchup, and chips on it. The burger was really tasty, my fianc√© ordered the same thing and he loved his. There is just something about a burger with an egg on it that is amazing. The party was cooked perfectly and the bacon was nice and crispy (but not burnt). \\n\\n-Mojo Fries- These are usually my favorite but the last couple of times I came here about a year ago they were overly salty and they were too salty on this visit as well.

Little Bangkok has redeemed the Thai cuisine world for me, and now I even have an occasional craving for it.  Thanks Little Bangkok for making a believer out of me.\\n\\nJust a couple of things you should know about this place:\\n1.  Not great for large parties since it is a small place.\\n2.  Not great for large parties since the parking lot is tiny.  But this issue isn't as bad because there is a parking lot in the building directly next to it that you can use after 6 PM.

Going so far as to import each ingredient from Napoli and Campania, ordering at Antico entails a long line at the counter followed by a simple decision of pizza or calzone plus a handful of toppings and then fighting for a seat in either the small area adjacent the counter or the larger dining hall juxtaposing the pizzaiolos, ovens, and flour room - the later unbearably hot on our August visit and both rooms completely full leaving me to stand as the ladies procured three stools and an approximately 8' x 8' space in which to dine.  Quick to serve, the pizzas emerging from the 900 degree oven in approximately 60 seconds on a baking sheet, the question of whether all of the above is worth the hassle is a definitive yes as the pizza itself is impeccable with the hand kneaded dough supple yet crunchy and rife with smoke, the Mozzarella di Bufala slightly tangy, and the hand-crushed San Marzano tomatoes touched with only olive oil and basil allowing their fragrance and acidity to ride high on the palate - simple, focused, and perfect."},{"name":"Pambiche","address":"2811 NE Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Colorful, fun atmosphere.

Upside: The food is great, I ordered the managers special which is the southern breakfast: eggs, turkey bacon/chicken sausage, potatoes, with a half side of French toast. Everything was seasoned well! Potatoes are actually good which most restaurants skimp on! Makes such a difference and the French toast was yummy. I waited a while for food but the fact that it was good raised the stars a little for me. Kitchen staff faced some challenges but maintained positive attitudes the entire time, which was good. Waiter was apologetic and nice. \\nDownside: Service was pretty slow. We walked in and sat ourselves but had to wait for our table to be cleaned and menus. Things seemed a little disorganized in the kitchen and it didn't seem that busy. For example, we got our food at separate times and people that came in after us received food before us. Makes an already hungry person upset. But this may have just been a one time occurrence so I won't permanently judge them because of one bad day (+ the food was good :). Also when you arrive parking is a bit of a hassle, we drove around twice but found a spot on a side street. Get there early if you can. \\n\\nOverall, I'd come back.

It would probably become my favorite hangout.  I mean, classical music, delicious pastries, and fantastic coffee drinks?  Totally my thing.\\n\\nMy visit, I tried a Napoleon and iced coffee drink...the Minuet I think....  Whatever the case, the Napoleon was very sweet but delicious, thick and creamy.  I would recommend getting a knife to cut through the pastry, just to avoid making a mess, but it is worth the calories.  I also really liked the coffee drink, which managed to be sweet and flavorful, but not at all cloying. \\nI also can vouche for the chocolate croissant, which I took to go.  Very rich and super flaky. \\n\\nOf course, deciding on these items was very difficult, given the range of pastries, cookies, and cakes that are offered.  They all looked absolutely delicious.  There are also some adorable petit fours that were most tempting.  \\nI also hope to get here with a friend at some point for the afternoon tea.  I saw some people with it, and it looks deliciously adorable. \\n\\nPrices are not bad for what you get... about average for a coffee shop with the drinks, and equal or less than the prices for dessert at most restaurants for the sweets.\\n\\nThe only thing I had a little trouble with was the size of the place.  Parking is not as bad as I feared as there is a private lot, but it can get full pretty quick by the look of things.  The cafe area of restaurant itself is also very tight, especially if you have taken a corner seat as I had, requiring the lady next to me to move when I had to get out at one point.  Since the place is popular, it invariably will be crowded, at least on the weekend.  Still, the atmosphere itself is very nice with the roses on the table, heavy curtain dividing the cafe and dining room, and a live pianist (in the dining room).

Turns out that beer is as much fun to drink (and learn about) as wine, especially with The Porter's ever-changing menu of draught beers. With 25-30 options, everyone can find at least one to love- and if not, there are 4 pages filled with bottled beers. \\n\\nThe food... \\nI am addicted to the black bean burger. No, really. I get acute cravings and cannot function until I have the well-seasoned mash of organic black beans and quinoa topped with pickled red onions, crumbled feta, and a roasted red pepper mustard that has a horseradish-esque spice in it - all served on a delicious foccacia-like bun. This thing is PERFECT. And sometimes, I NEED it. \\n\\nRarely can I pull myself away from the black bean burger, but when I have, I have not regretted it. I recommend always trying the specials if possible - there are usually 10 or so of them, and they are intentional, yet imaginative dishes. I've seen everything from noodle bowls to rabbit brains. We once had a duck prosciutto served with toasted baguette and a homemade chutney (fuji apple, I believe) that is particularly memorable.  \\n\\nThe service...\\nFor the most part, the service is excellent. The petite girl with very short hair (wish I knew her name) is our favorite. With so many beers on the menu, it's necessary to have a good server who can help you navigate it. \\n\\nHOWEVER, I was in the Porter this past Saturday night. Some dude named Joe waited on us, and I really cannot say anything positive about him. My parents were visiting for one night only, and I chose to take them to The Porter because my father likes to drink beer - a lot. Granted, he drinks Bud or Miller Light, but what better place to educate him at than The Porter, right? Right, except that Joe was a total douche. Slamming things down. Throwing straws. Recommending beers that were absolutely nothing like what we'd explained. It was so disappointing. \\n\\nBecause of Joe, the Porter gets 4 stars. Wish I could say \\"Joe Schmoe\\" and fill in that 5th star.

We have, in New India Cuisine, a serious contender not just for the short list of best cheap restaurants in Austin but for the short list of best restaurants in Austin, full stop.\\n\\nNew India shares a space with a bakery/coffee shop (Brian S. sounds confused about which half he was in). Our table afforded a good view of the flat-panel TV blaring the U.S./Ghana World Cup game, but since watching soccer is pretty much the most boring way imaginable to spend an afternoon, our attention was focused on the food. And DAMN was it worth it.\\n\\nI started with a bowl of tomato soup ($3) and the crispy beef kabobs ($6). I was surprised to see a beef burger on the menu (The Angus mint burger with fries, $5.50). Our server said the kabobs are made of the same stuff, so we tried them and were not disappointed. We got eight pieces of spiced beef, served with mint chutney.\\n\\nPatrick L.: If that huge bowl of Kheema Masala (spicy ground lamb with potatoes and peas, served with a perfect bowl of basmati rice, $9) is your idea of a \\"tiny portion,\\" you can come help yourself to the leftovers (enough for two more lunches) in my fridge.\\n\\nThe vegan garlic naan ($1.75) was a little oily, but it was crispy and a nice complement to my lamb entr√©e. \\n\\nThe redhead I was dining with had the tandoori chicken quesadillas ($5) served with mint chutney and raita (yoghurt dip). They were absolutely slap-your-grandma good.\\n\\nThe service was wonderful. Not sure if the lovely person helping us is the owner or not, but she gave us lots of guidance. It was around 2 pm on a Saturday, and there was only one other table in the place, so I'm sure that helped with getting our orders quickly and accurately. \\n\\nHow does it stack up to other Indian places in Austin? I haven't tried Tarka yet, but I've been to The Clay Pit several times in the last ten years. According to our server, The Clay Pit's version of Indian is a little heavier, less spicy and overall more \\"Americanized.\\" I agree. New India Cuisine's take on Indian seems more exciting, contemporary, and fresh. \\n\\nOh, and with our Go Local card we got 10 percent off. And (from what I've read here on Yelp) they also offer an additional discount to patrons who don't drive there. This is a fantastic idea. I have no idea how they'll enforce it, but if other businesses would adopt it, it could be the answer to our traffic woes. \\n\\nThe prices on the website menu at http://www.newindia.us/menu/ aren't up-to-date, by the way."},{"name":"Barcelona Inman Park","address":"240 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"By far one of my top three favorite places in Atlanta.

Beautiful bar laid out in the entryway and plenty of seating for the size of the restaurant. \\n\\nWine selection was great, beer selection was so so. Happy hour was legit though. Various tantalizing options, $2.00 off apps, buy one get one, buy one get one half off etc...\\n\\nThe servers/bartenders were very attentive and friendly. Ana was super helpful with her suggestions and tips. \\n\\nThe menu was very informative and offered a ton of options without being overwhelming. Steaks, sandwiches, seafood, lamb variations and the list goes on. \\n\\nNow to the good stuff, the food. For an appetizer I got the codfish balls (can't spell or pronounce the actual name so I won't even try). They were a definite 5 star item and were flawless. The fish and batter were seasoned perfectly and when dipped in a little olive oil were simply outstanding. \\n\\nMy main course, the Boquite, sounded absolutely amazing. Imagine a mouthwatering steak with a perfectly runny fried egg on top drenched in a nice brandy reduction concoction. Sound good yet? \\n\\nIf only the meal was actually as good as it sounded. The initial reveal showed a steak that was an ugly grayish color reminiscent of a microwaved steak meal. The first cut revealed a part of the steak that was a perfect rare. Not a problem except I ordered medium. Second cut, there we go, land of the medium found! Still had 7 oz of steak left to go so I overlooked the undercooked end bit and gave them the benefit of the initial skepticism. An idea with so much creativity had to get better right? Nope, it was rather bland throughout. There was zero seasoning on the steak, the egg on top was vastly overcooked and felt like an afterthought or like someone forgot about it. The brandy sauce was also really overpowering and took a lot of the focus away from the steak itself. The rice next to it was perfectly cooked and tasty and the fires were your average bar food French fries. \\n\\nAll in all, I feel my experience, could boil down to me ordering the wrong type of meal. The guy next to me was raving about his meal (the octopus!). I come down to Orlando quite a bit for work and will definitely be going back to give this place another shot as the environment is very welcoming and appealing. Probably going to stick with their seafood offerings though as that seems to be the popular route here on Yelp and with the guy who sat next to me who seemed to be a regular. Plus those codfish balls were so darn good! \\n\\nI can not say enough good things about the service however so that more than made up for my okay steak and would definitely validate another trip back here. \\n\\nLisbon, I didn't not like you, just need more experiences!

We had been there for a little white and spent a considerable amount of  money on food and drinks when right in the middle of a close basketball game and a hockey game that was about to go into overtime, Blitz turned off all of the TVs in the bar because over in the side corner they were having some sort of fashion show with a bunch of horrendously neon dressed pseudo hipster wannabe models. We had asked our sever earlier what was going on and she told us about said fashion show but failed to mention we would no longer be able to watch the sports games we were so invested in. I know Blitz is supposed to be a sports bar but they really don't care about catering to sports fans unless it is a huge game that every single person in the bar is watching. The fashion show was only going on in small area of the bar and it would have been easy to just leave the televisions on with no volume as they had already been on with no volume to accommodate the reggae music that Blitz is accustomed to playing for 7 hours straight. Also the service here has never been short of awful and getting the staff to change the channel on a TV that no one else is already watching is nearly impossible. Not that they refuse.

However, on a random night a few weeks ago when we were bored with our typical neighborhood choices (Solea, Tuscan Grill, Ponzu, Mulan), we decided to give Erawan of Siam a try. Wow!\\n\\nThe interiors of the restaurant was tastefully decorated and well-maintained. We were seated immediately at the front of the restaurant next to the window. The staff were friendly, pleasant and amazingly attentive.\\n\\nWe started off with a bottle of Gewurztraminer ($30) and ordered the Papaya Salad ($8.95) for the appetizer. The shredded green papaya was tossed with tomato and green bean, then dressed with a SE Asian fish sauce vinaigrette (fresh lime juice, sugar, fish sauce, fresh chili, crushed garlic) and topped with steamed shrimp and chopped toasted peanut. A side serving of sticky rice accompanied the salad. I thought it was just as good as what I make at home from scratch, and my date thought it was almost as good. :)\\n\\nNext, we ordered the Basil Duck ($17.95) which was stir-fried roast duck with chili, mushroom, snow pea and dressed with a sweet & spicy basil sauce. This was then topped with a handful of crispy basil leaves that were obviously just fried and sprinkled onto our plate two seconds before making its way onto our table. Heaven! I would give this place 5 stars if I were to judge it by this dish alone!\\n\\nWe also had the Penang Curry ($16.95) which had string bean, red pepper, bamboo strips, baby corn, pineapple chunks and basil. Our protein of choice was seafood (scallop, squid, shrimp) and all three were fresh and cooked to the right level of doneness. It was one of the best Thai curries I've had, but it wasn't as remarkable as the Basil Duck which just blew me away. We shared these two entrees and enjoyed them with steamed jasmine rice.\\n\\nWe went there again last week for the second time, and I had to have the Basil Duck again just to make sure it was as good as I remembered. Yes, it is amazing. :) And of course we had to have the Papaya Salad again as well. Both dishes were great and quality was consistent. \\n\\nMy date didn't let me order the same dishes again, so for the second dish, I chose the Pad Thai ($11.95) which consisted of stir-fried thin rice noodle with egg, crushed peanut, bean sprout, jicama, chicken and shrimp. Best pad Thai ever!!!\\n\\nOur meal was so good that we decided to conclude it with one of their many desserts--fried green tea ice cream ($4.50). Meh. Wouldn't order it again.

Friendly, fun, proud of their establishment.  Food was great.  I like a good red sauce and pasta, but when I go out for dinner I want a place that can do more than one region.  Eclano had a limited menu, but with enough variety to please everyone.  I had chianti braised short ribs and my partner had gnocchi.  So much food - I couldn't finish it all.  The staff(owners?) was small and each of them came up and checked on us.  I felt like I was a special guest at a family dinner.  Awesome food - great service.

The salad was an abomination. the beets were cut into small slivers and baked to a chewy/almost burt consistency. and the \\"herbed\\" goat cheese did not go well with the salad. the dressing was off as well. It was by far the worst salad I've ever had and I love ALL beet/goat cheese salads. It was very sad. Also the flavors on the pizza did not work well. Maybe  there was too much cheese...I don't know but it was just not good.\\n\\nThe service was not very good either. It was hard to get our waitress' attention and it was not even busy when we were there.

TV's in the corners and above the bar kept us updated with the Aaron Hernandez story as we perused the menu.  I chose the BLT with fries, until the server offered 50/50 to my coworker.  I then opted for the BLT with 50/50, since I really only want a few fries for the flavor and the salad to feel healthier.  The server advised that this is really the best deal, since you end up getting almost as much salad and fries as you would if you got only one.\\n\\nThe meals came promptly.  The BLT featured thick cut applewood smoked bacon, tomato, lettuce, and herbed mayo on lightly smoked sourdough.  The bacon was thick and tasty, but a little tough, so you essentially got the whole slice of bacon in a bite, rather than having it break into a crispy bite.  The tomato was juicy, not mealy, and the lettuce was crisp.  I would've preferred less mayo and more toast on the bread, but that didn't stop me from eating the whole sandwich.  There was a nice mix of greens in the salad, which was dressed with overly sweet balsamic vinaigrette.  The fries were a tad soggy, good motivation to leave them on the plate.\\n\\n\\nCheck in on Yelp and get 15% off your bill!"},{"name":"The Porter Beer Bar","address":"1156 Euclid Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"This place is so so good.

The Great American Tavern opened last week. It's in the same location as a number of previous eateries. Recently, the location was the home of Ristorante Daniela, and before that, The Barnside. The building is brand new from the ground up. Strangely, though, the back of the business block faces Main St. (Rt. 28) and you drive around the back to park and view the \\"front\\" of the building. \\n\\nOnce inside, it's pretty sparsely furnished. Nothing special here. It reminds me of a few southern barbecue places...wood floor, wooden tables, chairs and a centrally located bar. Cleanliness was above par (it is a new place). The one thing I have to comment on is that when I went to grab the table to move it closer to another table, I found my fingers in something sticky underneath the table. There isn't much room for people who are waiting for seats. The wait on the night I was there was 90 minutes.\\n\\nThe second room has a smaller bar. The ceilings are incredibly high and the floor concrete. The band played in this room and the noise was deafening. Just the sounds of the people (a very large Saturday night crowd) made it difficult to be heard to others near me.\\n\\nThe staff were adequate - and again, this is a new place so I gave a lot of latitude for learning curves. It takes a while for a place to run smoothly and everyone we dealt with tried hard. There was the forgotten silver, the forgotten round of drinks and the disappearing act for over 30 minutes.\\n\\nThe food was average. The burger I had was plain, and with peppers and onions and american cheese, was nothing special. Another person in my party had a shrimp dish that she said was good but had far too much garlic (and she loves garlic). There is a strange assortment of beer, having a few selections but missing some popular brews. \\n\\nI'll give this place another shot without a doubt. It sometimes takes a while to get up and running in a new place. The Tanner Tavern is a great place so I can only assume that The Great American Tavern will meet or exceed my expectations.

My side was grilled sweet potatoes, which was an excellent choice.

We got a side of the Mac and cheese and it was just ok...probably really good on their pulled pork sandwich though!  Just a bit too saucy for me but some people probably love their Mac like that.

Generally uniform rave reviews here on yelp, the restaurant guide book, Zagat, gives it high marks and there's ALWAYS a line out front. So why did I leave tonight thinking this was just an average place? I arrived just after it opened (5:00 pm) so I was seated right away. If you want to avoid the nightly line, go early. The menu serves your basic Italian staples. Parmigianas, Marsalas, ravioli, etc. For the shellfish and linguine dishes, you have a choice of 5 sauces to choose from. Nothing to fancy. Portions are generous. My server, Rose, was polite and efficient. I've noticed many reviews comment on being rushed through their meal. I did not get that feeling but perhaps that was because it was just after the restaurant opened and there wasn't a line of people out front waiting to be seated. After placing my order, I was served some unimpressive bread. No butter, no accompaniments. There looked like what appeared to be a bottle of EVOO on my table for dipping the bread but since I had no dish to pour the liquid onto, I can't say for sure. Based on recommendations here on yelp, I started out with the fried calamari. It was good but personally, I think that Nico, just a few doors down the street does it much better. I then had the Frutti De Mare (scallops, shrimp, calamari, mussels and clams) served over linguine and I chose the scampi sauce. Again, it was good but no better or worse than what you can get at any number of other restaurants in the North End and certainly not worth waiting in line for. A couple of things to note: there are only 13 tables (guess they're not superstitious) and they're set very close to one another so private conversations are out of the question. It's also \\"cash only\\" however prices are reasonable (and there's an ATM across the street for those unaware). As I left the restaurant, I saw that the inevitable line had formed. Hope they thought it was worth the wait....but I doubt it. Moderately recommended as long as there's no line.

It was mostly a really nice experience.  The ambiance is beautiful, and it's very kid friendly as there's a nice gravel yard right outside, with ambient lighting, picnic tables and a variety of other seating options under gazebos, and handful of sand toys.  If I go back there with my family, it will probably be a lot nicer to sit outside in the yard where they can play while they wait for the food, but this time, the 11 of us got to sit in the balcony, which is where they have their section for special parties.  They indicated the vegan options on the menu for 3 of us, and informed the chefs that my mom is allergic to peanuts, and they were very mindful of these two needs.  The menu items were very unique and tasty, and there was a nice variety of drink options, both alcoholic and non-alcoholic, and including beer, wine and cocktails.  We ordered a large variety of items off the menu (my kids really appreciated their take on beer nuts, which were made from roasted, seasoned garbanzo beans and Pepitas), including the \\"snacks for the table\\" appetizer, the ceviche, the venison tartar, among other things. Here are the only things we did not like so much.  The food was VERY expensive and the portion sizes were incredibly small.  I would have called the \\"appetizers\\" more of amuse-bouches.  The individual dishes were small plates for one person, and the \\"feasts\\" were small plates that could be shared between two people, but I certainly wouldn't have called them \\"feasts\\".  Since it was my dad and also my brother's birthday's they brought tiny little mini ice cream cones, that were delicious, but you could finish the whole thing in about 2 or three bites.  The service was very friendly, considerate, and mindful, but also very very slow.  By the end of the meal everybody said they'd had enough to eat and there were very few leftovers to take home, but the meal cost $500 and took 2 hours (which was too much for my kids).  Generally, I would say this place could be an excellent place for a date night, but not really great for large parties."},{"name":"Chambar","address":"568 Beatty Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"We had a Belgian friend in town for the night, and really wanted to try this place.  We called for reservations and were told they didn't have any, on account of a special event they were throwing that night in celebration of a Belgian national holiday.  Not to be deterred, we stopped by after eating at Medina next door (which is owned by the same people) and asked if there was any way they could accommodate us.  Given the circumstances, they said they were happy to, and went out of their way to setup an extra table (out of their waiting area) for us.  Later, it turns out the person we asked was chef Nico, who was very friendly.\\n\\nThe special event involved a seventeen course prix fixe menu (that's right, seventeen) - and was served sans silverware.  Our Belgian friend complained that of the seventeen items, he probably would have only ordered six of them - and I had to agree.  Despite that, we tried - and enjoyed! - everything.  Some of the dishes (such as the pork, short rib and escargot) really stood out.  At $75 per person, it was really an exceptional value and a memorable evening.\\n\\nIn addition, in celebration of the holiday, their staff dressed up in medieval costumes.  Some of them really went all out.  It was fun to see the staff having so much fun.  Despite this, they still fulfilled their promise of \\"fine dining without pretension\\" (the staff were all friendly and approachable - even when we complained about being missed for a couple courses, a mistake they quickly remedied).\\n\\nI'm certain this isn't a typical night at Chambar, and as a result this review might not be terribly relevant.  That said, the prix fixe menu certainly gave a good sampling of their menu, as well as their quality, and I can safely say that everything is really quite tasty.

Not so cool with me. The saving grace of these meat-in-flour-tortillas-I-ate-with-a-fork is the filling. I had pollo which was moist, very spicy and really juicy. My dinner companions had the short rib tacos which looked good on paper and I'm told were not so good to eat. The comment from both girls was that the ribs were a bit dry.

I can't get enough of it.  That being said, I've been to the lunch buffet at Tandoor a couple of times spread-out in a couple of months... and everytime, I come away not very impressed but not incredibly disappointed (hence the 'average' three star rating, har har har).\\n\\nFirst, to gauge my Indian food tastes, my favorite Indian restaurants around the area are Swagat, Namaste in Vancouver, WA and (can't believe I'm admitting this) Bombay Express in Washington Square Mall in Beaverton.\\n\\nNow, about Tandoor specifically: I actually went to this restaurant before it was Tandoor.  It was a Chinese food place before becoming Tandoor.  Interestingly enough, the gal that's the primary cook in the place worked as the primary cook when it was a Chinese food restaurant.  Not sure how I feel about that, but eh, so it goes.\\n\\nThe buffet does offer a nice variety of Indian food samplings.  My go-to entree - chicken tikka masala - was OK except on every occasion the masala itself was extremely 'soupy.'  I enjoy a thicker masala that I can put all over my rice and dip my naan into; this masala didn't sit on the rice at all, it went THROUGH it.  The chicken was fairly tasty though.\\n\\nMy second love of Indian food is naan and the naan here was adequate.  Not crispy but not very dough'y either.  It was fine.  Had a nice texture and is relatively warm for the buffet.\\n\\nOther dishes were, again, just OK.  The pakora is pretty good and packs a nice spicy punch.\\n\\nThe atmosphere of the restaurant mimics the atmosphere when it was a Chinese food place; kind of barren walls, fairly dark, and a big TV showing some Indian show.\\n\\nA single plate for the lunch buffet will run you $7 with an unlimited plate usage will be around $9 or so.  This is to be expected.\\n\\nIf you're downtown and in the area, if you're FEELING like an Indian food buffet, Tandoor won't be the best place you'll ever experience.  But it's adequate.  If you're not feeling like buffet style Indian, I would actually recommend going a block away and hitting either the Real Taste of India or the New Taste of India food carts (a discussion on which is better is a whole new topic)."},{"name":"Barcelona Inman Park","address":"240 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"So.

Every year we visit the Disney parks but this year we also tried Universal.\\n\\nWhen you arrive you walk through the City Walk area which has lots of nice restaurants and at the end you either turn right to Universal or left to Islands of Adventure. You can buy tickets for both or buy tickets for just one.  We only did Universal. \\n\\nDo yourself a favor and purchase your tickets online. We stood in line at the park to buy tickets and it was the most frustrating experience EVER! It seriously took an hour and a half of being hot and sweaty before we got to the front of the line because everyone took at least 10 minutes at the window and there were only a few windows open. C'mon people- figure out what type of ticket you want to buy before you get up there! We took less than a minute at the window.\\n\\nThe park itself is more suited to teenagers and adults. We actually didn't see many children all day. Most of the rides are simulators so you might want to bring some dramamine. We were there on a Thursday afternoon and pretty much walked onto all the rides except for the Despicable Me ride which was fun but the very short ride wasn't worth the 50 minute wait. Transformers is the best ride we have ever been on. It was fun, no big drops, and is totally worth waiting in line for. Men in Black was a problem for us because even though shooting aliens was fun, the car you are in spins quickly for absolutely no reason other than to make you sick. I actually thought I would throw up. The Simpsons ride was also motion simulator but we got motion sickness because the movements were very jarring. I read some reviews that said you can't bring bags onto the rides and have to put them in the free lockers, but everyone I saw brought bags on the rides.\\n\\nWe didn't bother paying extra for fast pass which lets you cut to the front of the lines.

There were a few big parties of families. Customers looked happy and were having fun. \\n\\nService: Absolutely no complaints. Our server was friendly and did his job well. The Phantom Gourmet video said to expect to wait a while if you order the burger because they don't fork the burger or use a spatula to press the meat down. Our meals were on the table very quickly, (before we even finished our appetizer) so not sure if that was true. \\n\\nFood: I ordered the steak tips and rice for $15. I ordered it medium well- they were overcooked to beyond well done. Regardless, I ate them and they were still delicious. They use good quality steak! I ordered the rice.

What is the usual you may ask? The Fried Chicken Sandwich...the fry batter is spiced perfectly, and the chicken is fried but not greasy or heavy...my favorite thing to do is add pimento cheese to the sandwich which is messy, but turns a great sandwich into a perfect one in my opinion. If you're into healthier food the salads are also really good, and they have some good options for people with dietary restrictions. The bar is also well stocked, plenty of good beer selections that you might not find everywhere. The staff has also been really great to us for the last few years, especially on a night like trivia night where they are dealing with a ton of people.

It's about a half-hour outside Austin on a picturesque property with scrub mesquite stands and buildings that look like a John Ford movie set. It's a destination joint, tour buses and all, and there can be a line and a wait. I got there on a Tuesday afternoon after arriving on a red-eye from Hawaii to L.A. and a commuter connector to Austin. The place itself is charming and the people are too, with genuine smiles and howdys. The horseshoe-shaped direct-heat brick pit is a throwback to cowboy cooking. It looks larger on TV than in person. But the folks are nice about letting you photograph it from up close. OK, let's get down to brass tacks: the food. I got Thurman's plate, with sausage, brisket and a single, large park rib. The brisket was passable, but I've had better in Hawaii, believe it or not, at The Fish and the Hog in Kamuela. The pork rib was tasty but slightly underdone, with meat left on the bone after chewing. Again, I've had better in Hawaii. Now the sausage, oh yes, that's a different story altogether. Juicy, savory, perfect snap, even served cut into bias wheels as it was. And two of the sides were truly amazing. The potato salad and slaw were both the best I've ever had. Sorry, Mom. The potato salad is vinegary, made with barbecue sauce and mustard instead of mayo. And the slaw also had a welcome vinegar bite. The beans, however were bland, not close to the spicy, meaty legumes I ate at Stiles Switch in Austin. For dessert, I had blackberry cobbler with ice cream. The cobbler was good, but not as good as Cooper's in Llano. And the place is BYOB, but don't bring in beer if you're having dessert. My bad, there. It's also cash only. There's an ATM on the premises but bring enough dough so as not to pay the ATM fee. Drawbacks aside, the Salt Lick dishes up heaping helpings of down-home hospitality. My server, Marisol, was delightful. I recommend visiting the Salt Lick, but for the rustic atmosphere and friendly folks.

Fish dish( can't remember the name) was packing a flavor punch. We were not ready! The manager swung by and spoke with us about our meal quality(2 thumbs up) and to give out some Cuban history. We left satisfied and planning our next dinner there.

For once, I can say that it was and is totally worth waiting in line to eat at this restaurant.  The restaurant is small, but still has a really nice restaurant feel to it.  I love the fact that there isn't really a menu, but instead that you order off of a giant chalkboard by telling them what you want in your pasta and what sauce you'd like, or you can order from their specials.  If that's not enough you can look on the other side of the room and order from the daily specials chalkboard!  No menu, but still a lot of good choices.  Now...the FOOD!!!  START WITH THE CALAMARI!!!  Wow, so good.  It kind of feels like it melts in your mouth.  Not too crispy, but not too soggy.  The squid is perfectly cooked to give that melt in your mouth feel.  I went with the lobster ravioli which was incredible.  The sauce was amazing.  Very rich and creamy, with amazing flavor.  My only problem with the dish was that the sauce was a little too rich and took away from the actual lobster that was supposed to be inside the ravioli.  I would have preferred the lobster in the ravioli to contribute more flavor to the dish, but still, the dish was incredible.  My girlfriend had the scallop and shrimp with scampi.  It was also really good (would not recommend this dish to people with a weak stomach, the scampi is very heavy in butter and can have an \\"obstructive\\" feeling), but if you can handle large amounts of butter...GO FOR IT!!!  The flavor is really buttery and garlicky, but is delicious.  The pasta is also really good.  The pasta is well made and well cooked.  Even the wine is good.  I think a bottle was $17, so wasn't expecting too much, but was pleasantly surprised considering it was a $17 bottle of wine.  So, would I recommend this place to people?  ABSOLUTELY!!!  Will I be returning?  YOU BET!  Regarding WAIT TIME: I would recommend going on a weekday.  I think I went on a Monday around 7:30pm and only had to wait about 20 minutes, which I think isn't too bad considering I hear you can wait over 1 hour if you go on weekends."},{"name":"Giacomo's Ristorante - Boston","address":"355 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Waited in line for about 90 minutes one Saturday in November.

We're in the Hill Country on vacation and came across its reviews on Yelp - and boy are we glad we did.  We arrived in the middle of the lunch rush, and, although their picnic-table filled \\"banquet room\\" is huge, we thought we'd be waiting for a while.  Not so - after about 10 minutes in line, we were seated, welcomed with smiles, and happy with excellent tea in hand.  (Wine and beer may be purchased next door and carried in BYOB, no corkage fee.)\\n\\nI ordered the brisket plate \\"moist\\" and my spouse the pork ribs.  Though I'm a fan of brisket, I think Spouse got the better of the two options.  Meaty, sweet but not overly, three huge ribs were augmented by excellent baked beans, so-so potato salad, and to our taste inedible cole slaw.  On the latter:  I loved that the cabbage was chopped rather than shredded, but the dressing was too much vinegar without enough offsetting sweetness.  \\n\\nMy brisket was . . . good.  Yes, it had the right amount of fat to make it tender, and yes, it had some okay sauce, but it wasn't up to the standards of other Texas BBQ places I've tried lately.  \\n\\nI added bread and pickles, and for the first time realized why pickles go so well with BBQ.  Why is it that home made dill pickles compliment beef brisket so well?  I don't know - but at the Salt Lick it is most definitely a fact.\\n\\nWe ate . . . and ate . . . and ate . . . and finally had to give up.  No pecan pie or cobbler for us, though the locals had told us they were not to be missed.  \\n\\nThe place is constant action - servers bringing dishes, taking orders, greeting guests, serving as cashiers, all with good humor and constant smiles.

Inside its faithful terra cota facade are multiple bars tops, wood themes, plants, and wooden wheel framed lighting. A patio with windows to serve drinks opens in the mild months and a screened-in section extend the old space  open for picnic tables. The organic motif is really noticable in among the rustic works-barn like-bringing to mind rural food halls of the great depression. \\n\\nAs a food and bar concept it is hard to distinguish which it really is. It tight ropes a line real close to the demarcation between stable concept and confusion. Yet it stays stable even if one can not really mark it as bar or restaurant, though the difference is close; flavory, beautiful food on one hand, loud music and TV flashing on the other. I'd say a pint and bite watching a game is good, a stop on a night on the town, as well as dinner plans, lunch stop, a meal time with quality food at a decent value. Brunch here seemed game--that new idea of gastropub post-breakfast breakfast that should had been around in the 1990 and before; a classy egg and kegs. So I came for a Sunday brunch.\\n\\nCheddar Biscuit and Chorizo Gravy, a deal for $9, was my choice. Great hangover cure of protein, sauce, and western pizzazz. On the cast iron skillet it's served on is house made cheddar biscuit that melts in the mouth, a wonderful mild spiced chorizo gravy, scallions, and well done  eggs. ( eggs come sunside-up but I had them scrambled.) This dish is fab. The wonderful and young staff were booze-pop pushers and I enjoyed with applause the strawberry daiquiri freeze pop that was as tasty as it was a head rush of cold stroke. The coffee and the bite of a friend's soft pretzel I took were as well done.  \\n\\nNice joint. The staff was wonderful and met my needs.

I mean, I still ordered thin crust pizza from Domino's and would get a personal pan supreme pizza from Pizza Hut (via Target), whenever I had a craving.  So moving down to Atlanta, I was okay with these franchises as my pizza places of choice.  Until I discovered Antico's.\\n\\nThe pizza is always warm (particularly if you pick-up), the cheese nice and creamy, and there is just something about their sauce.  If you're looking for some real good (New York-kind of pizza) Antico is your spot.  Oh yeah, if you're also looking for good wood-fired pizza, Antico is it as well ;-)\\n\\nParking is tricky = hard.  Especially from Thursday-Saturday night.  They usually have a cop outside to help direct traffic....which is why I usually do pick-up.  A note about pick-up...apparently you can just walk straight up to the next available register.  They don't make your pizza until you pay for it, so I guess this is the courtesy they extend to you for calling in.\\n\\nIf you didn't call in beforehand or are dining in, you have to wait in the cashier line to order.  (Those dining in would head to the main dining area to stand in another line until their number is call.  It's at that point you can go get a table/seat.  And FYI, the tables are set-up picnic style, so you might end up sharing a space with another party).\\n\\nI've tried the margherita pizza (my favorite) and the one with mushrooms and artichokes and pepperoni, which is also a good choice.  One thing I don't really recommend is the dessert.  They seem more sour than sweet, and this also goes for the tiramisu and cannolis.  Stick to what they do best...pizza.\\n\\nIf there was anything else I would recommend (aside from better desserts), is a smile on some of the cashier's faces.  Although most of the times I've been there they were nice, don't be alarmed or caught of guard if you experience \\"the mean girl\\".  Maybe it's a language barrier or something, but this is also why I don't mind/prefer take-out than dine in.  Oh yeah, and it would be great if they do a pay-per-slice thing.  I guess it might take away from the freshness of their pizza, but this is definitely one thing I miss about New York \\"style\\" pizza."},{"name":"OB's Cafe","address":"74 Billings Rd","city":"North Quincy","stars":"4","text":"Just moved down by OB's recently and decided that it was time to try it.

I went pretty snack crazy on that trip and walked out with a sticky bun, the chocolate banana bread pudding, one of those scallion scones, the lolita cookie, a double chocolate chip cookie, and a lemon tart. I was with two other people, so we each had a nice snacking session. Everything was very good, the lolita being the standout favorite for me. The sticky bun was tasty but I wasn't bowled over like a lot of people on here. The scallion scone was a surprise standout in my opinion, it being the only savory baked good that we tried. \\n\\nFinally the other day, I was able to return to Flour and went to the Farnsworth location and decided to exercise a little more restraint. I tried the tofu sandwich which was very tasty, if a little heavy on the olive tapenade (it should be noted that I'm not a huge fan of olives). My mom on the other hand made up for my restraint and ordered an apple spice snacking cake, a double chocolate chip cookie, an oatmeal raisin cookie, and a milk chocolate hazelnut cookie. Once again, all delicious but this time, I waited to get back to the hotel and warmed up the double chocolate chip in the microwave. The chocolate that they use here is out of this world and had all kinds of fruity notes in it that really came out when melted.

There is no comparison.\\n\\nFlavor and texture combinations are delicate, thoughtful and delicious. Dishes are presented beautifully. \\n\\nYou don't have to be a foodie to recognize how much time was spent conceptualizing the dishes, making vegetarian food shine. \\n\\nFor those meat-eating guests, you won't miss it here.\\n\\nIf you're heading to Red Lentil, check out five of my favorite dishes:\\n\\nAppetizer - Gobi Manchurian\\nLike a vegetarian take on General Tsao's Chicken, individual cauliflower florets are cooked to a perfection (not too soft or hard) then battered with chickpea flour and fried in a spicy tomato sauce. I love biting into the crunchy exterior, and savoring the soft cauliflower interior. The chef's skill and sense of humor comes out in this side dish; it's smart and playful.\\n\\nAppetizer - Eggplant Caponata with Sundried Pesto Crostini\\nThe wheat bread crostini provides crunch, and the soft eggplant melts in your mouth. Olives and capers provide an appropriate saltiness that pairs well with the acidity in the tomato sauce.\\n\\nEntree - Near East Seitan with Teff Crepe\\nThis is a truly multicultural fusion with French and South Indian influences. The coconut sauce is refreshing, not overpowering. Flavors blend the sweet and the savory.\\n\\nEntree - Pistachio and Herb Encrusted Tofu with Corn Cake\\nAmazing blend of flavors. The tofu crunches against delicate spinach and corn cake. There's a slight kick to the jalapeno relish and a cooling affect with the cilantro chutney. To get the true experience, take a bit of each component in every bite. So delicious!\\n\\nDessert - Vegan Carrot Cake\\nThe chef told us the icing is made of tofutti. I'm not vegan, and still eat dairy, but I didn't miss it in this dessert. It reflects a traditional carrot cake, delicious.\\n\\nThe only reason I didn't give this restaurant 5 stars is because service is slow, and there are lines.\\n\\nBUT I WILL KEEP RETURNING, because the food here is truly incredible, and the wait staff is knowledgeable and kind. I've spoken with the chef a few times, and he's always so engaged with the community, and very proud of his creations.\\n\\nMy advice: try Red Lentil on a week night, since lines are shorter than on weekends.

I'm sure plenty of people have had great experiences, but for me this was not.  With that being said, this was one of the worst dining experiences I have ever had (bad enough for me to create a yelp account just so I can do this review).  \\n\\nIt seems like the restaurant is split into two sections offering two different menus (if you want the burger you need to opt for the bar/darker lit section of the restaurant).  The decor and ambiance of the restaurant definitely set the mood for a nice evening.  Definitely the type of place you could take a date and enjoy conversation.\\n\\nThe drink menu provides plenty of choices from beer to cocktails.  As far as the dinner menu goes you pretty much have to choose between a prix fixe of 3, 6, or 8 courses.  My girlfriend and I chose the 3 course.  \\n\\nWe started off with the octopus and pig tails since it seemed like the most popular dishes there.  They were both okay.  If you're not a fan of octopus I wouldn't let that lead you away from ordering it since it's prepared more like a protein than seafood.  The pigtails were good, but since they're so fatty it's hard to eat more than 2.\\n\\nFor the second course we ordered the stuffed chicken and pork three ways (rib, sausage, and something else I couldn't quite identify).  The chicken was moist but nothing spectacular.  It was stuffed with some sort of sausage but it had a taste and texture that I was not a fan of.  The pork dish also was nothing exceptional - I completely avoided the sausage since again the taste and texture seemed off to me which I let the waiter know.  They ended up giving me another rib for my trouble- which I was grateful for but couldn't really eat any more of.\\n\\nFor the third course we had the beignets and a pear/sorbet.  It was definitely the best part of the meal.  I'd strongly suggest the beignets.\\n\\nAlthough I'm tempted to give the place 1 star I think such a rating would be unfair.  The effort to innovate and service definitely exists at this restaurant (the kitchen was cooking up different tastes and dishing it out to patrons for sampling), but in terms of execution (at least for my group) it simply wasn't there.  For example, a waitress just dropped off our second course without saying anything.  I wasn't expecting her to say \\"enjoy\\" or anything but a description of the dishes would have been appreciated.  The food itself wasn't anything spectacular, and for this price point I would recommend going to Bistro Du Midi instead.  The dishes here certainly have a wide flavor profile but I think it falls short of some of the other fine dining options in the Boston area."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"Absolutely, THE BEST BBQ I've ever had! & it should be since I've been there twice now, and drove from Dallas just to eat it, and drive back. Crazy you might say, but ey, I'm a foodie, that's what I do. I actually heard about this place watching the food network when they had a special of the best bbqs. So, seeing as it was within driving distance, I decided to check it out.\\n\\nIf you don't have directions or a GPS like I do, goodluck finding the place. It's down an old Texas country road, about 20mins outside of Austin, TX. I have drove past it once, since it looks like an old shack with a chimney billowing smoke with that heavenly aroma you could smell for miles. It may be not much to look at, but you won't care once you try it. However, the flowers in the cowboy boot is a nice touch, let's you know your in Texas. haha \\n\\nSo anyways on to the important stuff, I always order the same thing, the plate w/everything, which includes like 7 slices of smoked sausage, 2 strips of brisket, & a pork rib, w/cabbage slaw, potato salad & beans. You can order it family style too, but the combo plate usually fills me up just fine, and I never finish the whole thing. \\n\\nMy favorite part is the pork rib. It just melts off the bone, is so tender and juicy, never dry, and when you put their signature bbq on top, everything just makes sense. The sauce is a yellowish color, and I believe I can taste brown sugar, honey mustard, and vinegar in it for sure, among the ingredients. It's tangy, yet has a touch of sweet to it that makes it blend so well with the savory flavor of the meat. \\n\\nThe Brisket the first time I had it was a bit on the dry side for me, but having gone back just last week it was more juicy this time around. I love to smother it with sauce as well. The smoked sausage is just as you would expect a bbq sausage to be, but with a bit of a kick; & spicy just the way I like it. \\n\\nNow, the sides, well, they are just plain delicious. Beans, well, that's exactly what you get.  And to be honest I really don't care for pinto beans, I prefer black given the choice, but I find that if you mix the bbq sauce in with them they taste pretty good. The potato salad has a bit of a tang, I think from some vinegar, and pairs nicely any choice of meat. But the cabbage slaw, that's a different story. If you read the history of Salt Lick, it use to be a ranch. The man who owned the ranch was an american, & he married a japanese woman. The bf & I have come to the conclusion that she had some influence in the cooking because the slaw has an asian flavor, tasting like it has a sesame dressing, which is a refreshing break from all that meat. \\n\\nHope this review helped make you hungry & feel like being spontaneous enough to drive for hours just to see what I mean. =P\\n\\nBTW.. I included a photo of my plate to tease you."},{"name":"Craigie On Main","address":"853 Main St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"I found the environment cramped and stuffy without enough room between tables along with the usual know it all arogance often encountered in Boston.

Even if you think you've had it all, The Salt lick is a must visit for a variety of reasons. \\n\\n1) This is the quintessential first meal for any BBQ (or Austin) first timer. Why? It's simple. One of the foods that people associate with Austin is BBQ and, when many people think BBQ, they probably think of some hole in the wall place out in the middle of nowhere. Well, the Salt Lick certainly doesn't live that image down. It's a homey-looking complex of ranch-style buildings nestled in the rolling landscape of the Texas hill country, just a short drive south of Austin. It looks the way a BBQ place should look and, really, that can be just as important as the food itself! \\n\\n2) Their version of BBQ is unique for Central Texas. In fact, I'd argue a big reason they've become so popular is because their style of BBQ is really unusual for an area where BBQ sauce is more of an afterthought rather than prerequisite. The Salt Lick isn't like that.  Their sweet and tangy style of BBQ sauce comes first with the meat more secondary. A mustard-based potato salad and vinegar-based coleslaw are a couple of other items that aren't typically found in Texas. None of this is to state their food is inferior, it's just different compared to the rest of Central Texas. \\n\\n3) \\"Family Style\\". If you're coming here for the first time, there's no other way to go. At The Salt Lick, \\"Family Style\\" means all-you-can-eat brisket, pork ribs, sausage and sides for around $20 per person. While it's a bit on the expensive side, you can ask your server for a box and take home any leftovers you don't finish. So, taking that in to account, you're really getting two meals for the price of one! \\n\\nTo sum up, is the Salt Lick the best BBQ in Texas? That could be argued. But is it one of the best BBQ experiences in Texas? That's an undeniable yes!"},{"name":"Nakato Japanese Restaurant","address":"1776 Cheshire Bridge Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"One of Atlanta's best restaurants ever.

If you are a regular here, you know the routine and how the place works. If this is your first visit, you might be naive to the workings around here- be patient.

Also, the waitstaff does not speak perfect English so sometimes things get a little confusing.\\n\\nIf you do befriend the owner, he is the most kind and generous person around. He contributes money to every Melrose  organization and hosts charity dinners at his store. He loves seeing kids in the restaurant and hands out candy to them.\\n\\nFood- Pizza is unbelievable.

I typically get the all you can eat option, which costs around $20, and is definitely worth it because there is no limit to how many plates of meat you can get.  It consists of sausage, brisket, and pork ribs, two sides of your choice, and bread.  In my opinion, the best part about Salt Lick is that it is BYOB!

He, Don P. and I headed over here for some lunchtime chow on a Friday.  We arrived around 12:40, and the place was packed.  As others have mentioned, this is a SMALL place - two large tables and one two-top - so prepare to get to know the other diners if you eat in.  We met and talked with almost everybody in the restaurant.  \\n\\nThe food was stellar.  Don's etoufee:  yum.  Cory's fish dinner was INSANELY good.  I grew up in the Midwest, where people are like, \\"You caught a catfish?  Throw it back,\\" so the idea that fried catfish could be good is one that I've had to learn.  If you have this problem, come to Lola.  She'll set you straight.\\n\\nI had the shrimp dinner, which I also loved, although Cory wasn't as much of a fan (Don loved it too, so we win 2-1).  The batter wasn't as flavorful as the batter on the catfish, but I liked it that way.  The shrimp were huge, plentiful, and fried perfectly, without a hint of greasiness.  My sides, smothered okra and mustard greens, were also both outstanding.  Now THIS is some Southern comfort food.  Oh, and my total bill for more food than I could shake a stick at?  $7.50.  Now you're talkin'.\\n\\nHowever, if you're high maintenance, you may need to hear a couple of minor points about this place.  Parking is on the street, and while the neighborhood isn't as bad as I feared after having read some of the other reviews here, it's not great, either.  Decor is all kinds o' crazy - Mardi Gras beads hanging from the ceiling; giant, glittery Last Supper mirror on the wall; random colorful stuff everywhere.  There is a LOT of religious paraphernalia here, which in other contexts I might raise an eyebrow at - but you just can't here, because Lola practices a kind of religion that everyone understands.  Also, it got kind of smoky in the restaurant while we were waiting for our food - which, by the way, was quite a while - in the neighborhood of an hour and a half (although Lola told us later that she had only been that busy a couple of times the entire time her restaurant has been open).  Good food takes a long time to cook right, and Lola is literally \\"chief cook and bottle washer\\" here.  No other employees other than her - she cooks, waits tables, and works the cash register.  Had one of her friends who was eating there not stepped in to help wait tables, we probably would have been waiting even longer for our meal.\\n\\nBut if you've got some time to kill and don't mind making friends with the strangers around your table while you're doing it, Nubian Queen Lola's is the place to get some great food in your belly and enjoy a couple of hours with some good people.  Now I know why they call it \\"soul food.\\""},{"name":"Rocco's Tacos & Tequila Bar","address":"7468 W Sand Lake Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Rocco's Tacos is a very hip and cool restaurant that has club-like qualities and great bar service.

I have eaten there several times and always enjoy the chance to have one of their amazing burgers. I recently signed up with a friend for their burger and a beer Friday lunch promotion with Notch brewing, so this is a review of that, not the restaurant in general.\\n\\nFood (9 out of 10): As usual the burger doesn't disappoint. It's has an amazing velvety texture and a great balance with the sauce and bun.\\n\\nDrink (7 out of 10): As this was a beer pairing, we tried the Notch brewing. The beer is quite tasty, though the wait staff served the beer directly to the table in the can which was a bit strange and only provided a glass once asked....and it was the wrong type of glass at that. I know this might seem like a small thing, but proper glassware and the aroma of a beer help enhance the flavor.\\n\\nAtmosphere (8 out of 10): We sat off to the side and the place was packed by the time we left.\\n\\nCost (6 out of 10): Craigie needs to clarify this promotion as their advertised $18 burger and notch beer promotion, in actuality, provides no special deal -the burger is regularly $18 and doesn't include a beer. In fact, you are at a bit of a disadvantage as the online ticketing charges a service fee. \\n\\nService (6 out of 10): Sadly, this is where things weren't so great and left us with a sour experience. Our waitress was distant and dismissive and, in truth, a bit rude when we asked how the burgers were cooked as my friend didn't want her burger served medium-rare. The waitress never asked and was a bit rude with her manner. We also had some sticking points as mentioned above with the beer delivery.\\n\\nOverall, the burger and beer lunch pairing is a great idea to try a delicious burger; there are a few kinks that need to be worked out if Craigie plans on doing it again."},{"name":"MeeT in Yaletown","address":"1165 Mainland Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Food: 4/5\\nDrinks: 3/5\\nAmbience: 4/5\\n\\nAtmospheric and brimming with energy.

When I saw that she was going to do nothing to suggest how to fix my disappointment, I suggested that maybe if she could add more noodles, it may make it edible for a human to consume. She added a scoop of noodles and returned it to me and gave me another rude look. I paid $7 for the plate of food on the hottest day on the planet today (100 degrees outside).

A game with potentially huge playoff implications. And of course, our local Fox station chooses to go with the Seahawks game. Pffffft.\\n\\nEnter Draft Pick. It's close to home and fairly new, so I was curious to check it out. The game was showing on their HUGE screen, which was great. It was a little hard to hear the sounds, but with such a great picture I didn't really care. The food was decent enough. Chips and salsa were pretty standard. I ordered a cheese pizza. For $10.00 it was a good size and pretty tasty. I don't know that I'd make a point of going there for the pizza alone, but I would order it again. Our server was friendly, but not overly so. She didn't hover, which was good. I liked the design of the place. It felt a little nicer than the typical sports bar, but not so upscale that I don't feel comfortable screaming at the TV and heckling the Lions fans who made the unfortunate decision to patronize Draft Pick that afternoon. Actually, being a Lions fan is an unfortunate choice in general...But I digress.\\n\\nPrices are in line with similar establishments. I will probably be back to watch my beloved Bears. My only qualm is, if the game you want to see isn't on the big screen it won't be nearly as enjoyable.

I realize it's an upscale bar with expensive drinks (by Portland standards) that caters to a hip older 35+ crowd who reminisces over a time when mos def and kweli were in top of the world and enjoying conscious rap was a badge of rebellion worn proudly on a dusty jansport backpack wherever you went... but slow it down on the MSG. I know this is sometimes a thing places like this do to upsell you on $4 bowls of rice or $10+ cocktails. I drank at least one of those large  free bottles of tap water in one sitting.

After going to Antico twice in the last two weeks, I think I have a pretty good grasp of the place.\\n\\nThere is no doubt that this is the freshest, healthiest pizza in the city (especially if you get the vegetarian options). These pizzas have thin, charred crusts, lots of sauce, light cheese and a smattering of toppings depending on your choice (basil, tomatoes, spicy sausage, etc.) From what I have read, this is pizza the way the Italians intended it to be served.\\n\\nMy problem is giving Antico the label of the best pizza in Atlanta because, well, I have a soft spot for the humungous slices that the city is known for (a la Fellini's, Camelli's, etc.) Sometimes Fellini's just hits the spot in a way that Antico's cant because it's such a trendy spot to be seen with your friends and your six-pack of Sierra Nevada or bottle of wine. For that matter, Domino's or Pizza Hut or some variation of college pizza just feels good.\\n\\nI can't imagine eating at Antico's all the time - maybe once every couple of months - because it is not cheap and the experience is kind of rushed, especially if you eat during lunch or dinner. But the experience of sitting around a picnic table with five or six of your best friends and enjoying hot, bubbly pizzas from giant metal trays with only your hands, paper towels and little cups of hot peppers and fresh garlic as condiments ... well, it's the pizza equivalent of a low-maintenance, high flavor, low country boil."},{"name":"Giacomo's Ristorante - Boston","address":"355 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"The food is definitely 5 star but the harried pace is somewhat off-putting.

What was interesting to us was the fact that NONE of the items as a whole were on the Restaurant Week menu were on their regular menu. \\n\\nParking is alright. There is a private lot reserved for restaurants or shops in the small plaza, but the amount of spots is limited. We were lucky enough to snag one.\\n\\nSince it was the end of the week, a lot of their items had run out. So we ended up compiling our three meal orders together to end up with all the remaining menu items:\\n\\nFried Brussels Sprouts - So good. I love when my fried Brussels sprouts get drenched in sauce. And that's what this was.\\nFried Pork Cake - I believe that was the name... This was surprisingly tasty. I didn't know what to expect by it but the pulled pork inside the deep fried casing was pleasantly good. The slaw on top completed the BBQ flavors.\\n\\nHalfway through our meal, I decided to order a beer. There is something for everyone on tap, and after hailing someone who looked like they could work at the Albert, I was able to put in an order of the local Red Brick Hibiscuwit. It took a while getting to me, but it was worth the wait!\\n\\nPork Belly - AMAZING. I was, once again, surprised. The pork belly was tender and not SUPER flavorful but very rich and I wish I could have had more.\\nBBQ Platter - not bad. By now I was super full, but the sampler style platter gave us a taste of what they currently offer on their menu. The wings were tasty, brisket was tender, and that pulled pork though. While it definitely didn't look super appetizing, it tasted much better than it looked. \\n\\nButtermilk pie - we thought this was all they had left, and I was super worried we were basically going to end up with just straight up pancakes or cornbread or something. Instead, we got this cake that was just like a cheesecake. Delicious!\\nNY Cheesecake - the server managed to score us the last piece of cheesecake. It was just ok, but a nice change from the two slices of buttermilk cake that we were already splitting.\\n\\nThe clock struck 9 and the whole bar atmosphere changed. 9 PM is apparently the Fear of the Walking Dead night. What began as a rambunctious sports bar turned into a silent movie theater. It's real serious. They literally turned down ALL the lights and turned up the sound on all the TV's. Everyone was Dead silent. Pun intended. I couldn't see my food and I had a hard time not paying attention to the TV (I can't watch post-apocalyptic shows like the Walking Dead). We quickly asked for our checks while finishing our dessert in the dark and got the hell out of there. I wanted to be able to sleep peacefully tonight.\\n\\nOverall, I'm convinced. The BBQ was legit and the next time I'm back, I'm going for the wings and the burger.

Whereas some businesses don't seem to care what experience people have in their establishment, Craigie on Main really cares.  I mean *really* outstandingly, genuinely, fabulously, cares about your experience.  \\n\\nI had a sort of grumpy reaction to my first meal there, which we ate at the bar (though my partner later reminded me that he actually *had* really enjoyed his drink the first time around, the \\"northern lights\\").  The day after I posted it, I got an email from the owner of the restaurant, not just apologizing for the experience, but genuinely I would say concerned and distraught about what had happened, wanting to know the details.  She then, I kid you not, sent me a $100 gift certificate in the mail, a menu of their specialties, and a sweet invitation to come back and try it again.  I was shocked and delighted. \\n\\nIt took us a while to make it back to Craigie (and even longer to get to this review, which I feel awful about) as I've been caught up this year with a series of insanely draining events (e.g. planning a wedding, moving to India, starting a new degree program that draws heavily on the math I never learned in high school), but we finally did.  \\n\\nI wish that I had documented at the time all the details of our absolutely blissful meal at Craigie, but I was just selfishly caught up in enjoying being treated like an absolute princess and was not thinking of you, fellow Yelpers.  Sorry! But the first and strongest thing I have to say, is that we got the absolute best service we've ever gotten, ever, anywhere, that night at Craigie.  They treated us like royalty, but not in a stuffy or weird way, just in that absolutely effortless way that always characterizes the best service.  (and we weren't getting special treatment or anything, we didn't whip out our gift certificate until the end). \\n\\nThe food was also wonderful.  I got the vegetarian prix fixe and my husband got the meat prix fixe with the pork 3 ways.  We had wanted to try the tasting menu, which looks like the end-all be-all of delightfulness, but I have shellfish allergies, and there is a lot of seafood on that menu.  \\n\\nI wish I could give more detail on the food, but it's all become a white wine-fueled blur of exquisite sensations, topped off by a stunning, shockingly good homemade sorbet. \\n\\nIn all ways, including food, service, and genuinely caring, Craigie is genuinely world class.  If you can afford it, this is the most special special-occasion place I've been to in the Boston area.  \\n\\nKudos to Craigie!  You're amazing.  We'll be back.

And now, this is my favorite. I've been to Rudy's and Texas Pride...this kicks their butts sideways. They ask if you want your brisket lean...which is what I want, cuz who wants all that fat? It was so lean and tender and so dang good...I could probably have eaten a PILE of it. The turkey...oh man...the turkey was amazing. Moist and tender...VERY tasty. My cousin got the pulled pork sandwich - I've never seen one so big. And they serve it on a LOAF of their bread - and the bread I could eat forever. It's dense and soft and *slobber* ...well, there isn't a thing at Salt Lick I couldn't just roll around on and eat for the rest of my days. Well, ok, the beans. The beans were a non-starter. They really didn't have much flavor. I don't care. I don't usually eat beans anyhow, so no loss there. Cole slaw was really good, so was the potato salad. I'd love to go the Family Style route next time I go - all you can eat for a little under $20 a person. Not that they don't give you a ton of food, but I'd leave the sides and eat all the meat and bread I could hold. Oh, and even the iced tea was tasty. Not anemic like so many other places. It had a good flavor all by itself. \\n\\nWhen you pull into this place, it's got a GIANT dirt parking lot (it was a little rough because it had rained recently and was pretty pitted), and it looked like there were just a TON of people there. But it's such a big restaurant that we got seated right away, had a whole picnic table to ourselves, and it wasn't that noisy in there. I love the casual \\"Texasyness\\" of the place - the outside patio has lights in the huge oak trees, they have live music, and a little gift shop area where you can get t-shirts, hats, koozies, bottle openers, and they sell their sauce and rub inside.

He gave me single pieces of nigiri, which was great because I got to try so many more different types. \\n\\nWould definitely go back if I was ever in Atlanta again."},{"name":"King Bao","address":"710 N Mills Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Love this place.\\n\\nCool laid back atmosphere.

There's always something to be picked up from somewhere and today's trip took us to the Home Depot.  I know, I know...this is about Bit Hot Dog Company, not Home Depot, but here's how the two connect...Home Depot =Hot Dog Vendor out front. See?  \\n\\nWhen we left the HD the first thing I smelled outside the store was the hotdogs, and I LOVE a good hotdog.  I looked over at the hubs and he said \\"Why don't we try Bite today?\\".  Hmmm, good idea I thought so that's where we headed. \\n\\nLocated in Longwood off of 434, this is close to our home.  I was already anticipating my hotdog and fries imagining their tastes to be just like those I love at Hot Dog Heaven.   We we arrived the lot was full (it was around 11:30). We grabbed a spot and went inside.  There was a couple a head of us but that gave me a chance to peruse the menu. \\n\\nThe menu was smaller than I expected, but they were interesting sounding..Bloody Mary Dog (tomatoes, diced celery, green olives, celery salt and horseradish sauce), Loaded Chili Cheese (chili, cheese, jalepenos, sour cream, onions)...you get the idea.  Three style of dogs; regular, spicy and jumbo, make it a meal by adding fries and a pop.\\n\\nThe hubs and I decided that we were there for the dogs so we skipped the fries and ordered two dogs each: Loaded Chili Cheese and Bloody Mary for me, spicy kraut and Chicago for him and two drinks.  We got our number and went to find a seat. \\n\\nThe inside is small, 8 tables at most and most of them only for 2 people.  There are two counter areas with bar stools that line the walls and 3 outside tables (not options for 90 degree weather).  We claimed our spot at the counter and then waited for the food. \\n\\nWhen hubs brought the tray to the table I took my two dogs and started with the Bloody Mary. I wasn't a fan of the diced celery on the dog.  This has nothing to do with prep, just my tastebuds and there was so much stuff, it was hard to close the bun.  Compared to all the other ingredients, the dog was kinda small, and like others have mentioned the snap wasn't there that you expect with a Vienna dog.  The Loaded Chili was by far the winner.  I love the chili (no beans version) and the  way they drizzle sour cream over the top was mmm mmm good. \\n\\nWas this as good to me as Hot Dog Heaven? No.  Will I go back? Yes. Did it satisfy that hotdog craving? Definitely.\\n\\nPro's\\n-Closer to my house than Hot Dog Heaven\\n-Vienna Beef Dogs\\n\\nCon's\\n-Somewhat limited menu (nothing real uniqe unless you count the Mashed potato dog)\\n-Limited Seating and seating that is there isn't really made for groups\\n-Parking can be difficult getting in and out of if there are lots of guests with vans/suvs"},{"name":"The Salty Pig","address":"130 Dartmouth St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"The bone marrow is so freaking delicious.

They also probably assume that the dining in this city is made up of 2 pizzeria's, 1 Chinese buffet and a five star steak house for business execs. Well, guess what?! It's time to prove your nay-saying friends wrong with a trip to Surly Girl Saloon!\\n\\nAs many other reviewers have said, the decor in this restaurant is amazing. It's like \\"old western meets punk rock girly hip\\". The atmosphere that the place gives off is undeniably cool, fun and alternative to your average \\"nice restaurant\\".\\n\\nThe menu is impressive as well as the food prices. Surly girl seems to pride themselves on their comfort food rather than their probable ability to make a steak tartar if they wanted. I always get the grilled cheese with tomato soup. God, SO GOOD! It's like my favorite food from my childhood all dressed up with tomato and THREE strips of bacon! My boyfriend got the pulled pork tacos and devoured them instantly. He really hates Mexican food, be he sure seemed to like what was on his plate. \\n\\nOne staple that we always get is their Spinach-Artichoke cheese dip; its so savory that I have late-night cravings for it. And it comes with warm, fresh-out-of-the-oven pita bread. Unbelievable.\\n\\nNow onto the booze. You can't call yourself a Saloon without offering drinks, and Surly Girl does not disappoint. They import beers from everywhere but offer many of Columbus's local brews as well. I mean, we have a whole Brewery District so why not put it to good use right? They also have a special menu of mixed drinks, and brew their own Vodka. What more could you want?\\n\\nWhy I'm giving this place 5 stars: It's the little things mostly. \\nA couple of people mentioned the crowd at Surly Girl. Yes, it is mostly the young and self titled \\"hipsters\\", but I had no problem taking my Grandma there for dinner when she came to visit. Surly Girl was very accommodating to her and her needs. At first, we were put at a table near the door on a cold night. My grandma asked if they could please sit us somewhere else because of the draft. As soon as a new table opened up, we were whisked away to the other side of the restaurant far from the door. It was so refreshing that they were so sensitive to her needs.\\n\\nThe servers have always seemed professional and on task when I have visited. The problem with a lot of restaurants in Columbus is that all of the good ones, are usually very tiny. So, because so many people want to eat there, it causes customer traffic and long table-waiting times. I feel that the servers work with what they're given with and really try to clear tables quickly for the next group of people waiting to be seated. Also, their demeanor towards me and my guests has always been friendly and happy. \\n\\nGood thing to know: They card after 8 or 9pm. If you're under 21 and was hoping for dinner at Surly Girl after those times, I'm sorry but I'm afraid you're out of luck.\\n\\nI would recommend this place to anyone, especially those who need to take their out of town guests to a place for dinner. Long live Surly Girl!"},{"name":"Giacomo's Ristorante - Boston","address":"355 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"This place was amazing!! Lobster ravioli with the house sauce.

The food here has been consistently poor and today's visit did not,  unfortunately,  dissapoint in this regard.   First I ordered the california benedict but they informed me that they were out of Avocado.   I then changed my order to traditional eggs benedict.   My lunch companions ordered a burger and grilled chicken sandwich, respectively.   The restaurant was not even 1/3 full,  yet we still waited for over 30 minutes to get our food.  In the meantime,  we ordered $2.99 cups of coffee ( Yes - you read that right - $2.99 for a cup of regular coffee!!! ) which we had to ask 3 times to be refilled.  When the food came,  it was clear that it had been sitting under the \\"klieg lights\\" in the kitchen for quite sometime.   The eggs on my eggs benedict were completely overcooked and one half did not even have a yolk,  cooked or not!   I nicely pointed this out to the waiter and,  to his credit,  he did offer me a complimentary milkshake but I was not in the mood for a milkshake so declined.  The burger and chicken sandwich that my companions ordered were both very dry and overcooked.   One of my companions had a groupon for which he did not read the fine print ( stated that 4 persons must be sitting at the table ) and since there were only 3 of us,  we were not allowed to use it.   Under normal circumstances,  I would understand and accept this.   However in the event that all of our food was badly prepared,  I would've thought that the manager would have allowed the use of the groupon in this instance.   The waiter was apologetic and told us that another waiter had recently been fired for allowing use of a groupon where there were less than 4 people at the table!   So much for employee empowerment!   My 2 cents:  if you want to go to a gay-themed or gay-friendly restaurant,  pass this place by and go to Hamburger Marys.   Much better value for the money."},{"name":"Little Bangkok","address":"2225 Cheshire Bridge Rd Ne","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Thai is my favorite type of food.

Because of this, it's extremely loud.  Earplugs are provided, however.  The beds are ridiculously uncomfortable.  A twin mattress isn't that expensive; how about replacing it when it starts sagging.  Three bathrooms on a floor of many rooms is fine if they're all well stocked with TP.  None in one bathroom takes it completely out of commission and on a Saturday morning, didn't make some people too happy.  There should be a supply located in the bathrooms.

Now, don't get me wrong. It isn't about having deep dish all the time. In fact, I prefer thin crust -- but not really the cracker type. In truth, I prefer traditional NY style pizza that is gooey and foldable. You can get that in Chicago. Apparently, it is harder to find here in Austin. I've tried a NY style pizza place out here and while it was okay, it was still lacking -- way too thin for me and skimpy on the toppings. I live near this Papa John's so decided to give it a try. I asked for extra cheese since I've found that with the NY style place and Pizza Hut - they were severely lacking on cheese. It did little good, but at least I could fold the hand tossed. That gave me some hope. \\n\\nThis particular location has a couple of tables to eat inside, but I wouldn't recommend it - the ambiance is less than desirable.\\n\\nThe current pizza hell I live in now includes Domino's, Papa John's and Pizza Hut - all within arm's reach of each other!!! OMG. I've heard Domino's has gotten better, so I'll try that next and see . . . meanwhile, I dream of Chicago and NY style pan pizza (not too thin, not too thick) - with GENEROUS toppings. I have a feeling it's gonna take a really long time to find a decent pizza in Austin.

Since I am so close, I pick up my pizza to avoid having to pay for delivery. They do lock the door so they have to buzz you in. I assume it is so various uninvited individuals do not come in and for security. It is kinda a nuisance but I completely understand. I am typically greeted somewhat promptly. And since Domino's has a pizza tracker, I can time when I need to be on my way to pick up pretty well. The pizza is what it is. Still kinda on the cardboard side.

It was relatively small, good for parties but not for groups, and I am a sucker for the bar tables where you can observe the chefs cook your food. However, the waitress wasn't particularly nice or enthusiastic - my guess would be that the restaurant was relatively understaffed.\\n\\nThere aren't a lot of choices on the menu, and we ordered the Mega Paitan, the most pricey (but still reasonable for dinner) option at $16 with the letters \\"BESTSELLER\\" helpfully printed next to it. We added a poached egg for $2, and there are a wide variety of toppings you can add ranging from avocado to scallion and wakame.\\n\\nAs for the ramen, I've had a lot better not only in Japan, but in Hong Kong, London and Boston as well. The taste and texture of the ramen noodles were admittedly on a similar level as those found in Japan, but the story goes downhill from here. The sheer number and variety of toppings in the bowl, especially red cabbage, distracted us from the relatively small portion of ramen noodles inside. There was simply way too much fat in the torched pork belly, to the point where taking a bite into it extinguished whatever appetite we had left. We found so much fat in the chicken broth, we could pick out congealed lumps of fat on the surface with our chopsticks as we tried to recuperate from the fattening meal. My food crawl buddy almost threw it all up in the restaurant - she's not used to consuming high amounts of fat and oil in a dish.\\n\\nOverall, Totto does have some redeeming qualities, but I cannot truly recommend it unless it changes the way they make their ramen, given the abundance of alternative choices available in Allston."},{"name":"Craigie On Main","address":"853 Main St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"I hate writing this review, but I had high expectations for Craigie on Main and am quite disappointed with my experience.

We did not have a waiter or waitress approach us to ask our drink order until 8:50pm.

Perfectly balanced flavors, well executed, really a lovely plate of food. \\n\\nEntree- swordfish. Undercooked and tasted really off. It was reminiscent of the low tide, fishy, barnacle flavor of the roe from the amuse bouche. I really think grilled swordfish with lemon on my father's grill tastes better than this super fishy disaster. It was a real low point in the meal and hugely disappointing. \\n\\nMy husband got the pork which he liked but was cold. As in not hot. \\n\\nDessert was very, very good!

It's stunning inside. They serve delicious food and boast a huge Belgian beer selection. There really is nothing quite similar to Chamber in this regard, which makes going there a unique experience. I like that.\\n\\nSo we impulsively went there for Sunday brunch. \\n\\nThomas (the boyfriend) ordered the Fricass√©e (Braised short ribs, balsamic cipollini onions, potatoes, watercress, fried eggs, applewood smoked cheddar) and I ordered the Tajine (Spicy merguez sausage, saffron tomato stew, fried pita, raita, poached eggs, fresh herbs).\\n\\nBoth were delicious but if I'm to be honest.... I kicked myself for not having ordered a few waffles instead. I don't know why I never ever order the waffles. I pretend¬†to not crave sugar in the morning, but I most evidently do. And their waffles look so delicious. No photos sadly... next time I will try to remember!\\n\\nHere are my 'Top Tips' for Sunday brunching at Chambar:¬†\\n\\n(1) Kind of a 'duh' tip but.... make a reservation if you'd like a table. Vancouver is notorious for long Sunday brunch line ups.¬†I don't know about you, but I don't do lineups. Especially when I am hungry.\\n\\n(2) If you're the carefree reservation-free type and want to eat before noon ... arrive early. Even if you intend on sitting at the bar. This place fills up fast, so sauntering in at 11am with no reservation is risky. We arrived at 10:45am and got sat in an area I didn't like - a narrow high-top ledge section that is teeming with 'service hustle & bustle'. As a Cancer-ascendant I especially don't like it when I have heavy traffic/ loud activity happening behind my back.\\n\\n(3) Alternatively, if you are a late-riser, swing by after the brunch-rush is over. Brunch is served from 8am to 3pm on Saturday & Sunday**. Even though this is a fairly large restaurant, with upstairs, downstairs and outdoor seating, you'd be surprised how crazy busy it can get between 11am - 2:00pm. Crazy busy and¬†a line of 20 people waiting outside for a table.\\n\\n(4) Go to the females' washroom... if you are of that gender. One of the nicest in Vancouver!¬† I won't give any more details... just go see it! :)\\n\\n(5) A side of Focaccia... is a must if you order the 'Tajine' for brunch. From the three bread options I tried; the¬†fried pita chips it came with, to the focaccia I pinched from my boyfriend's plate, to the sourdough side I added partway through the meal... the focaccia was the best. Hands down.\\n\\n(6) Enjoy the catwalk.¬†All the staff at this bistro have the best & more eclectic style ever. I almost never check out what restaurant staff are wearing, but I cannot help myself at Chambar!*** I swear they must list 'fashion sense' as a non-negotiable requirement on their job postings.\\n\\n(7) Leave the 'Bon Matin' alone if you are hungry.\\n\\nWell, that's all I have for now. All in all, a nice spot for brunch.... if you can get in! A dinner review of this place is definitely next on my list, haven't been there in the evening since last Summer!\\n\\n(*) Where the F is this? It's right by the 'Chinatown - Stadium' tube station. Referred to as 'Crosstown' by true, long-time-dwelling downtowners, this micro-hood is boxed in by these four others - historic Gastown (to the North), historic and cultural Chinatown (to the East), preppy Yaletown (to the South), and the alternatively charged Downtown Core (to the West).\\n\\n(**) The thought of a long busy shift like that still sends shivers down the spine of this lil ol' retired server. I sure had my fill of crazy-busy and long shifts in bars, clubs and restaurants.\\n\\n(***) The city is still recovering from a super bland 'all-black,¬†short and tight with heels'¬† omnipresent server look. So boring! I myself have noticed & personally experienced aspects of this, and seen a huge shift between 2008 - 2018 (the 10 years I have lived here)."},{"name":"Burger Tex","address":"5420 Airport Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"The bulgogi burger is hands-down my favorite sandwich in Austin.

It all starts with the Boar's Head meat (mmm hmm)...Grilled Pepperoni and Rotisserie Chicken \\"breasts's\\"...I won't go all into detail because it  REALLY has to be experienced, WITH THE DRESSING, TRUST ME!! I'm hungry for one now just writing this. I wonder could I get Tuesday's special on Thursday?? \\n\\nThe staff is VERY accommodating, always courteous and very efficient! You can trust their recommendations too.

I don't live near Georgia Tech so getting to this place was a bit of a drive, but I thought it was worth it. We went to this place twice in one week. Both times the pizza was delicious. The first time we got the lasagna pizza and it was tasty with the meat crumbles and blobs of ricotta. Wait was not very long which is nice. The pizza seemed very tasty and seemed authentic - I've had pizza in Italy and this was comparable. This pizza tasted way better than Fellini's pizza. Seating and parking was not hard because we went on a Tuesday a little bit after the time they opened (~11:45-12). We also visited the caffe and gelato/pastry shop, which was also nice. Good espressos and Italian pastries and gelato. I just wish they had the Italian hot chocolate. We split the pizza amongst 3 people so for me the price ($21) did not seem outrageous. The second time we went it was crazy packed (we went around 12 pm on Saturday). Parking was getting a little hectic, but I was able to find a spot right in front of the pizzeria. This place gets really crowded on the weekends.. just as a heads up. I expected this though, as families and people were not at work. We ordered the house special (Sophia - white pizza with carmelized onions, mushrooms, truffle oil, $27), and it came to us really fast. The price seemed pretty steep for this pie, but it was still enough for 3 people. Although I would probably just order the margherita or lasagna pie again. I like this place, and would probably go maybe once a month since it is a bit of a drive for me. The caffe and gio's and amalfi bar are also in this area and great to see.

(Granted, it was a Sunday evening.  From what other people have said, it seems like it's much more crowded on Friday/Saturday evenings and Sunday afternoon.)\\n\\nNow, my complaints.  First, all of the coffee was WAY overpriced.  Where else will a simple cup of coffee cost you almost $3.  And the coffee was only mediocre at best - I've had much better elsewhere.  Mozart's was also out of \\"hot coffee\\" lids which creates a bit of a problem when you're trying to take the cup in the car (which, at almost $3 a cup, you better take everything home with you!).  The desserts looked alright, but again, there are other places that specialize in dessert and are much better.  They also advertise Amy's Ice Cream, but they were out when I was there.\\n\\nSo go to Mozart's if you want the atmosphere.

Stopped by a few days later to check it out.\\n\\nWe were fortunate to get the last table for four upon our arrival at 10 min. to 5pm.   A line started forming right after we were seated.\\n\\nThis restaurant is quite small inside and accommodates maybe 50 people max.  The tables are very close to each other too.   We had to move our table in order for two of us to get to the other side by the windows to sit down.   You are nearly elbow to elbow with your fellow patrons.\\n\\nAnyway, we ordered the fried calamari and went for the large portion (just $3 more than the small).   It was as other Yelpers described.   Moist and tasty.  The pieces of fried chili added a nice kick to the dish.  We devoured this in minutes.\\n\\nWe also ordered the Lobster/muscles/clams with Linguini.  One order with Giacomo sauce and one with the Pesto.   In retrospect, we should have made one order with shrimp and scallops as I think we would have gotten a better variety of seafood.   Nevertheless, both were delicious, but the Giacomo sauce was the better of the two.  Lobster was good.  You can ask for more complimentary bread to sop up the pasta sauce.   \\n\\nThe 4th dish we ordered was the Chicken and broccoli Penne with creamy garlic sauce.  Highly recommended for those who cannot eat seafood (like my daughter).   She LOVED it!\\n\\nI think we had psyched ourselves out to enjoy and nice Italian meal our last night in Boston.   Therefore, Giacomo's satisfied us.\\n\\nOur waitress was nice but a bit forgetful.  She forgot to bring my glass of wine and was doing more PR than waitressing.  Maybe she wears two hats?

My boyfriend tried to tell me that I ordered the most bland pizza on the menu (Napoletana), but I had a pizza with the exact same toppings at Amalfi Pizza downtown and it was NOT bland. This sausage was bland, sauce had zero flavor, the buffalo mozzarella didn't taste like anything at all, the broccoli rabe was also tasteless. I don't get it. Also, it was cold. I figured out why you can't take off toppings or add to them, it's because they premake them and set it out waiting to be \\"heated up\\" when someone orders it.

It was almost twenty minutes before she came back to check on drinks and another 5-10 to get our food. The food wasn't cold but was not fresh and hot which was a bummer considering the food is already slightly overpriced. If the restaurant was busy I would've understood. But we were three or maybe like seven people. And the servers were standing around chatting the entire time.

I really really really wanted to like this place it is close by, very clean, and they have a great menu, but they just seem to screw up every time we've gone and today was the 2nd and last time I will go.  We went with my brother in law and his friend, my wife, and myself.  My brother in law and his friend seemed to like their sandwiches (caprese and something else not sure).  Their only complaint is that it's a little pricey for a flat bread sandwich and what they like to call a side salad (it's a joke of a salad imo, couple of pieces of field greens and a balsamic vinaigrette).  My wife and I go to order and my wife hates tomatoes.  She always asks for it on the side and no one ever has a problem doing that.  She ordered her sandwich and apparently if you order the Pick 2, it has to be a sandwich that has been sitting in the deli case for who knows how long.  The guy actually had the nerve to ask her if she minded if they just took off the tomato from one of the sandwiches or if she wanted it fresh?? Ummmm, why would she want a sandwich that has probably been sitting there all day with the tomato all squishy and gross when she can get a fresh one (and should be fresh regardless, do you see Panera doing this for their UPick 2?)  I was furious that he would even consider asking that question (I having been in the food industry would never even think about asking that), but my wife calmed me down and I ordered the Buffalo chicken sandwich.  It took a very long time for our food to come out even though it wasn't even busy, and we noted that there were 5 people behind the counter with maybe 3 of them doing absolutely nothing.  So the real nail in the coffin was after eating half my sandwich I was chewing and found a bone in my sandwich and not just a small bone.  I understand it is rotisserie, I understand it was probably freshly chopped.  The point is, you don't do that if you can't make sure all of the bones are out of the sandwich.  Having a bone in a chicken breast sandwich makes it inedible and a hazard.  If you found a bone in your fish fillet it would be inedible because of it.  Like I said I want to like this place, but for the prices they are charging I'd rather go to Panera, at least I know I'd get my money's worth.

Instant 2 stars there.\\n\\nThe server was knowledgeable, and knew the terms very well, he could work on his pronunciations, but well I could too. So I am not complaining.\\n\\nAmongst his recommendations was Biryani. I LOVE Biryani. It wasn't a hard choice and I was very happy. I ordered it with paneer, because who doesn't love paneer!! He then asked me how hot I wanted it. This is where my experience gets very interesting. He said they had 4 star system, 4 implying the hottest and 1 implying the mildest. Now my past experiences have told me that 4 is never hot enough at any of the Indian restaurants in this country. But since this was my first time here, I said 3 and that would help my palette judge the spiciness.\\n\\nOut came my food in about 10 minutes and it smelled delicious. I instantly dug in and was first hit by the immense flavor. You could taste the saffron, the onions were crispy  and the tomatoes fresh. It was absolutely delicious. However a few minutes later, I felt this thing in my mouth I had never felt before. Heat. Spice. Like the kind I have experienced in India only. Yeah, when they say hot, they mean HOT. Good thing there was raita on the side. Raita is a yogurt condiment which is usually served hot foods to compliment the flavor.\\n\\nAnother thing, the serving is massive, so one is good enough for at least 2-3 people and if you are eating along, worth 2-3 meals. That being said it is kinda pricey. But you get what you pay for. So thumbs up in my book!"},{"name":"Kika Tapas","address":"5 Broad Canal Way","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3","text":"I've dined here twice this year (2012) and been pleased both times.  The scallops in saffron cream, the baby spinach with raisins and pine nuts, and the chorizo were particularly good.

Old pubs that have become dorms, parks turned into condos, restaurants re-imagined only to fall short of their glory days. It's what you get with a historic city. You can now add Lower Depths to the list of places that used to be something special.\\n\\nA menu of unique tater tot concoctions like poutine, chili cheese, or shepard's pie, paired with hot dogs topped with beer cheese and potato chips or caramelized onions and mac 'n cheese (who would even think of these?) has been replaced with a selection of just a few average tacos. One basket of plain tots was kept, which feels more like a reluctant concession over customer backlash than an homage to the old menu.\\n\\nThe dogs and tots were a staple of the Kenmore food scene, offering a bit of the ballpark experience before heading to Fenway, or a late night round after the game let out. While the patio is still great, it was the combination of the location and the food that made it so much more than just a bar, forever enticing regulars to look past the fact it's cash-only. It was the kind of place you were glad you knew about, but hoped no one else did.\\n\\nI've been to almost every Marathon Monday here since it opened, and was sitting at the bar in 2013 when the bombs went off. For that reason, among many others, I will forever be attached to it. With such a dramatic departure from what it has always been known for though, it no longer feels like mine. Sometimes it takes more courage to keep things the way they are than to try something new. It's the same reason why the Citgo sign in Kenmore is revered - not because everyone loves gas, but because it's just always been there -- an old reliable landmark lighting up the night sky.\\n\\nIt's time to find a new spot -- one that stays true to itself and is loyal to its customers. It doesn't try to change and shake things up, it's just proud to be an old haunt.

My old fashioned was good, but had a little too much ice for my liking. Bread was brought out followed by an amuse bouche for each of us. Sadly, the bread wasn't warm when it arrived. It was tasty, but cold. I had a fried pig ear amuse bouche and my gf got scallops. Both were delicious. Our appetizers were both pleasing too. My steak was a little tough, but cooked suitably. My gf really enjoyed the cod. When I tasted it, I agreed that it was one of the better dishes of the night. We also opted to get the bone marrow side dish. Neither of us had had this before, and I had heard good reviews about it. We both thought it was a little too salty. However, that may just be how bone marrow is. We were brought a sorbet to cleanse our palates before dessert. It had a very strong lemon flavor. Almost too strong. My Taza chocolate coffee with ice cream came with a very nice presentation. It wasn't very unique or creative, but it was just what I needed after a large meal. My gf's torte was ok, but nothing special. \\n\\nOverall we thought the service was friendly and attentive.

Toilet seat is loose. Fancy faucet connected to the wrong type of sink bowl. Don't turn the water on too much or water everywhere. Hookah server inconsiderate of our request to order hookah. We have to tell the bartender we want to order hookah. Hookah server sends over hookah with bartender. No menu of flavors or even price. We had no option(s). Just \\"take it or leave it\\". Hookah server came  by apprx 30 minutes later. No hello/hi. However, just request for payment. Another bartender who seemed to be working our side of bar never greeted us but gave us 1 drink menu and sent another bartender apprx 25 min later to take our order. No sorry for the wait etc. The first bartender then went on to dance in a video posted to Instagram flaunting and counting one dollar bills. Just know my dollars did not go into making that video. However, do know gratuity is auto charged. In my head some locations do this bcz they know their service is sub par so they find a way to get those tips without earning them. \\n\\nI want to add by saying this. I looked into the owner(s) Instagram and the fact that expensive clothes, shoes etc are displayed does not mean you are familiar with a fancy lifestyle nor can recreate that lifestyle and make it a memorable experience for the customer. 2Chains and his business associates had the right idea.

For cold weather, the Cappelletti in Brood Soup is very comforting.  In regard to entrees, the Tagliatelli Pork Ragu was very good, but I much prefer this dish at Mucca in Downtown.\\n  \\nLuce seems to continue the trend of Italian venues that offer small, light dishes, rather than heavy gut bomb pasta bowls.

Delicious. But strange. \\n\\nMy friend and I found ourselves in the area and walked in around 6 PM on a Saturday. We were informed that since we didn't have reservations, a table would take about an hour. Or we could sit in the (near-empty) lounge and order immediately. Okay. Let's do that.\\n\\nThe lounge has huge TVs which played a variety of shows ranging from sports to reality TV. Random. And a little distracting. Also, it's in the part of the restaurant away from the water (which is unfortunate, considering \\"waterfront\\" is in the place's name), but otherwise the space seemed fine for a nice meal.\\n\\nNow I'd like to talk about the service. I don't exactly know how to put it, but the hostesses and waitresses just did not fit in with the restaurant's ambiance, food quality, or cost. The manager obviously looks for a very specific type of girl: mid-20's, pretty (in a heavily made up way), and of Italian descent (bordering on Jersey Shore-esque). Must be willing to wear tight, short sequined black skirts and impossibly high heels. Our server was very nice, albeit a bit fake-sounding. She (of course) recommended the more expensive specials and wine for our meal, but when we gave her an idea of what we wanted, she let us know of popular dishes and wine that seemed to fit that.\\n\\nAs for the food, it might just be some of the best Italian I've had in Boston. The bread they brought out was fresh and herby, and I couldn't stop dip dip dipping it in the accompanying olive oil. I was in a veal mood and (based on our waitress's recommendation) opted for the Il Fagottino, a veal medallion stuffed with proscuitto and fontina in a port wine sauce. Just yes. The portion wasn't huge, which was perfectly fine since I was already pretty full on bread, and the flavor was absolutely outstanding. But, for $27, it damn better be. Luckily I wasn't disappointed.

Didn't quite realize the size on either.  Now one could say that the prices are a little bit premium here, and ok, yes they are.  But in both dishes, the food experience was Premium.  In addition, the amount of food was also worth it. The wagyu beef, which we cooked for ourselves on a hot stone over a shichirin grill had enough peices for both of us to share, as well as a couple slices of kabocha squash, peppers (which thankfully were not spicy), and garlic that all grilled beautifully as well.  Then there was the sukiyaki.  That stew was a monster! It could have fed 3 easily, and it had plenty of meat, mushrooms, veggies, and noodles.  It also comes uncooked, and is prepared at the table, with more ingredients added as you remove the cooked ones from the pot. And it was delicious, as well.  We had the last 1/3rd of the ingredients and broth packed up to save for another day, although we will probably dilute the stock since it became pretty concentrated from simmering throughout the meal.

They were out of several items since they were waiting for a food delivery so I couldn't order the sweet potato fries that I heard so much about. I ordered the homemade chips instead.

But even if you aren't, for the prices you pay here you should expect better service.\\n\\nWas service terrible, no...just disappointing. Saturday night, prime dinner hour, downtown Boston, and the place was pretty empty. That made us worried right off the bat. We waited for awhile for the server to come over and when he does he said that he would take our drink and food order. So this is where the high maintenance part kicks in. Unless I'm bellying up to the counter at McDonald's I don't want to give you my drink and food order at the same time. Sorry. Call me old fashioned.\\n\\nI order a whiskey sour to start and as I prepare myself for the 'what type of whiskey' question, instead I get 'on the rocks?'. Really? Really? When in the history of Western Civilization has a whiskey sour not been served on the rocks? Apparently the waiter was a mind reader beyond that point because he obviously knew what kind of whiskey I wanted since he never bothered to ask. The waiter then started to take the wine glasses off the table then asked if we were going to drink wine, when we said that we were with dinner the promptly put the glasses back. My momma always told me, once it leaves the table it doesn't go back. If he was so eager to clear the space why not just bring back new glasses when we ordered the wine?\\n\\nAnother thing that annoyed me was that the generic bread basket was served with olive oil for dipping, but each and every table setting in the place had a bread plate and butter knife laid out. Yet, no butter was brought out with the bread or anywhere to be seen for that matter. Small detail yes, but it made no sense and with 10000000000000 restaurants in Boston, isn't it the small details that matter?\\n\\nThe one saving grace was that the food was actually very good, though the dessert menu was pretty sparse. Having Finale a few doors down probably makes dessert here a non-issue anyway, but we did take a peak at the menu. Another 'small' detail that make me chuckle was the fact that it's the first week of November and they have a dessert featuring 'summer berries'.

When we arrived, we've been told we have to wait. Guess how long we've waited for? 45 freaking minutes. That doesn't even make sense to me if I had to wait for 45 mins, what is the point of make reservation for!!! \\n\\nThe second time, I was just called in the restaurant trying to find out whether my friends and I can do a walk-in dining, just this ONE SIMPLE question. The guy who picked up the phone didn't even give me a chance and put me straight on hold. 12 mins later, I was STILL on hold and he is nowhere to be found. I hung up and called again, this time a woman picked up, I asked before she had the chance to put me on hold again. It took her 3 seconds to answer it. So that was a total of 57 mins of my life wasted on nothing.\\n\\nWhat happened today is just a plain disappointment and I don't think I will ever go back again. As I was walking my dog and worn a very casual jacket nothing fancy, I pass by the restaurant and it was about 4 pm so the restaurant wasn't even busy. I thought I will just do a quick pick up for their cheesecake and I leashed my dog outside and went in. I told the front desk woman I want to do a pickup, and she told me to go to the bar to make the order. I was going to ask if she can keep an eye on my dog while I go in and shouldn't take longer than 5 mins. The woman didn't even let me finish my sentence and rudely interrupted me with an impatient attitude, telling me (and pointing the bar) I have to go in myself, she can't do that for me. (she probably thinks I was going to ask her to place the order and bring it out for me). She also gives out that vibe of thinking she is up and beyond and I'm too low of a class for her.\\n\\nNo one deserves to be treated like this anywhere in any restaurant, not to mention the money you will spend.

Crab cake was on top of two rather large lettuce pieces which made the crab cake break apart. Shredded lettuce would have been so much better.

Anyway, the antipasto was good, a a fair variety of meat, peppers, olives and cheese, just the right size for a one person appetizer. Had a special--spaghetti with shrimp, scallops and clams.

Totto is pretty small, cash only and because it's so small, it can get glasses-fogged-up-steamy.  Now that the cons are out of the way, let's talk about the pros.  I didn't want to eat anything heavy so I ordered the spicy tuna don, which is listed as a \\"small appetizer\\", but it's actually a decent size.  They give you tons of tuna (mixed with mayo, ofc) and it's only $6.50.  That's kindof a steal, in my opinion.  Normally I wouldn't like a dish like this because of the excess mayo, but the scallions and the pickled cucumbers cut through the mayo-i-ness, so I actually really enjoyed it.  \\n\\nAs for the ramen, my friend ordered the miso ramen and he was nice enough to give me half.  It was good, but not amazing.  If I compare it to Pikaichi, the broth isn't as flavorful at Totto and the serving size is smaller.

I didn't time it, but I do think that's about how long it took. While I was waiting, I heard him call out a pumpkin curry order! I love pumpkin curry and had mad food envy!

They also have wine and some cocktails as well.  \\n\\nFood-wise, they have some regular entrees but their main action is on the left side of the menu which is a series of food paste, cheese and condiment.

The chicken liver mousse was delicious - I wish I could get more bread because I literally just started to eat it with a spoon.

Having been to and enjoyed the previously Cafe de Paris we were a little saddened to see its passing..only momentarily until I glared over the menu of Le Parisien.\\n\\nSpace and layout is pretty much intact from the remains of the predecessor while the row of tables on the far wall feel more spacious than what we remember. The decor is refreshed and is rid of the wooden-clad overalls of before.\\n\\nThe menu items were a highlight for us and it is easy to go way overboard here. We balked at making too much of a dent to the fresh, crusty house bread and started out with the roasted bone marrow AND the smoked chicken liver and foie gras parfait in which my gf aptly declared as by far, her favourite menu items to date. The bone marrow is rather self-explanatory (amazing) while the parfait denotes subtle smokey hints underneath the over the top richness and creaminess. Sadly, both appetizers lacked enough baguette/crostini so the house bread came in handy. We split the cote de boeuf, a 20+oz fatty bone-in rib steak and made all the better when the gueridon arrived tableside for slicing and serving. The accompanying gratin dauphinois, nicely roasted mushrooms and carrots round out the dish. A couple of points to pick at here, however. First, the steak was overdone past our medium rare and well into medium territory. Second, the steak and mushrooms were well overseasoned and, hopefully an isolated incident. We finished off our unrestrained meal with a chocolate mousse and creme brulee. I likened the salted caramel sauce as it draws out the dark chocolate whereas the creme brulee eases out the palette. Both are good but overall fairly standard fare these days.\\n\\nService is markedly attentive. Constant checkups and water fillups by the wait staff while the front of house hostess makes her rounds through and through.

We had about an hour wait at it's neighboring sister restaurant - Port 305... so we decided, hey, there's no one sitting over there, they look like they've got some room, let's grab some drinks while we wait.\\n\\nThat was the biggest mistake we could have possibly made.  There was definitely a reason for the empty space.  If I could give this place ZERO stars, I would.\\n\\nIt took a little while for our waitress to come over and take our drink orders.  About 10 minutes later, there she is... we order a round. The drinks were at least tasty.  She did come by periodically to check in on us.  Another round of beverages and a few appetizers to curb some of the partygoer's hunger before dinner was ordered.  The service was was par for the course ... in the lack of urgency department.  My boyfriend's Capt & Coke arrived about 20 minutes after everyone else's 2nd round came by.  But again, the apps and drinks were just fine.  \\n\\nTab time.  Our table was ready at Port 305, so a majority of the partygoers headed over, threw in some cash, and my boyfriend, his friend, and I handled the payment of said tab.  Boyfriend and I split some of the cost on our bank cards, put the rest of the cash down, saving some for the tip (which we later regret putting down).\\n\\n10 minutes later, the black book with our sales receipts come back.  We are almost home free.  I sign my slip, boyfriend signs his, I reach for our cards and... hmmm... mine's missing.  We asked our waitress where my card had gone and if she could go look for it.  It's my bank card, she is responsible for bringing it back to me, and after all, it was my only source of funds for the weekend.  Her response - \\"I put it back in the book\\".  Well... no you didn't... so we asked her again to please look for my card.  Her response - \\"I don't know, I put it in the book\\".  Did it ever occur to her that it may have fallen out when she swiped my card at the cash register?!  \\n\\nMy boyfriend's friend intervened and suggested she go through the black books at the register to see if she put it in one by mistake.  The reluctance to complete said task was mind-boggling.  After 10-15 minutes of this nonsense, she pretended to scope out the floor with her little LED flashlight.  She comes back with the manager on duty (blonde female).  They started to imply that perhaps, I dropped my card on the dock,  because the waitress \\"swears\\" she put it in the book.  Well, how did this slip by 3 intelligent people who witnessed the original opening of the black book to find that my card was MIA?  It was almost as if they were trying to put the blame on me for the missing bank card caper.  The manager says, \\"We can give you a call IF (not WHEN) we find your card\\"  I reached my boiling point.  Needless to say, I flipped out.  No one  wanted to help and would not take responsibility for the waitress' careless error.  After my \\"flip out\\" I was told that I was no longer welcome in the establishment and that I would have to be escorted out.  \\n\\nRidiculous!!  As my body was attempting to stop shaking from anger, disgust, disappointment, and frustration, the manager from Port 305 (Port 305, Siros, and Blue have the same owner), who apparently had witnessed the situation, intervened and told me that he would make sure our tab was taken care of.  Finally, someone, who did not even manage this establishment, was eager to help.  He told me he'd call/text WHEN he found my card.\\n\\nAs we sat an hour into our meal at Port 305, the manager (I believe his name is Mike) came over, with my bank card in hand (which I immediately cancelled after the fiasco next door) and told me he found it UNDER the trash.  Hmm... sounds a little supsicious to me.  Either way, my card was cancelled, so I didn't actually have to pay for that horrible experience in the end.\\n\\nCan anyone believe this??  I will never go back to either of those restaurants, even Port 305.

Pretty tasty. I got the paneer tikka masala and regular naan. I ordered it one spice level below the highest level. It was HOT. But still tasty. The texture of the paneer was great as well. Some other places use paneer with weird texture, so I was pleasantly surprised. The basmatti rice that accompanied the meal had a sweetness that balanced out the spice. Whatever they used to sweeten it was delightful. It didnt taste like sugar sweet. More like clove sweet. The naan was a bit crispy, but that wasn't a big deal. Still tasted great dipped in the masala. And it was a large portion of naan as well.\\n\\nThe overall portion was huge and I actually got two meals out of it. Great price for the portion size.\\n\\nI actually got locked out of my home when I went to pick it up. I had to wait 30 mins for someone to let me into my home to get my keys.

I usually seek out boutique or historic hotels instead of staying at a big chain.  I like the quirks of places like this and they usually are in fun parts of town and fit my price range all at the same time.\\n\\nFrom the outside the building is great old architecture.  It is a wedge shaped building full of 51 rooms and the Zeus Cafe.  Also there is a \\"soaking pool\\" downstairs that we did not have a chance to visit but I assume it is a jacuzzi?  You walk into the main door and the small front desk is right there with very helpful employees to serve you.  The tiny elevator is to the right as is a stair case.\\n\\nThe rooms are all themed after bands that have played at the Crystal Ballroom which is a block down the street.  I only recognized 2 out of the 51 bands in the themes so I assume a lot of them are local to Portland.  Our room was small and very dark but very cute and well decorated.  The \\"closet\\" consisted of a shelf on the wall with a 2 ft metal rod hanging below it as well as a few hat hooks.  There was no TV but the wifi was strong.  We had one window with a view of 12th street (and the adult toy store below).  There is a small sink in the room because the bathrooms are out in the hall.  A few of the rooms do have a King bed and a private bathroom but I only think there are a couple of those.  The bed was ok but very creaky and I actually was awoken by the neighbors bed creaking in the middle of the night.  One night there was a Halloween party going on downstairs so I also got to hear someone having a big emotional break-up out in the street around 3am.  The windows are single paned so the street noise come through.  \\n\\nThe public bathrooms are sparkling clean.  I have never stayed somewhere without a private bathroom before but the fact these were so clean, made it not difficult to deal with.  Waking up in the middle of the night and having to roam the hall half asleep was a new experience.  \\n\\nLocation is great in the Pearl District of Portland.  Powell's books is a block away, loads of tasty places to eat and artsy shops.  20 minute walk to the Amtrak station.\\n\\nWe only ate one meal at the Zeus Cafe downstairs.  They were swamped but did the best they could with being short on employees.  If you are into doughnuts, try Blue Star a block up the street, amazing!\\n\\nI give it 3 stars because I very rarely give a 5 and I don't feel it deserves a 4.

That is why I was so excited when this new shop opened in Buckhead.  I am a Thrillist subscriber and that is how I found out about it.  I ran by it on my Sunday run and was sad that it was closed but went in on a Saturday afternoon for a midday snack.  When you walk in, the store is a bit bare but it's only 6 weeks old so you have to give it a chance.  You know that you are in the right place when you have been inside for 5 minutes and two different customers come in saying \\"I'm back again!\\" followed by chuckles. \\n \\nThe Management team is great - there were two employees working and they were friendly but also remembered their customers.  You are able to sample any of the popcorn.  When I went on Saturday there were six varieties - butter, sea salt, spicy BBQ, pimento cheese, kettle and a seasonal variety of pumpkin.  While it is not posted on their website, you can buy small, medium or large bags and are not required to buy a tin size.  The prices start at $4.99 which is fair seeing as they do not merely just fill the bag and close it, they put popcorn in the bag, compress it and continue to fill.  You are really getting a terrific value for the cost and you can create your own combinations. \\n \\nI purchased a small kettle/salted caramel mix and a medium pimento cheese/BBQ mix.  The kettle corn was a perfect sweet and salty combination.  The salted caramel was also delicious.  They complemented each other nicely in the bag but remained separated, flavorwise.  The spicy barbeque was zesty and really had a kick.  If you do not like spicy, then you should stay away but adventurous eaters should definitely take note.  I have only had spicy BBQ flavor once before and that was out of a bag from Popcorn Indiana but I have not been able to find it anywhere in Atlanta.  The Pimento Cheese flavor was also pretty dynamite.  It reminded me of my mom's pimento cheese sandwiches that I haven't had in ages. \\n \\nWhat I enjoyed about the experience was the friendly staff.  They really do whatever they can to please the customer, even taking ideas for their next flavor.  They put the customer first, they are thorough and they provide a unique experience that you do not find very often.  I like that they only have a few flavor options because they spend the time to perfect what they do have and you don't get overwhelmed by choices.  I hope that Caja is here for the long-haul.

We tried the eye catching ultimate experience option. One person in our party of four does not eat beef so we advised them of that. Not sure that was the reason, but our table ended up with seafood after seafood. We kinda expected more variety. The seafood entrees didn't end until after one of us started choking on fish bone. Think they started panicking as our dining experience got pretty awkward. Fortunately, they probably got the message that we are not huge fans of strict seafood diet, so we finally got the good stuff. We all had beef while the non cow eater had a chicken dish.

The staff was super friendly, and they had a ton of baked goods in their cases. I was overwhelmed, but we got a couple of additional things to sample while we were there; a cupcake and two pastries. As someone who normally eats the icing off of the cake and throws the rest of the cake away (admitting it is the first step), I was pleased enough to eat the whole cake.

It can be hard finding really inspiring vegetarian food that is also gluten-free, but ever since I discovered Walnut Cafe's Dana Tempeh Skillet I have been one happy girl. We no longer live in Boulder, but whenever we come to visit the in-laws we will make sure to stop by this place so I can get my fix of this delicious dish.\\n\\nDana's Tempeh Skillet has tempeh, mushroom, onion, tomato and potatoes fried together topped with cheese and deliciousness and it is perfect with a side of fresh fruit and seasoned with a little ketchup. I daydream about this dish when I'm not in Boulder. I've tried the tofu scramble and it just isn't my thing, which is funny because I used to love the \\"farmer's eggs with tofu sub\\" at Dot's Diner before I became stressed about their love of putting gluten biscuits on top of their potatoes on the grill. (Not sure if they still do this; I notice Dot's now offers GF options so maybe I should check it out again.) I've tried the Walnut Cafe omelets and did enjoy them although they were a trifle rich (but very good). But when it comes down to it, I just have to order Dana's tempeh skillet. I love it so much!\\n\\nI love the relaxed boulder atmosphere of this place with funky artwork and cool wait staff. I also really appreciate that they offer all kinds of yummy coffee espresso drinks. Just reading the menu makes me happy.\\n\\nLast time we also ordered off what I think was the kids menu for my 3 year old-- I was impressed because I felt that it wasn't as dumbed down as many kids' menus and was more reasonable portions of adult food.

Located in Midtown Atlanta, this pizza place caters to college student and Atlanta native alike.  When you first walk in you are greeted by the drink refrigerators (serving flavored pellegrino) and the dessert case with tiramisu and empty cannoli shells waiting to be filled upon order.  You place your order at the register from one of nine specialty pizzas and calzones.  My favorites include the Pomodorini with blistered cherry tomatoes, buffalo mozzarella, garlic, and basil; the Capricciosa with mushroom artichokes and prosciutto; the Bianca, or white pizza; the Napoletana with broccoli rabe; and obviously the classic Margherita.  \\n\\nWhile you wait for you pizza, you then scout for a seat in the dining room, which is rows of picnic benches and tables, high tops, and a private dining room set in front of the pizza kitchen.  Here you have a full view of your pizza being made by the pizza chefs in front of the giant wood-fired ovens.  Along the walls are the giant sacks of flour and doors to the walk-in where they let the pizza dough rise.  Warning:  It is ALWAYS PACKED.  Therefore, it might take longer to get a seat than your pizza.  But since people are always coming and going, you will eventually find a spot. \\n\\nHave I forgotten to mention the best part-- it's BYOB.  Yes that's right, no corkage fee and bring as much booze as you'd like.  Forget your corkscrew?  No worries, the strangers at your table have just become your best friends.  I'm sure they'll let you borrow theirs!\\n\\nAnother one of my favorite aspects is the topping bar.  Separating the kitchen from the dining room is a bar lined with containers of freshly grated parmesan cheese, roasted red pepper flakes, chili infused olive oil, minced garlic, black pepper, and fresh basil all to customize your pizza the way you want it. \\n\\nPizza Antico can be perfect for big groups and parties or a casual date night.

I had my heart set on dinner in the North End, however. \\n\\nThe location--a block off Hanover--boded well, close enough to soak up the energy and atmosphere of the North End, but far enough off the main drag to suggest that the restaurant doesn't simply count on the flow of tourist traffic to draw diners. Terramia is small and intimate and, like other reviewers note, romantically charming, particularly decorated for Christmas. I was also impressed with the curtain in front of the door to keep the draft out when people came in and out.\\n\\nWe started with the antipasto platter, which was lovely, followed by a delicious chestnut truffle soup.

If I eat there, it's always solo, so I have plenty of time to watch the other patrons pick up their to-go food or have it sent out for delivery. \\n\\nThe food is Americanized Chinese, but in the greatest comfort food way. The chicken tends to be dark meat, some of the sauces have too much sugar for me, there could be more chilies in items that are supposed to be spicy, and they can be a little skimpy on the seafood. On the other hand, their soups are great/consistent and I have gone there multiple times just for the Hot & Sour soup. You can get a large bowl for pretty cheap and add a scoop of fried rice and you have a whole meal. I always get the steamed dumplings with the soup because the dipping sauce is so great and it has lots of yummy chopped garlic. I love this food for it's overall genuine mediocrity. \\n\\nThey serve various textures of tofu depending on the dish (I eat a lot of tofu so this matters to me), the  prices are reasonable (cheap) and the Lunch specials are very decently priced. I get the Szechwan Style Tofu with Sliced Pork, which is essentially Ma Po Tofu, most of the time, but the Pork in Garlic Sauce is a close second - both are around $7-8 bucks including rice. The Sesame Chicken and the General Tso's are fairly generic, but decently tasty if that's what you are looking for.

There wasn't anything wrong with the preparation of the fish, just the kind of fish wasn't my thing.\\n\\nWhen my cousin's dish came out, the shrimp were a bit undercooked. We motioned our waitress over, who immediately offered to remake the dish. Then another waitress came over who must have been one of the owners, because she assured us that the dish would be out pronto. It was, and it was cooked to perfection the second time. To top it off, as soon as we were done eating, the waitress offered to comp us dessert. We told her it was unnecessary, given that our meal was so delicious. She insisted, and we finally gave in. Since we were too full to eat any more, she sent us home with a slice of their chocolate cake with passionfruit cream. (I found out at home that the cake was DELICIOUS.

It was dry, gray, and lacked any kind of flavor, sliced so thinly that there was no hint of bark. The sides were fine. The coleslaw vinegary and tangy, the potato salad interesting. The beans, meh. At the end of our meal, we heard a man ask ways he could get brisket. The waitress (ours too) told him lean or burnt ends. Maybe we could have used that info. Maybe it could have been on the menu.

Buyer beware!! \\n\\nAbout my experience: It has been a few years since I ordered anything from this place and I had actually forgotten how bad they actually are (food and service), boy was I reminded! Placed an online order (right on their site) of General Gao's Chicken (with 2 extra crab rangoons for .95) etc for pickup. \\n\\nThe website quoted me $8.01  (.51 mass sales tax) and here I was able to enter my credit card information for billing online etc, specifying my wish ****well in advance*** with my order  to pay with my visa as the site itself permits/took my info.\\n\\nGet to the restaurant I am greeted by a Chinese man who goes and gets my order and totals me at $8.05 - first red flag. I then tell him, \\"hey I entered my credit card information online.\\" He tells me, \\"Do you have the card? I need the card.\\" My response was OK, no biggie right?! \\n\\nThis woman then comes out from the kitchen and joins the Chinese guy, they both begin questioning me if I \\"would rather pay cash,\\" - second red flag.to which I SAID NO, I WOULD NOT RATHER PAY CASH. They continue hustling me to pay cash and state at this time, \\"It is a $15.00 minimum on credit cards.\\" My response was, I was aware of NO SUCH RULE, neither does your website say anywhere that I must pay cash when ordering less then $15.  Next, I was dumbfounded of the fact they continued to insist that I pay cash, (3 times) at which point I nearly walked out. At this point I handed the Chinese man my credit card, which he ran for the $8.05 \\n\\nFOOD QUALITY- third red flag: As if the above experience was not poor enough, the food quality was horrendous. The two crab rangoons tasted absolutely bland, perhaps the worse crab rangoon I have ever had and I have had plenty. It was more like 2  very plain, tasteless cream cheese rolls. The rice had no flavor whatsoever, it was so bland and cheap it felt like pure garbage! The Chicken was the only average ingredient in this whole meal, since the spices made up for the fact the rest of it sucked. I would never set foot in this establishment again. \\n\\nConclusion: So, not only was there a discrepancy in the total amount from my online order to me physically being at this place (even if only 4 cents, it is the principle and it is dishonest), there was also what I like to call a \\"hustle\\" for me to pay cash, that is just shady. Hmmm... ...talk about reason for the IRS to take a close look here. Lastly, the most unforgiving: the actual food quality. Overall this was a BAD experience!!

I had the special of the night, the Sea Bass with Asparagus on a mound of garlic mashed potatoes - the mash was actually really good, as was the fish, although it came in a sauce that was a bit too sweet for my liking (scraped it off everything).

The cheese were mild yet smokey and a great pick as first-timers here. The chorizo was thinly sliced but don't be fool, it was packed with flavors you can't miss it. I was planning to order additional meats, but after that first bite, it wasn't necessary anymore. The board also came with Dijon mustard spread, and pickled cucumbers (not pickles) which were my absolute favorite I can eat that alone all day! My board combinations were fantastic and I wouldn't have it any other way, especially when the honey is drizzled on top it balances out the acidity of those cucumbers. Loved it! \\n\\nFor the main course, our waitress recommended the fettuccine nero pasta, which they make in house with cocoa dough, wild boar rag√π, juniper, and pecorino. I love the color of the pasta, it is a beautiful rich ash brown that I've never seen anywhere else. The boar meat is salty (hence salty pig duh right) against the savory sauce and pasta.

Apparently, this is as close to authentic Thai food in Portland as you can get. \\n\\nI have never eaten any Thai food before, and as a first-time eater, there were a lot of intimidating smells and flavor profiles which gave me hesitation (not a fan of fish). That being said, don't bring your partner here if they are allergic to fish or shellfish- pretty much everything is related to fish!\\n\\nDespite the seafood smell, the flavors were bright and exciting. \\n\\nTheir fish sauce wings are part of what got them famous, for good reason! The fish smell is misleading because it doesn't taste too much like it (yay, chicken is chicken), and you are greeted with a warm saltiness with depth.\\n\\nThe Pork Belly was my favorite pork belly so far, and is best eaten with a spoon.. butI'm not the biggest fan of eating with a spoon like true Thai (so I'm told), so I ate with sticky rice and bare hands as utensils. The bare hands really helped when we ordered that fully cooked chicken. \\n\\nDeep saltiness seems to be a running theme with their food and sauces, and it really is a wonderful thing to experience a heavy salty flavor that doesn't appear at the tip of your tongue. Must have been salt from beyond the Twilight Zone.\\n\\nService was fantastic, although being the first people in the door for dinner service helped. The guy with the rainbow gel pens was awesome, and helped us find local breweries, as well as give us some info on their amazing rhubarb shandy. \\n\\nI was hesitant at first, given the few negative reviews, but this food is tasty!! Would go again on a special occasion because I'm still a flavor pansy and my girlfriend has shellfish allergies.

My friends and I ordered a \\"extra large\\" pizza and a Greek salad. The Greek salad was described as having three ingredients: lettuce, kalamata olives, and feta. It definitely had lettuce (TONS OF IT), and it had some feta, but they weren't kalamata olives. They were normal black olives that tasted like they came out of a jar. They even call this the \\"Great Greek Salad.\\" If I was Greek, I would take all sorts of offense to that. Not the worst salad ever made, but I would never ever pay for it again.\\n\\nCompared to the pizza, however, the salad was amazing. The pizza was TERRIBLE. It is called extra large, I guess because it has a lot of width? However, it is so thin that I bet the amount of dough used was much closer to a small pizza anywhere else than an \\"extra large\\" at this place. We ordered a pizza with prosciutto and figs. There were honestly two small pieces of prosciutto on the entire pie, and maybe one fig that was cut up into three pieces. I thought one of my friends had pulled a prank by taking the toppings off of it. \\n\\nAnd the pizza itself was no better, arguably worse, than a DiGiorno. Get a clue. And for $17?

For instance, Saag or Baingan Bhartha generally have a certain amount of cream in them... the more cream, the worse the taste, because it drowns out the vegetable and actual spiciness of the dish.  Our versions of each had very limited cream in them... if any at all... making what are typically heavier Indian dishes light and incredible.  \\n\\nThe spice level at medium was perfect for me because my taste is accustomed to a higher level of spice... but a typical person might not like how spicy the food is... use that as a warning.  If you like spicy and flavorful, this place is your spot.\\n\\nThe service was also excellent.  The staff and owners were super kind and really receptive to us.
