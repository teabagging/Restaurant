I was shocked that a patron was able to sit her dog in the bar chair ar the bar where patrons were eating (he was not in a bag or on the floor...on a SEAT at the BAR) A couple sitting close to the party of people were so disgusted, they made a comment and moved to the other end of the bar.  Others came behind them and also saw the dog and moved. When the bartender was questioned about it, he proceeded to speak to the party when one of the ladys decided to shout obscenities at us very loud and rude.  She went on for about 15 mins.  The manager did nothing to accomodate us nor did he offer an apology.  All he stated was if he heard anyone hollering obscenities they would be removed.  Well she continued on, and he did nothing.  The bartenders did a great job trying to  diffuse the situation and they had great customer service, however, the manager on duty did not act as if he wanted to deal with the situation and made the visit very unpleasant for all of the bar patrons.  I think he may have been familiar, even friends with the group of women.  \\nI found this experience to be highly disappointing and was disgusted that someone had a dog sitting where I was dining.  Totally blew my appetite and experience\\n As much as I love this restaurant and the this location is within walking distance to my home, I will not be visiting this location again.

I had been to the other location that is inside of the same hotel and it is very classy and always a great experience.  I think it all depends on the management staff and enforcing the rules.

We had heard a lot about it, and it is a very lovely space tucked into the Manor Road area. Reservations and greeting went fine, and we passed on the mixed drinks to concentrate on the food, so no comments there! Our waitress was attentive and explained everything very well. She also kept our water glasses filled even though there was a bottle on the table, which was nice!\\n\\nChecking out the menu, we noted that a la carte could get extremely pricey, extremely fast, so we agreed to go with the Supper Club Mixed Grill  at $95 including dessert and coffee or tea.  This choice is evidently a fixture on Saturday nights, so check other nights because the selection will be different.\\n\\nOur meal started out with a lovely beef and vegetable soup with cheesy dumplings. It was savory, filling, and the dumplings were just the right touch. \\n\\nOur second course was the beet, radish salad and a good sized platter of MEAT. When they say mixed grill, they aren't kidding!  The selection was wonderful, but the quality of the preparations was uneven.\\n\\nWinners: Venison kabobs. Tender, really flavorful and seasoned just right. The Pork Chop. Again, tender with a little crunch on the outside and beautifully seasoned and presented. The potatoes were good but making them cheesy would have taken them over the top.  My husband liked the chicken, but I found it very tasteless. The sausage was okay, but needed mustard, which we requested.\\n\\nLosers: The Salad. It was fresh, but that is the only good thing I can say about it. Large pieces of lettuce and slices of watermelon radish overwhelmed it, and it was incredibly under-dressed. I kept searching in vain for the slightest pop of acid that could redeem it.  The hangar steak was cooked well, but there was very little of it and it was under seasoned. Skip it and save your stomach capacity for the other meats and leave room for the desserts!\\n\\nWinners Again: Great desserts: I had a bread pudding with goat's milk caramel sauce that had me wanting to lick the plate, and my husband went for the butternut squash empanada with a lovely vanilla sauce. They were both excellent, but the dessert experience fell down when it came to the drinks. The supper club meal comes with the choice of a coffee that sounded really good (but had caffeine) or a tisane that did not have caffeine.  Dai Due, PLEASE offer a decaf coffee to your guests with this meal.

Nicks Food to go is located in a semi sketchy area close to the mystical Oakland cemetery. Plenty of parking in their gravel lot. I was pretty pumped to try this place out after reading all of the stellar yelp reviews. The place where you order and wait for you food is tiny and cramp. The waiting area reminded me of impound with its cheap cracked beige linoleum flooring, and drab decor. Not exactly sexy and can be full of some riff raff. So the atmosphere gets a huge pfffffftttttt. The girl that took our order probably hated her life, just didn't seem very happy. I got the Slovakia Gyro and Ms. Wonderful got the Greek Lasagna. It took us a while to get our order, and everyone else's order took quite sometime. My Gyro was okay and the takizi sauce was good, but not out of this world. It really just tasted like they smothered it in greek dressing. It was overstuffed (not such a bad thing) and was hard to keep together. I'll compare this place to Mediterranean Grill in Decatur in Piedmont park and Mediterranean grill whoops this place. They have the excellent Hummus, Kufta Kabob, and Lamb shank as above average food. Seriously Nick's can't hold the jock strap of nearly every fast food Mediterranean grill in Atlanta. The fries I had with my Gyro weren't Greek potatoes and were piss poor. I tried the Greek Lasagna and it had a strong cinnamon taste as I've never had my Greek lasagna with a cinnamon taste.

The student lounge I never really had. The default option when classes got canceled. The end-of-the-week recuperation destination of choice. Almost the biggest heartbreaker (but not the biggest surprise) when Emerson announced they were purchasing the property, but definitely the hugest relief when they got their lease extended.\\n\\nAs a bar, it's kind of standard. Cheap beer, passable cocktails, don't know why anyone would drink wine here. It's got pretty basic atmosphere: TVs with the game on, Big Buck Hunter, a DJ playing the same forty songs upstairs Thursday nights, sometimes bands or mashup DJs downstairs. The menu consists of pretty average fare: nachos, sweet potato fries, burgers, a standout grilled cheese and tomato soup. Nothing really too special.\\n\\nYou know what, though? Looking back on my time spent at Sweetwater as an Emerson kid, it's a pretty great place to kick back with a few good friends at the end of the day, drink a few pitchers of PBR, order the menu item with the most melted cheese, shoot a couple virtual impala, rock out to dumb songs from the '90s and walk out several hours later, declaring to Boylston Place that Sweetwater may be just an average bar, but God dammit, it's OUR average bar."},{"name":"Caf√© Margaux","address":"220 Brevard Ave","city":"Cocoa","stars":"4.5","text":"We arrived in a downpour and the staff were quick to get us inside under cover.

They remember me.. AND, most importantly, they remember my favorite wines. Even if I haven't been in awhile.  I love that.  Time for a happy dance (performed inwardly as to spare others from a few moments of complete awkwardness.)  I must say it's sad so many people know about this place I once called \\"a hidden gem.\\"  It can get crowded, especially on Thursday, but for good reason!\\n\\nAnd here are my thoughts on their food and drink in a list form:\\n\\nFood... what we've tried, that is.\\n\\nHummus = excellent.  It's a must on each visit.\\nThe Sliders  = lovely, and the presentation makes them even MORE so.\\nMacaroni and Cheese = Not a huge truffle oil fan, but many seem to enjoy it who join me for wine nights...\\nSalad = They've now created a salad for me, as I tend to be one of those who revamps them.  So, for that reason it's a winner.\\nNachos = It's a crazy mix! Lot's of things atop chips.  I'm not the biggest fan of the smoked chicken, but if you like nachos there is no reason not to give their rendition a try!\\n\\nThere are many other dishes I've not listed.  I'll save them for another posting.\\n\\nAnd now to wine. Being one who will always prefer red, I never hesitate to ask for recommendations and tastes of a few from their list.  I can tell you the one I want EVERY TIME (The Priorat - Lovely with a capital L!) But sometimes my credit card disagrees, and I try something a little lower priced.  There are so many, but my favorite thing to say when asking is \\"I would like to try the freshest heavy red you have today.\\"  And I go from there.  The Carmenere is delicious, and I've had the Cuvee' Presidente on more than one occasion.  \\n\\nThere are whites, of course, and beer - something for everyone!"},{"name":"The Original Dinerant","address":"300 SW 6th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Meh.

The environment is nice, and the wait staff was friendly, if slow.  Clean bathroom and low cheese factor on their \\"Japanese\\" motif.  So, it was a nice surprise in those ways.\\n\\nThe biggest problems with the place are the mediocre food and the ridiculous prices.  I had the yuzu scallops at $16, and it consisted of two scallops sliced thinly into six rounds, drizzled with yuzu and topped with a little multi-colored fish roe (incorrectly called tobiko on the menu).  It was so-so.  My date said \\"these would be OK if I didn't keep thinking that they're like $2.50 a bite...\\".  We were only half-jokingly discussing what to have for dinner after we left.\\n\\nEverything was like that-- expensive, small, and average quality.  It was all presentation and no substance.

You and your dining companions pick out several small plates to share.\\n\\nDrinks: I sipped the housemade ginger beer and was in love ($4). Since I didn't notice it on the menu, check with an employee if it's available or not. \\n\\nBeef ($18): Eyecatching presentation, with the beef tartare hidden under ruffles of tangy green tomatoes. Way to start off the meal with a bang. \\n\\nCrab ($18): While maybe not the yummiest dish, I have to give props for the unique combination of crab and sunflower seeds. Dressed with flowers and herbs, I wasn't sure if I should eat this or hang up this wreath-shape concoction. \\n\\nChicken liver tart ($12): One of my favorites. Just wished it were bigger! And it was served on a giant white plate which emphasized the small size. \\n\\nEggplant ($16): Another hit. The crunchy sesame tuile not only was yummy, but it was lovely to look at too. \\n\\nGrandma Lillian's potato bread ($5): This bread was fine, warm and steamy, but it was a little too salty for me.\\n\\nPotato ($18): Another weaker link. The potato was again, a little too salty. \\n\\nBlackberry ($9): Excellent way to cap off the meal. And pretty too, with tiny purple flowers and popped sorghum on top of a circular disc of granita. \\n\\nStaff + Menu: Kristin was our server. She was really cool, like someone you could be friends with in real life. She also told us she enjoyed waiting on us which even if she were just saying that for flattery purposes, was still nice to hear. The runners were impressive by how they could spout off lengthy detailed descriptions of the food. I was thinking that Staplehouse could just print all of this on the menu, especially so I could refer to all the random ingredients later, like when I'm writing this Yelp review. The dish descriptions are very basic so definitely mention your dietary restrictions. Your server will know or be able to find out. \\n\\nAmbiance: Our table was close to the open kitchen which was rad because I really liked seeing all the chefs doing their thing, including using forceps to drop tiny components here and there. Now that's precision. Energetic vibe in a neat old building. The entrance is actually at the back.\\n\\nReservations: The online reservation system reminds me of when I was buying concert tickets for a popular band. Slots get nabbed in seconds, it sounds like, when the next's months seatings are released the second Friday of the previous month. You have to put down a deposit which is then applied to your total bill. We arrived right on time for our reservation but had to wait about 15 minutes to be seated which was a little annoying but not terrible.\\n\\nParking: There was plenty of street parking, but valet is an option if that's your thing.\\n\\nConclusion: I was slightly apprehensive walking into Staplehouse due to all the press and praise it has garnered, but it was all for naught. For a special occasion or to indulge in a culinary event, consider Staplehouse. Just plan ahead, score a reservation, and go!"},{"name":"Koto Izakaya","address":"8171 Alexandra Road, Suite 101","city":"Richmond","stars":"3","text":"I love their sushi!

Just a couple of examples of the service I shall not mention.\\n\\nI like the food it was very dressed down food, or as Chef Oliver calls it naked, not overly spiced but designed to let the natural flavor of the dish shine through.  So for this trip we had the French onion soup, the bouillabaisse, bleu cheeseburger, creme brulee and a couple of cocktails.  The French onion soup was better than a lot of soups that I have had in a while, not too oily with the right amount of crusty cheese to bread ratio.  The bouillabaisse was nicely seasoned, not overly spiced and the seafood was not overcooked, a pet peeve of mine.  The cheeseburger and fries was hard to finish not because it wasn't good but the portions are healthy enough that this much food was kind of overwhelming for two girls.  The creme brulee was very subtle; the cream did not have an overwhelming hint of any one flavor.

Let's start with the great:\\n\\nGREAT\\n\\n. Beer. They claim \\"99 bottle of beer on the wall;\\" I think it's closer to about 50. Still, not bad. Plus, they have a rotating tap of about 20 high-quality local and imports. If you're a regular, you can apply for a mug, which involves \\"earning\\" it over the course of several months and many, many beers. In the end you get a mug (~1 liter) of any beer for the price of a pint.\\n\\nDECENT\\n\\n. Food. The menu has good variety, and with some probing shows itself to be more vegetarian-friendly than it appears. However, they clearly don't have a chef on staff; most of the menu items I've had there I could make myself, and the food items are quite pricey for the mediocre quality I do quite like the vegan meatball sub.\\n\\nMEDIOCRE\\n\\n. Music. The selection isn't bad, but it's loud. Very loud. It requires raised voices all of the time, and it's impossible to have a conversation with more than your immediate neighbors. Forget about having a conversation with the person on the other side of your neighbor.\\n\\nIt can get relatively crowded. You should know that it's 21+ all the time, and that all tables are self-seating. I was there tonight, a Monday, and it was barely half-full at 8:15pm, and it did not fill up as the night went on. There also wasn't a Sox game on, which is probably a factor.\\n\\nI gave it 4/5 because of the high-quality beer selection, and that's really what you should go to Bukowski for - the beer. Food is secondary to it, and ideally you'll only get appetizer/bar food items, such as the sweet potato fries. Furthermore, hopefully you'll also be tipsy enough that you wouldn't even think of using your library voice to talk to your tablemates, as doing so would be inadequate."},{"name":"Bar Louie Polaris","address":"1611 Polaris Pkwy","city":"Columbus","stars":"2.5","text":"First time at this location on a Friday night for Happy Hour.

They finally grabbed her and she actually said \\"I'm not your waitress, she's over there but I can take your order\\". Um, what? 2 waitresses for one table? So we then told the couple to ask for silverware since we were only given one set and never got any plates. They were really nice and seemed understanding but said this was their 3rd time here and the wait staff was always terrible. Nice for them though, somehow they were ordered extra drinks (another screw up from the waitress) so she just gave them the extra round for free.

Seems like many people are saying that it used to be better. I really hope so...\\n\\nI'm on a mini quest to find the spiciest dishes in Austin, so when I started reading about the XXX Chili here, I had to try it. I ordered a combo...taster bowl of XXX, enchilada and tamale...figured if the chili really was that crazy hot I'd at least have some options to settle my taste buds. Turned out to be very unnecessary. I don't know if the chili cook was having a bad day or if they served up the wrong level of heat, but this was definitely not what I was expecting. I ate the small bowl pretty much straight through with just a slight feeling of \\"yeah, this has a little bit of kick\\" but it was disappointing. The taste of the chili itself wasn't bad, but definitely wasn't something I'd head back there for. I make better at home. \\n\\nFor the other parts of my meal I'd say that the tamale was fat and flavorful, though a good bit on the dry side. The enchilada was tasty, but if you can mess up cheese rolled in a corn tortilla then you've got serious issues. My friend who had joined me for lunch had a strip steak and it looked adequate and he basically described its taste the same way...not that great but passable. \\n\\nIf I were to start ranking the spiciness of the dishes I've sampled, I would definitely put the XXX Chili at a 1 out of 5...nowhere near the hottest thing I've eaten.

It's not completely mathematical but this theory of mine proved true at Ebisu. There are exceptions to the rule, but very few can get away with this - one such exception is Sun Sui Wah. They have a gargantuan-sized screen, but it doesn't detract from how delicious the food is, the room is alright, too. My friend was in town from Montr√©al and it was his last night in the city before heading back out East, where decent sushi is quite a bit more scarce than it is in Vancouver. My first and obvious choice was Toshi's, but it was Monday night so it was closed, to our misfortune. I should've taken him to Kingyo or Guu Garden instead but I decided to turn to my fellow Yelpers for their advice and given my adventurous nature, I am all for trying new things. Everything was edible here, but far from spectacular. Had I known the place was saturated in tee-vee, I would have opted for somewhere else. Admitedly, I am selective about choosing the spaces that I like to occupy. Televisions take away from an interaction with space - they take away romance and ambiance. It's easy to overlook how poorly decorated a restaurant is or how unsatisfactory the food is, when we are so easily distracted by the brightness and content of a television screen. I get that people these days are less ept at conversing, and rely on a screen to divert awkardness or perhaps, they bond through their shared experience of watching television. In my humble opinion, when we take time to \\"break bread,\\" it is a time to connect with our friends, partners and/or family and we should be able to carry our conversations as well as appreciate a space without unnecessary visual and sonant disruption. I respect restauranteurs who share the same philosophy, because a pleasant and considered dining experience is about the fine balance of food, the people behind the food, and the space.

The sausage was more flavorful/fresher and you could really taste the fresh herbs in the sauce. The crust was thinner but still chewy.

And, can turkey meat get any leaner? Apparently so! I even got down and dirty with the ribs - totally worth it!\\n\\nFlavor! OMG....the smokey flavor of the meat is all natural and AMAZING. It's perfectly seasoned with or without the sauce. Don't get me started on the sauce.....great, you got me started.\\n\\nThe Sauce!   Hands down the best barbecue sauce I have ever eaten and I don't like barbecue sauce! It's usually too tangy or too sweet, but BR has nailed this sauce, I could eat this as a soup, it's so good. Dare I say, it's better than s-x?\\n\\nBanana Pudding! I am talking about the real deal. None of that artificial flavored, yellow looking stuff.

This place is easy to pass on.\\n\\nFood (6/10)\\n\\n(6/10) Sirloin Salad\\nGrilled sirloin sliced and served over spinach, cucumbers, red onions and roma tomatoes tossed with a balsamic vinaigrette. We ordered the sirloin cooked medium. It came out lukewarm and slightly chewy. We didn't like how some parts were cooked medium rare and other parts were medium plus.  It did have a nice flavor though, and there was plenty of it. Something there was not plenty of were the tomatoes - especially since the dinner salad costs more than the lunch salad. The tomatoes, onions, cucumbers and spinach tasted fresh and the balsamic vinaigrette was a good choice.\\n\\n(6/10) Beef Tri-Tip Pizza\\nJalape√±os, red bell peppers, mozzarella over our homemade marinara sauce. We decided to stay with the beef theme. The pizza crust was a little soft and could have baked for a bit longer to achieve that perfect soft-but-crispy crust. The jalapenos were huge and very potent, so it would have been better if there were less or at least in smaller pieces. We had to pick most of them off, and the pizza was still spicy from the leftover jalapeno juices! The beef was tender and flavorful, and the mozzarella cheese and bell peppers tasted fine.\\n\\nService (5/10)\\n\\nWe dined at North by Northwest on a busy weekday evening for dinner and were told there would be a 30 minute wait. So we went to the bar and ordered a few drinks. The charming bartender made us some mouthwateringly delicious Mexican martinis that could give Trudy's a run for their money! He also asked us how we liked it. That's where the manners ended and the service became more mediocre.  Our waitress seemed a little scatterbrained. When we asked for a few items, they were just overlooked. Our friend asked for extra olives for her martini, and I asked for our waters to be refilled and for the balsamic vinaigrette on the side. The olives never came, I had to keep asking for more water, and the vinaigrette was already on the salad. It was ok because the vinaigrette was yummy. We were only checked up on once - which was when we received our bill. They could definitely use a few pointers on customer service!\\n\\nAmbiance (7/10)\\n\\nNorth By Northwest is a restaurant and brewery located near the Arboretum. Parking is difficult though because their lot is always full. The patrons must be returning a lot to keep them so busy. This rustic looking lodge has a bar area and several rooms with large booths and tables available. The interior has a warm, casually upscale vibe with slightly Southern d√©cor. This is a family-friendly eatery, but also good for happy hour and date nights. Beer is brewed on-site and you can order the sampler to see which ones strike your fancy. They also have live music on certain nights. Since the food is on the pricey side and the service is a little dicey, North by Northwest might be a place to check out for their great martinis and assortment of beers."},{"name":"Dai Due","address":"2406 Manor Rd, Ste A","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"we were excited to try here due to all the outstanding critic & diner reviews.

Four limp strips of ceviche style salmon overwhelmed by lemon-citrus with no other flavors coming through.  It was that bad.  And way overpriced at that.  Don't be fooled by the \\"Truffle\\" commentary -- the world's top taster couldn't taste a hint of truffle in this dish.

The \\"Asian Street Fare\\" part of the name I don't get - I like to think of it as Pan-Asian Tapas.  But the food is great and environment is lively.  There is a wait sometimes, but that's okay, because you kinda feel like you are waiting for something desired.  Hard to get this effect usually - but it works here.  The Stir Fry's are incredible - gotta try those.  The Fish with Black Beans rocks.  The best way to order is just order a range of items - in different form factors, this really adds an exploratory aspect to the experience.  Each dish feels like a totally new taste and flavor profile.  If you like it spicy, this is a wonderful destination. Great to go with friends or a few couples.  The sociability factor is very high.  It can get a little loud. I will say that this is one of my favorite restaurants in Orlando.  I give it five stars because I always have a great experience and feel confidant in recommending Hawkers."},{"name":"Vendetta","address":"4306 N Williams St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Went there for geek trivia night and was NOT impressed.

So I view the food as kind of a bonus to what you would get in most clubs.  There are standard Tex-Mex options & healthier Tex-Mex vegetarian choices.  The service is good, with typically only one hard-working waiter for the whole place. Don't ask me to go into detail, because I was there for the band.\\n\\nThe music is kind of hit or miss, depending on what time you get there & who is onstage.  Styles vary, but have always been some version of rock when we're there.  Bands lately have been playing for only an hour at a time, and most are playing really loudly...too loudly for a restaurant, because you can't have a conversation with the person next to you, or with the waiter.  I don't know how he understands the orders.  \\n\\nSo this makes me wonder what this venue is trying to be.  They have the bar-like restaurant inside, and then this fabulous, unused patio out back.  I find myself thinking, why not open those windows & put the band on the back porch?  Noise ordinances?  Or at least open the windows so people could sit on the back porch & hear them.  But the last few times we were there, waiting for the band we came to see, you could hear the band right through the windows anyway, and they weren't good.  \\n\\nParking is easy, because they have their own lot.  I like going to this venue if there's a band I want to see, and I'll order dinner and a few beers, and I'll have friends meet me there.  There is sometimes a cover, sometimes not.  Not sure how that works, but last time I went it was only $5, so it's not outlandish, except that the band you want to hear will only be playing for an hour.  Maybe fewer bands per night with longer sets for the ones who are there, and have some quality control?  This place definitely has some potential to be huge, with the right tweaking & the right acts."},{"name":"North Market","address":"59 Spruce St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"There are a number of different places inside for different types of food.

If you've got a few minutes to spare, the wait is well worth it.\\n\\nThe potato bun gets this burger off to a great start, and the fact that it's toasted makes it even better. The American cheese melts beautifully on the thick, flavorful beef patty and the grind house sauce reminded me of a Thousand Island dressing or Big Mac special sauce. When everything tastes fresh, it usually leads to very good flavor, which is what Grindhouse accomplishes.\\n\\nI was also a big fan of the crinkle cut fries. Am I the only one who thinks crinkle cut fries are seriously underrated? It seemed like Shake Shack made if one of the trends at these upscale quick-serve burger restaurants, and I think them for it. The Grindhouse fries were hot, crispy and tasty.\\n\\nPeople settle for terrible airport food far too often.

It is always ridiculously crowded or booked. On Thursday, I decided to give it try (Dec 14th) I took a chance and called at 9pm and asked if there was availability for a party of one. They said yes at the sushi bar for 930. I said great, Im on the way. I get there about 9:15pm and checked in. I was soo hungry I couldnt wait to have some sushi. They told me I could go to bar for a drink while they get my seat ready. I declined because I just wanted FOOD! Gwenyth Paltrow ( the actress) walks in with one other guest and just like that, less than 10min she seated at table. I know, I am not an A-list or even D-list actor, but my money spends the same. They were very apologetic and thanked me for patience, but 45 minutes later hearing \\"thank you for patience\\" was becoming annoying. I know you're thinking, \\"you could've went somewhere else by then\\" I know that, but I didnt. So some time after 10pm I was finally seated. Yes, the sushi was delicious, but management has to do something about its reservations. Maybe you need to space out the availability times if you know that people are taking 2hrs to finish their dining experience. Having people wait over 10min for a RESERVATION is utterly disrespectful for any restaurant. Most people were constantly checking on their reservations to find out how much longer before they are seated. Now, I wouldnt say I wouldnt come back, but I would bring snacks or at least have something on my stomach.  Sorry, no pics, I was so famish from waiting so long I scarfed it down. I had a spicy tuna roll, Hirame Usuzukuri, rainbow roll and for dessert the chocolate molten cake with the green matcha icecream. Based on what I ordered, food was good. I noticed if you're \\"friends\\" of the Manager or chef, you get dishes that are customized and not on the menu. I observed this by the people that were sitting on my right and left. The 3 stars is based on the waiting time. Unacceptable. There is more to a fine dining experience than having people pay $100 min per person to eat.

I haven't been here before today, but apparently the whole endeavor is under new owners, since the woman who seemed to be in charge was talking about repainting and the like. There was actually a sign that was asking visitors to pardon their dust until a customer came in and told them to take it down since the shop was basically immaculate, haha.  I agree.  The new paint job looks nice (though I have no idea what the old one looked like) and apparently they're going to install tile doors in the bathroom, which will be nice.\\n\\nAnyhow.  I came here and got the drip and nothing else, so I can't speak for the quality of the food or the espresso.  Like many other coffeeshops in the area they offer Stumptown, which is a solid (if not entirely predictable) choice.  Drip is 1.75, which is not bad.\\n\\nEven better, it comes with free refills, which is not something I expected, since most places that offer refills are the variety that have you serve yourself, and here the drip is behind the counter.  I was sitting at a table doing my work when one of the employees came up, asked if I would like some more, and even doctored it for me before bringing it back.  That's surprisingly good service and value for a coffeeshop, where most of the time there either are no free refills/you're pumpin' em yourself.\\n\\nWhat really sold me on this place was how friendly the owners were.  It's worth noting that the hours listed here are wrong - I actually specifically came here since the Yelp page says they're open until 7pm (and their webpage says this too), but they're only open until 5.  I docked a star for that since, well, come on, you should update your web presence to accurately reflect your hours of operation. \\n\\nHowever, the owner let me stick around until about 5:45 since she was cleaning, and gave me another cup of coffee as they were gonna dump it anyhow.  So that was much appreciated.\\n\\nThis is a very nice place in the Overlook/Kenton neighborhoods and I'm sure I'll be back.

So, anything less than 5 stars is disappointing to me. But this was a huge disappointment. I was so excited because my family was in town for the holidays and I wanted to take them to somewhere extra wonderful. I had heard great things about this place and I am pretty aware of fabulous restaurants in Atlanta, I do my research. When we got there, we got seated in the big table in the bar area, we were a party of 7. Not a problem. The menu was incredibly limited on this evening. Especially because we don't eat meat but I was counting on fish, chicken and veggie dishes. There was a few. But the small plate dinners had more variety but for the price, very small servings. Our food came out an hour after we sat down and the 2 pasta dishes came out 15 minutes after that. So, 2 guests sat there with nothing for 15 minutes longer! The manager was aware and just said that the two dishes will be out soon. No other word or apology or concern. He didn't even ask how everything was so far. The piece of fish my daughter got for $34.00 was ridiculously small. There was lots of bread brought to our table. We never asked for it but we were grateful to receive it because we were hungry from waiting so long. None of us were filled up on our meals. It was a terrible disappointment. We are not a large sized family and don't expect massive portions. But for the prices we were paying, they were very small indeed. Then we got charged a dollar a person for the bread that we never asked for to begin with!!! They took it off because we said that it was crazy to not have asked and then be charged. What restaurant serves people something without being told there is a charge and without the item being asked for? What if one of our guests was glucose intolerant and couldn't eat the bread? They would have been charged anyway?!! They said it is stated on the menu. That being said, we should have ordered it then as with other dishes with a price. And if we asked for bread, we should have been told that it is a dollar a person for unlimited bread. Most people don't expect to pay for bread unless it is in the body of the menu with a price next to it. And then they order it if they want it. The best thing about our experience was our server. She was constantly pleasant, even though she could see our disappointment. She maintained a very professional attitude and tried to help us order what she thought we would like. I have seen the menu on other nights and it was much more substantial (I don't know about the portions though). Had I seen this menu when I was making the reservations, I would have NEVER made a reservation. Terrible variety and choices. Maybe the cold weather froze all the good options.

My man had a Treaty Oak Rum Pepperita and it was fantastic.\\n\\nThe food was outstanding.  We ordered Chicken Nachitos to start off with, and they were the best nachos I've ever had.

Either he wasn't crazy about being there or he wasn't crazy about US being there.  Not sure.  I consider myself to be extremely tolerant of just about everything during a dining experience.  However, last night as our waiter was clearing our plates at the end of our meal, he noticed what might've amounted to AT MOST a half a teaspoon of gravy on the table where my fork was.  He handed me a paper cocktail napkin and said \\"I'm gonna hand you this so you can just go ahead and clean that.\\"  Okay....  I'm a table cleaner.  When I go out to eat, I stack plates up and get all the trash off of the table and wipe any spills that might've occurred, anything to make my waitperson's job a little easier.  So I guarantee you that I would've wiped that spot up anyway, but I've never been handed a napkin by a waitperson and basically been told to do his job.

I've been here a few times for parties and always found the servers to be accommodating and on top of their game. \\n\\nFor starters, each table gets a small serving of house made pimento cheese and crackers. The portion size is just right and the flavors rich without too much mayo. My friends typically order the guacamole- no complaints here! They give you a generous portion topped with queso fresco and pepitas. The crunch of the seeds marries perfectly with the creamy avocado and I would be content eating the bowl all by myself. Well, that and a Mexican Martini. Like the guacamole, it's always gone before I know it! \\n\\nBeing a vegetarian, I find the options limited as the entrees on the menu are heavy on burgers and friend chicken. I've ordered the veggie tacos in the past, which comes a nice variety for the price. The vegetables, including squash and onion, are nicely charred and accompanied by black beans, guacamole (more-yes!), rice, and tiny tortillas. Seriously, they are like three inches.

It was an impromptu plan and the closest thing to us at that time since our original go-to place happened to be closed.\\n\\n[decor]\\nThe lavender building with lime green trimming looking house can seem a bit \\"tacky\\" from the outside. Inside, the place looks more normal versus \\"tacky\\". In fact, the tables and chairs seem a bit more classy and casual. One would not think the inside would look like that when driving by. But outside towards the side of the establishment is their patio. Black-wired type tables and chairs.\\n\\n[devour]\\n*LARB - beef ($9; **2 STARS**) - Although the flavors were almost reminiscent of larb, I was disappointed that the dish was \\"saucy\\". I've had larb at other Thai restaurants and never have I had so much juice for this salad dish. It felt like an entree instead of an appetizer. The meat was cooked okay, but I couldn't shake the fact that the larb was saucy........ perhaps I ordered the wrong thing here.\\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/baiyok-thai-cuisine-portland?userid=lj3rJy1dUuHMDnqU_OCfsA#gMI0JPP5p7rJ7OkjiF-FmA)\\n\\n*EVIL JUNGLE NOODLES ($10.95; **3.5 STARS**) - Were interesting. Who would've known that curry sauce over noodles and veggies would blend well together?! It may or may not impress you, but I thought it was a unique mix than your average pad-thai order from a Thai restaurant. The curry came out mild, but you can request for it to be spicier.\\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/baiyok-thai-cuisine-portland?userid=lj3rJy1dUuHMDnqU_OCfsA#EU085am970rPUgKvZjT1xw)\\n\\n*PAD GA PRAU ($10.95; **3 STARS**) - was a chicken stir fry dish made with veggies, sweet basil and chili paste. It was decent. Was not the best nor worst. It wasn't as memorable as the Evil Jungle Noodles and so I'll leave it at that.\\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/baiyok-thai-cuisine-portland?userid=lj3rJy1dUuHMDnqU_OCfsA#mIJwlLbNuiqK7A4bJzLhIQ)\\n\\n[drank]\\n*WATER (**1 STAR**) - do NOT drink their water. It had a weird after taste! It took a while for me and my friends to realize that it was perhaps soap residue. We had to discretely toss the water out (good thing we were sitting on their patio so we sorta watered their plants with the soapy-water). We replenished our glasses with new water that was delivered from the water jug, and it was much better. But it was not cool to drink that toxic water.\\n\\n*THAI ICED TEA ($2.50; **2.5 STARS**) - was uber sweet! May be too sweet for some or just right for others. Drink at your own risk for a sugar high. \\n(http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/baiyok-thai-cuisine-portland?userid=lj3rJy1dUuHMDnqU_OCfsA#QrdmKWzCKr13_r6bU-d-aw)\\n\\nFYI =\\n-Parking on nearby neighborhood streets or in their back lot\\n-You can order your food to-go\\n-If you want to sit in their outdoor patio, you must hand over your CC since people tend to do a dine-n-dash \\n-CC's accepted\\n\\nOverall, the place was okay in my book.

My husband thought the steamed char siew buns were cold so asked the old lady if he could change to another type. It was his mistake not to mention  that it was cold.  She said yes, and brought over another type which is ok to be not warm. Then she gave a black face and told us they  shouldn't take back food that was already touched by customer. blah blah blah. Like we have committed some crime. Then she snatched the steam buns away from the table before my husband could say it's ok, we can have them. She threw the buns right in front of our eyes into the garbage bin. Did they put a big garbage bin in the dining hall for that purpose, to display their displeasure of customers refusing food already served? Then she rushed into the kitchen. We complained to a younger waitress and she just took the side of her old lady. I told her that I totally understand the reason for their displeasure but I cannot accept the way they express it. We come here to have an enjoyable meal, not to be scolded! She still refused to admit their service is bad. We totally lost our appetite and want to get out of there. But another waiter didn't say anything except sorry, and gave us a plate of egg custard. He is such an angel, he displays exemplary service.  Keep it up!\\n\\nAnyway, hope management will look at this and improve the service. Ask your staff to smile and talk gently and quit explaining all the reason why they have to be rude.

(thanks Todd K.) I know not to expect too much from the chips (thanks Debra R.) and salsa and to stay away from anything prepared with shrimp. (thanks Brian B.) I'm definitely looking forward to a few carafes of Sangria.\\n\\nStar prediction: 3 Stars.\\n\\nAfter. 11AM Saturday, 1/5/2008.\\n\\nFirst, the food & service: The chips were average. I'm fine with average chips when they deliver such an extremely above average salsa. Seriously, this salsa brought the heat! My beef chimichanga dinner ($10.95, picture uploaded) was a very good value. It was served with three sides: black beans, rice and a fresh vegetable mixture. Overall, the food was good and I left fully satisfied. The service was prompt. We received the complementary chips and salsa only seconds after seating ourselves. Our servers were polite and the food was prepared quickly.\\n\\nSecond, the drink: The deep red-plum colored sangria was both sweet and spicy; with hints of cinnamon in every sip. It lacked chunks of fruit but that didn't deter us from drinking two carafes (about 2 liters). Thumbs up, its a must try. \\n\\nLastly, the decor & atmosphere: Lets not pull any punches here, the decor is poor. The walls are adorned with meaningless/generic Spanish items and the paint job must have been outsourced to Labor Ready. The atmosphere was cozy, lively/energetic/upbeat and overall pretty decent. There was a wait starting shortly after we were seated at around 6:45PM. Lets move on to the bathroom. It was small and the door literally hits you where the good lord splits you. I think they need to work on the door hinge tension. They also need to increase the size of the paper towels that are automatically dispensed. I have man hands and needed three to sufficiently dry my hands. \\n\\nInteresting events that make the night: Mid-meal the untouched tableside hot sauce exploded. Its cork unexpectedly and loudly popped off and shot straight up, into the ceiling.

Upon my arrival 10 minutes later, I was greeted by a petite girl at the door with a clipboard, who informed me that \\"We have a reservation and we have to honor it, so we're not letting anyone in right now.\\"  I said that my friends were at the bar, with seats, and they had arrived shortly before me.  The girl asked if my friends had left a name with her.  I said I doubted it since she wasn't there when they arrived 10 minutes ago.  I proceeded to text my friend, who went to discuss this issue with the inside hostess, who then came out to talk quietly with the \\"bouncer.\\"  After a few minutes of this back-and-forth, the hostess said I could come in because my friends were at the bar.  \\n\\nCome to find out that this hostess was confused about why the \\"bouncer\\" was giving me a hard time since there was NO line and this place wasn't at capacity at all. Meanwhile, our 4th friend arrived 10 minutes after me and was let in with NO problem.  I'm still trying to figure out what reservation was preventing people from being let in, since there just seemed to be an arbitrary 10 minute window in which patrons (i.e. myself) were being held back. \\n\\nNow, I'm sure I came off as irritated.  No one likes to arrive a a bar to be turned away for what appears to be no real reason, especially since my party, who arrived shortly before and shortly after me, had no problems.  I would have just liked a bit more explanation from the girl at the front door, who I'm sure was just doing her job, but arbitrary roadblocks will piss anyone off.  I am reluctant to go back only because, as a previous reviewer has said, there seems to be no way to tell if and when the entire place will be shut down.  But as long as the bar is \\"open,\\" I think anyone will have a pleasant experience here."},{"name":"Southern Proper","address":"600 Harrison Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Came here for a Sunday brunch followed by a walk around SoWa.\\n\\nThe place is really cool - decorated in the most adorable way, and very spacious and airy.\\n\\nMy friend and I both ordered the omelette, and I got the hashbrown, while she ordered the cinnamon roll.\\n\\nThe mushroom omelette, sadly, was rather bland and unexciting.

I love how organic the whole thing feels - it's a commercial spot but it's not hyper-capitalist driven. It's all local business, and everything is quality. This particular occasion, my friend and I opted for Indian from Flavors of India - I have almost always had Indian when I come to NM. It's not the best Indian food ever, but it's definitely decent. (I remain confused as to why my palak paneer has never had any paneer in it - to quote Sam from Walk Hard, \\"never...not once!\\"). Anyhow, it's still a good option. Also, my friend and I shared a picnic bench outside (ahh!! the weather is So Nice right now!) with two very friendly ladies who were eating amazing looking sandwiches from Heil's - we def want to try that place sometime. \\n\\nBut the true gem of NM, and of Columbus really, is Jeni's Gourmet Ice Cream. OMG. So, I'm actually convinced that the salty caramel ice cream sandwich came down from heaven from god. God actually makes these, in case your wondering, and they will send you into convulsions of divine ecstasy when you eat them. At least they make me wiggle in my seat and exclaim over and over about their goodness. Wow. Thanks, Jenni's! I should really write them a seperate review (if I haven't yet), but this is definitely a huge reason to come to NM. \\n\\nAlso, just the local, cooperative atmosphere, and the generally good vibe of this place makes me so happy. The Arnold \\"sports\\" thing (aka creepy muscle people convention) is happening this weekend, but even with all the muscle-people running around, the atmosphere was still chill and happy. Oh, and one last thing, there are also cool events here - last year I went to the beer tasting fest, which was super sweet (and I got a super sweet pint glass from it!). Lotsa stuff like that, too.

We ordered the hobo special which is a 40 and a hot dog for $6.99. Our waitress took the order and never said anything. A runner came out with a regular beer, not a 40 like we ordered. We asked about it and he said the special was over. Not a big deal we just drank our beers. When we got the bill, we ended up being charge over $5 for the hot dog! We felt cheated because there is no way we would have ordered the hot dog if it was not for the special. Normally I would not complain for a few dollars but in this case we felt cheated. When I asked for the manager, a guy came out and stated that the special was over and said that the waitress said she told us the special was over. She did not. When I stated that she must be mistaken he said he had to believe his staff over the customer and literally walked away without saying anything else. \\n\\nSo now instead of having a happy repeat customer, I feel cheated and upset and will probably never go back.

Unfortunately they doused the whole thing in olive oil that made it all just taste like olive oil.  \\n  Avocado Salad - We were really excited about this from the reviews but was a real let down.  It was just a half of avocado with a dressing that could have been good if it were not so sweet.  We poured half the dressing off and then poured in a bunch of soy sauce which made it tolerable.  \\n  Shishito peppers:  Good grilled shishito peppers, we ordered just with salt not with the sauce that it comes with normally.  \\n  \\"Live\\" Scallop:  This scallop was clearly alive at some point but it wasn't recently.

The manager didn't even apologize for screwing up my order or didn't offer anything off of the bill, except for a $2.00 off coupon for the next time I place an order.  \\n\\nIf you want to witness a business ran solely on the whims of stoners than visit and order from this place.

Must say the boneless fried chicken was excellent: incredibly moist and flavorful with a breading that was just right (not too crispy and not too soggy). At least for a nice sit-down restaurant, it was the best fried chicken I have had certainly in the Columbus area. Came with green beans, which tasted fresh (not at all rubbery) and a jalapeno corn bread muffin (decent, not overwhelming from the jalapeno but also not one I was blown away by).  My wife chose the grilled versus fried chicken breast with crumbled Gorgonzola cheese for the sandwich with blue cheese dressing on the side. She gave me a taste: quite tasty. The sweet potato chips were equally as good. I left full but not stuffed, so take that for what it's worth. \\n\\nI want to go back and try the reuben (heard the waiter saying to the table next to us that the corned beef was cured on site) and the shrimp and grits. \\n\\nNice addition to Worthington who want a dinner a tad more upscale than Old Bag, without being pretentious.

They were very gracious, and said no problem--I must say that the service was always good and never any attitude.  Requesting the patio chairs might have been a problem if it had been a sunny day and they needed the chairs out on the patio, but it was a rainy night, any no one was outside.\\n\\nWith the uncomfortable seats no longer a distracting issue, I felt that I should write an update to my review where I could actually comment on the food, and I have 2 dinners there now that I can draw from.\\n\\nFor starters we had the tempura green beans, basic poutine, and beet salad--all were very good.  \\n\\nThe poutine was offered with varying toppings, starting with the basic gravy and cheese curds.  You could also order their special poutine which was bbq pulled pork last week, and bolognese sauce this week.  The other variation was with short ribs.  And then you could order the poutine with ALL the toppings too.\\n\\nThe caesar salad was served with the romaine lettuce head cut length-wise, dressing artfully squiggled on top and with a little too much cheese on top.  We were sharing the caesar salad, and with the lettuce head so long, we had the messy task of cutting the lettuce head into pieces that could actually fit onto our little side plates.  I quickly gave up, and asked our server to take it back to the kitchen for them to cut up. \\n\\nThe dinner mains were all presented on long rectangular plates that look a little on the small side, but is actually enough.  The consensus is that it was all quite good, but not excellent.  Actually, the seared tuna did get top marks though on both nights.  But the bison was a little tough, but because my husband doesn't eat bison that often, he's not sure if that's just how bison is, or if it was a less superior cut or poorly cooked.  He opted for the lamb last night and was much happier."},{"name":"Yoshi's Japanese Restaurant","address":"5776 Frantz Rd","city":"Dublin","stars":"4","text":"Our family had a bad experience in this restaurant.

We gave her a chance but she never returned to offer us a beverage, we had to wave her over to order our drinks. We ordered yellow tail jaw, the menu said it will take 25 mins to cook, which was fine we could wait.  We also ordered regular sushi meal $18 and a chef special sushi meal $27.  We ordered eel and avocado roll and udon noodles for our kids. We also got edamame for appetizer. The edamame came right away.  The sushi and yellow tail jaw came all together at 7:40 ish, it was a very long wait, we arrived at 6:30! We did not rush the waitress since the restaurant was busy, our regular sushi meal and chef special meal came exactly the same !!!!!!!! What ?!? We were shocked!! My husband just wanted to let it go, and wait to see what the check would said, thought maybe the order was wrong or something, since the meal was for his promotion celebration we try to be nice and calm. \\n\\nOur kid's udon did not come, that's like 7:40!! We asked her to follow up with our udon order she said they are making it. After a while one of our kid finished with the eel roll, the other kid did not have any food!!!  We wanted to share our sushi with the kids but it was raw food so we hesitated, so we did not share! At 8 I looked for the waitress on my way to the restroom just to remind her we didn't have our noodle and if she can follow up.   Then we finished with all our sushi, that's like 8:15ish, the waitress came to us and said the kitchen is still making it.  What ?!??! Seriously???!? The yellow tail jaw said from the menu will take 25 mins already came and the udon still not done ?!?!?!?   My kid still had no food, we did not get any apology from her, not one word.  We felt so bad for our kid, and we said wait couple more mins if nothing we will leave.  We asked her for the check at 8:20 ish, the check came to our table in like 2 mins!!! By the way, chef special and regular sushi meal are the same food! We got cheated ! Did not get a apology for not preparing our udon, did not get a check discount.  She actually never came over to our table and ask if everything was okay.

That is, of course, until I visited this particular branch in Lake Mary, FL. I ordered grilled wings as usual and when they finally came out, it was quite obvious that my wings weren't just grilled, they were fried first. I had a feeling this might've been an accident made by the chef who quickly tried to save the fried wings by throwing them in the grill for a few mins. I asked to speak to the manager, Eric, and explained to him that it was obvious that my wings were fried and not grilled. Eric proceeded to tell me that all their wings are pre fried every morning, then thrown on the grill when ordered grilled. To clarify, I asked him again and he confirmed that fried wings were being passed off as grilled wings and that's just how all the branches prepare them. So I asked for corporate info and his card in which he gave me neither, but presented me with his district manager's card and told me I could get corporate info online. I thanked him and did exactly that. I also called my regular branch in Kennesaw, GA and spoke with a manager who confirmed that all grilled wings were baked and then grilled upon order. Upon leaving, after paying our bills, my friend and I noticed a cop walking in and hanging around the hostess stand. We made a joke about how the manager must have called his cop friend to harass us since we both ordered one alcoholic drink with our meals. Low and behold, that is EXACTLY what happened, as soon as we walked out the door, the cop turned around and followed us onto the parking lot. Unbeknownst to him and Eric, we were staying at a nearby hotel and had actually walked over to Tilted Kilt in an attempt to sight-see. Joke was on them but I really didn't appreciate that. Does Tilted Kilt call the cops on every customer it serves alcohol to??! I ended up reordering my grilled wings from another branch in Orlando about 12 miles away after calling and confirming with the manager of that branch that all the grilled wings are definitely baked and then grilled. He even said that would defeat the whole purpose of having a healthier alternative. I completely agree. This could be a serious problem for someone with a heart condition that cannot have fried foods. It is unlawful to fry wings that you advertise as grilled wings. That is false advertising and could pose as a health hazard.

We about finished the poutine and were beginning to wonder what was taking the rest of our food so long when another gentleman (I'm assuming a manager) stopped by as if on cue to let us know our food was on its way and apologized.  No big deal, we were in no rush.\\n\\nFood came, food = delicious.  I'm no critic, so I'm not going to get into each and every dish we ordered.  But we cleaned our plates and were happy with what we had.\\n\\nWe hung out for another drink, and asked for our check.  When Captain America brought them, he informed us that since our food took so long they were taken off of our bill.  (!?!?!?!? WUT?)  We didn't even complain about the time, nor did we barely notice, but that gesture was really above and beyond any service I've encountered in a restaurant.  We chalked it up to Bangers buying us dinner to celebrate my friend's new job. :)  Left Captain America a healthy tip since we were planning on spending the funds anyway.\\n\\nBanger's really set the bar high for service and food, we will absolutely be back and with our furry friends in tow. :)"},{"name":"Dil Se Indian Cuisine","address":"1201 SW Jefferson St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"How convenient--to move into the neighborhood, and find this wonderful restaurant on the next block!

My only complaint is they only offer the one size that's a bit on the large size for me, but I'm sure having just the one size ups their efficiency (and it's not overly large, just bigger than I can consume in one sitting and I often end up throwing 1/3-1/2 away).

The space is great, and we really like the ambience.  It was pretty quiet the night we went, but I'll chalk that up to the post-thanksgiving hangover as well as them being fairly new to the scene.  \\n\\nThe drinks were very good -  I had the bourbon, fresh ginger beer and basil creation (the name escapes me), and it was outstanding.  As per prior reviews, the drinks did take awhile, but the bartender came over to apologized because he had to MAKE fresh ginger beer!  Apology accepted and loved the drink - and we all decided at the table that, while the drinks did take a bit, we actually were relaxed and enjoying ourselves, and isn't that the reason you go out in the first place?  Maybe the homemade drinks taking a few extra minutes is actually a good thing.\\n\\nOn the food side, it was good, but again I agree with previous posters that the portion size could be bigger.  While I appreciate the artistic approach to the presentation, I think that a bit more on the plate would help alleviate any issue one has with the pricing (which was a bit high, but the drinks were worth it).  \\n\\nService was excellent - waiter was great, and our water glasses never saw half-full.

After our outdoor wait, we had a drink at the bar and finally we were showed to our table at 9:15.  The decor in the back room is lovely.  We sat near the fireplace.  The loudness from the bar made the dinner experience less relaxing as we needed to shout at one another.  That said, our server was wonderful and our food (eggplant, misty salad, chicken parm) was delicious and worth the long wait.  I just wish the loud, night life wasn't so disruptive.

While I'm not one to pay more than a couple of bucks for a burger, this pub burger was worth the cost, cooked perfectly with a little pink in the middle. \\n\\nWe left for a concert, then came back later in the evening to try some of their dessert - a marionberry crumble with ginger cookie and cheesecake ice cream.

It's immediately apparent that this place is not content to blend in with the rest of the area bars. As you walk down Lansdowne, one immediately notices the black sign with flashing neon lights, evoking the feeling of a small Chicagoan theatre. There is outdoor seating that goes beyond a place to light up a butt; I would be very happy to take a group of friends here to eat outside.\\n\\nWhen you walk in, the first thing that stands out is the lack of corner-cutting that's so evident in the other area bars. Dark wood, red accents, and dim lighting give it a great lounge feel. There are several alcoves for private functions. The main bar runs the entire length of the restaurant's right side. I could see it being fairly easy to get a drink when this place really gets going, but that will be saved for an update. The tables in the place are very well spaced from each other, so you're not packed in like sardines. When you go here, check out the engraved ceiling tiles. These remind me of a pub that opened in my former stomping ground of Alexandria, VA. The owners of that place imported the tiles from their family pub in Ireland. These look very similar, and are quite pleasing to the eye.\\n\\nThe service from my first visit was fantastic. The bartender remembered my name on the first go and didn't hesitate to introduce himself. I think service establishments really hit gold when they make you feel as if they invited you into their home, and this guy did a good job of that. When we sat to order food, the wait staff recommended the beef pot pie and the warm cheese with chips, which we went with.\\n\\nThe beef pot pie ($12) was decent, and came with two large slices of soda bread. It was perfectly acceptable pub fare, but I wouldn't lick the plate clean. The warm cheese with chips ($6) is incredibly good and a steal at that price. The only thing I'd change is either to reduce the amount of cheese, or increase the amount of chips, as we were generous with our dipping and there was still easily half the bowl left when we ran out of chips.\\n\\nThe Lansdowne has a full bar, but it's clear they're going for the beer offerings of a Euro-pub. If you want a stout, you have alternatives to Guiness in Beamish and Murphy's. There is also some nice Belgian and German representation. Unfortunately, they'll all cost you. A LOT. The European beers can average at around $7 - 8, and even some domestic brews will hit that mark. I don't paying a bit more for European beers, but $10 for Duvel and $7.50 for Allagash is crazy (especially when it's coming in from Maine!)\\n\\nWhile it's not a replacement, this helps ease the loss of Axis and Avalon in Fenway."},{"name":"Cafe Java- Austin","address":"11900 Metric Blvd, Ste K","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Amazing brunch choices and the food was incredible.

There wasn't any grease dripping from it and was made to perfection. We had a grilled chicken salad to split also and asked for the dressing on the side. There was plenty to eat between us and she was able to take a good portion of the salad home. We also had a cocktails to celebrate. Their drinks are reasonably priced.

Although she did say to my french in-laws that the only thing she learned to say while in france was \\"don't touch me\\".

I think we got seated in about 35. There was one hostess who was really taking charge, and was super attentive, friendly, and helpful. She's definitely a keeper.\\n\\nFor appetizers we order the Brussels sprouts and the one pound meatball. They were out of Brussels Sprouts, but that's not shocking for the first weekend in business. The meatball was amazing. The sauce has just a touch of sweetness, and the meatball wasn't dry at all. The Ricotta on top seemed home made.\\n\\nFor entrees, my wife got the salmon, which she said was awesome. I got the burger,  which was very very good. The fries were perfect. The only real issue we ran into was with my mother's order. She got the steak tips medium rare. A couple were close to medium, but most were medium well. The thing is, they still tasted very good, and even overcooked weren't too tough, but my mother did send them back.\\n\\nNow, the sign of a good restaurant is how they handle problems and how willing they are to fix it. This place, if I could, I'd give them ten stars. They manager/friend of the owner came over to our table, addressed the issue, and took it off our bill.

We had a great dinner, and appetizer, and I was impressed with the portion sizes, freshness, quality and service.  Dinner was around $35 for 2 people, with 2 fountain drinks and an appetizer. This seemed reasonable for dinner. \\n\\nI returned for lunch today with 4 of my girlfriends. I was raving about the place, so they decided to give it a try. I ordered the same thing, because it was so good the first time (market salad + salmon).  My lunch ended up being $15. ($8 salad +$4 Salmon + Drink)  That's a little steep for a lunch salad. I was super excited about the tea bar (LOVE the raspberry mojito!!) so I got over the expensive lunch pretty quickly.  When my salad came; however, I was extremely disappointed with the quantity of salmon I got on top of my salad. I asked the gentleman who delivered the food if that was the standard amount of salmon that comes on a salad. He assured me it was, but he said he'd go check. He came back and restated that the amount of salmon that I received (again, $4 worth...) was correct, and it was 4oz.   (Note: I weigh my food at home, and know what 4 oz of salmon looks like)  This was smaller than a deck of cards. I was annoyed, and made it known to the guy that I was disappointed, but I wasn't going to say anything to the manager.  The salmon ended up being a little under cooked as well, but I was so annoyed at this point, I wasn't going to say anything. (Note 2: My friend's salad that came with grilled chicken had a LOT of chicken on it, and was only $2.50. Next time, Chicken)\\n\\nOverall, the food was delicious and good portion sizes.  After talking with my friends, we decided that we would not be returning for our group lunches because it was just too expensive. There are many options for a good salad in the area (Designer Greens, Crispers, Cooper's Hawk, Panera, CPK  and closer to UCF/our office: Hummus House, Greens & Grill,etc) and this didn't warrant a $15 lunch.

This week I took my wife there for a random, surprise dinner -- what better occasion to try out a restaurant you've been eager to explore, but never had a good enough reason to?\\n\\nTo begin, the atmosphere here was very relaxed and nonchalant, which we both appreciated after coming from work. Being a Wednesday, it wasn't too crowded, and we were allowed to sit practically wherever we wanted. (We elected to dine at a booth.) We were placed right beside a wall that was covered in postcards and souvenir stationary from around the country (and maybe the world - -I can't remember entirely). Overall, it was a very nice setting.\\n\\nThe service was top notch. Our waiter was very polite and funny, and patiently explained the many little questions we had regarding the menu. The food arrived quickly, and they even gave us a free sample of their signature grilled cheese (the reasons for which elude me at present). Our server checked up on us frequently, which is always something I'm careful to be on the lookout for.\\n\\nThe food was really the only negative aspect of this \\"dinerant\\" experience (and a small aspect at that). Most of our meal was actually very good: the fried pickles were novel yet tasty; the coconut milkshake and \\"Grasshopper\\" alcoholic shake my wife and I ordered respectively were sweet and satisfying; and the \\"breakfast\\" my wife ordered (eggs, hash browns, and biscuits and gravy) impressed her -- something hard to do when it comes to food. My dish, however, did not impress: I had the Lava Lake BBQ Lamb (or something to that effect), which sounded good on the menu, but was only partially so on my plate; everything about the dish was pretty decent, save for the VERY fatty chunks mixed in with the lamb, which rendered a significant portion of the meal inedible. I left nearly half the food on the plate when the server came to pick it up. Needless to say, I was disappointed.\\n\\nReally, the only reason this place isn't a 5 star is because I reserve that only for perfect dining experiences; this one came close, but missed the mark. I would certainly recommend it, and yes, I plan on eating here again.

My understanding is the printed menus have the wrong price but that's what they charge unless you call it out to them.  I'm not sure if the excuse of the price discrepancy they gave me is actually true or not, but that's what I was told.  \\nI've ordered online and from the counter as a to go meal and it's often incorrect or quality is not good.

(I do not eat any meat at all and got lots of items here.) The butcher, the baker, the fishmonger and the olive grower all contribute to the huge assortment of products. You can scoop up a varied selection of olives, find well priced, authentic Nutella (the one in the glass jar- much better) and pick up some lentils, huge jars of spices, cookies, pastries or even some cooked shrimp. (Their fresh fish looks fine, but I have not purchased any yet, out of loyalty to New Deal.) If you like good prices, independently owned specialty markets and lots of choices, you need to make this a destination next time you are in the vicinity of Haymarket or Government Center. \\n\\nBased on the number of people down here on my first visit, this place is a hidden jewel with much to explore. It's right near Harry's Cheese Shop (also a treasure) and there are two entrances, but they are not well marked. Descend you must.

The decor is nice, a major improvement from the previous Colonial Room and felt very clean. Nothing about it screamed Greek to me with it's beige walls, Italian-feeling accents and Floridian dining chairs. The lighting was pretty dark and it's hard to tell they are open from the street. \\n\\nThe service was fine. No real complaints there. We did get the impression that they wouldn't go out of their way to accommodate you. Not sure how else to explain it, but there was a weird sense of entitlement that everyone seemed to carry. Their sign by the cash register was more than off putting. \\n\\nThe food was good. The Greek salad had a pretty small hunk of feta on it, but the dressing was nice and the greens seemed fresh. The gyro meat was tasty, but slightly dry. We really enjoyed their tzatiki sauce and the skordalia was more potato than garlic, but decent. Spanakopita was really good, lots of dill. The Avgolemono soup was horrid. It tasted of canned chicken that stuck to your teeth, very flavorless broth except for salt and over cooked orzo pasta. \\n\\nAll in all it was good.

Score. We scored a cozy table and we were off to the races. \\n\\nStarted with a few cocktails -- The Boss Fight and The Oxford Town -- Mine, Boss Fight, served in a taller glass and the Oxford Town served in a dainty glass. Both were fantastic. As a preferential gin-drinker, these were both up my alley. Careful preparation, selection of ingredients, and attention to flavor profile. I'm no cocktail specialist, but these were both damn dandy drinks. \\n\\nFor starters, we had the rosemary almonds and burrata. The almonds are perfect shared by two and have great flavor. The burrata was equally enjoyable and split easily. Heartily enjoyed both. \\n\\nEntree -- Three words: North Carolina Trout. I barely have words for the whole experience. Served whole, prepared table-side, and my, oh my, did it have flavor. I rarely eat the skin of a fish, but this tasty swimmer didn't find any remnant on my plate. No, siree! Simple, fresh, light, and easily one of the tastiest fish I've ever had the pleasure of enjoying. \\n\\nDessert: Banana Terrine. Shut your mouth. It was splendid. \\n\\nOur server, though I don't recall his name, was a fine gentleman. We loved getting to chat with him and hear his story a bit.

Everything was good except for the fondue and pretzel. The pretzel came out pretty tough and not soft and chewy like I would have expected. The texture of the fondue was not very creamy, but more pastey when it came out. It was also overly salty. The combination of texture and taste leaves me to question how fresh the fondue was. It felt like it was probably sitting in the pot for a while. Everything was good though, but not awesome.\\n\\nIt was overall a pleasant experience at the restaurant.

The bar, with its friendly and attentive bartenders, is nice and also quieter than most in its realm, and is not a bad place to test out the aforementioned--especially on a cold winter night; during the summer, the outdoor seating area is perfect. \\n\\nThis restaurant is consistently strong. I've been coming here for a few years (I live in the neighborhood), ever since it opened, and every single one of my experiences has been marked by good service as well as good food, and my friends and family members never complain. Additionally, I'm allergic to gluten and to dairy, and the staff is always incredibly careful about avoiding any slip-ups. Each time I announce my allergies to the poor unsuspecting waitperson, a manager appears shortly thereafter to run through the procedures they'll use in the kitchen to guard against cross-contamination. This is a very good sign. They've yet to poison me! \\n\\nBack when I was still tormenting myself with gluten/dairy and making regular visits to the ER, lunchtime favorites included the grilled cheese sandwich and the flatbreads, especially the one involving sausage and grapes and gruyere (or maybe I made that one up--they're great about letting you pick and choose ingredients to concoct your own--the flatbreads are also great for take-out). I also enjoy the raw bar with its various oyster options. This was actually somehow the first place I ever tried oysters, and I've been eating them ever since. The shrimp cocktail is also nice, and the fries are great--thin with just the right amount of crispiness, served with both ketchup and an aoili sauce. \\n\\nNowadays I'm a steak fiend, and for my entree tend to order the hangar steak, which I totally recommend.

My dad faints at the sight of my bloody bald head, but he has revived by the time she's pushed out the afterbirth-covered foil tube.  We are both the same length.  Once I am swaddled, the nurse unwraps the silvery foil of the tube.  It is still warm, but the tortilla is a little dry.\\n\\nFIRST DAY OF SCHOOL:  I cry.  The kids are all much bigger than I am and the teacher - a woman with a heavy accent that I barely understand - has little patience for the timid little girl.  At lunch time, I sneak off into the corner and unwrap my burrito.  The guacamole is soothing.  One of the kids has tortilla chips and we trade parts of our meals.  I make a friend.\\n\\nFIRST KISS:  It's 10 at night and he's dropping me off after a fun afternoon of ice skating.  We can barely see one and other by the light of the moon, and he misses, moist lips grazing the edge of my mouth.  Burritos in hand, our breath smells like onions and the spiciness burns our lips.  This feeling in my stomach is like salsa, butterflies.  I feel like dancing.   We grin and try again.\\n\\nGRADUATION: It's raining and I don't want to be there, but my parents put their foot down and demanded that photo op.  The general atmosphere is one of weary victory.

The smoked chicken salad really hit the spot, but my chicken was a little dry.

Quite good.  \\n\\nThe beer sampler is the way to go.  You can go with their classic six or you can choose your own.  Peruse the big menu, fill out a little slip of paper, and the server will bring back a wooden board with six glasses on it, corresponding to the numbers 1-6 on your list.  I'm not a big fan of hops-heavy beer, which put me in a weird position as most of the Deschutes beers are hoppy IPA-style beers.

The only thing he did say, was that with a group of 6, we were bound to wait, which was fine by us. We put our names in and went to the bar nearby, waiting for them to call us. They said they expected an hour wait for the one big table in the place, and I'd say it was about 40 minutes when they called us back.\\n\\nWe decided to order family style, so we could share around, because all of us wanted to try a few things off the menu. I wouldn't say this is the most vegetarian place in the world, because truly, the meat and the noodles were the highlights, but I'm sure there are a couple of options there. But even that can be argued, I also loved the service, the atmosphere and the different glasses that they provided us with, to use for each of the different drinks we ordered. They have beers and rice wines and fruit wines, definitely try a little bit of both! \\n\\nThe ribs were great, though mostly bone, so don't expect much meat. We ordered another beef option, fried rice, 2 noodle dishes. We could have ordered more for the group, but this ended up being just fine with drinks and what not. \\n\\nThey have different spice levels that you can order as, we ordered a 4 on one of the noodles and a 2 on the other. The two had no spice at all and the 4 was decent. It was just really good flavor, but not as much heat as I expected. I asked our server to bring me a side of whatever chili paste or sauce I can add to the dish for more spice, she brought out a little shaker of spices and a paste. The server laughed and warned me to use just a little at a time, but actually, it wasn't hot at all. Again, just really good flavor!\\n\\nPricing was normal, nothing too high or very cheap.

They brought out 2 banchan: weak kimchi... like fresh out of the bag from HMart kimchi and some moo. Kimchi is pretty much standard at any Korean restaurant, and I don't think their moo was worth boasting \\"AND SIDE DISHES\\" on their sign. It should really just say \\"AND SIDE DISH\\" singular. \\n\\nThe BBQ was also weak. No table grills, and I'm pretty sure they use just a flat hibachi-style grill in the back. There was no charcoal or open-flame taste in our galbi at all. \\n\\nThe second half of my godeunguh was missing 4/5 of it. It was literally missing. I instagrammed it because it looked so funny. We asked the server what happened to the fish, and he seemed like he didn't know what we were talking about. My guess is: they removed that part of the fish because some of it touches the guts and usually tastes kind of bitter. If that's really the reason why, that's kind of ridiculous to me since anyone over the age of 10 usually eats that part and grows to like it. Even so, if they were just trying to remove that part, they removed way too much. It was literally just the end of the tail left. \\n\\nIt seems like from the reviews here, that their noodles are great.

It has to be the best right?\\n\\nMy mother and I decided to go for lunch when they first opened because we had a Christmas party to go to that evening. It wasn't hard to find. While pulling up I was amazed by the design of the building. I was told by a friend that it used to be an old gas station but nothing about it says \\"gas station\\" anymore. They opened at 11am but the doors were open at about 10 till as we weren't the only ones who wanted to be there early. So we just went ahead inside. We were greeted by the hostess and she led us over by the gigantic windows on the other side of the building. It was a little chilly outside and the sun shining through the windows felt nice. I loved the corrugated metal walls and the huge photo panels of actual \\"street hawkers\\". I'd love to see that at Hawkers Jacksonville. \\n\\nOur server came over soon after and asked us if it was our first time at Hawkers. We explained that we were from Jacksonville and had been to the Hawkers there and she became excited. She explained that the menu was the same but the only difference is that Jacksonville had the tapped beer while they didn't which was fine because we don't drink beer. Instead, Mom ordered Oolong tea and I had Lychee Black Tea. Delish!\\n\\nYou can't go to Hawkers without ordering Roti Canai right? I think my mom is starting to like it as well. The Roti was the same but the curry dipping sauce tasted more spicer than in Jax. We loved it. \\n\\nMom ordered the Char Kway Teo after some convincing that it as delicious (she's a Lo Mein person) while I got the Curry Laksa. I didn't think my soup would be as big as it was, but I managed to finish it all. It was fantabulous! Mom enjoyed her entree as well, even stated that her dish was not as oily as it was back home. Our server came back to check on us and we told her the food was better than Hawkers Jacksonville and she said she would pass that along to the manager. That's when the manager Victor came over to our table. He was very appreciative of the feedback from the Jacksonville restaurant as they are working on opening another location in central Florida. Wow, glad I could help.\\n\\nWhenever I'm in Orlando, I will definitely try to stop over at Hawkers because yes, IT IS THAT GOOD and I will definitely bring friends.

Hawkers happened to be the only place advertising in the South East US, and was within three miles of my house. \\n\\nI stopped into their oriental-chic Orlando location (which dons two stone Guardian Lions at the entrance) and ordered two Ramen Burgers with extra sriracha - one for the road, and one for my abode. Service was positive, attentive, and quick. The staff is really cool - I advise actually chatting with them, they're not the typical bunch of servers - smart cookies.\\n\\nI received my two boxes rather quickly. I opened the take first take out box while sitting in my car and was amazed at the size of the burger - this was a legit burger - 8 oz of meat, I expected something smaller. I lifted this delicacy to my mouth while reversing out of the parking lot, bit down on a crunchy buttery ramen bun and into the fresh greens, spicy sriracha, and juicy meat...oh man. I stopped the car, and looked down at this crunchy, soft, explosion of flavor I held in my hand. This my friends is love at first bite. \\n\\nI quickly wolfed my first burger down in the parking lot, and raced home to eat the second one in front of my friends (who all ended up at Hawkers the next day to return the the favor by sending me snapchats of wonderful Ramen burgers and Roti Canai). The Ramen Burger is no longer available (for now) seeing as it was a seasonal item, but I made sure to stop by a few more times that week to get my fill.\\n\\nI'm in it for the long hall as a Hawkers fan. I've stopped by a few times this last two weeks alone. The Roti Canai is now my third strongest craving (behind TCHO chocolate, and Lineage coffee). I get it every time I come, and make sure that if I have friends/family with me I get a few extra pieces of the roti bread. \\n\\nI also am a big fan of their tea selection, though I more often than not get an iced Vietnamese Coffee because Hawkers has the best in town (Orlando has more than a few good Vietnamese spots, so this is a high compliment).\\n\\nThe Bahn Mi sliders are a great dish to fill up on, and the Kimchi rice bowl never fails to deliver as a hearty meal too. This brings me to my favorite thing about Hawkers - the portion sizes are dead on every time. I go to great restaurants in town 3 to 4 nights a week, and get pretty sad when I get stiffed on portions - it happens at even the best restaurants, but I've yet to experience it here. \\n\\nAlso, the beer selection is extensive. The wine too. You won't find that at any asian restaurants in town - in fact, half the beer list is quality craft beers you won't find anywhere except redlight redlight or imperial.

If the little dish goes back to the kitchen with almost all the cheese on most plates - you'd like to believe that the chef might notice and change that up a bit.

I do have to say that it came with asparagus.  When one's accustomed to always having the sides be biscuits, coleslaw, mashed potatoes, and gravy, it does seem a bit odd to have a healthy veggie with it.

While in the highly competitive Brookline area, riddled with Japanese places, they still deliver delicious food and different Japanese food from the mainstream Japanese sushi houses. This is one of the few places around I always hear Japanese spoken amongst the patrons. This is a sure sign of a winner!  After discovering Shiki as a great homey izakaya style establishment (Japanese pub food) that had an extensive sake (Japanese alcoholic beverage made from rice) selection coupled with delicious food and their amazing, beautiful kaiseki (multicourse or haute cuisine)lunches (one of their trademarks!), I was ecstatic. Are you a sake lover? Then you should try their sake sampler flight too! This was not another ho-hum Japanese place with only the usual menu choices.\\n \\nA burnt orange colored sign is outside of this garden level restaurant space (about 8 steps down). The lower level is welcoming with few chairs and tables with soothing autumn colors and simple d√©cor.  Shiki is closed on Mondays, while they are open for lunch and dinner from Tuesdays to Sundays.\\n \\nOver time some menu standards are now occasional specials or their will have some special meals too. Their extensive menus has some favorites as  such tempura, tonkatsu, udon, sushi and even the much maligned but also beloved fermented natto beans  (stinky smelling and gooey texture) is not for everyone even to some  Japanese. One can eat a variety of delicious dishes and explore or just stick to the basics. Plus their bountiful menu choices range from a few dollars up until the teens, so depending on what one eats, it doesn't have to be a break the bank experience.\\n \\nOff the special tapas menu, we got the Ankimo (monkfish liver) which is amazing and if you are a foie gras fan, here is the ocean's equivalent! Nestled in a silvery bowl with a bright broth with pickled seaweed, radish, and topped with scallions accentuates the smooth silky texture and taste of the sea without the guilt. Next came the Beef Tongue, sliced thinly and cooked to perfection with simple seasoning garnished with a lemon wedge. Each bit was heavenly and not overly greasy but the taste and chewiness that tongue was enjoyable.  Note that both these dishes are not always available.\\n \\nIt was a cold night, so the Chawanmushi we ordered totally hit the spot. A Japanese steamed egg custard dish served with a delicate broth studded with many surprises of mushrooms, chicken, fish cake and seafood really satisfied with its lightness, warmth and freshness. Next came the artful Scallop Tartar, it consists of chopped raw scallops mixed with mayo and shiso (Japanese Perilla herb) then encased by smoked salmon in a log shape.  The mayo mix and the scallop's sweetness were a good balanced by the slight saltiness from the smoked salmon.\\n \\nYou never can go wrong with Black Cod Miso, which is my favorite ever since I first ate it in LA many moons ago. This oily, flaky fish black cod (aka sable fish) is cooked after being marinated in the house miso marinade. Cooked to perfection, the tastes all balance out to accentuate the soy miso marinade but the richness of this fish pairs nicely with some rice. Then next was the Sea Eel Millefeuille that had layers of sea eel and nagaimo (Japanese yam) topped by a poached egg in a light broth.   The texture of this dish might not be for everyone, but the flavors with the soft marinated eel, crunchy yam, runny egg with the broth makes for a pleasant and interesting texture and taste combination.\\n \\nWe ended our meal simply with ice cream-one scoop of green tea and one scoop of red bean. Both flavors were delicious and not overpowered by sugar while maintaining a great balance of green tea and red bean flavor respectively. The other two dessert choices the green tea milk cake and the sweet potato apple cake were sold out for the night. Maybe another night, but the next time you want to try some different Japanese food in a cozy atmosphere, go check out Shiki!"},{"name":"North By Northwest Restaurant & Brewery - Stonelake","address":"10010 Capital Of Tx Hwy N","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I grew up in the Northwest (Oregon) and this place has a Portland feel to it.

Reviewers seem to really love it or hate it.  I'm going to be one of the people who love it and I have to be honest, I don't think the haters have presented very many good reasons for their dislike.  For example:\\n\\nThe parking? You might as well give the Saucer a bad review because you got stuck in traffic on the way there.  It certainly doesn't reflect on the food, beer, atmosphere or service.  \\n\\nAnd apparently college students going to a bar in a college town is justification for a bad review. I hope you're also giving every other bar within 20 blocks of UT a bad review too.\\n\\nOh, and guess what, it get's busy in the evenings. You might not get served right away.  Shock, shock, horror, horror.\\n\\nI've been to the Flying Saucer three times.  So far, every experience I've had has been positive.  The bratwurst plate was very good, and their premium burgers were surprisingly delicious.  I forget exactly what they call them on the menu, but you basically get to choose between some fancy cheeses and a fancier bun.  Our server was as attentive as possible given how busy the place can be.  We didn't get every little thing right exactly when we might have liked, but I didn't feel neglected either.\\n\\nThe one common criticism I do agree with is the short skirt dress code.  I just don't really think that it adds anything to the experience and it seems to contradict the atmosphere.  They're going for a cozy, warm, casual,  pub like experience, but then the waitresses are dressed like they are in a pre-pubescent teenager's wet dream in which he opens a British themed pub, but then has all the waitresses wear skirts that are much to short to be practical given the nature of the job just so he can ogle their calves and maybe, just maybe, sneak a peak when they bend over to pick something up.\\n\\nSo, to sum up, I've enjoyed the food, haven't had a problem with the service, the parking's not as bad as some make it out to be, it gets busy - deal with it, and the dress code is kinda stupid.\\n\\nUpdate - 30-Oct-2011\\nIt's been awhile and I had forgotten I wrote this.

The bun is probably 6 so you've got 2 inches sticking out on either side.  It makes for quite the sight and allows for many bites that are just dog.  The smoked taste is very prevalent.

I'm normally not a fan of deep fried rolls, but I really liked the sumo roll. It had great flavor and was fried very lightly. Pan seared escolar tasted very buttery, but was a bit tough. I absolutely LOVED the hamachi crudo---just melted in your mouth. We got chicken and scallop hibachi with extra veggies. Chicken was pretty standard and I wish we had gotten steak, but the scallops were just great---large and cooked perfectly. Our server was very nice.

It was fast and I did not have to work with someone at the register who was multitasking and not paying attention to what people said. My food came out quickly, but was missing the .95 piece of cheese I paid for. As others have said, the burger is very small and I knew this going in, so I ordered a shake too. It never came. On my way out, I went back to the register to be ignored for 2 minutes and then when I said I never got my shake, I was told it was because I ordered from the kiosk and they can't see what is ordered there. Then, she asked for my receipt. I was lucky I had saved it because I am traveling for business. Of course I had to look through many receipts to find it. She was rude through the whole process and other customers were even shaking their heads. I got my milkshake, but no apology for the mistake, just chastised again for ordering through the kiosk.

Cheap & 3. Delicious.  I travelled thousands of miles for some of the best seafood in the land and I find...one of the best THAI restaurants?  Yes.\\n\\nMy Overall Rating - 5 Stars (Atmosphere, Service, Food, Return)\\n\\nAtmosphere - Pad Thai Caf√© is a fast casual restaurant, meaning as you walk into the restaurant, you walk up to the counter to place your order. It's super casual but clean.  You'll find some non-descript tables & chairs on the inside but a nice patio outside.  There' not much charm here, but since it's pretty much a fast food place I'll give it a pass.  1 Star.\\n\\nService - Ok, you have to be careful here, because it's a legit Thai restaurant with a HUGH menu on the wall.  Take some time to figure out what you want so you don't hold up the line.  Once you place your order, the food comes out fast.  We must have ordered 7+ dishes & they call out within 10 minutes.  Lightning fast & hot.  1 Star.\\n\\nFood - It's cheap, but that doesn't mean it's cheap.  You won't pay much but you'll get generous portions that are high quality.  The Pad Woon Sen has a great mix of vegetables with marinated chicken to go with the glass noodles.  It passed the kid test.  The crispy basil chicken was my favorite dish.  The chicken was well marinated with a crispy outside but tender inside.  When eaten with (spicy) fried rice or excellent pad thai you'll wonder wear the food went 5 minutes later.  The beef salad was as tender as it was spicy (the way it should be).  And the ender was a perfect mango sticky rice that looked like it was prepared in a fancy pants restaurant.  Yes, it's cheap....it's darn good cheap.  2 Stars.\\n\\nWill I Return? - Yes. Ok, I'm going to say it, I think Pad Thai Caf√© is better than most Thai restaurants in my home town of Dallas.  I can't believe the incredible value.  If you're a fan of Thai food or you're cheap (or both!) then bookmark this place.  1 Star.\\n\\nMy Yelp Rating Scale (Sum of all parts):\\n1 Star - Atmosphere - Is it a cool dive?  Perhaps an upscale place?  No matter the type, atmosphere plays a big part and I'll give a star if I like it or thinks it has great charm.\\n1 Star - Service - You can have a great meal with bad service.  But that's also what can make a five star joint drop to four.  It's important to the dining experience that service is great and on point.\\n2 Stars - Food - I'll award up to two stars for the food, since this is the main reason we dine out.  Sometimes the extra star is given for value, but it's really all about the food.\\n1 Star - Will I come back? - If I know for a fact I'll return, I'll give this a star. A place has to make an impression for me to return. \\n\\nEach Category can be given up to 1 star except food (2 stars) because I consider all these categories important to the overall dining experience.

I didn't try the onion rings (they were thick cut and huge, which is not my preferred kind of onion ring). Jalapeno poppers--missing bacon or seasoning, it was very bland. Wings--they only offered us the option of mild, even though they advertise several different variety of sauces, and the mild was also lacking seasoning. Chicken tenders--probably the BEST chicken tenders I have had in Orlando. So delicious, the breading was thin, so it didn't just taste like fried food, and the chicken was juicy. Pickle fries--AMAZING. I generally prefer pickle chips, but once again, not over breaded so that you could actually taste the pickle. My only complaint is that there is usually a spicy or horseradish dip, but the waitress seemed confused when I asked for one and brought me what amounted to seasoned mayo.\\n\\nI don't normally eat super heavy, but the chicken and bacon pancakes were calling my name. Once again, had the amazing chicken tenders, but holy cow, the pancake was awesome. SO SO Good. I can't remember the last time before this meal I ate to the point of wanting to throw up because of how good the pancakes were. My husband also loved the bacon. There were 2 big downsides to the plate: the gravy and the combination. The gravy was not good. The sausage tasted like ground beef. THe dish would have been better off without the gravy, as it basically just made the pancakes and chicken fingers soggy. The combination. The components (minus the gravy) were all delicious separately, but did not really meld together well.\\n\\nI also tried my husband's garlic parmesan fries--super garlicky, which he loved, just not my style.\\n\\nService: Mediocre. The waitress was attentive, but seemed to get confused with any of our questions. The hosts also seemed a little caught off guard any time a party walked through the doors.\\n\\nPrices: I get that this is prime tourist real estate, but the prices were pretty high for a dolled up breakfast and a burger.

My favorite is still Apizza Scholls (a similar style of pizza, but their crust is a bit more crisp which makes for a better pizza, in my opinion).  At this point, I'd probably rank this place as second place after Apizza and I will definitely be coming back.  \\n\\nThere were four of us on a Saturday evening around 6.30.  The wait was pretty long (at least forty-five minutes) and the small waiting area was a tight squeeze where you had to continually shift around to let the hostess access the menus, wait-list book, phone, etc.  The turnover of tables seemed to be fairly slow (people lingering) and people kept coming in, regardless.  Anyway, when we finally got our table, we were seated in possibly the best booth directly across from their beautiful pizza oven, so we got to watch the pizaiolos expertly create their amazing pizzas.\\n\\nThe liter of house red for $21 was a good deal and lasted throughout the meal.  We ordered the margherita DOC, the putanesca, and the via tribunali.  All were great, but the margherita was probably the best.  DOC indicates that it's made with authentic mozarella di bufala (they have one with standard mozarella for $4 less).  Their tomato sauce is the best I've ever had.  It's imported pomodoro tomatoes that have been roasted and then crushed. \\n\\nThe via tribunali pizza was second best.  A pizza with a bunch of things in it like rapini, smoked mozarella and sausage.  They then fold it into thirds so it's almost like a stromboli before putting it in the oven.  It's then topped with arugula.  \\n\\nThe putanesca was pretty good, but it became a bit limp under the layer of cheese and the cherry tomato halves.  \\n\\nSpeaking of limpness, that's actually the reason why I still rank the pie at Apizza Scholls above this place.  I'd almost deign to ask them to cook the pizza an extra 30 seconds or so (beyond the 45 seconds they cook them... seriously, that's as long as they leave 'em in there).  Not sure if we'd get thrown out for that, but it's maybe worth a shot?\\n\\nThe waitress talked us into trying the tiramisu which, in a distinctly First World luxury fantasy-land, is FLOWN IN FROM MILAN.  Not frozen.  Just refrigerated and FLOWN IN.  I have mixed feelings about that, but goddamn was that amazing tiramisu!\\n\\nOh, and the pizzas are about 12\\" in diameter and can be considered \\"personal pizzas\\", though the four of us were perfectly satisfied with three and we didn't even have a salad or appetizer.  Secondly, some people were getting pizzas to go or taking left-overs.  I don't think I would do that because these pizzas should be eaten the minute they come out of the oven.  Letting them get cold is not only a shame and a travesty, but a waste of your money.  Eat there!

While sad that it's not the actual brewery itself, going to the brewpub was pretty much just as exciting -- plus they served delicious food with their beer! A perfect combo. They were closed for mild renovations for the first full day that Boyfriend and I were in Portland and we were afraid that they wouldn't reopen in time before we had to go, but luckily they reopened that Saturday!\\n\\nI love their choices in doing taster flights. We were presented with two choices: The Classic taster flight (consisting of more traditional beer styles) and the Brewer's Choice taster flight (more specialized craft styles). Or, if neither of those necessarily suit your fancy, you could mix and match any six tasters between all the beers that Deschutes had available. Boyfriend and I settled for the Classic and the Brewer's Choice and settled in for food.\\n\\nI ordered the root beer braised pork belly and Boyfriend got their grilled cheese. While my pork belly was a bit on the dinky side, I'm glad that the plate ended up being hugely smaller because the grilled cheese was a LOT bigger than I anticipated! So between the two dishes (and the ever-so-filling beer), we were plenty stuffed by the time we rolled out of the restaurant.\\n\\nThe pork belly was so incredibly cooked that it seriously just fell apart in my mouth. And it went excellently with the poached egg on top (especially once that yolk was dripping all over the meat, ahskjgsd so good) and the mustard! I don't normally like mustard, but this was some good stuff. And the grilled cheese was phenomenal. Huge, and a tad greasy, it was more than enough for each of us to eat half of it.\\n\\nAnd the beer. Pretty damn amazing stuff. And only $8 each for the sampler flights! While I'm not the biggest fan of IPAs (which sucks, since we're in the Pacific Northwest), there were still plenty of amazing beers that I thoroughly enjoyed -- like the pale ale, the porter and the stout.\\n\\nThis place is definitely worth a visit.

I wanted to go to Changs tonight, but my 15-year-old stepdaughter suggested this place instead.  We decided to give it a try because she raved about the food.   When we got there the hostess/waitress seemed less than excited for more visitors and kindly seated our party of five at a table for four, with an added chair on the end.  Never mind that there were numerous booths in the vicinity, she seated us next to a lady with a kid and stroller who were kindly crammed into the corner.  I could have asked for a booth, but two of my party wanted to watch the game on tv and the table allowed them to do so, so we stayed put.  I was irritated that she didn't ask for our seating preferences after arguing with the hostess in front of us as to where they would put our party.\\n\\nAfter placing our order we waited a LONG time for our food, and the restaurant was not busy.  We were there on a Thursday night at 7 pm for heaven's sake, but still we waited probably 30 minutes for our food to arrive.  I ordered the steak salad and I honestly wish that they would have just forgotten my order.  My $14.99 \\"steak\\" salad arrived on a bed of romaine with chopped tomatoes and FOUR pieces of overcooked steak--probably less than 2 ounces of meat.  Everyone else in my party ordered sandwiches that were loaded with meat, but the steak salad did not see that much action.\\n\\nThe service was slow and \\"douchy\\" (a term I saw in another review that I thought nailed it on the head), and to be honest, it really hurt to give a 15% tip (that's 10 bucks I'll never get back; however, since the service wasn't HORRIBLE I didn't feel okay about undertipping.)\\n\\nThere was a positive in the experience.  I have three teenage kids and they all devoured their meals.  These are also kids who devour McDonald's, so take that for what it's worth.  \\n\\nBasically, as the grown up, my rules for dining out are that if I am going to PAY someone to cook me dinner it damn well better than something I can make at home.  Seriously, the steak salad at Sheri's is consistently WAY better than this sorry excuse for a salad.

The gyros, chicken and kebabs are mediocre and definitely not worth going out of your way for. What does stand out is a pretty delicious, fast Greek salad. It's rather standard, but I'd still stop in for one if I'm in the area. \\n\\nYou can sit and eat in the restaurant, and it is fairly clean, with nice tables and booths. If you show up, order, and wait for take-out around lunch or dinner time, be prepared for a wait. The upside to this particular Daphne's is the staff: they are kind and courteous, if a little airheaded. They once gave us a free entree simply for being the only customers on that particular afternoon. On my first visit, however, they gave me an incorrect order. I'm sure had I complained, they would have quickly righted it, and probably thrown in some free, pasty baklava to boot. \\n\\nNot worth a third visit, but if you're looking for a greasy simulation of a nation's national cuisine, here's your place."},{"name":"Kells Brewery","address":"210 NW 21st Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Good place to watch football (the real one not NFL).

I owe it to Yelp for having found one of my most favorite places.\\n\\nFirst day:  After flying in from IAD and checking into my hotel, I was thrilled to find the NM was only a few miles away.  I walked the entire place to check it all out and couldn't decide what to eat.  I decided to get a bratwurst and root beer.  Pretty good, but the bratwurst was -nothing- like I'm used to getting in Germany.  For dessert, I went to a Belgian crepe place and got one with Nutella and bananas.  It was delicious as dessert and I thought I was going to explode after that meal.  As I was leaving, I noticed one of the food stands boxing up food to give away for FREE so they would not have to waste it by throwing it out.  Items I saw that were free for the taking included mashed potatoes, some chicken, and vegetables.  Seriously, who does cool stuff like this any more?  \\n\\nSecond day:  Stopped in for dinner.  I stopped by the hot sauce shop and was met by the nicest proprietor.  She encouraged and allowed me to sample anything and everything.  I ended up buying a couple of salsas, a hot sauce and a marinade.  All because of her.  And because her stuff was locally made and *that* good.  Also had Pho Ga for the first time from a Vietnamese place and it was outstanding.  Had ice cream at Jenni's after and couldn't believe the variety of unusual flavors.  I had the red hot apple cider sorbet and Thai chili.  Sublime.\\n\\nThird Day:  Went to a Middle Eastern place and ordered the portobello mushroom salad and kibbeh, then had to make one more stop at Jeni's before leaving town.  I got the red hot apple cider one more time, along with the gravel road, which was delish.  \\n\\nThis place is a must stop if you are in CMH.  Local businesses, friendly people, and damn if that Jeni's doesn't ship.  I can see me ordering some of this ice cream fo sho.

Also immediately noted was the fact that tables were very close together for an expensive place and we overheard the lady next to us say she didn't like the food and servers kept coming to ask if she \\"liked her replacement dish better.\\"\\n\\nSo we started with the salmon yuzuviche  ($12) which was decent. There was a citrus flavor with lots of ginger. For the first dish it wasn't bad and we thought it was to start off the night with a ginger palate cleanser....no actually every dish after that had an excessive ginger kick that was not balanced/umami like so many other restaurants we have been to (ie One sushi or Brush Izakaya).\\n\\nNext we had the house salad with ginger dressing. The ginger overpowered the flavor of anything else and had almost a curry like flavor. Didn't like it. Next we had the Divers scallops that come in a little fire pot. The pot quickly began to over-boil and again there was too much ginger and lemon and it tasted like the ginger dressing had been put into this as well!\\n\\nFinally we had a grocery store worthy Hurricane roll for $20.

Originally being from the Quad Cities Metropolitan Area that has limited options for Vietnamese and Thai food, we were delighted to find such an overwhelming abundance of restaurants in the Portland/Seattle area. While heading back to Portland after spending a couple of nights in Seattle, we decided to stop by this little joint for lunch today since it had such high ratings and a menu very similar to a Vietnamese sandwich shop/bakery we visited in Biloxi, Mississippi a few years ago. I will admit that prior to entering, I read some of the negative reviews out of curiosity (to which some made me die of laughter) and was a little iffy about trying it out, but hey, new experiences!\\n\\nThe moment we entered the restaurant, the host/waiter told us to sit anywhere we wanted. When we sat down at a table, I couldn't help but notice the demolished fortune cookie and paper fortune on the floor next to our table that had apparently been stepped on and abandoned. My fianc√© also noticed used napkins on the floor underneath our table that the employees also failed to clean up the entire time we were there.\\n\\nThe instant we sat down, the same host/waiter practically threw glasses of water at us and asked if we knew what we wanted to order, which kind of bothered me because I hadn't even gotten a chance to glance at the menu yet. The restaurant wasn't even that busy, and I couldn't figure out why he was frantically rushing around like it was.\\n\\nI finally decided on the #75 (grilled lemongrass chicken), and my fianc√© got the Vietnamese curry. Not more than a few minutes later, one of the kitchen workers came stumbling out and plopped a bowl of what looked like beef pho in front of me. I was super confused. A minute or so later, he came back with a plate that he was trying to serve to an individual at the table next to us. We had to tell him that was mine, and he took the bowl of pho I luckily didn't touch and brought it over to the other table. It was a little while later before my fianc√© got his food, and the extent of the waiter being personable was asking if \\"everything was good\\" repeatedly, and if my fianc√© wanted a drink refill, both while appearing distracted.\\n\\nA lot of reviewers complained about the meat being gristly, and I was concerned because I'm very picky about my meat. To my surprise, there actually wasn't a whole lot of gristle on it. However, I couldn't make out any flavor of lemongrass. It was just plain grilled chicken that had been lightly marinated like the chicken on a stick that you get at fairs. I could barely get down a spoonful of soup because it tasted toxic, and my fianc√© agreed when he tried a small drop of it on his finger. The salad was very dry and basic and would have been much better with some sort of ginger or peanut dressing on it. My fianc√©'s Vietnamese curry was okay, but even back at home, we've been able to get the same thing with way more flavor.\\n\\nIn addition to the frantic host/waiter and befuddled kitchen worker, one of the busboys seemed to be sitting/standing around a lot and periodically pretending to do his job.  \\n\\nThis place was such a disappointment, and I still don't understand why it has such high ratings. We left with our dishes still full and stomachs still hungry. My fianc√© almost always eats his entire plate when we consume Asian cuisine.

The only reason I gave this place even a single star is because they did make a decent Bloody Mary, other than that this was hands down the worst dining experience I've had in Portland. We sat at the bar, which was dirty, and waited while the bartender walked by us several times without even acknowledging us. After about five minutes she finally put some menus in front of us and asked if we wanted drinks. Like I said, the drinks were good, but that was about it. The Cobb omelette I had was really unpleasant - over cooked chicken, undercooked bacon, rubbery eggs. My boyfriend was satisfied with his eggs Benedict, but not wowed. If the bartender had ever bothered to check back with us after a few bites to see how everything was I would've ordered something else, but she never did, and she never bothered to bring water, jam for my toast, or silverware. I got these things from a busser I stopped. We waited and waited for our check while the bartender ignored us and chatted with the manager and other employees about five feet from us. I finally flagged the manager down and requested it. I myself am a bartender, so I'm really pretty understanding - if someone is struggling with a lot of customers and gets overwhelmed I get that, but we were two of six or seven patrons sitting at the bar and we were blatantly ignored.

There is the ordering window inside and the lucky recipient window outside. So we waited, took a little bit but let me tell you, maybe it was the year long Gyro withdrawal or the previous disappointments but this Gyro at Nicks was the best Gyro I had - ever.

I am currently working in a restaurant, and I can assure you that this behavior would never be tolerated around guests. \\nThe really bad: DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THE SIDE ORDERS. I ordered the side croissant. For $2.00 I thought that was good value.   I should have known better. The croissant was smaller than the palm of my hand. It was laughable. My whole table  couldn't believed that it didn't come with my meal but that I paid extra money for it. It would have  been accurately described as a 'mini croissant' on the menu. I asked to switch to the pain au chocolat but it was also going to be 'mini'.  I politely complained to the waitress and she told me that is what I get.

Our server was very personable but the actual service wasn't extraordinary. It was more than 30 minutes before we even had a chance to order our appetizers Overall we enjoyed our food but we didn't feel like it should be deemed one of the best restaurants in buckhead. My trout was great, as were the mussels and white bean soup, but I just wasn't blown away. A random tip: you can park in the parking deck at the restaurant for an hourly rate, or you can pay the valet $2.00 plus tip (which turns out to be the same amount). The young man at the valet station was incredibly eager and polite so I recommend putting your four or five dollars into the pocket of a hard-working college student rather than a garage machine."},{"name":"Passport Sips & Tapas","address":"59 Washington St","city":"Weymouth","stars":"4","text":"Really wanted to like this place!

There were chairs out from a wedding that happened earlier and I was definitely jealous of that party!\\n\\nFrom the start, our waitstaff were very pleasant and informed, quickly taking orders and well informed about the wines on the menu.

The wines we had with dinner (one white, one red, can't remember what they were) were excellent.\\n\\nSo what was wrong?  The food!\\n\\nOne of my friends was a vegetarian and they didn't have any vegetarian entrees on the menu.  No worries, in this case he normally has the chef just create something with items on hand.  The meal he got was disappointing, boring, and looked like someone had just taken handfuls of whatever non-animal protein foodstuff in the kitchen and mixed it together.\\n\\nMy appetizer (corn soup) was delicious.  Flavorful, and a very generous portion.  I was excited for the rest.  Then came the hazlenut crusted cod -- so salty at first bite I almost sent it back, but my hunger won out.  The rest of the cod was not much better and I ended up eating mostly the beans that surrounded the fish.  Another girl had the scallops, and they also suffered from being \\"aggressively seasoned.\\"  \\n\\nDessert was also a disappointment, with the table's best dessert being the three ice creams.  My peanut butter chocolate dessert was rich, but definitely too sweet for my taste (I am not a fan of the American sweetness).

The apps literally came out two minutes after we ordered them.  The tuna tartare was inedible and looked like cat food on top of ice cold rice and the empanadas came directly out of the microwave and were very bland.  I ordered the filet (medium) with a side of grilled asparagus and my wife ordered the filet (medium) & scallops.  Both filets were over cooked and drowned in the mushroom sauce.

The beef bulgogi was a bit bland, only warm and there was quite a bit of water on the bottom of the bowl. The chicken bulgogi was delicious and fresh, as it's topped off with cheese which gives it a nice kick. The handmade Duh Ku Bee noodles was my favorite dish.

Unfortunately, having only heard about it recently, I missed the chance to have it in my entire childhood and college years in California, and now that I'm living in the NYC area there doesn't seem to be a single restaurant around serving Bo Bay Mon. (Searching for Bo Bay Mon near NYC on Yelp gives nothing helpful; googling it only brings up David Chang's Ma Peche, which from the photos doesn't seem authentic at all.) I myself am quite shocked by this, given that this is just Vietnamese food we're talking about, not some random exotic cuisine like Peruvian-Chinese or even Korean-Uzbek! (By the way, both of those do exist in NYC, and the former is called chifa after chi fan, the Chinese characters for eating rice.)\\n\\nThe way Bo Bay Mon works is as follows: At the beginning, the server brings you a bowl of hot water, a stack of rice paper, some vermicelli, and various vegetables like lettuce, basil, mint, and bean sprouts. Each course, they will bring you the meat and possibly a hot pot for you to cook it in. You dip the rice paper in the water, add the meat, vegetables, and vermicelli, and wrap it up.\\n\\nThese are the seven courses we were served, in order (though 4-6 were brought together):\\n\\n1. Slices of beef and a hot pot filled with vinegary water.\\n2. Slices of marinated beef and a hot pot with butter.\\n3. Slices of marinated beef, to be consumed raw.\\n4. Beef morsels wrapped in a leaf. Like a dolma, but with beef and Vietnamese seasonings inside.\\n5. Beef sausages.\\n6. A large beef meatball on prawn crackers.\\n7. Beef congee.\\n\\nThe food was excellent. My favorite course was the second, since the butter really enhanced the flavor of the already seasoned beef. You could tell that the raw beef slices in the first three courses were very fresh, though for the latter courses a little less so. We also got Vietnamese-style filter coffee, which is stronger than drip coffee but weaker than espresso.\\n\\nThe service was very good. Our waitress was very diligent in bringing over all the dishes, and changing the water when it got cold (the rice paper won't stick if you dip it in insufficiently hot water). She offered to explain how to eat the meal, but since someone in our group had had this before we were fine.\\n\\nNote that they offer portion sizes for only two or three people ($32 or $42, respectively, which is pretty low for what is considered fine Vietnamese dining). However, we had four people and ordered the three-person portion, but did not feel hungry afterwards. \\n\\n81/100"},{"name":"Madras Pavilion","address":"9025 Research Blvd, Ste 100","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I went there specifically to eat paneer dosa that I had been craving for for a little while now.

Now this is our new 'Pinthouse' when we want a close spot with quick food and guaranteed space to sit.\\n\\nWe've now been here at least three times, always checked on by one of the owners. I'm pregnant and we ordered the South Austin, and the owner gave me a heads up about the raw meat (prosciutto) and soft cheese as she delivered. I'd already cleared smoked meats and pasteurized soft cheeses with my OB (I'm French, can't help it), but it was nice of her to think of it in case I hadn't.\\n\\nThe pizza is really good, though we've mostly stuck with classic pepperoni basil. Not too thick or overwhelming on any one ingredient. If I had to pick one thing I prefer about Pinthouse's pizza it would be the crust (I like slightly lighter over denser), but both are solid. The last time we went, the other owner came out and delivered a free dessert pizza to our table, citing the extra energy it appeared I'd be needing (again, quite noticeably pregnant). We ate all of that, too...\\n\\nLast, since I can't drink right now I can't personally speak to the beer, but my sister got a Zoe that wasn't as carbonated as usual, and the bartender was very friendly and thanked her for the heads up before letting her swap it out for another brew. I tried the root beer on tap just for fun - it wasn't really my cup of tea, but you'd like it if you're into sweet, creamy sodas. I'm more into light and very bubbly.

Didn't even realize Joy Cafe relocated right next to my house!!! \\n\\nIt was a little bit difficult for us to find the location but it made complete sense once we were sitting on their beautiful outdoor patio on Peachtree St. Just a heads up that if you're driving north on Peachtree St. that you will pass by the Oceanaire Restaurant on your left and the Joy Cafe patio will be immediately after and then the parking deck after that. Joy only validates the parking garage for 1 hour and then it's $2 for each additional 15 minutes.

I attended the Gaelic Storm show there last night. The kitchen is not fully open (only a limited appetizer menu was available), and they just received their liquor pouring permit (only a limited bar menu was available). My guest and I decided to order a bottle of wine. The list was very short as this was not the full operational menu we ordered from. Prices seemed on the high side, but we settled for a $54 bottle of Oregon Pinot Noir. There were rumblings around us from other guests that it would take a very long time to get our drinks so we decided to time it. From the time we ordered to delivery was 48 minutes!  We tried to flag down a server (wasn't happening) until finally ours came back to the table and she was very apologetic and found the sommelier to deliver our wine (we giggled at the whole idea of a sommelier at a concert venue, but this is their gimmick I guess).  We decided to pass on the food ordering as the show was more than half over when we finally got our bottle of wine. For our troubles, the wine was discounted down to $20 without asking. We were quite forgiving as this was their first week open. The winery meets dinner theater concept is sort of an upscale House of Blues or Eddie's Attic. They seem to be going for farm to table-ish types of foods, craft beers and of course wines. Guests can enjoy the \\"pub\\" upstairs without a concert ticket. \\n\\nI'm confident (hopeful?) that service issues will be worked out. In my opinion they were under staffed, and with the tables so packed in tight together and so many people ordering at once -only added to the chaos. We felt very squished and had no room to even get out to use the rest room. \\n\\n The atmosphere, sound quality and general feeling here is good. My final thought is this though:  The person who chose the hard wood modern chairs, with a straight up and down back and zero cushion for a dinner theater set-up should be fired immediately. This was the most uncomfortable chair I have ever experienced in any restaurant anywhere, let alone a music venue whereby guests are expected to sit for 2 hours."},{"name":"Taranto's Pizza Barn","address":"601 Hill Rd N","city":"Pickerington","stars":"3","text":"One of my favorites has slowly declined in my opinion.

It was like a veggie sub instead of an Italian and for the price of $15 it's sad that my husband just left to get us McDonald to eat because we are still hungry after this sub.

They played a ton of 90s music that everyone knew, and they talked to the audience enough that it was fun without being annoying.\\n\\n-The drinks:  They were strong and inexpensive.\\n\\n-The food: I was starving after a day of eating way too healthily, so we got a large order of fries.  For $5, we got the biggest plate of fries I have ever seen.  Seriously.  We had a lot of people sharing them, and it didn't even look like we made a dent at the end.

Why was I being treated in such despotic manner? \\nLastly, I was denied a water refill (and this was the real deal breaker). The waitress that re-filled glasses on the next table had surely seen me politely wave for her attention and for water, but only sneered at me.

There was no disclaimer on the charge especially when it wasn't even freshly prepared [1*]\\n\\n\\n$10.95 Masaman Curry: Tasted really good but had 3 times more potatoes than chicken. The fried rice that he said had eggs, soy sauce and veggies just looked like brown rice. [3*]\\n\\n$4 Curry Puffs: Very flaky and delicious. They need to say it's vegetarian. I was expecting the usual chicken and egg in it which was missing. [4*]\\n\\n$3 Mayalsian Pancake: Roti Canai is known for its light, fluffy, flaky & crispiness. This had none of the above but was chewy and thick. The guy said it came with a little 'dipping' sauce. That's sad because the authentic version should be a curry with potatoes and possibly even chicken in some stores. What I got was about 2oz of watery sauce. [1*] \\nPS - The best Roti Canai is still at Penang's Restaurant on Buford Highway. \\n\\n$12.95 Cantonese Pan Fried Noodles: Great that the crispy noodles came separately. Loved the Shitake mushrooms. Too many snow peas/corn. The sauce overall was good. 4* but still not worth $12.95; [so overall 3*]\\n\\n$10.95 K.L Mee Goreng: The greatest dissapointment. The guy had reassured me that the KL Mee Goreng had tomatoes/cucumbers & was authentic exactly like the \\"Mamak\\" stalls in Malaysia. There was not 1 sliced cucumber. Very generous on the large pieces of shrimp. But that still couldn't make up for the taste which was pretty bland and some parts bitter.

The first time around we went on a Friday, and it wasn't very busy. The beer is pricey. We ordered the Parmesan mac-n-cheese, the French dip, and the fish n' chips. The mac-n-cheese was big, but didn't have much cheese. Personally, the mac-n-cheese across the street at Yard House is much better. The French dip was ordinary, nothing special. But the fish n' chips were apparently very good according to my friend! To end the night, since it was ladies night after 9pm (half off fishbowls and drinks) my friend and I decided to split their FUBAR fishbowl. \\"92 oz\\" of pure sugar is what it should be called. There was little to no alcohol in the fishbowl, and mainly because they're all pre-made. I wouldn't order one again.\\n\\nNow, for the more disappointing part of my experience comes from my second visit. Since we had received a flyer for a free open bar for 2 hours through my company, I figured I would give it another try. The open bar included domestic beer and single shot well drinks. Not a bad deal. But my major disappointment came when we ordered food. We ordered the onion rings, the \\"tenders,\\" and the Parmesan mac-n-cheese. The onion rings had a decent taste, but was 95% breading and little to no onion! The \\"tenders\\" were a joke. They were charging $12 for 6 mini pieces of cut up chicken tenders. Only 4 pieces were actual meat, the other 2 were just fried breading. I asked the bartender if this was what I had ordered, which he confirmed. I asked if it was still $12, which he said yes. When I further told him that that would make it $2/piece he responded that the chefs portion every meal out and that's what it is. I sent the food back (which I never usually do - but there was no way I was going to pay that much for a portion smaller than a kids meal!). The bartender sent the plate back to the kitchen, and came back with double the portion, for a total of 12 pieces of boneless wings. Mac-n-cheese also came in a much smaller portion than my original visit did. I understand that we were there for a free open bar, but the restaurant should not try and cut down the portions and charge the same amount for the same meal that you would normally get a larger portion if you were sitting on the other side of the room. \\n\\ntl;dl Pricey for normal food.

At one point I counted 11 employees behind the counter but there was dirt and debris all over the floor. The walls looked worn. There were multiple tables that had not been cleared. Because there were no clean tables we sat at the high top bar in front of the grill.\\n\\nWe were greeted and helped by a friendly girl. She, and others, checked on us throughout the meal. My companions' meals came before mine, and I waited another 5 minutes or so for mine. Apparently my egg white omelet was messing up their system. When my omelet did come it was the saddest omelet I'd ever seen. It looked like maybe 2 egg whites with a slice of processed cheese in the middle. I wish they had more options like maybe spinach, tomato or turkey. My grits were surprisingly good though. Sticky and coated with a butter that reminded me of movie theater popcorn butter. I'm sure that means it was super unhealthy but it tasted good! I tried a bite of the hash brown- they were OK but I'm glad I got the grits with mine. The bacon was also just OK. I also tried a bite of their waffle which had a very good flavor. Although not thick and crisp like a Belgian (this one was flatter) it had a nice sweet flavor. Prices are super cheap too. \\n\\nAll in all as Brian M. said right along par with other Apopka breakfast joints (Chuck's Wagon, Robinson's). Cheap, fast and simple. Unlike the other places this one is 24 hours and serves breakfast all day. Yes, we ate breakfast at 6pm on a Saturday night.

I've never been a big fan of them in general, but they deep fry them here, and add fresh chopped scallions and a special spice mix for a crispy, delicious treat.  No ketchup required, but it's there if you want it, as is hot sauce and syrup for your pancakes.  Btw, the pancakes were fluffy, sweet, sprinkled with powdered sugar, and really good. Blueberries were added free of charge, and they're not afraid to add plenty of them. The wait staff were friendly, the food was hot, flavorful, and filling.

After twenty more minutes of giving their delivery guy the benefit of the doubt (entering my second hour of waiting) I called the Mass Ave branch to see if they could help. I was brusquely asked if I could screenshot my confirmation email and send it to them (they gave me no email to send them anything), then they told me they would call me back once they sorted everything out (of course, I had to prompt them to take my cell number down so they could return my call).\\n\\nI imagine the food is good (I wouldn't know, I never got the opportunity to try it) but if there is any snafu with your order, chances are good you will only get the runaround rather than dinner.

All that being said, there's something to be said for a simple, unadulterated piece of chocolate cake or apple pie. This is where Southern Sweets Bakery comes in - the dessert offerings are by no means innovative, but they are simple, consistent, and pleasing to the masses. \\n\\nFood: Southern Sweets Bakery is a family-owned bakery that specializes in traditional American dessert offerings, including cakes, pies, cheesecakes, tarts, and dessert bars. I've tried multiple different items during several visits- overall, I've always been satisfied with the desserts from a flavor standpoint, but never particularly impressed with the selection or the manner in which they are decorated and presented. If I'm headed to a dinner party an in need of something to enthuse the guests, it's going to take more than a New York style cheesecake or a red velvet cake with some white chocolate shavings on the side. Although I've never tried them, the bakery also offers casual lunch offerings, including sandwiches, wraps, soups, and salads.  \\n\\nService: I always find the service here to be efficient, but not overly friendly. There is no table service - all orders are placed at the front counter and the staff box up your order as you wait. Lines can form during peak lunch hours, but the wait is typically minimal. \\n\\nAtmosphere: Quaint and casual with no frills - this is not the place to come for an intimate or classy dessert experience. The floor is covered with checkerboard linoleum, the walls are lined with random pieces of local art, and the dessert offerings are haphazardly displayed in a series of diner-like refrigerated cases. Unfortunately, the presentation of the desserts isn't any better - they're served in black plastic clamshell cases.\\n\\nCost: Reasonably priced for the quality and portion. Individual cake slices are $4.40-$5.60, while whole cakes are $23.50-$36.50. Lunch entrees are approximately $6-$10. \\n\\nOther: Southern Sweets Bakery is located in a random industrial park near the Dekalb Farmers Market - the storefront is located is located at the end of Rio Circle furthest from Ponce De Leon. Free parking is available in the unpaved lot directly outside the bakery. Hours of operation are Monday-Friday, 9AM-6PM, Saturday, 11AM-5PM, and Sunday, 11AM-5PM.

The waitress was very nice and took one meal off the check. That night, we were sick. Common denominator: the eggs. I think Joy's is a prime example of how the kitchen falls apart when it is so crowded, as it was on Sunday. Also, a kitchen worker ran out and got in her car, so they were one person short.

I guess there's nothing wrong with sticking to the basics, as long as you do the basics well.  So I went for the basics: pizza.  And it was good.  Good sauce, right ratio of sauce and cheese, tasty toppings.  I was surprised to get Greek-style crust (not deep dish, but medium-thick, though I guess there's nothing inherently non-Italian about that), but I happen to prefer that to thin.  I'm looking forward to trying the rest of the menu.\\n\\nThe reason this place shines to me (and the reason I already need to review after only one visit) is the staff.  Everyone was friendly and attentive as soon as we got there.  Drinks were refilled promptly, servers who weren't working our table asked if we needed anything, and they all wore smiles.  Craziest of all, when our pizza had a pretty minor mistake -- they left off one of the two toppings, and they caught it before the pizza even made it to the table -- they made it right to an impressive degree: not only did they quickly whip us up a pan of the missing topping to put on ourselves, but they gave us the whole large pizza for free.  They wouldn't even let me compromise with them to pay for a small, or pay half, or *something*.

Chicken egg roll filling tasted surprisingly fresh! Pork Baos are a must, but my favorite thing was the BBQ pork Char Siu.  If you like spicy- My wife enjoyed the Malaysian Prawn Mee soup very much.  It was a great dish, but just a bit too spicy to have more than one serving.   Remember it's a share everything setting, and at that cost it's great to order so many different things and be able to enjoy them all.  Our waitress was cool, informative and attentive.

The exterior would never bring in anyone and does not reflect what is offered inside (pictures of spaghetti and french fries?!).  The interior is similarly uninteresting but clean.

He is always here but his 'staff' is a sole, really great waitress (as well as take-out order taker, take-out packer, cashier, etc.) but when she's out, it's up to him to do it all.

I'm trying to decide if part of my negative experience stems from the fact that my favorite dish at Sam Sneed's from long ago is no longer on the menu. Read this through the filter of: the reviewer went in with one expectation and received something else.\\nThe two stars are both for our excellent server and the friendly host staff. The lack of subsequent stars comes from: 1) It took 30+ minutes to receive our lunch orders and it did not seem overly busy. 2) For the price, the portions seemed very small. 3) The quality of the food was not what I remember from the past. My son, however, gave the kids meal of chicken tenders to enthusiastic thumbs up. Perhaps I will order that next time and see how it goes, but the crabcake that I had read so much about seemed inordinately sweet. I know they make them there fresh, so my only thought is perhaps the binding agent received too much of a sweet ingredient and not enough lemon or some other acid. \\nMy aunt ordered the chicken enchiladas. She said they were OK, but would not order them again. I tasted them and was similarly underwhelmed. There was so much of the sauce that the freshness of the ingredients inside was drowned out. \\nIt is a classy joint, to be sure, and the decor is a lot of fun especially for golf fans out there.

We arrived as a fairly casually dressed (most patrons where dressed in a minimum of business casual) and diverse racial party. The only reason I make note of these two qualities is because I saw other reviewers comment on the lack of diversity at the restaurant and fairly formal, elderly clientele. I must agree with their comments - the mix up is fairly older white individuals, but this in no way implies a negative. They were just as pleasant to our crowd as any other. Not to mention, we were definitely the youngest group at the restaurant. \\n\\nThe Experience:\\nCanoe's initial impressions where a bit mixed. Set in a mini-strip mall the exterior of the restaurant leaves something to be desired, but upon entrance you clearly see why it is so highly rated. The interior is amazing, but the view and garden are what make it worthwhile. Overlooking, the banks of the Chattahoochee River, Canoe's setting is truly perfect. The gardens are amazing to walk in while waiting for your appetizers or while sipping your first cocktail. \\n\\nThere is no need for me to go into extreme detail to describe the delicious food (you can simply look at their on-line menu), but the portions, variety, and overall quality is definitely a distinguishing quality of the restaurant. Again to address other reviews, the prices are steep, but then again if you check the menu prior to arriving you are fully aware of this quality. \\n\\n\\nOther Notes:\\nUnfortunately, the night we went (yesterday) a slight storm happened to pass through Atlanta. As we were waiting on our check, the storm hit causing a giant tree in the garden to collapse on the outdoor seating and awning. As the emergency lighting quickly flicked on, we saw our waitress and almost the entire Canoe staff (everyone from the manager, bus boys, and even kitchen staff) jump into action to quickly help the people that were sitting under the outdoor awning. The paramedics and ambulances were immediately called for the outdoor patrons, but luckily it seemed that almost everyone was fine. The staff was extremely helpful and could have done nothing more in the situation. Let it be noted, that the storm was extremely intense and caused several other tress in the area to fall, and actually closed several roads in the area. \\n\\n\\nSummary:\\nOverall, I believe the setting, experience, and food are definitely what distinguish Canoe as a top-tier restaurant. It is extremely unfortunate that the outdoor awning was severally damaged, and I came to learn that only two years prior Canoe had actually flooded. I am glad that they were able to rebound from the flood, and have no doubt that their excellent food and service will keep patrons coming back (and hopefully the outdoor setting will be fixed as soon as possible). \\n\\nOn a side note, I recently read that they have an option for a private menu in the garden for a small group titled, \\"Chef's Organic Vegetable Garden\\". Once I go, I will update my review!"},{"name":"Anh Hong","address":"291 Adams St","city":"Dorchester","stars":"4","text":"I had bo bay mon (beef cooked in 7 ways) at least twice.

Omg, the beef and butter is to die for! specially with a lot of butter and lemon grass ( do be careful cause sometimes the oil gets messy). The vinegar on the other hand is also delish and its less messy.

I found the sushi to be bulky and heavy on the rice--it didn't let the fish shine. The eel wasn't of great quality. The dumplings were crunchy, which seemed a bit off. I liked the egg in the unatama don, but again the eel was a bit gristly. I found it lacking texture and any nuanced flavor. The okonomiyaki was fine. Again, there wasn't anything bad--but nothing of appreciation. I'm a fan of subtle, understated flavors, especially with sushi--but I just wasn't getting anything exciting from these dishes.   \\nThe staff, however, was extremely friendly.
