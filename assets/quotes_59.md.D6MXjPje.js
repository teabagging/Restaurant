Only because I had such high expectations. Once you are exposed to Dutch Monkey doughnuts, you become a different type of doughnut consumer.\\n\\nAfter making the trek from Decatur Square to Revolution Doughnuts with a good friend on a very warm Saturday just this very past weekend, I was thinking that my hard effort had better be paid off royally. We were both sweating buckets and were completely parched. I eyed a water dispenser with clear plastic cups to the side and decided that free FILTERED water (as the sign on the dispenser displayed) would be the route I would take to satisfy my thirst. My non-complaining and good-trouper friend opted for the peach (I think that was the flavor) iced tea. When I got closer to the doughnut case, I was immediately excited because the doughnuts did not look like the run-of-the-mills fried dough rings. These were tall! I immediately saw a green-glazed doughnut and after reading the description, I knew one would land in my belly. I ordered the orange pistachio yeast doughnut and right as I was about to pay, the woman at the register told me that I was lucky because though they rarely have the offer, at that moment, doughnuts were buy one, get one free. I almost had screamed in glee. But I gathered myself together and after selecting the almond cake one, only to find out that someone else prior to me had ordered them all and they just hadn't made their way out of the case yet. So I settled on a blueberry glazed yeast doughnut (I usually prefer yeast doughnuts, though I can enjoy a blueberry cake or red velvet cake with the best of the them).\\n\\nIf you have your doughnuts there, they get served on metal trays, which is actually pretty cool. The inside is not frilly, but it is functional and comfortable. My buddy sat down with me and I immediately dug in with all my greed and excitement. I went immediately for the pistachio one. And after placing a piece in my mouth, I was awash with disappointment. This did not live up to my expectations. The glaze was pretty good, but it was not particularly pistachio-y and the doughnut itself was on the drier side. I left the other half on the try and ripped into the blueberry one. Glaze was maybe a bit truer to its flavor but the doughnut was the same. Why, heavens, why?!\\n\\nSo yeah... I can say that I have had better doughnuts.

My friend and I both ordered the lobster roll which was recommended by EVERYONE on Yelp. We also ordered a dozen of variety oysters and the P.E.I. mussels.\\n- We waited for ten minutes and finally got our oysters first. The oysters were decent withe a couple splashes of lemon. After we finished our oysters the mussels came. The mussels were disgusting! I felt like I was chewing on paper. It was bland and nothing close to fresh. I felt like mussels have been sitting in the kitchen for days.  I asked our server if they could take it back and they agreed without any hesitation. I was excited for the lobster roll but when I finally took my first bite, I was not impressed. The lobster was warm and soggy and obviously not fresh! The lobster pieces were falling apart and not in fresh chunks like James Hook. I was really disappointed at Neptune's. There's a chance I went on an off day but for two hour wait, definitely not worth it!\\n\\nLocation/Service\\n- Place is fairly small and hyped up to the MAX so expect 1.5-2 hour wait on weekdays and on a weekend you can easily expect a 2 hour wait. \\n- Our server took care of us and even gave us some recommendations. She recommended the mussels which my friend and I both thought was distasteful. However, she took it back immediately without any questions and apologized for it. She didn't give us any dirty looks and still took care of us even though we complained about the mussels\\n\\nRecommendation\\n- This place has over 1900 reviews with a 4.5 star rating. MUST TRY?! PASS!!! People putting Neptune's on a pedestal!! If you want a legit lobster roll, hit up James Hook on Atlantic Ave. James Hook has the best lobster roll HANDS DOWN in Boston!

I opted to omit the cheese.  The biscuit itself was delicious. The rest was pretty underwhelming. The bacon was not at all crisp, but more limp and kind of soggy. I could tell it was good quality bacon and the flavor was good, but the texture was awful. The chicken also had good flavor, but the breading was on the soggy side. All of the sogginess was likely intensified by the gravy, but really seemed like the problem probably started by the food being prepared earlier and held under a heat lamp prior to assembling the sandwich. I personally would prefer a deconstructed version to hopefully eliminate the soggy issues.

At 1am the only options are G'Raj Mahal, which can be impossible to find parking near when the bar crowd is active, and Teji's. This night, I opted for Teji's.\\n\\nTeji's is more casual then a lot of Indian restaurants. You order at the counter and they bring your food out in styrofoam to go containers sans lids. I assume they do a lot of take out. I was provided with a real plate and flatware as I was dining in.\\n\\nWanting to get a feel for the place I ordered a butter chicken combo so that I could try a few items. This came with butter chicken, a vegetable curry, rice, naan, and kheer. The chicken dish was very thick, very creamy, and had an intense tomato flavor. I have to agree with another reviewers assessment that it very much resembles tomato basil soup. Personally, I wouldn't order it again. The chicken appeared to be small pieces of tandoori chicken breast.\\n\\nThe vegetable curry was the highlight of the meal. Some of the spices tasted a little raw, and it was mostly liquid, but overall I found it to be in the acceptable to good range. The rice was nothing special, just plain rice, but very much necessary for any attempt to eat the vegetable curry.\\n\\nThe naan here is insanely big. It's the size of an elephant's ear. I could see the monstrous naan being a real plus for a hungry college guy.  It's fluffy and a little crispy. Pretty good. My gf ordered a fruit and nut naan as well, but parts of hers were burned and it lacked fruit and nuts. I think it might have something like a small amount of cherry jam inside.\\n\\nI barely touched the rice pudding (kheer). It was mostly milky with very little rice and extremely sweet. \\n\\nThis meal was extremely cheap as far as Indian food goes. So while it wasn't the best, at least it didn't cost an arm and a leg. I'd like to give this 2 1/2 stars, but I rounded up to 3.

My mom was one of the seafood-lovers and was intensely dissatisfied with her salmon. It was slimy like it had been frozen and the rest of the flavors were just a mush pile and the sauce was some sort of sugary syrup that may have been a special, because I don't see it on the current menu.

Unfortunately, it was a horrible experience. \\nMy husband and I arrived 10 minutes before our reservation and were sat promptly. We were sat at an inside booth, which I was a little disappointed about, especially when you make the reservations online, there's a little box to check if it's your first time dining there. I thought with that specific question, they would seat us by the window to see the amazing view. They had 4 open tables by the window so my husband asked if we could sit at a window table...the hostess said \\"Only if you want to wait 45 minutes.\\" My husband asked why when there's 4 open tables and she just really didn't know what to say except oh because...they're already taken. This made no sense since there was no wait to be sat. \\nWe continued to sit at our booth when the waiter came to the table and said good evening can I take your drink order? Nothing other than that...we weren't drinking any alcohol this particular evening, but didn't see any other drinks besides wine and cocktails, so we asked for a few minutes. We looked over the menu and ordered a mock tail and an iced tea. As we're sitting there we hear servers around us describing the soup of the day and the special menu for the evening. Our server never did anything close to this. We ordered the crudo and, on special, steamer clams, as well as two sushi rolls. We said we'll have those to start and if you could leave a menu please for us to look over for our entrees. 15 minutes later we received the salmon crudo. The plate had, what looked like ripped apart olives all over it, which was not in the description of the dish. My husband and I both tried it and sad to say, but it had a very fishy flavor...and raw salmon should not taste like this fish tasted...it also had a weird texture. We left it on the corner of the table, dissatisfied with the dish.\\n The waiter came by and asked if we'd like the rest boxed up and we said no, we didn't like it, it was very fishy. He took the plate quickly without another word. \\n5 minutes later he comes back and says \\" Just so you know, the sushi roll you ordered is also all raw fish, and it has the same salmon in it, so if you didn't like the crudo you most likely won't like the other raw fish you ordered.\\" My husband was kind of astonished that the waiter thought we were stupid enough to not know what sushi was. We told him we'd still like what we ordered and we knew what was in the sushi roll. The manager came over shortly after to apologize for the crudo..blah blah blah...the rest of the evening was just as disastrous, with dirty dishes sat behind our heads, to 40 minutes of waiting for the sushi rolls, to empty glasses of our drinks switching waiters to have a slightly better one.

There was only 1 waitress there who doubled as hostess/waiting list guard and if she wasn't around, then good luck with finding out how much longer the wait was, etc. I can't fault them for having a long wait, but what I can fault \\nis when they did call me to come back in, they said ready in 10 minutes, but once we got there and checked in again, we waited another 30 minutes to get seated.\\n\\nFrom the time we put our name on the waiting list to when we finally got seated, it was no joke 3 hours and 55 minutes.\\n\\nOnce we got seated on the bar though, service was great.\\n\\nAll of that aside, the real reason this is a 4-star review was because there is a big window in front of the restaurant and they have all of the oysters available for the raw food bar and you can watch the oyster orders shucked by the shucker.  While watching her do a great job shucking the oysters, we saw her take lobster from a plate that was fully assembled (just waiting for her to shuck the oysters) and eat two big pieces! She then put the shucked oysters on the plate and turned it to the waitress to serve.  So basically, so other patron paid a hefty price for great seafood that they didn't even get to eat.  \\n\\nAs we were leaving after our meal, we saw the same shucker standing behind the bar talking loudly on her cell phone less than a foot away from people still eating.  That is just unprofessional!\\n\\nSo while I enjoyed the food and would recommend this restaurant, there is no way I would wait more than an hour to have the food."},{"name":"Refuge Cafe","address":"155 Brighton Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Espresso drinks aren't good.

This is one of them. \\n\\nTo start, none of the food we ordered were worthy of the 4.5* review on Yelp- \\n\\nFried clams - light, crisp batter, thin vinegary tartar sauce that helps cut down the greasiness. ($21) it's a pretty tasty appetizer and better than others we ordered \\n\\nNorth end cioppino - the broth was too light and had no body. I've had a lot better at less than half the price point elsewhere (granted without super fancy seafood, but better nonetheless).  A good cioppino is not just some expensive ingredients thrown together\\n\\nLobster roll - our roll (we ordered hot) had too much claw meat which makes it less pleasing from a texture perspective. James Hook (which we had for lunch) was much better with more, better quality lobster and $10 cheaper. Luke lobster (which we have back home in DC) is also better\\n\\nWhile all of the dishes use fresh ingredients, none were executed well enough to be worthy of paying $30 (most entrees are around $30).  None were memorable.  They all would be perfectly acceptable if the price point were at $$ (still not memorable, but I wouldn't complain) but when I'm paying $100+ for 2, the food needs to be at a more elevated level (both ingredient and preparation)\\n\\nAmbience & service -\\nNone. Ok, I normally love hole-in-the-wall type places and don't typically judge a restaurant by its ambience, but this is definitely my first $$$ restaurant where you can't even get your own table. You're either sitting at the bar (with no place to put anything, not even a small handbag) or sharing a tiny table with strangers, who are so close they probably accidentally elbow you during dinner. The wait staff are nice enough, but are so busy that they never bother to check in on us during the meal, which is atypical of the type of service at $$$ restaurants. \\n\\nOverall, I can't look back at my meal and say, \\"oh that was a good dinner\\".

After our server finally came around to take our order, it took 20-25 minutes to get our food, and it came out at separate times, several minutes apart. \\n\\nIt went quickly downhill from there. I ordered a burger and fries. The enormous pile of lettuce/spinach stacked on the burger was all brown and wilted. The bun was burned and the fries were rock hard and cold. My wife ordered several breakfast side items. The grits were cold. The toast was burned, yet cold. The sausage patties were old and hard, likely left over from the morning rush. The bacon was burned to a crisp. On top of the issues with the food, the service was poor. Our waitress used the drive-by-shooting approach to customer service, blurting out \\"Everything alright? Good.\\" as she passed several times without stopping or even giving us a chance to respond before she was gone. The service improved slightly towards the end of the meal, but overall I would still rank service as poor.\\n\\nTo top it off, the atmosphere was ruined by the acoustics of the building.

Friendly.  Cozy.  Welcoming.  This was my first time checking this great Fairbanks Ave. spot after waiting for a year or two to finally make it here.  The space was a lot smaller than I figured, but as mentioned above, it was not a bad thing.  And overall, I think Scratch has utilized its small space very well.  There are 5-6 tables seating 2-6 people at each.  And a nice L-shaped bar.  \\n\\nI want to preface this review briefly.  The 3-stars were mainly for the food.  My experience would have warranted 5-stars for sure if the customer service side of the experience was really good.  Sadly, it was not fully what I had hoped.\\n\\nWhen we walked in we were greeted by the host and told it would be a bit of a wait for seating.  We were offered seating at the bar which my guest and I proceeded to take with the promise from the host that they would seat us once a table opened up.  Oddly there was a 4-5 person table open, but unsure why it was not originally offered.  So my guest and I went to the bar where we were served by Ashley, who was a great waitress/bartender/and turns out one of the owners.  I ordered a Southern Pecan beer, which was good, and we started with the pretzel appetizer.  Ashley came back a few minutes later and said they were actually out so we put in an order for the pork belly bites.  They were delicious.  They were fried pieces of belly with micro greens on top and a lime reduction on the side for to dip.  It was quite yummy.  Then Ashley said she put in an order of 'lumpia' for us because of the lack of pretzels.  While waiting we were also brought a tomato salad that was mis-made by Ashley, which was nice of them.  It was definitely appreciated.  It was tomatoes, spinach (I believe), pickled shallots, and gouda croutons with a lemon vinaigrette.  Overall, very good.  We were then brought the lumpia, which I thought were ok, but not amazing.  It came with a chili-something glaze which was good. \\n\\n(Here's a brief description of what lumpia is: A spring roll of Chinese origin commonly found in Indonesia and the Philippines. It is a savoury snack made of thin crepe pastry skin called \\"lumpia wrapper\\" enveloping a mixture of savoury fillings, consists of chopped vegetables (carrots, cabbages, green beans, bamboo shoots and leeks) or sometimes also minced meat (chicken, shrimp, pork or beef).\\n\\nDuring this time, another couple came in and were eventually seated before we were offered the table.  My guest spoke with the host who apologized and said he had forgotten that we were interested in a table and offered to give us the 4-5 person table.  We declined, and just finished our meal at the bar.  I completely understand and was not that upset, just slightly upset that we were overlooked.  Ultimately that's why I gave the 3-stars versus the 5.\\n\\nWe then ordered the short rib entree to share.  MOUTHWATERING.  That's all you need to know.  It was accompanied by string carrots and one other vegetable.  And OF COURSE all the yummy, savory juices from the rib cooking for hours.  My only critique of this plate is the carrots tasted just a tad off, couldn't quite out my finger on it.\\n\\nAll in all, Scratch definitely warrants at least one stop.  From the generally friendly staff, the decor, and, ultimately, the food (which is a seasonal menu so it changes all the time, love that).  I will be finding a time to make a second stop, not only because of the food, but to hopefully erase and replace the slightly frustrating customer service side of our experience with a better experience that would be 5-stars."},{"name":"Tibby's New Orleans Kitchen","address":"2203 Aloma Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4.5","text":"It takes only one word to describe my experience at Tibby's...AMAZING!!!

Definitely a cool place to bring a date.\\n\\nThe food was pretty good: the lamb burger and the lobster burger were quite tasty, as were the fries, which came on the side, in a cool little basket. My beef (haha) with this place is that while the burgers are good,  I just don't want to pay between $5 and $10 for one small little tiny burger. The waitress described each mini burger as being about \\"three bites\\". Three bites for $10. Call me crazy, but I would rather head down the street to Cornwall's in Kenmore Square and have a really big juicy burger with tons of fries for $10. Three bites for $10 or a WHOLE BURGER for $10. Hmm. \\n\\nI do really like the atmosphere here, so I'd suggest going for drinks. I have to admit though, I was not super impressed with the martinis. Get a beer or something and kick back and enjoy the atmosphere. I've heard that the pizza and some of the entrees are pretty reasonably sized for the price, so I might give Match another try. If you have some cash to burn it's worth it to sample the mini burgers because they are good, maybe just have one with your drink, but go get a real big burger at Cornwall's or someplace else before you hit up Match if you want to be full and have some cash left in your wallet."},{"name":"Luke's Lobster Back Bay","address":"75 Exeter Street","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Tourist trap.

Other Indian buffets tend to put the naan out on the buffet line so you're lucky if you get any unless you watch like a hawk for when a new batch goes out. \\n\\nThe service was a little sub-par. Our waiter was forgetful and my coworker had to ask twice for his drink. The decor is a little odd, but that's because I guess it turns into a club on the weekends. Finally, I really loved the flavor of the goat curry but I was not happy with how much bone and gristle was in it.

I literally live half of a mile away from this hole-in-the-wall food truck, but I did not get up to make the journey until a few weeks ago.\\n\\nFirst, I have to mention that I love everything Manor Rd. has to offer. The food selection ranges from Tex-Mex cuisine of Chile to the modern, American gastropub of Salty Sow. The endless, enticing possibilities that are all located within blocks of one another. Furthermore, keeping to Manor's uniqueness, Patrizi's is a stand-out, no doubt about that. Usually, I'm not a huge fan of Italian food due to my frequent trips to Olive Garden  in my pre-Austin life (not saying that OG is a bad restaurant, rather, it is not my cup of tea). However, I could not help but try the Italian food offered here after my good friends recommended it to me.\\n\\nThe actual truck can not be found easily. It resides in the patio area of the Vortex.  Once you locate it though, it seems silly that you were ever lost in the first place. \\n\\nMy first time at Patrizi's was during the midst of the Ghana vs. USA  game. I did not follow the schedule that day, therefore, I did not realize the crowd at the nearby Haymaker. It was not a huge deal, on the contrary, it made the visit more exciting. When my friends and I approached the truck, we were greeted by someone who explained the entire menu to us in detail, trying to predict any questions we may have while looking at the menu. I decided to get the Cacio e Pepe because I did not want a tomato based pasta. While I made my order, I noticed the exterior of the truck. The placement of framed pieces around the truck's exterior embodied the renown art culture that one could find in Italy. My friend ordered us a side of garlic bread as well and OH.MY.GOSH! I did not know that garlic bread could taste so good! If it already did not taste amazing already!! \\n\\nWe did not wait for the food long and it was delivered to us by one of the chefs. The portion sizes did not seem too large and the dishes looked like something made straight from a fine-dining restaurant. After I ate almost the whole bowl, I was stuffed like a cannoli!\\n\\nI give Partizi's a 5 star rating because of its authenticity, service, taste, and complexity! If you are in the mood for something Italian (or anything delicious), you will be best eating at this lovely establishment."},{"name":"Tin Lizzy's Cantina","address":"77 12th St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"It's more \\"Tex\\" than it is Mex. \\n\\nThe food and drinks are edible but nothing to write home about really.

How someone running a sandwich business could be so rude to guests is beyond me How uncomfortable to be treated so rudely while just trying to get a sandwich. Sandwiches are mediocre and other dishes have been very greasy, there are just so many better options in the north end, there really is no reason to eat here.

It's about time I wrote a review for LouiE's in Upper Arlington.  I sure get there enough.  I love Mexican food and I love Cuban food, so it's no wonder I end up back and forth between their Hilliard location and their UA location.  \\n\\nIf you've read my reviews before, you know how much I like LouiE's in Hilliard.  So, how does the UA restaurant compare?\\n\\nFrom the outside, the UA location doesn't look like much.  In fact, it would be easy to pass by without noticing.  The location on Northwest Boulevard is right next to the huge Giant Eagle Marketplace that just opened, and it is rather dwarfed in comparison.  Very easy to miss.  Just don't.  Keep looking, it's there. There appears to be little to no parking.  That, however, is deceiving.  There is a full lot in the back.\\n \\nIn their interior decors, the two restaurants are very, very different.  UA is a little darker, the tables are a little bigger, the booths a little nicer.  Interesting Aztec (???-look, i'm not an art reviewer) paintings are on the walls; the owner, Efraim, told me that they were painted especially for his restaurant.  The bar area is very small, but painted just as cute as it can be.Sort of has a  \\"trompe l'oeil-mural\\" thing going on.  (I welcome anybody's correction on my art language...just be nice.)  My 18 year old son (David) commented that the UA Louie's is more like a place you can take a date.\\n\\nThe menu for UA is exactly the same as the familiar Hilliard restaurant.  Luis, the owner and also creator of the menu items, trained the staff in UA himself, and from what I've tried, he was very successful.\\n\\nBoth David and I are into their \\"Cajun Wrap\\" right now.  It has\\nCajun spiced chicken breast with rice, shredded cheese, lettuce, tomato and chipotle ranch wrapped up in a giant flour tortilla. They serve it with sweet potato fries for $ 8.99.  It is spicy, but not excruciatingly so, and I love the flavor of the chipotle ranch dressing on it.  I usually ask for rice to be omitted in wraps (whereever I go), but forgot to ask the waiter to have the cooks leave it out.  That's okay.  Turned out I liked it that way.  I've had it several times, since then...and I just have it with the rice.\\n\\nMy husband is a fan of the fish tacos.  You get 3 corn tortillas with choice of grilled or fried white fish, lettuce, tomatoes, onions, jack cheese and chipotle ranch for $ 9.99.  My husband likes his fish grilled, and gets it all the time.  \\n\\nIt's kinda funny, because in Hilliard, my husband always gets the Mofongo chicken, and here, he always gets the fish tacos.  He hasn't tried the Mofongo in UA.  I, however, made sure to try my favorite, Southwest Linguini, in both places. Both equally good.  You did a good job, Luis, making sure your new cooks know how to make it!.\\n\\nOlder son, Adam, doesn't get there as much as the rest of us.  Even though he likes the food, I guess the trip up from University of CIncinnati is a bit too far, even for good food.  He did get there with us, though, over Christmas break.  He ordered the Fusion Chicken sandwich.  It is a chicken breast seasoned with Cajun flavoring, with avocado, bacon, melted pepper jack cheese, lettuce, tomato, onions and chipltle ranch. He enjoyed it very much.  \\n\\nHe also had the Catfish Po'Boy on another visit.  That seems to be his \\"fallback\\" menu item for every restaurant he goes to.  I think that would make him an expert.  He really likes LouiE's Po'Boy and has had it several times in each location.  To me, it looks like just a fish sandwich, but I didn't try it, so I guess I shouldn't be commenting... \\n\\nFinally, the flan.  Loved the flan, Luis.  It was so creamy, sweet but not too sweet.  Just right with a cup of coffee.  About as different as you can get from my old favorite of Fried Ice Cream, but just as deserving of praise.  Martin (husband) and David (son) are devoted to the Fried Cheesecake.  I tried it and it was good, but I still like the flan better.   \\n\\nFinally, the service.  We've gotten good service at both restaurants, although if they are really busy, it does suffer...guess that is to be expected.  The weird thing is that in UA, all the servers are male and in Hilliard, they are all female.  Not sure what's up with that.  Anyway, it gives a sort of different \\"feel\\" to each of the locations.  Hilliard seems a little friendlier, more casual, while UA is a little more formal.  Of course, that could also be because I've gone to the Hilliard one longer, so I know all the servers now!\\n\\nEither way, both restaurants are good.  My son David has been playing the piano every Wednesday in Hilliard for almost a year, and now plays in UA on Tuesdays.  Please be assured that this is not why we go there (yes, I like to hear him, but we also go on other days, too!)  When the gig runs out, like I'm sure they all do, we will still be frequenters of LouiE's, just like we were before he started there."},{"name":"Kokoro Ramen","address":"5695 Victoria Drive","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"A fusion of Chinese and japanese.

I prefer my salmon a little undercooked and it was almost overcooked, but it was my mistake to not let the waiter know. The major problem was that the people in the group had the choice of picking either salmon, chicken, or steak. They brought the food out all at the same time for us all but the people who ordered chicken did not have theirs. They waited for a good 25 mins until they brought out their dishes. My co worker who was next to me got the chicken and at this point most of us were done so when she finally received it she began to eat it and in the middle it was very under cooked and the veggies around it were not cooked as well.

Sadly, I had high hopes. I ordered from the Portland Dining month special and didn't enjoy much. The starter of gnocchi was very good, but the bar service where I was sitting, was very unprofessional and absent minded. Although this is a \\"bistro\\" the constant throwing of the bussed plates was nerve wracking and not appropriate for the high price of meals there. My second course was the chicken fried trout and i had to sort through it for bones with my fingers and the over sauced, overly complicated arrangements of vegetables and heavy aioli (?) was so overwhelming for the trout that all you tasted was fried breading and sauce. It was hardly better than the coasts fish and chips offerings, even though they were going for so much more...lastly, the waiter served me the wrong dessert for the prix fix menu but said happy birthday and told me he was certain it was for me when i was surprised. My birthday had been a week before so I thought could they really know this? He then realized he had made an error but I further added, I'd love it, favoring this dessert over the other...but he grabbed it away seconds before i was going to taste it! I said, I'd really like to have the dessert you just presented to me, but then he told me if i wanted it I'd need to pay an up charge for it...the incompetence of the error combined with his removal of this from right in front of me was a first in a restaurant of this \\"caliber.\\" I've never experienced such an unprofessional character in a waiter/manager and I'm surprised that in a town of such excellent service providers, this attitude, and this outcome was the best they could provide."},{"name":"Mix'D UP Burgers","address":"313 Blvd SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Finally had the opportunity to try a burger at SweetWater 420 Fest.

It was probably the best vegetarian burger I have ever had. Granted... I don't think I've ever paid money for a veggie burger elsewhere. It still says something. The only complaint I have is the bun.

I will never set foot in the place again.    Bartenders are what make or break a bar and the ones I encountered at the Oak Long Bar were downright nasty.   \\n\\nI had been waiting in the very crowded, noisy bar for about a half an hour.   When two barstools came available, I told the women next to me, who arrived after I did, to please take the seats as my friend was late.   Just as they sat down, a harried female bartender ran up and insisted they give up the seats because the stools were reserved.   The women explained that they'd asked at the front desk and were told the barstools were first-come first-served.   The bartended huffed away and the women were allowed to stay.   At this time, I asked another bartended what the bar protocol was, and he confirmed that the seats were first-come first-served.    In the meantime I ordered my favorite drink - and Old Fashioned - and while ample, it was sickly sweet.     \\n\\nFast forward ten minutes when another barstool comes available.    I sat down, and the same female bartender insists I give up the seat because it is reserved.   I was frustrated, but gave up the seat so that two women who had ordered a cheese board could sit.    A very kind man who witnessed the whole event, stood up and said \\"Chivalry is not dead!\\" and offered me his stool.   We chatted for a few moments about how disappointed we were that the charm of the old Oak Room had been replaced by a loud, hipster bar that was indistinguishable from the dozens of other overcrowded, unpleasant drinking holes of the same ilk.  He'd come for his holiday tradition of having oysters, only to learn that they were no longer on the menu.   He and his friend left, just as mine arrived, so we were finally seated at the bar together.  \\n\\nAnother bartended approaches us and I mentioned that my drink was too sweet, and that I'd like to order another one.  He (and I am not exaggerating here) puffs his chest up like a bully and said \\"WHAT'S WRONG WITH IT?!\\"    I said that it was too sweet and I'd like to order something else.    He continues to loom over me in an angry and disrespectful way so I finally say that I'll pay for another drink but I'd like something else.    My friend now starts stammering in disbelief because of the rudeness of this man.   \\n\\nFinally, I'd had enough.    I asked for the manager and the bartended stomped across the bar and eventually a young manager approaches us.   I asked to see him outside because I did not want to make a scene and ruin the other patrons' experience.    The manager was a nice guy who apologized several times and offered me dinner on the house, but as I said before, I will never step into this establishment again.  The manager also mentioned that the bartenders were protected under the union, so his hands were tied when it came to disciplining any of them. \\n\\nThis is the first negative review I've written on Yelp and I hope it is my last.   My long anticipated evening out to celebrate the holidays with a dear friend was redeemed by our very pleasant experience at the City Bar in the Lenox Hotel.   We went there after our terrible experience at the Oak Bar and the bartenders and staff at this establishment, while not warm and friendly, were pleasant and professional."},{"name":"Pine State Biscuits","address":"2204 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"This has become a regular stop for me and I always leave pleased.

You'll find daily specials (soup, quiche) and a regular menu of sandwiches and salads. There is also a delectable assortment of pastries behind the glass window. They are clearly labeled for those with allergens or special dietary needs. \\n\\nSeating is limited. There's one large table, several small ones, and a counter along the back. I'd recommend coming by yourself or in small groups of 2 or 3. It seems to be a place where people linger and chat over coffee or set up their laptops for some studying and work. So, just beware the tables might be taken. \\n\\nAs a highlight, there are several vegan, gluten free, dairy free, and vegetarian options (including pastries)!! They also have a holiday menu, so you can order ahead and skip the meal prep. \\n\\nI had the sweet potato quiche, which was the special of the day. I was impressed by the flavors; have you ever had sweet potato in a quiche? It complemented the eggs so beautifully. My only qualm was that the crust was slightly soggy.

Just finished moving in, so we were STARVING.  The Cokes were great - and the Mason jars are a cute touch.  We started with biscuits and hush puppies.  Biscuits were decent, the gravy was waaaaay too runny, and the hush puppies left much to be desired - too much dough, and the sauce was sub-par.\\n\\nNow, for the main event.  We split one of the combo plates, going with pulled pork, mashies, and mac and cheese.  The mac and cheese tasted like something the caf in high school would have served.  The mashies tasted more like instant potatoes - with too much water.  And the pulled pork... I don't even want to talk about it.  I grew up in the South, and I'm not sure that this place would've stayed open for more than three weeks; my friend had just gotten back from Kansas City, and had eaten what he calls the best bbq ever.  \\n\\nI do want to compliment the waitstaff - someone was always ready and waiting to take our order, clear out plates, etc.  They are doing a great job there.

Been three times and their food is very delicious and consistent, but the poor customer service and cost of the plates makes me think twice about going back or recommending Chagos to friends. \\nWhy? Because:\\n\\n1) Higher prices for dinner plates and limited menus - All the sandwich options and several of the combo plates are only offered during the weekday at lunch. The sandwiches & lighter meals on the lunch menu are more moderately priced and should be offered for weekend lunches and even at dinner. Who doesn't want a Cubano or El Jibarito with yucca fries for dinner?\\n\\nTIP FOR THE OWNER/STAFF: Put your sandwiches and lighter combo plates ...like the Bistec Encebollado, Cubano, Sandwich de Pernil, El Jibarito, Arroz con Pollo, and Frecase Pollo, which are all under $10 each, on the dinner menu or at least offer the lunch menu during lunch hours on the weekends!!!!!\\n\\n2) Tightfisted with chips & salsa - unlike other reviewers, we have only had ONE very small basket of fired plantain chips & a tiny plastic cup of salsa for our table, regardless of if we had two, four, or six people in our party. In addition, forget about refills of plantain chips or the garlic salsa, our server promptly removed the empty basket from our table instead of bringing us refills. \\nTIP FOR THE OWNER/STAFF: bring enough baskets of fried plantains and garlic salsa for the size of group that you are serving. If the basket is empty at any time before the meal is served, bring a refill. Also make sure to bring enough of that terrific salsa. Pay special attention when you are taking orders from the table's guests, if the  chips & salsa is empty before you take the group's order be sure to bring an extra basket of plantains & another cup of salsa when you bring the refill for the first empty basket.\\n\\n3) Drink refills, do not expect them - on every visit, people at our table had empty glasses most of the time we were there.\\nTIP FOR THE OWNER/STAFF: your guest's drink glasses should never be empty. Keep watching the group that you are serving and offer refills BEFORE any one runs out of something to drink. \\nAgain, the quality of the food is GREAT and I really want to love this place...hope that they make some adjustments to their service though."},{"name":"U-Sushi","address":"1393 Beacon St","city":"Brookline","stars":"4","text":"Is this different ownership or mgt from when I last tried it, or is it delivered from a different kitchen?

This sandwich was loaded with skinny fried onion rings and topped with the most thinly cut and super moist steak ever. I felt like I was in a Carl's Jr. commercial with horseradish tartar sauce dripping down my chin.

The two pieces each had a nice crisp around the edges and the meat was juicy and savory. The green beans and mashed potatoes below it were also very tasty.

It took 40 minutes from the time we received our appetizers until our salads were served. My steak was somehow burnt and chewy on one end and raw on the other.

Before going here for a friends birthday dinner I saw the reviews on yelp, read their menu, and things sounded pretty good. The atmosphere was very nice and fit well. The hostess was also nice and professional. However, after that things well to crap. The bar was nearly empty when we arrived yet the THREE staffers back there had more important things to do than get our drink orders. When one finally graces us with his presence he was very curt and in the typical hipster mode of 'I'm over it' snobbery (The drinks were good and decently priced though). Once the birthday girl arrived we moved to our table which was set and ready for our group of 11. \\n\\nNow is when the Hunger Games met the Waiting Game and things got worse. I understand larger groups can be a pain for a server but we were very casual, not in a rush and had drinks already from the bar. Even still our server was much to scarce. I will admit he was nice and friendly but that's secondary to service. After nearly all of us were out of beverages he came around to get drink orders but left before we could put in appetizer orders. When he did return we stopped him and place appetizer and dinner orders since we were hungry and he wasn't checking on us much at all. Well after a much too long wait our food started to arrive, OVER THE NEXT 45 MINUTES! There is NO excuse for a tables meals to be spaced out that far. Had we wanted our meals in groups of 2s and 3s we've have arrived in groups of 2s and 3s. \\n\\nMaking things even worse the food appetizers did not come out ahead of the meal. The food itself was blah. Things were VERY salty and tiny portioned. I had the Tartar (probably the best thing that night) and it was salty. I also had the scallops, which were also salty and considering they were $15 I expected more than 2 with a few decorative drops of sauce on the plate and 5 bacon bit sized pieces of pancetta. Disappointing. Elsewhere on our table, the steak, duck, and veggies were also salty. The fries were ok but they were not Belgian style and one order was burnt. The veggies were good but didn't have even a taste of jalapeno. The server even forgot to put in one of the orders so one of our group was foodless beyond the 45 window everyone else got their food. Lastly, the runner or other server who was helping run out food was about as rude as he could be. He would tell the order in a pissed off tone and glare at the table. \\n\\nAll in all this place is crap.

Hands down, the croissant was the best part of my meal. It was slightly toasted, super fluffy and buttery. 10/10 would order the croissant again. The pancakes were okay. If you like pancakes that look real fancy and cater to a specific theme or flavor, they're decent. They're dense pancakes more than fluffy, but the presentation is really nice.

I got one of their orange cranberry scones hoping for something a little better than the deep baked wedge I got. The flavors were spot-on but a little flakiness would have made it worth noticing. I can accept the fact that it is a trailer business and not some 5-star ritzy joint but still, assembling edibles in a basket similar to a Fran's hamburger fries basket, especially when the proprietors bill it as American Breakfast, is a disappointment. \\nMore of a generous meal would've made me consider a visit to Lemba's more than a one and done proposition. As it stands all I can really give it street props for is that it is positioned in an aesthetically pleasing spot at the Burnet Road Farmers Market. If you're lucky enough to stop in for breakfast on a sunny day like I did and park yourself under a white awning park bench as I also did you can at least do some admirable people watching. As for the morning fare, I stand unimpressed.

No salt, no nothing. The waiter came around and asked how everything was. I told him about the steak but also told him I was going to continue eating it.

Drinks were average (price and taste). Food-wise, we ordered some appetizers which were quite delicious.  I enjoyed the ambiance of this place.  The night I was there, it seemed like many of the patrons had just gotten off work.  So although many people were in their suit and ties, I do believe it's a pretty casual establishment. A nice play to just hang out and mingle."},{"name":"Starbucks","address":"14600 SW Murray Scholls Dr, Ste 107","city":"Beaverton","stars":"3","text":"Im not so sure about this location.

Tiny restaurant. It's a little confusing to get your name on the list as the hostess is back and forth and there doesn't seem to be a set system in place for where to wait or how to get on the list. Basically they take your phone number and call you when your table is ready. Great selection of oysters- they have a handy card that has a brief description/guide of the different types of oysters which was helpful. We tried the Island Creek, Kumamoto, Cuttyhunk, and Kanama Bay oysters which were delicious and fresh. Island Creek and Cuttyhunk were my favorites out of these- they seemed to be more middle of the road in terms of saltiness and brininess. Kanama Bay were really salty, and Kumamoto were very briny. Great wine selection.

Our party of four had 3 glasses of wine, 6 craft beers, 3 cocktails, more than enough (very good) food, and the tab was $201.  I've spent a lot more for a lot less other places.

Everyone was extremely friendly, made great food recommendations, and really made us feel welcomed. The food was good too. We decided to do bite sized snacks rather than a meal and were not disappointed. We had the garlic knots, crab rangoon, gnocchi, and bone marrow tar tar. All delicious. Our waiter even suggested we \\"luge\\" a shot of sherry down the bone marrow once we finished it - a fun and different party trick we had to try! Tips: Bar seating is first come first serve, everything else you must put your name in at the hostess stand. On a Friday night at 6:30 pm we waited about 30 min for inside seating (wait grew to about an hour by 7pm) - just enough time to get a drink at the bar. If you have a big party (4 or more) I suggest getting there early to snag a corner spot in the \\"living room\\" - otherwise seating is hard to come by for larger parties. Also keep in mind they do not take rezzies. Lastly, it was very cold when we went so we did not sit outside, but we did check out the patio and it looks awesome!

The joint had a dope sign that read that the lobster was 'Straight Outta Portland\\" - I liked the attitude already.\\n\\nInside, the joint doesn't look that big and has the feel of a chain (which it is) though, the food is fantastic so don't let this minor fact deter you.  It's a chain, yes, but a very high quality one that seems to near-locally source the catch - you'd swear this was a little stand by the ocean, that's how good it is.  All I got was a Lobster Roll, which was a bit pricey and very small at $17.  Thus, I'd give the caveat that if you're very hungry, maybe go some place else but if you're craving a Lobster Roll at 9pm, it's awesome.  The roll itself was crazy good, with a very forward-tasting lemon sauce that was very unique.  \\n\\nAgain, the size was very small and the price was a bit high, not for a Lobster Roll, but for one that small - however, it was fantastic."},{"name":"Patrizi's","address":"2307 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Really fun unique location.

I come to Portland regularly on business but have never eaten here.  Most likely because places like this are more about the view, and less about the food.  After several \\"local\\" recommendations, I decided to go all in.  However, I never got a chance to try the food.  I arrived at 6 PM and found a seat at the Bar.  The views are fantastic!  The bartender, Gabriel, was very friendly and welcomed me to town.  I was enjoying a few cocktails and doing some people watching.  I ordered the Rib-Eye Steak with the Garlic Fries and B√©arnaise. It was about 7:45 PM and I was really looking forward to it!  Then 8:15 came and no food, then 8:30 came and no food, then 8:45 came and no food.  It was Thursday evening, there was no wait, with several open tables and seats in the bar and also the dining room.  I asked Gabriel to cash me out, then as I was signing the credit card slip the food finally shows up.  Too late now...........then a manager comes over and asks if there is anything he could do.  I said no, but I was thinking where was the concern while I was waiting over an hour for my food.  Of course they were able to provide enough time for me to order another couple of drinks.

I am a Publick House devotee, so one warm summer night a three of us decided to give this place a try. Yes, the beer selection is amazing, but everything else is mediocre or worse. We stood at the host stand for 5 minutes until someone greeted us. We sat outside and the waiter asked to see our IDs, even though we had beers in hand which we ordered inside during the wait for a table. The food was ok but overpriced. My friend was delivered the incorrect order and had to wait about 15 minutes for the correct sandwich, and my caesar salad was simply lettuce with a watery dressing. Yes, caesar salad is mostly lettuce anyways, but compared to the one at the Publick House, which I often order and thoroughly enjoy,this one sucked. After dinner we moved to the back bar, after waiting for what seemed an eternity for our dirty plates to be cleared. The interior is large but was mostly empty on a Saturday night at 9pm. Also, super weird is the placement of electrical outlets every few feet at the top of the walls. I was pleasantly surprised to see that they had a menu of craft cocktails. I was beered out and thought I would end the night with a Sazerac, which was on the menu. My friend returned, after waiting 15 minutes at the barely crowded bar, with what looked like a glass of straight booze. Indeed, one burning sip later and I knew I didn't have the correct drink. I went back to the bar and nicely explained I had ordered a Sazerac. \\"Yeah, that's what you got\\" the bartender said. \\"This is not the drink on the menu. This is straight whiskey,\\" I said. \\"Yes, that is what you ordered, Sazerac Cognac\\" she said, holding up a bottle that bore that brand name. \\"No, I wanted the cocktail listed on your drink menu, a Sazerac.\\" She proceeded to make me the worst version of the cocktail I have ever had. I can understand the confusion, but she clearly didn't know the menu nor how to make the drink, and she was defiant about it. Long story short, if I am ever forced to go back to this place, I will stick to beers and nothing more.

Fancy pants doughnuts at fancy pants prices. Nothing mind blowing, but they're beautifully presented in that \\"were obviously artisans\\" kinda way. If this place made a video to promote themselves, it would definitely be hosted on vimeo, if you feel me... These are hipster doughnuts that focus more on unique flavors and organic ingredients than pushing a super pro bacon agenda on you. Which is a good thing. They have vegan doughnuts, and I think that's one of their big pulls. They're terrible, but I'm sure they're amazing to a vegan. Bottom line: they have a limited variety, and the stuff they have isn't all that great. Their fritter is meh. Their glazed is meh. The one exception is their coconut frosted doughnut. Get that. Get two of them. That doughnut alone is the reason I've been back a few times. I'll be back for it again, too. Or if you're a vegan. Go here and be happy as hell for awhile.

I had a woman get RIGHT in my way when I was backing out of a space so I couldn't even turn my car and leave. I had to go back into the damn spot! I can only hope karma's as much of a bitch as her. Needless to say shit like that in a tight lot does not keep me going back somewhere. Not their fault, just saying if you have low tolerance for dealing with gigantic assholes when you feel like you drove from California to get here, it's kind of meh.\\n\\nAnyway, this place looks really, really corporate chain-like inside. I'm still not sure if that's good or bad. It's nice that it looks all polished but at the same time it feels kind of sterile. I think it's the chairs.\\n\\nI had decided before I got there that I wanted a platter, since it seemed way worth the money compared to the wraps/sandwiches. Also I wanted the German, which doesn't really sound to me like a good sandwich. The French does though so one day I will most definitely be back for that one. It was a hard decision to go with the German, but with schnitzel being a definite German food, I had to.\\n\\nI got fries and the cucumber salad with it. It is now $8.49 for the platter, the website still says $7.99. Still, it's a lot of food, I didn't even finish the sides and I had skipped breakfast in anticipation of this.\\n\\nThe schnitzel was good though, when I was in Germany one of our little set up lunches was a place that gave us pork schnitzel and it was so gross and dry and I hate pork anyway so I was more excited for this. Definitely no dry chicken here, it has a good crust that stays on. The German comes topped with sauerkraut and caramelized onions, plus a dill caper cream sauce on the side (which was also good for dipping fries). I ended up just putting the sauce right on there to mix w/the kraut and onions.\\n\\nIf you get the German you should so get the cucumber salad, because they match really well together. It's got a tang of vinegar to it, a lot more so than the kraut, but the sauce I think cut the acidity of that. There's onions in there too and some herb. It was great. The fries were just fries.\\n\\nThe only real downfall of this place is those damn chairs and stools. Those are not chairs and stools, those are torture devices. I sat on a stool for about half a second before I moved myself to a booth.

Absolutely aweful. It's a great idea to have this place on site, and the LC promotes that fact too when trying to woo you to live here. Poolside, has a bar there too--nice little outdoor sitting area. Seems great. Except service is awful! When we first moved here in April and waited forever for service (and to look at one of the two menus they had--no joke) we chalked it up to still being spring. I can understand not wanting to hire people and not need them. It's summertime now. That place and the pool are packed, especially on the weekends. We go this past weekend, grab a seat outside, and wait. And wait. Maybe half the tables were full, so we gave them the benefit of the doubt, and waited some more. After ten minutes we asked the bar tender if there was someone serving outside. Got a super rude short response telling me and my wife that there is, and we just have to look for them. Wow! Ok. So we left. That was a Saturday night. Not super busy but busy enough I guess. Or maybe it was Sunday. Anyhow, outside of that guy being a jerk my main concern is why they don't have more people serving?! Two people? This place is huge, there are tons of people here. You have two people on staff for a weekend evening! That's garbage! I've been trying to call and complain to these people but haven't gotten ahold of anyone yet. Someone was suppose to call me back--haven't heard back. Not surprising considering the lack of service you get while attempting to actually spend money there. Anyhow, I doubt I'll be back. It's cool having this place on premises where I live but to go and wait forever and still get no service, the not exactly a peek to me. They need to get it together. I don't know what the LC can do, but they should put some pressure on too because that kind of crap service on their property is a direct reflection of them--no two ways about it. \\n\\nDecided to update this since a supervisor did call me back, apologized, and admitted they are under staff and looking to hire.

The beer from the tap was ice cold, and it doesn't make the beer taste better but they took the time to pour the kind of beer I ordered into that companies mug. That's a little detail but it made things less confusing when you put your glass down. I don't know if it was done on purpose or not, but they get points for it. \\n\\nNow to the food. I personally didn't order anything. However my friends got a few items off the menu. The sliders were average, and the fries had no taste. One of the girls at the table ordered a cheese pizza. BIG MISTAKE. It was one of the worst pizza's I've ever had. That is saying something because i LOVE pizza. They were going for a rustic type of pie. It was shaped like a football you let the air out of. The first bite wasn't bad but then a strange aftertaste hits your tongue. I don't know if they used lemon grass in it or what... but there was some funky citrus flavor left behind. \\n\\nThe waitress was a nice girl, very friendly but she was a little bit slow.

I ordered an enchilada plate that came with two enchiladas, I requested that one be cheese and one be chicken. She then rushed me through a drink order and gave me a total. The person with me had not ordered yet. After that ordered was placed she forgot to give us drink cups because she ran off. I was thinking to myself that the total seemed high but hadn't really looked at the prices.\\n\\nThe tables, floor, counters, salsa bar all were filthy.\\n\\nWhen we got our food I immediately understood why the bill was so high - she had charged me for TWO enchilada dinners. I said this is not what I wanted I was charged for 2 dinners. the people behind the counter just stared at me with no offer to remedy the situation.\\n\\nWhen I got back to my table I also noticed that although the dinners each came with rice one had half as much as the other. In addition to our now three meals we had ordered a side of chips. When we got our food all three dinners came with chips. I would have appreciated a heads up from the gal taking our order because at this point we definitely did not need additional chips.\\n\\nThe food: I did not try the cheese enchiladas but the chicken enchiladas had cold chicken. The sauce looked old and wasn't warm either. The rice and beans were ok - kinda bland. The bean and cheese burrito was decent. the chips were not warm and they are very thick and hard, not the light crunch I like - but I know that is a highly variable item.\\n\\nOverall there is no way that I would go back to this place.

It's not perfect, and I reserve my 5 star ratings for those spectacular meals that come along once a in a while, but this is probably more of a 4.5 star rating.  Worked an overnight shift last night, and came home and slept the afternoon and a good part of the evening away, and woke up a little hungry, a little bored, but too tired for an actual sit-down restaurant meal, so ended up going to Seven Hens to try it.\\n\\nThe setting: probably similar to some of the newer burger places like Farm burger or Yeah! Burger, but located in an older strip mall in Decatur.  Nice and clean, well-proportioned space with a decent number of tables.  Not horribly busy at 8 pm, but there were a few people around ordering and eating.\\n\\nService: Amazing.  Staff is knowledgeable, welcoming, and friendly, and seem to care about your experience at the place.  I ordered sweet potato fries, and was told that my serving was a little smaller than what it was supposed to be, and that they would bring out the rest of it once they fried it.  I've never had a restaurant before tell me that my portion was too small and they were working on fixing it.  Even though it's a fast food place, the owner asked us for our opinion before we left.\\n\\nThe food: Excellent.  Not perfect, but came decently close.  Everything is freshly prepared.  I hate cold fries, and these are fried to order.  \\n- Sweet potato fries: These are apparently a seasonal item.  They look like they're hand sliced, seasoned with sea salt flakes.  Somewhat crunchy on the outside, creamy on the inside.  Not astounding, but certainly solid.  Very good with the secret dipping sauce.  Only drawback: slightly too salty.\\n- Yukon gold fries: I stole these from my friend without shame.  One of the best fries ever in Atlanta.  Perfect crunchy exterior, creamy potato on the inside.  Perfect seasoning.  If only I could get a little bit of the sauces or dressings used on the sandwich, it would be the perfect fancy dipping sauce.  At $2.25 a serving or $2.50 extra for the combo, definitely worth it.  Must try.  Go get some. \\n- Mexican baguette: the bread is fresh with a great texture.  Apparently all of them come with sesame seeds?  Schnitzel is freshly fried with a nice spicy breadcrumb layer.  Maybe a little too much sauce, but it was certainly good sauce.    Great combination of textures (chewy bread, crunchy schnitzel, fresh veggies) and the flavors went well together.  I left with a happy belly.  \\n-Overall: Great value for about 10 bucks.  I could get cheaper meals somewhere else, but not yummier, and probably not healthier.  Certainly worth it.

If anything, Redbones should have received 100 bad ratings that night.  I can't even begin to think that this place is popular.  \\n\\nThe thing about a bbq place is that consistency is key.  The meat gets cooked the same way everyday because they're supposed to have a winning combination.  We ordered the bbq belt I believe.  Ribs and brisket. Brisket was not soft but overwhelmingly bland and the bbq sauce provided couldn't do a damn thing to fix that.  Maybe they should invest in a new sauce.  No actually, the sauce is probably fine on its own but nothing could save that meat.  I feel bad for the animals that died so Redbones could turn it into bad bbq. I thought maybe the ribs could save my experience - I was pretty optimistic at the beginning.  How were the ribs? The same thing.  I don't think you can call RED a flavor and get away with it.  \\n\\nOn another note, the doorman was a gentleman and very friendly.  The host, aka the guy who tells you how much time is left in your wait - he really needs to learn numbers because telling everyone \\"you're almost up,\\" \\"pretty soon now,\\" and \\"not much longer\\" are not references to anything but your uselessness.

The potatoes were outstanding. i thought these were more tasty tan the truffle fries. personally i don't like potatoe wedges but i like these a lot! i think it's because they were fried in duck fat and they were so crispy.

I made sure to leave a tip the next time I was there. I did get a bit annoyed when I was in there today, though.

It's in a shopping center across from Publix - there are other good restaurants in the area like Community BBQ and Bojanic.\\n\\nI've mentioned this previously, but we've been going to Athen's Pizza off and on for 20 years or so - we love the consistency of the pizza and have a special fondness for both the Vegetarian and Santorini pies. Most recently we split a small Greek salad and went for 1/2 Athens Special and 1/2 Santorini. The Santorini has very strong flavors (a bit salty so keep that in mind) so mixing in the veggie moderates the overall experience. We also like to do half-Veggie special and half-Santorini. If you're in a group it's actually a bit cheaper to get separate pies rather than splits as recently they've changed their pricing (splits start with a cheese the up charge for the two halves. They used to just charge for the more expensive pie - the change in pricing adds a couple of bucks).\\n\\nOver the years their salads have improved over the prior iceberg lettuce offering - they now mix in some Romain. The salad flavors are typical of Greek pizza joints - very classic oil and vinegar with feta, red onion, ripe tomatoes and Greek olives. This is one of those foods if done right bring back the serendipity of first having such as a kid. Athens certainly brings back the nostalgia. Athens has also replied to changes in what people like in beer, offering Sweetwater 420 on draft which I don't mind at all.\\n\\nIf you have room, Athens also offers slices of those gigantic cakes you see in Greek diners - there are also occasionally specialty desserts like chocolate rats (you have to see these to understand) and their baklava is well made, with real honey instead of that sickly sweet corn-syrup stuff you find elsewhere.\\n\\nThe last time I reviewed, I would have given them 4 stars - call this a 3.5. I'm happy to say that the last two times we went to Athens, the experience was much better, as they seem to have their act more together. The new pricing for the half-half pies is a bit disturbing but I can live with the extra bucks.\\n\\n(longer review on my food blog)"},{"name":"Porto","address":"Ring Rd","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Fantastic restaurant!

It's the blue building next to the trash cans that says \\"Yatai\\" in yellow. Don't go through Hole in the Wall to save yourself a minute or two. \\n\\nThe menu is comprised of Japanese street food and even a mini cup of Michi Ramen if that's what you're in the mood for. This is my kind of food--variety of midnight salty snacks and appetizers. And in concept, a really cool place to eat and chill with friends considering that it's open until midnight. \\n\\nBut the food was kind of meh and didn't leave a very lasting impression. We ordered the okonomi fries, fried mushrooms, shiso chicken kebab, and regular potato korokke.\\n\\nThe okonomi fries were $7, and not worth $7. The fries itself were crispy, and the taste decent, but it felt like I was eating frozen fries with mayo, sauce, and fish flakes. For $7? There's not even any meat on it, and the portion itself isn't bigger than medium fries at Mickey D's. I've had okonomi fries before, and the last I've had them elsewhere, they were $6 for a far bigger portion. The proportion of price to quality to quantity just didn't seem right.\\n\\nThe price of 3 tapas for $8 is great--about less than $3 a piece. The batter for the fried foods left everything crispy to the tee. The fried shiitake caps were good but the sauce that came with it tasted like... nothing. So I had to dip it in the sauce that came with my korokke. The potato korokke was literally fried mashed potato. I think I should have gotten another choice. And then my shiso chicken tasted like teriyaki chicken on a stick. \\n\\nPretty much, the food tasted very average and as literal as stated on the menu. I think I just expected a lot more, and was left disappointed. Also, why doesn't this place serve takoyaki? Because that's something I would really want to see on a Japanese street food menu. \\n\\nAnyway, the place is a cool concept, but there's just something that's not there yet.

I don't recall ever having a bad meal.  Whenever we come, we make sure to come at the beginning of lunch or dinner so that there's no wait, and we don't have unreasonable expectations of the waitstaff, who are always ridiculously busy.  A few tricks we've learned over the years:\\n\\n- Get the house margarita (the one that has a two order limit).  It comes in a full-sized shaker with a strainer and martini glass.  It's a great value, and it's easily 2-3 servings of margarita.  They'll bring you two martini glasses, if you want to share (doubly good value), and it always tides me over the entire meal, so I don't have to keep flagging down a waiter.\\n\\n- I never order the dinner combos anymore, because I don't like the sides they come with, and there's no choice in the matter.  Nowadays, I come for the ribs, so I order just the ribs - off the bulk menu, which you're welcome to do even if it's dine-in.  The St. Louis, baby back, and Texas beef ribs are all really good.\\n\\n- Then, I order a bunch of sides - not off the bulk menu.  I LOVE their collard greens, potato salad, and dirty rice (skip if you're not a fan of liver).\\n\\nLong story short, I've moved four times since first discovering Redbones, and now I live 45 minutes, one-way, by T from this place, and I still enjoy making the trip.  I've also trekked farther south for ribs, and while I have to say that these ribs aren't the best compared to Texas or North Carolina, they're definitely my favorite in Boston (compared to Blue Ribbon, Sweet Cheeks, Soul Fire, Village Smokehouse, and other even less memorable places I've tried)."},{"name":"Redbones BBQ","address":"55 Chester St","city":"Somerville","stars":"3.5","text":"With almost 250 reviews, not sure how much I can add, but nothing gets my motor runnin' like some spicy jerk beef and a plateful of fried okra.

Problems: ordered roasted vegetable MAC AND CHEESE but got a sandwich.  Friend asked for tomatoes on his grilled cheese and didn't get any.  Breakfast: hash browns had pieces of sausage in them, which is super disgusting as I'm a vegetarian.  Strawberry-banana smoothie was too thick to drink through a straw until it had thawed.

Dinner service wasn't slow, but breakfast service was.\\n\\nI know Refuge Cafe *isn't* Allston Cafe, but obviously being in the same location and serving similar food is going to put a lot of pressure on Refuge to live up to Allston Cafe's total awesomeness.  Allston Cafe stocked a lot of vegan options (tofutti, tofettes, baked goods, egg substitutes).  Refuge is seriously lacking in that department.  Allston Cafe wasn't dirty, but it wasn't gentrified either.  The music was whatever random stuff employees liked, usually with lots of profanity.  The food was good, in generous portions, and the weekend morning battle for tables was well worth it.  The people working in Allston Cafe kind-of seemed to actually give a shit, and I haven't seen that yet from Refuge employees.  I'm glad that Starbucks didn't get the location, but Refuge still needs to step it up.

It's a bit on the darker roast side but I like that style.  At the time of this review I ordered the Allston Sunrise and the Breakfast burrito (there were two of us, btw I am not that much of a glutton)!  \\n\\nThe Allston Sunrise lacked flavor; which is odd when it was jammed with so many ingredients.  You get the flavor of avocado but while bacon exists you can't really taste it.  Not sure how to fix this one but the balance of flavors wasn't working.\\n\\nThe Breakfast Burrito is huge!  If you try to eat this and are still hungry you may want to see a doctor as perhaps you have a tape worm.  \\n\\nSo here's the problem that I had with the Breakfast Burrito - I had to wrestle it then rush to eat it before it became super soggy (a battle I lost btw) and ultimately 60% of the way through I had to deconstruct it.  There is simply no way to eat this without it becoming a massive messy battle of you against the burrito.\\n\\nThe art form of burritos is a difficult one.  It is supposed to be food on the go not a competition to fit 70k calories into a soggy roll.  So picking the right ingredients that keeps the burrito tight, moist but not soggy, and flavorful is key.\\n\\nI must say that the ingredients were good!  In fact have it on a plate and I am sure it would have 4stars but roll it up in a burrito and it lost its appeal.  It's like taking a fine steak and passing it though a blender before serving - you lose the appeal.\\n\\nRefuge Cafe - get it together.  Go back to the roots of when you first opened.  \\n\\nYou have great coffee, great food- please re-tighten the food presentation and get the personality issues straightened out.

It's a fairly small restaurant with probably only 12 tables and an unassuming face. The atmosphere was decent but nothing to brag about.\\n\\nThe food was EXCELLENT. A typical noodle or wok dish (like drunken noodles or thai basil) is only $9.50 for chicken/tofu and both had excellent flavor profiles with fresh veggies and the perfect level of spicyness. Be aware that their spice does run a little hotter than most places. The food deserves 5-stars.\\n\\nService was very slow and unresponsive though. The wait for food was above average - which I can deal with given the quality of the food. But we were never checked up on, waters were never refilled (remember what I said about those spice levels!), and the check took 15 minutes to drop after our plates were polished clean and pushed to the middle of the table. There were only 5-6 tables for 2 servers while we were there. Such slow service is pretty unacceptable given the small size of the place. \\n\\nThat said, we loved it and may venture out from the city again.

One, who looked to be about 5, had a full plate of food in front of her but she was having more fun sucking every last drop of juice out of a sour lemon wedge. Sucking on the lemon wedge kind of added to her cuteness, and best of all, it kept her quiet. That is, until she started to cry, uncontrollably at the top of her lungs. I don't know how her father figured it out from her incoherent sobs but...apparently she had a wee scrape on her knee and lemon juice had dripped into it. Ouch! Ouch to her knee and Ouch to my ears.

I met Bondir's chef at Pete and Jen's Backyard Birds (peteandjensbackyardbirds.com).  Jason was volunteering and scoping out his food sources.  With so much obvious care and attention to his choice of vendors, I knew I would want to visit his restaurant when it opened.  \\n\\nI really respect the thought Jason puts into deciding where to get his meats, poultry, and produce, and I am ecstatic that he is able to turn out amazing creative dishes as well.  Topped off with a really reasonably priced menu (see perk #2 below), Bondir has unexpectedly shot up to being my favorite restaurant in the Boston area and is my new go-to when I want a fine dining experience.  \\n\\nSome extra perks I found upon dining at Bondir: \\n\\n1) You have the option of ordering a half portion of any of the entrees, which is a HUGE plus for me because I have a hard time picking just one dish, especially from the enticing line up of menu options offered at Bondir.\\n\\n2) The pricing is completely reasonable; a very good value for what you get.  I was definitely prepared to spend a bit more for responsibly-sourced foods, but we got entree, dessert, and wine for $50/head. \\n\\n3) I fell in love with the place, the food, the people.  Even the bathroom was creatively and uniquely perfect.  I live just a block from the restaurant and immediately felt tied into a sense of community.

Salad bar would have been good if the cold dishes were actually cold & the hot dishes actually hot. Not to mention half of the salad bar was empty because no one refilled it & whatever was available looked hours old. Normally in these types of steakhouses fresh rice, black beans, & fried plantain is put on your table.....well half way through eating our dinner is when they decided to bring this out to us & we had asked about it but just never got it until way later. By the way it wasn't black beans it was pinto beans that they gave us.  If you are a Brazilian restaurant why are you serving pinto beans, just wrong.  When The meat was way to salty. Brazilian steak is known for being so flavorful but this meat was way way way too salty & had no other flavors.  By the way there was no chimichurri sauce no where in this place at all!!!

Our daughter and her son were waiting at our home just up the street not knowing we were going to go out for the Best Mexican  food in Boulder. Which I know for a fact, being a regular and knowing the owner. We have been going here since they opened and then for many years before as Senor Miguel's. Miguel's was owned by another family member. We frequent all 3 Efrains and so do many family and friends. \\n\\nI park and go in and have a very disturbing encounter with the Hostess, a very young woman. I sat my iPad, where I had a book I'd been reading to continue doing while waiting. and purse and took off my coat, VERY ready for a GREAT margarita, chips, salsa, guacamole and who knows what other damage I might do while extremely hungry waiting for my husband. I am starving and I know he is also. So I tell the Hostess that there will be 2 of us. For the moment it would be me and I was going to have a drink and some appetizer or 2 while waiting for him. There were many open tables so it shouldn't have been a problem.....right ??? Wrong !! This young woman told me, now get this as I've never been told this at ANY restaurant in Boulder nor anywhere else I've ever lived UNLESS it was waiting for a large party of people.....that I could inform her as to when my husband arrived and SHE WOULD SEAT US AT THAT TIME. I said, \\"Well, I would like to be seated now please \\". She then informed me that she was NOT ALLOWED TO SEAT INCOMPLETE PARTIES UNTIL ALL THE PEOPLE WERE THERE. For 2 older people. That are REGULARS, or were, anyway. And be sure that I will inform all the others I know that also frequent these establishments.

They don't let you request specific table locations (e.g. by the window) over the phone, so we decided to get there early (around 8:40) to see if we could request one.  The bad news is that they said the wait for a window table would be 1-1/2 to 2 hours -- a long time to wait considering it was already close to 9pm.  The good news is that, when we declined to wait, they were able to seat us right away, in advance of our reservation, and only one table away from the window.  So we did get a fine view after all.

I've been here many times before and generally the staff is pleasant. I left my umbrella behind one evening and I called back the same nigh. They located the umbrella and advised that they placed it aside for me. The next day I was unable to pick it up but wanted to let the staff know, I will be coming and they reassured me my umbrella was there and I can come by and pick it up anytime. I drove downtown to pick up on the 3rd day and my umbrella was not there. Although the person helping me was extremely courteous I am disgruntled and annoyed that although I called twice and both times was reassured that they have it and have placed it aside it was not there when I arrived to retrieve it. The suggestion was that another guest may have taken it. I would warn anyone who leaves things in their coat check, umbrella storage to be weary that you maybe never see that item again. My umbrella was a limited edition, quality umbrella that wasn't cheap. Would have been nice to be able to trust in the staff. One star deduction for the initial call, another for the 2nd call and a 3rd for actually losing my umbrella."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"The choice of oysters is amazing.

This is a above average-sized shopping center with several food options including: Bawarchi Biryani Pointe, Ippolito's Italian, Mirage Persian, and the Publix anchor store. Parking is particularly busy at all hours so you may have to walk a bit from your parking space. Exit from the lot can be a bit difficult depending on your direction of travel so be careful, especially when pulling into traffic.\\n\\nSeven Hens is fast-casual restaurant specializing in schnitzel - your basic pounded-flat chicken breast that is breaded and fried to perfection. At Seven Hens you can select from seven menu options to flavor the chicken in various ways - from ethnic, worldly cuisines to your basic Southern-fried chicken, served with sides, atop a salad or in a sandwich or wrap. The options are on the wall on boards or you can read from a short menu. Ordering is at the counter with these choices: American, Chinese, French, German, Indian, Italian, Mexican plus a seasonal style that rotates several times a year.\\n\\nBoth times I've eaten at Seven Hens I've had the curry with cucumber salad and sweet potato fries - this is quite the meal and very satisfying. There's a variety of seasonings available at the drink station where you can intensify the flavors or if you're not sure about what's prepared by the cooks, you can get the American and add various flavors to figure out what you like best. Personally I'd like to have a very hot/spicy version of the chicken, something like the Mexican only more Szechuan-style. Even the Indian to me could use a hint of ghost pepper to be over-the-top, but you guys know how I like the spice.\\n\\nI've had occasion to meet one of the owners and I like his ideas behind the Seven Hens concept.

Happy Hour is a great time to sample several items you might be curious about. On this visit we split the burger and frites, which were both big enough for two. Don't skip the fries because you think they're something you can have anywhere, they are the best fries I've ever eaten and I always need two helpings of aoli. I also highly recommend the bone marrow. Again, it's big enough to share and so lovely and rich and delicious. Next time I will ask them to hold the tapenade however, I think it was supposed to cut the richness of the dish but it tasted a little jarring and tin-y. This spot is conventional located downtown, directly down the road from the hospital, but the parking is difficult and confusing.

I said the bar and the wonderful host (not the one that looked at the door) walked me to the bar and indicated there was another bar outside. I chose the outside bar where I was greeted by a great bartender. Brandon made me two great Lemon Drop martinis and he and the other gentlemen offered nice conversation. My companion arrived and we were promptly seated. Matt was our waiter and very pleasant and knowledgeable about oysters. We both had oysters for the appetizer and even ordered another dozen. I ordered the Shrimp New Orleans with the spinach and parmesan crawfish grits. It was seasoned well and the shrimp were cooked perfectly. My companion had the lobster with garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus. The lobster was very tender. The chef obviously knows how to prepare lobster. We ended our meal with key lime pie and the ooey gooey. The key lime pie was great. The ooey gooey did not look like the picture online. It looked and had the consistency of a bread pudding.

He then suggested he'd ask the bartender and when he came back he said another waiter with more wine knowledge would be helping us. New waiter showed up 5 min later. Again, clearly no real wine knowledge. Whatever, we ordered. Calamari was OK but not much flavor.  Cesar salad was worst ever. Tasted like romaine with an Italian dressing so tart I couldn't eat it all. That never happens!  We ordered the Strip and a cajun pasta dish. Food was delivered by a runner who dumped dishes on the table and left. No eye contact, hi, need anything else, nothing.  Our waiter never came to check on us to make sure everything was ok. I had to flag someone down to ask for parmigiano which I assumed would be hand grated. Nope! I think it was canned delivered in a small dish. Husband said steak was tender but zero flavor. My dish was good.  Waiter came once to check but didn't bother to refill our wine glasses. Seriously,  I've had better service at a beer and wing place.

The retired pastry chef expects quite a few additional food carts to move in within the next few weeks. Surveying our options- cookies, brownies, turn-overs, etc.- there was nothing fancy but definitely substantial, good old-fashioned treats. I'll say I've seen a lot of cinnamon rolls in my day, and these ones are on the large end of the spectrum. Fresh baked within the hour, the roll was fluffy and could have stood on its own.

To me it seems like the owner listened to previous less-than-positive reviews and really made some significant improvements!  I have literally come here once a week for the last 6 months , and it's only sheer willpower that keeps me from going more often. The brownies are moist, fudgy, and topped with an incredible ganache that makes my mouth water just thinking about it. The creme brulee is the BEST I've ever tasted and the chocolate-dipped Scottish shortbread is buttery and flaky with just the right amount of chocolatey sweetness.The menu provides options for every taste and everything on it is delicious perfection!\\n\\nThe other awesome thing about this cart is the owner.

The first year we stayed there we watched this place being built when we would walk to the bus stop. Year 2 we saw it open and filled with people who would be there early to watch soccer on the many tvs but never stopped in. So by Year 3 my friend and I figured it was about time we stopped in to eat especially since the place was literally 50 feet away from where we were staying.\\n\\nIt was pretty empty but I guess that was expected at 3pm on a Monday haha.  We sat ourselves and were quickly given menus.  Our server was super nice I think he was one of the owners but I could be wrong.  Anyhow we settled on ordering some queso and chips to start, and as entrees we both got the pulled pork tacos.  Since my friend doesn't like avocado she asked for her tacos to be without it.  Our server asked me if I liked avocado I told him I LOVED them so he gave me what would have been my friend's avocado on the side so I got double the avocado YUM!\\n\\nThe queso was pretty good but the salsa that also came with it was super watered down and literally tasted like just that -- water.  Our tacos were pretty awesome though.  Plenty of food -- beans, rice and two hearty tacos packed with pork, lettuce cheese etc.  In fact it was so big I had to resort to eating the insides with my fork until the amount was small enough so i could fold it up.  It was pretty tasty minus the rice which was a little bland.  But I just threw it into my taco with the beans and whatever else was already in there.\\n\\nOur bill came out to just under $10 per person -- since we were there during happy hour our queso was 1/2 price.  My cousin is graduating this year so we won't get to stay at her apartment any more so we're kinda bummed that we waited so long to eat here cause it was convenient, inexpensive and really good."},{"name":"Tasty n Alder","address":"580 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I don't need to return.

So, I popped in to try it. 2 things: I am not a fan of mysterious sauces which almost always turn out to be some play on ranch, mayo or thousand island dressing. The first time I ordered the burger with no onion and no special sauce, guess what happened once I got home...what seemed like extra onion slathered in special sauce. My fault...I should have checked the bag before pulling off. \\n\\nNow, the second visit is what really got me. My mom was in town and wanted a burger. I was planning to take her to a local dive that had great burgers cooked to order, but I pulled up and they were closed. She suggested we just go to the BK and call it a night. Placed her order, and once again, I ordered the Sourdough King (because I was determined to make this burger decent...lol). Again, no onions, no sauce. Mom checked the sandwiches and ok'd it. I got home not only was there special sauce on the burger, but they didn't even bother to toast the bun. I don't blame mom bc it was pretty dark and she couldn't see the sauce, but my goodness.

The grilled cheese is extraordinary, albeit rich, and I'm a big fan of the chutney that accompanies it.  The hummus is tasty, and the coconut chicken fingers aren't bad either.  I haven't had the crab cakes for awhile but if I recall, they were good as well.   I immensely dislike the crispy artichoke hearts.  I don't think semolina serves as a good breading -- it has a weird texture and is very bland.  \\n\\nThe entrees are underwhelming.  I have had the Derby Salad and the Trout Salad, both which are close to $12, and both which are not worth $12.  The problem is -- they're boring salads!  You could get these salads anywhere for three to five dollars cheaper.  And... they put a scant piece of meat on both of them.   I have also had the Cafeteria Meatloaf which I think was decent but not memorable, the Patty Melt which was good but again, not worth $12, and the Garden Vegetable Bowl (okay, I'm chuckling now because it too is close to $12.

By the way, one screen is, inexplicably blocked by a light. The manager said he wouldn't open the other half because they didn't have the staff, citing that they were overwhelmed by the U.S. game a couple of weeks before. Did they consider hiring a couple more people? The place was jammed and uncomfortable, we were a party of ten who did not order food because we were forced to stand. The neighborhood wants this place to succeed, especially since Publick House is so perenially crowded.

Whether I've been squeezed into the manic lunchtime crowd, or been the only person in the place, I've felt very rushed placing my order. All Qdoba's advertising implies that like most burrito places, you have the option of 'building your own' meal by walking through the ingredients with the person behind the counter. More than once I've been denied this opportunity - I say \\"quesadilla\\" and a chicken quesadilla is slapped together and pressed before I can say \\"just cheese\\". Or I'll say \\"salad\\" and the bored, unfriendly employee will *slop slop slop* spoon and dollop a bunch of ingredients in a bowl, whether I wanted them or not. It seems substitutions and personal preference are discouraged here.\\n\\nMost of the employees I've ordered from also don't seem to care very much, which turns out a sloppy and wasteful end product. I had a woman with a bad attitude discourage me from the 'craft 2' taco salad. She held up a teeny bowl with an incredulous look and said \\"it's this small!\\" Fine, a small salad, that's what I want, I told her it was fine. She glopped some lettuce and salsa in the bowl and then DROWNED the 1/3 cup of salad with \\"sour cream\\" (it was the runny consistency of ranch dressing) until it was essentially sour cream soup with lettuce mixed in. Then the cashier who was packaging everything accidentally dropped the bowl lid in the sour cream soup so that it went everywhere and was dripping down the sides. She shoved it in a bag with the rest of my food, coating everything in the drippy mess. When she noticed me watching her, she made a show of taking everything out of the bag and cleaning it up and repacking all of it (incorrectly in the largest takeout containers that had - awkward and wasteful).

It feels like a comprehensive mix of various French dishes with a country-side twist to them.  To that effect, you will find that the atmosphere perfectly compliments the food.  It looks like a little country-side house and you're being invited to taste some quality French cuisine.  I would still call it a \\"bistro\\" due to the type of food they serve.  They have the traditional coq au vin, confit de canard, and so forth.  I was in the mood today to go back to the basics.  I went for the French Onion Soup, which is done the right way.  The only other onion soup I've tried in Orlando area is at Paris Bistro in Winter Park, and this onion soup beats it out by far.  I think their utilization of apple cider is the trick.  It was delicious.  I highly recommend starting any meal you get here with a bowl of french onion soup.  It will become your standard for onion soups in the future.  \\n\\nMy meal was the New York Strip steak with bernaise sauce.  The meat was perfect.  It was amply juicy and bloody and it cut like butter.  The bernaise sauce is one of the best I've had.  Sometimes bistros will make the bernaise sauce too strong, but this one was nearly perfect.  The side dishes are indescribably good.  I was disappointed that they didn't have french fries because French restaurants usually have the best fries, but the side dishes that accompanied the steak more than made up for that.  The au gratin potatoes, the carrots, the green beans, they were all shockingly delicious.  I also tried some bites of the poisson de bronze and it was pretty delicious.  \\n\\nI overall think this is a great restaurant just shy of perfect 5 star quality.  I think it's closer to 5 stars than it is to 4 stars for sure.  The staff was all great and the food was terrific.  If there were any adjustments I would make, I would make the bread that comes before the meal better, and I would add french fries to the menu. Also, some of the corner tables are awkardly close to another table, so getting up may put your ass in the face of another customer.

We stopped in to check out the menu and see if I would be able to eat (I lean vegan). After discovering I could we talked to the hostess (who was very friendly) and asked about sitting on a higher level. She said no problem and we rebooked the reservation so she could add the note. She saved it and gave me a new confirmation. I then canceled the reservation I made through the app. \\n\\nI should mention that I had the disney dining plan. Paddlefish is signature dining so it is 2 dining credits. I did not use my credits but my friend, husband and child used theirs.  \\n\\nWe walked in and were greeted by a very unhappy hostess (total resting you know what face (RBF). She behaved like she was doing us a favor by checking us in. The host who took us to our table was not much better.  He showed us to a horrible table near the kitchen on the first floor (not even close to what we requested 2 weeks prior).  When I mentioned it he rolled his eyes and said everyone dislikes this table but they were busy and probably didn't have another seat. I told him we were not sitting there. He walked us back to the RBF. She was not happy to see us. She nastily just told him to take us to the 2nd floor let us pick our table and let her know. He said there was no note. I think RBF deleted the note as I saw our request saved. \\n\\nFood:  we had the lobster guacamole. It is made tableside and is a very nice portion. A small cup of lobster tail is put on top, so I was able to eat. My daughter loved it.  We ran out of chips before we ran out of guacamole. \\n\\nI had the fried green tomatoes and a green salad that had pears. I had them remove the queso (that our waitress didn't know was cheese). It was very tasty. \\n\\nMy daughter had the kids' crab. It was 3 small crab legs 3 little potatoes and a 1/2 of a corn on the cob. Definitely not worth 2 dining credits. \\n\\nMy friend had catfish. It came fried over a succotash. She liked it.  It definitely was not a 2 dining credit meal. \\n\\nMy husband has the Alaskan boil. It had Alaskan king and Queen crab, 1 corn on the cob (cut in 2) potatoes and I believe sausage. It was the 2 dining credits plus $17. \\n\\nDessert was very good.

However,  about once every 3-4 visits they screw up enough for my to raise my blood pressure and phone or use my smarty pants phone to make a complaint with corporate. Today was one of those occasion. I ordered one of my favorites, Asiago club  chicken sandwich just as it was on the menu, nothing special. I had walked in and was going back to work with my take-out order. They got the order together in a reasonable time and back to work I drove. Upon opening my wrapped sammie I bit in and thought, \\"well this isn't right.\\" So I opened the bun and there was no bacon and no cheese.  What the heck? That's what makes this sammie a club but the idiot that made it couldn't make it right. And there's talk about raising minimum wages, really?!? Anyway, I called cooperate and talked to a robot with my experience and didn't leave my phone number. Why, because the last time I did this within an hour I received a call from the manager with an apology and an offer for a free meal. I took them up on that last time but frankly I won't be back in the area again for their apologetic meal for another week, so heck with it. \\nAnyway, like I started out saying, most of the time this Wendy's is great but this is far from consistent."},{"name":"Tasty n Alder","address":"580 SW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"This food is beyond delicious.

A seasoned server would have known better than to have served rock hard fried eggs (\\"over medium, please\\"), the burnt and tepid  dregs of what was once lovely breakfast potatoes and I should have sent the whole plate back.

We asked the waitress for her suggestion and she said the chicken was her favourite ($7.50).  Just to mix it up, we ordered a lamb biryani ($11) as well.\\n\\nThe biryani was quite flavourful and delightful.

We both ordered scrambles which came out with huge servings of hash browns. For an extra 50 cents we were able to get a slice of gluten-free bread which was a nice option.

First of the plane was not easy to find from the monorail so if you can take the boat you get dropped off right out front. \\n\\nLet me first start by saying I am not a food snob by any means but certain meal price points have certain expectations. For two people under $100 big chain restaurants like Applebee's is the normal expectations. $100-$200 for two people you start to have a certain exception for service and food and over $200 you are in the fine dining zone (or a giant meal)\\n\\nSo when my meal here was over $200 I was expecting a higher level of service. Simple thing like having my red wine not poured in a white wine glass and my empty bread basket to be not left on the table until after dessert. The food was good for the price point (a little overprice but it is a disney establishment so it is expected) to sum up my experience I would say it was almost fine dinning quality food with cheap restaurant service (server was friendly)\\n\\nNow for the fireworks, we had good window seats but when the fireworks started a group of people went on the walk way and stood right in front of our view so just know that is a possibility. \\n\\nAfter talking to other people it seems like this is a hit or miss restaurant and I would probably not go back for another meal."},{"name":"Neptune Oyster","address":"63 Salem St","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"This place is unreal.\\n\\nThere's not much I can say that hasn't already been said.\\nI'll cut to the chase....the hot lobster roll basically changed my life. Dramatic, maybe. But closer to the truth than you probably think. \\n\\nSo, before my recent trip to Boston, I spend some majah time with Mr. Google looking up THE most mind blowing lobster roll in the city. I knew just from the photos on Yelp alone that Neptune Oyster would not disappoint, so I made it my very first stop once I arrived. Before I even checked into my hotel. I don't mess around when it comes to lobster rolls.\\n\\nI foolishly assumed that the wait would be minimal at 2:30 on a Friday afternoon for just little old me, party of one, gimme all your lobster and nobody gets hurt...I was wrong. So wrong. The hostess - poor thing - took my name and cell number and quoted me about 45 minutes. Starving but determined, I smiled and wandered the streets while I waited desperately for my phone to ring.\\n\\nThere's a restaurant across the street that looked like it had a bar where you could grab a drink while you were waiting to be called (in hindsight, I definitely should have done that) and a really cute little shop next door as well called Shake The Tree for jewelry, clothes, perfume and super cute girly stuff. But I was really hungry. And I was sure it had been at least an hour. So I went and stood in the doorway and stalked the place. I watched soooo many people leave discouraged at the quoted wait times...2 hours, 3 hours....crazy!\\n\\nFinally....FINALLY they came and welcomed me to the Promised Land. I sidled up to my little bar stool, smooshed between delightful folks on either side of me. I ordered a crisp glass of vino and filled out the cute little oyster order form (2 kumamotos, with mignonette...but they brought me cocktail sauce instead) and the piece de resistance, the hot lobster roll. Come to mama!\\n\\nOK. Seriously? I'm ruined for life. The pieces of lobster were just huge, barely coated with warm, salty butter. No filler. No crap. Lobster and butter. The way life should be. Crunchy grilled top split buttered bun. Even the fries were outstanding. Stop it, Neptune, you're killing me.\\n\\nSo pretty much it was perfect. The wait is long. Really long.

The dinning side has a lot of old school character.  Old circular booths that look like what you'd expect to see in a mob movie.  For the most part I think this ambiance works for a classic steak/prime rib place.  If you look close you'll see the booths are missing buttons and the chandeliers have mismatched light bulbs.  It could use an upgrade but it works.  For ambiance I'd give them 3 stars.\\n\\nWe ordered the prime rib (6 and 8 oz) and it was wheeled out on a mobile cart and cut in front of us.  The meat was perfectly cooked and good.  Mashed potatoes had good flavor as did the string beans which were obviously fresh. My only critique about the prime rib and mashed potatoes is that they were only luke warm.  We also ordered onion rings as a appetizer. Not the best onion rings I've had (batter is heavy and crumbly) but the portion size was generous and they were hot. Bread was actually quite fresh although cold.  Quality of food I'd rate as 3 stars.\\n\\nPrices were reasonable for a steak place...it's no Sizzler but that's also the bright side.  Onion rings were less than $9 and 8 oz. prime rib was less than $25. They have a prime rib special on Sunday's that starts at $15...that's a great deal which I'll probably be back to try.  Portion size was enough that we ended up with one additional meal (one person) for the next evening. Price/Portion gets 4 stars.\\n\\nThe service was quite good from the greeter to the waitress and meat cutter.  Frankly, I thought the service was consistent with what you would find at a more expensive place although they were noticeably casual. I'd rate service as 4 stars.\\n\\nOverall, this place is better than Saylor's but not as nice as the upper end steak places hence the \\"poor man's Ringside.\\"  Realistically I'd give it 3.5 but I always round up."},{"name":"RusTeak Restaurant & Wine Bar","address":"1568 Maguire Rd","city":"Ocoee","stars":"4","text":"RusTeak has extremely good food with great service!\\nThe Fork and Knife Sandwich with sweet potato tots was outstanding!

Isn't that the show of a great restaurant that you're keen to return for both special events and happy hours? \\n\\nWe usually begin with a round of daily oysters, brought in from Seaside or Seattle. There are some tempting cheese and charcuterie options available, but we avail ourselves of these fillers to jump straight into favorites like the Macaroni Gratin (the best in town), and seasonal veggies. My favorite, the Coq au Vin, is unlike any fried chicken in town. The gravy jus is poured table-side for additional flair, and the enoki mushrooms that seem out of place in a french dish are 100% necessary. The other house favorite is the Double Brie Burger, which speaks for itself.\\n\\nFor drinks, the eponymous Petite Oiseau house white is refreshing, clean, and a bit dry. We also enjoy their small but well-curated selection of rotating taps, such as a recent Anderson Valley Gose.\\n\\nThough their pastries are fantastic, Little Bird provides a singular mini macaroon for each patron with the bill.

Their menu is not extensive, but the quality of what they have is good.\\n\\nThe location is kinda hidden behind the Boston Public Library, but it's worth the investigation.

I didn't try the wings, but my 3 companions all said they weren't very good. \\"Almost too crispy\\" was one comment.  The mac and cheese was decent, although most of the ham bits were fatty.\\nThere was a special on mussel boils for each round of drinks we bought. I don't remember the exact price, but a very good deal on a half pound, so we got 2, each with a different sauce.  The mussels were decent and I found the signature sauce fairly tasty but it is made with a TON of garlic and I probably ate the equivalent of 3 bulbs in this sauce alone. It's mostly garlic, with some paprika and possibly other pepper. One friend thought it was far too aggressive. The other sauce, the moonshine, was absolutely disgusting, with the texture of mucilage and a taste somewhere between paste and sweet, salty paper. \\nStill hungry, we went on to order entrees.  I took no more chances and got a second boil with shrimp and the signature sauce. The shrimp was an excellent value ($19) as far as the boils are concerned. The full boil orders come with a pound (rather than the 1/2 lb specials we had earlier).  Sauce was the same, the shrimp was meaty, and I was quite satisfied with that part of the meal. My companions had gotten po'boys, both of which were reported to be \\"okay, but not mind blowing.\\" \\nWhich wouldn't be a bad assessment of the overall experience here. It's still a young restaurant and I wouldn't mind trying it again at some point."},{"name":"Pho Pasteur","address":"682 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"The service is brisk, unfriendly, but fairly quick.\\n\\nThe food ranged from unpalatable to initially decent but quickly soured. My two friends and I all had items from the vegetarian section. I had a sweet and sour tofu soup, which was good at first, but quickly just tasted sour. Maybe if it had more thai basil it would've evened out the flavors a little, but it didn't. Also, why pack a soup full of celery, but barely any of the featured pineapple? This just smacks of cheaping out.\\n\\nMy girlfriend had some kind of tofu and broccoli thing which made her sick to her stomach. It smelled like dog food, and didn't go down any better. The tofu was cooked well though. It was fried on the outside but smooth and light on the inside. This technical prowess made the general lack of quality in choosing ingredients and presenting the plates more depressing.\\n\\nI looked around and honestly even the meat dishes didn't look much better. They looked soggy, greasy, and lackluster.\\n\\nThe price isn't bad, especially if you get a big bowl and split it. But why would you spend your money on it? It's not good food. Really. It isn't.

The Sloppy Cuatro burger (essentially a  BBQ sandwich) wasn't bad and definitely is worth another eating. One thing I will gripe about is the chips...I don't know if they have a policy of stomping on chips before serving them, but we hardly had any large, intact, pieces for the queso (which was terrific). It's hard to scoop up queso when you're working with a chip the size of Lady Gaga's plastic finger nail. \\n\\nThere were times where it took our waitress some time to come over and check up on us, but overall it wasn't too bad. \\n\\nIf you can get there when the burgers are $4, it's definitely worth it."},{"name":"Mikado Sushi","address":"13586 Village Park Dr, Ste 306","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"The best sushi in Hunter's Creek!

First of all let me say that the server (Chris) is by far excellent and instead of being a server he should be a consultant or trainer for every restaurant. This guy was gracious, patient, informative and even offered to help crack the crab leg shell for us. He even offered an upsale that I couldn't refuse. I will ask for him on my next return in September. Now for the food, the Bloody Mary was by far the best I'd ever had and being an old bartender that is saying a lot for me. Chris recommended the Lobster corn dogs which are AMAZING, and something that will always be a must have item there. The Stone Crab was excellent and chilled and also pre-cracked. The Lobster roll was very good ( however the celery needs to be left out ). Overall Paddlefish with the help of Chris has surpassed the old Fultons but I would love to see the old Lobster Grilled Cheese on the menu.

Confident that this was the meal that caused our illness, I called the manager of the store, Javier, who told me he would talk to his chef and call me back. When he called me back, all he had to say was that he hadn't received any other calls regarding cases of food poisoning, and that his chef had no explanation, but that I should \\"keep in touch\\" if I'm not feeling better soon. He did not offer a refund or any other type of compensation, despite the fact that I was out of commission for 3 days and even lost money on Hawks tickets I bought because I was too sick to attend.

I was super impressed with not only the quality of the food, but the attentiveness of the staff and timeliness as well. I really dig the \\"just a sip\\" thing- $5 for 4 oz of the house white. it's just what you want for lunch! \\n\\nMy guy and I had the endive + nectarine salad, the seared fois gras cr√™pe, soft shrimp roll and duck confit. Everything was on point- seasoned well, presented well and made with obvious care. The endive salad was essentially all one texture, as it was a bowl of shaved, dressed endive, but the peanut dressing added that ooomph that it needed. The fois was super nice, too- tender and well-orchestrated. It was done in a simple, seared fashion and also delicately stuffed into a cr√™pe. Impressive dish. The duck confit and shrimp roll were less elegant, but delicious none the less. The duck was definitely cooked to perfection and the shrimp roll had the perfect amount of veggies. Nothing irks me like a dish that doesn't fully represent seasonal vegetables, but Little Bird really came through on that front. The only non-seasonal item was the cherries on the duck dish, but they were pickled, so it made a ton of sense. They were standout! \\n\\nMy server was super nice and genuine and the place was pretty full but not a disruptive atmosphere. All in all, I'm stoked that Little Bird has such an extensive lunch menu!

Well it was bad, and the turn and burn feel i got from the cashiers right off the bat confimed that. I decided to save my self the assumed disappointment of getting a coffee drink and go straight for the drip. I just wanted to get some caffeine in my system and be done. The coffee was alright, nothing special. It reminded me of standard diner fare, but the scone was horrific. Not only the first one, which had been baked to a hardened day old consistency, but the second one I was served after sending the first back, was addled with the complexities of a Betty Crocker buffet display case confection from the Marriot. It had zero flavor and zero blueberies as the name would have me believe. Im actually to tired to continue ranting, but remember not to ask for a refill from their puny cup of house drip at $2.

When going to Local on a Saturday night I expected to have to wait for a table, a lively loud atmosphere and great people watching/views to pair with a drink. I feel our experience delivered. We only had to wait about 35 minutes for a patio table (we had arrived at around 730pm). This was quite decent as I imagine people hang around with drinks for a long time so flipping tables wouldn't be easy. We were promptly offered drinks and asked if we would be eating. I had the mystery wine for 4 bucks. I prepared myself for vinegar. This was not the case. I'm not a wine connoisseur. I either like it or don't like it. It could be the 200 dollar I hate and the wine in the box I love. Or vice versa. Moral of the story- I like my mystery. Due to previous reviews we both got burgers. Yep. Reviews were right on- those burgers were super delicious. My one complaint is that they were a conversation killer. My husband and I both didn't speak until the burgers were done because they were that good. The server was bubbly and efficient. Not overbearing on the hang out, but we weren't left waiting for anything. I liked that even though there was a line to get in we didn't feel rushed to clear our table. I have a lot of a respect for an establishment when they do that because it makes you feel like an appreciated customer- not just a dollar sign. Overall nowthat we are in the neighbourhood this will probably be a 'local' spot for us. Are you going to have the most amazing dining experience of your life? No. That's not what this place is about. Reasonably priced good tasting casual food- you bet. Bonus points they make the patties & buns in house. Upbeat atmosphere with a prime people watching patio.

Don't get me wrong, I still ate it now. The bacon was thick cut and perfect crisp. They do the bacon right. The fried chicken was juicy and seasoned. Good portion. Their chicken biscuit is beyond that of a regular chicken biscuit for sure. Not quite Buttermilk but I'll put it a few steps behind. \\n\\nHashbrowns - I like them because they were tiny squares. They were fun to eat like fruit loops...ok if you don't like fruit loops, they're like Dippin Dots. Never eaten those either? Well, you're dead to me at this point. They were seasoned. A good number brunch places have a tendency to just serve hashbrown squares w/ nothing. Plain fried Legos at that point. Not even salt or pepper. These are seasoned. Some may find it salty, but hey maybe it's you that's salty and not the hashbrowns. I'M KIDDING. YOU'RE BEAUTIFUL. I liked the hashbrowns. Hey, shoulda got the hashed out plate.

You must not have seen it correctly.\\" - all but inferring I was hallucinating. \\n\\nAnd then, C tried to order chicken on her salad. The waiter brusquely informed her that her dish would take over 25 minutes because they don't just \\"do that and have chicken laying around.\\" (Curiously, the week before, C had ordered the same dish without comment.) \\n\\nAnd when our food arrived, the waiter snidely remarked: \\"Well, I'm shocked you got it that quickly.\\" \\n\\nInsert a plethora of disparaging comments throughout the dinner. \\n\\nAnd thus we arrive at the tip. I opted to tip a mere 10% - my companions left not more than 15% on their tabs. And the waiter returned to the table and huffed \\"Well, I'm surprised you felt I did that bad of a job.\\" He didn't ask for feedback, just complained about his tip...on his job...that he's supposed to do well...\\n\\nThat said, I'll probably revisit Scampo - I'm a glutton for delicious food. And the other time I'd dined, my experience was worthy of five stars. But, luckily, most of the other servers seem to be peppy and kind so as to rectify such uncalled for behavior."},{"name":"Darwin's","address":"1629 Cambridge St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"Discovering this place 6 years after i moved out of the area helps put the extent of my hermitude and loserness into perspective.

Everything was exceptional!  I ordered a variety of oysters and they were all fresh and delicious. The highlight of the meal was the octopus- I highly recommend it because it was cooked to a tender perfection, beautifully seasoned and served on a bed of greens and cauliflower.  We loved it so much that we ordered a second dish before leaving!\\nThey don't take reservations, so there may be a wait (we only waited 5-10 minutes having arrived at 6:00 on a Tuesday)- but, trust me, it is worth it!"},{"name":"Jason's Deli","address":"4073 Lavista Rd","city":"Tucker","stars":"3","text":"I've always been a fan of the Jason's Deli chain - it's an easy choice to make if you're looking for a quick, healthy(ish) meal. The menu is a bit similar to Panera - Jason's has a large focus on soups and sandwiches, though there's a much larger selection of sandwiches to choose from (BYO, paninis, mufalettas, etc.); there's also a fairly comprehensive salad bar, which seemed to be quite popular with customers. \\n\\nWe ordered the 'Sante Fe Chicken sandwich' and the 'Rachero' (with a side of the Chicken Pot Pie Soup) - both selections featured grilled chicken breast, which had I know initially I would've ordered something else, as I prefer variety, but I was pleasantly surprised by the difference in flavors and overall conception. Both options were tasty, but without a doubt the highlight of the meal was the 'Chicken Pot Pie' soup - which is essentially chicken soup with a biscuit, but still had all the components and flavors consistent with a traditional pot pie, and we both enjoyed it. \\n\\nThe very best thing about Jason's however is FREE ICE CREAM. Yes, all day, every day - with your meal purchase. Just be careful with the dispenser at this location, it tends to get stuck mid-dispensing, and then you'll just end up with a hand full of excess ice cream, which is not as fun as it sounds. \\n\\nIt did take quite awhile for our food to come out - typically, it takes less than than ten minutes, which is why it's a great place for a meal on the run - but it took almost 20 minutes this visit..so if you're really on a time crunch, simply order to-go!"},{"name":"Rosa Mexicano","address":"245 18th St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"My first time to finally try Rosa Mexicano.

The biscuit was buttery and flaky, with just enough softness in the layers.  The sharp cheddar and bacon are the last to hit my flavor palette, but works nonetheless.

Between the wall covering the booth on the other side of the waiting area & the host/hostess booth there wasn't enough room to get her through to go to the dining area. We made it work with a little squeezing and budging the hostess booth a little over. \\nThe restroom, labeled as handicap accessible, was super tight as well. Not to mention we had someone banging on the door the entire time I was in there helping my friend (granted she was a mother of a child who needed to use the restroom badly). The baby changing table, which does not have a way to stay closed, was a hindrance as I tried to get my friend out of her chair and onto her business. Getting out of the restroom was a little tough too as by the time of the evening there were MANY people waiting to be seated to eat. Luckily people who were waiting were kind enough to get up from the bench (directly across from restroom) and allow room for my friend to back out and leave.\\nEnd of the story here is that if you are in a wheelchair, things will be tight and/or you will have little room to move around.

It comes with either french fries, or a salad and I chose the salad since I had already had quite a few fried clams.  Fortunately, since it costs $25, the lobster roll did not disappoint.  The huge chunks of lightly dressed lobster meat were tucked into a perfectly toasted roll that tasted like brioche to me - faintly sweet, and a great complement to the lobster.

Since they don't take reservations we took the advice of other yelpers and came to the restaurant around 4pm to put our names down on the list. We were told that they would call us around 7pm to come in and we would have 10min from the time of their phone call to get back to the location. While making a reservation ahead of time would have been more convenient, this worked out really well. We walked around the North End for a few hours, took wayyy too many photos with the Boston sign in city hall plaza, and had some sangria at the Corner Cafe.\\n\\nNeptune Oyster summoned us at almost exactly 7pm and we walked into a very small and very busy restaurant. We ordered some oysters (I wish I'd remembered the names) and the hot lobster roll with butter. The oysters were amazing, lots of great flavors and not gritty but the star of the meal was the lobster roll. Personally, I thought the lobster roll lived up to the hype. The lobster was so delicious, the hot butter added to the flavor, and I cannot think of a single thing I would change about it. This lobster roll was by far the best I had while in Boston.\\n\\nIn terms of atmosphere, Neptune Oyster is a casual, fun place. Very busy, pretty loud, and definitely don't plan any crimes while there because everyone in the vicinity will hear.  \\n\\nOur waiter was very friendly, our wine was very good, and the company was great (though I have to give myself credit for that, and not Neptune Oyster).

Its not too bad because you end up hanging around one of the bars and having drinks or if you're lucky enough, getting a seat at the bar. When I came here the first time, I had the Crispy Cornmeal Waffles with Nutella drizzle, fresh strawberries, bananas, honey butter and it was amazing. I thought this dish was well presented and it was just the right amount to fill me up, A+. However, the second time I came, I had the Huevos Rancheros, and I can't say that they were that great, nothing special, pretty tasteless and dry. I don't have anything great to say about it, it just didn't present itself as what you would expect and it didn't have any kick... It wasn't spicy or flavorful in any way. My friends swear that they liked it, it could of been just the one time for me. \\n\\nThe environment is very friendly and fun, mostly young people here. The staff are great, but they can be pretty serious at times, but I guess I would be too if I had to deal with so many people constantly.

If you're into long waits for very mediocre food and having your waiter be more into their conversations in the kitchen than they are interested in serving you, then this is the place for you.

Oh I know why: the home fries, damn those home fries are GOOD.\\" \\n\\n*Hipster comment not intended to generalize all hipsters, and only applies to those hipsters employed by Magnolia Cafe.

This is definitley a place where the rating depends on what you order.  \\n\\nWe sampled 3 types of tacos, 3 types of enchiladas, tamale and Chile rellenos.  We found the tacos absolutely great -- The perfect amount of cilantro and onions and really flavorful spices on each type of taco.  The tacos are served with an awesome spicy taco sauce that has somewhat of a kick.  We especially liked the Fish taco and the Pastor Taco (pork marinated in a spicy sauce).  The tamale was also good ... not bland and had lot of flavor.  The Chile rellenos were just ok ... kind of mushy texture.  The enchiladas are better at other places.   If you go there definitely try some of the tacos ... there are at least 9 filling to choose from.  You can choose different shells, but we found the soft corn tortillas to be the best.\\n\\nThis place was pretty busy for a Sunday night.

The chicken was dryer than I'd like, but it was well seasoned enough, as for the barbacoa - I'm in love..I can't recall ever trying a goat meat taco, but this is good. It's super flavorful and perfectly tender - I know what my regular order will be. \\n\\nI also got to try the BF's steak and pulled pork tacos, both well cooked and tender.

So disappointing when a restaurant has all the key factors to pull you in, but falls well below your expectations. Great menu items such as duck egg ravioli and eggplant goat cheese honey crostini, had my guests and I dying to try this restaurant. We sat down and ordered just that along with the yellowtail crudo for starter. After getting the food and trying all the starters we were very disappointed. \\nThe crostini was bad, while the duck egg ravioli and crudo were edible but not enjoyable. \\nFor a restaurant that doesn't have many menu items, I would expect each dish to be polished and perfected. That includes properly cooking the ravioli and giving the crudo some actual flavor. I don't know what to suggest for the crostini, it was kind of disgusting. \\nMy guest and I did not stick around to order a main dish, we were not looking to be disappointed again, especially for the the price they were charging. The high price of the menu items definitely do not match up to the poor quality of flavors and execution that is being put out at the bar mezzana. I would hope to see some better execution and changes made in the future, because I do think the bar mezzana has some great menu item ideas."},{"name":"Bubor Cha Cha","address":"45 Beach St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"I've been coming to Bubor for years and the food was ALWAYS PHENOMENAL. The service was always terrible but what they lack in service they made up for in cuisine. Unfortunately, over the years there has been a decline in food quality. \\n\\nClose your eyes and imagine - cue dreamy harp music\\n\\nYou walk in and see scores of food paraded to tables. Your nose is tickled with delight from the wonderful aromas and spices.  You haven't checked the menu yet, but you're already sure of what you want.  A dish from the couple at table 3. Two dishes from the family of eight that seems to have ordered half the menu. Oooh perhaps that dish from the guy eating alone near the window. And whatever the waitress us carrying out from the kitchen right now!  They all look splendid! \\n\\nAfter taking your seat and sipping hot tea you wait 15 minutes for someone to come over so you can place your order. Surprisingly, the food comes quickly. One after the other. Your meal consists of: Hot & Sour Soup,  Ginger & Scallion Lobster, Vegetable Lo Mein, Sauteed Jumbo Shrimp & Vegetables, half Roast Duck, and baked custard buns for dessert! \\n\\nBefore I continue, I must say the duck (despite the decline of other dishes) is always perfect and never fatty/greasy. The other dishes leave a bit to be desired. One of the reasons I initially fell in love with BCC is its H&S soup. For years it's been my go-to place, however, I think the restaurant has changed cooks bcz there was cilantro on my soup as a garnish. I  despise cilantro. It tastes awkward and it ruined the soup. Oh well, there were still plenty of other choices,  right?  Not exactly... \\n\\nThe Lo Mein was so oily that my lips were shiny. It's as if they wanted to kill two birds with one stone by creating a lip gloss meal. That seemed to be the theme for the lobster and shrimp dish as well. The only thing that wasn't, surprisingly, was the duck (and the buns, of course).\\n\\nSetting aside my disappointment with service and the liberal oil use in the kitchen. Bubor will always have a special place in my heart with its duck and H&S soup (I'll just tell thm to hold the cilantro henceforth)."},{"name":"Cafe Allegro","address":"12386 SW Main St","city":"Tigard","stars":"3","text":"I ordered a delivery meal and was very happy!
