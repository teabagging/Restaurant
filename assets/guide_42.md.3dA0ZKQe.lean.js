I went to Lee Yuan with a large group of 20, split into 2 tables of 10.  We had a reservation and it was a Wednesday night, so they seemed ready for us.  \\nI ordered Wonton Soup, an Egg Roll, and the House Spicy Lamb.  The soup and the egg roll were great, but the problem was my entree.  They started bringing plates out one at a time, very slowly.  This was actually understandable considering it was a small place and there were a lot of us.  But my entree took AN HOUR AND A HALF.  Not exaggerating. Another woman at my table ordered a steamed fish filet, and her order only arrived 5 minutes before they realized my entree was missing.  When I finally asked the owner why the lamb had not arrived yet.  She started yelling at me that she had already sent the lamb out.  Then she went between both large tables, yelling that someone must have eaten the lamb and asking what was on already-emptied plates.  She refused to believe that no one in our party had seen the Lamb.  At this point most of our party had finished eating and everyone was simply waiting around for me to get my food. \\n\\nFinally, she went back to the kitchen to make another one, which took an additional 20 minutes.  Even after the dish was delivered, I had to wait another 10 minutes for a bowl of white rice.  To be honest, this would have been forgivable if the dish was delicious enough to be worth the wait, but it really was not.  Sliced lamb, stir fried with vegetables and a brown sauce with red pepper flakes.  It was not very spicy, but it still tasted pretty good, until I realized that the dish included a HUGE scoop of dried shrimp paste.  Now, I actually really like shrimp paste.  The problem was she put so much into the dish that it overpowered everything.  Every bite tasted like shrimp.  I couldn't eat it and was way too frustrated at this point to even tell the owner that it was awful.  I will say that I sampled other dishes from people at my table, including the steamed fish, shredded duck and walnut shrimp, and all of those were excellent and I would order those again in a heartbeat.  I guess it just was not my night.\\n\\nI know this is a small, family run restaurant with many loyal patrons, and I did like some of the food that I tried.

It never works for me. Justin, our server, was great. He didn't need to explain to me what an prix fix menu is but maybe they get a lot of people in here that do? I dunno. Anyway, he made it very clear that he wanted to ensure that we were comfortable and had a pleasant experience. Great service. The only issue I had was that they seemed to have a number of sommeliers, but one never came by our table. I guess maybe they got the sense that my wife and I weren't going to buy one of the $500 bottles of wine with our meal, so they didn't want to make the effort. Our waiter took care of us just fine, however. He also asked about our parking ticket, which I might have forgotten to validate if not for him. Overall, great service.\\nThe views were nice but our table was set fairly far back from the windows so we really couldn't see out. Also, they cram as many tables as they can by the windows so whenever I looked out the window, I felt like I was staring at someone at one of the tables.\\nThe food was good, but not great. My wife thought it was excellent, but I think they left the flavor out of the product. I started with the clam chowder which was quite good, but rather thin. I prefer a nice thick clam chowder. This chowder was also fairly spicy. Fine for me, but it meant my wife couldn't try any. I followed that with the prime sirloin. It was a nice cut of meat, seasoned nicely and well marbled but the meat just seriously lacked flavor. What this tells me is that the $47 meat was not the best quality stuff. Maybe an issue with the food source of the bovine. It was still good, but not great.\\nThe bottom line here is that this is another restaurant that is good, but doesn't meet my price/taste ratio. When I spend over $150 on a meal, it had better be amazing. I would have preferred to eat at Jardiniere in SF or the London in NYC."},{"name":"Kingmakers","address":"","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"First time visit. The place was packed.

Now at this point I'm basically done with my meal sans tail and I don't want reheated (by whatever means) lobster tail just so I can say I ate it.  The possible manager asked what I would like done to fix it so I just asked that the tail be removed from the bill.  In fairness they took off 5 dollars for what they felt was the value of a lobster tail. That's fine  and maybe financially minded homo-economicus says great the wrong was righted.

The clientele is made up of three types of people: old people, who still think it's the horrifyingly disgusting Howard's, that probably eat there every day, and who you can literally see them waiting for death in their facial expressions, pondering: \\"Will it be tonight? Will it be on the way home? Am I already dead?\\"; there are large, loud families with tired parents and hundreds of crying and running around kids; and people from out of town, who read or saw pictures of what looked like a trendy new spot in the revitalized Smyrna area.\\n\\nThe first thing you'll notice is there is zero smoke coming from it's BBQ pits and smokers - and that's because there aren't any. Now, I could be incorrect here, but I drive by this place every morning and evening to and from work, and not once, aside from the heating vent that spews out warm water vapour when it's cold, have I seen anything that resembles that white, thick, tantizlingly tasty magic rising from anywhere. It doesn't even remotely smell like smoke in or anywhere near the building, but more like a Ryan's or a Golden Coral.\\n\\nThe second thing you'll notice is it's basically the same staff left over from Howard's (and from what I understand, the head chief is - or was - a crackhead... really. I wish I was making that up) and no one there is very knowledgable about anything, nor do they hold any sort of real personal opinions about the food. Maybe they're made to \\"love\\" everything, but I'm pretty sure if you asked them how tasty the steaming pile of shit was they'd go: \\"Oh, hun! Thayt's mhy fahv'rit!\\"\\n\\nThirdly, the food is horrible. Obviously. Listen to the other reviews here. They're not just bad days or people who don't know food or someone who simply decided to give a bad review: this place stinks. And it reminds me of those sad meals everyone has made for themselves more times than most of us care to admit, where you go to the store planning to make something you think sounds really good; you cook it up, season it, everything is going well; but when you put it on your plate, you realize it looks formless and unattractive, and when you eat it, it's tasteless and boring, and it leaves you full of regret and empty of food, though you now feel sort of sick and your appetite is long gone, and you're left thinking \\"I'd rather be hungry and not have wasted $20+ buying the supplies, instead of that.\\" You don't even keep your failed experiment - you toss it right in the trash. You don't even offer it to the cat or the dog. And you don't even invite your asshole neighbor over to have some. You just throw it away. That's what the food is like here.\\n\\nI got the pulled-pork sandwich with the house hot sauce, collards, mac n' cheese... and honestly, the fourth thing I can't even recall. Uh... it was so bland and easy to forget. OH! I remember now: it was black eyed peas. Yes. And the fourth thing was black eyed peas. Awful. All of it.\\n\\nThe pork was dry and tasted like it had been flavoured with liquid smoke and left out until it was time to be served, where it probably went through a quick zap in the microwave. It was chewy - almost like rubber. And did I say dry? Oh yes. It was dry! I downed about three glasses of sweet tea just to get through half of it. The house hot sauce, which probably took them 5 seconds to \\"create\\", I stopped using after a few bites. The collards tasted like they'd been slowly cooking for three weeks. Sludge stewed with loads of salt and sugar, or maybe it was simply just the residue left over from the completly demolecularized collards. You don't even need a fork - just ask the waiter to bring you a straw. The mac n' cheese was like the pork: it tasted like it had been made days before and put in the little bowl they come out in, left to sit until its time to meet its maker in the microwave, before being served to some poor unexpecting bastard. It had a film on top of it that was five shades darker than the dull golden inside, and the taste itself was just as bland and fake. Lastly, I always judge a \\"southern\\" place on its sweet tea, and this place was lacking.\\n\\nI'm a southern boy as I've said in other reviews. I love the food I was brought up on. But I'm not a professional, nor do I know how to make the best of it, but I do know when it's crap, and this place takes that stinky cake (though if they sell cake, I would advise in not getting it). But if you don't believe me look at their website. It's full of stock images of food that is not theirs. Or go and see for yourself; and instead of being old, and wondering if tonight was going to be the night that you finally croaked on the way home, be you as you are now, wondering if tonight was going to be the night you finally shit your pants on the way home.\\n\\nAnd lastly, they do not sell mozzarella sticks.

My mom had a grill cheese (I know..a little intense for breakfast but hey..she loves it) and she said it was \\"delightfully crispy with a hint of cilantro.\\" I ordered a \\"Neal Taco\\" which came with eggs, spinach and just the right amount of cheese.

This is a tourist trap if I've ever seen one -- but worth a visit just so you don't have to go again later.\\n\\nExtremely hard to get good service here. We sat at the casual section, had nobody come by after like 5 min, so we moved to the oyster bar. That was a fun scene -- but still, these are oyster shuckers more than customer-facing barmen. Very interesting to watch what's going on though -- especially since the oyster bar has the beer taps which service the main dining room, so you can see the drinks going up and down the dumbwaiter.\\n\\nCouple of notes:\\n\\n1) If you order oysters from the bar, they'll shuck them freshly for you. If you order oysters from the lounge or the restaurant -- they use PRE SHUCKED OYSTERS from a box. Sure, they might have been shucked \\"recently\\" a good 30 minutes or hour earlier, but in my opinion this is completely unacceptable. A fly was buzzing around, and the oysters looked like crap.\\n\\n2) These aren't the nicest oysters around... they're cheaper than Neptune Oyster, but they really just aren't very good. At Neptune they say things like, \\"Med size, low brine, pea finish with citrus notes\\" -- and the oysters are plump, juicy, and taste just like that. At Union -- they taste like \\"oyster\\" but we didn't really taste any particular flavor beyond that.\\n\\n3) The way they shuck the oyster is using a knife on a rock such that all of the oyster's liquid is dumped out onto the rock... so you really don't get any awesome oyster juices...\\n\\n4) The guy definitely was inspecting each oyster, and throwing out a good number of \\"rejects\\" -- glad to see the quality control. However, I think he was only inspecting one side of the oyster -- there was no flipping of the oyster to see if both sides were good (as they do at Neptune). Not sure which approach is the normal way to do it for the east coast -- I don't have enough Oyster experience.\\n\\n5) Steamed mussels were pretty solid. \\n\\nAll in all, I'd probably just grab a beer there (we had gotten some wine, but didn't really work out for us with the scene and flavors) and maybe some oysters and mussels if a friend from out of town wanted to go.

And it really has potential but unfortunately all the meats were bland in taste. They didn't have the Mexican kick I was looking for. The chorizo was salty and the rest had almost no seasoning at all. Also the fried potatoes slices were soggy instead of crispy. I was had such high expectations but I was let down.

We were informed of the \\"typo\\" on the menu when we ordered but I decided to try it anyways. \\n\\nThe baked seafood on rice is almost identical to Copa Cafe's dish (rice, scrambled eggs, shrimp, mussel, fish, small scallops, topped with white sauce), but with less sauce, which made it a dry dish. I prefer this dish to be saucy. For the linguini, we were told that they were out of shrimp so it was just linguini, lobster, mushroom, onion, and sauce. I had one bite of the linguini and immediately wish I had ordered the baked seafood on rice for myself instead, usually my staple. My husband was kind enough to switch dishes half way. Unfortunately, the baked seafood was equally unpleasant.  While the baked seafood dish had a sufficient amount of sauce, both dishes lacked seasoning and were quite bland. \\n\\nService: Quick service and attentive staff. Our food arrived quickly, about 5 minutes after we ordered. \\n\\nAtmosphere: Nice decor. The restaurant was quiet despite it being about half full.\\n\\nThoughts: While M Cafe has similar menu, price, and portions as Copa Cafe, Copa has better food. I wanted to give a rating of 1, but husband wanted to give it a 2. \\n\\nReturn?: No, not unless they improve the quality of food.\\n\\nApril 13, 2018 edit: It seems that they have worked out some of the issues in terms of the physical menu and seasoning the food.

We came in from Boston where we live and where we have eaten in many fine restaurants. My guy friend looked on the internet to find \\"southern cooking\\" restaurants. This was one of the most highly recommended. My mother, now 92, who grew up in Atlanta, had been there years ago but commented that it was still highly thought of, rated highly, etc. My friend wanted fried chicken and the works so off we went. When we walked in, we noticed the many photos of the famous visitors over the years thinking this MUST be the place to eat in Atlanta! We were greeted by a very friendly waiter who gave us the run-down on the restaurant and how the ordering worked, etc. We ordered, the waiter brought the weirdest appetizer...something quite greasy actually...pot of greens with the instructions to dip the corn bread into this mixture. We all took  a bite of it....sort of looked at each other...WAY too salty, for one thing! Worse yet, it was tasteless! Okay, I've had excellent greens in Boston, believe it or not! These didn't come close, trust me! So, the little muffins and yeast rolls were next...very good rolls, the little corn bread muffins dry and nothing to write home about...also not warm! It was literally 7 minutes from the time we ordered until the food arrived. That was an immediate tip-off that the order had been nuked or had been sitting in warmers and thrown on plates. The waiter had told us that everything was made fresh daily. (What he left out was that it was made much earlier that day.) The fried chicken for all of us was lukewarm, and was mediocre at best. (We were figuring that it had been sitting in a warmer for hours.) Seriously, southerners, this isn't my mother's fried chicken. I can make better fried chicken than Mary Mac's restaurant, and so can many more people I know. This was just so disappointing!\\nThe only redeeming part of the meal was the mac and cheese, although pretty greasy too! (It had been nuked to be pretty warm.) Fried green tomatoes were lukewarm and just okay. One of us had the meatloaf, highly recommended by the waiter. Keep this one to yourself next time, fella! It was also tasteless.\\nWell we thought maybe the meal could be topped off with Georgia peach cobbler. It was a gooey mess under a bit of dough. We thought the peaches were canned, not sure.\\nThere was a big guy in a red shirt walking around asking if everyone's meal was okay, etc. We just didn't have the heart to tell him how disappointed we were with the entire experience. It would have ruined our time together with my mother. When we got back to my mother's condo, we were telling some friends of hers about the restaurant. They all said the same thing....\\"Oh it's under new ownership; it's not at all what it used to be....\\" We wished we'd heard that BEFORE going. Take heed, Yelp readers. I \\"YELP\\" restaurants a lot and listen to what people have to say. GO SOMEWHERE ELSE if looking for authentic southern cooking. IT'S pure bulk! So sorry, Mary Mac's.

Thanks."},{"name":"Kin Resto Bar","address":"1500 Robson St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"I had heard some good reviews for this place, so I was excited when a Groupon came out for it and it gave me a good opportunity to check it out.  I went with my fianc√©, and unfortunately we had a pretty terrible experience.  There were some good aspects, however, so I'll begin with those.\\n\\nThe food itself was pretty good.  Good flavour, good presentation, and a nice selection of dishes.  Our two servers were friendly and helpful.  Alas, there ends the compliments.\\n\\nThe ambiance and decor appeared to be sophisticated and intimate and seemed appealing at first glance, but it quickly became apparent that there were problems.  There was absolutely no sound absorption in the small dining room, so the conversation from a table of four beside us, which was not inappropriately loud, completely overwhelmed the room to the point that my date and I could hardly hear ourselves think.  Also, and again in this small room, one of the walls was used to project a baseball game, which was completely bizarre because a) the restaurant was not otherwise a sports bar; b) it was really distracting to have the light flashing on an entire wall of the small room; and c) this is Vancouver; no one is going to a restaurant to watch pro baseball.  A Canucks game would have been far more understandable, and it still would have been out of place.  Finally, the menus we were given were scruffy and dirty.  My cardboard menu had dried food on it.\\n\\nThe food service was utterly disorganized.  My date and I ordered several appetizers to start and a main course for each of us.  Within a few minutes of ordering, my main course (a curry) was served to me.  We were surprised, but we're open to new experiences so we just thought this was the way things were done at this restaurant.  A few minutes later, the server came back, said something about checking my dish for prawns, and took the dish back to the kitchen.  A moment later, she came back out with it and served it to the table behind us!  She couldn't have known for sure that I had not already started eating it, and even if she had been sure, it's completely ridiculous to re-serve food that's been served to, and handled by, another patron.  The server would not have explained the situation to me had I not actively caught her attention, at which point she just said that my dish will be out in a few minutes.  Our appetizers were served shortly after, and then my date was served his main course, which then became cold in the ten minutes we waited for my main dish, the curry.  It was a complete gong show, and our experience got even worse after this.\\n\\nThe entire time I was thinking that sometimes you try out a new place because of a Groupon, and you win some, you lose some, but at least you get a good deal to take the sting out of a place that didn't work out.  So at the end of the evening I asked for the bill and presented my Groupon, which the server took without hesitation.  Several minutes later she came back and told me that she was not able to process the Groupon, that she could not match the Groupon number with her records, there was a problem with Groupon, etc etc.  She said that her boss would let her give us a 10% discount, which would have amounted to a far smaller discount than what the Groupon would have been worth.  When I explained this to her, she said she would ask her boss if she could give me a bigger discount.  She came back and offered a 20% discount, the value of which still ended up being only about a half of the discount we would have received with the Groupon.  She also said, by way of trying to make the situation better, that we would be able to get a refund for the Groupon.  I countered that my being able to get my purchase price back from Groupon is irrelevant; I would not have dined anywhere that particular day had it not been for the Groupon discount.  Under these circumstances, given that the Groupon was clearly valid, and especially in light of all of the screw ups with our food, the least the management could have done is given us a discount equivalent to the value of the Groupon deal.  I was also highly unimpressed that this poor server, with her limited power, was being left to take care of this situation by herself.  It would have been much more appropriate for a manager to come and take responsibility.   \\n\\nConclusion: Good food and good location, poor ambiance, terrible kitchen and service management.  We will never return and we will advise others to avoid this establishment as well."},{"name":"Union Oyster House","address":"41 Union St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"While vacationing in Boston with my husband we saw the big sign on top of the building and thought we should eat!

I think Chick-fil-A beats this place for the waffle fries.  \\n\\nRed Headed Stranger - this was pretty good.  I wasn't sure if I was suppose to eat the bacon or not, and I couldn't because there were too much black pepper on it.

Kinda heavy on the mix IMO. \\n\\nNormally I order a steak or chicken fajita burrito.  Comes out on a sizzling platter which keeps the food hot and over all it's good for effect.  But for some reason they didn't serve it the way they normally did.  Which irked me for some off the wall reason?

I would not get it any other day simply because it's a VERY small amount.  that much for $3 is great!  But for 9?  I would snap.   The guy making our guac was a douche too.  No conversation, No asking how we were doing, no eye contact...Nothing.  He simply asked, medium, mild or hot and nothing more.  15 min later another girl was making guac for a table and she was VERY kind, asking the customers how chunky they wanted their guacamole, the spiciness, etc....that shows your service really depends on who you get.  It's not that I wanna talk to everyone that comes to our table...CUZ I DONT....but when you're making something for us and we're waiting for you to leave.....a little friendly conversation would help the time and awkwardness pass by.\\n\\nAlso, I realized I dont like the outside dinning there.  Think about this!  Should a restaurant have outdoor seating by the front door?  What could be the possible draw backs? Well, when a SMOKER is done with his/her food, where do they go to smoke?  OUT FRONT!  My wife got up and told a guy we're trying to eat and are ready to get sick from his cigarette smoke.  He was cool enough to put it out and go back in, but 15 min later another person was out lighting up.   In my opinion if you have outdoor seating, you should put it in a location that is away from customers smoking out front. \\n\\nA year ago I might have gave them 5 stars, but yesterdays experience just wasn't what it used to be.

The oysters here are from Texas brought every few days and the server shucks them right in front of you.  How awesome is that?!  Get a bucket, grab your oyster fork, some napkins and prepare to chow down.  I shared a bucket with a friend and I probably could have easily had another one.  It was just so good, seriously.  They have saltines, lemon juice, hot sauce, and cocktail sauce bottles to accompany your oysters.  I also had some horseradish on the side.  It was fun experience, interacting with the server as he shucks your oysters.  As soon as he shucked one, I ate it instantly, it was just that good.  I cannot vouch for how the steamed oysters taste, but the raw oysters were just phenomenal.  So simple, yet so good.

The other thing that put me off was two waitresses moving barstools across the lounge for a large party. One waitress easily carried her barstool, while the other dragged hers across the tiles making the worst grating noise. Every time she passed a table dragging it she would look at the guests (including us) and say \\"I know, the sound is annoying\\".

Although this is a chain that started in LA, the location serves up a good bowl of Ramen and does not disappoint for those looking for a slurp-worthy Ramen bowl. \\n\\nOne of the things about this location in the Sandy Springs shopping center is that it is very small inside with only space for around 6 tables plus the bar.

The Brussel sprouts in the Sproutin' Up Ramen are a unique take on Ramen and something I had never seen before, but if you're a fan of caramelized Brussel sprouts you should look no further on the menu. The blend of the broth and carmelized Brussel flavor is magic. If you're not a fan of large slices of pork that can sometimes lack a bold flavor in a Ramen bowl, then the Spicy Umami offers ground pork with a spicy and flavorful broth that brings the bok choy in the dish to life. The pork gyoza is also very good and the gyoza sauce on the table is a nice compliment that doesn't overpower the dish.

She has no sense of urgency, and honestly can't handle a full bar nor can she handle an empty bar.

My salad came before everyone else's food even though two others had ordered salad, one was the same salad as mine.\\n\\nThe lobster roll was outstanding. Overflowing with lobster, with good bits of crunchy celery flavor coming through and light mayo. The bun is pan toasted in butter and the butter taste really shines through. It might be too rich for some but I loved it.

The bread was a bit stale tasting and we were confusing by the cold marinara sauce on the side. Was it supposed to be hot? We tried the calamari and eggplant rollatini for apps. Calamari was okay but the batter didn't stick so every time you pick one up the batter falls off. The eggplant rollatini was actually good. Would recommend it. My husband ordered the tavern burger cooked medium. He says it was like a hockey puck. Not good. I got the broccoli rabe pasta dish under north end specialities, which is my fave dish in the north end. It was flavorless unfortunately. Our moms ordered chicken Marsala which they said was okay.

That got her a 20% tip from everyone...if not a little more. \\n\\n3 or 4 Bretzel's went around the table. The house mustard an obatzda (cheese dip) are fantastic but the schmaltz (a lard) was weird and more something an American would put in a pan before frying up an egg. \\n\\nAlso around the table were a few orders of Frites.

They've done a really nice build out of the space, a counter to order at, separate dining room and bar area. \\n\\nWe had\\nPulled pork plate\\nRib plate\\nBrunswick stew\\nColeslaw \\nMac and Cheese\\n\\nI brought Mr. Picky the BBQ expert. His palate is far more refined than mine when it comes to BBQ.  He knows his regional influences, meat quality and can usually identify what cooking methods and short cuts were taken.\\n\\nHis take on the pulled pork was that it was very good, not overly sauced prior to serving, not mushy or dry.  It appeared the butt was actually smoked and than pulled apart, not finished on the smoker after boiling.  As good as he has had around here.\\n\\nColeslaw was fresh, good and tasty.  Nice balance of mayo and vinegar.  Vegetables were crunchy. \\n\\nBrunswick stew, very good, touch on the vinegary side but not overwhelming, nice texture,  not runny.  Mr. Picky, who tends towards sweet as opposed to vinegary, hit the stew with a splash of sauce and enjoyed it very much - thats a personal preference though. The meat was not over cooked and the veggies in the stew still held their texture/flavor.\\n\\nI had the ribs, brunswick stew and mac and cheese.\\n\\nThe meat (which Mr. Picky sampled and agreed upon) was extremely high quality instead of what is normally served for pork ribs in most BBQ joints.  Wasn't fatty in the least, which initially made me wonder, beef?   No, just really good pork with nice texture, good flavor and not slimy with fat.  I believe the ribs were a St. Louis cut. The ribs had a fairly spicy rub on them.  I liked it, but some might find it too spicy.  The ribs had a decent bark, which is that \\"crust\\" formed from the fat in the meat, the rub, the sugars in the rub/sauce, the cooking process and time.  The bark wasn't burnt, which isn't bark - its burnt.\\n\\nI liked the mac and cheese.  It was made with more than one cheese, was not greasy and the pasta still had some resistance.  \\n\\nWe tried 2 of the sauces, the St Louis and one other - not the NC sauce.  Both good!\\n\\nThis is also the first time I've eaten the bread in a BBQ joint ever.  Mr. Picky didn't like what the bread was spread with, but he agreed, it wasn't a loaf of something wrapped in plastic.\\n\\nCons - well, price.  40.00 for two people for BBQ is pretty $pendy.  But then again, they are obviously spending money on ingredients, a location in Decatur cannot be cheap (I'm sure that build out cost them a fortune) they have an actual staff - fairly significant overhead.  Still, will people  be deterred by the price?  Time will tell."},{"name":"Red Bud Restaurant","address":"120-8360 Granville Avenue","city":"Richmond","stars":"3.5","text":"Red Bud is your typical HK style cafe restaurant. It's located in a busy plaza, with shared parking. This means that finding parking can be an arduous task, especially during dim sum hours. There's a cheap dim sum restaurant in the same plaza. The restaurant setting was a little more upscale than your usual hk caf√©s. It was also quite spacious. \\n\\nThe breakfast menu had two pages. Two things I noticed: 1) the prices are slightly higher than others in Richmond in that for the same price, the meal would come with more items at other restaurants. 2) instead of congee, they have a couple of options for savoury oatmeal. You'd add $1 for cold drinks.\\n\\nI chose the noodle in soup, with luncheon meat and beef brisket. The beef brisket was quite tender. I got the cold Yuan Yang (milk tea/coffee) and it was probably one of the worst I've had. It was so watered down!!! Elaborating on my aforementioned point above, usually at other restaurants, my noodle would come with an additional item such as congee, rice roll etc. My husband got the 2 eggs + 2 meat combo. He chose the cream sauce macaroni instead of toast. Upon taking a bite, he regretted not choosing the toast. I took a bite of the macaroni and it was so bland.

The beef was two cuts of beef in one dish (I think it consisted of a medallion of the bistro steak, which was awesome, and a small filet of beef.  I guess the chef was trying to give us a sampler of everything) on top of potatoes with jus, which was a tad salty.  The special that night, the pork, was served with swiss chard and turnips in another awesome sauce.  I love pork, but would have loved the dish more if the pork had been served on the bone.

First, the restaurant is really beautiful and the atmosphere is inviting. There were quite a few large groups who really seemed to feel at home and were having a great time. Since I went by myself, I sat at the bar. The drinks on the menu are really fun and creative and I decided to try a cucumber + alcohol drink (of course I can't remember the name) but it was absolutely deliciously and beautifully presented. I then ordered the seaweed salad and believe me, I'm a fan of this salad and have eaten it at quite a few restaurants and have also made it at home. I find that restaurants often give super tiny portions of seaweed salad and it always leaves me wishing for seconds. Katana's salad was a nice healthy portion; which of course pleased me greatly and the flavoring was perfect - not too sweet but just enough. Thumbs up for that! I then ordered the Sashimi platter. It was $28 and really nicely presented on a wooden slab. Now, I absolutely adore Sashimi and to be honest, the 'flavor' of the some of the Sashimi was not as exquisite as I prefer. It was buttery, yes, but missed the mark just a bit on quality. In other words, I'd give it a 4 out of 5 on the taste scale. But it wasn't bad per se and definitely wasn't a 3.

One of my colleagues is good friends with Bobby so even though we were running late from the airport, we still managed to get a coveted lunch reservation and were seated immediately. We had a great view into the Italian-import pizza oven, which apparently had a hard time getting to the States (thanks, Customs!), whereas behind us was the much-praised VDF slicer. \\nI was surprised to see a relatively small wine list (and it wasn't mentioned that we could order from Frasca's list), so we ordered glasses of the Falanghina and a Rose to start, along with an Aperol spritzer - all refreshing after an hour on the road. The breakdown of what we ordered to eat is as follows:\\nFrutti di Mare salad: 3/5\\nThis was actually my least favorite dish. I really only picked out the grilled octopus and potato, and left the other seafood (not a fan of chilled mussels). The briny capers were a nice touch, and I swabbed some focaccia through the leftover vinaigrette.\\nPolpettine: 4/5\\nTasty (but tiny) veal meatballs were served in a shallow dish with walnut pesto. There were 5 of them and 3 of us, so it was a little hard to share, but the flavor was delicious. Just wish there had been more :)\\nAffetati Misti: 5/5\\nEven the \\"small\\" size of the meat plate was a sizable portion - lush ribbons of prosicutto, pistachio-studded mortadella, and salty thin-sliced rounds of house salame. Each of the meats had a distinctive flavor, and it was a great mixed platter.\\nPizza Diavola: 4/5\\nI enjoyed the salame piccante on this pizza very much - the spicy heat was a good match for the Nero d'Avola that I ordered as my second glass. I wasn't the biggest fan of the provola di bufala cheese on this pie though; it got kinda clumped together but the flavor was great.\\nPizza Funghi: 4/5\\nA white pie strewn with thick slabs of porcini mushroom, it was also redolent of roasted garlic and the subtle sharp tang of Pecorino - great combination.\\nPizza Mais: 10/5\\nThis was possibly my favorite pizza of all time. Another white pie, it was topped with creme fraiche, mozzarella, and swaths of prosciutto, with a showering of the sweetest, freshest corn I've ever had. The corn kernels took on a gorgeous roasty flavor from the oven, and it was simply pizza perfection.\\nSomehow we saved room for dessert, mainly because I had been fantasizing about the budino (butterscotch pudding) all day. Sadly, they were out. Our gracious server, Carson, forced us to order the Saltimbocca di Nutella instead. It wasn't much of an arm-twister, because this little Nutella roll-up was absolutely delicious. There was a little too much powdered sugar on top for my taste, but the Nutella was soft & melty chocolate goodness. I almost wished we had gotten the larger version, but by that time we had each consumed so many carbs that it was hard to get up from the table!\\nWe then were lucky enough to get a behind-the-scenes kitchen tour from the GM Chris Donato, who besides having the most strikingly blue eyes I've seen in recent memory is the most genuinely nice guy I've ever met (well, besides Bobby, who I met in Aspen). He rolled us into the kitchen, which was pretty intense - the single kitchen serves both Frasca and PL, plus the cafe. They have a proofing room for the pizza dough, and even a room dedicated to just glassware. We ended up in the cafe next door, which you should not miss. They have homemade pretzel twists AND Nutella milkshakes to make the long drive to Denver bearable :)\\nAll in all, I can see this as the pit stop to Aspen every year. You will definitely \\"mangia bene\\" at Pizzeria Locale!

They all look so good. But, inevitably, after standing in line for 45 minutes, watching waffle after waffle cruelly pass me by, when it comes time to order my brain has turned to putty in the face of such crispy, buttery, deliciousness.

However, I'm one of those people who gets kind of dumb and gentle when hungover. You can put me in a line and I will stand in it forever without really noticing. Until I get hungry. Then I'm no longer gentle. But basically, the line doesn't bother me. If anything it is just part of the diner experience and makes me feel I've earned that waffle.

Though we were heavy on the \\"please\\" and \\"thank you\\" she gave us nothing but attitude and eye rolling. \\n\\nOur drinks took more than ten minutes to reach our table (during which time we received chips and salsa, but no water) and my margarita was missing the sangria I had requested.

Or did they pass the restaurant down to maladjusted stepchildren?  Whomever it is, they've destroyed my favorite Austin Italian spot.  Recent remodeling (within the last few months) has obliterated the charm the restaurant used to have.  The small bar off the entrance used to be a cool, divey place to grab a beer or sip a cocktail while you wait for your table.  It was cozy, dimly lit and reminded me of bars in locales with less available real estate than Texas (i.e. NY, LA, SF). Bars where personality, rather than sq. footage, garner acclaim.  The stiffly pompadour'd bartender was a fixture, as though a perfectly cast character in their candlelit dinner theater.  Now the bar has been grossly and tastelessly expanded and the whole restaurant is dipped in LED and neon lighting.  It's like being inside of a headache.  They went from Godfather to Scarface and I couldn't be more disappointed.  This used to be where you'd find the most authentic Italian in Austin.  In fact, I was first directed to Reale's by a New York-Italian expat.  On my last visit I couldn't tell if the food had also lost a step or if the new decor just stunted my tastebuds.  We definitely weren't wowed as was the usual.  The bartender was noticeably absent.  As were his well crafted cocktails.  We had to send back both of our \\"house specialties\\" and trade them for beer/wine.  Perhaps we'll try them again on a night when one of the old crooners are scheduled to perform.

This was a typical greasy spoon, nothing special at all about the food, and frankly, it wasn't even very good. I ordered a cheese omelet with pork sausage. My partner ordered poached eggs on toast. You get to watch them cook the food in front of you, and everything is cooked on high heat because the chefs have about three minutes to prepare each dish. Shocking to watch, and Julia Child will tell you, \\"Never overcook an egg!\\" My omelet was greasy, overcooked on the outside, and the cheese inside (which was cheap processed cheese) was not even melted. The sausage was greasy and low quality meat. The bread wasn't even any good. The only thing decent was the Raos coffee (roasted in Amherst, MA) and it certainly wasn't worth an hour wait. I am never going back to this place. I found it absolutely absurd to stand in line this long for such a crappy meal. How this place got a reputation for good food is a complete mystery to me.

My friend and I split the Tuscany Crepe and Strawberry and Nutella Crepe with sides of Scrambled Eggs and Sausage. Both crepes were delicious. I would highly recommend the Tuscany Crepe if you're a fan of pesto flavor and don't mind a little extra oil.

I have only ordered here twice total, ever. The first time was over 6 months ago & I was not impressed. It was overpriced, didn't taste very good, was a bit greasier than your average takeout, & a few of the items were pretty skimpy. But even so, it was probably ~2.5 stars. It obviously wasn't so great that I went back again & again, but since it wasn't a complete disaster, it was worth trying again in the future to see if it got any better.\\n\\n2.) Fast forward to the future! The second time I ordered was this weekend. The guy on the phone was *EXTREMELY(!!)* rude, almost to the point where I felt I'd be physically harmed when I received my food... & so I canceled the whole order. They don't deserve my money or my business. Seriously. This level of rudeness I experienced, has NO place in the service industry, for ANY reason. & come on, I think we can all agree here. If you're having personal problems, you shouldn't take it out on the customer. If you have a problem with a customer's order, special request, location being outside of delivery range, tip amount, being out of an ordered item, etc. there are MUCH nicer ways to bring those issues up or resolve them in a civilized manner -- ways that could have ended with a happy customer who says thank you, a hefty tip, a higher rating, & continued business.

It's a cool place to visit at least once to get the whole Portland experience if you're not local. It's one of those kind of things where you go just to say you did. Their donuts are kind of a novelty item. The voodoo doll was creepily cute and the atmosphere was edgy.\\n\\nThe revolving display cases were fun to see. The menu above was kind of hard to read, and it was a little difficult to read signs in the display as it was revolving, so it was kind of overwhelming trying to pick a donut. As we walked out we realized that there was a menu outside on the wall that we totally missed, so that was the only con of walking right through the door because there's not a long line.

Sometimes I like them \\"cajunized\\" other times I just want them plain with some ketchup and ranch on the side to dunk them in.  The beer is ok, but I prefer the cider when we go.

However, if I was a Health Code Inspector, I would have to cite them for the following health code violations:\\n\\n1. Saw one server girl (with hair down her back) tie her hair back with her bare hands (no gloves worn by anyone) and then grab 3 sliced pizzas on plates and take to customers. She didn't wash her hands, sanitize, or anything; she just grabbed the pizza and took it to the customers. My family and I were sick to our stomachs. \\n\\n2. They place the individual sliced pizza's on a plate, across their arms, and walk them to the customers. There were times we witnessed slices of pizzas actually touching the skin on the arms of waiters carrying them out; some arms were harrier than others, but the pizzas still laid across them. I was amazed to see that no customer noticed this; if they did, they didn't care to indicate it...I know WE would have. That's the reason why we ordered whole \\"fresh\\" pizza from the oven. The only person touching our food was the cook. After it was boxed up and brought out to us, then we were the only ones to touch it. \\n\\n3. We saw one of the waiters wipe off the counter above the \\"ready made\\" pizzas with a rag. I'm sure that what ever was on that counter fell over onto those pizzas. There was no strategy put into preventing any contents from falling onto those pizzas; he just wiped the counter back and forth, and whatever was on that counter fell on top of those pizzas.\\n\\nAside from these violations, the individually sliced pizzas were reheated in the oven, so they were not fresh when customers ordered them. This is good to help decrease the wait time, but not at the expense of freshness and quality!\\n\\nI will take my business back to Home Slice, but I just won't order any \\"ready made\\" individually sliced pizzas. And I wouldn't recommend anyone to order any pizza unless it's made \\"fresh\\". These are certainly fixable violations. All it's going to take is for a customer, like me, to voice their displeasure with these unsanitary acts and \\"maybe\\" they will correct it(?)...hopefully!"},{"name":"Launderette","address":"2115 Holly St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I had to be in Austin for work and B joined me since he was on fall break. He found this place online and it was also suggested by a local bartender so we thought we'd check it out. I called ahead to see if they had room for 3 (joined by B's soccer buddy who was also in town) and was told that they don't take reservations. No problem, lots of restaurants run this way. I asked how long the wait would be for a group of 3 and was told that she really couldn't say because things change by the minute. Whatever. We decided to take our chances and were pleased when we walked in to see several empty tables. Smiles turned to confusion as the hostess told us that those tables were not available and that we'd need to wait at least 20 minutes. Wait- how can they not be available?? They are empty and you have a no reservation policy. I asked if we could sit at the bar instead- lots of empty seats there- and was told that they don't typically seat groups of 3 at the bar, so she would have to check. Fortunately someone behind the scenes realized that 3 paying costumers is better than none, so we were allowed to sit down.\\n\\nI love places that serve small, shareable plates since I get to try lot of different things. Just OK- the beet hummus w/ labneh- the cracker was not the right supporting character for the spread, and the tandoori prawns- overcooked.

Why? I think its proposed cuisine of Asian Southern fusion is misleading .. I think they do Southern well, and, when they say Asian, they're really saying Thai, and, yes, they do that well .. but in terms of melting those two cuisines together, it missed the mark IMO. We started with the lemongrass mussel .. very creamy with great hints of lemongrass. It was excellent to bath the mussel in this broth. Best thing I've had since moving to Atlanta, but the sentiment was not resounded in the latter half of our meal.. By the way, portions are HUGE. After having the mussels, we were practically full! However, because we had no idea how big the portions were, we also ordered the soft shell crab and the grouper. The seafood options on the menu def have a deep Thai influence but it wasn't any better than some of the standard Thai restaurants I've had in NYC. Meh. Again, portions were huge and I think more people were stunned by the presentation than flavor (who wouldn't want have their crabs served on a pineapple?). The seafood was deeply fried (perhaps that's the Southern twist?) but it was a little too much considering how curry based dishes are inherently heavy by itself so to add a fried meat was just too much. I wasn't particularly fond of the entrees.\\n\\nThe drinks, on the other hand, were BOMB. I forgot exactly what we ordered but I def felt their drinks had a great Southeast Asian twist to it with the incorporation of chili peppers, lemongrass, and ginger ..

I remember when everyone raved about chipotle (the peppers not the restaurant). Currently everyone is putting bacon into sweets (chocolate bacon? Bacon cookies?

The result is the Bacon Maple Bars that even Anthony Bourdain admits to as a guilty pleasure. \\n\\nYou know the combination on the Bacon Maple Bars marry the flavors of pancake, syrup and bacon. If you too feel like taking the matrimonial plunge, guess what, the owners of Voodoo Doughnut are Universal Life ministers and offer various wedding packages to seal a sweet deal. \\n\\nGuilty pleasures and odd-ball toppers (cereal anyone?) is what may get you to VooDoo once.

That may partially be my fault for dining @ the bar, but the host AND bartender presented that as an option so I feel like they bear some of the responsibility. Wait. Actually, WTF, why would it be my fault anyway?? Service is service, at the bar or a table. \\n\\nWe came in around 8:30 on a Friday, and as stated we were given the option of waiting for a table or eating at the bar, but since we were pretty hungry we thought the bar would be the best bet. I ordered a Ranch House lemonade, but the bartender came back a few minutes later to inform me they were out (of lemons? booze?? f'real?). I ordered a \\"red-headed stranger\\" instead, AKA a Bloody Mary + bacon strip/cheese cube/pepperoncini/olive appetizer (total 180, right?) and the BF got beer. So, my gussied up bloody mary was AWESOME. I probably could have eaten just that for dinner, but I wouldn't want to waste my talent for eating by not...eating. \\n\\nWe got our bartender's attention to order our food, but he kinda shoved off that responsibility to some other dude, maybe a manager of some sort? The manager was at least seemingly more interested in taking our order than the bartender, but he walked away before we were finished ordering! Then when we got him back over, he was like \\"Okay, are you done?\\" Um...done ordering? Yes I effing am, apparently. \\n\\nOur food came and it was pretty good. I got a texalina dog and the BF got waffle fries, mini corn dogs, and a plain dog with a \\"flapjacket\\" = corn-battered, all of which I obviously sampled. Here's the thing about places like this: they get all caught up in having the craziest, most exciting and over-the-top foods, but sometimes they lose sight of the whole point - a hot dog should be easily picked up and eaten with one's hands. I could not do that with my dawg. Yes, I ordered a \\"special\\" dog, but I was never told special = ridiculously large and unwieldy. I was also not given silverware, and heaven forbid I inconvenience the waiter for such a request! There were, at least, plenty of bar napkins.\\n\\nWhen we were done, the waiter asked if we wanted anything else for dessert (I noted the disdain in his voice) and we got our menus back. Forgive me for eavesdropping, but isn't that a little obligatory at the bar? The guy seated next to us must have had SOME kind of experience earlier, because the staff were bringing him drinks left and right, asking if he needed anything, and apologizing profusely. What could that be about, hmmmm?\\n\\nAnyway, YES, we did order dessert. You know why? Because this is America, and I'm entitled to obesity! I think it's in the Constitution. Something or other about twinkies, guns, and the pursuit of money, right? I got a rummy root beer, and BF got another beer and the ice cream sandwich. A few minutes later, the waiter comes back to inform us that there are no more ice cream sandwiches, which is BS, because instead we ordered the Frankencookie, which is a bacon cookie (same as in the ice cream sandwich) with ice cream (I'm pretty sure that's also a component of the ice cream sandwich). Well, anyway. Once again, my drink was great. It should probably have been illegal. The BF's cookie/ice cream was okay. It did come dusted in bacon bits, though, so perhaps I'm being too harsh. I just thought the cookie tasted much too strongly of baking soda. \\n\\nWhen the waiter came to take our plates away, he asked if we were \\"FINALLY finished,\\" to which we replied \\"YES, we are FIIIIINALLY done stuffing our faces, so snap snap and bring us our cheque, garcon!\\" Not really, but wouldn't that be awesome? \\n\\nThe bill ended up being $50, which wasn't so bad considering the two meal-drink monstrosities I ordered. But wait, what is this on my bill? I don't think I ordered a side of attitude. I really wish the waitstaff had been friendlier because I would feel much better about supporting them if I weren't made to feel as though I were imposing by ordering food.

Perfectly fried, crispy outside and juicy moist chicken breast inside. One of the best fried chicken I have ever had. The lobster mac and cheese was also good. We also tried the Crispy Beef which was delicious! The beef had a light crispy texture and so tender! I had my doubts about that dish because it sounded like a simple chinese dish, but I was so wrong. This dish was damn good! \\n\\nWe finished our dinner with a matcha pound cake with fresh strawberries, bananas and ice cream. I think there was a bourbon syrup on it as well. The presentation and taste were just perfect. The cake was perfectly moist. The other desserts looked good as well.

Try to go in the afternoon when it is slow...then you can walk around and take in all of the views.

We went here for dinner, and the place was nearly empty.  They serve their breakfast food all day, so if you want to avoid the wait, just go here for dinner, and have breakfast.  Problem solved!\\n\\nBut enough about the crowds.  I'm more interested in the food.\\n\\nI suggested this place because (a) I like Scandinavian food (there is a really awesome Scandinavian place here in Phoenix, and for some reason I feel the whole balance of the world would be off (or something) if there is not another as good), and (b) I really wanted a lamb burger.\\n\\nYes, they have lamb burgers.  That is reason enough to pay it a visit.  The only people who wouldn't find that appealing are vegetarians and unadventurous carnivores, and I have no need for either of those groups.  (I kid! Vegetarians are great: they help keep the price of meat down, after all.)\\n\\nThey recommend you get the lamb burger with chevre.  I recommend you follow their instructions.\\n\\nOthers in our party had the hamburg a la lindstrom (or something like that, probably a little more Swedish), the grilled cheese, and the daily lefse.  Those items were said to be good, although I don't think my siblings had quite the appreciation for the nuances of the food that I do, and just thought they were good, but overpriced, hamburger and grilled cheese.  This tells me that if you, the reader, do not care for nuance in your food, and just want to stuff your face, this might not be the place for you.\\n\\nWith my meal I had the Fever Tree Ginger Beer.  This was a pretty good ginger beer, a solid B, but not as spicy as some I have had.  Only comes in a 6oz. bottle, which is unfortunate.\\n\\nDinner portions are small.  You'll leave with room for dessert.  This makes perfect sense, considering Vikings would have had to avoid overeating so as to be able to pillage foreign villages swiftly and adeptly.\\n\\nI left here thinking this is an excellent restaurant, but not as good as my beloved Beaver Choice in Mesa, AZ.

It's the meats that get into a bit too much if you don't need to keep Kosher territory (which probably makes a lot of sense since I'm sure it's more work to do that with chickens and cows than it is with chickpeas). They cook everything to order and then you tell them what you want in the pita too. There's a lot to choose from: hummus, spicy sauce, pickled onions, cucumbers, lettuce, tomato, cabbage, eggplant, pickles. You can really pack stuff into that pita. There's definitely no need for sides. \\n\\nThey do have them, of course, including spicy fries. I don't know what this is but one day I will find out when I want to spend that much eating here. \\n\\nI know laffa is a type of flatbread, so I assume for $2 more it's a bigger sandwich.

Not only that, it has been voted 2012's Best New Restaurant of the Year in Esquire Magazine. It's also a seafood restaurant. I love seafood. So would this be my new favorite restaurant? Not really.\\n\\nDon't get me wrong, the food tastes good here. I tried their hush puppies, oyster loaf, fish and chips, brussels sprouts, basmati fried rice, and beets. \\n\\nTheir Hush Puppies was the bomb. They do it beignet style with powdered sugar all over the place. If you're not careful, you might get a bunch of powdered sugar on your clothes and look like a cocaine addict. I liked how they fried the hush puppies and loved the sweetness.\\n\\nThe Oyster Loaf tasted good. The oysters seemed fresh. I loved how they stuffed the tiny loaf bread with oysters. They breaded and fried the Oysters well. It's a great sandwich for lunch. It is a messy sandwich because the oysters were spilling out of the bun. \\n\\nI tried their Fish and Chips. It tasted okay. It seemed bland to me. Their vinegar aioli didn't give much flavor. I liked the tempura batter at least.  \\n\\nI liked the \\"Chips\\" it came with. It was hand pulled potatoes. They seemed to have grilled it somewhere since I could tasted the grilled flavor.\\n\\nFor the sides, I tried the basmati fried rice. I wasn't a fan. I didn't  like the flavors, and it didn't seem fried. I guess I was expecting a more Asian styled fried rice.\\n\\nThe brussels sprouts tasted good. It was one of my favorite sides. It had a nice flavor and cooked well.\\n\\nThe Beets tasted okay. I couldn't get much of the beet-y taste. Also, it had cream. The cream added a nice layer of flavor, but I couldn't enjoy it much because of my lactose intolerance. \\n\\nAs for the service, I got annoyed at my server. She assumed too much. \\n\\nFirst, she made it a point to serve the women first. Okay, that's fine. But it was annoying when she skipped over me multiple times just to serve the women first. I think she should just go in order of seating instead of having to do the whole, chivalrous, \\"ladies-first\\" act.  In fact, when we came in, she served all the women water and left my glass empty. Then she asked the women if they want anything else besides water to drink while my glass was still empty. \\n\\nAlso, it took her a long time to get our order. I didn't know she was waiting for our last party member, who never arrived, to show up. What was she waiting for? She could've at least come and ask if we wanted to order first. If we didn't say anything, she would have never served us because our last table companion never showed up. \\n\\nThen at the end, she assumed me and Angela M. were together even though we specified separate checks.  If we were together, I would've told her were were together. \\n\\nI'm laid back when it comes to service, but for some reason, this woman irked me. Besides the crappy service, the food didn't seem bad.

The hushpuppies were sprinkled with powdered sugar. I think they could have been a little more creative with the sweet/salty blend they were going for.\\nShe-Crab Soup - To die for! Creamy, fresh, not too fishy or sharp, but you could taste and see the crab. \\nSalmon toast - The salmon was fresh and thick, but it was nothing standout. I'd go for another more creative app.\\nSwordfish with porkbelly - The fish was tender and the garnishes balanced it well. I've had better porkbelly, but I was impressed with how tender the entire dish was.\\nMy friends seemed very pleased with the fish and chips. \\nMy mother adored the beet salad. \\nThe ceviche was the worst part of the meal.

One had salmon and enjoyed it, and one person had the pork chop.  Four of us had the veal: 2 medium and 2 medium rare.  All 4 were undercooked--which was why I asked for medium, just in case.  My veal was okay.  Not great for $55, not as good as the veal chop at The Capitol Grill, but still solid, with a tasty glaze/sauce.  The unlucky bunch who ordered medium rare didn't enjoy theirs.  Tough, cold to the touch and chewy.\\n\\nDeserts choices were again a limited, but what they offered were good.  Homemade ice cream (pistachio), chocolate fudge cake, etc.\\n\\nOverall, the experience and the food was good...but just okay for the cost.  The service was excellent, no arguments there, and what few mistakes there were, the staff quickly and happily remedied.  \\n\\nOur round table was positioned up front, near the front door/bar, but it wasn't excessively noisy.

The lobster bisque was more like bumped up tomato soup.. meh. \\n\\n2nd course..  Salads!!  Yes we have a hit here.   Mine was with a baked acorn squash under a bed of lovely greens and sweet bits.. the perfect mix.   Spouse had a blue cheese, nut, and green salad.. again.. a hit a perfect balance of texture and flavor on fresh veggies, hard to mess this up. \\n\\n3rd course..  Dinner.. I had the spaetzle and salmon dish.. it tasted fishy .. I hate half..   top Sirloin(i think.. might have been a different cut) perfectly seasoned before the demi glaze.. the glaze pushed it into over seasoned. meh\\n\\n4th course deserts..  I had the bread pudding and she had the chocolate tort.   Both very good, flavor excellent and balance.   My only regret was that the bread pudding didnt have a creame or float to give it something to absorb.  It wasn't dry just would have taken the entire dish to the next level.\\n\\nOverall I am definitely not running back for seconds.  I might go again in the spring/summer for the outdoor dining but with some many options in Portland, this one just didnt stand out for me.  \\n\\nlast note.. I thought the price was excellent and the portions more than adequate for a 4 course meal."},{"name":"Happy Valley Station Food Carts","address":"13551 SE 145th Ave","city":"Happy Valley","stars":"3.5","text":"I like the area, layout and selection.

French fries freshly cooked in hot oil normally come out piping hot.  The fact that they were damp and soggy makes us think that these dishes have been sitting out on a counter at room temperature for over 30 minutes.

I guess the real question I came away with from eating at grassfed is what does it see itself as? \\n\\nFirst, I want to make clear that the food at this place is great.  Long time fans of Ten Tables, i wouldnt expect anything less than awesome food at Grassfed, and that alone gets it 3 stars.  I ordered a bacon cheeseburger, fries, an adult milkshake (salted caramel), while my husband had the blue devil burger (his diet is currently limited). I paid an extra .25 for mayo, .50 for tomatoes- neither of which come with the burger. Lets tally that up, shall we?\\n\\nbacon cheeseburger ($9)\\nthe blue devil ($9)\\n+mayo (.25)\\n+tomatoes (.50)\\nfries ($4.00)\\n1 adult milkshake ($11) =\\n$37.20\\n\\n(keep in mind, 2 TTBurgers w sides = $28) \\n\\nThe burgers at GrassFed decent sized, though the TTBurgers are waaaaay bigger. My husband said that the blue devil was one of the best burger's he's ever eaten. All of the condiments (mustard, ketchup, a10 sauce) are homemade.  The ketchup tasted more like fruit jam to me, but my husband LOVED it. The fries looked overcooked, and weren't that appetizing.  I got the salted caramel milkshake. It was perfect. A nice, unique touch to this place. \\n\\nBut, a restaurant isn't just about the food, though, and unlike some (I'm sure faithful/diehard \\"JPers\\" who will give this place 5 stars no matter what), the quality of all aspects of a restaurant are important when reviewing. The thing about Grassfed is that I get the impression they want to provide quality food, but how do you do so and actually have good profit margins, especially since burgers are generally cheap staples, and still provide an awesome experience?   If you are going to charge me $4 for mediocre, forgettable fries, then the experience here better damn well make up for it.  Is this a fast food joint, or a restaurant? I've seen numerous people saying that the prices here suggest a nice night out, a \\"date night\\"- but lets be honest, if you are shelling out this much, you might want to consider going elsewhere.  Ten Tables, for example. \\n\\nPlaces for Improvement:\\n-Is this place a real restaurant or a to-go joint/fast food place? There isn't alot of room/space (and thats not the owner's fault), but as a result you are keenly aware of people staring through your brains to hurry up and move on out. If you know that your place is kind of small, why would you NOT have a to-go option?!?! (we were told by the staff that this place doesn't do 'togo').  Thats kinda the craziest part of this whole thing! Why wouldn't you maximize on that option considering your cramped space!?! So, this is a restaurant, right?\\n\\n-No bathroom. Ok, again, space issue, but since this place isn't a to-go joint and has restaurant prices, there should be a bathroom acccessible right? Can customers use the bathroom behind the counter? \\n\\n-Not too kid friendly. While there is a kids section on the menu, there isn't any kid friendly seating. I saw one woman with her daughter in her lap, and a family come in with infants- no idea how they plan on eating in bar stools with their infants... because, we know they are eating in, because, well, they can't do takeout. \\n\\n-Utensils.  Both my husband and I thought it was weird, the whole thing, because I guess you would expect when you are shelling out this much money that the utensils wouldn't be plastic. I guess it just made it unclear the kind of vibe they were/are going for. Also, knowing JPers are UBER tree huggers- I can't imagine how long you will be able to get away with plastic anything. \\n\\n\\nCompliments:\\n-Loved the wine/beer options, a nice alternative to your standard place. I thought it a bit peculiar, though, the couple next to us drinking wine in nice glasses while using plastic utensils to cut into their burger. The irony.\\n-Nice touch with the huge flat screen tv. \\n-Love the bar option.\\n-Open late. JP needs more of these places.\\n-The staff were super nice! And Stan was there always super friendly. The owner lady could smile, even just a little. Just a suggestion. :)\\n\\n\\nFinally, I want to make clear that I am leaving out the usual \\"opening day\\" mistakes- like the extremely long wait, late open despite advertising everywhere, and missing tomatoes, etc,etc-  those didn't affect this review. Anyway, I am sure that GF will figure out how to maximize their profits (because, lets face it- providing grass fed beef is a huge expense!) in a way thats less costly to their customers- and even if it remains costly, provide an atmosphere worth coming back to despite the $$. Otherwise, there's always the TT Burger.

Anywho, I had the beet ravioli app, the corvina entree and the creme br√ªl√©e dessert. The majority of my stars are for the app. Altho teeny-tiny, it was very innovative. If you order it, you'll see what I mean. (I'm embarrassed to admit how long I looked for the beets on the plate!) it didn't pack a punch of flavor or anything but it was def creative. The entree was good but salty. And the dessert was, well, creme br√ªl√©e...nothing special. I won't blame the MDM as a few people in our group ordered off the regular menu, and they had the same unspectacular experience with 2x the bill.

Well, one is very close to my workplace, so whenever the guys want to go for a quick lunch, unfortunately this restaurant's name comes up.

The basic structure is 4 local bands, doors at 9, shows start at 10.  So, be forewarned that if you are like me and sometimes feel a little too old to stay out to the bitter end of the evening, you should plan accordingly.  We got there in time for the second band at 11PM, and stayed through about half the set of the last band, that went on at 1AM.  \\n\\nI probably could have stayed until the end of the last set if: (1) the band that went on at midnight had not been so soul-zappingly awful and (2) if leaving downtown at 1:30 instead of after 2 were not the smartest thing you can do on the weekends.  Seriously, that little bit of a head-start makes all the difference in your escape from downtown.  \\n\\nAside from the one band that literally cleared the room through the course of their set, the one other detractor I saw was that the set-changes seemed really long.  Y'all need to practice for SXSW: andale!  Also, when we came in, everyone was standing really far from the stage and making it all crowded around the walkways and bar.  There are just musicians, they probably won't bite you, but I might body check you if you're unnecessarily blocking the path to the bar.\\n\\nI really enjoyed the two other bands we saw and appreciate that the cover charges at Frank are reasonable enough that you can go explore new bands without feeling too much of a pinch.   That's definitely one thing Emo's never quite figured out: people will go out more if you don't exploit them on cover charges.  Further, the acoustics and sound are so much better and it is generally a more interesting and classy  venue than Emo's with all kinds of beers, mixed drinks, clean bathrooms, and hot dogs."},{"name":"Le Muse Coffee Bar","address":"505 Wynnpage Dr","city":"Dripping Springs","stars":"5","text":"There is no way any words could adequately describe just how fantastic this latte was, but here goes my attempt...\\n\\nI had the Horchata latte.

Since that isn't available on yelp 4 stars it is. \\n\\nMy friend and I chose to dine here on a Saturday night, wanting to check the place out. They actually have a parking lot which was a pleasant surprise!  Lots of little old places on the east side don't have this luxury.  Inside and out the place is adorable. The decor and ambience are quite nice!\\nThe wait was over an hour that night. Not surprising since this is a trendy new place in East Austin. There were no seats out on the designated patio for waiting and cocktails but there was another side patio with a bench on it that we inquired about. There is no service on that side but we were told we were welcome to wait there. No big deal. That's what we decided to do. But first a stop at the bar! As we approached the bar the bartender quickly announced that the bar seating was reserved for dinner guests.  We had already been informed about this by the hostess so I found it a little off putting. He told us to get in line at the end of the bar to order drinks. There is a weird, shorter section of the bar on the left that apparently you must go to in order to get drink service! I have never seen anything like it. A few moments later we were stuck behind a mass of people who had already been served but weren't moving. Maybe the bartender felt bad, because he came out and apologized and took our drink order right there. Nice save! \\nOur drinks were delicious and the wait passed by quickly as we enjoyed them and chatted with a couple that had just arrived. The hostess came by a bit later and called the couple's name even though my friend and I had been there a while longer. She explained she couldn't find us earlier.....uh the place isn't that big and we had informed the host stand where we would be waiting. Disappointing. She had walked by several times previously while we were out there and collected other parties but never said our name! Luckily the couple was super sweet and wanted us to take the table first!  \\nOn to dinner. Our server was wonderful. She went over the menu, made recommendations,  and answered our questions graciously. The food was pretty stinking good as well. The beef carpaccio and the zucchini salad  were our distinct favorites, but everything we ordered was tasty! All of the dishes vary in size so we shared everything and were quite satisfied.

The brisket was juicy and not too fatty but not very flavorful.  The potatoes were full of garlic (yay!) and creamy, while the green beans tasted as if they were thrown in nicely salted water until al dente and then give a nice ice water bath before being nicely dressed.  I really liked them but as Husby said, how good can green beans be?  The pulled pork was also quite tender but was different than other places we have had it.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the worst part of the meal were the ribs.  Both were extremely dry and not smoky at all.

Open-faced sandwiches--I like those, too. Here you've got 10+ options, and they're all about $8. The ingredients are definitely exciting! Salmon, prosciutto, fig, brie, gruyere cheese, ...Lots of delicious things that you don't see everywhere in a lunch menu. \\n\\nI came here with my extended family and so I tried so many things (thank god my family was down for sharing)...everything was good. The tartine with brie and apricot preserve was my favorite.\\n\\nI must admit that the food was not that filling, and the tartines were mostly bread. They have espresso but it's simply OK.

The Kennedy School is an amazing spot to grab a bite, soak and spend the night. Here is a little recap of our recent stay in what is most possibly our new favorite Portland hotel.\\n\\nHotel: Okay, their website leaves much to be desired, and sometimes calling them isnt much better since they are often very busy and seem to be short handed at the front desk. However, if you are lucky enough and they have available rooms, BOOK IT NOW. They only have 57 rooms and they go quick. We stayed in Sally's room, which was HUGE, had 2 big chalk boards, a book shelf, a gorgeous big bead and lots of windows that look out onto bushes and trees which provide shade and privacy. I didnt even notice until the end of our stay, but there is no tv and that was alright by me! The bathroom was standard, nothing fancy, shower only and was very clean. Checking in and out was kind of a cluster f*ck since there were a ton of people trying to get into the hot spa when we were checking in, but I wont fault them for it. All of the staff was beyond nice...like almost too nice - ya know? But thats Portland friendly for ya and I'm totally into it. \\n\\nRestaurant /Bar:  Lots of good options, and great beer / drinks too. Large enough for a giant group, and not too busy that would make for a nice casual dinner with your sweetie. It's not overly romantic or anything and definitely a jeans and tshirt kind of vibe. What ever you do, try the pulled pork. OMG. We got a cocktail in the Honors Bar which is a tiny little closet of a room dark with sexy cocktails and a furnace making it a really cozy place to snuggle up and get a drink. \\n\\nSoaking Pool: This giant hot tub of salt water is a such a nice and refreshing way to start or end the day at McMenamins. It's open to public which is kinda weird, but we just waited until those hours were over : Non-hotel guests and minors with an adult, 10 a.m. 'til 8 p.m.  Hotel guests (over 21) daily, 8 a.m. 'til 10 p.m. \\n\\nGo to there!"},{"name":"Broder Caf√©","address":"2508 SE Clinton St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Broder was fantastic, my wife and I try and go to a different breakfast spot every Sunday.

I felt oddly out of place from the moment I walked in the door.  Not sure exactly what it was, maybe the overly proper fancily dressed waiters, or the fine linen on a breakfast table?  Maybe I just didn't expect so much class from a place I assumed would be going for a 1950's greaser diner feel. There seemed to be a lack of culture or anything that would identify the place as being unique, it felt like a breakfast place I had been to at least a hundred times in non-descript towns.\\nAnyway, weird vibes aside the food is quite good.  It reminds me of an upscale business class hotel brunch room fare, although much better.  I remember looking at the menu and feeling like the food was going to have to work very hard to justify its price, and it came super close.  The service was very proper, with our waitress always prompt on refilling our coffee and being available, but not overbearing.  I found the portion size to be perfect as I left feeling satisfied and full.  The quality of the ingredients was high, and the omelet/scramble thing I had didn't skimp on anything.\\nOverall the food was pretty high quality, but the scene kinda weirded me out so I probably won't be returning on my own.  However, this is a great place to take visiting parents who want a good breakfast, but can't handle all the culture a typical Portland spot will throw at you."},{"name":"Coast Seafood and Raw Bar - Buckhead","address":"111 W Paces Ferry Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Delicious and love the patio!

There is a drink menu, from which you can order.\\n\\nWe got there at about 9:20 and were lucky to beat the rush.  There were only 2 parties ahead of us.  The wait was barely 15 minutes.  However, people started bum rushing right after we came in the place, so had we come any later we would have been embroiled in a bar fight initiated by my hungry stomach.  The restaurant is tiny but the space is pretty well utilized.

Various notes online mention that there's a free parking lot next to the building, but that parking lot is for Valet. Valet is free though (but is anything really free?). There's also plenty of street parking nearby, just be careful to pay the meter where necessary! Next, you have to make a reservation IF you want to sit inside at a table.

I came for a Sunday brunch date, completely forgetting about Georgia's classy, 'dry' rule, aka no alcohol on Sunday. The bartender was amazingly entertaining, offering to make the best mixed virgin drinks. Oh well. We spent our drink money on the Lobster Wontons ($14), which only came with 3, but they were seriously worth every penny. The wontons are cooked perfectly - crispy on the outside with some berry juice over it to make it not toooo crispy. And you could truly taste the full flavor of the lobster. Next, we shared the Fried Chicken ($17), which comes on top of lobster mac and cheese, with a side of summer veggies. These sides are extremely nice and unexpected additions. I used to wonder why anyone would order fried chicken at restaurants. But this is so easy to eat, and it makes you feel like you're eating relatively nutritiously! It's a chicken breast, so you don't worry about the mess of a bone. \\n\\nService could have been faster, but other than that (and the points mentioned above), I can't say enough good things about this place. Yeah, I wish it were a little cheaper, and yeah, I wish you didn't have to worry about the pain of reservations. But hey, it's good, quality food, so I should expect that.  It's clean.

The presentation came on a long thin plate with a balsamic drizzle and superb Olive oil with beautiful thick slices of Mozzarella. I followed it up with a glass of super Tuscan and Pollo Scarpiolla (prob spelled wrong) that was excellent, and cooked perfect with peppers, capers, mushrooms and a white wine sauce. It was served with a side of pasta that while was just pasta, with it's olive oil and fresh Parmesan blanket, it just reached out ans yelled \\"feast on my carbness\\"!

It was a blast. The bomb! A gas & a blast, but mostly a gas bomb blast. I don't recommend it ugggghhh! LOL \\n\\nAnyhoo, most of it was meh not worth mentioning. There were some good things, a lot of ok things, a few really bad things & a whole lot of \\"not seasoned well enough\\" things. The only thing that wowed was the coffee. But, first things first. \\n\\nThe Neapolitan pizza at Pizzeria Locale was the best of the best of the crawl. \\n It's a cool tiny little space with a fabulous little wood fired brick pizza oven. Super fresh quality ingredients are used in everything. The salads were def the highlight :)' They were super fresh Yummyliciousness. Especially the octopus salad. \\nThe wine list has some excellent choices that pair nicely with all the menu items as well. \\n\\nHowever, the pizza was a different story. The pizza was like a super luxe puzzle that was put together super fast & then you realize some of the pieces are in backwards & upside down. It doesn't all add up bc it's not quite right. They don't cut it either. If you want your pizza cut, it's up to you & their butter knife to do the honors. I know this is how its served traditionally in Italy & Pizzeria Locale \\"local\\" is enforcing that old world tradition without apologies. In Boulder America. Yikes! :( \\n\\nThe dough was good but had way too much of a giant dough edge. It was center loaded to the point that the center was raw. I don't think the temperature of the oven was hot enough either. There was no char on the edges. The crust was thin but not as good as Olivella's Neapolitan crust in Dallas. \\n\\nIt had all the elements of being great, but some of the pieces were just not executed correctly. It could have just been the kitchen was in the weeds as it was super busy. The service was great & I would totally give it another go. \\n\\nIt might not ever beat Charlie Greens, owner of Olivella's Neapolitan pizza in Dallas, but with a few tweaks it would come in a well deserved second in the region. \\n\\nOverall, I think I will def be back in the near future armed with my handy pizza cutter for another go at this pie :)'"},{"name":"Home Slice Pizza","address":"1415 S Congress St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Very classic, yummy pizza.

Why? Because I will err on the side of the fact we had 23 people in the private room and its tough to serve 23 people. However, the fact that we had two servers that seemed to not really know who or what was going on, and the quality of the food (thinking about those fried oysters makes me want to puke right now), really brings this place down. \\n\\nFirst off, our tables were separated into 4-tops. We asked to have them pushed together, and had to wait 15 mins as they decided whether or not our party, in the PRIVATE ROOM, could push our tables together. \\n\\nNext up, oysters and shrimp cocktail platters. Messy presentation...oysters on top of other oysters, servered lukewarm raw. Sauces in a plastic containers....can we class it up a bit? \\n\\nFriend oysters and calamari. Calamari is pretty hard to f-up, so it was fine in that department. The fried oysters were slimy and briny...tasted like they hadn't really been washed out. \\n\\nMussels and some sort of baked seafood platter. Mussels were tiny tiny mussels, very little broth, and our server used her HANDS to plop down bread on top of it. HER BARE HANDS. After you've been cleaning off tables, serving beer....you use your bare hands? The baked seafood platter was really weird, and we pretty much avoided it. Not my cup of tea.\\n\\nCup of chowder. Okay this was REALLY GOOD. One of the top 3 chowders I've had in Boston.\\n\\nThen our orders, we had a variety of orders, so I can only speak for my filet mignon. I know, I know, who orders steak at seafood restaurants? In hindsight, I'm glad I did because of all the seafood we had before the main dish. Anyways, medium rare was actually legit medium rare, but the steak had ZERO seasoning, and way too much char. My buddies had sinew all over it, can you please strip your meat correctly? Oh yeah, the bernaise sauce tasted like melted butter with the texture of nacho cheese sauce. No idea what that sauce was doing. \\n\\nMany of us ordered beers or wine and waited 20 minutes to get them. Okay, albeit they gave us open bar during the four hours we had the private room, but seriously, can we get either 2 dedicated servers or maybe then some extra busboy/busgirls? \\n\\nDessert saved the night a bit, the cheesecake was delicious, and the lava chocolate cake is really really legit.\\n\\nBut seriously?

It's \\"stack-a-burger\\". It's certainly not the burgers you get at other Spike's. They are tiny - somewhere between a slider and a regular hamburger. They are also really greasy. The quality of meat seems on par with McDonald's (ie. really low). These are not the thick juicy burgers you get at other Spike's nor do they have the special Spike's sauce.\\n\\nAll of this said, Spike's is still the best for hot dogs (sorry Nathan's).

We flock there, and happily tweet away as we marvel at something shiny and new. But in our haste, we forget about the truly great, iconic restaurants that have graced Atlanta for many years. One such restaurant is Midtown's Mary Mac's Tea Room off Ponce de Leon (pronounced ponts-duh-lee-on) if you live in the south.\\n\\nBack in the 1940s, there were 16 tea rooms in Atlanta. Although not a place that served tea, these were a fancied up versions of a meat and three. They were centers for neighborhoods where families could go and enjoy good food in the company of friends. Today, Mary Mac's is the only tea room that remains in Atlanta.\\n\\nMary Mac's has had it's doors open for 65 years, serving up classic Southern food. Some of the servers have even been there for decades. John Ferrell bought the restaurant in 1994 and runs it with his partner, Hank Thompson. These are truly some of the nicest Southern gentlemen you could ever meet. No wonder Mary Mac's Tea Room has been patronized by celebrities like Richard Gere, Beyonce, the Dahli Lama and is a favorite of Paula Deen.\\n\\nI was recently invited to attend Mary Mac's 65th Anniversary and Book Release party. Mary Mac's cookbook not only includes 125 of their wonderful recipes, but staff pictures and anecdotes and the history of this fine establishment. Strolling into Mary Mac's, I couldn't believe there were already customers waiting for a table at 4 pm. But I guess it is no lie that they serve about 1,000 meals per day.\\n\\nAlthough servers walked around passing out samples of delicious goodies like tomato pie, squash casserole, and nibbles of other goodies, that was just a teaser. There was an entire buffet spread taking up one wall of the dining room just waiting to be pounced upon. So when John came over and asked me to start things off, I didn't hesitate and dove right in.\\n\\nTrue Southern favorites were on the list - fried okra, salmon cakes, fried shrimp, fried green tomatoes, fried chicken tenders, fried crawfish, ribs and much more. Perusing the recipes in the book, you'll notice whatever isn't fried probably contains cheese and butter (measurements in the stick variety) Healthy, this ain't. But it sure is good.\\n\\nAnd what is a Southern meal without Pecan Pie? Absolutely wonderful, but a little piece will do ya. Especially if you opt to have a piece of the Blackberry Jam Cake and delectable banana pudding as well, like I did."},{"name":"Taco Bell","address":"8300 NE Vancouver Plaza Dr","city":"Vancouver","stars":"2","text":"This location is crap.

The burger is technically a 4.5 - it's a tasty burger but isn't on that tippy-top tier of my favorite burgers ever - but hell why not round up? The crinkle-cut fries are fantastic and you should definitely order them."},{"name":"Hao-Q Asian Kitchen","address":"3742 Far W Blvd, Ste 113","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Finally a Pho delivery in my area!!!

We ordered the special they had on Sunday a Sangria and receive a order of bruschetta for free. The Sangria was alright not the best I've ever had. We split the Italian Sampler: Chicken Marsala or Chicken Franco a Stuffed Shell and Linguini for $18.95. We chose the Chicken Franco. She mentioned there was a $3 extra charge for us to spit our meal and that was fine with us. We waited a long time for our meal, the waitress never came by and we finally had to ask the hostess to get her and we waited another 10 minutes and when our waitress came she had our meal. They didn't spit our meal so she said she wouldn't charge the $3.00. The Chicken Franco was cold and had such a bland strange flavor to it my husband and I hardly ate a bite. We waited for her to come back to check on us and she never did. Finally she showed up and we told her we did not like our meal it was cold and bland, so she took both plates away and said she would find out what she can do, never offered us a replacement meal but then she came back with the bill and said she would charge us half off the price for the Italian Sampler. We told her we should get it for free but she said no thats all she could do. We didn't like it, didn't eat it but we have to pay for half. We told her we will never be back again. The manager wouldn't come out to even talk to us. We informed her the table next to us also had problems with their meal and we watched another table send their food back.

My husband ordered ranch dressing to go with his wings, and it tasted very sour, as if it had gone bad.  We could barely get the waitress to pay attention to us at all, and couldn't even get a refill on our drinks during the meal, but had to finally ask for to go cups as we were leaving just to have something to finish washing down our food.

The food came quick. But for 16, I was a tad disappointed with the scallops since there were only two decent sized scallops with some sliced cantaloupe.

The scallops were cooked perfectly but again, I've had similar for less.\\n\\nOnwards to the liver...I swear, liver is delicious when cooked right...but it wasn't here. Parts of the outside was overlooked and tough and parts of the inside was a tad too undercook for me. I can do rare foie gras but undercooked chicken throws me off.

He dropped the dog on the floor with only a couple bites left to do, but we still ordered him another. I didn't expect him to finish the second. I really didn't. Instead, I had the pleasure of watching him full on MAKE OUT with his hot dog before he ate every single bite. Let's just say he was satisfied. \\nThe plain dog was only $3.  Very fair for one of the best I've ever tasted. Yes, the house made custom sausages are a bit more expensive, but it's easy to argue, based on the quality and freshness of ingredients, that it's worth it.\\nOne odd note - the Coke? The best I've ever had. I always steal a sip or two of my husband's soda, and I was surprised by how yummy his soda was. I can't really say why, but the Coke was zingier and brighter than I'm used to. Clean lines, fresh syrup, and the right blend of CO2 I guess. \\nAs a true lover of anything I can put mustard on, I'm sure we'll be back. The spouse and I are thinking this would be a good date night place, and I cannot wait to try their specialty drinks."},{"name":"Panahar - Bangladeshi Place","address":"3375 Buford Hwy NE, Ste 1060","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I really enjoyed my vegetarian dish.

When I asked for a refund he told me I had to call grub hub to get my money back since I ordered thru them. I called grub hub and they tried but he then got on the phone with him and he refused to grant the refund. There's NOTHING on their menu that says all the steak is dripping in BBQ sauce. Nobody, has ever ordered a caesar salad with a side of BBQ sauce for a reason - it would taste disgusting. So I was forced to drive all the way down to the place and demand my money in person.

I REALLY liked the duck sausage I had one time, but I don't think it's a regular item. We came for lunch on a Sunday (yesterday) before heading to a double-feature at the Paramount, and found out that on Sundays it is brunch only, no hot dogs available. OK, try something new! I'm game.\\n\\nI went for the chicken and waffles (bacon waffles!) and specified thigh and leg (choices were thigh and leg or a breast). My bf went for the Fourtastic and chose jackelope sausages, corn pudding, pastry, and fruit.\\n\\nWhen our food arrived, two problems were immediately apparent. First, they were apparently out of silverware, and weren't able to bring us any for about 10 minutes, while our food went cold. I also noticed that my chicken was white meat (I know it's healthier, but I just don't LIKE it). So I pointed this out to the person who brought the food, and he said \\"I can't tell, it's breaded, so all looks the same.\\" I said \\"OK, you point to the drumstick on my plate.\\" He said he'd take it back if I wanted. I did. I waited for awhile, and my plate came back LONG before the silverware arrived. Of the 3 chunks of meat on my plate originally, two of them remained, with one chunk traded out for a chunk of thigh meat and a drumstick added. I pointed out to my waiter when he came to check that more than half the meat was STILL wrong, and he made a face and offered to take it back again, but I'm no dummy. I know what they do to food sent back TWICE. No thank you. However, even the dark meat was almost too dry to swallow, the white meat was impossible. We had to leave it behind (my bf actually choked on it, with his esophagus issues).\\n\\nThe waffles were ok, nothing special. A little on the soggy side for me, but they were fine. The corn pudding was pretty good (different than I've had before), and the jackelope sausage was pretty good. Not outstanding, but pretty good. The fruit was somewhat wilted looking melon and pineapple bits, not quite the level of canned, but looked like they'd been waiting around awhile. We never tried the pastry, just brought it home, so I can't speak to it. I have hopes.\\n\\nI feel bad writing a poor review of a place I normally like, but if yesterday had been my first visit, I'd never go back. I mean - no SILVERWARE in the whole place while our food sat and got cold? Not being able to get the food right even after sending it back once? I shouldn't have to send food back twice. And the waiter saw that I just left the meat on my plate, and made no adjustment to the bill. I mean, everyone knows you can't send food back twice. Not without getting something gross added to it. Ick. And it's not like the prices are low-low. I paid about $9 for basically a waffle and a chicken leg, which is all I was able to eat. The Fourtastic was $11, so not cheap either.\\n\\nI think we'll stick to weekdays from now on.  I'm not sure I'd want to spend the dough for a mediocre brunch with bad service.

What I think was a rip off was their main dishes. For example I ordered the mahi mahi, all by itself it cost $26.  It was simple dressed with a lemon and parsley. That's it. Yes it was good and fresh, cooked to perfection. But really for $26.00 they can't add a vegetable or starch.

Even though the combination was satisfying, I thought it would be better if it were bits. On the other hand, the employee's favorite which was the Oregon Cream was real tasty. I liked the chocolate glaze on the outside with the light cream on the inside. However, the two random dots toward the edge of that donut was a bit odd for me and would be better if it was decorated more.\\n\\nOverall, be aware that the donut shop you're about to enter is deep in the hood... Bring pepper spray or someone who has kick ass self-defense skills with you to wait line. Other than that, this shop is just another one of those overrated places where you can find some better quality donuts at your local grocery store."},{"name":"Two Urban Licks","address":"820 Ralph McGill Blvd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Really a 2.4 star because the company I had and the reason we were here made me overlook the things that were not up to par. But on a good nite, it could be a 3 star\\n\\nI wish I could have gone here before it became the overpacked, loud venue it is now...because I;ve heard of it...jus never made it.\\n\\nSo to start at the beginning is the best way to go....\\n\\nValet, major fail IMO...it took me 10 minutes to enter the parking lot and pull around the ramp to where someone finally handed me a valet ticket.\\n\\nMy friend called to make reservations and they told her, that they had over 600 reservations for Saturday, and there was no way for us to get in before 9pm.  We were all (5) there at 9pm and didnt get seated til about 9:30ish....We went to the bar, while we waited and was told we couldnt start a tab because the bar would be closing out soon.  \\n\\nIf nothing else I could have eaten the salmon chips all nite with a bottle of wine. We ordered two servings.  We also had the raw oysters, which didnt taste as fresh as I thought they should, the dippin sauce that came with it was spicy...just the way I like it and the calamari was delicious.\\n\\nWe had two servers, and the first one was honest when he said the other was the harder workin of the two.  He was correct, as server 1 damn near spent about a half hour at our table chatting.  Personally when I go out to dinner, I prefer the conversation of my dinner companions and not my server....I know some people may like this extra attention, but not me.  \\n\\nI ordered a mini of wine (which equates to 3 glasses), I didnt receive it but it somehow ended up on my check at the end of the nite.\\n\\n3 of us order the short rib, and the only thing I could think when it came to the table is that Fred Flintstone woulda be proud! Tender, already pulled from the bone.  Everyone has raved on here about the mac and cheese.  I've had much better...right in my own kitchen.    These were huge, and I had filled up on salmon chips, oysters and calamari, so I ended up taking half of my meal to go.\\n\\nAnother had the scallops and grits....she enjoyed the grits, but said the scallops were too salty, and the other person ordered the empanadas and toquitos(sp)-she had to request sour cream 3 times only to have one person come back and say there were out of sour cream, and another person to bring her a dish of sour cream after tellin her the chef found it.\\n\\nWhen the time came to leave, I do appreciate that resturants will now do seperate checks, but most times your check comes back wrong.  Out of the four checks at our table....three of them were wrong....so we sent them back....and when our server brought them back he spent another 15 minutes tellin us about how the servers have to tip the bar and the tableclearerguys, how people will tip $3 on a $100 tab, and how since Oprah said she doesnt tip on opening wine...dat most customers dont anymore either.  I took this as primmin the pump for a bigger tip, when in all actuality it made me shrink my portion of the tip.  Finally after 10 mins of him still talking.....I asked one of my dinner companions if they could let me out of our \\"booth\\" so, I could go and get in the valet line.....he finally realzied that one of us was ready to go and the others were to polite too say so.  I gathered everyone valet tab, left a $5 tip on my $48 dinner and headed for the valet.\\n\\nWent out to the valet, spent 5 minutes before somone was available to take my valet ticket, and another 5 minutes before our cars were brought around.\\n\\nDurning dinner, I did inquire about brunch...as I want to try those salmon chips again in the future....and was told they do brunch twice a year, Easter and Mothers' Day.  Also, that the owner does an employee appreciation day on Superbowl Sunday and that the roasted pig that was on the roasting pit heads was for the employees to enjoy during the game.  Dats real nice of the resturant to do that."},{"name":"Grindhouse Killer Burgers","address":"1842 Piedmont Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Burger heaven!!!

It was fine -- boring, but fine.  Our family of four decided to give Hao-Q a try a couple of weeks ago.  While we have two kids in elementary and middle school, we are pretty experienced and adventurous fans of asian food -- all kinds of pho, squid dishes, etc.\\n\\nWe loved the place.  Everything was fresh.  My wife and daughter shared a very simple american chinese dish of lemon chicken (not adventurous at all, but was what they were in the mood for) -- it was clearly prepared to order, and was very tasty.  My son got the seafood vermicelli bowl, and while it wasn't in the traditional vietnamese style, it was VERY good.  Lots of ginger and other clean flavors, and plenty of seafood.  As my son ate all the squid out of it, our waitress smiled and told us that next time, we should just order it with all squid, and they'd be happy to prepare it that way.\\n\\nI went out on a limb, and got something I'd never gotten before: Vietnamese Hot & Sour Tamarind Soup (Canh Chua).  Wow.  A perfect sweet/savory taste, with incredible fresh veggies, and tender shredded chicken.  Everyone at the table was able to eat off of the huge bowl.  This will be a go-to dish, especially in cold weather.\\n\\nThe staff was very friendly, very accomodating to our family, and even addressed our kids by their names as soon as they heard us say them.  This is a good neighborhood place that deserves your business.  As for people who complain because they ordered something and realized that they got \\"out-Whataburgered\\" by someone else's order at their table. . . . seriously?  My wife realized that my soup was the star of the table -- I guess she should have rejected her lemon chicken, demanded that the restaurant eat the cost, and bring her a bowl of canh chua instead.  Yeah, that makes sense.  The customer is NOT always right -- particularly when the customer says \\"hey, it's not your fault, you didn't do anything wrong -- but give me some free food.\\"  It's a business.  If both parties treat each other well, it will be a good transaction.  We had no problems when we went -- to the contrary, we were treated very well, and expect to be treated well the next time we go as well.

This is a very cute little place in the highly active south 1st street scene.  if you are not watching out for it, you will miss it ..so pay attention.  Very nicely done inside with quaint lace on the windows and a decor that manages to evoke images of a bygone era, yet with a modern flair.\\n\\nThis recent trip did the Sunday 4 course pre-fixe.  Knowing that the portions are quite tiny, I ordered the naan as an app before the food started.  Got a strange look from my favorite dining companion, but all became clearer as the meal progressed. The naan itself was a good flatbread, but if I was served a naan like this in an Indian place, I would sling it back in a heartbeat.  But it was tasty, and a nice accompaniment for the intensly flavored leek dip it came with.  First courses was a charred tomato salad on rye with a whey sorbet. This whole thing was genius! The whey melted slightly infusing the whole dish with a very pleasant tanginess and with the beautiful heirloom tomatoes, basil and perfectly grilled rye, this was a fantastic opening salvo and left you looking forward to the rest of the meal with great anticipation!  Alas, that was not to be so.\\n\\nSecond course was a hodge podge of stuff: charred okra, chana daal, corn, pork cheek confit, tarragon, pork tongue.  This was an utter failure! If you managed to get the right combination of flavors on your fork, it was pretty good.  But you really had to work hard to get things right, which was not fun.  I don't think I had any pork tongue on my plate and the pork cheek was somehow rendered dry (a herculean task if you ask me!).  Main course was qual on chinese eggplant with green mole. A very simply presented dish with half a quail (seriously...this is as small bird, I think they could throw the whole bird at you and not hurt your appetite...this bird is small enough that an anorexic model would munch on it and ask for more....) which was perfectly grilled and worked well with the eggplant.  The mole itself was a very strong dish and not a Mexican mole by any means of imagination. This was very reminiscent of an Indian dish called Sambar that is served a lot in south indian restaurants.  Strong flavors of cumin, coriander and fenugreek all deeply roasted permeated the sauce and it really worked well with the eggplant and quail in tiny quantities.  \\n\\nDessert was chocolate pot de creme with roasted peaches.  This was not a fun end to the meal. My first sight of this was a pale almost light milk chocolate colored dessert that looked pretty with the peaches on top, but the problem was having peaches which were too tart and just did not go well with this dish. The pot de creme itself had a bouncy quality...almost like they added a touch of gelatin to it and just not chocolately enough to be called that.  They had done something interesting with it by adding a touch of Thai basil, which sounds bizarre but added an interesting floral element to the dish, but not enough to make me want to eat it.  What I also found interesting was that the dessert was half eaten, yet no comment from the waitress (who was pretty good) or anyone else about a half eaten plate going back.  \\n\\nThe whole thing was a bit to precious and when the flavors are not spot on...its a problem.  i was tempted to do a two star review, but they do get some points for some dishes being really spot on, this time and a previous time and some creative elements to the cooking.

But I think that they're competing on that same level of class, attention to quality ingredients, and an atmosphere that is quaint yet sophisticated, so that I must compare the two. And The Backspace, while definitely wonderful, falls a little shy of the standard in their league. \\n\\nAt first, I took great issue with how hard it was to find. Now that I know the secret (The Backspace is literally just the back. space. of Parkside) so I know to pull up along Parkside on San Jaq and just valet - or park in the paid bank lot directly across the street to save a few bucks. I expressed to the server that I was a tad perturbed by their inconspicuousness and that I even questioned if I had, in fact, arrived at the front door to enter, the restaurant is THAT unassuming. But he put it into great perspective right quick: \\n\\"We're pretty much on Dirty Sixth, but we're a restaurant - a nice one - not a bar. We don't want to be easily found and accessible to just roam into.\\" \\n\\nI like that. I appreciate the air of exclusivity that \\"We want people to come here on purpose; to know that this is where they're having dinner before they show up. We don't want to be an accident in anyone's evening.\\" Also, the hidden element may help it keep its lure and charm longer than most instantly popular new restaurants in Austin. \\n\\nNow - the service was very relaxed and subdued. I liked our server - he did a great job. But I would have liked a tad more promptness and being checked on a few more times. If the tabs gonna be 50 bucks for two people and one mini human to just eat pizza, I kind of want to be doted on a bit more. Regardless, the service wasn't \\"bad\\" by any means. \\n\\nThe menu is very concise and likely is seasonal. We had the meatball starter which was a mixture including lamb with a hint of mint, the slightest bit of heat and a wonderful robust marinara sauce. The portion is perfect for two people to split. \\n\\nOur pies were the Pepperoni and the Mushroom (which has capers) and both were very very good. \\n\\nThe dough was a bit too thin / flimsy for my taste and the toppings, which were delicious and thoughtfully combined, slid right off unless you folded your slice. That's fine with me. But, as I said, in comparison to Pieous' selection, creativity, crust and taste, even though this pizza is light years better than 90% of what you can get in Austin, it's not quite up to par with what I want on Classy Pizza Night. \\n\\nThe interior is intimate and very small; Tables are sandwiched next to each other. Again, this is part of the charm. But the menu does let you know that since they have limited seating, they want  you to be courteous to other customers and limit your visit to an hour. I very much dislike when I'm instantly told that my business is only good for an hour and they're so worried about turning over tables that they'll PRINT it on your menu before you've started your meal. \\n\\nDo I think you should give them a try? Sure! The pizza is elevated, the space itself is inviting. Will I make it a point to come back soon? Well, I won't go out of my way - but I know I'd enjoy myself and my meal just fine next time I do stop in."},{"name":"Backlot Express","address":"351 S Studio Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Hollywood Studios has always suffered from a lack of good quick service dining, and Backlot Express is no exception.

So why not have it in the (allegedly) oldest restaurant in America? Situated near North Station, and housed in a gorgeously quirky building which is a perfect example of New England colonial architecture, the Union Oyster House is a bit of a tourist trap but has enough charm situated within its four walls to more than make up for it.\\n\\n\\n We came here on a Wednesday afternoon to shield ourselves from the bitter winds coming off the bay and were immediately charmed by the place. The booths were snug and intimate, the service swift and polite and the food relatively decent. And huge.\\n\\n\\n The ubiquitous bowls of Clam Chowder were warm and packed to the gills with warm creamy goodness. They were also served with a huge hunk of cornbread - a food stuff which is arguably more dessert than bread - which was just the thing for mopping up any leftovers. Then, because me and the Mister had eyes bigger than our bellies, we decided to opt for a sandwich each. And boy oh boy, were they some sandwiches.\\n\\n\\n I went for the fried oyster which resembled the Oyster Po'Boys which you usually find in New Orleans. It wasn't so much a sandwich as a stomach busting monster made of fish and breadcrumbs. I could only manage half of it before admitting defeat and sucking forlornly on the world's largest dill pickle. My fella didn't even manage a quarter of his crabcake. Whilst they were both delicious, they were obviously geared to people who carry a spare stomach around in their handbag. Or just have hollow legs. Not even the delicious pints of Sam Adams Winter Ale that we slurped down could ease any of the huge foodie pressure. In the end, all we could do was lie back in the booths and curse our puny European appetites.\\n\\n\\n Union Oyster House might not serve up the best seafood in Boston. But it's cute, quaint and very very cosy - and just the place to duck into if you're suffering from a bit of windchill. Personally, I didn't find it too expensive, but then again, your mileage (and your wallet size) may vary. And, after all, it's not every day that you'll get to eat in America's oldest restaurant.

Not that there was anything wrong with the fried, I just found more flavor with the grilled. Its a very thin breast of chicken, but for an inexpensive restaurant, it's expected.

These portions will take you well into the next day's left overs.  But everyone knows, there is nothing better than cold fried chicken for lunch (at least, I think so anyway).

As usual, my husband and I shared a little and he gave me his wing, one of his \\"french fries\\" and he took one of my fried green tomatoes.  Let me preface the term \\"french fries\\".  These \\"french fries\\" are about 1/5th of a potato.  This isn't a complaint, but I strongly suggest you see what I mean for yourself.  The fried green tomatoes are the most tender ones I've had yet without the excess tomato juice rendering the breading soggy.

The buttermilk chicken breast is everything chicken should be: moist inner, crunchy outer. It's crowded for Sunday brunch as any great place would be. Go ahead and wait! It's worth it."},{"name":"River Bar","address":"661 Assembly Row","city":"Somerville","stars":"3","text":"I didn't even notice this place the last few times I've been at Assembly, but I'm glad I did last night.  Really cool spot.  Outdoor patio, fire pits, etc.  Really cool atmosphere.  I bet the view of the river would be great if snowbanks weren't taller than me at this point.  \\n\\nDidn't have any food, but drink list was interesting and service was great.  Our waitress said she was a bad influence, and I am inclined to agree... I had a pretty good buzz after I left.\\n\\nStarted with the mulled wine, was very good.  Not too strong but had a great flavor profile.  Wine list overall is decent, and there were a lot of interesting cocktails that I can't wait to come back and try."},{"name":"J Liu Restaurant & Bar","address":"6880 N High St","city":"Worthington","stars":"3","text":"I have never had a pleasant experience here. \\n\\nHot tip: Go down the street & eat/drink at Whitney House or the Worthington Inn instead."},{"name":"Santouka Harvard Square","address":"1 Bow St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"I had their spicy miso combo with a bowl of rice topped with salmon. Both were very flavorful and good! My table shared an order of takoyaki & an order of gyoja, and both were very good. There was a long wait (~45 mins on a weeknight) but the weather was nice so we just walked around Harvard Square. They notify you several mins before your table is ready and you can track your waiting position on your phone."},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"SCREW the maple bacon bar!

I must say, they have some of the best and exotic donuts I have ever tried. I usually don't skout out for donuts, but this place is definitely a must when you're in Portland. We ordered half a dozen of donuts that included the big texas, oreo donut, pb and chocolate, cock and balls and their famous bacon maple. Definitely go here if you're a tourist and want to taste something that will blow your mind away ;)"},{"name":"The Ocoee Taco Company","address":"40 Taylor St","city":"Ocoee","stars":"4.5","text":"The best authentic tacos around!Everything on the menu is customizable and easy to understand.
