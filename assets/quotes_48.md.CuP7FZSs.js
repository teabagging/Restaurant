But since I can't and have to either round up or down, I'm rounding it up based on the restaurant offering a $30 prix fixe menu on Wednesdays (regular price $42). \\n\\nHaving said that, this review is based on my experience ordering a la carte. So portion sizes might be different if you order from their fixed menu, as I know that their matcha tart would be served in different sizes.\\n\\nLo Hay Salad ($18)\\nI suppose the things that made this $18 are the few pieces of smoked salmon and the number of different veggies used? There were carrots, cucumbers, daikons, taros, crispy vermicelli, peanuts, beets, etc. Visually appealing but the taste was pretty average to me. So consider everything as a whole I'm giving this 3/5. \\n\\nBelly-to-Belly ($12)\\nBraised and smoked pork belly - sweet and salty like the ones I had at Japanese Izakayas. Meat was tender enough and flavour was good. I just wished there was a bit more sauce. As there wasn't enough after cutting the square piece of meat to share and some of the lean portion tasted dry without the sauce to mask it. 4/5\\n\\nUni-versal Pasta ($13) and Triple XO Prawn Star ($12)\\nWe ordered the squid ink pasta and the prawns separately but was recommended to combine it into one bowl. I loved the sea urchin cream and egg yolk on the pasta and would come back for more. Highly recommend the pasta. 5/5\\n\\nIron Man ($16)\\nGrilled flat iron steak. Another item I would order again. Steak was cooked just right. I had a slice of it without any sauces and it was good enough by itself. I didn't get to eat the rest of the steak but tried some of the mushrooms that were left in the skillet. By that time the truffle herbed butter had melted into the mushroom sauce and every bite of it was full of deliciousness. 5/5 \\n\\nBuried Treasure ($9)\\nMixed of veggies - kale, brussels sprouts, cauliflower, broccoli, mandarin orange, etc. This was not bad. I liked how it was braised and seasoned. Pretty interesting to find mandarin oranges buried in a treasure of cooked vegetables. 4/5\\n\\nLuv U So Matcha ($11)\\nMatcha cheese tart. I liked that it was served warm and the matcha flavour was enhanced this way. So the flavour was there. I feel guilty for wanting an even stronger flavour as that'd be like asking Nestle Canada to replace the Canadian version green tea Kit-Kat with the ones offered in Japan. 5/5  \\n\\nAmoussing End ($11)\\nWhite chocolate mousse (or so I thought). This was the most disappointing item on their menu. As the name implies, I thought white chocolate \\"mousse\\" was this dessert's main item. It was also the first ingredient listed on their menu. But what I got were 3 quarter-sized dollops of mousse. Even with 5 triangular bites of ginger basil sponge cakes that were about the size of a loonie, I don't understand how they justify charging $11 for this. If it's the cost and time spent on making it (since there were quite a few items on the plate as garnishments - ie. ginger basil sponge cake, lemon curd, pumpkin seed praline, meringue), I think something's gotta give. 1/5  \\n\\n(Update: I was told that the dollops of white chocolate mousse would now be bigger in sizes so it won't be overshadowed by the sponge cakes.)\\n\\nService was mostly good and they refilled glasses pretty quickly.

I am insanely jealous that you have such easy access to Cafe Brioso. After trying them not once, but twice in one day, I can say with 100% certainty that this is my favorite coffee shop in Columbus (at least for now).\\n\\nMy first brush with Cafe Brioso was with their house-made Chai Latte. Nothing picks up my spirits when I'm down quite like a Chai Latte, and the one served at Cafe Brioso is heavenly. That it is made in-house and doesn't come out of a box really is a great selling point. Later on in the day, I returned to Cafe Brioso to try something stronger.\\n\\nI was either attended to by the owner or a very knowledge staff member, because I was given a small verbal tour on the way lattes are made. Originally I had asked if it was possible to order my latte over ice, to which I was told \\"Yes, but it won't taste as good\\". And also that they serve their lattes at a drinkable temperature so that it wouldn't be scalding hot. I took the advice and ordered a small hot Maple Syrup Latte. And to my not-so-surprise, the Maple Syrup comes from Ohio! Next, I asked if I could have my latte with skim milk, as I'm lactose intolerant. \\"No worries about the milk\\", the guy behind the counter said. The milk comes from a small dairy farm or creamery or something along those lines. Something about how the way it's pasteurized make the milk easier for the stomach to handle.\\n\\nI put my faith and my stomach in the hands of the guy behind the counter and ordered my latte with whole milk. Much to my surprise (and relief), my stomach was unmoved by the whole milk and my latte was much tastier than one made with skim.\\n\\nThe staff and product at Cafe Brioso is above and beyond any coffee shop I've experienced in Columbus.

More of a bar than a restaurant, the food is top notch Gastropub items with a touch of southern flair. The usual suspects are to be found on the menu along with some more unique offerings such as the Pork Belly Tacos, Poutine with Hand-cut Fries, Fried Green Tomatoes, Shrimp and Grits, and Short Ribs. Great drink specials, with many craft brews and innovative cocktails available.\\n\\nTHE FOOD\\n\\nI've done a business lunch here four times now. All four times my guests were very impressed with the fish sandwich, and all four times I left saying, \\"Damn I think this is the best burger in downtown Orlando\\".  I don't know if the secret ingredient is love, but when I told them to let the chef know I think this is the best burger downtown, they told me she said \\"tell him I love you\\".  Keep making burgers this good and even if something better comes along, I will always love you like a Whitney Houston song. I plan on bringing a lot more love and business lunches to this location.\\n\\nSo before I get too over dramatic with this review, back to The Real McCoy Burger ($12). It's made from a combination of brisket and short ribs, with aged cheddar, smoky bacon, and house made pickles on a Cuban kaiser bun.  Why do I love it so much? Whatever they do it's the only burger I can think of that I would describe as tasting rich. The sear on the burger along with the bacon adds such a deep layer of Caramelization to the overall flavor of the burger. It's my favorite thing about it. The aged cheddar is in perfect proportion and compliments the patty blend and bacon perfectly. The bun is nice and soft on the outside and crisp enough on the inside to hold it all together nicely. The fries are light and airy. I've upgraded to them instead of chips on each visit.\\n\\n4 times visiting, 4 times ordering The Real McCoy Burger. I want to try the short ribs, and pork belly tacos but so far the burger has been too good to pass up. I wanted to test this for consistency. It was a little sloppy on the third visit, but even that was still pretty damn good. No fluke here, it is The Real McCoy.\\n\\nThey always recommend the fish sandwich if you're not sure what to order. All four visits I was joined by a different person who went with the suggestion and loved it. I can't really describe it since I've yet to order it, but each time it has been made with blackened Mahi-mahi. It's seasonal so the fish they use can vary.\\n\\nTHE LOCATION\\n\\nPerfect Spot for lunch. Seating is limited but I've had no waits for a table yet. Each of my guests has been surprised when I pick this spot for lunch because in their mind it's a bar not really a restaurant. It's located right or the corner of Orange Ave and Pine St across from Sak Comedy Lab and City Arts Factory. It's the pay to park section of downtown but there are plenty of garages that are a short walk from this location.\\n\\nWith the brick wall exterior and interior, it does feel more like a bar then a restaurant. They allow you to grab a seat wherever you like and most of the tables are small. Drink Specials are posted, and many craft brews that they sell by the bottle and can are on display. If you enjoy craft cocktails they have a lot of originality on their drinks menu such as the Guavarita, Smoked Tequlia Old Fashioned, Caramel Old Fashioned, and the Mint Cocoa Julep. I plan to try each of them in the near future. Looking forward to some happy hour trips here soon.\\n\\nTHE SERVICE\\n\\nThe employees have a great enthusiasm about the menu offerings and have always treated myself and my guests very kindly with prompt service. As I mentioned earlier, I let them know to tell the chef this is \\"the best burger downtown\\" and I got an \\"I love you\\", not a simple \\"thanks\\" or a \\"why not best in Orlando\\", etc. If you're not feeling the love here, then it's probably not worth considering how you feel about the service.\\n\\nOVERALL\\n\\nBest burger in Orlando is a tough call, but if you put me on the spot I might say The Dapper Duck. Great food, Great watering hole, Great Staff.

The new boy and I came here on a Wednesday evening, and I assure you that we will be back often. \\n\\nTreehouse is located in Peachtree Hills, which is about a 15-minute walk from my apartment off of Piedmont. That, in itself, is going to be fantastic for summertime outings, as it has an enclosed porch, a patio, and some quaint inside tables. Before I get to the actual restaurant, let me talk about Peachtree Hills. What I love about Atlanta is that there are some neighborhoods, often located between the crazily trafficked streets Piedmont and Peachtree, that completely make you forget that you are in a city. This is one of those neighborhoods. It's wooded, with small roads, shops, and lots of condominiums. It is quiet and suburban-like, only that the streets are narrower and walkable (or runnable if amongst those neighborhood joggers who passed us a few times that evening). Beware the neighborhood speed bumps that pop up out of nowhere, and make sure to pass the modern art statues that look like stacks of windows (they are cool).\\n\\nTo the place itself: As the sign suggested, we sat ourselves at a porch table along the entryway to the restaurant. I had already spotted the soup-of-the-day offering on the hanging chalkboard that suggested the roasted tomato soup, which was definitely going make its way into my belly. The waitress was quick and courteous, bringing us waters with no questions, and supplying us with a beer, wine, and food menu. Despite having a beer tonight, I do want to state that they wine list is beyond reasonable. Whites start in the low 20s and reach the high 30s, at most. While that probably means it is not going satiate the seasoned wine drinker, the price range is more than appropriate for those looking to enjoy a bottle or two with four or five friends with a mid-week evening meal.\\n\\nThe menu is plain and American, with an assortment of sandwiches, a few burgers, a bunch of appetizers, some pasta, and some pan pizza (actual pizza from a wood-burning oven, not the trendy, dainty flatbreads that we Millennial somehow spontaneously foodgasm too). I had one of those pizzas. The boy tried to carbon-copy my order of soup and pizza before I stopped him and substituted the second pie for an order of the tequila-lime hummus and pita bread. While realizing that my entire dinner was a carb-fest, the Pita was great, the hummus was grungy-delicious, and you actually were given enough bread for the dip. The 8\\" pan pizza, was fluffed up (which makes me suspect there was a wood-burning oven if the back there somewhere), and while delicious, still enough to take home half of it. The soup was thick and seasoned well.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is neighborhood homey and quiet. So chill. I mean, I could probably spend a few hours here when the sun is up.

I decided on an order of \\"perfect\\" nachos for a starter, which basically means \\"the way they used to be served before someone got the idea to just pile chips and stuff randomly on a plate\\". These were individual, whole chips, arranged nicely on a plate, with a proper amount of topping on each, and heated until the cheese melted. They looked good on the plate, but were a little soggy and shy on the toppings other than cheese. Overall, a rather \\"meh\\" starter. \\n\\nThe chili fared a little better; I requested a \\"taster\\" bowl of XXX and a small of XX, anticipating that the XXX might be more than I wanted to go with this late in the evening. The XXX was, in a word, well, hot. Spiced with habanero peppers, it delivered a punch, but still had good flavor. I wasn't up for more than a few bites, though. The XX was spicy, but nowhere near the XXX. It used either brisket or stew meat as the protein, which almost made it a bit too chewy. The flavor was good, but honestly, for a place with \\"chili\\" in the name, I'd expect a bit more depth in the taste. \\n\\nI'd like to return and try some of the other menu items next time.

So, once she and the foodrunner sorted out what was to be delivered, she offered us a seat.  Now, there are 3 tables in the whole house.

The staff was friendly. The decor is aesthetically pleasing. It's a mash up between trendy and southern. \\n\\nWe opted for the pimento cheese popovers as it is one of their staples and we did not regret it! The popovers were fresh, warm, light and airy and pairs well with the cheese. \\n\\nWe got the friend chicken, half classic half spicy with the waffle. I definitely prefer the classic, crispy and flavorful with tender chicken. The spicy, I found was very spicy (I typically handle spicy well) however my boyfriends piece of chicken was less spicy for some reason. Aside from the heat of the chicken, I thought it was quite salty and the seasonings were okay. I'm a big fan of Nashville hot chicken so it's quite hard to compare to the fried chicken down south! As for the waffle, it was smaller than I expected. For the amount of chicken, I would like a bigger waffle. The waffle was also very crispy but to the point it was breaking up as I was cutting it. There's definitely no fluff to the waffle \\n\\nWe also opted for the stuffed corn cakes which I would say is extremely sweet and this is coming from someone with a huge sweet tooth. The corn cakes are dry, as you expect corn cakes to be so I don't think it paired quite well. There's also maple syrup on the perimeter of the plate which I think could be omitted.\\n\\nOverall, I would give the food a 3.5. I'm glad I tried it.

I could not see condiments around so asked an employee, he just directed me to find it around the counter. Still couldn't find it so ended up eating without it.

I haven't lived in Atlanta for very long and I haven't had a lot of finer dining experiences in the city yet. \\n\\nThat being said, I thoroughly enjoyed Canoe.\\n\\nThe Good: I made my reservation using Yelp a day ahead of time for our 2 yr. anniversary. They have complimentary valet at the door which was nice because it was drizzling rain. The hostess took our coats and gave us a ticket. (Also complimentary) We were seated immediately. The inside of the restaurant was decorated very nicely. Our waitress appeared to be very busy but we had 2 people come to our table and ask if we needed anything and informed us our waitress would be there shortly. We were given a very large wine list and a menu to look over. Our waitress was very nice initially and explained every single dish in depth to us (even though we didn't ask).  They seemed to have a pretty solid variety of entrees (fish, meat, etc). The restaurant has someone to come around with about 4 different kinds of bread for you to choose from. We both had the Rabbit dish. I can't remember the name but it was fantastic. The rabbit was extra tender and all the sides were very tasty. After the meal we were given a dessert menu but nothing really caught our eye. Then we went to the hostess stand and got our coats and the valet brought our car around.\\n\\nThe Bad: Nothing was too bad, but for the sake of providing a complete review: We were at our table for 8-10 minutes before we had our drink orders taken. After explaining all the dishes (which took some time) we took a few minutes to decide.  My girlfriend decided she wanted one of the fish entrees but when she went to place her order, the waitress informed her that they were sold out of that particular entree but she did apologize for not mentioning that earlier. We sat by the kitchen and didn't really get to enjoy the river view that I hear they have. The restaurant was a little on the loud side but nothing unbearable. They were very busy the night we were there but the waitress seemed to get a little snappy with us as the night progressed. She wasn't mean but just sort of lost the friendliness in her attitude. But like I said, none of that really took away from our meal.\\n\\nAny other useful info: 1 Glass of Wine, 2 waters, and 2 entrees with a 20 percent tip was $105\\n\\nAll in all it was a pretty nice experience and I will probably go there again."},{"name":"Banger's Sausage House & Beer Garden","address":"79 81 & 81.5 Rainey St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Probably the only reason to go down Rainey.

Had to have Mad Dog Margaritas to start (even though they aren't made of the 20/20 variety, LOL) and it didn't take long for them to arrive. They were good margaritas, not too sweet!! We ordered the frito chili pie with XXX chili and the Texas sampler of XXX chili, queso, and guacamole. Chili was awesome. Not as spicy as we thought it could be, but it had a little heat! It was rich and thick like real chili should be and no beans - Yay! You bean folks can indeed order with beans, so there's something for everyone.

Unfortunately, my most recent experience was ruined by a very uncomfortable and inappropriate interaction with two staff members. While ordering our dinner and a beer, our server Aaron took the drink orders for a male friend and myself, but when our female friend asked for a beer he condescendingly stated it appeared she had already been drinking and that he would have to reassess the situation after she had eaten some food. He then abruptly left the table, and after realizing he wasn't just joking we were all taken aback by his presumption. She was in no way acting intoxicated, and the only difference between her and the other people at our table he brought beers to was that she was female. When he returned with our beers, my friend who was understandably offended asked what about her appearance and demeanor made him feel she was too intoxicated to have a beer; rather than providing any explanation for his decision he stated that it was his judgment to make and that he would have to grab a manager if we wanted to discuss it further. When the manager Bradford came to our table, instead of assessing the situation or attempting to understand my friend's feelings that she had been unfairly discriminated against, he simply stated that although he \\"hoped it wouldn't ruin our experience\\" he had to stand behind his staff member. \\n\\nNearly everyone that was in our group has experience working in the restaurant/alcohol/service industry, and none of us could recall a time we had witnessed such blatant discrimination or mishandling of a situation without anyone providing any justification or explanation of the judgment that was made despite our multiple inquiries. I understand how difficult it is to have to assess when someone has had too much to drink, but this was not that. This was a group of well-mannered, non-disruptive friends attempting to have a meal and a drink at a place we all previously enjoyed on a regular basis. Instead, my friend was subjected to unfounded discriminatory judgment without any attempt at an explanation or subsequent apology and a manager who was condescending to us all and who took a hard line stance that his employee could not possibly have misjudged the situation before ever seeing or talking to any of us. Mistakes happen, and the initial judgment that my friend was intoxicated was forgivable. The subsequent treatment of her and the rest of our group by the server and his manager is not."},{"name":"Buffalo Wild Wings","address":"11400 University Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"2.5","text":"I love wings and the best wings in the world are free!

Don't come here in search of a long list of Americanized sushi rolls (although Junji will gladly make you anything you want). The sushi you will eat here will have have perfectly seasoned rice, great nori and expertly prepared fish and/or vegetables.  Junji takes steps in preparing fish you simply won't find anywhere else in the area. Try a Sake (Salmon) nigiri and see for yourself. Don't forget to try the green tea, it is freshly brewed and equally yummy.\\n\\nJunji's wife Akiko is usually waitressing most nights of the week and the other waitresses/waiters are equally attentive.\\n\\nIf you eat fish, my absolute favorite dish  is the Oshizushi 3 fish.  It is a pressed sushi made in a box with Sake, Hamachi and Albacore with avocado and comes with miso soup. You can order it with just Sake, Saba or anything you want. If you're in a nigiri/sashimi mood and don't know what you want, sit at the sushi bar and ask Junji what he recommends on that day or you can always choose one of the many menu options where Junji picks for you.\\n\\nIf you are a vegetarian or vegan, Junji makes a delicious shiitake mushroom maki and because his rice is seasoned perfectly, even a vegetarian staple like an avocado maki shines.\\n\\nSushi is my favorite food and Junji is my hands down go-to sushi chef.

I understand that it's Korean comfort food, but compared to the other place in Koreatown it was excessively oily. I paid $13 for my food and it felt expensive for what it was; I'd maybe give it another star if it was under $9. Service was very friendly and accommodating, I'm giving an extra star just for that. \\n\\nI doubt I'll come back, but it was worth a shot. If anyone knows of any other places that serve jajangmyeon in the Portland area, please send me a message."},{"name":"Buffalo Wild Wings","address":"11400 University Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"2.5","text":"I went here to watch the Gators and the Knights game.

I didn't get anything Greek on my first trip to this place. Curse the way my parents raised me (going to blame it on that) because I have a very weak palate thus far in my life. I don't eat too many \\"adventurous\\" foods. However, I think this may also be because I haven't ventured out to try any, though I am willing. When I try something Greek, I will be sure to post an updated review.\\n\\nThat aside, what I DID order on my first trip to Nick's was spectacular. \\n\\nI live literally just down the street from this aesthetically-pleasing, friend-to-the-artist hole-in-the-wall. How's that for hyphens? I walked here on my way back into downtown, not really knowing what to expect. I had driven past it all the time but had never decided to make the trip until yesterday. \\n\\nI ordered the Nick's 1/4 Burger. I took off a few things: lettuce, tomato, and onion, and added both cheese and bacon. I like it plain and simple. Also unhealthy. Don't judge (too much). I made it a combo as well. \\n\\nNow, I don't really know quite how to introduce my excitement for this burger + meal. I don't think I can say it any other way. One of the BEST burgers I have ever had in my LIFE. Not just in the city of Atlanta, though it is high atop that list as well. Additionally, the fries were the absolute bomb. Thick and flavorful, just as one would hope they would be. Everything came to me in a greasy white paper bag. Love it. Seriously! That's how you know it's authentic. \\n\\nThe physical appeal of the place? You all know I loved it. As a creative, I am all too charmed by the small, art-covered slab of local flavor right on my own block. Inside is simply a window where you place your order. I didn't get to speak with Nick himself (heard he can be a crab), but who I did speak with (didn't catch her name) was very kind. \\n\\nI will definitely be back to Nick's in the future! And perhaps I'll bring my roommate who does happily eat Greek foods without a helping hand."},{"name":"Dai Due","address":"2406 Manor Rd, Ste A","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"went out for lunch with coworkers and had a quail salad. loved their salad mix and how they cooked a quail.

The place was slightly packed when we first arrived and only had about 3 servers walking around. The server that lead us to our table was nice and able to help us out a lot. \\n\\nThe other two servers had an attitude, and one didn't speak English at all. When I asked her a question about the broth, she laughed and called the other server over who didn't do much to help, and then they both left to go assist the table behind us. \\n\\nThe food was decent, if you're going for soup dumplings, it's about a 20 minute wait for each order (which contains about 4 small dumplings about 2 inches in diameter). By the way, my biggest complaint that, aside from the beef, everything is FROZEN. You're quiet limited in options but it's okay when it heats up. \\n\\nThe biggest issue is the customer service, servers will often forget orders, and short you when you try to ask for things. I should've listened to the other reviews, but I wanted to see if it was actually as accurate as they said.\\n\\nMy advice is to avoid the place if you don't speak Chinese/Cantonese, and if you do go, wear clothes that you don't mind stinking up. The oil smell will invade every inch of your body. There was so much oil on me that I probably smell delicious to those who generously sized people who like fried Oreos.\\n\\nCheckout was terrible.

It was prepared over a bed of roasted vegetables and tossed in balsamic. If your ok with some extra calories I subbed out the sweet corn with the maple bacon Brussels sprouts which were amazing! My husband had the ribs with blue cheese and bacon hash browns. I had to have a bite of each and they were both delicious. The hash browns were a savory, cheesy delight and the ribs fell off the bone and were coated with a sweet and tangy bbq sauce.

What a gem!  They feature an eclectic menu that tries to focus on farm to table dishes with a lovely cocktail menu, wine, and beer lists. My wife opted for a Solena Winery (OR) Pinot Noir while my Mom and I decided on their Maple Bacon Old Fashioned. The cocktails were excellent and the taste of the Pinot I was able steal from my wife was as well. For starters we enjoyed their Bread Service and Loaded Homemade Chips. The bread had wonderful flavors and served with Olive Oil as well as butter that we quartered for the table. The chips were loaded with fresh bacon, scallions, blue cheese, and a fresh Alfredo sauce that was marvelous!  I choose the Lobster Macaroni and Cheese for dinner while the rest of my family chose different sandwiches. My dish featured nice plump piece of lobster and generous portion of macaroni and what tasted to be a fresh cheese sauce that seemed to feature a little Swiss as well as cheddar topped toasted bread crumbs. Granted that dish has little to do with Ohio farm to table but it was yummy nonetheless!  My family had nothing but positive comments regarding their sandwiches. The excitement started a minute before our meals arrived when the power went out in a several block vicinity!  The staff did not miss a beat and brought out candles to light the tables. After we finished dinner and beverages they took our CC information to bill when the power was restored. All and all, a solid four stars based on service, friendliness, and the yumminess of the food and drink!  Thank you!"},{"name":"City Barbeque","address":"3758 W Powell Rd","city":"Powell","stars":"4","text":"I preview the comments on Yelp before ever trying a new restaurant and it always boggles my mind when the ratings are either very high or very low for the same location.  What's going on?    People just have that much difference in taste or no taste at all?  Was the restaurant just having a rare bad day?  But on previous visits, I had pretty good experiences and would have rated this location pretty highly. So I am answering my own questions by admitting that now I understand.  Wednesday night's Door Dash delivery was just awful.  It was not the delivery at all which arrived faster than expected and the driver was so nice.    It was no fault of theirs which I thought originally.  I had just read an article which claimed 25% of food delivery drivers admitted that they have eaten some of peoples' food before arrival.  EWWW. But soon it was apparent that City BBQ just didn't care.  Here goes:  the worst was the side of baked beans, my favorite.  The appearance of the container made me gag and led to my first suspicion the delivery guy had gotten into it.  A dog getting into it would have eaten more cleanly.  No, this was the fault of someone who scooped it, spilled it, pressed the lid down on the container trapping the beans in the rim.  I will attach a photo of how it looked when it showed up.  There were very little beans because of the spillage plus there was a huge chunk of gristled, fatty pork lying across the entire bottom. They were cold.  In fact, the green beans were piping hot and delicious, yet the sweet potatoes, which were also sparse, were cold as well. The flavors were fine.  I also ordered sweet tea which was really too strong to drink.  And not cold.  Usually it's very good.  Also, there were no eating utensils or napkins in the bag as well.  I'm still confused.  From my perspective, this location has gone downhill.  Or maybe there is just an employee who doesn't want to be there.  I went to Old Canal Smokehouse In Chillicothe which is, to me, the gold standard.  The bbq is picked over and cleaned every morning - no fat, no gristle.  Their sides like the coconut onion rings are fresh and awesome.  Maybe it wouldn't hurt for the manager to take this crew on a field trip to show what pride in product, workmanship and a little caring can accomplish."},{"name":"Dapper Duck Bar","address":"28 S Orange Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Delicious brunch and bottomless mimosas!!

GROSS. How does that at all qualify as homemade? We mixed water into a packet of fat and sugar. Confirmation of my transfat inkling.  The waffle was fine but the \\"Caramelized\\" aspect meant drenched in a thick syrup that tasted of nothing but sugar, not just some browned sugary bananas as I was imagining.\\nThe eggs benedict was grosser. The \\"homemade hollandaise\\" I am pretty sure had come out of some sort of squirt bottle. It was bright scary yellow in color and had covered the eggs in a thin layer like paint, totally unlike a blob of the real stuff.

The ambiance was very refined, bright and beautiful! We were seated inside by the huge glass window/walls that displayed the river and garden they had going on outside. Everyone we encountered there, from the hostess to our waitress, was incredibly kind and welcoming. Our waitress was very knowledgeable about the menu and recommended us some nice dishes. We got the salmon appetizer to start, I got the angus burger, and my bf got a fish sandwich. \\n\\nWe got some bread and butter to start. It was good, solid, nothing to write home about. Then the appetizer came out and was presented and plated fantastically! It tasted very fresh and delicious! The sauce was delightful! I was so eager to eat it that I forgot to take a photo!!! Sorry about that guys! \\n\\nNext, our entrees came out and unfortunately this is where Canoe lost 2 stars from me. The burger looked amazing. I had also read reviews and saw that a lot of people recommended the burgers here. But it was for the duck and beef burger, not the plain lunch angus burger. So maybe that's where I went wrong. Anywho, as soon as I bit into it, I realized that it was SO DRY and also BURNT on the bottom. I figured, ok, maybe I haven't gotten to the center where all the juices and flavors are. So I keep eating and eating (Bc I was also starving so i just put whatever into my mouth) and by the time I'm 3/4ths of the way finished, I realized wow...this burger is really just unseasoned, unflavorful, super dry, bitter, and hence was completely burnt on the bottom. I opened it up and yep. It was burnt and it looked like they tried to cover it up with sauces and stuff. \\n\\nThat was probably one of the most disappointing and mediocre burgers I ever had in my life. I definitely would've enjoyed a shake shack burger more than this. My bfs sandwich was pretty good at least, but again, nothing spectacular and he even went as far as to make a joke that a McDonald's filet o fish would've been just as satisfying. At least the fries that came with our meals were delicious.\\n\\nOverall, I can't rave enough about the amazing service and kindness of everyone, but I was incredibly blown by how meh the food was (except for the salmon appetizer, that was amazing!).

If you are eating at the restaurant shopping in that Plaza 6 a.m. to 6 p.m you don't have to worry about paying for parking. We went and the line was long. There was a wait of about 45 minutes. That probably was about the time that it took for us to finally be seated. They originallyasked us if we wanted to sit outside. We decided to hold out for a table inside and fortunately we were able to get one a couple of minutes later. They do offer to text you when your table is ready so that comes in handy if you don't want to sit there and wait for them to scream your name. we decided to get the two meals  that they have on drive-ins in bus so whatever that shows called on the Food Network we had the shrimp and grits and the sausage gravy biscuits. We also threw some pancakes in on the side so I can finish on a sweet note. Overall everything was really tasty. Both the biscuits and the shrimp and grits seem to have an undertone of cinnamon or nutmeg or something sweet. I could have done without that but it didn't ruin it for me. I really enjoyed everything.  The pancakes were pretty good but I always compare pancakes to Cracker Barrel pancakes it's just didn't meet the mark for me when it comes to that comparison.

It offers a variety of salad, burrito and bowl options that come with a few different options within each item type - rice vs quinoa, kale or some other plant base. If green is the primary color of your food, then the sauce/dressing makes a hella of a difference. The Pangoa w/ kale base + add on of pico de gallo and the spicy BBQ is surprisingly delicious! The spicy BBQ is spicier than expected but adds just the right amount of pizzazz to what could be a fairly basic salad.

Do they succeed?  IMO, they muscled their way onto my Top 5 favorites on the strength of their brisket alone, and that says a lot. \\n\\nIt's moist, tender, and has a magnificent bark seasoned with salt, pepper, and a couple other delectable spices I'm still trying to figure out. Their signature specialty seems to be the 'Beef Cheeks' - yes, Virginia, they're slices of bovine facial muscle.  I found them delicious, on a par with Japanese gyutan (tongue).\\n\\nI also have to give them high marks for the pulled pork, as well as the fantastic deep red 'Beet' BBQ sauce.  Oh, and as for the 'little things'?  Those are the sides that come with your order - house-made butter pickles, potato bread, and one of the best bites of kimchi I've had - the hot zing cuts through the richness of the meats, try it on a sandwich!\\n\\nParking and seating's not bad (though I could see issues during peak times).  While there's no inside seating, I'd wander next door to the Cosmic Coffee + Beer Garden if needed. About the only other negative (not enough for me to remove a star) is the price.  Brisket comes out to $30/pound and Pulled Pork to $28/pound - and that's compared to $24 and $21 respectively at a slightly better-known competitor.\\n\\nOkay, if you're thinking of coming down, there's a bevy of Pro Tips to add.\\n\\nPro Tip 1: Parking. L&L's is a food truck, situated among a couple food trucks, a coffee bar, and a whole bunch of other interesting places like the Crux Climbing Center.  There's a decent sized parking lot and some limited street parking; however this is the kind of place that you have to expect some frustration during peak hours.  If you arrive at a crowded time, I'd drop your guests off and park on one of the adjoining side streets.\\n\\nPro Tip 2: Seating. There's a bunch of reasonably comfy outdoor tables with some shade cast by trees and awnings, but on a hot day I'd wear a hat to be on the safe side. (Or bring an umbrella if it looks like it might rain.)\\n\\nPro Tip 3: Drinks. All drinks (alcoholic and non-alcoholic) can be purchased at Cosmic's.\\n\\nPro Tip 4: Desserts. Try the IPA (India Pale Ale) Popsicle. Trust me, you won't regret it!\\n\\nPro Tip 5: Any Limitations? One of their best dishes, the Akaushi Brisket, is served ONLY on Saturdays!\\n\\nPro Tip 6: What if I want something else besides BBQ? Go next door to Chicken Lollipop or the Pueblo Viejo Taco Truck.\\n\\nPro Tip 7: What if I don't like BBQ?  Then why the heck are you coming to a food truck specializing in BBQ?!?  Okay, seriously: Order the Kale Caesar Slaw, it's amazing.\\n\\nThis place scores a 5 out of 5 on the 'CTJ Scale', as noted below.\\n\\n5 out of 5 stars: Come-to-Jesus good. Would be OK passing away after finishing a plate here.\\n4 out of 5 stars: Come-to-Mary good. Would be OK being seen eating here by Mother Mary.\\n3 out of 5 stars: Come-to-Joseph good.

We sampled 3 single burgers, a Firebird (buffalo chicken sandwich) and a Coney dog. The burgers were done well, and the customizable options made each a unique bite of awesomeness. My personal favorite starred caramelized onions, jalapeno, cheddar cheese sauce, and bacon on a potato roll. Delish. The dog thumped pretty hard too with the chili, diced onion, and mustard all working in harmony. Firebird was also a quality sandwich. Flipping the page in our fat kid handbook, we had to wash it all down with an extra thick frappe (toll house cookie & rocky road). Yeah, it was as good as you probably think it would be.\\n\\nTo boot, the (owner, manager?) at the counter was very personable and friendly (we even overheard him extending help to the other staff).

It was getting chilly last night and I had a \\"hankerin'\\" for some kind of saucy, spicy, naan-y Indian goodness. Instead of hitting up my old friend Tarka for some American style choose your own adventure, I did a quick search for Indian around me. Lo and behold, Madras was open late (for a Sunday) and had excellent reviews. \\n\\nThankfully the buffet wasn't an option (I mean, who can resist a buffet??) so we ordered the \\"dinner for two\\" like my good friend Stu R suggested. Let me just warn you... that dinner for two? More like a dinner for two elephants. What ensued was a four top table covered in dishes brimming with deliciousness. It was like Tetris - the moment we eliminated one, another would drop down. \\n\\nTo start, the lentil based Mulligatawny soup with papadum. A nice starter but nothing that knocked my proverbial socks off. Then, deep fried vegetable fritters. Dense, fried to within an inch of their lives and served with two dipping sauces. Now we're talking! Then arrives a giant dosai with potatoes and onions and more dipping sauce. Size of my torso people, I'm not joking. Then, a gargantuan platter of naan, basmati rice and three dishes -- a cauliflower curry, Tadaka Dal and saag paneer. Saag Paneer was the standout -- mostly because it tasted like I was eating straight butter with cheese in it. The best creamed spinach you've ever had. To follow, some kind of mango condensed milk thing with a hard lump of homemade cottage cheese. I know that description is lacking but at this point, I was at a loss for coherent thoughts. \\n\\nWe waddled up to the counter, paid our $33 bill (total) and wondered if we'd ever be able to wear pants again. I am amazed they can serve this much food and call it a dinner for two. Also note that they do serve beer and wine here now. Although, the wine they serve is Copa (yeah... those little cups) so I'm not totally sure you can call it wine. I'd be remiss if I didn't mention the service. It was excellent and it seemed like we had three people serving us, filling our water pitcher, bringing out food, checking on us, etc. Definitely some royal treatment. \\n\\nIn short, all veg, giant portions, great service, good deals and open late. One of my favorite North finds right now. Oh and one last protip: Don't wear clothes you plan on wearing anywhere else.

Joy Cafe is located in a small shopping strip with complimentary parking for patrons. However, keep in mind that the lot will fill up quickly because it's a small lot and Joy Cafe is really busy. We waited in the line that was forming outside of the cafe for about 10-15 minutes before we realized that we had to go to the front of the line to a nice elderly woman to tell her how many in our party and a name. Because of this, two groups that came after us, were able to get seated before us. Complimentary iced water with oranges is is placed on a table outside in a dispenser for all those that are waiting -- which is very nice of them to do so. We waited for about 45 minutes before we got seated. We arrived at the restaurant at 11:30am on a Sunday morning. We asked to get seated inside and boy, I probably should have suggested to sit outside. It's pretty packed inside. The tables are all really close to each other. The space is too small of the growing popularity of the restaurant -- but I guess that adds to it's charm? There are three to four tables for outdoor seating outside of the restaurant. There's complimentary wifi -- the password --- MadeWithLove\\n\\nI ordered the traditional chicken salad on toasted marble rye bread with a side of pasta salad and sweet peach tea. My friend also ordered Joy's Big Berry Belgian Waffle for us to try out. Our orders came out quickly. I thought the chicken salad was pretty standard. You do get a lot of food for what you pay. My sandwich was overflowing with chicken salad! Thank you! The pasta salad was a disappointment for me. The pasta to veggies ratio was off. There were more olives, bell peppers, and other veggies than the bow tie pasta. The bow tie pasta was also broken up to pieces as if they had stirred/mixed the pasta salad too much. Next time I'll just go with the grits since I hear good things about it. My Belgium waffle is good. It's a must order for those who love waffles and fruit. They are very generous on the portion of fruits that they put on top of the waffle. It was very good and very pretty to look at as well.\\n\\nThe service was just okay. I felt like you should probably know to refill drinks without someone having to ask especially in a small sized restaurant. I had to grab another server to ask for a refill. When we got our waffle, they forgot to give us syrup. We didn't get it until our server came by to ask how we were and noticed no syrup and quickly grabbed it. Other than these little things, service was okay.\\n\\nOverall, this first visit was okay. I would like to try other items on their menu and possibly come on a less busier time or day. I'll make sure to update my review of the restaurant when I do get a chance to try it again."},{"name":"Deschutes Brewery Portland Public House","address":"210 NW 11th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Menu options are limited and overpriced.

But with a somewhat recent expansion of the menu, they've stepped things up and have gone from good to great. \\n\\nWhen they opened, The Carvery focused on doing a handful of sandwiches well. And the mainstays, particularly the porketta sandwich, were delicious. The daily specials were also creative and tasty. But the problem often was limited supply--of everything, specials and standards alike. \\n\\nThey've now dramatically expanded the menu, resulting in a variety of new choices and eliminating the availability problems that they faced in the past. \\n\\nIn many ways, it's like a whole new restaurant. So if you've been before and were turned off by the lack of options or frustrated in your attempt to get what you wanted, it's time to go back and give them a second chance!\\n\\nThe hardest thing now will probably be deciding WHICH sandwich to get. All of the sandwiches are made of high quality ingredients, and you will usually see them slicing your meats directly from a freshly roasted source. Because of that (and speaking from experience, having sampled a variety of things on the menu) I can tell you it's hard to go wrong. I must admit to still being partial to the porketta. The only slight miss in recent memory was the Thanksgiving sandwich, which with both bread and stuffing ended up a little TOO bready. \\n\\nDo note that all of the sandwiches are quite large.

The BLTA, the A stands for avocado, was really good. The bacon was cooked nicely, the bread was toasted just right and the flavor was great. The burger dip wasn't as good. It's a poor mana version of a French dip, which was clearly described and sounded good! However, it was drenched in grease so much that the bun was soggy from the grease and it pooled under the bun. The onions were cooked nicely and the burger was nicely cooked but the grease pool was just too much and made it unenjoyable. We both order the house chips.

We have been in search of good Gyros where ever we travel.  The best so far was a street vendor in Paris and Petros Restaurant in Greek Town Chicago.  Both are long gone.   But getting back to Angelina's we kept asking the people at the Saturday market. \\"when are you going to open a real restaurant so that we can go during the week\\".     I think they opened this early this year and we finally got to go today.  Its a cozy place near the riverfront.  Service was friendly and fast.  And the Gyros were EXCELLENT!  I think what sets them apart is a nice spicy beef/lamb gyro meat.  You can get it spicier too.  Lots of fresh onions and sliced cherry tomatoes and lettuce with a tasty sauce.  You can also get it with feta cheese and or cucumbers.   And.... the serve it with a heated pita.  That makes them unique and the Gyros good!.

Keep your eyes peeled and be prepared to look around. \\n\\nI went with the shrimp po' boy ($9) since some people on Nextdoor had been raving about it.  The owner has switched to leidenheimer bread for the po' boys since someone on nextdoor gave him that feedback. The po' boy was good. I wish I would have thought to dress it with some hot sauce before I left the place. I think the kick would have made it that much better. There was a good amount of shrimp on it. The sandwiches don't come with sides so you have to order that separately. \\n\\nI got a side of gumbo and honestly can't remember how it tasted. Decent I think. There was one little bit of pork I tossed and a crab claw in it. Score! It did take a bit for the ladies in back to bring it out. Me and another lady in there had the same order. They brought both sandwiches out and left them thinking they were part of one order. When they realized we each had a gumbo they went in back for about 5 minutes before bringing out the gumbo.

Not sour and pretentious just because it has the word \\"reserve\\" in the name. The \\"sommelier\\" was sent to our table because our waiter was tired of our questions and showed little interest in our taste and more interest in the price of our bottle.

We asked for both of our burritos to have rice inside of them. The nachos that were brought out were the carnitas nacho supreme, which costs $4 more than the nachos supreme, and there were jalapenos on it. My friend made a comment about the jalapenos, so they took it back and brought out another order of the carnitas nachos supreme. We didn't want to send anything else back, so we didn't say anything and just let it go. My friend didn't even like the nachos and only ate 2 or 3. When the burritos came out we were confused because they looked like small enchiladas, not burritos. None of the 4 \\"burritos\\" had rice in them like we asked for and they were swimming in sauce (like an enchilada would be), so the tortillas were all soggy. Trying to get a drink refill was also a chore. We had to flag down someone other than our server because he disappeared.

What a moment.  One of many firsts in my life.  Speaking of which, I just turned 21 a few weekends ago.  Lots of hub-ub around 21.  Lots of \\"so how does it feel to have your FIRST drink? wink wink nudge nudge\\" from family members and co-workers.  Hahahaha, gets funnier every time I hear it.  \\n\\nSo of course, I've been hitting the local watering holes to see what I've been trying to get into illegally all these years.  Like Alice, I've fallen down a rabbit hole into a magical world.  Beer flows like water, people dance and sing on sticky floors, and everything bad in the outside world seems to melt away in a foggy haze.  \\n\\nSo I went with a few friends to Lansdowne, a local favorite I've heard a lot about.  $5 cover, totally normal as I've come to learn.  I show off my un-expired passport to the bouncers and walk in, ready to shake hands the Mad Hatter and take a tour of Wonderland.  Little did I know, we were walking into the Queen of Hearts castle.  \\n\\nLet me give Lansdowne this, it is a nice bar.  Large, open space with some great live music.  Prices are normal and there's lots of space to move around.  Seemingly the perfect sort of place for a night out on the town.  \\n\\nAnyways, we immediately approach the bar, and the woman there tells my friend that seltzers are \\"free\\" tonight.  We all look at each other in shock.  \\"Free?\\" my friend asks and the bartender nods and says \\"Free\\".  Now we aren't seltzer-fans but free is free.  So we take our seltzers and walk away from the bar.  I crack mine open and make it about 15 steps into the bar when one of the Queen's Knights (bouncers) approaches and demands that we pay for the seltzers.  \\"We were told they're free\\" we exclaim.  \\"No they were three\\" the treacherous mixologist explained, rubbing her hands together menacingly while adjusting her top hat and monocle. \\n\\nThe Queen's Knight (bouncer) goes on the power trip of his life, rips the opened seltzer out of my hand and throws it back on ice and tells us that we are the ones trying to run some sort of spiked seltzer-ponzi scheme.  So being the upstanding citizens we are, we paid the $3 after a bit of an argument (I should mention that they gave us new seltzers, not the ones we already opened that were taken away from us, so at least we got the last laugh I guess).\\n\\nNow, I don't mean to get all Alex Jones right now, but what person when talking about price says \\"three\\" instead of \\"three DOLLARS\\" when asked for clarification about a price.  Almost makes me want to put on a tinfoil hat, filter the fluoride out of my water, and declare that this bartender purposely said this in a loud bar KNOWING that people would misunderstand, take one, open it, then magically owe $3.00.  \\n\\nSo be cautious out there in wonderland, because one pill will make you smaller and the other pill may be something nobody wants to buy so the bar gets rid of it by tricking people into thinking it's \\"free\\", then flips and demands \\"THREE\\" from you.  Well I got three fingers for this place, they just got to read between the lines to see it."},{"name":"Oga's Japanese Cuisine","address":"915 Worcester St","city":"Natick","stars":"4","text":"I used to work down the street from this establishment and would walk here about once a week for lunch. It's a little pricey for lunch, but hands down the best sushi in the Natick/Framingham area. I'd say this place even beats out several places in Boston, but that's not saying much.\\n\\n\\nI'd gamble that the miso soup is indeed made in the restaurant from scratch with quality ingredients, scallion, seaweed and tofu. If not I'd be surprised as the soup here has a fuller and deeper flavor compared to other establishments, which typically use instant miso soup. \\n\\n\\nFor my main I always go with the Chirashi. It comes served in a large covered lacquer bowl. Remove the cover and find a seemingly meticulous assortment of sashimi, rice, pickled vegetables, ikura, tamago and a couple temaki. I doubt the pickled vegetables are made in house, but they provide a variety of colors, tastes and textures.\\n\\n\\nThe rice is well formed, retaining its shape when picked up and has a wholesome feeling when consumed. However, taste is off, slightly stale with an over seasoned aftertaste. This isn't terribly noticeable, but  The sashimi is decent quality, not rubbery yet not super fresh and tender.

It's a scored half avocado with wasabi vinaigrette on top of thin shaved onion and served with a chunk of lemon to squeeze over top. \\n\\nNext we ordered the Yellowtail Jalape√±o. It's thinly sliced and served in a little pool of cilantro ponzu. The jalape√±o is a very small seedless sliver that doesn't overpower the delicate buttery flavor of the hamachi. \\n\\nAlso, the Rock Shrimp Tempura. You can get them with either ponzu or a spicy mayo sauce. We got the latter and it was fabulous.  Not overly spicy but perfectly coated and the shrimp was cooked and lightly battered to perfection. \\n\\nNext we had our bartender's favorite-an order of spicy tuna over crunchy rice. The crunchy rice was so different and I loved the whole plate. \\n\\nMy favorite dish is bordering between two-- the first the New Page Roll. Tempura shrimp rolled inside with thin sliced lemon, topped with salmon. \\nThe tart flavor really made all the difference and I found myself hoarding the last few bites for myself. \\nThe other that might top it was the crafted nigiri. \\nThe first set being Sake Aioli, a cured Scottish Salmon nigiri lightly salted brushed with white garlic aioli, lime and black caviar. \\n\\nOn the same plate was the Madai Nigiri, between the rice and raw fish was a shiso leaf (mint) topped with sea salt, kanzuri and yuzu sauce. \\n\\nI can't decided which I liked more but I appreciated the flavors that all complimented the raw flavor of the fish. The server who dropped the plate off at our table not only gave us a full description of each plate but encouraged us to try each without soy sauce so it wouldn't cloud the overall flavor. \\n\\nLastly we had another thinly sliced ahi plate served with jalape√±o, avocado oil and ponzu. Avocado was on the plate as well and the thin slices accompanied the fish well. \\n\\nI feel like a shmuck for loving this place so much. Jesse is our favorite bartender and I use him as an excuse to dine and drink at UMI. \\nBut the food is always ridiculously perfect. \\n\\nSo inventive and creative. \\n\\nI will be back again and again."},{"name":"Hawkers Asian Street Food","address":"1103 Mills Ave N","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"It is a perfect place to explore different flavors and share a meal.

Happy Hour is 5pm-6:30pm on Tuesday to Thursday.\\n\\nFor brunch they have the items such as their pancakes and various breakfast platters. The pancakes here are thick and fluffy and very filling! Some of their best foods appear on both the brunch and lunch menu - the Cemita Ahogada, Pastrami sandwich, and the dry-aged Double Wagyu Cheeseburger! In my opinion the best thing to order here is their Cemita Ahogada - you cannot get this anywhere else! It is essentially a sandwich with perfectly marinated carne guisada that's dipped in a very flavorful, slightly spicy broth. A lot of Dai Due's dishes showcase their curated meats, which usually ends up being quite heavy. They do have pickled veggies as some of the sides to help balance the dish, but I would recommend ordering a few lighter choices to help balance the meal out! \\n\\nBut in summary, I love Dai Due for their quality of ingredients and their rich flavors in their dishes."},{"name":"Canoe","address":"4199 Paces Ferry Rd SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Came here for Sunday Brunch....\\n\\nLocation: Hidden off of , beautiful building inside and outside.

My most recent visit to this location was my first! I use to live in Atlanta for a few years and they happened to be one of my favorites when I just wanted a good traditional handmade pizza from scratch! One of the things I've always appreciated about Fellini's Pizza was the Home type of feel when you eat here. That was the normal case with another location that I mentioned I would frequent a few years back. I came here on a late night maybe around 1AM and the staff of course bored out of their minds standing around talking. When I walked in the conversation they were having perhaps may have been more important so I just stood at the counter looking lost. Any who I literally just wanted a basic pepperoni pizza. The slices come around $2.75 each plus additional charge for toppings. One thing you have to know about this place is your pizza cost can add up extremely fast! Medium was my choice this time around and at base price of $13 I was quickly reminded that it was about to be more! Pepperoni added was an additional $1.50.. That part I can understand but when you want little veggies such as black olives, onions or anything of that nature they too will cost you $1.50. Not worth it. This time they were pretty stingy with the pepperoni and I literally had one of the slices have 1 pepperoni on it. Come on now.. **rolls eyes** with how hungry I was I had no energy to argue about it so I took it and went on my merry way. I had to ask myself was the pizza actually worth it because of it's presentation. When it is 1AM and nothing else open and you are starving you get what you can. I can't say that I was overly pleased with the quality of purchase nor the customer service hence the 3-star rating.

It has a small-town, family owned vibe with the speedy and efficiency of a city hotspot. This is one of the BEST places to take your out-of-town guests if you want to introduce them to authentic Southern cuisine outside of chain restaurants at a reasonable price.\\n\\nFOOD: You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. Some of our favorite staples include: The Chicken & The Egg Sandwich (the citrus dressing is underrated, in my opinion, and really ties together the flavors of the sandwich), Mama Carol's Buttermilk Pancakes, and the House Made Granola (my fiancee gets this with almond milk because she has a dairy allergy). All baked goods are also worth sampling -- the other day, we took home a seasonal Apple Cinnamon cupcake to celebrate finishing up our Save the Dates, and it was SO delicious.\\n\\nATMOSPHERE: Homestyle restaurant with indoor and outdoor seating (weather permitting)! There is bar seating available as well. I love the vibe in here on the weekends because it's hustling and bustling, but all servers are still extremely friendly even though they're busy. The owner, Joy, can also often be seen checking on tables, running dishes, getting refills, etc. This is a big deal to me because it shows how much the owners and management care about the quality of service and food.\\n\\nSEATING: Personally, I think the layout is best for parties of 4 or less, but the tables can be combined together to accommodate larger parties. There is one wide, round table near the bakery that seats at least 6.\\n\\nPARKING: This is one of our \\"walking distance\\" brunch spots, but I know they validate parking.\\n\\nDRINKS: My favorite is the mimosa flights, particularly the elderflower! I am a Diet Coke fiend and was so excited they offer it, even if it comes in a bottle. :)\\n\\nIt's also worth noting that of the many, many times we've eaten here, we've only had one or two errors/snafus -- and NEVER with the service being provided. Servers are humans, and occasionally humans make errors, but the way this staff is trained to handle these situations should be studied and copied by other restaurants. The way Joy Cafe handles errors just reinforces their commitment to customer satisfaction. Both times, we received a free baked good for our troubles and Joy came out personally to apologize - and one of those times was simply me not loving their \\"pico de gallo\\" version of a bloody mary. I was totally wiling to pay for the drink because nothing was wrong with my order, it just wasn't my style of bloody mary, but they took it off my bill, which was so sweet and unnecessary.\\n\\nIn short, I could never say enough good things about this restaurant. I highly recommend it to anyone and everyone."},{"name":"Uno Pizzeria & Grill","address":"Kenmore Square, 645 Beacon St","city":"Boston","stars":"2.5","text":"Came to Uno after a Red Socks game because we were hungry, unfamiliar with what was open in the area and found Unos pretty quickly.

Don't expect to leave feeling stuffed, it's definitely more of a tasting menu feel, but with unbeatable flavor combinations. It was my first time at staplehouse. We had reservations in the main dining area. The ambiance and service was so lively and friendly. My friend and I are both vegetarian and we were surprised by the number of options on a small dinner menu. We started with the grandmother's potato bread. I had no idea one roll could have so much flavor. It was salty and crunchy on the outside, but the inside was soft and melted in my mouth. The potato flavor comes at the very end brought out by the whipped olive oil butter. For the main entrees we got an eggplant dish and a potato dish. I would definitely recommend getting 4-5 items between 2 people because the portion sizes are very small. The eggplant was amazing with 3 different types of eggplant all cooked differently, crunchy thinly sliced sesame crackers, tarragon oil all topped with fresh tarragon. The potato cake was served with fennel and smoky chanterelle mushrooms. My least favorite of the night but still very flavorful. We of course had to do another round of bread before dessert. Dessert was a fresh summery blackberry extravaganza with an herbaceous ice cream and popped sorghum on top. Definitely a party in my mouth. The cocktails were mostly bourbon and tequila based but well made and not too sweet. Overall it was a great night with delicious food and friendly service!"},{"name":"Dino's Brick Oven Pizzeria","address":"389 Lowell St","city":"Wakefield","stars":"3","text":"I've had pizza here a couple of times and liked it a lot.

Food and price were great.  This is not fast food so expect to pay more, but the price equaled the food quality.  The last 3-4 months there has been a decline in in both acceptable food quality as well as price.  For example, the avocado toast price has varied several times and if you add an egg, expect to pay $1 and up as the price for the egg has changed several times.  My understanding is the printed menus have the wrong price but that's what they charge unless you call it out to them.  I'm not sure if the excuse of the price discrepancy they gave me is actually true or not, but that's what I was told.  \\nI've ordered online and from the counter as a to go meal and it's often incorrect or quality is not good.  Example: strawberry salad from a previous to go order had burnt pecans on it, today's Cobb Salad had no salad dressing which I confirmed I did order when I placed to order from their website.  I don't have time to take off work to go back to the cafe and have them correct.   Dry salad is not yummy.  Sandwiches are very sloppily made as well.   I love Joy she's a friendly person.

I was working through my lunch to meet an Pendind deadline so thought this would be a quick way to grab a bite to eat at my desk.  BAD IDEA!  Ordered online but still waited 15 minutes after I got to Joy Cafe for my order. I was told the delay is due to some large catering orders they had to get done.  I hate this excuse as it's actually poor planning of staff needs. They should have enough staff to do catering and lunch rush.  Finally received order and got back to office. At my desk I was about to take a bite and was shocked to find a Hair in with the melted cheese on my chicken burger!!!  Called restaurant and no answer.  So back to the cafe I went.  I asked for the manager and was told to wait.   I'm now 40 minutes into a lunch hour I wasn't going to take.  After about 10 minutes I demanded the manager see me now as I'm on my lunch break. She finally came and I explained the issue. She's a rude witch of a woman telling me the caps they wear are sufficient and hair nets are not  needed \\"they can't guarantee they'll be perfect 100% of the time\\". Her exact words!!!  I got my money back. Shared my experience with the office(some who go to Joys weekly) and all of us have decided to by pass Joy Cafe moving forward.

Hot Star tries to, with a Taiwanese twist on a classic, but comes just short of, attaining that standard.\\n\\nThe main reason why I'm giving Hot Star a three-star is because of the pricing. For about $17.00 after tips, you can get the original large chicken and a small \\"regular\\" or \\"large\\" size drink combo (worth about $5.00), with several options to choose from. For non-thirsty customers, the chicken itself will set you back a solid $10.00 before tips. This, too me, seems a bit steep for decent quality chicken. The ratio of meat to batter for me was about 2:3.5. The drink was priced at $4.00 when you combo it with the chicken, but that wasn't worth it because the \\"regular\\" size was comparable to a regular size drink at Chatime, and didn't wow me. I ordered the passion fruit soda which was tasty, but, again, I couldn't justify the price, especially when half the cup was filled with ice.\\n\\nOn that note, however, the meat was well-seasoned and tender, and was served hot - fresh out of the frying machine. The batter itself was perfectly crunchy and tasted okay. I ordered mine spicy which didn't come out too spicy at all so if you're intent on ordering spicy, you might want to ask them to add more or whatever it is they add to make things spicy to get the kick you want. My friend ordered the seaweed flavour option which, according to him, tasted pretty decent. Portion size was on point - when you want a large piece of fried chicken, Hot Star gives you exactly that. Unfortunately, they leave the bones in, but that's not a huge issue.\\n\\nNice, clean atmosphere. Odd music choices for the restaurant though. Decent service. Menu is incomplete, probably because it's only a soft opening. My real review would be 2.8/5 stars."},{"name":"Ball Square Cafe","address":"708 Broadway","city":"Somerville","stars":"4.5","text":"I had the unfortunate displeasure of dining at this restaurant for my birthday breakfast last week. Initially, when I arrived it was just myself and my husband, however my sisters were going to be joining us shortly so we would have been a party of 4. We walk in, asking to be seated at a four top table and we're told that its \\"strict policy that only complete parties are seated\\". I was frustrated but did not show it. We opted to sit at a two top while we waited for them to arrive. While waiting, I notice two gentlemen enter the restaurant, they are then seated at a four top I asked to be seated at- by the same waiter who said I could not be seated there because my party was incomplete. The two gentlemen were sitting at that table for 5-10 minutes before a third person arrived to join them. This infuriated me but again I did not show it and also did not mention it to my husband as to not upset him, his back was towards the door. My sisters arrive and of course as I had foreseen all the four tops were occupied so now at this point I'm beyond infuriated. As I am greeting my sisters this same lying ass waiter comes up to us and rudely tells us to get out of the restaurant cause we're blocking the aisle. Truly my disappointment is immeasurable and my morning had been ruined and at this point it was clear to me his behavior is racially motivated. Once outside I told my husband everything that had occurred regarding the seating arrangements and as expected he was furious and rightfully so. Ultimately left before even eating his meal due to the frustration of his experience with the waiter, my sisters and I were seated after about 5 minutes of waiting outside. We ordered our food, ate and as we were eating, Mike, the owner arrived. He greeted us, and we agreed to speak after our meal which we did. Overall, in speaking with Mike he accepted no responsibility for the actions of his employee nor did it sound like there would be any disciplinary action taken. After hearing my statement he did apologize for the experience \\"cause y'all are like family to me, no one here is like that you know; but, I spoke with my employees and they say they were just following policy. So there must be a misunderstanding. No one person is wrong I am not here to point the fingers. If my parents come and they want to eat they wait in line too.\\". Now, I knew for sure Mike didn't hear anything I said, he was not understanding the consumer pov. He also had not yet check his security tapes(he said he would check later) which would have verified everything I told him. After about 5-7 minutes of this merry go round conversation. I was just tired of reiterating the series of events, my frustration and disappointment etc already knowing what the outcome would be. I thank him for listening and we left.

They bring in a live band and they play all the hits with their instruments. They even brought me up on stage once when my friends told me it was my birthday (even though it wasn't) and had me play the Maracas for a birthday song. \\n\\nThe wait can be a bit long depending on when you come so make sure to avoid peak times. The wait is usually about 1.5 - 2 hours when I've arrived around 11 am. It's not too bad to kill time as Banger's is on Rainey Street and there's plenty of bars to hop around and chill at. My favorite's are The Container Bar and The Bungalow. \\n\\nThe Manmosa alone is worth coming for and was the main reason that attracted me to Banger's in the first place. They use an entire champagne bottle and pour it into a Liter Beer Ma√ü with a splash of orange juice. It's $15 for the Manmosa and has to be ordered with one of the Brunch Specials. \\n\\nThe times I have come here for Brunch, I've ordered the Banger's Benny, Lolo's Corned Beef Hash, and the Bratwurst. \\n\\nTheir Benedict was pretty disappointing to say the least. The portion of the Benedict was small and came with hardly any Hollandaise sauce. However, they were kind enough to bring out more when I asked them to. The shoestring potatoes weren't very good either and didn't come as much as I had seen in previous pictures. The braised pork belly was the highlight of this dish though, but not enough to get me to order this again. \\n\\nLolo's Corned Beef Hash is by far the best Brunch item I have ordered here so far. Everything component of this hash exceeded my standards. The cherry tomatoes, kale, poached eggs, roasted potatoes, and angus brisket were all flavorful and worked in harmony to take me to savory sanctuary. Probably THE best corned beef I have ever had and I would go so far as to saying that the poached eggs in this dish was by far better than the Banger's Benny. Definitely going to order this dish every single time over the Banger's Benny whenever I'm craving a poached egg. \\n\\nThe Bratwurst was alright. It was a lot smaller than I expected for a Bratwurst that I've had at other traditional German pubs. It was about the size of a regular hotdog and came in a hotdog bun as well. Definitely won't fill you up on its own. It's a good thing that I also ordered the House-Cured Half Pound Bacon Steak on the side as well and let me tell you, this is the biggest slab of bacon I have ever seen. It's just so thick and works well with the bacon dip that they make in-house. \\n\\nThis place is definitely one of the top Sunday Brunch spots that you need to check out whenever you're in Austin. Make sure not to be too hungry if you come around peak times as you'll most likely have to wait 1 - 2 hours. They are also expanding by building a bigger restaurant right next door soon, so hopefully they'll be able to handle a lot more people without making them wait 1 - 2 hours. I believe it should be completed around May 2018, and I can't wait to come check it out when they are finished!"},{"name":"Zaxby's Chicken Fingers & Buffalo Wings","address":"3490 Memorial Dr","city":"Decatur","stars":"1.5","text":"Drive-thru is always unnecessarily slow.

I have eaten here two times. The first time was trying the vegetarian hot dog which was so disappointing. Three of my friends tried it as well and thought the same thing. I was surprised they haven't gotten the Beyond Meat sausage and incorporated this in their vegan menu. It's soy free and they taste amazing. \\n\\nI came back today with my celebrity publicist friend and told him how much everyone seems to love it there and we should give it a try. We walked in and it was too busy we were told so there was a 45 minute wait even though there were plenty of places we could see to sit. We were guided to try the outside grill station that has food already ready to go. I encouraged my friend to try it and we learned it was $20 for a plate. Since I do not eat meat I asked the men behind the carving station if we could just get a small portion since my friend only wanted to try it and I cannot eat this meat. The first man gave me the most condescending look and flippantly pointed to the sign and expressed they were an outside company that works with Bangers so they don't and cannot do that. That wasn't a problem truly but the way he was incredibly rude and how he spoke to us I thought was quite shocking. My friend appeared uncomfortable and I brushed it off and we continued getting more items down the line. He gave the other man he worked with a look and my friend said he was gesturing in our direction with both having some higher then mighty attitudes. We got to the girl behind the register and we were kind and I asked a food question and she gave me the most cold and rude response. I was shocked by this entire interaction. I didn't want to point it out to my friend and he said he was completely shocked at how rude they all three were to us. He expressed his utter disappointment in the entire experience and \\"felt bad\\" that we came there. I expressed that I was sorry I recommended it to us and as for the food he said one item was great and the beans were so spicy he couldn't eat it. Lastly just wanted you to know we both watched as we walked away the first man behind the carving station grab food and eat it directly from the pork he was serving and no one was wearing gloves. He continued to eat numerous times as we could see from where we were sitting which appalled us both which matched his utter disregard for public safety, cleanliness and blaz√© yet snobbish attitude he appeared to carry with him as all three appeared to unitedly carry with them. \\n\\nI understand the grill outside is a separate entity but since I have referred so many people here through my work and people that travel into Austin since it always seems busy and I felt I would give it a chance to learn the draw or at least enjoy the atmosphere but I must say that the hostess inside was very nice both times I tried to dine with them and yet they choose to have people like this outside grill company treat customers like they were pennies in a jar they couldn't care less about throwing away especially when we were kind and appreciative of any and all service all gave...then they don't pay enough attention to the quality of the outside grill owners/staff and that in itself effected my perspective of the entire Bangers restaurant experience. I wish I had the chance to actually try a great vegan option of Bangers but unless the hostess herself would be so kind to help me directly with my order as she was nice... neither my friend or I would ever want to see those three behind the grill outside or be reminded of their personal feelings of us as the customers again. \\n\\nYou may want to come here for the food, the appeal of the outside patio but take note that Bangers will most likely not care about this review or their tenants in the grill station and may disappointedly not do anything about this as to this establishment we were only two customers that don't really matter in the bigger picture."},{"name":"Canoe","address":"4199 Paces Ferry Rd SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"10/10 would recommend!

As we enjoyed our meal I noticed a butcher breaking down a side of pork.  She was very talented and precise.

I can imagine parking getting full on weekends.\\n\\nThe inside of the restaurant isn't very big. There isn't too much seating so I would not recommend coming with a large group. The decor is nice. They have cool posters on the wall and they were playing some chibi anime (?) on their tv screen. \\n\\nThe menu has several chicken and tonkotsu (pork) ramen options. They also have a spicy beef, vegetarian, and vegan ramen. \\n\\nAt the time I went they had a ramen set deal going on where you can get any ramen bowl (not including the mega tonkotsu), an appetizer, and a small bite for $18-$20. \\n\\nI decided to go for the deal and get a spicy beef ramen, potato croquettes, and chicken karaage.\\n\\nSpicy Beef Ramen - This ramen reminds me of the one served at Taiyo, which closed earlier this year. I'm not sure if they had the same owners. But Ramen Station's version had more delicious and flavorful broth. It was spicy and the portion size was pretty generous. The egg was soft boiled properly and the yolk didn't disappoint. \\n\\nPotato Croquettes - A simple small plate, but I recommend it because it's really delicious. I enjoyed the contrast between the outer fried crispy texture and the inner soft texture. It comes with mayo which complemented the croquettes. For the set deal it comes with two potato croquettes. \\n\\nChicken Karaage - this was just okay. A little bland and maybe a little too chunky? I would have appreciated smaller crispier pieces. This is also served with mayo. They give a good amount for the set. I was expecting 3 or 4 pieces but they actually give you about 8 pieces. Next time though I would opt for a different appetizer.\\n\\nMy friend had the Chicken Shio ramen and she enjoyed it as well. She said the broth was flavorful and creamy.\\n\\nIn the end my friend and I were both over-stuffed from the Ramen Set. It is a great deal, but we were too ambitious and didn't expect to receive such generous portion sizes. If you are dining with another person I suggest getting one Ramen Set + one bowl of Ramen. This way you both can have a bowl of ramen for yourselves, split the appetizer and small plate, and still feel satisfied from your meal.\\n\\nOverall, I'm really happy to find a new go-to ramen spot!

Thai friends have told me this is the place to go, and so I was pretty excited about coming here.  Sadly, my experience was disappointing.  It was both a combination of poor service and low food quality and taste which warrant this low rating.  Honestly, I think my neighborhood Thai restaurant in Watertown, namely O-Sha does a much better job.  The only reason why this place has survived is because of it's good location with college students and not too far from office buildings.    \\n\\nFirstly, I understand the concept that it's similar to Rod Dee and Dumpling Daughter in that you order at the front and then pick up your food.  I've done that other places before, so I get it.  For some reason, at this place, there is lack of hospitality, lack of friendliness, or even a smile it seems.  I've never been to a Thai restaurant where the FOH staff seem grumpy and annoyed at taking your order.  I had a toddler with me, was dining with a friend, and trying to juggle that with questions regarding their menu.  \\n\\nAfter I order, the food comes out and the cashier was shouting out my number.  There weren't that many people in the restaurant.  I was surprised that they didn't just bring it to me.  Especially, considering that there were three staff members at the front, the restaurant wasn't that busy, I was not that far away, and had a small child with me.  I did leave them a $5 tip when I signed for my credit card slip.  So, I was really disappointed.  \\n\\nAlso, the food was probably the most boring Thai food I've ever tasted.  None of the flavors popped.  Everything seemed kind of bland.  My Indonesian fried rice had one extremely spicy kick b/c the chef didn't evenly cook the sauce thoroughly.  Like another reviewer mentioned, the meat/chicken in my dish was tasteless and chewy, not how fresh chicken tastes like.  \\n\\nOverall, totally not worth the drive and metered parking that I had to go through to come here.  If I were to come again, I would definitely have to go with a Thai friend to order for me off their Thai menu.

Kindly requested the server to find some bigger table. Now the service manager shows up. He, in the most unprofessional way made clear to us this is the table because the restaurant was apparently fully booked - on a Monday evening (after school has started already in Florida). It should have been a most memorable experience for the Birthday person from Europe. It all failed - we had to leave the restaurant and find another one - fortunately, Waldorf Astoria's Bull&Baer restaurant had a big enough table right away and the service there was excellent!! I give the 1 star only because I had good experience at CAPA during 2 prior visits - not for this embarrassing experience on Aug 14, 2017 - that would have been a zero clearly!

So we decided to give it another shot. \\n\\nFirst of all- I don't want this restaurant to go under. So much that I'm writing my first Yelp review. \\n\\nThe food and drinks are SO good. The biscuits are some of the best things we've ever eaten. The homemade butter and jam was unreal. And the chicken sandwiches are to die for. The spicy version doesn't add that much spice but adds tremendous flavor. The pickles just top the whole sandwich off (wish I had ordered extra).\\n\\nWith that being said, we came back the next night (they also have an awesome weekday deal with dollar apps and other discounted menu items).

I've had experience working as a waitress and a host and this place would've made me rip my hair out if I had to work here. We were sitting at the service end of the bar so we saw this shit show go down first hand. \\n\\nWe witnessed:\\n- Customer sitting at a nearly empty bar waiting for an unreasonable amount of time to just be greeted. And left without ordering anything saying he felt \\"ignored.\\" (Kinda dramatic dude but I get it)\\n- Drinks sitting at the service bar for over 20 minutes (so long that the customer came up almost behind the bar to ask where the f her drinks were)\\n- Inconsistent pours (if I had received that wine glass that was filled 1/4 of the way up I would've been very disappointed)\\n- The bar was packed the second night we were there but that didn't stop the bartender (who might I add has been working there for 5 days) from ripping shots with her annoying friends and ignoring customers at the bar). \\n- The TVs weirdly face the bar? And my boyfriend wanted to watch football but they had Netflix on instead because the credit card on there cable package wasn't working? I don't even know. \\n\\nSILVER LINING- Michelle (the new bar manager who has only been there a week) made us killer drinks and was fun to talk to. Too bad she had absolutely ZERO support from other staff members.

The decor is intimate and upscale, with a rustic features. Reservations are definitely recommended. The dress code isn't that strict but you shouldn't be too casual. \\n\\nThe menu is seasonal so it does change. For our appetizer, we decided to go with the kangaroo because how often does one see kangaroo on a menu? It was sliced and served medium rare and was delicious. It tastes very similar to a beef steak and wasn't as gamey as I assumed kangaroo would be. We definitely recommend this when it is on the menu. \\n\\nAs for entrees, the duck breast and rabbit are great choices. For the rabbit, the meat was very tender and literally melts in your mouth. As for bread, the waiters carry around a tray of different options and you just pick as they come around. All of the bread options were delicious to us.\\n\\nFor desserts, we tried the chocolate grotto and pumpkin creme brulee. The grotto was ok, a little too dark for our taste but the pumpkin creme brulee was something else. It was around Thanksgiving when we went and the flavors really matched the season. Try it for a different spin on your typical creme brulee. \\n\\nOf course, Canoe is not the cheapest of dining options but if you're willing to spend the money, it will not disappoint.

You wait in line at the counter to order and then take a seat in the interestingly decorated dining room (or outside in the garden) to wait for your food. We sat on this plush red chair/bench.\\n\\nFOOD:\\nI order the migas breakfast plate which came with potatoes and refried beans (potatoes were nothing special but everything else was great). I have learned to love migas on my time here in Austin and this certainly helped with that. I used the delicious tortillas to make tacos for myself. Being the Tamale House, I of course had to get the pork tamale, which was also great. I will say, every time I get a tamale, I wish there was more meat to the corn since you end up just getting big bites of the corn on the corners but it was still delicious.

A secret about salads isn't so sexy or salacious, but I'll tell you what... the salads are good. \\n\\nI honestly expected the non-sandwich options here to be an afterthought. Why? Well, a lot of places put 110% into their main event items, and build out the rest of the menu to simply satisfy the niche desires of +1's, hangers on, or people who don't understand what they really should be ordering. The investment isn't there. \\n\\nAnd then there's me. I don't show up at steak restaurants expecting vegetarian fare, or vice versa.

And while normally I'd hit up SU&E for their bomb-diddly-omb sados, I am super glad I tried out their salad menu. Specifically the Caesar, which is only a Caesar in name. This thick mess of goodness is based around spinach with a creamy dressing, sliced zucchini and croutons. Chicken add-on is a must, and they use a nice, moist pulled chicken for that (no dry-ass grilled breast). Oh, and their chili? It's tasty. \\n\\nI've been driving past this joint and shedding a single tear ever since I switch my diet and nixed the sandwiches. But now I know. The secret is out.

She claimed they were out of it and had dispatched another waiter to inform us. The waiter she tried to blame it on came and told us he had cancelled it because it was taking too long. Their stories didn't match, and when asked again, our original waitress said \\"it's 45$ anyway. That's super expensive.\\" Oh, I'm sorry, I didn't realize you were also my part time financial advisor. \\n\\nThe waitress we had was overall rude and crass. She kept bumping into our elbows at the table and not acknowledging it. She also spilled a good bit of food and just left the spill there throughout the entire course of the meal. She also had an excuse for everything. We ordered a chicken which came out plainer than day. When we asked about it, she said, \\"this is what you ordered. This is how it comes.\\" We argued that it shouldn't have absolutely no flavor to which she responded, \\"this is how the Chinese like to eat their chicken.\\"\\n\\nThe manager brought out free dessert soup as compensation. When we wanted to double check the 45$ Chilean sea bass was not charged on our check, the waitress threw a fit and said \\"of course I took it off.\\" In her defense, she must be super stressed out working three jobs as a waitress, financial advisor, and full blown butthole."},{"name":"Panera Bread","address":"10230 SW Washington Square Rd","city":"Tigard","stars":"3","text":"The woman working behind the counter was really annoyed with us when we were trying to decide what to order.

After a couple of bites, he sent it back and exchanged it for a corned beef and Swiss sandwich that was not a Reuben.  We had that wrapped to go.  \\n\\nI ordered the Caprese salad with medium rare steak tips (that didn't turn out too badly) and, 40 minutes or so after ordering, I had to ask what was taking so long.  The waitress told me they were working on the steak tips and I had  to remind her that I ordered medium-rare, not well done (thank heavens I didn't have to rush back to the office).\\n\\nFor dessert, we split a Turtle cheesecake that was as boring as everything else. \\n\\nI don't know what the problem is but, with so many dining options, this isn't where I'll go back to eat unless I'm desperate or ever have one too many and anything will do.

What did you expect, the ritz?  You get what you pay for.  Second, to those reviews citing their \\"no credit cards:\\" LRN 2 READ.  Says it on the door when you walk in, says it on their menus.\\n\\nI really wanted to give this place 4 stars, but just couldn't justify it after my meal.  When you walk in, take a seat anywhere that strikes your fancy.  Mine is somewhat by the window, as I can people watch in two directions as well as keep an eye on the sports on TV (go Nuggets!).  Presently a server will be along to get you drinks and food.  You won't be able to tell who's a server when you walk in, as the only thing that really differentiates them from local patrons is the fact that they're moving around more.  Take that time to read through the beer list in their book - it's extensive, and gives a description of how all the different types of beers are made and what their flavors are like - also good reading while waiting for food, if you're there alone.\\n\\n(Side rant: Why the hell is alcohol so damn expensive in Boston?  Is it some weird east-coast thing?  Forgive a Colorado boy, but drinks here are about $2-3 more than I'm used to paying, which is bad because a) I therefore drink less, and b) being from a high altitude, it takes more alcohol to get me drunk at sea level.  Losses all the way around.)\\n\\nThe food is decent, burgers at least are nothing really special.  To be honest, I found it a bit overpriced: a beer + a cheeseburger with fries (and not many of them at that) + tip came to about $19.  That's too much for what the food was.  I ordered the burger medium, but it seemed to come medium-well or well; I couldn't really tell due to the poor lighting at night.  Luckily, I was raised on well-done, so it still tasted delicious, but it just seemed there wasn't enough of it.  One pickle slice?  Come on.\\n\\nSo why the 3 stars?  If the food and beer are worth two, then the atmosphere surely deserves at least one more.  It's a great local hangout place, packed with interesting people and their conversations, pleasant and with good music - it can get a bit loud but at least it's good.  Servers were friendly.

The food is always so delicious and today was no exception. However, there was one employee today who ruined the entire visit for us. I came in with my family and was looking at the menu for 15 seconds when he told me to come to the counter to order.  I told him I wasn't quite ready (we had 6 people) and didn't want to hold up his line.  He stared at me and said...\\"I can't hear anything you're saying.\\" OK! He then proceeded to say \\"I can dish you up as much as a little as you would like!\\" Great! I started by asking 2 oz of brisket.  He put 8 oz. on the scale.  When I questioned it, he got super snippy and said \\"I only know pounds, not ounces.\\" Uh alrighty! He rushed us along super fast and piled double of what we asked for on the scale for every type of meat.  The last thing I asked for was a small piece of Salmon and he put a whole piece (maybe 7 oz) on the scale.  I kindly asked if he could cut it in half (which was still more than I wanted) and the guy rolled his eyes and sighed at me.  I had had it with his 3rd grade behavior and asked \\"Does it annoy you that I asked you to cut it in half?\\" His reply....\\"Ya it does, but I'll do it.\\" I wished I just would have walked out at that point.  The cashier was super nice but would not tell me the name of the guy who had taken our order. We did have an employee come talk to us (I didn't catch his name or title) and give us coupons and an apology, with a promise to talk to the offender. It was a nice gesture that we appreciated. We felt so uncomfortable sitting in the restaurant eating our food after we had been treated poorly. The icing on the cake was that this employee was making snarky comments the whole time we were there while serving other customers. I heard things like, \\"I can cut that smaller for you if you REALLLY need me to.\\" \\"We don't have any salmon left. Oh wait, yes I have a HAAALF of a piece.\\" 3 or 4 different comments.  It was really awful.  It made our family feel unwelcome and small. I couldn't get his name. He was young, clean shaven with glasses.

Pro-tip #2, check both sides of the menu; there are platters and a la carte items and you'll want to get a selection of both if you can. Pro-tip #3, get extra chips if you order the queso compuesto; the little basket is not enough!\\n\\nI followed Walker's advice and order the iced Mexican coffee with horchata -- perfect for a hot afternoon, and nicely followed by a dry Austin Eastcider.

I wrote a separate review for the event, but I figured I would also write a review about my food and experience here. \\n\\nI came in on a Friday evening (last week) and we already knew what we wanted to order. The employee working at the front taking our orders was trying to rush us and was being kind of rude. It was kind of jarring with that being our first interaction inside. I saw other reviews saying that the employee at the front was helpful and answering questions, but whoever was there that day was being kind of abrupt. When you come in, you order and they write it on their paper. \\n\\nFortunately, the guy working the register was very nice and had no problems with ringing us up. I ordered the Chipotle Mango Avocado bowl with shrimp and half greens/half rice. I did sub the cheese on top. My bf also got the same gusto flavor and 1/2 & 1/2, but with chicken. \\n\\nSo the chipotle sauce was so good. I scraped up even the last bit. I also loved the flavor of the shrimp, but my shrimp was cold, which was kind of a weird contrast with the warm rice. I loved the the flavor profile of this gusto. The mango, black bean corn salad, and avocado were really good. I would highly recommend this gusto. Bf liked his bowl too. The sweet potato chips are good as well. \\n\\nHowever, we felt the portions were a bit small as we could have eaten more. In addition, the main reason I had to take off stars was that the lettuce in my bowl was turning BROWN. A lot of the leaves, some of the edges were turning brown and some leaves were more brown. I picked those out and will attach photos. I was very disappointed because other people had said the greens here are very fresh. \\n\\nOverall, I do like the flavor of the bowl that I tried. Just some minor things that stop me from overall giving it more stars. This is a nice healthy option and it feels lighter than Chipotle. Also the parking lot in the back is great, but a bit tight. Be careful when going through because the cars passing each other were very close.

We gathered our group of 4 at the outdoor bar as it was super mild, beautiful summer night and it felt heavenly to be outside with a glass of rose in hand.  Delightful.\\n\\nThey came out to find us and tell us our table was ready, and I said \\"Really?  its so nice out...\\" hoping she'd get a hint that we wanted to finish our drinks outdoors, but instead, we followed her inside and up into the upper dining room to a table with no view.  Wumph wumph.  I looked at the birthday girl, who was shivering (the A/C was blasting in July style, but the weather was so cool outside, that it really made for a striking temperature change when we walked back in...), and asked the waitress if we could sit outside.  She said there would be a 30 minute wait, and we said no problem.  We went back to the river bar, ordered another round, and settled into the Adirondack chairs on the river to watch the ducks float by.  Perfection.  It very much felt like my happy place.\\n\\nMight I also pause here and give mega kudos to the bar staff at the river bar?  Super friendly and quick with refills.  I'd just sit out here in the future.\\n\\nOur table was on the outer edge of the patio, with primo views of the river and gardens.  Perfect birthday locale!  \\n\\nOur amazing waitress promptly showed up and walked us through the specials and menu.  She was an absolute star.  I truly credit her for making our Canoe experience so terrific.\\n\\nWe got a few appetizers, two of them being summer specials.  One of the specials, the heirloom tomato appetizer, was delicious.  It came with a tomato sorbet, feta, and beautiful tomato slices.  Deliciously light and flavorful.  The other special was georgia shrimp with asparagus and housemade banh mi sausage.  Also excellent - the shrimp were super plump and seasoned well and balanced perfectly against the asparagus and sausage.  \\n\\nThe app that stole the show was the smoked salmon.  OMMMMGGGGGG, this is delicious.  Get it.  Maybe even get it as your entree.  Its a can't miss item that I think has been on their menu since day one.  I usually do not enjoy smoked salmon at all so this speaks volumes to me giving it praise as a can't miss item!  Canoe takes a crispy hashbrown rosti base, some type of creamy herby cheese, and tops it with delicate smoked salmon.  The balance of textures and flavors is so satisfying and delicious.  It just tasted like summer, especially with a glass of rose.  \\n\\nI ordered the trout with lobster ravioli, which was also terrific.  It was a giant filet that could have been easily split with my spouse.  It was perfectly cooked and seasoned.  Absolutely delicious and the perfect meal for sitting outside in the summer.  The ravioli were really good, but there was a part of me that would have preferred the trout on a bed of grilled summer veggies.  I would definitely get this again, but I would want to split it.  Hubby had the duck burger, which was actually just okay (I think its a better idea in theory than in execution), but the fries were seriously delicious.\\n\\nBecause it was a birthday, we got a complimentary dessert with \\"happy birthday\\" on the plate.  We had a summer special - peach crisp with vanilla ice cream.  It was so delicious - great texture, great fresh peach flavor, yum.  We also had after dinner drinks and I praise my decaf cappuccino.  Yum.\\n\\nAll in all, it was a super relaxing perfect summer evening spent eating beautiful food that was fresh and in season.  I've gone ahead and booked out several reservations so I can get here more often and enjoy this beautiful location.  I know I haven't spoken about how beautiful Canoe is, but I don't need to - many other reviewers have beaten me to it and they do it justice.  I will note that I didn't notice any bugs and didn't get eaten alive while sitting outside - either at our table or on the river bank.  I'm not sure if the breeze was helping keep them at bay, but I didn't get bit once.\\n\\nI love it here - its like a sanctuary, just right outside the city.  It definitely deserves its top rating on Yelp as one of Atlanta's best!"},{"name":"Papi's Cuban & Caribbean Grill","address":"1540 Avenue Pl","city":"Decatur","stars":"3.5","text":"My office is near Papi's, so I've been quite a few times in the past couple of years.

They are also willing to accommodate special requests like switching out rice or beans for another side.\\nI've only ever gotten one thing at Papi's: the chicken tacos. What can I say? I'm a creature of habit. The taco platter includes 3 corn tortillas filled with your choice of meat, pico, and mozzarella. It comes with a side of spicy sauce. The platter also includes rice, beans, a side salad, and plantains. I usually switch out the rice for grilled veggies at no additional cost. P.S. - if you like garlic, order the veggies.

Let me tell you why.\\n\\nI may seem crazy for thinking this but I don't think pasta is great. THERE! I said it. It's a vehicle for other flavors and an unhealthy vehicle at that. I don't think I truly appreciate freshly made pasta. I would choose potatoes or rice 10/10 times over pasta.\\n\\nWith that being said, I came here with some coworkers for a work dinner on a Wednesday evening at 6 PM (it wasn't very busy but we did see a daddy-daughter date which was adorable!). I looked at the menu and saw that a bone-in pork chop was on the specials menu. I love a good Italian bone-in pork chop (I had an amazing one at Carmelina's) so I thought I would be ordering it. However, on Wednesdays at Capo, for $30, you can do all-you-can-eat pasta and try different types each time (except the lobster gnocchi). This ain't your Olive Garden all-you-can-eat folks! I announced that I was considering it to the group and a coworker who doesn't know me very well said \\"You don't look like you can eat a lot.\\" Bear in mind, I am a skinny guy; however, that is thanks in large part to my Usain Bolt-esque metabolism (and my general sense for eating healthfully). Eating large portions is something I pride myself on and I wasn't about to let my coworker besmirch my name. Not today. Not ever. So though I probably would have enjoyed the pork chop more, I went with the all-you-can-eat pasta.\\n\\nI started with a full portion of the Short Rib Ravioli. That was my first mistake...always do the half portions for this so you can try as many flavors as you can (like tapas but pasta tapas). It was rich and delicious and I scarfed it down pretty quickly. To my surprise, the waiter was actually really attentive and as I was almost done with it, the waiter came by to ask if he should put another pasta order in. This time, I went with the Sausage and Cavatelli, but only a half portion. The sausage was well-cooked and the vodka sauce was creamy. I can't decide if I liked this or the Short Rib Ravioli better. By the time I finished the second plate, I could feel my stomach slightly full...maybe because it was a lot of pasta and I'm not used to eating pasta but I was more full than I expected. I did eat a big lunch...maybe that was filling me up! Anyway, I couldn't let myself call it quits after 2 plates, NO SIR! So I ordered a half portion of the Cacio E Pepe which everyone seems to gush over (not at Capo specifically but the dish in general). It came and by this time, I was overloaded on salty, savory, umami that it was just hard to eat. The mushrooms were so salty that I just wanted to devour some ice cream to counteract the saltiness (don't worry, we ordered ice cream later). I finish most of the plate (except the salty mushrooms) and put my napkin on the table in surrender. I felt I had sufficiently impressed my coworkers with my eating ability, the irrational goal of the evening.\\n\\nThen we ordered dessert and that secret compartment in my stomach opened up...we ordered the mini cannolis (YUM!), the Nutella gelato (good not great), and the salted caramel parfait (also good not great). I had bites of it all. You truly have a second stomach for dessert (ask a doctor). I would have gone with the cheesecake (I'm a cheesecake guy) but now that's just something to go back for.\\n\\nThe next morning, I was still so full that I skipped breakfast after my workout (and I NEVER skip breakfast) which I think shows how full I was. When I said at the beginning that I don't think I gave Capo a fair chance, it's because I ordered all-you-can-eat pasta and I don't really love pasta. I think it warrants a trip back to get that pork chop and the cheesecake. Time to plan my next trip back."},{"name":"Nikki Sushi & Steak","address":"15135 SW Barrows Rd, Ste 145","city":"Beaverton","stars":"3.5","text":"A friend had recommended I come here, and mentioned that they had a private room that would be perfect for my 32nd birthday.

Everything had the same sweet flavor. On may 8 I decided to give it another try. I ordered the Laksa. Being from Singapore, I was looking forward to a rich coconut based broth but what I got was most disappointing. The broth was very watery and did not have any coconut milk in the broth. I told the waitress and she asked if I would like a little coconut milk on the side to add to the broth. I said that would be perfect. Shortly after another lady (I assumed her to be the Mgr) came and told me that they did not have coconut milk on hand. The broth comes premade from their 'prep factory'. I asked if everything came that way and she said 'mostly yes'. The Laksa was not bad but lacked flavor. I also ordered the Vietnamese iced coffee which was very watered down and lacking in condensed milk. I ordered Roti Canai, their family recipe curry (I forgot the name) and the Duck Congee to go. The roti is ok but when I got home, the curry sauce had already congealed and was just ok in taste. The duck congee was surprisingly good but the curry was very salty and there was no rice to accompany the curry. The Chinese grocery store carries Laksa from Prima taste and has everything except the noodles and the broth is so much better than what is supposedly fresh cooked at Hawkers. \\n\\nI've had the Hokkien Mee and the Mee Goreng and they both had the same flavor and was sweet. Totally different than what I grew up eating!!\\n\\nI know a lot of people love the place but I believe that Hawkers is just an Americanized version of classic hawker food from Singapore Malaysia and Southeast Asia. \\n\\nI do not care to go back and would rather go to Mamak or cook it myself."},{"name":"Panera Bread","address":"10230 SW Washington Square Rd","city":"Tigard","stars":"3","text":"Ordered bagel and coffee.

The food, beers, dessert, and service were on point. We loved the relaxing and casual atmosphere of the place.\\n\\nGot a tray of the Brewer's Choice for the table; the number 2 and 6 were our favorites. We liked the lightness and citrusy note of the two beers.\\n\\nFor food, we started with the Salmon Rillette; super light and delicious. It came with a side of crispy bagels and pumpernickel bread. The rillette was meaty with shredded salmon pieces. The pickled red onion and capers balance the saltiness of the salmon perfectly.\\n\\nFor entrees, we got 3 different dishes to share: the Oregon Halibut, the Smoked Pork & Grits, and the Blackberry Shrimp Salad. Although we loved all 3 dishes, the Smoked Pork & Grits surprised us the most and was our favorite! It looked super simple but the flavor was amazing. The shredded pork shoulder was super tender; this went surprisingly well with the smooth and velvety grits at the bottom of the dish. \\n\\nThe Halibut was also very tasty; the fish was cooked just right and still moist inside. I especially loved the creamy sauce and sauteed veggies at the side. The Blackberry Shrimp Salad was refreshing with the blackberries that packed a fruity note to the salad in addition to the sweetness from the candied hazelnuts and the creaminess from the cojita cheese. The shrimps were slightly heavily grilled, bringing out a nice, smoky taste to them.\\n\\nMy parents also shared the Keylime Icebox Pie which was gigantic but they still managed to finish it all - they really loved it.\\n\\nThis place should be a go-to place to tourists and even locals in Portland! 10/10 would reccommend!"},{"name":"Vinito Ristorante","address":"4971 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"We are visiting Orlando for the weekend and stumbled upon Vinito for dinner tonight (Friday night).

We decided to get there early and grab some drinks at the outside rooftop patio which was a great idea. \\n\\nThe cocktails are all crafted with great taste and presentation. Pricey, but they are strong and made with all too shelf liquor. I tried the \\"Spanish old fashioned\\" with Old Overholt Rye, Torres 5yr Brandy, Walnut-Vermouth Ice, Smoked Glass, Gold. Absolutely delicious and strong. The gold gave it a nice touch and by the end of the drink it finished like a Manhattan. I also had the vodka blueberry drink which was lighter and sweet. After drinks our table was ready. \\n\\nWe went inside and had a great table at a window, perfect for seeing the fireworks. Loved the open kitchen concept and romantic ambiance, only adding more to this unforgettable dining experience. Our waiter was extremely knowledgeable about the menu and gave great suggestions when ordering. I went with the filet which was perfectly cooked to my liking. Get the mashed potatoes, you will not be disappointed. Creamiest I have ever had and probably the best I've had so far compared to other fine dining steakhouses in the area. We were then dismissed to the patio for fireworks viewing. When we came back, a complimentary birthday dessert was at the table. \\n\\nOverall, I can't say anything better about Capa.

I was a bit disappointed with it;\\n- shrimp dumplings - these are hard to mess up. They always taste the same no matter where you go. A very reliable item, one of my faves;\\n- pork and chicken dumplings - meh. Not a fan. These lacked flavor and had soggy peanuts inside. You may like it if you are into boiled peanuts, which I'm not;\\n- some kind of a pork bun thing (I'm lacking terminology here), fried and looked like a dumpling. Interesting.. The dough was a bit sweet and sticky inside and crispy fried on the outside, the pork didn't taste like pork. I wan't a fan of this one;\\n- spicy pork ribs - decent taste and flavor, just too many bones. Actually, mostly bones;\\n- rice in banana leaf - this one is one of my \\"must order\\" dishes and they did a decent job;\\n- mango pudding - LOVE this one. They stopped making it a few months ago so I stopped coming here. So glad they brought it back. No other dim sum places in the are have it. Do order it!\\n- red bean sweet pudding. A-ok.

I ordered the grilled steak rice dish.\\n\\nThe pho arrived after the two chicken and vegetable dishes. The chicken in everything was over cooked for us but the ginger and garlic sauces were very tasty.  We loved the broth in the pho, rich and flavorful but not salty. The pad Thai was excellent with the exception of the chicken being over cooked. My getting grilled steak contained some good pieces but some tough ones too. I would've preferred it medium rare but it came more medium well.

If like mediocre pizza, chopped hamburger toppings as a salad, and 24 taps of local session beers (with not one single tap of anything special), this place is great. Unfortunately for them, there's too much competition in this exact market with better pizza and a better beer selection. It feels like they're piggybacking on the pizza + beer place trend, but it's clear their heart isn't really in either. \\n$40 for a calzone, small pizza, one beer, and a house salad...just not a great value when none of them are great quality. Pizza crust is bland and took up at least 40% of the pizza real estate. House salad was chopped iceberg lettuce (not \\"lettuce mix\\" as indicated), tomatoes, cheddar cheese, and diced red onion and green bell pepper with croutons. I may take the rest home to put on a burger or feed to a rabbit. I will say that the basil & goat cheese calzone was on point (8/10).

Recently, I came again with a group of friends. They frequent Basil Thai pretty often, so they all recommended the lemongrass broth to me. I definitely enjoyed my second time here a lot more. I ordered corn, basil, fish tofu, beef meatballs, quail eggs, ramen noodles, and a couple of other ingredients that I can't remember. The lemongrass broth is really good. I'm not typically a fan of sour broths, but it's probably their best (I tried the other broths from my friends' hot pots). I also like their Mala spicy broth, but it's a bit too spicy for me to order on my own. \\n\\nThe price is pretty expensive for hot pot. Each individual hot post probably costs them about $2 to make, but they uncharge up to $14. I think you are better off making your own hot pot at home because all of the ingredients are incredibly cheap.

I don't know if it is because we came in at 9:00 PM on a Thursday, or if something else was off-balance, but the pizza was a let-down. We got two pizzas. One with artichoke and another Hawaiian style. They were reminiscent of a cheap delivery joint, like Little Caesars or Gattis. The toppings seemed fine, but the crust was almost worse than the delivery joints.  The photos of the pizzas and crusts in the Yelp reviews, look great. But they don't look anything like what we actually received the night we went. I can only speculate that perhaps because it was the end of the day, maybe they ran out of the good crust and used a \\"backup\\" crust?  Either that, or they accidentally gave us a gluten-free crust? I really don't know.  Sad to say, we were disappointed.  \\n\\nIt wasn't all bad, the house salad with a wine-vinaigrette was good. They have a nice selection of beers and ciders on tap and natural sodas on tap. The place itself is lovely and has a nice outdoor patio.

I have come here for almost 10+ years and still have never had the desire to eat it any less then beforehand. When you think of a good place to eat, they specialize in a certain form of cuisine or dish. This place has to be those noodles and I could eat it everyday if I had to. So it begs the question, if the noodles are that good, why not give it a perfect score. I will explain all of that in the conclusion.\\n\\nService: Always good here. There has never been an issue. Most of workers are usually foreign and don't speak English as their first language. Aside from all that, you can still understand and have conversations with them without having the need to explain or articulate yourself multiple times. They make an effort to make sure you have what you need.\\n\\nAtmosphere: Cool and different. It's a smaller place to eat then normal places and a pretty narrow/linear restaurant. One of the cooler parts however is when you sit towards the bar or behind the bar, you can see the chef's cooking their meals and pulling their special hand-pulled noodles. You can see your meals being prepped or what type of food they serve to help you make your hungry decision on food to intake.\\n\\nFood: Perfection. The noodles are amazing. They are just too good. There's never been a time that the noodles fall short in a certain category. They are one of my favorite dishes to eat, dare if I say ever. not just in Oregon. The other dishes I have tried here are Galbi/Fried Rice/Dumplings and they are all good as well, but you gotta come here to eat their noodles; that's the special dish! The only gripe I have is that the noodles come in 5 categories of spice, and sometimes the variety of spice can change. You can order Medium spicy and it'll be either too spicy one day or too mild the next. More times then not you will get the spice you asked for, but there are definitely incidences where they are more/less spicier then the last visit.\\n\\nNow with all that being said, why not a perfect 5? Here's the thing, as a small business there have been a few business decisions that make it hard to give this place a perfect score. An example would have to be their hours. They usually change their hours on any given notice and sometimes take unexpected vacations for long periods of time. They left for Korea over winter break and closed the business down for several months and it can definitely get irritating AT times; however I understand that this is a small business. Another thing that can be frustrating is ordering to-go food. They will sometimes randomly never pick up the phone because it can be busy which is understandable or the order could take well over an hour to create. There will also be times when they pick up an hour or 30 minutes before they close and they will decline to go-orders or even close the WHOLE store early altogether because the day was slower earlier and they assume it will continue as such. Those are my main gripes with the place, otherwise it's a fantastic place to meet your hungry desires and leave happy."},{"name":"Capo Restaurant","address":"443 West Broadway","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Personally I liked the food but they don't let anyone downstairs to have fun - their main appeal - for over 4 hours after their meal"},{"name":"The Hills Market","address":"7860 Olentangy River Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"I didn't get a chance to explore the market on my first visit, but I did have their pizza for a charity event, and it was fantastic!

We watched the Cosby Show, the show that taught every suburban honky that black people were just like us, except richer and with uglier sweaters.  \\n\\nMaybe back in the day, black people had special pizza.  They were rich, after all.  But we lower-middle-class white folks had pepperoni and we liked it.  It was better than plain cheese, which was the only other choice.  Pepperoni or cheese, and if you wanted it healthy you could damn well blot the grease off with a napkin before you ate it.\\n\\nNow I'm a yuppie and pizza has changed.  Nobody orders pepperoni anymore. You try to order pizza at a party and there's a cacophony of special needs.  \\"I want white sauce and whole wheat crust!\\" \\"I want the cajun chicken special!\\"  \\n\\nI order from Pizza Pie-er all the time, because I'm a yuppie.  And the other day I opened the door and found out that I'd bought a pizza Al Noci and something called a Brimp, and I owed forty-five dollars.  The Al Noci had walnut sauce and spinach on it, and the Brimp had shrimp and broccoli, and this cost me $45. Forty-five dollars, is what two pizzas cost me.\\n\\nI'm asking you, when did pizza places convince us that we wanted them to invent some gourmet shit for us? When did they convince us that pizza was a $45 proposition?  \\n\\nWhen I was in college, and a bunch of us were sitting around drinking and acting like assholes and we realized we needed food, we would get some pizza because it was greasy and cheap, so it smoothed our drunkenness and we still had money for the bar.  Now I sit around with the same fuckin' people doing the same damn thing, but we spend three times the money and get one third the grease.  It doesn't even do the job any more!  This ain't comfort food, yo. This is healthy.  \\n\\nAnd Pizza Pie-er is the epitome of yuppie pizza pretentiousness.  Their crust has these weird grains on the bottom that feel like they're probably good for you.  There's no grease to speak of.  And here's a direct quote from their menu: \\"The perfect pizza is an extension of you.  And because there are no limits to your individuality, we offer a virtually endless variety of pizzas.\\"  \\n\\nNow let me ask you: is the perfect pizza an extension of You?  If it is, then you and I will not get along.  Because I do not need pizza to extend me.  I don't need it to reflect me in any way.  Pizza is not where I express my individuality.\\n\\nIt's time to say it: If we wanted health food, we wouldn't order pizza.  If we wanted everyone in the house to teach us about themselves, we wouldn't order pizza.  Pizza is default food.  It comes in pepperoni and plain cheese.  If you're feeling adventurous I won't hold some green peppers and onions against you.  Go crazy, man, order some Hawaiian shit.  But brothers and sisters, let's not talk about puttanesca sauce.  Let's not talk about cajun chicken specials.  \\n\\nSo much of life is complicated.  I still don't know why black people like such ugly sweaters.  But pizza is universal.  Let's keep it that way."},{"name":"Serranos","address":"5030 Hwy 290 W","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"If I had remembered to check in every time we went to Serranos in the past 2-3 years, I'd have 100 check ins here.

I added potatoes to the cheese quesadilla this trip - they rang it up as beef fajita quesadillas.  They actually brought me beef fajita quesadillas with potatoes after I said I was trying something different and meatless.  :/  The waiter just assumed I'd want it.  He said that.  There was no apology from the waiter for his incorrect assumption. The quesadilla was unreasonably soaked in grease and 1/2 of the potatoes were raw on the inside.  They used to make fantastic breakfast potatoes any time of day.  \\n\\nIn general, the husband and I both have found the staff to not listen well and this last guy argued with my husband about what he said.

Unfortunately, it fell short. Must believe positive reviews are due to the food and not service.  The food was very good overall..duck liver pate as appetizer-outstanding; Wagyu  meatballs--perfect! Seafood dishes very good with beautiful presentation. Where it falls short is with service and consistency.  Obvious this restaurant has many \\"regulars\\" and servers cater to them. We had a relatively new server (he stated a few months). Started out well enough but by the main entree service started to slip. I must state we arrived at 5:20 pm for a 5:30 pm reservation. We departed a few minutes after 7:00 pm...(appetizer, salad, entree & dessert).  After the entree there was no breathing room before our desserts were dropped on the table. I would have expected someone to clear the table (crumbs and all), present dessert flatware and ASK if we were ready for our desserts, coffee or after dinner drinks.  Desserts were also presented in error (we corrected) and waited several minutes until we saw our server.   Inquired about coffee and was told ok but we will have to brew a pot!  Once the coffee came, there were grounds in the coffee and no spoon to accompany the coffee. I pointed out the deficiencies, server apologized and returned with another cup of coffee & went back for spoon. Driving home my spouse mentioned, another table asked to substitute the salad on the flavor of the month menu along with entree changes.  They were accommodated.  When my spouse asked if he could pay extra for 2 more wagyu meatballs as part of the appetizer, he was told \\"No\\".  There was no substitutions, up charges or changes allowed on the menu.

The reviews on here are great and people often rave about how amazing the food is here.  I finally decided to give it a try.\\n\\nFull Disclosure - I am not really a big fan of Asian cuisine.  Chicken Satay, Pork Tacos, Pot Stickers are ok but not much more adventurous than that.  I  figured ok well if they are SOO good here then the Asian items I like should be amazing.  Sadly, I did not personally find that to be the case.\\n\\nThe restaurant was full as expected for a Friday evening. The building has tall ceilings and a lot of metal inside so it was pretty loud inside.  We were told 30 minute wait and we provided our phone number to be texted when a table was available.  We walked outside and less than 3 minutes later we were being seated.  GREAT !  Basically it was no wait!  Lucky !\\n\\nAs mentioned over a thousand times, they serve small plates.  I really like this idea so you can go with a group and all try different things and if you really like something you can get a second plate.  Cafe Tu Tu Tango is one of my favorites!  That said there were several items we tried out.\\n\\nCoconut Shrimp - Found it a bit dry and the dipping sauce not very tasty\\n\\nSpring Rolls - Over/Under cooked ?  I am not really sure since Asian food is not my forte but they were super soggy outside and the veggies inside were close to raw.  Again - no idea if this is how it was supposed to be but we did not like them at all.\\n\\nPot Sticker - Ok taste but one side was burned a bit and the other side was pretty soggy.  My previous experience with Pot Stickers were that they were prepared boiled and you got them soft or they were pan fried (both sides) for a crispier version.  The ones were were half and half which again just confused and they tasted \\"OK\\" but nothing that I would want more of.\\n\\nChicken Tacos - There just was not a lot of meat on them in my opinion.  What was there was WAAAY over seasoned for my taste.\\n\\nBeef Tacos - Meat was hot but they put an ICE COLD sauce on it.  Again just not what I expected.\\n\\nWe pretty much gave up and just said we were done and got the check and left.  We never got our drinks refilled and our waitress often did not bring the food to the table so she was pretty much missing in action for most of the meal.\\n Again Full Disclosure I don't typically eat a lot of Asian food so perhaps it was all exactly as it was supposed to be and it was a personal thing.  Obviously with 1200 reviews and a 4 star rating they must be doing something right.

He only cleaned half the table (leaving crumbs behind) and the crumbs he did remove from the table he brushed onto the booth seat and left them there.  The area we were seated in was to the left of the bar in a little square section with tables, and there were about 15 people standing in there drinking and talking. For a second I thought they were all together- because they were all jammed in a little area- but they were not. Regardless...there were people standing all around our table which meant that I felt crowded and we could barely hear each other speak. Mind you there was a large section of open tables in an area that was not crowded so another cudos to the host for that. To make matters worse our server (the same one who was arguing with the host) took 15 minutes to come to our table. Maybe it was because she couldn't see us through the crowd or maybe because she was still pissed off...I don;t know. I got the feeling that the place was poorly managed so that is probably why she was upset to begin with. Once she came, the service was prompt and friendly (I must admit). The food was over priced, mediocre pub food at best and there were flies bothering us throught the meal (probably from all the crumbs on the seats).  The bar itself is decent. It's a nice dark wood and has seating all around it. There is a cozy section that has a fireplace (but we didn't get to experience that) and they have a pool table and keg tables in another section- which makes for a fun / party atmosphere. There is nothing interesting to look at as far as decor but that's par for the course for any so so pub so although it has potential, the place really doesn't have any character. Like it was built by comittee instead of by a person with a heart and soul.\\nThe whole time we were there we watched as one of the bartenders socialized with her friends and completely igniored the other people who wanted drinks at the bar. I suggest sitting near one of the male bartenders if you want service. Then there is the goon at the front door ie: security?? He was about as friendly as a skin rash. We saw him when he walked in and he never greeted us so I thought he was just waiting to leave but when he was still standing there when we left I realized he worked there. If you are going to stand there all night, the least you can do is open the door. All in all it was the staff who ruined our visit.\\nI suggest if you do go there, just order drinks (or use the keg tables) and play pool but it's in no mans land so on second thought...don't bother. It's not worth it. We won't be back. My guess is it will be closed in a year or two."},{"name":"Stella Public House","address":"1905 Aldrich St, Ste 110","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"We wandered into this place given its super close proximity to The Thinkery.

I've been a fan of Wayne's for literally YEARS, and I'm just getting around to writing my review. What am I thinking!?\\n\\nTo start, my first experience at Wayne's was well before their expansion; the restaurant was maybe half the size, and the same dudes were always working when boyfriend and I would drop in for some of their super bomb bbq. So nice, so friendly, and so chill. Loved every moment of every experience there. Since their expansion, I've only been in a couple of times, but haven't at all been disappointed during any one of my visits. \\n\\nSo down to the nitty gritty. \\n\\nThe restaurant is located in a large shopping center, and is one of only a handful of choices in the area; the shopping center is huge, so parking has absolutely never ever been an issue. He storefront boasts a humble facade (does that statement contradict itself?!), and shares its walls with small businesses on either side. \\n\\nWalking into the new, larger dining area, there are a bunch of family-style, community picnic type tables for everyone to pop a squat at, and a smaller number of more isolated table/booth seats for small parties. The decor is straight up Texan; I think every photo in the place is referencing a Texas bbq place! It's fun and quirky, but sooo not the focal point, though, because... hello... BARBECUE!?\\n\\nThe process of ordering is always super easy. The menu is crazy straightforward, and they're on top of letting guests know what is and is not available; I'm sure I'll mention this more than once, but all meats are cooked fresh DAILY, and they have a limited supply of everything, so the key is to get in early to make sure you fill your belly with exactly what you want. Anyway, after you decide on your choice of meat, you'll let them know the weight you're interested in having, and then scooch on down the line to choose the yummy sides that will accompany your delish protein. \\n\\nLike I said l, stuff sells out, so in addition to choice of meat, depending on the time you're there, your choice of a side might not be as expansive as you may be expecting. I've always gone with either coleslaw, homemade Mac and cheese, or baked beans (with super yummy green chilis in it!!), or a combination of the aforementioned. You'll then be asked if you're interested in a complimentary piece of Texas toast - not toasted lol - decide on drinks, pay, and then get to feast. \\n\\nI am usually a sucker for their juicy pork shoulder or roasted turkey (YUUUUUUM), and my main squeeze is a lean brisket fan. We both love the mac and cheese, but I flip flop between coleslaw and the green chili baked beans; he USUALLY opts for the coleslaw, but I digress. \\n\\nThe food is soooo yummy, the staff is nice as I'll get out, the atmosphere is chill, and prices aren't too terribly crazy (maybe $25-$30 for two people).

It's always hot and melty with a soft crust and it's plenty of food. Paired with a salad (I like the caesar dressing they use) it's a good sized lunch for me.\\n\\nOne thing I've noticed here that I haven't seen at other Schmizza locations -- and maybe I just haven't been to a different location in a while -- is they have some kind of blazing hot turbo oven, because there is no waiting for a slice.

Atlanta has really remade itself into a food capital with cuisine from all over. Foodies from around the country are knocking on the door to experience the new tastes here in the Georgia capital. \\n\\nUmi came very highly recommended by people who live here and of course through Yelp. Given that I was looking for something truly special the other night, I decided to venture out from the city center and give this place a try. Even for a table of one, I needed a reservation so that I could sit at the bar and have the omakase. It was well worth it!\\n\\nNestled in what I am not learning is the Buckhead area, Umi matches the style of cuisine that you would expect to find in a region like this. It's upscale, modern and caters to those who are true foodies and are willing to pay a pretty penny. That being said, it hasn't stopped those who have no knowledge about sushi (not to say I'm a professional but I know enough to only come here to drink miso soup and a rainbow roll). \\n\\nMany chefs once they become well known, they try to extricate themselves from the scene and leave it to their apprentices to feed the restaurant patrons. Not true with Chef Ito who is front and center. If you are interested in the omakase, then you should let them know when you make the reservation. As people have eluded to, there are 3 tiers here with the Ito-Kase being the most expensive (typically around $150 but varies with the MP of the fish). Omakase is by definition \\"chef's choice\\" and is as close to a tasting menu as you would expect to find in a new American restaurant. \\n\\nTonight I wanted everything that chef thought I should taste being a first timer here. The first was the jalapeno ahi. Not something you'd think would go together, but it's a beautiful unification of flavors that are not traditionally thought of as being in the same culture. That's what is cool about the modern omakase. I was then treated to a sashimi platter highlighting some of the incredible seafood that they bring in. The texture and taste all speak to the freshness of the ingredients and you sushi lovers... the true sushi lovers will be extremely pleased.\\n\\nDo you remember going on dates especially those that you are particularly excited about but haven't met in person yet? You have endorphins jumping around and then your date arrives and its going just as well as you thought if not better? That's how I felt about my omakase and then came the lobster tobanyaki. It was at that moment that the caramelized butter on top touched my tastebuds that I felt that warm fuzzy glow that you normally get with a nice glass of French champagne. Umami all over the place but yet from a dish that is superficially extremely simple. \\n\\nMy omakase then finished with a plate of extremely delicious fish nigiri and shellfish nigiri. This was then capped with \\"specialty nigiri\\" that included a lot of the fish I had previously had but dressed with caviar and other flavors to enhance the umami. I fell in love at that point. Of course, dinner is never complete without dessert and I got myself the green tea souffle. I suggest ordering it at the beginning of the night as it took about 25 min for it to be prepared. It was well worth the wait!\\n\\nIt's always entertaining to read the negative comments. There's no detail and just angry people. Remember that this is a nice restaurant... so dress accordingly. No shorts or opened toed shoes. Most people here are wearing jackets and collared shirts. People were extremely friendly and attentive as you would expect at a restaurant of this caliber. My green tea was constantly exchanged for hot green tea which I appreciated and even if I turned to appear like I wanted to ask a question, someone appeared out of thin air to address my ask. Chef Ito personally served the people at the bar and engaged us all in conversation. What a great experience. For those who enjoy truly incredibly sushi and sashimi, this is your place to be. I hear there are a total of 3 in Atlanta that are must tries for the advanced sushi lovers and I would definitely rank this in the top!"},{"name":"Deschutes Brewery Portland Public House","address":"210 NW 11th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Service and food were great especially at a brewery.

I probably won't be coming back. \\n\\nFood. We each ordered a ceasar salad. First of all, on the menu they just write \\"our take on a classic ceasar\\". And to be honest, I didnt even read the description until i came to write this review because who questions a Caesar salad?. Well their take includes raw red onion, olives, and sundried tomatoes? If anyone disliked or was allergic to those items then you would have to pick it all out or send it back for another. Also, the salad starts at $10. TEN DOLLARS. and what you get is a rectangular app plate with maybe two bunches of lettuce. ONce again, if you read my other reviews, I AM APPALLED at the prices of plates of lettuce in this city, especially under-portioned sizes that drastically. It's literally highway robbery. STAY AWAY (I only took a chance because I was expensing it haha)\\n\\nThen, I also ordered the sausage and peppers for $8. The portion was fine, but the dijon tasted more like nacho cheese and the sausage did not taste fresh. It was closer to a slim jim type sausage consistency and it was swimming in some sort of watery, greasy liquid. My coworker also got the mushroom mac and cheese, which looked good but it was nothing revolutionary and again, due to portion size, should have been $5 instead of $8. On top if it, we clearly ordered these small plates with a salad as our complete meal. Somehow our waitress managed to get the hot mac and cheese to come out 5 minutes before my hot sausage and peppers which was a solid TEN minutes before our COLD salads. \\n\\nWhich leads me to the next point: the service. There was one waitress working, with purple hair, and as an ex server I wanted to teach her so badly. She was awful. She talked flippantly about the menu, saying things like \\"oh yeah and we have, like, a beer menu and like, a full bar if you guys want to get frisky at lunch\\" (direct quote). I hope that paints the picture. No professionalism at all. She doesn't know how to time food entry and didn't even bother to ask us if we wanted it all to come out together. She kept us waiting to order and for the check, and never checked back on us after the food was dropped. I don't care if this is lunch, you need to look, act, and speak professionally, and use some common sense around meal delivery. \\n\\nOn top of it all, it wasn't until 5-8 minutes after we ordered that we were informed they couldn't do a caprese salad because they were \\"out of mozzarella\\".

I feel silly doing that somewhere fancy, so this is more my scene for this flavor of crustacean consumption.\\n\\nThe table next to us kept talking about UFOs and stargates and aliens was awesome for sneaky eavesdropping and amusement, our server rocked, the spicy crab was tasty, and it was just a fun evening.  My bucket had 3 different types of crab (snow, dungeness, and king), and it was nice to be able to compare them over the course of one meal.

Umi is the Nobu of Atlanta before Nobu opens in 2021! First of all, the ambience is vibrant in a way that that doesn't interfere with your meal but allows you to have a decent conversation. The vibe walking in is very posh but it's more like a social club than  a pretentious gathering. Another thing is Umi is fairly small and dark which creates a sense of intimacy in the restaurant. Also, celebrities (Jennifer Lawrence and the Avenger's crew) frequent Umi. \\n\\nFood wise, expect to splurge your self with the best of the best Otoro, A5 Wagyu, Truffle, Caviar, and Uni. This isn't your typical, casual sushi restaurant and may be best saved for special occasions. As a casual sushi eater who hasn't been to Nobu, Sushi Jiro, Masa, or other fine sushi establishments, I was intimidated at first. Needless to say, Umi has something for everyone (California Rolls to Kobe Beef Rolls, and Akami to Otoro). The New Page Roll should not be nosed, as well as the Salmon Nigiri with Truffle and Yuzu and the Otoro Caviar. \\nThere are a few non-sushi items which are exceptional- the Crispy Rice with Spicy Tuna, Spicy Shrimp Tempura, Lobster Tepanyaki, and the Matcha Souffl√©. Try to steer away from some of the cooked seafood items like the Miso Black Bass and Cod because they were a little too sweet and not large enough of a portion in my opinion.

You should just get out of the way.\\n\\nLamb's Table catered our perfect wedding last Sunday, and they were a huge part of the reason our day will live in our memory forever. Jamie cooked a meal for our guests that was so flat-out tasty as to boggle one's mind. The beef short-rib ragu and parmesan polenta was devastating - luscious, meaty, succulent umami overload. That dish alone is the single best dish I have ever had at a catered event, ever. It's the best thing I've eaten this year. We ate our leftovers in bed the next day and \\"holy ****\\" was said several times, let me tell you. Get it.\\n\\nOur guests came back for seconds and thirds and raved to us about the food. Hot smoke salmon was devoured, all the sides - gone. The word \\"triumph\\" was used by a close relative. Weddings are supposed to have BAD food, not food that makes you nudge your neighbor and say \\"Sweet loving god, have you tried this yet?\\" I think back to my wedding and start salivating! How may people can say that?\\n\\nJamie brings a lot of detail to her work you won't find with other vendors. Her serving dishes are timeless and classy. She has a fresh lemonade service that was really satisfying - a real alternative to alcohol for our guests. Several older and younger guests commented on how good it was. Her servers were very exacting with the presentation, folding our rented napkins just so at each and every place setting. The servers made sure our glasses were full, and were exceedingly positive and cheerful. Lamb's Table leaves their gratuity up to you, which is refreshing, but it's easy to see the plan in hindsight. Why require 18% when you could easily get 20% or more, since you deliver such quality work?\\n\\nAnd that's really my core review. There is only one word that really sums up how we feel about Lamb's Table after hiring them, and that is quality. Sometimes when you deal with items and services in that upper echelon of quality the experience can be jarring; what's expected of you, and where your input begins and ends become questions, whereas anyone can call up Elephant's Deli and get a van load of crap food real cheap and easy. Lamb's table was right in the middle price wise for us, and delivered such unbelievably good food . . . I know people out there think I'm exaggerating, or I'm friends with these people. But LISTEN: This is the truth. I eat a LOT of restaurant food, and I have for a long time. Sweet Mary Mother of God - the food at my wedding was beyond excellent. QUALITY.

The Truc has closed, and in its place is a passable Indian-ish restaurant.\\n\\nHere's the thing.  Or, things:\\n\\n1) We went to Pho Truc for the pho, banh mi, and Vietnamese coffee\\n2) We already have an Indian restaurant nearby AND THEY BRING FOOD TO MY HOUSE (Holla at me, Tava!)\\n\\nSo even though I like Indian-ish food, I am not that excited by Kathmandu's arrival. I say \\"Indian-ish\\" because on the Facebook, Kathmandu presents itself as a Nepali (ese?  I am dumb American) restaurant, but the food on the menu was familiar to me from Indian and Pakistani restaurants I've been to.  But I ain't no damn gourmand, so feel free to correct me.\\n\\nI was stoked to see lamb samosas on the menu, but my stokedness went away when we were told they were not available.  I'm sorry, but I SUPER can't stand when a brand new restaurant doesn't have everything on the menu. If you don't have it, give us some crappy laserjet menu listing only things I can actually buy.  Not having the samosas means I already know I can live without them, and will not be compelled to return for them.  \\n\\nI ordered some Chicken Tikka Masala for my entree, and Boyfriend got the Lamb Rogan Josh.  I like to think of Rogan Josh as Rogan, Joe's even less famous cousin.  Wait, is Joe Rogan already so lame that none of you even know who he is? Sorry.  We also got an order of Roti, kind of out of spite.  The server wasn't really sad about being out of samosas (and if they were good, he'd be pretty sad I bet) but he seemed like, compelled to make us order some garlic naan.  I like garlic naan.  I might even want to marry it, if I were in a good mood.  But I don't like up-sells and get kind of stubborn sometimes.  So Roti it was.  We both asked for our food to be spicy and bear with me while I have a bit of a fit here:\\n\\nJUST BECAUSE I AM A WHITE LADY DOESN'T MEAN I DON'T KNOW HOW TO EAT SPICY FOOD!\\n\\nI promise you, promise, promise, I do not order things that I don't like or won't eat.  It's this thing I have about wasting money, I guess?  Every freakin' time I go out for Indian food, seriously every time, I order spicy.  When they say \\"Spicy?\\" I say, \\"Yes please!  Spicy!\\".  Then they go \\"Mild, medium?  Hot?\\"  and I'm like, \\"Yep!  Hot!  Spicy!  Very hot!\\" and they go, \\"No no, spicy is very spicy, are you sure?\\"  And it makes me really mad.  Kathmandu was no exception.  And our server actually refused to make Boyfriend's food Hot, and told him he would only make it Medium, because hot is very very hot (you don't say?).\\n\\nWhen the food came, it smelled and looked delicious.  But (and yes, I am a fat lady so maybe it's just me), it didn't look like $13 worth of chicken and sauce.  I have made tikka masala at home, and including chicken breast and coconut milk and garam masala, the whole shebang for a family of 4 can probably be done for $13.  I get it, that's not why we go to restaurants, but damn.  There wasn't even an option for a lunch combo price, so if you go to Kathmandu on your lunch break, be prepared to shell out dinner money.  \\n\\nThe Josh Rogan was nice but way too mild and somewhat plain tasting.  My tikka masala was tasty, but not spicy enough.  I mean, it was spicy, and probably your grandma or your baby wouldn't like it, but I was expecting more.  All told, we got out of there for about $32 and did not have leftovers and were not particularly full.  \\n\\nIf Kathmandu actually sold everything it lists on its menu, and shaved about $5 off the entree prices (or gave you enough to take some home), it would be my new favorite Clarkston joint.

NXNW is located in the far northwest part of town.  I drove up there to check it out.\\n\\nThey were doing some new stone work on the front of the building...no bigs...nice of them to maintain it.  The hostesses were nice, sat me at the bar since I was solo.  The bar area is nice, plenty of tall tables where people can stand and hang out.  The bar space is nice too.  Just enough fancy-ness to where you still feel like you're at a brewery.  \\n\\nI ordered the sampler tray and a bbq chicken pizza.

It's probably because I'm a snob.  I live in Portland, OR; home of Deschutes, Widmer, Bridgeport, and 30 other brew pubs.  The beer at NXNW was just...well...weak.  And I mean weak in that the flavor didn't last long and it had the same punch as a Bud Light.  It seemed that way with each one.  The amber looked amber, it tasted alright, but it wasn't malty and the flavor didn't linger like it should.  The saison didn't have that fizzy/yeasty flavor of a saison.  The NW style IPA...well...did I mention I'm from the NW?  We pretty much put pine trees in our beer.  This place is right next to a few hotels, so I feel like they are appealing the masses that come from all over...and the masses generally prefer lighter beer...and I get that.

This was by far, my worst restaurant experience in Atlanta. First of all, it was Father's Day, so I was really hoping for a pleasant experience. Unfortunately, we got the exact opposite. To begin, the host was extremely condescending and rude and should be banned from working in the service industry. When 7 of us arrived on time for our reservation, he told me that we couldn't be seated until my whole party was there. Even though we were only missing 2 people and my Dad has bad knees, he still wouldn't seat us. Once my entire party had arrived only a few minutes later, the host told me he couldn't seat us because our table wasn't ready. I said, \\"So it had nothing to do with the fact that my entire party wasn't here?\\" He said, \\"If you'd like to see it that way.\\" Then when another woman inquired as to when her table would be ready, the host said, \\"the longer this conversation lasts, the longer it will take me to clean off your table to seat you.\\" Rude! We weren't seated until 1 hour after our reservation. And when I asked to speak with a manager, the host told me that they \\"self manage.\\" Which is obviously a lie. But then again, he lied to me about why he couldn't seat us too. Once seated, it took 30 minutes just to get our coffee, tea & juices. And then they were out of EVERYTHING. Out of beignets, out of chicken, out of ham, out of chorizo. So after finally ordering food that they actually had in stock, when it finally came to the table, it was all COLD. Not lukewarm, COLD. Which is a shame because the food was actually good and it's obvious that they use high quality products, and our meals would have been really good if served hot, the way that food is suppose to be served. Also, they put meat in the one vegetarians dish, even though he specifically asked multiple times for there not to be any meat on his plate. So that had to be sent back too. So we didn't wind up actually eating until more than 2 hours after our reservation time. I will also add, that we had to ask for everything: ask for silverware, napkins, etc - the basics that should all just be brought out to you without having to ask because this is a restaurant. By the end, we just wanted to get as far away from this dreadful place as possible. Our server was very nice but he was only able to give us a 10% discount which was horribly insufficient considering the amount of incompetence, rudeness and inconveniences that we had to deal with.

After reading and hearing so much about it, I had very high expectations, but it met and exceeded them. It's worth fighting for that reservation. I had a party of four, and our table was ready for us as soon as we walked in.\\n\\nWe started off with the cocktails, which were also fantastic. I had the autumn daiquiri, which the name of the drink says it all. It was a great drink with warm notes of spice without being too overpowering.\\n\\nNow onto the good stuff. Since the plates are smaller, we ended up ordering one of everything on the menu. This is definitely the move if you have at least 3-4 people. We were pretty full even though we only got a couple bites of each plate. Each plate they bring out to us is an art of its own. They explain the details of each dish and the local ingredients they use as they bring the food out to you. There are small gaps between each plate, but it's not an awkwardly long pause. You end up really looking forward to the next plate since you get to savor the flavors of each plate. You definitely shouldn't expect to be in and out very quickly here.\\n\\nNow the menu changes every couple weeks or so, depending on what's in season. My favorite dishes were the snapper and the carrots. The snapper is a very fresh sashimi, but the other components of the dish add such great flavor and texture. The carrot dish is incredible, which sounds funny to say about a simple vegetable. It's cooked in this delicious creamy sauce, which the table could not get enough of. The persimmon dessert was the end of our meal, and we left very happy and full. \\n\\nThe story behind the restaurant is touching, and the food is incredible. The service is also an A+.

We kept putting off going because we're not really fancy people, but with Boyfriend turning 30 this year (and reading all the excellent ratings on Yelp), I finally made our reservations on Open Table.\\n\\nAs always, I made sure to compliment the restaurant in the Open Table \\"special request\\" section (\\"I have heard nothing but wonderful things about Canoe and am so looking forward to coming!\\"), and I mentioned it was Boyfriend's 30th birthday.  When we arrived, the hostess wished him a happy birthday, and so did everyone else for the entire evening.  It definitely made him feel special, and I was glad that they cared (especially since Open Table sent me an email saying no special requests could be honored).\\n\\nOur waiter was friendly, fun, and knowledgeable though I'm pretty sure he had the A Perfect Circle logo tattooed on his arm, which seemed weird for such a pricey place.  I don't really care, I just thought it seemed worth mentioning. The thing about Canoe is, it can't seem to make up its mind about what kind of place it is.  Cloth napkins and $30 entrees, but no one pushes in your chair or wipes away your crumbs.  I can't decide how I feel about that, because on the one hand I hate when people are all up on my nuts, but at the price point I was kind of expecting it.  We sat outside, which was gorgeous, but the interior could have been Houston's or something--nothing was really unique about it.\\n\\nI ordered a raspberry soda, which was strong and delicious.  The bread guy came around and I grabbed some sourdough and flatbread.  The flatbread was wicked freakin' good and I was so tempted to ask if I could just buy some to take home.  I would have liked to have a personal basket of bread on the table, because no one wants to be like, \\"Hey bread guy, more free food over here please!\\"\\n\\nWe ordered the smoked salmon and the crab cake for our apps.  Both were INSANE.  Best versions of both of those dishes I've ever had, hands down.  After those, I couldn't wait to get my hands on the panko-crusted cod.  Well, I kinda could.  In all honesty there was nothing on the entree menu that screamed, \\"ORDER ME,\\" but the server really sang the praises of the cod so I went with it.\\n\\nWhen it arrived I was struck by two things; 1) the portion size was pretty measly and 2) It didn't really taste like anything.  Boyfriend was smitten with his rabbit, which came with bacon ravioli.  For someone like me, who loves plain ol' American fare, I kept thinking if I could just mix and match some of the dishes on the menu, I'd be happy.  Bacon ravioli is up my alley, but rabbit isn't. Cod is delicious, but I'm not a fan of beans, which is what the cod was resting on.  Scallops sounded delicious, but sweet potato puree really doesn't do it for me.  I guess despite my efforts to be classy, I'm really more of an Outback kinda gal than a Canoe one.  Sad trombone.\\n\\nFor dessert we split the creme brulee, and it was ZOMG so good.  I can't even.  I don't.  No words.  Best.  Mmmm.\\n\\nI really hate to say it because I know everyone else loves this place, and the service was awesome (well it started out awesome at 7, but as the night wore on we became less of a priority), and I had been looking forward to the meal for so long, but the main course at Canoe was the downfall of the meal.  And I think for a $30 piece of fish, it should be pretty damn good.  I'd say stick to apps and desserts, or maybe come for brunch or lunch.  And bring a couple bucks for the valet, because we hadn't really planned ahead for that.\\n\\nI guess we are not really Canoe-level clientele and that's fine since I'll never be able to afford going there again.

But whatever, I had a good lunch there that one day in November when I started writing this review.  Oh, and I've been back and had good food and service there several times before and since, including recently.\\n\\nThe roasted garlic bulbs are the only thing I had a problem with.  I don't know how they got that garlic so brown, but I have to congratulate them on that.  Once I tasted the garlic and found it so earthy tasting, rather than garlic-flavored, I actually wondered aloud if they accidentally gave me mushrooms instead.  And the swimming pool's worth of olive oil was really unnecessary.\\n\\nOkay, let's move on to the good stuff:  the angus burger.  I've had burgers here before, and they've always been really tasty.  I got cheddar on mine, and it made my mouth happy.  They also cooked my burger medium rare like I wanted it.  I can't tell you how many places I've been where they've failed in this endeavor.  Other places giving me a well-done burger or steak makes me wonder why they bothered asking me in the first place how I wanted it cooked.  Never a problem at NXNW.  The blood was dripping onto my plate and cascading down my wrists, just the way I wanted it.  And don't pay attention to anyone who says the buns here are terrible; the bun is perfect here and doesn't need to be toasted.  I had a burger at Hideout Pub November 7th during the Cowboys game, and I started wishing for a NXNW bun.  It is simply that good.\\n\\nI can also recommend the salmon pizza.  It's good, despite having goat cheese on it.  Why do classy restaurants think goat cheese is a good thing?  It's not.  It's... goat-y.  I spent three years working at a goat farm in East Austin, and THEN I tried goat cheese for the first time.  Bad idea.  It tasted like the smell of the goats.  And then I tried goat bbq.  Same awful goat-y taste as the cheese.\\n\\nWhat was I originally talking about?  Oh yeah, the burger.  Pardon my tangent.\\n\\nThere was one problem with my burger last November.  Two, actually.  I'd told my waiter I only wanted cheddar, mayo, and lettuce on my burger, but it arrived sans lettuce and mayo.  Hey, I asked for it the same way at Hideout a couple of nights later, and they got it right.  Why couldn't you, NXNW?  Getting lettuce and mayo later wasn't a problem, but it annoyed me that I had to ask a second time.  But hey, everybody makes mistakes.  Service was great, otherwise, so they get to keep that fourth star.  \\n\\nSince then, I tried something other than the burger at NXNW.  Got the herb-roasted rotisserie chicken with onion mashed potatoes and green beans just before Xmas.  The food was excellent, and I got a LOT for my money, but I felt like the green beans were either overcooked or undercooked, as they weren't very tender.  Nonetheless, I enjoyed my meal that day, and I even got a free beer by saying whatever NXNW said to say on their Twitter page.\\n\\nTo dole out stars this way makes me feel like a god.  Hear that, other restaurants?  Treat me well, or I'll rain fire and brimstone on your doorstep.  And then I'll rob you of Yelp stars.  'Cause that's how I roll.  Take a note from NXNW; they know how to treat a girl.  They know how to serve up flame-broiled goodness on a spectacular bun.  And the fries?  Fabulous.

I did not like how all of the toppings are already mixed into the avocado.

The rice base is automatically brown rice at no additional cost, and the overall bowl is still a low price.

It's not been busy the couple of times I have visited.  Staff are quite friendly, take pride in their work and eager to assist.  It shares a business model to other assembly line like fast food restaurants; (think Chipotle, Piada, Bibibop).  My hope is the staff can maintain their strong customer focus as the demand grows, unlike other assembly line fast foods.   Their menu is Italian.   Both times I visited, I ordered their personal size, 10\\" pizza.  The pizza's come in one size.  \\n\\nStep up to the first station and decide type of meal.  Will it be pizza, salad or pasta?  They do offer a few chef creations, if you have a hard time deciding.  Otherwise, its fun to be creative and design your own.   Base meals price start at $7.99.   5 or more toppings will be $1 more.   Double the protein on the pasta or salad will be another $2.\\n\\nNext, choose from available sauces or dressing.   (What Cucinova's web site shows may not be available in all locations.)    Then, select your cheese.   Choose from your protein or salad greens.   Finally, add toppings from available selection.   Pizza's are slid into a very hot tiled, oven and bake pretty quickly!  Some of the crust may be well-done, but they truly come out with a great flavor.  For beverages, the have soda products, a variety of teas, lemonades, craft beer on tap and wine.    \\n\\nThis location has several tables, booths and benches for dining in.   It also has an outdoor patio on the side for when the weather is nice.   The place looked pretty clean.   They also support carry-out as well as ordering online through the Cucinova web site.  They offer an eclub if you become a frequent customer, including a free pizza when you enroll.  \\n\\nThere is plenty of parking around the perimeter.   However, access to the building can be a little awkward, depending on which way you are driving.   Access from Emerald Parkway is tricky because of the middle island throughout the parkway.   I would suggest using the access from the service road running alongside of Kroger's and Chase Bank.  There is no direct access to the area from Sawmill itself.  \\n\\nOverall, my experiences have been fun.  Pizza's have been tasty.  And yes, I found the 10\\" size plenty for one person.  Others will likely want their own, but depends on appetite.

You've missed everything Austin. Where to begin ...\\n\\nLike everything on Rainey Street it's in what was once a tiny home that has been converted into an incredible commercial venue. There is seating inside with a beautiful bar featuring over 100 beers on tap. But the real attraction is the yard. Belly up to the communal picnic tables in the dirt and watch them smoke the amazing house made meats while people play cornhole and kids run around and dogs wander and you're in Austin. \\nWe started off with two seasonal beers, both fantastic. Served at the right temperature in the right glassware. My IPA left beautiful lace on the glass. We ordered the jar of pickles and poutine. Both outstanding. The picked were bright and crisp, unusually citrus in a good way; sour and garlic but the garlic took a back seat which was such a welcome surprise as so many house made pickles are just screaming garlic. The poutine was quintessential drunk food. Beautiful, chewy, cheese curds and tasty brown gravy. My husband had traditional bangers and mash. It was heavenly. The banger was crumbly and dry in the best way. It was not fatty. It was not springy. It had perfect snap. The mash was hearty and simple and exactly as it should be. He also ordered a side of jalepeno creamed corn which is a must try. It was absolutely beautiful. \\nBut let me tell you about my dinner. I had the duck, bacon and fig sausage. It was served on a kolache roll with fig jam and caramelized onions. I am a meat lover. But I am a picky meat lover. And sausages can go very wrong. This? This was bliss. It burst with flavor. The duck was the star. So many times when people incorporate bacon into a dish it's nothing but bacon. I just basked in the incredible balance of this beautiful sausage. I tasted the bacon but it wasn't all about bacon. I tasted the earthiness of the fig. It all came together and was just delicious beyond words. It had a very potent and tart fig jam that played off the rich meat to perfection. The caramelized onions were also delicious - perhaps a bit over cooked for me (I like a bit more texture) but the flavor was fantastic. \\nWe were about to leave when we saw boiled peanuts come out to another table. We of course had to have them. We were stuffed but couldn't pass them up. So glad we didn't. They were some of the best I've ever had. \\nWhatever you do - don't miss Bangers.

We're in!\\" Bad feeling in the pit of my gut, as we immediately felt unwelcome, then waited forever for someone to notice us after being seated. Luckily, our server was friendly, and apologetic of the 10+ minute wait for recognition. \\n\\nSashimi appetizer was spot-on. Gorgeous as the glossy menu photos indicated, delicious as anticipated.  Crab siu-mai appetizer wasn't my thing, and I wondered if the wrappers had been previously frozen - but, Sabine was happy with them, so I was content to watch her eat. \\n\\nFor the main course, Sabine & I split the filet mignon. The accompanying house salad consisted of lettuce + tiny shreds of carrot in a lackluster dressing. Currently, I'm working garde manger at a farm-to-table restaurant, so I know my greens + dressings.

The steak itself was a bit under-seasoned (Disclaimer: my taste buds may possibly be blown from the \\"raining salt\\" approach taught in culinary school), though otherwise perfectly cool-in-the-center medium rare. Sabine said the steak was perfection. My major beef with the steak entree was the vegetable side - steamed broccoli and \\"baby\\" (chlorine-soaked, straight out of the bag) carrots with no detectable seasoning. For a $25 entree, I want to know someone is risking their fingers to mandolin & julienne my carrots. And, I want butter & garlic & salt.

The last time we came to a show, we ordered food  before the show started (2 impossible burgers with fries and the farro entree), and it took an hour and a half to get our food (and our server forgot to put in the farro entree so we never got that).

Then, while we are nearing the end of our quickly consumed meal, the security guard comes over and tells us we need to leave (this is no more than 10-15 minutes after the show has ended and the room had pretty much cleared out). I tell him, \\"Listen, we didn't get our food until the last song. We're almost done. Give us a minute.\\" He kind of grumbles but backs off.

Du Kuh Bee is my favorite because they do their signature dish right. I highly recommend the Du Kuh Bee noodles with Chicken (there are squid, shrimp, and pork options too). I order extra spicy and have always been happy that they can get the spice right without blanding the dish.\\n\\nAnother must have is also their Pork Mandu (dumplings).

It was a thicker broth made with coconut milk and very flavorful. We shared tuna sashimi, salmon sashimi, and four rolls.

This place is pretty amazing. It's located near the corner of N. Highland Ave and Ponce de Leon. There's no private parking so street parking is the only option although we've never had a problem finding a spot close by. Usually, coming to a soul food restaurant on a Sunday anywhere in Atlanta would be a huge mistake but luckily Soul Vegetarian is never over crowded. We came in on a Sunday around 6pm, walked right in, and picked a table. The menu is easy to follow consisting of only 2 and 1/2 pages of a few appetizers, salads, entrees, sides, and desserts. I've been to this location a few times and always get the kalebone with rice and gravy and a side of broccoli. I had my mouth set just for that however this time they were out of gravy so this was the perfect opportunity to try something new. I ordered the Garvey burger, made from wheat gluten, and a side of collards and herb potatoes. Every meal comes with a small garden salad with house made dressing. My only complaint is that the salad dressing could be a little thicker. Once you pour it on it sinks straight to the bottom of the plate which is a shame since it's pretty tasty. Our entrees came out about 15-20mins later. The Garvey burger was a nice thick patty topped with pickles, ketchup, and a mushroom onion sauce. The herb potatoes are the perfect addition being well seasoned with plenty of herbs and spices. The meal didn't come out as hot as I would've liked but I was too hungry to send it back. I got full about halfway through the meal but knew I had to order a slice of vegan sweet potato pie from the dessert menu. I'm a sweet potato pie connoisseur so my expectations weren't high for a vegan version. Even though I was stuffed, I took one bite and one bite somehow turned into 10! That pie took me back to my childhood and tasted just like the regular homemade sweet potato pies that my aunt used to make every time I came for a visit! Honestly I'd come back just for the pie, it was that good. The soul food cooking paired with the old school, Saturday morning \\"clean up music\\" playing in the background, gives soul vegetarian it's down home feel that keeps you coming back for more."},{"name":"Donut Villa Diner","address":"1 Highland Ave","city":"Malden","stars":"4.5","text":"This place is a true gem!

Me and my friend dine out regularly and have a great love for it. We meet each other in different cities and enjoy checking out the best or \\"hottest\\" places, tasting menus, and michelin star restaurants. We both genuinely have a great  appreciation for dining and the restaurant business. \\n\\nOn this occasion I met her in her home town Atlanta. We went on Eater to see what restaurants sparked out interest. She wanted Japanese, and we were torn between Umi, Tomo, and O Ku. We decided to go with Umi. We decided to go on Mon, and there was only a 9pm reservation available. Both of us would have preferred an earlier time but there wasn't anything available. We arrived approx 5-10 min before our reservation, and were directed to the bar to have a drink because the restaurant was completely full. We told the hostess that we were open to eating at the sushi bar if that was the first table available, and we were sat approx 35-40 min after our reservation time. We both love the interactive experience you get at the sushi bar, so we didn't have a problem when we were sat there. \\n\\nOnce we sat we already had a sense that we wanted the omikase. They offer three different omikase options. We chose the Ito-kase which was the premium choice (and the most expensive), and which was highly recommended by our server. We were both very excited because of all the great reviews, and looked forward to a great experience. The first dish we received was a hamachi guacamole with sweet potato chips. It was quite delicious and me and my friend were taking our time and enjoying it immensely, when 5 min later we are given a second dish. This was a tuna carrpacio. At this point we didn't think anything of it and allowed ourselves to enjoy both dishes at the same time. However another 5 min later we are given the sashimi course. This dish had about 10 pieces of sashimi on it. At this point we were still finishing the first course, we hadn't really started the second ,and already had the third. We mentioned to the chef, who had made the sashimi for us, that it all looked amazing but it was a lot. He said he would be patient. If we had received another dish there would've been nowhere to put it because the bar was full. At this point things slowed down a bit. \\n\\nWe were starting to make it through the sashimi, enjoying each piece, when we were brought lobster on a hotplate with soy butter. At this point I began to think that the server wasn't paying attention because we were clearly still working on our sashimi, hadn't finished it, and had just had our plates taken away from the first two courses. We began to dig into the lobster, and had just put it on our plates to begin eating it when a chilean sea bass came out! I told the runner to tell the server if we could please slow down. When the server came back over we asked her the same thing. It was overwhelming to constantly have food put down in front of you, and not be able to fully enjoy it before another plate was put down. It's also not the kind of service and environment Umi is claiming to deliver. This kind of service is more expected in a diner, pub, or fast food establishment.\\n\\nSadly this is not where the bad service stopped. We received the sea bass (and at this point was getting full quickly because we were having to eat so fast) and were about halfway through when we received the nigiri. At this point my friend had to stop eating because she was overwhelmed. Earlier in the night our server had told us that once we received the nigiri course that we could then request more nigiri as we wanted it. Normally I'm a bottomless pit, but for the same reasons as my friend I was getting full. However I wanted some uni. I asked for three pieces of uni. The chef only had one, which was disappointing, but I figured I could ask for something else. I asked for a piece of the special toro nigiri, but at this point felt rushed by the server to see if I wanted anything else from the sushi bar. I left it at that feeling a bit annoyed. \\n\\nWe were still trying to make the most of the night at this point. We began talking to a pair next to us, who seemed like regulars, and were enjoying the conversation when Iris came over and asked us if we could order dessert because the kitchen was closing. They were out of one of the desserts, so I reluctantly ordered a chocolate cake. We still had nigiri on the bar when she asked us this. And I was finishing off my friends nigiri because she was annoyed and full. This is when everything really turned south for me. Iris brought out dessert plates and put them down while we still had sushi plates, soy sauce, AND nigiri on the table. I didn't think she would be audacious enough to bring out the dessert, but she DID! What's worse is that she lied to us because the couple got the same cake, and about 10 min later. The bill was almost $400 and not worth it at all! I don't recommend Umi."},{"name":"Domino's Pizza","address":"1195 Fairburn Rd SW, Ste 110","city":"Atlanta","stars":"1.5","text":"This place is a waste of time PLEASE DO NOT ORDER HERE!\\nAfter waiting more than 2 hours I call them and they told me that they where at my address call me and I didnt pick up the phone I was staying at a hotel so they only have to go straight to the room or call the lobby,just making  excuses!"},{"name":"Buckeye Chili & Smokehouse","address":"30 S Young St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"Decided to give it a second chance, and other than marrying my wife, it was the best decision I have ever made.

I liked how these were \\"deconstructed\\", arriving as slices of parmesan dusted toastettes that you piled the yumminess on.  And the cheese plate ($10 HH) was also good with a brie, a manchego, and a mild gorgonzola and had strawberries, olives and honey on the side.  It's always fun for us to mix and match cheeses with honey with a wine chaser and have little mini, multiple O's.\\n\\nMaggie never flagged in her energy and promptness, even as the place filled up and she could be spotted darting here and there like Ricochet Rabbit.

Never stock what I want. I gave up looking there. Forget The Hills as a State Store.\\n\\nGROCERIES - 1 of 5. Packaged grocery products are 2 to 3 times their price in other grocery stores. That's 200-300% EXTRA markup over the standard grocery margin. Old-fashioned service justifies some extra pricing, but it is not worth paying $2.50 or more for $1.00 products. The Hills makes Whole Paycheck into an extreme bargain basement.\\nEx: $3.50 for Progresso soup that is regularly $1.69, but I stock up on it for $1.00 during Meijer sales. \\n\\nSERVICE - 5 of 5. Makes me think it is 1950 when service was truly helpful. They will order and stock whatever specialty items that you request.\\n\\nACCESSIBILITY - 3 of 5.  They have a riding cart that they hide in the back someplace. If you are unable to stand while waiting for someone to get it, you have to sit on their patio for a while - even in freezing cold.

Since the server had already thrown it away, the supervisor insisted that because she had already ate half of the burger that he couldn't give her money back.

I am Syrian on my father's side and grew up eating quality Arabic food.  I found a local 4 star rated restaurant and headed out to it.  As I Opened the door I was almost blown back by the cacophony of sound emanating from the speakers.  I felt like I had just stepped into a rock concert and was standing in front of a stack of Marshall amps.  I screamed over the music to ask the owner if he could turn it down, he replied with a. \\"No.  Homeland Security has the place wired.\\"  My first thought was, \\"Yikes.\\"  My second thought was, \\"How much do I really want Arabic food today?\\"  What does this have to do with Merguez in Orlando, you ask?  Great question!  Sans the blaring music, the place was packed to the hilt with yelling, screaming, demonstrative gesturing Arabs (it's what my people do).  My mind wandered and I imagined I was at a meeting of Islamic extremists and wondered if this restaurant was also bugged.  I am not certain what the hoopla was about, but I can assure you, they were not factoring polynomials!  Now, onto the food.  I ordered the mixed grill with chicken, lamb and kefta along with a Greek salad and steamed rice.  The chicken had to have been under a heat lamp for at least a few hours based on the rubbery consistency it presented to my palate, the lamb was dry and tasteless (served with a side of ketchup no less!), and the kefta was not unlike trying to eat a sponge ball.  The only reason this salad could be called Greek was because it had a few crumbles of Feta Cheese thrown on top, otherwise it was pedestrian and nothing to write home about.  The steamed rice was fine, I mean, how hard is it to screw up steamed rice?

It was my favorite item of the night! When fresh, the roti is piping hot with a nice crust and the inside is a thin layer of slightly chewiness. And when it was dipped into the curry it was heavenly! Definitely recommend to get it! I ordered another roti afterwords, for $1.50 more? Sounds good to me!\\n\\nOur entrees beef haw fun and the prawn mee came next. The beef haw fun was stirfried noodles in a soy sauce with beef and veggies. It was very stardard Asian dish, with nothing amazing to get again unfortunately. The prawn mee noodle soup was a bit more complex so I did enjoy that. It was slightly spicy and had lots of toppings to it. The noodles were cooked perfectly as well. I would order again if I'm not adventurous at my next visit. The five spice green beans came in the middle of eating the entrees so that was weird. It was nice and crunchy and it was great but I was getting full from my entrees so it would have been nice to get it earlier in the meal. \\n\\nThe additional roti had not yet came out after we finished our meal, but we were okay without it because we became full.

I can easily say that this is one of Atlanta's best brunch spots - HANDS DOWN. My husband brought me here for our 1st brunch date (which is probably why we're married now...lol) and I've been hooked ever since!  I've tried so many things on the menu but I can't believe that yesterday was the FIRST time I ever had the strawberry pancakes.  I'm usually an omelette or benedict kind of girl.  OMG! THEY ARE SO DAMN GOOD!  Their recipe seems to be as simple and basic as you can get but that's what makes them so good.  An order comes with 3 fluffy, nicely sized pancakes, topped with strawberries (these also come in chocolate chip and blueberry), a side of whipped cream and a side of maple syrup (totally unnecessary).  I took my sweet time eating them so I could savor every bite.  This has become my new favorite dish here.  For the sake of this post, I will highlight my other favorite items off the menu:\\n\\nShrimp & Grits- These were featured on DDD and with good reason! Best shrimp and grits - EVER! The shrimp are huge and the grits and so rich, creamy and full of flavor! Must try!!! \\n\\nTruffled Eggs & Wild Mushroom Ragout - If you're a truffle lover, like myself, you will truly enjoy this dish.  It's not a huge serving but enough to fill you up.\\n\\nCookies & Milk pie- THIS PIE IS ADDICTIVE!!  It has a graham cracker crust and has layers of chocolate chip cookies and whipped cream! So decadent and delicious!! \\n\\nCoffee - The coffee here is excellent.  I judge most breakfast/brunch spots on their coffee and Joy gets an A+.\\n\\nThe biscuits - Most of the dishes offered come with a biscuit.  Please be sure to partake!! These biscuits are huge, flaky, fluffy and delicious!!! You honestly don't need anything on them - that's how good they are!\\n\\nAnother thing to mention is that Joy Cafe recently moved to this location. The good thing is that there's more room and you can get seated quickly versus the \\"old days\\" when it took almost an hour to get a seat.  However, I noticed that the food takes a lot longer to come out than before.  I'm assuming it's growing pains but the food is so good that waiting a little longer is easy to overlook.  Also, the only other disadvantage is that since Joy is in Midtown, you have to pay for either street parking or a paid lot. To save money, my husband and I took MARTA to get here yesterday.

At this location, most meals can be had for under $8 each.\\n\\nI went with their most expensive item, the $10.90 T-bone steak dinner. The menu states the dinner comes with a T-bone steak, garden salad, hash browns, and Texas toast. However, our server said I could sub out the salad for eggs (steak and eggs, a popular option) and I could choose what kind of bread I wanted. IIRC, the choices were Texas toast, raisin bread, and wheat. There might've been one more bread choice.\\n\\nI went with the steak and eggs and had the eggs prepared over easy. The steak and eggs were served on separate plates. Lots of people like to put their eggs on top of their steak and let the yolks drizzle out, but instead I cut off pieces of steak and dipped it into my eggs (there were 2 eggs). I had the steak cooked medium rare and it was actually pretty good, especially for the price.\\n\\nThe outer edges of the steak were cooked more to a well done while the inside portions of the steak, particularly towards the bone, were closer to a medium rare to rare. So yeah, the steak wasn't grilled to the same temperature consistently, but it was also a pretty thin, cheap cut. Surprisingly, it was tender, juicy, and flavorful. No sauce required, which is always a good sign. However, it also also chewy and tendony.\\n\\nThe hash browns and Texas toast were OK. I had the hash browns plain. Two slices of Texas toast were served, halved into triangles, with small dollops of butter (or a buttery spread) in between with a side of grape jelly.\\n\\nI also had a plain waffle ($3.05, 410 calories) with syrup and spread, and tried my friend's customized hash browns which were double covered and double smothered. Covered means they come with melted cheese and smothered means they come with sauteed onions. They fresh-cut their onions here. Check out this video I recorded: https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/waffle-house-1508-atlanta-3?select_video=x3jSsDMl7b6KHm3ym72uKQ\\n\\nThe waffle was yummy. The double covered and double smothered hash browns were tasty too. You can also get the hash browns chunked (ham), diced (tomatoes), peppered (jalapenos), capped (mushrooms), topped (chili), country (gravy), and all the way (all toppings for $5).\\n\\nThe food and service at this Waffle House outshine other Waffle Houses I've been to. The parking lot is nice and spacious too."},{"name":"Deschutes Brewery Portland Public House","address":"210 NW 11th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Hmmmmm I've been here a while back in 2013 and I'm not sure why I didn't write a review for it back then.\\n\\nIt seems the menu has changed since I came back and gotten a bit smaller, but the venue itself and the service has not.

The sushi selection is very large and is not just a bunch of cooked fish sushi which you find at many places. A couple of people in our party didn't eat sushi so they ordered cooked beef and fish dishes. It took about 30 min for them to receive their meals after they served our sushi.

Space may be tight, but you are right up to the stage.  The sound system quality and lighting are perfect for this concert hall. And the interior featuring wood floors is beautiful. Lighting, however, is toned down. Which can make it difficult for some audience members to read a menu.\\nNils Lofgren put on a great show.  A career starting from the 1960s' with his band, Grin, a member of Neil Young's Crazy Horse, and currently with Bruce Springsteen and the E Street band, Lofgren is on tour performing songs from his new album and long career.

We were sat outside which was nice and there were wood bench tables. When I looked at the menu for their sausages I was impressed by the selection and same with the beer, they had like 150 beers on tap! There were 3 saudades that caught my attention *description in parenthesis according to menu*: The Turducken (If you ever wondered what would happen if a turkey, duck & chicken had a baby, now's your chance to find out!); Duck, Bacon & Fig (Dried figs plumped in port wine & honey w/ a l'il bacon); and the Fried Chicken (Served w/ skin-on mash potatoes and house-made milk gravy, horseradish mustard, & a honey buttered drop biscuit). After much deliberating, I decided on the Fried Chicken. The waiter, told me that if was seasoned chicken meat made into a sausage, wrapped with chicken skin, breaded and fried. HOLY CRAP THAT CAUGHT MY ATTENTION! My friend ordered the South Texas Antelope & Venison Merguez (A North African specialty w/ red wine, red pepper, cinnamon & cloves). \\nWe first started off with some Boiled Peanuts and 2 Austin Beerworks Fire Eagle. I've never had southern boiled peanuts before but the peanuts are boiled on seasoned water and it was salty and had some spices in it, pretty unique and I was informed that this was huge in the south and you can just get boiled peanuts at gas stations. The Fire Eagle was a nice IPA to drink. \\nOur sausages came with a small order of fries. We both decided to share, split half the sausages. For the Fried Chicken it was nice and crispy on the outside and the inside was nice and juicy and you can tell it's been seasoned with spices because it looked a little orange. The texture from the crunch of the outside was reminiscent of crispy fried chicken skin, the seasoning reminded me of some southern fried chicken line Colonel Sanders secret spices. My friend's Merguez was nice, you can taste the red wine and spices, and a little bit of gaminess from the venison and antelope. \\nSo being in Austin, I tried to stick with Austin beers For my 2nd round of beer, I had a Pecan Porter from (512) Brewing Company, really nice pecan flavor, dark but light and very refreshing and easy to drink. My last beer I had was not from Austin but still from Texas, I had a Texas Honey Ale, from Guadalupe Brewing Company, it has a nice, subtle distinct sweetness from the Texas honey and also nice to drink. \\nParking here seems tough, especially on a Friday night because it's on Rainey Street, a hip areas, lots of restaurant, bars, and food trucks/trailers, so good thing we took Uber here and back. it's fun and a very social atmosphere, enjoying good food, drinking good craft beer and being with good friends.

I got the Masala tea which was delicious and for someone who doesn't like chai tea it was awesome. He got the the saffron lassi (a thick yogurt drink) which we have had before at other places and was really good and filling. Decided on trying something new for us, I ordered us the spiced lentil donuts in a very spicy soup and it was very satisfying and almost too spicy for me. \\n\\nHe got the sag paneer and I got the malai kofta. We didn't stray too far from the norm for us as these dishes are particularly our favorites anywhere we go and they did not disappoint. The meal itself is large and enough to take home leftovers. \\n\\nThey serve a variety of dishes such as soups, tandoori platters, North Indian, South Indian, curries, rice dishes, Indo-Chinese specialties, dosai (crepes), uthappam (Indian pizzas), and desserts. My favorite dessert is kulfi! (homemade Indian mango ice cream). \\n\\n*As I said in my first review of this place, this is an all vegetarian establishment.

Pro-tip, if you order the build your own salad, one of the base options is rice, so you can basically still get a build your own bowl for about $2 cheaper (before add-ons like protein or guac).\\n\\nThe Good: Lots of options! Vegan and Vegetarian friendly, with meat options for those who want that instead. Lots of topping choices and dressings (all but 2 are vegan, so rest assured, we plant-based foodies will have a dressed salad!).\\n\\nPortions were pretty good. Got a lot of bang for my buck! Me and my friend went around 7:30 and there was no line, so we got our food quickly, though I can't imagine this place gets as busy as chipotle or anything. I can't see people waiting too long regardless of time, but I can't say for sure, as I have only been here once.\\n\\nThe staff was friendly, and had no problem with me bringing in my own large bowl to use instead of their disposable ones. \\n\\nThe Bad:\\n\\nFor a company that explicitly says on its website (pictured) that sustainability is important to them, I was disappointed that there weren't reusable bowl / cutlery options for people who chose to eat in store, especially since they ENCOURAGE people to stick around on their site.\\n\\nThe salad my friend got came in a plastic bowl. Supposedly it can be recycled. Did you know containers need to be rinsed / washed before they can be reycled? Hopefully everyone does this at home already, but it's near impossible when eating out. No-one is washing these containers before they're tossed away, and no-one at the recycling plant is going to take the time to clean them, so they will probably be thrown out.\\n\\nThe cutlery is also supposedly biodegradable. Fun fact about bio-plastics; they need to be heated to temperatures of 140 degrees f to break down, and Vancouver doesn't currently have a system in place reserved for bio-plastics. They can't be recycled, because they would ruin the quality of the other recycled materials, so they must go in the trash.\\n\\nI would love to see Hungry Guys Kitchen bring some eco-friendly, washable plates/bowls/cutlery to their store, so people eating in can enjoy a waste-free meal. At the very least, maybe they could eliminate the plastic bowls and switch to the same type of compostable dish as the burrito bowl comes in, the kind of larger bowls Freshii has. Would also love to see them switch to bamboo cutlery as well, a truly biodegradable option.\\n\\nHere is my issue with Hungry Guys: they talk the talk but don't walk the walk. While their materials are currently \\"recyclable\\" and compostable (note: their website even uses the word reusable, so I would like to ask, where???), and people have fooled themselves into believing this is a viable option when trying to be eco-friendly, the truth is, there is still a ton of energy that goes into actually making and breaking down these items. They don't materialize out of thin air. Even these biodegradable bowls, which go back to the earth use energy to make. The best option for sustainability will ALWAYS be to have reusable dishes and utensils available."},{"name":"Don Pedro","address":"5900 NE 4th Plain Blvd","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Love this place.

I'm not sure if I'm a fan of those chips. I'm on the fence because I love sweet potato anything pretty much.

We ended up going the next night, but it was SO worth it. \\n\\nAs soon as you walk in there is a welcoming coziness that wraps itself around you. It was a Saturday night around 9:30 PM, so it was quite crowded, but we were able to immediately get a great spot at the end of the bar. \\n\\nThese bartenders are no joke! Just like with baristas, I wish people who don't understand the art and craft of mixing drink would stop calling themselves \\"bartenders\\". Because truth is, there are more of y'all out there who are quick to call yourselves bartenders but you haven't put the time, knowledge, and skill into it! \\n\\nThe main bartender who served us was a brunette woman with (what sounded like?) a Russian accent. I believe her name was \\"Marina\\" or something similar to that. Seriously, she is the Lebron of mixing drinks. The menu had so many good options, so I started off by asking what she recommended. She asked what drinks I normally like so I told her I love Moscow mules and she whipped up something that was right on track with that. \\n\\nMy fianc√© and I ended up ordering several drinks, but what really impressed me was that she made a Ramos Gin Fizz. The first time I had one was almost 20 years ago in New Orleans (where the drink originates from). Since then I've been in search of it, but very few bartenders even know what it is. Let alone, can make an outstanding one! \\n\\nHer customer service was superior, as were the other bartenders and servers; she even threw in a bonus Caipirinha (Brazilian cocktail) for us at the end. Again, another drink that many bartenders don't know how to make properly. \\n\\nI've never had such a pleasant experience at a bar before.

I came in the front entrance this time, so the place looked more put together than when I came via the backdoor, through the brewing room.\\n\\nHad their sampler of 11 beers for $10.  They are the relatively small sample glasses (compared to bigger ones used at some places), so it wasn't a great deal, but not a bad one either, and it is a good way to check out all the brews.  Most all of their beers are in the 3.5 to 4.5 star range in my book; however, their Summer Gose, a particular subspecies of German wheat beer, is quite unique and very, very good -- 5 stars.  It has a quasi-salty taste, which I assume is due to gypsum and other salts/minerals.  This might not sound good, but it really is.  After my sampler I had a cold glass of this and boy was it tasty and thirst quenching.\\n\\nThey have some really good food deals on TWT, amongst which are: $1 pulled-pork sliders, $1.25 fish tacos, and a cup of soup and a salad (good romaine lettuce) for $1.75.  The tacos were very good; the sliders were, admittedly, much improved by dipping in the extra salsa that came with the tacos (otherwise were lacking flavor, but the meat quality was good, and is BBQ on the premises in their backyard smoker); both these items came with some coleslaw or some sort of cabbage salad on top, which I appreciated, liking some vegetables with my meat dishes.  The soup wasn't bad and the salad was good (my one gripe was that I noticed others got tomatoes in theirs, while I didn't).  n.b.:  The TWT menu may very a little from week to week, but should have comparable items, I am assured.\\n\\nI don't understand the extremely harsh reviews regarding these happy hour items.  I can imagine the entrees aren't necessarily the best in the west, but for good happy hour menu items at rock-bottom prices, I can't imagine a better place.   I wouldn't come here looking for haute cuisine, but for very good beer and decent pub grub, this is the place, particularly if you are out on the west side.\\n\\nAnd Jake is a paragon of the easy-going yet attentive, and friendly bartender.  Very informative too."},{"name":"Ebisu On Robson","address":"827 Bute Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Ebisu on Robson is a Japanese-style izakaya (pub) - being very similar to Guu or Hapa.

I came here for a large birthday party and joined in the drunken debauchery, so I debated if I was qualified to give this place a fair review.\\n\\nThe food (sashimi, deep-fried softshell crab, etc) seems tasty enough but as not as adventurous as places like Guu or Hapa.  The portions were pretty small and pricey (as expected in a place like this) - but it's clearly not a problem as they are very busy and large groups coming and leaving.\\n\\nOn the plus side, as Lisa N. mentioned, they have nachos - and if you stick with the nachos and pitchers of beer - it's as cheap as other bars/pubs - except with a lively ambiance.  The 2L 'Big Boy' Asahi bottle is good for a laugh, but at $30 - I rather get two pitchers of draft.\\n\\nAnother clear sign that they are trying to cater to the drinking crowd is the shot menu - 4 for $16 or 4 for $20 - all listing the alcohol content.  The only downside is that you can't 'mix' your shots and when you order, you order 4 of the same thing.  So, go in a group or go with an alcoholic friend.\\n\\nAlso, the service is unimpressive (especially considering the forced gratuity for large groups) as the waitresses don't come around often enough for that next round of shots.\\n\\nFor what it set out to do, I think Ebisu on Robson meets expectations and is a good choice for large parties looking to get smashed.

Unfortunately, a friend and I had a very disappointing experience last weekend. My friend loves lobster and being teachers we hardly splurge on a lobster roll as they are expensive. But she decided to go for it at the cost of 22.00. I ordered a turkey sandwich and asked for no onions as I do not like them. Well, after a short wait our meals came out and to my friend's surprise the lobster roll had chopped up onions on it. Now, we have never ever heard of onions on a lobster roll so we would never think there would be any on it. She politely told the waitress that she was allergic to onions and couldn't eat the sandwich. The manager proceeded to come out with a wrapped up lobster roll and informs my friend that she could keep the made one and make another one but my friend would have to pay for it because she never anounced that she was allergic to onions. (Again....onions on a lobster roll?!?!) My friend was pretty livid and explained, pretty calmly, that she wasn't going to pay for another one and that perhaps they should mention on the menu if there were onions in the lobster salad. Meanwhile, my sandwich HAD ONIONS ON IT! Even though I asked for it without. So it begs the question....even if my friend did ask for no onions, would it have been followed through?!

Of course you would a joint called Blenders and Bowls in Austin... both have many usages of the word, am I right? Hehe... many Austinites do like the bowls, hm?\\n\\nThe bowls were interesting, and I had no idea it would be a granola bowl with a smoothie underneath! Definitely not a completely foreign idea, but not many healht eateries do it in this fashion. I appreciated the good amount of fruit that accompanied the acai.\\n\\nSo, they are keeping the offerings simple with smoothies and granola+smoothie bowls, but they are taking it a step further by revolving around the acai berrie. Yes, these things have somewhat of a bad reputation, gearing too much toward the \\"health nut, overrated\\" side, but why not eat them if they are a foreign fruit?\\n\\nMy OG bowl was no doubt expensive. At $7 for the amount of grub you would get in a $3.50 bowl of fro-yo, the steepness was just barely justified. The bowl had acai-apple juice smoothie topped with hemp granola, pollen (?), Round Rock honey, strawberries, and bananas. It contained just the right proportion of everything, so as to keep the product in a sort of tasty conglomeration.\\n\\nBlenders and Bowls is not extremely innovative in what it is doing, but being set on the new central 4th district, it is going to get some traffic once things get going. The only negative aspects about location is that parking is on the lower level, there is limited parking, and traffic is horrendous in this section of downtown. Nonetheless, I would recommend you drop in and try one of these tasty concoctions."},{"name":"Ball Square Cafe","address":"708 Broadway","city":"Somerville","stars":"4.5","text":"Ball Square does not earn five stars in my book, but TEN. I wanted to write this review as soon as possible so I don't miss any detail of the great experience I had. I was so stoked on coming because all of my friends kept saying how great the French Toast here was. Since it was my first time here, I was a little shocked and sad to see a wait outside Ball Square. My boyfriend and I didn't know whether you grab a number because it seemed like they were doing a \\"first come, first serve\\" seating basis. Anyways, as assumed, it was a first come, first serve system and we waited about 20-30 minutes in line, which is NOT bad compared to other places. While waiting, the owner, Mike, came out and told us the wait time and that drinks were self served. That's pretty neat that all of the coffees, teas, and water were self served. \\n\\nOnce we were seated, we knew what we wanted to order. We ordered the coconut macaroon French Toast, the Tuscan omelet, and a side of fries. We also got a cup of iced coffee, which was very creamy. The food came out at a pretty good pace, which is always a plus in my book. But wow, let me tell you about the French Toast... It was AMAZING. Mike told us that it was the best seller at the restaurant and I can totally see why. The challah bread was soft and gooey on the inside, while the coconut flakes were charred on the outside, giving it a nice subtle crunch. The best of both worlds. Mike told us that we didn't even need syrup with the French Toast and we believed him!! It went so well with the three dollops of whipped cream that it came with. The whipped cream was dense, so it doesn't melt like usual ones. It had a nice vanilla flavor that paired nicely with the bread. On top of everything, it was finished off with some condensed milk and raspberry drizzle, which all went so well together. I love having both a savory and a sweet dish, so the Tuscan omelet was great to have to counteract all of the sweetness from the French Toast. It came with fresh mozzarella, mushrooms, basil, and roasted red bell peppers. I give mad props to places that serve mozzarella because I'm not a big fan of other cheeses. Everything was so flavorful by itself, that I barely needed ketchup, salt, or pepper. It also came with grilled mash, which was just a block of mashed potatoes, and 4 pieces of toast. We also ordered a side of French fries, which came out piping hot because they were freshly made. \\n\\nOverall, this was a 10/10 dining out experience. I'd also like to mention our server, Raul?, who was friendly, attentive, and always had a smile whenever he would come by our table. I haven't had a friendly server like him in a while. Mike also came by our table and had a small conversation, which really added to our dining experience. He's a great guy who makes everyone feel welcomed and as if we were apart of the family.

My mother was able to look back on her phone at pictures from last year vs. this year. She even was able to compare menus  A majority of the menu items went up a $1, but the actual Thanksgiving feast meal or steak option were the same. They have a separate Thanksgiving meal menu than their standard one, but they still have a lot of options to choose from. I love that the Cheesy fondue is included in the menu. It's fun to share this as a table or eat all by one's self. The melted cheese is incredible and addicting. So smooth and warm. I also ordered their butternut squash and mushroom soup and their garden salad. They also had salmon as a menu choice besides traditional turkey. For dessert they had an authentic apple struedel or pumpkin pie. Everything was a la carte. The service was fast and orderly and we even ordered a blackberry cider glass boot to share as a table. The wait-staff were extremely stressed and busy, but despite this, things flowed well. I wish they would have more vegetarian sides like boiled or mashed potatoes, sweet potatoes, or brussel sprouts as add- ons.  Otherwise, I thought the food and service were great. It's moderately priced, but a great value on a holiday. The special offerings like choices of adding fondue and a glass boot beer or cider makes the event and occasion much more memorable.

I went in and the food was phenomenal but the service was completely subpar. They had a new guy working, a heavy set italian man with a thick accent and he just straight up ignored me several times! It seemed like he put everyone else before me! \\nI asked for a sweet tea to drink, he filled it only part of the way and by the time he came back with my food I'd drunk it up. I asked him for a refill and he just never came back! I had to get someone else to bring me a refill and by the time I'd almost finished eating, here he comes with a pitcher of tea! \\nThen I asked him for the check as he goes to get it and NEVER COMES BACK! I got upset and walked up to the cashier area. He came running over apologizing because he got \\"side tracked\\" and gave me my check and change. \\nI also got upset about his behavior before the incident with the sweet tea and the ignoring when he gave me my food I was a little upset as well because instead of just bringing it to me he stopped to talk to another table about the specials with my food in his hand! Just bring me the food and come back! Don't stand over there and talk while just holding my food in the air!\\nI left the restaurant wishing I hadn't given him a tip and it really makes me wonder if I'll ever go back.\\n--\\nI called the manager to report him shortly after I got home. Basically she took up for him a lot, said they were crowded and all the usual excuses so let me fill in the blanks here.\\n\\n1. When I first got there, I was the only person in the sitting area to the left.  During the duration of my visit two tables on that side, tables for two people only, were filled. On the right, there weren't a lot of people that I could tell. When I came in I peeked to the right and could only see a few tables filled. Maybe there were more people stretching back into the room, maybe there weren't. But I do know there were more people there/coming in when I left then when I first came. And the place was pretty bare/quiet when I first came in so there is no excuse.\\n\\n2. The woman on the phone claimed the man had to go make tea and that's what took so long. She talked over me and she wouldn't give me the chance to ask my question. If he was MAKING TEA then why was the waitress I asked for tea able to BRING ME TEA before the NEW TEA was made?! And the pitcher he was bringing when I saw him wasn't even a new pitcher it was HALF FILLED!\\n\\n3. She says he's their best server and he was just trying to pick up some slack, but like I said it wasn't very crowded. I've been in here before when the place was PACKED and I still received better service than I did today. She said the place was short staffed so he had to pick up the slack, but I like I said, I didn't see a lot of people! And even if I didn't see them I would be able to HEAR them and the place was damn near dead quiet when I came in.\\n\\n4. She claimed he would never ignore me intentionally, but I WAS THE ONLY ONE! He didn't treat anyone else like that and everyone in the restaurant noticed that he wasn't attending to me like he was to them. I was second best at most to him! So he could have taken the five seconds it takes to pour me some tea or to take my check before whisking away to do something else. He just didn't want to.\\n\\n5. About the check- she couldn't make any excuses for that especially since he came running after he saw me there which means if I hadn't gotten up he would've just let me sat there which let me know I wasn't a priority. Which I should always feel that I am because I am a customer. Anyways, it's safe to say that I won't be coming back. It's a shame because this was my favorite hole in the wall Italian spot.

You probably have 50 to 100 different options and a few of them are really good.\\n\\nHubert's is the absolute best for pierogies and sausages and delicious homemade Polish food from a very wonderful owner.\\n\\nFailing that, there's a popular chicken shop upstairs that I haven't tried yet, as well as some fancy ice cream and macarons, and a pretty good pizza slice. The pretzels aren't bad. I haven't found anything as good as Hubert's but I'm still exploring and looking.\\n\\nThe best time of year to come here is during the Arnold event. It's right across the street from here, so even though parking gets tricky you're looking at an entire Market full of perfect specimens of both the male and female variety. The place turns into one of the best people-watching meccas anywhere, one of the most amazing eye candy destinations you'll ever see. Sort of like Sunset Boulevard on a Saturday night but in a smaller space and far fitter. Really... You'll think you're in California for a few minutes. Although if you were in Cali, it'd take a few hours just to find parking.

You can order them as a five piece plate, or a ten piece. \\n \\nFrom the Stir-Fry menu, we ordered the Beef Haw Fun. This is a mixture of Chinese stir-fried wide rice noodles, sliced steak, scallions, onions and bean sprouts tossed in soy sauce that was quite tasty.\\n\\nAnother dish we had from the Stir-Fry menu was the Stir Fry Udon which consists of Stir-fried udon noodles with chicken, eggs, onions, scallions, carrots and bean sprouts.

Ridiculous.  You couldn't tell where the wrapping ended and the potato began- the gnocci was just that well made where the flour and the potato starch became one.  And when gnocci like this is teamed with a perfectly tasting pesto drizzled with shaved parmesan, you are in food heaven.  The roasted cauliflower was full of flavor and had the perfect texture to complement the softness of the gnocci.  At  our first bite of this dish, we just looked at each other and basically thought, \\"ARE YOU SERIOUS?\\".  What a way to start our meal... (5)\\n\\n2) Smoked Trout and caviar with egg crostini topped with sprouts-  This just being our second item of the night, was another perfect blend of flavors and textures.  With each bite of our tastily decorated crostini, we couldn't believe how well the distinct flavors from each of the elements came together.  (4.75)\\n\\n3) Clams with smoked tomato, black bean, and chorizo broth- Fresh clams swimming in this creative concoction brought our taste buds yet another delightful experience.  The nuttiness of the black beans and the heartiness of the chorizo's flavor complemented the smoked tomato base which all combined to bring a zesty kick to the clams.  I found myself scraping at the rest of the broth after all the clams were done.  The broth was on the salty side, but I don't care.  This was good. (4.75)\\n\\n4) Tri-tip steak with winter vegetables, arugula, and horseradish sauce- Slices of perfectly grilled medium-rare tri tip steak, placed on top of a small pile of  roasted fingerling potatoes, carrots, kale, and small red onion, all on top of a creamy (with a bit of tanginess) horseradish sauce.  I didn't taste that much horseradish in the horseradish sauce, but it worked out perfectly with the roasted vegetables on top of it.  There was so much flavor in the roasted vegetables themselves that they almost outshined the tri-tip.  Almost.  The presence of fragrant roasted kale made itself known throughout each bite of the amalgamation of roasted vegetables.  *shakes head* So simple, yet so good.  (5)\\n\\n5) Braised Cabbage with Buckwheat polenta- This was really the only \\"ok\\" dish of the night.  There was just too much butter in this dish.

Trips to Marietta are always hectic with two young grandsons and so much to do in so little time.\\n\\nWe did try on one occasion and waited too late and when we called for reservations, we could not get a time that worked for us.\\n\\nThis time, we made the reservations a week in advance with no trouble. Good thing we allowed extra time because I have no idea where On Star was going and it the end, ended up using my Smart Phone for the last couple of miles.\\n\\nEverything is valet parking since parking is limited and the restaurant shares a parking lot with other establishments. Granted the valet parking is complimentary but we always give the valets a little something extra. This was especially true since it was raining.\\n\\nWe got there are exactly the appointed time and were greeted and immediately seated.\\n\\nDark Red Leather and Dark wood accenting the Brick give a warm rich atmosphere.  We got here after dark but you can see that this place also has vistas of the Chattahoochee River which flows right outside the restaurant.  Will have to try it in the Spring for Brunch.\\n\\nIt's a very creative and eclectic menu with a lot of different offerings. Perfect for those with an adventuresome palette.\\n\\nI started with an unusual appetizer and that was Peppercorn Crusted Kangaroo, Arame Salad and Peanut-Miso Satay.  \\n\\nYou would expect it to be touch but was well braised and was actually more tender than the Duck I had for my Entree. For that matter, the taste even reminded me of Duck which is good because Duck is one of my Favorites.\\n\\nFor my entree, as I mentioned I had Duck or more specifically , Wood Roasted Duck Breast, Baby Root Vegetable, Duck Rillettes, Cranberry, Olive Granache.  It was delicious. The Duck Breast was cut into bite sized medallions and a nice flavor accented by the Granache. Will definitely be on list of dishes to order again\\n\\nMy wife ordered the Veal Bolognese with Garganelli Pasta, Apple Wood Bacon and Black Pepper-Basil Ricotta which was an interesting pairing.\\n\\nVery good and interesting twist on thing and a bit different from the Veal Scallopini or Veal Medallion cuts she normally gets.\\n\\nWe did not have one server the entire evening but rather they worked as a team and in the end, we actually ended up with what was probably three and they all did a great job.\\n\\nOne more comment and that is we had been given a gift card for Canoe probably two year ago if not longer.  Most restaurants, if you don't use the gift card within a year, the value or balance on the card starts to go down.\\n\\nNot here. We got full value for the card despite the time which is an indication that the restaurant stands behind their reputation.\\n\\nDefinitely a keeper and we will be back for Sunday Brunch some time in the Spring."},{"name":"Jin Wah Restaurant","address":"4021 SW 117th Ave, Ste E","city":"Beaverton","stars":"3","text":"3 stars because the food is still good, although the pepper salted squid can be hit or miss.

The store is mostly white paneling and tile with nice bursts of blue and green in the decor.  Very simple but very cozy.  There is only a few tables, bar tables and some outside seating. Walking in had the most pleasant smell of goodness. \\n\\nMenu - This menu is very straight forward.  The menu is Hispanic and Korean fusion which works surprisingly well since their claim to fame is using kimchi. For anyone who doesnt know, Kimchi is fermented salted vegetables mostly consisting of radishes and napa cabbage.  Their prized  dish is the Kimchi fries.  The rest of the menu is very simple to follow, it is literally step 1 thru 6. Pick your base, protein, vegetables, toppings, sauces and extras. They have an awesome variety of products for each category.  The unique thing about the way you order is that all the ingredients can be made into whatever you want, like a rice / noodle bowl or a burrito, maybe you want it on a salad, heck you may even want it all slapped together on a beef patty and 2 buns.  Its your choice.  It is kinda interesting.\\n\\nService - As soon as i walked in there were 2 employees cleaning the dining room and they welcomed me in. As soon as i got to the area to order, there was 2 very pleasant ladies who helped me thru the menu as this was my first time here. They were very polite and understanding of me looking over the menu for a few minutes. They answered all my newbie questions and they actually seemed sincere.  I apologized a few times for doing things out of order and the lady making my food was like \\"dude no worries\\" Thats not what she said but she was just very understanding and helpful.  The cashier im pretty sure was new as she made a mistake ringing in my order, forgot to give me my drink cup and receipt. But thats ok because she was friendly and the rest of the crew helped her out without hesitation.  Tip of the hat Chi'Lantro, this is what customer service is.  Being patient and understanding, making people feel welcome, and having a team that is super helpful to me and their crew.  +2 points!\\n\\nFood - So i got their prized Kimchi Fries. When i first started to order i ordered the fries and was about to order an entree, but the lady told me that the fries is actually more of entree rather than an app.  And she was right, the Kimchi fries was a very nice potion of fries and goodness.  So the fries come with your choice of protein, Kimchi, monterey+cheddar cheese, onions, cilantro, sesame seeds, MAGIC sauce and Sriracha.  The fries came in one of the traditional paper boats but was piled high with greasy goodness. I got my fries with the pork and i was not disappointed. So i carefully try to mix my food up without it all falling over so that i can get a taste of everything in each bite.  Now these were some awesome fries. The condiments worked well with each other and had a great amount of spicy.  Not super overwhelming but hot enough to make your nose run a bit.  It was a perfect burn.  Now the part that was awesome was that Kimchi didnt feel out of place.  I mean come on, who would have thought that having pickled vegetables on loaded fries would be a thing?!  The Kimchi gave it a great zing to each bite that was great with spicy and fried goodness.  I dont know what the magic sauce it but it was tasty.  I wish i had a refined palette so i could know different ingredients and spices just by taste. The pork was moist and flavorful and had great texture.  I was surprised.  The amount of food i got was just perfect as i was full when i finished and i had finished the meal, so great portion size. Now the only thing that was \\"bad\\" was that the description says on a bed of crispy fries.  My fries were not that crispy at all, they were cooked fully but didnt have that crunch that i was expecting.  This would have been better if they were because by the time i got near the end, the fries were extra \\"soggy\\" or \\"wimpy\\" because of all the toppings soaking in.  However, that is just a very minor detail.  My fries were freaking amazing, i have never had a twist like this for fries and it worked very well.  I left satisfied and good about my purchase.\\n\\nOverall - I had a great experience.  Good customer service, great product and reasonably priced.  I paid $8 for the fries and $2 for a drink.  Not bad considering the ingredients involved.  I am definitely looking forward to going back to try one of the make your our bowl. If they can do fries that good, then i cant wait to try the entree bowl.

Although the portion is great I didn't find it as flavourful and is a bit too thick of a cut compared to some of the other places I had tried before. The thick cut takes a bit of the flavour away because the meat inside isn't marinated so the flavour is all from the batter and coating outside. It's a good place to try.
