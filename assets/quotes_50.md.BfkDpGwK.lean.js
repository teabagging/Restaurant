Ever.\\n\\nGrowing up in California, I had a Veggie Grill ten minutes away from my house but somehow it took me seventeen years before I stepped foot in one. And thank god I did, because I was quickly going back every week - it singlehandedly became the restaurant that helped me show that eating plant-based foods was not only a viable lifestyle, but something that could taste so damn good at the same time.\\n\\nSo when I moved away to the Boston area for college in 2018, naturally, one of the first things I did was check for a Veggie Grill. I was disappointed to find that there weren't any East Coast locations open at the time, but after doing some digging, found that the first location was opening right here in Harvard Square!\\n\\nI was ecstatic to say the least. So you can imagine how high my expectations were going in before eating here my first time. And needless to say, it did not disappoint.\\n\\nBefore I get into the individual menu reviews on the food, some general words of advice for those new to Veggie Grill. I would strongly recommend starting with the \\"fan favorites\\" (they're starred on the menu) as those rarely disappoint. I feel as though the seasonal menu items can be a lot more hit or miss, despite how good some of them may sound on paper.\\n\\nSo without further adieu, these are my thoughts on the food.\\n\\n--Sandwiches--\\n\\nSanta Fe Crispy Chickin' - (10/10)\\nClassic sandwich - this has to be one of the all time great foods ever made to man. No exaggerations here. I've introduced my meat-eating friends to this sandwich and I've heard some people say it's better than Chik-fil-A. It's such a balanced sandwich, and I really enjoy it every time I have it. The seemingly simple combination of the chickin' patty, guac, onions/lettuce, and the whole wheat bun creates an experience far greater than the sum of its parts.\\n\\nBuffalo Bomber - (9/10)\\nGreat sandwich if you love Buffalo sauce. Haven't had it at this location, but it's one of my favorites so I had to give it a shoutout in this review.\\n\\nBeyond Burger 'Cheesesteak Sandwich' (seasonal item) - 6/10\\nNothing wrong with this one, but it's just lacking a bit of oomph in my opinion. The one I had was a little under-seasoned, but even after adding salt myself I wasn't the biggest fan of this sandwich. Perhaps it's because I've never loved cheesesteaks even when I was still eating meat.\\n\\n--Burgers--\\n\\nVG Beyond Burger - (6.5/10)\\nMy girlfriend got this one the second time we came here, and it was solid in my opinion. Tasted like a reasonably good burger, but nothing made it stand out from the fast food Beyond Burger's I've had (and this one's a bit more pricey) so that's why it gets this rating.\\n\\nIf you're craving a burger, I've had much better experiences with the Super Rica Burger (probably like a 8/10) and the LUXE burger (also an 8/10). I haven't had them at this location though, so I'll refrain from saying too much about them.\\n\\n--Bowls--\\n\\nFar East Bowl - (9.5/10)\\nOkay, I must admit I've always been wary of the bowls at Veggie Grill, so this was my first time trying one. And holy bleep it was good. This was a really balanced bowl, flavors were subtle but powerful, and meshed really well together. The mint in here is an absolute delight and the sauce too is really light/delicious. Would strongly recommend.\\n\\n--Sides--\\n\\nCrispy Cauliflower - (9.5/10)\\nSoooo good. Ask for both of the sauces, and you can switch between buffalo and orange 'chicken' sauce. Really pleasantly surprised me, not too heavy of an appetizer but also greasy enough to make you feel good about yourself :)\\n\\nFries - (5.5/10)\\nTo be totally honest, veggie grill fries have always been amongst my favorite fries at any restaurant that I've been to (I'm looking at you In-n-out). But the second time that I came to this location, I was pretty disappointed with the fries I received - they weren't as hot or as crispy as they should've been. I talked to the manager about it and he gave me a second batch. These were definitely much better (that's why I'm bumping these up to a 5.5) but still, something wasn't the same.\\n\\nSpicy Beef Barley Soup - (4/10)\\nI struggle to enjoy the soups at Veggie Grill. This one tasted overwhelmingly of tomato sauce, and felt like it lacked a lot of other necessary seasonings. I've also had the lentil soup at other locations and wasn't super impressed by them.\\n\\nAlright that's it for my food item reviews. Before I sign out, I have to give a shoutout to the Veggie Grill staff, they are super warm and friendly. JR is one of my favorite guys at Veggie Grill (I've known him from my old home location in California!!) and I was really glad to see a familiar face here.\\n\\nOkay folks, I know that was a bit long but hopefully that helped encourage you to come try out Veggie Grill and better navigate the menu. I can't stress to you enough how much I love this place and really encourage you (whether you're plant-based or not) to come and try out their food.

The food comes out fast once it is ordered but expect a line on busy days!  Most of the staff is friendly and smile but there is always one girl at the main register who never smiles... It's like she does not want to be there or us totally board with her job and all the customers (the reason for only 4 stars).

I usually opt for the daily special sandwich which has always been tasty.

The chopped celery was unusual but made for a fresh addition to the sand which overall. \\n\\nThe sides, which change daily, have always been to my liking. The pasta salad is usually very fresh and light, not smothered in a sauce. They have had a pulled pork potato hash.

I'm a local resident who has been here countless times. Each previous time has been pleasurable.  Until tonite.i brought a group of 7 here. Was proud to show them a good place to eat.  \\n\\nWe were greated well and told to find a seat. We sat. Then told (rudely), we we not in the right spot. Then we moved. Same again. Then told there was a flag or something  at the end of each 50 foot long table that some how  indicated  it was reserved  or something.  \\n\\nMind you, I live here (like on Rainey  St) and have been coming here for years. \\n\\nSo the \\"waitress\\" that I talked to and asked where we should actually sit stated, \\"it's VERY clear.

I can't be to only one who's noticed this, right? I've began to wonder if the name Nick is supposed to be some sort of restaurant title, like chef.\\n\\n-----\\n\\nNick's Food To Go is still one of the premier places in Atlanta for a great gyros, but no longer my favorite. \\n\\nI hadn't been to Nick's in a while and happened to be in the area visiting Oakland Cemetery. Part of the fun of coming to Nick's is whether or not Nick himself is in a mood. He's one of those feisty / fiery personalities that can either be super cool or going completely off on somebody! Today was one if his more feisty moods. I greeted him and told him I was happy to see him open, because I had read reports somewhere that he was closed. Why oh why did I say that!!!  That set him off on a 5 minute rant cussing and fussing about his haters. Between his heavy accent and the middle finger he kept throwing up to all the people who try to bring him down, I just smiled and nodded in agreement so as to stay out of the line of fire. \\"You know what I am saying\\" he says when he was calm. \\"Yes sir I do\\" I said, trying not to get him any more rev'd up than I already had! Apparently he had taken a vacation for a couple of weeks, but people began reporting that he was out of business.\\n\\nWhat I love about Nick's is it feels just like the hole in the wall gyro shop I frequented daily in high school back in Chicago, which was also called Nick's! I've been coming here off and on for almost 2 decades and this was the first time I felt like I didn't get the usual amount of meat nor did it taste as awesome as it usually does. The french fries on the other hand were on point. \\n\\n-----\\n\\n\\nFINAL THOUGHTS\\n\\nMy culinary journey since discovering yelp a few years back has taken me all over the city, especially in the four years since I've written my previous review. While Nick's would still rank in my top five gyros, I must say this will probably be my last visit. It was great to see Nick again and I still highly recommend this place. It's an Atlanta institution with a reliable track record, but it's a bit of a drive for a northern suburb dweller like me and I've found a few locations that do an equally great job at making gyros (possibly one of my favorite sandwiches in all the world). However, if Halal Guys ever comes to Atlanta from NYC then it's over.

As soon as the chef started to cook, I noticed that he was pushing the meats right up against the vegetables, and I politely asked if he could put some vegetables to the side so they didn't come in contact with the meat. His attitude towards me was extremely rude and he snapped at me over something as simple as not wanting the meat to touch my vegetables. After a few minutes of debating (for no good reason) he told me I could have them cooked in the kitchen... something he should've started off with instead of giving me such rude remarks, scoffing and rolling his eyes.

Today she went out with Grandma so I suggested this restaurant to my husband and finally he said yes.\\n\\nThis place is nothing fancy, basically just a hole in the wall next to a 7-11, but it looks fairly new and it is extremely clean.  There was a line nearly out the door, and 3/4 of the people eating were Asian, so I took that as a very good sign.\\n\\nI think the reason there was such a line was because their system is a little confusing.  I've read that restaurants in Korea don't usually have cashiers.  You go up to a touch screen, put in your order, and they put it in a slot or window and you go up and get it.  This is what it's sort of like here.  There's a touch screen and you put in your order, then sit down and wait, but there's no sign explaining it.  I think a bunch of people in line were confused, because I heard, 'Where is the cashier?' 'How do I order?' etc.  There was one waitress serving everyone's meals and she was stopped several times because no one knew what to do.\\n\\nWell, finally it was our turn.  We ordered the pan fried dumplings as a starter, and I ordered the japchae, which is Korean sweet potato noodles stir-fried with veggies and slices of pork.  My husband ordered the bibimbap with bulgogi beef, which is steamed white rice topped with steamed spinach, Korean radish, bean sprouts, green squash, carrots, freshly grilled bulgogi beef and a sunny-side-up up egg.  He ordered his egg over hard and also had a side of kimchi.\\n\\nI'm glad I ordered the starter because our meal took a while to be served.  The pan fried dumplings came out crazy hot but they were really good.  They sort of taste like fried spring rolls.  When I got the Japchae, I thought it was really good.  I didn't order it spicy, so I thought it was a little bland at first, but I put some soy sauce on it and it took it over the top to delicious.  It's served on a small plate so I thought it wouldn't be enough, but I was stuffed when I was finished.  It sort of tasted like really fresh, home made ramen.\\n\\nMy husband's meal came out in a huge flaming hot stoneware bowl.  I tried some and it was really good, sort of like fancy stir-fry.

Hamlet is the new incarnation of Ryan's passion for great cocktails, good food and laid-back atmosphere, and Chefstable's passion for opening solid projects. One visit and I'm hooked. \\n\\nHamlet is a pretty straightforward concept. Cocktails, Wine and Swine. You can enjoy complex yet perfectly balanced drinks ranging from straightforward to out there. I sampled his Iberian Road Soda, a rare highball-style sparkling water drink with no sugar added. This slightly bitter, slightly floral, totally refreshing bubbler could be an any-day, any-time drink for me. So good. The Melon vs. Meat is like a prosciutto-wrapped melon ball in cocktail form - with fresh melon juice and a crispy ham garnish. It would be a novelty if it weren't so damn tasty. The Piggy Back, a shot of Vida Mezcal paired with a ramekin of sliced ham, is a salty, smoky treat. \\n\\nWhile I didn't sample the food, the menu reads like any good small-bites bar menu should. Tasty hams of various origin, and concoctions made thereof. Service is totally on point, but without the pretense that pervades most Pearl District proprietors. The prices?

It was years ago, but I had just moved to Atlanta and she was giving me the rundown of all the must-try places.  She raved about this bakery and I thought, \\"Really?  Can it be all THAT?\\"\\n\\nThen once I tried SS I sounded just like her.  I started obsessing over their layer cakes that looked like something out of a storybook (huge!), and especially went wild for their Red Velvet and Caramel.  I really liked their Key Lime Pie too.  Even though it didn't have whipped topping, it was so lip-poppingly tart and sweet that I didn't miss it.\\n\\nOn my last visit, I stopped by on my way from the farmer's market.  It was before 10am so my intent was to go in, inhale fresh-baked smells, ogle the cakes behind the glass, order *something* to legitimize those activities and leave.  I'm not above eating cake for breakfast, but I decided to get an item from their actual breakfast menu.\\n\\nI went with the Rustic Country Cheese Toast ($4.95) and added a scrambled egg ($1.29).  The menu described the toast as \\"topped with Vermont sharp cheddar\\" but I assumed that was just flowery menu speak.  I decoded that to mean a slice of cellophane-wrapped American cheese on a thin slice of white bread.  But I was SO wrong.\\n\\nWhen I got back in my car with the takeout container I popped the top.  I literally gasped like it was a diamond ring box opening.  I was surprised to see two slices of crusty, artisan-style bread.  Each was coated with a thick oozy layer cheddar cheese that stretched elastically when I tore off a corner of bread.  I loved every crispy-melty bite!!!  The eggs were tasty too.\\n\\nI was able to resist the siren song of their brownies & bars, tarts, cheesecakes and pound cake...at least this time.  Part of me wants to join their dessert of the month program (so they can deliver cakes, pies and tarts to my door) but then I would probably have to invest in a new wardrobe too.  So not for now.\\n\\nI should mention one other thing:  don't expect to pay grocery store bakery prices here.  At SS you have to pay for what you'll get--only the highest quality ingredients.  They use fresh eggs, Belgian Callebaut chocolate and Madagascar vanilla.  But everything comes together to produce beautiful, richly flavored desserts that are worth the price.\\n \\nTreats from Southern Sweets are a worthwhile purchase for any special event.  They also nicely complement all those fresh greens and vegetables you'll pick up at the farmer's market."},{"name":"Donair King Restaurant","address":"1028 Davie Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Yum!

I'm not sure what they're going for, it's just a mess of everything anyone ever wanted to create in their backyard. \\n\\nThey have a stage for live music, but it can be overpowering and too loud to talk. There's kids running loose, and there's a doggie fenced area for dogs, but most people keep them on a leash next to them seated outside. They should probably put a leash on their kids too. There's even doggie treats on the menu. We came here on a Monday for a belated birthday celebration. No wait, but still a pretty full place. Everywhere else on Rainey was dead. Was there happy hour?

I went with the beet & goat cheese brat. Most of the sauces & toppings that were available were not things that would pair well with what I ordered. Beets and ketchup? Beets and saurkraut?

The eggs were poached perfectly and everything else about this dish was just great.

They gave a generous portion and the shrimps were perfect in size. They didn't skimp here, which is great since it got me full halfway. It was all seasoned perfectly. Even though I was feeling full, i still fought to finish the entire thing. I don't think i'll be getting this again since it is on the heavier side for me, but get it at least once to try since it is that good! \\n\\nAnother one of my favorite memories of Joy's Cafe are the complimentary baked pastries they bring you for an appetizer.

We had heard great things about their homemade sausages, great brunch and the live music from 12-3PM so this was on our priority list of places to try. We arrived around 11:30 AM and the place was already packed (indoors and outdoors) with a line out the door and onto the sidewalk. If it wasn't for the long night on 6th Street the night before, we would have gotten here when it opened (~10AM) but oh well that couldn't be helped. There were probably 5-6 parties in front of us (all groups) ahead of our group of 6 and it took at least 40 minutes before making it inside where a host said it would take another 45 minutes before getting a table. We were about to choose a different brunch restaurant when luckily another hostess walked over and said they had a table indoors for 6 if we wanted it (of course we did!). \\n\\nSeating is communal with long picnic tables both indoors and outside. There are heat lamps outdoors so even if it's a bit chilly you can still sit outside. What's really cool is that the live band performing outside were hooked up to mic's that fed into the speaker system inside the indoor section of Banger's. Even though we weren't able to sit outside, we could still clearly hear the awesome live music that was being played (brass band playing a mix of pop, country and other genres).\\n\\nOn to the food...I ordered the Bierwurst to share with a friend and the \\"Banger's Benny\\" - their take on an egg's benedict (braised pork belly, poached egg w/ hollandaise sauce on two english muffins with shoestring potatoes). The bierwurst was fantastic and I can see why Banger's is known for its sausages - nicely spiced and flavored that paired well with a side of spicy mustard sauce. \\n\\nThe \\"Banger's Benny\\" was very disappointing. Firstly, the shoestring potatoes were poured on top of the tray and covered everything. There has to be a better way to present the dish because it looked like a complete mess (see pic below). Secondly, the \\"poached\\" eggs were very much overcooked and both had solid yolks - it's disappointing that such a successful restaurant could botch such a simple thing. I did enjoy the braised pork belly - it had a slightly crispy exterior that was smokey and delicious. \\n\\nOverall, I wish I had stuck with ordering their sausages instead of the poorly done \\"Banger's Benny\\". I was able to try my friend's Fried Chicken and Waffle (it's a fried chicken sausage) as well as a piece of the jalapeno cheddar bratwurst that had a nice spicy kick. Both I liked a lot and hands down would get the next time I visit. Although the \\"Benny\\" I ordered was very disappointing, I won't let that spoil my opinion of Banger's. I think the sausages were indeed fantastic and well worth more visits back. I'm looking forward to coming back!\\n\\nOh, I forgot to mention they have 1L samosas!

The smoked lamb used mix of cumin and ancho that offered a spicy counterpoint to the lamb's mild gaminess. Sides consisted of radishes with citrus and traditional Texas chili. We also sampled the orange bread pudding with buttermilk ice cream.

It's a small, sparsely decorated, humble restaurant.  I stopped by for Wednesday lunch with a couple friends to check this place out.  The restaurant is located in one of the many non-descript strip malls that dot Spring Rd.  There's not a whole lot out this way.\\n\\nInside the restaurant, there's a bar which looks into the open kitchen.  You can see the chefs/cooks prepare just about everything from start to finish.  The dining area has two TVs and there are picnic tables outside (with umbrellas) for patio dining.  Casual atmosphere.  Around 12pm, there weren't many customers for lunch.  Just us and a couple other tables.  There was plenty of staff.  I think they outnumbered us.\\n\\nUpon seating, we were given a lengthy wine list and lunch menus.  The lunch menu is simple and consists of soups (seafood, minestrone), appetizers (Caprese salad, calamari, meatballs, mussels, clams), salads, entrees (stuffed cannelloni, spaghetti carbonara, salmon penne, lasagna, salmon), and desserts (cannoli, tiramisu, chocolate mousse).  Generally, soups and appetizers run about $6-7 each and salads and entrees run about $10-12 each.\\n\\nThe owner/manager, Alessandro, served us.  We started off with bread and olive oil and vinegar.  The bread was served already sliced into small pieces, so we didn't have to deal with tearing off pieces from a loaf ourselves.  The bread was already flavorful by itself.  I can't put my finger on what kind of bread it was, but it was light, soft, and fluffy.  Generous portions.\\n\\nI sampled a few items off the menu.  They were:\\n\\nTrout special ($12.50) with pasta noodles and vegetables\\nSpaghetti carbonara ($9.95)\\nRoasted salmon with broccoli and garlic (aglio e olio) spaghetti ($12.95)\\n\\nThe trout wasn't on the lunch menu and was a special the owner told us about.  He told us the trout was fresh and after tasting it, I believe it to be.  It was marinated and garnished with cherry tomatoes and chopped zucchini.  It came with a side of aglio e olio spaghetti, which is a simple yet delicious Italian spaghetti dish.\\n\\n\\"Aglio e olio\\" means garlic and [olive] oil.  The thin spaghetti noodles were sauteed with garlic and olive oil and topped with dried red chili flakes and finely chopped parsley.  This spaghetti dish also came with the roasted salmon entree.\\n\\nI eat a lot of salmon at home and the roasted salmon fillet here reminded me of the fillets I get at Sam's Club and Costco.  Fortunately, Mezza Luna's version was better than what I make at home.  The fish was more tender and juicy, even in its thickest parts.  I'm not sure how fresh the fish was though.  It may have been frozen all the same.\\n\\nThe salmon was seasoned with black pepper and came with the aforementioned pasta plus broccoli.  There wasn't anything special about the broccoli.  The broccoli consisted of small, fresh, deep green florets that appeared to be sauteed.  No sauces, seasonings (except perhaps a light dash of salt), or other ingredients.  Overall, the roasted salmon dish was healthy and simple.\\n\\nThe spaghetti carbonara was tasty.  A simple dish by nature, its only ingredients (that I could tell) were egg, cheese, bacon, parsley, and black pepper.  All of the plates looked and tasted like home-cooked meals.\\n\\nService was phenomenal.  It helped the restaurant wasn't busy.

Perhaps it's the fact that - good or bad- EVERY trip to the waffle house is an experience (Seriously, have you ever been to a Waffle House and left without an interesting story to tell?). Or it could be that it's the perfect place to go when I'm missing mama and grandma and want somebody to call me 'baby' and 'sugah' while they serve me food that I KNOW isn't good for me but tastes soooo right.\\n\\nIt's a Saturday and I've foregone my usual laziness, instead opting to go out and run some early morning errands. Feeling proud that I'm up, dressed, and finished with most of my to-dos before noon, I decide to reward myself with a little breakfast. Cresting a hill, I spy that familiar sign - two simple words spelled out in garish yellow squares - and I feel an instant twinge of nostalgia. As soon as I ask myself, \\"Should I...?\\" my stomach responds with an approving grumble, and my hands comply by turning the steering wheel towards the parking lot.\\n\\nI'm greeted at the door by one of the waitresses whose name I'm certain is either Flo or Gladys or Shirley or something very similar. I choose an empty seat at the counter and she hands me a menu. I'm instantly absorbed in the familiar quick-order cacophony of jangling silverware and clanking dishes, sizzling food on grill, punctuated by the shrill voices of waitresses hollering out orders in a drawling language only spoken here:\\n\\"Pull! One chicken plate! Drop 2 hashbrowns! 1 scattered, covered, and diiiced, 1 scattered, covered, smothered, and chunked!\\"\\n\\nWelcome to the House.\\n\\nImmediately the grill cook - a big dude with his hair tied back in a long, Boo-Ya Tribe ponytail (leg-chain missing) gets to work. He adds a new round of oil to the griddle, and begins grabbing additional supplies from the nearby fridge, then sets to rhythmically flipping, scrambling, and shifting all the items on the grill. It's just as much performance art as it is sheer short-order genius.\\n\\nAs I wait for my tried-and-true order of a waffle, a side of sausage, and hash browns - scattered, covered, and smothered, I ponder a couple of stickers positioned above the grill. Both are written in Waffle-speak. 1 reads: 'Don't Turn and Burn', and the other: 'Kill the Flame and Get in the Game'.\\n\\nSoon, the meaning of the latter becomes apparent. In a 5-minute lull in the steady flow of customers and orders, the floors are swept, the waffle irons de-crusted, and napkin dispensers refilled. All the while, the staff exchanges sassy comments and witty replies. Everything here - including the banter - moves with a sort of synchronized, snappy timing.\\n\\nAfter I finish my meal and pay the check, the waitress who served me drawls loudly from across the room, \\"Okay, huuun.

Habanero is legit, populated in large part more by local Latinos than college students because it's authentic. They're really more Latin American because they offer pupusas and soups that you more commonly see outside of Mexico in El Salvador, Guatamalan cusine, etc.  So now on to the food:  It was very tasty and overall an A-.  The pupusa was fabulous flavor but overcooked so the cheese ran out and the inside was too hot. The cabbage slaw that it comes with was savory but lacked a little spice that makes it perfect. The quesadilla is made more gringo-style, with a lot of sour cream that I'd pass on in a future trip, but the salsa it came with was over the top good.\\n\\nThe people running it are super nice, and the tiny restaurant is kept immaculately clean. The worn down stool covers should probably get replaced.  That and the blown out pupusa cost it a star, but I'd be happy to come back there and give them five.  It's better than any other food experience in the Latin realm on this strip that I've tried in four years."},{"name":"North Market","address":"59 Spruce St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"Ridiculous amounts of variety!

If go up the road to PHO88, you can experience broth made to perfection, rich and complex flavors. Also, ramen noodles in an Asian restaurant should never be the cheap type of noodle you get for 14 cents at Wal-Mart. I hope more people get experience real Japanese ramen noodles. Honestly, nothing like the cheap stuff, night and day. Service was also bad. The restaurant was packed, which honestly, I now cannot understand why. Guess someone paid off the Orlando Weekly staff, because the Asian food is among the worst in town. Anyhow, the waitress messed up the order and only served 3 of 4 entrees ordered. Then it took a long time to get the 4th order to table, totally ruined the meal. The coconut shrimp appetizer was over cooked, and looked like the deep fryer oil needs changed because shrimp was more dark brown then golden. Other items sent to table were simply fail to impress.

I mean, it doesn't matter which Chuy's we hit up when we have a craving, we can always count on the same experience.  (Yeah I know Chuy's haters, we like it so whatever) I would call us somewhat regulars at DD.  Usually sit at the little bar for noshing, champers and wine.  Or pop by to pick up the meat.  However, I will admit, our last visit was a wee bit of a disappointment.  It's not inexpensive to eat here, so when the level of cost is raised on items which generally are fairly simple and inexpensive elsewhere, I guess one would would expect a nice twist or at least the common item prepared correctly.  For example, on our last stop with 5 friends on Saturday 12.22, was one of those experiences.\\n\\nI ordered the Venison Biscuits/Gravy with an egg as did one of my guests.  I was remembering a wonderful B/G there in the past.  For a small reference point, IHOP has two eggs, 4 pork links, biscuit/gravy and hash browns for $8.95, Jim's two biscuits, gravy and diced sausage $3.59.  Obviously the Venison 3oz patty is not served with these examples, so that would fetch a premium.  In this case $15 an entree for our brekkies.  Here is the conundrum.  The biscuits we had, well, no bueno.  I don't know if they didn't keep the butter/flour cold prior to preparing?  Was buttermilk used?  Did they over work the dough?  Or perhaps the oven wasn't hot enough to facilitate rising?  Whatever the process, the biscuits were hard and tough.  When Charlotte came by once everyone was done to pick up the plates, I noticed my guest had taken a few bites of her plate, ate the patty and some gravy, left almost all of her biscuits.  I only managed to eat one of the biscuits.  I mentioned to our server that the biscuits were definitely off this time around.  She did reply politely, we have a new gal preparing them so she would mention this to her.\\n\\nAlthough my guest agreed that her biscuits were flat and tough, we had also ordered all four of the pastries to share with the table, which were very tasty.  In addition, there were compliments from the our friends regarding the Lettuce Wraps, Dai Due Breakfast, Pastrami Sammy and the Tamales which were excellent and different since I snagged a bite to try myself.  We enjoyed our several mimosa's, wines and beers outside on the patio.  Charlotte was helpful, informative and provided us with good service.  Not an unexpected $276.04 tab for 6 diners and one libation only friend.  I provided a $58 tip to the tab.  I did appreciate that there was no gratuity added, best way ever to have me only tip what you think you are worth.\\n\\nHere is the rub.  DD has great ambiance, solid service and new/different takes on traditional dishes.  Like the tamales I sampled.  However, if you cannot prepare a simple biscuit, like you had in the past, but charge a premium price for it...at least provide an alternative menu item or perhaps take one of the entree's off the bill entirely when you notice that the same entree was hardly touched and the other nibbled on.  Perhaps there was a sense that I wanted something for nothing by pointing out the fail towards the end of our meal? I don't know. Maybe I should of flagged down Charlotte earlier?  I would imagine that ordering 7 mimosa's and all the pastries as an prelude to our entree's, one might think that I was there to enjoy our day, our guests from Toronto/Georgia and not be minding my wallet.

See, if catfish isn't extremely fresh, it tastes really fishy really quickly.  Catfish Parlor and Quality Seafood succeed at having fresh catfish, so I was interested to see if ol' Jack could keep up with them.  Well, he could and did.  Loved the chipotle tartar sauce, too.  I was all over that stuff, and I felt like I got a lot of catfish for my green.

Because I am a bartender and I also frequent bars and I'm not an asshole, I asked for a hot water and whiskey (instead of a hot toddy because those are a pain to make when you're hustling). Our bartender, Gina (long white hair) was instantly put off and rude. I watched her pour an 8 oz glass nearly to the top with hot water and then walk over and pour a 2 second pour of Jameson into the water. It tasted like water and the whiskey was undetectable. In an 8 ounce mug you should be able to taste a shot of whiskey. I had everyone at the table try it and they agreed I should say something. I went back up and asked her how much they pour for a typical shot- she said \\"uh one and a half ounces\\" and I said \\"I'm really sorry but this honestly is just water. Can you taste it?\\" She literally said \\"I'm not tasting your drink. that's the drink you ordered, what do you want me to do about it? You can pay for another shot or deal with it. I didn't make you order that drink.\\" And then walked away and ignored me. \\n\\nMy friend later walked up and just ordered me a shot of Jameson (which looked like a proper 1.5 ounce pour), and when she closed out, Gina tried to charge her for a double shot of Jameson. My friend said something about it and Gina said, \\"I'm sure you ordered a double\\" and my friend was like \\"absolutely I did not please take one off my tab\\" and after being super huffy to my friend, she did. \\n\\nWhat is this Jameson conspiracy? Is she barely pouring them and trying to pull the wool over our eyes because she's drinking it herself? Is she charging double so she can put one on deck for herself? And hoping no one confronts her? And gaslighting them when they do? It's seriously so sketchy. \\n\\nI ALWAYS remake a drink for a customer if they're dissatisfied, I've never once told them to \\"deal with it\\". Even if they are rude to me- which I truly wasn't. \\n\\nWe all tipped well (because again, we all work in service in Portland and we don't want to bring that bad tip karma) and left after trivia but she honestly didn't earn it. \\n\\nHere's why it's such a bummer: we live down the street and we come in all the time. Every other bartender has always been warm and kind, most of them remember us and I order hot water and whiskey through most of the winter. It's always great and the other gal who works there (a little shorter, tattooed and sweet) always tells me it's no trouble if I want to get a hot toddy or a warm drink. I'm just so conditioned to being a good bar patron I don't want to put anyone through that. (It takes a good seven minutes to make a hot toddy at the bar I work at, the hot water is across the restaurant). \\n\\nI'm sure we'll come back but if Gina is there, we'll walk down the street to one of the other seven bars in St. John's.\\n\\nSeems like everyone else in the yelp comments pretty much agrees with her service style being awful and how rude she is- Dear leisure pub, I've been in the industry for ten years in Portland and I know a lot of talented, kind bartenders if you want to fire her and hire someone who won't negatively affect business, contact me."},{"name":"Sckavone's","address":"4100 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Sckavone's has amazing food.

You will find they have a medium sized stage and of course, some live music going. So that was a plus for me.

On my last visit, I brought a friend of mine, who had been there for drinks and good times before but never the food. He asked me what was good and I told him, \\"every pizza is great as well as the sandwiches. I personally enjoy the BLT, the club, and the potluck pork.\\" My friend...let's call him, Nick, went with the BLT+Avocado. Now, I didn't recommend he get avocado, but due to his heritage and overall love of the green fruit, he went for it, as \\"most things are better with avocado\\", according to him. We sat there chatting. I noticed, \\"Nick\\", anticipating this glorious sandwich, just slamming cold affordable beers getting hungry. BOOM! sandwich arrives and looks great. Perfect timing. Nice lil plate of food it seemed. My friend, a popular food blogger in his own right, loves the beauty of food and likes to examine it before he consumes it. He likes to understand what he's about to chomp into, as this he says, \\" it brings you closer to the soul of the food\\". Sooo, being the lover of food that he is,  he quickly opened up the sandwich to examine its contents only to discover doo doo brown colored avocado. Not acceptable. Why on earth would someone allow that to come out of their kitchen. It's absurd. It had us perplexed to say the least. Kelly, our waitress, who was beyond awesome, walked over to check up on us. \\"how is everything fellas?\\" she asks. \\"Really delightful\\", we all reply. But it wasn't all delightful, and she could tell. Her eyes glanced over to my friend with the dookie avocado, which she noticed was taken off of his sandwich laying lifeless and poopy on his plate. \\"Oh no\\", she gasped and walked over to the kitchen to inform the \\"chef\\" of his lil whoopsie. We sat there in anticipation of a reconciliation of sorts, but were instead met with a more senior waitress, with a very nice response to the situation. This waitress (let's just say she had blueish hair for the sake of really painting a picture here), told my buddy that the chef said, \\"that's how avocados are, its fine\\" And then the waitress recommended that my already sad friend, \\"google it\\". Awesome. OK, I'll google avocados, then I'll google poopy avocados and dingdong waitresses that tell their customers to google stuff.

The presentation was lackluster and bland. The atmosphere is pretty hip and I was expecting a bit more style to the food.\\n\\nI then ordered the smoked steelhead Benedict....much better. The server was very friendly, and gave me a discount for the inconvenience.

The unlimited rice with massive portions along with the drab interior felt familiar and comforting. So it's nothing to write home about and not fancy in the least bit. Its not even authentic Thai food and more like Chinese stir fry. But whatever it was, it was damn good and this place has a certain charm about it.

I went with her recommendation of the kimchi fried rice, or Dai Due Breakfast (made with oil instead of lard).

Seriously, I was mesmerized by the dance she was doing. Very impressive! \\n\\nThe food was presented beautifully, and let me tell you, for a meat centric place, this fried rice was DELICIOUS! It was super oily, but in such a good way. The kimchi was perfect, deliciously seasoned and the egg was jammy and delicious.

For starters, they sell their meat by the pound.

The brisket bedazzled me, so I asked for a thinner moist cut. My husband close the candied pork shoulder. They also feature some sides, such as a fabulous brisket chili (they only make this once a week, usually Saturdays), the ubiquitous mac n cheese, and housemade slaw.\\n\\nWe had a seat at one of the long benches and eagerly tucked into our dishes. That brisket wowed me with its authentic flavor and moistness, pairing beautifully with the bread. I took a bite of the candied pork, and savored the fresh taste of the pork with the candied crust. The brisket chili was flavorful and hearty, a must-try.\\n\\nOh, and on Saturdays they offer a cash discount. The only drawback to Wayne's is the limited hours; usually open for lunch only.

You also get a free dosai included which is like an Indian crepe.

They have Chinese specialties (as described on their menu) like batter fried cauliflower in a spicy tangy Manchurian sauce and chilli iddlies which are little rice like nuggets deep fried and then stif fried in the Manchurian sauce and these are just delicious.  They have an okra garlic curry dish which is awesome and so many other great options.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is banquet-esque which is fine. Service is always great and very friendly.

Although I won't often go to Hawkers it's a nice place to keep in the back of the mind. Yeah a lot of the dishes tend to be a little expensive for how much you get such as some of the noodle dishes or the barbecue pork, however there are a lot of good dishes for their price point like the Laksa which is decently sized at less than $10. I really like to go to Hawkers because of the variety of Southeast Asian cuisine that isn't Vietnamese. It's really hard to get southeast Asian food such as Malaysian or Singaporean dishes in Florida so that's often what I get when I go there. I wouldn't recommend some of the Chinese or Vietnamese dishes because that's their  specialty although they have it on the menu; definitely head to one of the more specialized restaurants if that's what you're into. It's a tapas restaurant so it's good to go with a lot of friends and to get multiple dishes. Often it's super busy so my device is make a reservation and take whatever seating you can get. Ultimately I think you'll find some items you love and some you absolutely hate so give it a chance and go with a big group. And definitely bring people that share (cause we all know that person that insists on eating their own food at a tapas restaurant)"},{"name":"Jack Allen's Kitchen Oak Hill","address":"7720 Hwy 71 W","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Jack Allen's Kitchen is a solid restaurant offering a variety of different farm to table dishes.

While the pie was good, I did not find it to be anything too special. The back patio on the other hand is a very nice atmosphere to enjoy a meal and the service is great. On a final note, they did offer me some free Pimento cheese dip which was very good, so their dinner menu might be better, but I found the dessert to be pretty good, but nothing over the top."},{"name":"Fat Daves","address":"1511 NE 99th St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Don't waste your money.

We got on the cruise and were directed to the first floor of the cruise, I thought at the time of purchase it said we could pick our own table but this was not the case, despite there being multiple windowside tables that were open, we were seated in the middle of the floor for no apparent reason. Then the waitress served drinks to the 2 tables next to us in a very timely manner, but it wasn't until 30 min after being seated that we were even offered drinks. Then it was finally time to eat, only one side of the buffet table had food out which made the line for first servings take 15+ min to get through, totally unnecessary, just have a double sided buffet table and you could cut the wait time in half. Then the waitress like kept forgetting to refill my water glass, there was literally a hair in the butter bowl on the buffet table too like.....ew. I feel like there were more things I didn't like but those are the main ones, do not take this cruise, I'm like so annoyed, what a waste of money."},{"name":"SPITZ","address":"2103 N Killingsworth St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Disappointed staff couldn't answer basic questions about where food is sourced from, would be nice to know the product you are selling"},{"name":"Joy Cafe","address":"1100 Peachtree St NE, Ste 110","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Where do I begin?\\n\\nJoy Cafe was amazing!

If you are local or from out of town, you're going to enjoy this outing. Nearby the convention center, is a mecca of sensory stimulations. Inside this colorful warehouse style building is elbow to elbow culinary delights. Amongst them are the throngs of appetites like yourself. From salty to sweets. Spicy to cool. They have it all. Most of these are boutique style food kiosks. Now you should know that many have also grown up into full size brick and mortar restaurants, based on the demand here for their food. \\nI'm going to be brief and direct you to my favorites. First get over to CaJohns Fire and Flavor for some sampling. This business is WORLD renowned for it's hot sauce. So much that they rarely enter contests, but judge them, so others have a chance to win. If you've ever had a celebrity hot sauce or restaurant chain specialty seasoning, it was probably created by Cajohns. Ask them about their deals. You know someone who would also love a bottle as a gift. While you're on the heat, go upstairs to Hot Chicken takeover for some delicious chicken and free iced tea. * Pro Tip- get the banana pudding.(you're welcome). Tell them if you are military, police, fire or first responder. Be sure to read their mission statement. It will make you feel warm inside before your first bite. Now head downstairs to Momo Ghar for some dumplings that made Guy Fieri of Food Network moan out loud. The Johl sauce is an amazing burst of flavors on your tongue that make you wonder how all food is not this good. How about some walk around sweet while you peruse the rest of the market? Get to Ohio's own Jeni's ice cream. Follow the smell of fresh made waffle cones. You are encouraged to sample all you want. No exaggeration! Some of the most unique flavors that the world is now trying to emulate. I was hooked about a decade ago on Cayene Chocolate. Yep. Try it. Riesling Pear, Frose, lavender, goat cheese, and so many more. The response I get when shipping these to friends and family out of state is so worth it. The price is daunting, so choose your scoops with the idea of how they will taste together on the same spoon. If you can all decide on the same one of your top 3 flavors, then I suggest sharing a pint to go. So much more for the price. Be sure to get your parking validated anywhere. Thank you for visiting Columbus. Let me know if this was useful."},{"name":"Zaxby's Chicken Fingers & Buffalo Wings","address":"4067 Millenia Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"They weren't kidding when they said (on a sign, at least) that Zaxby's might be addicting. Their chicken fingers taste amazing, and whatever seasoning they use is better than the secret spices of KFC. Ok, that's not necessarily that good of a compliment, is it? But seriously, the seasoning on their chicken fingers are good. And their fries are good, too! It's all good! Well, the wings are just okay, so I'm sticking to the chicken fingers plate. \\n\\nZaxby's is probably one of the better fast food places I've ever tried, the others being Five Guys and Chick-Fil-A. But it is still a fast food place, so don't get your hopes up ridiculously high then get mad that it's \\"just fast food\\". Duh. \\n\\nThe decor of Zaxby's is really quite home-y and better than most fast food places too. Their booths are comfortable, and the vintage decor makes it very interesting. I always find a new intriguing thing to inspect on the walls when I'm there. They can even help start a new conversation if you're into that sort of thing.\\n\\nSo if you're ever in the mood for an actually decent food quickly, and there happens to be a Zaxby's near you, I would suggest giving it a try. I'm sure glad I finally did!"},{"name":"Texas Chili Parlor","address":"1409 Lavaca St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Cute dive bar type eatery. Very inexpensive.

We all shared certain food and we were all paying with cards so on the back of the receipt I was writing down the cards numbers with the amounts and the waiter says that I was pretty much wasting my time because he was pretty sure that he could have figured it out. We explained that we shared dishes and I were just trying to make it easier for him. His response was \\"sorry I shouldn't have opened my big mouth because now she's mad at me\\". Not sure if he was being sarcastic or just trying to be funny. That was very unprofessional. \\nIt didn't sit well with me, stating that we've had such great service everywhere else in Portland so I approached the waiter privately and shared my concerns. Also the fact that he brought the check without even asking if we wanted dessert. In which we did. But didn't matter now. His response was \\"You are clearly upset about what I said earlier and now I'm offended that you are telling me how to do my job\\" I was only sharing my concerns but he took it a whole another level with his attitude. I kindly asked him to speak to his manager. His manager Bradford was very nice and understanding, he listened without interrupting and he offered to get me the dessert even though the kitchen was closed. By that point I was so bother and so were my friends that they didn't even want it. He even asked if he can give us a gift card to hopefully make things better but I mentioned we were leaving back home tomorrow. He apologized and gave me his card. 5 starts for the manager!

She asked us three times after we ordered our appetizers if we were ready to order despite our menus being wide open; once our food arrived she seemed very aggravated that we needed refills on drinks and a side of ranch; didn't even offer us a dessert menu which we had planned on ordering... and once we received said dessert, I saw her sneak her head around the corner to check to see if we were done less than 5 minutes after it had been out so she could bring us the bill.

The decor is old rustic wood with an eclectic array of furnishings, including an electric fireplace and outdoor street lamps (indoors).\\n\\nMy buddy and I arrived at about 11:30 and there was only a few diners present. We were greeted and seated immediately. The menu offers a decent array of food, including an array of starters,  BBQ favorites, mac-n-cheese and chili-spaghetti.\\n\\nMy buddy opted for the wings, I opted for the chili spaghetti... hoping that my current frame of reference (Skyline Chili) would see a substantial drop. The place appears to be run by three of four partners who are committed to their art. There no bubbly attitudes here, but a low-key desire do be good at what they do.\\n\\nWe were there for a Friday lunch. It wasn't busy but there was a slow stream of people coming in. The food arrived in good time. My buddy's wings were a surprise...  there where three large, whole wings... i.e. the drummie and flapper were still attached. They appeared to be smoked and weren't sauced, but he said they were good (oddly enough, on a return trip he ordered them again and got five dummies and flappers... which if you do the math, is not as good a deal as before).\\n\\nMy chili spaghetti was pretty darned good. No cinnamon, and a reasonably sized hearty meal. It wasn't lights-out better than Skyline, but it was better. They seem to promote their Brisket, so on my next visit I went that route. The brisket was delicious offering plenty of flavor and fatty goodness.\\n\\nThis place has a bit of an awkward feel to it, but the food is good and fairly priced.

I also ordered the sour cream pound cake French toast which sounded really good but it was not like French toast I was hoping for it was a pretty dry pound cake with no syrup. Which honestly was too dry for my liking to finish. Also I wanted to know about the restaurant and the possible manager or joy herself was being very nice and welcoming guests all around and going table to table to say Hi for some reason she did skip my table. Which also disappointed me because I had some questions but didn't wanna go out of my way to get them answered I sat waiting to receive a check for a while as well the whole experience took a while and I had to weigh on a Uber after asked them to drive around once more because it took so long to get my check back.

Prices run roughly $11-$13 for entrees and $5-$7 for apps. The menu was a little different, strange for us. They list Ramen by meats instead of broth base. Chicken, Pork, Beef, Miso, Seafood and Veggie instead of your classic Miso, Soy or Salt choices. We had to ask questions and yes, the Miso (which was very unclear) is made with pork broth, not just dashi. \\n\\nMiso is my go-to so we ordered that and it's spicy version along with a pork bun appetizer.

I'd rather try something else next time. \\n\\nHere's where we enter the Twilght Zone. My Miso broth was okay. I wouldn't put it at the top of my list but I certainty would not kick it to the curb. My companion's was simply the spicy version of mine but it had no flavor. It was almost as if all of the salty savory that Ramen has was telepathically removed. It was bland. Deeply bland, sorrowfully bland. The noodles were not really chewy and I guess that can be personal preference. I like chewy Ramen noodles and that's usually what I find in Ramen. Chewy and golden yellow tangy noodles right? These were pale and squishy. The Chashu was pretty good in mine. The texture was delightful and it had a good savory char to it. My companion's in the spicy miso was like the broth, bland. It was confusing.\\n\\nI really love Ramen.

So, anyway, I did finally make it to BSC. \\n\\nWhen I got there, I was told by my friends that there was a \\"little bit of wait\\". Which was OK. We were 7 of us, so, we knew that seating was going to be a challenge. After some 10 minutes or so, we were seated at this round table, which should theoritically only hold only 5 people.. Once we were squeezed in, the waitress came by to tell us that the coffee and juice was self serve.. Seriously, whats up with that??? I've never seen that before.. And, it was a challenge for me to get coffee, cos, I was jammed on the inside most corner of this small table with no way out.. Oh well, someone in our group took pity on me and got me some coffee.. \\n\\nAs we were going through the menu, we noticed a lot of \\"banana\\" items.. Interesting!! We got our food quite promptly. And everything looked really pretty, but, there was just \\"something\\" missing with all the dishes.. \\n\\nMy Dish - carmelized banana and walnuts belgian waffle with Whipped cream on the side and a size of home fries : I'll write about the homefries first. These were not breakfast potatoes.. This dish was grilled mashed potatoes with garlic and sour cream. I felt that it had too much garlic for my taste. It might have been OK for dinner, but was a bit much for breakfast. And, my waffle was very pretty topped with the carlemized banans and walnuts. Not bad at all.. I would order this again.. The whipped cream on the side was a bit over the top.. No one needs this much quantity!!\\n\\nJacuqelyn and Heather's dish - strawberry and banana french toast : Again a very pretty presentation. And the food was tasty too.. I tried a bunch from their plates and I would order this again too.. \\n\\nRina and Aftab's dish, Moroccan omlette -- Hmm.. Now this one is supposed to be a speacialty, but, we were very disappointed in this. We actually had to look for eggs in this dish. Looked like most if it was just veggies. Aftab also got their breakfast potatoes, which are like homefries every place else. They were pretty bland. I've had better at other places. \\n\\nJared's dish stuffed banana french toast : Also nice but, had too much cheese. He also ordered a side of maple syrup. It came in a nice little bottle that all of us shared.\\n\\nAnne's dish, Fruit Bowl : Now this was the prettiest of them all.. The fruits were nice and fresh. \\n\\nWe paid $10 each for all the food and drinks we had. Not bad.. Not bad.. By the time we were done, there was huge life forming outside the cafe, but we NEVER felt rushed by the waitress.. I like that a lot. And, as we were leaving the owner Mike, shook hands with all of us and thanked us for stopping by for breakfast. \\n\\nAll in all, not bad, definitely worth a second visit."},{"name":"Hai Ky","address":"3736 Bee Caves Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I've been looking for a good pho restaurant in this part of town ever since I moved here from North Austin (which has a glut of good cheap Vietnamese restaurants) and I think I found a pretty good one this evening in Hai Ky.  The pho broth was very tasty and I would rate it pretty high on my list of best in Austin.  Also, I was pretty impressed with the vermicelli with grilled chicken dish.  The juiciness of the chicken was almost on par with Pho Hoang's, which happens to be my favorite Vietnamese restaurant in Austin.  \\n\\nI would have rated Hai Ky a 5-star if it weren't for the price (which is quite a bit higher than most Pho restaurants that I frequent) and the relatively low choice in Pho-meat combinations.  There were on the order of 10 different pho dishes on the menu, none of which had more than 2 types of meat (i.e. steak, flank, brisket, tendon, tripe, etc).  I'm used to seeing more options, and I don't believe I saw tendon or tripe as one of them here.\\n\\nBut aside from these details, I was very happy with my meal and would recommend it to anyone looking for a solid Vietnamese restaurant in the Westlake area."},{"name":"Corner Cafe Newton","address":"321 Washington St","city":"Newton","stars":"3.5","text":"First off, let me say that this place sells a lot more than sandwiches, most importantly breakfast goods.

And now the rundown.\\n\\nLocation:  Miserable, unless you work in Newton Corner, and in fact, Newton Corner is mainly composed of offices.  Anyway it's not worth driving here and finding parking just to eat here.\\n\\nBreakfast:  I've never tried the breakfast items, but they look fine on paper.  They also sell baked goods and bagels. And the obligatory coffee.\\n\\nSandwiches:  They sell the standard gamut of American sandwiches, cold and hot, on bread & rolls (turkey, veggie,  BLT, veggie burger, griled cheese, etc).  They also sell a nice assortment of wraps, which come overstuffed and often dripping.  They're pretty good, though, and they have some good veggie options.  Expect many variations involving spinach, feta, red onion, and tomato, some with couscous or hummus (hence the Greek/Mediterranean).\\n\\nSalads:  Pretty average.   Often there is too much iceberg and not enough veggies, sub-average feta.  As an aside, I noticed that the Greek salad dressing (not homemade) contains MSG.  Hmm.\\n\\nSoups:  Very salty.  They do an avgolemono (lemon chicken soup) which is good.\\n\\nSides & drinks:  The usual pre-packaged and refrigerated suspects, at what seem like high prices.\\n\\nOther stuff:  They do a variety of hot meals that change day to day.

And if you have teenage boys in the house, these places are practically in the weekly rotation. In the past month, I've visited MOD locations in Happy Valley, Lake Oswego, Beaverton, and Camas. But really this review is about MOD vs. Pieology in nearby Tualatin [1]. \\n\\nSimilarities:\\nBoth are national chains.\\nBoth have a list of popular combinations or you can customize your own pizza.\\nBoth are choose as many toppings as you want for the same price.\\nBoth send you through an assembly line similar to Subway as you create your pizza (sauce, meat, veggies, etc.).\\nPrice point is similar.\\nExtra items (salads, sweets, and beverages) are minimal.\\nBoth interiors are modern and industrial.\\nBoth are packed with teenagers behind the counter and as customers.\\nBoth have a small selection of craft brews on tap.\\n\\nDifferences:\\nMOD has house made lemonade, ice tea, and MODshakes in addition to sodas (Coke products).\\nYou can order on-line at MOD, but this is not available at the Oregon locations of Pieology yet.\\nAt MOD, if you don't like it your custom pizza, you get a do-over free of charge (https://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/mod-pizza-lake-oswego?select=fqTpqO0Mi0S6TASG4lHMeQ).\\n\\nI personally can't discern a big difference in the pizzas. My youngest prefers Pieology (for some undetermined reason), I prefer MOD, and my oldest likes pizza with a thicker crust, so he's happier ordering from a more traditional pizza place like Bellagios or Pizza Schmizza. \\n\\nOf the four locations I've recently visited, the Lake Oswego MOD location is especially nice because of the open air seating when they open one wall for a shared patio with WOW Burger! next door. There is plenty of counter seating by the windows if you're dining alone as well. We did order the Cinnamon Strips for dessert once and they weren't great. I would give them a pass. Overall, when we are looking for quick-and-easy personal pizzas, I try to direct the family towards MOD based on the berry lemonade and balsamic fig glaze finishing sauce, which makes MOD my pizza place of choice for this style of pizza.\\n\\n[1]  It would include Pizzasmith in Bridgeport, but that restaurant already closed its doors."},{"name":"Banger's Sausage House & Beer Garden","address":"79 81 & 81.5 Rainey St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"It's a Beer Garden right in the middle of Rainey Street!

There aren't many places in town where you can dine on the banks of the Chattahoochee River.  Sure, there's Ray's, but Canoe is much nicer.  It's classier, more elegant dining, and the river and gardens outside really set it apart.  Whether you sit inside or out, the view is beautiful.  Needless to say, this is a great date or special occasion venue (or if you just want a nice brunch too).\\n\\nThe restaurant was flooded in September 2009 from torrential rainfall.  Since then, the restaurant has been completely gutted and renovated from the inside-out.  Markings on the brick wall inside show just how high the water level rose during the flood's peak.  The ceiling was designed to look like the inside of a canoe.  Interior seating near the windows, including oversized semicircular booths, all face the garden and river.  Seating on the patio outside is just as nice as it is inside.  Ceiling fans keep you cool.  On certain nights, there's live music on the patio.\\n\\nYou can take a leisurely stroll through the garden outside before or after your meal.  The garden has several wooden benches and chairs for you to relax and enjoy the scenery.  Hidden behind one of the outdoor private party tents is Canoe's herb and vegetable garden.  A lot of people don't know about this.  It has an outdoor fireplace and additional seating.  If you're facing the river from the restaurant, just follow the small path left.\\n\\nCanoe's menu changes four times a year.  Ingredients-wise, the produce is organic and grown locally (some on the aforementioned on-site garden) and the proteins are high quality.  They feature some small game.  It's quality over quantity here with about a half-dozen appetizers (around $10-15 each) and a dozen entrees (around $15 to $35 each).  All the menu items look great and there seems to be something for everyone.  However, If you still can't find anything you like, the chef may be able to cook something up on-the-fly to your liking.  Ask your server.\\n\\nI came here for a pleasant Sunday evening dinner and enjoyed the following:\\n\\nAppetizers:\\nMarinated Golden and Red Beet Salad with whipped Vermont's goat cheese, candied walnuts, and basil oil\\nBaby Arugula Salad with spiced nuts, shaved Parmesan, and poppy seed vinaigrette\\n\\nEntrees:\\nSlow Roasted Carolina Rabbit with Swiss Chard - bacon ravioli, sweet potato hash, and candied garlic sauce\\nSage Roasted Pheasant with brown butter whipped sweet potato, crispy pheasant croquette, and natural jus\\n\\nDessert:\\nChocolate Grotto with salted caramel and pretzel dust\\n\\nEverything was delicious and each of the dishes had splendid presentation.\\n\\nA selection of breads, hard and soft, was offered by our server.  The best one was a flatbread that was prepared with a pepper rub.  A little bit spicy.\\n\\nThe Beet Salad resembled tartare: a layer of chopped golden beets on top, red beets in the middle, and a base of goat cheese.  The candied walnuts were hidden inside the cheese adding additional texture and flavor.  This creation was topped with a sprout and the plate drizzled with natural beet juices and green basil oil.\\n\\nThe Arugula Salad was a good mix of greens, nuts, and cheese.  The arugula was used as the base with the cheese placed in the middle and topped with nuts, raisins, berries, and seeds.  The cheese's hard outer shell was left intact.  Soft middle.\\n\\nThe Carolina Rabbit was very good.  It's been on Canoe's menu for 14 years.  I was expecting a lot of bones, but the cut Canoe uses yields only one or two.  The rabbit meat came apart easily with fork and knife.  It somewhat resembled chicken, but leaner and a bit more \\"stringy.\\"  Good flavor.  I love leafy greens and the chard was magnificent.  The best part, though, was probably the pieces of bacon ravioli on the bottom.  They were amazing.  Canoe should make a side order just of the ravioli.\\n\\nThe Pheasant was nice because they prepared the bird in two ways: (1) white meat fillet pre-sliced on top of greens and sweet potato and (2) dark meat turned into croquettes.  The spherical croquettes had crispy layer on the outside that covered up steaming, shredded, tender pieces of pheasant on the inside.  It was good stuff.  Buttered sweet potato had pretty much been pureed to a super fine consistency.  Very smooth.\\n\\nThe Chocolate Grotto was named as such because a mound of chocolate encased melted caramel.  Once I broke open the hard chocolate shell, the salted caramel just came pouring out onto my plate like a small volcano had erupted.  The grotto was incredibly rich and tasted just as decadent as it looked.\\n\\nKevin T. was our server and he did a magnificent job.  He was polite, friendly, and knowledgeable about the menu.  He also offered to go out of his way to help us take photos in the garden afterwards.\\n\\nCanoe is located on Paces Ferry Road near the Lovett School and Tyler Perry's house.

The lobster bites were unseasoned caked-on batter who's only redeeming quality was the Thai chili sauce. The best dish was the bow tie pasta.

I love how large the outdoor seating area was and it was a perfect day to be outside. While I was there there were like 15 kids just running around, but the space was large enough for them to play without disturbing the diners. The menu didn't seem to have a large variety to me, so I ended up ordering the La Gringa Quesadilla and Totally Loaded Queso while my friend ordered the Power Bol and Elotes. The queso came out first and was perfect, I just wish I wasn't given a basket of only broken chips so I could scoop it up better. My quesadilla was also very good and the chicken was seasoned well. I think the chicken really made it stand out beyond your basic quesadilla and I even added my queso to it which only made it better. The elotes were on the cob and were delicious!

The reason I still felt compelled to write this was the empty stomach and hurt feelings I left with after Casa Mia. My mom and I went there before a show - it was a slow night - 4 tables of people. Offense number 1 was the bread situation (yes... I know this sounds ridiculous). All I wanted was some bread - the free kind that they bring to the table before your meal that every other table in the restaurant had! The 1st time I asked, bread didn't come. The 2nd time I asked, someone other than our waiter brought it. The 3rd time, it didn't come again. Finally when leaving the restaurant, I asked if I could take a slice myself from the basket by the counter because the pasta I ordered had left a bad taste in my mouth. It was at this time my mom overheard the waiter complain to the manager about how I had asked from bread 3 times. I assumed this was a joke, or an apology for never bringing it over... my mom assured me it wasn't. I'm sorry, I'm not overweight by any means, but I don't love being shamed behind my back for asking for bread that never comes. Hate to say it, but I also didn't love the food. We ordered a cheese plate and pasta bolognese. The cheese plate was nothing special - 3 pieces of cheese and three mini bowls of olives (that would have been more enjoyable had we been given... I know.... bread)! The bolognese was just not good. Very heavy and oily. This was, in fact, the only reason I asked for a slice of bread upon leaving - the pasta left a very bad taste in my mouth. I also had to cancel my second drink order because the wait was too long, despite there only being 4 other full tables at the time. The pluses? Pretty restaurant, very close to the local theater. The one drink I did get was great. Maybe they had an off night?

We ordered: the Lettuce wraps with bulgolgi, they were fresh and were just ok, the meat was sweeter than bulgolgi I have on a regular; Singapore Mei Fun was a good plate size and the eggs help most of the flavor whereas the rest of the plate tasted like just curry powder; Chicka-Rones my husband really liked these and the green sauce that comes with these to dip was great, sort of reminded me of a chimichurri with a slightly different kick; Curry Duck Noodles this plate was pretty tasteless other than the slight spice that co es from the curry otherwise the taste of it didn't really come through; Roti Canai this roti was good but I'm a sucker for anything bread like so we ordered two, the curry is pretty good and if I didn't have a favorite curry spot I could see myself coming back for the roti and curry dipping sauce; the vietnamese coffee was really great but on the sweeter side but I usually like bitter dark coffee, regardless I would order it again and everyone at the table enjoyed it. I finished off with the royal pairing bc the only dessert i can't say no too is creme brulee...I wish I said no to this $7 3-bite creme brulee. It comes in a cup with a very sweet compote on top. It's a bit excessive in my opinion, all you can taste is that sauce when you take a bite. I poured the sauce out to get a taste of the brulee and it was just as disappointing. There was zero crunch up top and it tasted bland, it just tasted like the milk it was made with.

I liked it. Liked the menu. Liked the building. Wait staff did nothing I found egregious. But the last few times I've been there, I've seen a trend of the service sliding downhill, the menu being cut and a general attitude of \\"you're lucky you're here\\". \\nThe last time I went there, there were five of us. Three of us wanted a particular dish no longer on the menu. Ok, we'll order something else. I ordered a burger, medium rare. When I got it, it was well done. OK, let me tell the waitress. Look around for her, nowhere to be seen. Looked for her for five minutes (not exaggerating, at this point I'm pissed and I'm timing it). NO waitresses anywhere near us, as it's lunch time and we're sitting in the bar area. Finally, I get up and walk to the other dining room to ASK if someone can please go find our waitress. So if you're paying attention, you realize that this means nobody circled back and asked us if everything was ok. So here comes the waitress, I show her the burger and instead of apologizing, instead of asking me if I want a replacement, or something else, or whatever, she just takes it and leaves. Says NOTHING. About ten minutes later she comes back with another burger and yes it was cooked correctly but of course by this time, everyone else is done eating and I'm trying to catch up. OK, finally we are all ready to go and we're looking for a check. But where is our waitress? NOWHERE TO BE SEEN. AGAIN. So yes, if you are STILL paying attention, you realize that this means that even on round two, she did not circle back to ask if everything was ok. \\nFinally, as another waitress (heretofore referred to as Waitress 2) asks if she can get us our check, waitress 1 comes running over, insisting she is on top of this, she's got it, no problem, blah blah blah. I'm watching this and thinking \\"oh yeah, you are ALL OVER IT. Where were you throughout this whole lunch?\\" \\nSo at the beginning of the lunch, we had told her that we wanted two checks, easy enough, one check for one side of the table, one check for the other side of the table.\\nOur waitress, who has just insisted she is ALL OVER IT, now comes back with ONE check. We remind her we wanted two, she apologizes, first apology in the middle of this whole ordeal, and comes back with two checks. At this point, we were all very anxious to leave and get out of there. But where is she? Nowhere to be seen. And by the way, when I say \\"nowhere to be seen\\", I mean that quite literally. She was NOT taking care of customers in the main dining area. No idea WHERE she was. Again, we wait patiently till enough is enough and go ask someone to find her so we can pay and leave.\\nShe comes back, I fold my check around my credit card, the other credit card and check go in the carrier without a fold, and we hand it to her. She comes back with the wrong charge on each card. Party 1 gets charged for party two and vice versa. \\nAt this point, we look at it and there is simultaneous eye rolling followed by a chorus of \\"you've got to be kidding me\\". At this point, we have our coats on, we've been there for two hours, we just wanted a quick lunch and this is like an episode of \\"Candid Camera\\". \\nSo I do what feels like an obvious thing to do. I have been watching Waitress 2 leaning against the bar for five minutes, watching TV so I say \\"Miss?\\" She doesn't move. I repeat \\"Miss?\\" a little louder. She STILL does not move and doesn't look in my direction. So I say it louder still: \\"Miss?\\" she looks over, and I say \\"Can you help me please?\\" and her response is \\"You don't have to SCREAM at me, I'm right here.\\"\\nWow.\\nAt this point, the whole table is outraged. And no, waitress two did NOT help. She went and got Waitress 1 who ASKED US TO EXPLAIN HOW SHE MESSED IT UP. She said \\"Oh, it would not have happened if you had kept the cards separate.\\" I said \\"I had my check folded around my card, how separate do you want it to be?\\"\\nThe whole thing was ridiculous. So ridiculous that I asked for the manager and recounted all the details to him, in front of both waitresses. His response was for me to email him when I got home. Why? No idea. Got a response from him that I should let him know when I am going back again and they will make sure I get good service. So I guess that is how it works here, guys.\\nIf you want good service, make sure you email the manager, tell him you are coming and ask him if he thinks you will be able to get good service when you go. \\nOr go, and take your chances."},{"name":"Serranos","address":"5030 Hwy 290 W","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"So i originally went to the location off I-35 and wasn't impressed and left an honest review.. so the owner of that location gave me a gift card to try Serranos again and see how I felt about it.

Also a great spot to go if you're hungry, as the sandwiches are huge!\\n\\nThe place isn't very big and remains busy, likely due to the popularity. The sandwiches are on fresh bread and use many fresh ingredients as well. The Italian sausage and peppers sandwich is one of the best ones on the menu. Sweet, Italian sausage, fresh peppers and spinach. It's a broad mix of many different flavors. \\n\\nIf I had to find criticism, it would be the service. It's kind of slow, not overly friendly, and sometimes areas are dirty due to the length of time it takes to clean up the counter and tables. Also, the hours are unreliable, as the store will close as soon as they run out of bread. However, it's pretty much par for the course for a sandwich counter shop.

The grits were good but nothing special either. \\n\\nHowever, this restaurant gets all of its stars from the grilled muffins alone. These were some of the best muffins I have ever had. My mom had the cranberry and I had the lemon poppyseed. The outside and edges were perfectly buttery and golden brown.

I'm a fan of this chain and they've only improved since opening their original location in Brookwood Hills in October 2014. This location on Ponce De Leon Ave NE is the company's second location. It opened in July 2016 across from Dugan's and Hotel Clermont. I like gusto! because their food is healthy, delicious, and affordable, it's served quick, and service is typically good with a friendly staff. We need more restaurants like this.\\n\\nThis gusto! is in its own freestanding building. It replaced a location of The Real Chow Baby (https://www.yelp.com/biz/the-real-chow-baby-atlanta-3). There's adequate free parking in the back and on the sides of the building, reserved for customers only.\\n\\nThe space looks great. They've really opened up and modernized the place. There's plenty of seating inside and lots of patio seating outside. Inside and out, there's a mixture of regular tables and long bar-height tables. The inside has a snazzy buttoned banquette and the outside tables have umbrellas. The restaurant has a fun feel to it with bright colors (white and yellow) and colorful artwork and graphics. There's an open kitchen and the patio is string-lit.\\n\\nThis is a fast-casual restaurant where you order and pay upfront. Everything is made-to-order in seconds and you pick up your order when checking out. The menu is simple. You choose a base (rice, greens, or half and half), protein (grilled chicken $9.15, spicy grilled chicken $9.15, grilled shrimp $11.95, grilled portabella $9.95), and \\"gusto\\" or flavor/ingredient combination that the restaurant has designed. Your gusto can be served in a bowl (common) or as a wrap (flatbread wrap). Across all the locations I've tried so far, I've yet to come across a gusto I didn't like. Each gusto comes with a bag of housemade sweet potato chips. They have a kids menu too.\\n\\nAt this location, I tried the Chipotle Mango Avocado with spicy grilled chicken ($9.15) and the Chile Sesame BBQ with spicy grilled chicken ($9.15); both with half and half brown rice and mixed greens. I also tried a High Road Craft sugar cookie and mango ice cream sandwich ($4.95). They have a self-serve freezer next to the register with assorted pops from King of Pops and ice cream sandwiches from High Road Craft (two flavors available during my visit: chocolate and mango). Everything was fantastic.\\n\\nThe Chipotle Mango Avocado came with avocado, mango, black bean, and corn salad tossed in a cilantro lime vinaigrette, topped with jack cheese, and served with smoky chipotle pepper cream sauce on the side. The Chile Sesame BBQ came with radish, cucumber, carrot, and jalapeno salad tossed in a sesame citrus vinaigrette, topped with cilantro, and served with spicy Korean chile BBQ sauce on the side. The bowls both looked and tasted fantastic. Very colorful and appetizing presentation with fresh and flavorful ingredients. The flavor combinations worked (they were quite tasty) and the bowls were filling and satisfying.\\n\\nThe sweet potato chips are cooked in-house. They were good. Crispy, yummy, and not overly greasy. I noticed they serve the housemade chips at this location and the original location on Peachtree. However, the smaller West Midtown location serves gusto-brand sweet potato chips that look like they were made and packaged at an off-site facility. You get the fresher ones here.\\n\\nThe High Road Craft ice cream sandwich was outstanding. If you want to treat yourself, it's worth it. The dessert was better than I expected and one of the best ice cream sandwiches I've had to date. Generous portion size and excellent quality. So good.\\n\\nDaniel at the register was very hospitable. gusto! uses the Square POS system so receipts are conveniently and automatically emailed to you once you're set up.\\n\\nI probably won't come back to this gusto! much because the West Midtown location is right around the corner from me. However, if I lived in the immediate area, I'd most likely be a regular.

So, let's just say things didn't start out too well and I was quite irritable by this time.

It's also rare to find a place in Florida that serves Malaysian food. We went with Roti Canai, Mee Goreng and Char Kway Teow. Roti Canai is a Malaysian favorite of Indonesian-style pita bread (roti) and curry. The curry was really flavorful but the roti seemed a little too thin. The Mee Goreng and Char Kway Teow are traditional Malaysian stir-fried noodle dishes which were okay, but under-seasoned so it was slightly disappointing.\\n\\nMy friends and I ordered a couple other things -- Cantonese Beef Stew and Siu Yok (Crispy Roast Pork). The Siu Yok was, by far, my favorite of all the dishes I tried. It was like bacon on steroids. SO GOOD. We finished off the meal with Mango Sticky Rice which was a great way to end the meal. It wasn't too sweet and the Mango sherbet was a refreshing palette cleanser.\\n\\nOverall, the food is pretty good and the service was great. The food came out really quickly.

The chicken was a bit dry, did not have much smoke flavour at all. The slaw was rather bland and simply added a little bit of moisture.

They seem to know this and provide extra bottles of the sauce on the edge of the truck for those that need to add more than they provide. \\n\\nI'm a BBQ purist. I like my BBQ to not need sauce, and then just have sauce as an extra hint of spice and flavour to taste. But this version required the sauce, and in fact relied on it to carry the sandwich.

But it's made more vibrant by colorful red, blue and green checked tablecloths.  Even though a waitress comes to the table to take your order it's really super casual.  Food appears quickly, but it's served on paper plates with low end plastic utensils.  Really?  The utensils, especially, are in need of a serious upgrade.  I've used much better so I know they're out there.  Water was served in a Styrofoam cup but soda comes in a plastic souvenir cup that you're supposed to keep.  Goodness knows I don't need another plastic drink cup at home and I'm not sure what happens to it if you don't take it with you.  Hopefully not trashed.  \\n\\nThe menu is a tad beyond fast food.  There are starters like fried okra, fried pickle spears and fried green tomatoes.  Your only decision is white meat or dark, two pieces or three.  A two piece dark (leg, thigh) sets you back $7.63, a three piece $9.73.  A two piece white platter is $8.95, a three piece is $12.25.  You can also order half a chicken, one piece of each, for $13.95.  Plates come with baked beans and cole slaw, unless you substitute one of the other sides like potato salad, greens, okra, mac & cheese or fries.    \\n\\nIf you're worried the chicken will be too spicy, it's not, although their mix puts a very dark fry on the chicken.  My cold baked beans were a huge disappointment.  I expected something warm but these tasted like they came right out of a can.  \\n\\nGus's is good and worth checking out, but not so good I'd go out of my way to visit."},{"name":"The Rise Eatery","address":"3121 Granville Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"A 2/5 star experience.

I consulted with my partner and we were hungry and agreed that anything was good.\\nBut not so fast. In the 5 seconds that we took to decide on these seats, 2 other patrons approached the podium and the host withdrew his offer of bar seats to us, saying that those 2 men had been waiting for the bar and we would have to wait longer for our seats. \\nMy partner protested that he had offered the seats and then retracted.\\nThe host repeated that we were late and those men were waiting for a table so we'd have to wait a little longer.  \\nBoth of us were so stunned by the bold rudeness of this person that we didn't even know what to say.

Shout out to our wonderful server Brandon, who made sure we were taken care of all night - you really made this a great experience for us! And also shout out the friendliest hostess in ATL, Jen! \\n\\nLocated in Old Fourth Ward on Edgewood Avenue, Staplehouse is making serious waves in the food world, and not just locally. As of February 2017, Atlanta Magazine is currently ranking it as the top restaurant in ATL, and Bon Appetit Magazine has given it #1 spot on The Hot 10 List (a ranking of the best new restaurants in America, found here: http://www.bonappetit.com/best-new-restaurants). \\n\\nReservations are obtained exclusively through Staplehouse's website and are released only once a month at 12pm. (The anxiety I felt when waiting for 11:59 to turn into 12:00 was palpable.) Reservations can be made for lunch or dinner in the main dining room or on the patio, which is heated during cold months. $20 per person is charged at time of booking; this amount is either applied to your bill or donated to The Giving Kitchen if you don't show up. (If you are going to dine here, please take the time to read up on the story of The Giving Kitchen. Staplehouse is the for-profit subsidiary of this charity.) \\n\\nWe ordered nearly the entire menu for the night, skipping only a salad dish and two pork items. All dishes are meant for sharing and are delivered to the table with a detailed description of the process behind them. It was a bit overwhelming and I did my best to recall everything (using my iPhone to take notes while we dined... so tacky), but knowing what I was consuming really heightened the experience for me. We had:\\n\\n- Chicken Liver Tart, Yuzu, Shallot, Corn Nuts ($11)\\nOur server let us know that this is always on the menu, and I would absolutely recommend it! The chicken livers were sourced locally from White Oak Pastures in Bluffton, GA. They were whipped into mousse served on a savory pie crust and topped with a thin layer of fermented honey-yuzu gel√©e, heirloom corn corn nuts, dehydrated shallots, and handpicked scarlet fennel. The flavors obviously were incredible but what I liked the most about this dish was the texture! The liver mousse was so light and fluffy. It could have been cheesecake! \\n\\n- Beef, Aji Dulce, Beets, Blood Orange, Garlic ($18)\\nThe beef was sourced from Bear Creek Farm in Leipers Fork, TN. A strip loin was aged for six weeks before being diced into a tartare tossed in scallop oil. (Scallop oil was a first for me but I was a fan!). Puffed wheatberries were added to the tartare for crunch, along with beets that were cooked, dehydrated, and tossed in a blood orange sauce. A sauce served alongside was made from fermented aji dulce pepper pur√©e blended with blood oranges. Blood orange \\"glass\\" and garlic puffs were served on top, and the whole plate was sprinkled with a pepper powder made from the dehydrated skin, stems, and seeds of the peppers. \\n\\n- Blue Crab, Parsnip, Almond, Ginger ($18)\\nFreshly sourced from Alabama, the lump crabmeat was served warm and tossed in a light sauce (a blend sunflower oil, homemade habanero vinegar, and extra vinegar to cut the spice). The almonds were coated with rice congee, nearly caramelizing them. Ginger root was juiced, pureed, fermented, whipped into a meringue, fried, and then at last dehydrated and cut into shards (which topped the crab). Alongside were small eggless custards made from parsnips, which were themselves topped with shaved fresh parsnips, drops of sunflower oil, and a foamed almond-infused milk. (We liked everything, but this was my boyfriend's favorite dish.)\\n\\n- Carrots, Aged Beef Fat, Sunflower, Radish ($16)\\nThe carrots were sourced from Hungry Hearts Farm here in Atlanta. The carrots were poached in their own juice before being grilled and then coated in emulsified carrot juice and sunflower oil. Along with salty toasted sunflower seeds, crispy sunflower seed bread and shaved radishes, the carrots were served surrounding an aged beef fat rendered into foam. (This was my favorite! The beef fat lightly coated the carrots and gave the dish juicy steak flavors.)\\n\\n- Grandma Lillian's Potato Bread ($5)\\nAnother nightly regular, this is the chef's 92-year-old grandmother's original recipe served with whipped olive oil and cocoa butter.\\n\\n- Sablefish, Sunchoke, Collards, Meyer Lemon ($34)\\nSablefish, sourced from Washington state, was poached in a brown butter-Meyer lemon-grapeseed emulsion and served with dehydrated crisped sunchoke skins and baby collards. The whole dish was topped with foam made from lemon and grapeseed. (If you get to try this, be sure to find all the extra sauce on the plate and generously spread it on your fish!!)\\n\\n- Toasted Milk, Vanilla, Hazelnut, Citrus ($8)\\nFor dessert, we had a toasted milk ice cream served over toasted powdered milk, vanilla cake, and caramelized hazelnuts, topped with oranges poached (with pith) in their own juice, raw Mandarins, and bronzed fennel."},{"name":"Canoe","address":"4199 Paces Ferry Rd SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"I had heard a lot of great things about this establishment but had never had the opportunity to go.

But sure enough, there are people in the back, and good luck getting a seat if you didn't have reservations. Luckily, there was room at the bar. \\n\\nI was little confused by the name for the prefixed menu. Supper club makes it sound like you have to have a membership, but this is not the case. It's $120, but it's totally worth it, especially considering you're sharing this among two or more people.\\n\\nChicken hearts (a la carte) - absolutely delicious. Some of the best I've ever had. Soft but still had a delightful chew. The fruity glaze caramelized on the grill for a lovely encasing. The Meat was not too gamey, but still had character. I love that they serve it as a single skewer for 5 buckaroos.\\n\\nThe duck egg on sourdough was good, although it wasn't something that blew me away. The mushrooms are the true spectacle of the meal. The duck eggs were cooked right, but they didn't have any pop factor to them. The fresh arugula was a nice touch among the other heavy items. The sourdough was a little too dense in my opinion, but it was still soft when the oils were soaked in.¬†\\n\\nThe mixed grill plate is a feast fit for a king. One giant ass bone-in pork chop, lamb coppa cut, beef rib, and a stuffed quail. It's hard to say where to start, but personally, eat the quail first, since it's easier to get cold once cut into. The pork chop is what lasts the longest temp wise, but make sure you grab some fatty pieces as soon as you can. Those parts are meat candy heaven. The whole pork chop itself truly blew me away. It was the one thing I least looked forward to, yet dreamed about the longest after. Make sure you take your knife and scrape what you can off the bone. The lamb coppa tasted like a clean, but very present goat cheese. I've never experienced something like that. It's almost as if I could taste that lambs diet. The bone is a little noting, but it's still damn good. The beef ribs aren't as magical as what you would find at a smokehouse, but they still bring the moans out of you. Plenty of greasy, beefy goodness, with a reasonable amount of pepper in the taste. The quail was the lightest of the bunch, as well as the least charred. But that doesn't mean it didnt have flavor. The quail was a lovely gamey bird, heightened by the gamey lamb sausages stuffed inside.¬†\\n\\nThe coffee/tea they provide after the meal was quite nice. The sumata tea was savory, like a chicken broth, but still had a refreshing herbal feel.¬†It was quite a thrill and surprise. \\n\\nThe dessert cheese hits the spot so well between being savory, yet activating the sweet receptors of the tongue. The rhubarb compote is small, so ration appropriately per bite. The crackers don't have much flavor, but I'm pretty sure that's the point.¬†\\n\\nThe basque cake is definitely my recommendation for dessert. Moist, buttery pound cake consistency with a lovely custard on the inside. The brown butter ice creams reinforces the buttery taste, as well as add the healthy dose of moisture.\\n\\nI was blown away by how awesome this place is. What a blessing that they offer such delicious grilled meats, appetizers, and dessert. If I lived here, I would definitely order from their butcher counter.

From what I heard, the party the group had at this place on Friday night was fabulous - something that a lot of those hard to please people ever say - so when I had the opportunity to try it out I missed no chance and came immediately. Unfortunately I got everything here but \\"comfort and fun.\\" We came in and went straight to the bar. The bartender seemed very nice and friendly. It was after I got my absolutely delicious prickly pear mojito that everything went downhill. We had ordered the Carl Miller's Layered Chunky Queso with chicken substituted for pork. We waited and waited and waited and waited. I thought that they forgot about our food. In the meantime this lady who was also working behind the bar came up and just took my menu from front of me. Mind you, my menu was still open because I was talking to my fellow diners as to what I should order. I might have gotten to experience a bit more comfort and fun had that lady not ruined my entire afternoon. Fortunately another server (bartender?) came by and asked if we wanted anything else to drink when we told them that we were still waiting for our appetizer. He was very apologetic and really made up for the loss time by bringing out the food quickly. I was told by my fellow diners that the pork one is much better. The chicken was not shredded into an appropriate size to be part of a queso. It was too big to fit on those chips. The chip to dip ratio was way off. However, if you look at all the components of the dip separately they were all tasty individually. The chicken wasn't dry. The quoeso wasn't too congealed. The flavors were all there. No, I don't think this is a bad restaurant. Next time I will be getting something from the menu without make any alterations to the dish as I think it caused some undesired results. I think I just had a really bad experience at the bar. Maybe when these wounds from such subpar service have healed, perhaps then I'll give it another go.

My client is an advocate of supporting local businesses. I erroneously assumed that Java Cafe was a coffee bar, which is my fault for not researching, so upon meeting my client here at 4pm on a Monday I was surprised to find a small restaurant. There were not many people at the cafe so we sat at a booth and told the waiter that we did not intend to eat and that there was no need for him to wait on us.  I did however order a glass of water. After about 15 minutes the manager approached our booth and told us that we would need to leave so that \\"paying customers\\" could have our spot. I looked around the cafe and there was still only a handful of \\"paying customers\\". When the manager saw me look around he further explained that our booth has the  the only seat near an electrical outlet. My client and I wrapped up our business and I left a couple of bucks on the table for our waiter. As we left I profusely apologized on behalf of the cafe for the treatment we received; it was after all  my suggestion for us to meet here. I have never ever been asked to leave a restaurant or anywhere else for that matter! Apparently the manager on duty last Monday cares more about the bottom line than the experience of the patrons of his cafe.

The website said the delivery would take about 40-60 minutes. I am a big time guy, so I set an alarm for 50 minutes. After that time, the alarm went off. So I perched up next to my window and continued watching TV, sometimes watching TV by the reflection in the window. After 20 minutes of this, I went out for a cigarette (and watched TV through the same window). \\n\\nStill no pizza?\\n\\nSo I put on a movie. Somewhere during act 2 of a 128 minute long movie, I decided to call the store about my order. The Manager on the phone claimed I did not have an order and then he accused me of lying! He must have been having a bad day, I said god bless and hung up. I don't deserve to be spoken to like that, but I can't just deduct a star because he had a hard day. \\n\\nAct 2 finishes in the movie, it is now around 1130pm, nearly the next day. I started to hang my head in sorrow thinking I will never get my pizza. Then. I heard it. It was a dragon! The fiery breath from the beast roasted the air I breathed and warmed my face, readying my blood for battle. I swung hard at the creature and ripped it open! As the acid blood flowed from the monstrosity it burned my floor. It looked into my eyes and I saw the look of begging. It wanted to live. So I told it, looks like you owe me a security deposit and chopped it's head off, rendering the acid unhazardous. I cleaned up the mess. Then. I heard something new. a rapping on my apartment door! It was the driver! He didn't apologize for being late, he was smoking a cigarette when he got to my door and he smelled like marijuana. He handed me my wet pizza boxes. They were soaked. It was as if he put them in a shallow tray of water. I asked why they were so wet and he shrugged. I signed the receipt and left a tip (regardless of service, he is in a job that is actively working against him and a society that wants him to fail, become reliant on government programs, then shut down those avenues and leave him homeless). He turned and began walking away, but I could hear him mutter \\"Happy Halloween\\" on the way out.\\n\\nI shut my door and stared at the paused TV screen, holding my wet pizza. I tossed the pizza on the table and opened up the box. They had forgotten to add extra sauce to the pizza and when I asked for \\"onions\\" they took it seriously. Luckily I had extra sauce in my fridge. \\n\\nAs I went to eat my tasty 'Za, I looked at my calendar and saw the date was October 29th! The words of the driver came back to me like a ghost in the wind, \\"happy halloween.\\" I realized right then what had happened. I had been tricked for my treat!\\n\\nTo have such a cool October promotion where you scare your customers and give them a real-life haunted house experience? JEEZE! I got mad, I got sad, I got scared of cancer from the second hand smoke. It was the total package. And now I got to watch Act 3! The best act of any movie! With nice, wet, saucy, room temperature pizza. I couldn't have asked for a better Halloween.\\n\\nI love you, Dominos."},{"name":"PS-Asian Restaurant","address":"926 Montreal Rd, Ste 6","city":"Clarkston","stars":"4","text":"Small little hole in the wall,but let the outside fool you,if you're looking for great food and great value this place is it,one of my favorite restaurant compared to any high end restaurant,you can keep the nice white table with cool decor with average food,gave me the hole in the wall that kick my taste buds ass."},{"name":"Banger's Sausage House & Beer Garden","address":"79 81 & 81.5 Rainey St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"This is one of the coolest Sunday brunch spots in the city!

Just came back from Umi again because Tomo fell flat. Another great night (actually got same seats right in front of Ito-san again) with great food. I did try the green tea souffle this time, and like other posts have mentioned, the matcha flavor is much too subtle- I would have liked for more of that nice savory flavor. I'm glad I have a go to sushi place in Atlanta with a real omakase offering; thanks Ito-san.\\n\\nI don't always write reviews, but when I do...\\nIt's finally here, the sushi place that Atlanta's been missing. I've hit up all the supposedly good joints in Atlanta, i.e. Hayakawa, Hoki, Huku, Nakata, but none of them compare to Umi. Ito-san's sushi is actually on the level of the chefs in NYC and Japan. After eating at the best sushi restaurants in the world, I'll say that Umi is definitely the best sushi in Atlanta (I NEED TO TRY TOMO before this is final final). I HATE when I sit at the sushi bar, and the chef is boring, or they serve me many pieces of sushi at once...that's for plebs. \\n\\nWe got the Ito-kase, and decided to skip the hot dishes since we were just really craving sushi. The Ankimo was excellent (Hayakwa's still is the creamiest) in flavor. All the sushi was aged perfectly, and Ito-san even pointed out that he didn't like working with the current rice and decided to redo it (I think most chefs in Atlanta would just penny pinch and not care). He is very passionate about his food, and even helped design my favorite restaurant in NYC, Yakitori Torishin. I do prefer my rice to be a little more al dente and with more vinegar, but this was miles better than the usual in Atlanta. \\n\\nWe finished the meal with black sesame (FINALLY I found this in Atlanta) that was as good as the stuff from the Chinatown Ice Cream Factory in NYC and Rang Mang in Tokyo. I will definitely reserve a green tea souffle next time. The night ended with us and another patron taking shots with the Umi staff, on the house of course, and it was really the kind of experience you get at very good establishments. \\n\\nThe total bill for two filling (I eat more than most people) Ito-kase was $240, not bad at all. I'd rather pay more for this than a little less for much less quality AND care sushi. Ito-san is a really smart and focused chef. I've seen the other sushi chefs in Atlanta seem to not care (once again, I need to visit Tomo), but Ito-san is sure that every piece of sushi that passes through his hands is what how he wants to represent himself. \\n\\nOh, and to the people talking about sushi rolls and Rusan's... I hope these ellipses will be enough to convey my feelings.\\n\\nMy only other wish would be that Ito san brushes the soy sauce onto the sushi; it's his food, and I want to eat it the way he wants to craft it."},{"name":"By Design Pizza","address":"11800 NW Cedar Falls Dr, Ste 110","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"i went here with my family to get pizza and have a nice sitdown meal and the manager began harassing me and my mom because someone i was with tried to shoplift once, an event i was unaware of and didnt condone and when me and my mom politely tried to explain he was being rude and ruining a family meal he just got ruder and ruder. me and my mom are never coming back on top of this every other time ive been in this restaurant the employees are rude and will talk in the back ignoring me for up to 10 minutes or just give me tons of attitude while ordering. worst service pizza place i have EVER been to dont come here if u want to be comfortable in any way"},{"name":"Sub Zero Nitrogen Ice Cream","address":"5590 Roswell Rd, Ste 130 A","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Not only is the ice cream great, but the service is very friendly and the experience is good fun!

No long after she came and brought us to our table. She was good at giving us a rundown of the menu and the concept of each dish and the restaurant itself. She gave us a few minutes to decide on drinks and dishes to order. \\n\\nWe quickly went to their instagram page and searched up any picture worthy food to order and along with the recommendation of our server we decided on:\\n\\nRoutine (1/5 - $11): As interesting as ramen fries sound don't get! It was hard (the ramen fries) and the miso gravy cooled down quite quickly making this dish not tasty at all. This was a fusion fail. \\n\\nLo Hay Salad (2.5/5-$18): Our server gave us the story of this dish that when you mix (lo hay in canto) means good luck and by ordering this dish we'd bring luck to our table and the higher you go the more luck you'd get. The salad was severed on a plate which in my opinion is not the best choice since we'll be mixing. We still went for it and it kinda go messy. Taste-wise, it was borderline flat but comparing to the routine I was ok.\\n\\nSteak your claim (4/5-$35 upgrade to ribeye): This took a while to come. Our server did mention our table was small and she'd be serving us as it comes but maybe she meant when we finish each dish (?). Our first order of the steak came in a bit over medium (we weren't asked for the rarity) and they made us a new one. The second was a lovely medium rare and tasted marvelous with the fat in between the layers of juicy meat. The stir fry 'fries' was pretty good too. Don't be scared off by the guacamole-looking like sauce. It's supposed to be chimmichuri but... I guess this made it into fusion and it went well with the steak. \\n\\nDrinks:\\n\\nThe description may be a tad bit off. I had the geisha-rita and the berry n ice. Both were sweet and fruity just the way I like them. I can't comment on the other two drinks but heard it wasn't that good. Also if you're looking for a boozy drink they aren't. Barely felt anything after two drinks, maybe I should have rise it up to double shots each (it's an option- not too sure of the cost though).\\n\\n-Caesar\\n-Something ricky\\n-Geisha-Rita (Sake with lychee, lychee liquer and pockey stick)\\n-Berry n Ice (white rum and berry puree)\\n\\nSince they're new...

The exciting part of our orders were the fun and creative souvenir cups. We had the yak & yeti panda souvenir cup with frozen lemonade. And also the Buddha ceramic mug with margarita inside. After your meal they bring you a new Buddha mug inside a small box in a Disney bag. Other meals we ordered were the honey chicken, cheeseburger, and teriyaki chicken. The honey chicken was the best, right after the shrimp of course. It was cooked well and had the right amount of proportion to fill you up for lunch.\\nThe only reasons why it deserves 4 stars instead of 5 is because even though the waitress was nice, she was not the most helpful. When asking for a small birthday treat, she kind of just threw it on the table like if there was nothing special about it nor the fact that we were celebrating a child's birthday. Before that even happened, next to our table were 4 rude young men and women. One of the males was making inappropriate movements where it involved playing with his food.

If you're sitting towards the back of the patio, it's probably perfect, but when you're at the end of your table, you can't talk over them, so listening is the only way to wait out what for me was a minimum 2 hour experience (I ended up having a friend take care of my bill, as I had to leave, and in the past it's taken 30+ minutes to pay out when you're in a group.)

This year, we took it a step forward and went to Vancouver (flew to Seattle, drove to Vancouver, then drove back down to the Bay Area).  Well, we still wanted to have a nice dinner.

Because Thanksgiving in Canada is different than the US, of course this place was open on Thanksgiving day for the US.  \\n\\nThe parking lot was crowded, and the spots were tight, but luckily someone left and I was able to find a spot.  We walked in and were seated at one of the big round tables for only 4 of us.  Looks like my reputation preceded me.  But, even though it was Thanksgiving, we didn't go all out like we normally do.  We went with some dumplings in the form of Xiao Long Bao (Steamed Soup Dumplings) and Shen Jian Bao (Pan Fried Soup Dumplings), Stir-fried String Beans, Hot And Spicy Garlic Crab, Salt And Pepper Fish, and Yang Chow fried rice.  The Xiao Long Bao was good and BIG.  Not like the ones we get at Din Tai Fung.  It's hard to find places that serve Shen Jian Bao, but luckily they sold them here and they were really good.  The string beans were good, too, but we really got those to load up on veggies, so we don't carb load with the fried rice.  The last 2 are the seafood dishes and were our favorites.  I loved the Salt and Pepper fish, but I think some of the coating might have been part MSG.  Personally, I don't have a problem with MSG, so not a big deal.  The crab was my wife's favorite.

There is usually a short wait for a table if you get there at noon because downtown office workers love this place, but if you get there a bit earlier, no wait.

And the sauce was orange. It is described as 'pimento hollandaise' on the menu. It was orange and flavorless. Now let's get to the side of bacon. It was a plate with four pieces of oily fat on it for $5. I'm not kidding. I'm not exaggerating. It was a plate of hot, greasy slabs of peppered fat, nothing more. There was no meat on it at all.

I order take out pretty much every Friday as it's the end of the week and we are too tired to cook. Most of the time we order from Dino's. I used to like their food but lately it's been disappointing every time we order. Tonight was the last straw I'm afraid...I called to place my delivery order, asked if they had pastrami tonight (because the last 3 times we ordered pastrami they were out of it) the guy who answered the phone said \\"of course, we have pastrami every night\\".  I said \\"great!\\". I also ordered a steak tip salad and asked if they could put cheddar cheese on it (because I saw on the menu that they have at least 3 pizzas that have cheddar on them). I was told no, they don't have cheddar cheese in the restaurant, only mozzerella. I say ok, but I was thinking to myself if I had ordered one of those pizzas like the cheeseburger pizza or jalapeno popper pizza that I was thinking of ordering which says on the menu that it has cheddar cheese, and it showed up without cheddar cheese, I would have been upset. So the order comes, and the pastrami sandwich is actually roast beef! Did they think I wouldn't notice?!? And even if I could get over the lies that they are passing off roast beef as pastrami, and advertising items with a certain cheese that they don't even have in the restaurant...the food was just bad. Steak tips were not good and the salad was just a big heaping of iceburg lettuce with a tomato cut in half and a huge chunk of cucumber with a couple straggly carrot slices and one thin slice of green pepper. As tired as I am on Friday nights, I could have done better with what was in my fridge. I thought about calling to let the manager know, but when I logged onto yelp and saw all the reviews saying that the owner is a jerk and has repeatedly told customers he doesn't need their business, I decided to just write this review and let it be. Sorry Dino's, you've lost another customer.

The grilled mash was amazing - slightly browned mashed potatoes with some other seasoning (garlic and salt maybe?). The omelette was juicy and full of veggies, and we could only eat 1/3 of it before we were full :) The eggs benedict was cooked just right - yolk-y enough with the egg white firm enough to hold its shape. \\n\\nService was quick and friendly, and we are definitely coming back!

First, there is a mandatory/complimentary valet, but there is a significant wait time for the restaurant. The problem with this is, because they take your car, you can't sit in it while you wait to be seated. So everyone crams into the foyer and stares at each other while we wait. \\n\\nSecondly, I thought this was a steakhouse...it isn't. It's an American restaurant with steaks on the menu. There are only 3 steak options, ounces aren't listed, and they come with a side of a baked potato only. The majority of the restaurants menu is hamburgers, salads, and seafood. So I'm still confused why they call themselves a steakhouse. There is only 1 true appetizer on the menu and it's a $14 spinach artichoke dip. Salad's are also listed on the appetizer portion of the menu, which makes no sense because there's an entire salad category on the menu monopolizing a large portion of the menu. From people watching, most people ordered the spinach artichoke dip and a hamburger. -___- I could literally go to Five Guys if I want a hamburger, and it wont cost me $17.\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I both got the Hawaiian Rib-eye. I got the alotted side of baked potato, and he got a side of brocolli for $6. Which was literally 1 brocolli flourette with parmasean sprinkled on it...i literally can NOT. I ordered mine medium well, he ordered his medium.\\n\\nWell when the food arrived his plate with brocolli had my medium well steak, and my plate with the potato had his medium steak. No biggie, we do a sloppy steak switch and get steak juice all over the place but...whatever. While cutting into the meat, his steak was clearly a fatty piece. He had to cut around the steak significantly. We didn't complain about it though, because at this point we didn't expect the best. When I asked for a to-go box for the rest of my steak, our server noticed all the fat on his plate and actually comp'd his steak which was really nice. And that concluded the meal.\\n\\nHere's the weird thing about this restaurant, random servers just walk by and leisurely take things off of your table while they're walking. They don't speak to you, they don't ask if you're done, they don't ask if you want it...they literally just walk by and grab stuff. A different server actually grabbed my boyfriend card and our check and we had to tell our waitor who it was for him to run them down. It's ridiculous really, and really rude.\\n\\nAnyway...lastly...we go outside to get our car from car jail, and they don't have a designated valet stand. There are no heaters set up, and it was a long line of people waiting to flag down a valet attendent just to give them their ticket to get their car. We waited roughly 10 minutes with 2 other couples waiting for an attendent to just stop to get our ticket from us to go get our car. Then when the attendent brought the car, he drove it all the way up to lenox! Meanwhile, we're all waiting for our cars in the back of the restaurant. So my boyfriend and I had to walk from the back of the restaurant to the street to get our car...after just waiting 15 minutes in 30 degree weather for it.\\n\\nIn conclusion: This place prices, and advertises as a finer establishment, but it definately doesn't live up to that. I will never be back here. The steaks are laughable, it's a glorified burger and salad joint."},{"name":"WUBurger","address":"880 Main St","city":"Woburn","stars":"4","text":"I wouldn't waste my money or time ever again.

The cod piece sat atop of the potato salad which I thought was kind of odd. The fish was hot and the salad cold- or it WAS cold. The plate was hot too. Meh... They both tasted good though. \\n\\nDessert was an apple pastry which was hot and fresh out of the oven. It was delicious and surprisingly rich.

It was no longer the kale salad I loved, someone decided add crushed peanuts to the top and add a peanut based dressing.  I tasted it and was like, \\"This is not right.\\"  No lie, it was like eating a peanut butter sandwich with kale leaves on it.  The peanut flavor was too overwhelming for that salad.  My coworker ate her entree kale salad, but agreed that it was just too peanut buttery.  I asked for them to send me another kale side salad but one without the peanuts and i'll take a different dressing.  Unfortunately, I got another side kale salad with more peanuts and the dressing on the side.  LOL!  Some sort of miscommunication, I guess; but I didn't eat that one either.

We continued to apps which included the mussels, calamari, empanadas, fried lobster wontons and short ribs. They were all incredible! I specifically liked the short ribs, so tender and the sauce is perfect! We then had sampling's from menu items which included perfectly seared tuna, large stuffed shrimp, and the most tender steak I've had in a while.

Fist of all I want to say the baguettes are extremely hard, after eating half a sandwich the whole roof of my mouth was tore up!!! Also apparently if you come here around 7pm they are out of a good chunk of the stuff on their menu.\\n\\nMy husband and I came here on opening day around 1pm and it was crazy. We waited in line and about 5 minutes into waiting a guy comes on the loud speaker and says \\"please be patient with us we are all new here and are trying to work as fast as we can.\\" My husband and I decided to wait and come back when they weren't so busy. We came back Thursday night around 715pm. It was pretty dead. We ordered our sandwiches, just the #1 and grilled pork and shrimp salad rolls. We tried to order soup with a baguette but they were all out of all the soups. Then while waiting for our food we are siting on the side by the kitchen and one of the girl workers is making sandwiches with her long ass hair hanging down everywhere, no tie back no hair net. Then she comes over and says we don't have grilled shrimp do you want grilled chicken spring roll? I asked if I could get just grilled pork. She goes to the back then comes back and says we have no more grilled pork either. I was like fine just give me chicken. So she goes to the back and comes back like 10 seconds later with the pre packaged chicken salad rolls. I'm guessing they were just trying to get rid of what they had left before closing... We get our sandwiches and drive home (I live about 5 minutes away).  we get home I take out the sandwiches and the bags the sandwiches are in are all hella greasy. I've never had a greasy bag when ordering a Vietnamese sandwich before, ewww gross not a good sign. Then I take out the sandwich and there are no veggies inside just meat. I look around the bags and there are no veggies what so ever at all. SO I put everything back in the bag and drive back to the place. I go inside and stand at the counter where three workers just look at me but keep doing what they are doing. So I go up to the register and a guy walks up and I tell him what happened and he says did you check inside the sandwich bag? sometimes its in there...I was like duh I didn't just drive all the way home to come back with out checking everything...He ended up giving us an extra bag of veggies which I appreciated, I love the pickled veggies.  Overall this was probably one of the worse experience I have ever had ordering to go. If I ever get a craving for a Vietnamese sandwich I'll take the time to drive across town. The sandwiches were just ok. The salad rolls were good."},{"name":"Canoe","address":"4199 Paces Ferry Rd SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"Canoe, we miss you.

You can also customize your meal to be either a salad, brown rice bowl, half salad half rice bowl, or flatbread wrap. I usually get the half salad half rice. It doesn't look like that much food but its actually really filling. The dressing comes on the side so you are able to put as little or as much as you want.

Sat down in the communal table with 6 of our other friends. Service started off great with the waitress coming by every so often to take our orders. After we all ordered 70% of our food came. My friend's waited a really long time for all their food to come out. When we asked about it the waitress said it's coming soon and we saw the people seated next to us get the food we ordered (which they could've also ordered but our orders where taken much before theirs had). When it finally came there wasn't much of an apology. We added on orders early on waited another 30-45 mins to get it and again when we asked about the order they said it was coming. \\n\\nAs for the food..we ordered the same same but different (pad Thai). Somewhat regular in taste. Nothing special or spectacular. Kind of relate it to food court quality. We also got the kimchi fries with pork belly. This was underwhelming as well. We saw the reviews and this was reccomended but I guess it just wasn't for me. Lastly we got 2 baos. The YVR and the Bao Chika Bao Bao. I actually preferred the YVR one. It was fresh and delicious. The avocado was great with the tuna. Although I would've loved more fish.\\n\\nIn the end I probably won't be coming back here any time soon.

They tasted like the Americanized egg rolls I used to eat at school. Not bad, just not what I was expecting.\\n\\nMost of the hot pots are meant to be served individually, but if you order the combo, or fish, that can be shared. It also comes with 8 toppings. We ordered the combo and split it among two people. It was enough for us, but if you want more, you can add more toppings for $1.50 each. We chose the lemongrass (Tom Yum) broth to go with it, which was pretty good. \\n\\nThe seafood tasted ok. I wasn't expecting them to be fresh. We ordered ramen and udon. There was whole lot of ramen, not very much udon. The udon was a little too soft and continued to soften in the pot. The meat came out fully cooked, and because it's thinly sliced, it became more dry the longer it sat in the pot. We ordered corn and got onions instead. Maybe they were out? I wasn't mad, but it would've been nice of them to tell us instead of keeping quiet and hoping we wouldn't notice. It wasn't the missing corn that was upsetting as much as them not saying there's a change in our order. We were also the only people in there having dinner at 6pm...

Horrible food.  The first time we ate there, the food was nothing but fried crap overcooked in lard and grease masquerading as authentic South American cuisine.  Disgusting.  Wanting to give it a second chance,  my wife ordered a $3 plate and they seemed offended she didn't want to buy more food.  My wife had no cash, and they refused to run the transaction because it was less than $10.  They told her to go get cash, so she went to the A La Carts ATM, spent $4 just to get a $20 bill to buy her $3 plate.  Guess what?  They don't like $20 bills!  No soup for you!  These people are a-holes, and seem to want to make it as hard as they possibly can for anyone to buy food.  Never again.  There is more authentic, superior quality Latin American cuisine in this town than you can shake a $20 bill at.  No need to waste your time on these jerks.\\n\\nHere is my response to the owner's comments below:\\n\\nPerhaps you're right.  Maybe I was out of line in trying to dissuade customers from eating at your business.  I'm sorry.  It won't happen again.  You can probably tell from my review and my actions that I was extremely frustrated.  I thank you for your apologies, but what I am seeing in your additional comments is still a lot of excuses that don't add up.  If you knew you couldn't make change, why did you tell my wife to go get cash?  You knew the only nearby source of cash was the ATM.  And you knew, better than us certainly, that the machine only spits out $20 bills.  So...why would you further inconvenience us by telling us to do this?  Why?  I really, really do not understand.  The only logic I can fathom for doing this is wanting to make fools of us.  Yes, your logic is technically correct; lots of small businesses don't do small credit card transactions--but many more do, and every cart we have every patronized does.  You may want to consider your ability to meet your competition, if you are not able to provide a basic service that every other cart owner is able to provide.  Being able to make change and process some form of payment is something every business has to be able to do in order to survive; I honestly don't understand how you've made it this far if you cannot or will not do so.  If you really reach a point where you cannot make any kind of change or process any form of payment, the right thing to do is close your business until you can.  Furthermore, if your intentions had been good, you would have offered my wife her $3 meal for free after inconveniencing us and making us look like idiots.

I would say this is the most filling entree -- even though it barely filled the huge plate.\\n\\n* Chicken sausage: My least favorite but still good. I just thought the sausage had a bit of a sodium kick compared to the other dishes. The buckshorn was interesting as it added a semi bitter ish taste to the dish. Buckshorn is the green plant you see in my pic. \\n\\nThe drip coffee here was pretty good (as the coffee snob fiance of mine commented).\\n\\nParking is valet only unless you want to find street parking yourself... Though the valet guy did just park our car across the lot at the mom n pop garage looking building.\\n\\nAnd last but not least, I suppose if you went here for a bday or anniversary, they will give you a little notebook with the date you visited the restaurant. Just make sure you let them know the occasion.

I came here in May, and I'm sure that the menu should have changed since then (or not). It doesn't look as if this place has a changing /revolving menu. This place wasn't bad, but at the same time it's not everything. I think the most important thing that Canoe has going for them is the view. Sadly, when I went it was getting way too hot outside to properly enjoy it. I think if we decide to come back and enjoy the view it'll be the fall. Outside there's a patio and a bar that's situated right next to the river which is pretty nice so if you're looking to get a drink here it would be great.\\n\\nTo the food. We got a couple of appetizers (crab cake and charcuterie) and we all got our own entr√©es. Our entr√©es had flavor and the fish was cooked perfectly. I felt as if some of the entr√©es were a bit too small as in portion size, but at the same time it was well done when it was cooked.\\n\\nThe service was something that needs to be noted. Our server was pretty attentive and I don't recall if we ever had any issues. I don't think you'll have any issues in this department.\\n\\nParking is also something that needs to be noted. If you come and park by yourself, I don't think there will be any problems but the valet says that sometimes it's towed. (I don't think that will happen if it's during dinner time), but Canoe is a \\"valet\\" restaurant, meaning that there's no other parking other than valet.\\n\\nOverall, it was great. I wouldn't recommend sitting outside during the summer unless you have a shi* ton of mosquito spray and if you're not scared to sweat half your body weight. I'm thinking that this place will be extremely busy during the fall and spring time when the weather hits that perfect temperature... Then again, where is spring and fall nowadays? It just seems like an extended summer or extended winter.

A dear friend and I attended the show and believe it or not this was the only place before the show that had seating!  \\nThis place is seriously the generic standard Irish /Boston/ touristyyyyyyy pub that people from the Mid west default to in their brain when someone says Irish pub. Seriously. There are corny photos of prominent Irish figures in history everywhere.   Yes, the TVs are great and plentiful and the beer is cold so thats what really matters right?  The bathrooms ( at least the ladies room) was pretty clean, but this is a new place and that may change rapidly. \\nThe dark woods, dim lights and crazy huge metal door with a Guinness logo are definately things that grew on me while we were there. \\nI had the burger. Nothing fancy or specatcular but I would get it again. My friend had a classic chicken sandwich and we shared some damn good tater skins... not enough quantity there though.  \\nAfter the best show I have seen in my life (aka Paul Mcartney) we returned to the Lansdowne to hear a Beatles cover band and it was really great!

After my husband finished his first beer he told her that he'd wait to order another because he wasn't ready yet.  She brought him out another beer anyway (same one he ordered)... Not a huge deal, she just wasn't listening or writing anything down.\\n\\nThe food was okay.  We wanted to get fried pickles but they were out of pickles (how does that even happen?).  So we got nachos and pizza instead, which were okay.  Again, the food wasn't amazing, and I think they were trying a bit too hard to be fancy when they should probably just stick to more traditionally styled bar food.\\n\\nIt was fairly difficult to park there since they were so busy, and most of us ended up parking near the mattress store, or elsewhere.

Waitress served the table next to us first, even though we were seating much earlier.    We told her that was fine, but we did have to be at a production at 8pm, and so if we seemed a bit rushed, that was the reason why  (It was 7:10pm at the time).   From that point on, it seemed she went in slow motion.  Drinks were delayed.  Food was late getting to the table.  We asked for the check when the food arrived so we could begin the process paying.   Ten minutes later, as I was taking the last bite of my poor tasting burger, she walked by and asked \\"seperate checks?\\".  I stated, \\"No, all together please.\\"   She brought us separate checks.  Then stated it might be quicker to pay at the register up front than to have her do it.  It wasn't quicker.  We walked out of there at 7:58, after a slight berating from the gentleman at the register for being poor tippers.   I guess he doesn't understand the concept of the tip and its relation to the rudeness/ineptness of the server.   \\n\\nAnd it would have been ok if the food and drinks were good.

The check had everything on it--including the bacon I never received. We asked if we could have it taken off, and when the bill came back it still wasn't right but we decided to just pay so we could get out of there.

You couldn't serve it, you could barely get it onto your plate to eat and it was just not what you expect for a mac'n'cheese casserole.

It featured cotija cheese with pickled watermelon rind, brie with truffle honey and Great Hills bleu cheese with pickled onions. The cheeses were all very good.

They told him the table would seat 18, so that was fine.\\nWe arrived on time and there were about five girls standing at the front desk shifting around and avoiding eye contact with us. We found the hostess, who asked whether we had a regular table and I said no, we had a reservation for 8pm for a hibachi table, it was very specific. She pointed to my roommate, who had gotten there early to wait for everyone, and said \\"she said it was a regular table\\". I said \\"We have had a reservation under Brian for 16 for a hibachi table\\"- my roommate was not involved in preps, so she had nothing to do with it?? The hostess told us it would be 10-15 minutes and would we like to wait in the bar area, so we said okay and went downstairs. After a few minutes, the rest of our group showed up, sans two who had to get plowed out of their driveway because of the snow earlier. We sat in the bar drinking for a good half hour, frequently checking in with the hostess, who said she'd come find us when the table was ready. Around 8:45, we checked in again and the hostess said we weren't being seated because our last two had not shown up. When they did, the reason was that the previous diners were still sipping their drinks at our table. Finally, just before 9, we went upstairs to gather around the hostess desk and put the pressure on. First she said 10-15 minutes, then she was blaming it on our two friends not being there, THEN it became the previous diners. Okay, so you gave our table away like right before 8pm, stop lying to us/blaming our two friends. It was an hour after our res and people were starving. I was pissed and stressed as if I'd been in rush hour traffic on 93 for two hours.\\nWhen we FINALLY sat down (with only 12 people- 4 cancelled d/t weather last minute), we were asked to squeeze in two more chairs on the corners because they were stuffing in another group on the other side of the table. When the waiter took our drink orders, it was a good 15+ min before drinks came out. All food and drinks that were brought out were served to the wrong people, and the waiter who took the order didn't even bother to look at his own notes, just asked us where the plate went. All plates were handed to us, even if there was already a plate in front of the diner and nowhere to put it. No one was assisted in any way- they didn't remove the original plate or make room, it was just fend for yourself. Some people just put their large appetizer plate on top of their large hibachi plate because there was nowhere to move anything. The group next to us looked as if they'd been waiting just as long (I saw them at a bar upstairs when we first walked in) and had a 10 year old boy who was literally banging his head on the table with exasperation, which was pretty representative how we all felt. What kind of a Mickey Mouse operation is this? Get your act together Osaka. It was laughably ridiculous.\\nThank goodness for the entertaining chef and the free sake that they squirt in your mouths, but when you set up something fun and are responsible about coordinating preparations with the restaurant, you should not be starving and having heart palpitations at the table over an hour after your res. I associate this place with so much grief that I wouldn't go back unless they sent me a gift cert. Food wasn't bad, but besides the awesome chef, experience was god awful.\\n\\nPS, we asked for the manager several times and were ignored, but then saw him frequently hanging around the area while seated, so its not like he was not nearby and couldn't speak to us."},{"name":"Fresa's - South 1st","address":"1703 S 1st St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Picture this...\\nMy husband: we'd like to share the #4 8 piece, the sweet potatoes and the grilled cauliflower.\\n\\nServer scanning her handheld with her eyes and finger: wait, the what?\\n\\nUs: the Shrimp \\n\\nServer: ok got it.

I got the tempeh meatballs with cauliflower rice as I'm a big big lover of tempeh and it's kind of rare to find in dishes at this type of place. I like that there's a degree of customization for most of their dishes. I didn't read the menu as closely as I probably should have so I was a little lost when I went to order and the person working the register had to walk me through it, but I think for most of the protein mains there's both a sandwich and bowl available, and for the bowl you can either get cauliflower rice or noodles.\\nI believe it took almost 15 minutes for them to bring my food out, and I was getting kind of impatient... but then when it finally came the (very nice) man who brought it out apologized for the wait and offered me a refund or a free drink or pastry. Since I wasn't in any hurry, all was forgiven at that point. Still, it doesn't seem like they're particularly speedy in general, so it's probably best to avoid this if you're looking for a quick bite.\\nI really enjoyed my food! The tempeh meatballs had a really pleasant texture and I feel like they did a good job emulating actual meatballs without just serving up imitation meat (like beyond meat, etc... some people love it, but I find veggie stuff that actually tastes like veggie stuff to be much more interesting). And this was a really good cauliflower rice, I especially liked that they incorporate vegetables in the style of fried rice. The dish definitely could've used more sauce. Reading the other reviews I can see that some people find their food to be bland, and while I agree that it definitely doesn't have a \\"kick\\", I think it's just meant to be simple food that's easy to eat, and I found there was plenty of natural flavour to enjoy.\\nI ended up going with the free pastry, and got the magic bar. It's sort of like a brownie, although more savoury and less sweet than you'd expect from a brownie (not sure sure if that's a gf thing or not), and topped with pecan and coconut. I thought it was a delicious treat, and although it's obviously still a dessert it did have a wholesome feel which was enjoyable.\\nPrices are middle of the road. I think it's normal for prices on gf food to be a little higher, so knowing that I'd say this place checks out on the pricing, since these are the kind of prices I'd expect to see for this type of place serving \\"normal\\" food in downtown.

And a packet of super cheap \\"Greek\\" dressing and a plastic fork.  I've eaten way better at truck stops, for real.

Alas, this is not one of those really friendly \\"family\\" restaurants -- this is the kind where someone who looks like an older aunt of yours is surly and disapproving at you the whole time you're there.  I'm guessing the appeal is simply due to the lack of other quick restaurants in walking-distance of the office parks around here, but seriously, if you do a little looking around or walk a block or two, you can do much better.

There have been a few Asian restaurants that have lasted only a year or two after opening on Cleveland Circle so I was really rooting for it to be good. I decided to wait and not go immediately on opening night in the hopes that they would smooth out operations and train staff appropriately. \\n\\nA friend and I decided to try this place out on a Sunday night just a little before 6PM. The restaurant was at about 1/3 capacity and it looked fresh and clean as a new restaurant should and you can tell they tried to incorporate natural elements into the space. It also practically had that new car smell of freshly unwrapped leather. Keep in mind - the menu is huge. Seriously. We weren't in the mood for something heavy so we browsed through the novel of a menu and asked for two orders of the crab/pork soup dumplings. The server responded that they had sold out of the crab/pork soup dumplings and they only had pork soup dumplings available. It left me a little perplexed since they had a full dinner service ahead of them and they already ran out of a menu item? Hopefully they will get a better gauge of order demand for each of their menu items as time goes on. \\n\\nWhen our pork soup dumplings did arrive, they did not come with the soup spoons. We had to flag down a server for spoons and after he scurried into the kitchen, he came with two teaspoons stating that \\"these are the only ones we have\\". Before we even asked for soup spoons, we took a look around and saw that there were soup spoons being used by other guests in the restaurant. And so, when he stated that the teaspoons were the only ones they had, we gestured towards the other tables. Afterwards, he came back a minute later with the soup spoons that we requested. Again, hopefully there will be a clearer instructions going forward.\\n\\nAs for the pork soup dumplings, they were very good. The broth was rich and a decent amount was contained within the delicate dumpling skin. There was a pretty petite amount of meat on the inside, but it was still flavorful nonetheless. Their house version of the traditional black vinegar accompaniment was a good compliment to counter the richness of the dumpling.\\n\\nOverall, I would have given this place a 3-star rating. But since it's still the new kid on the block that's still getting used to its own operations, I can understand some of the kinks that need to be worked out. Also, I have yet to sample more of their menu items.

Some people here need to relax and not have the same expectations for all sushi restaurants. \\n\\nAs for the service I think you just have to have an understanding of them and it's run by Chinese people so don't have such high expectations. It's always busy in there and they have to do things quickly. Usually it's just the boss lady who takes the order and she may come off as rude because of her voice and how she is in general.

The upstairs area gives you a good view of dated, dirty rafters and a concrete floor that resembles a factory machine shop. They expect you to sit on plastic chairs that look like they were discarded from The Ohio State University in the late 70's. The tables aren't cleaned between patrons, making you eat your food on top of someone's garbage. I'm sure the vendors do their best to hide the bugs and insects. With everything being so dated and disheveled, I can't help but think about an infestation lurking somewhere. Another concern I can imagine, looking at the way dinners and pedestrians roam, sit, dine, sneeze and the occasional exuberant youth thinking it's funny to share body fluid (spittle) with some unsuspecting adult.

We ordered a sweet and sour pork on rice ($11) and house special chow mein ($14.25). Both dishes came with a drink of our choice.\\n\\nI was a little disappointed at the sweet and sour pork on rice for a couple reasons. First, the pieces of meat were very hard to chew. Second, I thought the sauce was too sour, the chef probably didn't get the measurement quite right this time. Third, the portion was a little small, although I will give them two thumbs up on the amount of sweet and sour pork in the rice. However, as mentioned above, it was too sour to eat on its own. I had to eat them with the rice to balance out the overall sourness. I enjoyed the house special chow mein much more than the rice. The dried noodles added an extra crunch and tasted great with the sauce. There were quite a bit of ingredients in there: prawns, scallops, BBQ pork, mushrooms, chicken pieces, squid, and vegetables.

The place was always packed and it was always delicious every time I dined there; however everything must be bought a la carte.  While in Atlanta it's all you can eat for one low price of 18.95 which is a bargain.  \\n\\nI gathered up a couple of girlfriends and we gorged ourselves silly on a weekday night.  Little Sheep is famous for its hot pot broth which comes in two flavors:  nutritional which includes medicinal Chinese herbs and spicy with  Szechuan  peppers.  The best part is that you can get both served in a pot split down the middle; however, the group definitely preferred the spicy broth.  \\n\\nFor the most part, ingredients were fresh, but was really disappointed in the soup dumplings served.  They came four to a metal steam container and the bottom of the dumplings were stuck to the tray, so all of the minuscule soup in the dumplings were lost as we tried to pry the dumplings from the bottom; however the mini leek pies were good, but very tiny.  My advice:  just stick to hot pot!\\n\\nIngredients we ordered include:\\n\\n- glass noodles\\n- seaweed\\n- soft tofu\\n- dumplings\\n- watercress (which wasn't too fresh)\\n- lamb\\n- beef\\n- hand-made noodles (not too good)\\n- sugar pea shoots\\n- napa cabbage\\n- beef heart (for those that are adventurous, the heart is thinly sliced)\\n- bean sprouts (two versions)\\n\\nOne thing I wished Little Sheep had was more condiments like the other hot pot places in town where you can create your own dipping sauces to your taste and spice level.  Here, there's just three sauces, plus a hot sate sauce that must be requested. \\n\\nOverall, I felt the AYCE aspect of the Atlanta Little Sheep may have been its downfall.

Once we got in I was a little worried because other brunch places I've been too the places are usually packed at that time. It's a nice little place and I'll have to see if they have seating upstairs and outside once it's warmer. I wanted to try the McDowell but that would be something I'd always try.

There were only a couple people there. \\n\\nIt's an open space with white walls, aluminum counters and table tops, distressed wood and, concrete floors. Upon entering you'll see posters of all of their different sauces. Since it was my first time the cashier gave me a rundown of the menu and how ordering worked. Basically you pick a sauce, a protein, and then a vehicle (salad, bowl, or wrap).\\n\\nI ended up choosing the sweet soy sriracha bowl with half mixed greens and half brown rice and the spicy grilled chicken as my protein. The bowl was very good. The grilled chicken was tender and juicy and the sauce was sweet and tangy. I was quite satisfied after finishing but not stuffed and ready to pass out. I'd get this again. The bowls/wraps come with sweet potato chips. I love sweet potatoes so this was a bonus for me and the chips were really good.\\n\\nAfter I checked out I noticed their white chocolate macadamia nut cookie and decided to get one. While I was waiting to pay the manager who knew it was my first time gave it to me on the house. A sweet way to end my meal:)\\n\\nThis was my first trip but it won't be my last.

There wasn't anything special about the wheat bread.  The meat and toppings were tasty, but the whole thing was kind of sloppily put together compared to the fast food sandwiches I've had at Potbelly's and Jersey Mike's.  Beyond the standard tomato and lettuce, the only thing that might make this different from the other sandwiches on the menu would be various combinations of meat.  The taste was pretty good, but, again...it's just a sandwich and difficult to screw up a sandwich unless you use less than premium meats and cheeses.  Their big selling point here is that the sandwiches come out hot.\\n\\nThere's a captive audience with this being right in the middle of at least one university and close to two others.  Ten minutes after we started eating, at least 30 college kids rushed into the restaurant and swarmed the place.

She referred to the table of 12 and explained that they just had a big order and said ours would \\"be right out\\" and that they had limited grill space.  We waited another 10 minutes and she came over again apologizing saying the owner is going to comp us one of the meals and then swore it would \\"be right out\\".  After another 10 minutes the owner came over and told us our meals were on him and once again an apology made because of how long we had been waiting.

Save for maybe a more upscale atmosphere, it boasts nothing that other sushi restaurants in Atlanta don't already have.  For the less adventurous eaters, the edamame, agedashi tofu, and shrimp tempura didn't reinvent the wheel, but they were executed like you would probably expect.   Our table of four people ordered about five different rolls, the 12-piece nigiri (chef's choice), and my brother-in-law and I tried the otoro caviar.  The nigiri plate was unspectacular, especially in comparison with, say, Sushi Hayakawa, and the rolls were on par with those you'd find at places like Sushi Itto or Sushi Matsuya.  The otoro caviar was nice, but it was overpowered by the truffle.  The food is about a 3 out of 5, the pricing a 2, the atmopshere a 3.5, the service a 3.5 (great server but slow delivery of dishes), and the drinks a 5.

I also got a glass of The Passion by Rev Nat's hard cider because I was craving something more tropical by the end of all the beer.. and that REALLY good. The bartender gave me a sample of the cider brewed at Deschutes before committing to a glass which was very generous! Somewhere throughout our time here the bartender gave each party by the bar a free sample of the fresh squeezed IPA too! I swear, the people here pride hard on their craft beer and food.

The grits were creamy and sublime, but I didn't altogether care for the flavor the BBQ sauce added, nor the extra oil. The shrimp were amazing, however I must say I wish she had stuck a little closer to traditional Shrimp n' grits by adding sausage and/or bacon.

One bite and instantly I was having buyers remorse. I could eat breakfast any time of day and these tacos would be something I would eat for daily for life if I could. Depending on your tastes, you may want to add a dash of salt n' pepper, but OMG these bad boys are so worth giving this place a visit.\\n\\nCRAB CAKES BENEDICT ( 4.5 stars) | $14\\nYou just can't go wrong with these. Thanks for sharing Tanya!\\n\\nHASH BROWNED POTATOES (4 stars) | Side\\nKristin called down from the other end of the table and said \\"Richard, do you have the potatoes. You must try them!\\" You don't have to ask me twice! I immediately passed down my plate for a small sample and they were indeed very good! Someday maybe we as a group will have a Breakfast Club potluck at my house. I really want others to taste my wife's breakfast potatoes.

The front of the house staff and wait staff were all very attentive and did a great job but that is where the good ends. The space is so dark and so loud it borders on ridiculous. Having a conversation at anything less than a yell is impossible. The music and the crowd noise make this a terrible spot for either a date or a business conversation. It would be horrible if you tried to come here for a romantic dinner or birthday celebration. Because it is so dark, you see a number of people using their cell phone flashlights to light the menu which was super annoying, especially when the light is flashing in your face. The crowd itself was varied from a couple clearly trying to have a nice dinner, such as I was, to business people to small groups just looking to be seen. \\n\\nThe food was absolutely just OK. I've been to countless Sushi/Omakase places across the country and it was unmemorable and frankly disappointing. The tuna tartare was a bit bland with way too much corn, the rolls weren't rolled tight and the taste/presentation no better than a local sushi place at 1/3 the cost. The sashimi was good but not great including the Toro, which rather than melt in your mouth, was a bit tough and not of the highest quality in my opinion. We had intended to order hot plates and desert but we were so turned off by the noise, the annoying douchey group next to us, the flashlights in the eyes and inability to enjoy a high-end meal with an actual conversation, that we rushed our meal and left.

I asked the gentleman if I could leave my vehicle there for five minutes while I dropped off the boxes and came right back out. Nope not allowed.

She even brought a couple of small plates for us to sample of potential menu items. \\n\\nAnother server, Junior, recognized us from having been in a few times before.

No ifs, ands or buts about it.  It's a hidden gem, truly hidden on the basement level slightly off of Harvard St.  I went here for my birthday dinner and was so impressed.  The atmosphere is very relaxing and quiet; it would be a great place to bring a date or a visiting foodie.  The only reason not to go here is if you are afraid to try new things, and that's a shame!  It is a place where you can find dishes you've never seen before and have a brand new experience.\\n\\nMy friends and I each ordered 3 small plates but we made sure to share bites.  I had a special of braised pork belly in a dark soy sauce (so tender), the avocado salad (almost like a really good California roll, minus the rice), and the naruto maki (a roll of tuna, halibut, and salmon wrapped in cucumber with a vinegar sauce).  My sister had the seaweed salad, which I proclaim to be the best I've had.  One of my friends tried the regular sushi and was very pleased that her spicy tuna roll was actually spicy!\\n\\nI agree with many other reviewers saying that the food is light and might leave you a little hungry at the end.  Many people recommended ending your meal with the rice balls (or rice tacos, as we thought they looked like), and after that we were quite full.  All four of us were thrilled with our meal, and the best part is that the menu is so vast, that I can easily come back again (which I plan to do) and order completely different dishes."},{"name":"Gus's World Famous Fried Chicken","address":"5486 Peachtree Rd","city":"Chamblee","stars":"3.5","text":"I was looking forward to checking this place out so I decided to grab a to-go plate for a weekday lunch. \\n\\nOverall the prices of their meals are great, but I thought the chicken was your  average flavored crispy fried chicken. \\n\\nI ordered the two piece white plate which comes with a breast, wing, white bread and coleslaw and beans. For a small upcharge you can change your sides so I got the mac cheese and okra.\\n\\nWhen I arrived to pick up my order at the quoted time it was ready. The mac n cheese was NOT what I expected and had more of an processed cheese taste (pure Velvetta) with paprika spirkled and real shredded cheddar on top. Why the real cheese was not used to make this dish (because baked macaroni with real cheese is pretty epic) I do not know.....The okra was actually pretty good though. So that saved the sides. And, the wing..as others have said, they are SUPER small...like smaller than your palm. \\n\\nI wouldn't rush to go back or make a suggestion to others to come here for the food, but it wasn't the worst meal I have ever had either. Yea. Pretty average in my opinion."},{"name":"Burgerville","address":"15650 SW Upper Boones Ferry Rd","city":"Lake Oswego","stars":"3","text":"I heart Burgerville, but it has nothing to do with their burgers.

The menu on the wall differed from the paper menus at the cash (the papers depicted various salads, for example, that weren't mentioned on the main wall menu), so one is faced with more, unexpected options when one finally gets to the counter. And then there's the issue of them not having grilled chicken available any longer, only \\"crispy\\" (i.e., fried). This, at 12 noon, prime lunch time. How can they run out of grilled chicken at noon? Then there's the issue of half of their donut varieties not available. Just not there, in the display. Were they short on inventory that day or was there a mad rush on their advertised new \\"tiramisu donuts\\" that morning? \\n\\nThe lady who took my order wasn't that friendly.

Restaurant. Ever.\\n\\nGrowing up in California, I had a Veggie Grill ten minutes away from my house but somehow it took me seventeen years before I stepped foot in one. And thank god I did, because I was quickly going back every week - it singlehandedly became the restaurant that helped me show that eating plant-based foods was not only a viable lifestyle, but something that could taste so damn good at the same time.\\n\\nSo when I moved away to the Boston area for college in 2018, naturally, one of the first things I did was check for a Veggie Grill. I was disappointed to find that there weren't any East Coast locations open at the time, but after doing some digging, found that the first location was opening right here in Harvard Square!\\n\\nI was ecstatic to say the least. So you can imagine how high my expectations were going in before eating here my first time. And needless to say, it did not disappoint.\\n\\nBefore I get into the individual menu reviews on the food, some general words of advice for those new to Veggie Grill. I would strongly recommend starting with the \\"fan favorites\\" (they're starred on the menu) as those rarely disappoint. I feel as though the seasonal menu items can be a lot more hit or miss, despite how good some of them may sound on paper.\\n\\nSo without further adieu, these are my thoughts on the food.\\n\\n--Sandwiches--\\n\\nSanta Fe Crispy Chickin' - (10/10)\\nClassic sandwich - this has to be one of the all time great foods ever made to man. No exaggerations here. I've introduced my meat-eating friends to this sandwich and I've heard some people say it's better than Chik-fil-A. It's such a balanced sandwich, and I really enjoy it every time I have it. The seemingly simple combination of the chickin' patty, guac, onions/lettuce, and the whole wheat bun creates an experience far greater than the sum of its parts.\\n\\nBuffalo Bomber - (4/10)\\nOne of my favorites at other locations, so I was disappointed to find it lacking here. Bun wasn't toasted well and something about it tasted off.\\n\\nBeyond Burger 'Cheesesteak Sandwich' (seasonal item) - 6/10\\nNothing wrong with this one, but it's just lacking a bit of oomph in my opinion. The one I had was a little under-seasoned, but even after adding salt myself I wasn't the biggest fan of this sandwich. Perhaps it's because I've never loved cheesesteaks even when I was still eating meat.\\n\\n--Burgers--\\n\\nVG Beyond Burger - (6.5/10)\\nMy girlfriend got this one the second time we came here, and it was solid in my opinion. Tasted like a reasonably good burger, but nothing made it stand out from the fast food Beyond Burger's I've had (and this one's a bit more pricey) so that's why it gets this rating.\\n\\nIf you're craving a burger, I've had much better experiences with the Super Rica Burger (probably like a 8/10) and the LUXE burger (also an 8/10). I haven't had them at this location though, so I'll refrain from saying too much about them.\\n\\n--Bowls--\\n\\nFar East Bowl - (9.5/10)\\nOkay, I must admit I've always been wary of the bowls at Veggie Grill, so this was my first time trying one. And holy bleep it was good. This was a really balanced bowl, flavors were subtle but powerful, and meshed really well together. The mint in here is an absolute delight and the sauce too is really light/delicious. Would strongly recommend.\\n\\n--Sides--\\n\\nCrispy Cauliflower - (9.5/10)\\nSoooo good. Ask for both of the sauces, and you can switch between buffalo and orange 'chicken' sauce. Really pleasantly surprised me, not too heavy of an appetizer but also greasy enough to make you feel good about yourself :)\\n\\nFries - (5.5/10)\\nTo be totally honest, veggie grill fries have always been amongst my favorite fries at any restaurant that I've been to (I'm looking at you In-n-out). But the second time that I came to this location, I was pretty disappointed with the fries I received - they weren't as hot or as crispy as they should've been. I talked to the manager about it gave me a second batch. These were definitely much better (that's why I'm bumping these up to a 5.5) but still, something wasn't the same.\\n\\nSpicy Beef Barley Soup - (4/10)\\nI struggle to enjoy the soups at Veggie Grill. This one tasted overwhelmingly of tomato sauce, and felt like it lacked a lot of other necessary seasonings. I've also had the lentil soup at other locations and wasn't super impressed by them.\\n\\nAlright that's it for my food item reviews. Before I sign out, I have to give a shoutout to the Veggie Grill staff, they are super warm and friendly. JR is one of my favorite guys at Veggie Grill (I've known him from my old home location in California!!) and I was really glad to see a familiar face here.\\n\\nOkay folks, I know that was a bit long but hopefully that helped encourage you to come try out Veggie Grill and better navigate the menu. I can't stress to you enough how much I love this place and really encourage you (whether you're plant-based or not) to come and try out their food.

We made dinner reservation for 5:30. Me, who does not know how to show up late, always come too damn early. I was too early but went inside because it's May and it's still so damn cold. They were surprise that there was a reservation but I got seated anyway. \\n\\nI already had what I wanted to eat in my mind. At exactly 5:30 as planned only 3 more people showed up. Spanning from the time I was here 5:10 to the time the last person got here 6:15, I was very amaze they did not complain or give me angry eyes (like I've previous experience from so many restaurant). Bonus point for not being rude! Yes I should discipline my friends better to show up on time but I am not their mum. \\n\\nI got this time the Grilled pork + Fried Tofu + a side of Bi (pork skin basically): it was really good. I'm actually amazed at how delicious the Fried Tofu (Tau Hu Ky) is (of which I've had many). It was the thing I ate first and I was so full I barely touch my Bi (which is very sad). One of the better rice plates in Dorchy (IMO). \\n\\nFriends got a bunch of other stuff but w/e I was mad at them for coming late so idc they probably enjoyed their food though from a variety of pho to sizzling plates. \\n\\nI felt bad for the server as we were drinking our ice tea pot too damn quickly between the 13 of us. Our group kept on asking for refills to which they eventually gave up and brought us a giant pitcher of water. \\n\\nService this time was ok, since we had to track them down to get them to let us order.

Definitely a great and affordable deal. \\n\\nPreviously on \\"I EAT TOO DAMN MUCH\\":\\nBO 7 MON (7 Course Beef) and Ca 7 MON (7 Course FISH): Now I've had both on occasions and I would say the Beef course is slightly better. In term of flavor the beef dishes are more in-depth. Butter beef, Beef vinegar fondue, Beef wrapped in lot leaf, and Beef carpaccio salad   are consistently excellent. I've never made it to the rice porridge but it's always been a good take home for lunch the next day.

Always call ahead no matter where you go though, it take a long ass time to make and when you (aka me) travel all the way from Brookline to Dorchester just to eat this you want it to be freshly ready when you arrive. They give you a medium amount of veggies that you can always ask for more. The veggies amount isn't as generous as Pho 2000. Dipping sauce wise, Pho 2000 also have them beat.\\nBut I would say come to AH for your Beef Course. Of course. \\n\\nI would have tried many other things but honestly the 7 Course Beef is the best menu item so I never bothered to waste my calories on other things, but I've heard their Pho and stuff to be good. Mixed reviews on Bun Bo Hue. Banh Canh Cua is meh. \\n\\nBack to service, it's pretty up and down depend on the time you go and who's on. But I feel with Viet food the customer-base can be very needy with their constant requests\\"Hey can you get me this\\", \\"More of this please\\", \\"More.\\" \\"More\\" \\"More\\". So I can total understand when they forget to bring you what you ask for since they probably have like 8000 things on their mind to remember to bring. So be nice to your server and don't make a giant scene. Tip nicely. \\n\\nThe lady who makes the drink and take care of takeout order/ money is always very nice and pleasant though. \\n\\nI rank Anh Hong high on my list, especially higher than Pho Le (who've previously been very good but now isn't as good as when they first open) and Pho Hoa. Service wise also better than Saigon Seafood. In term of most likely to get a satisfying Vietnamese meal + no arguing with waiter for bad service, AH is a bar above the rest."},{"name":"Rustic Kitchen","address":"210 Stuart St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I am ambivalent about my experience here. I am sure it could be great.. but the night we went in something was just very off. We were a group of 3, with one more coming. It was a Thursday night, maybe around 7:30. We walked in, and were greeted with a very warm, beautiful scene. They have private alcoves of booths for those on a date, and a wide open fire where everything- even the pastas- are cooked. It is extremely inviting, upscale, and romantic. \\n\\nThere were about 3 tables full, and all others were empty. The hostess said that it was about a 20 minute wait due to reservations.... we were a tad confused since there were SO many tables open. As we waited, we noticed that many of the tables were dirty and had not been cleaned... maybe they were short staffed that night and the turnover was slow.. but she had told us our wait would be due to reservations, not dirty tables. We asked her if we could have a spot close to the fire (there were about 5 tables open near it), and after she rejected that idea, we asked if we could sit in a private booth. She also rejected that. We asked her how we could ever get one of those tables, and she simply said- if we make reservations. Eventually she sat us in the coldest, furthest table. I will note, the restaurant NEVER got even close to full.\\n\\nWe got drinks, and split a fig pizza, cheese pizza, and baked rigatoni. The food was absolutely delicious. I will say, I would of loved to try about 209348 other things on the menu. Also, bread ranking =10/10. It was homemade, with bits and pieces of garlic, cheese and peppers in it. We got about 4 baskets of bread.\\n\\nI would like to go back, and hope that it was just that one night where the service was abohorable. The food, bread, and drinks were definitely 5 stars.

It's a simple question in which she asked... What did you order?  Hello!  You're the waiter and our food is in plain view.  \\n\\nFoodwise, absolutely mediocre.  Portions were small and quality is just not there.  My husband's rolls were the best but they were just kind of sweet.  The rice on my chirashi needed more acid.  My daughter's unagi don was a mere chunk, while my son wasn't fully satisfied with his sushi combo. \\n\\nIt felt as if we're eating in a strip mall.  Also, compared to other sushi places in the area, this joint seems over priced for the not so great quality food and service.  \\n\\nWhen it was time to get our bill, the waiters were hanging around.

Of course, with two children we were not visiting for long nights out on the town.  So he went down to check out the beer selection.  As this was not Vegas, they were not keen on him taking a cocktail to-go, but when he said he was just taking it up to his wife in the hotel room, they were cool.\\n\\nOn a subsequent day, we decided to have breakfast at the Dinerant.  The kids both had the Mickey pancake and it was a hit.  My son ate it plain and my daughter had butter and syrup.  Both loved it.\\n\\nThey do have a chicken and waffles meal (that apparently was one of the meals sampled by Fieri), but of course I am a simple girl with simple needs.  I ordered a plain Belgian waffle with one piece of fried chicken on the side (it is a breast piece if you order this option).\\n\\nI have ordered plain Belgian waffles at many a location and this was a good one.  I'm not sure how or why, but the batter they use creates a perfect mixture of sponginess and sweetness in the final waffle.

The breast is boneless and thin, about half of a standard chicken breast.  The breading is not extremely flavorful on its own, but their signature dish is probably great. \\n\\nI enjoyed our visit.

What a mensch! \\n\\nThe next evening, we got there with enough time to spare before leaving Austin and ate from the \\"restaurant\\". They still didn't have any ground beef, so no burgers, but we ordered deli sandwiches, which were VERY good. The bread is all baked on site, so was fresh and delicious.

We were excited about trying it and seeing what all the hype was about. \\n\\nOur friends made reservations for 6:30. My husband and I got there a little before our reservation, told the host that the other couple was on their way but stuck in Atlanta traffic and headed to the bar for a drink. At about 6:45 the host came over to us to ask where the other couple was and to say that unfortunately they would basically have to ask us to leave at 8:30...but he'd still seat us. What? I would think there would be some grace here as it was a Friday in prime commuting time. And, the place was mostly empty.... \\n\\nWhen our friends arrived (not more than 15 mins late mind you) they 1st were told that we'd have to leave by 8:30 and then....the host told us they'd have to leave IMMEDIATELY because they had a strict dress code policy- he had on linen shorts/shirt and nice sandals. Now, it's Atlanta and it's 90+ degrees out (hi yeah it's the summer in the south...this is what people wear) I think he looked very nice. It's not like any of us looked bad or inappropriate. We saw two other couples get kicked out because of the same thing as we were leaving...\\n\\nIf you are going to have such a strict dress code policy this needs to be stated on your website. I looked earlier in the week (and before I wrote this) and this information is not located anywhere. Also, if you're going to have a \\"time limit\\" on how long guests can stay YOU SHOULD SAY THIS! Why would a place ask guests to leave if they are there spending money and having a good time? This makes no sense to me. \\n\\nOh, btw you will get charged $60 per person for a missed reservation or if someone can't come last minute. \\n\\nNone of this information is on their website...\\n\\nNeedless to say we will not be back and I won't be recommending this place to anyone.

Worth a visit."},{"name":"Shiki","address":"9 Babcock St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3.5","text":"I was literally here just an hour ago with my boyfriend for the first time and we both loved it so much I hurried home to just write this yelp review. This place is amazing and all the other bad reviews obviously have 0 experience with Japanese food. Seriously: do not complain about portion size or whether it is an izakaya. This place does not advertise to be an American-portion-buster restaurant. An izakaya restaurant is literally a tappas style place. So take those comments awaaaaaaayyy. I'll just say I had very high expectations for this restaurant from the positive recommendations from my non-Japanese AND Japanese peers. And those expectations were met AND MORE. \\n\\nOn a Tuesday at ~9PM we came into the restaurant so there was no wait time. This place is pretty easy to miss since it's below ground and just off the main road of Coolidge Corner. Regardless, the decor of the restaurant was very quaint. Each table even has a small vase of fresh flowers. The effort put into presentation and cleanliness is 5/5. \\n\\nThe menu is very extensive. They neatly separate options between type of food and there is a separate menu for sushi rolls. Here is a tip for the go-er: don't go and order basic sushi rolls. Get something off the main menu like their tataki or their carpaccio. You'll feel really satisfied having tried something different from the usual. (I mean, go get your cheap rolls from Genki Ya. Don't you want to try something different and authentic that you can't get elsewhere?!)\\n\\nWe had the follow dishes:\\n\\nSpecial Item Bean Salad: Sounds like a simple bean appetizer, but it was so so good. It is a cold appetizer and is a little sweet. Really curbed our appetite waiting for the other dishes (which wasn't that long of a wait, by the way.) \\n\\nSpecial Item Torched Mackerel: Super fresh cuts of mackerel presented beautifully on a plate. Really great citrus flavor that I didn't even need soy sauce.\\n\\nBonito Tataki: It's hard to get tataki at the typical cheap sushi joint, so I was excited to have my favorite item. 5 slices of very fresh fish also presented so beautifully. \\n\\nAgedashi Tofu: OH. MY. GOD. I have NEVER had such complexity in my agedashi before. Agedashi broth is usually a little sweet and salty, but the agedashi broth from Shiki absolutely blew our minds. This flavor has many root vegetable elements that I can't quite put my finger on, but if I describe the experience of eating this, it was like sitting by a stream in the middle of a mountain somewhere in Japan on a cloudy day. It was SO breathtaking. Not to mention, three big pieces of tofu!\\n\\nMentaiko (Cod Roe) and Spicy Cooked Salmon Onigiri: The onigiri is pretty basic; it's just rice with the filling in the center and on top. It was a good way to get carbs into the meal. It's definitely good, but it's also definitely easy to make at home so skip if you wanted something new. \\n\\nChicken with salt or something (I already forgot the name): OH MY GOOOOODD. If there is something to highlight the excellence of their chefs it is IN THIS DISH HERE. Chicken with salt or teriyaki was the description of the dish and it sounded really simple that I was hesitant to order it. We just wanted more protein in our meal. But oh my god I'm so glad we did. It's so simple, but the chicken skin is perfectly grilled to be super crunchy and the meat underneath is tender and juicy. With some lemon, this was probably the best grilled chicken I've ever had in my life hands-flippin-down. \\n\\nSalmon Ochazuke: Ohhhh mmyyyy gooodd. This was like drinking the blossoming of spring. If you really like ochazuke like my boyfriend does, you'll really appreciate the ochazuke at Shiki. The presentation is gorgeous; you pour however much tea you want into the bowl. It was a relaxing way to end the meal.\\n\\nThe food came out pretty fast since we got there when there wasn't much business. Waitresses were very sweet. Our waitress brought us tea to end the meal. I had great service; I honestly have no idea how you could even have bad service with Japanese restaurants. There are only bad customers. :) \\n\\nFor all these dishes we spent $55 for two. With tip, it's a bit on the pricey side of ~$33 a person, but it's definitely a great place to go if you feel like something special. I really believe \\"Shiki\\" lives up to the name of the restaurant. All the food really took me to a PLACE which is unusual. I normally don't have these kinds of experiences with food, but I really felt like while I was eating a dish, I felt transported to a very relaxing scene cos the flavors really remind me of nature. I'm such a darn fan now my god. \\n\\nOK, I've probably brought the expectations of the restaurant to a new high after reading this review, but I honestly believed it was that perfect from the bottom of my heart!"},{"name":"Canoe","address":"4199 Paces Ferry Rd SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"So, don't do what I'm about to confess to!

VG offers a wide range of fast casual American fare like burgers, sandwiches, salads, warm bowls, soups, and tacos all made vegan. I didn't extensively go through each menu item, but I prefer veggies or tofu over mock meats because I find that mock meat always has a slightly off flavor that I don't really like. When browsing, I found that most of the entrees include mock meat. Still, I wanted to give the buffalo chicken sandwich a try to see how close it was to the real thing.\\n\\nI ordered to go on the kiosk which is super convenient. You can also order here for eat in if you don't want to talk to someone but they also have a counter with an employee if you prefer the traditional ordering system. \\n\\nI waited around 15 min for my order which seemed slightly long but there were a lot of people and they seem to make everything fresh (or at least finish it so that everything is still hot). The employee (possibly the manager?) who called out my name was super nice, read over the order to me before he handed the bag over, and gave me an extra cup of ketchup when I asked with a smile. I later looked at the order sticker on my bag and it looks like every order is checked for accuracy before it is packed up!\\n\\nMy sandwich came with a generous helping of hot crispy fries, and the sandwich was huge. I was slightly disappointed in the texture of the chicken patty as it tasted really soft (and still has that mock meat flavor that I'm not used to) but it really looked like chicken. If I were vegan I think I would be really happy but since I do eat regular chicken I could tell the difference. I think I would have also preferred more buffalo sauce and ranch dressing to \\"mask\\" the patty taste.\\n\\nI enjoyed the meal, but wasn't super wowed.

While they have 4 stools with window counter seating, 5 two top tables, and 2 four top tables, they seem to do a good business with take-out as they were still quite busily cooking away when we were the only party dining in and had already received all our dishes.  This did not last long, however, as only one table was empty when we made our departure later that evening.\\n\\n I love their hollow round ice cubes, as they were both cute and did not displace much liquid.  The Thai ice tea $2.95 was good here.  We ordered both the Corn Cake $5.50 (fried sweet corn with sweet and spicy peanut dressing) and Roti $6 (grilled pancake with chicken massaman curry sauce) for our appetizers.  Loved the corn cakes!  Definitely portioned for sharing, but not for more than 3 people since each person will want more than one.  The accompanying sauce was more a sweet sauce with small diced veggies.  The pancakes were thin and tasty with the accompanying curry sauce, however, the sauce was more peanut than curry.\\n\\nFor our entrees, we selected the Salmon Mango Salad $9.50 (salmon, red onion, cilantro, scallion, chili flakes, lime juice, and cashew nuts) and Shrimp Pad Thai $10.25 (rice noodle stir-fried with egg, spiced tofu, shallot, peanuts, bean sprouts, and scallion).  The salmon was tender and the salad fresh, while 5 large shrimp came with the tender rice noodles.  Both were good, but my vote goes to the pad thai.\\n\\nFor dessert, their only offering is their homemade ice cream in a variety of flavors, $2.50 for 3.8 oz.  Both the Coconut and Thai Ice tea Ice Creams (100% homemade, no artificial coloring or flavoring, no preservatives, no corn syrup) were tasty.  I recommend enjoying the coconut before the Thai ice tea as somehow the flavor was affected when tasted in reverse.\\n\\nThe Tao Hu Song Krueng $10 (deep-fried tofu with ground chicken, corn kernels, carrots, green peas, mushroom, and cilantro) delivered to our neighboring table looked good, as did the $7 grilled shrimp (2 sticks of 3 shrimp apiece)."},{"name":"Shakers American Caf√©","address":"1308 Edgewater Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"One of the best breakfasts I've had in Orlando (and I've been to a lot of breakfast spots).

The atmosphere was quiet as I was here early afternoon and this being my first time here was unsure of the usual amount of patrons, however the music playing through the restaurant was basically everything from hip hop to pop done with banjos and or acoustic versions which IMO gave this establishment a very hipster feel in accordance with their variety of specialty pizzas. $20 for a glass of beer and a 9 inch personal pizza (now I've heard it all, banjo seal-kissed by a rose) while the pizza was loaded with meats as I ordered, the dough is said to be made fresh if I'm not mistaken, yet somehow feels processed by way of taste and texture, however keep in mind I am also a bit of a pizza/hoagie snob as I am originally from New Jersey (omg banjo daft punk hahaha, this is kind of terrible). Overall I would consider this establishment one of those mainstream hipster austin establishments that seem to be the in thing these days.

So after we were seated, we all discussed the menu and then started chit chatting and catching up with each other and forgot the fact that the owner told us to close our menus when we are ready. I know it is common courtesy all over the world, but sometimes you are in the moment interacting with other people on the table and moreover this is not a white tablecloth 5 star dining experience. This is a casual restaurant where we all wanted to have a nice brunch with friends. But the owner came to our table and gave us a lecture about how we need to close the menus and how this is a common practice that is followed all over the world. Most people in our party have been any where from 15 to 50 countries, so we know dining courtesy but what we didn't need is that lecture. It was actually very embarrassing for him to talk to us like we were some illiterate people who have never dined at a restaurant before.\\nAlso we went there towards the tail end of the busy hour around 1pm but since we had 1 member missing from our group, he wouldn't let us sit inside(mind you we were a small group of 5). So in addition to standing in line waiting for our turn, we also waited additional 20 minutes outside in the scorching heat when a few tables were empty and he could have easily sat us inside. We would totally understand if it was super busy but I mean this is your restaurant and not a federal building where you can't make exceptions. The worst part is, after we were seated another group came and they were seated right away even though people were missing in their group. The manager  who is so loud that anyone can hear him, seated them next to our table and asked them to relax and have drinks while they waited for the other diners. \\nAnyways the food was decent. The omelettes are nice. The home fries are my least favorite, under cooked and under seasoned.

I'm not trying to exaggerate anything. Here's the story. When my friend and I sat down and looked at the menu, we asked for recommendation on non-spicy seafood dishes. The waitress simply told us that every seafood dish is either sweet and sour or not sweet or sour, which is pretty much the same as saying nothing. And she got immediately impatient when she saw our hesitant reaction to her \\"exhaustive\\" recommendation. Then we asked the host for recommendation. He simply said: \\"NONE OF THEM IS GOOD.\\" Well, here you see, my one star goes for his honesty. Later on we asked for the check, we found out that we got automatically charged for a tip of 18%. Please point out my ignorance, but I have never encountered such charging policy except at some clubs. But hey, we are not that drunk yet, so, if the restaurant wanted to auto-tip up to 18%, it might be reasonable for me to inquire for some kind of explanations. Seven dollar is by no means a small amount for tips, especially when service sucks to such an extent. However, when I asked the host about it, the host stared at me, as I am a kid suffering from dementia, saying: \\"18% tip for dinner, 18% tip for dinner\\" while nodding along. I was literally disgusted by his attitude so I said ok and shut up. My friend was paying for the dinner. Since she came from Spain, she was new to America's tipping stuff. She asked the host if she should give an additional tip. He said, with extremely sarcastic tone, \\"No no no, the tip is already included. DIDN'T YOUR TEACHER (me) TEACH YOU THAT?\\" She couldn't understand what he meant. What he meant was that my questioning on it was taken as knowing how to give legit tips. And if I know tips so well, then I am supposed to be a Professor of Tips and to teach my friend all the rules about leaving tips. But I forgot to teach my friend this during our dinner, instead we were too busy talking about other fun stuff. Oops my bad. As a result, due to my irresponsibility, my friend was provided with a complimentary service called \\"BEING PUBLICLY EMBARRASSED BY THE HOST OF YEN CHING\\". Then my friend gave him receipt. He said, \\"You forgot your signature! DIDN'T YOUR TEACHER TEACH YOU THAT? Huh! DIDN'T YOUR TEACHER TEACH YOU THAT? DIDN'T YOUR TEACHER TEACH YOU THAT? Huh! DIDN'T YOUR TEACHER TEACH YOU THAT?\\" He asked for about six times and it started to sound like a rap. Meanwhile my friend kept shaking her head, implying him to stop embarrassing both of us. BUT HE simply WON'T STOP. We got out of there as soon I was done with being interrogated for my poor teaching in tips. Good talk. \\nFor the sake of pride of being a Chinese and bad bad teacher of tips, I would never step into this restaurant again."},{"name":"India House","address":"1038 SW Morrison St","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"We've been coming here for years and this place has really good food and amazing service.

However, when it was good, it was sooo good that I can't bring myself to believe it was a fluke.\\n\\nThe first time was the best time. I was there by myself and I ordered the country baked kalebone steak with collard greens and their famous mac and cheese, along with a piece of cornbread. Aside from the cornbread, which was dryyy, everything was amazing! I remember sitting there thinking \\"Wow, this is one of the best meals I've ever had and I'm going to come back here all the time while I'm in Atlanta!\\" I kept my promise but sadly Soul Veg did not keep theirs.\\n\\nThe second and third time, also at this location, the food was not great. In fact, it was mediocre. However, I am docking one star instead of two because both were stressful situations (one was a bad date where I was waiting almost an hour for the person to arrive, and the other time I was really upset with one of the people in my party) and it might have affected how I perceived the food. One of these times I got the breaded cauliflower and it wasn't fully cooked through and the other I got the bbq kale bone and it was soooo tough and chewy I could not eat it. The mac and cheese also was not as good as the first time, and I think it's because it was kind of late so they might have had everything sitting around, not made fresh. Even the broccoli I ordered was too salty. At least the cornbread was much better that time.\\n\\nThe last time I went to Soul Veg it was at the West End location and it was much better than those abysmal 2nd and 3rd times but definitely not as good at the first.\\n\\nI would go back to Soul Veg if I was in Atlanta again because I know the food can be good and because I want to support this Black-owned vegetarian restaurant. I recommend you give it a try and decide for yourself.

Breweries are now all over the region, and they have even started to make it to my area in New Jersey.  But they say Deschutes is where it started, but apparently the Bend location was really the first.  You can feel how it has become landmark in Portland.\\n\\nINTERESTING TIDBIT:  I asked whether \\"Deschutes\\" is actually an anagram for \\"Deutsches\\" because it is all the same letters, and \\"Deutsches Bier\\" is the German term for \\"German Beer.\\"  But they said it was named after the river and not what I thought. \\n\\n4 stars instead of 5 because they are insanely busy, and they struggle to maintain the crowds.  I kind of got mad at some point, but then I realized that the staff means well.   I actually think the staff are really cool there, and it must be a place where people want to work.  The other guests came to have fun, too.  \\n\\nMy beers were just excellent.  They have a huge list, and all of them were fresh.  They gave me an oversized flight.  Back home you only get 4, not 6.

Liz Lessner's newest venue has snagged a prime location in the former Mad Lab Theater, next to the soon-to-be-completed downtown Hill's Market.  Newly opened, Grass Skirt's menu is still in its infancy, but if Lessner's other restaurants are any indication, she'll get it right with this one, too.  \\n\\nThe ambiance pays homage to the Kahiki, with its lava wall and Disney-esque giant Tiki head.  The room is dimly lit, so you need to let your eyes adjust to pick out all of the fun decor, like the puffer fish fixtures or the old Kahiki menu. And, there is no TV in Tiki-land, so forget about catching the game while you sip out of your take-home Tiki mug. \\n\\nFrom fruity umbrella drinks to high-end sippers, rum reigns supreme at Grass Skirt, but those who prefer other libations have a full-service bar and bartenders with flair to shake and stir their favorites. The Dark n' Stormy is the winter version of the Moscow Mule, and the ginger beer adds a nice bite to Goslings rum. Or, if your prefer, have a Polly Want a Kraken? which is the same mixture of ginger beer and lime with the more full-flavored Kraken. My personal favorite was Blackbeard's Treasure made with Cruzan's Black Strap rum. The rum's molasses finish adds a little something unexpected and balances the drink's citrus elements. For those of you who remember the Kahiki's old days, you may want to put in a request for the \\"mystery drink\\" and a gong to go with it (tell a waitperson--they have a suggestion box).  \\n\\nCurrently, the food is limited to small plates and slightly more substantial Menehunes (a clever take on the term for the mythical small people of Hawaii). The spring rolls are first rate, crispy and fresh served with a bright ginger garlic dipping sauce.  Sweet potato wedges are dredged and then fried, and they will take lovers of sweet potato fries to a whole new level.  The Kung Pao Chicken lettuce wraps have excellent flavor and nice heat and are well worth their messiness. The Menehunes, a set of two sliders on, naturally, King's Hawaiian rolls, steal the show for now.  Try the Spam and Swiss (the Hawaiian national food) and the Hawaiian burgers with grilled pineapple.  There are options for veggies and vegans, too, as there are in all Lessner's restaurants.  Currently, the only true Hawaiian dish on the menu is Loco Moco, burger patties and gravy served over riced and topped with a fried egg.  Sounds strange, but it is really a staple for the Hawaiian plate lunch.  As the menu expands, I'd love to see more traditional Hawaiian offerings like Lau Lau and Kalua Pig, all served traditionally with a scoop each of rice and macaroni salad.  And I have no doubt there will be desserts with tropical flavors soon.  \\n\\nParking is limited on site, but there is plenty of on-street metered parking. So get yourself to Grass Skirt for some grog, and start your own Tiki mug collection."},{"name":"La Terraza Bakery","address":"863 State Rd 436","city":"Casselberry","stars":"4.5","text":"If you're in the mood for delicious Colombian food in Casselberry, you're in luck!, La Terraza serves up hot breakfast and lunch as well as an assortment of sweet and savory baked goods! My husband and I came here for breakfast one day and liked it so much, we came back for lunch. Nestled in a small plaza near Red Bug Lake Road and 436, La Terraza has mostly indoor seating and a couple tables outside (terrace). It was a little warm inside the restaurant both times we visited but it was even warmer outside (gotta love Florida in the summer), so we stuck with sitting indoors.\\n\\nMy breakfast consisted of a ham and cheese omelet, toast, and coffee - quite a satisfying meal for $6! My omelet was cooked nicely had a good amount of ham and cheese inside. I thought I was getting plain ol' toast, but it had a bit of cheese in the middle that made it extra tasty! My husband devoured a bunch of meat-filled pastries. I tried a bite of one and I completely understood why he could easily devour them all. We ordered a dessert pastry, but we never ended up getting it and completely forgot about it at the end of the meal (shame on us), but it was probably because we were completely full.\\n\\nFor lunch, with both got the combination plate (build your own) - your choice of meat, three sides, and soup of the day for $8. I could tell the chicken soup was made at the restaurant with the amount of quality chicken and veggies. Yum! For my plate, I decided on the grilled chicken with steamed vegetables, fried yucca, and fried egg. Everything was simple, delicious, and filling! My husband chose saut√©ed pork as his meat choice, cooked up with peppers and onions, which made the dish very flavorful. We asked for cups of water and they were forgotten but quickly brought to us once reminded.

There were nine people in our party that came here yesterday for a quick beer before heading home. We had to wait for about 10 minutes which was no issue, they got a table ready for us and then lead us all to the back and sat us down. While we were waking to the back we were able to see those who we're sitting, their dishes and such which all looked amazing as we were starving. \\n\\nWe had been out all day and we're excited to be here! Well we sat down and got comfy and started to look over the menu, we were excited as we had a vegan and two vegetarians amongst us and per their menu that was printed in August 2019, they could accommodate to both and had a key to which dishes could be changed out. \\n\\nOur waiter was extremely nice to us, at first. We weren't quite ready when he came so he left us to ponder and then returned back. We all ordered a couple beers and two orders of the garlic fries, and he put those in for us. Our beers came pretty quick, I really enjoyed my Fresh Haze, and the garlic fries we're pretty. Had tons of cheese and the garlic aioli was a bit spicy from the garlic but really good. The fries themselves were extremely hard which was disappointing. \\n\\nWhen our waiter asked if we were ready to order, I had said \\"I think we're just doing beers for now\\", and it was almost like a flip switched - our waiter seemed to lose his patience with us and just became a bit rude. But my sister was in the restroom when I said this and wanted a salad when she got back so we had to flag him down to order. She ordered the Elote Caesar Salad as a vegan option, which it clearly said on the menu that this item could be ordered as a vegan version. \\n\\nWe waited about 20 minutes, and I'm assuming the manager on duty at the time brought the salad to my sister and when asked \\"is this the vegan version?\\" As we all saw cheese on it, the manager simply said no and walked away with the salad. She put it down, the. Came back and asked what kind of dressing my sister wanted for the salad, \\"Balsamic?\\". My sister confused, as us all as the menu clearly stated that the salad came in a vegan version, why would she need a difference dressing? \\n\\nWe had though if you put on your menu, with a key stating that you could order it vegan or vegetarian, that you have the ingredients to make the same dish but accommodate the way it was ordered. We brought this up to her, and all she could say was that it was, and I QUOTE her, \\"a mistake on the menu\\". This was extremely frustrating as this is falsely advertising and the menu was just printed this month. So, you're telling us that a mistake is on your menu when you just had these printed? No apologies for this \\"mistake\\" and no offers to make this right? \\n\\nOne of my other sisters boyfriend went up to her after the fact of her walking away, and asked her what could be done, if we could get a refund as we had already paid. She had told him \\"we're working on it\\", unnecessarily having attitude with us as we tried to be civil but we were all upset that there were no accommodations made and no communication with us. During the whole refund process our waiter was back in the picture and I caught him rolling his eyes. \\n\\nI get it, it's a frustrating situation all around but so inappropriate and could have been avoided. I truly don't believe the menu was a mistake as the menu was probably read over thousands of times before printing, there could have been better accommodations made but I won't say do or don't come here, everyone's experience is different. Just take this into consideration.\\n\\nUpdate 8/19/19: the assistant general manager of this location has reached out to me. We are conversing regarding this.\\n\\nUpdate 8/25/10: The assistant general manager came back and said this WAS A MISTAKE ON THE MENU and that it was printed last week (from date of my review).

As soon as we sat down the only male server took our broth order.  We ordered spicy broth and nutrition.  \\n\\nOn the paper provided at each table, we circled the items we wanted with our broth.  That wasn't the right way to do it.  I read in the yelp reviews (after dinner) that we were supposed to write a number for each item.  \\n\\nSome of the items we ordered were sliced lamb, sliced beef, fish, egg, spinach, fish ball, lamb meatball, vegetable dumpling, scallion pancake and lamb bun/dumpling.  All the food comes out in individual plates on a cart.  The sliced meats cook quickly in the simmering broth.  Everything we ordered was fresh and delicious, especially the pancakes and dumplings.  Next time I'd try the Xiaolongbao dumplings that we overlooked on the menu.  The egg was an odd selection and I wouldn't recommend adding an egg to a simmering brought unless eating poached egg alone sounds interesting.  The spicy broth was very flavorful while the nutrition broth was rather bland so anything simmered in that came out bland.  I would always get spicy broth in the future.  Some items i.e. shrimp, scallops, mussels are charged additionally so we didn't try any of the extra charge items.  \\n\\nThe restaurant has a station in the middle with a variety of sauces (as well as dessert).  We tried the fermented paste, garlic/chili oil and garlic-chili sauce.  There were many others but I didn't know how to combine them with our food so I limited myself to these three.  \\n\\nThe service was friendly and we enjoyed our experience.  Towards the end of our dinner one of the women servers asked us if we wanted anything else and I told her it was my first time.  She was very sweet and offered some things to try next time, i.e. silken tofu, fried tofu, pork.  \\n\\nI would come back here for the quality of food, helpful service and the prices."},{"name":"Cafe Java- Austin","address":"11900 Metric Blvd, Ste K","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"This is the embodiment of hospitality!

I really should've cancelled the order at that point but I didn't want to be a pain.   It did eventually come out but at that point my husband was done eating and so I was forced to inhale my food (not the wisest thing to do ).   When we flagged our server (which we did several times- she was never around when we needed her) for our check, she brought it but of course it was missing the Mills 50 membership discount we gave her at the beginning of the meal . She was very nonchalant about getting the coupon and said she would be back. At that point we had 20 minutes to get Downtown and parked so we gave up and walked to the front to pay. A gentleman that works there saw us and was able to quickly process the transaction since he knew we were in a hurry.

They actually carry a great selection with tremendous variety. I personally enjoy their ambers and porters -- anything dark the most. My favorites in no particular order are: 512 Pecan Porter, Blackthunder Schwartz, Breakfast Beer, Guadalupe Scotch Ale.

You know, sometimes there are actually other things more important than reviewing on Yelp...imagine that...\\n\\nAnyway, the overall score for this shows 3.5 stars which I do believe is about right.  The reason I gave this a 4-star rating was due to the service - it was just what you would expect at a Disney-located restaurant.  My reason for saying this place is a 3.5 overall is the service at the front entrance - the hosts as they are - these folks need a little work.  Why, you might ask?  Well, simple really - when you select a certain time to sit for your dinner through the Disney app and then you arrive at the restaurant and can clearly, and I do mean clearly, see open tables available, and then you are kept waiting for an additional 10-minutes before you are seated, it does make you wonder what the heck the hosts were thinking...or not doing...\\n\\nFoodwise the meals we had were superb.  My wife had a chicken meal that was moist, huge, and simply delicious.  I had one of their poke bowls that was equally great as well.  We skipped dessert but enjoyed the most entertaining, friendly, and best service we have had in quite some time.  I wish I could remember the waiters name, but the dude was a pro, through and through.  \\n\\nIf you're trying to choose a spot to eat dinner that's not too much of a hit on the wallet at an Animal Kingdom Restaurant - this is your place."},{"name":"J & W Fish And Chips","address":"9320 SE Woodstock Blvd, Ste 7","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Saw this place on good day Oregon morning show and I told my wife- we are going there for lunch!

We we the second in line for a table... and an open table stayed open for at least 10 minutes with either the party ahead of us or our party being seated. We kept having to move out of the way of the servers, who don't seem like they have the easiest job ferrying food between two small rooms between people; anywhere we stood, we were constantly asked to move. It would have been easier had they simply asked us to wait outside against the window or something. \\n\\nMy tired fiance sat down at the open table (apparently it was being reserved??) just to read the paper and be out of the way while we waited. He didn't think it'd be an issue since it seemed like he was finally out of the way, at a seat. However, 20 seconds later a waitress came running over and asked him to get up and move. He said he'd been moving all over the place. She suddenly snapped and said that he could leave if he \\"didn't like it and DON'T GET WISE! You gotta problem with the policy, the owner's right there!\\" HOLY HELL, woman. We've never been treated so badly at any dining spot. Just the way you snapped was terrifying and I thought you were going to start swearing and screaming.\\n\\nWe decided to leave right away. On the way out, the owner seemed to apologize to me.

Meal started off normally enough-- we got a round of beers and ordered some wings as an app. They weren't spectacular but I can't complain. We then put in entree orders. The pulled pork sandwich was good, however, the turkey sandwich was dry and lacked flavor. \\n\\nAll in all, at this point the three of us are satisfied with the food, service and overall experience. The issue came when we were finishing up our food and the server abruptly dropped the check. We asked to buy another round while we were working on finishing up our meals, and were told by the server that we needed to stand up by the bar if we were \\"just going to drink\\" because they were on a wait. \\n\\nNow, I understand that she wanted to flip the table and make money, but I take offense to being rushed out of a restaurant before I've even finished my food, especially considering our tab was a well over $100 at this point. \\n\\nHere's the kicker: our friend got out of work and joined us just moments after the waitress tried to rush us out. Mind you, we still had plenty of food on our plates and had been denied another round of beer! My friend sat down and asked to order an entree, to which we were told that we needed to go \\"behind the rail\\" which was basically a dark crevice in the corner of the bar.\\n\\nWe were all pretty taken aback to have been treated so poorly trying to spend more money.

It had a friendly and warm atmosphere. You can tell when you walk in that this is a local spot with an established customer base. It was busy both times my husband, son and I went. You will see a lot of family who bring their children with them for both lunch and dinner as it is very children friendly. The waitstaff is very good with the children and overall very efficient. \\n\\nOne thing to know is that their lunch menu and dinner menu are not the same. You have a brief three hour window to try their lunch menu only. They are closed on Mondays, but all other days, they are open from 12:00 noon until 3:00pm for lunch. The restaurant closes at 3:00pm to prep for dinner service which starts at 5:30pm except Sunday dinner starts at 5:00pm. \\n\\nSome of the lunch menu items are only available during lunch. For example, Shiki's kaiseki meals, which is a set menu served on individual trays per person, is only available during lunch. I recommend the Matsu (Pine) which has the most variety. It may not seem like much but this set is very filling. It comes with an assortment of sashimi, a bowl of udon noodle, two fried shrimp tempuras and two vegetable tempuras, pressed sushi rice with shrimp, uni, and unagi toppings, a variety of other small bites, and fresh fruits to cleanse your palette at the end of the meal. Also, only found on the lunch menus is the hokai donburi. This is a bowl of sushi rice topped with shredded snow crab meat, uni, and ikura. Both Matsu (Pune) lunch set and the hokai donburi come with miso soup and salad. These two lunch items are a must try. \\n\\nAs for dinner service, I recommend the salmon nagaimo tartar. This is chopped Japanese mountain yam, which, if you have ever have it before is very slimy. So it's not for everyone. I don't think I can find naigaimo at any other Japanese restaurants in Boston. This is a very Japanese staple. The hamachi Kama, broiled yellowtail collar, is also very standard. I also recommend the agadashi tofu. The takowasa (chopped fresh octopus with wasabi) also has a slimy texture but is also a must try. You can't get this just anywhere. The sushi is very fresh so I don't think you can go wrong with any. We had the sweet ebi (shrimp), the uni, and the scallop sushi. All very fresh. The grilled mackerel with shredded daikon is also very good. Overall, this is not your typical Japanese restaurant with a Chinese or Thai menu attached. It focuses strictly on a Japanese. You won't have a crazy assortment of makis. Instead, you get a more limited and refined menu that focuses on good quality fish. And I have been a lot of Japanese restaurants in the Boston area but there is nothing like Shiki so far.

The corned beef was cut square wedge of paste. Neither of us could cut the English muffin halves because they were clearly toasted well in advance and probably a tray of English sits waiting for the Benedict orders to come in.

Seriously, I felt like someone had spat in my food.\\n\\nWhen my poached eggs arrived I eyed them suspiciously. Are these real eggs? What have they put in the hollandaise sauce?

We ordered our lunch to go and experienced average wait time on 2 of the 3 orders.  The 3rd order happened to be a Salmon salad, which took a bit longer.  Still no problem, we waited patiently.  When the Salmon salad was ready, my colleague stopped to check the salmon to be sure it was thoroughly cooked.  It was too rare in the center for her taste and sent back.  At this point, I asked the host if it would be possible to obtain a table on the mostly empty patio so that I could go ahead and eat my hot entr√©e.  He reluctantly led me to a table, all while explaining that if there was a \\"sudden influx\\" of patrons (at 1:30 pm post-lunch hour for most) for the patio, he would need to move me inside.  To have stipulation disclaimers placed on seating is never accommodating, especially unnecessarily.  I am a very good judge of dining protocol and a master of etiquette, which is why I politely asked BEFORE simply seating myself on this uber-casual, dog-friendly terrace.  What happened next is plain inexcusable and the reason I will never return to one of my regular lunch jaunts.  A server was overheard stating that my table-seating was taking money out of her pocket.  Nothing could have been further from the truth, as I stated before that the patio was virtually empty...on a busy sun-filled Fri...in the heart of Midtown...at 1:30pm.  Lest we interpret business is heavily compromised by the newly opened Whole Foods, and the newly renovated Colony Square Chic Fil-A corporate Goliath options.  I digress.  The coup which stamped my permanent exit was when Joy's husband came outside and approached our table to explain 1. How to properly obtain seating. 2. How to properly order Salmon.  Sir, and I use the term very loosely, I assure you if you are reading this, I experience fine dining almost daily, as do my colleagues and we do not need a tutorial in either.  Your kitchen absolutely needs assistance in how to present an even slightly seasoned piece of protein.  We have spent a vast amount of money at this establishment, and oh, should not have also been met with a default 22% tip upon placing our to-go orders.  My other colleagues caught this omission by Joy to disclose this seemingly new practice, and maybe slick attempt to make up for some of the obvious lost business.  I have never had an encounter where a \\"proprietor-worker\\" so arrogantly over-talked me in an exchange.  I will be certain to spread the word of this experience.

The amount of small sampling available for the price point is unbeatable with this menu item. The salads and water glasses always come chilled and the plates are of different shapes and very clean, which offers a pleasant contrast in comparison to other Japanese places I have tried in the Boston area. I would recommend coming right near opening or else expecting a wait as the place tends to fill quite quickly. In addition, I have also gotten the Teppan Teishoku with Chicken, Pork, and Steak in three different occasions, and I cannot decide which one is best!

The fries had flakes of parmesan cheese on it. Fries tasted like fries.\\n* Duck breast with crepe: The crepe wasn't my favorite; it had an off taste to it. The duck was very tender and juicy, though. I liked the blackberry that came with it.\\n* Popcorn ice-cream: GET THIS. It is sooooooo good! Words cannot describe the heavenly explosion in my mouth.

The noise level hovered around ambient - I was only able to hear the business men at a nearby table having an impassioned conversation in Japanese (bonus points for attracting native people, always a good sign) and the table immediately adjacent to me commenting on the hot green tea (\\"not too bitter or bland\\" - they said) \\n\\nThe food was phenomenal. I ordered the Unagi Donburi (Eel and rice bowl), which serves as my personal benchmark for many Japanese restaurants (that, and sukiyaki). It came out piping hot and served in a single compartment bento box -  adhering perfectly to its traditional plating. I liked the casual flourish when the box was served, it was brought to the table with the complete lid - which is a small detail, but one that lent itself to the overall experience. The eel was prepared perfectly and seasoned sparingly, highlighting the quality of the meat. The \\"just right\\" rice had light Japanese seasoning rather than the \\"shortcut\\" rice cooker white rice - another much appreciated detail. I was given some Japanese pepper to season - but opted not to use any. \\n\\nThe aspect that inspired this review was the top notch service and presentation.

But it hasn't happened yet, so get one of the best Chicago-style Gyros you'll ever have before it's gone forever.\\n\\nWhat to expect: Perhaps the best Gyro you've ever had\\nWhat not to expect: A nice parking lot, or anywhere to sit\\nAnd sometimes: They close up early or run out of Gyro, so don't go too close to closing\\nAnd in my opinion: To love Gyros and to give Nick's less than a 5 is blasphemy ;)\\n\\nIf Nick leaves early, then \\"Nick's Rude To Go.\\" If you boo him as he leaves, then \\"Nick's Booed To Go.\\" If Starlight meows at him as he leaves then \\"Nick's Mewed To Go.\\"\\n\\nWhat to get: A Gyro\\nWhat not to get: Angry when you get yelled at\\nWhy: Nick has an awful attitude, is always swearing and complaining about his customers, and is generally just a sour puss, if you can describe such a person as a puss. But he has been this way for years and will never change, and listening to his rants and getting yelled at is - for the masochists among us - part of the thrill of coming here. But sexual preferences aside, when the Gyro is this good - and we're talking one of the best 5 in the country - it doesn't really matter that there is nowhere to sit, that it's run-down and in a gloomy area, and that you get yelled at. It just doesn't matter. It might matter to some Yelpers, but if you're looking for the perfect Gyro, it won't matter to you either.\\n\\nIf the white sauce gets on your hands, it'll be \\"Lick's Food To Go.\\" And if the attitude of the owner bothers you a lot, you could secretly rename the place in your mind as \\"D*ck's Food To Go\\" or \\"Pr**ks Food To Go\\" but either way, the Gyro will still be worth it.\\n\\nYou have to bear in mind that the majority of Americans don't know what a great Gyro is. They can be duped (and often are) by \\"fake Gyro meat\\" which is the pre-cut frozen strips of curved tasteless hamburger meat they sell as Gyros in the frozen section of your local Ralph's/Albertsons/Piggly Wiggly/Kroger/Wegmans/Walmart/Whatevermart. Here in Atlanta, there are some good Gyros and some fake ones, and a lot of Yelpers don't know the difference. There is a massive taste difference, sort of like McDonald's vs a real homemade big juicy $10 burger. Nick's makes the real thing, and more to the point, they make it better than almost anyone in the country. Yes, the country.\\n\\nHaving tried Gyros in every state and many countries, for me to say Nick's is one of the best tasting 5 I've had is a huge compliment. I will detour to Atlanta just for this Gyro. It will be a very sad day if and when it closes down. Accept no substitiutes. The competition doesn't compare. Come and try it for yourself, and enjoy getting yelled at and having nowhere to sit and the parking lot potholes, it's all part of the Nick's experience.\\n\\nAtlanta doesn't know what it's got. There's not a (cough Hipster cough) place in Midtown as delicious as a Nick's Gyro. There's not a Greek place in town, not even in the distant suburbs, that makes them even 10% as good as this. There's not a delightful ethnic hidden gem up on Buford Hwy NW that tastes better than this Gyro. Believe my hype. Come and get one. If you don't love it, you probably don't love Gyros.\\n\\nAnd if Nick makes you a cup of tea, then \\"Nick's Brewed To Go.\\" If Nick pulls down his pants, then \\"Nick's Lewd To Go.\\" If he uses the toilet, then perhaps \\"Nick's Pooed To Go\\" (there is no toilet here). And if he not only pulls down his pants, but takes the rest of his clothes off too, then \\"Nick's Nude To Go\\" and I'm there."},{"name":"Bombay Kitchen Authentic Indian Cuisine","address":"4107 Lawrenceville Hwy","city":"Tucker","stars":"4","text":"We went there on afternoon for a team outing based on the yelp reviews..

We came pretty late so parking was easy to find and the shop was empty. \\n\\n   We tried many flavors trying to make sure we ordered the ones we really wanted. We got two 2 scoops cones and because we bought the Yelp deal we only paid $5. I had the nutella and Graham cracker. The 2 scoop cone is super big so keep that in mind. \\n\\n   The other flavors were pretty good also. However, the ice cream was very greasy. I know it sounds weird but is that feeling you get as if you lubricated your mouth with lard. You could tell the ice cream was homemade which was a plus. Definitely above average ice cream. The nutella has pieces of nutella inside and the Grantham cracker had pieces of crackers inside and the texture, which I liked. The waffle cone was soooo good.\\n\\n  There are other items that I would like ti try like the elvis sundae or one of the shakes. They also have fun knick knacks you can check out and buy.

Before you read further, I will tell you right now that this may just be the best Dominican restaurant in Orlando.  It is very authentic and the price is so cheap it is fair to question how they are still in business since I don't really understand how they make a profit.  Quite frankly, I don't care either as long as they don't disappear. \\n\\nI have had almost everything on the menu and can say that everything is just amazing.  Majority of the food is served via a hot bar and you can also do a buffet.  I generally get the lunch special which is 6.45 with a drink.  I mean seriously, 6 dollars and 45 cents for a full blown Dominican meal with drink.  The value just cannot be emphasized enough. \\n\\nMy only real criticism of this place is the fact that literally no one seems to know English. Even though my parents are Dominican, I don't speak Spanish and I order more with hand gestures and pointing then actual words.  However, everyone is super kind and it is more of a running joke than an actual hindrance to the dining experience.  I usually go in the afternoons and it stays empty.  \\n\\nAll in all, I have been going here 3 times a week give or take for the past 5 months. I usually never go to places twice unless I am really blown away and if you are looking for an authentic Dominican meal then look no further.

Several weeks before my trip, I actually tried Deschutes' Black Butte Porter in the SF Bay Area and thought it was a pretty darn good. \\n\\nWhen the time came, a group of us went to Deschutes for dinner on a weekday night. Deschutes seemed busy but we came at the right time, later in the evening, when folks were finishing up their meals so we waited just a few minutes for a table. It is pretty loud at Deschutes but I thought the space was very cool. \\n\\nWe shared two pitchers, one Jubelale (seasonal) and one Fresh Squeezed IPA. Both beers were very tasty, very smooth. The Jubelale was like a holiday wine but in beer form, and the Fresh Squeezed IPA was nice and citrusy. We also shared the sweet potato fries which were addictively good. They were thick and crunchy but had a sweet and starchy inside. The flavorful fry sauce was also a perfect pair for the fries. I had the elk burger which was slightly gamey but still flavorful and came on a fresh and fluffy brioche bun. It was cooked a little more well than the medium I ordered.

The rice and beans were also really delicious and felt very hearty. I wasn't the biggest fan of the yellow rice, which I chalk more up to me just not being the biggest fan of yellow rice. The curry goat was okay, it wasn't very exceptional but one good thing was that it wasn't very bony which is the danger of ordering curry goat; sometimes you end up getting more bone than meat.
