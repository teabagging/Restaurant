If you have PLENTY of time and nowhere to be this is your place.

It's very odd to because whomever started this place obviously knows what they're doing in the kitchen and the bar and who to hire to design the place but when it comes to the wait staff it's like they put blind folds on. As far as I can tell they have one main guy during happy hour who is running around like a mad man followed by support staff that fill in for when a plate of food or a drink is up. Waiting for drinks for 10 minutes after you're seated is isn't garnering any customer service points. Waiting for drinks, food, the bill, your credit card back to pay the bill. I got in the habit of ordering the next drink while the prior drink was delivered. \\n\\nThis really is a great place but the service strikes of old school Portland which is to say that it is horrible by standards set in other cities.

Oh, and the house sauce is kind of tasty. The pros pretty much stop here.\\n\\nQUALITY: I have a lot of experience with Hot Pot...at home, experience waitressing for a hot pot restaurant, and simply trying out different hot pot places. It's VERY noticeable if a meat is already browning (the bad kind) from being so old. Now I know this is a given--it's a buffet, so of course you have lower quality meat served to your customers. But there's a limit. I brought my family to this restaurant, and my parents both experienced stomach sickness problems after their meals. It could have been from eating way too much food their poor little bodies couldn't handle it...but personally, I think it's the poor quality of the meat. It's not only the meat either! Look at those canned quail eggs...those limp mushrooms...old old veggies. Seriously...gross.\\n\\nCLEANLINESS: Look at those flies swarming my old meat. Look at those flies settling onto my plate. My sauces. My drink. Oh look, a fly just landed on my chopstick. I think I'll name it Joyce.\\n\\nSERVICE: I wish they gave directions on how to fill out the buffet sheet.

We were not prepared for the awful noise in this restaurant, it was SO loud we had trouble having a conversation throughout dinner.  At one point he asked me to repeat myself (again) and I just shook my head because I was so tired of shouting.\\n\\nAnyway, we made reservations and had trouble finding parking...even after calling the restaurant for recommendation and coming across a couple full garages and scarce street parking.  So we did the right thing and called again to inform them we would be late and they were very nice and said it would be no problem.  Well we showed at least 15 minutes late and there was no host(ess) to be found, only a nearby bartender.  We stood in the entry feeling out of place and considered leaving.  When a man showed up to seat us we told him about the reservations and he made a bizarre facial expression, I'm assuming it was out of disgust that we were so late (which was \\"no problem\\" for the man we had previously talked to over the phone).\\n\\nAt last we were seated and the host informed us that he would be our waiter.  He turned out to be pushy and annoying.  I get it, it's his job to advertise the drink menu and specials, but when both of us said we were not interested in drinking alcohol our waiter proceeded to recite ingredients from margaritas.  I just felt like saying no means no!\\n\\nI ordered the veggie quesadilla which came with two sides of my choice.  I opted for the fried jalapenos and truffle fries.  It took me two tries to get my sides.  First I asked the waiter if my meal in fact came with sides and he confirmed they did and said he would check on them.  When we were almost done with our meal the waiter came back to see how everything was tasting and I asked again if I could get my sides.  After they arrived I can see how they could be forgotten.  The sides were enormous...more like appetizers and came on their own individual plates.  The quesadilla was also fairly large so it would have been fine alone.  I suppose it was worth the wait, my meal was very good.  My fiance ordered the pork tenderloin and he was not a fan.  He said there wasn't much pork and it was over sauced.  I get the vibe this place prides themselves in their sauces because my quesadilla came with some kind of dipping sauce/dressing and each of my sides came with a cup of ranch.\\n\\nFinally, our waiter returned for the final sweep and to push the dessert menu.  My fiance and I were drained from the entire experience from the eye-rolling, tequila pushing, side begging, noisy restaurant!  It was a test of our composure to decline dessert with a thanks but no thanks not one, but three times!\\n\\nOddly enough, I do want to go back!

We were big fans of Little Q and so glad when HPB opened up near the Chinatown gate a few weeks ago. \\n\\nFIRST OF ALL... this is a different perspective on hot pot. It's not Taiwanese style, Japanese style, or have any Americanized elements like the other spots in town. It is Mainland Chinese style. You don't get, or need (see #1 below) spice buckets of chilis, garlic, shoyu, sacha, scallions. \\n\\nThree things make this place a favorite for me above and beyond Kaze and Shabu-Zen. \\n\\n1. The broths are really tasty, especially the Chinese Herbal and the Ma-La. They're so good that you don't need to make your own sauce or use much sacha; cooking your meats and veggies in the broths totally work fine on their own. Some people who are not used to these types of broth may comment or complain about the amount of herbs, spices, and other \\"goodies\\" floating around. That's the whole point though. And... the Ma-La is actually spicy enough to be called a spicy broth. (Sorry, the ones at Shabu-Zen and Kaze are pretty watered down and not really very spicy). \\n\\n2. The menu items: variety and quantity. These guys have stuff that the other spots don't have. Stuffed fish balls. AND the way they prepare things is incredible. Like the frozen dofu. Big slices! Long pieces of hujook (bean curd skin). Fish paste that's actually seasoned. Plus the quantity is befitting for hungry people. Vegetable plates that aren't just a stack of napa and a single stalk of watercress. \\n\\n3. The service. In order to ingest the amount of food that will come, you need to be in the right frame of mind--and that means, not being rushed. \\n\\nYou should come here if:\\n- You are a serious hot pot enthusiast and you appreciate a great broth.\\n- You want more variety of ingredients.\\n- You are mad hungry and have $15-$20 to spare. \\n- You hate being rushed at Kaze or Shabu-Zen\\n- You really want a spicy Ma-La and you're too lazy to make it at home."},{"name":"Biryaniz N Breadz","address":"195 W Central St","city":"Natick","stars":"4","text":"We've tried this place twice and both times were a little disappointed. \\n\\nThe first time was their opening weekend lunch buffet.

My daughters each got the filet, new potatoes, asparagus with a Cabernet sauce. They both cleaned their plates and absolutely loved the potatoes even though they were not french fried. I picked the meat trio of venison, buffalo and game sausage and was not disappointed. The venison was my favorite and had a wonderful flavor and texture without that gamey taste that chases me away from normally eating it. The buffalo, my least favorite as it was not as lean as I would like it to be, was still nice with a smokey flavor. The whipped potatoes underneath all that meat were amazing and light.

I love Mexican food, and this place delivered flavorful, authentic tex-mex (and the portions were pretty large). \\n\\nThe bad: \\n-The waitress messed up my food order, even after I repeated it to her twice and double-checked to make sure she had it right. \\n-After the first round of drinks, most of our drink orders came back wrong. My last drink was a poorly made, lukewarm margarita with ice and no salt. Yuk. \\n-It took them forever to clear our dirty plates, refill water, etc. \\n-In general, the staff had a bad attitude. I know it's New Year's and you would rather be out partying with your friends, but come on...don't make us feel bad about it. \\n\\nThe ugly: \\n-Things got unpleasant when it came time to leave. The waitress told us she'd call a couple of cabs for our large party. She came back with a confirmation that the cabs were going to take 30-45 minutes. Ok, it's a busy night, we understand...no big deal. We have a drink, hang out, wait for the cab. An hour later, no news had arrived, so we go to manager to see what's up with the cab 'stich. Apparently, our waitress bounced after we paid the bill and the manager didn't know anything about a cab. Not cool. We are a little upset and all somewhat tipsy. Instead of calming us down, apologizing and offering to help remedy the situation, the (poorly trained) manager gets in our face and tells us we're overreacting. An argument ensues. The whole night is soured. \\n\\nIf you are going to offer to help your patrons get a cab, follow through with it. If you don't feel like you can follow through, don't offer. We would have been fine to track town our own transportation, but we ended up waiting around for an extra hour for nothing.

With thoughts of home, Chinese food seemed the most appropriate especially with the plethora of Chinese restaurants in Vancouver.  \\n\\nThe minute we arrived, we were immediately faced with a packed front of the house which made sense for the weekend lunch hour.  Fortunately, after we put down our name, about twenty minutes after we were able to get seated.  \\n\\nHere are some of the things I tried:\\n\\nXiao Long Bao (Steamed Pork Dumplings):  Although a little smaller and more soupier than what you would expect from Din Tai Fung, I still enjoyed these little envelopes of warmth.  As mentioned earlier, I am not much of a fan of Chinese food including the famous soup dumplings.  However, especially after a cold day walking around, the soup tasted flavorful and felt hearty with nice little pieces of pork in the middle.  My only critique were that they were too small!\\n\\nShumai (Shrimp and Pork Dumplings): Probably one of the best versions of this dish I ever had! I just loved that you see that nice piece of shrimp that lay on top of the dumpling.  It was slightly salted and cooked well.  On the bottom, you get a pork dumpling that is almost souplike and similarly flavorful to the steamed pork dumplings.  If there was anything that I would get again from here, it would be this!\\n\\nPan Fried Pork Buns: An enjoyable small bite to eat, but nothing special.  I did enjoy the fried outer layer of the bun that gave it a nice crisp bite.  With a bite, you get a small piece of pork that was well flavored.  Again, it was good, but I think I would have looked at other food items perhaps without pork.\\n\\nSoft Tofu with Spicy Meat Sauce: With a spicy kick that hits you after multiple bites, this is not for those who are not fans of spicy dishes.  When I first digged into this dish, the sauce tasted slightly sweet and slightly salted with the pieces of pork mixed in.  It was not until after the third, the overwhelming flavor was heat from the chilis.  If it were not for the bowls of rice that had to be ordered, I don't think I would have been able to finish it.  \\n\\nThe service was surprisingly fast considering how many people were constantly in the restaurant.  In terms of parking, there is basically just street parking available but it may require a bit of a walk.  \\n\\nOverall, Dinesty serves some nice dumplings that rivals the famous Din Tai Fung and so definitely worth checking out if you are in the Vancouver area."},{"name":"The One Sushi +","address":"2523 Caldwell Rd NE, Ste 1000","city":"Brookhaven","stars":"4","text":"The food is extremely fresh and tasty;  several good appetizers.

I only wish we had checked it out sooner!\\n\\nThe decor has a distinct Texas flavor and is perfect for a romantic date night or a dinner with out of town visitors who want to experience a unique meal in a refined cowboy atmosphere.  We dined on a Wednesday evening and there was live acoustic guitar that added a little country & a nice touch of ambiance to our experience.\\n\\nBoth my hubby and I felt the food was fantastic!  We started out with the fried cactus and I must admit that I wasn't quite sure what to expect.  I am not the most adventurous eater and am not a wholehearted fried food fan, so I had low expectations.  But, this isn't an item you'd find on many menus and our friends said it was a \\"must order\\" appetizer, so we wanted to give it a try.  We both thought it was delicious!  The breading was hearty and crisp, a perfect complement to the cactus.  The flavor of the cactus was unusual, but fresh & mild.  It comes with two dipping sauces and I thoroughly enjoyed the queso that had just enough kick and went great with the fried cactus.  \\n\\nThe bread basket is a miniature wagon which adds to the character of the restaurant.  The corn bread is molded into the shape of a cactus which won points for creativity, but we thought fell short in texture & flavor.  The freshly baked dinner rolls were delicious though, and the highlight of the bread wagon.  \\n\\nI had the filet which was extremely tender, had a distinct mesquite flavor and was perfectly cooked, served with the jalapeno mashed potatoes.  It was an all around great meal and rates high as one of the best steaks I've had in Austin.  My husband ordered the chicken fried venison and also really enjoyed his meal.  Try the creamy cilantro avocado dressing on your salad!  It has unique flavors and was a stand out salad dressing in our book.  \\n\\nOur waitress provided wonderful service and we had just an overall pleasant experience and enjoyable meal.

The prices are about the same as the Vortex, which has substantially bigger portions. \\n\\nThis restaurant has a lot to recommend it. Good food, fast service, friendly staff as well as a full bar.

Some friends of ours brought us here for the first time.  I had never heard of this place and I doubt I would have come here on my own with out them telling us it was great.  This place specializes in Cuban food and other types of tapas.  They have a pretty good wine selection as far as I could tell.  It was too early in the day to really get into their wine/beer menu.  \\n\\nI had their fish taco.  I generally don't order fish tacos as the name and idea is really odd to me but their fish tacos are insanely good!  They made them nice and spicy hot for me and they actually had some pretty good heat to them.  I guess what this place is really know for is their cilantro sauce but I can't stand cilantro so I just gave it to someone else at our table who appreciates that stuff.  They seemed to like the sauce.  \\n\\nThis place is a small and out-of-the-way eatery in Creekside in Gahanna.  it will be my go-to place to eat when I find myself at Creekside from now on."},{"name":"El Oriental De Cuba","address":"416 Centre St","city":"Jamaica Plain","stars":"4","text":"I want to give El Oriental four stars, simply because it provides the only example of Cuban cuisine in a town generally overrun by pub food. \\n\\nBut I gotta keep it real. Having grown up in New Jersey with easy access to Elizabeth, Union City, and West New York, and having spent every summer of my childhood with my family in Miami (nevermind having been fed by my grandmother through adulthood), I know what real Cuban food is about. El Oriental meets the standard in some ways, but in others, isn't quite up to par.  \\n\\nThe ropa vieja is tasty, and as others have said, the portions huge, and that's cool. The tostones and maduros are good, but not stand-out. The flan is actually damn tasty, so that's a plus.\\n\\nBut somebody in another review wrote that El Oriental has the best Cuban sandwiches this side of Miami? I certainly hope not. I know personally of better sammiches in New Jersey, New York, and I hear Miami's Versailles restaurant has a few branches in LA, too, so any of those places will do you better. \\n\\nBe advised: what they serve at El Oriental is NOT an authentic Cuban sammich! When you ask for everything on a Cuban sammich, this does NOT MEAN lettuce, tomato, and onion! Damnit! \\n\\nAnyway, the sammich wasn't that hot, the cheese not melty enough, the meat unimpressively marinated. Not too much of a disappointment, though, because to be honest, I've never had a properly-made Cuban sandwich outside of  Union City, West New York, Elizabeth, or Miami. \\n\\nI have to say though, two points in its favor: there is no better place to get a cortadito or a cafe con leche in Boston - it's the best cup of coffee I've had here, though be prepared - it's whole milk, real sugar, and all awesome! \\n\\nAnd again, the flan is delish. This may not seem like a big deal, but there's not a whole lot of uncomplicated, straightforward, delicious dessert in this town - especially not of the Cuban/Caribbean variety, so El Oriental is worth a visit if you're in the area just for some cafe con pan and maybe a little flan. Nom!\\n\\nAll in all, given the dearth of Cuban restaurants in Boston, you kinda gotta take what you can get - and El Oriental'll do if you have a craving for a taste of the island.\\n\\nJust keep in mind, if you want truly great Cuban food, you ain't gonna find it in Beantown."},{"name":"Colossus Pizza","address":"4369 Hugh Howell Rd","city":"Tucker","stars":"4","text":"I grew up enjoying the Five Forks location and was so excited when I found out they were opening a second location in Tucker.

It's so cute that I just want to love it so badly.

I'm not sure if the milk is frothed at the incorrect temperature, but it just wasn't right. The black coffee was good, but didn't find anything special about it or its flavor and same with the cafe au lait.\\n\\nThe drinks are also pretty pricey and are priced similar to coffee shops that carry the highest quality coffee such as Intelligentsia and Stumptown.

But, my girlfriend likes the sister restaurant, the Washington Square Tavern, so I figured it would improve.\\n\\nSecond time, my girlfriend and I had a terrible experience with awful service -- we waited and waited for service, and then waited and waited for our order to come.  About 30 minutes after ordering, we finally tracked down our waitress, and, when asked where our food was, were told it was \\"coming right up\\".  We asked her to remove our appetizers from the bill since we didn't receive those, either.  The waitress started putting on serious attitude.  We had already invested the time and didn't want to have to make the trek to another place, so we waited some more.  Another 20 minutes passed -- clearly our order was never entered and \\"coming right up\\" meant \\"I'll put a rush order on it.\\"  Eventually, we put exactly what we owed for drinks down on the table and walked out ... as we did, we spied our dinner (we think!) coming out of the kitchen.  A manager intercepted us on the way out; listened to our story, but we were so frustrated, we didn't want to stay one bit.  Manager took an address and promised to send a gift certificate.  Eventually went to Chef Chang's house, down the street, where you get constantly refilled water, the service is helpful, and the excellent food flies out of the kitchen.\\n\\nThree weeks later ... we received a gift certificate in the mail from the Beacon Street Tavern.  \\n\\nFast forward many months later ... after the bad taste of our last experience had faded ... my girlfriend and I realized that we still had the gift certificate hanging around.  We decided that we might as well give it a shot again.  The restaurant has been open for about a year now, so the growing pains should be well past.\\n\\nWe had good service on arrival -- drinks and bread arrived promptly.  The bread was good, but we still think we would prefer butter to the hummus.  Or at least provide both options.  Ordered a salad, I ordered the sirloin entree, my girlfriend ordered the Ravioli.  30 minutes later, the bussers come with the entrees ... after never having received the salads!  We couldn't believe it!  When the waitress came around for the \\"check-in\\", we asked her to remove the salads from the ticket since we never received them.  She agreed, but didn't offer any apology.\\n\\nTo make matters worse, the food wasn't very good.  My sirloin was merely average, with an overpowering sauce.  The Gruyere Tot was tasty, but a bit too rich.  My girlfriends ravioli turned out to be just two big ravioli, topped with a large handful of zesty raw greens.  The greens were overpowering and overall incompatible with the pasta.  Can we call it pasta?  Was it dried sheets of pasta incredibly undercooked?  I'm not sure how the consistency was achieved, but it was incredibly tough.  And, after having pushed the greens off to the side, a rather small portion for an entree price.\\n\\nThe bill came, and with our good-will gift certificate, we got what we paid for, and no more.  The salads were off the final bill, but again no apology from the staff and no attempt at recourse (offering a dessert, etc.).\\n\\nWe were willing to forgive an \\"off\\" night, and really did come back with an open mind.

It was great to dip bread in as well. My friends and girlfriend ordered the chicken Parmesan and the steak with blue cheese crumbles. They were huge portions and they were satisfied.\\n\\nWe ordered the chocolate mouse desert to finish everything off and it was very good; I absolutely love chocolate. The only issue with the dessert is it was 9.50$, which I feel as is good it is a rip off.\\n\\nMy only small complaint was I feel the waitering staff was a bit slow, however very friendly and professional.

If you walk in the front door (which faces out onto Lamar), then the first thing you see is a steam-table/counter, and that would presumably mean that was where you start your process of interacting with the staff and ordering. However, there's an X factor that throws off the game a bit and makes your assumptions null and void: a back door. I think that the layout that currently exists, with the cash register and counter staff located far from the front entrance, is to try and accommodate people coming in through both doors. Or, maybe they were expecting big lines of folks to form and spend time looking over the dishes while they were waiting to order. Or, maybe this is just an artifact of this place's previous existence as a Panda Express. I dunno. It seems sub-optimal, but I'm probably overthinking it.\\n\\n/BORING RUMINATION ABOUT LAYOUT\\n\\nI ended up getting the combo that comes with two dim sum items (I chose open chicken dumpings and chicken egg rolls), a bao (veggie or pork-- I had the pork), and a sesame ball.  Oh, and an ice tea to drink because I was born in Texas and am under contractual obligation to drink at least two gallons of ice tea per week.\\n\\nThe chicken dumplings were pretty darn good. They were soft, and the wrapper was just the tiniest bit chewy, which I like. They were a bit pinkish inside, which I am hoping is just from light and dark meat minced together.* \\n\\nThe fried egg rolls were fine. Pretty standard filling, nice and crispy. Can't complain. I probably won't order them again, but that's more about their ubiquity rather than about the quality.\\n\\nThe pork bao was pretty good. The dough was soft and pillowy, and the filling was... BBQ pork! Yay! It just hit me today that the pork bao is the Chinese equivalent of the chop sandwich, which is one of my favorite foods, generally speaking, in part due to my contractual obligations (c.f. the above comment about ice tea, as well as my earlier review of Ruby's). If I could just figure out how to put some pickles and onions in there, I'd be set...\\n\\nNow, the mention of garnishes reminds me of something that I was wondering about while eating, but too apathetic to get up and actually ask about... What kinds of sauces should one use for dim sum dishes? Seriously, I have no clue. I put some soy on the dumplings and egg rolls, and mixed some soy with hot mustard to put on a few bits of the bao, but... The counter staff seemed friendly, I'm sure I could have asked for suggestions, but... it might be nice to have a little board with suggestions by the sauce station.\\n\\nOverall, I'd eat here again, but I'd probably want to come with someone who could help me branch out a little bit and unravel the sauce conundrum. Bonus points if that person wouldn't mind me smuggling in some pickles for my pork bao. :-)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n*However, if I never write another review, just assume I died of salmonella or something."},{"name":"Friendly Confines","address":"7025 County Rd 46A, Ste 1001","city":"Lake Mary","stars":"3","text":"Great food.

First of all, I understand that this place is barbecue AND burgers, but for the barbecue part there should be more options instead of just a smoked brisket basket and pulled pork. If you're going to have barbecue options as well, maybe add a half rack of ribs, a full rack of ribs, and some barbecued chicken.\\n\\nSo, my boyfriend ended up ordering the 5 Alarm burger, which he was highly disappointed with. The description for the burger said it included pepperjack cheese, ghost pepper sauce, and jalapenos. He only got 1 out of 3 of those things on his burger, the sauce ended up being regular barbecue sauce, and the cheese got replaced with swiss cheese. Overall, he was disappointed with his little surprises in the burger. One would think that if it says 5 Alarm, then it must really BE 5 alarm.\\n\\nThe burger I got was the Sunrise burger. Now, the trick with this burger is that it's a sandwich, not a burger at all, (which mislead me a lot). This sandwich (as the description states on the menu chalkboard) has ham, bacon, a fried egg, and cheese. Sounded pretty good to me. I get the sandwich and little did I know, there's no beef patty. I was alright with that but a little thrown off, in place of the beef is the ham (as stated on the menu), but the ham wasn't what I expected either. It was 6-9 pieces of what looked like store bought lunch meat, I was not impressed especially since I could've made this sandwich myself. I figure if you're going to have ham as the main meat on a sandwich, use REAL ham, not quickly fry up some lunch meat and slap it on a bun. The rest of the burger was good except for the ham part, I even ordered mushrooms on the sandwich and they were exquisite.\\n\\nFries came with our meals and I was a little disappointed since they weren't very hot. I always order no salt on mine for this particular reason and even without salt, mine were lukewarm. As well as my boyfriend's fries, even though he had salt on his.\\n\\nWe're giving this eatery 2/10."},{"name":"El Patron Mexican Restaurant & Cantina","address":"12167 S Apopka Vineland Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"First time dining here.

Not to be confused with interior mexican; tomatoey, cheesy, saucy, \\nTex Mex tastes great when it is done well.\\n\\nIt isn't done well at Maudies.  I am constantly surprised by how busy and successful this restaurant is.  They don't flavor the ground beef, or much of anything for that matter.  The queso is thick veveetaish cheese.  None of the enchiladas have any real flavor to them (with the exception of the tio chons-which admittedly are pretty good).  Their beans are devoid of seasoning, the rice is bad, and generally the presentation and preparation of the food is just sloppy.  Take the fajitas for example:  The vegetables are not properly cut, or precisely cut (basically cut 2 inch by 2 inch strips of onions and pepper-which is just lazy prep work).  The chicken and beef are mangled strips and again poorly seasoned.  \\n\\nI will say that I like their salsa but there are hundreds of places with good salsa and good food too.  The breakfast tacos are \\"blah.\\"  Pete's tantalizing is pretty good, but I can think of twenty places with better tacos.  The tortillas are not homemade and seem like a cheap Sysco brand.  I just don't get the popularity.\\n\\nIf you want good Tex Mex, try Vivo (chile enchiladas, puffy tacos, etc);  Little Mexico; Polvos; or Azul Tequilla.  All are the same price or less expensive, the food is flavorful and prepared well, and overall it just looks like they care.\\n\\nMaudies is an institution in Austin.

I got back to the office after a 5 min walk and my bag was dripping with tomato water and had totally saturated the cardboard they put under it. Inside was a half-assed versions of garlic bread and my ziti. The \\"marinara sauce\\" is effectively canned tomatoes which explains the watery spill.

Chipotle and Moe's, being the other 2.   Somehow, Qdoba has catapulted into 1st place for me.\\n\\nPROS:   Great menu options!   Standard burritos and bowls, but they also have a variety of Tacos that are great!   I happen to also love that they carry Chalulua hot sauce!   That's key for me.  Ingredients are fresh and the Guac is super good.  \\n\\nQdoba beats out Moe's for ingredients by a landslide.  It has the edge on Chipotle with ingredients, but here's where they blow away Chipotle:\\n\\n1.  Bottled soda!  Mexican coke!   Way better than fountain drinks.\\n2.  Chalula hot sauce.  Chipotle offers Tabasco.   Come on.  Tabasco is terrible for burritos\\n3.   Qdoba is clean and bright.  Chipotle restaurants all feel dark and dank.  \\n\\nBonus:  I got chips at Chipotle, I swear they were made of salt.  It was the grossest thing ever!   Too much salt, I could not eat them.  Qboda has better chips.  I didn't add this above, because I'm not sure if I got a bad batch at Chipotle, or maybe it was the location. \\n\\nCONS:   None that I can think of.\\n\\nOVERALL:   I really happen to love Qdoba now.   The burritos and tacos are stellar.  The choice of bottled soda is huge for me, since I don't like the fountain stuff.   The ingredients are fresh.

It started out fairly well, we ordered 3 appetizers: bread, gatherer salad, and foie. All were good. Then came the pork porterhouse. I cut into it and immediately realized it was rare. We point it out to our waiter who begrudgingly calls a manager over, he acknowledges it is underdone and we are told they will bring us another one. The waiter exchanges our silverware and plates as they were used for the rare pork. Well not 5 minutes later out comes our original hacked up pork porterhouse, on the same plate that it was served on to us the first time, the same plate that had the raw pork juice on it. We inform the waiter that it is inappropriate to serve us the same piece of meat that we had sent back, that a new piece of meat should have been cooked. For 1, the now \\"cooked pork\\" was served on the raw plate, 2. the pork is slathered with a sweet sauce, that undoubtedly burned being placed on the grill again, 3. the pork dries out as soon as it is cut and recooked, 4. its just gross to place a piece of meat that a customer has touched back onto the same cooking station as all of the food going out. We inform the waiter that we will not be eating it and we would like the check. He appropriately removes the pork from the check he brought to us the first time but upon bringing us the receipt to sign we notice that he charged for the pork when he rang up the credit card. We point it out to the manager who then \\"fixed it\\" but we were not given a voided check when asked for one. We will now have to check our credit card statements closely.

This is just a shame. I go out of my way to support black businesses, and the customer service received is just disgusting. It's a sad truth about our community. I would've been OFFERED an incentive by our counterparts...matter of fact, this would have never even happened. I will never return.

This allows you to design around your mood, desire for spice and you can keep it healthy if it's that kind of day.  \\n\\nFor $8-10, you get several distinctive flavors in the bowl and a nice variety of food.

I ordered the shredded chicken mole on flour tortilla with onion and cilantro. Delicious! No salsa necessary. I also ordered an Al Pastor on corn, marinated pork (usually with pineapple but I did not detect any pineapple taste and none was included in the toppings) with onion and cilantro. The meat was pretty tender if not completely flavorful. I added lime (found at the tea station--not included with the taco as in most restaurants) and their green, creamy Dona sauce which is heavenly though pretty spicy.

I only love grits with cheese, so the added stuff in it made me want to try it.  It came with 2 shrimps and was bursting with flavour.  I would have preferred a little more grits to mellow it out a bit, but I still inhaled the whole thing. \\n\\nArtichoke Rolls (california chevre, roasted garlic, avocado ranch on the side, $4) - This roll came egg-roll style.  It was alright. I probably would opt to order something else next time.\\n\\nVenison Chicken-fried Steak (buttermilk mashed potatoes, spinach, bacon gravy, $13) - The venison was pretty good!  I liked the breading but my friend did not.  You really needed the potatoes and spinach to go along with the flavour of the steak and breading + gravy. I'd order this again.\\n\\nOld School Iceberg (bacon, scallions, cherry tomatoes, blue cheese, $4) - My friend ordered this to try to be a little healthy.  She said the salad was normal and nothing spectacular, which is how it looked.\\n\\nDirty Rice Beignets (andouille sausage, trinity vegetables, creole tartar sauce, $3) - These were okay.  The rice on the inside reminded me of chinese sticky rice.  It was too oily and too heavy so I would not order this again. \\n\\nKern Dog (andouille sausage, cornmeal batter, honey mustard, $4) - This was a little tasty.  Three came with this dish and at first, I wasn't a fan of the cornmeal batter, but it grew on me.  I'd order this again because it was inexpensive and fun to eat. \\n\\nAlong with two glasses of the happy hour house white wine ($5/each), and a pilsner ($5), our total came to $53 + 12.00 tip = $65.00 total."},{"name":"Fleming's Prime Steakhouse & Wine Bar","address":"933 N Orlando Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"Outstanding steak and lobster!!

But when we tasted it, it had shockingly little flavor. It didn't taste horrible, it just didn't taste like much at all. I ordered the Smores and I was completely disappointed with that as well. The graham crackers tasted like dog biscuits. \\n\\nThe biggest problem I had with this place was the response from the manager. The waiter asked us how we liked our desserts and honestly, we answered \\"eh.\\" So the manager came over and proceeded to \\"explain\\" to us how the desserts were all made in house and basically telling us why the graham crackers taste the way they do. (To me, it just matters that they don't taste good, not WHY they don't taste good.)  We are a bunch of women who KNOW desserts. We eat them, we bake them, we love them. We might not be expert chefs, but we are expert tasters/diners. The manager decided a good response was to try to make us feel stupid instead of making up for the fact that we weren't too impressed. He didn't listen to us or seem to care about our opinions. Nor did he try to make it up to us in any way. He should have at LEAST comped the smores or the cake. This is not smart for a new restaurant....\\n\\nAnother note---  one of my friends who was with me that night also wrote a review (similar to mine) that has since been deleted?

It's true, they got the all male waiters thing down like Rodney's Oyster Bar, which is all good, but their friendliness came off as kind of fake and they kept touching my back, or my boyfriend's back when we would order something and that was a little too friendly, but still cool. the women to men ratio there is around 7-2.

Why is an iron in there anyway? I've never ironed anything in my life. Anyway then the room service guy who brought my eight ounce steak, whipped potatoes, steamed vegetables and cheesecake couldn't close it either, so I had to just hang out with it open in the room all night. Also, I had to press the buttons on the TV remote really hard to change the channel.\\n\\nThey put a duck-shaped soap next to the tub in the bathroom and the first night I put that in my suitcase to take home to my wife and they never gave me another one the three times they made up my room. Plus they put the shower curtain with the inner lining on the outside of the tub so then I'm in there showering and peeing on the curtain and it went all over the bathroom floor. They should know I'm going to pee on the shower curtain. That's assumed or at least implied.\\n\\nAnd don't even get me started on the room service. On my first day there I ordered a bagel, smoked salmon and cream cheese. When it arrived, the bagel was wrapped in a cloth napkin separate from the plate of salmon and then there were two containers of Philadelphia Cream Cheese in a small cup. For $19, they can't spread the cream cheese on the bagel for me? I swear to God sometimes I don't know why I even bother. The next day I ordered in the Reuben and it was sloppily assembled and the pickle and coleslaw that came with it were borderline inedible. Oh brother.\\n \\nThen there's these ducks on display in a fountain in the lobby for six hours a day and the rest of the time they live in a penthouse that the hotel's website prices at $100,000. How do they know how much it cost; did the ducks buy it? I don't know how comfortable I am with this. I mean here we have homeless people living in our streets, and then these ducks are up in their penthouse living it up!

I have tutoring across the street at Kaplan and I battle myself every week about whether to stop in and grab a bubble tea or not.  The thing is, I'm not really sure why I like bubble tea so much.  When I first heard of the concept my reaction was \\"that's disgusting\\".  However after I tried it, I was totally hooked.  At one brief period of time I was getting one or two every week.  Now I've come back down to earth and realized that bubble tea is best left a rare indulgence than a regular part of one' diet.  It's not that healthy, in fact it's quite caloric for those of you out there who are neurotic calorie counters like me.  \\n\\nAnother wonderful thing about this place is all the options. There are dozens of different drinks to try, though I've only tried about four of them, including the taro and green tea slushes, and some other wierd ones that were good but I never got them again.  As other reviewers mentioned.. some of the drinks are super-duper sweet.  I definatley like to treat myself to a bubble tea every now and then though, and when I do it doesn't get much better than a jasmine milk tea with boba.  The jasmine milk tea isn't as sweet and it's actually kind of refreshing.  \\n\\nPrepare to drop a few bucks per person.  They do have a handy little keychain card that you can get free tea after so many purchased, but I always lose mine so I've never actually gotten a free tea (not that it matters because it's worth the money).\\n\\nThe atmosphere at Boston Tea leaves much to be desired.  It's small and rather makeshift.  It kind of feels like a shitty break room for employees at a retail store in there.  I feel like a giant in there and I'm a mere 5'4.  I just rush in, get my tea, and head right back out.  And parking, forget about it.  Unless you got at an off time, like Sunday morning, good luck to you on finding a spot.  I usually park in a lot or a few blocks away and walk there.  Otherwise you'll drive yourself crazy circling around.\\n\\nI haven't tried the food there, and for obvious reasons.  Why would you get food there when you're in friggen Harvard Square- there is so much good food to be had.  For example right next door is 9 Tastes, a thai place that is just phenom.  I'd suggest dining there and then hitting Boston T for dessert.   Boston Tea is just for the tea. Period.  Wow riting this review just gave me an incredible urge for some bubble tea!

Lately, though, there's been a rather unpleasant vibe of \\"drink your coffee and leave.\\" I don't mind the expectation of purchasing 2.75/ 3 hours for internet - this is reasonable. What I don't appreciate is being made to feel that I should leave even when I'm making the \\"required\\" purchase amounts.

A buddy and I got full off of $25.  I know $12/person is hefty for lunch, but if you go into an authentic dim sum, it will run you easily $20+.\\n\\nTaste was somewhat authentic.

Hip, pre-made food.\\n\\nNO MSG!  This may be counter intuitive, but to get the real Chinese food taste... you need MSG.  Trust me.\\n\\nThe flavor is there, but the textures are a bit off.  Some problems: very thick dumpling and crepe wrappers; unsticky sticky rice; somewhat greasy fried food.

Yummy and all we had to pay was 7.00 on top of the deal. \\nWhy I'm not giving this place a 5 star rating is because the service towards the end wasn't as great as expected. Love the guy that made my sushi but didn't really like the service that the girl gave who took my money. I over heard that they didn't know how to make my drink and they didn't have pearls. The place also didn't have many seating. They had a few pink bar stools on the side and that was about it. I slipped right off of my chair while I was getting off of it. \\nI would definitely come back to this place even without a deal.

We went in just in time, there were few other customers but by the time we left it was packed.  We grabbed some salami, corned beef and provolone cheese to make lunches over the holidays.  We picked up twice smoked bacon because bacon is our son's favorite and that sounded perfect for Christmas morning and it was our whole house smelled of smoked bacon that morning.  For dinner we picked out the smoked duck.  I love duck.  Going to a fancy restaurant you can expect to pay $30 and up for a plate with cooked duck on it and I believe we paid $25 for an entire duck.  Through the smoking process it becomes cooked so we didn't even need to heat it up if we didn't want to.

The friendliness of the wait staff and the owners are my favorite thing about this place.  Now, I'll admit, that I would stop here on my way from home after work during the week as a treat to give myself a break between work and then studying/working all night toward my college degree.  Stopping in so frequently allowed me to get to know the owners a little bit.  I still feel like I'm in the Italian version of cheers when I walk through the door because I almost always hear someone shout \\"Ciao, Pasquale!\\" when I enter or leave.  Similarly, Piergiorgio will bid us goodnight with a \\"Ciao.  Buona sera.\\" as we leave.\\n\\nThe food is top-notch here but you can't go in with the expectation of a NY-style mom/pop pizza joint.  Think of it as being in an Italian family and going over to mama or nonna's house for dinner.  The best indication of what you're about to receive on your plate is seeing Ida back in the kitchen, constantly moving.  No line cooks, no prep chefs.  It's just her and her recipes back there.  And I don't think I've ever seen her leave the kitchen or come out front.  This is because the kind of masterful food she's putting out for service requires constant attention and love.\\n\\nFavorites here are the Rigatoni Bolognese, all pizzas are fantastic but you've got to get the Stella at least once!  In our most recent visit (and there have been a lot of visits), we had the trio of bruschetta and each variation was full of flavor and perfectly, crusty toasts placed as a bed beneath the ingredients.\\n\\nAntica is a great place to go alone (sit at the pizza bar if you do. That's how I got to know the family), with a friend, on a date or any occasion.  I even brought my Italian family here for my graduation dinner when I finally got that college degree.  What we received that night was a feast on the level with the kinds of family dinners my grandmother would host to bring us all together.  \\n\\nOne last piece of advice.  I don't know how often it's available or even if he makes it anymore.  Just know this...if either of the owners offers you a taste of the limoncello they've made, don't pass it up.  Sip it, enjoy it."},{"name":"Banzai Sushi & Grill","address":"3914 N Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I had high hopes for this place.

I did and received a call back to verify.  When I went to pick up at 7:30, it was ready on time (first great part of my experience).  It was quick and easy to pay at the bar and they had everything packed up nicely.  \\n\\nNow the real test... since every restaurant in Atlanta always fails on to-go orders and forgets at least two items, I've dealt with many frustrating trips back to the restaurant to rant about how they forgot something.  I was very impressed... Hudson Grille got my order perfect, even with my order for a crowd (second great part of my experience).  The food was fresh, cooked and ready on time for my pick-up and was EXACTLY what I ordered.  That deserves a round of applause for an Atlanta restaurant!\\n\\nLast, but not least... ordered lots of wings (buffalo and lemon-pepper teriaki), boursin mac n' cheese, Hudson sliders, spinach artichoke dip with chips.  Wings (bone-in) were awesome - great flavor, very crispy!  The boursin mac n' cheese was something different and a little lighter than your traditional mac n' cheese.  The artichoke dip was amazing!!  The sliders were so-so - they needed sauce to make them better, otherwise they were pretty plain.\\n\\nOverall, great experience.

They may have put a drop of Tabasco in to placate me but definitely what I would consider mild. Even green peppers would be spicier than this junk. My previous review mentioned mall food type but mall food would be insulted by these concoctions. I wouldn't be surprised if most of their food is straight-out-of-the-box pre-frozen hell that's panned off as original. Obviously it's time for this place to reinvent itself or close up shop. If you think this food is spicy, your palate is poorly underdeveloped and should take a trip to Buford Highway for some authentic cuisine that will burn the hair off your feet.\\n\\nAvoiding this place at all costs now unless zombies begin to attack and I'm desperate for food."},{"name":"Boston Tea Stop","address":"54 Jfk St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"The boba is great here, probably best in the square.

Moretti's on Sawmill (superb food, average ambiance), Vittoria's on Sawmill Parkway (wonderful ambiance, good food), and now Claudiana. We were pleasantly surprised by Caludiana.  It has very nice ambiance (4-stars), and superb food (5-stars) and very reasonable prices (5-stars).  Although quite a drive for us, it is well worth the trip. We have dined there 3 times.  You feel like you are joining the family for dinner.  Husband and wife team (Ardie & Natasha) are manager and wait staff, in addition to other family members.  Ardie's brother is the chef.  Almost every pasta (except I believe the rigatoni) is hand-made there on the premises.  The red sauce is absolutely superb. The crab cakes are some of the best I have ever had (even in baltimore), although they could be a little larger (they were reasonably priced, but I would be OK with paying more for the serving).   I highly recommend the Cioppino with red sauce (usually only available on weekends).  It is the absolute best my wife and I have ever had. We took her parents there (both Italian) on Friday, and they said it was the best cioppino they also had ever had. I further gague restaurants by their wedding soup (second only to Morettis) and Eggplant Parm (equal to Morettis).  Their wine list is good (ask Ardie for specials), and the wines are not highly marked up.  We have not yet tried many of their dishes, but are looking forward to it.  I saw the Sea Scallops & Salmon dishes and they looked great as well.

Quick walk across the street to the older building and connected by an overhead walkway to the newer \\"south\\" building of the Orange County Convention Center. Contemporary and stylish with a Las Vegas vibe to it without the cheese factor.\\n\\nHey, most everyone has heard about the processional of the famous Peabody ducks. You can catch this parade at 11am and 5pm as they walk the red carpet to the indoor fountain room where they hang out all day, and then back down the carpet to the elevator where it brings them back to their night time home. Sure, it's a fun little gimmick and a piece of the Peabody history that is worth seeing at least once if staying here. \\n\\nThe Peabody property is huge. This hotel houses restaurants, bars, meeting rooms, convention space, a pretty large well supplied health club, spa and a monstrous pool. You walk around and marvel and the high ceilings, beautiful columns, artwork, lighting, and decor. The front desk staff is professional and courteous. In fact, it seems as if everyone I came in contact with here is attentive, friendy, and courteous to the 9th degree. A few minutes after I entered my hotel room the front desk person who checked me in called to see if all was ok with the room and if I needed anything. That is personal service!\\n\\nThe rooms are just terrific. Sleek and chic in a modern minimal decor. I was in one that felt like a mini-suite. As you enter there is a nicely appointed bathroom and across from it a seating area with mirror to get ready. You walk around the corner to the actual bedroom area where you are greated by a huge flact screen tv and and even an ipod stereo desk clock unit. Amazing amount of windows that let in a lot of natural sunlight. The real treat here is the ultra cool tv in a mirror in the bathroom which is great for when getting ready in the morning. Some nice bathroom amenities by Gilchrist & Soames, and soap in the shape of a duck. There is even a digital scale in here - but I refused to step on it! Fancy schmancy!\\n\\nThe Peabody Dream bed is extremely comfortable and totally dreamy. There are a bunch of plush pillows and a thick comforter on top that envelope you into a peaceful slumber. I had a wonderful night of sleep in this sleek room and woke up totally refreshed.\\n\\nIf attending a convention in Orlando and have a chance to stay at the Peabody it is totally worth it if at least to experience it just once. Many times there are discounted deals available as I was able to take advantage of. The associations that set up these trade shows usually have deals with the hotels in the area so check first before reserving a room. \\n\\nI would love to stay here again just to enjoy it's impeccable services, facilities and amenities."},{"name":"The Pit Stop","address":"3120 SE Harrison St","city":"Milwaukie","stars":"4.5","text":"This place has really good coffee and is always really fast, plus they have a decent selection of food items which can be hard to find at s drive thru coffee.

I don't particularly like or gravitate towards asparagus, and mine was not that great... I'd sub that next time. Anyway, back to the stars of the show the scallops and the steak... scallops were great! I'd 10/10 have these again. The steak... was surprising! I really enjoyed the unique seasoning/smoky char. Whatever it was made the crust on the outside of the steak very tasty!! \\n\\nMy date's steak came with some sauce which I felt jealous of so I asked for some steak sauce, just to try.. it came out cold and barbecue-y. I was ultimately not interested in it. The seasoning was so good though that this did not need a steak sauce at all anyway! So no worries. \\n\\nI ordered the chocolate velvet for dessert (it came with a berry ice cream), and my date had the cheesecake. The chocolate velvet didn't impress me, but the cheesecake was good and will be the unanimous pick next time. It also looked like our desserts had sat out for a few min before being brought out to us, because my dessert looked a bit messy! Unrelated to the taste of course, but I'm honestly just much more attracted to and interested in my food when it looks cute. \\n\\nOur waitress was overall competent, but pretty short in our interactions and she was just not the most friendly lady. But there are other servers, and the steak was really good! So J Gilbert's is worthy of a return visit. \\n\\nSundays are half off bottles of wine under $100."},{"name":"Mohr & McPherson Caf√©","address":"460 Harrison Ave","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"They have the best iced mocha in town.

So when I do want it, it's always a struggle to find a place that won't make me sick.\\n\\nThat said- last time I ate a bunch of food and did not get sick and that was amazing (that was April 2015).   No clue what I ordered last time but I probably played it safe and got steamed veggies and meat of some sort.   \\n\\nToday I got the orange chicken which is batter fried and has actual orange peels in the sauce (am I supposed to eat those?  I am...) and an eggplant pork dish.   Can't find the pork in the eggplant dish but it's fine.  Not outstanding but fine.   (I mean, it's mostly rice and I don't eat rice ...but this is probably standard if this kind of restaurant).   \\nThe chicken is good.   I may be sick later as it feels heavy, but only time will tell.  It is not super syrupy, and while it is breaded there is still more chicken than bread in each bite.  \\n\\nI ordered the spiciest options which look covered in pepper flakes but its still what I call \\"medium\\" if you are used to spicy food. \\n\\nI don't know how healthy/natural this place actually is - but my sensitive belly leads me to believe they are less crazy with the MSG than other places.  \\n\\nI would return (and I have) but I still wonder if there is a better place for people whose bellies are jerks and don't like most of the things that make up traditional Chinese-American cuisine."},{"name":"Arepazo Tapas & Wine","address":"93 N High St","city":"Gahanna","stars":"4.5","text":"I've been here twice.

I was so excited to return, but the second trip proved to only be so-so. The server was hard to track down. The dish I ordered, the crab cake meal, was way too spicy for me. I really wanted some sour cream or even a glass of water, but our server was nowhere to be found. I suffered through eating it most of it until the server showed up at the end of the meal.

You've been on the road all day, and you need a drink. Shading your eyes from the glare of the sun, you sight a busy, windowless tavern across the street. It's almost full, despite it only being half past six. Above the door hangs a sign inscribed with a black bird and the words, 'The Storm Crow Tavern'. You decide to take a closer look.\\n\\nThe tavern boasts a wide range of clientele. You can see a large bearded man clutching a many sided die; a pretty girl smiling shyly with a delicate glass of mead in one hand; and a group of travelers who look much like yourself, laughing as they raise a pint. You can see that pistols, swords, and axes have been mounted along the walls. A carved head of Cthulhu looms over one side of the room. \\n\\nYou are approached by smiling brunette. \\"Just you, tonight?\\" She asks. \\n\\n\\"Just me,\\" you reply.\\n\\n\\"No problem.\\" She quirks her hand in a 'follow me' gesture as she turns and wades through the tables. As you pass you notice that many of the tables are dominated by game pieces, splayed out in arrays that tell the story of time spent. Smiling victors run their eyes over collections of settlements and cities, while the competition sits tense, hands held over mouths and brows darkened with concentration. \\n\\nThe brunette points you towards an empty seat. You'd prefer it a bit quieter, but at least it's in the corner, facing the door. \\"Lots of people here tonight,\\" you remark.\\n\\n\\"Always. There will even be more later on. The Game's on tonight.\\" She hands you a menu.\\n\\n\\"Which game?\\" You ask, unsure of local custom. \\n\\n\\"The Game.\\" She smiles.  \\"The Game of Thrones.\\"\\n\\n\\"Oh,\\" you reply. A glance at the menu tells you that the Tavern is asking reasonable prices for it's brews. The selection of spirits and food is wider than you're used to. After some calculation, you know that you could probably get two pints and a meal for twenty pieces of the local currency.

Where's that special thing that's going to make me call this burger a 3 Monkeys Bare Monkey??? Wow, after the first bight, I felt like I had stepped through a stargate and landed in Roslyn, Virginia at Ray's Hell Burger's or any of the Five Guys around DC or Good Burger in Manhattan. I had asked for 1000 Island, just in case, but only used that for the fries. The burger, turns out...oh my god,..was made with 100% REAL burger. That just doesn't happen here on the west coast. 'Course, they added some of their own seasoning to spice it up a little, but mostly it was juicy, tasty and that was it. None of the after taste of fillers.

Well, I'm admittedly a little biased... OK, very biased. I can't hide my bias. I love Union Square. Amidst shopping trips and general debauchery in Union Square, I need my coffee fix. Enter Bloc 11 Cafe.\\n\\nI did give Bloc 11 a pretty average review a few months ago, so let's get a few of my original concerns out of the way. First, I haven't had a particularly bad espresso drink here. I was afraid that they'd fuck up the milk or pull bad shots in subsequent visits because the baristas seemed apathetic; so far, they haven't. Also, they now have paper menus next to the cash registers. This gesture is much appreciated, as developing 20:20 vision is a bit trickier than printing out a couple pieces of paper. Thanks for accomodating us myopics, Bloc 11!\\n\\nLet's pause for a second. I hate being meta, at least so deliberately and unjovially; any good writer knows to cut the meta bullshit and get straight to the point. (I.e. stop talking about your damn review, and start reviewing!) But certainly there's a very good reason I'm writing a subsequent review, and I think said reason really gets at the heart of what distinguishes a good business from a great one.\\n\\nYou see, Bloc 11 is a great cafe... in theory. But theory is about as reliable in the world of food service as my landlord is in fixing that rat infestation in my apartment. Bloc 11 has amazing coffee beans (Intelligentsia AND Stumptown? Nice). They have good tea. They have decent sandwiches. The pastries are pretty alright. I've never had a salad there but they look fine too. The atmosphere is awesome. The location is, well, I belabored that one already, didn't I? Must I go on?\\n\\nWherein Bloc 11 Cafe fails to be a sincerely excellent business are those ineffable qualities that cannot be measured \\"in theory.\\" Namely, Bloc 11 ultimately fails to put the hospitality in... well, hospitality. A few weeks ago I received a brimming hot drink in a glass cup. No handle. No sleeve. I'm a cook in a restaurant so I'm used to burning my hands, but there's no way in hell I'm going to carry that to a table bareback. I asked the person who served me my latte for the sleeves. \\"They're over there.\\" Jeez, thanks for giving me a piping hot drink and then leaving me to fuss with the details, lest I contract first-degree burns even on my day off.\\n\\nI walked in about a month ago at 7:02 pm; at the time, they were still under winter hours so they were technically closed for a whole two minutes, even though some patrons were still there. I understand how closing works, they're cleaning the espresso machine and dumping out the drip coffee, yeah. But I only wanted a bag of whole bean coffee. Nope. They wouldn't sell me it. Let me put it in terms of cafe business dynamics: whole bean coffee is very profitable compared to other cafe products, the major benefit of that being it requires virtually no labor to sell a $15 bag of coffee. In other words, you can sell a bag even when your equipment is defunct.\\n\\nI probably shouldn't focus so much on the business dynamics; what dismal patron thinks of a cafe as a mere business? The insanity ultimately lies in the lack of hospitality, how unwilling they were to accomodate my meager request. The person at the register was unsure whether she could sell me the bag; she asked her shift-supervisor if she could do that. The shift-super responded with a blunt \\"no.\\" That's it.  Not even a caring \\"no, I'm sorry.\\" Simply \\"no.\\" I don't know if the \\"no\\" was directed at me, or at the cashier. If it was at me, why so fucking blunt and apathetic toward a customer? If at the cashier, why did you pretend like I wasn't standing in front of you? I used to work in an open kitchen (which is essentially what Bloc 11 is) and you never, ever pretend like customers can't hear or see you.\\n\\nEssentially, Bloc 11 simply doesn't train their employees to empathize with or give a shit about customers, and apparently the higher-ups don't care as well. Don't get me wrong, some of the people there are great. But it's a mixed bag; a good amount just ooze apathy, both ostensibly and in practice. These two incidents are not isolated, just notably egregious.\\n\\nHospitality is the reason why even restaurants that serve undeniably shitty food manage to survive (e.g. Applebee's), while great local chefs watch their restaurants wither away into the red. A cafe should never think of itself as a place that merely sells products, but as a holistic experience that begins no later and ends no sooner than the door. Bloc 11 does sell great products. As for everything else?

As the only person there at the time, I can't really speak to their typical service, but my waiter was quite attentive and made some good recommendations.\\n\\nMy \\"main course\\" came before my appetizer, but that wasn't much of an issue as I was alone. First thing I have to say: they have round enameled chopsticks. While I can use those just fine with noodle dishes, anything else just slips away. Steamed dumplings are hard to grip enough as is - some square chopsticks would have made the experience so much more fulfilling.\\n\\nFor my main, I tried the Single Steamed Sampler, which includes a variety of steamed dumplings. Once I managed to get a grip on them, each dumping was a real punch of flavor - something pleasantly exciting for steamed dumplings. The patty vegan in particular had a lot more flavor than I expected from a vegetable filling. It was honestly hard to pick a favorite.\\nThat said, the dumpling skins were on the thick side. Some were a different flavor (kimchi and parsley), but they all suffered from being just a bit too thick. When steamed, it made them a bit doughy. Normally I'd think it's just because they're meant to be fried, but these are the steam-specific dumplings on the menu.\\n\\nThe highlight of my meal, however, had to be my \\"appetizer\\" - the fish ball skewers. Two skewers, each with a selection of shrimp, squid, and white fish, for a total of 6. I'd only ever had fish balls in pho, so to try them stand-alone was a real treat.

On that front, it appears to be great for this purpose. I'm not an enormous fan of cigars, but I will enjoy one from time to time. Further, I happen to enjoy the atmosphere of cigar lounges because they are usually pretty laid back interesting places and I seem to just about enjoy the lingering cigar flavor in the air as part of the ambiance.\\n\\nWhile I'm sure that, in this day and age, many people actively avoid places like this due to the smoke, I believe it is possible for non-hardcore cigar smokers to enjoy cigar lounges without actually smoking a single cigar. So, I am of the view that, all types of people have the right review this business how they see fit.\\n\\nIn reality, if you are a business and you have more than one option and you have more than one type of customer, you are likely going to be judged on the entirety of your business as whole rather than one small aspect that you don't even directly charge for.\\n\\nBeyond Cigars. The ambiance is pretty great. The street view is a plus, and they have heaters that they use often. The lighting is delightfully dim, people go there to play chess or cards, have interesting conversations, etc. It is in my view how most places should be, but for some reason aren't. In the end, I think every related business in town should learn something from Greater Trumps. Even if it is a McMenamin's it seems to be the most 'real' of the lot where others feel like sterile Disneyland. \\n\\nThe bar selection is great. The ports on hand are standard but great. The juices are slightly overpriced but of a high quality. The food selections are standard McMenamins, but wait - they have a great happy hour deal on basic food items such as burgers and tots and fries. So, depending on the hour, the place can also be great on value.\\n\\nIn the end, I'm going to give it 4 stars and yet somehow I feel pretty confident that it's not going to close anytime soon. I will also probably go back there from time to time because it's a pretty decent place, certainly the only McMenamin's I'd actually frequent in the southeast area."},{"name":"Cactus Club","address":"939 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Had a fantastic dinner here!

Then some time went by and visit 4 was lackluster. I ordered several of the same dishes as on previous visits, and they seem to have declined in quality. The patatas bravas were overcooked and too soft and the sauces were lacking flavor (on a previous visit we loved them so much we ordered a second round). The paella was not as flavorful or well spiced. The roasted sunchokes on the spinach salad were totally undercooked, and the entire salad was overdressed with a dressing that was too vinegary. The desserts were also underwhelming, especially the one with goat cheese \\"mousse\\" which was overly sweet, had a texture more like a marshmallow and lacked the creamy richness one would expect from mousse or goat cheese. The flourless chocolate cake was quite good, but just your standard dish. I did have a fantastic cocktail made with beet juice, cava and bitters. The atmosphere here is always nice, though on this last visit it got way too loud to hear each other across our rather small and supposedly intimate table for 4, which made our dining experience rather awkward and a little disappointing, since two of the people were trying to get to know each other yet they had to yell to talk across just 2 feet. We ended up having parallel conversations on opposite sides of the table and left feeling like we'd have to do it all over again.

It was very quiet and there were perhaps only 4 customers eating at a table.  It did seem sorta off that it was so quiet (no ambiance music, and even their projection screen TV was on really low).  Although the staff saw that a group of us were waiting for our party, they didn't seem to feel justified in opening the bar which we were waiting at.\\n\\nOnce our party arrived and we were seated at a two grill table, the service was prompt.  We barely had a chance to get everyone seated and greeted before they were asking for our drinks of choice.  Shortly after, they were taking our order.   It was probably another 15 min. (maybe less) before the chef came out and proceeded with the cooking/entertainment.\\n\\nI ordered the hibachi special which came with, as stated by Cristina N, a heaping helping of fried rice, a big pile of grilled vegetables, a crap load of noodles, a handful of grilled shrimp, what seemed like a 6 or 8oz steak, and a full chicken breast.  Oh, a miso soup and very delicious salad were for starters.\\n\\nThe meal was especially delicious.  I perked up every time the chef had more food to throw onto our plates.  Plus, getting to watch the chef up close and personal prepare meals like this for so many people is always a treat.\\n\\nUm...I'm surprised I cleaned my plate.  It was very, very filling and a very GENEROUS amount of food.  I'm also thoroughly surprised dinner was considerably inexpensive compared to other restaurants (such as Kobe) and how much food we received.  We both ordered the Hibachi Dinner Special, a beer and a sake, and the bill came out to only $40.\\n\\nAll in all I'd hit up Ginza over a Kobe's anytime.  Though, I haven't tried their sushi yet.

So when I received it, I was thrown off thinking about drinking regular, bland hot tea with boba, but one of the workers told me it's still pretty good and sweet, and she was right!\\n\\nMy friend who came in with me wasn't interested in getting one for herself, so I let her have a sip of mine to sway her, and she jumped straight in line to get herself one.

It's a lot easier to sell burgers to someone who is inside your store rather than to someone banging on your locked door from the outside. Geeeze.\\n\\n        Today I arrived at about 12:45 and BOTH of the main doors were locked.  (This is not the first time this has happened here.) I could see people milling around inside, so I walked around the store to the single door on the opposite side. I stood in line for 5+ minutes while no one was taking any orders.  A few more customers managed to get inside when an alert patron opened the door for them from the inside.  \\n\\n      All of the employees seemed to be involved in solving some sort of order screw-up and apparently it never occurred to anyone to get one person to take orders while another person sorted out the order error. The couple in front of me gave up and walked out. One employee duly noted that fact and called out to notify someone in authority (but out of sight).  I watched the comedy unfold for a few more minutes before I, too, gave up and left.  \\n\\n    Managing a fast food restaurant must be a lot harder than it looks.

Not an easy feat, considering our relationship has spanned over 15 years. \\n\\nI remember a time, when the restaurant was nestled on the drag. The year was 1998, my friend Mosely suggested we go. He was really into Japanese culture at the time, and I had never had sushi. I, like many, just thought it was raw fish served to rich people before doing coke. \\n\\nIt was amazing. Lunch specials were $4.99. Two rolls, miso soup, and your choice of tea or water. I always went with water. The lines were never short, sometimes out the door, and the wait was always long. The scene reminded me much like the soup nazi from Seinfeld, except that the owners were super friendly, and never EVER cut you off from their delicious veggie tempura rolls. \\n\\nFast forward a few years. We would see our beloved Banzai (like many others) be forced from it's little nook to make room for Diesel (also didn't last), and shut it's doors for years. It was thought that the close would be temporary, and for awhile it almost seemed that reopening would never happen. But, alas, the news came through, and doors reopened once more on North Lamar, across from the central market. \\n\\nI was happy for a moment. Well, until today. \\n\\nI guess I saw it coming, and, like all true loves, I did not want to admit that my partner had changed. Grown-up, maybe. I guess it was bound to happen. Things change, people change. Economy is horrible. People don't line up out the doors anymore. Maybe people don't like sushi anymore. \\n\\nThe portions are no longer the sizable pieces they once were. The lunch specials are no longer $4.99. what I get are what look like the ends of a brilliant roll. \\n\\nAlso, I was rubbed the wrong way when, after receiving a roll that I didn't order, my whole dish was taken away, so that the chef could correct her mistake. Which was me waiting 10 minutes for veggie tempura (the longest to prepare on the menu) while my cohorts were eating their meager rolls. Tip to anyone in the service industry: if you serve something that a customer did not order, do not take it away from them. Offer to let them eat it for free, since it will probably go to waste anyhow. Instead of doing this, I was left with nothing. \\n\\nI get the scraps now. I won't lie. The taste is still there, so there is attraction. But, I have to walk away.

Went to Main Event on a rainy Saturday night, the worst idea. This place was so busy! My main goal was to bowl and play pool; yet, there was a 2 1/2 hour wait for bowling and no free pool tables. So, instead of calling it a wasted trip (nobody drives 25 minutes for no reason) we decided to have some drinks and eat. \\n\\nWe were initially told the wait to be seated to dine was 30 minutes. Thirty minutes passed and we weren't called. We were told they needed additional time to clean since they were short staffed; another fifteen minute wait. \\n\\nWe decided on chicken nachos. They came out cold! The waitress noted she wondered if the staff had warmed them properly because the plate didn't feel hot, and assured us she would have the kitchen staff make a new batch. Nachos come out again, barely lukewarm! Now, the waitress says she can't take food off tabs unless the manager approves. We certainly requested his presence!\\n\\nThe manager sat down and chatted with us. It was getting late and I'm sure he was abused with complaints. He was surprised that though we had a complaint, we weren't rude or ratchet with it! That tells you what he endured that night, which he mentioned Saturday was the busiest night. He did take the food off our tab, and offered that we nibble or snack on the nachos anyway. Sir, I don't want any cold nachos; I'm just happy I don't have to pay for food I'm not eating and there's a Taco Mac next door I can go to at 1230 AM!\\n\\nI was disappointed because my first visit on a Monday, which was much less busy, I had a good experience.

On our last night in town we were all pretty tired (10 days is a long time to be with just family!) and wanted something fast.  The hubby and I decided to treat our 14 year old boy to Hooters.  He had never been and what could be as much fun as to make your first trip there with your mom, sister, new step father, aunts and cousins.... yeah... dinner to make a pro blush!!!   Anyway, it was pretty crowded when we got there but we'd called ahead so the wait wasn't bad (for a party of 10).  The waitress we had would barely qualify as a human if functioning brain cells were criteria!  She totally hosed nearly every order.  When  the food did (finally) arrive at least 3 of the orders was wrong.  The wings were sitting in pools of oil and lacked the sauce we'd requested.  My pulled pork sandwich was all bun (literally, there was barely enough meat to cover half the roll) my daughter only got half of what she'd asked for, two other people were left to figure out what they were given.  The service was unbelievably poor.  We were there over the holidays so Orlando itself was packed and clearly the restaurant manager failed to staff the place appropriately causing the poor service.  (I Hope..)  Usually after an experience like this I'd gracefully pay the bill and go home and blast the place here.  This time I had to ask for the manager.  Who 'adjusted' the bill... though it took two tries... I had to remind him that when adjusting the bill it's probably customary to actually take off the items that were never received.

Denny's? What do you people expect when you go to a breakfast/brunch place on a weekend and after 10am? For there to be no lines? Hasn't this place been mentioned on like several different tv shows and in several periodicals? In addition, isn't this in the \\"arts district?\\" If you didn't know, that can almost guarantee you hipsters. And let me tell you, if you're complaining about the cost and the amount of food, don't bring your ass to California. At least you're not getting charged a fucking tax for hipsters to sneer at you. Don't want to eat with dogs? Don't sit outside. And on with my review...\\n\\nWe were lucky to have a few hidden gems in the neighborhood where we stayed and Tin Shed was definitely one of them. It was a nice going away present on a cloudy day in Portland. Managing to arrive right before the rush and starving for coffee and warmth, we strategically stumbled into this six (or seven) table establishment. 5 minutes before we were seated. Before sitting down the server told us to help ourselves to some coffee that was self-serve and unlimited refills, not bad for $2.50 a pop, I just wish they had told us it was not free. That's my own fault for thinking so. What made up for it was the coffee mugs dangling on some contraption in front of the coffee, you choose your own mug out of the variety of mismatched mugs. \\n\\nThe menu seems simple and somehow you still end up taking 15 minutes to pick something. It all sounds good. I opted for the roll over (I really wanted the damn sweet potato French toast), two potato cakes (which are really hash browns), eggs and bacon topped with sausage gravy. No, I would not like to add a biscuit for a $1. Although it was uber-tempting. Me lad did get biscuits, the biscuits were good, but hard to tell their true essence when topped with mushroom rosemary gravy. I couldn't tell you if they were flaky, crunchy, light or anything, but they were good. That mushroom rosemary gravy was killer. The food was hot, satisfying and came within 20 minutes, if that.\\n\\nThe thing I like most about Tin Shed is it's a straight up local spot. It's a neighborhood eatery. Northeast Alberta is where I saw my first set of diversity in ethnicities; I was starting to think Portland lacked any ethnic diversity. It's a real chill place inside, no one was rushing you to get the fuck out even when people started to wait outside for a table. The servers are chill and attentive, the cooks are young and they show movies on Wednesday nights.\\n\\nCons: I think they gave me lad the wrong meal all together. He ordered sausage gravy, but he got mushroom rosemary. He ordered regular sausage, but he got veggie sausage. However, since it was good anyway...he woofed it down and did not complain, which is saying a lot from a man that likes to eat his breakfast."},{"name":"Story Book Dining at Artist Point with Snow White","address":"901 Timberline Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Fantastic --especially in June when the Wild Sockeye Salmon is in.

On the night I went, I tried the Arroz Ca√ßadores, which is supposed to be like a hunter's plate - complete with pancetta, chicken and rabbit. Well... that's what's keeping this from being a 5 star rating. While the dish for $17 (regular size) was rich, tasty and satisfying, the meat aspect of it was very sub-par. This is Texas after all, and I've come to expect that everything is bigger and better in Texas. The meat were tiny bite sized pieces, almost unnoticeable... maybe I'm spoiled from eating in the ironbound portion of Newark , NJ  where it's predominant Portuguese and Spaniard - where the paellas are behemoth pots of rice and meat and seafood... so in comparison this was not even a contestant.\\n\\nOverall, I would try the other paella dishes out of curiosity.

The restaurant is tapas-style. From the smallest plates, we ordered oysters (my partner RAVED about them). I got the similarly-priced 6-minute-egg. The egg was incredible. Think perfectly deep-fried medium boiled egg. We then got the spot prawns with cherries, yuzu kosho, lovage and pickled shallots. These were fantastic and I'm not a big spot prawn fan. Our absolute favorite was the albacore tuna, green beans, green tomatoes, bonito aioli. The albacore was perfectly seared and everything just worked nicely together. \\n\\nThe rest of our meal was downhill. The fried kale (which folks rave about) was good upon first bite; however, I soon found it over-salted, over fish-sauced, slimy, and just plain too big. I felt the other portions were really meant for 2 people and that was just a very large portion. Maybe good for a party of 3-4? We got the pork skin ragu and the beef and plums as entrees. Both were over-salted and tasted like something you'd get at a Safeway Chinese counter. \\n\\nIt's frustrating to pay that much and only get a few good dishes. \\n\\nMy advice: choose your dishes wisely.

In business since 1945, the Florentine is a Franklinton gem which has stood the test of time for all the best reasons.  Why?  First of all, they have changed very little in that time frame.  I've been eating there for almost twenty years, and not much has changed.  The majority of what you find on the menu is probably what was on there in 1945.  And they stick with the traditional favorites, like spaghetti with their fresh made sauce, veal parmigiana, and stuffed ravioli.  Second of all, when you walk into this place, it's like taking a step back into time.  The stone covered walls, paintings of the old world, and dark mood lighting screams classic Italian eatery.  Lastly, the people are great!  The serving staff is consistently on-point.  The last time we went in, a couple weeks ago, our server (don't remember his name) was incredible with our two young boys.  He told them jokes, and brought them extra food, and for a parent, that type of experience is special.  The majority of people who frequent The Florentine  look to be blue-collar Westsiders, and although I don't know this for a fact, I bet a lot of them are regulars.  It's a big restaurant, and at 5:00 PM on a Friday night, the place is packed.  I can't say enough good things about The Florentine.

I came here to study with my friends and memories were forged here. The ambiance and studious atmosphere that people prior wrote about are true. I know a lot of students come here to study as it's one of the few coffee shops that does offer that studious atmosphere and is also open later than most coffee shops.\\n\\nHowever, there has been a lot of recent changes that some people have justified for, which I disagree.\\n\\n1. They charge for Wi-Fi use and give you a ticket with the access code. We live in a wired world now, and this may be irrelevant for some people, but for those working on their computers, taxing on Wi-Fi use is a poor tactic to garner or keep your customers from being loyal.\\n\\n2. I understand the no outside food policy. If I was in the food business, I wouldn't want to jeopardize my work either. But recently I was sitting with my friend having \\"tea talk time\\" and as with anywhere that I go, I have my own coffee cup with me to reduce my waste, and the owner walked over to me and directly slid a menu onto me, saying that this is their \\"tea menu,\\" passive aggressively hinting that I need to order from them. I didn't catch on to this hint as I had just ordered coffee not 1.5 hrs ago while deeply engrossed in a conversation with my friend. Then he flat out said I needed to not bring food from outside in and order from their shop, to which I corrected him that I did and was hugely insulted. I read the sign on their door at the entrance. While just hanging out with my friends, I also felt like the staffs running back and forth cleaning were constantly glaring as my friends and I as if we needed to keep ordering more. Between the two of us for under 2 hours, we spent about $20 bucks and for a coffee shop that should be fair, but I felt like I was being watched. It was an awkward feeling and hard to describe. \\n\\n3. Their staffs changed. It used to feel a lot more friendly. Well, certainly not lately. Maybe they're jaded with all the need comers in town. But they're definitely not welcoming. They did not make eye contact with me (or felt hesitant to), and when I asked if they had so and so creamer for options, if felt as if I was asking about their MCAT, PSAT or FE score. I felt like I was a nuisance to them, and that's not okay for a coffee shop/desert business.\\n\\nI definitely will not be coming back after tonight.

When it was time for us to order, I noticed that our server was brisk and impatient with questions. Our server was an older lady with short curly blond hair named Jackie. We inquired about the prime rib since that was our sole reason for going to Polaris Grill and 6 of us ordered it. The prime rib was decent, slightly overdone and not as good as I remembered. The service was prompt but came with a dripping side of disdain. My friends said that her whole attitude changed when no one ordered any wine and she seemed angry when she took the wine glasses away. I can understand that she probably would have preferred to have a table of drinkers who would run up a large tab. Yet, it wasn't like we weren't spending anything as the prime rib entr√©e was $30.\\n\\nMany of the girls couldn't finish their prime rib and decided to take the remainder home. Our server only took 2 of the plates back to the kitchen to pack. After that, she just brought out the plastic to-go containers and bags for the other 3 girls to pack it up themselves. When our checks came, she had mistakenly charged me for a salad. I waited several minutes for her to return for our checks or to even check on us but she was nowhere in sight. I had to ask another server to find her which she couldn't and so this other server had to get the manager to fix my bill. When Jackie returned with my check, she made the snarky comment \\"Well, I guess somebody got a salad for free!\\" as she whisked off. Everyone was shocked and one of the girls even commented that she did get charged for her salad. Only two girls got extra salad and both were charged for them.\\n\\nAfter some time, Jackie came back to collect our signed credit card slips. Again, she seemed very terse, walked back to the computer station near our table and slapped the booklets down loudly to signal her impatience with us still being there. No manager ever stopped by during the entire evening to ask how things were or else we definitely would have complained. The restaurant was only 25% occupied which seemed low for a Friday night.

First time here, thought it might be a cheaper alternative to starbucks.\\n\\nThis place is so much more than a bakery. I was surprised to find they offered real food and at a decent cost since it looks like most of their stuff is homemade. Not what I expect but in a good way. Second surprise was finding out that their lunch menu was available at 9:30am. \\n\\nI got a Corned beef sandwhich combo with a cup of cream of broccoli soup. I didnt know that getting the soup 1/2ed my sandwich but as it didnt change the cost and I left with a full belly. So that was okay. \\n\\nThey called my number pretty quick and it looked good. First thing did was bite into the sandwhich. Crisp, cheesy, salty, sweet, warm and oh so satisfying. Perfect. It looks greasy in the photo I took but its not. I promise. It was the best Ruben I've had in a long time.\\n\\nNext I sampled my soup. I love cream of broccoli soup, its my favorite. I was expecting canned soup that you get pretty much everywhere. Nope. Homemade. Thick, creamy goodness with the added richness of cheese. \\n\\nI tried the chips next and I didn't like them. Not surprising as I'm not a fan of plain potato chips. The pickle spear was good. (Its a pickle) and I don't eat olives so you'll have to test that one yourself. Lol.\\n\\nWe capped off the meal with a scoop of gelato. The cups are really cute and the strawberry cheesecake I had was really hit the spot.  Smooth, rich, creamy.  Nice. The small is perfect if you want sweet without getting over full.\\n\\nI got a chai tea latte with my meal that I ended up taking with me because I was full. It was good. Cheaper than starbucks and just a good in my opinion. Very happy with this place and will probably come here often. Quite the hidden gem. :)"},{"name":"Hudson Grille","address":"4046 Peachtree Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"My boyfriend brought me home the Blackened Seared Tuna Salad from the Kennesaw location, and they forgotde the Sesame-Soy dressing. I was pissed, but I live right by the Hudson Grille in Brookhaven, so I decided I'd just run up there the next day to get the dressing and eat the salad for lunch. I stopped by around noon today and explained my situation to two friendly hostesses. Instead of giving me the dressing and sending me on my way, they insisted on sending me home with a fresh salad. The manager didn't bother to come over and talk to me, but one of the hostesses made sure I was taken care of.\\n\\nAs for the food: The Blackened Seared Tuna Salad was good. I get these salads fairly often, so I've tried many variations of it, and I will say there wasn't anything in particular that set it apart from the others. It wasn't necessarily the best I've had, but it was a good salad. The Ahi Tuna was nice and rare, the lettuce was fresh, and the Sesame-Soy dressing was good. It's also served with a Wasabi Cream. It didn't exactly taste like wasabi and I couldn't really figure how to incorporate it into the salad, so I left it on the side and used it occasionally to dip pieces of the tuna in.\\n\\nAll in all, I've been to this location too many times to count. I've never been blown away by the food, but haven't exactly ever been disappointed with it either. Hudson Grill has been consistently mediocre. The menu is expansive, so there's something for everyone.

When you charge a certain amount of money, there's a certain amount of service and quality that's expected. I did not get what I paid for. Even with the deals and a beer/pop per person, it came out to be around $40/person, which is still expensive for a non-fresh-seafood Asian meal. \\n\\nI made a reservation at 7:30pm for 5 people at the teppanyaki tables. We arrived a few minutes late, but our table \\"was not ready\\" so they put us in one of the side (non-teppanyaki) tables. I looked around and half the people at the teppanyaki tables didn't even get their food yet, and the other half were nowhere near finished eating. Why would you let us make a reservation if it means nothing?!\\n\\nWe waited 20 minute at the side table - no tea and no one came to take our order. Finally a lady came just to tell us it would be another 15-20 minute wait. I stood up and started to leave but the lady practically begged us to stay, asking us to show her our Groupons and she'll bring us the first course. My mom didn't make a big fuss so we stayed. She promptly scanned our Groupons. I was the odd one out so I ordered the Steak and Lobster Dine Out menu. \\n\\nThe waitress brought out the sushi roll course of the Groupon soon after. They were okay. I got a salad in a wine glass, which I thought was a little weird but it tasted fine. After a bit more waiting, we suggested to the waitress to bring us some snacks if the wait will be much longer. She said she would, but then she quickly came back and said that our table was ready. Moral of the story is to ask for free food and your table will be ready quicker?!\\n\\nBy the time our table was ready, it was already 50 minutes after our reservation time. We were super hangry. Three of us got decent seats around the teppanyaki area and two of us, including myself got seats behind the chef. Usually, this would be okay, but the whole point of teppenyaki is to watch the chef cook and do tricks! The chef interacted with the people in front of him, and we were kinda shafted to the cheap seats. We were served the the veggie course and it tasted okay. \\n\\nAt one point, the waitress randomly came up to us with rice, pork floss, and weird yellow sauce stuffed into these cookie cutters things with a candle on it? She kept asking us if it was our birthday or anniversary. This was weird cause it wasn't. Eventually, my mom just said yes it's their anniversary cause she just wouldn't give up. I think it was her way of apologizing for the long wait? It was very strange.\\n\\nMidway through the meal, I saw that another teppanyaki table had opened up so I asked if we could change tables. I tried to explain to the waitress that I came here to watch the show and not to just eat. She seemed a bit confused but eventually let us switch. The chef tried his best to make the situation better, made some jokes, did some tricks. That was probably the only good thing about the meal. \\n\\nPortions were small compared to other teppanyaki places. The food quality/taste was mediocre - nothing special. Dessert was terrible. A half scoop of pre-scooped ice cream that has been sitting in the freezer for way too long. \\n\\nWhile we were still sitting there after our meal, one of the bus boys came and started cleaning the teppanyaki grill with his dirty rag. Kinda made me feel gross about eating food that came off that grill. We asked him if he could do that after we left. He apologized and left. \\n\\nI don't really understand why this place is still in business. Is it cause it's a Steveston tourist trap? Or are people lured in by the Groupon/Dine-out deals? I guess I was a victim of the latter. \\n\\nAnyway, I will never come here again.

And the entrees were either overcooked or over saturated in oil.\\n\\nWhat I liked:  Independently owned, longstanding neighborhood history, and A LOT of waiters with Italian accents that flirted shamelessly with every child in the dining area, and there were a lot of children.  And, yes, after 24 hours, my breath still reeks of garlic from the infamous bread.  The ambiance is fantastic for families.  But we were disappointed by the quality of the food.  I try to stay focused on the positive and the facts; so, here goes.\\n\\n     The pickled veggies are standard and I've had the exact same at a pizza joint in Salt Lake City.  Nice on a hot day!\\n     We started with the Caprese appetizer.  It was average but unexpectedly included pickled onion rings and the most capers I've ever seen on a dish in a restaurant.  Pickled does not equate to fresh.\\n     My friend had the veal saltimbocca.  He said it was \\"OK.\\".  What I tasted just seemed like a lot of corn starch in the sauce which didn't quite hide the dryness of the veal.  \\n     Recently seeing that Alfredo's has a thing for capers, I  chose the evening special which was sea bass with a caper and lemon sauce.  The entree came out swimming in red tinted oil and the texture was off for me.  Mushy.  I did get an extra plate and pour off the oil (I know, not so classy!).   The non mushy pieces of the fish dish did taste OK. after I added Parmesan cheese and I was not disappointed by the mass of capers.  I was still grossed out by the other 1/2 of my oil saturated fish though and,  for the price, expected the fish to be fresh.  I had 3 pre-frozen pieces of fish that looked like the ones I get from my grocer's freezer section.  I'm not that great of a cook and I've done better with my fish at home.\\n     One last thing that I can't let go: We were told of 1 special.  After we received our entrees, when the table next to us was ready, they were told of 4 different specials, one of which was Risotto and I would have TOTALLY gotten that instead!

We asked if there was another desk to service individuals not associated with the tour group.  We explained our pending dinner reservations and theater tickets.  They did NOTHING!  We waited 45 minutes behind the tour bus group, were late for dinner and also late for the show.  There was no apology for the inconvenience, no complimentary transport to dinner or the theatre, no flowers or champagne sent to our room, no complimentary breakfast invitation, NOTHING!

Additionally, as a member of the clergy in Massachusetts, I would NOT refer individuals or encourage parties to consider the Taj for weddings or major functions. \\n\\nNote:  There were multiple attendants at every doorway, but only one person checking people in or out.

I don't know about you, but I like to listen to people close to the source. \\n\\nI've been to La Casona a couple of times and both times the food has been very solid. It's not the best (for that you need to go to New York, South Florida, or Colombia), but it certainly holds its own. \\n\\nMy recommendations if you've never been here are as follows: \\n\\nOrder some chorizo, morcilla (blood sausage, trust me, it's awesome), empanadas, and tostones. Squeeze some lime on the chorizo and morcilla, and make use of the respective sauces for the other two appetizers. \\n\\nAs an entree, order the bandeja paisa. This is a giant plate of all that is homey and filling. Rice, beans, chorizo, chicharron (fried pork skin, it's awesome, though the one in the Buford farmers market is better), ground beef or flat steak (the latter being the better choice) avocado,sweet ripe plantains, and a fried sunny side up egg. This is the most representative of Colombian dishes, even though we have many other really awesome ones. \\n\\nThe way to tackle this behemoth of food is to break the egg yolk and mix everything together into a single entity. Leave the chicharron on the side, you don't want it to get soggy with the gravy from the beans. One of these plates is good for two to three people. If you're really hungry you can attempt it but I warn you to clear the rest of your day and head over to your nearest couch or hamaca (hammock) to digest the day away. \\n\\nOther notable dishes are the Ajiaco, the sancocho or the carne asada. Or, just ask for the special, they usually make the \\"corrientazos\\" (specials) pretty well. \\n\\nAs for drinks, do yourself a favor and ask for lulo juice. This is hands down the tastiest juice we make from a sour and sweet fruit native to our country.

I thoroughly enjoyed my sandwich and the nachos.  It really wasn't anything too special, but the combination worked.   I just read another review which claimed that the toppings for the nachos were scarce, but we didn't have that experience.  In fact, we thought it was a bit too much that we just scraped some of it to the side and devoured the rest.  \\nMy friend stated the beef was good quality, but I didn't try it.

So I went over to TAA to give it one last chance. Glad I did. I think the owners are still scrambling a bit to make the change over AGAIN. The food was MUCH better than THMP, but not as good as when it was TJJP. I rated TAA a 3, with hope that the food continues to improve. Another constant issue is the sound quality. I'm all for loud music, but its LITERALLY painfully loud. It's not an extremely large restaurant, so I have no idea why the speakers have to be so loud. I went Trivia Night (love), but I gave up playing because I could not understand the announcer because it was SOOO loud. Plus there are a few blown speakers which only multiplies the issue! I would think that during all these changovers, someone would fix the speakers!!\\nOne other negative is smoking is allowed after 10pm. With the wonderful, large, covered and heated patio, I wish the smoking was only allowed there.\\nAll in all, I am happy to see that the owners are trying.

Can you call it that? Seated and several employees/servers pass us by and then, as if by some form of sorcery, \\"our\\" server says \\"Oh, I didn't even see you there. How are you today?\\" .......? I just laughed it off. He took our drink order and we put in an order for an app. He came back with drinks and took our entree orders. When I asked a question about the buffalo chicken wrap, he looked at me like I was missing half of my head and proceeded to give a sarcastic response. Look, buddy, I don't mind that much, but you don't have to make me feel stupid. Then, I guess he must have used some form of dial-up internet to put in our order based on how long we waited....and waited.....and oh, guess what? We waited. The place wasn't even packed. Not sure what happened, but I'd imagine he didn't put in our order. \\n\\nAlso, in the middle of waiting, another server came and literally dropped our appetizer. I was a little shocked and she stormed off afterwards. It was pretty fun to laugh about, but also a little shocking. \\n\\nThe food? It was fine. The buffalo chicken wrap with pulled chicken was ok. Not a huge fan of the chicken inside the wrap, but the sauce made up for the lack of flavor. The cucumber salad on the side was pretty nice, too. The portions are large and the prices are fair. No complaints there. \\n\\nAfter we were done eating, he brought the check and was a little awkward about asking us if we wanted dessert -- \\"So, can I interest you guys in some dessert? We have blah blah blah and blah blah.\\" Us: \\"No thanks, man. We're pretty full.\\" Server: You sure? That blah blah is really blah blah good!\\" Us: ??? No thanks man. Again, we're full. Server: \\"Ok, but just in case you change your mind (We didn't) they are up front in the case.\\" A little too pushy there, pal. \\n\\nI'd really like to give these guys another shot, but would change up the approach altogether.

After this years dinner, I think I might be looking for a new place to drop $200 on dinner.  I've learned after years of dining at 7pm on NYE that they're ALWAYS running behind schedule, so I made the smart move and reserved an 8pm reservation.  We were seated promptly upon arrival this year and Mercedes, our server, greeted us quickly.  We each opted for the 8oz prix fixe filet dinner with salad and dessert.  Our salads were great and the timing of everything was excellent.  However, our steaks came out and my husbands dinner came with asparagus (which he hates!), instead of the yummy green beans that he loves from J Gilberts.  We tried to find our waitress to get this replaced, but she was nowhere to be found.  We decided to start eating our other food while it was still hot.  Both of our steaks looked super charred and overdone on the outside so we were worried.  I like mine medium and my husband (unfortunately :( ) likes his super well done.  We cut into them and mine was more overdone that I wanted and his was severely undercooked.  We ended up just trading because Mercedes never came to check on us for a good 10 minutes.  When we finally flagged her down, our steaks were half done and we just called it a wash.  She was able to swap out the side dish, but we still weren't loving our charred/burnt and cooked to the wrong temp steaks.  \\n\\nAll in all, it was a good meal, but not great.

Absolutely everyone here from the hostess who greeted us, the woman who was the runner for our table, and our waitress for the evening were super nice and extremely helpful. Our waitress was knowledgeable about the restaurant, the menu, and was just overall great at her job. The bread here is awesome (we ended up finishing the whole basket) - it comes out warm and fresh and was a great start to the meal. We tried a few different cocktails over the course of the night, none of which really stood out. The Caprese, ordered as an appetizer, was on par with the cocktails - fine but nothing special. For main dishes we got two different kinds of pasta; the Brasato Di Cinghiale and the Tortelli Al Brasato and both were extremely good! The pasta was absolutely delicious and prepared perfectly but both portions were quite small; which was unexpected given the type of restaurant and price point. I could walk up the street to similar style restaurants in the Seaport and get twice the serving size of pasta for the same cost. So while the pasta was certainly a high point of the meal it was kind of a bummer how little of it there was. Dessert was a bit of a mixed bag as well; the Torta Calda Al Cioccolato was one of the best desserts I've had in a while but the Cannoli Trio was bland and not well executed. We were pretty sure two of the Cannoli fillings were the exact same just with different toppings which was weird.

Only a couple of the kitchen staff had hair restraints, and those that did had raddy hats on.  Even the owner/chef made an appearance and clearly had a huge hole in his shirt.

As a starter we got their caprese salad.  You can't really screw that up.  For dinner I got the shrimp skewers minus the grilled veggies it is normally served with (since they bread it), but I was able to substitute grilled asparagus.

So I'm freaking out, because I very much appreciate these kind of places. It's one of the things that I miss most about Japan--the bakeries. \\n\\nAnd everything was sooo cheap! I bought four items, and it came out to $6.55. Almost everything on the wall on the right side of the store is about $1.75 or so.

We were disappointed and will not return. A restaurant with such a long history should have done better.  They are good (just good) in some areas and not others.   The fried calamari appetizer was good.  They were tender and lightly fried.   Unfortunately it only includes rings and not the others enjoyable calamari parts (body).  The entrees were lacking.  The chicken was tender and the highlight.  The dolmades were good but small.  The gyro meat was ok and seems to lack seasoning.  The main disappointment was the sides.  The potatoes with cheese were mushy and appeared to have been reheated, not made fresh.  The big mistake was their use of flavorless and canned green beans.   They use the tomato sauce to try to recover them but it does not help.   Good grief.  Fresh green beans are not that expensive and look much better on the plate.  While the food was not entirely unappetizing, we will not be retuning unless they are invaded and revamped by Robert Irvine or Gordon Ramsey.   I know that I should have checked Yelp before going and not afterward.   Overall the food is unfortunately reflective of the tired and old decor that is in a 80's/90's time warp.  I know that I echo some other previous reviews.   It is sad that they don't appear to have any pride in quality any longer given their previous accolades.   I suppose we should have known something was up whenever the main clientele was geriatric and have apparently lost their sense of taste a while ago.  They need to remove \\"Beat Greek food in Orlando\\" from their sign and either close up or revamp.  I don't think that they even read or follow social media given the lack of updating on their website and no reactions to the previous reviews.   The owners really need to consider closing shop as there are walk up fast food places at the malls serving better Greek food.  Either that or embrace their customer's opinions and change.   Was hoping for a replacement for a go to place for Greek food after losing the Greek Flame to the other side of Orlando many years ago.

The soup was perfect as far as Chinese soups go.  It's flavored primarily by the pork and vegetables, and not heavily seasoned with salt or MSG.  The Rice cakes on both versions were dense, very glutenous and had a nice bite to it.  The stir fried version I got was covered, but not drenched in a brown, soy sauce based sauce.  Like a good salad, it wasn't runny and the sauce never pooled on the bottom of the plate.  It also wasn't thick and goopy with corn starch the way many stir fry rice cake dishes are.  Why anyone would add cornstarch to the super starchy rice cakes is completely beyond me.\\n\\nIn short, the rice cake dishes were clean and tasty.\\n\\nThe last thing we ordered was the XLB.  I've had XLB in various Dim Sum places around, and the gourmet dumpling house (though I have yet to try the ones at taiwan cafe) and the contrast to Wing's is pretty noticeable.  Wing's XLB reminded me of the tourist trap dumplings I had in Shanghai, which might sound like an insult, but those were good dumplings so I mean only the best.  The filling is very light in flavor in comparison to the fillings of most other places where the pork balls are pink with soy sauce or contain minced garlic.  It seems like the filling in Wing's is just seasoned with a little salt and MSG.  There also is a fair, but not obscene amount of juice in the buns.  I have to say that the XLB at Wing's are the best I've had in the area, but perhaps those who prefer bolder flavors would disagree with me.\\n\\nThe food here is cleaner than most of the corn starch drenched dinner dishes in C.

I am familiar with Mexican food and can say that there was close to no effort made into creating an actual tortilla soup. Maybe they got tortilla soup and gazpacho mixed up? Another person in our party ordered well done steak but it was medium rare. They did end up not charging for the steak on the bill, which was very nice.

About 20 minutes later, one of the customers in the middle told her that I had been there a while.

Finally after seating us, we felt a little rushed as they brought out the soup and salad (within a few minutes of each other). The hibachi chef came and did the usual jokes but didn't have a working lighter to light the fire for the initial \\"trick\\" so he had to borrow a customer's.  Like I said, the food was just ok.  The server basically disappeared at this point.  After we were done eating, we waited a while for the server to come back so we could get our checks.

Surprisingly, the bare essentials of MoJoe Lounge- i.e. price, selection, location, and vibe- are on par with the vast majority of the many other comparable locales in the Short North area. Instead of attempting to beat the competition at their own game, MoJoe sticks to its guns and offers decent food and drink at a predictable price in an enviable location right in the heart of Columbus' hippest neighborhood. \\n\\nIf you stop by during daylight, MoJoe is essentially the same as most of its brethren- an extensive selection of drinks and snacks to keep your day going with a comfortable space to enjoy them in. Free wifi is an added perk that gives MoJoe an edge over the Starbucks that conspicuously popped up across the street a few years ago; the outdoor patio also boasts a better spot than any to do some quality people watching on a busy afternoon. \\n\\nOnce night falls, MoJoe does a respectable job of competing for the many bar-goers that troll the streets of Short North in search of a tame place to socialize and knock back a drink or two. The draft selection is paltry, but if you're in the mood for a modestly priced cocktail or a bottled import, then you're in the right place. Like I said, nothing on the drink menu is too out of the ordinary, but it's unlikely that you're coming here to do a serious beer tour or wine tasting. The atmosphere is bustling on weekend nights and during happy hour, but with the exception of Gallery Hop nights, it's a safe bet to find a table and relax for a few hours. \\n\\nThe menu is fairly simple but will cater to just about any taste or mood you may be in. Like the drink selection, the food here at MoJoe isn't particularly adventurous, but it's hard to find a dud item on the menu. The pizza is a great snack to share between two people, and the wraps, which are my personal favorite, are full of flavor without being too heavy for a preamble to a night of drinking in the neighborhood. \\n\\nMoJoe catches a lot of flak for it's yuppie/scenester clientele and it's complete dearth of parking, but it's no fault of their own; what do you expect in this neighborhood? Would you rather them ward off the hipsters with a steady stream of John Tesh and nightly $1 mug specials? MoJoe does a well enough job at what it knows best, and given it's prime location and an enviable outdoor patio, it's all you can ask of a local coffee shop."},{"name":"El Buzo Restaurant","address":"1436 State Rd 436, Ste 1024","city":"Casselberry","stars":"4","text":"Great food and fresh!!!

The rolls are all amazing (yes, I have been there enough to actually have tried them all) and the chef's platters (the sushi, sashimi platter being my favorite) are to die for. I can honestly say that the creativity, skill, and knowledge of the chefs has made this place a must.\\n\\nThe entire staff from hostesses, waiters/waitresses, and chefs are extremely courteous, friendly, and incredibly helpful.

We were sitting outside yet we could still see the commotion going on inside. What looked like an employee or friend of the cook came in & was talking & goofing around for at least 15 minutes. I don't own a business but I know that kind of behavior should be unacceptable & unprofessional. Whoever manages the servers & cooks should be embarrassed. \\n\\n\\nThe food was lacking flavor & presentation. The Quattro Formaggio looked like a plain one-cheese pizza because they had melted the cheese together at once.

It was empty, except for a few people tucked away in corners on their laptops. I ordered decaf coffee and got an amazing cup of decaf espresso.  I usually add cream to my coffee to make it a bit richer, but this cup was perfect on its own. \\nWe ordered a slice of banana cream pie and a slice of  the salted caramel apple pie. The banana cream had cinnamon  heavily sprinkled on the top....I loved it! I will be adding cinnamon to any future piece of banana cream pie from now on. The crust was not very light or flakey, but it wasn't overcooked either. My husband was not terribly impressed with his apple pie. It didn't look yummy...it looked dry and flat. \\nBy the time we finished, the place was full and so loud, much like many of the other small places on Alberta. I love the food in the Alberta area, but the ambiance usually sucks. I can't speak to the service because my husband ordered for me but I didn't ever see any rudeness. The kitchen area is extremely loud so you have to talk loudly over the fairly constant clanking and banging. The music is also pretty overpowering.  It feels like they don't want you to stay and enjoy your food, but rather order it to go. Next time I will sit outside. \\nOverall, a typical hipster joint with pretty good pie and great espresso."},{"name":"El Oriental De Cuba","address":"416 Centre St","city":"Jamaica Plain","stars":"4","text":"One of my favorite places for Latino food in Boston!

Had a reservation and our table was ready when we arrived, impressive!\\n\\nThe atmosphere was loud and boisterous. Several small tables spaced closely together, and large communal tables as well. Concrete floors, large graphic-painted walls. I'd say the environment feels sort of like an upscale pizza restaurant. One very positive thing: the common bench that ran the length of the restaurant was padded on the seat and back, and very comfortable; much more so than most of this style. Last word on atmosphere: given how loud it was, it was hard to have a conversation with my dinner mate without shouting, which seemed rude to the people sitting 10\\" away at the neighboring two-top tables. This seems like a great concept for a date night, but it was disappointingly not romantic or intimate. I hope more soundproofing will be added.\\n\\nOK, shut up about the space and get to the food. \\n\\nThe food was great! A large selection of tapas, with a good mix of safe/Americanized, and more traditional/adventurous. The adventurous options were also slightly adjusted to the American palate, but I thought that was appropriate. Everything was well portioned, though perhaps the prices were $2-3 more than I would've expected for the size. \\n\\nWe tried to order things that were more on the adventurous side. For those who aren't adventurous eaters or have food restrictions, check out the menu ahead of time. It is extensive and I'm sure you will find plenty of items that you'll enjoy.\\n\\nWe had:\\nLatas: Empedrat. Bacalao / white beans / tomato -- Excellent, one of our favorites from the evening. Great-sized portion served in a tin sardine can (but homemade, not from a can!). Bacalao is dried/salted cod, but this was not a fishy dish at all. Lots of flavor. Beans were delish.\\n\\nHot: Trinxat. Potatoes & green chard and pancetta -- Not at all what we were expecting, but we really liked it. Think of this as green mashed potatoes with pancetta. It's all blended together so it has a thick mashed potato texture. Very tasty and filling -- this is a good one to order to help you fill up. I will try to make this at home and serve it as a side dish, but I probably won't order this as a tapa again.\\n\\nHot: Grilled morcilla sausage / baby white beans -- My favorite dish. Morcilla is blood sausage. Don't let that scare you. The texture and flavor are great, and this was far less scary than some of the morcilla I ate in Spain. I would definitely order this again.\\n\\nHot: Grilled chorizo / garbanzos / chimichurri -- Fantastic. Spanish chorizo is not like Mexican chorizo; it is coarse ground and not greasy. The dominant flavor is smoky paprika. This was a fresh sausage, grilled (some places serve it dried). Very good, would definitely order this again. We recommended it to the table next to us, who were ordering some of the safer items, and they loved it too.\\n\\nCold: Shrimp / avocado / gazpacho vinaigrette -- Good, but safe. We saw this dish being served all around us, so it must be one of the more popular ones. It was exactly what you would expect -- cold shrimp over sliced avocado with a tomato-y dressing. Nothing wrong with it, but lacked adventure.\\n\\nPaella Barlata. Saffron rice / seafood /chicken chorizo / vegetables / chicken stock -- We ordered the small, which was plenty big given the number of tapas we had. This was unfortunately over salted. Disappointing because the flavor was very good, the meats were well cooked, and the dish didn't need the salt to compensate for anything. We were glad it was served last because we didn't feel bad leaving a little in the pan.\\n\\nService was SUPER FAST, which was especially pleasing given the number of tables they were managing. Everything was well-timed and all servers were well informed about the menu. Our water glasses were kept full. Bar was running a bit behind, so the drinks took an extra minute, but nothing terrible.\\n\\nOverall, we were very, very pleased with the meal. I'm so close to giving it 5 stars and excited to go back, but  I'd like to see the noise level turned down a bit, and they really gotta get the paella right. That's probably the most popular dish on the menu, they need to nail it so folks end their meal on a high note and don't mind the bill!"},{"name":"Bull McCabe's Pub","address":"366A Somerville Ave","city":"Somerville","stars":"4.5","text":"I used to love this place.

Don't go on Sunday night. They run out of everything. \\n2. The meat is better than the fish, at least what we tried.\\n3. Service is hit and miss.\\n\\nWe arrived a little early for an 8:30 reservation, and then waited 10 minutes before we were acknowledged after being seated. I hate that. We went back so soon because we had a second coupon to use up which allows one of two entree choices. Since last time we tried the filet and quail (which we liked a lot), this time we tried the blackened mahi and mussels. Strike 1: out of mussels. We subbed blackened shrimp, which is not nearly as good a choice. I tried the divorced rainbow trout, because having had such wonderful rainbow trout the night before (elsewhere), I was still in the mood. He had Lupita's salad, I had the caesar again.\\n\\nStrike 2: the whole leaf caesar arrives on a tiny plate, which means every time I tried to cut up the lettuce, it all spilled all over the table. Gross. Last time it came on an appropriately sized plate, so I know they must at least HAVE the right plates. It still tasted good, but it was a pain.\\n\\nStrike 3: While I was still struggling to eat my salad without spilling it everywhere, the entrees arrived. I wasn't even HALF done with my salad. Terrible pacing. \\n\\nStrike 4: When we asked about the rolls we enjoyed so much last time with butter and honey, they said they did not have them. I must assume they ran out, because they had them last Monday. They are really good, and we were bummed not to have them.\\n\\nStrike 5: I really hated the blackened mahi and shrimp. I think it's the seasonings they used to blacken it, but I actively disliked it. I rarely dislike fish. But the flavor just wasn't good. The sauteed spinach was very bland, so I didn't like that either.  \\n\\nStrike 6: The divorced trout was also bland and uninteresting, even with all of the sauces around it. The dish is half fried, half grilled trout. I wanted to divorce both of them. At least the grilled veggies were good.\\n\\nFor dessert we tried the fried pie, which was peach tonight. It was ok. Nothing special. \\n\\nAfter dinner we had to wait around for our check. I wouldn't have minded normally, but at this point I just wanted to go home. First I felt rushed so I got into that mode, so it was hard to switch back to leisurely for the part of the meal where we had no food left. Plus the mostly empty inside was loudly filled with an extremely obnoxious table of 20-something squealing girls. They squealed and squealed throughout our entire meal. I'm glad they were having fun, but they were really, REALLY annoying.\\n\\nIf this had been my first visit, I would never go back. But my first visit was sooo much better (food AND service AND pacing), that I don't know which is the norm. So I'll probably have to have a tie-breaker visit sometime in the future.

I had to sit outside on a bench in the 90 degree heat but I met some nice folks who were also waiting outside so I can't complain about that much.   I was seated around 3:50pm at the counter.  It was a bit of a wait for my food, but the staff -- a very fun, friendly bunch of folks -- were appropriately apologetic about the wait.  I ordered the half fried chicken with broccoli cheese casserole and potato salad as sides.  I would say the sides were not exceptional but the fried chicken was outstanding as expected.  Hot, made to order, crisp - just how you want it.  I'd give it a 9 out of 10.  I was quite full but the woman next to me at the counter (who was quite pretty, very thin, and somehow managed to eat basically two lunches worth of fried fish and nearly all of her four sides) aggressively encouraged me to order the banana pudding, so I caved.  The portion was enormous (I brought half of it back with me to my mini-fridge at the Hilton) and it was so full of cookies (of the nilla wafer type) that it was more the texture of cake than pudding.  Dare I say the banana pudding overshadowed the fried chicken and stole the show?  Well, it did.  10/10!  One more thing I wanted to say: I noticed about four Yelp reviews that mentioned that the neighborhood wasn't very nice or whatever and a few that mentioned they felt out of place as the only white people...but seriously I think these people are over-reacting.  it was fine!  Yes, the staff was 100% black and the customers were probably 90-95% black I did not remotely feel unwelcome or uncomfortable in the environment or the neighborhood as a white person dining alone here.

And if it's your birthday, you get a discount.\\n\\nThe cook goes through the same entertaining act, while cooking your food, that Kobe does. If I didn't know better, I'd think this place was owned by Kobe.\\n\\nI can't complain about any of their food. The ginger salad is tasty and the miso soup. They have my favorite Nigori saki. I always try to get the filet, and it comes out very tender and tasty. We always have leftovers for a couple more meals too, and the filet is still tender after heating it up a couple times at home! If you think the meals cost  too much, the 2-3 meals I could turn it into makes it cheaper.\\n\\nSomething I like, is even if you are a couple there alone, they'll still fire up the grill for you and go through the whole act.

Both were excellent, with a couple of minor annoying flaws.\\n\\nFirst, I had the soft pretzels with two sauces. The tallegio porter fondue was excellent, as was the mustard dip. Just to warn you, the mustard sauce gets a little spicy to the point where I teared up once, so that's something you need to watch out for if you're sensitive to spicy things. I didn't have a problem eating it, but others may need to tread lightly when it comes to the mustard. \\n\\nFinally, I got the seasonal brisket burger with a spicy kimchi slaw and peach aioli, with a side of the famous skinny truffle fries. The brisket was very tender, the slaw helped temper the richness of the brisket, and the peach aioli brought a light sweetness to the sandwich. The truffle fries here are flawless, as many other fans of Rav Pig can attest. \\n\\nI have a minor complaint about the brisket, however. There was a rather large piece of fat that was not trimmed off, and while I love a little fat with brisket, it took up maybe a quarter of the sandwich where there could have been some amazing meaty brisket. \\n\\nOverall, my service was excellent, and the food was wonderful, minus a couple of execution errors.

Ever since I threw tantrums to get Ninja Turtle action figures because the kids in the commercial looked like they were having the time of their life, to buying designer accessories at Gucci because they looked so pretty in GQ, my usually strong-willed personality is perhaps the most malleable to those who would fan the flames of consumer desire. I'm Madison Avenue's dream.\\n\\nI'd never even heard of this place (both this particular store and the chain in general), since when it came to coffee, I had had Starbucks blinders permanently affixed since the mid-90's. I'll pause while any rabidly anti-chain coffee bar purists at Spiderhouse and Epoch take a break from their beverages to boo and hiss at me (I agree with you, though...buy local). But when I got a flyer in the mail from Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf offering a free drink, I figured I'd take them up on their offer. \\n\\nThe other day I had my flyer in hand, on  the way to the coffee shop, only to discover the coupon had expired. It was only good in May. Actually, one day in May. Actually, for only a couple of hours on that particular day in May. Brilliant. I decided to press on anyhow. \\n\\nThe shop was neat, clean, and inviting. I noticed a lack of \\"comfortable\\" seating such as couches and chairs, except for a couple leather chairs in the left corner. Half a dozen customers were already engrossed in conversations...conversations I might add that were a little louder than expected for a coffee shop. Did you know Travis scored a goal during his soccer game this past weekend? No, but thanks to one mother, I do now. \\n\\nThe barista was a sweet girl who took my order consisting of a decaf regular-sized white chocolate latte, a butter croissant, and two chocolate-dipped madelines. I figured if I'm gonna do this, I'm gonna go all the way. \\n\\nThey don't seem to work at the frenzied pace of Starbucks, which was actually kind of pleasant. When you order a drink \\"for here\\", it comes in a tall, heavy glass mug instead of all drinks uniformly being served in a \\"to go\\" cup. She offered to heat up my croissant, which sounded perfectly lovely and is never done at Starbucks. And I was absolutely, positively, unquestionably thrilled they had chocolate dipped madelines, a rare treat I afford myself that Starbucks has unceremoniously discontinued. They're a little higher here ($1 a piece is hardly a steal for a bite or two), but at least I know where to find them if I crave them.\\n\\nI sat at a little table and sipped my coffee. It automatically came topped with whipped cream, and I would have asked for no whip, but had forgotten (extra calories, no real added benefit). Not bad on the whole. The barista asked if I wanted strawberry preserves for my croissant, which sounded like a wonderful idea. The croissant was flaky and especially buttery in the middle, and not at all like the drier version of Starbucks. A+ for the pastry.\\n\\nI noticed they have Wi-Fi enabled, and it seemed a couple of college summer school people were getting together to study. Actually, what it really looked like was that she wanted to study, and he was trying to turn it into a date. If I could have harnessed her chilly reception to *that* idea, we wouldn't have needed air-conditioning. \\n\\nBrowsing over their menu, I came to several conclusions that would separate C & TL over their competitors. It looked like they had more extensive breakfast options, so much so that it could easily be an alternative breakfast spot as opposed to other fast food venues (they have a drive-thru, as well). Their lemon and blueberry oatmeal parfait looked especially delicious. They also seemed to offer more emphasis on tea than others, where tea is sometimes an afterthought. Here, they have almost as many tea selections as they do coffee. They also had several handy, informative pamphlet guides for both tea and coffee that I picked up on the way out.\\n\\nFun fact I just found out from a friend: Nolan Ryan and family own the Central Texas Franchise. Interesting, and good to know. \\n\\nIt's a cute little place. Check it out if you feel so inclined.

We were hungry and understood that there was food.  On our way in after checking I.D.'s we asked the security guard what he gets for food and he recommended the fish tacos and a burger. ****Food here is good**** The menu is small but that's understandable as the focus is alcohol sales. I think this is effective in maintaining more quality food in this way. The portions are filling but not overly so.  We thanked the security guard for his recommendation on our way out. I like the staff. I only saw men, but they were all pretty lax, chill, without being rude or condescending, yet not overly friendly either. I appreciated that.\\n\\nNow here's the interesting bit:\\n\\nThe crowd here when we arrived before the hip hop began was something out of The Hills.  As another yelper mentioned...definitely vapid, SoCal-Hollywood beauties in cocktail attire and preppy cargo short, polo wearing, man bun bros. We were so confused as the venue was much like a vegas sports bar with colorful lights, TVs, and fancy stadium style bleachers. Outside, the patio was nice, and if you get in a long line to go upstairs, there are a few tables and chairs that look over nothing special. Strung Edison bulb lights are always nice. Then, when the hip hop began it got stranger. The hood started to arrive; Men in dashiki shirts, women in their Jordans, people arriving in corn rows and bucket hats who had no business wearing corn rows or bucket hats. It was a clusterfck of cultures. It was interesting as the socialites sway-danced along side the walls and the brothas got down on the floor.\\n\\nAlso, drinks are disgustingly warm and mostly taste like water and medicine.

When they first opened we came here weekly, and Mickey the manager was terrific--warm, friendly, and ran a tight ship. Since he moved on, the Corner has steadily declined. Now they're chronically understaffed. Tables sit dirty for 10+ minutes at a time--and I'm talking like 1/2 the restaurant, 8-10 of them. Ordering at the counter can run at least 10 minutes or more, and then a wait after that for food. Today, the gal at the register couldn't even wait on people and take orders, because she was the only one taking phone orders!! This is now hands down THE MOST UNPROFESSIONAL eating environment in Hillsboro; fortunately the food is still good, so that's probably what keeps people coming in. But today my friends walked in the door at 10:30 and easily did not receive food for close to half an hour--and that's just not acceptable for a walk-up restaurant.

I mean, what happened to customer service!?\\n\\nIt all started when ordering drinks. It took probably 15-20 mins before we had water or the drinks (wine!) we ordered. Then we had to actually flag down the waitress to even order food! Then when the food actually came out, 4 of the 6 orders were incorrect (one actually didn't even get delivered). For my specific dish, I ordered the Paella Barlata, but when I had it set down in front of me I mentioned I had the large and not the small (which she was giving me) and she looked at me and said \\"Can that just be ok? I mean I'll give you a beer or something.\\"  I just agreed to have it, but not the beer because I'm allegoric to beer. At this point I didn't want to give her anymore stress. I also tried to confirm with the waitress it was the dish I ordered. She nodded and walked away. After taking a couple bites, I knew it was incorrect. When I asked her about it she agreed that was the wrong dish and took it away. After waiting another 20 mins for the re-fire, it came out. She said to the table, so that's everything. But we were still missing a dish for one more person...but it again never came out. Once we were done we had to flag the waitress down for the tab, which then took 25 mins to get resolved because a bottle of wine and beer where included that we never ordered. And for being the 2nd night it was open, not once did the manager/owner come around to ask if everything was ok.\\n\\nI'm sure you get the gist, it was a poor experience.

Just one visit was sufficient to see that, although they've spent a lot of money renovating the place, they haven't cared enough about putting the right people in the kitchen. \\n\\nThe El Guapo: Bread was really bad, mushy with no crisp exterior. Like the cheapest of hot dog white bread buns. Not sufficient consistency to hold the fillings, which were also pretty grim. Supposed to be chicken and chorizo, but the sausage was nowhere to be found. Flavor was bland and the texture was almost runny. Impossible to know what we were eating, but neither of us got past the first few bites.\\n\\nRoasted Mushrooms and Whipped Brie: Revolting. Clearly reheated, but still lukewarm.

I have to go 20 minutes after to remind them of my order that I paid for, then they stare at me and say oh, ok and they never apologize and of-course the order is cold because it has been sitting for awhile. I remember the only time this happened in Seattle, the barista apologized, prepared a new order for me and gave my money back with a sincere apology. I think its the location that they rely on here.

Our waitress was nice, but kept socializaing with \\"the townies\\" and not paying much attention to us.

We did manage to get another helping of chips and salsa while we waited for our entrees.  Friend got chicken and rice, which honestly didn't look that appetizing; it was a weird orange-y color but my friend ate it.  I got 'mexican tacoes', which was basically four tortillas (they doubled up the tortillas- 2 per taco) with beef, about 3 tiny pieces of tomato and day-old guacamole.  The tortillas were corn and tasted like cardboard and the beef was pitch black and not really recognizable as beef.  The dish didn't come with any sides (whereas all the other dishes did), so I ordered french fries which were surprisingly good.  The next day, I also had some tummy issues, which seems to be the norm after reading some of the reviews from this place.  It wasn't even that busy, which was surprising because there was a Bruins play-off game starting at 8pm.\\n\\nEven though this place flaunts authentic costa rican cuisine, I think they're really missing the mark with this place....

I can only describe them as little league fries. Under seasoned, boring, and bland.

But we did walk in the front door right onto the wooden dance floor where there was very loud, very live (it's Austin!) flamenco music and dancing. The performance was about an hour or so and entertaining. The crowd was also very into it. It was so loud I had to put my earplugs in! \\n\\nThe decor is very warm and inviting & service was attentive and friendly. I was curious about the sangria, and our server offered a taste of it. I found it too syrupy sweet, but she then was able to describe an assortment of wines and I loved the white wine she picked out for me, based on it's fruit notes, and the fact that since the vineyard is by the sea in Spain, it has a hint of sea salt taste. Yum! \\n\\nI ordered the mixed greens salad with was only topped with an assortment of green olives and a sherry vinagrette. However, I really liked it and it tasted very fresh and light. I was really looking forward to the vegetarian paella (SO hard to find), & unfortunately I was a bit disappointed. It tasted very... Asian. It was not yellow or spiced with saffron as is typical of paella- it had a dark brown soy sauce tasting dressing over it and shitakke mushrooms in it. It was not a bad dish, but it was certainly not authentic or what I was hoping for.\\n\\nMy friend got the chicken and mashed potatoes with mushrooms, & as he was very hungry when we arrived- he was not pleased that the chicken took SO long to come out! He was two servings of tea and 4 complimentary bread plates down before it finally arrived. I know tapas are served as they are ready, but it seemed slow, even for meat. In the end it was a basic plate, but he enjoyed his meal.\\n\\nI am not sure I will return for food, but more so their happy hour drinks specials and the atmosphere."},{"name":"Rofini's Pizza and Subs","address":"544 South St","city":"Westerville","stars":"3.5","text":"Best Pizza You Will Ever Have.  This place is a Westerville institution that is peerless in its quality and deliciousness.  \\n\\nI have traveled extensively throughout the United States and abroad, trying the best pizzas I can find.  From Lombardi's, Grimaldi's, Patsy's, and John's in NYC to Lou Malnati's, Pizzeria Uno, Giordano's, and Gino's East in Chicago.  I've had top-rated pizzas in Denver, Seattle, San Francisco, Los Angeles, San Diego, Phoenix, Atlanta, Orlando, DC, Boston, Vancouver, and most cities in between.  With multiple visits to Naples, Rome, Florence, and many places throughout Italy, I consider my pizza knowledge to be considerable.\\n\\nThere is no doubt in my mind that Rofinis is the best pizza you will ever give yourself the pleasure of eating. The quality of the ingredients, the taste and texture of the sauce, incredible dough, delicious toppings, it all combines to form an experience unlike any other. \\n\\nOpen from 4:00-11:00, 7 days a week, for pick-up and delivery.  You can also try their uncooked pizzas (get a pizza stone and cook it in your oven and it's pretty close to the real thing) and their awesome subs.\\n\\nMy friends from around the US specifically ask for a trip to Rofinis when they come and visit Columbus.\\n\\nI heard a story once about a guy on his death bed, who had been eating Rofinis for 30+ years.  For his last meal, unable to chew solid food, he requested that a Rofinis be put in a blender so he could 'drink' it.

All plates were good, a few were excellent, but nothing caught me as inspiring or innovative. Do not let that last line deter you from visiting this fine restaurant experience; taste and opinion are subjective, and to be honest some diners don't enjoy experiencing flavors and textures they are not used to, all they are seeking is an excellently executed meal with flavors they are familiar with...Castagna will certainly deliver for this palate. First things first, the service was great, on par with a Michelin starred restaurant...napkin promptly folded after leaving the table, courses held and properly served at temperature once all patrons are back at the table (no long wait between courses), silverware and glasses promptly swapped between courses, and servers were attentive but not shoulder surfing. Improvements?...yes, they are minor, but I would say tucking each patron into their seat, their chopsticks (which they introduced in the past week) should sit \\"snuggly\\" into their holder/base, also alignment of the chopsticks were not proper (should be aligned vertically for Chinese with the base toward the user with the tips away, or for Japanese horizontal with the base toward the right and tips left), finally it would be nice to offer a wet towel with their amuse bouche to clean your fingers with. Yes, I know it's nitpicking and not necessary for a great experience, but these small details separate the good from the great, and and the great from the legendary. Food wise, amuse bouche was good, the fresh produce shined through in the beet dishes, the carrot \\"wonton\\" dish could have been excellent (personal taste) if a flash torch was used to add a tinge of crispiness to the wonton. Highlights..lobster with bisque was divine, expertly source dungeness crab rich in flavor and texture, foie gras with black berry (umami heaven, generous portion , but would be better served in measured balance-per-bite sized portions , rather than self served imo), Kona Kanpachi with gilee and tangerine, trout was the best I've ever had, perfectly smoked and the potato souffl√© excellently matched the wine, beef culotte was perfectly cooked with top notch veggies (note: this is staple dish in most high end restaurants, so they nailed it, but it's hard to give them extra credit for it), one of the best lemon merengue deserts I've had (again, a staple in most high end restaurants, but they deserve credit for this one due to the flavor and balance).

When the Honey spare ribs came out, I was surprised the amount of meat they gave. It must have been over a pound of meat. All the dishes came with unlimited rice.

AT tried a different one and experienced the same thing. At this point, we are both massively frustrated with both the rock-like glutinous rice exterior and ice cream.

When scoping out places to eat, I noticed that Austin now has several tapas options, so we opted to try this one out.  The last tapas I'd eaten in Austin were at Fino, which wasn't very good the times that I went, and which I believe closed a year or so ago.\\n\\nSo, the upshot is, we were looking forward to tapas in our old stomping grounds!  Things started out well; my sparkling spritzer was herbal, fruity, and a little bitter, his sangria was tasty, and our cheese plate and gazpacho arrived promptly.  After that, though, our server became more and more scarce, and we could see her doing side-work by the line.  That's fine, but it's no reason to ignore your last couple of tables.  We sat for a good 15 minutes waiting for our final tapas plates to be cleared, and then waited a while longer for dessert menus.  No offers for a coffee warm-up or a check-in on dessert itself were forthcoming.\\n\\nHere's a run-down of the food without regard to the good devolving into absent service. \\n\\nA step above:\\n--Mussels with sofrito:  these were scrumptious, served in a lovely broth that I couldn't help but dip the very good house bread into.\\n--Almond tarta:  this twist on a traditional Spanish almond cake was divine:  just sweet enough with a dense texture served with a blueberry compote and a light semifreddo.  I have a feeling that desserts may be a strength.  \\n\\nOn cue:\\n--Gazpacho:  this was fine, if a little salty.  I always like versions with almonds, and the vegetable flavor was good. \\n--Cheese plate:  this was served with some quince paste and fig jam.  The cheeses were all solid, but only a couple were truly delicious.\\n--Tinned baby squid:  these were interesting to try.  They were a bit fishy for me, but my fellow diner liked them a lot.  \\n--Brandada:  I cannot not order something with bacalao when having tapas, and this version was solid, though again a bit heavy on the added salt (outside of the salt cod itself).  \\n\\nMisstep:  \\n--Lobster and grapefruit salad:  this was far too acerbic, and I know it is supposed to be sour.  I mean, I make a version of this salad myself.

They have plenty of seating with some comfy armchairs and I saw plenty of people who brought their laptops to take advantage of the multitudinous outlets. \\n\\nThe drinks (my party and I got: jasmine milk tea with boba, black milk tea with lychee jelly, thai milk tea with lychee jelly, and thai milk tea with boba) all tasted subpar as the thai milk tea was very thin and didn't have the richness that is generally associated with it. Actually, same goes with all the drinks, they were all quite watered down. The boba was not good, being chewy on the outside but hard on the inside. The fish pastries that we got (you can only get a max of 2 flavours in 1 order of 12) were a lot smaller than I expected, but they were pretty yummy. \\n\\nBack to the interior: although it was pretty, it was very echo-y inside. I wouldn't say there were a lot of people there, but it sounded like there were because everyone's voices were amplified. It was quite loud compared to the amount of people that were actually there. \\n\\nLastly, the service: the girl that was our cashier was nice enough but didn't seem to know the workings well because we asked how many toppings we could get in a drink and she turned back to read the menu for a while then turned back and said \\"I think it's only one.\\" Not very assuring tone, let me just say. \\n\\nDespite having moderately high expectations for Caf√© Mozart, unfortunately I have to give it 2 stars."},{"name":"The Solo Club","address":"2110 NW Raleigh St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"While I didn't try the food, or see the bill, I'm willing to give this place a four star due to the house-made cola.

Also, I was dumb and wore flip flops; one fell off and almost hit a teenager below me.  Woops :(.\\n\\nAnyway, my one complaint is that I wish they catered more to the sizable adult crowd coming here.  Our laser tag teams were usually ~50% kids, and zapping kids isn't much fun.

The lettuce was fairly large sizes that were hard to eat, not very fresh due to the brown spots and obvious bug bites in the leaves and did  not appear to be well washed prior to serving.  The parmesan tuile tasted musty and could be either attributed to a lack of freshness or a poor cheese quality.

My husband and I made our reservation at 830 and then had to push it back to 930 however when we arrived at the restaurant we were asked to wait at the bar while a table cleared up as it was at full capacity. We took that as a good sign and grabbed one of the few empty chairs at the bar and I had a glass of delicious fruity sangria which packed a nice punch while my dh tried a Spanish ale. We both had a nice little buzz going when we were seated at our table about 15 min later. For the meal we ordered the Barlata paella, Gambas ajillo (garlic shrimp) and lamb empanadas. I listed them in order of deliciousness. Paella was awesome the large was good size for 2 ppl and filled w savory chorizo mussel and clams. It was soooo good! The Gambas were well seasoned and I can see how some people may think it salty but we loved it. The empanadas I felt were more like a meaty samosa type pastry and just ok but the green sauce on the side was good. We finished off the meal w chocolate mousse and the pear tart. Loved both of them. For our 15 min wait in the beginning we were comp'd 2 glasses of proseco from the host. Awesome place and awesome choice for a couple celebrating their 5th anniversary.

They cook the tapioca decently so it's not too soft or too chewy. They're accommodating about half sugar and less ice (or whatever specific proportion you may request). I tend to shy away from the milk tea flavors because I'm under the impression that they use milk powders rather than fresh milk, though I may be mistaken. \\n\\nAs it is a drink store, the noise levels certainly go up as order demand increases.

I get that some places have smaller entrees and it's expected that you order more sides and starters to go with it, but usually a server will suggest that if that's the case. Most places I just order an entree because there's always more than enough with that - so I was just making that assumption here.

The real draw for me here is that they sell Bubbie's mochi ice cream!! The best mochi ice cream in the states by far! They even have li hing mango (for my Hawai'i people). As for the main attraction...They offer regular milk teas (black, jasmine, green), flavor-infused milk teas (blueberry, mango, raspberry, and 23 other options), and flavored teas (all of their normal options, made for those who don't want milk). I highly recommend the taro, blueberry, and Thai milk tea flavors. The jasmine milk tea was underwhelming for me, tasting like a watery milk rather than a milk tea. The boba, while small, are generous - though I've found the amount to be a bit inconsistent, depending on who made the drink and the time of day. (PRO TIP: Go late at night when they're trying to finish up the day's batch of tapioca!) They have a multitude of options for spicing up your drink, from adding extra pearls to subbing tapioca out for lychee, bursting, gel-filled pearls, or mango jelly pieces. Honestly, the extra boba isn't worth the extra dollar, unless you want more tapioca than drink. Spend your money upgrading to the more \\"exotic options.\\" Also note, BTS is cash-only and they no longer carry/honor reward punch cards."},{"name":"Sushi Katana","address":"4192 Conroy Rd, Ste 103","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"(7/27/2018)  Got the coworkers to bring me back the Maki San Roll Combo, pretty simple, three rolls:  escolar, salmon, and tuna.

This new restaurant has a lot nicer atmosphere than the downtown version, with table service and a sleek interior, not to mention a much larger menu.\\n\\nThe patacon:  It's a flattened, fried plantain topped with succulent beef and other taco-type toppings, plus Arepazo's signature cilantro sauce.  The whole thing comes together perfectly, with the savory beef and sweet plantain, the spicy sauce and tangy banana peppers.  Just perfect.  My wife feels the same about the arepas that I feel about the patacon.  We also had the sopas (very, very good) and the potato tapas, which were advertised as potatoes with lime and cilantro.  I couldn't detect any lime or cilantro, but that's not to say they weren't good, if you like the taste of potatoes.

I realized that these were pan fried and were sitting on a thin fried sheet and so next time I broke off this sheet instead of ripping them off the sheet. They say to poke them and let the broth out into your spoon, drink the broth and then dip the dumpling in the sauce and eat the rest.  I found that I actually preferred biting into it (over the spoon to catch residual broth) with the broth inside... the taste is a bit better. I did not care for the sauce as much... the dumpling with the broth was super tasty on its own but if you drink the broth first and are then left with just the dumpling- you probably need the sauce.  They were great. The pan friend dumplings by the way take half an hour (they warn you). I also got the Shanghai fried noodles with chicken and let me just say that this is the only way that I want my noodle to be from now on. The sauce was so amazing and flavorful! My friend ordered the deep fried chicken with Sichuan hot pepper. This chicken also had amazing flavor to it.

The tacos are a bit small, but two for someone my size is enough so that you aren't hungry but haven't stuffed yourself so full that you're about to food coma the rest of the night away. Between the two, the steak was my favorite. It was cooked perfectly and had a hefty amount of meat in the taco itself. Although my tacos were both a star worthy, my friend ordered the buffalo chicken and wasn't able to finish it because there was wayyy too much blue cheese on it.
