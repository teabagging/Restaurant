Every cup is poured over and fresh with a trusty Chemex beaker. Mmm.\\n\\nSecond, they serve an abundance of strategically picked beers -- a healthy mix of local and national microbrews.\\n\\nThird, breakfast/brunch at Frank is to die for. I had the Texas Benedict a couple weeks ago and was beside myself with glee. It was, to put it simply, phenomenal. The foundation of the dish is a cheesy biscuit, topped with a half-pound of pulled pork. The next layer is a fried egg, which completely blankets the pork. Then, to top it off, is a homemade hollandaise sauce and a jalepeno. Accompanying all of that was a bacon-infused Tito's bloody mary. Soooo goooood.

Upon reading the place mat, you can see that the Union Oyster House (UOH) has been a restaurant since 1826, and as such it is America's oldest restaurant. When we were in Boston last week, we hit the UOH not once but three times. Just a note, ask for a table upstairs if you exceed the space allotted for the booths downstairs. Those must has been built for people who were much smaller than the average couple today, as they were a little tight when we tried them out. \\n\\nOn our first trip to the UOH, we stopped in after landing in town on an overnight flight in from Sacramento. We were bone tired and looking for a hearty meal to nap on. My husband and I both had bowls of the best clam chowder we ever tasted, along with a raw sampler platter of cherry-stone clams and oysters and a couple of salads. Let's just say this... Boston is not known for their salads. The clam chowder however was awesome and held the standard for the remainder of our visit. It was loaded with cream, butter, tender potatoes, and oh yeah clams, tons of them. The raw platter was good but really pricey at $12.95 for only six pieces of shellfish. \\n\\nThe best thing we had at the UOH hands down was the lobsters. We stopped in for two consecutive nights during the week we visited and I had a 2 pound-er broiled one day, and steamed the next. It was expensive since they were out of season, but so damn tasty to this west coaster. It comes with a starch of either boiled potatoes, rice pilaf, or fries, and of course it comes with a ton of butter. It was awesome. The meat was sweet, and unlike anything I have ever had on the west coast. We did however add a side of grilled vegetables to share, as being from CA we felt out of balance without a little veggie action.

The main entr√©es we ordered were fried crispy shrimp, grilled salmon, pan-seared haddock and lobster scampi. I don't even know where to start. The crispy shrimp was the only edible food. The pan-seared haddock was way over cooked and very dry. At least the sides were fine. Please know this was a $28 entr√©e! The grilled salmon was served COLD. I looked closely and the grill marks on the fish looked fake. The baked potato that accompanied the shrimp and salmon dishes were under-cooked and had to be sent back. The lobster scampi plate also had over-cooked, chewy lobster. Also, I noticed the majority of food lacked seasoning... like salt. PLEASE DON'T WASTE YOUR HARD-EANRED MONEY HERE. THERE ARE SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER PLACES TO EAT SEAFOOD.\\n\\nSERVICE: The waitress was late in her years but just as feisty as others half her age. She had a lot of personality. The poor thing was over-worked and had too many tables. The service started out great and then suddenly deteriorated throughout meal service. As the night progressed, the less we saw her. We waited quite a long time for our meal. We had a feeling the grilled salmon was fired-up before the rest of our meals and left sitting to go cold. She did replace the under-cooked potatoes and took the salmon dish off our bill but she couldn't save the horrible cooking. \\n\\nOPINION: DON'T GO HERE. It's not worth the money or the historical atmosphere."},{"name":"Launderette","address":"2115 Holly St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Update to a previous review.  Had a chance to eat dinner on 9/29/16.\\n\\nSome of the best of what Austin has to offer - innovative, hip, flavorful, and approachable.  Not much more I can say than this is in the same class as Odd Duck, Emmer & Rye, and Josephine's.  \\n\\nNotes of Summary:\\n\\n1. They have updated their waiting areas so you can have a drink and wait. Still no reservations but no where near the experience as before.  The cocktails are very good and it is not what it was before.\\n2. The new hostess staff makes a difference.  They have a super inviting team that was very pleasent and accommodating.   They have probably heard the news on the previous people at the front desk.\\n3. Service - Hillary was amazing and had actual opinions on where to steer the meal.  You will need to lean on them the first time because it is a different sort of menu with appetizers, toasts, grilled items, sides and mains.  Like a sushi chef, let them steer you towards what is excellent that night.\\n4. Food - hard to tell what will be good when you go because they change a lot but the Crudo, the Hanger Steak, and Short Rib sound like consistent items - they were both amazing.  Highly recommended. More:\\n- Crudo - Different than Uchi but that is point - amazing flavors and some heat.\\n- French fries - surprisingly good and we ordered as an after thought.\\n- Hanger Steak - quality meat and amazing sauce\\n- Short Rib - Different than Second Kitchen's (this is more Asian style) but as far as the style the best I have had in town.\\n- Branzino - Whole fish deboned and perfectly cooked with a butter and herb sauce (think almondine)\\n5. Drink - Quality cocktails (not an after thought) and good but not great wine list.  They have some really cool stuff but due to limited storage, it is not an extensive list.  Might want to call and see if they do a corkage fee if you have something really special in mind.  We found the wine to be really good and had a Cab that we had never heard of before that was solid.\\n\\nTip - if you don't want to wait in line for dinner you can go eat there for Lunch.  I have a few friends that say the wait on any day but Friday is not bad.  Plus I heard it is one of the better burgers in town (about 50%) of the people around us dinner were having it to share."},{"name":"Am√©lie's French Bakery & Caf√©","address":"840 Marietta St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"One word......

Found this little spot on my trip back in 2010 thanks to my friends who live here. I was on the hunt for a spicy cocktail. They told me to go to two places. A place right around the corner from here ( Eeck) and this! But warned us about the crazy long wait. \\n\\nFirst time around I came here purely for their cocktail but being it was happy hour, I squeezed in the grilled octopus and grilled beef hearts. They were pretty divine! I was bummed I couldn't fit in more food. The bar area can get extremely busy and crowded. It's crazy how small seating can get in the bar area. Well that was then!\\n\\nI've went back plethora of times since my initial visit way back then! I've done several happy hours plus dinners here. The food has yet to disappoint! And their Sacsayhauman cocktail! Oh so tasty!! Now how many restaurants can give you that happiness time after time? Consistency is key as well as execution of their dishes and great service.\\n\\nDishes I love-\\n **Grilled Octopus - serve top of mash potatoes and other veggie tasty combo pile. \\n** Fish Ceviche- tasty freshness!\\n*Grilled beef hearts - this comes with a really tasty sauces. I love the red one the most since it;s the spiciest one.\\n* Oysters with salsa topping - perfect\\n*Scallops entree - 3 perfect scallops! It is amazing, finger licking good.\\n* Arroz con Pato - a very filling duck dish. I love duck! And this was done just right. Really pretty duck breast with rice and veggies. yumm!\\n\\n* Corderito De Los Andes -  Rack of Lamb - a little too heavy for me. But I still like it. And those peruvian potatoes are to die for!\\n\\n*Palta Rellena De Cangrejo - avocado stuffed with crab and poached prawn on top! \\n\\n** Pescado al rocoto y kion - new fav dish!! Roasted  fish topped with ginger and served over shiitake mushrooms with bok choy in a smoked pork broth and quinoa fried rice! Yes quinoa fried rice has been my new thing and I totally love this version.\\n**Bistec novoandino - filet mignon, grilled to order, topped with oyster mushroom salsa criolla and black beer sauce!!!  Serve with humita and a saut√© of fingerling potatoe.  YUmmmm!\\n\\nAnd this is the one place where you would want to order dessert even if you are full!\\nDo order - Alfajores and peruvian truffles! It comes out so beautiful, you might almost feel bad eating it. And their creme brulee is also fantastic.\\n\\nOverall, this place has been consistently amazing for a good 4 years. They are always adding new dishes to the menu which I appreciate. But they also keep the classic favorite ones. Definitely make reservation even if you plan to come during happy hour. I've dined here in all three levels. The bottom is cute and casual, middle/ the main floor is more classy and upstairs is romantic. Make reservation, show up, listen to the music, watch the kitchen in action while you sip your cocktail. And proceed to eating!!

Friday night was that chance. Went on a nice double date to Rossi and spent a lot of time hanging out at the bar drinking and talking while waiting on our table. Rossi on a Friday night is packed so be warned and try to be patient. The bartenders were amazingly friendly and we chatted while they poured their drinks and joked around. Their cocktail list is impressive but rather expensive for my liking so I stuck with beer and thankfully my date did as well. \\n\\nOnce we were seated I didn't even look at the menu since I knew the burger was in my future. Our waitress was the total opposite of the bartenders and was not very friendly and was very short with us. Oh well it happens. 3 of the 4 of us ordered the burger and my date got a pizza. Thankfully the other waitresses there refilled our drinks and were really nice. \\n\\nThe food came quickly and let me tell you. My friend may be correct. The Rossi burger is thick and beefy and the toppings are fresh. It comes with a pesto mayo (I think) and it puts the burger over the edge into a relm of its own. I ordered mine medium/medium well and it was more rare for my liking but still incredible. The fries were also to die for but most the time handcut fries are. I had a few bites of the pizza and it was good but I've had better....recently (mmmm Bono). \\n\\nThe bills came and $9 burgers are a nice surprise (I didn't look at the menu remember) The pizza was also on the cheap side. We all paid but when the waitress came back she handed me my slip to sign since I paid with my card but my friends didn't get their change. She had paid with $40 on a $30 something bill. We finally found our waitress and they got their change but she didn't get a bill along with it and she didn't remember the exact amount so she wasn't sure how much to tip and she thinks she didn't get the correct change. \\n\\nEven with the crappy service at our table I would say over all the service was great and I hope our server just had a rough night but with better service table side this may have been a 5 star.

I understand that this spot caters mostly to the tourists, but you can't turn down eating in the oldest restaurant in America, as so they state, which I believe, because their decor and furnishings are probably as old as the resto and a couple of their servers too, but I digress.\\n\\nI went on a Sunday for lunch so the resto wasn't packed at all.  Upon getting seated, it took about 10-minutes before my server acknowledged me and when she did, I made sure to place my order at the same time.  For starters, I ordered their Lobster Bisque for $6.95 and for my meal, I ordered the Seafood Cake combo, which came with a Crab Cake, Lobster Cake and Fish Cake for $17.95.\\n\\nMy Lobster Bisque was creamy and had slight pieces of Lobster inside.  The bisque was flavorful but just good, I've had much better Lobster Bisque elsewhere.  Upon finishing my bisque, my server grabbed my bowl and it took another 10-12 minutes for my meal to come out.  When it did come out, I was slightly disappointed.  There were the three cakes, but they were the size of half of a mini cupcake, sitting on a huge bed greens and roasted potatoes.  The food was alright, the cakes didn't taste quite fresh, almost similar to what you could get at Costco or something, which I hope wasn't the case.  So, I finished my plate with much more to be desired.\\n\\nI wanted to pay my bill and I felt like my server was avoiding my area.  It wasn't just me either, a couple other tables near me were making similar remarks about the slow service.  So again, when she came with the check, I handed her my card, sight unseen.\\n\\nWhen all was said and done, my solo lunch took an hour and 45-minutes.

I love this place for so many reasons. I'm normally that person who goes into a restaurant and orders what she already knows she likes. I tend to play it safe during my first visit to a new restaurant. I remember staring with despair at the itty-bitty menu at Dynamic Dish the first time I visited because of all the things I didn't like - pears, tofu, pumpkin seeds, etc. It seemed as though everything on the menu was tainted with something I didn't like, so I settled for the item I disliked the least, and it turned out to  be so incredibly delicious. It was a grilled cheese sandwich (unfortunately I can't remember what kind of cheese it was) that was also stuffed with pear slices and a leafy green - maybe spinach? One of the people sitting at the communal table with me shared some of her beans (which I couldn't tell you what they are but I do recall the waitress described them as similar to black-eyed peas), which I thought was great - because it shows you the type of people Dynamic Dish attracts, and because the beans were delish. Anyways, I remember with every bite just being wowed by the fact that I loved the seemingly strange combination of tastes. I went back a second time this past Wednesday and once again ordered something I \\"didn't\\" like, a rosemary tofu wrap with shredded carrots, and I must say that it was the first time in my life that I had flavorful tofu (which I had always been wary of because of its blandness). Today I had their Turkish pizza - topped with kale, feta and garlic - and it was  everything I could hope for. In spite of having a pretty thin crust, the pizza left me stuffed (which I still am three hours later). And I loved the fact that my hands wound up covered in flour from the bottom of the pizza  - it just screams freshly made to me.\\n\\nThe continually changing menu is another thing that really works in their favor - I feel justified in eating here often because it's always something different. \\n\\nUltimately I love Dynamic Dish because the chef makes me love foods I don't love, and it's even better because the foods are good for you. If I had to complain about anything, it would be the fact that the water glasses are really tiny. Also, although the restaurant isn't expensive for what you get, it isn't cheap enough (for me on my budget) to order multiple items from the menu (which I'd love to do).

We had the frutti di mare, the veal meatballs, some bruschetta, and a standard margherita pizza. Gelato and chocolate Cassata for dessert.\\n\\nService -- also excellent. Non-hovering, but great presence. And, the explanation of the menu options was done in a friendly and welcoming manner, when it would've been very easy to be pretentious. *cough* Frasca *cough*.\\n\\nThe interior ambiance needs some fine-tuning:\\n\\n1. Overkill on the branding. \\"Pizzeria Locale\\" was plastered everywhere: plates, sugar packets, etc. It became sort of a game during our meal to locate every product in the restaurant that was sporting its brand name.\\n\\n2. Fluorescent lighting was downright awful. I see others have commented on this as well. It gives the restaurant a food court feel that it simply doesn't deserve. Admittedly, *some* incandescent bulbs are now being phased out, and fluorescents are in vogue, but they're simply a very poor match for the ambience. There are a million other options. With all the money poured into Pizzeria Locale's equipment, they could even have some custom bulbs made. There may be some trendy \\"green\\" narrative at work here, but, thankfully, there was no self-righteous mantra in the menu about how they're saving the Earth, one light bulb at a time.\\n\\n3. Slightly overcrowded. We sat at a two-top; there was a party of 6 on our left, and 3 people squeezed into another two-top on our right. They need to remove one or two tables, just like Oak needs to do after their rebuild. There's a fine line between bustling and overcrowded.\\n\\n4. Appending the Frasca wine list to their selected pizza-oriented wine list might be pushing it a bit.

We asked if she could do the prix-fixe menu while we got the tasting menu, but the server said that the kitchen would become disorganized.

But the snide senior citizen did manage to bring us a cocktail menu where we could order $14 hummus and chips.

The old man and I made a special stop in Portland on the way since we'd seen this place on the food network and aforementioned man was pretty excited about the combinations of bacon, coco puffs, peanut butter, and mango he could get on fried dough. We waited in the cold line that stretched around the corner of the building, looking on yelp for what doughnut we should order once we got inside. \\n\\nNow, I should mention that I'm not really adventurous when it comes to doughnuts. I don't like peanut butter, jelly filled (when the jelly-dough ratio is too skewed in the jelly direction) or maple flavored doughnuts. So the \\"quirky\\" factor of this place is mostly lost on me. I do appreciate a good doughnut, but I don't need all the fanfare. When we finally got inside the front door, I really liked the way they had decorated the maybe 8'x10' ordering area - the art was funky and not your average doughnut shop decor. But when we got to the counter, the girl taking orders was really brusque. I get it, when you have to deal with hundreds of people shoving their way to your counter for 8 hours of the day, you're probably gonna be a little snotty. But this had more the vibe of someone who felt like I should have had the menu memorized, even though most of the ingredients weren't listed under the doughnut names on the tiny-printed menu above the counter. Sorry I didn't research the formula of the Memphis Mafia before I made the trip! I felt rushed and unsure of what to order, so I ended up getting just a plain chocolate glazed. Lame.\\n\\nThe doughnut was okay, a little stale. My boyfriend's Triple Chocolate Penetration had really stale coco puffs on top, but that didn't stop him from scarfing it down. All in all, it was a decent place for doughnuts, probably better if your tastes call for marshmallow glaze and froot loops. For me, I'll save the 10 hour drive and stick to Stan's."},{"name":"Two Urban Licks","address":"820 Ralph McGill Blvd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"A great \\"hip\\" place to see and be seen.

A nice alternative in my opinion.\\n\\n-sides are hit-or-miss for the ones I've tried. The Cheesy-Poofs were a little odd (texture-wise) for me. The onion rings were just ok (a bit greasy, but flavorful). The fried pickles were, again, nothing really special, but ok. The fries are much better now that they've switched to crinkle-cut.

But I'm piling on any way. I've eaten some other mediocre pizza since moving here from NYC and I think that it bears mention that I come from the Lombardi's school when we are talking New York Pizza. And the thing that made it for me in Lombardi's was clam pizza. Sounds a bit weird, you think? No way. It is amazing. And allow me to digress a moment about the other key feature of Lombardi's: a coal fired oven that creates a black char on the bottom of the pizza. This subtle element is so fragile that extra char would make the pizza taste burned. But the masters create and sustain this perfect balance.\\n\\nSo back in Austin .. imagine my surprise when I strolled past Home Slice and noticed that clam pizza is a featured item! Sure the clams are canned. Many purist don't even eat the clams at Lombardi's or Mario Batali's Otto. Mario refers to the clams as \\"little snots\\". The goal is to infuse the pie with clam essence. Obviously, fresh clam juice is another level. But a finely made, hand tossed pizza with fresh cheese dressed with clams within walking distance of the home and the heart of 04? Amazing! And the walk-up windows is a nice touch. Does not have the same \\"by the sea\\" crust of some of the New Jersey boardwalk pies .. but whadyawant? This place is a must.

That being said, it gets a ton of traffic from this status alone, but it's also a pretty solid restaurant (ranges from solid to excellent depending on what you get). The oysters are obviously the highlight and if you're a big half-shell fan you could sit at the beautiful stone oyster bar downstairs all day and slurp oysters. I'm in love with oysters so this is obviously a huge hit for me, and the oysters tip this one from four to five stars. They're fresh, taste great and the oyster bar staff are also the best people working in the place. Sitting at that bar is really a unique experience. If you don't sit down at the oyster bar here at some point, you're surely missing out on the full experience. The rest of the restaurant is a good sampling of what I'd call \\"New England seafood\\" and you can get a respectable lobster, lobster roll or clam chowder with no complaints. This is a seafood lover's place for sure and if you're a vegetarian or don't like seafood the Union Oyster House is not for you. You're sure to see lots of tourists here in the summer and you should try and get a seat downstairs (ask about the Kennedy Booth if you want) because downstairs is surely better than upstairs here. You'll get better service and a much better atmosphere. Either way, the Union Oyster House is a classic, distinctly old-fashioned and a place you should probably try to eat at at least once.

Ten Tables is my favorite restaurant in the city, so I know these cats will get it together in time.\\n\\nThe burgers are good, but not great.  The beef is high quality, and packed with seasonings which makes it quite tasty.  But because it is packed with seasonings that need to cook, the burger must be cooked to medium.  This sucks, as everyone knows that cooking the rare out of beef gets rid of the beef taste...and all natural  grass fed beef often has a delicious natural taste.  That said though, the overall flavor is good.  Their po' boy needs some work though.  I got the shrimp one-the shrimp are way too big.  You get like four on the whole thing, which makes it tough to eat and sort of flavorless, especially since you don't get very much of the tasty remoulade.  The truffle fries are delicious, but not enough so that I would go out of my way.  The mushroom poutine isn't sloppy enough for my tastes.  Lot's of dry fries.  The adult milkshakes are absolutely delectable HIGHLY recommend the Bananas Foster or the salted caramel...except they are 11 or 12 bucks each.

Valet is free so why wouldn't you valet?  They are ALWAYS packed which can mean  they have a good product, but it could also mean they are disorganized.  I'm thinking they have a pretty good product.  You cannot go without having the salmon chips, you just can't do it.  The calamari is pretty flavorful as well.  I opted for a local IPA tonight for $7 which was very tasty.  The have a good selection of wines and beers.  The drink menu seemed anorexic tonight, but we didn't partake so I can't review.  Bread was hot and steamy and I was hungry so all of that was devoured... I tried the white shrimp for an entree which probably wasn't the best option as it is more of an appetizer, but it did leave room for the dessert.  I was left rather disappointed from the Coconut Cake as it wasn't as tropical as I had hoped.  All in all our server was very friendly which was a plus.  We were seated upstairs which seems a little disjointed from the entertainment below.  This looks more like a loft private party area and  it left me feeling like we were a party of 6 in a room set up for 40.  It felt like they are just trying to pack us in where ever possible.   \\nI really want to like this place.  The energy is a plus, the menu changes so that is a plus, the service can be hit or miss but that's true no matter where you go except for those top tier places where the continuously train...

It's ridiculous. Go ahead and treat yo' self to all those delicious calories and thank me later. Puffed pastry stuffed with roasted veggies and caramelized onions, topped with perfectly poached eggs and the most ridiculous cheese sauce your tongue has had in a long time. There are some other good things on the menu, but I couldn't tell you what they are since I never order them. Just kidding, I do occasionally. Their whipped bacon butter is amazing, and I'm not even a crazy bacon addict. The Smoked Salmon Hash and the Chilaquiles are also on my favorites list. The egg sandwiches are worth mentioning as well.\\n\\nAnd now we shall talk bloody marys, because, well, why wouldn't we? IT'S BRUNCH. Equinox's Serrano pepper vodka is where it's at, y'all. I like my bloodys spicy, and this does the trick.

Good tip, Ken!  \\n\\nSometimes crowds don't lie.  This spot was crowded, but they quickly found me a seat.\\n\\nI was impressed with how efficient and friendly the service was.  They only have about 10 tables, but I counted at least 4 waitstaff that were moving the fastest I have ever seen in a noodle place in Vancouver.  They sat me within 30 seconds of coming in, and then watched to see when I was ready to order from a far (without rushing me at all).  When I looked up to signal them they were instantly there to take the order.  The food arrived 2-3 minutes later - perfectly prepared.  Oh, and the service was really friendly too!  \\n\\nHad the standard test dish of spicy beef noodles with flank and tendon.  What a generous portion!  (Kind of explains the slightly higher prices)\\n\\nThe noodles had the perfect chew to them, and they were plentiful.  The broth had a nice balance between heat, sourness, and beefiness.  There was an MSG buzz to it, but not overpowering - more the enhancing level.  \\n\\nThe tendons were excellent.  Large whole pieces cooked to the perfect consistency.  The beef flank was perhaps the weakest part of the dish, and the thing holding them back from 5 stars.  It was a bit too dry.  I think they either used a cut with not enough fat, or didn't stew it long enough.  I buried the beef deep in the bowl and let it start to soak up more soup to soften - but even by the end of the bowl it was still not as tender as I like.  \\n\\nThis is a really respectable noodle house - one of the better ones in Vancouver by far.

Understandably, it was a bit of a 'special event' and so maybe their more experienced bartenders and other staff were not on duty for this occasion.  Still, I was a little surprised when I walked up to the bar with my girlfriend, to order some drinks, and was met with the bartender giving me a sneer and walking away to look up something on his phone.  So, I waited and shortly a schoolmate came up and started conversing.  About then, the same bartender came up and practically shouted at me, \\"Did you want to order something\\".  My girlfriend ordered a Vodka Collins.  I ordered a gin and tonic.  The bartender didn't know how to make a Vodka Collins and called his colleague over.  They apparently got online, on their phones, and found the formula.  After a lot of mixing, splashing, and more movement then I've ever seen before to mix a drink they handed my girlfriend what they called a 'Vodka Collins'.  She took one sip of it and grimaced.  She said it tasted terrible and asked me to taste it.  I thought it tasted like some weak 'essence of lemon' tonic drink.  The bartender said that it was alright and charged us $14 for the two drinks.  OK, so we went about our business and met with old friends from my old school.  After a while, my girlfriend needed another Vodka Collins.   I went up to the bar and politely told the bartenders that a Vodka Collins is Vodka, Sweet and Sour, and a splash of club soda ( https://www.allrecipes.com/recipe/42948/vodka-collins/ ).  They immediately corrected me, stating that it is made with lemon juice and lime juice.  I just said, \\"just make a decent drink\\".  \\nI understand that with the low unemployment rate, good help for jobs like bartending may be harder to come by.  Still, are such basic drinks, as a Vodka Collins, that hard to learn or master? Also, is it that much to ask that bartenders display, at the very least, a 'non-hostile' attitude?\\n\\nThe shrimp appetizer was nasty and had no flavor.  It is best described as like eating a piece of rubber.  The taco/fajita bar was fine although the steak was tough and chewy.\\n\\nIt's sad that McMenamins can't present better food, with better service, from servers with better attitudes.

I'm not sure why I keep giving it chances, but it continues to let me down. It started with the back-and-forth of the opening hours. They couldn't seem to pick a time to open that they worked for them. Then when they do actually open, they're never actually ready. From no cooks, to no waiters, to everyone is there but no one is actually tending to customers, they just never seem ready to go. The food is okay; the service is sub par. For example, I ate there this morning (for the last time, I'll add). It's in the mid to upper 30s outside, prob low 60s inside. I order coffee. I order food. After receiving the coffee, my waitress refilled my coffee when she brought the food, then I didn't see her again until she brought the check maybe 30 min later or so. To add there might have been 5-6 other tables and another waitress so not too busy. Then I ask for a to go coffee and I'm told, on a rather cold morning, that they do not have hot to go cups but that I could have an iced coffee. My response \\"strike 3.\\"  This experience is somewhat inconsequential but I just have never left there saying to myself that it was an all around good experience. So, in conclusion, there are plenty of good breakfast joints in the highlands/Inman park area that far exceed Folk Art's food and service. Try those before you go here.

The parking lot was packed and congested so I ended up backing out to park on the street.  Plenty of street parking, almost better because the ease of leaving.  It was super cold outside and my friends had already ordered/received their food.  They live in Happy Valley, which is convenient for them but about a 20 minute drive for me--probably won't go out of my way to visit these carts in the future.  Walking around, most carts have huge lines due the amount of people curious to check it out.  I had a mad craving for sushi so settled on Wasabi Sushi PDX (hoping it was an extension of Wasabi) after checking out all the other options.  They were fairly quick in putting out food but cart sushi probably wasn't the best idea--it was alright but the fish was not fresh tasting and I was itchy afterwards even though they use imitation crab.  My friends found a space inside to sit since they were already there.  I like that the eating area is large and enclosed from the element.  I am sure it's heated but it's hard to tell with all the people packed inside, it could be the sheer number of people and their body heat.  There's a beer/wine cart inside that has numerous beers on tap, a pretty big selection of about 30 beers.  The only issue is they close and stop serving pretty early, around 8-9pm.

Shells are then ungracefully tossed into the trough behind the bar. And when I say they are gigantic, I mean they are roughly the size of my palm. If that's not your thing, don't worry, a bucket also features some smaller ones. It's worth noting too that as \\"sea to table\\" these oysters are, they are also very clean. That said, you're likely to get a few that have barnacles and such attached to their shells. \\n \\nWhen my fianc√© and I came here on a Saturday around noon, it was fairly open. Our server, Brandy, made us feel welcome and shucked those oysters so quickly and powerfully. \\n \\nBe sure to leave your designer duds at home - this ain't no fancy establishment, in a good way.

During happy hour cocktails are 5 beans, which is 4.5 beans off the normal price. There are few specials on food too. Their cocktails are an experience. Many of the cocktails on the menu feature truly unique flavors, such as the SACSAYHUAM√ÅN, a habanero-mango concoction. It is my wife's favorite, but be careful, its spicy. Even there \\"classic\\" drinks have a unique feel. I don't think there is a bad one on the list. But you have to try the pisco sour, and try to watch the bartender make it. Very impressive. \\n\\nThe tapas are much like the cocktails: unique creations that unlock a new world of tastes. I don't remember how I felt when I first had ice cream; I was too young. But I imagine it is exactly how I felt while eating tapas with my pisco sour: \\"I didn't know food could be this good.\\" Our favorites are the Yuca Rellena (cheese explosion in your mouth), Pimiento Piquillo Rellena (pepper stuffed with ham and virtue), and the cebiches (you know what cebiches is, right? theirs is fresh and delish). \\n\\nDinner is always a great experience. The servers are really awesome. I think we had the same young lady almost every time we've been. I can't remember her name, but I think she has connections to Peru, as many of the servers do. She is warm, animated, always smiling, and can vividly describe every dish on the menu, which is important because many of the dishes are unfamiliar. To be honest, it really doesn't matter that much. When I'm there, I'm sort of just blindly stuffing my face with whatever dish wonders into my reach, but some people curiously take a different approach.

They're quite pricey relative to the portions and food they serve, so really you're paying to chill out on their patio.  Hey, fair enough.  I say, come here for beer on their patio, maybe some decent grub, but pick up fish and chips from Pajos further down the pier.  The best thing I liked was they have Prosecco by the glass.

As I ate the rubber chicken thinking about making my best to make her feel comfortable and forgetting about the whole mess and having a good time, I started having hiccups from the dry chicken and had to ask for her water (as my drink was gone already). I left that place in such an anger state that even paying was painful as I felt it was just unfair. Even the payment of the parking felt wrong.

We probably could've done without the spring rolls since I was the only one who ate them lol, but I thought they had a nice flavor. Our waiter was great and continuously gave us water and always came to check up on us! And the hostess was super nice and continuously came over to know how we're doing. The entrees came actually super fast, but in enough time that they didn't interfere with the appetizers. I got the udon noodles with the tofu and the vegetable stir fry with tofu, someone else got the beef tips with vegetables and coconut brown rice, and the other person got the special which was a fried rice with scallops topped with a salmon filet. Portions were HUGE and everything looked great. Everyone loved their entrees, with my friend especially loved the beef entree. I especially liked mine, since both are usually very generic at most Asian places, and they were both very unique and actually had a decent variety and quantity of vegetables. Never been so excited to eat leftovers in my life lol.

After my first unremarkable experience, I decided to step it up a notch and order it with a Frank Flapjacket. Maybe the onus should have been on me to clarify with our waiter, but the menu description of \\"wrap any dog in a corn batter jacket\\" led me to think I was ordering the Frankified version of a corn dog. When my dog came out with a flat piece of \\"corn bread\\" instead of being totally dipped in corn batter and fried (like I thought I was getting), I have to say, I was disappointed. \\n\\nFrank was also out of a lot of key ingredients on our last visit, which seemed odd for relatively early on a Saturday evening. Their signature bacon infused vodka was tapped out, as well as their supply of Tito's Vodka (which is listed on most of their vodka cocktails as the key ingredient.) I can understand that it isn't fast or easy to whip up a batch of custom-infused vodka, and don't hold that against them. However, you would think that running out of their staple, featured spirit would call for a quick run to Specs for a case of the good stuff. Especially in anticipation of a busy Saturday night. They did substitute something for Tito's, however, some in our group were not even notified about the substitution, let alone what it was. Frank was also out of several of their sides. \\n\\nOn the plus side, the waffle fries in any of their glorious forms (cheese, chili cheese, or nacho) are fabulous.

Come on people: you gotta support this place. The food was fantastic! While there weren't many options, they were all exquisitely prepared with organic and, in many cases, local produce. In fact, a farmer from a local farm came into the restaurant while we were there and gave us his card. My companion had a kohlrabi soup with fresh Georgia horseradish, and I had a roasted butternut squash sandwich with apples and goat cheese. It came with a side salad that consisted of greens (which were picked yesterday at the guy's farm that we met!), carrots, sunflower seeds and raisins in a deliciously light vinaigrette.\\n\\nIt's kind of hard to spot -- if you're coming toward downtown/GSU on Edgewood, it's on the left on the block past Javalogy and the new location of the Corner Tavern. But, it's worth it. This was my first trip, but I get the impression that this could be a place that I could eat every day, and it would be different, healthful and delicious. \\n\\nAnd, best of all, the service was amazing. In fact, I left a $10 tip because the staff was so sweet and helpful and attentive to us. They even brought us a complimentary dessert bite -- dried figs stuffed with cocoa beans. Yum! I haven't had both my waistline and my tastebuds be this happy at once in a long time.\\n\\nThe service is medium speed -- order at the counter and then sit and they bring your food. At the moment they close at 5, but I'm sure if everyone gets themselves out to support them, they'll soon be feeding us delectable, sustainably grown foods until all hours in no time.\\n\\nEDITED TO ADD (1/23/2008): DD is now serving dinner on many nights of the week until 9pm (Thurs, Fri and Sat).

Paid paid paid so I guess we should have expected the two hour wait. They do not take reservations. The seats are not particularly comfortable. 28 standing outside for a couple of hours and then be placed and rickety wooden chairs in close quarters did not scream ambience for me. How about a nice lounge for a cocktail while we wait for a table? Maybe some Sinatra music in the background?? Maybe some good apps at the bar while we wait? No no no no. This place is a shoe box and it looks like a trattoria. It has a fine dining menu with a casual cafe interior. It was not built for comfort. They have one white wine and one red wine so the drinks are minimal. There is no bar or waiting area at the restaurant .  We started off with a salad that was described as a genm lettuce, walnuts and ricotta.  What we got was basically from very  thick and tough romaine leaves and a dry aged cheese that I never would have guessed was ricotta. It came with a reasonable being a great that had a bit of an acidic bite. The busy wait staff do not encourage communication . After reading raves about the pasta we figured that was a must do. 2 pasta dishes were extremely heavy being wild boar and a rabbit. They were very dense and had a depth of flavor but the quality of the pasta was totally indiscernible with the inundation of heavy sauce. I had hoped to find a lighter pasta with a seafood and white sauce, a take on the carbonara, or something like a fettuccine alfredo. All the pastas were rich and heavy. I would have gone for a Puttanesca and that would have been considered light. My friend ordered the risotto, which was absolutely the most elegant and addicting risotto I've ever tasted. The risotto was prepared with smoked salmon,  seaweed, and Sorel.  we could not taste seaweed, but we sure didn't miss it The olive oil cake was not earth shattering. It was not quite sweet enough and did not have a distinctive olive oil flavor. The chocolate budino was fabulous and our favorite dessert hands down. This is a chocolate cake with a dark chocolate ganache. A dollop of whipping cream actually lightened it a bit. The panna cotta with compote was molto bene. If you don't have Canadian money and you're paying with dollars their exchange rate is horrid. They pretty much skewered us just because their machine was down.

Voodoo Doughnut was the first thing on my family's list of things to try.

It's obviously got curious travelers and locals coming back for more. Just the outside of it already seems intriguing with their sparkly brick walls and signature logo sign. So we waited about 20 minutes till we got inside, and it looks crazy in there. Lots of extravagant colors and the next thing you know it we were at the front. It's a bit overwhelming as there are such a variety of doughnuts to choose from. We happened to get the 3 of the Voodoo Doll Doughnuts, 1 Mango Tango Doughnut, and 2 Blueberry Cake Doughnuts. Let me tell you, they were all amazing! The Voodoo Doll Doughnut was a must-try for obvious signature reasons. It was not overbearing in chocolate, and there was a plentiful amount of raspberry fill which was great. The Mango Tango was also fairly decent and flavorful. As for the Blueberry Cake, THIS IS A MUST HAVE. They were so amazing! The cake just crumbles in your mouth and it's not too sweet or under sweet which had a perfect balance. Just a very light glaze which made it even better. This is definitely one of the best doughnuts I have had in my life. In addition, the creative store and flavors makes the experience so much more worthwhile, and I'm probably going to sneak back there later today, because this is definitely a must-try in Portland, Oregon!"},{"name":"Andina Restaurant","address":"1314 NW Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Amazing ceviche and empanadas, I would recommend to ask for the plantains and chips with the ceviche which would add a good crunch;)"},{"name":"Boi Brazil Churrascaria","address":"5600 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"I am(was) a regular at Texas de Brazil, and I stopped by tonight but the wait was way too long.

My wife called the restaurant earlier and was told that we didn't need to make a reservation. We paid our 10 bucks to park at the lot across the street. The door man opened the door and welcomed us to Scales925. That was the only positive to this review. We walked in and waited to place our names on the wait list. I stood right behind a gentleman who made reservations but the staff wasn't able to locate them. After a few minutes they found his reservation but told him that it was cancelled at noon today. Smh. I then asked how long the wait would be for two. I was told that they are not accepting walk ins. It was 8pm on a Saturday night and they're turning away people who were told that there wasn't a need for a reservation  (just a few hours earlier). The good news was that there are two bars where we could sit and order food. We walked past the bar on the first floor (that was packed and had no seating available) to go to the bar on P4 that was smaller and equally packed. One of the waitresses was kind enough to ask us what's wrong and we stated that we couldn't find anywhere to sit...she replied \\"it's a busy weekend\\" then walked off. So much for let me see if we might be able to find a spot or even just saying I apologize for the inconvenience but this is what we can do for you...oh well. Upon our immediate exit the same doorman that greeted us asked what was wrong  (when he noticed we were leaving after just walking in 20 minutes prior). I told him that the restaurant wasn't accepting walk ins. His reply \\"damn I didn't know that\\". The good thing is there is a restaurant right around the corner named Max Lager that we are at currently. I bet Scales 925 probably sends them a LOT of business unknowingly.

There are three things in particular that get me about these donuts\\n\\n1. They are a sugary nightmare or a sugary dream depending on how you see it.  Most of the donuts are overly sweet.  While unique and often tasty, the sheer amount of sugar can send anyone's sugar levels off the chart.\\n\\n2. They do not accept debit/credit cards.  I get it, you pay a transaction fee as a business everytime someone swipes their card, but by not accepting cards you basically force the poor out of towner who has never been to your shop to pay an ATM fee so they can try your donuts.  Thats bad business in my opinion.  There are great solutions like Square that charge 2.75% per swipe.  So that $3 that your customer just bought with their credit card, you lost 8 cents.  Where with your ATM, if you get half the fees back that it charges the customer, you just made an additional $1.25 on that $3 donut.  Again bad business.\\n\\n3.  To go along with the extra money that you are extracting from customers who do not bring cash, the donuts here are not cheap.  If you try to chose your own dozen, expect to pay at least $20.\\n\\nSo all in all, try it once for the experience, but just make sure you bring cash."},{"name":"Broder Caf√©","address":"2508 SE Clinton St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Wow!

I told her that I know medium has a bit of pink, but mine was bloody!!!\\nSteak was of the poorest quality meat, with loads of gristle, and the fact it came on top of a thin slice of white toast was highly disappointing.

I decided to go to The Bancroft in Burlington, MA.  I chose to eat here because I was craving for a delicious steak.  I wanted to go to a place that was rated high, hence why I chose this restaurant.  The food and service was outstanding.  I had ribeye steak (cooked medium) and steamed asparagus.  The steak was cooked the way I had ordered...medium; and it was perfectly seasoned.  It came with a choice of side sauce, but I didn't use it.  The steak was perfect the way it was.  The asparagus was steamed just right, not soggy and with a crisp crunch when you bite into it.  The complementary bread was so delicious.  The bread is topped with course salt on both the top and bottom of the roll, which made it taste salty.  I just wiped away the salt, and the rolls were perfect.  Just ask for no salt on the rolls.  I was by myself.  I had a cup of clam chowder, rib-eye steak, steamed asparagus, brewed iced tea, and complementary rolls (free), and the bill totaled $74.

My boyfriend is a huge history buff, so of course we hung out around the Faneuil Hall area most of the time. We decided to give the UOH a try LAST MINUTE on a Saturday night. We arrived and there was a 45-60 minute wait. We went over to Green Dragon to grab a beer while we waited and when we came back, we chatted up with the very friendly hostesses (who were highly accomodating in getting us a table).\\n\\nOn to the food:\\n\\nWe ordered the chowda, which I thought was YUMMY, but my boyfriend didn't like as much (he is biased because he thinks Green Dragon is the best in the Universe and nothing compares). We also got the bouillabaisse and a \\"Medium\\" lobster to share. The bouillabaisse was gigantic and chock full of shellfish and half a lobster. The lobster was also delicious. \\n\\nOur waitress seemed extremely busy and stressed out (it was only her and another lady sharing the duties of one large room), but  was outgoing and smiling at us nonetheless....we appreciated that.\\n\\nThe feel of the place is very historical, which is honestly why you go there to begin with.

As delicious as the salted caramel and the candied ginger and the ice cream were in this dish, it was actually the addition of the apples that put this dessert over the top for me.  They were cut into these tiny cubes that just worked so perfectly with the rest of the dish, and it is the tiny details like that that made all of the food at Launderette so much fun to eat.\\n\\nDespite some people's lackluster experiences reported here, I would say this place is still a gem!"},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Yes they have a doughnut shaped like a massive cock.

I finally made it out to J Mueller's a couple of weeks ago. We stood in line like everyone else has mentioned but nowhere near the time as Franklins. A group of 3 of us waited for about 30 minutes and we got there at 11:30. Not a bad wait at all considering the meal we were about to eat. My buddy mentioned I HAD to get the beef ribs. I've never been a big fan of beef ribs because: A. not many places offer them and B. not very places cook them well. My friends, let me say J Mueller's beef ribs are the best I've ever had. Incredible! Seriously, these ribs are legit and I don't hand out statements like that. The meat was smoked to perfection and it was fall off the bone perfect. All in my group agreed the beef ribs were the best they've ever had as well. \\nAs for everything else, it was very, very good. The brisket was seasoned perfectly and fork tender. It had great bark and the sampler tease they give everyone was a nice touch. Another nice touch was seeing Mr. Mueller handing out free beers to everyone waiting in line. That was a nice customer service touch, even though I don't drink. The sausage was good and the pork ribs were good as well. Why only 4.5 stars? I'm a big pork rib fan. The pork ribs were good but they could have used another 30-45 minutes of cooking time to get them perfectly tender. A good rib should take a gentle tug to get the meat off the bone. The ribs this day were a little undercooked. However, they were seasoned just right and had great flavor. A small dock in points for the cooking time but I have to call out the good and the bad. I really want to go back and try their pork chop. If its as good as Cooper's in Llano, I'll officially have no reason to drive out there again. As others have mentioned before, J Mueller's uses heavy pepper in his BBQ. I personally like it. Others may not. I feel so blessed to live in Austin as a BBQ fan. There's so many great BBQ legends here and we just got another one. Welcome everyone, J Mueller BBQ.\\n\\nUPDATE 9/26/2012: Me and my buddies stopped by again today and confirmed again what we experienced our last visit. J Mueller BBQ is legit. My buddy is a huge Franklin's fan and he admitted if he had to do a blind taste test, he wouldn't be able to tell them apart. The brisket was INCREDIBLE and the beef short ribs are the BEST I\\"VE EVER HAD. The pork ribs were AMAZING this time. They were perfectly cooked unlike my last visit. Because of this performance, I am officially bumping them up to 5 stars. My only complaint is the cost. J Mueller's is downright expensive. I ordered 2 beef short ribs, half pound of brisket, 1 pork rib, small potato salad, 1 soda, and 1 water. The bill total was $44. WOW!!! It's not cheap but the quality is definitely worth it."},{"name":"Hall Street Grill","address":"3775 SW Hall Blvd","city":"Beaverton","stars":"3.5","text":"I gotta say, the recent changes this place has been through, it has not just gone downhill, it's in a free fall.  I work directly across the street from this place, where I used to be a regular.

The entire staff is different, from the general manager, to the head bartender, to the head chef, etc.\\n\\nI went there tonight to enjoy a couple of drinks with a couple of employees and show my appreciation for them.  While at the bar, Casey (the replacement for James, the former head bartender) was serving us.  Casey's attitude and rudeness killed any and all interest in returning to this place.  Be careful what you say if you sit at the bar, otherwise he will take offense to it and let you know.  The manager, upon speaking with her of the bartender's substandard service, also seemed much more concerned with getting the customer out of the bar than she was about addressing the issue at hand.  She was simply an \\"appeaser\\", with nothing to contribute to a dissatisfied customer.\\n\\nThe point is, don't listen to the older, better reviews for this place.  The complete overhaul of what was a GREAT place has completely ruined the friendly vibe of the place, the food has gone downhill, and the service is now worse than ever.

There's a certain charm to the place, which includes its location in the middle of a residential neighborhood. Sure, it does lack some traditional hotel amenities (such as a central area for sitting that doesn't require entering one of the bars, or restaurant). But the setting is nice, rooms are unique and having a cinema inside your hotel is pretty great...\\n\\nAnd, I would give this spot five stars if it weren't for an incident that happened in the theater, followed by something related in one of the bars--both of which were disappointing, and had me puzzling about staff, their attitudes and training.\\n\\nThe theater: the film showing the night I stayed at the hotel was Crazy Rich Asians, and as I was waiting to head into the theater, a group of folks came up and asked the staff if they knew the plot of the film. Staff obliged with a description and in response, a person in the group said \\"Oh my god, totally do not need to watch a movie about Asian people...\\" And, the staff member, in response, smiled and said, \\"I can understand that.\\"\\n\\nReally, do you. Interesting... In any case, I decided to give the benefit of the doubt that it was just a thoughtless reflex by someone without hospitality experience trying to relate to a guest who didn't want to deal with Asians (although, why that's necessary, we'll never know). So, I went in to watch the film, assuming it was the end of that. After the film...\\n\\nThe bar: I stopped off for a drink at one of the hotel's many bars, since it was early. And, as I'm sitting and staring off into space, the same group from the theater comes wandering in, which of course made me happy (who doesn't want to be in a tiny space with people who like to speak in soundbites of casual racism)... \\n\\nAnd, as expected, they started up a really great conversation with the bartender that began with \\"This neighborhood used to be mostly black, right?\\" followed by \\"When I went to school, none of us would come up this way,\\" And then, \\"Yeah, they used to film COPS here\\" to which the bartender laughed, and replied \\"Oh, it's cleaned up a lot since then,\\" which was followed by \\"Yeah, I didn't see any black people around\\"... Beautiful.\\n\\nAside from me and this group, there was only one other person in the bar, who was clearly listening to the exchange, and picked up his things and walked out. I don't know if it was because of what was just said, but as I was leaving, he was outside smoking, and gave me a nod, shook his head [in the way one does when something meets your expectation of falling below expectations] and said \\"Welcome to Portland.\\"\\n\\n---\\n\\n\\"Welcome to Portland\\"... I can remember the days when Neo-Nazis were everywhere, and the feeling that a lot of places in Oregon still unofficially enforced \\"sundown laws\\" of the 1800s... And I've seen the city step up when it comes to race, etc.... So, my racial sensitivity isn't overblown by hyperbolic rhetoric, activism or anger grown in a bubble, but grounded in a reality that recognizes good intentions as well real threats, and most importantly, the subtle messages that tell you when you are not welcome. But this thing that happened at this hotel...\\n\\nI don't know what to make of it except to say that either the staff has not-so-latent attitudes about race and ethnicity that seep out on the job, or they need to have better training to understand the kind of environment they are intentionally or unintentionally cultivating when they ride along with this kind of passive racism.\\n\\n---\\n\\nSo, would I stay here again? Until these things happened, the answer was \\"yes.\\" After this happened, the answer was \\"maybe.\\" And then, I came to this Yelp page to see if anyone had any similar experiences... \\n\\nAnd noticed that another guest, Irena, on 7/11/18, had an observation about something similar--to which the hotel manager responded by \\"vehemently\\" denying that anything relating to racism could be at work, and suggested that \\"maybe from [the guest's] perspective\\" it seemed like racism, but maybe it was just bad service (which is unfortunately the least inspiring way to respond, to simultaneously tell someone that what they experienced didn't actually happen, and emphasize that point by hinting that 'maybe it's all in your head') ...\\n\\nThus, the answer is \\"no,\\" probably not. And, like the reviewer from 7/11/18, this makes me sad.

My fear was that we would not have a private room, but they came through with a room perfectly set up for my entertaining.

Ridiculous and made me almost opt out.  Our bill came to $4300.00. Second, kill the small martini glasses. Pour baby pour. You are a steak house and everything is big like the sides you serve. Third, never comfortable with required tips (20%).  I get it, but I don't like it and I know there are some cheap customers out there.  I think we came in close to 30%. Fourth, the lamb chops were tasty but very fatty and small for a steak house.  Must have been a long winter in Colorado? And last, a group of 20 should be easily served when ordering from the dinner menu.  \\n\\nService was outstanding, entertaining and our servers were full of energy.  Everyone loved their meals including the seafood towers that really weren't towers but full of cold delicious seafood including very large shrimp.

That was a bit disappointing (I wasn't exactly asking for anything complicated... a white sangria...). \\n\\nThe reason for my review not being 5 stars was actually not the food, drinks or service. I give all of those 5 stars. The noise level was just too high. They keep the music really loud and with people trying to yell over the music it just makes it that much louder. One of the guests in my party actually asked them to turn it down a little bit, just so we didn't have to yell.

It was the worse. \\n\\nWhat was wrong with it: no flavor, no juicyness. Lomo saltado is supposed to be fried steak in a pan. Then, the egg is fried INSIDE the steak juices so it has a brown color and meat flavor, and then the plantains are fried inside the meat juices as well. INSTEAD, what I was served was steak tips that had zero juice whatsoever, an egg that had been fried SEPARATELY and therefore didn't have the taste of the dish, and plantains that had probably been microwaved. I don't know if the owners of this place are Peruvian or not, but this is absolutely not how the dish is made. \\n\\nMy boyfriend had a Salvadorean plate but I'm not Salvadorean so I cannot comment.

We all sat there stunned as we weren't being obnoxious or disorderly, but simply enjoying each other's company. So my friend asked the guy what the problem was, in which he told us that \\"its' Sunday and we're extremely busy and we need those tables.\\" His explanation was unacceptable being that this is ATLANTA and every Brunch establishment is busy.

When I saw it on the Dine Originals list, it immediately jumped to the top of mine, right above the numerous restaurants I've never tried before. I was glad others expressed interest, and a party of six proved to be about the perfect size for BCB.\\n\\nI admit that I am a green nerd. I go out of my way to consider the environmental impact of my decisions and adjust accordingly.[1] That said, one of the things I remembered most about Black Creek was that they have a farm where they grow as much of the produce and livestock used in the preparation of their menu as possible. In fact, the Black Creek farm existed BEFORE the restaurant. I'll limit my discussion of their sustainable practices to that,[2] but suffice it to say, these practices have influenced my review to the tune of one star. \\n\\nThose of you that follow my reviews are probably aware I am a pescetarian (a fishetarian, as I've been saying lately, or a vegequarium, as the waiter said tonight). You may not know why though. I gave up red meat and pork after my father had a massive heart attack in '03. He passed in '05, and I gave up chicken shortly after, when I moved back to Ohio, where the vegetarian options are far greater than rural WV.\\n\\nMy secondary reasons are environmental in nature. I'm not against the killing of animals (sorry PETA, et al.) when it's done sustainably and humanely (given the circumstances). Couple that with the fact that I like to try new things, and I decided to break my diet tonight, something I hadn't done since Burgundy Room a few years back.  \\n\\nMy four course meal:[3] \\n\\n- Roasted Beet and Apple Salad (featuring a nut that definitely WASN'T pistachios [as advertised]).\\n- Bistro Frog Legs\\n- Game Hen Surprise\\n- PB and J Bread Pudding\\n\\nIn addition, I had a glass of Riesling,[4] a featured honey martini,[5] and some bistro fries provided thanks to the generosity of Matt W. \\n\\nThe bistro fries were salty/spicy, but in a good way. The beet and apple salad could have used some more apples, but was a sweet, fresh start to my meal. Whatever those nuts were (consensus was pine or pumpkin), they added a perfect, toasted note to the salad. \\n\\nFrog legs were a new one for me. I'd been debating whether they broke my diet or not. From a conscientious point of view, I feel like they did. And when you look at them, I don't care what you say, sucking the meat off a frog's leg bone ain't the same as eating a fillet of salmon. Either way, they were interesting. The meat DID have a seafood-like hint to it, particularly in the thicker pieces. They were paired to perfection with a tomato concasse and a buttery sauce.\\n\\nOnce I'd decided on the frog legs, it was easy to solidify the deal with the game hen. The hen was served with some lightly mashed taters (that is to say, they were pretty darn chunky) and a mild chili sauce. It was the highlight of the night, and not gamy at all. Far less creepy looking than the frog legs. Hah! The tender hen was fantastic alongside the soft mashers...I have no regrets!\\n\\nAs for the PB and J bread pudding, I'll simply say that while it was good, I've had better elsewhere (Cap City comes to mind). One thing that would help would be slightly more of the \\"J\\" drizzled around the plate.\\n\\nOverall, it was a fantastic meal. I realize it's a bit steep for some of my fellow yelper's budgets, but I think it's the sort of place we should all support more frequently if we can manage. The fact that you can have food THIS good, and do so in a responsible and sustainable way, OUGHT to be affecting the entire industry on a much larger scale.

Today, we went with a party of four and decided to sit downstairs in the pub.  There was a hostess's booth upon entering, but no hostess could be found.  One of our guests sat at the bar and ordered a margarita while we tried to sort out the seating situation.  Finally, we nabbed a seat in the \\"Freedom Trail Room,\\" where only one other group was seated. \\n\\nAnother group came in after us, and waitresses walked past us several times without acknowledging us.  The table had two few place settings and only one menu.  A busboy brought us glasses of water and said \\"A waitress should be out here soon.\\"  Yeah, \\"soon\\" was the operative word.\\n\\nOne of our guests had to get up and go ask for service after new parties came in and got served before us.  The waitress was rude and sarcastic, claiming that because there were drinks on the table (the one margarita), we must have already been served.  \\n\\nWe ordered off of the limited pub menu, or tried to.  One guest ordered a half-dozen oysters, my husband ordered a half-dozen oysters and an order of steamers (which it turned out they were out of, and his oysters never came.)  The other guest ordered fish and chips and was told that wasn't a menu item, only to have it pointed out to her on the menu-- that we had to grab for ourselves off of another table.  \\"Oh.  Well, whatever, it's a new menu.\\"  My husband swapped in mussels for the missing steamers, and I had a crab cake sandwich. \\n\\nOysters: poorly shucked, though my husband's order never arrived even though he asked twice.\\nMussels: swimming in watery butter and resulting in gastric distress\\nCrab cake: burned \\nClam chowder: Basically potato soup with a scrap of clam that someone accidentally dropped into it\\n\\nAdded bonuses: \\n- The waitress charged my husband for the half-dozen oysters he asked for twice but never received\\n- A waiter using the bathroom while still wearing his apron with straws, etc. in the pockets. \\n\\nThis place was a disgusting disappointment.

It has a very rustic, old-school charm to it and, as a native Bostonian, I can attest to how it draws a mostly tourist crowd these days. Nevertheless, there's something for everyone to enjoy here. Personally, I like to seek out the specific booth where JFK liked to sit.\\n\\nSome folks might find the menu to be a tad pricey. Yes, you are paying a slight premium for the touristy, historic aspect of the venue, but don't forget that seafood is a bit more expensive than other menu items anyway. You probably wouldn't pay less than $10-12 for a generic basket of fish and chips at any random fried seafood shack anyway.\\n\\nIf prices are a concern, the lunch menu is quite reasonable in my opinion, with most items costing less than $20. I'd personally skip the lobster roll and go all out for the trio of mini lobster cake, crab cake, and fish cake; the platter of fried fish, clams, oysters, scallops, shrimp, and calamari; or for something lighter and more healthful, a dish of seared or broiled shrimp and scallops.\\n\\nService is friendly and engaging as you would expect of a place that tries to make tourists happy.

Three years ago it was simply because it was so close to the hotel, I could see it from the room, last month though I sought out the delicious sausages intentionally because my stomach remembered how happy it was after eating there.\\n\\nFrank is a really neat building on the inside. A little bit like if a saloon and a country diner had a baby, with just a dash of hipster. Bar by the front door, just past that is a counter to order your food, beyond that the rest of the first floor is all seating, with a secondary seating area upstairs. \\n\\nThree years ago it was a sit down and order type deal, so the counter and the big menu threw me off a little, but it didn't lessen the experience any. Sometimes I prefer not having to wait on a server and just getting my order in. \\n\\nI ordered the Pepperwurst, my brother ordered the Stag and my wife ordered the Notorious P.I.G. We also got pimento cheese waffle fries and a giant soft pretzel to split for the table. The Pepperwurst was super flavorful and spicy, but not enough to burn your mouth, and the toasted, buttered bun brought it all together. It really was my favorite out of the bunch even though it was so simple. The soft pretzel was also great, fluffy and chewy at the same time, just enough salt. Easily big enough to share. The cheese fries were a much better version of a classic. Fresh cut crispy waffle fries with pimento cheese and chopped bacon are a step above the typical shoestring fries with cheese sauce. (Also we didnt try any cocktails but they do have the delicious local Maine Root soda on tap.)\\n\\nMy only two minor complaints were a bit of a wait and the fact that it was really warm inside the restaurant. To be fair is was August in Texas, but it's hard to cool a building with just some ceiling fans. (I think it may have just been an AC issue as we visited twice and it was much improved the second trip.) \\n\\nFrank is certainly a favorite of mine and whether you're a local or just visiting, if you're in the heart of downtown Austin you should absolutely stop by."},{"name":"Steak on Fire","address":"7541 Sand Lake Rd, Ste A","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Very nice casual place in town.

This place is an Atlanta institution and I am personally committed to keeping it that way, one face-full of pot likker at a time.\\n\\nFood: I grace the doors of Mary Mac's more frequently than my own dining room table, so I personally consider myself well-versed on their menu. Overall, the food at Mary Mac's is not the most exceptional representation of traditional southern cuisine, but it's consistent and should satisfy most reasonable diners' expectations for casual and inexpensive comfort food. Each entree is served with a mixed basket of complimentary bread (cinnamon rolls, cornbread, any yeast bread) and your choice of two sides. There are at least three dozen sides to choose from, so if you can't find at least two that appeal to you then you should probably be institutionalized.\\n\\nService: Mary Mac's exemplifies pure Southern charm at its best. Service is incredibly friendly, helpful, and fast, regardless of how busy they are. The restaurant also has its very own goodwill ambassador, Jo Carter, who will treat you to a complimentary back rub during your meal, regardless of whether you asked for it or not.\\n\\nAtmosphere: Mary Mac's has been in operation since 1945 and hosted some of the greatest names to grace the world stage, including multiple U.S. Presidents, countless entertainers, and the Dalai Lama. The restaurant has paid homage to these individuals by posting their photos throughout its multiple dining rooms. Dress is casual and the clientele is among the most eclectic in all of Atlanta.\\n\\nCost: Inexpensive, particularly considering the size of the portions. Appetizers cost $5 to $9, soups and salads cost $2 to $4, entrees cost $10 to $20, and homemade desserts are around $4.\\n\\nOther: All first time diners at Mary Mac's are traditionally offered a complimentary cup of pot likker, which is the liquid leftover after boiling greens.  My visiting guests from the North typically spit it out with utter disgust after just one taste, but I'll readily admit that I've ingested at least a few gallons of it under the guise of a tourist.

I sat at the bar with my father. We had oysters and and talked and enjoyed the pleasant midday downstairs vibe. However the second time I came here with my father we ate dinner upstairs. The formal dining area is historic but still felt a bit unclean to me, but I let it slide, thinking its clean enough. When me and my father were seated we were promptly greeted by our waiter who was friendly but not the best waiter ever but she took our orders correctly and was quick. Food was expensive and had a lackluster appeal. But its based in tradition so all the selections are old. Anyways I decided to get the broiled seafood platter and my father got some fried seafood and we both shared oysters from the same plate. When are oysters arrived I thought they tasted worse then before but nothing a little lemon can't fix. The rest of my food I ordered was bland and disappointing. Our meal came to a total of 100 dollars for oysters two seafood platters and two iced teas. So it was an expensive meal for bad food. Know what, that's not the worst part, I got food poisoning from the oysters. You know how I know it was the oysters because my father was sick just like me and we were the only ones who got sick and it was the only food we had shared. So basically I paid to get food poisoning from a food that's in the name of the restaurant. We called about it but since it was right before Christmas the people who answered were distracted and didn't bother listening to my father. Luckily I could keep food down and could mostly get out of bed by Christmas.

Not only does John Mueller have the bloodline that runs deep in world famous TX BBQ circles, he has the chops on his own to compete for the title. The brisket was unreal. I cannot say I've ever had better (But Franklin is right there with him). I am so happy to have 2 of the best brisket joints in the world right here in my home town.  If J. Mueller is not #1, he is most definitely #1A. I judge all bbq places by their brisket because it is by far the hardest bbq to make, hold and serve while keeping the quality up to world class standards. To do this out of a trailer is nothing short of remarkable.Thanks to the J. Mueller's crew for a great day for the wife and I and a solid victory for the Austin BBQ (and total food) scene.\\n\\nAnybody who drives from or bypasses Austin to go to Lockhart for BBQ just has way too much time on their hands or are just not up on current events.

People expect the same experience at any restaurant in a chain, it shouldn't depend on location.  Why not borrow some from another location?  It certainly doesn't build customer trust.\\n\\nAt checkout, my order was wrong.  I got two distinctly different pizzas, but they charged me for 2 of the same kind.

I got seated right away and the person who seated me took my drink order and told me the server would be over soon. I had 3 different workers walk by and look at me a few times. Eventually one came over and took my order. She told me she was swamped because of a large party. It looked like about 16 people, then another table of 8, then myself. This itself wasn't a problem. When my order came out I had a different side than what I ordered. I told the girl (who wasn't my actual server) that the wrong side was sent out.  I smelled something strange when the food was brought out. I realized later after she walked by again that it was her! There was a very strong vaginal odor coming from her that I could smell about 10 feet away. I'm not sure if her co workers are just smell blind, or don't have the heart to tell her, but she really needs to do something about that.

Whenever I mention that I am homesick for this kind of comfort food, my Portland friends have told me that I simply MUST check out Broder because it offers \\"authentic Scandinavian breakfasts\\". One friend even told me to make sure to order the \\"lefse of the day\\", which really confused me since lefse is a potato flatbread, not a sandwich, and is traditionally served on it's own with butter and/or brown sugar as a side-item. To me, it's a little like saying \\"tortilla of the day\\".\\n\\nI think Scandinavian-American food can be a difficult sell to novice American diners. Some of the pronounced traditional flavors and seasonings (dill, pickled foods, fish flavors, cardamom, anise) are unusual for the American palette. I've offered to make some traditional items for friends only to have them turn it down after I've explained the ingredients. Why is pickled herring somehow more horrifying than ceviche? I have no idea - other than the idea of eating pickled or brined fish items isn't part of many American's experience.\\n\\nThat said, Broder has done an an excellent job of balancing the idea of \\"Scandinavian-American cuisine\\", while finding a way to make it accessible to the modern American palette. I ordered the salmon cakes with a side of vegetables. The salmon cakes were nicely executed with a good flavor and crispness to the outside. My veggies were delicious and I was very happy that a healthy side item was on the offering. Would my Norwegian and Danish grandmothers consider this Scandinavian? Probably not. They would have loaded the salmon cakes with dill, and a liberal plate of pickled veggies and fish would have been placed in the center of the table for sharing rather than the tiny amount of pickled cucumbers and onions that came with my dish. And, of course, they would have served it with rye crisps, potatoes, or flat bread. Would they approve of this dish in general? Absolutely.

And I especially like it as a restaurant for out-of-town friends. Friday night, we went out with friends that were visiting from Kansas City and this place was a perfect destination. Why? Well for starters, there is something chic about a place that you can't find. With no signage on Ralph McGill, I drove by it once and almost a second time, and I have been there multiple times. But chicness oozes out of Two's every pore. The old warehouse location, the weird drive-thru valet, the jazz band in the bar, and the bonfire in the middle of the restaurant all help to let you know you may not be cool enough to eat here.\\n\\nThe barrels of wine are another unique aspect of the dining experience here. And with our friends being wine enthusiasts, we were able to experiment with several varietals. Now, most of this is lost on me, as I pretty much have been ordering Pinot Noirs exclusively ever since seeing the movie Sideways for the first time. So it was nice being with someone who knew what they were doing and assumed the wine ordering duties.\\n\\nPlaces that rock in atmosphere often have trouble living up to that standard in the kitchen, but Two comes close. The menu is a lot like a Bruce Springsteen concert. The set list may change nightly, but the old standbys are always there. The calamari appetizer is served with a sweet honey glaze and are amongst the best in town. We also shared the crawfish and corn beignets and the fried green tomatoes. All very good. My main course, I had the seared tuna, served rare with a spicy dressing and edamame, which was outstanding. The wives ordered the Bronzed Scallops over gouda grits, which were also very good.\\n\\nI have been a fan of Two Urban Licks from my first visit during an ice storm three years ago.

The bar area, while small, was comfortable and allowed for some casual conversation while sipping on a glass of wine until our reservation time came up. \\n\\nPromptly at our reservation time the hostess came to the bar and let us know she was ready to seat us. We were sat at a two top in the patio area that was enclosed with pho walls to keep the cold air out and the warm air in as best as possible. On the opposite wall to where we were sat there was a heater that would kick on and off. Let me tell you, when it kicked on it was WARM. But overall it was comfortable. Unlike the bar area, the main dining room area was very loud. I did notice several large parties surrounding us so that may be to blame, but it was a bit of challenge to have a conversation with my husband who was sitting across from me without feeling like I was yelling. \\n\\nThe food was delicious. I started with the Salade Maison. The balsamic vinaigrette dressing was a bit strong for my taste, but overall it was fine. For my entree I ordered the Poulet R√¥ti. It was perfect. The thyme-roasted chicken was cooked exactly how I like it and the Yukon gold potato pur√©e was perfectly buttered and the texture was spot on.

I'd also recommend creating your own burger - everyone likes making their own choices! \\n\\nAlso, don't skip out on the Grindhouse sauce. It's like Zaxby's Zax's sauce, but way better. At least get some on the side to dip your fries in. \\n\\nIf milkshakes are your thing, the boozy shakes are nice and strong.

The line moved briskly and soon I found myself at the counter with nary an idea of what to order.  I eyed a cream-filled chocolate glazed beauty that soon found its way to my hands, mouth, and stomach.  The texture was soft and cake-like, closer to Dunkin than to Krispy Kreme.

As I sat there, getting my food delivered, it's not what I imagined. \\n\\nThe tomato crab soup : overly salty, taste worst then eating a bottle of ketchup. They give you a tiny slice of bread the size of your finger to balance the overly salty taste. Wasn't enough bread to make want to eat the soup. \\n\\nTwice baked croissant: it's a must, I mean really crusty and flaky on the outside which what all croissant should achieve. The inside is creamy and buttery. \\n\\nLarge chocolate mousse cup: so I'm thinking this thing is some type of pudding delicious drink. No, not what I expected. It's not even large, it's a small round hard chocolate cup cake. Inside the chocolate is filled with mousse pudding. It's more of a candy, imagine a Reese peanut butter cup filled with pudding. \\n\\nApple turnover: this Apple turn over, isn't as good as the one at Publix. It's crusty, hard, flaky on the outside but the inside was the same as the outside. I don't even see the Apple fillings... where did it go? Were these people being skint on the fillings? Saving extra money. When the food is over priced and doesn't measure up the price standards. \\n\\nOverall: expensive tiny subpar food. They can work on their french decor better. Some of their food is bland and others are overly salty. Do they even taste what they make? How can you serve something to someone when you haven't taste it. Place is over rated.

The turkey was a bit salty for my taste, and it just seemed like good quality lunchmeat.  I'm not sure exactly what I was expecting, but this did not exceed my expectations. The cranberry chutney tasted fine, but the portion was quite small, too small to cover the whole tartine when spread. \\n\\nGood food presentation and a nice atmosphere definitely helped this meal.

When I found King+Duke, I tried my best to not be biased by the siren's song of good design, and the fact that it was everything I was looking for in the Buckhead area. \\n\\nI strolled in rather late, around 8:30 PM. I found the sign, but couldn't find the main entrance from Peachtree Road. I stumbled through the outdoor patio with another couple in trail behind me, likely just as confused as to where the main entrance was. The patio was bustling and almost every table was full, with no signs of anyone leaving any time soon. Good times were being had. \\n\\nEnter the main building. This place is deceivingly massive. Lovely antiqued metals and ironworks everywhere. Warm exuding from the giant hearth where the main dishes are cooked, to the wide use of natural woods, and to the bar and lounge areas. \\n\\nI found my way to the host desk immediately after finding my bearings in the restaurant. The two hostesses that were there greeted me immediately. I let them know I was eating alone, and the hostess that attended to me offered for me to sit at the counter where they regularly do the chef's selection fixed course. They didn't have any reservations for the fixed menu that night, so I could enjoy the bustle of the hearth while ordering off the regular menu. I kindly obliged. \\n\\nThe heat of the kitchen warmed me up real quick. My waitress brought a menu right away and gave me just enough time to figure out what I wanted to drink, and then my final order. I went with the sticky wings to start, and \\"The Duke\\" burger for my entree. (When in Rome, right?)\\n\\nI quietly sipped on my beer while enjoying the energy of the kitchen before my eyes. The smells alone were enough to ignite the soul, but these chefs--no-- the entire staff is on another level. Everyone communicates succinctly and almost telepathically. I watched waiters go up and down stairs with such careful speed that looked like a demonstration or workshop. My wings came during my hypnotized moment, but the smell immediately captured my attention. These were not your typical American hot wings. Immediately ginger and eastern spices on the nose. These wings were the perfect combination of sticky and crispy at the same time (fitting name, indeed). The spice actually reminded me of the spicy Ramen I had during my time in Osaka. Unique, and most importantly, delicious. Major props for providing a full-size, wet hand towel to clean up afterwards, because only the chefs behind the counter could know how much sauce was all over my hands and face. \\n\\nI waited just a short time between finishing my wings for \\"The Duke\\" to arrive. In between, the waitress came back to remove my plates and fill my glass of water once or twice, asking my how I was doing and how the food was. I really appreciated the interaction. Finally, my entree arrived, and boy was it an entry. Presented on a simple platter garnished by recycled menus as liners for the tableware. I chomped on a few fries before diving into the burger. The fries were perfectly seasoned, and not devoid of the potato flavor. It's nice to actually have the taste of the vegetable in the final product. Enough of that. This burger was absolutely well worth the name, \\"The Duke.\\"\\nAbsolutely perfectly cooked beef (medium rare), thick and crispy bacon without being burnt, Gruyere practically melting off the plate, and sauteed onions that put other garnishes to shame. Biting into it felt both like a blessing and sin in one. My taste buds were not worthy. Beef bliss. One of the chefs in the hearth made his way over to ask, \\"How's the burger? Good shit?\\"\\n\\n\\"Oh yeah, good shit.\\" \\n\\nI rarely have room for dessert, and tonight was no exception. However, I had to try something or return home feeling like something was missing from the experience. I opted for the lightest possible with some Raspberry sorbet and Mint/Fudge gelato. For $3 each flavor, I got a LOT of dessert. I probably should have ordered just one in retrospect, but it was worth every spoonful. \\n\\nThis was a true five-star experience. If you keep things simple, it's possible to have an affordable, filling dinner of unparalleled quality. If you're looking to splurge, expect to get a LOT of great food. I lack the words to express how good my meal was. Bravo King+Duke. I'm grateful. I'll be back to conquer the King soon."},{"name":"Gracie's","address":"729 SW 15th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"We loved old world feeling of Hollywood, very classy, good music, excellent services, and the food beyond our expectations.

Every meal at The Paramount starts with 45 minutes of waiting in line, and you order your meal directly from the kitchen staff.\\n\\nThe food is also not cheap.  Expect to spend roughly double what you would for a normal diner breakfast.\\n\\nThey also have an odd seating policy.  You are NOT allowed to \\"reserve\\" tables with your bag.  You wait in line, order your food from the counter, and then are escorted to a seat (sometimes right next to two strangers) by the man we refer to as the \\"Keeper of the Tables\\" once you have paid.  You get a decent amount of time to eat, but if it looks like you're \\"camping,\\" the Keeper will ask you to pack it up.\\n\\nWhy, then, would anyone eat here?  Well, there are two reasons, and good ones at that:\\n\\n1) The food is spot-on excellent.  They take absolutely no shortcuts when making the meal.  When you order a fruit salad, every piece of fruit is fresh and carefully cut.  No brown spots, no mushy pieces, and none of those tough bits from the edge of the cantaloupe which makes up every other fruit salad.  The orange juice is freshly squeezed on the premises, and the usual breakfast fare is expertly prepared.\\n\\n2) The Paramount is also something of an experience.  There's sort of a camaraderie afoot as people stand in line and wait for their table -- unless, of course, you're that asshole (there always is one) who elbows his way past the line looking for a seat, throws his coat triumphantly on an empty chair, and then gets a talking-to from the Keeper of the Tables.  In that case, everyone in line will comment on what a Jerk that guy was, and give him dirty looks as we get escorted to his seat.\\n\\nAnyways, this is definitely my favorite breakfast in the area, but I'll definitely skip it if I'm with a particularly emo friend or if I'm in a hurry."},{"name":"Chick-fil-A","address":"461 N Central Ave","city":"Hapeville","stars":"4","text":"I thought it was so cool visiting the original chick-fil-a.

The mac and cheese and sweet potato casserole were so tasty. I wish every Chick-fil-A offered them. I have been craving them ever since.

People kept on coming in up until they official closed their doors. Yeesh. The inside is cozy and intimate with a pretty laid back ambiance/feel to AFL.\\n\\nThe menu is short with only 8 brunch options, a couple sides and desserts. Substitutions are \\"politely declined\\". Drink menu is almost as short with cocktails, coffee and their house selection (beer, prosecco, white and red) on tap.\\n\\n- Cappucino ($3.75) - B said it was smooth and had a hint of a sour note to it.\\n- Frittata with potatoes & smoked sablefish ($17.00) - I have yet to find a brunch frittata that I love and that trend unfortunately continues. The frittata had more potato than sablefish and the sablefish was sporadic. The sablefish was also really, really salty. The salad was surprisingly good but they placed it on top of the frittata, which resulted in a hot salad. I couldn't imagine eating a whole dish myself.\\n- Sagne, mushroom trifolati & poached egg ($17.00) - this was one of their vegetarian dishes. We were intrigued by the sagne, a rhomboid flat style pasta. I will give them props for making their own pasta from scratch; peek into the open kitchen and you'll see them making it fresh. The pasta had a good bite but it wasn't perfectly al dente. We also wanted more mushrooms, another poached egg (one wasn't yolky enough to cover all the pasta) and more sauce.\\n- Banana bread & cinnamon ricotta ($5.00) - this was the BEST dish of our meal. I thought the bread was fantastic and didn't even need the cinnamon ricotta. Seriously, make sure you get this! It was slightly warmed, sweet, buttery, heavenly goodness. We should have got another to go.\\n\\nCome for the desserts? Apparently, the olive oil is also very popular.

My husband and I were doing the usual back and forth \\"where do you want to eat?\\" and the \\"I don't know.  Where do you want to eat?\\".  As I opened my trusty little yelp app this place was the first thing I saw.  Little did I know they had a lot more to offer than just coffee.  So here I am writing my review - 3 visits later.\\n\\nPotato Leek Omelet - this is by far one of my favorites.  I say this but I've only had a few of the many things here.  By favorites I mean I would come back just for this dish because I liked it that much.  The combo of everything that made this dish worked well.  Plus -  get the potato hash cake - perfectly crisp and the type of \\"stringy\\" hash that I like.\\n\\nTofu Chorizo Taco - so I'm totally opposite of vegan or vegetarian but this taco intrigued me. I've had vegan chorizo before and was a bit impressed.  The tofu scrambler which many a yelper raved about definitely screamed \\"try me!\\".  First off, the portion size was great!  The insides overflowed out of the taco filling the small plate that it came on - there was more tofu scramble and vegan chorizo than the tortilla could handle.  Second off, the tofu scramble and vegan chorizo lived up to the great reviews on flavor.  Never would I have known the scramble was tofu just by tasting it.  Great flavor and definitely have had this at more than one visit.\\n\\nVeggie Burger - the larger portion size of this also surprised me.  The type of toasted bread was also a good choice on the restaurants part l as I am not a big fan of traditional hamburger buns. The top slice was a bit too toasted and crunchy as it was hard to bite and tear easily into - but the bottom was perfectly toasted. The homemade veggie patty was a little dry but held together well and had good flavor.  I do have to say it almost got lost in the mix of all the fixins' on the burger."},{"name":"Mary Mac's Tea Room","address":"224 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"A friend of mine was going to be in town for the weekend, and he wanted to try good ol' soul food.  After asking for suggestions for good places on Talk Atlanta (http://www.yelp.com/topic/atlanta-help---i-need-to-know-the-must-try-places-in-atl), I got some great recommendations - one of which was Mary Mac's Tea Room (thanks, guys!).  The reviews on Yelp looked pretty good, so I ultimately chose Mary Mac's.\\n\\nI was afraid that the place would be super busy and that there may be a wait on a Friday night, but our party of 7 was fortunate to avoid a wait around 7:30 pm.  (I had called a few hours earlier to see if we could make a reservation, but they only take reservations for parties of 8 or more.)\\n\\nThe server asked whether we had been there before, but none of us had.  He brought us an assortment of complimentary breads - like dinner rolls, cornbread, and cinnamon rolls - as well as small cups of pot likker (a.k.a. pot liquor or potlikker), which I guess is only free for new guests.  It was my first time ever trying pot likker, which is the liquid that is left behind after boiling greens.  I thought it looked like \\"miyuk guk\\" (Korean seaweed soup), but it was super salty.  Not really a fan of it nor of the cornbread that comes with it.  I don't really like cornbread in general, but I thought I'd give it a shot and it did not \\"wow\\" me.\\n\\nThey give you the menu along with a paper order form and pencils to write down your individual order, which I thought was unusual but interesting.  I ordered a 1/2 sweet tea-1/2 lemonade (Arnold Palmer) and three fried chicken legs with cream corn and whipped potatoes.\\n\\nWhile we waited for our food, an older woman came up behind one of my guy friends, put her arm around his shoulder, and said that she was looking for good-looking men that night.  My friend absolutely freaked while we all laughed nervously.  Another friend took pictures of the woman squeezing his shoulders.  It turned out that this woman's name is Jo Carter, and she made sure to squeeze each of our shoulders as she handed us her business card which indicates she is a \\"Goodwill Ambassador\\" at Mary Mac's.  Very interesting...  Friendly, but a little creepy at the same time.\\n\\nOur food didn't take very long to arrive, and I was super excited to eat!  Although I ordered the three fried chicken legs, they brought me (as well as my other friends who ordered the same) four legs!  I wondered if it was because it was our first time there.  It was nice!  The fried chicken was crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside without being overly greasy like usual fried chicken.  The chicken was good on it's own, but I usually like to dip it in sauce, so I asked for some BBQ sauce.  The BBQ sauce was served warm (interesting) and was excellent with the fried chicken!  Yummy!\\n\\nThe cream corn was my favorite side!  Delicious!  I was a little disappointed in the whipped potatoes because I expected it to be more creamy instead of slightly hard as if it was sitting out for a while.  The gravy definitely helped.  I also had a taste of the mac 'n cheese, which was decent but not amazing.\\n\\nI LOVED the Arnold Palmer!!!  The sweet tea+lemonade combo was the perfect blend of sweet and tangy, which was exactly what I enjoy with southern fried chicken (thinking back to Lisa's Delight at Roscoe's in L.A.).  I was sure to get a refill and a to-go cup before I left.\\n\\nI thought that I would be able to finish my food (I eat a LOT), but I was only able to eat two legs and a little of each side, and I was stuffed.  I guess I had a little too much complimentary bread - but I wanted to try a bit of each!  =)  I had to take the rest to-go, but I love leftovers so this was not a problem.\\n\\nOverall, the service was good (everyone is very friendly) and the food was good, but I'm knocking off one star because it wasn't quite the most amazing food experience I've had.  But I will definitely be back - and I can't wait!

There's plenty of seating and the place is very clean. \\n\\nThe chicken was pretty good and a reasonable price. I would have to say that the sides are what make the food experience great. The yuca fries, fried plantains, mashed potatoes, basmati rice were all great, making it tough to choose what you want when ordering a combo meal. They have family dinners (Whole chicken with 2 or 4 sides) which can make this place a really good value if you and 3 others get full off of a quarter chicken. \\n\\nThe place that makes this place 5 stars is the customer service. Yes I said you do all the work yourself (get your utensils, clean your table, and all that). But the workers are very nice and helpful. They let us sample each of the different sides while we mulled our decision and told us how everything was prepared, even told us some of the spices in the chicken rub. The one main guy was very friendly and was genuinely excited to have us come try their food. The workers would also come up and down the aisles asking us if we needed anything, something that never happens at a fast food place.\\n\\nSo yes, this place may be 3.5-4 in food, but gets that extra edge for being one of the bette chicken places in north austin and having a great atmosphere because of the customer service."},{"name":"NaraDeva Thai Restaurant","address":"4696 Millenia Plz Way","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"This is the best Thai restaurant I've ever been to.

I can say without a doubt that I've discovered cardiovascular health's new arch-nemesis: his name is Frank.\\n\\nI'll be perfectly honest and admit that it wasn't the dogs that drew me into Frank.  I've been searching for an Austin eatery that can make up a good dish of poutine for months.  When I heard that it was on the menu at Frank, nonetheless with waffle fries, I had to stop by to give it a go.  Plus, I'm a huge fan of Little Chicago; from all I had heard Frank was chalked up to be as good or better.  Nothing could go wrong!  Well, save for a heart attack, but who's really keeping a Weight Watchers journal with them at a place like this?\\n\\nWe stopped in on Tuesday in the middle of the evening and the spot wasn't exactly hustlin' & bustlin'.  Regardless, the atmosphere was very inviting and spoke of a place that took itself seriously enough to uphold an image, but definitely a comfortable one.  I can pronounce everything I see on the menu at Frank, and I like that.  Water was brought to us in mason jars--that was a pretty cute touch.  I decided to not be too adventurous and got the Plain Dog with caramelized onions.  My friend got the Slaw Dog with baked beans.  Of course, we also got an order of the waffle fry poutine to split.  Our food was out in an instant and nothing tasted rushed in the kitchen.  My beef was warmed perfectly and had a nice bite to it; the taste was full-bodied and not too unlike the dogs I've had at Little Chicago.  I can see where Frank would be a messy place to eat if one were to have a little more fun with their toppings, but we had plenty of napkins brought to us.  I can't comment on the Slaw Dog personally, but if \\"mmmm...MMMMMHMMMM\\" is any indication, my friend enjoyed it a fair deal.  The poutine was awesome and exactly what I was looking for.  Seriously, if you've not had this dish, make it a point to go out to 4th and Colorado and fill your stomach with it.  Actually, just go to Frank right now.  It really is that good.  I can't comment on the cocktails, but the drink selection was astounding and I saw a lot of things I'd never dreamed could exist.\\n\\nIn short: going to Frank is likely tastier (and maybe even cheaper, if you're only getting the dogs) than firing up the grill, plus you get to eat your food in a really chill space with friendly waitstaff, decent music, and a pleasant number of variations on a tried and true dish.

The sauce was jarred, or their best effort at duplicating a jarred sauce, and the pasta was overcooked. Boring as hell presentation, unappetizing.

I was disappointed at first, but quickly realized that I should try other things on the menu and not stick to the same items I always order.  The halibut is very simple and only comes with lemon and olive oil.  Sometimes simple is best.  The fish was cooked perfectly and I really loved it.  My friends will tell you that I am not a fish person.  In fact, I go out of my way to avoid eating fish when dining out.  The fact that I am raving about a piece of fish is a big deal.\\n\\nThe others in my party had the halibut, duck fat poached swordfish, seared yellowfin tuna, and roasted chicken.  The only person less than completely satisfied with their entree was the chicken person.  She does not eat any kind of seafood so her options were slightly limited.  I'd say stick to the seafood here.\\n\\nWe also ordered a few sides to share: shoestring fries served with malt vinegar aoli, hushpuppies, and basmati fried rice.  I liked the fried rice the best.  Make sure you get some.  Beware that the hushpuppies are served with powdered sugar and cane sugar butter.  They are not your usual hushpuppies.\\n\\nThe highlight of the meal was dessert.  We got a few orders of beignets.  Not as good as what you would get in New Orleans, but very, very good.  A few people also took some orders home in a bag and said that they were still good the next day.  I ordered the ice cream flavor of the day.  It was a cookie dough - I think it was oatmeal cookie, but I can't remember exactly.  All I remember is that it was so freaking good.  You'd think that I would remember the actual type because it was so good, but I think that I went into a food coma from all of the delicious food.\\n\\nService was outstanding.

It's one more place I can indulge in my noodle frenzies. Ganko Ittetsu did not necessarily disappoint, but there were some low-points to our Monday evening.\\n\\nLocation: It's tucked within the Coolidge Corner Arcade Center, which is between a comic book store and a jewelry shop. There are few seatings available outside the restaurant to rest your tired legs and mind after waiting for 25min+ for a table, but you'll have to fight with all the other fatigued patrons-to-be for it. All else fail, maybe stop by to get your eyebrows shaped at the threading salon next door.\\n\\nDecor: There is a reason why you're waiting so long; it's small! And you know what's smaller? The kitchen! Unless there is a secret tunnel around the corner, what you see is what you get. Overall, an intimate ambiance that's more suited for a few friends. Definitely not an ideal place for a large party. \\n\\nMenu: As small as the restaurant. Only a limited choice of appetizers and (currently) no alcohol to serve. There are three types of ramen; shoyu, tan tan, and miso. Not an extensive menu by all means, but I don't mind, since it means that they put all their time and energies perfecting their MVPs: ramen.  \\n\\nService: When I was there, there were only one server, one food runner, and two (?) chefs (someone among this small group must also clean dishes then). That's about the entire staff. This may explain why they do not partake in the customary \\"Irasshaimase!\\", as all their efforts are spent struggling to keep up with their numerous duties. Best to keep an understanding mindset on the service portion of your time.\\n\\nFood: I order the Tan Tan ramen, hence I'm reviewing just the Tan Tan. As one Yelper mentioned, the noodles are imported from a well I established noodle factory in Japan. Which makes sense, because the noodles were close to perfection; perfect texture, perfect bounce, and just the right amount of thickness. As for the broth, mmmmmm. I can taste the intricate flavor profile performing a well-rehearsed dance on my tongue, with the balance and ease that I've come to expect from my broths. My one criticism for the broth (and maybe it was just my bowl) is that I ordered the Tan Tan expecting it to be relatively spicy. Nope. No burning sensation or combustion of the taste bud. Not even a cute little tingle. And I wish that was the only problem, but unfortunately, my toppings also left a lot to be desired. First off, no runny eggs. Immediate sadness. Secondly, I am stuck with these tiny balls of ground pork, floating around like single buoys in a vast ocean of broth. When I asked about this, they said that it'll require extra greens for an egg and real slabs of chashu. Quite disappointing, as I'm already paying $13 for a medium size bowl (did I mention no obligatory runny eggs!? I'm still sad thinking about it).\\n\\nOverall, decent establishment. All three of my stars are pretty much for the noodles and broth. I would come back once a while, but only if I'm in the area.

The tomatoes were fresh, delicious, and not that nasty salmon color like the tomatoes you get at some restaurants because they were locally grown and not forced to ripen. The chipotle sauce was DEEELICIOUS! I wasn't that impressed with the veggie patty though. I thought it was too thick, a little too dry, and the flavor wasn't really impressive. However, when I dunked each bite into the chipotle sauce the sandwich in it's entirety was very satisfying. I'm going to give them the benefit of the doubt. Maybe it was an off day for the burger. Overall, the sandwich was still very good. \\n\\nI had the Asian slaw as my side dish. This was yummy too. The vegetables were fresh and crispy.

I was willing to go just about anywhere for it too, and since it was a work trip, the meal cost itself was of little concern to me.  I asked a few friends who were originally from Atlanta to give me a few recommendations on where to throw down my per diem.  Two Urban Licks came up as a place that a friend of mine called his \\"absolute favorite\\" place to eat in Atlanta.  Since they were able to accommodate a party of 6, we all hopped into a cab and headed over to what seemed to be the most random location ever for a restaurant.\\n\\nOnce getting there, we sat towards the back towards the al fresco dining area and did some serious people watching.  My co-workers and I all had a specialty cocktail to start off the night, I chose the Peach Julep. My drink was sweet, delicious, refreshing, but was a little lacking on the bourbon.  Our waiter was courteous and gave us the rundown on what's popular on the menu and his recommendations.  After debating and deciding, we decided to share an order of the salmon chips and calamari.\\n\\nA couple of thoughts on these two apps:\\n-Salmon chips: I sometimes like being surprised when it comes to ordering, and when the salmon chips came out, I couldn't be more surprised.  It is literally a potato chip with shredded salmon on top! I normally hate salmon. In fact, I usually make a point to avoid it.  Since everyone was trying it though, I took a bite out of this, and determined that this was absolutely amazing.  Seriously. If it can get a \\"wow\\" out of me, then you should totally get it.\\n\\n-Calimari: Your standard fried stuff, but glazed with a sweet and sour glaze.  The general consensus on this is that it was good, but not anything that was dramatically life-changing.  One person mentioned that it was too sweet, other people said it was just a standard calimari app, but I thought it was pretty good!  If it's between these two, definitely go for the salmon chips.\\n\\nOk, onto the entrees.  I won't get into what everyone at my table ate, but it included the scallops, brisket, duck, and in my case, the bistro steak.  The dish came with a healthy portion of green beans and mushrooms, and an AMAZING amount of chimichurri sauce to go with the steak.  My steak was cooked perfectly, and made it a point to make sure I got as much of the chimichurri sauce on my steak as I could.  My main takeaway on this was that, it was a completely solid dish.  Nothing that would qualify as something I've never had before, but most definitely delicious.\\n\\nFinally, what's a group dinner without dessert?  And what happens when you can't get a group to decide on one dessert? YOU GET TWO. duh. We opted for the pumpkin chocolate brownie topped with hazelnuts and fresh whipped cream, and the cheesecake.  Between the two, I definitely enjoyed the brownie the most.  I would HIGHLY recommend this!\\n\\nSo, as a visitor to Atlanta, who was in desperate need of high quality food, Two Urban Licks definitely hit the spot.  A couple things that are noteworthy: \\n-the smoke smell from the restaurant isn't great, and is something I could have done without, but I get that it adds to the whole place\\n-the decor and restaurant itself it decorated in a way that reminds me of a restaurants in LA or Miami\\n-our server really put in the effort for our table and even split our checks 6 ways\\n\\nthanks for the hospitality Two Urban Licks!"},{"name":"Bouldin Creek Cafe","address":"1900 S 1st St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Love, love, love the food and atmosphere here.

And even then, it was only because we had flagged him down to let him know we were ready to order. The menu is very extensive and has just about something for everyone.\\n\\nThe food came out fast and in a flurry. Lots of yumminess all around. I highly recommend the Salt & Pepper Squid (aka Fried Calamari). The meat is chewy but not tough. It's fried to perfection with no greasy residue. Then it's tossed in salt, pepper, and just enough hot pepper to satisfy your palette. No sauce or any other flavoring required. It was probably the best dish of the night. The crispy fried tofu was also really good. Here's a hint on how to eat it: make a hole in the middle of the tofu square, then put the soy sauce in the middle of the hole and let it permeate into the rest of the tofu. Let it sit for a minute or so, then devour. \\n\\nFor a party of six, we got 6-7 dishes and the bill for the night came to under $70 for the food. You certainly can't go wrong with that! I've been to many many Chinese restaurants (result of Chinese parents who refuse to eat anything other than Chinese food when we go out), and this was comparable, if not better than a lot of places I've been to in Chinatown.

So I was nervous. Would the food be good? How was the service? Could they accommodate a group this size?\\n\\nImagine my surprise and delight when I had what had to be one of the best meals I've had in the Portland area. Let me elaborate.\\n\\nThe president of my group called ahead and booked us a table for 14. I was one of the last ones to arrive, so I rushed in and found someone who directed me to the table of my group and flagged the waiter down to bring me water and take my drink order.\\n\\nI ordered a nice glass of red wine and had a seat at the table. It was at this point that my one and only complaint emerged. The place was LOUD and we couldn't really talk to the people across the table. There was music going on and the place was packed. Made for a fun atmosphere, but not the kind of place you go to conduct business.\\n\\nThe service was outstanding. The waiter took the time to explain everything to us, from what the dishes were to what was in the selection of dipping sauce brought to the table. He was patient and attentive.\\n\\nThe food was AMAZING. I had never been here before and I'm not always the most adventurous eater, so I was nervous ordering. I went from the tuna since I knew I enjoyed that. Everything on the plate was perfectly cooked and balanced in flavor. There was this stuff that kinda tasted like corn bread, but with a little more salt. The tuna was just seared to the perfect temperature. Oh, and I noticed that other people at my table asked for substitutions, which they did gladly.\\n\\nWhen it came time to pay the bill, the server had no complaints about running several different cards, as well accepting cash. Honestly, those of us paying on cards had it much easier. There is a mandatory tip of 18% (if I recall correctly) and it was easier to figure this out for those of us with cards.\\n\\nSo Andina, you have proven me wrong.

The pizzas are large and we could've easily gotten by with two pies however our hosts ordered three to be sure everyone had plenty of choice and that the two college kids would have food to take home. One pie was loaded with deliciously prepared egg plant (and although I tasted it and it was very good it just isn't pizza for me) but many of our party enjoyed it immensely. Then there was the pepperoni and cheese pizza which I partook of. It took me back to my childhood days in Detroit where we would go up to Shaffer / 8 mile road --and get the best pizza ever. Home Slice makes their tasty pepperoni really thin sliced, so it actually crisps up in the oven- it was just excellent. Just the right amount of cheese and sauce! \\nThen there was a pizza that was half-and-half, the first half mushroom and Italian sausage which looked delicious and those that ate it, said that in fact it was delicious, the other half spinach marinated red peppers-( I didn't try that one either I was so enamored with the pepperoni I just couldn't,) but those that did claimed it excellent as well.\\nOur service was 5 star-beverages were kept full and we were checked on often enough. My observation is that around 4 PM or so it was not quite as crowded although there were still a small group of people waiting. Our servers were very gracious providing clean plates and silverware, candles, and a lighter so we could sing happy birthday to Hannah and enjoy some homemade cake made by a dear friend. Those of us in attendance enjoyed-it!\\nI do need to report that when my husband and I got back to our vehicle which we had parked three blocks away we had a ticket waiting for us. Not being so familiar with Austin, we had no idea that the little signs at the beginning of the block said that the parking was for the neighborhood residents. $25 fee and live and learn but I have now decided Austin as a city is about as rude as it gets. We had made sure we were not blocking any part of a driveway nor near a fire hydrant, who would've thought that,  that far away there would be that type of regulation?\\nAnyhow although that dampened my spirits And I will avoid Austin as best as I possibly can in the future, I will still be a patron at Home Slice. They actually have a whole separate building for take out... so we will either do that or go to the newer location that has better parking.\\nWe highly recommend Home Slice Pizza!"},{"name":"Voodoo Doughnut - Old Town","address":"22 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Coolest donut shop on the planet!

When we ordered, I wanted to order a nonbreakfast item and the waitress/owner indicated they don't serve that during this time. We then informed them that they advertised full menu served all day and she just scoffed and walked away. We tried to say it tactfully, and in the end indicated that it is okay and we will just order breakfast items. Then the chef came out to talk to us and said \\"what items do you want (nonbreakfast)\\" in a manner that felt like we were burdening him. We explained that we have no problems just ordering breakfast items but that they should change the statement on their webpage because it was not true. We really were trying to be nice about it but we felt like we were burdening them. \\n\\nAlthough the way they handled this was not impressive, we will try them again because I really want to support local businesses.

It accommodates  large groups (two to eight) as well as lonely burger fiends, well.\\n\\nThings to know.\\n*****\\nI. LOCATION & PARKING: Find Grindhouse Burger on the often-busy Piedmont Avenue, across the street from both Dunkin Donuts and Sprouts, and next door to Mint Car Wash. They have their own lot, which wraps around the building. Overflow parking exists on the streets moving north and south perpendicular to Piedmont. \\n\\nII. FOOD & DRINK: Patrons can either build their burger or try one of their creations. They also have different starters/ bar snacks, side, salads, chili, hot dogs, desserts, and drinks. They accommodate kids (Rugrats section of their menu), vegans, vegetarians, and those with a gluten intolerance. Oh, and they have boozey shakes as well as robust beer and cocktail selections. \\n\\nI tried a double *Impossible Burger ($10), a plant-based meat substitute, topped with swiss cheese ($.50), mushrooms ($.50), and greens. The burger tasted like actual meat -- due to the heme-like substance found in peas-- and loved every umami-filled bite. I didn't find the buns memorable, but it does its job well. \\n\\nFor a side, I tasted their no mayo Carolina Cole Slaw ($2.99). I think it was fine. The sweet vinegar dressing balanced out my decadent burger, well. \\n\\nI did enjoy munching on their Crinkle Cut French Fries ($2.50), which they didn't over bake, but I prefer the thick Vidalia Onion Rings ($2.99).\\n\\nIII. SERVICE: I went during lunchtime on the weekend, and it took about 45 minutes from waiting in line to receiving the food. I think they could improve by having multiple lines, honestly. I saw people leave, and that's lost money. However, they're friendly, and I didn't mind the wait.\\n\\nIV. AMBIANCE & DECOR: The industrial-inspired restaurant can host large groups, both inside and out. The patio has automatic windows, which slowly accordion up. Sports play on their TVs. \\n\\nV. PRICES: Compared to other places in the Atlanta, they're way more affordable than other above-average burger joints.\\n\\nVI. OVERALL: I wouldn't go out of my way to eat at Grindhouse, but if one of their several locations resides in your hood -- and you love burgers -- I'd check it out at least once.

Sure, when you got a box of freshly baked Voodoo donuts, there's really no competition for their donuts -- but how often did that actually happen? Most of the time, I had to make do with staleish donuts. And I always had to deal with that loud, unruly line in the middle of the rain. I thought that Voodoo was one of those places that was only really ever amazing when you were drunk, but kinda meh for all the rest of the time.\\n\\nSince moving down to San Francisco, I've only now realized how hard it is to achieve the perfect balance of creativity and deliciousness when it comes to donuts.

I stopped in for lunch at random while on business in Orlando, and didn't have lofty expectations. I just wanted hot food with good quality and taste. My choices were either a Golden Coral, Starbucks, or Miller's Ale House. Obviously, I chose the latter. \\n\\nThe lunch menu had a good assortment of choices, yet I didn't want anything too heavy or light. I chose a jambalaya, complimented by shrimp that I had hoped would be close to Bonefish Grill's Bang Bang shrimp variety. The shrimp was my sole expectation, and the sauce that the shrimp arrived in left me disappointed. I wound up having three different type of sauce samples until I said the heck with it, and finished the shrimp just for nourishment. The shrimp is called Boom Boom here, and the only Boom Boom that I experienced was a quick trip to the bathroom for a bowel movement due to my stomach not agreeing with the taste. The Miller's Ale House bathroom walls certainly echoed of the natural noises of 1812 Overture cannon fire explosions for a few minutes that day, no thanks to its Boom Boom shrimp entree.\\n\\nThe jambalaya, of course, did not disappointment. Yet let's be honest- its really hard to mess up Jambalaya, unless you go overboard with the amount of peppers and seasoning that the entree was prepared in. Miller's jambalaya entree was just about right- seasoned correctly where you can taste every flavor, as well as having just enough to invoke a few tears mixed with bliss & pain from your eye. \\n\\nComplimenting the meal with an IPA draft, I think that my lunch bill came to about $32 or so before tip. Again, not bad. The restaurant decor is not bad. Hardly one of those cheap ale houses that haven't updated their interiors since the 1980s.

They didn't have a table when we arrived and we were promptly sent out to the liquor store across Buford Highway. Capital idea. \\n\\nSo the ordering process was quite a process. It is very clear that the owner is passionate about making sure you'll get something he thinks you like.

We all were so being newbies, they offered a free sampling of their potlicker (a collard greens based soup) served with corn bread which is meant to be crumbled into the soup.  It was simply delicious and warmed my soul!  Whoever came up with this idea deserved to be kissed. They also brought out a big bread basket filled with dinner rolls, corn bread and some super scrumptous sweet cinamon rolls.  After starting out so great I was excited to try the food we ordered.  \\n\\nFor appetizers, we started with fried green tomatoes with horse radish sauce which were good.  Then came our entrees which came with our choice of two sides each.  I had the Fried Chicken with a couple of sides (baked tomatoe pie, macaroni and cheese).  It came with four large pieces of chicken; drumstick, breast and two wings (where's the thigh?).  It was good, but not great as the chicken was not piping hot when it came out nor was it crispy and golden.  The color was bland and the flavor was just not quite there.  The baked tomatoe pie was good but the macaroni and cheese was a lot better.  Not as great as the one served at King Fish but very good notheless.  \\n\\nMy other two co workers ordered catfish (cheese grits & don't remember) and Fried Gulf prawns (don't remember her sides...hey it was a long week away from home).  Those were good, but not great either.\\n\\nFor dinner we came back two days later for our last meal in town together.  There were 6 of us and we all ordered together the all you can eat family style meal where you get to choose 3 entrees and 3 sides to share and your choice of individual dessert.  We chose fried chicken, meat loaf, and chicken dumplings.  For the sides we did collared greens, mac & cheese, and *my memory isshot*.  I liked the chicken dumplings a lot!  Meat loaf was good, and the chicken I've already reviewed.  There was sooooo much food that as a group we couldn't order another round.\\n\\nOverall the food was good, but not great.  I think what would have made it better is if the food came out piping hot vs being luke warm.  i give it another half star though because of Jo, their \\"Goodwill Ambassador.\\"  She's a sweet old lady that goes around and give everyone a backrub while she talks to table and crack jokes with you.

The first mistake was that our waiter brought our entrees BEFORE the salad.  After we pointed this out, our waiter was not apologetic but assured us he would bring us our salads right away.   He asked us whether he should take our entrees back, and thinking that they would just find themselves under heat lamp, we elected to continue to eat our entrees.  I ordered the Linguine All' aragosta.  My wife ordered the Salmon.  The quality of both was simply horrible.  I have microwaved up better meals from the frozen food section of stop and shop.  My Linguine had sauce that strongly resembled watered down Ragu.  My wife's salmon still tasted frozen and processed.  \\n\\n20 minutes are salad appeared, and both were equally mediocre.  The real problem was that our waiter never bussed the table.  We barely had enough room to maneuver around with all the plates on our tiny table.  I've never been at a restaurant at any price point with service this bad.  \\n\\nDespite all of this, we decided to share a desert, as it was our anniversary after all.  We ordered a desert with an apricot glaze, and told the waiter we were allergic to tree fruit, and could we have the desert with no apricot glaze.  10 minutes later and you guessed it, he bring us the desert with apricot glaze.  I did have to impressed on how he had succesfully screwed up every aspect of the meal, at least he gets points for consistency.  We sent it back, and eventually got a very mediocre desert sans apricot glaze.  \\n\\nAfter we ate, we went over to another side of restaurant to check out the view we were not able to enjoy.  There were diners at one table in the section, otherwise it was empty.  We were then talked to by a very rude waiter who told us not to bother the diners and that we had too leave.  This was quite insulting to be treated like a learing tourist after dropping $200 on horrible food and horrible service.  \\n\\nBoston has so many fantastic dining options at a fraction of the price.  There is absolutely no reason to go here.  We wouldn't go again if they paid us."},{"name":"Stix Noodle and Grill","address":"903 Commercial Drive","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"The service at Stix is always friendly.

Coconut shrimp (plate of 4) - I'm normally not a fan of this because, good lawd, they can be so deep fried and battered that you can neither taste the coconut or the shrimp - but this was OUTSTANDING.  The coconut tastes like someone freshly picked and grated a coconut into the batter.  You don't even need the dipping sauce, it's fantastic on it's own\\n2. Lobster Wonton (plate of 3) - This is made of crack and the blueberry sauce and caviar on top is delicious.  The only comment that I would make is that it was hard to get the lobster flavor with so many other factors going on - especially considering the fried wonton to lobster ratio wasn't as high as I expected.  Nontheless, delicious\\n3. Sea bass - A colleague ordered this but after 1 bite I immediately regretted my fried chicken choice (very tender and good; but oh-so-heavy and taste-wise nothing that blew me away; just an excellent cut of chicken with mac-n-cheese).  Anyways back to the sea bass, I've never tasted it prepared like that before and I would come back just so I can order a whole one for myself; it was equal parts sassy (spice - but not overly because I am sensitive), sweet (no idea where that comes from!!!) and tender.  \\n\\nNothing out of the ordinary:\\nOur table also ordered the steamed dumplings, fried chicken entree, and lobster fried rice but those didn't make my list.  \\n\\nDelicious but \\"standard\\" (definition: the taste of it isn't anything you wouldn't expect from an exceptional version of whatever the dish is):\\nFor dessert we ordered the red velvet cake - a GIGANTIC (completely surprised us) 5 layer red velvet that was so moist we ate a good portion even though we were all stuffed.

Yes, I'm glad I went here, but I'm not sure it's something I'd go out of my way for.\\n\\nI had the Portland Cream and the Viscous Hibiscus.\\n\\nPORTLAND CREAM (4/5)\\n- Good filling, but not too filled\\n- Average chocolate doughnut taste\\n- Pretty good size for the price\\n\\nVISCOUS HIBISCUS (3/5)\\n- Really sweet, but I don't know what else to expect\\n- Half sprinkles looks good, but kinda awkward to eat\\n- Huge doughnut!\\n\\nI was a huge fan of the service! Even with the line, the cashier was really helpful and explained some of the doughnuts. We were able to order our doughnuts and get out of the store pretty quickly. We didn't know that this shop was Cash Only, but luckily, I had some cash on me. Important to know before you come. I think the novelty of this place is great, but I'm not sure I'd come back again.

(I drive past this location every single day on the way to and from work, unless Waze tells me not to.) On top of that, knowing how much I love food people have told me to go...and for some reason I've just never made time.\\n\\nEnter ATL Burger Week 2018. What a great excuse to finally pop in! Turns out, it was SUPER easy to convince the BF, super easy to get over here, easy to park and to order... It turns out the hardest part of this whole thing was to take my time to enjoy the burger and not eat it like some sort of voracious animal. \\n\\nJust as you'd expect, Grindhouse is a fast-casual restaurant. You order and pay at the counter, take a number, and then take a seat. The waitstaff will deliver alcoholic beverages and food. (Fountain drinks, silverware, condiments, etc. are self-serve.)\\n\\nThe interior of this location reminds me of a 50s-style diner, but WAY cooler. They've got high tops, a long bar counter, and upholstered booths lining the windows. They project vintage films onto the back wall and simultaneously play them on a handful of flatscreens. \\n\\nBack to the food - both the BF and I tried the \\"Grindhouse Style Junior Burger\\" (the Burger Week special). Grindhouse offers 1/4 lb (\\"Junior\\") and 1/2 lb (\\"Double\\") burgers in a variety of styles. This is obviously their signature style, and comes with a single beef patty, medium, topped with American cheese, grilled onions, pickles, lettuce and signature Grindhouse Sauce, on a toasted potato bun. The Grindhouse Sauce was a bit mayonnaise-y to me, but then I don't eat much mayo! This burger normally comes for $5.50. \\n\\nThey serve fat crinkle fries (which I love) and shakes (which I have yet to try - but have my eye on for next time). \\n\\nOverall, we really enjoyed Grindhouse and would definitely come back to try some different variations on the burger.

Well, to make a long story short, after that insult to my taste buds, I couldn't stop thinking about the Corned Beef Sandwiches at Brother's Deli of Lynn, which had initially come to mind when presented with Persey's challenge.\\n\\nBrothers of Lynn is sort of an old fashioned cafeteria style restaurant. You enter the line, picking up a tray and silverware (unless you're getting to go), and move along through the cold and hot stations where attendants will serve whatever items you choose. The first station is the sandwich board, where you specify the details of sandwiches, salads and other short-order items.\\n\\nBesides the excellent Corned Beef, there are several specialty sandwiches (all are $5.75) with names like \\"Madison\\" and \\"Scollay Square\\" that add various ingredients in classic combinations that result in delicious sandwiches. Today, I chose the \\"New Yorker\\", which adds Coleslaw, Swiss Cheese, and Russian Dressing to a hefty portion of lean and tender Corned Beef. Of course, such a perfect sandwich comes with a perfect dill pickle.\\n\\nFor an additional $2.75, I added a side of Potato Salad. It's actually a huge bowl of Potato Salad, and very delicious too. Not just dreary chunks of potato with too much mayonnaise, Brothers of Lynn's Potato Salad is a creamy mixture of potato chunks and mashed potatoes, seasoned with a tangy dressing that makes it very yummy.\\n\\nMy bottom line comparison of the awful sandwich in Plymoth, was that if Brothers of Lynn's Corned Beef Sandwich rated four stars, that place didn't deserve even one. And today, my taste buds were indeed reassured that corned beef does not have to be dried up and horrible.\\n\\nSo there, Persey. If you don't believe me, just try comparing your Corned Beef Sandwich to Brother's of Lynn..... please!"},{"name":"Folk Art Restaurant","address":"465 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Awesome breakfast spot!

After the food arrived and we began to eat (after confirming verbally that our meals were gluten free) I felt that the rice paper wrap on one of my sushi rolls tasted weird, so we finally waved our waiter down to ask and after checking with the kitchen he confirmed that it wasn't gluten free, and said they'd replace it.

Oh Gawd pleaseee don't want to get out of the line and start from 100 again. Luckily we had a $20 bill using which we got the donuts. When it comes to taste, I would say it was decent but definitely not worth the Hype. Another major problem here is the Parking. Because this place is always having the long queue, finding a parking is almost impossible. Personally I felt the Sunrise Donuts in Redmond tasted better than the VooDoo Donuts.

They said we had to wait for half an hour to get seated (we didnt think to make reservations) but they seated us within ten minutes which was sweet!\\n\\nWe had the fried oysters, which also came with fried jalape√±os, lemons and a coriander dressing. We ate it all, even the lemon slices, they tasted fantastics. We also had the crab toast which was superb. The crab meat tasted fresh and juicy, worked great with the avocado and radish. Then we had the charred octopus with lentils, avocado and garlic aioli. I havent had much octopus in my days, but it was tougher than Ive previously had it, and im not sure if that's because it was charred. It still tasted great, and was such a great combination with the lentils. Hmm. Then we finished with the cauliflower gratin. Gruyere? Yes. Garlic crumble? Yes. I wanted to dive in there, it was lovely. \\n\\nThe only thing on our 'cons' list was that even though our server/bartender guy was very nice and attentive, all four of our dishes got sent to the wrong couple while someone elses food kept getting sent to us. You'd think that after messing up once or twice they'd double or triple check to make sure everything went to the right place, but that wasn't the case here. It wasn't a huge deal breaker, and i suppose they're still fresh and figuring things out, and im hopeful they'll smooth things out soon. Also, when you order a beer you get a koozie.

Also in Chicago, Manhattan and Pittsburgh.\\nI am gluten free, although I was not when I ate in Chicago, Manhattan and Pittsburgh.\\nI am not sure I know what Neapolitan pizza tastes like.\\nI don't eat pig.\\n\\nOk, the fact that I don't eat pig or that I am gluten free is really not relevant to my pedigree, but relevant to the review. I had the gluten-free margherita pizza.\\n\\nIt just didn't do a whole ton for me particularly given the price point. It tasted underdone, flat and squishy. The cheese overwhelmed the other ingredients.  I've had thin crust floppy pizza before ( I think this is neopolitan?)  in NY and it was much better than this. I also tried my brothers (ok it had pig and gluten, but I did want a comparison point to my GF crust) and while it was considerably better, I still didn't think it was all that. I do think it all needed to be cooked more. Perhaps I can chalk this all up to most restaurants not knowing how to parkbake gluten-free crusts (they need at MINIMUM five minutes in a very hot oven) prior to topping.\\n\\nHowever, the service was awesome and the chefs at the pizza bar (where we sat) were so nice and clearly dedicated to their craft, and the atmosphere so interesting, and the altitude gave me a cheap buzz, so it was hard not to have a good time.

Cool hot dog/homemade sausage joint with an ingenious menu, ice cold beer with a twist (PBR, Coors yellow belly, Czech Rebel...), a specialty deli/grocery and an upstairs lounge (not yet complete), and serving gourmet coffee/tea with a full bar.\\n\\nThe decor is sort of warehouse district/North East Deli/antique store. From the vintage telephone booth in the front to the refrigeration unit circa 1930's located in the soon to be grocery area, this place has a cool atmosphere. Painted brick walls, large vintage signs about ice cold beer and hot dogs. Perfect vibe for what they are selling.\\n\\nAND what they are selling is a slight twist on the classic hot dog. They use Vienna All Beef dogs for their \\"hot dog\\" concoctions and they have an in-house artisan sausage maker for their wonderful homemade sausage combinations. They have a separate menu for daily specials that do not disappoint. . The food is just right! From the Hot Polish to the Jackalope. The Slaw Dog (topped with grilled horseradish cole slaw), to the Texalina (a pork and beef sausage topped with said slaw, white cheese and southern mustard BBQ sauce), all the ones I have tried are terrific! Try the Boudin Fritters.\\n\\nWhen it comes to the wait staff and personalities, they have struck gold! We have been served by Lucas, Caleb, Erin and Steve. All perfect to their craft.

After we started chatting he confessed he had \\"hit the wall\\" so to speak, but raved about his mussels.  Since I was starved, the aroma of the mussels swimming in garlic was enough to encourage this sketchy fish eater to share the Shore Plate with hubby.  Clam Chowder.  Mussels as described above.

I know the actual charcuterie is coming from Moody's and I went to Moody's yesterday.  Those dudes know what's up in the charcuterie world!  So given the volume and time dedication required to just hanging & curing time for charcuterie I would probably do the same.  \\n\\nBEEF TARTARE (CRUDO) \\nThis was exceptional.  Sauce gribiche is a classic delicious choice and the confit egg- which is cooked in beef fat was very creative and showed skill.  I will order this again.  It's been on the menu since day 1 - so if u are reading this it will be there ready to roll for you, too!\\n\\nYELLOWFIN CRUDO\\nI eat a ton of raw fish.  I'm extremely loyal to buying my fish from WULFS in Coolidge Corner.  This was a very fresh and delicious plate with fun components.

The fish tacos came with a green sauce and you could taste every flavor infused. I made sure to spritz my lime wedges over each Taco as well. The burrito was good too after we got rid of the cheese.

The turkey melt with fries is an absolute delight to have as a dinner / lunch option on this side of town. The tunes playing from the stereo are great, and what you would expect; however, perhaps not as good as the jukebox tunes like you have at the other (Ponce) location. \\n\\nThe decor is weird in a kitschy / throwback sort of way; surreal but perhaps a nod / homage to the former occupants of the space (Thai Lana). I am very much looking forward to the time when this place begins serving  alcohol. \\n\\nLike the other location, space along the bar will likely be tight (once alcohol materializes). Instead of having a steel support pole blocking a viable spot along the bar (like you have at Ponce) this place has a tree trunk thingy blocking a viable spot at the bar.

We ordered the lemongrass steamed mussels for our appetizer, then the seafood melange, the fried chicken with mac and cheese, and the duck dynasty.\\n\\nI think the food itself was a 4 star type of food. However, we waited so long for our orders - I would say 35-45 minutes, that I had to knock it down 1 star. The waitress was nice but she barely came to our table to even check our drinks or to give us an update on where our food was. She also took forever getting the check. Maybe it was just a busy night. I don't know. We were seated outside, so I couldn't tell. But it just took way too long. And our toddler can sit there for hours and be fine. I was the one that was getting a little frustrated since took so long.\\n\\nIn any case, the mussels were pretty good. Just a bit too salty for my liking. The seafood melange was delicious. The seafood was cooked well - not rubbery and seasoned well - not too salty. There was an ample amount of seafood so that's always great! The fried chicken with mac and cheese was also tasty. Not dry at all and the mac and cheese, our toddler approved. The duck was my husband's favorite. And I must admit, I was impressed with the duck. I typically don't like duck unless it's peking duck and even then, I only like it from one or two places. In any case, their duck was not gamey at all. Very nice.\\n\\nAnyway, I'm not sure if I would come back but it's definitely worth a visit. Maybe our waitress was just having on off night that night.

I decided to try the Jinya #3 - Sprouting Up Ramen ($12.95), which comes with pork chashu, brussels sprouts, egg & wood-ear mushrooms in a pork broth. The pork chashu was incredibly tender and flavorful, and the brussels sprouts added a nice and different flavor.

(Our server shared that they had 500 covers between Fri and Sat night. That's astounding for a restaurant of this size, isn't it?) And it's understandable that by Sunday, they were justified in being out of specials, and some sides. But when I asked for a glass of port...they were out of that as well, due to the Valentine weekend rush. Really? \\nI ordered the bibb salad, and it landed on the table frozen. Yes, I actually bit into the crunch of frozen lettuce leaves. My guess? My leftover, pre-made salad from the Valentine prep got pulled from the waaaay back of the walk-in. However, the server was quick to replace it with a \\"freshly made\\" version. (Aren't all salads freshly made?)\\nThe fried Brussel sprout appetizer was submerged in a gooey cheese dip that evoked past meals in airport lounges. However, the Sea Bass entree was perfectly cooked, and the accompanying fingerling potatoes, though a bit mature, were done to perfection.\\nDesserts, however, maintained the Big Chill. My companion ordered the \\nPeanut Butter and Chocolate Pie, which was so cold it required the use of a knife in order to carve off chunks for consumption. My White Chocolate Bread Pudding was nice and warm on the exterior with - yep - a chilly core that  must have been out of reach of the microwave's penetration. Finally, the addition of white chocolate \\"chips\\" sprinkled atop the slab of bread pudding only heightened to feeling that we were in a Cheesecake Factory, sans the over-attentive waitstaff.\\nWill I return to De Novo?

Some people might get bothered by this but I like to see what I believe to be a family working together like this.  My order was perfect and came out quickly.  Huge amount of perfect bacon.  I don't like my bacon charred or so crisp it is brittle.  This was cooked well but still limber!   Eggs were great and the hashbrowns were just right.  Crispy, not burned and not soggy.

Table visits by the server were few and far between as it progressed. Asked for side of jalapenos with the burger, never got those. Took 10 min and several server passes to get a coke. Thankfully we saved and bought a groupon to this place because it definitely wasn't  worth full price on top of that it took an additional 10 min to have someone come and push the used voucher button on my phone to pay out. Had to interrupt cell phone usage to get that. Wouldn't have noticed all of this so much if the food was up to par. Appetizer the shrimp and crab dip was broken as the cream sauce separated while we ate it. Burger was overcooked and mealy, fries were hot though.

I admit it; I made fun of my roommate for driving all the way to Boulder for pizza (we live in Denver) but she raved about this place. Her and her boyfriend asked if I would accompany them to Pizzeria Locale for my birthday dinner and of course I said, \\"yes please!\\" \\n\\nWe decided to go on Monday night and the place was rocking at 8:00 pm. We were quoted a 45 minute wait time so we went to Frasca for a drink. I had the Occhi Luminosi, which was the perfect summer cocktail and a great way to kill some time.\\n\\nWe finished our cocktails a bit early and went back to Pizzeria Locale to wait for our table. Fortunately, it didn't take long and we were seated in a cute little table close to the kitchen. We started off with the beet salad, vesuvius, and the artigianale. The beet salad was good but I'm not a huge fan of beets, so there you go. The Vesuvius (Caprese salad) was nice but I don't think that I've ever had a bad Caprese salad. Finally, the Artigianale was great. It has a nice tangy flavor that said, \\"hey taste buds, wake up and love the world of food.\\" I would say the only downside of this dish was that it was a bit difficult to eat.  \\n\\nNow, for the pizza!! Are you excited? I know I am!!  I can honestly tell you that I have thought about this pizza multiple times over the last five days. Arrrggghhh, \\"Boulder, why do you have to be so far?\\"  We picked three pizzas; the Mais, the Funghi, and the Diavola. The Diavola was spicy. I like the spice so I was in. It was good but the Funghi rocked my mushroom pizza loving world. MMMmmm, speaking of rocking worlds, let's just discuss this beautiful thing Pizzeria Locale likes to call the Mais; corn and creme fraiche on a pizza with prosciutto cotto equals interesting and downright delightful. Please, do yourself a favor and go to Pizzeria Locale right now and order this pizza!!\\n\\nSo Denverites, the moral of the story is sometimes driving 30 minutes for pizza isn't crazy.

It wasn't as funny by the time the girl walked over from bagging the food several minutes later. Enough time had passed that four other groups were also waiting now behind us. It looks like they might have been short staffed, but saying they'd be with us in a second would have gone a long way towards making the wait to order better. It's weird that you'd just flat out ignore the large line with a dozen people like you can't even see it.\\n\\nThe food was pretty good.

The pretzel there is huge and different with its sweet taste.  I enjoyed the beer soaked brat wrapped in the Frank flap jacket instead of a bun.  At first, it came out with an extra well done jacket (ie, burned), I said something, and the waiter quickly brought me out the dog in a nicely cooked jacket. Yay for service! The texlina was good too, and the notorious PIG was another winner. Their mac n cheese was just the way I like it.
