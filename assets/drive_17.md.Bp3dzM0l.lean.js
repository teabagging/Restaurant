They provide you with a writable menu so you can select the quantity next to the items you want. Easy right? No, because everything sounded great. The waiter informed us that the tacos were bite-size. Depending on your food portion I would recommend 3-5 tacos, 2 sides and an appetizer to share. If you are in a group, order a variety of tacos for the table and 1-2 sides per person. 2) Our waiter informed us that it was family style. No one knew what the heck that was until the food came out. The food runner basically came to our table and said  what's in their hand. They didn't know who it was for and many times that didn't know what type of taco it was.

The Prime Time is a clean tasting, simple burger, where the beef is called Texas Akaushi, not true Akaushi, and the Brie Cheese on it is light, not overbearing. Overall, the burger was tasteful and not heavy at all. The wife's had pesto, most likely house-made. A bit on the heavier side, maybe bc I had mine first, then hers. Also, remember that arugula is a light tasting green, instead of the typical iceberg lettuce that many places use. So it may be that. As for a drink, I got the Vanilla Bean Milkshake, and she got the Ginger Lemonade. Pass on the milkshake. Maybe it's bc we're ruined by artifical flavorings and other things.

After waiting for 10-15 minutes to be served, we changed our mind and returned back to the counter to place a to-go order. We ordered two sandwiches and two coffees. When they tried to run my credit card they were unable to give me a receipt. I was little peeved about this and just asked that they write the amount charged on a piece of paper. I still don't know if I got charged or how much I actually got charged. \\n\\nThen after waiting for another 10-15 minutes a different man, who I think is in charge of the bakery, asked us if we had been helped. After explaining our wait time, he got us our coffee. However, we had asked for the coffee to go, instead they gave it to us in a cup. We decided not to make a big deal about it since we were still waiting for the sandwiches, but this was another mix-up. \\n\\nFinally after waiting another 10-15 minutes, they must have felt sorry for us, and gave us a pastry on the house. We tried the brownies and cupcakes, which were delicious, but not the best thing on an empty stomach. \\n\\nFinally after more than an hour and another refill, we finally had our sandwiches to go. They come in a nice bag and nice container, that I would recommend keeping. We were so hungry at this point; we just ate the sandwiches at the bakery. \\n\\nSo bottom line is that the sandwiches are really good, and the cupcakes and brownies are also really good (though a bit pricy).

I did try the Sweaty Hipster as well, not much of a drink for the price tag. Our complaints list was small starting with the black eyed peas. Neither of us really liked the baked bean spin on the dish. Service while acceptable had issues as well.

I won't hear anything to the contrary. I've been to the original locations in Tennessee (former Memphian) and was pleased as punch to find out there was a location here when I moved to Austin.\\n\\nEverything here is just as delicious as it is at the original locations (the Mason location is the original, the one in downtown Memphis was the second). The atmosphere here is very reminiscent of other locations, yet is still distinctly Austin. My recommendations? I always get the two piece white plate with beans and fries. The sweetness of the baked beans provides an excellent counterpart to the spicy (it isn't overwhelmingly spicy, I have a low tolerance for spicy food and I can eat this stuff just fine) chicken. Their fries are nice and crispy, and honestly if a place has fries on the menu I almost always get them.\\n\\nService is also really fast too, even when they're busy. You won't wait long for a table, your food, etc. Oh, and regarding my preference of white meat over dark, if you're like me and don't like dark meat, you don't have to worry about the meat being dry, as chicken breasts are really prone to drying out if they're even slightly overcooked. Between the marinating process and how they cook the chicken, I've yet to get a dry piece of chicken."},{"name":"Yard House","address":"825 Battery Ave SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Very large restaurant at the back of SunTrust stadium.

So, I had high expectations of Medina from the start yet, it did not disappoint me. \\n\\nThis is the mecca of brunch in Vancouver. And for those who are coffee connoisseurs, the sign located outside saying, \\"life is too short for bad coffee\\" sounds promising. I came here on Sunday and had to wait about an hour and forty minutes. It is a long wait, but I would be skeptical if there wasn't. Plus, It was so worth it!    \\n\\nWhile, I was waiting I noticed something interesting. The crowd here waiting is a mixture of locals and tourists. I guess, this explains that Medina is good for everyone, not just a \\"hyped\\" restaurant.  \\n\\nThe restaurant atmosphere is cozy, yet has a hint of hipster vibe. I tried the lavender latte and a sip of mocha (FYI, I don't like lavender). I really liked the mocha! it's not a mocha you get from starbucks. You can actually test the richness of chocolate in the drink. The lavender latte was drinkable, but definitely not my go-to drink. However, I see a reason why people like this latte. So, if you are into lavender then you should definitely try.  \\n\\nI had waffles with fig orange marmalade and caramel sauce. The fig orange marmalade was just OK, but the caramel was awesome! It is in perfect texture, milky, and right sweetness. It was well balanced. Also, I had tagine, which was party in my mouth. The merguez sausage and spicy tomato stew just make the dish with poached eggs. \\n\\nMedina has bunch of mouthwatering food. If you happens to be in Vancouver, this is the brunch destination. It gives you the full experience of what proper cafe brunch should be like."},{"name":"Cherrywood Coffeehouse","address":"1400 E 38th 1/2 St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Cool vibes, perfect benedict, but their mimosa game is weak.\\n\\nOutdoor seats are great, especially with the Austin whether these days!

I didn't know. And I went to find out.\\n\\nThis restaurant is a small, intimate space super close to the Central T stop. It was a little cramped (especially considering it was a Tuesday night).. the waiter asked me to take my purse off the back of my chair since he couldn't walk between the tables, but once we got situated it was fine. Okay let's check out this menu.\\n\\nI was pleased to see that the alcohol was super affordable. Every glass of beer and wine were under $5! Whenever I try a new cuisine, I like to have a local drink with it, and although they carried local non-alcoholic drink options (tea, juice, etc), I didn't find any Tibetan boozy beverages (the closest was Indian and Thai beer). As for the wines, they had standard, nameless options. But for $4.25, I'm not complaining. Maybe Tibet doesn't have breweries or vineyards, what for the major monk population and all. Beats me.\\n\\nIt was my dining partner's first Tibetan experience as well, so we started out with the appetizer combo in order to try out a few different things. I didn't expect everything on the plate (green stuff, potato, chickpea, eggplant) to taste so similar. It was all fried and came with two little pots of red (mild) and green (spicy) sauces. They were delicious, don't get me wrong, and the textures differentiated them, but they mostly all tasted like fried vegetable with sauce on top. Regardless, my fave fried veggie was the mushroom with mushed chickpeas. Mmm.\\n\\nEntree time! The menu is pretty extensive, making our decision-making a bit difficult. So we started with general categories and worked our way down to the specifics. Meat and veggies with rice. You want beef. I'm in a chicken mood. This mixture of ingredients and spices sounds appetizing. Langsha Shogo and Chhasha Po Tsel. Done.\\n\\nI really enjoyed these dishes. They were flavorful, and the sauces mixed well with the meat and veggies. I didn't find the meat to be of the best quality, and it was a little tougher than I would have preferred (especially the beef). But maybe that's how they do it in the Himalayas. Also, it was a lot of food. I barely ate any of my rice and took home leftovers for at least two lunches. Maybe three. Therefore, although initially pricey, for the amount of food we got, it came out to be pretty reasonable.\\n\\nOverall, I'd call this a cultural cuisine success. After our Himalayan meal, I felt like I'd climbed Mt. Everest. I just need a Tibetan beer to celebrate."},{"name":"Medina Cafe","address":"780 Richards Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Great place.

But Errol sums up Barely Swine perfectly: \\"Eating here for me was like being in the dining car of some mystical luxury train.\\" What a treat!\\n\\nI love the little servings, that way I can try something off the(my) beaten path like jerk rubbed pork belly, and if I don't like it, no biggie. I'm not too invested. Or, if everything happens to be pretty damn tasty, well you can order more! Brussel sprouts are INCREDIBLE here - a far cry from the soggy version I was served as a kid (and merely chewed up then spit inside my napkin (then slide on the floor so the dog would eat it). My pork belly was tasty, and I also tried some potato fritters = yum. Another highlight was dessert - Amy's vanilla ice cream served floating on a coffee porter. Sweet Jesus. \\n\\nThe selection of beer may be small, but it's quality and is varied. I like the big bottles because it emphasizes the mystical train bit (like suddenly I've eaten something so magical I've shrunken yet my bottle of beer has remained unchanged). Also, if you haven't tried a beer that's 15% alcohol, you should. Talk about bang for your (6) bucks!\\n\\nWouldn't recommend this for kids (food would be too \\"weird\\") or large groups (I came once with some gal pals and the wait would have been over an hour), but as a date spot it's perfect. Ideal in fact for a first date so you can see how adventurous one another is...and you can swap stories like \\"When I was forced to eat brussels sprouts as a kid, I did X\\" or \\"Have you ever tried rabbit before? It really does taste like chicken,\\" or, \\"the last time I drank beer that was 15% alcohol, I ended up doing Y\\") Good times!\\n\\nPS.

BUT, Clay Pit proved me wrong. Indian food IS yummy. We had chicken tikka masala, coconut curry shrimp, and some sort of paneer with spinach and cheese cubes (I can't remember the name and can't find it based on descriptions off the menu. Boo). Of course we ordered tons of naan as well. The food was great. You can choose the level of spiciness you want, and medium was just fine for me. Clay Pit showed me that there's more to Indian food than the stereotypical curry. I'd say it's reasonably priced for a family style restaurant. I went with 9 people and it cost $12 for each of us. \\n\\nWhy three stars though? Service in the beginning was horrible. My friend had made reservations for 7pm, and the person she spoke with over the phone made a big fuss about how strict they are with reservations and that you HAVE to show up on time or they'll give your table away. We showed up 10 minutes early. The hostess said our table should be ready in a few. By a few, she actually meant 40 minutes. Then we waited around at our table for another 10-15 before a server greeted us. Sorry, Clay Pit, but this is unacceptable. I understand that restaurants are jam-packed on Saturday nights, but the point of a reservation is so we don't have to wait for a table. If I have to wait more than 15 minutes overtime for a reserved table, I get pissed. Oh, and they couldn't get us our waters right away because they ran out of cups (??). \\n\\nAside from that, our food came out on time, and was, as I raved, delicious. Our waiter was friendly too.

Glad they didn't overload on the salt.  Also tried the tenders and unlike other reviewers, I thought the size was more than fine.  For sides we tried the fried okra, greens, mac and cheese and broccoli salad.  All were good, but the greens were the best.  The mac and cheese needs a sharper cheese or little more zest to it.  We saw the ham roll ups with pimiento cheese just before we checked out and had already made our selections.  The cashier heard us talking and very obligingly gave us one to try...very nice touch.

If you get confused (like I did) and take the walkway by the bar, you are essentially walking through a service/prep area and have get an embarrassing \\"customer on the line!\\" announcement.\\n\\nOn my second visit to the restroom I went the right way but there are tables adjacent to the wall so walking past is a struggle. I was constantly maneuvering my body/walking sideways to make sure I didn't bump into someone's chair. On my way back, the table further from the restroom was being seated. I guess they were friends reuniting because everyone got up for hugs, blocking the walkway. I had to stand there for a while, awkwardly waiting for an opportunity to squeeze by. Not a huge deal but extremely inconvenient and unnecessary in my opinion.\\n\\n2. The food selection is very limited. Also, they ran out of oysters and shrimp for 2 of the tacos that I wanted. I settled on pork belly, sesame ribeye and baja fish. The toppings are MINIMAL, to say the least. Most come with only cilantro and onion, two things I do not like, so my pork and ribeye tacos were just meat and tortilla. A nice sauce could have brought everything together and made them more enjoyable. Not a strange variation of hot sauce, but a nice flavorful chipotle mayo, queso, avocado cream or something! I tried some of the hot sauces but they weren't much help. The meat inside of the tacos was good but not enough to save my experience. So, it may just be me, but I was not happy after my meal."},{"name":"Blue Star Donuts","address":"1155 SW Morrison St, Ste 102","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Best pinky up donut shop ever.

It is quite clean and food is kept full for lunch. I've only been here once and for $9.75, it's a fair deal. I was a little disappointed to not see the seafood mini pie or kalbi beef short ribs available like in previous pictures. ..maybe it's a dinner thing or from a few years ago? They have a wide selection of food. Many were salads and fried foods. I didn't try the fried small shrimp or diy lemon etc sauce for breaded chicken. They had about 6 soups too. And many stir fry dishes.\\n\\nJapanese food: 3* lack sushi selection. Had edamame, miso soup, tofu, veg  tempura and teriyaki chicken.\\n\\nChinese food:4*\\nIt actually looks more appetizing than numerous Chinese restaurants I searched through Yelp. (I have yet to try a Chinese restaurant here in Austin..as a recent transplant from norcal). \\n\\nKorean food: 3*\\nSome were better than others. \\n-kimchi: nice kick just how it should be\\n-cucumber in chili: not flavored enough in chili paste. Prob needed to sit longer to 'pickle' and absorb flavor\\n-jap chae: done decent. Hint sesame oil. Noodles cooked perfectly\\n-korean pancake and fried dumpling: pancake little doughy. The dumpling was good and had decent amount of meat\\n-beef bulgogi (? ): resembled cooked on stove top and in its liquid. Taste alright. Mild flavor\\n-pork: 2* didn't care for it. Need more seasoning\\n-kimbap: glad they offer it but I like the yellow and brown veggies in it. I only saw the yellow. Thought it was alright. 3*\\n\\n-chow mein: surprisingly good. Liked the slight chewiness of the noodle.\\n-egg roll vegetarian only: outside was fried well but the cabbage inside was plain and salty. \\n-fried rice: perfect consistency and no overly doused in soy sauce.\\n-stir fry egg w zuchinni and shrimp w hot sauce: tasty on top on fried rice since I love scrambled eggs. Not too much hot sauce either which is good\\n-beef w broccoli: actually taste oyster sauce but beef isn't the most tender. Broccoli crisp.\\n-sesame chicken and .. (?): there were 2 kinds of breaded and sauced chicken. Both were tasty. Americanized Chinese which is fine. \\n-had veg tempura only ...no shrimp. So I didn't try it.\\n-teriyaki chicken: done very well. Nice teriyaki flavor \\n-chicken curry: really good. Coconut yellow curry with a kick of heat. Went well w spoonful of white rice. It had bamboo shoots, water chestnuts, tender chicken breast slices and baby corn.\\n-sushi: pretty much all cali roll. Didn't see raw fish. Was either topped with imitation crab or shrimp. 2.5/5* tasted fine nothing to rave.\\n-tried a spoonful of pumpkin porridge which is different. It was sweeter than expected since it sat next to miso soup.\\n\\nDessert\\n-surprisingly good dessert for an asian buffet. They had banana pudding, peach cobbler, biscuits, orange, pineapple, 4 cakes (carrot, mango swirl, strawberry swirl, lemon coconut cream) and 2 cookies (almond and choc chip). And of course they had soft serve. They choc actually tasted like chocolate. I tried the carrot which was moist with a nice cream cheese frosting. The almond cookie was crisp almost like a danish cookie in a good way with bits of almond. The coconut lemon icing was tasty but the yellow cake below was okay. Soft serve vanilla was fine.\\n\\nI'd def be back. I'd say the strong points are there hot food items, salad area and decent dessert.

The inconsistencies of Boston establishments blow me away. With such a great experience at Santarpios recently, I fear they will fall to the inconsistent should I rate them at five.\\n\\nPizza has a very special place in my heart. Although I admit I can eat and will eat anything that resembles Pizza, I critique the elite as if it is was put on earth to be critiqued. \\n\\nI admit I went to Santarpios on a recommendation after four years living in Boston. Not sure why it took so long despite my frequent rants  of mediocrity found at Regina and the inconsistencies of Emma's (different reviews, but Emmas has great sauce). Why was Santarpios left out of the conversations? Not sure.\\n\\nSo today I ventured out and found myself at the end of a small dark bar, looking at boxing memorabilia, and listening to the old Eastie blue hairs complain about coffee. I felt like I was on the set of the Departed and loved it. I was promptly attended to by a lady behind the bar who was nice and very attentive.\\n\\nThe Pizza: Based on my first visit I am comfortable saying, beyond any doubt, that this is the best Pizza in Boston. Somewhat contradictory to some of the lesser reviews the pizza was far from dry, and even had a savory sheen of oil brushed onto the crust, helping preserve the moisture and aiding in a crisp char around the outside. (The char is one of the most underrated, 'must have' characteristics on a pie). I also read that the sauce was peppery and was poured on... again, not my experience. Mine was fresh tasting and seemed like it was nothing more than a diced tomatoes sauce with salt (again, the way it should be). The cheese was high quality and the pepperoni, like the crust, was charred and crisp. \\n\\nThis pizza was as close to perfect as a pizza can be; fresh and savory, mildly greasy, and delicious. I need to go back to verify the consistency and further prove the lesser reviews were either anomalies or ignorance. \\n\\nMy Complaint: I don't drink Cola all that often, but I usually make an exception when I eat pizza, especially at lunch. I hate... Hate... HATE... when there aren't refills. I feel genuinely screwed over. It should be illegal to charge twice for a fountain drink. End of Rant.\\n\\nOne more thing: Pizza from New York is good, but that really deals with the style. The famous stuff hails from Brooklyn... and that is because of the water (Fact).  But in all reality,  the opinions stated by some regarding any pizza region from any place outside of Brooklyn (i.e New Jersey, Manhattan) hold no more credo than those from Boston. So approach Boston pizza  with an open mind and expect the best, because the best can be achieved here. Me? Personally? My favorite pizza hails from Upstate New York, but I am slowly finding rivals here - and Santarpios is right up there."},{"name":"Hopdoddy Burger Bar","address":"1400 S Congress Ave, Ste A190","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"I got an invite (a date, actually) to this place at the last minute.

But as for this time I came in Saturday night today, I came out sort of disappointed. I was expecting that juicy and thick double Shack Burger I always love to bite into, but today my burger was burned especially the edges, which were like 90% burned...The too patty seemed way smaller than the first for some reason. At least the lettuce and tomato looked very stylish and fresh as always, so there's a plus. I got cheese fries with it and boy the are amazing!!!! The cheese was like custard in terms of desserts, very thick and more tart than tangy, so good. Service excellent... All in all, everything was amazing other than that burned burger I had :( . I drive about 35 minutes to come to Shake Shack and I'm always so eager during the car ride, took half an L today but hope to be back.

Just ate a Shroom Burger and Chick'n Shack... Both very good but I don't really like mushrooms so I didn't see the logic of my getting the Shroom Burger...but gotta try new things. The Chick'n Shack was unbelievable, fried chicken sandwich and the thing is that the fried layer does not make you feel rotten and hungover like other places. Very healthy. Atmosphere is unbelievable, moderate noise, hustle and bustle at Perimeter Mall...makes you feel great. \\n\\n\\nUpdated Review: Visit on March 18th; 2018. \\n\\nCame back to Shake Shack yet again, for my seventh time...it's that good! Stopped for a very quick to go order, and was impressed by not only how fast they prepared my Double Shack Burger, but also the quality of it. They made that thang in 6 minutes! Now most burger places who are fast tend to give up quality, but Shake Shack cooks fresh every time...so no worries about quality here. Took my first bite, oh my...the entry into the potato bun was just mesmerizing. So soft and tasting like that great potato roll taste. Level 2 of the Burger, I sensed the shack sauce all inside my mouth and the burger, really compliments the hot and tender beef patties. These beef patties folks, I promise to you...they taste better than any other burger place in Georgia...i can't describe with words so I recommend you give it a shot! $8.39 for a Double Shack Burger but well WELL worth it I guarantee.

The fruit is always fresh, the chocolate is always good (not all stuck together and melted like some establishments) and the toppings are always full so you don't have to worry about your favorite topping being out. The third reason why I love this place is the customer service. The girl that is always working while I'm there is an absolute doll. She is so sweet and friendly.

Basically, you will do no wrong with any item on the menu. It's fantastic and tasty throughout. Yes it can be a bit pricey, but I find it to be some of the best Asian food in the city. As always, we sat at the bar in front of the open kitchen. I love open kitchens and I love watching chefs and cooks working. The night we went, the kitchen was trying out a new item (a Korean \\"taco\\": braised short rib meat in a fried wonton wrapper) and the chef asked us our opinion on it. We told him we loved the dish, but that the fried wonton wrapper was a bit odd to eat. It didn't fry up nicely enough in a taco shape. He mentioned how he noticed people having difficulties trying to figure out how best to eat it. Joanne Chang was present, as she always is it seems. We even got to have a brief chat with her, where I asked her what her favorite spots in the city to eat were. Abby joked that she would say Radius, which got a laugh out of the baker/chef-extraordinaire. She told us of how whenever Chris and her go out to eat (Chris being Chris Myers) they get treated very well because they either know the chefs working or the front of house. Must be a great experience to go into a place knowing you are going to be getting their best any time you go to dine. Joanne Chang told us of how she was working on the Flour Cookbook, which will be a must own for us so Abby can make her raspberry squares (which Joanne Chang said were easy to make...maybe for her). Anyways, along with the \\"tacos\\" we got the green papaya salad and also the beef chow fun. Both excellent, with the salad seeming to be a little bit spicier than normal. My only complaint, and this was very rare for Myers and Chang, was that our waiter was really, really slow and seemed to not want to be there that night. We overheard the people next to us also complaining about our waiter. This is not to put a downer on the entire waitstaff though. Everyone else seemed to be rushing plates out and refilling waters and drinks and clearing tables at a 5-star rate. It was just our waiter on the night we went that seemed to be out of place. That won't stop us from going back though.

Two different preparations, but the coconut crusted fried squid was the best, and went well with the squid ink sauce. A good start, followed up the amazing boudin ball and brussel sprouts. Boudin was perfectly fried, went well with the brussels, and the sauces on the plate. No joke, but that dish alone makes me crave veggies. You know the line 'rolls are a dish?' Well now veggies are too. The grilled beef tongue was solid, but paled in comparison to the pork. If all food was made as well as the three pork preparations, lentils, sauce and foam I'd die happy. The duck and foie whip was epic, and the mushrooms tasty. The chocolate soup was well conceived and executed, tasty with lots of textures and techniques on the plate.\\n\\nLook, honestly, don't waste any more time reading this and get on over to barley swine and enjoy the best meal of your life. The girlfriend even said that our meal at Barley Swine was as good as a meal at Ad Hoc by Thomas Keller, high praise!"},{"name":"Baby Acapulco","address":"13609 N I H 35","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"My favorite thing about this place is the purple margarita's.

Its name is Mooyah. I know this because every person who comes through the doors of the establishment on Research formerly occupied by Gelatto's (across the street from The Olive Garden) is greeted with a hearty \\"WELCOME TO MOOYAH'S!!). \\n\\nThree cheers for both the spirited nature of the counter help and their sense of organization. Three lines at the counter clearly mark where one orders, where fax phone-in and online customers would go to pick up their orders and where the walk-ins go to pick up their own.\\n\\nIt certainly is a stark contrast in atmosphere to Gelatto's which to me seemed more suited for the cerebral Wi-Fi loving crowd. This is more your quintessentially Austin, laid back to a fault establishment. After visiting this past Sunday I'd say there a good deal to be proud of here. One thing they could stand to tend is the A/C or lack of a noticeable one therein. I like my burgers to be char-broiled...not me. In a typically endurance test-based Austin summer this could be a major sticking point. The other big disappointment was that their shake machine was not working that day. Was wanting to cap my homestyle meal with a strawberry shake but it was not to be. Maybe next time.\\n\\nAbout THIS time however. Ordered a basic Mooyah burger which can be topped any one of a number of ways from the reliable stand-bys (lettuce, tomatoes) to the somewhat more lively (buffalo sauce, jalapenos). I topped mine with lettuce, tomatoes, mustard, ketchup, and pickles. Mooyah's prides itself on the attention it pays to the \\"bun to meat ratio\\". Good plan. Nothing's quite as disheartening as noticing you've got a mound of uneaten bun but no beef to savor it with. The buns are dotted with sesame seeds and admittedly don't crowd out the meat. Did seem a little bit squashed though, precariously close to prompting the question \\"Did someone run over part of this in the parking lot?\\" However, not a big concern of mine. A burger jones is seldom stifled by such tiny details. It was pretty damn nifty. Disintegrated into a messy treat. \\n\\nThe fresh cut fries, with skins still on were a blast to consume as well. They're piping hot as I can attest to from the leftover singed feeling my tongue has from having some without blowing on them first!! \\n\\nIt's very much family-friendly and, unlike Mighty Fine, the fries are much thicker, a big selling point.\\n\\nIn review, Mooyah Burgers and Fries is a welcome addition to Austin's burger scene. Fix the A/C and give me a crack at a shake and the three star rating could easily blossom into four."},{"name":"Eddie V's Prime Seafood","address":"9400 B Arboretum Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"This used to be my favorite seafood choice in town.

My SO took me here for my birthday dinner. Although I really wanted to try Cioppino's, my birthday fell on a Sunday and Cioppino's is closed on Sundays. Nevertheless, I was excited to try La Quercia given the stellar reviews from yelpers. I even took to Instagram to get an idea what kind of food I would be indulging in for dinner. \\n\\nWe went with the alla famiglia option. They have an option between 7 or 11 dishes I believe. We chose the 7 course option. We also ordered 2 glasses of bubbly to cheers to my birthday, and a bottle of white wine to go with dinner.\\n\\nThe food was fine. Although I wish the portions were a tiny bit larger. The amount of time between each dish helps to allow you to feel more full after the meal. Whether this is good or bad depends on personal preference. The service was pretty standard. The thing that makes me have mixed feelings about my experience is when our waiter came to refill our glasses of wine. After he finished pouring and my SO went to have a sip, there was a fly in the glass. We do not know whether it flew into the bottle, or the glass, but I felt weirded out about how our waiter handled the situation. After we called him back to let him know, he took away the glass (good sign), but then came back with the glass and a spoon and asked us what we wanted to do. I assume the two options were to spoon the fly out or get a new glass? I know some may argue that wine is alcohol and therefore it's inherently sanitizing, but just the thought of having to drink a glass that a fly was just swimming in is kind of gross. Or is it just me? Anyway, after some deliberating while the waiter was standing beside us with spoon in one hand and glass with fly in other hand, my SO asked for a new glass instead. So our waiter poured him a new glass from our bottle. That means a whole glass of wine from our bottle went down the drain, not to mention we had to finish our bottle knowing that a fly might had just been drowning in there. How much are glasses of wine at restuarants nowadays? \\n\\nI know it's not the restaurant's fault that a fly decided to commit suicide in our wine, but the whole spoon thing was kind of weird.

It's new, established in place of the old Forest Cafe. Unfortunately my experience didn't quite live up to my high standards for Cambridge cuisine... \\n\\nUpon entering, my friend and I immediately noticed an awkward silence. While the restaurant's limited seating was mostly occupied, there was no sound other than the soft chatter among patrons. This is a plus if you like a quieter place for dining, but I generally like at least a little music to enhance the ambiance. Now for some quick yays and nays...\\n\\nYays:\\n* Attentive service\\n* Water bottle (tap) for each table!\\n* LOVE THE NAME!!! Rafiki Bistro has a nice friendly ring\\n* Organic, natural, grass-fed, and fresh ingredients\\n* Sweet potato fries, I think they had cinnamon? or maybe cloves or nutmeg? They were really good and tasted like fall :)\\n* Topping on the pumpkin ravioli special -- I've never had dried cranberries with pasta, but what a great idea! Mixed with mini white onions and yummy zucchini strings.\\n* Turkey burger had great flavor... when I read during our \\"menu research\\" that it has maple syrup I was sold!!\\n\\nNays:\\n* Decor did not seem unified -- brick wall, funeral-parlor-looking red curtains, Asian wall hanging, sticks in a vase (?!) and a podium at the front inscribed with the name of the restaurant in tiki bar font. Weird.\\n* Feng shui seemed a little off... the space is long and thin and with many of the chairs facing the bar it looked more like a lecture hall than a restaurant. \\n* The prices on the menu are different (usually $1 more) than those we saw listed on the website. I like consistency and truth in advertising :)\\n* The ravioli itself was overcooked and HARD.\\n\\nI'd be willing to go back and give Rafiki another chance -- I like to support new businesses.

Not horrible, but not good at all either.  We were excited to try this new spot off Main since I don't know the first thing about Peruvian food and there seemed to be a good variety of vegetarian options.  We picked up a menu at car free day and many items sounded really interesting.\\nThey surprising take reservations which I liked, and we were able to get one for 7 pm on Saturday.\\nWe showed up on time and were approached by an unsmiling hostess who approached us rather aggressively considering it didn't seem that busy.  You know they way they approach when they are either super busy and are in the weeds and the last thing they want are more customers or when you walk in just before they close? Ya, like that, short and abrupt.  \\nThe space is pretty tight with the bar seats being a foot away from the lower seats across from them with no one seated.  Out big and tall server seemed to struggle getting around even though there were thankfully only a couple of folks seated at the bar.  I don't know how they'd do it if it was actually full.\\nThe cocktails were fine, the drink special with blueberry compote and elderflower water was the only special on the whole menu utilizing seasonal fruits.  For some reason, their desserts were pumpkin and sweet potato donuts, chocolate cake with chocolate sauce and chocolate and caramel trifle.  What the ?!?  This is the only window when we can actually get local fruit and nothing.  It looked more like a menu you'd expect in November.\\nThe yuca was thick and undercooked, nothing like the ones you can get off the Guanaco truck.  The fried rice is the only one that changes on the main menu and our server did not know what kind it was that night.  We ordered it anyhow (it was octopus and chorizo) and it was so salty with so much soy sauce.  It tasted like the kind you get at a bad food court.  The ceviche came with a giant piece of cold sweet potato, just a very strange presentation.  Quinoa fritters had a spongy texture with bits of undercooked cauliflower.  The empanadas were pretty good with a nice and bright dipping sauce.  Unfortunately that was the only bright spot.

I had the Bahama Mama platter and it was so worth it! I especially like the potato salad. I never liked mushy potatoes but their German potato salad was chunky and has a great acidity to it, oh and some bacon bits too. Bf ate the apple sauce and he liked it. The sausage has a great spicy kick! It's kind of garlicky and spicy but definitely not greasy. The sauerkraut was fantastic too! They mixed it with just a little bit of pork and that balanced the sourness. It reminded me of my grandmother's homemade sauerkraut stew with pork belly. And yes she's Chinese and yes I don't know why people from of two cultures eat the same thing.\\n\\nLast but not least the notorious cream puff! ehhh this is a hard one because anyone who's been to Asia knows we make western desserts tastier and prettier.

They were generous with chunks of lamb-- not pure bone as I was expecting. And the meat was lean, which made the broth clear and light. They serve this with cut up pieces of injera (a tangy, spongy pancake) that you can put in your bowl to soak up the nice broth. \\n\\nWe also had the Fish Tibs w/Shiro which had a nice tanginess from the tomato and lime juice. The tilapia itself though was a little on the dry side. Thicker pieces of fish would've prevented this. \\n\\nLast, we had the Dulet which we had to \\"check with server for availability\\". The flavors in this dish were definitely strong, mostly from the liver and tripe, which are minced and mixed with the ground beef. I would probably not order this again, mostly because a little oily and we're avoiding ground beef. Plus, I think tripe is to be enjoyed in larger pieces, not minced to the point where they it is confused with the not-so-tasty beef gristle.  \\n\\nWhile we're mostly interested in the quality of the food, the place is a good date spot with its nice decorations and dim lighting.

Are restaurants that try to do stylized Chinese-inspired food just acting like PF-Chang's on steroids?\\n\\nAnd so...my first dinner trip to M + C:  \\n\\nThe dan dan noodles were actually pretty good - easy to go wrong with this classic dish but M + C pulls it off.  The other items we sampled: the wok charred baby octopus, the garlicky spicy coal-black wings, tea-smoked pork spare ribs had flavor but little character.  Cilantro was too readily deployed in these dishes, as if it were an inside joke.  Hakka eggplant was enjoyable but again lacked distinction.  \\n\\nSo in many ways, M+C met the expectations I had of it - it wasn't better than Chinese food I normally crave or seek and it falls in the category of less-inspired modern Chinese food.

Atmosphere is perfect for date-nights, but make sure you have a reservation for the weekends.  Thank goodness for the full bar because there wasn't much room to wait  u[p front and constantly being side-stepped by servers waiting on the outdoor seating was kinda annoying too.  Host/Hostess service was above par than most higher-end restaurants I've experienced.  Bartender was impeccable on his recommendation for wine selection, though a bit clumsy behind the bar and even with another group of customers where he failed to get the martini into the glass, but rather showering the them with it.  \\n\\nThe wait wasn't too bad, considering we were 25 minutes early.  Got some game time in, answered texts and made our menu selections before our table was ready.   They offer a fair amount of seating throughout and being the Friday after New Year's, this place was pretty busy.  The table was cute and quaint, tucked away in a corner so we got to psuedo sit next to each other - perfect for that first date.  The server, when he was around, was great.  Considering the time it takes for the each course to arrive, he could have been more on top of things - THOUGH, he was very presentable, eloquent and not too chatty - something I love in my servers.\\n\\nWe ordered the Big Night Out - Fondue Fusion ($81.00/couple).  The food wasn't above my expectations but decent.  The cheese fondue appetizer and the chocolate dessert fondue were tied for my favorite courses.  The entree's were nothing too special...lobster was good though.  I enjoyed that they didn't charge extra for the fruits/veggies and they allowed substitutions of all sorts.  The sauce selections they provide were unique, as well.\\n\\nWhile the server was somewhat MIA, he did cater to our ignorance of needing the actual Entertainment card to make the promotion valid.  Thanks for the $12 off on the $100+ bill.  \\n\\nCheck out the menu and such here: http://www.meltingpot.com/locations.aspx?z=32828&n=678788\\n\\nHere is where they lost some rating (and not entirely sure if it's the restaurant's fault) but during dinner a family of four next to us opted for  dinner/family conversation of credit card debt, the talk of the birds and the bees, sugar-coated \\"Are you having sex?\\" and \\"When did you start drinking?\\" discussions.  Mind you, these kids couldn't have been older than MAYBE high school age.  So you can only imagine the banter between the accusatory parent and the hormonal teenager.  I'd consider enjoying a dinner that costs $200+ instead.

Fried cheese was some of the best I have ever had - it really was exceptional. I got the Cajun Pasta, with blackened chicken.

I wouldn't say it's totally authentic. Especially this restaurant. I went with my family (including my husband, his parents and my parents- all of whom grew up and lived in India). By the decor we thought we were in for a nice Indian inspired meal. There's pictures of Indian people on the walls, statutes of Indian/Hindu deities, etc. I take a look at the menu and it's straight up Chinese inspired american food. Yak and Yeti is a popular name used for restaurants in Northern India and Nepal. . .Now I know Indian food is not for every palate but I expected to see something at least resembling a samosa. \\n\\nThat aside, we waited about 15 minutes for a table around 2pm.

The dinner was much more successful than the movie. The new Indiana Jones is...kind of bad. Even Cate Blanchett can't rescue it.\\n\\nAnyway, so the restaurant. It was really dead at 6:30 when we arrived for our reservation and we were seated at a huge booth by ourselves. So huge, in fact, that we quickly made the decision to sit on the same side of the booth together. Schmoopiness aside, I kind of like it when empty restaurants don't try to put you in the window so that passersby will think there are people in there. The seats were kind of uncomfortable, especially for my tall husband, but the decor of the restaurant was understated and spacious. The kitchen is huge and open with bar seating overlooking the workspace. I guess these guys want the customers to have confidence that they are above board!\\n\\nWe started with glasses of wine--he the XYZin, me the Trivento Malbec. Both were good, and the pours were generous. The glasses were a little on the pricey side, so the generousity was definitely necessary for them to be a decent value. First course arrived quickly -- the shrimp ravioli, which our server recommended. It was really good, topped with a shrimpy beurre blanc sauce, peas, asparagus and tomato. It was very spring-y. \\n\\nEntrees were appropriately timed, and attractively plated. He had the duck breast which was served with a mushroom egg roll. Both the duck and the spring roll thingie were really tasty--well seasoned, not greasy. My Boy doesn't normally like mushrooms, but the preparation really took advantage of the earthiness of the mushrooms. I especially liked that the cabbage and mushrooms in the roll weren't minced beyond recognition as they often are in stuffings for Asian dishes.\\n\\nI wanted a recommendation from the server who did the thing that I hate the most when I ask for a recommendation--he asked what I was in the mood for. Um...I want to know what the specialities of the house are and your personal favorites. If I was in the mood for something in particular, I wouldn't have asked for a recommendation. Gah. That response makes me think either that the servers don't like or haven't tried the food. Anyway, other than my personal hang ups, the service was great.\\n\\nI ended up having the prime rib which wasn't really anything to write home about. It was strangely bland and came with a horseradish sauce that really overpowered the meat in a weird way. It was tasty, of course, but I liked the duck dish better.\\n\\nSides are served to the table, and appear to be seasonal. We had beets, english peas, Israeli couscous and mashed butter with a little bit of potatoes in it. All were tasty, even the beets, and I really don't like beets. The peas were especially good. And my prime rib was really good slathered with the butter...erm...potatoes.\\n\\nThe bill came to about $90 which seems reasonable for the value that we got from the meal, and the service was attentive, but not rushed. The convenience of having a nice place to have a solid meal and go to the movies (or any of the other attractions in Atlantic Station) makes the creepiness of Atlantic Station worth it. Give me good food and H&M, and I can handle feeling like I'm walking around a fake movie set of a deserted city. There probably won't be zombies wandering in during dinner...I hope.\\n\\nWe made our movie with time to spare, and our bellies were satisfied, though our nostalgia for the original Indiana Jones trilogy was a bit tarnished.

I actually came across Thierry through a yelp and saw that they made French Macaroons, so I had to try them.  I haven't had a good macaroon since my days in Paris, so I was excited to try these.\\n\\nIt was a sunny Saturday, so I thought a leisurely bike ride to downtown is just what I needed and a stop over at this place. A friend was very kind to join me after I had mentioned that I wanted to try some things. We got here and the place was packed with people wanting to get their sweet tooth on. So we decided to order out, it was a nice day anyway and would have been a lot more comfortable and fun sitting on the beach.\\n\\nMy friend ordered some kind of mini bunt cake looking thing that was soaked in rum and some kind of sweet sauce/ glaze, with whipped cream on top and fruit. Because of the abundance of rum in it, my friend did not like it very much, but that was also the reason why I loved it! I ordered 7 french macaroons, they were: Hazelnut, pistachio, lime, passion fruit and chocolate-caramel. Yes, I can count, that is only five, but those were the only flavors available so I had to double up on some. They were all very tasty except for the passion fruit one, it was tasty in a bad way. My favorite was the Pistachio!\\n\\nWhen we went to the cashier to pay, we saw the baguette sandwiches and thought \\"hey! we need one of these too!\\" Something savory to compliment all the sweet stuff we ordered.

Terry Black's Barbecue nails both of these parts with their delicious fatty brisket and ribs, as well as their variety of excellent sides. Walking in, I immediately caught the aroma of the smoky meat. The interior had a warm and welcoming vibe. It was such an ideal spot to grab lunch with friends on a Sunday. \\n\\nEach side dish had a unique flavor that complemented the meat extremely well and reinforced what a good barbecue meal should be. We bought the family meal which was 5 pints of sides and 3 pounds of meat. Because the sides were self-serve, it gave me a cafeteria-esque feel. We bought 2 pints of macaroni and cheese, 1 pint of coleslaw, 1 pint of green beans, and 1 pint of creamed corn. I mainly judge my sides by the quality of creamed corn and coleslaw, and based off of those two alone, the sides were super delicious. The creamed corn was subtly sweet but not overly heavy. The coleslaw had a great creamy feel with a slight tart flavor that did great a job of cutting through the heaviness. The green beans were not overly oily or soft which was great at cutting through the richness of the meat. Finally, the macaroni and cheese was what a good solid macaroni and cheese should have been: creamy, rich, and cheesy. \\n\\nFor our order, we got 2 pounds of brisket and 1 pound of pork ribs. To get straight to the point, both meats were amazing. Sauce was almost not necessary but it still served as a great complement. The brisket bark had that right balance of smokiness and bitterness to cut through the richness and flavor of the fat and meat. The brisket was super tender but did not overpower me with oil and grease. The pork ribs had a great smoky salty flavor that is very distinctly different from a beef brisket. However, these ribs, like the brisket, were fall-apart, tender, and delicious. The table had 3 different barbecue sauces. The original sauce is a barbecue sauce that is so basic but done so right. It had a great balance of tartness, saltiness, and sweetness. The spicy barbecue sauce was not overpoweringly spicy and the sweet barbecue sauce (my favorite) had a nice sweet and salty taste that wasn't overly sugary but provided a harmony of flavors when paired with the meat. \\n\\nI talk about cutting through a lot but this meal had a ton of balance to it.\\nThere's honestly not much else to say besides that it is just good barbecue."},{"name":"Fuji 1546 Restaurant and Bar","address":"1546 Hancock St","city":"Quincy","stars":"3.5","text":"Came on a busy Sunday night the food was delicious but my server Helen was definitely on top of her game!

He said that it was fatty, chewy and inedible.  He threw most of it away, which he was not happy about considering it was almost $20.

And tasty ones at that. BF and I went last Saturday night after we realized this place had opened. We have been watching the progress of the building in anticipation of trying their brews. BF had been previously but not me. The parking lot was jammed and we thought we were going to be in for a long wait...but to our surprise and delight, we were seated immediately since we were a table of two. That said, the table was rather tiny, but we made do. Despite the crowded restaurant, service was on the ball. Server came to take drink orders and since I couldn't decide (I am not much of a beer drinker), she offered to bring me a sample. Be aware, samples are only offered once in a 24 hour period. How they keep track of that...I did't ask. I ended up with a Brewhouse Blond and the BF had the Nit Wit. We both thought our selections were good, nearly top notch.\\n The appetizer we ordered was the Thai shrimp lettuce wraps. These were very flavorful, shrimp were chargrilled. They laid on top of some veggies, mango salsa and a nice spicy/sweet sauce was provided for dipping. The miss with this appetizer is the lettuce used for the wraps. It is Boston lettuce, which is very tender (good), but too lightweight (bad) to hold the filling. We ate these with a fork and knife.\\nOur entrees were served promptly. I had a new dish on the menu, the Creole Tilapia.  It is one of their enlightened entrees that is under 575 calories. It's served with rice pilaf...pretty standard...and some baby greens and veggies with a balsamic vinaigrette. The greens were completely limp...maybe due to a heatlamp? The Tilapia was covered with a nice tomato olive tapenade.Very tasty combo, just wish the lettuce would and have been crisp and chilled. BF had the Tuscan chicken limone which was served over angel hair pasta and included nice size pieces of artichoke, sundried tomato and steamed spinach. This was a huge portion and two crisp slices of garlic bread were served along side. He ate it all because it was so delish!\\nPrices are very reasonable.

I opted for smaller dishes rather than an entree.  I had the house salad (delicious), wok stir fried veggies (had two bites and gave it to my husband as there were bell peppers in them and I am allergic), side of egg rolls (pretty good but a bit greasy) and fried rice (good but not great).  The portions were huge and my house salad was nearly as big as an entree salad.  We split an egg roll and I had about a quarter of the fried rice.  We took the remaining rice, veggies and an egg roll to go (in cute Asian restaurant cartons).  We were too full to try the mango pie.  Next time!

The chicken was fatty and not organic (not that it said it was anywhere on the menu I'm just making a point that the taste of a fattened hormone injected chicken is so blatantly yech) although wrapped in proscuito was nice and the sauce was good. it's just that the garlic mash was rather tasteless and the portion too small. The spinach mixed in with the mash was wonderful yet again too little of it. No vegetable accompanied the dish and that was a big disappointment.

Also, all of their ingredients are incredibly fresh and put into the burgers at perfect proportions. But it's not just their burgers that are amazing.

I would wait in line just for the milkshake; words cannot do it justice. Just get it. \\n\\nDefinitely worth the wait. Try to go early so the wait is not as long, and try to go to the W.

When we arrived, we were seated immediately. It wasnt that busy. We arrived 8:30pm on a Thursday night. We had a friendly server. He seems to know his menu, although we didn't ask a lot of the detailed questions. We started off with a lightly battered fried calamari with a cream sauce on the side. This is one of my favorites here. For dinner, we ordered lamb korma, sag paneer, garlic/basil nan bread & cranberry nan bread, & lastly a vegan eggplant dish(don't remember the name of this). We think their sag paneer is ok. They were skimpy on the cheese portion of this dish. The lamb korma was ok too. They may have use heavy cream on the gravy for this. My stomach would know if its a heavy cream. I did not eat much of this because of my sensitive stomach. I had other lamb korma before with a yogurt base gravy, in which my stomach appreciate more. We never had cranberry nan before, and we found out we didnt like the taste. There wasn't anything wrong with it. It's just that our taste buds din't like the flavor. But we did like the garlic-basil nan & the sauces that were serve for the nans. The other dish we order was some sort of vegan eggplant. It contained the meat of an eggplant, tomatoes, green onions, cilantro, and some Lemon juice. This is also my favorite here. We couldn't leave the restaurant without trying out one of their desserts. All of their dessert sounds delicious based on their description under the dessert menu. I already tried these desserts in other restaurants.

My last time going it took my waitress 30 minutes to take orders and it was only a hand full of people there. Then she took another 30 for water. Smh once our food came out it was the wrong order so the waitress blamed another waitress and said it would be fixed. But when it finally hit the table again it was cold like it had been sitting.

She said the manager was running 20mins late! I told her I wanted a discount for all of the problems being that I arrived at about 11:30 and it was now 3! She told me no with an  attitude and I told her I wasn't leaving until the manager arrived and walked back to the table. 5mins later a different waitress walked over (she could've been the mother of our original waitress because they look just alike) and said she  charged us for something cheaper instead.

I usually get the bahama burger special, the old world sausage platter combination, or the buffet. I've found the buffet is wayyy too much for me, and just sticking to the menu item dishes is plenty of food. The bahama burger special is good because the bahama mama is my favorite sausage, and the pretzel bun is delish. All of the sides I've had are good - green beans and spatzel, potato pancakes and applesauce, potato salad, and redskin potatoes. I would say the world sampler is my favorite, you can even split it with someone if you are not feeling incredibly hungry. You get to try four of the sausage types and you get two sides. It's the perfect amount of food and flavor.\\n\\nI took my parents here once, and my dad loved the kraut. Maybe every other thing on the menu is americanized german food, but apparently the kraut is legit. He loved loved loved it. I, myself, hate the taste of kraut. But my father is polish and my mother is german.... my dad grew up eating authentic polish food from a polish mother and he kept raving and raving about how it actually tasted like real kraut - he even used the phrase \\"just like my mom used to make\\". And then proceeded to explain to me HOW to make it... but that's neither here nor there. \\n\\nThe only two things that are not out of this world: the beer and the cream puffs. Everyone keeps going on and on about the huge cream puffs. Yes, they are huge. But I just am not a fan! I guess it's just a little too bland for me. I could eat a tub of cool whip and probably feel the same satisfaction... as for the beers, when my parents and I went my dad and I both got the beer flight. Unfortunately, he was not impressed! I did like a few, but he didn't like ANY. They simply were not strong enough for him and he felt every single one was super bland. It was almost a waste since he didn't want to drink any, but he knows better than to leave beer on the table. So I guess if you are a real beer lover with a strong taste and tolerance, steer clear. If you're like me and am not a fan of IPAs and am used to bud light? Then you might enjoy them.\\n\\nOn some nights they have live music, which is entertaining enough. I thought they were really cute, since just like the staff, they dress up. They try to play old school german songs (I had no idea what they were, but my mom did). It got a little too loud for me though, and I kind of wished the place were bigger with an actual stage for those guys to go on, since they were practically screaming in our ears.

Wouldn't make sense for us to fill up with a buffet since we already knew we wanted to try different things at different restaurant.

They definitely take some liberties with how you think of traditional Mexican dishes, but it doesn't sacrifice the flavor or finish.\\n\\nWalking in at lunch time, I was surprised how dark it was, so we opted to sit around the corner near the windows. The choice of programming on TV was odd: a muted infomercial channel selling pots & pans, which doesn't do much for the atmosphere and conflicted with the spirit of Santana overhead.\\n\\nI started off suspicious of the meal, as the aguas frescas were more like water infused with juice or flavored syrup and without the pulpiness I'd expect. The lemon agua fresca was too tart to drink, but they adjusted it and made it sweet enough to be palatable. My orange grapefruit combo was good once I reset my agua fresca expectations.\\n\\nThe quesadillas were also not as expected, as the chorizo and veggies were piled all around the hidden taco-sized quesadillas, but nothing to penalize them for and still a solid dish.\\n\\nThe mole on the veggie gringas (think enchiladas without cheese) was great and not too sweet. They did not skimp on the veggies, which were inside and all around and surely help you get far through your recommended number of daily servings!\\n\\nSo if you want Mexican but would rather have healthy than heavy, just adjust your expectations for a slightly odd experience and you'll enjoy your dish."},{"name":"Santarpio's Pizza","address":"111 Chelsea St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I hate to come off as a food snob but I lived in Italy for 15 years and I am big fan of pizza.

There  are way better options in East Boston (please see my other reviews). \\n\\nThe crust is fairly thin and not too greasy (which is a good thing if you like your pizza to be authentic) but it tastes like cardboard, there is however a good balance of cheese and tomato and you will have a wide range of choices for toppings, but I just find the taste to be good but not great. I find the pizza at Kelly's Square Pub to be much better and you will not have to wait in a long line and deal with the famous Santarpio attitude. \\n\\nThe lamb on the other hand is quite good (that is pretty much the only other item on the menu aside from pizza) and the place is very rustic inside once you can get a table.

Sure, it's a little overdone inside with silly shit on the wall and goofy pictures and such, but that's nothing to be concerned with. And true, it can be busy and filled with kids during lunch or an early dinner, but it's large enough to get away from the chaos by finding a table in the back. Parking is easy, plenty of of it, even when it's busy.\\nBut really, it's about the food. Their grilled chicken caesar salad is delicious, and huge. Very huge. Their fresh baked cookies, also huge. And the burgers, the reason you eat here, are huge too. From 1/3 pound all the way to a full pound, they have it. Cooked the way you want, even if it's rare (A+++), with a very good homemade bun. Pick your toppings, sauces, even the seasoning they put on the fries is available to sprinkle on the meat. And what good meat is it. Very tasty, well seasoned, juicy, delicious. The fries are good too, big steak fries cooked just right, a little crispy but soft on the inside. Refills are free on the numerous drinks they have from the fountain machine, or beers are offered too. I like it.

We we're then finally seated in a small booth with 5 people and a high chair that we had no space to sit and then had to wait another 10 mins for the waiter to even ask us if we want drinks or ready to order. We gave our order and we had to wait almost 15-20 mins before we even received our drinks and then pizza came another 10 mins or so after. The drinks were way over priced and the soda machine says \\"employees only\\" like they afraid of people refilling their own drinks, and after we got our food not even once did anyone come to ask if we need more drinks or anything else. When everyone was finished eating we asked for our bill and we had to wait another 15 mins (keep in mind the place is almost empty) my wife had to go first to the car with the baby and the kids since we were waiting so long. Then the guy came and started to clean the table and looked at me and asked me if I needed anything and told him \\"my bill please\\" he totally had forgotten about me. So, i was waiting again.... then decided I had to go to the register and ask for my bill there. We had ordered 2 pizzas with 2 toppings each, 12 wings and 5 drinks and my total came out to be $62.00.

I'm going to describe an unlikely love story between a glutton and gourmet dining.\\n\\nAs a chubby-cheeked adolescent, I didn't have much patience for small portions. I used to eat such large quantities at such great speeds, the flavors became as blurred as trees lining the highway. But, after many years of honing my self-restraint (Thanksgiving dinner and brunch buffets excluded), I've learned to appreciate taste over stuffing my face.\\n\\nWhich brings us to Barley Swine, and then La Feria to drown our impatience in margaritas, and then back to Barley Swine to be seated an hour-and-a-half later next to the proprietor himself, Bryce Gilmore. Our cozy spot at the bar was worth every tick of the clock and slurp of our margs. \\n\\nTo our left was a bartender manning a tasty selection of taps. I asked for his assistance with my beer selection, come to find that his recommendation was the most expensive one on the menu. Luckily for him, it was absolutely delicious.\\n\\nDirectly ahead were two saut√© cooks putting their wrists to work like a teenage boy with unrestricted Internet access. I haven't seen cooking utensils flipped that fast since my days as a hibachi waiter.\\n\\nAnd to our immediate right was the aforementioned owner, Bryce Gilmore. We watched in awe as Mr. Food & Wine painstakingly arranged each dish as if they were going to be on the cover of Bon App√©tit. He even handed us our plate of pork belly, carrots, lavender and pumpkin seeds.\\n\\nAs expected, the Barley Swine pork belly was just as perfect as the Odd Duck slider that launched Bryce's career; probably even more so. The caramelized lavender coating provided a pleasant crisp, which perfectly junxtaposed the pork's melt-away interior.\\n\\nThe Wagyu brisket, coffee, barbecued beans and slaw came in a close second. The beef's texture was comparable to the pork belly, but with a bitterness brought on by the coffee. The dish seamlessly provided the heartiness of The Salt Lick with the elegance of Uchiko.\\n\\nThe scrambled egg, broccoli, goat feta and pine nut was probably my third favorite plate of the evening, mostly due to the broccoli. I've never tasted such flavorful florets. It was a nice complement to the rest of the dish's mild ingredients, aside from the goat feta. \\n\\nI could smell the Gulf shrimp, hominy, pancetta, citrus, and cabbage course coming my way before it was plated. The cooked crustacean provided the most alluring aroma of the evening, while the hominy happened to be a bit misleading. I was expecting the grits to be the consistency I had grown accustom to during my coastal Carolina youth. This hominy had the texture of al dente pasta. Regardless, it was excellent.\\n\\nThe sage funnel cake, grilled foie gras and sweet potato ice cream made an wonderful conclusion to our meal. It's gradient of sweets provided a smooth transition from the previous savory dishes.\\n\\nAnd last, and least, was the black bean fritters, sesame dressing and sweet potato starter. By no means was it bad; it just wasn't as memorable as the rest of our meal. Which, come to think of it, makes it the perfect beginning to an evening at Barley Swine.\\n\\nOnce all of our two-bite portions were consumed, I came to a realization. THIS is how food should ALWAYS be prepared. It's not about expanding your waistline. It's about exposing your taste buds to a multitude of flavors in the course of a meal. Although I may continue to have the occasional fling with large quantities, I am officially declaring my love for tiny and tasteful potions of food."},{"name":"Myers & Chang","address":"1145 Washington St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"The best fusion I've had.

No surprise there either, you usually can't get the charge waived at any dim sum place unless you know people.  But then the kicker.  They charged us $2.50 for something labelled \\"XO\\" which we later discovered was a placeholder for the red hot sauce.

Nevermind that without the hot sauce, she would not have ordered so much food in the first place.  It's like if you went to White Spot and they charged you for the ketchup because you were having too much with your fries.

My chicken tenders were quite tasty but unf dry too. The mac & cheese was very good and the fried green tomatoes exceptional :) The fries were really good but of course cold by the time I got home.\\nThe chess pie reminded me of Grandmas - smooth  with a sweet crust..mmmm \\n\\nIn all fairness I'll need to come again when they're not so busy & actually have a sit down dinner here.

I ordered a farm fresh salad with 2 add ons (avocado and a hard boiled egg) and fresh squeezed lemon as the dressing. I received about 3 tiny chunks of avocado, 1/2 a hard boiled egg cut into slivers to make it look like there was more to it, and grilled (not roasted like they said in the salad description) on top of egg noodles and spinach. No lemon dressing but about 1/8 of a lemon wedge... what am I supposed to do with that? I stared at the small yet overpriced salad and realized something is not right. Something was not right at all. Whoever made my salad forgot to put in THE REST OF THE INGREDIENTS. There was supposed to be tomatoes, sunflower seeds, and carrots on top of the salad in addition to my add ons. I would have complained however I got delivery and was in a bit of a hurry to meet my friends out. Not joking this was the saddest yet most expensive salad I ever did consume. $18 for the salad and $4 for delivery (delivery charge is quite steep but ok I get it). Not gona lie I recently had a salad from subway and it was 10x better than this one. You can customize it yourself; when I had a salad at subway their portion of fresh grilled chicken was huge, everything else in the salad was also very fresh, they gave me 1/2 an avocado instead of 3 tiny pieces, and it cost literally 1/2 as much as shredded's salad. If you're in the area and want to eat a super quick healthy salad I absolutely suggest you check out subway next to broadway station instead of shredded."},{"name":"Gus's World Famous Fried Chicken","address":"117 San Jacinto Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"..I have been to Gus' s a few times.

On the first night despite all the busy-ness, we were served quickly and pretty much efficiently, and the food was surprisingly good (for not being NYC:) *NOTE our standards are a lil high since we are food-spoiled New Yorkers...Howevs, Sunday night it was not busy AT ALL, and our food took forever ever. Every interaction took forever. They didn't have the beer we ordered on tap, but we had  no idea because it literally took about 20 minutes between ordering the drinks and the time that the server came over to tell us that they needed to change over the tap. The food took at least 35 minutes to arrive-and it was again, pretty nice. people were being served all around us. There was no reason for any of this because the place was well staffed and definitely not under siege. It really felt like we were invisible-the whole Salem area doesn't feel super queer friendly to begin with (that was surprising-we felt like we ere on display all weekend)  We def didn't feel very well served here. We're cute hip urban textbook tidy gays, not off the chart or remotely edgy LGBTQ appearing, but we are also not FOX news audience (FOX was playing on ALL TVs just as an FYI.)

I want to love Burnside unequivocally, but I can't. After two visits, here's what I do love:\\n\\n--Attentive service. Your waiter will be funny and charming, your drinks will be refilled many times, you will get dessert in a timely fashion, and the time you complain about a well done burger (that had been ordered as medium rare) you will get a dessert on the house. Classy.\\n\\n--Atmosphere. The decor is that rare mix of minimalist and comfortable. The tables are far apart, making this venue much quieter than might be expected--yay!\\n\\n--Beer. While nothing has completely blown our minds a la Breakside or Hopworks, the beers here are consistently delicious and weird, which is the perfect combination in my mind.\\n\\nNow for the not-so-amazing:\\n\\nThe food. The menu makes it all sound fantastic, but when your items arrive, they are almost always vaguely (or overtly) disappointing. The $10 \\"Sweet Heat\\" macaroni and cheese with pretzel topping sounds divine, right? Well, it isn't. It is small, and not nearly as good as most homemade. The aforementioned $12 brewery burger was terribly overdone... and it was bland, too. Heartbreaking.\\n\\nThe Brewery Sausages are so greasy that their special mustards all run together into one mustard soup. Sigh. The $14 steak frites... meh. Get the $9 happy hour ones at Davis Street Tavern instead, and you will weep tears of miserly joy.  \\n\\nHowever, a few items bordered on genius. The cohiba (duck confit) is delicious, and is served in an ashtray because it is shaped like little cigars. The Tempura Apples are served with vanilla ice cream and red wine-honey syrup, and are perfection. I could eat ten plates of them. The \\"Anti-grilled Chocolate Mousse\\" is shot out of a tank that looks like a fire extinguisher, and then you get to play with some sort of space-age molecular-gastronomy-like equipment to make your own instant frozen lavender cookies. Fun.\\n\\nSo, what do we recommend?  Avoid the high-priced entrees and focus on the happy hour menu. Everything we ate off that menu was at least competent and some of it was great. And try to go on Wednesdays, when they have $3 pints.\\n\\nAnd just soak up the nice atmosphere and drink... a lot. The beer sampler is the way to begin--it was probably one of the most generous samplers I've experienced."},{"name":"Hopdoddy Burger Bar","address":"1400 S Congress Ave, Ste A190","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"An Austin favorite of mine.

I was a huge fan of Odd Duck and so was my friend, so while heading to Lick we decided to try it. It was my fault thinking that the place wouldn't be busy on a Tuesday at 7, but it was! Once I got inside you can see why, the place is REALLY small! The bar counts as dining option. It's super quaint and it feels like you are stepping into a cozy little barn. Our wait was 45-an hr. Limited seating outside. Very limited! 2 small tables and about 5 chairs. \\n\\nI love the fine dining experience, it should be an experience and not just food. I've done my fair share of good quality restaurants here in Austin and I loved how everything at Barley Swine was treated with care so that the quality of the ingredients really showed.

Compared to Lenoir: 3 courses each, a glass of wine & iced-tea for just $10 more. \\n\\nBeet salad, pistachio, fennel, frisee\\n- The beets were delicious and so was the beet puree and the toasted pistachios. \\n\\nBlack bean fritters, sesame dressing, sweet potato\\n- We were a bit hesitant to try this at first but it was REALLY good. The black bean was pureed so it was really soft and had a great kick to it. Perfectly fried little globs, the sesame dressing was delicious as well.\\n\\nI gave it a 3 because I felt the plates were a bit small for the prices. Especially for the meatless dishes. I know the preparation is difficult and the ingredients are good, which contributes to the price but I still felt like Odd Duck gave me the better deal.

We had to actually ask twice for our beers. Also, the wait time for our food was extremely long. I was in no rush so I didn't mind. I can see how it might be a problem for some other diners though. Here's the good thing about the wait for food. The restaurant seemed to know that food time was long so they sent over an edamame and celery slaw without us even asking. Very classy. Another issue that I had was that it seemed that our waiter forgot to order our spring rolls. They came out after our entrees arrived. Enough about the bad part.\\n\\nThe good part is the food. It's excellent. The portions aren't huge and for the most part seem to be more healthy and tasty then at any other restaurant I've been to. I didn't feel bloated at all after our meal.

Luck of the draw I guess as I've had to wait before, but trust me it's worth the wait. \\n\\nWe started with the alsacienne and it was downright delicious. The pastry was flaky enough to bisect with a fork alone. The caramelized onions, smoked pork belly, creme fraiche, and ricotta combined to form a melody of flavors and textures unparalleled in other dishes at other establishments.\\n\\nI opted for the canard confit this time whilst my better half had the special of the night which was fried scallops on a bed of risotto. I'll be the first to say I'm not big on risotto but this was more than palatable, it was inspiring! The scallop itself was breaded and deep fried to perfection, a good solid texture outside, yet warm, soft, and delightful inside. \\n\\nMy confit was simply delectable. How they're able to have the skin crispy enough to snap off in a single clean cut, all the while the meat is fall-off-the-bone tender, I'll never know. My bed of potatoes and arugula was on point. The port jus on its own was a little salty (yes, I sipped it off my plate) but when combined with the duck, took my breath away.\\n\\nService was excellent and ambience was very fitting for a place such as this. You're not going to find food this good for prices this low; they just aren't meant to coexist but this place does it. This is my fourth trip to this restaurant and each time was better than the last.

If I'm on South Congress, I'd definitely come back, but I wouldn't make a point of coming.  The burgers are solid, and the fries are very good.  I like the Challah buns, but I think Phil's buns are better.  Everyone who works there is very nice and helpful, which is important because the process is a bit chaotic.  Today, the line was nearly out the door, and the greeter said it would be a 30 minute wait until we ordered at the counter.  The wait was closer to 20 minutes, though, but the waiters are constantly bringing out meals to everyone and having to navigate through the line to order, the line to get drinks etc...hence the chaotic part.  A couple of specific recommendations:\\n1. Make sure you tell them how you want your burger cooked.  I forgot, and they didn't ask me, and it was much too over cooked\\n2. If you get the turkey burger, I'd recommend asking for the challah bun over what they normally put it on\\n3. If you bring a kid, don't get the grilled cheese.  They put it on the challah bun, but they put the cheese on the outside (assuming to butter and fry the inside), but it just turns into a gross mess.

First, they only accept cash for the cover and don't offer any alternatives except for finding an ATM \\"somewhere a few blocks that way.\\" I didn't find that being safe at night. One of my friends kindly paid my cover. Then I tried to get a drink. The bartender ignored me - he was serving men as they were coming to the bar, handpicking them over all women. Pedro, I believe is the owner of the place, was sitting at the bar and just let that slide. When I talked to Pedro, I suggested to add a note on their website about cash only cover and expressed my concerns about the bartender. Pedro said, \\"There is nothing I can do but I'll pass it along.\\" So then I offered a friend, who paid my cover, to buy him a drink. The same bartender took my friend's order (we were the only two people at the bar) while I was standing right next to her but then he immediately switched to a guy who just showed up to serve him but not me. Both my friend and I expressed our concerns about regular unfair treatment. In return he started waiving his hands and told me to go downstairs to get a drink or leave the restaurant. I found Pedro and asked to refund the money which he did so that I could pay back my friend since I couldn't buy him a drink. I then went to tell  my friend, who chose to celebrate her birthday at Clay Pit, that I had to leave. Right as I was telling her that, a lady who was collecting the money interrupted us with anger and no respect to our space and demanded, \\"You have to pay now or otherwise I would have to kick you out.\\" So now we have an upset friend who was trying to celebrate her birthday with friends but instead she had to experience Clay Pit's staff unprofessionalism and lack of tact. All this is for $7, some women hating bartender, and an indifferent owner of the restaurant. When downstairs, I had a chance to tell Pedro about my experience and my next steps. By that time another women made her way to the bar downstairs. She told Pedro exactly the same story about not communicated cash only policy and inconvenience that comes with it, a women hating bartender who refused her service and overall terrible experience. And what did Pedro say? He said, \\"I don't believe that my bartender is capable of something like that and he doesn't believe us.\\" Dear Clay Pit folks, as I promised Pedro here is the description of my experience along with negative review on FaceBook and Yelp and a pledge of never attending your business.

When you walk in you feel like you are in a Texas BBQ joint. Atmosphere is great.  You then get a tray and go through the sides bar. Creamed corn (which was very creamy and delicious), beans ( plain jane), potato salad ( which was tough and unsavory), coleslaw ( citrusy, but not much flavor). The desserts were intermixed with the salty sides so it interrupted the flow. You then walk past iced beers ( nice) and to the meat cutting area where I chose ribs.  All this on styrofoam divided plates and cheap plastic forks and knives.  We then sat in a booth that had 3 bottles of different BBQ sauces which were great. The ribs were really good, but none of us ate our sides.  Our friends loved the brisket, but left the pecan cobbler ( I thought it was good).

The restaurant is clean and has a family friendly feel, with a TV, computers, console games, and arcade games to play. We ordered the fish and chips, chicken strips and fries, and garlic bread. The fries were okay and were pretty standard steak fries, the chicken was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside, and the garlic bread was pretty bland and not toasted enough. The fish itself was nice and flaky, but the coating went limp within a few minutes of arriving at the table and became inedible and difficult to chew.\\n\\nTo their credit, they apologized profusely and insisted on giving us a refund while also remaking the fish with an altered batter mixture and a fresh order of fries. The second batch of fish was somewhat better, but only two pieces stayed crispy, and the others quickly went as limp as the first batch did, perhaps because they didn't cook as long as the crispy pieces. We appreciate their effort and willingness to fix it, and neither of us are really sure what was wrong with the batter but we won't order the fish again.\\n\\nWe might come back sometime to try some pizza or other things off the menu."},{"name":"Blue Star Donuts","address":"1155 SW Morrison St, Ste 102","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Best donut shop ever.

The goat cheese worked well with the fritters , and the soft boiled egg went well with the pork trotter, wilted arugula, and mushrooms. Next up were the sweetbreads and pork belly (special of the evening). The sweetbreads were definitely the star of the show: they melted in your mouth, along with the strongly flavored brussels sprouts and chunks of thickly cut bacon.

Much like Icarus, I fell victim of my own hubris. When asked what spice level I preferred (1-10), and despite warnings from Mama Noy, I opted for an 8. My friends, I am here to tell you that despite this tactical error, this was some of the most flavorful and expertly prepared Pad Thai I have ever had the pleasure of devouring. Now, the spice? Yes, this dish was one of the 2-3 most spicy things I've ever experienced. Through the tears and a nose flowing like a river, I very nearly finished the dish.

In the land of ho-hum cuisine that is Brookline Village, this place could have been a beacon of light. I've been here a few times now, and my experiences have been consistent.\\n\\nThe good: the food. Food is good here, which is why it gets the stars. I personally like their lunch menu better. In the lunch menu they have a chicken sandwich to die for. In the dinner menu, the shredded beef with rice and beans is excellent. I'd recommend having the shredded beef (slightly sweet) with some hot sauce. And of course, the trio empanadas is always a good appetizer choice.\\n\\nThe bad: they can't seem to handle even moderate traffic. If they get busy (most of the time), service really suffers. From the ignoring bartender who takes just a little too long to make that drink, to the absentee waiter that doesn't serve water unless you ask for it, who seems flustered (or insincere), who brings the wrong wine, who tries to hurry you out of the restaurant (I could go on). Only bright light in the service department was the gracious/friendly hostess.\\n\\nI wish you the best of luck Orinoco.

Unfortunately I don't get to have a lot of barbecue I mainly rely on Rudy is back in San Antonio as my go to barbecue joint. But whenever I have a friend who is willing to go with me I always take advantage. LOL. So we strolled into here found that sign that says what's available and thought wow this place must really be that good that they have to let people know when they run out of food. We walk in, wait in the long line. And finally serve ourselves and order some brisket a pound of ribs and a chopped beef sandwich, along with the mac and cheese. We sat down by the road and couldn't help but see how beautiful it was outside looking to the park and looking at the pretty outdoor area. Overall I felt so Austin to be there. Now I had to webs and I thought they were very good they were large full of meat and very delicious however they tasted very close to pork meaning ham which isn't my favorite kind of taste when I'm having barbecue ribs I'd like to taste more of a run flavor I mean the whole reason I get to have ribs is so that I don't have to taste normal ham. However the brisket was very good very good flavoring and a good amount of fat. My God the brisket fell apart just when I picked it up with a fork which says a lot. And the mac & cheese was pretty good as well.

Our server, Gabby, started off nice but it quickly declined.  I will admit that she was at the table explaining how to avoid injury and one table guest was speaking.  We told him to listen to her but she just took on an attitude from that point on with us that was just rude.  She could not keep up with refills.  Every time she picked up something from or placed something on our table, she did it in an annoying singing way.  I can best describe this as singing the same note for every word except the last one, in which she went up to a high note to finish.  \\"I'll take THIS\\", \\"Here you GO\\", \\"How are we all DOING?\\".  This is a poor service technique and became incredibly annoying after what wound up being a three hour experience.  She was able to turn three other tables two times in the time it took her to complete our dining experience.  We were there from 7:30PM until just after 11:00PM because it took forever for her to serve each course.  She also messed up my salad order with the kitchen two times.\\n\\nWe enjoyed the food and the conversation.

Now, on to the review.\\n\\nThe location is right in downtown Atlanta with various other establishments all around. There's a parking deck right behind/beside the Hooter's that charges $6. The place was crowded as I went on a Friday night. I've also visited the Mall of GA location, which was nicer facility-wise. The service was okay. Our waitress did check on us a few times, but wasn't too helpful with the menu or friendly. She was more focused on another table that she was either friends with or because it was a man, she'd thought she'd get more tip from him. She was also hesitant to take my smoked wings voucher rather than making an effort to check its validity with the manager when I presented the voucher to her as well as explained what it was when we were ordering. \\n\\nThe food took a while to come out. I'm aware it was a weekend day and busy, but an establishment in this location and size should be prepared for a packed house. I also ordered a \\"make-your-own\\" burger along with an order of the smoked wings to share and my friend also got another order of regular hot wings. My two friends arrived before me and got some fries with cheese while they waited for me to arrive. The burger was just okay. The patty itself was good, but I paid extra to add bacon and guacamole which was not worth it. There was about half a strip of bacon, so I barely tasted it and the guac was tasteless with a hint of sourness. I did enjoy the smoked wings. We got it bone-in with the garlic habanero dry rub, which was delicious. I didn't try to hot wings, but my friends liked it. They also really enjoyed the fries and cheese as well. \\n\\nOverall, the food is decent, but service leaves more to be desired."},{"name":"Ramen Danbo","address":"1333 Robson Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4.5","text":"Long Wait, Rude and Unimpressive Food\\n\\nOk I rarely write a review and it takes a lot for me to say something but in my recent experience here I feel it's so bad that I need to share with others. \\n\\nFirst there was a line out the door and if the staff configured and seated properly the wait would have been much shorter. Good thing it wasn't raining because if it did it would have made it even worse. \\n\\nSecond when our party was asked to come inside they asked us to stand just inside the door while they prepped the table. No problem!  They had a smaller party of two come inside and in order for us to let them through we could only take a couple steps forward in the very narrow corridor. Trying to be a good citizen right? WRONG!  The server then rudely and forcefully told me that I needed to wait to be seated?  Huh??  I was moving out the way. Then after we were seated the same jerk comes to the table to ask us to give up the table (after the long wait and cattle herding) and I had to insist that my wife and small child were in the bathroom!!  \\n\\nLastly we had the ramen and it's not worth the price, wait or aggravation. While not horrible I'd be generous with a 6 out of 10 on the food. Also the server forgot to enter and order and then blamed us for not ordering. Isn't it obvious that one person in our party is just sitting there with no food that they would be motivated to have ordered their food??\\n\\nOverall 1 out of 5 stars as there are many better options within 100 yards of this place.

A staple for Indian cuisine...what's the big deal?\\n\\nInstead, you get your choice of some vegetarian dish, a chicken curry dish, and chicken tikka (no masala )\\n\\nYou also have many side dishes like rice, bean soup , salad and mint sauces, chili sauces, etc.\\n\\nChicken tikka was cooked inconsistently; some pieces undercooked, some tender.

Portland will never be Memphis, Kansas City or Austin, but that doesn't mean you can't get some decent BBQ in town, especially with Podnah's.\\n\\nOur group ordered the smoked platter that was recommended by the server.  Chicken was ok, little dry.  Ribs were bad, hadn't smoked nearly long enough and probably at too high of a temp.  The meat was chewy and stuck to the bone.  Pulled pork had way too much sauce and some big chunks of fat that hadn't rendered out during smoking, another sign that they are not on top of things in the BBQ department.  The hot link, to be fair, was pretty good.  Its definitely hot.  Brisket was ok, had a decent smoke ring but again a bit on the dry side.  Ribs and brisket are the two gauges of a BBQ place and both were way sub-par here.\\n\\nAll of the sides we tried were middle of the road.  Nothing great, but nothing offensive either.\\n\\nThe sauces were pretty hit or miss, avoid the white sauce at all costs, its disgusting.\\n\\nI got the mint julep, again at the servers suggestion.  It was a nice touch coming in a copper cup, but it was piled incredibly high with crushed ice, like a snow cone, that promptly got all over the table when i tried to stir it.

It's fine for a restaurant to have certain rules, but don't be aggressive towards customers... who are theoretically giving you a tip.

We still haven't gotten drinks at this point, so we order water... only to be told that the owner won't allow us to have water unless we order a soda too. The waitress called the owner an asshole... and wouldn't give us WATER. Which means she checked with the owner first if she could serve WATER. I was out the door after that and am so glad.

I agree with others that it is probably the best fried chicken in austin at the moment.  The husband thought it was a bit too spicy, but I really liked it.  It was hot, juicy, and not greasy.  I have eaten at just about every fried chicken place in this city and Gus is a welcome addition.  If you are coming just for the chicken, come here.  The price is good and especially good for the quality.  The staff was also nice and very friendly.\\n\\nSo, why three stars?  Well, in short, the sides.  They taste like Sysco and I don't mean that in a good way.  I have eaten many many meals from canned Sysco and I can spot the lack of homemade goodness via short cutting.  The cole slaw was probably the best one I tried.  It was sweet, but it complements the spicy chicken well enough.  I personally hated the beans and I especially hated the Mac and cheese.  The baked beans taste canned and not fresh.  They have that overly sweet, slightly watery vibe that comes from canned baked beans.  Ugh.  The Mac and cheese was barely lukewarm and tasted like it was from a Kraft box.  The Mac was so cold that when it arrived at the table, the shredded cheese put on top never even came close to melting.  My brother was obsessed with Kraft as a kid and we ate it a lot.  I never touch the stuff and only make it from scratch at home.  After one bite, I tasted the familiar twang of the cheese flavor coming from a flavor packet instead of quality ingredients.   They may tell me I'm wrong, but they flat out didn't taste good.\\n\\nOverall: they need to seriously step up the sides if they want to be competitive in the austin food scene, especially downtown.  \\nI'll come back for the chicken and slaw.  The chicken really is extremely good and definitely worth a trip if you are coming in for that.

I opted to tip the person who brought me the food rather than the ladies ringing it up.  I did notice she dangled my change over the tip bowl rather than hand it directly to me.  Don't get me wrong, I believe in tipping, I just don't understand why I should tip the person ringing in my food, the person bringing my food, and the bartender who poured my beer.  This can all be simplified by making them all into 1 person called a waiter/waitress.  We split the el diablo, and the  buffalo bill.  The burgers them selves were rather bland, but the bun was excellent.  I had to add salt to the burger.  We eat out quite often, 4-5 times/week, I am not a salt-a-holic and I can't remember the last time I had to grab the salt shaker.  I think the next time I am craving a good burger and a good beer, I will head to Bender Bar and Grill.  The food is better, the beer selection larger, everything is cheaper, and they actually wait on you at your table.

Highlands. It looks like a little house. How quaint. From the outside, it seems like it doesn't have much space inside, but it does. They have a nice, covered deck with heating. So they can fit a decent number of people. However, it is still cramped. \\n\\nWe sat and got our waters and French Bread. The bread was great. It tasted fresh and had a nice sound as I broke off a piece. It was good bread. \\n\\nThen we waited and waited... and waited until our server finally got our orders. I have no idea why she was taking so long. She seemed pre-occupied. We were so hungry that we just ate our bread waiting for our server to take our orders.\\n\\nFinally she came by and took our orders. We tried a bowl of the Wild Mushroom and Chicken Soup and a tasting of the Cream of Celeriac Soup with Chestnut Puree. What's the difference between the tasting and the bowl? Not much. The tasting looked just a bit smaller than the bow.\\n\\nI liked my Wild Mushroom Chicken Soup. I wouldn't call it comforting since this didn't taste like Campbell's. It was more exquisite. It was like your mom turned into Marla and made you a very fancy Chicken Soup. It had a great, earthy flavor to it because of the wild mushrooms. I also loved the broth. It was a great soup. Make sure to soak up all the soup with the French Bread. That's an extra treat. \\n\\nI also tried their Marinated Beets with a Red Onion, Arugula, Orange and Feta Salad. It was okay. I love beets, but even then, this wasn't an exciting dish. I would just skip it. \\n\\nFor my entree, I tried the Roast Half Duck. The duck came out great. I loved the sauce on the duck. I also liked the apple, walnut, and rutabaga compote. The sweetness matched well with the duck meat. I thought the duck was cooked well. It was a great dish.\\n\\nI also tried the Sea Scallops with the Saffron Broth. I liked the Saffron Broth. The Scallops were cooked nicely. Once again, use the French Bread to soak up the saffron broth and eat it. Yum. \\n\\nFor dessert, we tried the Dried Cherry and Almond Tart. I loved this dessert. Cherry Pie is one of my favorite pies, and this was like a Cherry Pie on cocaine. Maybe that's what that powdery white stuff was on top of it. I recommend this dessert if you like cherry pies. \\n\\nI liked the food here. It is good quality, decent food. The service here sucks. Everything was slow. After we got our soup and small plate, the entrees took forever. Our entire dinner lasted over 2 hours. And we only had 3 courses. WTF?\\n\\nI mentioned this before, but our server was not concerned with us. She seemed like she was too busy, and seemed like she wanted to avoid us as much as possible. At least she refilled our water once.\\n\\nAlso, we were eating French Bread. French Bread makes a lot of crumbs. Usually, a restaurant with this price-point would have the server come up and scrape the crumbs off so the table would look neat. She never did that until we finished eating. We're not snobs or anything... actually we are snobs. I expected a restaurant like Babette's would pay attention to stuff like that. We're not dining at the Olive Garden. \\n\\nI don't know what our server's deal was. Maybe her cat died. Who knows?"},{"name":"Nunzio's Pizzeria","address":"195 State St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I just stopped in for a late lunch and the owner Ricky waited on me at the counter.

And thus was introduced to the name.\\n\\nThe quality of this product draws me back time and time again.  All their products are, to the best of my knowledge, made on premises, and are fresh, as in daily fresh.  \\n\\nCutting straight to the chase, the highlight of this bakery is the Seventh Heaven Cake.  Others have written of it, and they are not wrong.  If you have the means, I highly recommend the petite torte or the larger torte, rather than the cupcake.  The cupcake will give you a taste, but it's just not the same.  The petite torte provides much more servings, at a reasonable price, and is, quite frankly, much better.\\n\\nThe difference is in the layering of chocolate.  The cupcake doesn't have as much, and has more...I believe it's a white chocolate mousse.  The torte provides seven distinct layers, that all play off each other.\\n\\nI had the opportunity to introduce this to a friend only last night, and it was an absolute pleasure to watch her face as she took her first bite, closed her eyes, and made sounds of great appreciation.\\n\\nThey have a huge selection of truffles, of all varieties.  I have tried several and have yet to find one that is lacking in flavour or quality.   Most recently I had a Chocolate Kahlua truffle, which was fabulous, but my favourite of these has to be the chocolate caramels with sea salt.  In fact, I bought a box of 20 for about 18 bucks.  Well worth it.  I could make myself sick off of these.\\n\\nI also highly recommend their version of a pound cake.  It's sold in a small rack in front of the register and it's not quite a pound cake, it has more sour cream in it, I believe, but it's very reminiscent.  You will not be sorry if you take this home.\\n\\nI also caved and bought a small bag of caramel popcorn with hazelnuts and chocolate swirls.  I had a weak moment.\\n\\nThe price is a little higher than your run of the mill stuff...but that's because the other stuff is crap.  Seriously, the only place that holds a candle to JaCiva's is the Moondance Chocolatier, but they specialize in chocolate.  The cakes here more than push JaCiva's over the top."},{"name":"Hopdoddy Burger Bar","address":"1400 S Congress Ave, Ste A190","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"We had been looking for a burger place to go and after looking at all the reviews decided to try this.

The line on a hot night was long but tolerable. They really have the operation down to a science as the line meanders by the bar so you can order a beverage while you wait. After you put in your order with the help of a server, You are given a table number based on your in or outside choice and then you pay. Food is brought to the table with fries acting as an appetizer which makes sense to me so you can enjoy them with your drink. Definitely will return when I am back in Austin.

I couldn't decide between the beef tenderloin or the lamb so he brought me out a half and half kabob.  And I have to say  that the beef won that showdown.  And i didn't ask for this special dish he offered to have it done for me.  \\nThey had the belly dancer there which was a little odd since there wasn't more than 5 tables, it would have been a little more comfortable if there were more tables for her to dance for.  And the tip baskets did catch us off guard since we didn't have any cash. \\nHey a girl has to make a living though, just because they are there doesn't mean you have to tip her(someone else's review).  We just made a note on our credit card slip to split some of it up for her.  \\nThe owner came over and introduced herself to us and to check on everything.

However, the chicken I had at the Antigua location left much to be desired.  Fortunately, this location has better choices (I usually go for the chicken strips) and each entree comes with corn tortillas.  The yuca fries were pretty good as well but I decided to opt for regular fries after I realized the yuca fries were served in smaller portions.  I was disappointed that I couldn't find any BBQ sauce for my chicken strips, but ketchup worked just as well.  In addition, Fresh-A-Peel is located inside for those seeking a healthier alternative as well as babycakes (vegan baked goods)."},{"name":"Punjab Palace","address":"109 Brighton Ave","city":"Allston","stars":"4","text":"Outstanding and very very tasty and carefully prepared food.

Alas, I long for the day when a respectable restaurant will open its doors in Atlantic Station.\\n\\nFood: With the exception of a few minor deviations, the menu at Lobby is largely comprised of American Continental cuisine. During my recent visit, I opted for the Mexican chicken soup for an appetizer and the grilled pork tenderloin for an entree. The soup was generously portioned, but under-seasoned and devoid of a single piece of chicken. Unfortunately, the pork tenderloin left much to be desired as well; the dish was essentially four measly portioned, and poorly prepared, pork medallions. Given the cost ($23), I was expecting something far more substantial, it terms of both quality and quantity.\\n\\nService: The service was polite, but intermittent. The appetizers were brought out in a timely manner, but there was well over a five minute time lapse between the delivery of the two entrees that were ordered. The waiter indicated that he didn't want the first entree to get cold, but it would seem that the chef would be well aware that both items were on the same ticket and would plan accordingly. The poor quality of the service was particularly surprising considering that the restaurant wasn't even at 20% capacity and the staffing was more than adequate.\\n\\nAtmosphere: The atmosphere at Lobby might best be described as industrial chic. The clientele is mixed, but mostly comprised of individuals in the 20-40 demographic. The dress was primarily casual, but there were a few businessmen in suits at a few of the tables.\\n\\nCost: Overpriced for the quality of the food. Appetizers ranged between $6 and $12, pizzas between $12 and $14, and entrees between $17 and $29. For those prices, the food needed to be impeccable, which simply wasn't the case.\\n\\nOther: During my visit, Lobby was offering a series of dining specials, all of which were mildly reminiscent of something one would expect from an Applebee's franchise. In addition to Thursday being \\"make your own pizza night\\" ($10/person), they were also offering a \\"dinner and a movie\\" promotion, which included a 3 course prix fixe meal and a movie ticket valid at the nearby Atlantic Station Regal ($25/person). Although such promotions might be enticing to a certain demographic, it's not exactly what one would expect from a restaurant touting $25 entrees; my guess is that the high prices and subpar food quality has finally started to affect the bottom line."},{"name":"Maenam","address":"1938 W 4th Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"This is probably my favorite restaurant in the city. It's in the higher end pricewise, but you get a whole lot more for what you pay, and the quality is excellent.\\n\\nTonight, I took two friends out to celebrate the recent graduation of one of them. We started out with some of their cocktails, which are sublime. All of them have very unique flavors which combine sourness, sweetness, saltiness and in a few, spiciness - the essences of Thai cuisine. Even the virgin cocktail that one of my friends had managed to have a lovely balance of the elements to present a drink that became more mysterious and enticing as you proceeded to quaff it.\\n\\nAppetizers we had were the deep-fried oysters with a spicy citrus sauce, and tom kha (spicy Thai soup with coconut milk and kafir lime). The oysters were fresh, lightly battered and fried, and were accented very nicely with the sauce which gave the sea flavor a bit of an extra kick. The soup was gorgeous, with a velvety kind of texture to it. A lighter flavor than a fondue, it stood out in its heat and sourness and revitalized the taste buds. By this point my cocktail had been finished and so I moved onto a Thai iced tea, which had a great combination of condensed milk, Thai tea and cane sugar, giving it a smokiness that really kicked it up a notch.\\n\\nThen came the mains. First was a special red duck curry, which was rich, smooth and gamy with a touch of sweetness. Then there was a pad thai which is always excellent. Next was an eight-spiced fish which was tender and a bit flaky amidst the crisp-fried outside with lovely spices including shallots, basil and ginger to give it an edge. Finally was their banana blossom salad, which balances sweetness from a bunch of angles to give a wonderful aroma. I personally love the salads the most in this restaurant.\\n\\nDessert were their rice flour donuts with a Thai iced tea ice cream. The donuts were hot and crunchy and much airier than normal flour donuts, and the ice cream helped to modulate the flavor so that they went down just perfectly. \\n\\nAll in all, the meal came out to $140 before taxes and tip. It's not the most expensive meal in the city but it can come close (though we did go overboard). However, I think it's very much worth it. My friends agree (and one had had a huge bowl of ice cream just before and could eat everything!)."},{"name":"Potbelly Sandwich Shop","address":"2096 NE Stucki Ave","city":"Hillsboro","stars":"4","text":"I guess I just don't get what's supposed to be so great about this place.

It's not a good deal at all. \\n\\nThe space is a conundrum. It's supposed to be homey I guess, but their faux-authenticity is betrayed by the fact that you probably parked between Starbucks and Chipotle to come here. They try to relate to Hillsboro by putting up some historic Oregon pictures, but then fail to spell these historic things correctly (Eugene has a \\"g\\" in it, guys). \\n\\nI will give them credit for serving Coke AND Pepsi, which means that they get that there are two sorts of people in the world.

It has all my favorite things in it and in good portion too! It's a perfect balance of sweet/savory with good texture. The croutons that come with it are da bomb (do people still say that?) or I guess I should say LIT (that seems popular among the high schoolers these days). Anyway, the croutons are made from cornbread... I think, and I could just eat a whole bowl full of this stuff. It's crunchy and buttery and just awesome sauce. \\n\\nHamburger Steak (3/5)- This dish is okay. It comes with 2 small hamburger patties with melted cheese and an egg over as well as a side of rice and gravy.  I'm assuming this is their copycat version of Loco Moco. The flavors are there, but we were disappointed by the small size of the dish especially for the price we paid for it. The ingredients in this dish aren't expensive and we just felt like the price for this dish didn't match up.\\n\\n15 minutes of flame (4/5)- A nice iced coffee drink but a tad sweet for me.

And they add guacamole to the burrito with no extra charge. \\n\\nMaria's is a no-frills, mom-and-pop kind of Mexican place. It looks unimpressive from the outside.

It would be a while before I could come back to this place to enjoy a burger.\\n\\nI'm a naturally slow eater.  And why not?  I like to enjoy and chew my food and really taste it.  My dining partner, a female whose name I will not divulge, was the exact opposite.  I wasn't even halfway done with my burger when she finished inhaling hers.  You think I exaggerate, but you're mistaken.  \\"You gonna finish those fries?\\"  Um.  Not anymore.  Thanks for ruining my appetite.  This oblivious person proceeded to eat the rest of my fries as I tried to choke down the last half of my burger as she chewed with her mouth open.  After waging war on the rest of my fries, she started licking her fingers.  But it wasn't the cute *smack, smack, mmm* licking.  It was the \\"I'm trying to stick my fingers down my throat\\" licking. Ugh.  \\"The restroom is right down there if you need to wash your hands.\\"  Didn't get the hint.  \\"I can't waste a drop of this precious juice.\\"  She was referring to the juices from the demolished burger she murdered, as she ran her finger over the white paper.  She would probably give this place six stars, and some.\\n\\nAs for me, it took me a long time to get over that image in my mind, which I associated with Hopdoddy.  \\n\\nWhen I finally came back, it was with my favorite dining pal.  She ordered a shake with her burger and the truffle fries.  I ordered some scrumptious burger with goat cheese and an egg on top.  I think I may have had to unhinge my mouth for that one.  It was their featured special burger, not on the menu.  And it was delicious. My friend ate her food at the same slow pace as me and I slowly healed from that last daunting experience at Hopdoddy.  \\n\\nOh, I have to say that the truffle fries are exquisite.  Mmm!  And if you love eggs and have never had a runny, oozing egg on top of a juicy burger patty, well, here's the place to try it.  The Oreo shake that my friend so generously shared with me was quite satisfying too!\\n\\nThe third and last time I went to eat at Hopdoddy, I had the Magic Shroom.  And it was magical.  My friend got the Continental Club and told me it was one of the best turkey burgers she'd had in a while.  I got the truffle fries again.  So good!\\n\\nSo, the moral of this story?  Chew your food.  Just kidding.  The point of this story is that this place is so darn good, it can overshadow any bad memory.  Yum. Make some new, preferably happy, memories.  Try Hopdoddy.  It does live up to the hype.

I have been many times before for personal and business occations and have had better food experiences. Now the veggie pakoras are my favorite, but the chicken coconut curry was so blah that I had to get my food comped. The chicken was dark meat (which I hate) and made me wish I got the veggie version instead. Now when Tarka (their \\"fast food\\" version) can have delicious white meat... why can't they? They are charging me 5 to 6 dollars more per entree for not so good food. Again I've had their veggie Korma, veggie coconut curry and so much more.. and was impressed then.\\n\\nNow onto ambience ... it was packed, noise level was fine and it had great energy. They don't overly Indian decorate.. which in no way was said racist. But many places I eat at represent the culture in the colors chosen and decorations that are hung.  \\n\\nThe service was good and the waitress you can tell was busy.  We had a group of 7 people in our group and my biggest pet peeve of the night was ......... automatically adding 18 percent gratuity to my check. Why should I have to pay $8.43 in tip on a $22.00 ticket? I understand if there was more than 10 people.. but 7?? Seriously? The waitress was nice.. but didn't do enough for me to spend $9 dollars in tip on her!  \\n\\nSo everyone remember that if you go in groups.. hell ..... just to hang out.. you will be charged an out the a@s gratuity percentage!  Be prepared for $8+ just in tip.\\n\\nOver all its a yummy place.. most plates are $11.00 (for veggie) and up and you will have to find parking nearby, as the lot gets full fast.

It's not that it was bad - for it was fresh and not spoiled - but it had no mustard in it and way too much sugar and no vinegar.  I have never had potato salad like this.  Their fries were quite good.  The iced tea was OK, but kind of tannic and acrid.  Overall, the chicken was very juicy and perfectly cooked.  I'm not a huge fan of their spicy batter, but out of the 4 pieces of chicken I ate, I did not get a single bite that was dry; or even close to it.

Sometimes an Asian food buffet price reflects numerous meat entrees, but this one had the right kind of spread, including salads, dessert, and vegetarian options.\\n\\nI ended up taking two full plates of food and many cups of the milky tea. The tea was my favorite - it was comforting, hot, and full of flavor. From a food perspective, the best item was the chicken and mushrooms. The sauce was well-spiced, and it tasted so good! The chicken curry was also tasty, and the noodles were fine. The lentil soup tasted like full lentils blended with water in a blender; the soup wasn't as rich as I was hoping for. I tried the veggie momos, and they were cold and missing some filling. They had too much dough for my liking. We ended up ordering another authentic tea with butter called poecha, and it was certainly interesting. It was pretty rich, and the butter added an underlying flavor that was different from any other tea I've had in the past.\\n\\nThe people working here are helpful and timely. When I seemed concerned about the lunch buffet, one of the guys working there took the time to walk me through the offerings and made me feel comfortable with what I could get.

When I first visited it, I couldn't find the hours of operation anywhere. It also gives the vibe that the place only delivers and caters because there is an online ordering page. Even with a couple of pictures of the restaurant on the home page, I was very confused about whether or not people could dine in. Also, there is no mention of the lunch buffet.

From the exterior windows looking up and in, the decor appears appealing. Unfortunately, with the barrage of Earls, Cactus Clubs, Moxie's and subsequently Milestones in this city, they all begin to look and feel the same after awhile, but on this occasion I was jumping into the sea of chain restaurants head first and making my way up the stairs towards the hostess station. \\n\\nFirst Impressions: \\nWhile quickly scanning the room, I notice it is quite empty,( a few people in the bar area and 3 tables in the dining room) which is odd for a Saturday evening around 9:30pm. With the overall atmosphere lacking, we contemplated turning around and trying our luck elsewhere, but decided to wait to see how long it would take for the hostess to notice that anyone was there. Less than a minute had gone by and the hostess came to seat us. She asked us for a first and last name for the table, which I wasn't expecting since we weren't putting our names down for the wait list. She explained that it was in order for them to offer a better overall experience on repeat visits- uh... sure. It appears I am now committed to this dinner. (Sigh) Not having overly high expectations at this point, she seats and informs us of all the food & drink specials as well as the fact that Milestones has been the only restaurant to lower their everyday beer prices by more that $2. \\n\\nA few minutes pass and a waitress comes by with water, repeats the specials and asks for our drink orders. We were undecided as we were caught up in conversation and hadn't begun to look, so asked for a few minutes. That was the last time we saw this waitress. The Bartender seeing that no one was working the tables in our section comes over and asks us for our drink orders. My bf and I both love Mojitos which we see on the drink list, but we like them made with Malibu instead of regular rum and with the addition of sliced cucumber to the mix- If you've never tried it, you have to, it's liquid heaven. So we asked if this was possible, having a back up beverage in our heads in case it was a no go but the bartender was more than happy to make these for us which is always great in my books. \\nSo we're back into conversation mode, enjoying our delicious cocktails and at this point have only briefly scanned the menu, \\nNow for the menu: \\nI have to say I was impressed at the changes they've made since the last time I had visited a Milestone's. There were a lot of fresh ingredients and thought put into the menu. We decided to order an appetizer to start and had it down to either the Baked Goat Cheese & Slow Roasted Garlic Flatbread Plate or the Bocconcini Garlic Bread The bartender who seemed to be running off his feet to accommodate the bar and now all the tables in the dining room, came by to ask us if we would like to order. We threw at him our two options, His vote was the Bocconcini Garlic Bread all the way. Done. I decided on the Top Sirloin w/ Trio of Signature Steak Sauces which comes with seasonal vegetables and garlic mashed potatoes and my boyfriend opted for the Grilled Mediterranean Chicken and a side of Milestone's Mac & Cheese. \\n\\nThe Food: \\nThe Bocconcini Garlic Bread arrives and it looks delicious. A baguette sliced across with boccocini cheese stuffed in- Baked , olive tapenade, roasted grape tomatoes and drizzled with olive oil. So fantastic! I could have just eaten that for dinner. The Grilled Mediterranean Chicken that my bf ordered looked fabulous and I admit I was having food envy. two chicken breasts stacked with a layer of goat cheese in  the middle, on a bed of chick peas, roasted grape tomatoes and Bok Choy with a pomegranate molasses drizzle. WOW! The chicken was tender, the goat cheese was like velvet on your tongue and the vegetables although a bit bland, added great texture and colour to the overall meal. His gourmet Mac and Cheese. involved a smoked Gouda and Goat Cheese cream sauce with Roma tomatoes to off set the bland colour palette, was tasty but needed the addition of salt and pepper to fire it up. Although it was good, I believe the price point is off for the size of the this side dish and would be better suited at around $4.99 instead of the $6.99 listed. \\nNow for my meal. As I had mentioned I was having food envy so that should give some insight. I should know better not to order a steak from a non steakhouse, but I craved it this day. \\nMy steak was average at best. no real flavour, but at least cooked properly for my request of medium. The sauces that accompanied it were OK, not my fav. mashed potatoes were bland, cold & lumpy and the green beans looked overcooked & wrinkled. Needed huge improvements. \\nOverall:\\nOur Bartender/ 'Server' made the experience- great people skills. \\nFood although hit and miss, has promise.\\nWould be willing to try this location again, Just no steak next time."},{"name":"Pier 6 Boston Waterfront","address":"1 8th St","city":"Charlestown","stars":"3.5","text":"It's nice to have a place by the water open again, Charlestown is certainly really limited in this aspect, but Pier 6 is amateur hour. \\n\\n1) When I ordered a scotch with a splash of soda with a twist, they gave me a lemon slice - amateur hour.\\n2) They don't carry Mt.

Same thing with the outside bar. \\n4) I ordered an entree, which we didn't receive until about 90 minutes after the appetizers arrived - now they were kind enough to remove the drinks from the bill, but they really had no choice (could have been the waiter's mistake). The entree stunk, and the apps were OK at best. \\n\\nI don't mean to be too hard on them, but if you were hoping for a big change now that they remodeled, think again.

I came here with friends for brunch and was terribly unimpressed with our server and the food.  In fairness to her, she was friendly but everything else fell short.  First off, we had to sit and painstakingly listen to her stammer out the specials for the day that she was READING off of her notes.  When we asked her what the first special again, she had to refer back to her notes.  SERIOUSLY??  You just read it 30 seconds ago!  Then she never refilled our water pitcher.  And our food took over 45 minutes to come out.  Our server never once stopped by during that wait and let us know the status of our order or check in on us or I don't know, refill our water pitcher?  So we were just left sitting in our booth wondering what the heck was going on with the kitchen.  To make matters worse, the restaurant wasn't even crowded then.\\n\\nWhen our food did come out, my huevos special was underwhelming.  Actually, let me re-phrase because it was huevo since it came with one egg.  $13 for A egg, bland refried beans smashed between corn tortillas, pickled green beans, and a chorizo I think is frankly overpriced.

Cassie (my date) arrived just after 8 looking radiant and ordered a Rusty Nail. Awesome. \\n\\nI ordered us a bottle of Valle Reale 2009 Montepulciano d'Abruzzo which was quite nice, full bodied with lot's of juicy berry notes. We decided on the 7 course tasting menu which would be designed around our bottle of wine. Seriously?! What? That's freaking rad. No table received the same dishes across their tasting menu an at $45 dollars per person it is an amazing deal. (They offer 11 courses for $60, they also have an extensive al a carte menu if you want to choose your own courses\\n\\nOur first course arrived: Cream of Celeriac Soup. The soup was a thick and hardy puree of the lovely winter vegetable. Warm and earthy with perfect seasoning. Within the small bowl floated a crostini with shaved Parmesan balanced on it. I snapped the still crip bread with my spoon and mixed the cheese into a spoonful and marveled in the flavour of the salty sweet Parmesan alongside the richness of the celeriac and the crunch of the crostini. Divine, and Cassie echoed my sentiment.\\n\\nWe discussed what brought us to Vancouver as the second course arrived: Parmesan Sformato with tomato and zucchini. This airy soft souffle of Parmesan and egg melted in my mouth and brought audible gasps and sighs from us both. We smeared it on the rustic bread and when that was done just ate itby the forkful with the cold sour zucchini and tomato coulis as condiments. So far... winning at dining.\\n\\nOur third course... Our waiter said it was a salad of Butter Lettuce, Gorgonzola and spiced walnuts, but I immediately realized that the greens on our plate were frisee. I'm not usually a fan of frisee but with the heavy bold creamy dressing of Gorgonzola and the spiced walnuts (which were fucking astonishing and I want to try to recreate) the frisee with it's peppery notes and more fibrous nature, worked. Well.\\n\\nCourse, the fourth... Our first pasta course after three antipasti (appetizer) courses. This course we were informed was called their Lucianico Lasagna. A cream based lasagna with small chunks of cured pork, it was the one course of the evening that didn't blow me out of the water. It was under seasoned and a bit weighed down in the thick creamy sauce that glued the layers of soft lasagna noodle together. The noodles themselves were cooked to perfection with just enough tooth to give a bit of bite to them. I heard that pasta at La Quercia was prepared to order and I saw no reason to doubt this.  Cassie agreed it wasn't her favourite and I looked longingly into her eyes as the waiter poured more wine.\\n\\nOur second pasta course and fifth course of the evening was a Veal and Spinach Aglonotti in a Veal stock and butter reduction. Simplicity itself and it manifested in such a pure form that I would have to say it was one of the best things I had put in my mouth in the last year. Perfect pasta around a tender bit of veal and spinach with the rich buttery stock just coating the tongue. Washed down with the Montepulciano I could have died happy at that moment having achieved food heaven. However, their was more to come.\\n\\nAlmost an hour and most of a bottle of red later our 6th and penultimate course arrived. Thinly sliced pork chop cut from a centre rib cut based on the bone made it a tenderloin and the plate was dotted with Brussels sprouts and small potato croquettes. Sauced in a basic mustard and stock reduction the pork was able to speak for itself without being overwhelmed by it's sauce. And boy did it speak. In volumes. Equal parts savoury and  rich with a wealth of flavour that spoke to an in-house roasted bone stock, while the perfectly cooked tenderloin soaked up everything the sauce had to offer. We scraped up every morsel and as I started to get full realized their was only the dessert course remaining.\\n\\nEnter... the Chocolate Nemesis with in-house vanilla bean ice cream. Now not only does this bastard have the most amazing name for a dessert pretty much ever, it's also a flourless chocolate cake so for anyone with a gluten allergy or whatever fucking problem you have with a little flour (seriously, everyone is a god-damned Celiac lately) is fine eating this little piece of Heaven. It starts out like a soft brownie, kinda dense but with little airy pockets and then as it hits your tongue a cascade of rich dark chocolate coalesceses into essentially fudge and flavour that is instant foodgasm. Mixed with the ability of the cream in the ice cream to cut into the sugar and egg of the cake each bite was savoured long before being swallowed.\\n\\nWe finished up, both fully satiated and actually quite full. The bottle of wine had lasted all seven courses and we gathered ourselves to pay the bill.

But the \\"Johnny-on-the-spot, hop-to-it-doddy, host-with- the- most\\" was there to guide me through the process.  I was instructed to \\"go to the kitchen and place my order\\" and then return to the dining area where they would have a table waiting for me.  \\n\\nThe process went very smoothly as we placed an order for a Terlingua (translation: frito-chili pie burger) and a Llano Poblano (peper jack, poblano chiles, and bacon).  Things really got exciting when I noticed that they've got chipotle ketchup and a fancy mustard on tap.  When we found our table, the drinks were already there.  And, last but not least, the food came out fast!  \\n\\nThe flavor of the cute, little shoestring fries didn't do it for me, but the poblano peppers on the Llano Poblano did.  And the cheese, chiles, and bacon make a deliciously holy matrimony.

The line for this place tends to extend outdoors, but the waiters and servers are excellent at making you comfortable and help pass the time by taking drink orders while you wait.

The shakes are pretty damn good as well.  We once ordered the kids a frozen banana and chocolate shake concoction to share, and I swear I almost regret not having ordered one myself!  It gets busy here, so one tip is to have the driver look for street parking, while dropping off the passenger(s) to hold your spot in line.

Err...\\n\\nThen onto the extra noodle, which this preggo lady needs everytime these days. The noodle was fast and for $2 extra I guess it's typical. I was with company and we all were hungry still so we ordered two, thinking I could wrap any extra up to go later but they said no, store rules that they only wrap appies to go and not noodle. Hmm strange rules, especially one that you don't specify when I ordered two extra noodles... Service was also slow and not super attentive for a quiet time.\\n\\nWe probably won't return when there are so many amazing ramen places nearby that is much better and bigger in size, actually it just needed some toppings with much less rules.

I can hear the voices of Yelpers now, \\"We don't care about the sides, just get to the meat!\\"  And I HEAR you, I do, but after four days of BBQ, it was freaking awesome some tasty non-carnivorous options.  Make sure to grab: jalapeno cornbread, peach cobbler (tastes better than it looks), creamed corn, mac and cheese, coleslaw, shoot, try a bit of everything you like - it was all good.\\n\\nAfter the cafeteria-style sides station, you arrive at the meat-carving area.  They sell their meat by the pound, so you can get a couple ribs, a couple slices of brisket, etc. and it will all be weighed. \\n\\nBeware the beef rib: it's enormous and costly (maybe $25-$30). The beef rib is bigger than your head, and the meat is delicious. One person bought it (out of our group of 4), and we all shared what was on our plates as well.  I'd recommend filling one plate completely up with food and sharing it with someone - you can always go back and buy more.\\n\\nAfter a 15-minute intermission, we somehow rolled ourselves outside to ask for a pit tour.  The pit was so interesting - half of the wood used to cook brisket is oak and half is pecan. All other meat gets the oak treatment only. We got to learn about conduction, convection, and radiant heat, how the smokers work, and all the ins-and-outs.\\n\\nThe pit master kept bringing up turkey.  So I had to ask, \\"How many people actually order turkey when they come here?\\"  He replied that a lot of people do, particularly regulars.  Turkey has about 10% fat, while the ribs have between 60%-70% fat.  WHAT?!?!  You could have pushed us over with a feather.  We were simultaneously glad and anxious that we didn't know that fact at the start of our BBQ journey though Austin. \\n\\nOf the five BBQ places we visited here, this was our favorite.

This is by far the best Bon Chon Restaurant in Massachusetts. I will purposely drive 35 mins to the Salem location over a 15 min drive to Cambridge, Lowell, or Allston due to its outstanding service, food quality, and easy parking situation.\\n\\nThings I Like:\\n* Food Consistency. The Tteokbokki is one of our favorite dishes to order and it comes out the same each time we've ordered it. Why is this important? At some of the other locations, its come out different each time (missing an ingredient or noodle type) and wasn't that good. This location really hits it home by making it with the right ingredients, making it fresh, and using the right spicy sauce. I almost forgot to mention the wings because this location also keeps these consistent and high quality. They always come out hot, fresh, and well sauced (both soy garlic and spicy). \\n* Immediate Seating. This location is our secret date night dinner spot. We always get immediate seating when you would expect a wait because its Friday or Saturday night. We've never had to wait more than 2 minutes flat!\\n* Cleanliness. Remarkably clean. Observed the waitstaff wiping down the tables regularly, and for a chicken wing place, there is no smell. You can smell the chicken and other foods in the atmosphere at the other locations, but not this one. Fresh air clean air allows you to enjoy the aroma of your own food which enhances the taste. Floors are clean and so is the bar. \\n* Wait staff and Host are friendly and prompt. I think we've managed to put our order in within the first 10 minutes or less of sitting down each time we've been here. The staff is very friendly and had no problems answering any questions we had. They were accommodating on two occasions when we wanted a large order of wings (30) and instead of splitting 15 soy garlic / 15 spicy, they helped us by accommodating a 20/10 split. I mention this because another location told us that their kitchen didn't do that and cited a vague policy.\\n* Parking. In Salem.. ! Ok so this hasn't got anything to do with the restaurant itself, but this place is on a side street with plenty of street parking, and literally right next to two parking lots. Just an FYI for the adventurous eaters that might hesitate to travel a ways to struggle with parking; you won't struggle.\\n\\nRecommendations for Improvement:\\n* Some more beer selections would be great. They have a good selection now at the bar, but maybe a few more would be good especially when the seasons change. They have an Oktoberfest and Shipyard pumpkin, but the other selections are standard. That said, they have alcohol, so there's not much to complain about."},{"name":"Fuji 1546 Restaurant and Bar","address":"1546 Hancock St","city":"Quincy","stars":"3.5","text":"This is the greatest sushi secrets of the Boston area.

Two appetizers, 5 other dishes, and 3 desserts.   It's a smallish place that fills up quickly (not hurting for business) with warm/friendly service and professional staff.  Both Myers and Chang were in house  (which is always a nice touch and hopefully a good sign that they still care and aren't just at home lounging on mattresses of cash).  Chang was expediting in chef whites and Myers roaming the front of house.  They have done a good job creating a consistent overall vibe/feel---now they should re-taste and re-work their food.\\n\\nI wanted to like this place more, but the food let it down.  It's the problem I have with all 'fusion' restaurants---they almost always promise more (and charge more!) than they can deliver.  Maybe it's my fault, my expectations are too easily raised by a great-sounding menu description, and based on their cleverly market-researched phrases, my imagination for what the food should taste like gets way ahead of what the food actually is.\\n\\nFor example, you pretty much know what to expect when you order the house special fried rice at any local take-out, but when Myers + Chang calls it \\"Genmai Fried Rice\\" and describes it as \\"brown rice, toasted garlic, green beans, sesame, nori, farm egg\\", you expect something a bit better/different for $13(!).  Instead you get a small portion of bland surprisingly greasy brown rice with a sprinkling of forgettable mix-ins.  You end up disappointed and poorer.   \\n\\nFood Ordered:\\n---Scallion pancakes: Overfried/greasy. Minimal scallion flavor. \\n---Black pepper shrimp:  A wet black pepper sauce was the most flavorful dish we had, medium sized shrimp were head-on in shell which was a nice authentic touch and keeps them from being overcooked.\\n---Chicken and Waffles: Aggressively expensive ($21) for half a chicken, 2 smallish waffles, with a one-note (just sticky sweet) vietnamese dipping sauce.   \\n---Tea Smoked Spareribs: Tender and appropriately greasy/moist.   Tea smoke was not very evident. Tasty enough but no need to wet your pants over them. \\n--Panko Crusted Lemon chicken: Fried, slightly dry chicken breast, with muted lemon flavor overall.  \\n--Genmai Fried Rice: Greasy and completely forgettable.\\n--Spicy brussel sprouts: Good sprouts, but to call them spicy is an overstatement.   \\n--With Flour Bakery producing the desserts, they were consistent and delivered clean well-balanced flavors. \\n\\nLike others have mentioned, overall there seems to be a lack of bang in flavor with a bit of a heavy hand on the oil.  Nothing was so bad as to need sending back, but nothing so good as to really want to come back for--especially at the prices they are charging for smallish plates.

The same platter offers less food and can only feed 1 person...and it costs $13.50. I can overlook that, but the service we received was inattentive at best. It took the wait staff nearly 30 minutes to bring our drink orders and nearly 45 minutes to bring our food. \\n\\nI think the only thing that Desta has going for it is that it caters a little more to the Western crowd with its decor and service staff.

My friend had their lavender latte and if you're looking for a more subtle taste, that is definitely the way to go.\\n\\nNow I've been told that going to Cafe Medina and not ordering their famous waffles is like going to Paris and not going to the Eiffel tower. You can order individual waffles for $3.15 each, plus an additional $1 per topping.  Some of their toppings include: dark chocolate, milk chocolate lavender, white chocolate pistachio rosewater, fig orange marmalade, raspberry caramel and mixed berry compote. We ordered three waffles and three toppings to share. The waffles are pretty small, but oh so tasty! my favorite topping was the milk chocolate lavender. Very different and fresh.\\n\\nMy breakfast consisted of the L'Omlette du Matin ($12) which comes on a skillet with foccacia bread. It was by far one of the best breakfasts I've had in the city. Hearty and delicious with a wide sort of toppings. My friend chose the Fricasse ($16) 2 eggs, braised short ribs, roasted potatoes, onions arugula and cheddar. I had to try some of hers!  It was out of this world. The short ribs were melt-in-your-mouth delicious.\\n\\nI would definitely come back here again. Awesome experience.

In Bijou's case, we're talking about ketchup. \\n\\nThat's right, ketchup. The condiment closely associated with hamburgers and french fries. It's homemade, organic, and served in a little glass jar with a spoon for scooping. Thick, luscious, and slightly sweet, the ketchup proved to be the perfect accompaniment to my crispy fried potatoes. If they sold it on the premises, I'd probably buy a case of the stuff. I suppose I should talk about the actual food, though...\\n\\nWe arrived at 11 AM on a Friday, so thankfully, there was no wait to contend with as you'd expect on a busy weekend.

I opted for a Bloody Mary, as I'm on a quest to find the best in town, and theirs was pretty good, though not quite worthy of the top spot. The pickled green bean and salted rim were nice touches. \\n\\nI'm a sucker for hash (not that kind!), so I chose the Olympic Provisions chorizo with roasted red peppers and two eggs over easy. The potatoes were cut into larger and thicker pieces than you usually find in a hash, but I wasn't complaining (see above: ketchup). I was a little disappointed in the chorizo, as it lacked seasoning; I hate when chefs are afraid of a little salt and pepper. This was easily remedied, though. The eggs were cooked perfectly - cutting into the yolk yielded a nice, creamy, golden stream of deliciousness that accented the other ingredients. Good stuff! \\n\\nMy wife ordered the Mushroom and Bravo Cheddar French omelette (fluffy; made with egg whites only) that was light, airy, and delicious. For some reason she went with the green salad on the side, rather than potatoes, which meant fewer ketchup opportunities. She also chose a muffin, and ended up with a moist, tasty apple muffin that turned out to be the perfect size. \\n\\nService was friendly and efficient. \\n\\nThis is a great breakfast/brunch spot committed to serving locally produced and grown foods, in a convenient spot close to the waterfront.
