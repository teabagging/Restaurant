Cocktails are inconsistent, although the hot drinks are amazing.  Espresso drinks are GOOD - however, why would someone serve a large mocha in a glass with no handle? Every time I go there I have to use a napkin to pick up my drink.  The service however has become more and more spotty over the years, some completely ignoring you and some super friendly.  I no longer bother on the weekends as the waits are hours long and often the service is reflected.  They allow dogs in the outdoor area, which is a nice idea if you have a mellow dog, however a large percentage of the dogs in there should NOT be allowed - approaching other tables, barking, etc.?  Don't bring your dogs if they can't behave.  It's not cute. Love being by the fireplace on a rainy day or enjoying the movie night with a blanket - good stuff.

I was glad to find that the Lake Mary location is only a 5-10 min drive from my new pad.  I lived in Chicago for 4 years and developed a deep love and appreciation for the Windy City, so I've always liked the homage that Friendly Confines pays with the name and d√©cor (go Bears!).  Plus it excites me when I see an Italian Beef on a restaurant's menu here in FL (if you don't know what an Italian Beef is, shame on you...go Google it immediately!).  Even though nothing could ever be as good as an Italian Beef from Portillo's, it's still nice to taste that delicious flavor profile.\\n\\nThe Lake Mary Friendly Confines is pleasantly bright and clean...a positive contrast from the Waterford location, which can feel dark and dingy.  There are also fewer loud and drunk college kids at this one - definitely a bonus!  Each time I've been, a \\"seat yourself\\" sign was placed in the front.  I don't mind seating myself, but sometimes in those situations it can take longer for a server to come and find you.  That wasn't the case here....service is pretty fast.  All of the tables and chairs are high tops, and there is nice patio out back.  Tons of TV's...would be a great place to hang and watch football. \\n\\nOne of the things I like most about F.C. are all the drink specials.  My fav at this location (I believe they differ slightly at each F.C.) are the $5 double Captain Morgan or Vodka drinks (3 Olives, I think).  The menu at this location is also slightly different, but still has all the basics.  Hubby was obsessed with the Philly Cheese steak from the Waterford location, so he was glad that the one here is just as good...crusty bread, tender meat and lots of cheese.  The wings are good...I always go with medium, parmesan, garlic sauce - yum!  Here they offer Mac & Cheese as a side which is nice.  I've also tried the Chicken Florentine wrap, it was also good.  You may notice I'm using the word \\"good\\" a lot, but I feel that appropriately describes the menu here...nothing fabulous, but it's all pretty good.\\n\\nOverall I enjoy this Friendly Confines.

There were 3 of us and we all got different dishes. We all got an oyster, even though I'm not a huge fan, I wanted to try one. They had lots of condiments to accompany them, which I loved. I put some fresh horseradish and the milder of the three hot sauces they gave us.\\nFor my main course I had the beef brisket, which I thought was delicious. The beef was so tender and the coleslaw that accompanied it was a nice change to the norm, as it came in a lemony dressing instead of mayonnaise. It was very refreshing and not as heavy on your stomach with  the beef and sweet potato mash that came with my dish. It made me more inclined to think It was homemade. \\nMy friend had the fried chicken which she enjoyed enormously. I have been back a second time, with my parents when they were here visiting, as I wanted take them somewhere where we were going to have a good meal, we weren't let down the second time either. The staff are very comfortable and friendly with the customers, which gives the place a laid back atmosphere, even though it feels more middle class dining.

I'm surprised by all these 5 star reviews. \\n\\nI WANTED so much to like this place, a friend of mine has been a couple times already and raved about it, so I joined her there for dinner last night. I cannot fairly and honestly give this place more than 3 stars right now. \\n\\nAtmosphere: Its cute. Small and cozy restaurant, more casual and cafe like than its not so distant relative over in Winter Park. Overhead the story on that told by the server to another table, it's the owner's former business partner, they split up and he opened Zeytin. \\n\\nThat being said, the menu is almost identical to its bigger and more organized brother. The layout is similar, the items are the same and the prices are almost the same, with the items at Zeytin being just a couple dollars lower. Although in my opinion, a little too high for its location, atmosphere and portion size. \\n\\nService: our server who I believe is the owners girlfriend, also based on conversation I overheard at another table was very nice and friendly.  She made some great recommendations, humored us with our attempt to read our coffee grounds, but was also not the most attentive as my water sat near empty for most of my meal. \\n\\nFood. The food was very good. It was by far the highlight of the meal, as it should be. I ordered the moussaka based on her recommendation and it was great. The rice pilaf it came with was just ok. It's a side of rice, I mean ehhh. My meal was priced at $16.95. Which is not expensive but for portion size of dish and a scoop of plain rice pilaf seems a bit high. We had planned on ordering dessert as my friend had raved about the coffee and baklava. \\n\\nSo here is where they lose their stars. Also overheard at another table (it's small! I wasn't trying to eavesdrop!!!) the group was asking about desserts, the server explained the few options to the table and they decided to order baklava. She went and placed the order then came back to their table to tell them that it was in the oven and it would be another 30 minutes before it was ready. They decided against dessert and made some comments about how they don't have any desserts ready at post-dinner time. I silently agreed. Well, my friend and I finished our meal a little after them, and she ordered a baklava for us to share. The server explained to us that it was in the oven and would be close to 45 minutes until it was done. It was like 8:30pm. She explained a different dessert to us, the cunife, sold us on that and said it'd be ready in about 5 minutes or so. \\n\\nShe brought us our piping hot Turkish coffees which we slowly sipped waiting on our dessert. And waiting. And waiting. We both finished our coffees before it ever came out. I kept trying to get her attention but she was nowhere to be seen. The dessert eventually arrived with an apology for it taking so long and an explanation that the Chef wanted to make us a fresh one. It was very good, but probably not worth the $9.95 and 15 minutes it took. \\n\\nSo... all in all. I really liked the food. I would like to see them succeed, but there are some very serious restaurant logistic fails that really shouldn't happen when trying to build a business and clientele. Not having any desserts ready around 8-9pm for your few tables that were full is sort of inexcusable to me. Waters need to be checked and refilled before noticing at dessert time. And prices probably need to be rethought given the location. \\n\\nI will probably give it another chance in a month or so to give them time to work out the kinks."},{"name":"Random Order Pie Bar","address":"1800 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Top hats, your grandmother and booze all at the same time.  \\nNo easy feat.  \\nMy husband declared it to be the best mocha he had ever had.\\nThe Pie.

There are good bargains and good variety everywhere you look. So I think the fact that Gandhi's - a simple cafeteria-style operation of approximately 4 feet by 2 feet - has 15+ person lines at any given time, well, it speaks for itself.\\n\\nGandhi's shares a storefront with two or three other specialty ethnic outfits, but it's impossible to miss its neighbors since the snaking line of people is there for one reason: delicious and affordable Indian cuisine. At any given time, Gandhi's has approximately 3 chicken dishes, 2 alternate meat/seafood offerings, and 5 or 6 vegetables, along with plain rice, small bits of naan, and traditional Indian \\"condiments\\" (think raita). You then order your meal - dine in or take out - based on how many and what kinds of meats or vegetables you want over your rice. The servings are hearty, to say the least. My go-to order is the Combination Plate, which comes with two kinds of chicken (which most people order by saying how spicy they want their meat between spicy, medium, and mild) and two vegetables, all for $7.25. Between the rice and heaping spoonfuls of each chicken and vegetable, my to-go box is heavy and I'm stuffed full for hours. My only minor complaint is that the naan is measly and not terribly interesting. They give each order a small wedge, with extra coming at a minor charge. I've had better - but there's so much other good food in my to-go box, the truth is I really don't need bread to complete the meal.\\n\\nI'm not sure I would've ever stopped in at Gandhi's had coworkers not recommended it.

We got sriracha, honey bourbon, and jerk; the sriracha tasted like delicious, fiery hate, the jerk was a little dry but flavorful enough that we didn't care, and the honey bourbon was perfect for a mild, sweet palate cleanser. We also had a lot of whiskey and beer, split the fifteen wings between ourselves, and averaged $25 a person. Not fucking bad. \\n\\nI love me a dive bar, but a dive bar with good liquor prices, an awesome patio situation, and wings that will make my mouth numb makes this place a landmark visit.

Sure it says \\"Resort\\" but what exactly does that mean?  Because I didn't see any clear differentiators of this propertly from other \\"resorts\\" I've stayed in.\\n\\nSure the bathrooms were huge, stayed in a 2 double bed room w/ 2 vanity sinks in the bathroom, but everything else was pretty standard.  Clean room, clean sheets, nothing special.  I was asked if I wanted to upgrade to a room that had an actual view, but I decided not to.  So my room's window was facing the inside lobby/atrium of the hotel.  No biggie.  And being that I was on the 4th floor, I was still close enough to the lobby area where they offer free wi-fi.  Of course in the room, whether you were on wifi (connected to the room) or wired, you had to pay.\\n\\nI did find it particularly disturbing that even with the free wifi in the lobby (or on the balcony of my room), I was not able to connect using my iPad or iPod.  This is more likely tied to how the iPad/iPod translated the hotel web page, not allowing you to click the \\"I agree\\" button that you need to...and if so, a device problem not the hotel....but it still was annoying.\\n\\nRoom service and the general service at the restaurant, bar, gift shop and Starbucks were all pretty friendly, what I would expect from any hotel.  But Front Desk was a bit sketchy.  We called downstairs to ask if there were any special rates to the Amusement Parks since we were there as part of a large/major convention and they said no.  Come to find out the following day, there was a special deal for convention attendees, which would have saved me half the cost of my ticket.  Sigh.\\n\\nThe food was either hit or miss, particularly along the lines of it was either really good, or really salty.  And try to Orlando, the water was just too disgusting on it's own, it was great that the gift shop stayed open later than Starbucks so I could go buy some bottled water.  During the day, you can also find some water available in the lobby, just right by the check-in area.  This is more during the earlier part of the day.  The bell guys outside may also offer you some complimentary bottles of water as well while you wait outside for a cab or car.

We sat there another 20 minutes no server every showed up so I asked an employee that was in the area cleaning the tables if he can send a manager over, We waited another 15 minutes no manager so I asked the same employee what was going on with the manager he said (oh I called back but they didnt answer ill go find one for you) still no manager but I did see one walk right passed us we stopped hi to tell him the situation and we needed to be served and we had been there a while. He stated he will send over another server which he did but that server was just as bad he took our order and didnt come back I had to walk around to find him because our drinks never made it out nor did our waters he stated that he wanted to bring all the drinks out a one time but we had already been sitting there a whie as is. We did not see him any more until the food came out which mines was in correct I had chips instead of fries and the fries was in the platter with my burger I reminded him that I wanted chips he siad oh yeah and was about to take the entire plate but I told him he can leave it due to me being extremely hungry he said that he couldnt because they were going to ask for the fries back so i just took the burger and let him take the plate (we waited 35 minutes for the food to come at that point). Our drinks still never came nor did my chips I saw a manager pass with drinks in his hand and asked him to come back once he drops them off he never did. I asked two more times for a manager to come out no one ever did. We sat there for another 50 minutes waiting on our check and the manager neither one ever came so our group went to go enjoy the little time we had left which wasnt much time at all. We was only able to do one round of laser tag (15 minutes) and 45 minutes worth of bowling no arcade games at all and we was there from 9:45-2am.

So I was a little nervous to have to venture into uncharted territory and choose a restaurant we've never been to in a state we're not familiar with. I had pretty low expectations, I mean, Orlando, dining destination it is not. \\n\\nDRINKS - We arrive early for a drink at the bar. I like me a pint of Guinness now and then, so I ordered a Left Hand Milk Stout from Colorado I think - this was amazingly better than a Guinness. Not to mention, the guys sitting next to me saw us eying up their home made carmel corn and offered it to us - what a fun bar snack! These same guys were drinking some cocktail with bacon floating in it. I've had plenty of these crazy mixology drinks that look fun and taste terrible, so I wasn't buying it...that is until I ordered it. The The Ravenous Pig Old Fashioned (Bacon Infused Buffalo Trace Bourbon, Vanilla Maple Syrup, Bitters) was shockingly good, and strong enough that sipping one over the course of dinner got me sufficiently buzzed. \\n\\nWe had a seat at the bar in front of the open kitchen. This was perfect for me, I love to watch plating and kitchen chaos. \\n\\nAPPETIZERS - At our server's recommendation we ordered the Wild Mushroom Manicotti (best part of our meal, hands down) and the duck pot pie (really very good). We also had an order of the Gruyere biscuits which were kind of blah, a little too dense and you couldn't really taste the Gruyere. \\n\\nMAINS - I ordered the chorizo-crusted cod which was pretty good, but it was the white bean puree underneath that was the knockout. I could have eaten just a bowl of that for dinner. Hubby ordered the grilled lamb cassoulet, but wished he had ordered the veal chop once he saw it; still it was very good. \\n\\nDESSERT - The apples fritters rock. They were light and fluffy and delish, served pretty hot, crispy on the outside coated with a little sugar crust. There was a little sauce on the side that was not too-sweet and perfectly complimentary. The milkshake didn't do anything for me, but I drank the whole thing anyway. \\n\\nI loved that this place was reasonable, very casual (I wore jeans and heels) and had a very clean and organized kitchen. Clearly this is a tough reservation to get, I saw a guy storm out with a \\"do you know who I am\\" attitude because his table wasn't ready for 30 minutes.

I've eaten at just about every restaurant here more times than I can count so new places for lunch are always highly welcome, but sadly I won't be adding Patty Chen's to my lunch rotation.  I came here with a friend; we were both excited to try out this place since we both love dumplings and Asian food in general.  There was an open table when we arrived so we were quickly seated, the service was decent enough, no complaints.  \\n\\nAfter perusing the menu we ended up ordering the \\"soup dumplings\\" (which our waiter explained to us were not soup dumplings but \\"juicy\\" dumplings so I wasn't expecting soup dumplings) the Taipei pan fried dumplings, hot and sour soup and the Nutella dumplings.  I'm sad to say that everything was really underwhelming.  The juicy dumplings were neither soupy nor juicy, they were really dry and doughy.  The Taipei dumplings had a good flavor but were really doughy as well.  The Nutella dumplings weren't what we were expecting at all.  Instead of a big pan fried dumpling full of Nutella (like I was imagining and hoping for) they were thin and really flat, almost looking like tortilla chips.  The dough was dry and the filling seemed to taste more banana than Nutella which was a drag because I really only ordered them because I wanted the chocolate.  \\n\\nEven with all that we ordered and a spending a good $15+ each for lunch we were still hungry.  Overall I think the dumplings are pretty pricey and not tasty enough to warrant the price.

If I have it was not a McDonald's. \\n\\nI don't normally find good service at fast food places. Maybe passable or acceptable given the circumstance. But this one really is different from what Columbus area McDonald's have to offer. Depending on what neighborhood you are in, you can taste the quality of the area. Bad neighborhood, unfortunately, will equate to bad service and bad food. Not to say this area is perfect. The fast food place across Tuttle from here is one that required corporate intervention with a now former supervisor.\\n\\nBut back to what makes this McDonald's a standout from the rest. \\nI recently had lunch here, as I have been more often recently since I converted jobs and get an hour to sit around. This McDonald's wasn't my first choice as it is slow every visit. Or that was before. They have a lot more staff and they seem organized now. I ordered fish and fries as I usually do. Then, unlike some other locations, I picked a table and food was delivered to me. There is a very outgoing old gentleman working here who is kind of off putting, at first, due to his extroverted behavior. Compared to my introversion, it was outside of my comfort zone. He greets you and takes your order, even going though the kiosk with you to make sure you can order easier. I thought he was the owner. \\n\\nMy food makes it to my table and I always start with the fries. Always. When I got to the fish, it was immediately visible that it was not right. The fish was overdone or overdone and very old looking. Dried out and overly fishy tasting. So I had to complain- gently. It is hard to be made with low expectations. It's fast food. Not fine dining. I went to the older gentleman and let him know the fish wasn't right- or fresh tasting. Hours old maybe. He got the manager. A gorgeous young woman with tat's on her arms. She listens to my complaint and I show her the sandwich as well. They both apologize and offer a refund and a new sandwich. I was just happy getting a fresh one. \\n\\nIt was very professional how it was handled and I can't say the McDonald's in my neighborhood would have been so great. It usually requires a corporate escalation to the franchisee to fix issues there. \\n\\nI wanted to make sure it was known how great the people have been every trip to the Tuttle Xing McDonald's across from the mall.

We got there and after we order everything started going down the hill. First the appetizer Chicken croquettes, he brought them without the sauce that is part of it according to the menu. I had to asked him for the sauce and he never brought the sauce and the restaurant was not busy just 4 tables with customers and there was 2 waiters. After the main dish came my order should had beans and Farofa well he didn't bring the beans until I had to ask the other waiter for the beans and water which Lucas forgot to ask if we need water or something else oh and the Farofa don't ask me because I never knew what it looks like or taste like he also \\"forgot\\" to included in the meal. By this time I was really upset finish half of what I ordered, and to end my \\"wonderful\\" night he brought me the check with 3 desserts that I never ordered, I waited until he decided to look at my table and he said it was a mistake that was the order of other table, I didn't know they ordered exactly the same as we ordered plus 3 desserts.( yeah right) so no I didn't leave any TIP. But I let him know why because the tip is to get a good service not to be ignored the whole time and bring the food without half of what it suppose to be served with. I have never been treated like that in any place and I'm the person who always leave more than the 15% of the Tip. But this was an insult. And to finish this he saw the bill and yelled \\"pillo\\" in English is Thief and follow me outside and started do like reverence movement saying thank you.

It is odd that such a quality can equate to $7.00 or a large sausage pizza with mozzarella cheese is valued at $8.00.  \\n\\nThe place also focuses on d√©cor.  There is a greenhouse covered with vines.  There is a wing where you can see the street  Then the bar sits in the middle.  The staff are always helpful.  The list of alcohol is more of a long chant of wines.  These wines are rather nice.  There is a list of alcohol that isn't wine.  I had the hard cider.  The hard cider isn't as sweet.  If one wants to have the alcohol in a medium sweet cider, then the drink that I have just described will do the trick.  I was quite surprised by the pizza. I want to say that.

Our experience wasn't terrible, but it also wasn't worth the money and I was disappointed that his birthday dinner was so disappointing.\\n\\nI had called to make a reservation in advance, although it wasn't terribly busy when we arrived. When we walked in it took a minute for someone to come to seat us. That was fine, we weren't in a rush- the part that threw me off was his attitude. He was very disengaged and seemed annoyed we disturbed him from whatever it was he was doing prior to us walking in. \\n\\nThis is a little tangental but I need to say it- I absolutely HATE this attitude. I worked in restaurants for 10 years and I understand being busy or having a bad day. But please, you're not even our server, you don't need to spend more than five minutes with us (at most)- why are you so annoyed? Fake it for a few minutes then go back to being a grump. End rant.\\n\\nThe building itself is pretty cool. The decor is intentionally kitschy, and it works. The outside patio has heated lamps and a fire pit, as well as a bar which is always a plus. We sat outside and although it was overcast and windy we stayed pretty warm.\\n\\nOur server was nice enough. The service wasn't great but she may have had indoor tables we weren't seeing, so I won't fault her. The food, however, was less than mediocre. We ordered the camarones rellenos for an appetizer. They weren't awful, but to be honest there's a sports bar in Austin (Scoreboard) that sells a similar plate that's much tastier and less expensive. I ordered fish for entree and my boyfriend ordered steak. My dish was OK, his was bland and chewy. He will eat almost anything- he eats my cooking so I can say with confidence that he is not a picky eater- but he could barely eat more than a couple of bites of his meal. The worst part is it cost close to $30 for his entree alone. \\n\\nWe also ordered drinks. They came out late and tasted like soapy dishes and old juice. We didn't drink them. I've never sent back a drink; I think it's the guests' fault if they order something they're not sure they'll like and then don't because of their taste buds. But I honestly don't think it was the drink's fault this time. I think it was the dishes or the bartender's- not to mention the drinks cost ~$10 each and I was already upset with the meal.\\n\\nAfter we sent the drinks back the server disappeared. When she did come back she was rude. I understand- she probably assumed she wouldn't get a tip because we sent the drinks back and didn't eat the food, but it would have been nice if she had compensated for that by being friendly. Or by having recognized it was my boyfriend's birthday when she checked his ID.. It's the little things that leave impressions, you know?\\n\\nOverall this place is overpriced for mediocrity. The live music and stuff might be cool in the summer, but don't spend $30-$40 on the food, there are so many other places in Austin that are much better uses of your hard earned money."},{"name":"Top Shanghai Cuisine Restaurant","address":"120-8100 Ackroyd Road","city":"Richmond","stars":"3.5","text":"Go here for the dumplings and dim sum.

I had the fried chicken, collard greens, macaroni and cheese, and yams.  The chicken has been consistently good; the sides were not.  Their macaroni was too grainy for me and you can almost tell that by looking at the photos posted here.  The chicken is delicious.  It's not greasy at all.  The sweet tea is VERY sweet to the point that it almost tastes like syrup instead of tea.  Ask for half sweet and half unsweet.\\n\\nDine in-There is a 30+ minute wait.  The first time I dined it was just me so I was able to grab a seat at the counter after waiting for about 15 minutes.  The service is o.k.  When I dined in the server was rather rude until I mentioned to her that she was coming across rude.  At that point she told me she was very tired and had been working all day.  She also began to treat me nicer after I brought it to her attention. For those that don't sit at the counter, don't come starving.  The restaurant is very small and people are in no hurry to eat their food and leave.\\n\\nCarry out-no one ever answered the phone.  So again arrive with patience.  Once I got to the restaurant there was a wait to simply place a to-go order.   You cannot place your order online so be prepared to keep trying to call until you get someone or just drive there and wait.  They charge a fee for carry out which I think is ridiculous!\\n\\nParking is a nightmare so arrive with patience for that knowing that you may have to circle around to find a spot unless you want to park across the street at Wal-Mart.\\n\\nI would have given them 3 stars but the customer service is lacking.  Also I sent an e-mail which never received a response. So that demonstrates why the service in the restaurant is lacking.\\n\\nUpdate-I changed this rating from 3 stars to 2 for failure to respond to my e-mail and Facebook message.  I will not return.

I wasn't in the mood for a margarita, so had a glass of wine. But they looked good on other tables.\\n\\nWe were seated quickly, the server happy to tell us what she thought of the house specials.

The chips tasted  fresh which is always a plus. \\n\\nThey offer unique options in a chain such as mole, and cactus. I asked the server about a few entrees on the House Specialties and she said the ribs were a great choice. So I got the chipolte plum baby back ribs, which came with \\"Mexican style\\" cream corn and french fries. BF got the carne asada burrito.\\n\\nBig portion of food for both. My ribs were OK. Just that. The loving description of baby back ribs in a smokey sweet glaze was barely warm, and had not been on a grill for very long since they parboiled it 6 hours ago. The glaze was just OK- not too smokey, not too sweet. Did not season the meat or add to it. Very disappointing. Ribs were tender, but frankly, Chile's does a better job of grilling and I don't like Chile's ribs. The corn though was good. Spicy with a cream sauce that was unique. French fries were good but I don't look for that in a Mexican restaurant.  BF liked his burrito, but said it was just OK. Not great but he finished it all. Server asked if I enjoyed the ribs and I said I thought they would have actually been grilled and she seemed surprised.

I went back for dinner on another day and had the vegan nachos. They tasted good, but were a bit cumbersome. There was a ridiculous amount of chips piled into the basket and not a lot of soy curls.

Or at least offered to take my card for me so I wouldn't have to get up and go order it separately.\\n\\nThe sushi itself was decent, though the corazon was fairly unremarkable and not worth the upcharge.\\n\\nI would recommend Zen, right up the street, for sushi of similar quality and lower price.\\n\\nAnd to Banzai Sushi & Grill, I think you would do well to be more customer-centric in your approach to providing service. If you want to upcharge me for mayo while I'm ordering then fine. But sometimes maybe it's worth questioning your behavior when someone is already beginning their experience, which you want them to continue enjoying.\\n\\nI don't blame you form a financial standpoint, but I don't think the $3.49 difference was worth creating a detractor over. We only paid an additional $0.50 and decided to waive the bubble tea at this point, so essentially we've traded 4-stars for a 2-quarter sample-cup sized portion of spicy mayonnaise.\\n\\nNice work."},{"name":"Piece of Cake","address":"3215 Roswell Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Picked up a piece of the Caramel cake at the airport location.

From my experiences, the food quality depends completely on the evening.

I had a good experience with their antipasto salad a few months ago, but when I ordered it again recently, it was half the usual size and missing a few of the normal ingredients.

If so, this place has your answer. \\n\\nI went here with an entourage of really cool people that are fun to talk and hang out with. \\n\\nA sophisticated looking but nice lady in the entourage suggested that we get this drink called an \\"Irish Car Bomb\\", so she, a cool and funny Vietnamese guy, a funny 4th year medical student, and I decided to get this drink. \\n\\nThis drink consists of half a glass pint (236 mL) of Guinness Irish beer, along with Irish Cream and Irish Whiskey in a shot glass (44 mL). You drop the shot glass into the pint, causing a splash. You must drink from the pint glass less than 2 seconds after you drop the shot glass otherwise the drink will NOT taste good. It's called an \\"Irish Car Bomb\\" mainly because of the Irish origin of the ingredients, the splash from dropping the shot glass, making it look like an explosion and it also references the violent history of Northern Ireland during the second half of the 20th Century. The name though, sounds kind of offensive to the Irish people, and I wonder if bartenders can come up with a better name, maybe the \\"Irish Drop Shot and Splash\\" as a suggestion?\\n\\nThe sophisticated lady said something about the \\"Irish Car Bomb\\" before we ordered the drink, \\n\\n\\"It's like drinking a chocolate milkshake!\\" \\n\\nI have to agree with that statement, and it's a fun drink to have with a group of 4 or more friends but my body and mind felt really weird after drinking the \\"Irish Car Bomb\\". Also it's $10 for a drink which is kind of high, but I think it's worth getting one if you are with some great friends who are fun to talk and hang out with. \\n\\nAnother great advantage this place has is that they serve Franziskaner Weissbier as part of their beer selection from the tap. Franziskaner beer is probably one of my favorite beers, mainly because it is not too bitter and it is really refreshing when it is served cold. They give you more than just a pint, they give you more than half a liter in a large glass!\\n\\nAs for food, I was not really impressed, mainly due to the value you are getting. I got a Grilled Cheese Duck Confit which is this simple sandwich made from toasted marble bread, minced duck meat, melted cheese and it comes with a salad. I actually liked eating the sandwich, especially the crisp toast, the melted cheese and the flavor of the duck. The salad was pretty good and fairly fresh but it was not amazing. At $10, the price is kind of high unless you really want to eat something here. \\n\\nService was actually really good, the bartenders were fairly kind and easy to talk to. We did not want to sit at the tables since not many of us wanted to order food and you have to order some food if you want to get a table and have drinks.\\n\\nOverall, this is not a bad place to get some good drinks, especially if you are in Brookline with a group of friends, but the food selection has not impressed me so far. If you already had a good meal with your friends earlier in the evening, and want to get some drinks with some of your friends to finish the evening, then this is actually a really good choice.

And then grape soju and yogurt soju. Both tasted delicious but I should note that they make the yogurt soju and they barely put any soju in it. It should be assumed that they skimp on the soju but when I tasted it, it was confirmed that it tasted too delicious to taste like any soju was in it. Would still order it again doe.\\n\\nAs for service, you won't be getting much! It seems the employees purposefully avert their eyes and are hard of hearing because even if you yell after them they disappear into the abyss only for you to flag down the next victim, I mean employee, who happened to accidentally make eye contact with you. Another thing that was annoying was that they kept playing the same songs over and over and over again. Why, just why. If I was an employee there I would run away. And apparently they give students 50% off if you come before a certain time, which we did but they still wouldn't give it to us because we didn't sign in before hand or some dumb excuse like that.

My boyfriends pork tenderloin was cooked nicely but lacking in flavour, and my seafood linguine was alright.

We were all starving so we ate it anyways. The food I ordered had cilantro on it, despite the menu not saying so (I am one of those people that hates cilantro and it ruins all food it touches for me)\\n-Two people at our table ordered the breakfast bowl which said it would come with salsa verde. It did not, and we had to ask for it. Our waiter seemed confused about this\\n-The breakfast bowl did not fill either person up and was not enough food, yet cost $15. What gives? \\n-The waiter gave us one check, but we needed it split. I wish folks in food service would just ask, \\"Will this be one check or split?\\"--even if they don't split checks, they could at least say something--its very difficult as the Customer to split up a check manually and hope the waiter splits it correctly. \\n-Valet upon entry but no warning sign--people in our party had to pull around and park on the street. What gives with valet? People generally don't mind parking themselves, and its a huge property with good parking if you would let Customers just park themselves.\\n\\nOverall, I am underwhelmed and unimpressed.

The wait time was a bit on the long side though, I will definitely agree with that.   It wasn't super-long, but definitely noticeable.   Especially since we were literally the only customers in there at first.\\n\\nAs for the food, I thought it was pretty delicious.  You can get 1/3 pound, 2/3 pound, or a full pound...and opt for beef, turkey, veggie, chicken, etc. as your protein.   I got the Southwest veggie burger, which had roasted red peppers and a black bean/corn salsa.  It really was awesome.   My wife got the classic hamburger which I tasted and was pleased with as well.   My review's based on the veggie burger though, and I'll definitely come back specifically for that.  It's why I'm giving it a 4-star rating.  A lot of places have the veggie or bean burger as a sideshow, but it seemed like Metro Burger really put some thought and care into it.

We ordered the chicken Alfredo, salad, bread and spaghetti with meatballs. First off, the Alfredo had absolutely no taste. It had to be the WORST Alfredo I've ever had in my life. The salad was ok. Not too bad. A salad is salad. The bread would've been great but they ran out of butter (yeah I know, really?) so I asked if they had any dipping sauces for bread like an oil - poor guy brought us back vegetable oil. He was cute though so I let it slide. You could try he was trying hard. The spaghetti and meat balls was ok. Could've been better though.

Minus one star at this location for not enough seating.  I was visiting my friend in Framingham and found myself here passing some time while waiting for her to get home from work.  I was occupying one of the two cushy chairs by the door and there were four more small tables, each one occupied with someone working on a laptop.  I sat reading and felt semi-pressured by the suit-and-tie clad customers coming in to give up my seat so they could set up shop.  No one said anything to me, but the impatient looks and the lingering and hovering that occurred was somewhat annoying.  Now, their sense of entitlement is not Starbucks' fault, of course, but if there were more seating, which there seemed to be plenty of room for, this unpleasantry could have easily been avoided.

Ordered the \\"Oh Boy!\\" Po' Boy.  Was beautiful to look at, impossible to eat.  It was a large soft, white roll overflowing with fried, small shrimp, lettuce, tomato, avocado, dressed with a tart, dill tartar sauce.  The shrimp were also kind of excessively breaded, but they were piping hot and crunchy.  The Blackened Mahi Fish Sandwich was a fave of the table and devoured entirely.  They're not big fans of the fish tacos.  The other sandwiches were reasonably sized.  The Finnhenry's Buffalo Chicken sandwich was deemed fine, not all that spicy.  The Tuscan Chicken Panini was tasty, but not pressed and not grilled or very hot, it was accurately served on ciabatta.

However, given the upscale nature of this spot, service needs some fine tuning and that knocked off one star.\\n\\nFirst off, it's a beautiful restaurant - its interior is cozy and intimate, and takes you back to a different time. Similarly, the outside makes you forget you're not far from downtown - lovely porch/patio with peacocks and romantic lighting. \\n\\nThe food was very good: biscuits were truly excellent, the trout was delicious and the cauliflower was very, very tasty. Drinks were also excellent. The kale salad could probably use a little less dressing, as it was borderline soggy. Also, the local market vegetable plate was nearly inedible, very bitter and overly charred. More on that later. \\n\\nNow the service - we arrived on-time for our reservation, only to be told many groups showed up at once and they wanted to stagger the parties a bit. That was fine, we went to the bar to have a drink. We still weren't seated 15 minutes later. After politely inquiring about how much longer it would be, as we had plans immediately after dinner, we were seated. There were a decent number of empty tables while we walked to our table. Having worked in the restaurant industry, I wasn't too bothered...it was just less than ideal, especially since we had a reservation. *Still, that wouldn't be enough to rate this place 4 stars instead of 5*\\n\\nWhat made the experience less than favorable was our server who was consistently rushed,  frazzled and visibly stressed. There wasn't much personal interaction - he was just there to move things along as quickly as possible. I internally debated whether it was worth asking questions about the menu! Again, we understood they were busy, but the hastiness of his service made us feel rushed and took away from our experience. This continued through the end of the meal, even when they were significantly less busy. Our vegetable plate was untouched because it was too bitter to eat - and it visibly looked untouched - and there was no question about it except whether we were finished eating. Again, given the more upscale feel of the place, I'd expect more personable service.\\n\\nOverall, it's a beautiful and intimate spot worth visiting.

That's it.  That's the reason.\\n\\nYes, they cater a lot more to the sushi-fans, that's why it's called Sushi Katana. But what little they have that's non-sushi, it's tasty (noodles, beef katana).\\n\\nNo, there's no katanas inside.\\n\\nYes, it is a small place, but I have never seen it completely full, even if it is located at the Millenia Mall plaza. So it is a good choice to dine away from the crowds wandering around the restaurants directly connected to the Mall.\\n\\nYes, there can only be 1 or 2 servers.  So if it there are more than 4 tables, you will experience a slight delay, but they are helpful, accommodating hosts.\\n\\nYes, one person most likely will get the wooden chair and not the comfy couch, 'cause that's the way it is set-up for the majority of tables.  I have never been seated at the two areas that are set for large parties, so when I brought a total of 5 people (all family), I thought I was finally going to sit more comfortably (I'm a gentleman, so my lady gets the soft couch and I get the stiff chair) but alas, they just pulled two regular tables together.  It is not meant for me.  Regardless, I exaggerate, and you will most likely be fine even if you get the chair.\\n\\nSo, in conclusion, this is a little, cool place, with tasty Japanese food.  I cannot comment on the sushi because I have not tried it (I can eat sushi, but I'd rather have the other staples of Japanese cuisine), but if their non-specialty is good, then their sushi must be equally good or greater!"},{"name":"Rice Box","address":"931 Monroe Dr, Ste A108","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2.5","text":"while shopping at Richard's Variety I thought I would grab a quick lunch and Rice Box looked cute.

My husband and I took this as a nice opportunity to dress up a bit. We are by NO means \\"fancy\\" people, but coming to a restaurant like this, and paying what we were going to be paying, we wanted to feel like part of the \\"fancy\\" crowd. When we got to our table, we noticed pretty much everyone at the large party next to us was wearing ball caps at the table, swimsuit cover ups, and looked like they had just come from one of the water parks. Now, I know Disney isn't too strict on their dress codes, and I understand that people in large parties may have no time to go back to the hotel and change, but it seemed every table was like this. Maybe it was our faults for dressing up a bit, and we felt a little foolish. Not a good way to start the meal.\\n\\nOur waitress took a while to even come to us to get our drink orders. I was shocked by that. When she finally came over, I ordered some hot decaf tea from their selection of herbal teas. My husband ordered a coke. When my tea came out, I found it was quickly and poorly pressed and had waaaay too many loose leafs floating about. I couldn't even sip it without spitting out a few tea leaves. But, hey, it's loose-leaf tea. That happens.\\n\\nThe food was nothing special, really. My husband ordered the filet minion, which came with a yukon gold potato puree, broccoflower, a sweet onion demi-glaze, and horseradish cream. Obviously, being a fine dining restaurant, the portion was very small with a big price tag. My husband said his filet was okay, nothing special. He did enjoy the yukon gold potato puree, but did not enjoy the broccoflower. He finished his dinner unsatisfied and still hungry. \\n\\nI ordered the wild-caught prawn pho, which included prawns, mussels, calamari, pork, broccolini, shiitake mushrooms, red curry, and pho broth. Again, the portion size was lacking. When I think of pho, I imagine a big delicious bowl of broth, noodles, and veggies with meat (maybe I'm just westernized, who knows) but what they brought me was some noodles with seafood, a few veggies, and maybe a cup of broth. Now, the broth was delicious. But the mussels tasted rotten. Kind of threw me off. The prawns were pretty good, but by the time you took out the mussel shells and the prawn heads, there wasn't much left. I left hungry and unsatisfied.\\n\\nWe didn't even bother with dessert. We just wanted to head home. \\n\\nWith all of the other amazing dining options Disney World has to offer, I would definitely put Artist Point on your \\"skip list.\\" The parks and resorts have so much to offer, and this isn't something to write home about.

It's a fairly large portion, but the beauty is that it can be packed as leftovers quite easily. \\n\\nOur final savoury dish was the Pork Potstickers.

We don't necessarily care about that at all, if the flavors are spot on. That wasn't our case with the 9 dishes we ordered. The best things were probably the peaches & mangoes and the sweet corn appetizer. We also ordered the brisket tacos, and honestly have had better tacos at Tacodeli. The churros were atrocious. Gummy on the inside, the chocolate sauce unappetizing, and no cinnamon whatsoever. But the worst dish was probably the carnitas tamale.

Parking is very limited. Fortunately, it is walking distance from public transportation, green line T stop and near a bus stop.\\n\\nThe interior is very modest. You are immediately greeted by the chef and waiters upon entering. There are only about 6 tables in the small restaurant. The restaurant is not ideal for groups larger than 6. It can probably accommodate 8 by pushing tables together but not comfortably. We waited 15 minutes on a Thursday night. My son was restless but I could see the chef peering over and smiling at him which made me feel very at ease. There was a family with three children seated at the right corner of the restaurant where we were seated next to. I was very pleased with the cozy, welcoming and casual atmosphere. \\n\\nThe chef was very accommodating with our request for a half size portion of the flounder sashimi versus the full size plate. I've never been to a sushi restaurant that served large portion of sashimi. I believe the most expensive plate cost $60. Our sashimi plate came with gojuchang, a Korean thick red sweet and peppery dipping sauce. It looks spicy but is more sweet. The flounder sashimi was fresh and I enjoyed it. My brother and husband said it didn't have much flavor and would order something different next time. I think it's a great dish to share if you come in a larger group. \\n\\nThe green tea was a bit disappointing and so was the hot milk green tea. The green tea didn't have much flavor, the hot green milk tea on the other hand was fragrant but the milk made it like warm white did not go well together. \\n\\nWe also ordered one order of ameabi sashimi to which the chef gave us one additional shrimp complementary since we were a party of four and the sashimi came in three pieces. They were fresh, but I do missed the fried tempura shrimp head that I am accustomed to getting at other sushi restaurants when I order this dish. \\n\\nI believe you have to ask for the monkfish liver dish since I couldn't find it on the menu. The monkfish liver has the texture of pate and is buttery. It comes dressed in scallions and ponzu sauce. \\n\\nThe hamachi kama (grilled yellowtail collar) was very standard but delicious none the less.\\n\\nThe Patriots Maki that a lot of Yelpers raved about truly lived up to its reputation. It was delicious. The torched scallop on top of the roll very fresh. I would definitely order this again. \\n\\nThis restaurant is truly a hidden gem.

Got a spot on the patio. Our server came by after a few min and took our first round of drink orders, but first, he grabbed my girlfriend's phone off the table and started playing with it as it has a Nintendo case. This was a sign as to how inappropriate the service would become. \\n\\nA few min later, he dropped off our drinks. My beer was 2 min after the others & my glass was warm to the touch.  I remarked to the table that I thought the beer wasn't cold before confirming that with a taste. It was room temp. I let him know; maybe that keg wasn't chilled yet? I ordered a different kind of draught beer.  Still warm. I told him the system was messed up and got a bottle, which was cold. \\n\\nTime passes, other patrons on either side of us get seated and order. Finally, he takes ours. We had the chicken & waffles, Pecan French toast, and the biscuits & gravy. \\n\\nMore time passes. My mom orders another mimosa. He was very attentive to up-selling booze, to his credit. He comes back 5 min later and drops a water glass half full of mimosa next to my 58 year old mother. We all sort of look at him, and he yells \\"it's all good! Changin' it up a bit!\\" He walks away. \\n\\nIt's now about 12:15, which means its been an hour and 15 min since we sat down, and 30+ min since we ordered food. The other tables, who sat after us, have their food. My mom gets hers first. We wait. 3 min later, my girlfriend gets hers. I get mine another couple of min later. The tables to the left and right have been brought salt& pepper grinders, ketchup, and rolled cutlery. We have none of these things. \\n\\n\\n\\nThe fried chicken & waffles was decent. They put some kind of chili powder in/on the waffles, which is a strange flavour and probably not the best compliment for the already spiced fried chicken. The French toast was good, but it's only 2 small-ish pieces, which isn't really enough. My biscuits& gravy were pretty bad. The biscuits hadn't been warmed, and because they were small, they formed two small, doughy rocks with a bit of cold gravy atop. The sausage was profoundly under-seared, which gave it a rubbery texture and a dubious food-safety rating. \\n\\nA full 2 hours later, we finally received our cheque. He asked (for the first time) how the food was. I replied that it was \\"just ok.\\" He said \\"yeah...it's kinda hard to take things off the bill, except for the warm beer\\" and left. I hunted him down and paid our nearly $100 bill. \\n\\nAs we left, we all remarked that we felt kind of sick. My girlfriend parted ways and my mom and I went back to my house where she laid on the couch, feeling awful. My girlfriend called me shortly after and told me she threw up. I felt sick and had strange sounds coming from my stomach but went to work. \\n\\nThe next day, my mom decided to call and speak to a manager about our awful experience. There \\"is no manager there. \\" (why?) she left a message. She informs them that she is avoiding posting a horrible review by instead calling them to work it out. The next day, she calls again during service. No answer. She calls back 6 times and leaves 2 messages before finally calling AGAIN and reaching Chewy 5 days later, who admits he got the message the day before. She tells him everything that I explained above. He gives the following excuses:\\n\\n\\"We got a new cooling system for the beer, and our staff don't  know how to use it. Plus the server would have to stick his finger in the beer to know it was warm.\\" Funny, because I have hands and eyes that can detect cold and hot. \\n\\nIn response to the water glass mimosa, the wait time, and the staggered arrival of the food: \\"yeah, they were really busy.\\"\\n\\nIn response to us getting sick: \\"yeah, that's bad.\\"\\n\\nHe offers no solution, so my mom suggests that he call me. He says he will, that day. It has been 3 days since then. \\n\\nI manage a restaurant in Vancouver. Let me tell you what I would have done, and HAVE done in this situation: \\n1. Trained my kitchen staff in FoodSafe practices as to not poison people\\n\\n2. Trained my serving staff to adjust their casual, brotastic serving style to something more professional when serving 2 women, one of whom is old enough to be their grandmother in all likelihood, and neither of whom are interested in being screamed at/talked over/having their space invaded and belongings played with/flirting with you. \\n\\n3. Shown the server/bartender/manager how to monitor & adjust the cooler temp. \\n\\n4. Advise guests BEFORE THEY ARE SEATED that there could be up to an hour wait for food, so they have the option of choosing another place\\n\\n5. Respond to phone calls from concerned guests immediately, so they don't end up posting really bad reviews. \\n\\nThis is the longest & worst review I've ever posted, because this was the worst (and quite possibly the longest) dining experience I have ever had in Vancouver, if not ever."},{"name":"Main Event - Atlanta","address":"3101 Cobb Pkwy SE, Ste 104","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2.5","text":"Worst experience ever!

We were hoping for the flavours to pop out more and have a nice balance between the sweet and the savoury.\\n\\nMargherita pizza - GOOD; the dough was chewy and the crust was the right amount of crispy. The pizza was even better when dipped with the chilli oil and topped with pepper flakes. Nook's chili oil is AMAZING! Only minor complaint is to add more mozzarella cheese on the pizza (some slices had none).\\n\\nCampanelle, guanciale, cauliflower and spinach (pasta of the day) - GOOD; this was delicious and full of flavour.

Since we arrived in the early afternoon, but not wanting anything heavy nor wanting to walk too far from where we were staying,  Earl's was the most convenient option. We arrived around 1pm for lunch, and were quickly seated at a table for 2 near their kitchen. I didn't catch our server's name, but he came promptly with water and was genuinely friendly - not just a server schtick.\\n\\nIndecisiveness is a new phenomenon/problem for me, so when I asked for a cocktail suggestion, he mentioned I should try the mango margarita off their test menu since it was a limited time offer. It sounded different, so I thought why not! My friend had some kind of black cherry cocktail which she thoroughly enjoyed. The margarita was rimmed with paprika sugar, which I didn't quite enjoy as I thought salt would have been a much better choice. The drink was smokey because the alcohol used was mescal; the margarita was not overly sweet but without the sweet/salty combo that a salted rim would have provided, the drink just didn't wow me.\\n\\nLunch was another predicament for my indecisiveness. I told our server I was open to a surprise, but that I wanted a light meal - nothing too filling or too large. To my surprise, he went to a meal with steak - not at all what I'd call a light meal, though he touted it at being so. Well, if it IS light, I sure don't want to spend $25 on a light meal. Thanks, but no thanks. I ended up on having their soup/salad combo for $14.50 - with their soup of the day being tortilla soup, served with their house green salad as well as a wedge of house made pan bread.\\n\\nThe food came in good time and was the perfect size - certainly lighter than a steak . Unlike most broth-based tortilla soups that I have had, this one was blended and so had a creamier texture. It was spicy and tangy and very satisfying. The salad was divine - lightly dressed, and garnished with crumbled cheese, nuts and perhaps a couple other goodies.\\n\\nAll in all, I enjoyed eating at Earl's. Their menu can pretty much appeal to anyone, and it's fun eating at their test kitchen where you have the opportunity to try something new. I definitely gave our server my honest opinion on the margarita, but that was the only item I tried from their test menu.\\n\\nI would definitely go back, I have no complaints at all."},{"name":"Dinesty Dumpling House","address":"1719 Robson Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Good food and the dining area was larger than normal for Vancouver.

Hats off to the Sangria, a drink easily screwed up. Theirs was simply perfect, refreshing and a hint of the greatness to come. Caesar salads were brought; cold, crisp and delicious. I ordered the Hanger Steak. It arrived cooked perfectly, accompanied by creamy garlic mashed along with leaf spinach in a butter garlic drizzle. The chicken dishes were equally superb.

Located in Disney's WIlderness Lodge, Artist Point provides a fair balance between rustic and class.  As with every other Disney experience, the service was top notch.  \\n\\nI started with the highly recommended smoke portobello soup.  It lived up to all expectations, and then some.  the smoky, roasted mushroom slivers that sat atop the soup were simply amazing.  I promised my girlfriend, who is vegetarian, that it was the closes she would come to tasting real bacon (without actually having said bacon).  It was wonderful.  My girlfriend started with the heirloom tomato salad, served with three separate types of tomatoes, aged balsamic and buffalo mozzarella  foam.  2/3 of the tomatoes were incredible and didn't have whatever flavor is in tomatoes that I normally don't care for.  A great choice.\\n\\nFor entree, I went with the king salmon.  I had read about the Copper River salmon, but was disappointed to learn it was out of season.  All the same, this was perfectly cooked.  My girlfriend had the sweet potato gnocchi, who reported it to be \\"majorly yum.\\"  When presented, the dish looked to be a little on the small side, but was filling and turned out to be more than enough.  Be sure to locate the micro basil on the dish.  A powerful punch of flavor in a tiny package.  Both dishes come recommended.  \\n\\nWe finished with the berry cobbler.  Upon presentation, it looked simply like a mixed berry cup with whipped cream.  Beneath the berries,  however, lived a wonderfully crisp and sweet crust that housed the warm berry cobble underneath.  A delicious mix of raspberries, blueberries, and blackberries was a fine end to a fine meal.  \\n\\nAnd finally, our lovably quirky server Donald.   I appreciate when restaurant servers are smart, knowledgable, and passionate about the food they are presenting.  Donald was no different and added to the great experience."},{"name":"Santorini Cafe","address":"11800 N Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I absolutely love this place.

It was loud and chaotic. \\n\\nThe line to the check in counter was fairly quick however what we were about to encounter had me in tears.  The \\"ROBOT\\", I mean woman working the front desk, after disappearing for a period of time, informed us that we were late and was scheduled to check in the night before. In 'their\\" eyes we were considered a \\"NO SHOW\\" therefore gave our room reservations away.  In less than 12 hours our room was gone.  I booked the reservations in April.  Never in my life have I ever \\"blown off\\" a reservation.  Mind you, we were not there for a vacation, it was a professional three day conference with all of the sessions being held at that hotel.  Since I was operating on very little sleep, I could not figure out what when wrong.  My female emotional side had kicked in and the tears started to fall (thank goodness I was wearing waterproof mascara).  My boyfriend, as calm as he usually is, asked to speak to someone higher up the chain.  She too was condescending and offered little help except to continuously state we were a no show and there were no rooms.  This was completely unacceptable.  I was determined to find a solution.  I continued to search my numerous emails as my boyfriend dealt with the situation.  Then, right before my eyes what did I find???  An email confirming our reservations, from the hotel, reservation number and all!!!  AH HA!!!   I tried so hard to hold back the urge to shove my phone in their condescending face and scream from the top of my lungs \\"I WIN!\\"  But, being the professional I am, I calmly walked to the counter and showed them the information.  They were not happy.  After having to email the robot my reservation information they magically found us a room.  Their response was \\"We will  honor this reservation\\".  Are you kidding me!!!  Damn straight you will.\\n\\nMoral to the story, don't give up and follow up with reservations to this hotel prior to arriving.  It appeared they pulled the same stunt with numerous colleagues also attending the conference.

Everything was reasonably value and my goodness the quality of the fish exceeds every single restaurant at the price point. none of the fish had any fishy smell and the texture of the fish was just real. The tuna and yellowtail definitely stood out because of the poor (maybe fake?) fish that many of the other establishments serve. Unfortunately, those who have been in Boston for a long time have gotten use to it. The teriyaki bentos were awesome because it was a perfect blend of Korean and Japanese flavors. I'm not sure if this was intentional but given that the owners are Korean, I certainly think it is appropriate. For those of you who want a traditional Japanese teriyaki, you won't be disappointed. Their version is great. The one mild thing we would like to see improved is the seasoning on the sushi rice. By no means is it bad, but it is a little overpowering in flavor. It sometimes takes away from the taste of the fresh fish (which is by far the superstar) and doesn't do the overall dish justice.

So I realised that the cooks forgot some of our food (expected these days) and the more experienced waitress had to come help. \\n\\nWe after the waitstaff re reading the list confirmed that some food didn't arrive (again,  lists would be helpful) and so one of the people was given a taco on the house with extra garnish.

In fact Arby's has better brisket that is more flavorful and much more tender. As for the mac & cheese it's just plain mac & cheese if you want to good macaroni and cheese and go to Hoggy's.

We opted for the chef tasting menu and in all the 20+ plates/courses, there were only maybe 3 that I didn't think were great, but even then they were not bad.  The flavors were amazing, the combinations were unique, and transitions were great throughout the courses.  Even the bread and butter was amazing (I didn't want to take up valuable stomach real estate with bread, but I couldn't stop from finishing it).  I was super full by the time we got to the meat dishes, but the last beef dish and the desserts were so delicious I couldn't pass them up and greedily ate it all.  Everyone at the table thought the wagyu steak with nori was the most amazing beef dish we'd ever eaten; so buttery yet so full of beef flavor and perfectly complimented by the salty crispy nori/seaweed.  We almost didn't want to start dessert, just so we could savor the wagyu-ness in our mouth a little longer.  Luckily, the desserts were not only super delicious, but also very unique, so we were not sad for long.  The one negative for us was the wine pairing; which was just okay (I only thought 2 of wines stood out) and I would have rather just gotten a cocktail or a bottle of wine to share instead.  So this should be a 4.5 star review, but I'm rounding up.\\n\\nComparing this to \\"fancy\\" restaurants I've been to in the California and New York, I think Castagna is actually a pretty good deal.  The food is definitely some of the best I've had (easily in my top 5) and I can imagine this costing a whole lot more in CA and NY.  The service may seem less professional, but I actually appreciate that it is not as snooty and serious, because it makes me feel more relaxed."},{"name":"Tavern In The Square","address":"120 Beverly St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"This is a great place to grab a beer before heading into the Garden to catch a game!

There was something lacking.\\n\\nAs for the service, that too was mediocre. When I asked for a high rise crust I was given the regular crust and someone had to throw away the crust to give me the high rise one.

You could make reservations online with ease--the only problem is that when you change your reservation, their systems doesn't cancel the original reservation and keep you on multiple days.  Good thing, they call to confirm the day of the reservation. \\n\\nWe ended up going on a Thursday night at 7:30pm.  The cafe side looked busy, but the restaurant was pretty empty.  There was one group dining when we arrived and another party come later.  The hostess/waitress was very friendly, she offered to take our jackets and led us to our table.  She did a wonderful job at describing all the dishes with the wine pairings.  Extremely accommodating and did not judge us for eating three servings of bread, which was a mistake because it made us uncomfortably full.  Before I get to the end, let me take you through our northwest gastronomy experience....\\n\\nBeignet: Not the best beignet and I can't recall the distinct flavors in it.  Fried well, not greasy. \\n\\nOra king salmon:  Fresh, fresh, fresh.  The carrots prepared two-ways was creative.  I love the contrasting crunch and pickled carrots with the soft bite of salmon.  \\n\\nKampachi:  The fish was more mild than the salmon and had a clean taste.  It was accompanied by turnips with a dusting of taro powder over a wasabi mousse.  The taro and wasabi was not overwhelming that you get the turnip flavor. \\n\\nSatsuma: It looks like an egg yolk in a wine glass. After I shot it, I was pleasantly surprised that it was a citrusy, sweet gelee.  \\n\\nDungeness crab, burnt grapefruit, butter: I am allergic to crab so I couldn't have this dish but they substituted it for an onion terrarium with smoked oil.  Oh my goodness, that was probably my favorite dish of the evening.  I am not a huge fan of onion...the combination of the sweetness worked well with the mildly smoked richness of the oil droplet.  The texture of the custard base was very lovely.  \\n\\nFoie gras, apple, smoked hazelnut: I cringed when I saw Foie Gras on the menu.  I love liver, but I've never warmed up to Foie Gras--it has a metallic oily taste to it that reminds me of a traumatizing experience involving monk fish liver.  I was surprised that oilness was masked by the tartness of the apple and hazelnut.  Oh, I guess I do like Foie Gras when prepared correctly. \\n\\nSturgeon finished over charcoal:  I had a different sauce, must have shellfish in the original.  Well-cooked piece of sturgeon,  the charred onion and acidic sauce that garnished the dish complemented it well. \\n\\nLocal wild mushrooms, buckwheat: Aerated mushroom??  Interesting.  It was such a unique presentation and the mushroom shined through. \\n\\nBeef zabuton, black olive, Tokyo turnips: Perfectly cooked piece of meat, tender and succulent.  The black garlic paste made this whole dish.  My second favourite dish of the meal, I just want a giant platter of this.  \\n\\nHuckleberry, salted butter tuile, chamomile: In general, I enjoy fruit sorbets.  It was such a refreshing finish to the meal.\\n\\nGoat's milk, grapefruit, lime, hazelnut:  There's a second dessert?  The frozen goat's milk the covered the top of the dish could have been more flavorful but it was light.  Unfortunately, I couldn't appreciate it because I could barely take another bite.\\n\\nPetit Fours: The meal was finished with a small piece of crispy, light chocolate sandwich.\\n\\nThe bread had a fried texture but soft in the middle served with a bacon lardo spread.  It was definitely easy to eat about three of them.  I can't recall all the wines that went with the dish, however, it all complimented very well.  The food changes the taste of the wines and elevated it.  The whole meal last about three hours from start to finish, at one point...two hours had gone by and we didn't even noticed.  I don't know if it is having so many courses well spread out or the company that made time just fly.  By 10:30pm, we were in a food coma.

It was must more laid back than during the summer kickball season (Thursday nights) when it can be quite busy with drinks flowing and music from their DJ.  \\n\\nWe were also very, very pleased with our meals.  Usually after a game I'm fine with some chips and beer, but this time we ordered two very tasty entree's.  I had the grilled tilapia which came with yucca, rice and of course - plantains.  The plantains are done to perfection and fortunately come as a side on nearly every plate, or just as an appetizer.\\n\\nAnother good thing was the new specials they had.  You can't go wrong with a free appetizer with the purchase of a drink (before 10 pm).  There was also a new late night menu (after 10 pm) which featured usual bar grub like burgers, fries, wings - but brilliantly also included an egg and cheese sandwich, also available to go.

I couldn't even finish the waiter-recommended chicken mole, which had zero resemblance to a typical central Mexican/Oaxancan mole (any) and was borderline undercooked. To be fair, the pickled beet tostada and Don Dario, Suerte's version of a margarita, were tasty. However, dinner at Torchy's Tacos would have been more satisfying. As my friend commented, this is more of a place to see and be seen. I will no longer equate a trendy/high-rated/thoughtfully decorated (i.e., instagrammable) restaurant with an enjoyable dining experience. Lesson learned.

Regardless, you can't hardly miss the place if you're looking for it. Get off 285, get on Buford Highway, look for big 88 sign, and bam, you've found it. I guess it at least scores points for not being confused with other 24 hour tofu houses on Buford highway?\\n\\nBy far my favorite thing to order is the spicy tofu soup, though maybe I'm now weaksauce, or maybe its because I show up with a Korean person, but when I get the spicy I am not disappointed. Our table always sounds like a symphony of colds, because we just sit there eating this delicious soup and having our noses running and tearing up a bit from all the pepper they put into things. I really enjoy it, though I can imagine the quality can vary, I mean look at the place. A true pleasure is watching the Korean TV, which constantly runs in the background, and always makes me wonder if they could just turn the TV off, and the image from the show would just be burned into the screen and they wouldn't need to use the electricity any more.\\n\\nAlso excellent are the appetizers, which for being such a cheap restaurant are actually pretty good, and you get a nice selection. A nice touch is that in the winter when you come they will give you this hot barley water, which tastes really good on a cold night, and actually works really well to clear my sinuses for some reason. The downside to that being that if you order spicy food, do you really want a hot drink? I generally have to ask for some ice water to go along with it, so that I can have the best of both worlds.\\n\\nOther than the tofu soups, I think the food is pretty middling. The bulgogie isn't bad but is pretty bland and kind of stringy, and the rice bowls I've gotten were good, but not really anything spectacular.

By the time we left, the restaurant was nearly half full.  \\n\\nWe started with the wok stirred edamame which is made with Parmesan, panko and some various herbs.  Its absolutely delicious, it reminded me of escargot almost w/ the delicious parm and garlic taste.\\n\\nI ordered the Chanel roll and my gf ordered some Hamachi and Bincho Maguro sashimi.  Both came out beautifully presented.  The sashimi was delicious, tasted extremely fresh and although the portion was kind of small, it was a satisfying dish.  The Chanel roll was quite possibly one of the most delicious sushi rolls I've had in Atlanta.  The scallop was sweet and it really didn't even need the scrumptious sweet chili sauce.  It was just a fantastic sushi experience, the fried scallions were a neat twist.\\n\\nUnfortunately they are still working out some kinks.  First the service was bad.  The waiter wasn't very helpful and seem uneducated, which is understandable.  They have a big board boasting of their unique Japanese alcoholic drink called but he never mention anything about it.  Also he said it was their policy to only bring one dish out at a time which is silly because some people want their own roll and in our case my girlfriend can't eat spicy foods.\\n\\nThere's another problem, almost all of the sushi rolls contain a \\"spicy\\" ingredient..  Definitely an oversight by the chef, I am sure they can remedy this problem but beware super tasters.  I would hope they'd add more non-spicy rolls to their menu.  Spicy does not necessarily equal better flavor!!!!\\n\\nOverall I cannot wait to go back, the prices are a little elevated but since I can walk to this place I'm willing to pay a little bit more.  The food was delicious, I just hope the wait staff improves.  Also their soy sauce is on the table in an interesting delivery device.

Maybe it just isn't my style, but I regularly eat out at excellent restaurants and I found there to be very little on this menu to be appealing (or even understandable 50% of the time).  Worse, I was shocked at the service.  We went with a large group (16) early and were the only people there for a long time.  When we ordered drinks the 4 of us that ordered a simple glass of wine or sparkling water had to wait almost 25 minutes to be served.  First the bartender had to prepare the 12 special, magical, intricate cocktails that our table mates ordered, which could apparently only be served at together.  When I settled on the steak and asked for it to be prepared medium to medium well the waiter looked at me disapprovingly and told me that the chef would likely not do it because he recommended medium rare.  It was only after ordering a salad and seeing the disapproving looks of the other guests that he said he would \\"ask\\" the chef if he would be \\"willing\\" to prepare it that way.  Excuse me?  Pretentious much?  (I get it will affect the tenderness and flavor of the meat.  That's the point!)  Fortunately, he indulged my personal preference, but he made us pay for it.  It was 1 1/2 hours before our appetizers came.  I did enjoy my steak, and the speckled hen salad was delicious, but I will not go there again.

When you sit at the bar, make sure you're as far away from what I think is there wine bottle recycling bin as possible. The smell will turn your stomach. The sink in the women's bathroom has a nice layer of sludge on it, that all but blends into the color of the sink, especially with the low light. \\n\\nBUT my final straw was dirty wine glasses. The last glass of wine I ordered had multiple lipstick smudges and big greasy fingerprints on it.

The lipstick was removed but the greasy fingerprints seemed to be in the exact same places. So I'm faced with two conclusions: either she wiped the lipstick off and brought the dirty glass back to me, or all their glasses were equally dirty that night. This is a health risk and a terrible experience for the customer. I can forgive a dirty fork here and there, but this goes too far.\\n\\nAnd while I'm on the topic, if you're going to offer wings on your menu, offer towelettes.

However, as I have learned the hard way, Starbucks inside of hotels are not really Starbucks. As the barista pointedly pointed out to me after I questioned the price of the Starbucks drink I ordered, \\"We are run by Marriott.\\" The impact of this difference is that the drinks will have the Starbucks brand, but not the Starbucks experience.\\n\\nI have been to this location a couple of times. (There is an actual Starbucks store on Peachtree just two blocks away.)  However, when in the Marquis, it's hard to walk past this location. First, the location is typically crowded. But even when its not, the folks inside do not have great attitudes. I went to order my typical drink, and it was 60 cents more expensive. When I had the audacity to ask why, I was snapped at. There's nothing wrong with that, except that the premium you pay for a Starbucks drink is only justified by the experience and quality of the drink. Charging 60 cents more for the exact same drink, after I've ordered it, was a little much. (But this problem comes up in any Starbucks that's not at a corporate store. You will be charged extra for extra caramel.)\\n\\nOK. So now the drink comes out. Bitter and yet too sweet. There's no real place to sit and enjoy the drink, although the lobby seems nice. Then I remember that the person in front of me got a discount of 10% because they worked for a local bank. The pricing difference now is completely nuts. And the drink is not great. And the folks who work there are in bad moods. (But that will happen anytime there is just too much traffic.)\\n\\nSo if you are in the Marquis, and need a Starbucks fix, this will not completely disappoint. But, if you have time, go to the Starbucks on Peachtree Street across from Peachtree Center station. Better coffee, cheaper.\\n\\nAlso, I don't think that there's a separate Starbucks wifi.

There is a homey feel about the place - its certainly a good neighborhood restaurant where you would be remembered if you frequented it.\\n\\nI find the food to be great - and in many cases an adventure. Mid-eastern food is not overly common aside from some falafel here and there. Their falafel is terrific by the way - a must try. It is a place to take people who like new and different things. Do not take someone who wants a hamburger. I highly recommend the \\"mid east feast\\" if you have a few people. Its is a huge spread and a great variety of things to try. Sure, not everything is for everyone - I don't love the grape leaves - but there will be SOMEthing for everyone, especially those who will try something new. \\n\\nValue wise, you get a very good deal. Prices are fairly low for the amount of food, and very friendly service. I definitely recommend giving it a try, even for takeout - don't judge this book by its cover.  \\n\\nParking on Union St can be tight, but if you cross over the train tracks (on Langley) and take a quick right on Braeland, there is plenty of parking - or take this to the corner and try your luck on Union St again."},{"name":"Castagna Restaurant","address":"1752 SE Hawthorne Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"This is the restaurant experience in SF I have been looking for! \\n\\n\\nThe food is simple, fresh, skillfully prepared, accessible, flavorful, and consistent. \\n\\nThe service is warm.

I wandered past on my way home and they were open and since I didn't feel like cooking I opted to see what they had to offer.  There are starter options, sandwich wraps and dinners.  The dinners come with a main component and sides. \\nI tried the Kibbee balls -- they are football shaped fried mixture of cracked wheat that is stuffed with ground beef --- they were tasty.  The really friendly owners also offered me a taste of the Babba so i used that to dip it in - even tastier.  I opted for a wrap - it was huge.  It was the falafel wrap in the traditional pita.  I was so happy that they were using a really thin pita - think they said that it is a typical syrian bread.  You can also opt for another option - looks more like a lavash and maybe a whole grain -- can't remember.  I really enjoyed the falafel.  I loved the flavors and sauces inside.  \\nI was able to chat with the counter person as well as the owner who is preparing the food.  They were very nice.  Loved all the info they shared about the food, etc...  They have a case that will be filled with more treats - savory and/or sweet.  \\nThere is/are (an)other falafel option(s) in Davis but very different.  I like both options but, again, they are VERY different -- you decide which you prefer or is better.  I like NOOR's flavors and the pita in their falafel and it is HUGE!  You can actually split it with someone and enjoy a starter or two.  \\nIf you are in Ball Square, Powderhouse Square, Teele Square, Davis Square or Tufts area I recommend checking them out.  You can also dine inside - think maybe about 15 seats or take to enjoy back in the comfort of home."},{"name":"sweetgreen","address":"60 State St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Wow.

I am a purveyor of the nerdy arts. I consider myself a nerd and want to encourage any and all things nerd related.\\n\\nThe first thing I noticed when I walked in was their decor. Really great. 5/5. We looked around for a bit and after not being seated I assumed we could seat ourselves so we walked towards the window on the other side (there's a partition in the middle of the tavern).\\n\\nOne of the servers in a furry animal hat came to seat us. She kind of pushed us back from where we were walking (towards the left side) and went to seat us on the right side of the bar. I asked her if we could be seated by the window, and her response was \\"there's only seats for 4 by the windows.\\" Um, ok. There were four window seats, and three were empty, and one of them even had TWO people sitting at it!! Honestly, it was about 2:10 pm, and they only had about five or so tables occupied- plenty of open tables. Strike one.\\n\\nShe also seated us on the side of the tavern she wasn't serving, so we got a different server.\\n\\nMy boyfriend at that point was already kind of offended at that and wanted to leave, but I really wanted to give them a chance, so we stayed. He ordered their cheap beer, Caribou Lager, at $3.50, I ordered a caesar and we both ordered a sandwich (mine without the bread, which she acknowledged to be gluten-free when she took our order). All food is $6, which is good, but the portions are fairly small.\\n\\nShe came back saying that they were out of Caribou Lager from last night. So she suggested another beer,  all which were more expensive (by about $2.25). Strike two.\\n\\nI got my caesar, and I am 90% sure that they either forgot to add the liquor to my drink, or that their vodka is extremely watered down. I even had my boyfriend try it and he agreed. Normally I can feel my liquor (even if its a single) if I haven't eaten and I didn't feel the liquor at all. Strike three.\\n\\nWe got our food, and although I had asked for no bread for my sandwich, there it was in all its glutinous glory. I just removed them and ate my meal. Strike four.\\n\\nFour strikes! I really really really wanted to like this place. I wanted to come here with my nerdy friends, pretend I'm at the Stormwind Inn and drink mead, but I am pretty sure that I am never coming back again.\\n\\nI am so very disappointed by my experience today. I don't know if it was because I didn't look nerdy enough, or they had an off day, but it was my first time there and the whole time we were there I just felt awkward and unimpressed. This visit also left me in a seriously sour mood for the rest of the afternoon.\\n\\nI am going to try my luck at EXP bar soon and will hopefully have a better experience."},{"name":"Hunan Bistro","address":"10700 Anderson Mill Rd, Ste 105","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Delicious food!

I've tried their steak entree on the 2 for $20 menu and sometimes, it's not that great because the steak will get dry. I've tried the bourbon street chicken and shrimp and I didn't like it. It was too burnt for me. I like their three cheese chicken penne. It comes in a big bowl with garlic bread. I didn't like the garlic bread because it was too hard for me. I've also tried something on their regular menu, the quesadilla burger. Imagine a burger, but without the bun and quesadilla wrap on the outside as the bun. I thought it was pretty good and very different from your normal burger. On other visits, I've tried their after 10pm special of half off appetizers. The cheeseburger sliders were cooked too much for my preferences and were dry. The potato twisters are good here and are served with spicy queso. The fries are okay here. I really like their one dessert, triple chocolate meltdown. Warm cake with a warm fudge center and ice cream on the sides all drizzled with dark and white chocolate  = heaven in any girl's book. I like that they open really late and also change the lighting depending on the time of the day. I've had good servers here and below average servers here, but it doesn't stop me from coming here.

We all like pie, so we decided to check out Random Order Pie Bar. Pies, booze, evening coffee, what a great idea! No crazy line? Even better. \\n\\nWe ordered a slice of banana cream, bourbon pecan, and strawberry rhubarb. None of us were all that impressed with our pies, but I was thoroughly unimpressed with my slice of bourbon pecan. \\n\\nWhen it was placed on the counter, the consistency of the pie's filling was SO DRY that part of it crumbled off. Folks, I'm no expert on pecan pie, but I'm pretty sure it's not supposed to do that. The pecan pie I have become accustomed to has a gooey texture in the middle, keeping the nutty bits intact. This slice of pecan was crumbling apart, leaving the pecan mince all over the plate. The filling had the consistency of wet sand and tasted mostly like molasses. Not like bourbon, nor pecan. No, no. This was not your average pecan pie, it was so much worse. I will spare you the review of the crust for now because it was also not ideal. \\n\\nMy boyfriend got the banana cream pie and that was actually somewhat decent. The cream was rich and delicious, though I wish there was a little bit more banana filling. The banana filling was custardy and had the perfect amount of sweetness. However, again, the crust was not very good. \\n\\nI only had a quick bite of the filling of the strawberry rhubarb. It was fine, but on the sweeter side as though it was mostly strawberry. \\n\\nThe crusts all around were horrible. The bottom of my pecan pie tasted like paper. Not buttery in the slightest. \\n\\nI don't write a lot of reviews because most of the time, the Yelp! page is pretty on par with my experience at a place. However, this Yelp! page seems to have a lot of poorly directed pie fanatics and people who don't seem to \\"get\\" that restaurants where you order from a counter and restaurants where you order from a waiter require a different level of service expectation. Like, someone wrote a pie-centric parody of \\"Hello Goodbye\\" in a review.

Because of the boatloads of Yelp reviews, we went here on our trip to Florida, and we had a nice evening.  The restaurant is quite large, which turns out to be a pretty good thing.  So many restaurants of this type have their otherwise pleasant atmosphere spoiled by cramming you into tables so close that you can bump elbows with your neighbor, but this place felt like there was some breathing room.\\n\\nBased on everyone's recommendations, we had the Gruyere biscuits, and though they were quite good, I don't know that they were the revelation that we were led to believe they might be.  That's kind of the theme of the night.  Everything was quite good, but not enough was really astounding.\\n\\nWe had a couple of salads, the steak frites, and I snagged one of the limited amount of briskets.  The salads were quite nice, with decent portions and lots of fresh, interesting ingredients.  The steak was cooked properly, but didn't have much to distinguish itself from a steak that you could get at any other restaurant of this caliber.  The truffle fries were truffle fries, so they were delicious, but again, didn't stand out from others we've had.  The brisket was perfection, though, and I was glad we went for an early dinner so I could get one.  Flavor, texture, and complementary sauces and sides, everything worked extremely well together.\\n\\nOn the service side, everyone was nice, but there was a fairly long wait between the salads and the entrees, and the waiter checked in to say things would be coming \\"right up\\" several times.  I think there was a miscommunication in the kitchen, or someone took our order to another table, or something.  \\n\\nSo there were just a few things that ended up making this a bit less of an experience than we were hoping for.  That said, in the wasteland that is the Orlando area, I would absolutely recommend taking a trip to the Ravenous Pig.

And then some more.  It took the waitress 40 minutes to bring us our bread and beverages.  \\n\\nFor an appetizer, we shared chicken summer rolls.  If we hadn't been so hungry, we would have sent them back.  The rolls tasted like something you would get in a college dining hall.  The bread, on the other hand, was delicious once it finally arrived.  It was a whole grain bread and was hearty and flavorful.  \\n\\nFor my entree, I ordered the beef tenderloin.  It was tender, but completely lacked any sort of flavor.  \\n\\nDessert was the meal's one saving grace.  Desserts are served as 3 mini desserts on one plate.

We then sat at the bar hoping to get a drink while we waited for a table. At 645 I lost my mind and walked over to what appeared to be a manager and asked if he had a bar tender. He said yes and pointed to a man serving a table. 10 additional minutes past and I asked politely but firm if I needed to pour my own drink at the bar or should I just leave. 10 mins later another random person that was busting a table previously walked over and ask if he could pour us a drink.

The problem isn't that it is a bad value, or that the food is bad or that the employees are rude (none of the above is the case).  The problem is that there are numerous Mexican food carts that it competes with, carts who do not have the expense of restrooms or a fully-equipped kitchen.  There are food cart pods on 48th, on 50th, and on Powell alone.  The demographics of the neighborhood do not facilitate it converting a table-service restaurant, either.  For this reason, the price it charges for order-at-the-counter burrito or nachos is slightly higher than at a truck.  This is of little concern to me as I usually order the special on the chalkboard: entr√©e, beans, rice, and chips for $5.75, on par with a cart.  \\n\\nWith a name like La Salsa one expects a decent salsa bar and it delivers.  The avocado is quite tasty and the others range in spiciness from mild to get-me-some-water!  The meat is tasty in the entr√©e as well the enchilada sauce suits the meal.

But it was spectacular and warm. The clam centered in the bowl surrounded by diced potatoes was a pleasant introduction to my palate. Next up were the hand-cut fries, a Knuckle Sandwich & a Roscoe...\\n\\nOh boy! If i could order a full size Roscoe and eat it with my hands I would be here once maybe even twice a week! The Roscoe was INCREDIBLE! So what, chicken & waffles is my favorite dish! If it wasn't it would be after biting into this tender sweet juicy sweet -- did I see say sweet!? -- fried chicken breast bookended by waffle rectangles and drizzled with coffee maple (I'm not a coffee drinker nor a fan of the bean in any form but the coffee maple drizzle was spectacular!).  Because it is not on the regular menu my next visit will be during Happy Hour and I guarantee I will be ordering no less than 4 of these bite size masterpieces!\\n\\nThe Knuckle Sandwich is a miniature lobster rolls. Not the best I have ever had and absolutely not the worst (on a trip to Kittery, ME I stopped into a McDonald's to try their local special McLobster Roll and it was absolutely horrible). More mayonnaise than I care to have but  not bad for $4. The fries were okay and pretty well seasoned but again the bang for your buck is in the Roscoe!\\n\\nService could add a star but a full size Roscoe would definitely add one! Having been here for regular dinner service nothing struck me to make me want to come back; that is until...

We walked in and was not greeted at all. Then we were a bit confused as to where to go to do the different activities. After standing in the lobby looking around, I approached the counter as three employees stood talking to each other. They acted like I was a bother to come to the counter to ask a question. I asked about bowling which was $36 per person per hour. Ridiculous!!! I then asked where can I sign my kids up for laser tag. They pointed me around the corner and down some stairs. Instead of one of the three showing me, I had to find my way. Then I got downstairs to get the same treatment. The staff was engrossed in their own conversation and could have cared less if I needed help. Because it was spring break, I wanted my kids to do laser tag so I paid $16 for two to do laser tag. They enjoyed it but the service here is terrible at the Atlanta location!!!!! For bowling, we went right down the street to AMF Bowling and got unlimited bowling for $16.10 per person and it was a greater experience. \\n\\nIf this location doesn't tighten up their service, people will not visit.

I would donate $255 to the Pine Street Inn Homeless Shelter, & The Boston Taj would donate $1,016.00. These donations totals were not random, in fact they reflected the cost of 2x Adult Thanksgiving seating's @ the Taj = $170 plus 2x Child Thanksgiving seating's @ the Taj = $84 (2016 pricing). I calculated the Taj Boston donation upon the number \\"4\\". I made 4 attempts to make a reservation for 4 people, hence the Taj Boston donation would be 4x $254 (2016 pricing).

A 23.8% INCREASE FROM 2016!!!!! A Child seating has increased from $42 to $45, a 1.7% increase over 2016. I've yet to receive a response to the following question I posed in to The Taj Boston/Mr. Beuno regarding PROFITEERING \\"Just out of curiosity, what's \\"different\\" between '16 & '17 that adds 23.8% more value to the Taj Thanksgiving experience?\\"\\n\\nTAJ BOSTON GREED: I was specific with Mr. Beuno that I didn't want to know of any Taj Boston charitable giving, so much so that I stated \\"Personally (I'm exceedingly blunt), a donation to Boston's homeless was never my want, nor have I ever made such a donation.\\" Indeed, that sounds terrible, however I went on to explain that I give solely to trusts for the families of 9/11 victims since I'm from NY. Mr Beuno opted to ignore my request & responded \\"volunteering at the Women's Lunch Place, providing a holiday meal to the homeless population served at The Arlington Street Church and sending a Thanksgiving meal to our Fire Department on Columbus Avenue\\"'. It is certainly not my place to judge, thus my response was \\"It's very honorable that the Taj serves \\"Holiday/Thanksgiving\\" meals to those in need & those performing their civil duties. I recognize the extreme costs of doing so, perhaps that is the rationale for the 23.8% increase? (Realistically, the Taj giving meals is \\"spillage\\" for what would've gone to waste, not to mention the F&B purchasing power of the Taj...a monetary donation, \\"ain't that\\").\\" In my personal opinion, the Taj Boston \\"giving\\" meals is pretty lame because if they weren't \\"given\\" they would simply be \\"spillage\\" & be tossed. The Taj Boston must forecast it's Thanksgiving F&B \\"buy\\", & in doing so, it must add enough margin so that any of those guests paying 23.8% ($110) more for Thanksgiving 2017 never hear \\"Unfortunately we're all out of the....\\", hence Taj Boston/Mr.Taj Boston buy more than needed, & then consider what would go to waste as \\"giving\\". My offer for resolution was monetary. I've gotten no response in 7 days, thus when a monetary pledge for resolution---& it's only $1,000 & I have to donate $250---is rejected it is out of the sheer GREED of Mr. Beuno, Mr. Karambir Kang, Taj Corporate & the Taj Boston.\\n\\nToo many characters....-David"},{"name":"Caff√© Medici","address":"200 Congress Ave, Ste 2B","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Really cool coffee house in downtown Austin not far from Congress Bridge.

I also try to avoid them during peak times, but recently I have become more frustrated with my experiences. At first, I would eat lunch here about once every two weeks. The food was fresh and good-sized portions for the price. However, it seems there are less ingredients and just not well-made. Also, I once ordered from the same older gentleman each time who was nice and always took the time to make sure my order was correct, and now the cashiers rush me and are usually very distracted. The food comes out a lot quicker than it used to, but I don't mind waiting a bit longer for the food to be made with greater care though.\\n\\nThe Asian chicken salad and the chicken salad were my favorites at first. They have changed them slightly over the years and now the chicken salad has too much mayo and not enough of the other ingredients, such as grapes. In fact, I can't even remember if any grapes were in my last salad. Honestly, I would frequent Kitchen Door (which was once up the street from here but has since closed) and they had the best chicken salad in town. The only only sandwich I order now is the mozzarella and tomato sandwich on focaccia. It is well-seasoned and never disappoints. The broccoli and cheese soup, though a bit too salty, serves its purpose for me because it is loaded with pieces of broccoli. I have tried the pastries and breads on occasion and they are okay but sometimes stale. With Russell's near by, it in no way makes sense to not go there for breakfast pastries.\\n\\nEfficiency with ordering is definitely a problem. My thought is that you stand near the first and then when the second is free, the cashier will call you over. However, try telling that to most of the patrons who elbow you as they bust over to the second as soon as the customer leaves. Calling out these customers for rudeness is futile. I am shocked that with all the complaints about the ordering, they have done nothing to improve. Reading reviews which are over four years old explaining the problem make me even more frustrated. Maybe they don't know how to fix the problem? Here is a suggestion: a sign that reads \\"line forms here\\" where the railing ends at the cake and cupcake display. Then, the line can wrap around and extend into the mailing center. \\n\\nFrom my observations over the years, they aren't doing poorly. Their customers are regulars who live or work near by and have been patronizing KP years longer than I have, and I am wiling to bet they rely on getting the same meal every time they come but don't notice any difference because they just are accustom to routine.

Honestly, THE best I've ever had... and epic plate.  (NOTE: calling it confit is a misnomer, as it's olive oil poached and worth every penny!)\\n\\n* Pork Tenderloin with bean cassoulet, house sausage & mushrooms - Not really a cassoulet, but maybe a modern interpretation.  Yet, it was cooked perfectly with great flavor and texture, especially the fava-like beans.\\n\\n* Swank Burger with truffle aioli, cave aged gruyere, bacon, arugula, pretzel bun\\n- cooked to spot-on medium rare with a good house grind.  It was tasty, but a bit rich for us.

It's one of those \\"why did I think of that?\\" combinations.. and the little pieces of peanut brittle, while a little on the small side (just a touch bigger might add more crunch and flavor), added an interesting twist. The rapini, miso, dashi, pickled golden raisins, and pine nuts was my favorite. the sauce is crazy good, people.. and yes, get the side of rice so you can soak up every bit of it. My husband tried the lemongrass pork sandwich, and said it was excellent -- bahn mi inspired, it looked really good.\\n\\nThe staff is friendly, and the space is open, bright, and casual.

But this time I just can't do it.  50 Plates sucked.\\n\\nI was so excited to go here.  I heard lots about it and demanded I have girl's night happy hour here instead of Roux.  Big mistake. \\n\\nI think I started to get turned off when I went in, stood at the hostess station, and was ignored while three hottie girls got the attention of the hostess and manager.  Finally, after somebody else walked up and got help, I got the attention of the hostess and told her I would be sitting outside with others.  Our service was atrocious.  It took 10-15 minutes for the server to notice us on the patio and give us menus.  We came for happy hour.  There are two cocktails at happy hour price, but she mentioned another one with the two happy hour cocktails, and only said it was regular priced when I asked if it was happy hour priced too.  Very sneaky, because all non-happy cocktails are 9 bucks.  \\n\\nThe \\"Thirst Days\\" drinks are the moscow mule and magaritas, each 6 dollars.  The drinks come with complimentary pimento cheese toasts.  We never got those, though they did bring us a tiny serving of complimentary popcorn.  Thanks.  The happy hour dish, for 3.50, is fries with gravy,  You can add \\"fried squeaky cheese.\\"  We asked what that was, the waitress said, \\"I don't know.\\"  Turns out it is fried cheese curds.  We then asked if the gravy had meat product in it, were told, \\"I don't know.\\"  It does.  You can get other dishes for 1.50, 2.50, 4.50, beer for 4.00 and wine for 6.00.  There is not a happy hour menu, it's a \\"bar\\" menu with some happy hour pricing, but be aware the \\"Bar\\" pricing is the same as the \\"dinner\\" menu, so you may as well order off the dinner menu if you get anything that isn't specifically marked happy hour.  I had the Roscoe's sammie, which was 3.50 on the dinner and bar menu, and it was a soggy maple tasting waffle under a chicken tender with a dry waffle on top, with a weird mustard relish on the side.  Yuck.\\n\\nThe waitress neglected to put an order in, and she apologized, which was cool.  The manager came over later and said he overheard it wasn't put in on time and would be comped.  It was on the bill.  When my friend mentioned it the waitress acted indignant, said, \\"I don't know anything about that, I didn't hear him say that\\" and stormed off.  She took the bill inside and the charge was removed.  She also put in late drink orders and apologized for those, but eventually got them all out to us.\\n\\nI had the media noche sandwich, which is a fancy grilled cheese with pork and gruyere.  It was greasy and not very good.   Had I not been very hungry it wouldn't have been eaten, but I hadn't eaten all day because I was going to 50 Plates!   I keep hearing about people getting a little spoon of chocolate after their entree, but I didn't get that.\\n\\nWe did enjoy sitting on the patio, we liked the filtered still and sparkling water at the table, and the restaurant has the potential to be great.  The service was awful.  Do not call me and my friends, \\"darling.\\"  We are all in our 30's and 40's, and if you feel familiar enough to call me \\"darling,\\" then you should be buying my dinner.   One of my friends was a waitress and was horrified by the service, and was ready to tip 5-10%, but I just can't do that, because I know people are working for a living, even if they aren't very good at what they do.\\n\\nThe inside of the restaurant is pretty, clean and modern.  The bathrooms have cool fixtures, but no coat hooks, for the coat hook crowd.  \\n\\nI would not go back to 50 Plates.   I didn't bother saying anything to the manager, he already knew there was a problem, as he tried to comp something due to poor service.  \\n\\nI did get to see a celebrity there (I wont say who, but his initials are Don B.!)

Butter and garlic aromas plus sprinkled with herbs, so it's not just \\"plain\\" naan.\\n-In many Indian restaurants you'd be charged extra for these \\"extras\\" on top of boring plain naan, on top of probably charging you $2 for a basket of two plain naan cut up into wedges.\\nSince rice and naan is free here, remember this as you peruse Vij's prices before you compare them to other Indian restaurants which may charge you $2 per bowl of rice or medium naan.

If you're willing to leave it and not totally clean your plate, then it's no problem and you can decline naan and/or rice.\\n\\nVij's Monarch Butterfly ($13.50) raw sugar and ghee braised squash with woodear mushrooms in coconut saffron curry\\n-Very interesting to try, with many flavours and textures.\\n-If you insist, you could probably make a dinner of it by asking for extra naan or even rice. There's a lot of watery sauce that isn't watery-tasting, so it's worth trying to get at it.\\n-If you are just having this as an appetizer, watch out you don't eat so much naan and rice that you can't finish the rest of your orders.\\n\\nOur eating team ordered three mains: Lamb Popsicles, Pork Tenderloin, and Sablefish. The basic composition here appears to be grilled item + sauce. The presentation is such that the grilled items are not so coated in sauce as to be inseparable. The watery-ness of the sauce means that you really have to cut your protein in small pieces and dip thoroughly if you insist on getting a good amount of sauce with each bite (or you can ask for a tablespoon as the only spoon is the serving spoon).\\n\\nFor me, the separation of grilled item and sauce worked out to just that -- a separation, instead of a more integrated, if homogeneous, flavour that you generally find in Indian curries where the meat is stewing right in the curry.\\nMy personal bias is that grilled meat is grilled meat (so, steak is steak, for example). The grilling is nicely done here but did not justify the price. So the sauce and the combination had to work for me to really like a particular dish. Again, this is my particular and peculiar bias. Your experience of the mains at Vij's will probably be a lot less picky.\\n\\nWine marinated lamb popsicles ($29.75)\\n-There's wine involved? Where?\\n-Lamb nicely grilled and looked like medium rare on the inside.\\n-Curry was ok but I found the sourness detracted from it.\\n-Trying hard not to score this too low because expectations had been set by all those previous reviews I've read that raved about it. For me, this was just OK, expecially considering it's basically $30.\\n\\nGrilled sablefish ($29.75)\\n-Really tender, buttery sablefish. Yum.\\n-Broth tasted like boring tomato soup. That totally ruined it for me.\\n-Portion of sablefish looked really skimpy for what is basically a $30 dish, especially when the broth did nothing to enhance my enjoyment of it.\\n\\nPork tenderloin ($29) in tangy cayenne and ginger curry\\n-There's ginger? Maybe my taste buds got confused after the lamb popsicles curry but the curry here was pretty boring.\\n-Pork nicely grilled and with good flavour from some charring.\\n\\nBonus points for non-pushy, friendly service as well as nice old-school service touches like full cutlery replacement after our appetizer, and wiping down the table after clearing the plates. Overall, close enough for full marks, though definitely not for food alone. It's not extremely tasty or satisfying, but the service and extras (chai, free rice and naan) really add extra value. If you don't care for carbs, ambiance, or service then this is a 3/5 sort of place with points lost for cost."},{"name":"Tin Shed Garden Cafe","address":"1438 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Best spot to hit up for brunch in town for anyone with a pup dawg!

I read some blogs recommending it so we decided to give it a try. The restaurant really captures the Pacific Northwest feel; I love the high ceilings and wooden accents throughout. Our bread service was just ok, nothing spectacular to write about but hey we came here for the meat. \\n\\nI started out with the smoked Portobello mushroom soup, yes it is very creamy. I liked it a lot because I'm usually a big fan of cream based soups. It had a rich flavor layered throughout and I'd highly recommend it even at $10 (at the time lol). \\n\\nI went with the meat trio which was bison, venison, and sausage. I wasn't too fond of the venison because it was a little too gamey for me and left a weird aftertaste in my mouth but my wife loved it. I really wish I just ordered a whole portion of the bison ... it was that good. I'm usually good with sharing food but deep down I wanted it all to myself, I let her have a bite and then pretended to zone out while I devoured the rest of the bison steak myself. It was very lean but the texture wasn't anything like a lean steak, it was full of flavor and easy to chew.\\n\\nMy significant other who I denied the bison, decided to go with their signature salmon on a plank. I thought it was just ok for that price, it was good but didn't feel the plank added any additional flavor. Overall we thought that it was a good place to dine on the WDW resort but not great. I'd say it's a top 10 specialty restaurant but not a top 5."},{"name":"Poppin Pita Grill","address":"420 14th St NW, 100B","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I'm a big fan of Mediterranean, and having lived in Palestine for 2 years I have high standards.

What could make it better?  Margaritas before the movie!  We decided to grab a drink next to the Alamo.  So naturally in comes Casa Garcia - it is a Mexican food restaurant, so there has to be margaritas.  What could go wrong with margaritas and chips?  \\n\\nWe walk in and inform the hostess that we will be sitting at the bar (this is around 3 pm)  We sit down, and no bartender.  No big deal - a very nice busboy (is that really what they're still called?  Seems offensive - please let me know if there is another term) dropped off chips and salsa after a few minutes.  Still no bartender.  The woman next to us looks frustrated like she's been there for longer than us without service.\\n\\nAgain, no big deal - stuff happens, especially in the afternoon.  Not upset at all, I walk up to the hostess (the same one to whom we had made our previous seat announcement) and asked \\"Is there a bartender?\\" (in other words, can we get service?)  She looks at me and says \\"Oh, no.\\"  And it wasn't like \\"oh, no, I can't believe that there isn't one, I'm so sorry.\\"  It was a \\"Oh,no\\" as in \\"Oh, of course not you moron, how could you not know that?\\"  Again, this is the same person that we told that we were going to sit at the bar.  I guess what we should have said is \\"We're going to sit at the bar with the intention of ordering drinks, a) is that ok? and b) will there be a bartender available to serve us?\\"\\n\\nI guess I wouldn't have minded so much except for the fact that several actual servers walked by us and I noticed them looking at us.  At first I thought they were looking at us thinking \\"where the hell is [insert fictional bartender's name here]?\\"  Instead, I suppose they were thinking \\"Why the hell do people keep sitting at the bar?  Maybe if we ignore them they will go away.\\"\\n\\nSo, long review short - very annoyed.  I'm sure it's a wonderful restaurant with wonderful margaritas.

We had a party of 8, and our waitress took all of our orders and even read them back to us for accuracy. After all of that, two people still had the wrong food when it came out and an apology was never offered.  Some of my boneless buffalo wings were so tough that I couldn't chew them. I was having to spit pieces out in my napkin, while trying not to look extremely rude and disgusting. \\n\\nThe real kicker was when it came time to split up our checks. We told her from the very beginning how the checks would be split up. She brought them out wrong the first time - no big deal...we wrote on them and fixed them for her to help with what went where. This happened FOUR MORE TIMES. Each time they were wrong, and since someone in our party had to go to work, we just paid what we were given eventually. From the time she first brought our checks to the time we actually paid, it was almost 25 minutes. There's no excuse for it to take that long to get checks correct when we all only had entrees, and we told her whose checks to put the quesos on. \\n\\nOverall, the Taco Mac near Cumberland is way better.

Our waitress disappeared and allowed at least three tables to look around for her, wondering if only regulars got the good service. At the 70 minute mark, my priority shifted from ordering a second beer and perhaps more food to just paying and leaving. By 90 minutes, I felt like I should (and could, easily) have just walked out without paying. The food was good, but not worth my time. An hour and a half for one beer and a slice of \\"B-\\" pizza?

Sometimes you just get warm ones ... but our second serving on Monday was pretty much just seconds out of the oven. It was a delight!

The food was good, but not great.\\n\\nI went here for lunch with a group of 4 coworkers.  The weather was fantastic, and we were able to sit outside.  We were all set for a great meal with great atmosphere.  Then our server showed up.  First thing, she made a crack about how great the fries were, and then she went on to note that that's why her a$$ was probably so big.  Yes, she actually used profanity during her opening sentence.  Now, I'm no stranger to profanity, but at a fine dining establishment, it's not something you'd expect straight off.  After we ordered, the server then did not show up for at least 30 minutes.  Finally, our food arrived.  Some of it was lukewarm, some of it was cold.  Despite the temperature, the food was alright.  Our server then dissappeared for another 30 minutes....I also noticed she did not check in with us to see how things were, or if we needed anything after a few minutes, which was strange.  After awhile, the bus boy arrived to clear our empty plates.  Still no server.  Finally, my boss waved at her to get her attention and she came over; we asked for the check.  She brought the check right over, then waited next to the table for my boss to insert the card.  While my boss was looking the check over, the woman actually held her hand out over my face, palm open hands on her hip, waiting for the check.  Wow!  I have never seen this done before at any kind of restaurant!!  I promise, we didn't do anything to offend this woman, she just plain had poor manners.

It was pretty disappointing, to see how little consideration they have for a key ingredient in their single breakfast sandwich.\\n\\nI can only hope that they prepare their other sandwiches with better care for the preparation of ingredients.

I'm talking about the hearty, Chinese dumplings and not the paper-thin Japanese Goyozas so when my girlfriend, who got her dumplings before mine, started complaining that hers were too \\"doughy\\" I laughed it off and tried to explain the perfection of the thick pan-fried dough.\\n\\nAnd then I took a bite....\\n\\nNothing fantastic going on here, nope. This was just plain under-cooked food. I couldn't wrap my mind around how a near raw food item had made it's way out to the customer. A chef roommate of mine once told me to never be timid about voicing displeasure with the food and that cooks appreciate it because what they want most is for the customer to sincerely enjoy their food. Not so at the Dumpling Room; when I told the server that they were under-cooked and that we couldn't finish them she responded with \\"duly noted,\\" and did absolutely nothing. \\n\\nThat's right, we couldn't finish them. Did I mention that dumplings are my favorite food? In all my years as a professional dumpling-eater this had never happened before. I would have never thought that anything could come between me and my love for dumplings, but it turns out that if you don't cook the food I won't put that mess in my mouth. \\n\\nAnd the servers. There are only a few tables in the place and more than enough servers, but there seemed to be very little structure. None of the staff seemed to know who our server was; we were asked if we were ready to order several times by additional servers after we had already placed our order. \\n\\nIt's really quite heartbreaking, honestly.

Sure, I'm as late to the party as a worrisome period, but the egg finally dropped and everything has returned to normal again.  That was quite the graphic analogy, but to maintain my consistently audacious comments I refuse to back space my way into generic town.\\n\\nAnyway, I had an opportunity to make reservations here through 'opentable' so I can continue to rack up points with them in their system.  Although, it is extremely difficult to find availability at this restaurant.  It is almost as if I am trying to schedule an audience with King George III.  My advice is to book something way in advance in order to obtain such a 'coveted and sought after' dining table.\\n\\nI had a bit of trouble arriving here since my sense of direction was rather lacking due to the absence of my glasses.  Apparently, George Costanza is not correct when claiming that squinting gives one 20/20 vision.  It only initiates mild headaches after some time and further solidifies unhappy wrinkles on the brow.  Therefore, be sure that if you're heading west on Fairbanks/Aloma to make a left at the bifurcation and head down Orange Avenue just past Fiddler's Green.  The place will be about 3 minutes down the road on your left, or 10 minutes if you're over 70 years of age.\\n\\nParking is a bit difficult if the night is busy, you may have to walk just a tad after parallel parking somewhere nearby.  If parallel parking is your worst nightmare, I suggest taking advantage of their valet service.\\n\\nWalking into the restaurant I was very happy to see that it was teeming with life and very crowded.  This type of activity usually means that the place does indeed maintain its reputation as a great spot for the epicurean snob.  \\n\\nThe inside of the restaurant is well designed, not too large, but not too small like a Manhattan studio apartment.  Three separate areas are partitioned and compartmentalized creating a more intimate ambiance (see my photo).\\n\\nThe waiter was very cordial and extremely anxious and ecstatic in talking about the options available to us on the menu.  He was very detailed about everything, at one point I was considering asking him for the specific ingredients of each dish presented.  Nevertheless, he did happen to advise me on a specific wine to try and I must say it was pure money.  It was a white wine, a glass of Muscadet '11.  It was fresh and yummy (see my photo).  \\n\\nFor appetizers I was immediately sold on two options; the Creekstone Farms Beef Tartare (see my photo), and the Pork Belly & Diver Scallop (see my photo).  The presentation was outstanding.  Although, the second appetizer was put in a very nonfunctional plate which was clearly utilized only for aesthetic purposes.  The beef tartare was exceptional, it came with some caviar on top and a tiny sunny side up egg which seemed to have been hit by Rick Moranis's shrinking beam (Honey, I Shrunk the Kids 1989 reference).  I spread these delicious items over a crunchy crostini and proceeded to enjoy it thoroughly.  The pork belly was also delicious, extremely well done and almost reminiscent of Chicharr√≥n[es] in their texture.  The Scallop was also delicious (but not reaching the divinity in taste of Ocean Prime's continuous monopoly on the local Scallop offerings).\\n\\nFor the main course, the two dishes selected were the Steak Frites (see my photo) and the Broken Arrow Ranch Sarsaparilla Venison (see my photo).  The steak frites is a difficult dish to disappoint considering its satisfying and simplistic contents.  The 'frites' were lightly bathed in truffle oil which is like coating an average piece of stone in fine 24k gold.  No disappointments here.  The venison dinner was also delicious; I recommend ordering it medium rare given the type of meat involved.  \\n\\nFinally for the 'Pi√®ce de r√©sistance,' the bread pudding (see my photo) was ordered for dessert.  My my, the combination of ingredients here just make for an end result that is like a continuous re-run of the happiest moment in your life reduced to small bites and experienced in taste rather than any other sensation.  You'll get the idea by reading the following list:  chocolate-hazelnut bread pudding, nutella ice cream, hazelnut brittle.  I honestly don't what your inner fat kid is still doing reading this and not heading to this place for this much [un]needed dessert.\\n\\nOverall,  The Ravenous Pig is top notch.  Some dishes are cooked with locally grown ingredients which is always a +1 in my book.  The atmosphere is fantastic, the cocktail list intriguing, the food is amazing, and the service was great.

Both my husband and I have some experience with tapas, he is from Spain and I used to live there, so we went with the intention to get our tapas fix. On the one hand the food is really good. It tastes great and it has the benefit of being different that what you get at most restaurants. We ordered the oxtail, calamares, empanadas, croquetas, a dessert and two drinks. Each one was really tasty. The oxtail was indulgent and had a great flavor. The croquetas were almost exactly like we remembered them from Spain, and the other two dishes were good. \\n\\nMy main issue I have with the restaurant is the price. The yelp header should have $$$ or $$$$ dollar signs not just two. We managed to spend 75$ including tip which is way more than I have ever spent on tapas. And when it comes down to what we ordered I am not totally sure it was worth the price. I don't want to sound like one of \\"those\\" people, but in Spain you could easily get out of a tapas bar for 15$ a person and eat approximately the same amount of food we ate.

A small, intimate space nestled inside a beautiful old-timey building, you walk through the century-old marble lobby and are quickly enveloped in one of the red leather booths.\\n\\nThe restaurant had maybe a dozen people in it, and it was almost at capacity. One woman (the warm, professional, ambiguously-European Inez) served us as host, bartender, waiter and oyster-shucker, and did so marvellously. Always with a gentle nudging toward the best items on the menu or wine list (even suggesting we buy a cheaper but tastier bottle than the one we were considering - a rarity indeed!), we felt taken care of as if we were guests in her home.\\n\\nWe arrived very early for their Monday night specials - buck-a-shuck oysters and half-price bottles of wine. Their usual prices are a bit high for us (although we're a younger couple, one of which is still going to school), but during happy hour it's an absolute bargain.\\n\\nThe oysters are as fresh and delicious as I've ever had them - even living up to that fantastic Christmas dinner a few years ago when my family and I drove to an oyster farm and ate them fresh from the sea. They're complemented with a variety of sauces and toppings, although (as Inez pointed out) the oysters are best with just a tiny squeeze of fresh lemon juice. The sauces are delicious (particularly one made with soy sauce and what tasted like a hint of rice wine vinegar and bonito flakes) but tend to overpower the oysters, and these ones are so fresh that they're all you want to taste.\\n\\nWhat a great little place."},{"name":"Starbucks","address":"1346 Worcester Rd","city":"Natick","stars":"3","text":"I purchased a coffee mug as a Christmas gift.

I also got udon noodles which were really tricky to keep timing on and they ended up getting a bit soggy...gotta be ready to eat them really fast ; )  \\n\\nBeing from New York, the only complaint I had was the cleanliness and sanitation.

It is world-class in terms of ingenuity, and it presents food that makes you pay attention. I eat often in creative restaurants all over the world, and this place gave me one of the most innovative meals of my life. I mean, red pepper leather-wrapped goat cheese? I loved the tang of red bell pepper and the spice of whatever other pepper they threw in. Sure, there's liquid nitrogen frozen yogurt on olive oil poached salmon, but Castagna isn't afraid to keep it simple, even when it's being mind-blowingly creative.  (We ordered the 10-course tasting menu, and the leather/goat cheese was just a \\"snack\\")\\n\\nBefore going to Castagna, I had looked on yelp and saw star ratings all over the place. After my experience, I can't believe that the 1 and 2-star ratings could have been caused by the food. The chefs are just too highly skilled. I don't think this restaurant is for everyone or for every occasion, because the food is so creative that it begs you to play with it, savor it, focus on it, and have fun with it. The dining room is minimalist, and it reminded me of when I used to work at a fine dining restaurant in Maine. That restaurant had been open for 25 years at the time, and the owner wanted the nightly service to be a type of theater. Castagna's tall curtains reminded me of the curtains of a stage, and the food was in the spotlight. So, though this restaurant is more expensive than most Portland restaurants, note that it serves both a show and a meal. \\n\\nAgain, concerning the 1-3 star ratings, I think you have to love food to enjoy this restaurant. It is not a good place for a business meeting or any other type of meal where you want to focus predominantly on conversation. Go to Pok Pok, etc.--something less formal. Because at Castagna, the food takes over. Each dish is so different that it takes a moment just to recognize the ingredients... even when it's something like Fuji apple.\\n\\nI can't recommend this restaurant enough."},{"name":"Antica Pizzeria & mozzarella Bar","address":"249 W State Hwy 436, Ste 1105","city":"Altamonte Springs","stars":"4.5","text":"Mmmm pizza!

Gilbert's Wood Fired Steaks & Seafood Columbus","address":"1 E Campus View Blvd","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"One of my favorite restaurants in Columbus, for sure.  This was our second time here and even better than the first. (We went for the bar's happy hour last time - ditch the durango shrimp, get the filet. The chocolate \\"souffle\\" - more like a lava cake, was pretty good). We went for the regular dining because they mailed me a $25 coupon for my birthday. \\n\\nWe started off with the maytag potato chips because of a foursquare deal - I thought it was pretty good, the girlfriend thought it was just ok. I normally don't like blue cheese, but the dressing had a great bite and aged cheese taste to it. SUPER greasy though.\\n\\nOur meal was then followed up by a sourdough bread with two different types of butter. Neither of us like sourdough, so it was meh. Though the 2nd type of butter - not sure what it was - smelled and tasted great. Some other reviewers got pretzel bread.\\n\\nMy gf got the 4oz filet mignon combo with crab cake, lobster mac and cheese, and sauteed spinach. The spinach is what you'd expect, nothing mind blowing. Crab cakes were delicious, although a little dry. However, they have a tasty tangy dipping sauce for the crab which more than makes up for it. The lobster mac and cheese...omg, they was heaven in a dish. I've never tasted mac and cheese so good. Also had these breadcrumbs or something on top that gave it such a nice little crunch. She got her steak medium as her jaw was a little sore and didn't want to get medium rare. Still extremely juicy, in fact, I thought it was juicier than my medium rare (though she thought the opposite). For my filet, I had the garlic brocolini and mushroom risotto sides. The risotto was pretty good, creamy and lots of mushrooms. The brocolini was about average.\\n\\nSince they knew we were going for my birthday, I was also offered a free dessert, score! They brought out a tray with all their dessert offerings and we got the almond canoli because the pile of berries was speaking to me. Excellent, excellent. Great crunch to the canoli, the chocolate mousse filling wasn't too heavy (though it kinda tasted like dark chocolate nutella as the consistency was about the same), berries were very sweet (probably soak in sugar?), and the white sauce wasn't overly sweet.\\n\\nWe also got a \\"pearly white\\" wine flight. Some amazing smelling (fruity) wines that tasted pretty good.\\n\\nOur service was some of the best I've had. I didn't catch our server's name, but he was extremely nice and was just great all around. There was a bit of a wait time in between being seated and seeing our server though.\\n\\nOur ~$90 meal came down to about $50 after my $25 coupon, free appetizer, and free dessert. They even have a promotion right now of a free $20 GC when you buy $100 - we're planning on coming back. They send you offers in the mail all the time if you sign up for their emails.

Went with a group of six for a late Saturday night dinner.  The hostess staff immediately ensured that we had drinks for our short wait (one of the most important things you can do while guests are waiting).  The ability of the hostess to bring drinks to you while you wait (and charge you without you having to go to the bar) is just the right type of delicate touch.\\n\\nAnd when it comes to the food... trust me, this is one of the places that you better come to hungry.  Our server was not only well-versed in the intricacies of each particular dish... but paid attention to what we were drinking and offered suggestions that would pair with our wine or cocktails, accordingly.  He asked all the right questions as to food sensitivities, and there was not a single dish which didn't make us swoon.\\n\\nThe GM Aaron made a point to come out and visit our table, and even sent us some quality bites to nibble on as a compliment to those we had already ordered.

Once we were seated the experience got better. Veronica, our server was fantastic. Helpful, attentive, and friendly. There were 4 of us so she was helpful in recommending dishes and wine. We have been to several tapas places in CA, DC and NYC and the food here was on par with the good ones. The portions are on the small side for sharing with 4 people, basically everyone gets a bite, so 2 of each dish would have been better if you want more than a taste, but that could get very pricey if you want to try a variety of dishes. The food is great, but I just don't get why it has to be priced so high for such a small portion. Maybe they should give more bread and tapenade to fill you up so you don't leave hungry.\\n\\nThe ceviche was delicious, the scallop on top, I could have eaten 5 of those, but only got to eat 1/4 of one. We had the cheese plate and chorizo plate, both were excellent with a unique selection of meats and cheeses. Bravas were crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside and the sauce was good. Olives were overpriced for such a small portion. Braised oxtail was a little chewy, but the mashed potatoes were divine. Beef cannelloni was tasty, but we each had one bite, not enough. Calamari, have had better. They were a little overcooked and not very many. \\n\\nOverall, it was a fun experience. We left satisfied, but not full.

Great food and service."},{"name":"Barrel & Boar - Westerville","address":"8 N State St","city":"Westerville","stars":"3.5","text":"Finding out this location had only been open for 3 days explains a lot. \\nWe had a 5:45 reservation on a Wednesday for 3 adults with a high chair.  The restaurant is in a renovated theater, complete with old fashioned marquee outside.  They clearly spent a lot of time and money renovating the place and it shows.  Its beautiful. A horseshoe of seating surrounding a gorgeous bar area with a huge open kitchen on the far end.\\nWe were seated almost immediately and greeted just as quickly.  Our waiter was charming and put in our 2 year old's food order, chicken strips with fries a fruit cup and a brownie, along with our drink order.  Our soft drinks arrived without my sons milk.  We were assured it was on its way.\\nWe ordered off the restaurant week menu: 2 orders of the \\"poutine\\" and one crab dip along with 2 half racks of ribs and one spicy brisket mac n cheese.  The sides were fries, fries, sausage grits and baked beans.  We also ordered a house salad with bleu cheese dressing.  \\nThe kids meal arrived seconds after we ordered our food, much to our son's glee.  However, sadly, his milk still had not.  We were again assured it was on its way.  It finally arrived just as our aps did.  \\nThe crab dip was a golf ball sized scoop with about 6 crostini.  It was good even though it tasted like it had been made with canned crab.  The \\"poutine\\" (note quotation marks) should have been called potato croquettes with cheese.  It was tasty but it sure as heck wasn't poutine.  The salad was nice with crisp, fresh field greens and what appeared to be deep fried croutons but it was delivered with ranch instead of the bleu cheese that was ordered.  I did not try the baked beans but they looked great and I was assured they were delicious and hearty with big chunks of brisket.\\nThe kids meal was only ok.  The chicken strips were slices of chicken breast, breaded and fried.  If you have ever tried to fry boneless, skinless chicken breast you know how dry it inevitably gets.  The fries were aggressively seasoned to the point where my 2 year old didn't want to eat them.  He made due with the chocolate milk and a pouch of apple sauce from my wife's purse.\\nOur entrees came only minutes after our aps had been dropped, to the point where the staff who delivered them showed visible dismay as to the poor timing.  Nonetheless they jammed all the food onto our table with apologies.  My ribs were smoky and tender.  Not falling-off-the-bone tender but tender enough.  The sauces provided on the table, chipotle, sweet and smoky, Carolina and original were flavorful if oddly thin and liquidy.  The handcut fries were really good, while they were too much for my son, they were just how I like them.  A glass jar containing the sausage grits was disappointingly cold but the house made pickles were crunchy and tart.\\nA cast iron skillet of brisket mac n cheese was dotted with jalapenos and sprinkled with savory brisket.  It was cheesy and delicious but may have been the only dish that was actually served while still hot.  \\nAfter the railroad of food deliveries we were given a long stretch to dig in.  Subsequent lags in beverage refills were disappointing but not unexpected as we watched other tables around us dealing with the same issues.  The manager did stop by to ask us how things were but didn't stay long enough to get anything more than a head nod in response.  We finished our meals, stacked our empty plates and waited.  And waited.  \\nOur desserts finally arrived and we were treated to a delicious bread pudding and one order of snickerdoodles with hot spiced cider. Sadly our sons brownie, like his milk, did not arrive when ours did but was later delivered in a to-go container. The desserts were an adequate punctuation on our meal.  Nothing spectacular but serviceable, but lets be honest, who goes to a BBQ joint for the desserts? \\n We finally requested to-go boxes and our check as it was now almost 7pm.\\nLook, the food tasted great for the most part.

Go inside get the menus from a diff table etc. Bartender told me to come to her when I was ready to order so she didn't have to go far from the bar. Understandable but very unprofessional. Don't cut every server off the floor with 2 service hours left to the night. I took the order for our entire table walked it in to the bartender who took the order from me. We all got late night claws, sauce in the side. Our 4 rounds of water didn't arrive for another 20 min, AFTER the food got to the table. Then our beer came too. But not what we ordered because they don't have bud/ budlight on draft. Odd, but okay. Then I had to go inside and ask for the check. I was over charged on the wings (75c vs 65c Monday night special) on 35 pieces. Should have only been  just over $20 Then I was charged for every sauce which should have already been included. We also ordered a 4$ veggie plate with more plate space than veg. Should have come with ranch and blue cheese, we received 3 blue cheese. So of course I was also charged for the ranch when I went in and asked for ranch. But did we ever receive it? No. So our bill was over $40 for a minimal late night bite and 1 pitcher. Very shocking. We paid more in sauces and \\"add Ons\\" than we did in what we actually ordered. Very disappointing, horrible service.  Not worth going back when there's tons of other places in the lake Mary/ sanford area. I think the late night staff need to be trained in hospitality and stop nickel & diming everyone.

I heard about Oyster's buck a shuck, but was a little reluctant based on some of the mediocre reviews about the lousy service and wait times.  However, now seeing the place for myself you have to expect that.  The bar/restaurant only seats about 15 people, so the trick is to come early, specifically during their 50 cent oyster hour between 3-4 pm (the hours I think change, and they don't always have $.50 oysters).\\n\\nMy cousin got herself half a dozen, and I myself got a dozen.  The oysters on special were Royal Miyagi, which are pretty meaty and a bit buttery, just the way I like it. It worked well with the house ponzu sauce.  We also bought the champagne on special for Thursday, which was only $7.  It complemented the oysters very well.  Total bill was $29 for 18 oysters and 2 glasses of champagne after tax.  The bartender/shucker was very nice and really made it a good experience.\\n\\nSo how do you make your experience at Oyster the best it can be?\\n\\n1. Come early, or just make a reservation.  The place is small, so if you go during the dinner rush, expect to have slower service.  There's only one guy bartending/shucking/serving.  It's the price you get for a small, intimate, trendy place.  I went on a weekday afternoon, but then again I was on vacation.\\n\\n2. Take advantage of the specials.  $.50 oysters, buck a shuck, and the daily drink specials.  That is what makes this place awesome.

It's on the pricier side, so I have only been twice for special occasions (birthday and college graduation), but it is so worth it. The menu changes every month or so (sometimes weekly) because they use fresh local ingredients as much as possible. Reservations are the way to go, and if you don't have one I suggest getting there around the opening time to try and snag a table in the pub area before it fills up.\\n\\nNow for the food, everything I've had has been delicious. The Gruyere biscuits are yummy, though subtle,, the pastas are delicious, and the salads are good too. I don't eat pork, but it's not too difficult to find food there to satisfy that. The only vegan option, however, is to get a salad, which although good, is not always satisfying tor some people. The food is very creative and often includes unusual or unexpected ingredients, so it's best to come in with an open mind. The desserts I've had have all been excellent as well, though I'm not as much of a dessert person and would probably prefer a second appetizer. :) The drinks are very nice as well, I've had both the Umatilla Smash and the Great American Classic and would recommend both highly. I also had a lovely port for dessert, so although the wine list may look short, it's good. They're opening a second restaurant in the area as well, and I'm hoping that it's just as good.\\n\\nThe service has been good each time I've gone, both the waitstaff and hostesses have been pleasant. I especially enjoy how knowledgeable the staff is about the menu and wine list, and that they are willing and able to explain the dishes and give recommendations. I don't know if I'd call them friendly, but they are pleasant and I have no complaints as I don't really expect 'friendly' from these sorts of places. \\n\\nOverall if you're in Orlando and want to try one of the best restaurants and get away from the tourists I'd definitely recommend TRP.

Not sure if the sauce was the issue but the chickpea fries tasted odd and funky. It was a struggle to finish but we still did since we don't waste food. If the chickpea fries were good I would've rated this experience 5/5. The staff were super friendly and polite, and let us stay a bit longer to get to the games portion of our stay.

There are a couple of tables in there, so you could stay and eat if you wanted, but I took mine to go. I ordered the Mixed Kabob plate, the full size, which costs $11.99, but I had a Scoutmob coupon for 50% off. The wait took a little while, probably 15 minutes. I'm okay with waiting that amount of time (I didn't have anywhere I needed to be), but I wonder if you would have to even wait longer if it were really busy (there was only one other guy in there waiting for his food when I went).

Definitely cooked well-done. The rice was tasty, but I thought the hummus could have had a little more flavor.

It first opened in Atlanta in 1974.  The restaurant is located in a small, almost nondescript building on the stretch of Cheshire Bridge Rd. that has several older restaurants (e.g. Nakato, Colonnade).\\n\\nThe restaurant is often busy so reservations are highly recommended.  It's not unusual for walk-in wait times to exceed one hour.  The dining space is small.  It consists of a mixture of booths and tables, placed tightly together to maximize seating capacity.  There's a bar which is commonly packed.  It's decorated with family pictures and framed photos of famous people/celebrities who have visited the restaurant over the years.\\n\\nThis isn't an upscale Italian restaurant.  The atmosphere is casual.  At night, there's an intimate candlelit ambiance.  It's a good spot for a nice dinner, date, birthday, or special occasion.  Like nearby Colonnade, Alfredo's tends to have an older crowd.  You can tell some of the customers have been dining here since the 70s.  There's a charm about it.  Also, dining here reminds me of the movie The Godfather or the show The Sopranos.\\n\\nThe menu consists of appetizers like Caprese salad with fresh mozzarella, roasted peppers and anchovies in olive oil, and stuffed mushrooms.  There are soups, salads, and entrees including several different pasta dishes, veal, sausage, steaks, seafood (seafood pastas, scampi, fish, lobster), chicken, and eggplant Parmesan.  Most appetizers are priced under $9 each and most entrees are priced between $16-25 each.  In addition, compared to other Italian restaurants, the wines are relatively affordable.\\n\\nI've tried several dishes.  They include:\\n\\nAppetizers:\\nEscargota bourgulgnonne\\nFried calamari, fra diavolo sauce\\nFresh melon and prosciutto di parma\\n\\nEntrees:\\nVeal Marsala\\nLinguini, clam sauce\\nRaviolini, pomodoro\\nCapellini al pesto\\nLasagna al forno\\n\\nDesserts:\\nRicotta cheesecake\\nTiramisu\\n\\nAll meals include complimentary plates of tasty, pickled vegetables (carrots, pepperoncini, mixed olives, cauliflower) and a basket of delicious, sliced garlic bread.  In general, the food here is rich -- lots of butter, oil, cream, etc, but that's what makes it taste so good.  Everything is prepared the old-fashioned way.\\n\\nThe escargota (snails) are terrific.  Six snails are served per order.  The escargots are soaked in butter and roasted garlic.  The sauce, while a bit heavy, is delectable.  I like it so much that I even dip the already buttered garlic bread into it (horrible, I know).  The snails themselves are nice and plump.  Alfredo's makes one of the best escargot plates I've had in Georgia.\\n\\nThe fried calamari appetizer is good.  I like that the breading is light and the dish is not too greasy, which can often be a problem with fried calamari.  You can tell the fra diavolo sauce is fresh.  It contains several chunky pieces of tomato.  The sauce is only mildly spicy.\\n\\nThe fresh melon and prosciutto consists of three slices of cantaloupe topped with thin slices of prosciutto.  The cantaloupe slices are already peeled, but come with the shell for presentation.  Not bad if you like prosciutto.  The sweetness of the cantaloupe is a nice offset to the salty/savory of the cured meat.\\n\\nOf all the entrees I've tried, without the doubt, the best-tasting one is the linguini and clam sauce.  It comes with chopped clams, diced onions, and a spicy white wine sauce (by default).  It's spectacular.  Next is probably the lasagna.  Classic recipe: pasta, mozzarella, Parmesan, ricotta cheeses, sauteed ground beef, and tomato sauce.\\n\\nActually, the plain spaghetti and tomato sauce is excellent too.  I had this as a side dish to the veal Marsala.  The veal Marsala is my least favorite of the entrees I've tried.  The Marsala wine sauce seems to be exceptionally bitter to me.  The veal medallions are A-OK, however.  The Marsala also comes with a lot of mushrooms.\\n\\nThe ravioli and pomodoro entree comes with goat cheese ravioli, dill, herbs, chopped tomatoes, artichokes, garlic, basil.  It's good.  The capellini (angel hair pasta) and pesto entree is also good.  It consists of pounded basil, pine nut, butter, garlic sauce, and slices of housemade, sun-dried tomatoes.  The pesto and garlic sauce is thick, creamy, and almost overwhelms the dish.\\n\\nTwo of the restaurants most popular desserts are the ricotta cheesecake and the tiramisu.  I prefer the cheesecake over the tiramisu.  The cheesecake is made with a blend of ricotta cheese, liqueurs, sugar, eggs, chocolate chips, and powdered sugar.  The liqueurs are soaked into the cake, so it has a soggy-like consistency.  The tiramisu is made with lady finger cookies soaked in espresso and liqueurs, mascarpone cheese, cocoa powder.  It's light, fluffy, and airy.\\n\\nService is very good (and sometimes, very Italian).  Some of the staff have worked here for decades.\\n\\nFree parking is located directly outside the building."},{"name":"The One Sushi +","address":"2523 Caldwell Rd NE, Ste 1000","city":"Brookhaven","stars":"4","text":"Came here for their patio, and of course their food.

Then the cashier has to (1) not be busy, (2) notice the slices are ready and (3) remember who ordered what. Not a great system. We also ordered a Sicilian slice to go, and when I got home, it had the correct toppings but was not at all Sicilian. Not sure if their idea of Sicilian is \\"super thin crust\\" or if it was a mistake."},{"name":"Winnie's Oriental Garden","address":"1346 Orange Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"3.5","text":"Winnie's = YUM!

Aviations are kind of tricky, but this one was very nice. It kind of surprised me to see it served on the rocks in an old fashioned glass though, but this was purely cosmetic. My fiancee's sangria was delicious.\\n\\nThe rueben egg rolls were really good and I loved the sauce they came with. I don't even like sauerkraut that much and I didn't mind it here. My favorite part of the meal aside from my drink.\\n\\nMy fiancee asked for honey mustard for her burger and fries. and it seemed like the staff didn't really know if they had any. We eventually were served two kinds. One seemed like standard honey mustard you'd find anywhere, but the other was apparently homemade. As in they took whole grain mustard and mixed it with honey -- it was really good! \\n\\nThe not-so-good points:\\n\\nOur entrees were overall disappointing. My fiancee's burger, she said, was nothing to write home about. My pulled pork tacos were very bland and soggy. Somehow, they could not pull flavor out of pulled pork topped with mango salsa and caramelized onions. It had potential to be a real knockout dish, but the execution was lacking. Salt and pepper would have helped a lot. There was a lot of food here (easily 3-4 tacos' worth) but it doesn't matter much when it's so... mediocre? I feel like I could get better food at the 99 or something.\\n\\nThe tables were wobbly. Not just ours, but others around us -- in fact, the couple next to us moved down a table because theirs was too uneven.\\n\\nI think the staff could use some retraining on customer service. As I said earlier, it took a couple tries to get honey mustard for the table. We were asked at one point if Dijon mustard was okay...there's a big difference between honey mustard and Dijon, the difference being that one is sweet and one isn't. It kind of makes you feel like you're not really being listened to.\\n\\nOverall this place seems like it would be good for drinks and maybe some apps at the bar, not so much for an actual meal.

Everyone knows me there.\\n\\nIt's a buffet, all I can say. I've tried basically almost all the hotpot place out there, and the problem with me is: I eat a lot. So buffet is good. I go to this place whenever I have a chance. It's too bad it's not located near my campus, otherwise I won't go to any other hotpot places.\\n\\nFour tips for spicy/hotpot lovers\\n1. I love spicy hotpot, you can ask for extra spicy soup base if you love spicy food too!\\n2. Ask for fresh cut chili peppers, put it in the dipping sauce if you like spicy stuff.\\n3. Their lunch menu and dinner menu are different, lunch is less expensive, but have fewer options. BUT, sometimes if you know a certain item that is not on the lunch menu, you can still ask for it. Sometimes they will actually bring it to you (if you are able to remember their menu already, like me, you prob have figured this out, lol)\\n4. Friday/Weekend's nights when it's crowded, especially during winter, they will have a 2 hours limit. You need to finish within 2 hours. Someone will come to your table and give you a check and kinda chase you out if you stay there longer than 2 hours. No time limits otherwise\\n\\nReasons I like this place:\\n1. It's a buffet! All you can eat!\\n2. I don't know any other hot pot places offers as much variety of food as they do. Seriously, lots items I've even never tried it in China, but I could find it here.\\n3. The sauce is pretty good actually\\n4. During crowded season, like in the winter, the meat is really fresh. Well you can imagine, since there are lots people eating here daily, they probably have to purchase new meat everyday. I know some other less crowded places, they have food stocked up, sometimes those are not that fresh.\\n5. If you like spicy soup base, challenge them, ask for extra spicy. It can make you sweat like a XXXX. I love spicy food, like really really spicy food, One day I challenged them to put as much spiciness in the soup as possible. The waitress put so much spicy sauce in my soup base, I teared up from smelling it."},{"name":"The Wine Bistro","address":"8231 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"The location is central right on the main strip and easy to get too.

She came over with a pitcher of water and someone clearly said, \\"So we're getting an appetizer, right?\\" ...And that's when the waitress walked away.

The variety of the dishes were all a hit, from the mouth-watering shrimp Po Boy and the skillet Mac and Cheese, though the Mac could use a bit more seasoning.  Creamy blandness doesn't really work, amirite?!  Our waiters were awesome, and even stopped to chat about our organization and the event we were hosting the next morning.\\n\\nOverall a huge success!

It was handed to me at the order counter), and the ladies seemed exasperated when I asked if I could get honey for my tea (I was told honey was available \\"over there\\", nodding toward the area where sugars and Splendas were located).

Some people have a problem with this heavy-handed tactic, but I view it as a win/win situation.  It's like playing drinking games - even if you lose you still get absolutely wasted.

I ordered the steak frites, it was dry, chewy and the fries were cold. My BF ordered the special fish. His entire meal was the size of his fist. He said it was tasteful though.

My group of friends arrived about 20 minutes before they opened, and already, there was a line waiting to get inside. As the restaurant opened, the owner Vikram Vij himself was at the door, greeting every single guest with a \\"Namaste\\"! Despite being a large group of 6, we got in at the first seating and were served appetizers and chai that were brought around even before we started ordering any food. Every item on the menu looked amazing, so I can really only point out the dishes that really stood out to me. We started with a portobello mushroom curry that had an unctious, deep umami flavor. We had a mutton kebab that was one of the most unusual kebabs I've ever had, because it was actually served rare! Delicious! On the main courses side, we got a chicken and cashew curry, the famous lamb popsicles, a spicy goat curry, and (perhaps the least \\"Indian\\" dish) a braised beef in red wine curry. Despite the fact that many of the curries looked like they had a common base, every single one had a unique flavor. If I were forced to pick a favorite dish, I'd have to say the lamb popsicles--the curry was perfectly spiced, and the lamb was so tender and juicy. Of course, everything was served with unlimited helpings of naan and basmati rice. The only items that didn't really stand out to me here were the Mango lassi and the dessert (we got gulab jamun), but everything else was absolutely ridiculously good!

While we were at 88 Tofu, there appeared to be only two servers and one cook, but the service was abysmal - the worst I ever experienced at a restaurant.  \\n\\nA server finally handed menus to us 15 minutes after we arrived.

I ordered the combination seafood/beef tofu soup (#1 on the menu) - mildly spicy (but still spicy enough to make my nose sniffly).  The soup base is infused with a heartier beef flavor than other Korean tofu soups.  Also, there were two mussels, 1 clam, 1 jumbo unpeeled shrimp, and lots of baby shrimps, scallops, some beef, and a pound of tofu in my bowl of soup.  Although it was very warm, the soup was not hot enough to fully cook the raw egg that I deliberately cracked immediately when the soup arrived.  I did not mind, because I like to eat eggs with runny yolks.  I was surprised that I enjoyed this tofu soup more than So Kong Dong's.

Not the same as you would get a legal or capital grill\\nDesert - layered pound cake should be taken off the menu\\n\\nWill say the atmosphere is nice and the service was on par with Capital Grill which is very good.\\n\\nBiggest issue I had was parking.  They said validated parking was $5.  Had to pay $10 to get out of the garage.  No one to be found to give you the validated price.\\n\\nWould have probably given 4 stars if not for the parking.\\n\\nWish the restaurant well and hope they make it"},{"name":"El Patron Mexican Restaurant & Cantina","address":"12167 S Apopka Vineland Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Best Mexican Food I've eating in a long Time.

We ordered Chicken green curry, Pad Thai, Basil Chicken and Tom yum soup. All the food was tasty and fresh made. Green curry was by far the best. I was impressed with the quality of the food which was quite good for take out. The serving size was pretty decent and it didn't take them very long to prepare and pack the food after we ordered it which was a relief.\\nOver all it was a great little find for us and we will be ordering more food from here in the future."},{"name":"Basta","address":"410 NW 21st Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Normally I am not a fan of Italian places which blur the lines between Tuscan & red sauce style food.
