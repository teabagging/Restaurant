We were left to our own devices, so we pretty much took a chance on Rosa Mexicano, a block from the hotel. No tables available for 20 minutes, at the soonest, so we took the little buzzy flashy lighty thing and adjourned to the bar.\\n\\nFirst impressions were good. A really pretty joint. Someone has very good taste. Exceptionally attentive and speedy bartenders. A gratifyingly puckery frozen pomegranate margarita. \\n\\nAbout halfway through our drinks, the reception chick tracked us down and said that the wait was going to be longer than expected. Suitably anesthetized by margaritas, we happily opted to eat at the bar. Surprisingly, a lot of room to spread out there, and we were starved and unwilling to start over somewhere else.\\n\\nOur meals were served up less than 10 minutes after we ordered, even though the joint was jumping. \\n\\nShe ordered the chicken enchiladas, and spent the next 15 to 20 minutes making yummy noises. I ordered the grilled chicken breast skillet style. I have to say: really cute presentation, with tender, juicy chunks of chicken mixed in with melted Chihuahua cheese in a square iron skillet about 4 x 4 inches. Along with the chicken came a demitasse-size cup of white corn, and an equally dainty cup of spicy chorizo chili. In a covered dish, warm blue corn tortillas. \\n\\nMy first impression: Way too small a dish for the money.\\n\\nI was wrong. \\n\\nFirst of all, I think we've gotten so used to servings the size of turkey platters that we forget what a healthy portion size really is. But second, it's the kind of meal you spend time building, and it's fun--spoon corn and chili on tortilla, scoop chicken and melty cheese on top of corn and chili, fold, eat, wipe chili off sleeve. A normal serving size should be roughly the size of a deck of cards, and this dish really, visibly was just that. And thoroughly satisfying, I must say.\\n\\n(As opposed to: Trowel gobs of flavorless fatty food-like substance into wide-open mouth hole, savor nothing, swallow, drive home in a postprandial stupor, experience sudden onset crushing sub-sternal chest pain, lapse into unconsciousness, die.)\\n\\nI wish I had another night.

The candied yams were ok and could have used an extra splash of sugar. \\n\\nMy husband got the BBQ chicken. Again, nothing exactly special about their BBQ sauce. \\n\\nOverall, for a place like BOSTON, this is a great soul food joint. It's an \\"fair\\" type of good. \\n\\nFood is pre-prepared in chaffing dishes. It wasn't a problem for me, but worth mentioning. The place could use some polishing. It seems unfitting in the area that it is in and may thrive in a more densely populated area that's easy to park at. \\n\\nTo the owners, I appreciate your niceness.

I normally try to stay away from anything too fatty or greasy, but I had to try the banh mi taco since that was highly recommended. It was worth every calorie and gram of fat that I put into my body. The braised pork belly was so juicy and tender, and the sriracha mayo made it even tastier. Such an overwhelming explosion of flavors in my mouth.\\n\\nI also tried the bbq brisket slider and fresh cut belgian fries. The bbq slider was not as tasty as the taco, but that's probably because it's tender brisket, not fatty pork belly. I was a bit disappointed that I couldn't taste the peach bbq sauce. I think it might've been overpowered by the hawaiian roll. The fries were pretty tasty as well - just the right amount of grease and crispiness. The bacon ranch dipping sauce made it even better.\\n\\nI'll def visit again when I have a craving for some good pork belly. We got to meet the owner, Eric, who's super nice. He did mention that they will have a more permanent location somewhere on campus that will be open for lunch and dinner. The prices are also pretty reasonable for what you're getting.

If you are looking for a white wine for lighter dishes and fish dishes, try the Sauvignon Blanc, Ehlers Estate, Napa Valley, CA '10. \\n\\nIn terms of food, you really can't go wrong but I recommend at least two of the pasta dishes because they are perfection.

The bartender invited us to try whatever we were interested in before committing to a full glass. I had a great Albarino and Nero D'avola.

The citrus and mint made it bright while the pine nuts added a nice buttery flavor. We followed it with the pork belly and polenta, which was divine. I loved the little celery salad on the plate and the belly was perfectly cooked. We also had the Hazel Dell mushrooms with gorgonzola rather than feta, at the bartender's suggestion. My one complaint was that all of this food was brought out at once. The pacing was just a little off for me. I would have preferred the salad and then the hot dishes after we were finished.\\n\\nNext up was the black seafood risotto. Not my fave. It was pretty under-seasoned and only had a single shrimp and scallop. However, I do applaud them for having such a unique dish on the menu--I haven't seen a squid ink pasta anywhere locally.

I feel like they might be making it with jet fuel because it was STRONG. Drivers beware.\\n\\nOverall, a really nice experience. And a great place to go if you have food allergies.

It was delicious and carrot, apple (optional ginger) was a very common mixture.  I gotta say, here though, the ingredient amounts didn't come out quite right.  I'd say way too much ginger so that it burned the throat a bit and didn't allow you to taste the other flavors.  Hopefully it will be better next time.  Previous visits I have tried sandwiches and smoothies.  I enjoyed the fact that they'd let you make a smoothie out of pretty much any fruit, but gotta say, needs more ice and some fruits don't go that well as smoothies.

I was excited and hungry when I made it out there to order some good grub.  I saw that the reviews on Google were really good, let alone Yelp reviews. The atmosphere of Taj Palace is nice, spacious, and very clean. I was there on Sunday of labor day weekend and right after I got there when it was pretty empty, people started flooding in. You could tell by how the waiter and also the owner were pacing around and it took a long time for me to get a to-go box for my meal. The meal was great, no complaints there. I actually got a little bit extra meat that was not on the menu with my order that I didn't expect. I ordered the mixed tandoori plate coming with tandoori chicken, lamb and shrimp. I also ordered a mango lassi and yum!!!\\n\\nThe hostess was very nice and also the waiter. I had finally received my to go box after a good while when I had to grab the hostess to tell the waiter I needed him. That was the only not so perfect part about the exprience, the waiting very patiently part. Well... that is until I gave the male owner my groupon. He practically scolded me for not giving him the groupon in the very beginning, and was all flustered and told me twice \\"I wish you would have given it to me earlier\\". So I got the point, but I felt like I was in trouble or something, and he was no longer \\"nice\\" to me as I was paying my tab. I asked very politely if I could see where it said I needed to give it to him in advance on the Groupon, but he just took it and said he didn't have time to find it for me.\\n\\nI went home and looked it up, and I found where it says to \\"give to waiter when seated\\". Ok gawd! I am only human and I didn't see that part. You don't have to give me the 3rd degree! He acted as if I fluffed up all the books or something.. Anyway, apparently my action, or mis-action, made a downer of his evening and he was not shy about letting me know.\\n\\nBottom line, I had a very nice experience until I was scolded by the owner about my groupon. I felt he was a bit rude about the whole issue as if I did it on purpose. So, if I were to give the Groupon in the beginning, would I just have been treated more poorly or something? Would I have gotten slower service? \\n\\nI probably wouldn't go there again unless I was in that part of town and starving just because of that experience.

I've been here for Resto Week a while back, which wasn't THE most impressive. But since I've been back, I'll swear by the mushroom risotto (the pea & pancetta risotto isn't bad either). The gorgonzola penne is extremely rich and clearly made from scratch which is great, and tasty. The meatballs are also seasoned well and the perfect size portion to have alongside any pasta. \\n\\n3. I always get a prime window seat. \\n\\nHowever, I do feel obliged to point out that somehow, for whatever reason, I always get the most quiet server in the place. I've noted several times that every other server is more talkative and friendly... maybe I scare him by attempting conversation?

In the morass of chain-style, over the top, overpriced restaurants in this area of town, Cedar's Restaurant was a breath of fresh air. Unique food that was deliciously prepared with care. \\n\\nI had the appetizer of fava beans, garlic, lemon juice and olive oil. The name of this dish is \\"foul\\" which is unfortunate as it may scare off a lot of blockhead American patrons. But this dish was darn tasty. Think of it as a thick soup, served hot, with parsley and seasonings on top. The favas were mostly pureed but still left a bit chunky, and I liked the texture of that a lot.\\n\\nI also tasted the lentil soup which my companion ordered. It was delicious and had an earthy flavor that was rich with cumin. If I were to return, I would definitely order both of these dishes again. \\n\\nFor my main course, I had the Farrouj Musahab, which is a deboned cornish hen marinated in (most likely) yogurt, lemon and other seasonings, then grilled. It was quite good. The marinade gave it a tangy flavor that was mouth watering and it was, as the menu stated \\"grilled to perfection\\". This dish was juicy and not spicy at all for those who try to avoid those things or who may want to feed this to a child. It came with a very tasty and fragrant rice as well as some steamed veggies (broccoli and carrots). This dish was a definite keeper and something I would definitely order again. \\n\\nMy dining partner had a couple of other appetizers instead of a main course, which included: grape leaves stuffed with veggies and rice and the Laban Salad, which was kind of like a yogurt soup with cucumbers, mint and garlic. I did not try either of these but they looked very good and all plates were left clean. In spite of the fact that many/most of the dishes had garlic in them, they did not do what many uninspired restaurants do and load their dishes up with garlic to the point of them being overpowered by it. The use of garlic in these dishes was a lot more nuanced, as it should be IMO.\\n\\nThis place is a breath of fresh air. I would definitely go back and I would definitely recommend it to others. The waitstaff was super friendly and warm. \\n\\nPlease note: if you sit outside, you will be in the smoking section. People will be smoking hookah pipes and cigars. I did not see one cigarette.

First there were Musashino, Sushi Sake, Mikado, and Keniichi just to name a few that satisfied countless sushi enthusiasts in the city over the years. Then new kids on the block such as Uchi, and Tomo have opened up and have definitely upped the ante for the quality of Japanese cuisine in the great city of ATX. Well... enough of this boring history lesson...\\n\\nHere comes Hanabi, a hidden gem located in the Northcross shopping mall. After 20+ visits here, I could tell the whole world how great this restaurant is in every little detail but I think the other 229 reviews for this establishment before me clearly speak for themselves. Instead, I wanted to share with the yelp community about Hanabi's own executive chef, Mr. Dongho Choo, the heart of Hanabi that makes it stand out above the rest.   \\n\\nChef Choo used to be an Italian-French cuisine chef employed by a famous luxury hotel chain in South Korea in his early professional years (the source, my memory, might not be so accurate so don't quote me on this). In search of better opportunities, he moved to U.S. and decided to become a sushi chef for which it was a thriving profession among Korean communities. \\n\\nI met him for the first time when I was working as a floor manager at a Japanese restaurant in Arboretum. He was quiet, reserved, and always smiling. His skill level wasn't the best at the time(with only 3-4 years of apprenticeship as a sushi chef) but he was always developing new dishes and pushed his limits restlessly. His nigiri(fish over rice) pieces were always consistent, well-portioned, and the rolls always looked more presentable compared to other chefs' in the restaurant. Again, during all these busy working hours, he was always observing other chefs, making new creative menu items, keeping his stations clean(as if he has O.C.D.... I think he does), while making new regular customers that came to look for him each time. A few months later, he moved to a different restaurant with a better job offer while I changed my profession altogether. \\n\\nMany years have passed, our paths would cross again when I was helping out a friend to manage another Japanese restaurant on Burnet road on the weekend as part-time floor manager. I thought the restaurant needed a major face lift for its 10+ years old menu so I decided to \\"recruit\\" Chef Choo whom I was still in touch with. Being in charge of the kitchen, instead of sushi bar, he made a major improvements in taste, food quality, using farmer's market-bought ingredients, and also in presentation by using micro greens, flowers and house-made puree sauces to bring out colors and nature into his plating. Many of his beautiful creations still remain to satiate many customers there.   \\n\\nFinally, he found his calling when he became the executive chef at Hanabi. It took many months but many of foodies living in Austin started to take notice how great this place actually was. Their happy hour menu is very competitive while portions not being compromised. Their weekly-updated Tsukiji Fish Market specials are so dynamic and hard-to-find which just might keep up with specials at Kome, Tomo, or Uchiko.\\n\\nA few recommendations: \\n1) Anago nigiri - Baked sea eel drizzled with house-made miso sauce is to die for\\n\\n2) Ahi-Tuna Tower - I think originated from Blue Fish in Dallas, Chef Choo really perfected the ingredients and sauces for this dish\\n\\n3) Madai sashimi - Quite similar to what you would get from Uchiko except... bigger! \\n\\n4) Omakase Option - If you don't know much about sushi and want to impress someone on your date? This is it: daily special chef choice course meals. You will get the off-the-menu special dish which is designed by Chef Choo daily.  \\n\\n5) Daily special sushi combination - Chef Choo selects 4-5pcs of daily special nigiri for an appetizer combination for who want to taste the freshness flown from Tsukiji market straight from Japan and other parts of the world. Highly recommended if you want a bang for your buck. \\n\\nIn closing, when I crave sushi, my go-to place to call it my \\"3rd home\\" is at Hanabi (my 2nd home is my work) because of their super fresh sushi, a great management that really cares about their customers, and above all, chef Choo who always greets me with a big smile on his face. What I don't understand is why he's not on \\"Top Chef\\" competition already, and why he's not on the cover of some cooking magazine. Well... perhaps his time to shine will come very soon... until then... I will be rooting for you, chef CHOOOOO!!!"},{"name":"Go Chi","address":"390 Main St","city":"Malden","stars":"3.5","text":"It's bad Taste and experiment in this restaurant.

And I don't care if it's Portland, I am selfish with food, give me a decent amount for my money. \\nI will likely suck it up as I want to try some other things on their menu and they are on my way to the Max transit to go home, therefore, getting cake on the way home  - to take home - is a definite must."},{"name":"HunnyMilk","address":"40 NE 28th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"My brother and I went here for brunch, Sunday!

We made reservations in advance for our party of eleven. Actually, we made them for nine, and showed up with eleven - and I'm glad we did!\\n\\nThey have a special \\"passport\\" deal for parties of ten or more, where you pay a flat fee per person, and they regale you with samples of all the best the kitchen has to offer.\\n\\nFirst, upon walking in, I'd have to describe the environment as warm, inviting, and cozy. The host made us feel sincerely welcome - truly hospitable, not like the forced fake-smile of a chain restaurant.\\n\\nAs you're seated, It feels more like you're visiting family friends, with a hint of being at a tropical resort. The tables are low, so the feeling is more that you are sitting in a group of friends, rather than feeling separated from them across a huge western-style table.\\n\\nThere is an aroma, immediately upon walking in, not just of the food cooking, but very tasteful spices or incense. I normally loathe incense, scented candles, or that sort of thing, but this really enhanced the atmosphere.\\n\\nThere are quite a few beverage selections, including a decent wine list - and the honey wines were well-received. Next time, I'll definitely want to try the traditionally-served ethiopian coffee, but this time, since our party was so large, I went with a positively excellent spiced tea. Hot tea was served in really cute individual teapots that kept the tea warm throughout the meal.\\n\\nA sipped a little of a friend's mango juice - normally that sort of thing is sickeningly sweet, but this was superb and refreshing.\\n\\nWe ordered the combination passport, containing both vegetarian items and carnivore food.\\n\\nAnd oh the food!\\n\\nIt's hard for me to even pick out a single item as my favorite. Everything was so incredibly good that it just blended together in my brain, until I could hardly speak.\\n\\nThe injera - the heart and soul of Ethiopian food, was amazing. I think I could have eaten myself silly on the bread alone. Whenever we ran low, a server would appear, as if by magic, with more.\\n\\nForgive me for not naming the individual dishes - I was so overcome with eating that I didn't, at the time, make note. \\n\\nThe veggies:\\n\\nThere were several lentil dishes - and even though I normally dislike green lentils, I kept going back for more of theirs! There was a shredded carrot dish that I think I ate most of. The beet dish was not only tasty, it was surprising and unusual - the texture of the beets was more like a sweet potato. I also consumed large quantities of a sweet squash, which was so good, I dreamed about squash that night! Finally, there was a nice salad in the center, which included little slices of sweet lemons.\\n\\nThe meats:\\n\\nI can't say which of these I enjoyed more - there was a superior lamb dish, similar to a curry, spiced and cooked to perfection. There was a large fillet of fish, cooked so that it was seared almost crispy on the outside, while tender and juicy within. There was a dish containing tiny cubes of chicken, spices, onions - also wonderful.  There was a beef dish as well, that was beyond amazing.\\n\\nThe friend whose birthday it was asked for, and got, a small order of kitfo. This is a spicy dish made with raw beef, and ordinarily, you must let them know a day in advance that you wish to have some. Theirs was sublime. A lot of places won't serve it, or will only serve it to people they have gotten to know, because often, Americans will order it, then get creeped out by it being raw. I'm sure not! It's delicious!\\n\\nFor dessert, there was coconut ice cream on the outside of the dish, and in the middle, a dense chocolate covered tart. the whole thing was covered with a perfect sauce made from fresh raspberries. Everyone raved about the ice cream especially. For me, I think it had to be the finest dessert I've had. Five-star restaurants would be lucky to produce that sauce alone!\\n\\nThe staff were very attentive without being intrusive, and our host came by several times to see that we were happy and enjoying everything.\\n\\nThis is definitely food to enjoy with friends and family. There is something incredibly visceral, extremely intimate, eating with one's hands, from the same dish as everyone else. It really makes everyone feel very connected, and I found myself paying close attention not just to what I was enjoying, but what everyone else was.\\n\\nNot only was it fun, and beyond delicious, there was something both earthy and spiritual about eating this way.\\n\\nAt the end of the meal, I felt, quite literally, intoxicated. I'm not sure I could have driven home, and I didn't drink!\\n\\nIt's strange to find myself saying such a thing, but here it goes - and I told our host and anyone else who would listen, this:\\n\\nRas Kassa's not only fed me the best Ethiopian meal I've ever had, they may very well have fed me the best _meal_ I've ever eaten. I've eaten a lot of amazing food, but never have I been moved as much as I was by Ras Kassa's."},{"name":"Tamo Bistro & Bar","address":"1 Seaport Ln","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Amazing, amazing.

Now after working in the service industry for about 7 years I just figured these people had been here before us, put their name on the list, and left for a bit. After about 5 tables were sat before us we started to get antsy. Finally we went to ask how much longer and the hostess told us they had been texting us for awhile. We never received a text. And even then we sat right in front of the host stand so they had to have been completely oblivious. Once we were finally sat, and our server came to greet us, she hands us their already extremely limited menu to find out they were out of about half of their current offerings.

Either they've just flat out changed the recipe or they have new cooks or something. The cheese is DRY and flavorless, dry like parmesan cheese on cheese bread in the grocer's freezer aisle.

I'll try to break it down to simplify things:\\n\\nMy daughter got the salmon teriyaki while my son got the chicken teriyaki. Both was delicious. It was a nice size salmon which I wasn't expecting since some restaurants are pretty stingy with their portions. The chicken teriyaki was a decent portion & pretty moist. They were served on a bed of grilled veggies on a hot plate. Rice was on the side. Their house made teriyaki sauce was VERY tasty. Not too salty, but not too sweet. \\n\\nI got the miso ramen with added bok choy. The proportions were perfect for me. Just the right amount of noodles which was cooked perfect. A bit al dente which is how I like it. The pork was a tad dry but they gave a good amount. The egg was very tasty as well. I think the broth could have used a little more flavor but I just sprinkled a little of the salt rock they gave to my husband & it was just right. \\n\\nMy husband had a few of he items on the skewers: ribeye, pork belly & chicken wings. I didn't taste them myself, but he enjoyed the beef & pork. He said the chicken was ok. \\n\\nI guess the only criticism I have was their salad. It was served in a bowl that resembled a cup & when my daughter tried to mix the dressing the lettuce would spill over. At the bottom of the cup was some water. The dressing was interesting though. \\n\\nAlso their tea is just a tazi tea bag with hot water in case you're expecting the traditional teapot with loose leaf. \\n\\nWe also got to try their green tea mochi ice cream on a bed of whipped cream, drizzled with chocolate. HEAVEN!!! That's all. \\n\\nLast but not least, I was very happy with their service. Eunice, our server, was extremely friendly & always helpful.

It was not busy. We asked to sit outside and there were two servers outside and three tables. It took awhile for a server to come over. They didn't bring any chips until we asked them. They did bring our beer rather quickly, however. They didn't give my child any crayons (but a coloring page, which confused me). We ordered from a price fixe menu - app, entree, and dessert. The server asked me if I liked my food spicy, and I told her absolutely not, as I am breast feeding (the baby was right there). I ordered my entree, specified not-hot. When she dropped off my appetizer she looked me in face and told me I'd hate it bc it was super spicy. I mean, I couldn't even eat it. Why wouldn't you tell me that when I ordered??? Entree was fine until two minutes after it was delivered, she brought our dessert bc she \\"could tell we wanted to get out of there since we had the kid.\\" Ummmm no.

I had been talking about it for weeks with a friend of mine, and then she went and her review of it was that it was amazing!\\n\\nSo I was really looking forward to dinner there last night especially given that my dining partner isn't usually up for anything other than bar food. \\n\\nI wouldn't normally mention this, but we were both wearing jeans and t-shirts when we arrived. I had just worked out and showered and threw on something comfortable. I am not sure, obviously, that this was the case, but it seemed like the second our waiter saw us he had made up his mind that we weren't going to be monetarily beneficial to him, and thus, didn't deserve quality service. \\n\\nWe ordered (after he read the specials off of a piece of paper in a really awkward manner) the duck fat fries, the Brussels sprouts, and the charcuterie board. \\n\\nThe fries were good, crunchy, not as good as Hopdoddy's. And the egg wasn't as unusual as it sounds, but I can't say that it added much to the dish. The hollandaise was lacking.\\n\\nThe Brussels sprouts were the star of the meal. I scarfed them, and I was glad my friend didn't want any. \\n\\nI really should have asked/read (I don't recall it saying on the menu) what was on the charcuterie board before we ordered it, but I had read good things about it so I just ordered it. \\n\\nThe board had two cheeses (blue and \\"cream\\"), some nuts, a couple of different pates, some pastrami, a little cube of salmon, a horseraddish/lemon dipping sauce, house-made pickles, pickled onions and radishes. I'm not a fan of pate so there went two of the choices. The pickles (three little slices) were delicious. It's not easy to make a tasty homemade pickle. The biggest problem I had with the order, though, was that someone other than our waiter dropped it off, and he didn't describe any of what was on the board. I flagged down our waiter since he didn't see a need to come over to our table to make sure everything was satisfactory or to see if we needed anything else. \\n\\nThis is where things got strange. Our waiter was so loud every time he talked to us. So I asked him to tell us what each thing was on the board, and he very quickly went over it (I don't think he even knew what he was saying....he said what I thought was Brie was cream cheese...). Then he pointed at the other two dishes and very loudly said \\"and those are Brussels sprouts and those are fries\\". Ok, wow....\\n\\nHe didn't come back to our table to check on anything until we had empty plates (thank God people are walking around so my water glass stayed filled up.), my friend's beer glass was empty, and I had scooted my stool back up against the wall so I could relax.  He took the empty plates and didn't ask if we wanted anything else...so I assumed he knew we were ready for the check. Well, 10-15 minutes later he finally came around with it. He never offered my friend a glass or water or anything while we waited. He just really rubbed me the wrong way. \\n\\nI hate to assume that we were treated differently because we're young, were under dressed, and my friend has an unkempt beard and long, hippie hair, but I am not sure what else to think after our experience. As our waiter walked off the last time he yelled, in our general direction, \\"Thanks for coming in! Hope to see you again soon!\\" \\n\\nIn short, the food was good and the service was...weird. I'm not counting this place out just yet, but I very rarely get the urge to spend $5 on Brussels sprouts...so it might be a while before I return."},{"name":"SuSu Sushi","address":"408 Washington St","city":"Stoughton","stars":"3.5","text":"Better than buffet style all-you-can-inhale, the selection is huge, quality is good (especially for the price).

You have seen all this before.\\n\\nBut the execution is very good.\\n\\nThe following two lines may sound cutesy - but they sum up Amaya's perfectly.\\n\\n\\n1) Anything with cheese at Amaya's is really good.\\n\\n2) Nearly everything has cheese.\\n\\n\\nWhat makes this actually useful is that Amaya does two things really well - and cheese is essential to both.\\n\\nThey make some of the lightest most refreshing and yet totally filling tacos in town.\\n\\nThe tacos come with vast quantities of iceberg lettuce and a not vast but quite generous sprinkling of a very light refreshing creamy grated cheese. The ingredients underneath are the solid stuff of basic Tex-Mex. The result is a very different kind of taco that actually tastes and feels airy - but you still get the flavor and substance of the core carne asada or beans or whatever yout got on the inside.\\n\\nThey can also use the cheese for a totally rich and full bodied effect. Their enchiladas are among the most savory in town with a deep and totally satisfying gravy. The cheese on top is actually integral to the taste of the gravy ...\\n\\nand in my personal opinion, the cheese enchiladas are the best of the lot because the cheese effect gets maxed out.\\n\\n(I have not noticed this at other tex-mex places.)\\n\\nSo at Amaya's cheese really does make everything good.\\n\\n\\nIt is also an interesting place to hang out.\\n\\nAmaya's is on I-35 which puts it right on the spine of Austin and the borderline between rich West Austin and poor East Austin - along with Mueller a rich part of East Austin - and Saint Johns a poor part of West Austin. \\n\\nSo Amaya's is near everybody - and everybody shows up. \\n\\nYou see rich people, poor people, glamorous people, struggling people, family groups, people just off work, people of every ethnic description you can think of ...\\n\\nMost restaurants in Austin have a \\"turf\\" a \\"home crowd\\" or a feel that is associated with one set of customers.\\n\\nAmaya's is one of the few places I know that really belongs to everybody ...\\n\\nand this is a huge plus.\\n\\nOne minor note.\\n\\nIf you go there for the music - you won't get much of it. Johnny Gonzales has  a regular gig there - and he is a good singer who backs himself up on keyboards and electronic \\"smooth strings\\" and \\"smooth sounds\\". He's got a good act  and sings interesting stuff - but you never get more than one or two songs out of him before he disappears off into the back and doesn't show up again for forty five minutes.\\n\\nGo to Amaya's for the food and the crowd - but get your entertainment elsewhere."},{"name":"Gladys Knight's Signature Chicken & Waffles","address":"529 Peachtree St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"This used to be an amazing experience for Atlanta tourists.

This isn't your typical Mexican food, it's upscale Mexican food.  Chips and salsa are replaced with complimentary bread with three different unique dips (my fave was the orange butter).

You can taste the difference in the hamburger and can tell the patty was definitely not store bought by its shape.  The egg added a nice touch reminding me of a bi bim bap.\\n\\nThe regular sized, original beer battered house fries ($4) come with a free dipping sauce.  I took the cashiers recommendation and went with ranch.  The ranch sauce is probably one of the best I've ever had.  Packed with chives and just the right consistency (not too watery or too thick).  The regular sized fries was GIGANTIC and took up 2/3 of the metal baking pan.  I shared a good amount of fries with a nearby stranger and I still couldn't finish.

I've been here a few times. I always get the waffle, some fried chicken and mac and cheese. The mac and cheese here is THE BOMB! I think it's the best I've ever had in my life. Yes, it's that good. The waffles are good but I'm gonna keep the Roscoe's vs. Gladys theme going here and give it up to Roscoe's because they give you a nice little dollop of butter with your waffle, opposed to Gladys where they give you one little tiny butter package and you have to ask for more. The chicken here is pretty good, probably some of the best you can find in a restaurant (best I've had was homemade so you can't compare to that...). The corn muffins are delicious as well! \\n\\nI have found a few mom and pop type places in Atlanta that have better food than here, but come here if you're looking for pretty good food with a nice atmosphere to enjoy a meal. Most of the tables are booths, they play r&b music in the background and the staff are friendly and presentable. It's definitely a good place to start out if you're new to the South or new to soul food. I brought my family from California here who usually don't eat soul food and they LOVED it. They loved the food and they really felt like they were in Atlanta when they came here. I love that it's open until the early morning on weekends so when you want better food than Waffle House after you leave the club, come to Gladys Knight!\\n\\nTo sum it up, it's a pretty good place to try out. It is not the best in the world, but definitely a place you should try out in Atlanta. And don't forget to order the mac and cheese!!!"},{"name":"Midwest Grill Brazilian BBQ","address":"1124 Cambridge St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3","text":"Think this is the name of a Chicago chophouse?

I would have loved a glass of wine with my dinner, but was never asked if I would like anything....fast forward about 6 minutes..the sushi chef tries to reach out and hands me my sushi. Never once did a server come over to ask me if everything was good, if I would like anything else, or even fill my water glass. About 7 minutes after I put my chopsticks on my plate indicating I was done, the sushi chef again looks at me and asked if everything was ok. I proceeded to tell him it was fine, but I was waiting on my server to ask for a box and my check. Again, he had to yell to someone (a third person, not the one to lay menus or ring my food in) who gave me a check and boxed my food. I didn't even bother to order dinner to go for my family as I had planned on doing. Top 5 worst dining experience I've had, server wise. The food was mediocre. Waste of an hour of my time and $20+.

The place itself was two floors, oozing with charm and service was excellent both times.  The waitress who served us has been with this established from the day they opened their doors 24 years ago!  Though there is often a wait (due to the popularity of this place), we never waited too long and knowing how mouth-wateringly delicious the food is, IT IS WORTH THE WAIT.  In terms of the dishes we ordered, the Margherita pizza was arguably the best I have ever tasted (and I have had my share of pizzas).  The lasagna was the size of a meatloaf pan, bursting with beautiful flavors of freshness and simplicity.  The pasta calabrese, tomato sauce cooked down with italian peppers and fresh sausage almost made me cry with happiness.  The pesto pasta ridiculously flavorful and plentiful.

I was waiting for her to come back and actually wipe the table down or something, since there were very visible crumbs and dirt left, but that never happened. I eventually just wiped it down myself with my napkin and a bit of water. The menu is a bit limited. It sure has interesting choices. Most in our party ordered the burger, one the grilled cheese, and I ordered the rabbit and dumplings. The burgers and grilled cheese were pretty good. The fries were waaaay too salty for our tastes. My boyfriend asked for mustard, but I guess they only have Dijon mustard, as that's what he received and was quite upset he wasn't informed it was Dijon upon requesting/getting it, since he spread it on his burger assuming it was normal mustard.

First, we have relocated to Washington, DC and haven;t lived in New England for over 2 years, so when it comes to the ocean delicacies of the Northeast, we're deprived.  The lobster roll was phenomenal.  It was huge!  I would bargain it was about twice the size of your traditional JJ Nissen New England style hot dog roll.  The thing was loaded with lobster meat.  I washed down this treat with the strawberry iced tea.  My craving for more seafood was fed and I was a happy camper.  The potato skins we split were ok.

Well, not only is the food not good (the menudo is a freaking joke!!!) , but I am positive that the guys in the kitchen cooking up your \\"generous portions\\" of food are in constant violation of health department regulations. Go in there and just sit and look around, notice all the clutter in part of the restaurant that was once a drive through (I am sure there are some insects lurking around in all that mess). Every once in a while a cook will come out of the kitchen and when he does try and get a glimpse back there and if that doesn't send you running out of the restaurant, the service will. The waitresses are disorganized, they don't stick to a certain section of the restaurant, so you might have one waitress one minute and a different one the next. When you go in, seat yourself. You will NOT be greeted or asked how many people in your party you won't get talked to at all until your butt is in a seat or you walk up to the cashier and tell her that you want to place an order for take out. And when your done eating don't expect a check, they won't bring you one, you are expected to walk up to the cashier and tell them what table you were in and they will find your check and ring you up. I think English lessons and customer service training are in order. I seriously can't understand how the health department hasn't shut this place down. You can get better service and better tasting food somewhere else. Don't waste your time and don't risk your health eating here!"},{"name":"Flying Biscuit Caf√©","address":"3280 Peachtree Rd NE, Ste 145","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"The grits were creamy and amazing!

We started off with a perfect bottle of Nero D'Avola that complimented each part of our meal, delicious and went down perfectly.\\n\\nWe ordered the Ahi Tuna and Seared Scallop appetizers to begin and each were unreal. The tuna was perfectly rare and served on top of a delicate potato and finished off with a crushed jalape√±o, giving it a kick of spice to balance with the freshness of the tuna. The scallops were perfectly edible and flavorful - I hate when scallops are too chewy or gamy tasting but these were neither of those. They were perfect and served on top of delicious wild mushrooms. Complimentary of chef Damiano, we were served the saut√©ed shrimp. The shrimp came in the pan it was made, promising all of the flavor cooked into including a lemon and olive oil sauce that was the perfect proportion of zesty to buttery. I had seen on the menu earlier that it was topped with \\"razor-sliced garlic\\" - they were not kidding. The garlic was so thin that my mouth didn't even have to chew it, it simply melted and blended with all of the flavor from the shrimp and its sauce. It was a wonderful surprise and I can't wait to come back for it! Also, I am not a big bread dunker, but I needed to order extra bread just for this sauce after the shrimp was finished - that is how good it was.\\n\\nFinally, for our entrees, I ordered the Rolatti and my sister ordered the Sunday Macaroni. Damien generously brought them out one at a time so we could split each entree family-style. First came out the Rolatti which was exactly what I was hoping for - pasta rolled perfectly around spinach, fontina & prosciutto, my three favorite foods in the world! The sauce was flavorful and found in every bite of each ingredient. Two rolls for each of us were the perfect amount leaving some room for the Macaroni. Now, I am a Sunday Gravy snob, as my mother makes it every day and I was raised proud to say that I'll only eat my mother's meatballs. Damien's was unbelievable - the meatballs were so tender and the sauce was found in every crevice. The beef rib literally fell off the bone and the fork fell into the sausage when I went to cut it in half. On top of the pasta, it was a deadly combination. This was the first time I have ever had a Sunday Gravy outside of my own home and I cannot wait to have it again. It was absolutely amazing and didn't even need any added parmesan cheese, pepper, or anything.\\n\\nOverall, our meal was cooked to perfection and makes me so excited to come back and try everything else I can on the menu, no matter how many visits it takes.

He was born in the USA close to a century ago and was the first in his family who did not marry someone from Lebanon. His widowed mother and grandmother did not mind that he was marrying an English woman, but they insisted that Mom learn how to cook Middle Eastern food--and especially Lebanese food--before the wedding day. Suffice it to say that I grew up eating a fair amount of Lebanese fair, especially raw kibbeh but also a lot of other things. The things that Mom did not make, I discovered in my youth at the Middle East in Cambridge, MA. I think I know this cuisine. \\n\\nI have visited Cedar's on several occasions since they opened and I have enjoyed each visit. The service is attentive, the ambiance is warm and Mediterranean and the food is good. Good, tasty and enjoyable--but not great. \\n\\nOn my most recent visit, I took an old friend to lunch. When we arrived, we were quickly seated, as the restaurant had just opened. The waiter was attentive and made sure that our basket of pitas (Lebanese Bread as I grew up calling it) was always full. He was very service oriented and did not try to engage in conversation. I appreciated that because I had not seen my friend in close to a decade and we had a lot of catching up to do. \\n\\nBoth my friend and I are vegetarians so we both ordered the vegetarian platter. Baba ganoush, tabbouleh, hummus, and falafel were featured and each had its own appeal. The baba was clearly the stand out selection. Smoky and perfectly blended to a wonderful consistency, it alone was a five star selection. The tabbouleh was a traditional tabbouleh that emphasized parsley. It was good but I prefer a tabbouleh that emphasizes bulghar wheat as the main ingredient. Cedar's version was good but too light for my particular taste. Like the tabbouleh, the hummus was well prepared but I found it a bit lacking in flavor. More tahini would have gone a long way to enhance the flavor. The falafel was the weakest part of the platter. There was nothing horrible about it but there was nothing remarkable either. \\n\\nAdmittedly, I carry a personal bias when it comes to Lebanese food so I may have been unduly critical of Cedar's. Please don't get the wrong impression. Cedar's is a good restaurant and one that I will visit again. It may not be the Middle Eastern food that Mom still makes, but it is still a fun place to enjoy a good meal."},{"name":"Golden Delight Bakery","address":"246 Lincoln Cir","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"\\"A Gahanna favorite\\"\\n\\"Golden Deliciousness\\" \\n\\"Japanese-style cake\\"\\nAll things I have heard in reference to their best-selling cake. \\nWith its golden layers of yummy dessert, this baby packs ALL the gluten and sugar that even the sweetest tooth could crave. \\nService is fast and friendly- you walk in, and whomever is behind the counter will flash you a smile like \\"Come on.

Now I have an egg allergy, so I inquired about a lunch or dinner menu that may have more options.

The only minor issues were my companion found a small piece of lobster shell in her food & our waitress, although a sweetheart, was a little OVER attentive. She only had three tables including ours and was so ahead of the game that she was a bit too social with us. She probably stopped @our table every 10 mins (at least) to confirm that we were enjoying ourselves. It was a minor annoyance for me, much more so for my companion.

The burger was extremely delicious, better than many meat-based burgers that I have ordered from reputable restaurants. In fact, if you are still new to vegetarian food like myself, this is an entirely unique flavor experience. It was clear that the burger  was not trying to mimic a meat flavor, but instead glorified the individual ingredients to create something truly indulgent.\\n\\nThe Atmosphere: (Average)\\nThe restaurant was clean and inviting, with just the right amount of lighting and noise level to hold a conversation. It choice of decor was slightly confusion, however. The decor is very \\"nifty fifties\\" or \\"johnny rockets\\", but the name of the restaurant and the waiting staff did not seem committed to that identity.

I didn't read any reviews before going and had no idea what kind of food would be served. Once I read the menu, I realized that this restaurant is not suitable for families with children who can't eat spicy food. Almost 80% of the food are heavily spiced, and the noodles in soup that are not spicy are in lamb broth which most kids won't like. We ended up ordering white rice, yam chips and codfish in black bean sauce with special instruction not to make it spicy at all.\\n\\nThe skewers are relatively pricey and you have to order at least 5 per item. So we ordered the lamb special and the beef. When the skewers came, they were covered in spices and you cannot tell apart the taste of beef or lamb since they had so much spices on them. The meats are of low quality, very chewy and dry. IMO they are the worst skewers. The only way to tell the beef and lamb apart is that the lamb skewers were even harder to chew due to the hard fibers in them. After trying these skewers, I feel that the pricing was very unreasonable for such low quality meat and taste.\\n\\nWhen the codfish came on a hot plate with massive amount of black bean covering the whole fish, I noticed the little amounts of luncheon meat, quail eggs, and noodles we ordered extra, each item was charged quite a lot for such cheap food and little quantities. We were told to wait till the dish boiled before eating, however, upon boiling, the sauce became extremely salty because of the black bean and the noodles became unedible since it had absorbed the sauce.\\n\\nWe ordered a jug of fresh squeezed orange juice to go with all these meat. But when I tasted it, it was 30% juice, and 70% water plus sugar. It tasted nothing like fresh squeezed orange juice! So I asked the waitress about it and I saw a woman not wearing uniform and I assumed she was the \\"boss lady\\". They charged $9 for a small jug. Boss lady explained to me that their machine cannot squeeze enough juice out of the oranges and they are only charging $9, so they can't be 100% real juice. Maybe it's just me, I have been to many restaurants, wherever I went and ordered freshly squeezed orange juice, I had received one. I felt cheated when they said it's freshly squeezed, but it tasted worse and less \\"orangey\\" than the orange juice you get from supermarkets. So at the end, we returned that orange juice and stuck with water. \\n\\nIf I were to have one nice thing to say about this place is the waitress was still smiling and providing service after my complaint about the orange juice.

While all dishes were well executed,  I'm not sure if there's any one that had enough memorability for me to come back.  Interesting cocktail menu--herbaceous, fruity blends so if you're looking for multidimensional alcoholic drinks come here and check them out. \\nThere's no online menu so I will try my best to pull from memory what was ordered.  Went with some pals here for dinner. \\n\\nFood:  \\n\\nPlates to Share: \\n\\nFrench Fries: Fried in duck fat and topped with two perfectly poached eggs.  I loved the idea of the eggs accompanying the fries--the whites were solid without being overly firm and the yolk was silky and thick enough to dip the french fries into like ketchup.  Fries were well seasoned.  I'm not sure about presentation--I love places that stand the fries up in a funnel type cup so that they don't get soggy from laying on top of each other--unfortunately they were placed in a wide deep bowl.  The texture of the fries were thick cut and slightly crisp when they first arrived and eventually got a touch soft.  \\n\\nChicken Liver Mousse: Served in a darling mason jar.   A sweet apple gelee was on top of the liver and served with pickled onions on the side and crisp crackers.  I couldn't help myself and ate the entire jar (eventually forgoing spreading it on the cracker and eating the liver with a bit of apple on top and a pickled onion on a spoon).  Creamy rich liver with sweet apple on top and cut by the tart onions. \\n\\nBrussel Sprouts: Man this is a popular dish to serve at restaurants nowadays. This was executed well--crisp exterior, tender interior with micro shavings of parmesan and golden raisins. Sweet and savory, done well. \\n\\nCharcuterie:  There was a coffee rubbed cheese and blue cheese that I didn't particularly care for.  The only thing that was really special on the plate was the Pastrami Salmon.  It was rubbed with a crust of delicious black pepper and other things--wish we had just ordered that instead of the charcuterie! \\n\\nMain: \\n\\nDuck breast:  Duck breast with a slightly crisp skin and served with an orange sauce.  I thought this was pretty decent.  It was tender and cooked well. \\n\\nDessert: Salted caramel pudding with creme fraiche on top.  The creme fraiche by itself was REALLY salty, but when eaten with the pudding it was fine--just a warning.  Could possibly balance that by instead of the creme fraiche being a large dollop on top by spreading it evently so that when you dip into the pudding you get just a little bit of creme fraiche.   The pudding and caramel itself was lovely, just might lighten the hand on the salt with the creme fraiche. \\n\\nCocktails: \\n\\nThere was a cocktail with blueberries, thyme and lemon--I don't remember the name but it was lovely and refreshing. \\n\\nAlso checkout the tamarind, lime cocktail if you can.  I loved the balance of herbs, sweet sour and tart.  Great! \\n\\nAtmosphere and Service:  Service was friendly and atmosphere is sort of this classic farmhouse appeal.  Love the paintings of the pigs--\\"Pigs of the Apocalypse\\" as my friends and I named them.  Couldn't find pestilence anywhere though.   We sat inside and loved that there's a window to look inside the kitchen.   While I think the price was on point, and the dishes were all good the only things I'd come back for would be the pastrami salmon and the cocktails.

If you are looking for a huge space with TV screens and \\"Infusion\\" food piled high, this is not the place.  My husband and I are \\"foodies\\" and have lived in Boston one year.  We were exploring the Beacon Hill area yesterday evening, and stumbled upon this French Restaurant, as it had an \\"Outdoor Patio Open\\" sign in the front - we were in the mood for a relaxing outdoor meal.\\n\\nWe were warmly welcomed by the host, and quickly ushered outside to the intimate courtyard.  Truly breathtaking!  Historic brick walls, plants hanging all around, vines, white linens, candlelight, a sumptuous yet relaxing atmosphere.  Our host suggested the Sangria and the Champagne Cocktail - both heavenly.  I ordered the lamb entree, as I suspected they would know how to make a fine lamb.  (I've had lamb at many places which was either too dry, or too bloody, too peppery, too slippery, etc.)  It was truly one of the finest dishes I've had in months.  Cooked to perfection - temperature, texture, flavor, appearance... first rate!  The vegetables were delicious, again perfect texture and flavor in a traditional approach.  The sauce was light, savory, and complex.  There was a hint of bleu cheese - not too much or too little, just enough to compliment the array of flavors.  It was a dish I had to eat slowly - to savor each bite.  My husband had the salmon, and he was equally amazed.  \\n\\nHaving traveled throughout Europe, and lived three years in Germany and a summer in France, we are already solid fans of a range of European styles.  This was a little difficult to define - traditional cooking in a very romantic setting with creative decor.  Bistro?  Certainly without any pretense.  Our host was delightful - he kept us laughing and shared jokes with some of the tables, yet he was not intrusive.  Next time we will indeed allow three hours to fully enjoy each course properly.\\n\\nThe price - if you want to pay $20 or less for an entree this is not the place for dinner.  (Try them at lunch).  The range is $29 - $39.  Considering you are in Beacon Hill, Boston A-list restaurant prices in general, the artful/experienced preparation, outstanding service, beautiful historic interior and exterior, and romantic ambiance, $32 for an entree is not extreme.  At Hungry I one pays for the entire experience, which is well-worth the price in my estimation.  \\n\\nBlock out three hours, bring your loved ones and an open mind, relax in their historic, quiet and elegant outdoor courtyard, and be taken back in time.  You will not regret the investment.

Thank the Flying Spaghetti Monster that we decided on this one.\\n\\nThe warm rolls and olive oil are great. Do not eat them. Try your hardest to avoid them. Everything else is so crazy good that you must use every ounce of your gastronomical willpower to avoid the bread (even though it is really good).\\n\\nMeatballs app rocked. Nothing particularly unique. Very classic. Very, very good.\\n\\nCaprese Risotto app was great and I have never had anything like it before. Lots of gooey mozz balls hanging around.\\n\\nCalimari was a last min addition to the apps and probably my fav. Really well done w/ a light batter and lemon. The thing that made it my fav was the addition of fried hot/sweet peppers. Calimari + hot pepper + spritz of lemon made for a killer bite.\\n\\nSalads were good but the least impressive thing, I think. Mussels/ Calimari Risotto rocked. Mushroom Risotto rocked. Sister in Law got one of the pasta dishes and loved it, but not sure which one.\\n\\nIn-Laws kept saying that if they retired to a little flat in the North End they would try every single thing on the menu in just a few weeks. Everyone loved it.\\n\\nService was outstanding, which kind of surprised be since we were confused at first by the three servers sharing every table in the place (which I said is pretty small).\\n\\nThe thing that did it for me, though, was the Sunday Macaroni. The name itself does not seem impressive. I thought, maybe, it was a cheesy dish with various leftovers from the week sort of thrown into the pot. It was sort of that, but it was so, so much more.\\n\\nThick, ridged, fresh, macaroni noodles (x4 times size of a regular mac noodle), outstanding red sauce, meatballs, a house-made sausage, a braised spare rib, with the bone, and a dollop of perfectly fresh, creamy ricotta on top. I should note that while this dish cost about double of some of the other dishes, the server recommended that my wife and I share, which we did, and had leftovers.\\n\\nI saw this as not just a dish, but a culinary journey. There were 6 essentially disparate elements on the place that fit together so perfectly, so wonderfully, that it I did not see it as one dish but as a plate full of dozens of delicious combinations. Chunk of braised rib + noodle + ricotta = incredible. Replace the rib with meatball. Incredible. Rib + sauce + meatball + ricotta = incredible. All of these little combos were similar but deliciously unique. It really is one of the most well-thought out, versatile, and incredibly delicious dishes I have ever had. Check out the pics to see what I am talking about, though I didn't take one myself. To go back to my somewhat more straightforward style, this dish kicked ASS and was freaking stupid good and you should order it.\\n\\n\\nQuick Tips\\n\\n1) Be sure to make reservations irrespective of the day or time you plan to be there. This place is tiny, and was packed until maybe 3:00pm on a Saturday. There really isn't anywhere to stand while you wait, so I wouldn't recommend arriving until just a few minute before your rezzy.\\n\\n2) No dessert or coffee, which I think is pretty dang smart. They recommend Modern Pastry. Go to there.\\n\\n3) This may have just been me but the names of the dishes sort of didn't correlate to what I expected (i.e. Sunday Macaroni made me think some sort of meaty mac n cheese, which it sort of is, but also isn't at all). There are descriptions on the menu of course, but I am mentioning this for the benefit of people reading this review.\\n\\n4) Much of what we had was a bit spicier than the average. I loved this, but my Father-in-Law doesn't like heat at all so the risotto and mussels were a bit spicy for him (but he still really liked em).\\n\\n5) They kindly state on the menu that they are unable to do substitutions and changes outside of food allergies (which they absolutely accommodate)."},{"name":"El Naranjo","address":"85 Rainey St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I'd say this place is a boutique type of restaurant where the food is very good but the portions are small and probably too worried about presentation.

Kudos to them. \\n\\nFirst time here and probably last. The reason for the three stars you ask - we are just flummoxed at the excruciating slow food prep for dishes so freaking simple.

Arrive at 7:40pm and had ~30-45min wait time for 3 people. Not a problem at all since they have a walk up bar area where you can order some drinks and starters. Fried green beans are a must! We were seated around 8:10pm and ordered food around 8:20pm. This is where it went a bit downhill. \\n\\nExcited to order a few of the dishes and heard the burgers were good and grilled cheese sounded delicious so we ordered those along with the chicken schnitzel. Didn't receive our food until an hour later. Waitress seemed busy but we were the table just outside of the kitchen so any communication on delays with our food would have been greatly appreciated...but there was no communication about any delays or that maybe something we ordered would take a bit longer to make. Didn't anticipate a long wait for food since a medium rare burger and grilled cheese shouldn't take an hour to make. The chicken schnitzel is a common dish where I'm from and doesn't take long either since the chicken is pounded thin so it should ideally take less time to cook.\\n\\nThe food was just okay. Honestly, overpriced burger for what it was and they charge you $2 for cheese and $2 for bacon on top of the $14 burger which was pretty small. Chicken schnitzel was bland and not worth $19...for just a plate of breaded smashed chicken breast with no other sides besides the super small greens salad. The whole plate just seemed a bit unbalanced. Grilled cheese was also okay. Once we were done with the food it took 10min to get the check. We would have ordered dessert and more drinks had it not been such a long process but we decided to forgo the extras because we anticipated it taking much longer than normal to get anything else.\\n\\nMaybe this was an off evening. We've heard good things about this place but it just didn't live up to the expectations we had. Waiting an hour for food that shouldn't take an hour and being given no explanation as to what was taking so long or even a simple apology for the delay is unacceptable. Won't be returning to this location for a full meal.

If I don't come in to have a Chicken Caesar Salad (or to be called \\"cutie\\" by the friendly Greek lady/owner behind the counter) at least once a month I freak out. Having grown up down the street, I've tried all Winchester has to offer. People go apeshit for this family-owned pizza spot, and rightfully so. \\n\\nAbout twice a year, they play this cruel joke on everyone when they shut down for 2-3 weeks so the entire staff can vacation to Greece. People often experience convulsive withdrawals during this time, and are left with a vast empty void that can only be filled with Buff Chick Calzones and Steak Cheese & Mushroom subs with Chicken Wings on the side. It's just cruel I tell you cruel!\\n\\nHaving stayed open till 1:30am back in high school, it served as the go-to spot for an extension of that prime Winchester nightlife, or as the safe-haven buying your liver extra time to metabolize the alcohol so your parents wouldn't smell it on your breath when you got home. If you wanted to run into someone \\"by accident,\\" Andrea's was a sure bet allowing you to fulfill those adolescent hopes and dreams. I'm sure most Winchester natives can relate.\\n\\nOn to the food: The pizza is unlike most you're probably used to. The crust is thick and buttery, the sauce is really dark, and the mozzarella cheese is GENEROUS. Classic Greek pizza, I suppose. Definitely not for everyone, but it's amazing if that's what you're looking for. \\n\\nTheir Chicken Caesar Salad is bomb: plenty of tasty grilled chicken, croutons and melty cheese laid over a bed of Romaine lettuce. It's served with a pita, and not to mention the best homemade creamy Caesar dressing I've literally ever had. \\n\\nTheir Calzones are flawless, but especially the Steak and Cheese. You get a half-oval pocket (cut into 6 squares to a small, 8 to a large) of cheesy beef cooked to perfection with greasy cheese draped over the entire thing. Heart attack-inducing, but more dank and delicious than that Sour D you used to puff back in your glory daze.\\n\\nOther things to try: the Chicken Basillico Wrap, and the Honey Dijon Chicken Wrap.\\n\\nIf you're in town and looking for takeout, take my word for it: skip Gloria'a and Joe's, and grab some Andrea's instead."},{"name":"Chameleon Restaurant & Bar","address":"2000 NE 40th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"We had a family gathering here and the setting was superb.

Very disappointed!"},{"name":"Gladys Knight's Signature Chicken & Waffles","address":"529 Peachtree St NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"First and foremost, I came for the chicken and waffles. Period.\\n\\nAt some point in high school, a classmate showed up one day with a waffle and some fried chicken, both carried out from their own restaurants on the south side of Chicago. I watched in amazement as she poured syrup over both the chicken and the waffle, and ate both staples in one bite. Once I stopped gaping and giggling, I tried a bite - and was sold.\\n\\nIt wasn't until later that I learned that \\"chicken and waffles\\" is an actual thing, not just a one-time concoction by my friend. Once I knew more about the history and culture of the dish, I decided I needed to eat the real thing in one of its native environment. Although there is also a west coast chicken & waffles culture, I knew I had to get my first official bite at Gladys Knight and Ron Winans' Chicken & Waffles in Atlanta.\\n\\nIt took me several years of passing through Atlanta to finally get an opportunity to stop and partake in the treat. Driving from North Carolina to Texas, I planned a specific route through Atlanta so I could pull off on I-85 right downtown and grab some lunch. The restaurant is only a few blocks off of I-85/75, so it's easily accessible if you're passing through the city. There was also, as advertised on the website, free parking behind the restaurant. I was a bit confused since there was a pay lot right next door to the joint, but friendly locals pointed me in the right direction.\\n\\nThere wasn't much need to look at the menu since I already knew I wanted the 'Midnight Train' - a plate-sized waffle with four (huge) fried chicken wings. Within minutes of entering the restaurant, I saw several platters pass by to other tables and I truly saw the largess of the Midnight Train meal. Straight up? It's a LOT of food. So my mom and I decided to split a single chicken and waffles meal and get a side/app. We wrestled between the fried green tomatoes (southern specialty, how could we resist?) and the mac and cheese (well reviewed online, and we're both cheese lovers) - and we settled on the tomatoes, though technically both would have been 'gilding the lily' of the chicken and waffles we were also eating.\\n\\nThe fried green tomatoes were kind of disappointing. I've had them before where the tomato retains its beefy, tender quality, but I found the ones at Gladys Knight's to be too thin and overly fried/breaded. The remoulade on the side was spicy and interesting, though. We were prepared for the chicken and waffles to be average - after all, the kitchen is pumping them out non-stop! - but were thrilled to find that the waffle with crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. The chicken was fried to perfection with an  especially delicious fried skin and perfectly moist and flavorful on the inside. Each wing had a good yield of meat, so we were both satisfied with two wings and half a waffle. Truly, it was well done and delicious!\\n\\nI can't speak to the other classic southern offerings, but the quality and novelty of the chicken and waffles are both delightful. Definitely recommended! With tip and tax, we spent about $21 for the two of us (drinking water), so it was also affordable. We both agreed that we would be uncomfortably full had we attempted to eat the entire 'Midnight Train' solo, though we also agreed that we wish we had tried the mac and cheese instead of the fried green tomatoes."},{"name":"Floramo's Restaurant","address":"213 Everett Ave","city":"Chelsea","stars":"4","text":"The food is delicious.

I am sure they spent a pretty penny to make me feel like I'm in a ritzy part of Mexico. They have a massive fireplace that is gorgeous and made out of brushed copper. All the colors are so warm and welcoming, and the servers acted in a similar fashion the night we were there (Valentine's Day).\\n\\nContrary to several Yelp reviews, the service was lightening fast. My other half and I ordered the tableside guacamole ($9), and boom! It appeared within two minutes. And this was Valentine's Day, mind you, so the place was full. Our waters were refilled with similar speed. I was impressed by the attentiveness.\\n\\nIt was really cool to watch the server compile the guacamole with a mortar and pestle. He mashed up two avocados, then mixed in chopped onions, cilantro, and jalape√±os. Then he shook a lot of spice onto the side of the plate and wrote \\"Agave\\" in the spice with a knife. \\n\\nSo the guac was good. Was it mind-blowing amazing? No. It was one of those things we were eating and we both uttered, almost simultaneously, \\"We could make this at home.\\" In fact, we've made it better at home using the same ingredients plus a splash of Tapatio hot sauce and salt. \\n\\nNext, we ordered the crema de chile poblano (poblano chile cream soup). It was easily the best thing we got. I recommend it if you go. It's green (my boyfriend swears it has spinach in it ... I wasn't getting that taste though) with a really nice kick to it. It comes with a slice of grilled bread smeared with jalape√±o jelly, which I thought was a good touch. \\n\\nFor the entr√©e, we ordered the Agave Comaliada (steak). It's just a fancy name for fajita, apparently. We wanted to compare Agave's fajitas to those of the Rio. The verdict? Skip Agave and instead get the deliciously juicy steak fajitas at the Rio. My boyfriend complained that the Agave fajita didn't taste \\"fresh\\". Not spoiled or anything, but it was just meh. The meat was pretty tough without much flavor despite the grilled peppers and onions that came with it. They served homemade corn tortillas and beans and rice with the dish, and those were all fine but not phenomenal. They also served a tomato sauce that tasted like tomato paste ... not enough kick or a marriage of other flavors. If you want an excellent fajita, go to the Rio instead, definitely. \\n\\nI really wanted to fall in love with Agave, and I was very impressed by the d√©cor and the service. Unfortunately, the food seems to be nothing special. If you do venture forth to try it, don't get the tableside guac (too expensive, make it at home for 1/3 of the price) and don't get the comaliada. Be sure and get the poblano soup, though. \\n\\nI will say this -- the food presentation was impeccable. From \\"agave\\" being written in the spices to the side of rice in the shape of a pyramid, they didn't overlook any detail there. Avocado halves were utilized to hold the pico de gallo for the fajita. Despite this attention to the little things, the food just isn't quite there. In another town it might be ... but not in Boulder, where you're competing with some pretty great restaurants. \\n\\nGive this restaurant a try, but don't expect to fall madly in love.

The sauce was tasty as well. Not sure what it was. My daughter had the grilled cheese. I had a bite and it was perfect. She added bacon. Their bacon and sausage is handmade. Everyone enjoyed the atmosphere. The drink selection was unusual, but great. I got a Moscow Mueller which had a ginger beer lemon thing going. It was spicy and good, but I wouldn't try it again. I'm not much of a drinker. Overall it was great. In warmer weather it's all open outdoor seating. This evening it was covered and heated.

Lots of flavors, just the right amount of salt, soft bread, generous portions.\\n\\nThe caffe nearly disappears inside Brookline's old arcade building, which feels at first like it was abandoned 50 years ago. (There's a shoe-repair place inside, which is closed on Sundays.) Maybe that's why no one seems to know about La Scala. The adorable server told me the owner struggles to get foot traffic.

My wife and I wished to travel back there for our 5th anniversary, but were unable to do so as we are expecting un bambino in a few months.  My wife and I discovered Carmelina's North End from various websites and Yelp reviews.  We chose to make a reservation there because of a simple signature Sicilian dish that no other North End restaurant offered...Caponata.  (Caponatina if it is chopped in small pieces).  I then posted on Carmelina's Facebook how excited I was to have it!  They responded curious about our family's village.\\nWe arrived early to Hanover Street just to scope out the other menus and Gelaterie that the North End had to offer.  When we finally came to Carmelina's we noticed that the regular menu was different than what was offered on Yelp or their website.  This was a small surprise to us, but probably not to regular fine diners.  It's biggest difference to note was that there was no veal offered.  I'm not a fan of veal, but if you are making a reservation with that dish in mind, call ahead and ask.\\nWe also found that the one dish we hoped to have was only offered during lunch.  Our hearts were broken!  I'm assuming the reason for it at lunch is due to it's popularity with the regular lunch Sicilians only.  I turned to my wife and considered breaking our reservation for Pellino's just around the corner, but we ultimately decided to stay after seeing so many smiling faces eating beautifully prepared food through the \\"al fresco\\" retractable window.\\nWe were greeted by a smiling waitress who stood on a beautiful tile mosaic of the Sicilian Trinacria.  For those of you who are unfamiliar was that is, it is an ancient colonial Greek symbol found on the Sicilian flag, depicting three running legs (from the three ancient parts of the island) with the winged head of Medusa in the center.  This subtle characteristic let us know that we would be in good dining hands.\\nThe atmosphere was a very good fusion of a Sicilian family's dining room with the high class dining you'd expect from a Hanover Street establishment.  It had inflated photographs of Sicilian family members all over the walls, and tables covered in fine Sicilian marble.  There also was a high counter for dining and drinking, a trait most Sicilian cafes and trattorie have.  As a result, the seated crowd was a good mix of couples and families.  It was clear that the owner was trying to not be a \\"one trick\\" pony with catering to a specific dining group, but to offer everyone who came to the North End authentic experiences.\\nImmediately as my wife and I found our seats, a server came to deliver a dish to us directly from the owner/head chef, Damion.  It was a dish of caponatina on the house!  He saw my Facebook post, and was thrilled to congratulate us with such a cherished family dish.  My wife and I both gleamed with joy, as we had not had the dish since our honeymoon in Sicily.  He also gave us complimentary cheese bruschetta in addition to the fresh rolls with delicious Sicilian olive oil for dipping.  Please know that not everyone may get this special treatment.  Damion obviously tries to congratulate his customers the best way he can.\\nThe table next to us was just finishing their meal when the children seated had to use the restroom.  The kids couldn't finish their large plates...and they had chosen the smaller orders.  Their mother apologized to us (though she didn't need to) and said do not let their unfinished meals be a reflection of how delicious Carmelina's food is.  Later on, one of the 5 year olds said she didn't eat her meal because it had meat in it.  (she apparently was a budding vegetarian.)\\nOur waiter, Jeff, greeted us and I immediately told him how thankful we were for the dish.  He was glad to offer it, and explained that they didn't have it often on the menu...a surprise to me...but understandable as non-Sicilian Americans would not recognize it and order it.  I asked Jeff for his recommendation in a wine selection since Carmelina's had at least 50 on the menu.  He guided me to a Sangiovese and Merlot blend that hope to now purchase on my own.  He clearly knew what his clients would like, and wasn't afraid to ask questions to guide them better.  Later on, I head him joking with the table next to us about who's carbonara recipe was better.  I will have to try Carmelina's the next time, as it is clear this is a dish Damion does not take lightly.  Jeff returned with the wine and took our orders.\\nMy wife ordered the large gnocchi dish, and I had the filet mignon offered on the the special menu.  Her meal was very large so we had left overs to take home.  My filet was HUGE for the price and cooked just the way I liked it.  I especially enjoyed the blue cheese butter sauce.\\nWe look forward to going here again!"},{"name":"Taj Mahal","address":"1075 E South Boulder Rd, Ste 145","city":"Louisville","stars":"4.5","text":"Okay so I finally got to try the lunch buffet.\\n11:00-2:30pm $8.95\\n\\nThe Good\\nThey have Kheer (rice pudding) on the buffet.

A potato dish would be welcome or a Vindaloo.  As others have said, they don't add any \\"hotness\\" to their dishes and perhaps with their clientele it is wise?

I'd spent 3 years in Brighton & had never ventured north of Park Street, so I was pretty surprised by the whole general area of North End. There were plenty of Italian restaurants in the area, but my friends chose to stop in here & I must say it was a really really good choice.\\n\\nFirst off, this is a pretty small but cozy & quaint restaurant. The seating area up front is my favorite, as there is a nice little fireplace & big floor to ceiling windows facing the street, so you can people-watch as you eat. The seating in the back is more standard & far less visually appetizing. The servers are friendly & just the right amount of attentive without being overbearing. They have an excellent wine selection and are really good at helping you pick the right glass or bottle to pair with your meal. My first time here, we ended up ordering 3 bottles :)\\n\\nThe food, though delicious, is where I knocked off a star. Even though I really liked my veal parm the first time, I think my feelings towards the food were more a reflection of my love of the general atmosphere of the great decor, great company & copious amounts of wine. What I mean to say is that the food fit just fine into the general experience, but without those 3 additional elements, the food would have just been okay to me, but not exceptional. I came back again last week during my birthday trip to Boston and this realization became even more clear. Once again, I loved the atmosphere, I loved the service, I loved my company and I loved my wine. But I didn't feel the same way about the food. It was good, but I didn't love it.

That's ok though, there's always good choices on the menu! My friend and I both loved our savory dishes, but ended up leaving our sweet dishes completely untouched because they were overwhelmingly sweet--even sweeter than I would like most of my desserts, let alone my breakfast (unless I'm eating dessert for breakfast, of course).\\n\\nTip #1: This place gets very popular, so be prepared for a long wait! We went in the afternoon (late enough to be off peak time), so our wait was only 30 minutes, but it can be much longer during peak brunch hours. Luckily, there are a lot of cute stores and shops in the area, so you can wander around and browse while you wait. \\n\\nTip #2: As mentioned above, my friend and I both loved our savory dishes but didn't touch the sweet ones.

We both loved our sandwiches (the pork belly was perfectly crispy), though it was a little strange that one came with potato chips (pork belly) and one came with fries (BBQ pork). The menu didn't say anything about sides and as the person who received the potato chips, I was instantly jealous of my man's fries...luckily, he let me steal some off his plate! ;) That said, I would have asked to upgrade to fries if given the option.\\n\\nHe LOVED his beer (something by Powell St. brewing) and my grapefruit juice/vodka concoction was decent, though it was a little strange that it was served with a straw given the point of the drink is the salted rim.\\n\\nThe restaurant was filthy (food on the floor under our table), a daddy long legs crawling on the wall behind my head, and I watched as several of the staff ate food (with their hands) behind the counter, while still working in between bites, and never washed their hands. I don't know what Canadian standards are for working in food service, but that would not fly in America and it made me a little uncomfortable.

Daniel M. go their beer battered smoked tofu and man do they give you a ton of tofu! Those were huge pieces of tofu, so you really need to love tofu to get this dish. The smoky flavor was unique but pretty strong that you could only have so much of it. Paired with their caper aioli was a nice touch though.

Daniel M. never takes fries home since let's be honest they never reheat or rebake the right way, but he had to think long and hard about whether he wanted to take home the rest since it is shame to waste any of those bad boys.

After all classes were canceled at BU, I went in here to watch the coverage with the regulars. That was the first time I met the owner, Angus, and while I can't imagine he remembers that occasion, I know he remembers me from the (god knows how) many times I've been in there since. He makes his bar feel like a home. I haven't been in there in probably a year and I'm confident I could walk in on Monday and he'd know me by name. Angus is the kind of man that was born to own and run a bar. His hospitality is outstanding. I have been here for random lunch beers, long pointless afternoons of drinking, official academic job search dinners, and St. Patrick's Days. I hope it never changes.

The service however ruined my experience. \\nWe came in one night for dinner and only had to wait about 20 minutes for our table. The host was very polite. We grabbed a drink at the bar and the bartender definitely did not seem happy to be assisting us. However, the pepino was amazing. We got our table and it was on one of the picnic tables outside that we shared with another group of strangers, which is fine because they were very fun. :) Although, it was a particularly cold night (in the 40's) and we asked our waitress and multiple other servers if there was any possible way to get a heater on our side of the table. We asked over and over and over and everyone basically purposefully ignored our requests. Finally, one of my friends went over and grabbed one from an empty table and brought it over. Upon doing so, a server stomped over and rudely asked us if we had asked his table if it was okay to take their heater. I stared over at the empty table confused. My friend offered to take it back but the server stormed off mumbling some profanities at us. \\nThat was only the beginning, not only did it take our waitress maybe ten minutes to greet us but she clearly had no food knowledge whatsoever. They have a section of the menu for Charcuterie plates and there isn't much of a description as to what they are. When we asked our server what a couple of them were she leaned over and read off of our menu the exact description. I mean, I can read I'm not stupid. Not everyone knows what Cotechino or Crepinette's are and clearly our server didn't either. By the time she would come back to our table we would have twelve different orders we would need because she was never there. She never once asked us how anything was, we would have to ask multiple different servers for things we needed who would clearly ignore us. She never pre-bussed any of the dirty dishes that were filling our table. At one point we asked her if anything else was coming out (we were still expecting 3 plates) and she told us that she thought everything had came out already. I then reminded her that we had ordered 3 other plates and she said \\"Oh yeah those are probably coming out then.\\" What does that even mean? Finally the plates came out and they were all delicious. After staring at dirty plates for nearly 30 minutes she strolled back by to drop our check and said she would send a busser over to clear the plates. I guess she is too good for that? She then dropped our check which was $150 for 5 people, not bad pricing right? After waiting another 20 minutes for her to come take our payments she told us that after she ran the cards a gratuity would be added to our checks. Where does it say that in the menu? Why would you not state that when you dropped the check off? Super sketchy. I think she realized that she had given us horrible service and wanted to still get her 20%. We're service industry people so it's not like she was getting less than that anyway. But still, we will definitely not be returning.

Except that the same annoying guy would answer the phone and repeatedly would put me on \\"hold\\" (i.e. put the phone down while I had to listen to him flirt with some other \\"dear\\" for up to ten minutes) and either forget I was on the line or just didn't think it was important to take my order. The times that I didn't just give up, the burgers I picked up were wildly inconsistent. Sometimes I'd get a great one, sometimes it was a pile of mush. I made a comment describing my frustration with the place to annoying guy, who told me he would give me a \\"hood discount,\\" which turned out to be about 80 cents. Thanks, bro. I wanted to like the place--it's so close to my house, after all, and I love burgers--but I decided to swear off Your Mom's for good after all the shenanigans.

It was all just well done and delicious.  I particularly liked the duck confit salad--a full crisp and juicy thigh over a bed of greens and the shoestring fries.  The risotto was creamy though not as rich and flavorful as I'd hoped for.  Everyone else raved about the mac and cheese which had lovely bits of crunchiness going on--panko crumbs?, but I think I'm just not the biggest mac and cheese person.  The portions are very generous, especially when it comes to the sides--they should warn you that those can easily be shared amongst three people, and the duck salad was plenty to split between two people as a starter.\\n\\nThey had a small but thoughtful selection of cocktails and each cocktail seemed to have its own size/shape of ice.  Some kind of bartender secret?  The staff couldn't have been nicer or more accommodating--dishes that we indicated would be shared were helpfully served on two plates, they turned down the ac because we were freezing, and unusual for a fine dining place, they were happy to allow each of us to decide to order a la carte or to do the chef's menu.\\n\\nI'd definitely come back next time I'm in Vancouver."},{"name":"Sabor Del Caribe","address":"1502 W Vine St","city":"Kissimmee","stars":"3.5","text":"Awesome authentic and traditional caribbean food.

This is way nicer. \\n\\nThey did an amazing renovation and there are a couple different vibes going on in this restaurant: classy and chill. Each section has different furnishings but it's all kind of united by a common theme of relaxed luxury. If you walk straight past the main entrance there's a stately dining room decked out with warm wood and bronze - kind of like The Guild House, except good. On the other side there's a sparkly marble bar wrapping around to a raised lounge. \\n\\nWe like people watching so we requested the patio, then ordered martinis and a starter at the bar while we waited for our table. I got the Ruby Red, a really nice refreshing grapefruit cocktail - the bartender pressed the grapefruit right in front of us to make it - and Dani sipped on a glass of Cava. We shared the Shanghai style calamari for an appetizer. It was crispy and delicious with some nice surprises tucked in like roasted peppers and peanuts.\\n\\nThe patio is worth waiting for, especially on a heavy traffic weekend. High Street bustled with every sort of person in Columbus. Young professionals dressed up for Saturday night, suburban parents dragging their kids around, college bros talking louder than anyone else on their way over to Park Street. And, because of Comfest, hippies. Too many hippies.  \\n\\nService was attentive but not obtrusive. Food was brought out at a good pace and the table was cleared in a timely fashion. I agreed to the server's suggestion and ordered the pecan-crusted grouper with sweet potato and bacon hash. Dani chose the southern fried half chicken. \\n\\nWe kind of ate off each other's plate; we really had too. Both dishes were absolutely scrumptious. The fried chicken comes with this spicy chorizo gravy that made my eyes roll back. We also split a couple sides: jalapeno mac and cheese (spicy and spectacular), and sauteed wild mushrooms. The mushrooms had a little too much olive oil. We told the server and after a few minutes she came back with a new one that was perfect.\\n\\nAfter the entrees we shared the warm butter cake, a thick, semi-molten vanilla sponge cake with vanilla ice cream and Italian cherry drizzle. I would literally go back to Black Point just to eat this cake, and I consider myself a helplessly snobbish dessert hound.  \\n\\nOther than the tiny blemish with the mushrooms, I really cannot say anything bad about the food here.

It has about 5 locations nationwide.  It has 2 levels and modern industrial-like decor worked into the scenery.  Yarhouse had many speakers with rock music and TVs all over the walls.

We went in the early evening late afternoon AKA 'senior suppertime.'

He really liked it and would like to give it 4 stars. \\nI tasted it and I think it majorly missed the mark. It wasn't near cheesy enough. It needed way more cheddar and it just was not as robust as my palate demands. I could also not taste the truffle oil or the faux chicken.  In fact I completely forgot it had faux chicken in it until he reminded me. It was more like buttered pasta with parm and mushrooms. I probably wouldn't order this or this version of it.  The' side salad' that he ordered for the extra $3 was huge and healthy looking. \\nI ordered the lamb burger with the truffle oil fries. For a huge warehouse space, and for the price, I expected the burger to come out as big as my head.  WRONG! It was your normal everyday size like a regular burger at your favorite fast food joint.  Bummer!  The lamb burger I bet was lamb ground up with beef. I betcha it is not 100% lamb.  I ordered it as it came with a side of mayo. The first bite I could tell it was lamb, but by the second bite it just tasted like a regular hamburger.  The fixings did not help with making this a memorable sandwich.\\nThe fries on the other hand are some of the best fries I have had, and I usually pass when it comes to shoestring fries. I usually hate shoestring fries because I actually like to see potato in my fries. What made these outstanding besides doing a good job cooking them was the truffle oil. Excellent. Some of the best fries in Portland if you ask me. \\n\\nWith the exception of a few items, overall this meal was not that memorable. Your average run of the mill corporate warehouse restaurant. But this was my first time here and I would be willing to return to give it another shot. Some of the other menu items look intriguing.  So all in all ;The menu selection was outstanding.

Tots.\\n\\nIf you go here, which you totally should, you cannot leave without eating some bacon tots! I didn't expect these to be the highlight of my meal but they stole the show (a difficult task given the delicious Fat Farmer veggie burger also on my plate). Let me be up front about my bias: I freaking love tater tots. Especially fancy tater tots. I once ordered some fancy tots (over regular tater tots) from a delivery chain and then mocked the person who took my order (privately, I'm not a total jerk) for even ASKING what kind of tater tots I wanted. Fancy tots, obvi. Anyway, I love me some tater tots, but am not as crazed about bacon or cheese trends like the rest of the world. And guess what? TILT's bacon tots have bacon AND a surprise of gooey, cheesy goodness inside! Which was DELIGHTFUL! Even for me, a non-cheese fan.\\n\\nSo, you're at TILT and have immediately placed your order of bacon tots. Now what? You're probably stumped by what burger to order because there are so many good ones to choose from. Let me give you another piece of advice: GET THE FAT FARMER.\\n\\nOccasionally, I will crave a veggie burger (clearly I'm not a vegetarian given my detailed love affair with those bacon tots). Many times, that veggie craving is met with mediocrity -- but not here. This burger was SOO good! It was seasoned to be slightly spicy and so so sooo good! Like, I find myself daydreaming of this veggie burger. My boyfriend was with me when we ate here, and he is a die-hard meat lover and hater of 98% of the world's veggie patties. I forced him to try my burger and he actually enjoyed it too! He liked that it didn't pretend to be a beef burger and held it's own as a veggie burger.\\n\\nThere was a decent selection of beers to pick from, and they had one of my faves on tap. Regrettably, we didn't try a slice of pie -- but you should definitely try a piece when you go (if you have room after all those bacon tots you'll be eating...).\\n\\nThe only reason I didn't give a five-star rating was the atmosphere. The place was busy with young twenty- and thirty-somethings and it seemed like a good meet-up spot for all sorts of reasons. The vibe was comfortable and cool (not pretentious), but it was too loud. Far too loud. The music bordered on club music, which is not my thing. We went later in the evening on a weeknight, so maybe things are a bit different at another time of day (I'm thinking afternoons might be good), but it wasn't ideal for normal volume dinner chatter.\\n\\nThe food here, though, easily deserves five-stars.

That should tell you that it was very very tasty! It came looking a little different than I anticipated but still very good. It also came out really really fast. I don't know if that's normal but it was nice to have my food served very very quickly. The wait staff was fairly attentive I would've preferred very attentive but still they did a decent job.

After spending the whole day at the beach we decided to have an early dinner at Shula 347.  Unfortunately, this was a mistake when we arrived which was at 4:00, we asked the hostess for a table for 2. She looks at some list and tells us sorry no tables available.  However, its 4:00 and it did not look to be crowed at all, which I found to be strange and very rude.  My husband turns back around and speaks with another lady who found us a table yes, outside, however, it was in a corner WTF, why are we being treated like this. Maybe because we weren't dressed in a tuxedo or a ball room gown.  But this was very rude, and we figured Shula's restaurant can't be that good when his previous football team in reality sucked and continues to suck.    So my husband and I decided to go across the way to Ruth Chris and amazing service.  They greeted us with kindness and attended to us like always.  We had no problem spending over $100 in a great steak and wine.  THINK TWICE BEFORE EATING AT SHULA'S 347.  Anyways one of there restaurants in Miami closed down if that's any indication.

Now I should've known, when I ordered onion rings and they didn't taste very good that it was a sign of bad things to come.

These onion rings although they contained onion and were deep-fried did not taste like much.

He is not picky eater, but he said that the sandwich was bland and ended up taking two thirds of it home where it sat in the fridge. The second person ordered an omelette, which looked like the standard omelette that you would get any diner. It was not very big, just average. I ordered the club sandwich. While it was mildly good tasting at first the many strong flavors started to override the rest of the sandwich. I was about 2 to 3 bites into the sandwich when I was already changing my mind about whether or not it tasted good. The sandwich also came home and sat in my fridge.\\nThe potato salad side was pretty good. The mustard baked beans, we're not. They were more like an Indian chili than baked beans. Rajma would be a better description.\\nAnyway, this place is overrated, and even vegans want food that tastes good.

The chipoltle cole saw was inventive and tasty if you like that sauce.  The seating area was also under shade which made an outdoor meal on a 97 degree day bearable."},{"name":"Salty Sow","address":"1917 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"As far as gastro pubs go, I like this place better than Swift's Attic, but Barley Swine remains my favorite.\\n\\nThe things I tried:\\n\\nDuck Fries - 5 stars.  As far as fries go, these are some of the best.\\n\\nTruffled Deviled Eggs - 4 stars.  Well I'm somewhat biased in that I adore deviled eggs of any sort, but add truffle oil flavor and you've made yourself an easy sale...\\n\\nBeef Cheeks - 3.5 stars.  I never knew I liked beef cheeks until I tried them very recently at another restaurant.  So I ordered them again, and these were comparably good.  The \\"smashed potatoes\\" they came with were awesome.\\n\\nGlazed Turnips - 3.5 stars.  Surprisingly tasty and I would order them again.  \\n\\nCripsy Brussels Sprout Leaves - 1.5 stars.  I think the key word here is \\"leaves\\" vs. the entire Brussels spout, because this left them susceptible to being a bit too brittle, although oddly too chewy in spots.  --For the best Brussels sprouts in town, hit up Barley Swine, Uchiko or Eastside King @ the Liberty Bar.--\\n\\nButterscotch Boudino and Bananas Foster - 4 stars.  I highly recommend alternating spoonfuls of both of these delightful treats!  Of course, I'm a sucker for salted caramel (butterscotch dessert) and who wouldn't love nutmeg ice cream!? (bananas foster).\\n\\nThe interior is charming and the decor is super cute, love the variety of \\"pig art\\" -- you DO think pigs are cute, right?......they've done wonders to the place since it's previous incarnations as Red House Pizza and Stortini.

We then go to get our sides we came back to a 15 minute wait and me asking when did they start with the meat (we did the all you can eat Brazilian bbq). not cool... my companion ate a whole plate of food before the meat started and it was a long wait in between each meat.   I could accept this if the place was crowded but there were only three tables occupied and then he continued to bring the same 2 meats pork and beef, I asked  don't you have sausage and lamb and bread etc: he said o yeah.... i think we saw the sausage once...

It has such a different atmosphere than the Swan Island location--it's has a lot of wood mixed with the industrial decor and a bar area oppose to the commercial look.  They have a ping pong table!  More of a place you could hangout than a fast food joint.  They were testing out new menu items during the event, my friend and I were hooked.  Those cheddar tots!  That patty melt...and the fried chicken biscuit sandwiches!  \\n\\nNeedlessly to say, I've been back quite a few times.  It's getting too popular and busy though.  There's always a line to order on the weekend and you have stalk tables.  Parking is wicked hard to find in that location--I don't know if I've ever been more frustrated with finding parking than my last visit when it took 30 minutes to find a space, which ended up being far away.  I tried Big Tilt Burger, fries, cinnamon rolls, chef's salad, Philly vs. PDX, Mad Andy, onion rings, cheddar/jalapeno tots, and pie.  I didn't care for the Big Tilt Burger, I shared with a friend but it's too much for me alone.  My two favourites are the Mad Andy and Philly vs. PDX.  I always love the combination of bacon, blue cheese, and fried onion on a burger--I added barbecue sauce and asked for my egg to be overeasy because they will do it overhard otherwise.  The burgers are easier to finish than the massive sandwiches.  Philly vs. PDX has brisket with american cheese and grilled bell pepper/onions on thick-cut white bread, so good...I could only handle half of it  Always order a side to share with my friends, I recommend the tots with a side of the Tilt sauce for dipping.\\n\\nThere are multiple bar area that you could order drinks from and not have to stand in line again.

Whether it sounds good or not on paper, it'll make your mouth water once it's in front of you.  Hit up happy hour!\\n\\nI hit up Salty Sow twice: once for dinner and then for happy hour.  For dinner, I got their Duck Fat Fries, Candied Pork Belly, and Banana Foster Beignets.\\nTheir Duck Fat Fries are pretty good, but not too impressive.  The fries are definitely crispy although a bit salty for my taste, but the addition of the egg made the whole dish worth it.  Can't go wrong with dipping freshly made fries into the gooey goodness of the egg yolk.  This appetizer is definitely fit for 3 people to share.\\nOn to the Candied Pork Belly.  I wished mine had a slightly higher fat-to-meat ratio, but the meat was tender with a crispy exterior, just the way I like it.  Knives not necessary for this dish!\\nFinally the Beignets.  The star of the night!!  The beignets were perfectly crispy and piping hot.  Melting the nutmeg ice cream over the fried dough created a heavenly combination of hot with cold and a crispy outside with a soggy inside.  You can really taste the bananas in the dough.  Delicious!\\n\\nFor happy hour, I ordered the Crispy Brussel Sprouts and the Fried Chicken.  At first, I was skeptical of both dishes: how good can brussel sprouts and fried chicken really be?  Let me tell you, the taste is shocking.\\nThe brussel sprout leaves are super crispy and even though I'm not a fan of veggies, I'll eat this any day.  A great snack, the brussel sprouts are seasoned very well: perfect level of saltiness that doesn't overpower the natural taste of the brussel sprouts.\\nWhat makes Salty Sow's fried chicken really unique is their sweet honey coating over the fried batter.  My mouth was met with shots of savory and sweet flavors working in perfect unison.  The dark meat is very tender and I'll happily throw them my $5 any day!  My only complaint was that although I loved the sweetness of the batter, the chicken itself could have been seasoned a bit more.  The Sweet Potato biscuit that came with the chicken was good and a large portion, but can be a bit dry.\\n\\nThe service was wonderful although can be pretty slow on busy nights.  Since their indoor seating is limited, be cautious and make a reservation if you can!  Also, parking is limited and the spaces itself can get a bit tight.\\n\\nOne of the few restaurants where I would love to try their whole menu!\\n\\n****UPDATE****\\nWent back and tried two new dishes:\\nDeviled Eggs: A simple and great dish.  The yolk is creamy and the eggs are overall very very tasty.  A plate comes with four eggs and given the chance I can and will eat all of them.\\n\\nPork Tenderloin Medallions: Presentation is absolutely stunning.  The dish comes with three pork tenderloin medallions and a lot of pearl onions.  I was under the impression (and a bit excited) that the pork would be cooked medium rare, but the medallions were cooked white all the way through.  Regardless, the pork was tender and juicy.  What I didn't like was the taste of the jus.  It was a bit too sweet and thick for my taste.  The onions were soft and good, but I got tired of them midway through the meal.  Overall, a tasty dish, but not very impressive.  I couldn't find many reviews or pictures of this dish, and I can see why.  4/5 for the pork and 2.5/5 for everything else in the bowl.\\n******************"},{"name":"Olive Garden Italian Restaurant","address":"5450 Renner Rd","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"Mother's Day at a chain Italian restaurant!

I love lobster, but this was spongy, overcooked claw meat. I wasn't expecting lobster tail, but there was hardly any knuckle. The couscous, which was Israeli couscous, was way overcooked. The cream sauce had no taste - no salt, no pepper. It had some fried rosemary leaves floating in it, which was not as special as it could have been. When ordering, I had specifically said to the server that I don't want raw onion or garlic. When I got the dish, I saw some pieces of undercooked onion. When I showed the server, he said, well, it isn't raw, it's cooked. Sure, you can throw some raw onion on the pan for a split-second, have it taste overpowering and too strong and uncooked, and say it's cooked!  Disgusting!  There was also cold, uncooked tomato. The combination of uncooked, cooked, and overcooked items was enough to make me nauseous. There was also egg yolk (soft boiled), and I was confused - it tasted like a strange breakfast item (like a pre-adolescent attempt to make a Southwestern omelet) rather than lobster couscous (a dinner item with a fine name). Really awful dish! I would've thought it acceptable if at least the lobster was done well, but it was so overcooked and spongy that I was annoyed.

I can't remember the last time I indulged in an off-the-shelf Twinkie, but the battered deep-fried \\"Drunkie Twinkie\\" dessert served with in-house ice cream was flat-out amazing. I briefly considered keeping it all to myself, but everyone started staring at me. \\n\\nAdditional flashes of restaurant greatness: The cutlery was delivered in cloth napkins, they do weekend brunch, and our server Elizabeth handled nine of us with gracious ease and aplomb, splitting our checks without issue and just truly being on top of her game. The Ten Oak chef, James Roller (that was the name embroidered on his jacket) came out to visit us when we had questions about his \\"Fig in the Pig\\" - this guy obviously takes his food here seriously, and kudos to him.

Do you have to-go boxes?  Do you have any sauce without a tomato base?  It was a truly impressive level of incompetent between the two of them.  It was like watching Lucy and Ethel in the episode with the chocolates, except it wasn't funny and we were literally there for five minutes, at the counter, trying very sincerely to order two small pizzas.  I could have switched places with either of those dudes and been more passably capable.  We were also the only people in line, and the only (half) order in, which they promptly began to eff up.\\nPhrases like, \\"hello could you hold?\\" and \\"just a moment, I can check for you\\" might help, but not much.

You can choose what kind you want, and the reason this gets 5 stars instead of 4 is because they have fried okra. I could live off of fried okra, its that good, so naturally, I got the pulled brisket bbq sandwich, fried okra, and some grilled veggies. It was perfection.

You get several courses - onion soup, salad, noodles, rice, and steak/chicken/shrimp/etc along with two sauce options.  The chefs are very entertaining and have always made everything exactly to order (I usually go medium rare with the steak and it's been perfect each time).  Unless you have a massive appetite, you're going to go home with a box of some solid leftovers.  The drink selection here is not all that big, but you have your basic Japanese beers along with most types of basic wine.  The wines are very reasonably priced in my opinion - you can get a decent one for a little under $30.

Most importantly, Hoppy IPAs which are rotated frequently.\\n\\nTheres a decent amount of bar seating as well as long bar tables with seats, but you need to get there early in order to get one. People have already discovered this place and its busy pretty much every night (and I AM there every night). \\n\\nThe food is really good, I've had the burger, but I'm not a huge fan of the wings because they are so large (just doesnt seem natural to me and bugs me out). The bartenders are all pretty kickass and remember you. They also all really know their brews, so if you want a suggestion or something similar to something else, dont hesistate to ask.\\n\\nTheres also seating upstairs if downstairs is packed, but there are only 2 TV up there, one on either side of the room. The other negative about upstairs is that theres no bar up there...I think they should really add one. \\n\\nThis will continue to remain one of my favorite local bars (along with Publick House) and I will continue to frequent it.

It's Thai-influenced small plates served family style. What's not to love?  Service and taste is the short answer. \\n\\nWe arrived a bit early for a reservation for four, and there were parties at two tables in the large space, plus one customer at the bar. The first thing I saw upon walking in was their back room, which is not well disguised and unpleasant to look at. As it took about five minutes to be seated, there was plenty of time to study the mess. Yuck. The interior is cute. It was still decorated for Christmas. I think. Because then there was an aggressive application of teal and white balloons everywhere that looked an awful lot like an 80's baby shower. And then there was a subtle theme of flying pigs alongside a classic movie playing on-screen. Maybe a nod to the Hollywood neighborhood?  It was all very confusing. There was one server/busser/bartender, Elizabeth, for the whole place. That meant five minutes to be seated, ten minutes to get water, and another ten minutes for drinks. She was busy, that's for sure. I'm sure that's why the dirty table we were seated next to remained that way for 20 minutes. \\n\\nWe skipped the bites and had the bread plate while we decided on small plates. The bread is excellent, beautifully grilled and served with olive oil, herbs, and a very nice blue cheese. It was the most balanced plate of the night. \\n\\nFor small plates, we had pork belly, Brussels sprouts, chicken wing, potatoes, chicken wraps, and skirt steak, alongside Tom Yum soup. The soup was pleasant but lacked the heat normally associated with Tom Yum. The wraps were the big hit, followed by the skirt steak and pork belly. The sprouts were light and delicate but sorely lacked for a sauce. The potatoes were just bland, over-fried potato chunks, and the wing was absolutely without flavor. Thai food has a distinct sour/sweet/spicy/salty funk that makes it wonderful. The recurring theme on this meal was a lack of heat or spice or acid. Is the chef afraid of sauce?  Almost every dish seemed to be missing that element, leaving everything bland. \\n\\nSadly it's not a do-again."},{"name":"Stanford's Restaurant & Bar","address":"913 Lloyd Ctr","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"This place is right opposite where i stay so it's really convenient, I tried their ribs a full rack it was really good, I admit Iv had better but the portions you get a really big and the paintings are really nice, my girlfriend got the fish and chips which was a really big portion as well, overall the customer service is slightly above average the food is alright but the location works out really will for me"},{"name":"Trattoria San Pietro","address":"376 Washington St, Ste 1","city":"Norwell","stars":"3.5","text":"We had been regulars at Trattoria until a couple of months ago, when I paid $13 for a take-out pint of their delicious Bolognese sauce, and decided to learn to make it myself.

Since that was one of my favorite dishes there, i no longer feel the pull to spend money eating there.  When they had osso bucco as a nightly special, I asked the server where was the gremolata.  She had no idea what I was talking about, so I described the mince of parsely, lemon rind and garlic, all of which they would have available in the kitchen.  Did she offer to have the chef whip some up?  Not.  Also, in all the times we had patronized the place, never once did the owner move his ass off his barstool to offer a welcome or a thank you.

We visited the first week and I must say, the food, the service, from top to bottom it was a wonderful experience. We work nearby and were very excited to have a new restaurant here and looked forward to coming back after. Now, after going several times since, I hate to say it has done nothing but gone downhill since. When we have dined in, the waiting staff has been very inattentive, seeming to care more about socializing around the restaurant with other staff and people at the bar than the tables. We waited at the host stand for quite some time to be seated to begin our visit, and we would go long periods without being attended to at our table throughout the course of the meal. Still, we have really liked the food so started to resort to takeout hoping maybe that would be better. On our most recent visit, we had an issue with the service again. This time, we came in to pick up our order, and upon arrival they told us to go pick it up at the bar. The bartender was away at the time, for QUITE some time, which we were ok with at first but in front of us they started asking a manager who was sitting at the bar watching TV about getting us taken care of. He looked over, said 'they can wait', then proceeded to watch TV again and drink whatever he had. Now we're not really upset about how the bartender took some time to get back, it happens from time to time. But what kind of message are you sending with your manager/supervisor doing that in front of customers? I've been in management for years and your staff tends to follow the example of superiors, kind of explains a lot. To top it off, the food quality this time was no where near on par with where it had been. We had noticed a slight decline since we first went, not horrible but definitely not where it had been. Honestly the food is the only reason I won't give this only one star.

That said, that 110 minute egg was a damn good egg.  So I'd probably still get this again, because fries (duck fat or no) are always pretty good and the egg was awesome too. \\n- Duck breast.  This is the dish I got and it was really good.  The others at my table agreed this was the winner of all the dishes ordered.  The other dishes ordered were the pork belly (which I thought was a close 2nd), blackened redfish, and I forget the others.  \\n- Drinks were yum but kind of high priced.\\n- Atmosphere was great.

A good handful were quite fun and unique, while others looked like regular buns I can get at an Asian bakery. Ordered a beef kara (curry) donut and a matcha & custard bun. The curry donut was definitely different, but I would not get it again. I think the price played a big factor in my decision as well, the price is a bit too high for me to be a repeat customer.

My husband ordered the crab spring rolls and the orange roll.  He was still hungry and ordered the calamari after inhaling his 1st two items.  \\n\\nOverall, the food was delicious!  I especially enjoyed the presentation for the egg rolls.  Mine came out sliced in halves, drizzled with sweet chili sauce. His came out in shot glasses with sweet chili sauce at the bottom of each glass.  The yakisoba came out on a hot mini skillet (suitable for sharing, of course).  As far as the service, the waitress was very friendly and the food came out quickly.  It's also good to know that if you're a first timer here and check in on Yelp, you get a free dessert.

We've never had an issue with the food itself. (2) Service/Customer Service is lacking. The first time I'm referring to, we waited 15 minutes before a server even acknowledged we were sitting there. (3) They got rid of the Changs for 2 off the \\"regular\\" menu. However, I was at the Maumee location the weekend prior and they still had it.

A bit of wait on a Sat night for a table of 2.  Long lineup for bigger parties without reservation (30min wait).  Parking is ample.  Has a big LCD screen showcasing their dishes right at the restaurant's entrance waiting area; a rather smart biz tactic as ppl are more willing to try new food when they know how it looks like.  May be that is how they draw ppl to the restaurant despite the food is just a-ok by Portland standards.\\n\\nFood:  A-ok.  Ordered Papaya salad and Pad Kee Mao.  Both were tasty but had no special kick.  Didn't wow us. Portion is on the big side; great for sharing.  Not enough basil in the Kee Mao to enhance the dish aroma.  The salad used too much fish sauce and didn't quite balance out the palm sugar, so it ended up being a bit too salty.  The fried bananas dessert was disappointing; its batter coating was so thick and over fried, and it pitifully came with only 4 short strips of fried bananas - each split in half - that is only 1 whole banana was being used in the making of this dish.  Given bananas are relatively cheap, why cannot they put more in as supposed to cheat & fill the plate up with fried coconuts - which was not even part of the dish description.  If we didn't have the cup of free coconut ice-cream from checking-in on Yelp, we wouldn't be able to chew any of these down. \\n\\nAtmosphere:  Clean & decent. Good for groups.

I came here for lunch last year, but this year I came for dinner to finally use my yelp deal. \\n\\nAlthough our initial thought when we first walked in was \\"How many people does it take to seat three people?\\" 5 was the answer. After watching 5 people walk around and glance at us from the back near the kitchen as if deciding who would come seat us, we were finally seated. Okay, I admit, we're asian, that doesn't mean we don't want some decent italian food though.\\n\\nAnyways, we quickly chose our orders but ended up waiting for about 10 minutes for someone to come over to take our order.

The entrees came out quickly and in huge portions. I was finally able to appreciate the food here. We pretty much at a slice of pizza and a few bites of both of the noodle plates and were full. Carby deliciousness. There was a lot leftover. Most memorable was the La Famiglia Special. The pizza was great and unfortunately I forgot the add the red pepper flakes to my calamari until I was too full. Woe is me! \\n\\nOverall, the food was decent and the service was mediocre. Don't forget guys, if you choose to share a plate they will charge you about $12 extra just because their portions are large and they don't want to lose out.

Everyone else had their lawn chair out, just hanging out. They seemed to be having a great time, especially with the free beers.

Though I am more of a pescatarian myself (I know, blasphemous), I ate an embarassingly large amount of meat. The brisket was juicy and super tender. The meat on the ribs fell right off the bone, like it should. And the pickles added fantastic acid notes between my voracious bites of meat. The sausages weren't seasoned to my taste.

We ended up standing in line for an hour and a half, so when it was our turn, we decided that we had to order a lot of food to make up for the wait. \\n\\nWe ended up ordering a pound of brisket and half a pound of pulled pork, as well as a piece of beef ribs and a serving of potato salad. Yes, all of that for two of us. \\n\\nThe wait and seating is outdoors, so be sure to slather on lots of sunscreen before coming here! Seating was pretty easy to find despite the amount of people. \\n\\nNow let's talk about the food!\\n\\n- Beef ribs: As I mentioned before, best we have ever had. The meat just gently falls off the bone and the fat is melted into the meat itself, making it super juicy and tasty. We have definitely never had this quality of beef ribs anywhere else. \\n- Brisket: The brisket is very juicy, fatty and tender. We found that we definitely ordered waaaaay too much brisket. We are huge meat-lovers if you can't tell, but this amount was a little too heavy even for us. The brisket is good, but not mind-blowingly good and not quite on another level as the beef ribs are.\\n- Pulled pork: Very, very flavourful. Probably the best mix of flavour I have tasted in pulled pork. A lot of barbecue places we've had in California just overdo the amount of sauce on the pulled pork and drown it in tanginess. This amount was absolutely perfect. Again though, it was amazing, but didn't hit the mind-blowing level.\\n- Potato salad: Eh. I'm the biggest fan of potatoes and when I saw another review say that they have the best potato salad ever, I just knew I had to get some. It was really just alright. I'd stick with the meats, although it does make for an okay side.\\n\\nOverall, all the meats were better than any barbecue meats we have had before in California, but I'm short of giving it 5 stars because it didn't bring us to another level. If we lived in Austin, we probably wouldn't stand in line for it regularly, but would come whenever friends or family visit.

A few minor quibbles, but definitely one of the better restaurant experiences we've had in ATL.\\n\\nFirst off, they did a good job with the decor and we were sat next to one another in a corner booth--cool, and nice to be right next to one another, though it was hard to get out.  We love the Heath Ceramics flatware & the mix & match colors of them, really classy.\\n\\nNow, for the important part: We shared an arugula salad, the calamari, the brussels sprouts, the farro dish with mushrooms, and the toffee cake.  All were good, though a little bit more restraint overall would have been helpful.  The calamari dish was delicious, perfectly fried, and the fried meyer lemon in there is just plain genius.  I loved the Farro in general, it is a well-conceived dish that has a lot of depth of flavor and is well-balanced.  But it had too much butter in it.  Now, I love butter like anyone else in his or her right mind, and butter had a place in this dish--it was just overdone.  Though I still really liked the dish, that could have been toned down and it would have been incredible.  Brussels sprouts = yum.  The bread that they bring to the table (baked in house) is excellent, and I'm particular about bread.  We also enjoyed the dessert (toffee cake), it was nicely straightforward and had a well-balanced, subtle bit of salt that really took it up a notch and made it a lot more interesting.  The house wines were also solid (I had the pinot, wife had the chard). I also had a very respectable macchiato with dessert.\\n\\nService was very attentive and quick, and our server was knowledgeable and friendly.   Hard to benchmark, though, since we were there on the early side (6:00) on a weeknight, so it wasn't exactly packed.\\n\\nthe bill was $80 something with the two glasses of wine, dessert & coffee (not including tip)--not cheap but to my mind a reasonable price for the quality of the food.

They label the TVs with the teams being shown so you can choose a table where you can see your team, which is super handy. As the games get going, the place gets LOUD. This should be expected of a sports bar on game day. \\nI wouldn't say the place is \\"good for kids\\" (volume, crowd, menu), but they have an all ages area and several young ones were there. Bring something for them to do. There are some video games but really young kids would need more than that. There ARE high chairs, but they run out closer to game time. There isn't a kids' menu for breakfast.\\nAs for the food, the choices are limited (see photo) but the prices are good and the portions are big. Everything is just about as big as your head. Pancakes are easily 12\\" across. They were just ok. The 4 egg omelet was fluffy and stuffed full. The ham was more like deli meat though...so keep that in mind. The tachoes are a huge bowl of goop. Share with everyone at your table. Or be really stuffed. If you wish to exercise restraint, you can order everything ala carte. Eggs over medium came out right and a side of bacon was decent. Not anything fancy, but it all serves its purpose if you want breakfast at a bar. The Bloody Mary bar is a good value. $5 and you get to put whatever garnishes and mix ins you want. They bring you a glass with vodka and a salted rim. The rest is up to you. They also do a mimosa bar. Lots of frozen fruits to put in your drink. \\nOur server was really great.

I've made excuses for the food time after time but it comes down to a few negative things: the Chinese food is greasy. I'm all for hangover-killing, Saturday night greasy Chinese food but this is too much. The fried rice is always full of oil and clumped in blocks after refrigeration. The boneless spareribs are good when they're fresh & hot but the next day- a block of solid fat. The last straw was a few nights ago, we ordered takeout including a half Peking Duck and it was next to inedible. What a waste. I think the duck had been dunked in fat prior to packing it up to re-warm it before packing and the skin was awful. Crispy but icky with oil. Even the duck meat was tasteless and unappetizing, and a small portion as well for half a duck compared to other local restaurants.\\n\\nThe Japanese side of the menu has always been more pleasing to me, as the fish is fresh and a good selection.

It was fine. It wasn't anything exceptional in either direction - a little lacking in texture, but not too much to still enjoy more or less. It was about 10 dollars though, which considering the unremarkableness, is a little steep. The fries were a little disappointing - they were really greasy and the after the top layer on the plate, were so broken up and over-greasy they weren't really edible. They are sprinkled with parsley, which is a nice, fresh counterbalance, but like I said, they need to work on the greasy issue.

Please feel free to comment on what I have to say as even their phone, which they seem to not answer much, especially when they are open, says that they will be opened on their last day, June 15, 2013 for brunch, and that is it!\\n\\nOK, let me ask you this, when you leave a message to your faithful following of brunch, what does that mean, give me a time frame that I can work with, no messages left, no one answering the phone and allowing it to go to a recorded message, fine you want to play that game. I arrive at the restaurant at 1:40 PM (does this seem to be in the realms of brunch?). We get in here, and it's not packed, there are some tables left, I saw the kitchen still working at this time, their pans weren't hung and cleaned and ready to close shop. The female who saw us said that \\"the kitchen is closed\\" really, I still see moving souls back there. \\n\\nThere is something about having a sign that either dictates your hours, outlined in black and white, or a tacky neon sign, that when 'ON' states your opened, and when 'OFF' tells you to get the hell away and find other options to satisfying your hungry food compactor. We tried to phone their number while waiting in their gravel filled parking lot, and the same message stated they were serving brunch. I just did a couple searches of the term 'Brunch' and added 'what usual times' in the search menu, from 2pm to 3pm and sometimes 5pm, I remember before pulling out of the lot, not hoping the gravel hit the side of the restaurant (or was I hoping), that it was 1:47pm!\\n\\nThe place inside is, in a better word, cute. Filled with bright colors, a joyous place to be in eating breakfast, lunch, or brunch (remember brunch ends before 1:40pm in their books!), somewhere I believe I would be comfortable eating, with an open kitchen concept. This is a sunny place, and it should be as the prices aren't cheap in here!\\n\\nNot the best part of town, more known for a filming of 'Rumble in the Bronx' by Jackie Chan, with interesting human being that roam the streets, some maybe zombie like.

They're not wanting you to stay a while and relax (take a look at \\"why\\" they don't serve coffee) and need to turn tables quickly because of the limited space.  The atmosphere is loud and the expectation is that the dining is close to fine, but its not.  The lamb popsicles are are straight out of the 80's with their mint and fruit mixture, the bread is not fresh, (and if it's made on-site, I'll eat my words) the fruitti di mare had a ton of sand, the shrimp were overcooked, the squid was tough as nails but the brasato was on-it.  That one dish brought this place from 0 stars to 2.  I'd suggest learning how to clean and cook different ocean critters properly before charging 27.00 for something with a mouthful of sand.

Next was the spring roll...this one threw me for a loop as I thought this would come with the meal or at least after the soup...it didn't really matter because it was not a very good spring roll anyway. The soup arrived shortly after and it was much different than any other wonton soup I had ever eaten. Typically you have a clear broth and wontons...that's it. This rendition had added some other elements which would have been fine if it hadn't tasted similar to a salt cube dissolving in my mouth. \\n\\nFinally the entr√©e. The portion was plenty, good amount of chicken, and the taste of the curry was spot on. The only problem was that the onions were undercooked.

We were having a small reunion, and so I had made a reservation for 7 people.\\n\\nMost of the dinner went smoothly. The sushi was good and we had a good time. The only reason why I'm giving it two stars is mainly because of our waitress. She had a lot of attitude and not only was telling us to order less, but also talked about us to her coworker very loudly, occassionally glancing over. My friends and I all thought we were being too loud, and so we toned it down, but it seems like she was mainly annoyed at us for ordering a lot. We didn't leave any food behind, and when it came to the check, we paid partly with cash and partly with card.\\n\\nThis is where my problem was with her. She not only was not that great of a waitress because of the constant glares, she had the nerve to linger near the table and look at her tip. She opened the book and then showed a very horrible expression, and then went to her friend and complained loudly. She then had the nerve to COME back to the table and ask \\"is everything okay? Because I think I deserve more tip than this.\\" And then poorly explain that there wasnt enough tip in there. We had placed the rest of the tip on the table, because it was in cash and also because I've NEVER in my life seen a waiter come and look at the tip like that. I almost just took the remainder on the table and pocketed it because that was the most ridiculous thing I have ever seen. I always tip around 20% or more because I know waiting tables is difficult, but she is the first person I met that I actually considered giving much less.\\n\\nLong story short, the food is pretty good and the location is alright, but the service that we had recieved today was completely horrendous, so much that it had ruined the relatively nice experience.

While it did take a bit too long to get, it was perfect. Ate every bite. Server while not engaging was matter of fact about it and no issues. The manager checked in with the table, but not with me.

Wonderful combination of a little heat, a little sweet from the pineapple, and some crunch and depth from onions.  The rice was gorgeous, perfectly done, as was the added egg scrambled in.

Second sip, still strong coffee, I was trying hard to search that familiar taste of the pistachio, oh yes, then that nutty flavor gradually emerge but not so strong... I was still debating whether what I tasted was pistachio. I thought I know that distinct flavor as I love pistachio, but I guess I don't know it well to tell the difference. \\n\\nWell, the drink tastes good but would like to try a version with stronger pistachio flavor, wondering what would that sparkles. It is interesting to me that the cafe is Moroccan influenced. Would love to explore and learn more about the culture, so surely will return and try other things in their menu.

Everyone was always so freindly and nice and willing to go ou of thier way to help you and give you what you needed. \\nI dont know what went wrong. I have been ordering from this place for ever and no, it wasnt that great but it is close to my house..therfore its convienent. They have pecials on pizza on Mon. and Wed. 2.99 for  a small, and they are wicked good.\\n\\nSo the last four tmes I have ordered from this place they have screwed up my order. I must be some kind of idiot becuase I keep going back. I specifically ask for EXTRA mayo on my sub and instead i get NO MAYO. Im sorry but since when does extra mayo mean none whatsoever. Meanwhile, I am at my house eating my sub literally choking it down, so fregon misrable and angry that they forgot my mayo. I call them and tell them and they bascially tell me too bad. (and ya I could put my own mayo on but it doesnt have the same delicious taste as sub shop mayo)\\n\\nSo the next time I order my sub I ask for extra mayo and a side of mayo as well just in case they forget to put it on. Low and behold, these morons forget it AGAIN. So I am left choking and suffocating,  rearranging my sub so I can get pickle in each bite and lessen the blow, its like trying to down a cotton ball. I really starting to think that extra mayo means none at all. Maybe next time I should order it with no mayo. \\n\\nWell anyways, to get away from the mayo subject which has continully angered me for weeks now, I will tell you about the quality of their food. \\nThe subs..suck. The sub rolls I swaer ALWAYS taste stale. I dont know why, but I think they are buying day old bread from somewhere to save money cuz there is no other explanation as to why my sub roll is ALWAYS dry and on the verge of being unedible. The portions of meat and vegetables they put on are fregon hilarioius. Its like one slice of each. I could make a better sub at home. Oh ya and dont ever order a meatbll sub, they used to be good, now its like chewing on a piece of rubber. There pizza is probably the only edible thing there. \\n\\nThe staff is filled with a bunch of immature high school kids that I just want to slap in the face and tell them to shut the fuck up and hope they get my order right.  I wonder which one of them keeps forgetting my god damned mayo. \\n\\nWell all in all damatas reallywent down hill, and they cannot seem to put together an order correctly, no matter how many times I have them repeat it back to me, and SPECIFICALLY tell them they forgot my mayo last time so make sure they remember it this time. Oh ya and they have two different types of fries, order the crispy ones if you eat there cuz the other ones are gross, and If you order a dinner ask themto put on more han FOUR o rangs as they like to rip you off and slap on a measly amount. JERKS. \\n\\nAll in all I would say that you could ..no CAN get a better meal at the homeless shelter, and not only will it taste better it will be more filling. Trust me, I know.

She was even sweeter in person and made sure my order was correct and fresh. She was also very knowledgeable about the business and since I'm moving, told me the locations in my new state. I don't like to complain at restaurants since I too know there are nasty people out there who only complain and take their frustration out on employees because they know in today's day and age, they can get away with it.

We get seated at a great table by the window and immediately are brought the best bread I have ever had in my life. The crust was browned and crisp but the inside was soft and warm. The smell of the bread alone is worth a trip here. I'm not exaggerating. \\n\\nAfter a house salad of fresh greens and light balsamic dressing, we decided to split the Crazy Alfredo. One of the best decisions of my life. I can't even describe to you how good this dish was. The pasta is obviously homemade and you could taste it. Perfectly al dente and very flavorful. The sauce was liquid gold. The cheese mixed with just the right amount of spices made it by far the best alfredo I've ever had. The dish had chicken, sausage, and prosciutto in it and they did not skimp at all on the meat. If it was socially appropriate to pick up the bowl and lick it clean I would have. It was THAT GOOD. Also, the servings are ginormous. My friend and I split this and we were stuffed with no leftovers. Let's review: GO HERE FOR THE BEST ITALIAN IN THE NORTH END.\\n\\nIt was so good that we had to go back on our last day in town before our flight home. We were in Boston 4 days and came here twice. The second time we went, we shared the Meatball appetizer which came with 4 giant meatballs baked in their traditional red Sicilian sauce and covered in Mozzarella. Combine this with the amazing bread mentioned above and you are in heaven. The meatballs were soooooo good. Dense and hearty yet still somehow airy and light. We then split the Carbonara pasta. Again, giant portion of homemade pasta full of prosciutto and an amazing smokey, creamy sauce. So good. We took the leftovers home on the plane and ate them that night in Denver. If I had to choose, I'd say I probably enjoyed the Crazy Alfredo a bit more than the Carbonara. \\n\\nThis place was unbelievably delicious but even more than that, the owner, waitresses and cooks made us feel like a part of the family. When we walked in for our second meal here, they immediately recognized us from the first time we came in a few days earlier. They was so welcoming and inviting. \\n\\nI literally almost never write Yelp reviews (and never this long) but Carmelina's of the North End is worth it.

Boring cheese and mostly prosciutto.  I don't like prosciutto.  I have eaten charcuterie all over this city.  The price of this one was competitive with the others, but no comparison in terms of quality.  Big bummer.\\n\\nFast forward three months and I find myself back at this place.  My boyfriend ordered the charcuterie again and it was the exact same deal.  Boring brie and cheddar., two piles of fatty prosciutto and salami.  No pate.  Nothing special at all.  \\n\\nI also ordered Oysters Rockefeller - a classic appetizer that includes garlic, spinach and parmesan cheese.  When the plate arrived, I was quite intrigued by the neon green color.  What spinach is neon green?  I took my first bite and was slapped in the face with a enormous amount of salt.  So disappointing.  Three out of the four gone to waste.\\n\\nAdding insult to injury, the music being played was just awful.

In his defense, I posted it.  My reply is below as well.\\n\\nHi Kim, \\n\\nI am the owner/chef of Damiano that allegedly yelled and screamed at you and your date and everyone else that night. I was going to let it go until I saw that you continue to slam me to Devra First on Dining Chat. Do you have a personal issue with me? I was cordial and nice to both of you. My daughter and staff were completely shocked at your yelp review. They could not believe your allegations. We were happy to accomodate you that late in the evening and we didn't rush you at all, like many other places would have. There was no yelling at anyone. I find it hard to believe that you would speak untruths, but then again, I don't know you. You were both thinking about the edamame and that's why I sent it complimentary. And believe it or not, even in \\"piattini\\" style, the food should be brought to you in a certain order, with the sea bass being the last dish. BTW you did not cut into the seabass, it was intact. As far as texting goes, it was late at night and Prezza needed to borrow some food form us because they were short. I never yell at my daughter, She is the most precious and important person in my life. I can let your review go right by me and not bother me. Please do not slander me or my daughter and please stop this nonsense. Let it go. You don't like my restaurant, that's fine. But please do stop the lies. I have a full staff and a daughter that were all here that night. I joked and thought i was being not only pleasant but making sure I served you the best food and that you received it in the proper way, as I always do. Nonetheless, you were a paying customer and I would be happy to make it up to you if you ever decide to come back. You can reach me via this system.\\n\\nThank you, \\n\\nDamien\\n\\nDamien,\\n\\nI'm someone who dines out frequently.  I sometimes Yelp about it, but I almost always chat on boston.com.  I give positive reviews and I give negative reviews, depending on my experience.  I have eaten at some of the finest restaurants in the world, and some of the worst.  I hold no personal grudges, and I approach each with an open mind.  \\n\\nAs you can read in my Yelp review, I said I enjoyed the food at your restaurant.  Actually, I said our last two course were \\"undeniably delicious\\".  While I was somewhat disheartened by the risotto, I cannot deny that it had amazing flavor.  I also said you had a great and reasonably priced wine list, and that the service was friendly.\\n\\nI never said that your staff rushed us, and I wouldn't expect any restaurant to do so, whether we got there a half house before the kitchen closed or a few minutes before it did so.\\n\\nPerhaps our definitions of yelling are different (I come from a soft-spoken English family), but I fondly remember you calling over loudly to your servers demanding to know who brought us the dish.  I also did not say that you yelled AT your daughter; I said you yelled TO her.  I'm sorry if you took offense to my wording, although I did find it inappropriate that you would give her food that had sat in front of us.  As someone with past restaurant experience, I would have been fired on the spot for doing that in front of a diner.\\n\\nAs far as the sequence of courses, it has also been my understanding that small plates are presented as they are cooked.  I did some quick research and found that others are under the same impression.  The following quote from food writer Kathryn Matthews was featured on Portfolio.com, the website of worldwide magazine publishing company, Conde Nast (responsible for food magazines such as Bon Appetite and Gourmet):\\n\\n\\"Another valuable benefit is that small plates are served on an \\"as ready\\" basis (rather than sequentially like a traditional meal)\\" (http://www.portfolio.com/culture-lifestyle/culture-inc/food-drink/2007/03/24/The-Big-Business-of-Small-Plates).\\n\\nI believe that you love your daughter and was in no way intending on slandering either of you.  I merely gave my review based on the experience I had that night.  I don't believe that I insulted her in any way.  I gave an honest review, as I always do.  However, in your defense, I will post your message to me under my review so that other readers hear both sides of the story.\\n\\nOnce again, I sincerely apologize if you took offense as that was not my intention.\\n\\nRegards,\\nKim"},{"name":"Veggie Galaxy","address":"450 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"We dare anyone, vegan or not, to eat here and tell us it's not awesome.

The wifi also got an upgrade, so I will work here on occasion. \\n\\nThe first time I went to Tilt, it was during lunch. The line was only about 10 people deep, but after waiting for 20 minutes I decided to leave. I guess they had computer problems and were taking orders by hand, but I still don't see why it took 20 minutes to get through the line. \\n\\nThe second time I got to order just fine. The chocolate cream pie was actually quite good. I would definitely recommend it ordering it to go. \\n\\nHowever, the rest of the experience leaves a lot to be desired. They have spotty wi-fi and really loud music that echoes off of all of the hard surfaces. The thing that made me decide not to go back, however, was the toilets. \\n\\nThat might be weird, but it was among worst bathroom experiences I've ever had. First of all, the bathroom is dark - kinda like something you'd see in the Saw movies. Just scary, since all of the surfaces are steel and reflect this eerie light. \\n\\nSpeaking of steel surfaces, the toilet itself is also made of steel. With no cushion. I got the shock of my life when I sat down and realized that the toilet was FREEZING cold. On top of that, the rim is curved inward, so I actually felt like I was falling in. \\n\\nOn the plus side, they have a ping-pong table, which I love. \\n\\nAltogether, there are a lot of places to hang out and work in Portland.

The menu consists of sandwiches that range from $10-16 and entrees from $20-$40. I had the grilled salmon and immediately, no regrets! Some of the best salmon I've had. A solid portion of salmon served over sauteed spinach on a bed of mashed potatoes and then a sweet BBQ glaze. Yeah the glaze is unusual, but it gives it the perfect flavor it needs.

Or vegetarians for that matter (unless they really, really like plantains). Come for the meat, stay for the live music. \\n\\nFood: Midwest has many of the popular features of American Brazillian restaurants including a salad bar and a meat service where giant skewers are brought to your table, slices are carved off, and you can pick up your share with tongs as the cut is finished. Despite its name, the salad bar is not vegetarian friendly. Items at the salad bar include sweet plantains, chicken wings and drumsticks, rice, a meat stew, salad, corn on the cob (seems frozen), chocolate pudding, and salsa among others. The meats include the regular lamb, beef, pork, and sausages, but also include whole chicken hearts and fresh baked garlic rolls. The rolls are to die for: crispy on the outside, warm and doughy on the inside with just the right amount of garlic for flavor. After the meal, cheesecake, chocolate mousse, flan, or cake can be chosen for dessert. The chocolate mousse looks amazing and comes in a chocolate shell although the other desserts are pretty good too. The quality is not super high here, but if what you're looking for is quantity then you might as well set up a tent in the kitchen.\\n\\nService: The meats come by fairly regularly, but the waitresses here seem to like taking their time. You won't be able to start until you receive a meat card from a waitress. To keep the meat coming to the table, leave the card with the green side up. If you want to stop and get dessert/ the check, turn it over.  I think you can also get takeout from the salad bar. \\n\\nAtmosphere: The live music and ranch-themed decor are incredible and complement the meal well. There is, however, one downright nasty thing about Midwest. One of the tables butts up against the women's bathroom. I wouldn't have cared much if not for the fact that I spent my entire dinner at that particular table watching (and smelling) people go in and out of the bathroom with various expressions of urgency and/or relief on their faces. Not appetizing in the least. \\n\\nSynopsis: Coming here takes careful planning as it won't be worth it unless you've basically starved yourself beforehand. Carnivores, rejoice.

Our server was very attentive and answered our questions about the menu.  My husband and I had had the Midnight Train (brilliant!), which consists of a nice big waffle and four of the biggest fried chicken wings I've ever seen in my life.  They were, in a word, delicious.

I got ribs and a pulled pork sandwich.  In spite of being their namesake, the ribs were just ok.  Somewhat tough and yet still had large pieces of fat on them. \\n\\nI didn't see a smoker when I was there and I asked him about his setup and he said he does everything on a grill (see my photo) with hardwood charcoal.  Because it's a grill and not a smoker, my guess is that the the ribs are being cooked at too high a temp; a lot of the fat hadn't rendered out and the meat hasn't been tenderized enough, and that makes them tough.  They also didn't have enough smoke flavor and no tell-tale smoke ring.  Still tasty, but not truly amazing.\\n\\nHis sauce is great and made the pulled pork sandwich.  It has a good smoke flavor with a little tang and a little heat that's well balanced.\\n\\nMy second trip there I got the BBQ chicken and collard greens and that was definitely the way to go.  The chicken was great: flavorful, cooked perfectly, and very juicy.  And the sauce goes perfectly on it.   It's the best BBQ you're going to get in the Northeast.

The side tables for two were full, but three tables for four were open. We were told there would be about 20 minutes of waiting as we stared at the empty tables. \\n\\nApparently they were expecting large crowds to swarm the place at any moment. \\n\\nThe place is unevenly decorated. A brief flirtation with art deco gave way to a more Denny's-like aesthetic: laminated menus with gaudy close-ups that look as delicious as they are excessive. Ridiculously named waffles and other sweets are topped with more sweets. \\n\\nBut the extensive drinking chocolate menu was promising. We ordered an individual dark chocolate fondue and the darkest drinking chocolate we could find. \\n\\nThe drinking chocolate arrived first. It came in an enormous brandy snifter, rimmed with chocolate, and a chocolate mixing agent. You are supposed to mix the hot drinking agent with the melted dark chocolate to create something drinkable. \\n\\nThe fondue came a lot later, for some reason. They had to cut the fruit I guess because it certainly wasn't to make that cut up brownie or waffle. The melted chocolate came in a pot of which only the top quarter is filled with chocolate. Is there a candle underneath the rest? or is this just an unnecessary and kind of petty deception? \\n\\nVerdict: The chocolate, both the drinking and the fondue, pretty much tasted the same even though the drinking chocolate had an origin and even a tasting profile. I'm guessing that's all just for show and that all of the chocolate probably tastes the same. The dark drinking chocolate was around 80%, but you wouldn't know because there was so much fat in it. It just tasted sticky, like having peanut butter in your mouth. \\n\\nThe fondue came with bits of fruit that wasn't too ripe, and a cut up brownie that was dry. The surprising thing was that for a place that serves chocolate, that brownie barely tasted like it had chocolate or cacao powder in it. It definitely is not made in-house. The waffle tasted like a soggy pancake cut up. \\n\\nEach of these items is about ten bucks. Pretty cheap for the quantity, since it's not a place of exceptional quality. \\n\\nDon't go here.

Items I tried off the menu:\\n\\nBeef kabob\\nSausage kabob\\nSquid kabob\\nTofu kabob\\nChicken heart kabob\\nChicken Jane kabob\\nBamboo root kabob\\nFish tofu kabob\\nWood ears (fungus) kabob\\nWinter melon kabob\\nYu choy kabob\\nSpicy sliced beef appetizer\\nSpecial Chinese dough entree\\n\\nThe kabobs were spicy, salty, and oily.  Similar to Tasty China, Te Wei makes use of Sichuan peppercorns in their cooking, so you get not only the spicy sensation, but a numbing sensation as well.  I love it.  The kabobs are served in both a metal container and on styrofoam plates.  The bottom of the metal container has a lot of sauce and oil from all the kabobs.\\n\\nThe sausage kabob tasted almost like hot dog.  The fish tofu kabob has fish inside of the tofu pieces (this kabob was featured in Creative Loafing's \\"100 Dishes to Eat in Atlanta Before You Die\\" released last week).  The chicken heart and chicken Jane kabobs were small, chewy, and rubbery.  The wood ears were fluffy.  The winter melon and yu choy kabobs were basically those vegetables stir-fried and stuck on a stick.\\n\\nThe beef kabob was probably the best tasting of the lot.  However, my favorite dish was not any of the kabobs, but the spicy sliced beef.  This is something you can also order at Tasty China and Gu's Bistro (as well as previously Cafe 101) up the street.  They are cold, thin slices of marinated beef in a spicy Sichuan oil.  Delicious!\\n\\nThe special Chinese dough entree was written into the menu in Chinese characters.  I have no idea what you call it.  I think the owner pronounced it \\"hua jin\\" - she said one of the words means \\"twin.\\"  I didn't like it too much.  It was just dough wrapped together with a few spring onion slices inside.  Not flavorful at all.  Also note they do not serve rice here.\\n\\nThe restaurant itself is small, brightly lit, and clean.  They have flatscreens on either wall playing recorded Chinese variety shows.  Some of the tabletops are glass so you can see right down to the floor.  Te Wei is a unique Chinese restaurant to Atlanta.  Know what you're coming here for (kabobs), otherwise you may leave feeling unsatisfied or still hungry, even if you do order a lot of kabobs."},{"name":"TR Fire Grill","address":"7015 S Semoran Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Very attractive place with a modern rustic look. Let's get the negative out of the way, because this place is good. \\nIt needs a slight decor shifting. It's mostly very nice, but the bottle display over the bar is more night clubish, the staff clothing is more roadhouse, some of the wood choices is do not work with the place, and it needs more on the walls. That being said, it's a very attractive place. \\nQuality food at a good price. We very much liked the eggs and bacon appetizer, deviled eggs and a fantastic strip of pork belly bacon. \\nWe both got the pork sandwich which was good. \\nThe place is new and deserves to do well. Hope it does."},{"name":"Chipotle Mexican Grill","address":"4700 Kingsway, Suite 2200","city":"Burnaby","stars":"3","text":"I often passed by Chipotle in a long line up and today was my very first visit here. Came with my buddy A around 4PM and so lucky not seeing line up at that time. \\n\\nI got Carnitas($8.95) on a bowl with Guacamole($2.21 extra) and the food was freshly made! I got a to-go box and so did my friend since the portion is so big to finish. Good thing, we did! I really like the pricing and portion and how you choose from burrito/bowl/tacos or salad for the same price.\\n\\nI don't get the negative reviews here and will go back next time. Hopefully I don't see the super long line up during lunch. Going to avoid peak hours for the next time too, just so I get my table to sit. No wonder Chipotle is often busy whenever I go to Metrotown."},{"name":"Beau Jo's - Boulder","address":"2690 Baseline Rd","city":"Boulder","stars":"3.5","text":"I was there 20 minutes ago and it was so disappointing! This was my first time there and I went with my family. We order chips and salsa to snack while they were making the pizza, and the literally just gave us salsa out of a can and chips out of a bag, the worst part is that they charge us 4.99 for that garbage. The pizza was ok but overpriced as everything there. Needless to say all my family was not happy and we will never return to this place!"},{"name":"Grand Chinatown","address":"21 Billings Rd","city":"Quincy","stars":"2.5","text":"This place is really good, clean and spacious, and the portion of food is in very decent size.

It has a little bit of everything in it and the taste is perfect with an asian feel but very comforting.  The waiter was entertaining and the decor is very nice with an extensive menu.   My favorite part though was the type in the drink menu saying that all the Zombies are made of run."},{"name":"Dirty Martin's Place","address":"2808 Guadalupe St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I had heard a lot of good things about this place, so I decided to try it out.\\n\\nI went with my girlfriend, and we tried the dirty nachos as an appetizer. They were AMAZING. Had high hopes for the burger.\\n\\nThe burger itself was very bland. It was obvious that no seasoning had been put on the burger at all (not even salt or pepper), and they put what seemed like a pound of mayo on there to make up for it. My girlfriend got the top sirloin sandwich, and it was better, although the \\"toasted\\" bun was completely burnt on the bottom.\\n\\nMaybe we just went there on a bad day, but the food was beyond disappointing. Might consider going back for the nachos, but it's definitely not near the top of my list."},{"name":"Veggie Galaxy","address":"450 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Yes!! I'm so excited about having a delicious veg*n diner in Cambridge! Although, if I lived any closer to it, I'm sure I would be pretty much handing them my paychecks I would want to eat here so often.\\n\\nI came here for brunch with Jeff the other day. I ordered a veggie burger with a ton of toppings and onion rings. He got an extremely decadent stuffed french toast with home fries on the side. I really enjoyed my burger, but was somewhat jealous of Jeff and his french toast, so we shared a bit.\\n\\nVeggie Galaxy makes everything on their menu vegan, and they definitely have many hallmarks of an Ideal Diner. They may not be open 24/7, but they serve free refills on your coffee, have breakfast all day, and the decor to match. Add to this an amazing looking case of dessert (unfortunately, I was too full to partake), and you have one of my favorite new eateries in the Boston area."},{"name":"Bin 26 Enoteca","address":"26 Charles St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"really enjoy the wine selection, delicious past and always friendly service. we keep coming back"},{"name":"Nick's Deli & Restaurant","address":"750 Washington Ave","city":"Revere","stars":"4","text":"I went here today ordered a steak bomb.

We order a lot of food to go almost every Sunday night. Always a variety of Dim Sum off of the Chinese menu and never disappoints. Steamed Shao Mai, Boiled shrimp dumplings, soup dumplings (Xiao long bun) & Boiled Pork Dumplings amongst others. \\nAuthentic & much better and fresher than \\"the other\\" place in Dublin.  \\nHelen is Awesome and very accommodating. \\nWe also get the \\"Spicy Salt & Pepper Squid which is fantastic and never rubbery or mushy by the time we get it home. \\nStir fry fish fillet, Szechwan fish fillet is huge and delicious if you can handle the heat.  \\nHelen will even let you order additional frozen dumplings to take home, throw in the freezer and snack on throughout the week. All it takes is 5 minutes in some boiling water and you get all the joys of a quick meal without even leaving you home.  Next time your in the mood for Amazing, authentic delicious Chinese food this is he place. \\nJust remember to check out the Chinese menu. \\nOn another note Little Dragon which used to be pretty good has new owners with a new menu that makes Panda Express seem good so you have nothing to loose."},{"name":"Arugula","address":"2785 Iris Ave","city":"Boulder","stars":"3.5","text":"Food is mediocre. Service is awful. This is the second time in a row I have received awful service. The servers are inattentive. We sat there for a long time before getting served. Our wine glasses sat empty and we had to get the server's attention every time we wanted something. The server walked by us multiple times without even acknowledging us. I gave Arugula a second chance and was disappointed with the service again. I will not be dining there again."},{"name":"Raja Indian Restaurant","address":"2955 Peachtree Rd NE, Ste A2","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Do yourself a favor and avoid this place at all costs! We dined here tonight and had a miserable experience. Since it's an Indian restaurant, I expected below average service, but Raja lowered the bar even more. We waited ten minutes before anyone came to the table, and our server had to be reminded to bring us water. We ordered while he was there, as it seemed unlikely that he would ever return. Then we waited. And waited. And waited. For 45 minutes. The food finally arrived - very average, not particularly hot, and with minimal apology or explanation for the protracted delay. Also no offer to discount our bill - typical. I can't remember the last time that I tipped $0 at a restaurant, but tonight I did. Raja is a total and utter disgrace and should close down if it can't meet the basic standards of a full service restaurant. We will NEVER return, and I sincerely advise anyone reading this to find ANYWHERE else to eat."},{"name":"Rosa Mexicano","address":"155 Seaport Blvd","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Guacamole and queso fundido were both good. Drinks were a mixed bag. Very pricey for Mexican food but considering you are paying for the real estate it is comparable to other places in the area. Some of the margarita's end up getting around the $15 dollar mark. I had a El Mezcalito which was described as a strawberry margarita that was smoky, it was light on the strawberry and heavy on the smoke, not so good. The service was good by the waiter but the kitchen and bar was very slow with the alcohol and food."},{"name":"L'Atelier","address":"1739 Pearl St","city":"Boulder","stars":"4","text":"This place was recommended to us by our hotel concierge. We were very excited for dinner here as the menu looked delicious.\\n\\nI really wish I didn't have to give this place one star, because the food was decent. The service, however, could not have been worse. We had dinner reservations, but when we got there the hostess said there was no table available inside. We could either wait or sit outside. It was a beautiful night so we said we wouldn't mind sitting outside. \\n\\nWe sat there for about ten minutes, nobody approached our table until my fianc√© went back inside to ask for someone to come out and wait on us. Someone finally came out with bread and water and said our waiter would be right with us. Five minutes later, our waitress comes out and asks for drinks. Fianc√© ordered an ice tea. Another ten minutes later, no iced tea. I flagged down another waiter and told him we had been waiting for his ice tea for awhile now and we're ready to order. He did not apologize at all for our wait, but took our order and said the ice tea would be right out.\\n\\nI kid you not, this restaurant was so oblivious to the fact that there were patrons sitting outside. My fianc√© had to go inside AGAIN to ask the hostess for his iced tea. I mean that's just ridiculous. To have to wait over twenty minutes for a freaking iced tea?! I was ready to walk out at that point, but I have never done that before at a restaurant and I was hungry, so I just sucked it up and waited. And waited. And waited.\\n\\nFinally, dinner. Good not great. I got the roasted chicken and my fianc√© got the lobster ravioli. For the price and terrible service, I wouldn't say it was worth it. They checked on us once after delivering our meals, and it took forever to get our check.\\n\\nI get it, on a Saturday night it gets busy. But a restaurant should never ignore patrons if they seat them outside. It's such a shame because we had only one night visiting Boulder and we had such a horrible dinner experience.  My advice, save your money and time and go elsewhere."},{"name":"Pho Tau Bay","address":"10782 148th Street","city":"Surrey","stars":"4","text":"Yummy and well priced.

The paneer was warm and delicious and the pakora added a nice crispy texture to the paneer.\\n\\nLamb saag - didn't look like much at first but it ended up being very filling. The lamb was tender and tasty. I'm also a sucker for saag so I really enjoyed that as well.\\n\\nMasala Dosai - good start to the meal; flavorful but not too filling.\\n\\nThe service was good and the food was reasonably priced and more authentic than that of other Indian restaurants in the area.
