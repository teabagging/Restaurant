Here are my quick thoughts on each attraction, along with wait times:\\n\\nShrek 4-D:  Some funny lines but overall not that impressive.  Rest of my group really thought it was a waste.  No major motion in the ride.  15 min wait.\\n\\nDespicable Me: We all really enjoyed this ride (even though none of us have seen the movie), and it had some fun motion.  1 hour wait.\\n\\nMagic Show: This was a 15 minute magic show and it was enjoyable.  Recommend it for adults and kids. No wait.\\n\\nHorror Make-up show:  This was entertaining, as I enjoy horror movies.  It is a mix of movie clips and live action.  It actually has a lot of comedy in it.  No wait.\\n\\nTwister:  The intro videos as you go from room to room were quite boring.  And the TVs were old-style tube TVs (why not upgrade to HDTV?).  The actual show itself was fun though, especially at the end when the fire and damage occurs.  30 min wait.\\n\\nMummy: Very entertaining indoor roller coaster.  I don't like roller coasters because of the deep drops, but this one was easy to do (there are no big drops, just a lot of speed).  1 hour wait.\\n\\nDisaster:  Terrible, and a big waste of time.  All of us disliked it.  20 min wait.\\n\\nSimpsons:  Fantastic!  I didn't expect much because I thought it was going to be a kiddie ride.  But it was a really entertaining motion simulator.  All of us loved it, even those that aren't Simpsons fans.  45 min wait.\\n\\nMen in Black:  I didn't get to ride it but the people that went said it was terrible, and a waste of time.\\n\\nRock n Roll Roller Coaster:  I didn't go on this but the group loved it.\\n\\nBeetlejuice Show:  Pretty cheesy, with a lot of dated references (e.g. Pamela Anderson, Paris Hilton).\\n\\nOverall, there are some fun rides.  But like others have stated, Universal Studios is definitely showing its age.  I was disappointed by the value overall, since tickets are so expensive.

Sea Thai, or South East Asia Thai, if you were to refer to this little Thai joint found in a strip mall on 50 by its full name, is a delicious go-to Thai spot near downtown Orlando. Be sure to check its hours of operation before heading over because the last thing you want to do is show up, stomach growling out of control, to find it closed for the after lunch before dinner re-group.  Its decor is cute with strings of white Christmas lights covering its ceilings year round for a festive atmosphere. Thai being one of my favorite types of food I can be critical of its consistency. Sea Thai always comes through. Start with an appetizer, the spring rolls and fried crab cheese are delicious. And I guarantee you'll want extra helpings of sweet duck sauce that accompanies them. For your main entry try the Cashew Nut Chicken or Drunken Noodles, a spicy take on traditional pad Thai. Most entries come with rice, don't be afraid to ask for a second portion. The wait staff will be happy to oblige. Or if you're luck enough to have some of your main course left over for a late night snack have them throw in some extra rice, I always do.  The main reason I love Sea Thai is the fact that if you like it hot, they make it hot. No qualms against throwing a nose running, face dampening dish together upon request. You have the options of mild, medium, hot, or my can't live without favorite, Thai hot. Thai hot is as hot as it gets. But don't worry if you want an additional kick just to impress your dinner companions. Each table is home to jars of fiery spices both wet and dry to pile on top, even ground peanuts to add a bit of crunch. The service can be spotty, even if you are the only ones in the restaurant, once you get your food they tend to forget you exist. That being said its worth it every time. And the Thai versions of your favorite sing along melodies piping through their sound system is an added bonus, trust me.

Every time we leave shaking our heads, kicking ourselves for not remembering the last time we ate there and said we would never come back. This time is for sure the last time they will ever receive money from us.\\n\\nWe bought the Living Social deal and also found a coupon in the mail so we decided to give it a go. The coupon said not valid with any other coupon and we weren't sure if the Living Social qualified as a coupon so we brought both and were going to ask. If not, no big deal.\\n\\nWe were seated and were looking through the menu and over half of the menu says \\"Not valid for coupons\\". Weird. The waitress walked by and saw both the coupon and LS printout on our table and went into a ranting fit over it! I'm not kidding. It was like a three year olds tantrum over not getting a toy they wanted. She grabbed both of them out of my husband's hand and said very loudly, \\"You can't use together! You can't use together! See? See? Right here!\\" And she pulled out a pen and circled the words on the coupon. Pointing to it and repeating, \\"See? Read right here!\\" So rude and un called for. My husband, who is much nicer than I am, said politely, \\"Thank you for pointing that out. I was going to ask you about that, but I can read and don't need it circled.\\" At that she grabbed both and walked away, without taking our order. \\n\\nAnother 10-15 minutes goes by and she finally comes back to take our order. My husband orders something with steak in it (don't remember exactly what) and she reacts the exact same way! I couldn't believe it! This time it was over the steak not being an option with the LS deal. Then she runs off and brings back the paper she had taken away from us and again circling the no steak part. It was ridiculous. \\n\\nOverall, the service was awful, the food was mediocre at best (my daughters mac and cheese from the kids menu was clearly Kraft Blue Box and i could make it better than they did). \\n\\nBUT THERE IS MORE!!!! After the Living Social deal, our bill came to 8.90 and we were not leaving a tip after that fiasco. We wrote a zero with a line through it in the tip line. A few days later we see in our bank account that our total bill from that night was 12.90. She wrote in her own tip! I couldn't believe it.

So, it might be that this is more of a four star establishment and my personal bias is skewing my rating downward. That being said, I started with the potato pierogi and they were tasty. I prefer my pierogi with a bit of a pan sear to it. These were boiled and reheated so they were a little watery  and not very warm. I progressed to a kelbasa sandwich. The sausage itself was at least 3/4 of a pound, so way more meat than I could eat in a sitting. The roll was good but also quite large, in fact even that monster sausage was swimming in the giganticness of the bun. Also there was a bit too much kraut which made the roll on one side just turn to mush. The menu description mentioned mustard but I didn't taste any, so had to add my own which is okay. The accompanying side of fried potatoes were just okay. The coleslaw was dry and earthy, very coarse cut and not much dressing. Finished all with a hard cider that was refreshing.  Service was just okay, the young man that waited on me was a little over enthusiastic but could not answer any of my questions. Anyway, not sure if I would try again.

It's also BYOB, which I will keep in mind for next time, if there's one. Don't worry if you forgot the brews or vino at home, they have their Salt Lick's Cellars. Keep in mind, that it is CASH ONLY. They do have an ATM as I'm sure more than half of us don't carry more than 0.17 cents in cash. Now, to the good part. Menu is very simple, you can order a la carte or by plates. My wife had the Thurman's choice (pork ribs, sausage and brisket) while I had the pulled pork combo with Pork ribs. I think a plate is more than enough for your typical person, unless you just haven't eaten in a week. The ribs were great, the brisket was ok, the sausage was very good and the pulled pork was probably what my wife and I enjoyed the best. Of course, can't have it dry, have to slabbbb it all up with either of 3 different choices for bbq sauce, which all were good but just nothing WOWing about them.

Once on a busy Saturday and once just now on a quiet Tuesday night. Everyone's got great reviews but the truth must be told. The staff is only nice because they are naive. They have absolutely no knowledge of food or wine, and sadly no knowledge of service whatsoever. They wouldn't know that haddock is from the cod family. The server today had no idea what the Sauvignon Blanc tasted like vs the Chardonnay, and guessed that the Sauvignon Blanc would be more full-bodied, which is almost never the case. First time the salmon was overcooked past medium rare, and took over 30 minutes to come out (it was busy). The second time the salad came out in 20 minutes (it was dead). I was never offered salt or pepper. And you'll surely want it on the Cobb salad. I was more forgiving the first time, thinking these were young Harvard kids just trying to make some spare change. And there was one experienced server who was actually working her butt off, picking up after the kid servers' messes, like an incredibly angry guest at the table next to us. Yes, the first time, it was horrendous for someone else. The girl didn't know that as a server you serve, you don't try to manage a situation, and you definitely don't ignore it otherwise it will escalate, and it did. A big man yelling ain't pretty. Furthermore, that night there were about 4 people who lit up cigarettes around us - less than 2 feet away from our table, almost elbow to elbow. The server gave them permission, which then led to the table next to us lighting up. So much for enjoying a romantic rooftop dinner with the bf; we were inhaling cig smoke for half our dinner. We skipped dessert and skipped out on the bill. Jk, but we wanted to. So today I just didn't get any attention. Server only had me and a 2-top. Accidentally knocked over my glass of water, 10 minutes rolled by without her coming to clean it up, so I went inside and got a rag from the bartender myself and a new drink. \\n\\nIt's too bad, this place is such a great location.

The bartender actually argued me (slightly, not in a mean-spirited way) on the point, and I remained confused.\\n\\nOverall the service was friendly, but you need to deduct points for such complete ignorance of the product from employees that are supposed to be staffing a specialty spot like Lower Depths.\\n\\nANYWAYS, Lower Depths is a lot like this review, confusing. It is a cash only, stainless steel, back-lit, wannabe hipster beer bar that can't decide if it is really a hipster beer bar, or some douchey upscale lounge. The beer selection is solid, the decor is odd, and the prices are a bit steep...maybe a buck or so per bottle above the norm, from what I could tell. At about 9:30 on a Saturday night, it was about 1/2 full, and the crowd was all mid twenties beer swilling locals, some drinking 40's that LD is \\"proud to serve\\", and others playing cards at a corner table. \\n\\nAll in all I was kind of underwhelmed and disappointed in the overall product, and if I return to Lower Depths, it will likely be for one of two reasons....it is close, and I WANT it to work...I really do."},{"name":"Giacomo's Ristorante - Boston","address":"355 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Very small but that gave it the intimate feel.

We went to Surly Girl because I was hungover and I wanted a freaking drink, let's just be honest. I had high expectations, this isn't a place I had been hearing raves about for a few weeks, it was more like for a couple years.\\n\\nSo, we step in to Surly Girl around noon on Saturday, it was semi-busy...

If I were to describe Craigie's carefully crafted and thoughtfully composed cocktail menu, it would be, \\"wowee wow wow.\\"  Over the course of our several hours here we sampled the Flower Sour (bourbon, Cardamaro, lemon, honey and lavender); Never Setter (Szechuan Plymoth, maple, lemon, Barolo Chinato); Northern Lights (St. Germain, scotch, citrus, Bittermens Tiki Bitters); Civilian (Mezcal, orange, lime, date molasses, Thai chile); Root Down (Salers Gentiane, barrel-aged genever, sour orange, Gran Classico); and Ardoise (sage, Rain, juniper, lime).  The last time I was this over the moon about cocktails was more than a year ago at Salt of the Earth in Pittsburgh.\\n\\nThe other bonus of spending time at the bar was chatting with local Bostonians celebrating the start of the weekend and learning about Craigie's top-secret, off-menu hamburger.  \\"They only make like, 18 a night,\\" the Lilly Pulitzer-clad debutante next to me whispered breathlessly.  \\"Once they're gone, they're gone.  Trust me: YOU WANT ONE.\\"  Actually, I didn't want one; I came for the simply irresistible, best whole-roasted chicken Alex Guarnaschelli ever ate.  But it turned out FIL and our friend did and -- once we were seated in our plush booth in the bar area -- ordered them from our server.  \\"You're in luck!\\" she whispered as breathlessly as debutante.  \\"There are only three left!\\"\\n\\nOnce the rest of our party showed up, we were seated at our booth.  I was worried about the potential noise level in the bar, but the hostess informed us there's no standing allowed in Craigie's bar.  Noise really was kept to a minimum and, frankly, our booth seemed to be one of the more comfortable tables in the entire restaurant, with interesting views into Cambridge outside.  It seems we inadvertently scored one of the better tables in the house.\\n\\nSince there were five of us, we decided we could probably sample our way through much of the menu √† la carte.  Each course was beautifully plated and impeccably prepared.  Every bite was elevated by the fact that Craigie sources its food from local farmers and growers, meaning its meats are all-natural, free-range, and humanely raised.\\n\\nBefore we even started servers were setting amuse bouches before us: Sardine Fritters for the ladies, Beef Heart Carpaccio for the boys.  Appetizers soon followed: Ricotta Cavatelli with Mushroom and Boudin rago√ªt, Grilled Spanish Octopus with Cipollini Onions, Bluefin Sashimi with Onion-Shiso Salsa, and Crispy Fried Pigs' Tails.  The cavatelli was rich and chewy, the octopus as tender as a cloud, sashimi buttery soft, and the pigs' tails an extraordinarily crunchy and unctuous treat.  \\n\\nFor entr√©es FIL and friend ordered those famous burgers, which arrived accompanied by some of the thickest, crispiest fries I've ever seen, as well as house made pickles, ketchup and celeraic roulade.  SIL ordered the hangar steak which had great flavor but was unfortunately a touch dry.  Husband and I eagerly requested the Misty Knoll Farms whole-roasted chicken with apricot, chanterelles, and whiskey jus.  A runner presented us with the entire bird tableside before it was carved; after we'd ogled its golden hue and plumpness, it was whisked away for plating.  It was, if I do say so myself, the runaway best of the entr√©es -- including that burger which was good, but didn't impress like we'd expected.  The chicken however was succulent and moist, served atop a subtly sweet apricot pur√©e and earthy mushrooms.  We devoured every bite, and husband even set to work on the carcass, which is also presented if you so desire (\\"Really, it's some of the best meat,\\" our server confided).  I couldn't bring myself to pick at a structure of bones, tho...\\n\\nFor dessert, a sorbet trio of Blackberry, Raspberry, and Yogurt (my favorite of the three for its tartness); Coconut Ice Cream with pumpernickel tuille; espressos for the lame, er, I mean, responsible; and an Islay Smokey Peat Scotch for me.  \\n\\nCraigie's is a fabulous find in Beantown.

The service is wonderful.  The restaurant itself is obviously run by a management and kitchen staff that truly cares about what they are doing.  Their menu avoids run of the mill, intended for those with more adventurous palates.  The wine and beverage lists are inspired and offer as many options as any diner could want.  Their philosophy regarding using local ingredients and minimizing carbon footprint are most commendable.\\n\\nMy companion and I split the assiette of terrines for an appetizer, the pork three ways for two as the main course, and the bittersweet chocolate mousse for dessert.  The wine, a Rh√¥ne, was exemplary.\\n\\nThe dessert was the best course - all kudos to Jessica Scott.\\n\\nThe terrines were well prepared, with appropriate garnishes, and just enough in quantity - like all pat√© they are little bombs of cholesterol and best eaten in moderation.  The problem was the bread.  In bistros all across France, pat√© is eaten with a fresh baguette or on small fairly thin toast points, generally of soft white bread.  At Craigie the accompanying bread were essentially slabs of Texas toast, so dry and voluminous that they completely overwhelmed the poor little pat√©s, which looked miserable spread out on the vast slabs of carbohydrates.  Unless you cut the bread in half width-wise, and then into smaller pieces again - difficult to do with butter knives - it was a stretch to taste anything beyond the toast.  It reduced the appetizer to bread and water, with little hints of the terrines drowned in between.  It probably would have been better to forgo the toast altogether.\\n\\nThe Vermont Pork Three Ways - good God.  What appeared after a fair wait (and unlike many of the other reviewers complaining about such I enjoy lingering at the table with good wine and good company so that wasn't a problem) was a crisply overcooked sparerib alongside what was essentially a plate of undercooked fat.  The pork from the other two preparations of the three ways was both barely cooked and barely 50% of the mass amidst all the untrimmed fat - if I wanted carpaccio and lard I would have requested it.  The side of bone marrow was bland salty fat.  The side of Brussels sprouts were burnt black.  Burnt black Brussels sprouts aren't cutting edge, adventurous, or pushing the envelope.  They are simply burnt black.  When I do that at home, I toss them out and start again.\\n\\nThe main course wasn't just unacceptable and unappetizing - it bordered on inedible.  Not only that; it was so unappetizing that its memory interfered with the enjoyment of other food for the next couple of days.\\n\\nTo finish, I was served two thimblefuls of cognac as a digestif.  Come on, guys, three thimblefuls wouldn't have broken the piggy bank.\\n\\nWe let our disappointment be known to the waiter.  The restaurant responded with immediate grace, the manager coming to the table with apology, removing the main course from the tab and offering a gift certificate in compensation.  Craigie on Main cannot be faulted in any way when it comes to the courtesy of its people.\\n\\nThe fault is in the menu philosophy itself.  Smelts, octopus, pork heart sausage, cox combs, pig tails, pig ears?  Pig's heads and undercooked pig's anything else for main courses?  (Many people ordered the pork three ways that night - they all came out the same raw red with lots of fat).  There's a line between innovative and preciously (and precociously) cute, and somewhere I think that line got crossed at Craigie on Main.  If the philosophy strays too far from emphasis on serving people a good meal at a good price, whether it's at the local diner or a Michelin three-star, then no matter how dazzling the technique and imagination it ends up nothing more than an empty display of that technique.  The fact that the kitchen staff actually believes serving a plate of fat with some almost raw pork as a legitimate dinner item strains credulity.  That's what I thought walking out the door of Craigie on Main at the end of the evening."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"Brisket was superb, turkey was delicious!!

I'll admit when a friend said she wanted to go here for dinner I was extremely skeptical.... really? that place??? I was totally not feeling it. Every time I passed by the bookstore, it looked cramped and slightly claustrophobic - not my idea of a relaxing place to meet up. \\n\\nThe cafe section is a bit cramped with as many tables squeezed in as possible, but the food is so worth it that by the time our selection of teas (both very tasty) arrived I was feeling quite comfortable. We each ordered a sandwich - good, not exceptional - and then came the smoothies. Man were they tasty. I absolutely adore the soy chocolate banana smoothie - kind of like Christmas for lactose intolerant people :-) The fact that they offer free Wi-fi adds to the hidden gem feeling of Trident.

We got our order quickly, which may have been the result of being the only people in the restaurant, but we weren't complaining. The portion size for both the dumplings and the skewers were larger than expected, and definitely delicious.

We were then seated in the dining area, where they had decorated the center of the table with beautiful congratulations confetti. Our waiter was so-so...not particularly talkative or friendly, but he was attentive and efficient. He very well might have assumed we wanted a more private evening and didn't want to interfere...who knows! Either way, the food was absolutely delicious. The salads were nicely dressed, the bread was great, our steaks were cooked perfectly medium rare, and the blue cheese crust was a great addition to my filet! We were then surprised with complimentary glasses of champagne as a last little \\"congratulations on your engagement,\\" which totally sealed the deal for us! \\nI was expecting this meal to be super expensive, judging from the reviews, but it really isn't. They offer a 3-course meal (soup or salad, entree with sauce and side, and dessert - PLENTY of food!) for $40/45. That being said, for those diners who are looking for a cheap $10 steak, this restaurant may not be for you.

Eat the scrumptious free bread and avoid the sandwich and soup lunch special unless you're really craving a soup and sandwich (avoid the tomato soup entirely unless you're planning on dipping your bread in it- it's a bit under-seasoned). Save the typical lunch food for Panera and go for the delicious, tantalizing steak and frites Aquitaine is serving instead.

As big as a commercial fish cannery. Three stories to bounce the sound and the fury of diners feeding on the freshest fish. It's the Vanderbilt Manson with seafood. \\n\\nThere is also a large outside patio for those of you that want the sea breeze or traffic exhaust  to enhance those oysters. Inside there are lots of tables, a Long bar, a Raw bar and even platforms welded to the beams for impatient SRO diners. \\n\\nYes, if you time it wrong you'll wait till you start to smell like fish to be seated.

It is the one where they perform experiments to create uber oysters. An Island Creek as big as Tom Brady's deflated Duke football? Maybe someday. \\n\\nThe Staff: Friendly, warm as a basket of biscuits, engaging, with an encyclopedic knowledge of everything alcoholic as well anything that once swam and swam here. Can't decide? Brother Andrew, Bar and Food Tender will abide. He'll let you taste until your taste buds are pickled along with the rest of you. He suggested a small batch Nine Pin Cider. Perfect. It tasted like apple essence champagne. Too ciderized to order everything your eyes oogled? Let Andrew orchestrate the meal to a crescendo of stellar dishes. \\n\\nThe Vibe: Who goes there? Everyone. The whole building was vibrating (with the chorus of masticating and cutlery against plates). I thought it could really get crazy if the mob dining here had a leader.\\n\\nThe Food: These folks are absolutely passionate about what they serve. Everything is house made, except the fish, of course. Anything smoked, pickled, cured or fermented is done on site and all the fish is responsibly sourced. \\n\\nThe Smoked Scallops were a Geisha's fan of beautiful bivalves. They were still warm from a brief turn in the smoker with a schmear of Tartar Sauce and house pickled Red Onions. Civilized. \\n\\nThe line caught local Tuna Crudo was anything but crude, and oh, so good. Tataki sashimi style over Avocado slivers with a giant swoosh of Black Garlic. Nobu, take note. \\n\\nThe Lettuce Cups (Butter or make that Boston) embraced a crisp juicy Chesapeake Bay Oyster crowned with a dollop of Cayenne Sriracha Aioli that bucked like a 357 Mag and was hot enough to be uncivilized. (I've just described an ideal date, I think). I loved it. Definitely not for children or pregnant women or those planning to be.   \\n\\nThe kitchen has balls. Lot's of them, as there must have been a dozen dudes plating this and that. None of them are bashful about spice but they are also careful not to overwhelm the diner or the dish. This requires a deft hand, or 24 of them. \\n\\nThe Brown Butter Fried Cauliflower with Anchovy Oil. Oh Mommy, so umami. \\n\\nSunday is pasta special night when the chef's get to jam without restriction or a playlist. The Squid Ink Gorganelli (which looked like Licorice Gummy Worms) come with Jonah Crab shreds (oodles of them), razor thin Jalapeno slices, and finally topped with Scallions and a dusting of Pecorino. Who says fish and cheese don't play well together? These do.\\n\\nWhat's for dessert?: Finally, out came a Norman Rockwell slice of Pumpkin Cake with roasted local Apples and a quenelle of Cream along with two glasses of house spiffed Stoneface Choco-Porter mostly because we behaved ourselves, didn't dump anything on the floor, spit up, ooohed and ahhed like stage door johnnie's at an Anthony Bourdain lecture and because we genuinely appreciated everyone's effort to feed us like royalty.

I had a choice of freshly grated parmesan or Romano cheese. Romano is my favorite. Amazing dish. Outstanding.\\nDesert: Tiramisu. Lady fingers and mascarpone cheese soaked in coffee. It was smooth and flavorful. Perfection on a plate.\\nUpon arrival, we were greeted by Rachel Perry, the Assistant General Manager.  She was friendly and happy to see us. I felt like I just arrived at my Grandparents' house.  We were seated and I chose Rocchetta Brioblu, an Italian mineral water which I found more pleasing than San Pellegrino. I found it a gentle sparkling water.   An assortment of olives in olive oil and fresh sliced Italian bread were promptly brought to our table by our enthusiastic, helpful waitress, Kristen.  There is a bank of TVs, all showing a variety of old and new Italian movies.  The list included Bronx Tale, 29th Street, Dolce Vita, Analyze This and The Godfather.  The ambiance was pleasant with modern art lamps hanging from the ceiling and a red rose at every table.  They have an extensive wine and single malt Scotch offering.  There's also a lovely view of Fan Pier in Boston Harbor.

It's a little weird with a dart board in one area, then big TVs mounted in others (i.e. sports bar elements in a charming old home) but I'll take it. woudl eb a good place to catch a baseball game and grab a drink and dinner....We actually ended up sitting outside on one of the picnic tables. \\n\\nThe first thing that caught my eye was the frozen margarita machine with the sign \\"Wine margaritas\\" on it. Now I have no idea what that is, nor did the gal behind the counter, but I can tell you they are tasty. Reminds me a bit of those frozen lemonade thingies at the state fair. they are on the sour side, but not in a fake way. the consistency is not bad either - larger, but uniform frozen bits that stayed frozen all the way to the end. I'm not sure you could enjoy more than one of these without food since they are strongly flavored, but the first half was nice while enjoying the evening air, and the second half complimented my food. \\n\\nI ordered the Nacho Burger, sans bun, add extra patty. Yum! There were tortilla chip bits covered with queso on top, which was awesome (would come back just for the queso), and the guacamole was pretty solid, particularly with the addition of fresh jalapenos. The burger patties were smaller, and a shade overcooked for my taste - but keep in mind I have been recently spoiled by Wholly Cow, so nothing can possible compare. \\n\\nWas torn between 3 and four stars, but what earned this place the extra star were the prices. My burger was 5.99 (well, and 1.50 for extra patty) but I felt it was a good value. My bf's veggie taquitos came 6 high piled in a steaming bowl of goodness, and on Thursdays they are .89 each! Those wine margs were $4, BUT come in a pint glass. \\n\\nIf you pay attention to their specials you can get some really great deals.\\n\\nPS.

While most Tom Yum is medium to light, this seems a little too heavy and almost salty.  You can choose shrimp, tofu or chicken. There is no tomato.   The veggie and pork dumplings are delicious (I like them steamed). I mistakenly thought they rolled their own because they taste fresh.  I called them up only to find out that they buy them.  This was disappointing, but it would not keep me from ordering them again. I found their apps to be quite strong in general. Try the golden bags. \\n\\nThe salads are delicious.

Potbelly's \\"Big Size\\" subs are only 5.50.  They aren't giant or anything, but they're too big for me, and at 5.50 that's definitely cheaper than the two closest sub places to this Potbelly.  The regulars are 4.50, and they suit me fine.  So don't let the price dissuade you from giving it a try.\\n\\nThese aren't the best subs in the world by any means, or even the best subs in Gahanna but there are times they end up craveable.  They  have a pepper relish that I'm really fond of, and added to an Italian Sub you get some kick, though as Paul F. said, they are definitely on the salty side.\\n\\nWhen I decide on Potbelly for lunch or dinner it's almost always for the same reason: the add-ons.  And no, I don't mean adding anything on to the sandwich, but adding on a can of a coke (I don't drink fountain pop), a giant sugar cookie (so good I'm salivating right now) and a bag of salt and vinegar potato chips (nothing to add but didn't want them to be left out).\\n\\nIn addition to those three things, my usual dining partner at this plate really enjoys the giant pickles, though if you don't want it to be sliced into pieces you have to tell them as soon as you order it.\\n\\nIt isn't my favorite sub place by a long shot, but if I'm craving something toasted, with pop, chips and a dessert I can get in and out for under 8 dollars and feel decent about the quality.  \\n\\nOh-- and this place is rarely busy and usually quite clean.

My server was refined and knowledgeable. I ordered the fried goat cheese appetizer with sun-dried tomato and it was very good. My main dish was the meatloaf and in agreement with Colleen B it is wonderful comfort food. My friends ordered burgers and cleaned their plates. We tried to order a milkshake, but they still had not received their milkshake machine, so the owner gave us a card to come back and get a free one next time. In conclusion, one cannot judge a restaurant after only one visit. I will definitely be back. \\n\\nOriginal post- \\n\\nBanana's needs a few more months to get it together. It was obvious from the moment we walked in that Banana's is suffering from the problems and issues that plague most new restaurants. \\n \\nThe problems:\\n- A host staff that does not know what they are doing\\n-Wait time before a server greets the table\\n-The servers need more training in just about everything from how to pour a glass of wine to how many times to ask a table if they are o.k\\n- Loud DJ music \\n-Dry toast and flimsy bacon on the BLT\\n\\nThe problems with Bananas will hopefully be smoothed out with time.

I, for one, did not enjoy my experience here too much and let me explain why..  \\n   We were out at Disney Springs watching an AWESOME Free Daps Freestyle Show last Saturday night that started at 9:30. Around 11:00p.m. we were hungry, and went on the search for food. Most restaurants and shops seemed to be shutting down around this time, yet Raglan Road seemed to just be getting started. Their hours are 11a.m.-2a.m. We checked out the menu out front of the restaurant and they had Fish & Chips. I remember when Disney Springs was Downtown Disney, and I had gone there and had some fabulous Fish & Chips, so seeing it on a menu definitely sparked my interest. My sister was with me, and she doesn't do seafood, but she was game when she saw they had Chicken & Chips. Outside there was a small band playing and we wanted to sit there, but there were no more open seats. We went inside, and it was a bit intense upfront where the band was playing, so we moved a little more towards the back. We were seated in this booth that had walls up around it, and seemed more secluded. That was nice being how loud it was, however the lighting was extremely dim. There was this little lamp up on the wall by our booth that did not illuminate a thing. You had to use your phone just to light up the menu. \\n  Our waitress finally came around after several minutes had passed to get our drink order. My sister ordered an alcoholic drink and asked for \\"Malibu\\" rum. The waitress said they only had \\"Parrot Bay\\". My sister said she didn't like that kind and didn't want it. The waitress then made a snarky comment saying, \\"Well I don't know what to tell ya\\". This definitely rubbed me the wrong way. It came off inconsiderate and just plain rude. We then ordered our food because we were famished. My friend got the Fish & Chips- $20.00 (that I regretfully recommended he get), My sister got the Chicken & Chips- $14.00, and I got the Cheesy Spuds- $12.00. \\n  When our food finally arrived, it looked OK. Very basic, nothing too special. My friend's twenty dollar Fish & Chips was SOGGY. What could be a worse consistency for Fish & Chips? Not a sign of crispy goodness anywhere. It was almost like they had been sitting under a heat lamp. It was the same story with My Sister's Chicken & Chips. I chose the Cheesy Spuds that were baked potato wedges with tomato, spring onions, and Dubliner cheddar served with Smithwick's cheese dip. The best part about my dish was the cheese dip. The potatoes were a bit overcooked.\\n  Overall, the entrees we had were not executed well and uninspiring. Maybe because it was late dining? Maybe because it was a busy Saturday night? I'm not sure, but either way, I will not be returning. There is another Irish restaurant right next to Raglan Road that serves amazing Fish & Chips, and that's where I will choose to go next time I have the craving."},{"name":"Ladd Taphouse","address":"2239 SE 11th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"The food is decent and the atmosphere is awesome.

I've been to some places several times and have had up and down experiences. I think that's just the nature of a business that's so sensitive to people's feelings/emotions/burdens that day. Anyways...I decided to write a review for COM for the one time I went, because I felt compelled. \\n\\nI'm giving it 5 stars because everything came together perfectly--the service, the timing, the quality, the atmosphere. All of it. \\n\\nI met my boyfriend here after work on a Friday. He wanted to sit at the bar, so he got there a bit early to avoid the crowds. I got there around 6, and we both sat at the bar. The bartender (his name evades me, I was there a few months ago) was. The. Absolute. Best. Friendly, informative, and engaging, he had a wide knowledge of spirits, liquors and cocktailery (not sure if that's a word). The cocktails were crafted by him, and he was great at recommending beers and cocktails that suited each of our tastes, and was happy to give us samples. \\n\\nTruth be told, my boyfriend and I were there to try their famous burger. I'm not going to tell you how to get the burger since it will not be on the menu, but if you read this review carefully, you'll be able to get an idea of how to do it. Anyways, safe to say it was really the best burger I've ever eaten. I'm not even a huge fan of burgers (or beef, for that matter), but I will go back just for this. We ended up splitting the burger and a side of duck-fat-roasted brussel sprouts (all their food products are locally sourced, BOOYAH). And then the manager came out with...three giant bones of roasted bone marrow. I LOVE BONE MARROW. And these weren't the gimpy, underfed cow bone marrow bones. These things were LEGIT. I'm drooling thinking about them. And they were complimentary. Which was the sweetest thing, because we felt we were pretty unassuming and didn't really order a whole lot off the menu. It was a small gesture, but just very thoughtful--how did they know I love bone marrow?! Magic, I say. \\n\\nAtmosphere-wise, I can see how this place has the potential to attract a slightly pretentious crowd. It's price points are on the slightly higher side, but it's worth it. And potential douchery isn't enough to retract a star. Quite frankly, people who do that are the pretentious ones. It was just a lovely experience. Get there now Get there early (it can get busy). And seriously--be kind to the entire staff there. They appreciate it just as much as you would appreciate their kindness.

There's also a big-ass maroon velvet (?) curtain in front of the entrance that makes one feel like a) a bad high school production of \\"Guys And Dolls\\" is about to start, b) a burlesque dancer is about to begin her act, or c) a magician (or worse, a burlesque-dancing magician) is about to begin his/her act.\\n\\nThe service is good, though we waited a while for our two simple little margherita pizzas.\\n\\nHowever, we had the Antipasto Plate, which I'm still debating whether or not it was worth the $18. I think for that amount of money you oughtta be swimming in prosciutto, but that's just me. Then again, I was with another carnivore, who attacked the various \\"Italian cured meats\\" with gusto. Our personal pizzas were yummy and super-thin. The portions are large; I had enough pizza AND antipasto left to take home for dinner tonight. Score! Maybe the antipasto WAS worthe the $18 after all.\\n\\nThe crowd is loud and lively, or at least it was on the particular night I was there. There happened to be a couple of large parties, but once they left, I could see how Antico Forno could be a more intimate, romantic locale for a date.

I take it for what it is, and when I suffer from paralysis from analysis, this is the bar I choose. It's close to my house, and downtown's an exit away if I decide to want to gallivant around more that evening. \\n\\nThe beer selection's pretty good. I usually get  Convict Hill Oatmeal Stout, and my boyfriend gets some pansy ass cider I don't care enough to try. Whatever. One of us has to wear the pants. The food is pretty meh and their menu is typical sports bar food. I've had a burger and chicken tenders here and they're both overpriced/bland. The service is hit or miss. One time I waited over half an hour to put an order in and I finally had to flag a manager down in order to get something put in. Most of the time though they're quicker. \\n\\nThe interior has some nice design with clean lines and is one of my favorite things about Draft Pick. It's very open and big and I've never had a problem getting a table even around happy hour. Crowds here vary. Sometimes, the vibe is really douchey and other times it's laid back. It depends what's going on that night. If it's a big game, the bro's come in and take up two parking spots with the F-150's they don't know how to drive. If it's not, most patrons will be people who work at the tech companies on Montopolis stopping in for happy hour. The parking can be confusing for those who aren't used to mixed use buildings (Draft Pick is in the AMLI South Shore building); just look for the garage to your left. \\n\\nSo, yeah. A-OK.

Here was my chance to finally try it!\\n\\nCraigie did not disappoint, and neither did the pigs' tails. They were probably the best part of the meal (I was so attached to the idea of them that I ordered them *in addition to* the eight-course tasting menu -- probably a mistake, as you'll find out later), but not by much! All eight courses ranged from very very tasty (the house-made corkscrew pasta) to \\"holy shit I'm dying of delicious\\" (the sashimi with harissa). It was all a bit too much for me, though -- after the 5th course, I ended up having to tell our server to box the rest, as I was beyond stuffed.

After a couple of days of very limited deli items from the \\"cafeteria\\" at Emanuel, I felt it was time to reach out and try some of the local neighborhood food.\\n\\nMy good buddy Google suggested Pizza a Go Go, and had given it a fairly good rating.  It was only a few blocks away, very near to where the hospital was, walking distance.  So I said to myself, \\"Why the Hell not?\\"\\n\\nFrom the moment I walked into the establishment, I could tell that I wasn't being taken seriously as a customer by the lack of greeting and customer service that followed.  The next thing I noticed was that the establishment wasn't really very sanitary, as the tables were all filthy, some with previous customers garbage, and some were just grimy as if they hadn't been wiped down properly.  The floor was quite filthy, and there was visible dirt on it.  I already knew what I wanted, and despite there being nobody in the venue at all, the two guys working there that evening stood around talking about bands that I'd never heard of instead of trying to take my order.  I literally had to interrupt their conversation to place my order, and then they looked at me like I was being rude for coming into their establishment, pausing their exchange, and placing an order.\\n\\nI looked at the pre-cooked slices in the case, and determined by looking at them that they had probably sat there much longer than they should have, so I opted to order a full pie of my own.  I told the guy that i wanted to dine in with a pepperoni and sausage with a side order of cold tomatoes.  The guy placed the order and told me it would be at least 45 minutes, even though I was the only person in the joint.  The two workers went back to talking, and the pizza was finally started 25 minutes after my order was taken.\\n\\nWhen I finally got my pizza, they put it in a to-go box, even though I clearly asked to dine in.  I looked at the guy, kind of rolled my eyes a little bit and walked out, pizza box in hand and that's when I realized I was missing my cold tomatoes.  It turns out that the pizza cook had just read tomatoes and cooked them onto the pizza itself.  By this time I was so disgusted with the staff there that I chose not to return and wait another 45 minutes for a replacement while they did God knows what.  So I returned to the hospital room at Emanuel, pizza in hand and ate about half of it.  I must say that the ratings Google gave the establishment were for the quality of the pie, and not for the customer service.  The cheese was gooey and slightly browned, the pepperoni was slightly crispy, the crust was crispy on the outside and chewy in the middle.  My only issue with the pizza itself was that they cooked the tomatoes onto it, but the sauce was tangy and garlicky, and the whole thing tasted pretty damn good for the customer service Hell I went through to get it.\\n\\nWould I ever go back to Pizza a Go Go?  Hell no.  I might actually have them deliver if I am ever in the area again for any reason, but I won't set foot in their establishment to order from them in person again.  This gets a 3 star rating despite the terrible customer service I received there because the quality of the pie itself actually elevates the business.  However, the people working there need to understand that the awesomeness of the product will only carry them so far, and that exceptional customer service goes a long way, especially with the way word of mouth travels these days.  You might have an exceptional pizza, but please, try and create an exceptional customer service experience to match your product, and then you could get five star reviews."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"Wow!

I now go more than an hour later and it's not much of a wait at all.\\n\\nThe staff is so friendly and they remember faces and (even more impressive) names of their customers.\\n\\nI've ordered individual items as well as a huge company lunch from them, and every time, the food amazes me.  \\n\\nIt's definitely my go-to when I need a quick muffin, chai, lunch or snack fix during the day or even on my way home from work.\\n\\nI've tried a few soups (which were all great), and the first sandwich I had was the chicken and brie one and while I'd love to branch out and try others, I just can't bring myself to do so.  The chicken and brie sandwich is hands-down the best sandwich I've ever eaten.\\n\\nI'm not a huge fan of bakery items, but I've sampled quite a few here.  Most of them are too much for me and not to my liking, but I put an order in for a ginger molasses cookie anytime someone from the office is heading over.  Their recipe is the best I've tried.\\n\\nI also love that they're open on Saturdays - and soon to be Sundays as well.  It's a great option for downtown residents when most other Financial District lunch places close on the weekends."},{"name":"The Red Line Cafe","address":"188 Essex St","city":"Salem","stars":"4","text":"They have transformed the shiny white, red and green of Rita's to a warm inviting and cozy cafe.

Customer service is clearly a priority here. The food is good. They get bread and bagels form Iggy's so if you don't like Iggy's bagels you won't like the bagels. I'm not a huge fan of Iggy's bagels but mine was warm and toasted which made it much better than a plain Iggy's bagel. I do like Iggy's bread so next time I'll have to try a sandwich, which really seems to be their specialty. \\n\\nThe coffee is pretty good. It's Lavazza, which is to say it's not local but it's pretty good. Lavazza espresso has a very distinct flavor that is nice. Was my Americano as good as one I could get from Gulu or Jaho? It's entirely different to be honest. The espresso is vastly different to the espresso from Gulu or Jaho. This is not to say it's bad, in fact it's pretty good. I was more than pleased with my Americano. Next time I'm in (after the hordes of tourists leave) I'll try one of their specialty drinks.\\n\\nThe music they play? Meh. It's a non-offensive yet boring blend of greatest hits from the 80s to now played at just the right volume that it can't be tuned out. Bring headphones and your MP3 player for quality music.\\n\\nI'll be back with my headphones.\\n\\nI do think they have a hard spot to carve out. You've got Gulu nearly across the street offering up similar food but with a hipster vibe. Jo' freedom serves up boho hipster art scene flair right down the street. Jaho offers coffee snobbery with a Euro flair. Atomic offers up art school filth. The Red Line? Cozy, friendly, and comfortable but lacks a defined personality. I think that will come with time.

This is as a result of the last two experiences at the restaurant.  One was a wine tasting and the other was a wine dinner.  Read on for details.....\\n\\nAfter having such a positive experience in Sept., I returned in December for a wine tasting evening. While the salesman from the wine distributor did a very good job of talking about the wine, where were the hors d'oeuvres to accompany each of the wines?????  This was promoted as a small, intimate seating of only 16, yet the event ultimately accommodated close to 50 people.  Not intimate at all.  Also, never in the course of the wine tasting was any food presented, though we were presented 4 wines.  There were only bread sticks.  Very thoughtless and unprofessional, in my opinion, and not at all as represented or advertised.  When I asked about this at the end, I was told they would provide me with a free dessert on my next visit to the restaurant.  Is this bait & switch? Obviously, attempting to create another opportunity for me to return to the restaurant and spend more $ and get $7 free dessert......no thanks!!!! I think the proper thing to do would have been to issue a partial credit for the evening.\\n\\nHOWEVER, this next negative experience really tops it all. I made reservations for a table of 7 for a wine dinner, that was being prepared by a Michelin starred chef from Italy, visiting in January. This was an event, priced at $99pp, + tax/tip, for a four course dinner, with accompanying wines.  We arrived in the dining room, and there were three large tv's on, while we are having our drinks, and while we were seated for dinner.  Three times people from my table asked for the tv's to be turned off, as they were large and right in front of our table, and the owner was indignant, and rude, stating that we had already asked him, and he was busy, but would tend to it.  Despite three requests, he finally had a staff person turn the tv's off, after 20 minutes.\\n\\nAgain, it was presented that the chef, and the owner would comment on the food being prepared, interact with the guests, and there would be a little discussion about the wines being served.  THERE WAS NO CONTACT from the chef or owner during the entire meal, except at the end when the chef came out to find out how the food was.\\n\\nOne would expect from a visiting Michelin star chef, and from a dinner costing $100+, that the plates would be changed during the meal.....no, sorry to disappoint.  The plates were not changed, and we suffered through mixing sauces and flavors from our first dish through our last.  Some of the meal was served family style, and the portions available were totally inadequate, even for the women at the table.  We repeatedly had to ask for more food to be brought out to our table.\\n\\nIs this service, quality, professionalism?  Not in my opinion.  The rudeness my guests experienced and the demeanor of the owner is not to be tolerated, nor rewarded with any more business.\\n\\nBottom line: My wife and I will NOT return."},{"name":"Whole Heart Provisions","address":"487 Cambridge St","city":"Allston","stars":"4.5","text":"I love the Cassie bowl, especially with tofu added on top.

It turned into a wet evening so we didn't take in any waterfront views, unfortunately and it was a bit wet walking from the office to One Marina Park but the restaurant itself was warm and very inviting.\\n\\nThe interior is a mix of old-school charm and modern with a large dining hall with flat-panel TVs lining the walls near the high ceilings. White tablecloths and napkins are the norm with great seafood options, decent wines and good service. We were served a good Italian baguette with oil-infused olives with our glasses of a good Bordeaux. Nice touch on the stemware - I totally fall for stuff like this.\\n \\nThe menu was interesting, short-and-sweet with a page of salads/apps/antipastos and another of entrees, mostly Italian-based or inspired. I guess the chef/owner has another place in town that's a bit famous? A local team-member mentioned this to us.\\n\\nHere's a run-down of what was ordered by the handful of people on my end of the table:\\n\\nSpinach and Pear Salad - baby spinach, sliced pears, candied pistachios, gorgonzola, crispy pancetta, raspberry vinaigrette. I normally don't go for the sweet fruity salads and almost made an exception with this. Unusually, you get a whole pear halved and sliced on the plate. Great balance of sweet-savory in this salad.\\n\\nStrega Salad - baby arugula, sliced grapefruit, walnuts, shaved parmesan, citrus vinaigrette. This was my selection and it was quite good - lighter than you would expect and a good foundation for the seafood to come.\\n\\nRisotto di Mare - chef's daily selection of fresh seafood, risotto - this was my original selection before hearing about the the Zuppa de Pesce. Clams, muscles, calamari and quite good.\\n\\nPenne Arrabiata - penne with garlic, oil and spicy tomato sauce - this was a favorite with some of the vegetarians at the table. This was spicier than I expected and quite satisfying. All the pasta I tried was cooked perfectly - a good sign.\\n\\nPappardella Funghi Selvatica - homemade pasta served with wild mushrooms and black truffle oil - another vegetarian option - I'm not sure how well this went with some of our Indian diners - mushrooms aren't common in their traditional food so for some the flavor is off-putting. The bit I sampled was very flavorful and delicious thought.\\n\\nVeal Saltimbocca - prosciutto di parma, fontina cheese, sage, white wine demi glaze,  roasted potatoes and a couple of asparagus - I didn't taste this one but those who ordered told me it was quite good.\\n\\nZuppa de Pesce - all I heard in the description was \\"tomato stock with fettuccini, clams, muscles, calamari, fish\\" and then they bring out the crackers and an extra napkin. Next this gigantic wok comes out with half a lobster - wow, what a dish. For business occasions I try not to over-indulge and unless I'm paying my own way, order something moderately priced. I'm not sure how much this beast added to the bill but I'm sure I didn't succeed on being moderate. It was entirely delicious though, with so much seafood I was set for at least a week. If you want to get a feel for this restaurant's cuisine, THIS is the dish to order.\\n\\nService in a word was fantastic - several employees coming to our table took care of anything we asked for and handled all our questions with extensive descriptions (we are a picky crowd as you can imagine).

We arrived 20 minutes before our reserved time but they still seated us almost immediately. The ambiance was charming since this location is in the Old City Hall in Boston. Our table was in a small room which allowed for more private conversation in an intimate setting; however, the servers seemed to congregate right outside the opening of this room and we overheard their running dialogue of profanity and complaints during our meal. Their conversations were distasteful and not what I wanted to hear peppered throughout our romantic evening. Our salads were fine. My boyfriend ordered a cowboy ribeye, I ordered the petite ribeye. Both steaks were cooked perfectly and full of flavor. They were by far the highlight of the meal. Unfortunately, it seems that the steaks required all of the chef's attention because the sides fell flat. We ordered mashed potatoes and steamed broccoli. The mashed potatoes were ok but not worth the price and the broccoli was terrible. It was barely cooked at all and not tender like I was expecting. There was no seasoning on the potatoes or the broccoli. Definitely a waste of money. We ordered the berries and sweat cream for dessert and the manager sent a creme br√ªl√©e to our table as well to wish us happy anniversary. Both desserts were wonderful. We preferred the berries and cream, but the creme br√ªl√©e is a great option if you like really sweet desserts. The server added a few things to the bill that were never delivered to the table (my boyfriend ordered sparkling water but it never came) and they originally charged us for the dessert the manager sent to our table. Our server was quick to apologize and correct the error, but the payment process was still awkward. The server brought a handheld device to the table and hovered over us while my boyfriend added in the tip. It seemed a little unprofessional for such a high end restaurant.

But why run a half ass special that piss me off. For the coupon u can't use for lunch, no take out, and has to be used in one setting, can't be involved with multiple people eating at same time. So it is impossible to use this deal without paying about the same as if u didn't have it. Tricky tricky fockers.

U can't save it for later, u can't order drinks with it. u either order something on top of the buffet or just waste it. Ok that's fine.

Chicken prepared this way can very easily be dry but this was not. It was obviously cooked to order. The whole dish was nicely done and very tasty, with just a touch of creaminess, not drowning in it like you get at some restaurants. My wife had shrimp scampi, to which she gave a thumbs up.

Atmosphere, food, prices, staff and, of course, beer selection are all just top-notch and exactly where, if you sat down with some people and listed attributes of the perfect beer bar, all of those attributes would fit.\\nThere's a really wide range of what's on draft here. They have mostly darker and higher percentage beers but, if you're a beer snob, that's mostly what you're interested in anyway because that's where the best brewers do their best stuff. You're not looking for Sweetwater 420 and you're certainly not looking for Bud Light. For instance, when I was here, they had 21st Ammendment's Big Black on, but also two versions (from different years) of a Smuttynose barleywine. I had had the former but never the latter, but the bartender was fantastic enough to give me a taste of both versions (which were surprisingly very different). The Big Black runs at well over 7% and I've normally seen it on draft (when I've seen it, which isn't a lot) for about or a little under $5. The Porter had it on for $3.50, and it comes with 16oz of big, cold, black glory. Damn.\\nI would call the bottles list devastating. Since they change it up, there's no way you could ever go through this, unless you sat with about 20 friends seven days per week for several hours, each ordering a different bottle and then sampling each others. Some stuff I've never even heard of before and some stuff that takes you back into the realm of \\"best beer I've ever had\\" (hi there, Petrus). I mean, I knew they brewed beer in Norway, but I can't say that I've ever actually seen it on a menu.\\nFor atmosphere, this is not a large place, but that makes it better. If this were laid out like a Taco Mac, then it would not be as good. Therefore you should not be surprised if you can't get a table and the bar does not have two adjacent seats. If you go somewhere else for a bit though (plenty of other stuff to do in this area) and come back, I'm sure there would be an available seat. People seem to get in and out relatively quickly.\\nNow, admittedly, I did not actually try the food, but it seemed that everyone around me was trying it and I made sure to study their food menu (but not as much as the beer menu, which takes a while to go over). The food is interesting, well-done and, for what it is, is reasonably priced. Not cheap, but reasonable.\\nThe only thing I would change about this place is move is closer to MARTA station (although it's not that far) and out of such a busy, touristy neighborhood. A guy came in, sat next to me and ordered a screwdriver.

The other food choices left a lot to be desired. I ordered the shrimp from the raw bar and it was tough and the portion was rather small, it seemed like 2 large shrimp cut up into cube size pieces, very average . My biggest gripe was the crab cake I ordered, it was overloaded with a strong jalape√±o flavor and some heat. It had so little crab in it, it was more like a jalape√±o breaded biscuit - for $27??? Unacceptable. You could not see nor taste the crab.  For a $200 dinner for 2 I expected much more - skip it.

I also would recommend going to the condiment bar and making a dip for the crust (my favorite is olive oil, garlic, crushed peppers, black pepper and parmesan cheese). Oh and how could I forget the BYOB option?

Sure they could be friendlier but they do their best to keep the line moving. Be ready to order and if you aren't, get ready to get some attitude. Also, if you are one of the people who like to linger after your meal, you will be encouraged to move along. Yes BYOB is a nice feature.

I have given this location multiple opportunities to prove me wrong but this last visit was the last straw for me.\\n\\nHere are a few examples of bad experiences I have had here: \\nLast November I was visiting with a slightly large group (8 people). I tried to push two tables that were right next to each other together when an employee ran over to me, shoved me out of the way and started yelling about fire code. I asked her how we were supposed to eat together if we couldn't put the tables together; she responded with (I kid you not) \\"I don't care. These are the rules.\\" Later she saw my grandfather trying to squeeze 8 chairs at a 6 person table and kindly offered to push together the tables I was trying to push together earlier... So weird. \\nEarlier this year in January we waited almost 15 minutes for our food. Everyone who went to the salad bar had already gone back for seconds before our food even arrived. I also asked for no guacamole on my California Club since I'm allergic to avocado and mine still came with guacamole so I had to send it back and wait another 5 to ten minutes. It was ridiculous.\\nToday was the last straw for me. My sister and I have some sort of allergies/ colds and our throats hurt so we wanted tome chicken soup. Jason's Deli typically has great chicken noodle soup so we ordered some. It took a good amount of time to even get our soup and when we did get it it was barely warm and super salty. It tasted days old and like they added salt to keep it fresh. I know it's summer and people don't typically order soup but it should at least be fresh. We took it back and were offered warmer soup but we just asked for to-go chicken pot pie soup hoping it would be better than the chicken noodle. I just ate the to-go soup and again it was super salty and old tasting... Disappointing.\\n\\nI'm glad that I have been to other Jason's Delis and had good experiences there because this one gives Jason's Deli a bad name."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"I went to salt lick last weekend.

The sauce is pretty good and different than most Texas bbq places (if they even have sauce).  The sauce and atmosphere deserve five stars, but the food itself is about average for the area.  For the first time this weekend i didn't order a plate, as I usually just like brisket and white bread at bbq places.  It was really cheap for just a 1/2 lb of brisket and that is plenty to stuff you.  Only downside is they don't have regular bread for making sandwiches.

This lead me to visit an average of three times a week for several weeks, and while I was there for a morning kiss before the hell that is the 73 bus, the ulterior motive of grabbing a glazed or chocolate frosted donut was too strong to repress.

Who needs Krispy Kreme?\\n\\nAs for those who are underwhelmed by the Green Mountain coffee, all I can say is get your cheap and delicious pastry, then head directly across Trapelo for a Starbucks coffee.  Ohlin's isn't a coffee shop.  You can't walk in and grab a table and bask in a cafe-like atmosphere. It is an in and out, so if you're picky about your coffee, grab it elsewhere... you can't really stay anyway.  Personally, I just appreciate that it is self-serve and I don't have to wait on a barista to fill the orders of the 10 other people ahead of me.\\n\\n My first Yelp and I'm already lying to you...

In that time I don't think their dim sum menu has changed...but that's okay because we like what they offer and continue to come back for it.  The place is small and there is almost always a line on weekends. At their busiest waits will easily exceed 30 minutes.  For best bets in getting seats get there before 11:30,  or come after 1:30,  or in the winter come during a fierce snowstorm(seriously)--seats are usually plentiful then.  In the time we've been going here the prices have also changed very little--so you end up eating well for a very reasonable price.\\n\\nSince this place is small, the dim sum does not include waitresses pushing carts of pre-made goodies.  Everything is taken to order and prepared in their kitchen.  Our brunch selections always includes the home made youtiao (oil sticks= unsweetened fried dough) and a big bowl of their hot sweetened soy milk.   We tend to vary some of the other dishes but our favorites include the five spiced beef (cold, fragrants, sliced beef shanks), the steamed pork ribs and chit'lin's (yes pig intestines--yumm) which is served on a bed of steamed sweet potato chunks, the chive pockets tasty and vegetarian,  the chicken roll (ji juan)  which is a ground season chicken wrapped in a tofu skin, sauteed and sliced, Pork soup with rice noodles (fensi), the sticky wrice dumpling (zongzi).  We aren't crazy about their steamed buns, but will go for most everything else on the menu. The menu is somewhat limited but, judging by the crowds, popular.   The crowd is almost always 90% asian (and probably 90% of that is Taiwanese) so this is likely to be some of the most authentic Taiwanese food you can find in the Boston area (apart from being invited over to someone's house for dinner).\\n\\nI am a little bit reluctant to post this review because it will simply make it harder for my wife and I to find a seat when we go.

It's well-located, it's clean, it has plenty of those now-requisite wall-sized chalk drawings that employ otherwise out of work art school graduates that all the hip crowds seem to like these days instead of old boardwalk kitsch. Most importantly, its menu is an understated thing of beauty, more than capturing all of the dishes that you would need and want in a homestyle Southern food restaurant: Sizzling Skillet Bacon Cornbread, Sweet Corn Fritters, po'boys (in chicken, shrimp, vegetable and chicken fried steak styles), sweet tea (\\"the real thing!\\" I seem to recall my menu espousing), chicken and waffles on brunch days, and so on. Based on the menu alone if they got even half of this stuff right I would have moved into their stockroom.\\n\\nAnd yet, my address remains unchanged.\\n\\nEverything was cooked to visible perfection. The chicken was crispy and well fried. The greens were thick and fresh. The skillet bacon cornbread was fat and sizzling, as advertised. The fried pickles were coated firm and well. The corn fritters golden and served with a well-seasoned cayenne aioli sauce. Unfortunately, almost none of it had any discernible flavor whatsoever.\\n\\nLet me be clear, I am not saying I did not like the flavor they possessed. I am saying some of these dishes were devoid of the essence of zest that comes with consuming actual sustenance as opposed to say, popcorn. As flavors go, your food may be one thing over another - it may be salty over sweet, or sour over candied, or peppered over buttered - but it cannot be NONE of those things. In an attempt to be \\"homegrown\\" or to let the natural ingredients of the food ring through, the menu's palate is too residually garden, too safe, too unseasoned. You are left with cooked chicken, but not flavorful chicken. Cooked potatoes, but only just so.\\n\\nSetting aside that they did not have, in the middle of a weekday, any chicken breasts to serve (!), my fear is that a great many chickens have died for naught, since whatever they're doing to them in that kitchen is absolving them of all flavor. It is fried chicken for people watching their cholesterol: all cracklin', no lip smackin'. The greens were okay, if a little underdone in the interest of being organic (a sentence that hurt as much to type as it did for you to read it). The slaw was a vegetable straw medley, emphasis on the straw. The red skin mashed potatoes were actually good, but that's pretty much where the Good News telegram ends. The corn fritters were merely puffy carriers for aioli sauce one can find anywhere, being neither sweet nor corn-flavored. The fried pickles were pickled (bam!) on top of being pickles (pow!), so eating them fried was an exercise in Mason jar-flavored frustration (super organic!) when it should have been a decadent pleasure. The key lime pie was of lethargic texture and contained all of the sugar that my corn fritters and over-brewed \\"real thing!\\" sweet tea should have had. And the criminal masterstroke, a dish that should have been impossible to get wrong - the Sizzling Skillet Bacon Cornbread - was devoid of every ingredient that should have leapt to the fore. The bacon was minimal and barren. The cornbread was vacant, tasting neither sweet nor of cornmeal. If they make this with buttermilk, they need to stop right now. I can get more flavor with a box of Jiffy corn muffin mix and a fistful of bacon bits. Overall, this menu could sing with some tweaks for actual flavor.\\n\\nThose of you familiar with this establishment will note (probably alarmingly so) that I have not yet mentioned the charitable side effect of eating there, specifically their claim that for every meal purchased they will deliver a meal through a local food pantry. I have not mentioned this because this is a review of their food, not an accounting of their beneficence. If one feels compelled to partake of their shockingly substandard food in the name of moral largesse, one could do a lot worse things. But anyone who convinces you to eat here first because of their philanthropic mission is essentially tagging you in an ice bucket challenge. For myself, I will save my gullet for food I actually enjoy and continue to donate food and money to the charities I subscribe to. The charge here is the same as it is for an ice bucket challenge: if you have to be beguiled to consider helping another human being, you need challenges of a more consistent and self-developing nature."},{"name":"Cafe Yumm!","address":"1806 SW 6th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"I got the Yumm Bento with the barbecue tofu skewer to go for I think a little over $7.

The price is $7-8 for each item on the wood boards for dinner....note that for the \\"stinky cheeses\\" it's per slice for the price, so no one's getting full off of anything on the board!

It's a preset meat&cheese board, but it gives coverage for various tastes.\\n\\nAlso got the Salty Pig Pizza--highly recommend! Ask your waiter what's the daily meat part if you really want, but my guess is it'll be delicious no matter what. The sweet caramel glaze + arugula topped with some extra shredded mozzarella requested from our server really made the pizza! Also gives you a chance to try some of the meats without ordering them on the board. I have a habit of taking off pizza toppings sometimes, so I just took off some of the packed on meat from the pizza and paired it with the extra bread slices and got to taste the meats separately that way, yum!\\n\\nThey've also got a pretty good collection of draft drinks and specialties on the blackboard if anyone's in the mood!"},{"name":"Mozart's Coffee Roasters","address":"3825 Lake Austin Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"What:    Best soy latte in town\\n               Mochas also delicious.

Both my boyfriend and I are avid sushi eaters and we knew that we could definitely get something a lot better elsewhere, but it was cold and we had our car parked in a DT overpriced parking lot nearby that was charging by the half hour so we needed something fast and quick for dinner before we headed home. The moment I went into Umeda I knew we were in for a ride. They were mopping the floors while there were customers at around 8pm. The mopping, I could overlook, but the waitress nodded us to a dirty table that had a large bowl of fried rice that was siran wrapped. I hesitated but she told me to sit down for a bit. She later came back to retrieve the bowl of fried rice and to wipe the table and all the crumbs onto us. But that's my rant about the environment.\\n\\nIn terms of the food, we ordered one chicken udon, 3 rolls that were part of their combo (3 itmes for 9.95?) and then one tuna and salmon sashimi. The udon came very quickly. We were so hungry by this point that we didn't think much into it and just dug in. But by the time we polished the udon off (soup as well) nothing else had come to our table. We glanced into the kitchen from our seats and noticed that there was only one chef for the entire restaurant. The chef eventually came out and we got out rolls 15 minutes after we finished our udon. The first thing I noticed about the 3 rolls was that the sushi rice used for the rolls were cold. I guess you could excuse the coldness to 'freshness' of the ingredients being used from the refrigerator, but I've never had such a cold sushi roll before..and they were supposedly partially fried! (2 out of our 3 rolls were fried on the outside and drizzled with sauce). But despite the rolls being fried on the outside, the rolls were still cold when I put them in my mouth. \\n\\nTo be honest, when my boyfriend ordered sashimi, I immediately worried whether or not they would make me sick afterwards. Coming from an environment where I could clearly see that they were not keen on being organized or clean, it was quite worrisome. \\n\\nThis is definitely not a japanese restaurant that is geared towards individuals that are use to going to Guu, Minami, Hapa Izakaya, or even Sushi California or Sushi Town.

I relish interacting with knowledgeable servers, and I was grateful for every course introduction we received.

The duck featured an fatty goo on the rim, which was more a commentary on fowl than a good idea. The mustard was the standout.\\nFried clams w squid ink - you weren't craving them, but they're the best fried clams you'll ever have.\\nSwordfish - couldn't be more tender or juicy. I craved a crispy skin, but I got that with the...\\nPork Two Ways - an ode to an amazing creature. Spice crusted rib and a crispy crackling. Delicious.\\nChanterelle mushrooms - how did they acquire that lovely taste of sage (rosemary)?\\nSweet corn and buttermilk ice cream - what a terrific idea! My date doesn't like corn but loved this.\\nHer dessert: something with chocolate (great!), white chocolate ice cream (great!), and a sauce that lacked the tingency to be a factor\\nMy dessert: corn grits with a berry sauce and anise ice cream. This is a very good idea that ought to be refined. I love the combination of warm and cold. The ice cream, if you like anise, was lovely. Berries - can't go wrong. But the brulee on the grits didn't come through - too much going on. The grits did for this dessert what rice does for teriyaki - provide a staple base for the sauce on top.

Next time I might do an all day trek to the Salt Lick. It's out in the country so you have to drive for about 45 from downtown. That being said, it's worth it. I'd like to go back in the Spring/Summer and eat outside with my cooler full of Shiner.\\n\\nI had the lean brisket, pork ribs and turkey. It was all good.\\n\\nHad I written this review immediately after eating, I might not have been so generous with the stars but thinking back, everything was exceptional. \\n\\nI also tasted the other \\"moist\\" brisket. In this case, \\"moist\\" means brisket, nicely marbled with tasty fat. It was OK but the lean brisket topped it's moist brother that night and for leftovers the next day.\\n\\nI tasted the sausage too. The texture was perfect but the sausage was a little bland. Maybe I expected some more heat to go with it. I had to supply the heat via the \\"spicy\\" sauce which where I come from would be called Mild sauce; medium at most. Heat aside, the spicy sauce was excellent and it complemented the sausage very well.\\n\\nI'm not used to seeing turkey at a BBQ spot. The turkey was a great surprise, the smokey flavor of the moist white meat was incredible. I would order it again.\\n\\nBefore summing up my visit to the Salt Lick BBQ, I'd like to complement the staff. We're not from Texas, the Salt Lick was so far out of town that, until we saw it, I was wondering if this place was for real. We must have looked lost when we walked in about an hour before closing. The staff was extremely friendly and checked back regularly. The pickles were a crazy good complement to the meats. When I asked for more pickles, our server came back with a small plateload a few minutes later.\\n\\nNext time I go to the Salt Lick I'm gonna 1) bring my own cooler of beer, 2) go early on a nice sunny day when I can take my time and 3) spend a little more money so get up on some BBQ.\\n\\nEat up, \\n\\ne.z."},{"name":"Antico Pizza","address":"1093 Hemphill Ave NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I love it.

It may have to do with how busy they get, but the wait times can get a little long and I have had one sandwich where the breading all fell off, that is usually indicative of the chicken not resting long enough before being fried.

If it weren't for you, I would have to fly home to LA to enjoy my favorite food.   It also for this reason, however, that you owe it to the people of Austin to improve upon your food. \\n\\nHere's some feedback that I hope you use (take it from a girl who ate this food at least once a week in LA and Orange County for the last 15 years, and who lived in the Middle East during Ramadan). \\n\\nI was excited to arrive and enjoy some fresh mint and radish with your bread, but was disappointed when the server said you were out of mint and radish.  This is a must!  Your fresh baked bread was delicious though. \\n\\nThe Must-o-Khiar tasted great, however the consistency was off. Typically cucumber yogurt salad is a bit thicker.  Yours was runny.  Also, the cucumbers were mushy, indicating they were either cut too thinly or the yogurt salad was old. \\n\\nThe Tabouli was good, but it needed less lemon and more garlic.  (and this is crazy coming from me, I love lemon!) \\n\\nYour Dolmeh was delicious.  Firm and tasty. No improvement needed here.  :)\\n\\nThe Baba Ghanooj was over-processed, and like the must-o-khiar, was too runny.  Good nutty flavor, though. \\n\\nI was disappointed with your Fesenjan.   First off, it came with four small, kebob-sized bites of chicken. While I appreciate your choice of all white meat,  fesenjan is best served with at least a quarter of a chicken, if not a half a chicken. The dark meat really soaks up the flavors, but the four small pieces served in your dish were overly-cooked and lacked flavor.    \\n\\nAlso, the consistency, again was too runny.  Turn down your food processors, please...  You may also want to revisit your recipe for this dish.  I would rate it a 4 out of 10.  I can't put my finger on it, but something didn't taste quite right. \\n\\nYour Baklava was delicious.  If my meal consisted entirely of your dolmeh and baklava, I'd be writing a different review right now. \\n\\nAll in all,  your food is ok.  I'll be back, but not before I try the tedious, time-consuming process of making fesenjan myself.  \\n\\nThanks for reading. Hope you use this advice.

The two none lobster dishes were great. Oysters and mussels were incredibly fresh, you could tell they have quite some supplier quality control. Server also gave great recommendation.\\n\\nLobster tacos were apparently a popular choice here, but it felt okay. Lobster is the kind of food that has a great appeal to be eaten simply boiled, as its texture and taste are spectacular, so trying to make it into a dish takes quite some skill, and I don't think the tacos did it.\\n\\nAnd finally the star here -- the hot butter lobster roll, the reason we came. They are very high rated on Yelp, and I would say among the top in Boston. But, disappointingly, it was just fine. The portion was about right for the price, and the hot butter was a great complement. But other than that the lobster didn't taste top of the line and the bread was okay. Keep in mine this is based on a single lobster roll, and perhaps they made some mistakes here.\\n\\nI was warned that food in Boston experiences \\"social resonance\\", where good reviews lead to good reviews, even though the food may as good as another restaurant that doesn't have good reviews to begin with.

However, I asked if I could sub the turkey for chicken since they both are poultry and I wanted BBQ chicken more than smoked turkey. WELL... they actually were out of turkey so one would think that the swap would be OK. Waitress said I could not replace the turkey (even though they did not have any) because adding chicken would run the risk of them having extra chicken at the end of the night. Not totally sure I understood her point, I got the brisket and order a side of BBQ chicken. The meats were decent but nothing spectacular. \\n\\nNow for the sides. THEY SUCK!  Each meal comes with potato salad (they put their own spin on it) and baked means. Not a fan of either side but I managed to eat the potato salad. Would be nice to offer customers a variety of sides. potato wedges, green beans, salad, etc. something other than these two mediocre side dishes! You pay a lot of $$$ and not to be able to have say on the sides to me is unreasonable. For 3 adults, my BF paid $80 (also had peach cobbler and pecan pie which was extremely bland)\\n\\nProbably won't return.

We did encounter a few flaws last night, though.  \\nThe Good:\\n-Our Server was great in general - friendly, helpful, etc. There was one flaw I'll note below.\\n-Winter Caprese (mostly) - it's not a word I often use to describe food, but the Burrata was just a beautiful piece of cheese, and the tomatoes were exactly what I want in a Caprese.  There was a negative I'll note below.\\n-Insalata di Cavolo Rosso - Wow.  I really wanted to order another. Not because it was small, but because it kicked some taste-bud booty (that's a good thing =).  I could've eaten a giant bowl of it.  \\n-The Brooklyn Pizza - great, although probably not quite as good as past pizzas I've had at Cibo (a high standard to maintain). The crust wasn't quite as good as in the past.  They do have one of the best sauces around.  Overall, still a great pizza.\\n-Buffalo steak special - what a great cut of steak - perfectly cooked, and served over an arugula pesto that complemented it brilliantly.  \\n\\nThe less than stellar:\\n-We ordered our salads and mains at the same time, and it was a loooong gap from when we finished our salads to when we got our mains.  We weren't in a hurry and were enjoying the conversation and I wasn't really looking at the time, so it wasn't a problem, but from the point I thought to myself \\"it's been a while\\" it was probably another 10 minutes before they came out. I'd wager it was close to 30 minutes from the time we finished our salads til when we got our meal. The only thing that rubbed me the wrong way is that there was no apology or any mention of the delay.  \\n-The fried eggplant on the Caprese. Not that it was bad, it's just completely unnecessary and detracts from the beauty of the burrata, which it overwhelms a bit. If I were the chef, I'd take it out. \\n-The Lobster Gnocchi served with the Buffalo Steak special.  About half of it was incredibly charred. My gf commented she was surprised they even served it, which I'd agree with.  The other half was cooked fine, but the lobster-dough combo just didn't really work for me. \\n-The booth we were in was a bit hard to get in and out of. I think they changed the seats (not positive) and they're comfy, but they sink in and have an arm at the end so you can't just slide out, and it's close to the table, so it's a bit of a maneuver to get out.  \\n\\nSounds like a lot of negatives, but overall, we thoroughly enjoyed our meal as we always have at Cibo."},{"name":"In a Pickle Breakfast & Lunch","address":"655 Main St","city":"Waltham","stars":"4","text":"After so many good reviews of this place, we decided to check it out.

Decent taste, like any other Mexican restaurant would offer.\\n\\nWe are veggie (no meat) lovers. We tried going through the menu. Weird part about the menu was the names of the dish. Typical Mexican names, which were of no meaning to me, since I am not a Mexican. \\n\\nHad to go through each & every description of the meal, to understand what exactingly the meal is about. \\n\\nAt some point later, we had to give up, since we were not able to clearly understand which dish would be a veggie.\\n\\nHence, we had to look forward to the waiter to help us out with the veggie options.\\n\\nAt the end of the discussion with the waiter, we realized, there are only 2 veggie options.

Knowledgeable, attentively listened to our questions, and led us through the extensive beer list. The food is the real star here. the flavors, the technique, and the presentation all come together.

I have gotten almost everything on the menu and loved it but my few favorites were the apple and Brie omelette, Tibetan Momo's (might be spelling that wrong but they are like big dumplings), and the juices are also phenomenal. All of the books around give it a very quaint feel making it a great spot for a casual brunch, or any other meal, and just hanging out or studying. Another thing I really love about this place is all of the events they hold. I went to a boozy brunch event where they had a mixologist come in and make a bunch of different drinks. A lot of fun and I would definitely recommend!"},{"name":"Fairmount Grille","address":"81 Fairmount Ave","city":"Hyde Park","stars":"3.5","text":"Sadly this place has gone down hill.......big time.   I went back in December with some running friends of mine. We reserved a big table up-top. I was really early which was my fault and it would have been ok had the server actually been attentive.  I wanted to order a drink but no one took my order until being there for 15 minutes at my table.  FIFTEEN MINUTES.   Finally I got to order a drink but it didn't come out for another TEN MINUTES.  By the time I got my first drink the other women were finally coming to join me for dinner (I had been there for almost 30 minutes).   \\n\\nI had also asked to talk to someone about the menu because I'm vegan and they have changed it since I was last there.  Remember all those awesome dishes I mentioned in my earlier review? Yeah unfortunately they're gone.  Instead of moving towards a more vegan friendly menu this restaurant went backwards and became less vegan friendly.   The only options are a crappy pasta dish (who wants to pay $16++ for a basic pasta dish with no good protein that you can make at home for $3 ???) and the veggie burger.  The veggie burger is home made which is awesome and I give them props for it but really?  Boring........  So anyway I am the only vegan out of my group of 10+ running friends and I wanted to figure out the vegan options before they got there because I don't like drawing attention to my dietary needs in front of people I don't know well. I repeatedly asked the server if someone could talk to me about the menu (she said she was new so she couldn't but said the manager would come up), well in 30 mins the manager NEVER came up to talk to me.  I'm sorry I am such a low priority on your list.  The manager finally came up after everyone else in my group was seated so I had to talk to them about my options in front of everyone which was exactly what I was trying to avoid.  I went with the veggie burger once I learned it was vegan and homemade. It was good but nothing spectacular.  I got a salad on the side instead of fries.\\n\\nThe server also just sucked.  The whole group waited multiple times for rounds of drinks, some people never got their round and we had to re-order them, others never had a chance to order in the first place until real late.  The food also got screwed up and came out really late.  We waited such a long time (over an hour) to get our food. I thought I would be in and out within an hour after ordering, no I was there for over 2 hours and missed my other plans that night.\\n\\nThe temperature because of the fans upstairs was also awful. It was so cold under the fans and the server said they couldn't adjust them.  The music was also really loud and it made it hard to hear.  \\n\\nMy favorite and by favorite I mean worse part of the night was when I ordered a bubbly drink like a Prosecco.  The server brought it up in a regular wine glass. And I was like umm I ordered a bubbly and she was like this is it. And I was like you don't have a champagne glass to serve it in? And she was like nope.  (What full bar doesn't have champagne glasses???) I took a sip and I was like no this is wine, not bubbly. And she challenged me and said yes it is.  And I was like no it's not, it has no carbon to it.  So either it's been sitting out and is incredibly flat (could happen with a regular wine glass) or you served me the wrong drink.  I didn't drink it and ordered another glass of white wine.\\n\\nMy entire group was completely annoyed with the terrible and slow service, we were all ready to get out of there."},{"name":"Craigie On Main","address":"853 Main St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"What a disappointment.\\n\\nWe are not Bostonians but travel there from or home in Toronto with a certain degree of frequency and have been wanting to eat at Cragie for some time.  Recently after reading Scott Haas's book, _Back of the House_, our desire to dine at Cragie intensified. So we were very pleased to be able to build the dinner into our Boston/Cambridge plans last weekend.\\n\\nOur expectations were high, to be sure, and we are critical diners.  But this meal was a major fail.   Our concerns about the restaurant fall into two categories: the food itself and the beverage service.  After being seated and looking at the libations menu we were surprised how limited the wine list appeared -- and even more surprised that for a restaurant that showcases \\"American\\" cuisine that wines from North and South America were so underrepresented.  ( we might add that if pairings were available to complement the tasting menus this was not readily apparent).  Our consternation about the wine program grew deeper when, at the end of the meal, we were presented with a dessert menu that featured pairings.\\n\\nAs for the food, it must be said there was one dish that was, in fact, outstanding.  This was the squid ink and lemon-saffron conchilgie, which was perfect in all components.  This excellence stood in stark contrast with what was easily the worst dish of the evening -- Vermont pork three ways, a dish we expected would be interesting, delicious, and showcasing the chef's talents. Instead we were a served a burnt rib (inedible), a lifeless sausage and a pool of mustard that overwhelmed everything on the plate.  The third element, the pork schnitzel, was boring and tasteless.  We thought about this dish the following night in New York, after eating Dan Barber's dish of the same concept at Blue Hill.  Ideally, one would want to highlight the quality of the meat itself and bind together each varied piece with some sort of overarching unifying gustatory theme.  At Craigie we had no evidence of any thought at all and if there was skill in the preparation it was lost in this particular serving.  Our main memory of the dish is carbon and mustard.\\n\\nOther dishes were fairly insipid. Sweetbreads with squash allowed the latter to entirely dominate and, when one did locate a bit of sweetbread, it was soggy.  Good marks for music though, a great jazz soundtrack, and the  service was friendly.  But the food was just horrible. And the beverage program a real head scratcher."},{"name":"Moe's Southwest Grill","address":"831 Main St","city":"Waltham","stars":"3","text":"no chips! this moe's didn't give me any chips! cheap cheap cheap \\n\\nThey also don't give a lot of queso or cheese in the wrong Doug :/ this definitely was NOT worth it"},{"name":"Ladd Taphouse","address":"2239 SE 11th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3","text":"Dear Secret Admirer, \\n\\nWhy thank you for the double Washington Apple shots....they were quite delicious.

First, they DO take reservations, but they refuse to take same-day reservations. I tried to call a few hours before my party of six wanted to dine, they refused to take a same-day reservation, I asked why, and the employee on the phone said they just don't, only next day, etc. Then she assured me that they'd be able to get us in after probably only 20-30 minutes because they do reserve some tables for walk-in parties. We braved it. When we arrived, they said it would be a 30-minute wait. We returned 30 minutes later, they said probably another 15 minutes. In total we waited an hour, and at that point we told them to just get us two tables and we split three and three. I would give them a 5-star rating if we hadn't had so much trouble getting the table - I do get that they can't control every aspect of the table service times, but it's a much better rule to overestimate than underestimate, and I'm still baffled as to why they refused to take a same-day reservation. \\n\\nLuckily the the food was worth the wait.

I was looking around trying to get someone's attention when one of the waiters noticed us and his jaw literally dropped.  I don't think he even knew we were there.  Obviously there was some miscommunication somewhere.  But things didn't speed up much after that.  The waiter was friendly but no one seemed in a hurry to bring us anything.

There was a wait for the entrees and when I was given my fish and chips I was told that one piece of fish was too small so they would be bringing another piece.  Which they did.  Which was nice, but weird.  We got the chicken tenders with raspberry habanero sauce and the chili cheese dip for appetizers.  The raspberry habanero sauce was too sweet for me and I was disappointed in the complete lack of any heat.  The chili cheese dip is a cup of chili that comes with potato chips.  The chili and the chips were good and there is a very thick layer of cheese on top of the chili and it was the highlight of the meal for me.  For entrees we got the Fairmount burger and the fish and chips.  Both were fine without being extraordinary in any way.  I can't describe the ambiance because there wasn't any that I could see.

The drinks here are also reasonable and not watered down so when we have the occasion to we usually drink some of their mixed drinks as well.  The stage is not huge but it's large enough and provides room for the band to move around some.  As most places the place is sort of dead until about 11pm, then it really fills up and picks up.  There's a nice patio for the smokers as well right off the front entrance.

You can't beat that.\\n\\nThe menu options also are straightforward and classic Italian (calamari, mozarella tomato salad, chicken parmesan, ravioli, ziti, frutti de mar, and simply-prepared fish dishes). They are prepared exactly the way you would expect, but somehow they taste better than any other version of that dish that you've ever had. I had the Chicken Parmesan, and it was simple but incredible, probably because the ingredients  like the pasta and tomato sauce are super fresh and prepared from scratch on site. \\n\\nOne thing you have to be prepared for is the fast-pacedness of your meal (they are turning tables really fast to help move the line) and the bare-bones atmosphere. I assume that they can afford to make the food so inexpensive because the restaurant is saving a lot of money on other features. For example, the restaurant is really small with a small staff and has litterally no special atmosphere or interior decoration. The food is served on plain white ceramic plates along with paper napkins. Also, its cash only, so the restaurant can avoid the credit card company fees. \\n\\nOverall, I would highly recomend this place if you're looking for an affordable authentic italian food experience, and are willing to forgo the  upscale atmospheric elements."},{"name":"Raglan Road Irish Pub","address":"1640 E Buena Vista Dr","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"The hosting service of this place is so disorganized.

The tap selection is impressive (18 or so) and changes very very quickly.   The bottle selection is still pretty so-so compared to some of the shops in Portland but that's an easy oversight since the taps make up for it.  Additionally, the bottles turn over relatively quickly and are all refrigerated so you're less likely to a skunked older bottle.\\n\\nThey now have some outdoor seating (less than ideal but it works).  They have free wi-fi which is nice.  They are going to open up into the space next door sometime in 2014 and serve a small menu.

I drive by it a lot, and kept thinking...we really need to try that place.  First impression:  gravel and pot-holed parking lot behind the building.  One spot was marked handicapped by a sign-post poking up out of a bucket of concrete.  We make our way up a few rickety steps to the door, walk in, and find ourselves in this weird little dark hallway with some junk sitting in the corner.  We proceed to what appears to be the actual restaurant, entering the dining room that sits adjacent to the bar.  The overhead fluorescent lights are blaring at us like we have just entered a high school science classroom.  An old, grungy one lined with 8-foot banquet tables covered in red and white checked plastic table cloths.  I desperately did not want to eat dinner in this room, so we moved on to the bar area...packed.  Not a seat available.  We reluctantly headed back to the dining room, where two or three banquet tables sat empty.  We took our seats and began perusing the menu.  No one came to take our drink order.  And no one came.  And no one came.  We both looked at each other and said simultaneously, \\"You wanna get out of here?\\"  There was no need to wait for an answer; we jumped right up from that table and bolted.\\n\\nI'm giving the place zero stars for ambiance and service.

They have two ATMs for your convenience.

I told the server that we could not eat gluten products, so he took the bread off the mussels and said you're all set. I told him we could not eat the mussels because they have now been contaminated, would you please make a new order. He took the mussels away.

You enter into a large, high-ceilinged bar that sports a delightfully absurd three-tiered chandelier, stool seating and music that is present and hip.  Then, when you enter the dining area, a little miracle happens.  The music goes into the background, and you are surrounded by comfort and creativity.  The first is achieved by the installation of sound absorbing panels throughout the room.  These panels are disguised to appear purely architectural, so they look decorative rather than industrial.  They absorb much of the loudness of the music - enough so we could converse at a normal voice level.  The comfort comes from the room itself, with cozy seating and cushy upholstery.  The creativity comes from the original art that is installed throughout the restaurant.  All the art is for sale, as is the chandelier, and if you have any questions about the art, someone on the staff can answer them.  Speaking of the staff, I can't recall being in a restaurant with a staff that was more attentive, yet unobtrusive, than here. \\n\\nYouthful enthusiasm is to be found in the food, as well, which is often as creative as the art on the walls.  Creativity involves taking risks, and sometimes they are successful, other times not.  Crisp pork belly with caramelized apple puree is a winner, as is the duck confit with dates and aioli.  Mushroom dumplings were luscious and comforting on a cold, windy night.  The duck breast with wine vinegar caramel was just right, and you can't go wrong with filet mignon, which was served rare, as ordered.  The Korobuta pork tenderloin, also served on the rare side, was incredibly tender and delicious, but really, fourme d'ambert cheese and pine nut brittle?  I ate the pork, which was fine on its own, and ate the cheese as a separate course.  As for the pine nut brittle: I wasn't ready for dessert.  This was a puzzler rather than a disaster.\\n\\nWhen it was time for dessert, the chestnut Mont Blanc with vanilla tiles and coffee meringues was quite fine.  I don't know how the vanilla tiles are made.  They could be meringues, but I think we are entering the laboratory.  Also from the lab were crunchy, wiry garnishes found on Newton's Apple dessert.  This is a clever dessert that presents the apple in several forms from fragrant poached to zingy raw.  As it turns out, the crunchy garnishes were shredded apples that had been exposed to some type of gas.  Don't try this at home.  The dessert also comes with thinly sliced celery, which went surprisingly well with the apples.\\n\\nI liked Liquid Art House very much.  It is satisfying on every level.

My group ended up having 4 of those bottles.  And then the bill came.  They charged me $85 per bottle instead of $45.  I thought they were trying to pull a fast one, thinking we were all drunk.  So, I asked her what was going on, she said that this was the price, $85, and I must have been looking at the \\"downstairs\\" menu.  That upstairs had different prices.  Mind you, this was the week they opened.  Fair mistake, I accept it, but it is their mistake for giving me the wrong menu.  Umm.. that's not what that manager thought, he basically wanted to tell me tough shit... pay the bill.  Luckily I talked a little sense into him and he gave me the price on the menu.  He didn't do this happily, nor did he care for me at all... basically wanted me to pay and get out... I was not rude, just so you know.  \\n\\nAs much as I liked the place, I've avoided it since, going back 5 or 6 times in the last year or more since they opened.  Every time I go, I feel like the bartenders and staff get slower, care less, and try to act cool more... this place had so much potential, and I despise it so much now.\\n\\nI was there last night and a girl in our party was feeling a little ill due to the crowds at the bar.  She asked the bartender 6 times for a glass of water and with increasing amount of urgency in her voice each time.  Explaining that she wasn't feel so well.  The bartender just kept saying, \\"I'll be right with you, hang on\\"... then, she fainted from the heat of the crowd around her. Oh my guys, just give the poor girl some water, she was obviously in need of it.  Even if you want to buy a drink, each round will take you a good 45 minutes to get.  \\n\\nIt is such a shame... I kind of dug the seedyness of the joint, but I will not go back... hopefully ever.  I would stay away unfortunately."},{"name":"Craigie On Main","address":"853 Main St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"One of my favorite restaurants in the Boston area.

We initially had questions for an upcoming family event we were planning and they treated us like old friends, answering all our questions but in the friendliest way possible.

They just seem like genuinely nice people. Once we decided to have a drink or two before eating and on top of bread they brought us these little salmon/veg/some kind of cream cheese appetizers just as a nicety. They didn't charge us and we hadn't committed to dining there, they just did it to be nice. I haven't felt this welcome in a restaurant in ages, maybe not ever in the Boston area...reminded me of traveling abroad where servers are just nice because they want to be.

I said \\"I'm sorry, can I get a glass with salt?\\" He took a small glass threw some salt in it and handed it to me, I then said \\"no, I'm sorry......can I get a tall beer glass with salt around the rim?\\"  I kept apologizing thinking he might say \\"oh no problem,\\" or something along those lines but he just seemed so freaking annoyed. We each had one drink and then I  asked for my tab.   My girlfriend thought that would be cue enough for him to understand that she needed to close out her tab as well (as we came in together)..... he hands me my check and then she finally goes \\"can I get mine, too?\\" Ummmm duh.....Maybe he should spend less time on his cell phone and more time paying attention to customers and then he'll move up to the big boys bar."},{"name":"Stats","address":"300 Marietta St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"After an entire year of lurking on the review boards, I finally hit Stats. We were downtown before a Hawks game (Hey! They're doing well so far this year!) and decided to try out Stats. It's an easy walk from the Philips Arena/CNN Center area. The building itself is very cool and I was very impressed with the decor. Because this is downtown, be prepared to pay the higher drink and food prices. You just have to suck it up. Yuengling bottles of Black and Tan were $5 a piece. They were offering specials on Bacardi mixed drinks also at $5 which was the best value on the night. We sampled the guac and the wings apps. The wings were o.k., but the guac was very fresh and was pretty top-notch for a non mexican joint. The cobb salad was a huge portion at $13. I wasn't blown away, but it was a big serving of grilled chicken. Others order the Turkey dinner. While they cleaned their plates, the serving seemed a bit on the small side. We opted to drink our desserts and our total bill for 4 peeps was about $160. Would I go back? Not sure. It was nice trying out a new place, but I'm not sure if it was really that much better than Taco Mac where I could save a few bucks.  Oh, yea!!  Special - new to me - tip!  Hope it's cool to post this website:  http://www.downtownconnectscard.com/  Just print the card and you'll save 10% off food at a ton of downtown spots! This was true at Stats and saved us about 7 bucks...which means we ate $70 and drank $90.

When we came in we were offered the table right by the door.  Being cold out, we asked if we could get another table.  Nope.  The waitress treated us like it was some big deal request.  So we were seated and almost immediately half of the restaurant opened up.  As people were coming and going we were treated to a wintry blast of cold air every few seconds at this table.  We finally asked if we could move to one of the open tables.  The waitress said no, because they those tables were in a different section.  She then indicated we could sit at the big table for 7, since that was in her section.  We gratefully accepted and our food came out.\\n\\nAt this point we got a healthy dose of what I'd call willful neglect.  She didn't bother to check up on us except to drop the check off and ask if I needed more of my drink.  I am always a generous tipper.  Even below average service will still get you 20% with me.  I can say that this waitress has the dubious honor of being the only server I've tipped under 15%.\\n\\nThe food was average.

I am still thinking about this meal after returning to my hotel room.  Spectacular seems overwrought, but it is the only word that I can come back to.  This restaurant was an afterthought.

It was, by the way, the Stuffed Jerusalem Artichoke.  Highly recommend it.\\n\\nAdditionally, he sold me on the special of the day which was lobster ravioli.  Trust me, I know what you're thinking - it's the same frozen lobster ravioli that every Italian place serves.  No way.  There were big chunks of fresh lobster.  The pasta was clearly fresh made.  The sauce was exquisite.  Nothing bad to say.  Not a bit.  I can't even say that there wasn't enough, it was a perfectly sized entree!\\n\\nMy husband chose off the menu and had a pasta dish with the wild boar.

This was aright and came as a replacement because one of the previous dishes was extremely salty.

The sausage (with liver/heart) was way too salty but the confi pheasant itself was very good. Presentation was quite nice. \\n\\nCourse 7- Pre dessert was amazing.

It simply isn't as important to me as the quality of the food. If you require posh scenery to enjoy your food, I'm afraid Aki might actually disappoint you. Atmosphere isn't what Aki does best. Authentic Japanese cuisine however, it does very well. If you judge its authenticity soley on its clientele, you'll find on any given day, the majority of its patrons are Japanese. I've eaten here twice. The first time I ate at Aki, I had a lunch sushi platter. This brings me to my first point. Aki is VERY reasonably priced. I was able to eat a very tasty sushi platter for 8.75. As Aki serves green tea complimentary with all meals, that meant I didn't have to pay for a beverage. My meal included Miso soup, which is how I like to begin any sushi experience. I ate my meal at the Sushi bar. The sushi here is very fresh and very tasty, and if I may say, even the temperature of the sushi is perfect. I won't spend too much time on my sushi review though because the sushi is very well reviewed here on Yelp. However, on my second visit I tried something I had never had before. I had the katsu don. If you've never enjoyed an authentic Japanese rice bowl, I very highly recommend you stop at Aki and try the katsu don. This is a rice bowl with strips of tonkatsu (a breaded pork cutlet), with thinly sliced strips of onion and shallot and fried eggy all on top of a bowl of rice. I don't know how to describe it and do it justice. As an American, \\"rice bows with pork cutlets over a bowl of rice\\" doesn't sound as incredible as it really is. I know how I can describe it...as the Japanese equivalent of soul food. As being incredibly fulfilling and hearty. Incredibly satisfying. I feel like most of the menu is overlooked by the average American visitor because we think instantly that sushi is what they do, and probably what they do best. I feel this would be a mistake and would lend to us missing out on some true culinary treats. There are other rice bowls on the menu, and I plan on trying them all in time. Gyu don (beef rice bowl) is very popular, and a friend of mine recommended I try the unagi don (grilled eel rice bowl), but you always remember your first time, and I'll never forget that first katsu don I enjoyed at Aki."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"This is very good barbecue.

While there was plenty of seating still available, there were only two employees working both the kitchen and the register, and boy were they busy. It took one of them about 5 minutes to come and take my order, but I didn't mind because I wasn't in any sort of hurry. \\n\\nNow, I'm usually not one to care much about service--especially at a place like Kal√© where you just grab your food from the counter when you hear your name--but this seemed to be an especially incompetent employee. The gist of the situation (which I eventually uncovered from the other employee working) was that they were totally out of white rice, and running low on brown rice. As a stopgap measure, they were offering some of us brown rice instead of white rice at no extra cost. That makes sense, right? However, here's how my conversation went:\\n\\nMe: Can I get a Kal√© rice with chicken please?\\nEmployee: Sure, one chicken katsu\\nMe: Not the katsu, just the regular chicken curry\\nEmployee: Ok. We're out of rice.\\nMe: Oh?\\n*awkward silence for a while*\\nMe: Er, when will you have rice again?\\nEmployee: We only have brown rice\\nMe: Ok, but that costs extra right?\\nEmployee: Yeah, but you don't need to pay extra\\n\\nAt this point, I was visibly confused, but fortunately the other employee came over and explained what the situation was. Once I understood, I was more than happy to have my curry with brown rice--and it was a good meal! Definitely a nice, tasty rendition of Japanese comfort food. I also greatly appreciated that cold barley tea was available on tap for customers to drink at no extra cost. However, come on Kal√©--if you're popular enough that you sometimes run out of rice (popularity is not a bad thing!), at least teach your employees to communicate this in a clearer fashion!"},{"name":"Double Comfort Restaurant","address":"505 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"First time in the door for some comfort food.

If I had to recommend something, it would be the sushi combo #1 with the super crunch and tokyo rolls, with a shared starter of basil rolls.  On the whole, the sushi combos are fairly cheap if you're into maki (like me!) and the fish (both times) was fresh enough to potentially tempt me into sashimi territory for future trips, plus the thai was good enough to bring them to top of mind for carry out.  \\n\\nThough I've only been there twice I'm surprised this place only rates 3.5 yelp stars overall - I give them a solid 4 stars and would consider a 4.5 if I had the option."},{"name":"LongHorn Steakhouse","address":"309 N Alafaya Trl","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"I live close to this place and always recommend it as a safe alternative to the 'regular' chains for nonFloridians.

Salt Lick is a rare case of the sauce being well-suited to the meat in terms of balance and flavor profile. They make a great pair. And both the traditional and the habenero versions are quite tasty.\\n\\nBut make no mistake about it: this place isn't serious about brisket, which is the king meat in this state. I wouldn't recommend eating it without the sauce. And the sausage is very forgettable. I wouldn't waste my time with it.\\n\\nOn the other hand, the pork ribs are usually very good, and the beef ribs are both excellent and unique. They serve the back variety, which is unusual among places that offer beef ribs (the meatier, fattier, short ribs are more common). But the beef ribs here, with the sauce, make for a warm, chewy, melty, tender, sweet, spicy, smoky mess. Without them, I'd only give the place 2 stars, and I'd never have a reason to go back.\\n\\nThere is also the \\"experience\\" factor of driving out into the country, Bing YOB, and listening to live music as you wait (a while) for a seat. But you can get the same food in Round Rock now without the wait. And the all-you-can eat concept is unusual for Texas BBQ. Whether it's a good or bad thing, you decide; the quality of the meat tends to decrease the more you order, which is annoying. But the cobbler does make for a darn good desert.\\n\\nIf you think this is the best BBQ around, do yourself a favor and try Franklin or John Mueller in Austin, or, better yet, go to Lockhart or Lexington or Taylor or Llano or Luling and try some of the great old pillars of the form."},{"name":"Ocean Wave By Harry And Sons","address":"820 N Highland Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Definitely not the most authentic food you'll get.

All of our experiences have been consistently bad.  Our first time, we waited over an hour for our food and our entire meal was actually comp'ed by the manager because it was such a disaster. Another time, I got the Caesar salad with chicken and was disappointed because what I thought would be grilled chicken ended up being breaded chicken that seemed like it came out of the freezer. Tonight, my husband ordered a Kolsh, which apparently had run out, so he ordered a Guinness which also was out. So he was given a chocolate porter that he never would have ordered for himself and was charged $5.50 for it. He ordered the pub burger with cheddar, which for $10.25 is a little pricey. The menu said it would come with lettuce, tomato and pickled red onion. Out came an overdone burger with cheese and nothing else. No veggies, no garnish, no special sauce, no nothing. We've kept coming back due to the convenient location, but we are throwing in the towel and will find a new sports bar.

The performers will come out a few times during your meal, but are not out there constantly (they need a break too!).  The food is great, and they're famous for their bread pudding.  I am NOT usually a fan of bread pudding, but our server talked me into trying it and now I can't imagine ordering anything else for dessert here.  JUST the bread pudding is enough to make me return!

The parking situation here is a nightmare. If you need to go to any of the eateries down there (Hula Hut, Cain's, Mozart's), consider carpooling with your buddies. \\n2. The coffee, while nice, is nothing to write home about. I can do a better drip at home and there are so, so many better espresso joints closer to town. \\n3. The limited dessert selection! Is it just me or did Mozart's really scale back on their desserts? I remember two overflowing cases of cakes, pies, cookies, cupcakes, and more. Now it's just one sad, half-filled case. Boo. \\n4. The lack of inside tables and the lack of outlets needed for studying. Coffee and electricity help most people study. Why can't Mozart's get even one of those right?\\n5. The outhouse-style restrooms. I don't like going outdoors. It's weird. Why can't the restrooms be located inside the building?\\n\\nThe pros:\\n1. The patio.

I don't know if there was some technical reason why it didn't qualify for Texas Monthly's Top 50 BBQ restaurants in Texas, but it's telling that it didn't make the list. And with so much first-rate 'cue within driving distance of Austin, why all the hype? \\n\\nI'm convinced most of the draw is the \\"experience,\\" which is usually relayed as a beautiful drive through the country to a wood and stone compound where you can relax outdoors under the trees with a cold Shiner from your own cooler while you wait to be seated for a family-style feast. Allow me to pour cold water on this tale. First, while the \\"country drive\\" was somewhat enjoyable ten years ago, now you'll be motoring down a well-traveled thoroughfare through an increasingly over-developed exurbia. It's just not that charming any more. And then there's the wait. If you go on a weekend afternoon, you're looking at about an hour wait for a meal that will arrive quickly and last about 10 minutes. And, yeah, you can suck down cold Shiners under the trees while you wait, but you'll be doing that to the (loud) tune of a third-rate band and the conversations of the couple of hundred people who are waiting there cheek-to-jowl with you. \\n\\nMaybe an hour's worth of beer chugging numbs the taste buds for what comes next. The BBQ is not bad, but it's nothing special either, and the quality has definitely declined over the last 10 years. It's certainly not pilgrimage worthy. If you ask for the fatty brisket, that's the best of the lot. But the sausage, ribs, and fowl are just so-so. The spicy sauce is decent, but I wouldn't buy any to take home. \\nAs for the sides, yes, the potato salad is different, but not in a good way. Mine was dry as dust and almost flavorless. Nothing distinctive about the slaw or beans either. \\n\\nBottom line: The Salt Lick is now more of an ordeal than an experience.

The owner left a card on our table for my boyfriend's birthday. I really appreciated this personal touch. We had to wait 10 minutes for our table so our first few drinks were free! Not expected at all, what 10 minutes? They actually took 3 drinks off the bill. I now know what judges on Top Chef are talking about when they refer to \\"the marrying of flavors, and using texture to compliment a dish.\\" This place is a grand architect of food and drinks. I have never had a drink with both juniper and sage and it was extraordinary. The 10 course tasting is not for the faint of heart, it is a lot of food, but spread out so it is not overwhelming. This process does take up to 3hours. This is totally worth it and something I recommend everyone try at least once. Apologies, there were so many complex parts to our 10 courses I couldn't name them all, but I devoured ever morsel.

Nothing I say could possibly hurt anything, so I will tell you the truth, from somebody who actually does know pizza pretty well. Not to mention, thanks to that there secret Yelp algorithm my review, which is the latest, will somehow end up at the bottom of the page.\\n\\nIt is competent pizza, and probably as close to Vera Pizza Napoletana (VPN or STG) pizza you are going to find in Atlanta. However it's certainly not the best I've ever had, or even recently, but to read some of the other reviews you'd think it was the most fantastic thing ever to come out of an oven.\\n\\nAlthough Antico is not actually certified by the VPN authorities, they use the STG and VPN designation liberally on their website. Honestly I am surprised that a pizzeria has been able to so strongly suggest it is VPN certified when it is not. \\n\\nAnyway, after visiting Antico, perusing the kitchen, and watching the pizzas being made, I can point out several deviations from the VPN specification. I'd be all for those deviations if they improved the product, but they don't. The result in all honesty is a disappointingly mediocre pizza, all the more disappointing against the backdrop of hype. \\n\\nOur table ordered several pizzas. San Gennaro was the best; the other two were somewhat mediocre and boring. My favorite thing about the experience is the cup of Calabrian peppers at the table. I can't find those anywhere in Atlanta. \\n\\nSuffice it to say the sauce is the problem. It is clearly not strained enough. The tomatoes also appear to be mechanically crushed by a blender or food processor, not by hand, as is required (the website says hand-crushed but I don't believe it). So you have a very loose, wet and runny sauce. \\nAll this results in an extremely wet pizza. So wet that 2 minutes in a 900 degree oven cannot overcome the moisture load. You end up with a pizza that sogs and steams out within minutes of hitting the table. Almost inedible within 10 minutes without knife and fork.\\n\\nThere were other variations from the VPN spec that I'd rather not get into here. We can talk about them in person sometime. It's not like they're hurting for business. \\n\\nThis is what the wasp crowd goes crazy for--quirky space, no drinks, no service, let's eat in the kitchen, like poor people--it'll be fun! We can pretend to be Italian peasants. \\n\\nHonestly the entire crowd looked so damn white I thought there was a national Lacrosse championship going on outside. I haven't seen that many pink Polo shirts since I graduated UGA.\\n\\nAnyway, it's good, but not THAT good. Definitely didn't blow my skirt up like I was expecting.

Visually it's not what I was expecting for a place that serves sushi but food is far more than aesthetics so.. moving on...\\n\\n In the restaurant industry we often say that if the diner has bad service then their perception of the food,  no matter how good it actually is, will also start to suffer. Conversely if the service is stellar and the food is merely average, the positive experience will tend to raise the food up with it. If both food and service are weak, your restaurant is not making up for one or the other and that's a bad place to be. That was my experience at Harry and Sons.\\n\\nOur server put the bare minimum of effort into our experience and we had to flag him down for everything.

I felt like I had to try it, to really see what all the fuss was about!  We made the drive out to Driftwood through country roads and arrived here to see a packed parking lot on a Sunday afternoon for lunch time.  Once you arrive, you will see different lines-to go order line, and the regular restaurant line.  If you order in the to-go line, you can seat yourself outside in the open patio.  They have live music and entertainment here.  If you put your name down for the restaurant seating, they will give you a buzzer and have you wait until your table is ready.  The place is very rustic and you really feel like you are out in the country side.  We sat in the restaurant and ordered a brisket plate and beef ribs plate.  They also serve bison ribs, bbq chicken and a few other meat options.  For the sides, you do not have a large selection here.  The standard plate comes with german-style potato salad, coleslaw and baked beans.  They will give you bread, pickles and onions upon request.  The meat arrived and the food was definitely delicious.  However, it had more of a sweet taste than a smoky taste.  I could tell that they had added marinade to their meat-not that this is a bad thing!  Since I prefer a smoky taste, I actually enjoyed Terry Black's BBQ more than Salt Lick's beef ribs and brisket.  The sides were good but it would have been nice to have more variety to choose from.  We passed on dessert, but I noticed they have pecan pie and cobblers.  I would say coming to Salt Lick was mostly for the Texas country experience and worth the drive.

At Barcelona they use the big shrimp (about the size of a thumb), sliced garlic, and chili peppers. \\n\\n- Plancha: not at all like they do it in Spain, but it tasted ok.\\n\\n- Boquerones: A serving of Boquerones in Spain is never less than 10-15 fish, yet at Barcelona they only serve 6 of them. \\n\\n- Paella: We have to say that the paella at Barcelona is pretty good. We ordered a mixed paella (seafood and meat), and the taste was impeccable. However, just two little suggestions: use more saffron (the rice was quite white), and, for the meat paella, use chicken rather than pork, as well as chorizo rather than the sausage that was in it.\\n\\n- Croquetas de manchego y jamon: Simply delicious\\n\\n- Figs with sweet and sour chorizo: though this isn't a dish we had ever had in Spain, it was still quite tasty.

I am certainly not the first to make this statement, but I'll say it anyway. I took my family, who were visiting from western Pennsylvania, and my boyfriend here this past weekend. Our group included myself, my sister and mom, who are always up for trying something new, and my dad and my man, neither of whom like the city or like waiting and would really rather just stick to what they know and love. \\n\\nOur wait was about 40 minutes on a busy Saturday night (near impossible for the mensfolk). We were fortunate that we had such a lovely weather evening while outside, however I will mention that the line was formed right along a sewage grate.....pew! Once inside I think the boys' tensions eased up considerably with the amazing food smells. The cozy 10-table atmosphere contributed to our close family outing....very casual, borderline noisy (which was totally our thing, being loud part-Italians ourselves). Our waiter was a local Bostonian, complete with Southie drawl and macho funny guy demeanor. He was quick and efficient but provided awesome, thorough service and kept us laughing throughout the whole meal. \\n\\nNow food....\\n\\nWe started with a large order of calamari, which is lightly breaded and fried with hot pepper rings, was the most tender and delicious calamari I've ever had! My mom usually swears off calamari because of what it does to her stomach, but couldn't help herself with Giacomo's appetizer. The large order was perfect for our party of 5 as a little tide-me-over. It came while we were still deliberating over the menu which helped ease our grumbling bellies and unsure minds (like many other reviewers said, it was so hard to pick just one meal for each of us!) \\n\\nWe ordered 1) clams and mussels fra diavlo, a perfectly spicy marinara (the heat can be customized) with super fresh shellfish over nice firm linguini noodles, 2) two orders of shrimp and scallops with Giacomo sauce, a light lobster and tomato cream sauce that was neither too heavy or too wimpy, also over linguini, 3) veal marsala, super tender meat , not too heavily breaded with proscuitto and the most fragrant and delicious marsala sauce (served with linguini marinara on the side), and 4) lobster ravioli, the perfect sized portion with an amazingly light garlic and (really fragrant!) basil cream sauce. There's nothing any of us would have changed about our entrees The flavors were perfect and there was plenty for each of us to share. \\n\\nMy dad, who came into the restaurant wanting lame-o spaghetti and meatballs (which Giacomo's doesn't make regularly) so as not to be difficult, was blown away by the food, saying he'd never tasted Italian food like this before. He also didn't complain about the prices, and this man ALWAYS complains about restaurant prices, especially in Boston. My mom, who is full Italian, said she hadn't tasted food this delicious since before her nanna passed away. And my boyfriend, who can be a picky brat of an eater and who also won't usually put a bite of seafood in his mouth, sampled all of the entrees and said there wasn't anything he wouldn't want to gorge on. My sister and I, the least picky of the group, of course loved every bit of it, including the crowded sidewalks getting to the restaurant, and we weren't even too bothered by the sewage grate or the wait outside. \\n\\nAll in all, a kick-ass place.

I had high hopes for this dinner because we had been to this location at least a couple of times, in addition to other locations in Chicago and Las Vegas. \\n\\nFirst, we were put in a tiny room called \\"The Vault\\" which had maybe 6 tables. There was barely audible music, so basically each table could hear each other conversing if we weren't whispering. That was a little off-putting and awkward. I should have requested a new table in the regular dining room, but I didn't want to be a pain so I didn't say anything.\\n\\nOur waiter greeted us, \\"First time dining with us?\\" which I wasn't really a fan of. No, it's not our first time here. How about, \\"Have you dined with us here before?\\" That would have been less irritating. But whatever.\\n\\nSo we ordered wine, which didn't come, didn't come, didn't come. Someone near us that sat down way after us ordered a specialty cocktail that came before our wine. Really?\\n\\nSo our appetizers came and we had gotten French onion soup and a caprese salad. They forgot to put the balsamic on the salad which I pointed out, so the waiter went and got a small bowl of it for me to put on the salad myself.\\n\\nNot even halfway into the apps the steaks arrived. I had gone to the restroom and returned to find them about to serve us. I was so angry! We had not even finished the soup or salad! I stupidly started eating my salad as quickly as I could. When I turned my attention to my steak, I knew it didn't look right. I had ordered a filet, butterflied, medium well. I don't like a lot of pink, but usually well done gets too charred. Well, this steak was barely even medium. So after rushing to wolf down my salad, I was stuck waiting for my steak to be refired. \\n\\nThe sizzling plate is outdated and needs to be done away with. The steak returned anyone half was cooked correctly and one half was still underdone. However, the plate continued to cook the correct side til it was dry and the butter seemed to have gotten singed in the refire.\\n\\nThe timing issue completely ruined the dinner for me. The waiter said he could hold the steaks, but what-- then they would sit under a heat lamp? They really screwed up.\\n\\nIt wasn't til he brought the check that he told us that he took the apps off since we didn't get to enjoy them, he should have fixed the problem immediately, because then I sat there angry for the rest of my dinner. If he had immediately offered to take the apps off it might have lightened the mood a little. And how about a free dessert to bring home? He offered a dessert but I didn't want to sit there an extra minute. A good gesture would have been to pack one up for us to go and insist that we take it.\\n\\nHonestly, after spending $187 on a dinner that I hardly could enjoy, I am pretty pissed off.

One can eat in or take the meal to a local park right across the street or down the block.  No questions asked, I brought in my email and got a free meal on Saturday night. The staff was laid back, very nice, and friendly.  They even have Japanese magna to look at while waiting for your meal.  I ordered my curry with an add on of spinach, cheese, and egg. It was the Doria rice curry. It tasted really good. It is comfort food......nothing fancy.  One must note that this is Japanese curry.

When our food comes my guests get their food and what do I get?  a bowl of guacamole with chips, a side of beans and a side of rice.   I tell the food runner that it is not what I ordered.

I say to her, I asked for a burrito with Black Beans, Rice and Guacamole, her response?  Oh I must of missed the burrito part, really?  at what part after the demo of the size of the burrito with your forearm did you forget that I asked for a burrito?  so she leaves to get me a burrito, a few minutes later she comes with a plate, on it a Burrito with beans and rice on the side and on top of the burrito? Sour Cream and Cheese, inside the Burrito?  get this, CHICKEN, Chicken?  WTF?  I'm a vegetarian, over 16 years, why would I order a chicken burrito?  then she says, wait, so you want a burrito with Beans, Rice and Guacamole only?  Mmmmm... yeah, that is exactly what I said the first time.  I actually got up and walked up to the cooks (the kitchen is open to the restaurant)  and I told them in Spanish (I speak 4 languages, Spanish being one of them)  and told the guy that I have no idea what she keeps ordering but all I want in my burrito is Black Beans, Rice and Guacamole, guy looks at me and the says no problem.   Finally 5 minutes later I get what I asked for (by this time our guests have finished their meal)  finally with my burrito (taste is subpar at best).

The hostess and the server were very polite and attentive. My rating more-so applies to the food. We didn't order any appetizers because they ran out of the one thing we wanted to try. The ramen was overall good but I felt the portions were a bit small for the price. The flavor itself wasn't extraordinary and there was very little meat in each bowl.

The first time I went was dinner in the winter, and we had a really great, convivial dining experience.  The prices were just a teensy bit spendy but I thought at the time that the quality and experience justified the price tag.\\n\\nNow, not so much.  Going there for after-work drinks was a different matter.  The bar area is awkward and not conducive to good times.  I think we all understand that you pay premiums for drinkies when it means you're in a nice environment where you can see and be seen.  Paying that much for a drink and sitting awkwardly against the window makes me sad.\\n\\nBut it's been my three lunch experiences that have made it highly unlikely that I'll be taking another chance on Daedalus.  It is really nice to dine outside, but I'd also like some service if I'm treating myself to a $15 salad.  Where is the waitress?  She's gone.  You'll never see her again, even when you've made it clear you have a limited lunch time.  The food takes forever, and for what it costs, isn't worth it.

Hot lattes are served in a tall clear glass that took my husband and I back to London. The coffee was expertly made and so enjoyable.\\n\\nSomething worth mentioning is that this is a no-tipping establishment. Everything is included in the menu prices, which means the employees get paid fair wages and do not rely on tips. This honestly makes me so happy to see.

Night two marked our visit to Giacomo's, TDC's division rival and sworn blood enemy [citation needed]. Since these two bitter rivals are located just a block or two away and serve similar seafood-themed Italian food, it seemed only fair to compare them directly to help you out. \\n\\nMenu Availability:\\n*The Daily Catch, as their name suggests, serves only what they caught that day. \\n*Giacomo's has a more trustworthy menu that does not seem to rely on the whims of the local seafood or noodle-catching industry. \\nWINNER: Giacomo's \\n\\nWait time / Seating Arrangements\\n*The Daily Catch has a seating occupancy of exactly 20 chairs. The place is hectic, small, and very Boston. There is a line out the door, and I can use present tense because I'm positive that there is a line RIGHT NOW as you read this. Inside, the place is cozy, so be prepared to make new friends and share a table for four with another couple. \\n*Giacomo's, on the other hand, had an even longer line (about an hour and a half wait). Fortunately time flies when you're waiting in line drunk after a brewery tour, so it didn't seem that bad. The line gives you a great chance to people watch, catch up with your dining parter/group, and generally stand in one place for longer than one usually does so. Inside, we shared a table with two different couples. Neither had a Boston accent, so we considered this a huge victory. \\nWINNER: The Daily Catch\\n\\nPopulation:\\n*The Daily Catch will have over 50% Asians (so you know it's good), but you will be overwhelmed with Boston accents from everyone else, including (especially) the staff. There will be a lot of screaming, which is apparently how people talk up here. \\n*Giacomo's is a fairly standard restaurant.\\nWINNER: Tie\\n\\nFood\\nWho cares about food, let's skip that part. \\n\\nFood\\nJust kidding, here come the reviews. \\n*The Daily Catch: luckily, they had caught some delicious fish that day. We got the appetizer portion of the black pasta aglio olio (apparently they use squid ink to make their pasta harder to find at night), which was one of the top 5 pasta dishes I've ever eaten, and I can cook a mean macaroni. Warning: if you don't like garlic, or are a vampire, or are afraid that squids are always watching you and will know you ate their ink, avoid this dish. If none of those apply, you NEED to eat this. Both the aglio olio and the puttanesca are out of this world. It's worth stopping here just to try them. We also got the Fra Diavolo (for two), which is one of the more overwhelming dishes I've ever seen, what with the ridiculous amount and variety of seafood. It was a very good dish but for $70+ I wouldn't get it again. But that squid ink pasta...spoiler, we came back again to get more of it  \\n*Giacomo's wants you to like them in spite of their flaws (the wait), and to do so they bribe you with delicious food and fantastic service. As far as bribes go, this makes sense as the choice for a restaurant. Anyway, we started with the fried calamari and the garlic bread, then moved on to our main dishes of pasta with salmon and sun dried tomato and fusilli with seafood and fra como sauce (a half and half mix of two sauces). The calamari was delicious but heavy, and the garlic bread was heavy but delicious - calamari won our appetizer mini battle. The pasta was unbelievable. Both dishes were so good that I could eat them every day for the rest of my life, assuming I won some sort of lottery and also lost some sort of bet where I had to only eat one food. Overall I left ridiculously full and ridiculously satisfied. That was some GREAT pasta. \\nWINNER: Giacomo's  \\n\\nService\\n*The Daily Catch wants you to hang out, eat slowly, and infuriate the people waiting outside in line who can see inside and watch you prevent them from eating. They will bring your food eventually, when they feel like it. You won't care because it's delicious. \\n*Giacomo'swantsyoutoleaveassoonaspossiblesohurryupandeatandleave\\nWINNER: Giacomo's - you wait for an hour and a half to eat for half an hour, but they get your food out quickly so you're not waiting around. \\n\\nNote: The Daily Catch is cash only. So is Giacomo's. \\nWINNER: Tie\\n\\n\\nOverall\\nI liked Giacomo's better, but it depends on what you're looking for. You can't go wrong with either place.

A little on the dry side. The marinated prunes packed a huge punch of flavor and not one I enjoyed so much. \\n- Shared the mussels in white wine sauce and braised lamb shank. The mussels were good but not the best I have tasted. It's too bad the best one was cooked up by one of my drunk friends and he has no idea how he made it. Bread should come free with this to dip in the broth but that's an extra $3. \\n- The lamb was cooked to perfection. Meat just fell off the bone. Good but hard to enjoy because I was so stuffed from the mussels already. Would've just cancelled this order.\\n\\nDRINKS:\\n- Fruli was good. Perfect girly drink. Light beer with a strawberry taste to it.\\n- Chimay White was too sweet for me.\\n\\nThe only downside was them not doing anything special for my GF's birthday. I know they read my online request because the hostess acknowledged my window seating request. I stated that we were first timers in Vancouver and dining for her birthday. A complimentary dessert would have been nice. Oh well!"},{"name":"Atlanta Breakfast Club","address":"249 Ivan Allen Jr Blvd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"This is a great place to start your day simple atmosphere but eclectic.

Given their small size, a mildly busy night makes the place appear packed and bustling.  Even on a cold night in February, you are putting your name on the list for a short wait, gathering anticipation watching plates being delivered, making the eventual seating at a cramped table seem like a reward unto itself.  And during the warmer times of the year, people line up to sit outside and enjoy the scenic view of traffic rumble along Glisan.\\n\\nOf course this business model would be a FAIL if it wasn't for the great food they serve up.  On a recent visit, I enjoyed the Lengua en Salsa, a well balanced pork dish with a mildly spicy creole sauce accented with sweet raisins and almonds while my partner devoured the always delicious Plato Cubano.  I always get a Michelada as, like a good bloody mary, it can be hard to find one exactly how you like it and Pambiche serves up a great version.\\n\\nThe desserts are also decent, flan is velvety smooth with a mild flavor.  The Tres Leches is okay but a little too cake like, not as soaked as I've traditionally had and a bit overpowered with by the coconut frosting.\\n\\nOverall Pambiche is a great little place with attentive service and great food.

It's in a very old building that I've heard is a former brothel and speakeasy. Brick walls, wood floors, a dark, warm, lamp-lit atmosphere. The tables are close together surrounding a small bar. It's a small space; almost always crowded. The front windows look out on the intersection of Mohawk and Kossuth - German Village is a cool sight while enjoying a delicious meal. \\n\\nThe service: EXCELLENT! I've been to the Mohawk twice, and both times I've been seated promptly. My server each time was top-notch. The first waitress I had was literally one of the nicest people I've ever met! Even though the place was packed during both of my visits, our food came out quickly. \\n\\nThe food: I've had too different dishes at the Mohawk: the first was the bratwurst sandwich with potato pancakes. It was one of the best I've had, and easily rivaled Schmidts' brat sandwiches a few blocks away. The second time I had the famous Mother Mohawk sandwich. The sandwich was on rye bread with a heaping pile of roast beef covered in warm chicken salad. One of the best sandwiches I've ever tasted! I've also had an appetizer: the blue cheese kettle chips. They were great. I went once with my girlfriend, and she had ravioli and enjoyed it. I went once with my mom, and she had the Reuben, and enjoyed it very much as well. I've had carrot cake at the Mohawk once, and my girlfriend tried a pumpkin roll. They were both DELICIOUS. The waitress informed us that they bake their desserts daily, and feature different ones each night. \\n\\nThe drinks:\\nTop-notch rotating beer selection for a restaurant this size! They've got the normal standard beers on tap, and last time I went they had a few Great Lakes brews, as well as a few Elevator Brewery selections on tap. My girlfriend had a cosmo and enjoyed that. \\n\\nThe prices: very reasonable for the food, service, and location. \\n\\nThe crowd: normally pretty busy, but the staff handles the rush well, and the German Village patrons are nice and friendly. \\n\\nOverall: I can't find anything to complain about!

That is a shockingly good deal, especially given how good the meat is here. Instead, we ordered quite a restrained amount:\\n\\n- Marino's Triple Chop Sandwich ($10)\\nThis was a giant sandwich that was near impossible to pick up, due to the overly soft bread and the fact that the large amount of meat was all chopped up into tiny pieces. Tons of the chopped brisket, sausage and ribs fell out each time I picked up the sandwich for a bite. The whole thing was a greasy, fatty mess, but it was pretty delicious. \\n\\n- Combo Plate with Pork Ribs and Brisket ($14)\\nThe pork ribs and brisket were incredible. They were so incredibly moist that there was no need for that orange BBQ sauce. This is also a pretty good deal, as you get pinto beans, cole slaw and a big pile of potato salad as part of the combo.\\n\\n- Chocolate Chip Pecan Pie ($5.25)\\nThis was a great slice of pie to end with. It was filled with tons of chocolate chips, making for a really sweet and rich dessert.\\n\\nOther than if you are doing the Family Style meal, I don't understand why anybody would wait on that long line (we were quoted 45 minutes for a party of 2). Instead, you can walk right up to the counter to place a takeout order, and eat at any of the plenty of nice tables in the outdoor seating area. Maybe if it's unbearably hot you would want to be inside, but otherwise this worked perfectly and we were enjoying our delicious meat an hour earlier.\\n\\nIt's a short drive away from the main part of Austin, but if you are in town it's definitely worth the trip for some seriously good barbecue."},{"name":"The Salt Lick BBQ","address":"18300 Fm 1826","city":"Driftwood","stars":"4","text":"I was anticipating what all the hype was about, and after driving a 30 min drive to Driftwood, i was AMAZED at how beautiful the restaurant & its surroundings were! \\n\\nBrisket was delicious, ribs were alright (a bit too burnt or the meat wasn't as tender), coleslaw was light and not too creamy (pleasantly surprised), bread buns & beans were ordinary.

So much juice, so much oomph. Had I known this was the only real thing I'd enjoy off my plate, I'd have ordered a 2 lbs of this and gone nuts.\\n\\nThe bad: the side dishes are the worst. Yes, a BBQ place should focus on the meat, yet they completely neglected the big picture. Sides do kind of matter in a meal. I had the Thurman's Choice plate which consisted of brisket, pork ribs, sausage, and sides. Aside from the brisket, the entire plate more or less tasted like a school cafeteria cooked it.

I waited over TWO years to go to Barcelona and man oh man do I regret it. I finally went with a friend on a recent Monday night and I get giddy every time I think about returning.  The service, the food, the wine and the atmosphere are without compare. \\n\\nBarcelona is a pretty popular restaurant so most nights you will probably need a reservation.  My friend and I went around 8 on a Monday night and we got two prime seats at the bar. As soon as we sat down, our dear bar tender, server, and new best friend for life poured us a sample of Spanish wine and introduced us to the lovely couple sitting to our left. \\n\\nWe took our time and eventually ordered some wine and 2 tapas - mushrooms with goat cheese and an eggplant dish.  My friend is vegetarian and they have a vast menu with plenty of meat-free options. While we were waiting for our food, the bar tender brought us a free sample of calamari.  It was seriously some of the best I have ever had.  When our food came out, we accidentally received potatoes instead of eggplant.  Our server recognized the error and let us keep the potatoes while he had the kitchen whip up our eggplant.  They were so apologetic about the mix up and the potatoes were cooked in a delicious spice and covered with a creamy, flavorful sauce so we were pretty pumped about it.  \\n\\nIt also happened to be my friends birthday, so once again our favorite server brought us a complimentary warm chocolate cake with ice cream on top for dessert. I really don't think our meal could have been any better.  I personally love small plates of food. I've found some guys are a little opposed to or weirded out by this sort of dinning, but Barcelona is so good that it may change their opinion of tapas. They also do paellas for those looking for a larger meal.\\n\\nThe atmosphere makes me feel like I'm in some swanky big city restaurant. I'm probably not really cool enough to hang out here on the regular, but it's fun to pretend. The space is generally pretty dark with an open kitchen, interesting art pieces on the walls and a wrap around porch for summer brunching. Sitting at the bar is fun because the staff are so friendly and the people around you are chatty and charming. \\n\\nParking is available on the street, valet or there are a few free 2 hour spots in the deck next door.

If you are looking to watch a game, enjoy some food and a pint of your favorite beer, go anywhere else. Seriously. The 7-Eleven around the corner has better quality, ambiance, and service. \\n\\nThe specifics:\\n\\nA good buddy and I were looking to watch CFB in the early afternoon. I live in the building above the Draft Pick but hadn't been there. \\"How bad could it be?\\" I said... Famous last words...\\n\\nMy friend got there first and was seated in the back corner, in a completely empty section. He asked for one of the 30 TVs to be tuned to the Iowa game. The manager informed him that he was, \\"...in Texas\\" and should be watching the UT game. That game was on the other 29 TVs, including the projector (which I'm guessing was from 1997). Begrudgingly, the last TV on the back wall was flipped to his game.\\n\\nNext, in the 5 minutes it took me to meet him, he told the waitress he was waiting for me, at which point she asked him repeatedly how long I was going to be - \\"5 minutes, 10 minutes?\\" Again, there were 8 empty tables in this section and I joined him 5 minutes later. \\n\\nWe then ordered drinks. My Firemans 4 arrived a good 15 minutes after I ordered it, and it tasted off -- skunked and a little flat. Not wanting to be \\"that guy,\\" I let it slide. My buddy got a Bloody Mary, which arrived 10 minutes after my beer. While he sprung for the premium experience, he got a transparent, red-tinged liquid that tasted like watered-down spaghetti-Os, with two sad cocktail olives, a dried out lime wedge, and a sorely lacking celery stalk. It was pitiful and disgusting.\\n\\nWith our game in the second half and other plans for the rest of the afternoon, we were 'pot-committed.' I rolled the dice and upon the waitress' recommendation, ordered the burger. What arrived 25 minutes later was an abomination - a pre-frozen Costco burger cooked to a lovely well-done, underseasoned, with a stale bun, sad tomato slice, wilted lettuce, carelessly topped with a slice of unmelted cheese, along with a smattering of lukewarm fries. Very, very disappointing.\\n\\nWith the game winding down, we asked for our check (the fastest part of the service experience) and left, vowing never to set foot in that dreadful place.\\n\\nLest you think I'm a snooty 'foodie' type, our experience was not isolated. A group of 8 guys nearby watching the UT game were furious when their drinks arrived late and two meals didn't arrive at all; at one point, they even asked to speak with the manager.\\n\\nPlease keep in mind that I live in the building. All that the Draft Pick needed to do was be average, mediocre. If they held serve on the lowest acceptable definition of a sports bar, I would be there often. And I wasn't expecting gourmet burgers or duck fat fries - I just wanted average bar food. A decent burger. Crisp fries. Cold beer that tastes the way it's supposed to taste.\\n\\nA sports bar only needs to do a few things right:\\n\\n1. Show the sports you want to watch\\n2. Serve beer and spirits with adequate care and quality\\n3. Provide average-quality bar food\\n4. Provide the above in a somewhat timely fashion\\n5. Be nice, or at least don't act like your customers are a burden\\n\\nThis bar epically failed on all counts. \\n\\nAustin has an amazing and growing restaurant and bar scene, and you are better served to catch the game anywhere else, like Black Sheep Lodge, Cover 2/3, etc. Compared to the Draft Pick, we would have had a better time grabbing a 6-pack of Lone Star and microwave pizza at the aforementioned 7-Eleven, and then watching the game at my place.\\n\\nEast, South and downtown lack quality sports bars, and with all the recent growth, there is a huge opportunity on E.

Very nice tour; I recommend it. We had some fast passes in the evening, so we needed to kill some time and eat some food. This place is packed, so she stands in line to get the food and I go hunting for a table.\\n\\nI find one that provides us a great view through glass windows of the loading dock of It's a Small World. I never knew this was there, but I liked it. It's always fun to people watch during a meal. For the rest of the atmosphere, it was pretty typical counter service Disney restaurant. There were pictures of Pinocchio here and there. Not bad. Not great.\\n\\nAs for the food, we want something very light, like a snack, so we order and split something that catches our eye as very unique, the Holiday Festival Flatbread (Flatbread topped with Cranberry Barbecue Sauce, Roasted Turkey, Stuffing, Cheese and drizzled with Gravy). I couldn't not get this. We also got a side of French Fries.\\n\\nThe flatbread was perfect. It was hefty enough to hold the topping, but crispy and airy enough to be a flatbread. As for the toppings, the cranberry barbecue sauce was not as exotic as it sounds. It was good. It was a sweeter barbecue sauce with a twinge of berry added to it. It went well with the turkey and the stuffing. The cheese and gravy spread out everywhere was a good finish to the dish. I can't describe how good this thing was. It was awkwardly good.

The restaurant only has valet parking and it is right when you pull in the restaurant, so trying to turn into this place can be a nightmare with all they cars waiting to be valeted. One really cool thing about this place is that they have multiple dining options. They have a hibachi dining, sushi dining, and traditional Tatami room dining. You can make reservations, which is nice, but if you are running late, their text message system alerts you and says that your reservation will be canceled if you are not able to arrive at the restaurant within 5 or 10 minutes. I completely understand where they are coming from, but the delivery of the message felt a little abrupt and made me feel rushed even though I was walking into restaurant just one minute past my reservation time. During this visit, I dined in the sushi room. The restaurant was a nice size and beautifully decorated with authentic Japanese style art. I was excited to see that there was a yelp offer for BOGO sushi rolls, so I ordered the bagel roll and the shrimp tempura roll, both reasonably priced at $9. The sushi rolls tasted okay--nothing special about them. The sushi rolls also kept breaking when I would pick them up with the chop sticks, which made them harder to dip in the soy sauce. For dessert, I got the green tea ice cream. It was a large serving and very good! Our service was great! Our server kept our beverages refilled and helped answer questions about the menu.

The guy at Falafel King was serving other customers and saw me and handed me a falafel dipped with hummus. It was hot, crispy and flavorful. So I bought a hummus salad to take home. It was good. For less than $7, I got pita bread, large portions of hummus (maybe, 2 cups worth or more), salad with cucumber marinated with oliver oil and lemon juice, and two falafels.

There was only one other table but it begin to fill up as we were leaving. House Special restaurant tastes and feels like a modern hipster take on traditional Vietnamese dishes.\\n\\nFood: We ordered the rice paper chips ($3), uncle Hings chicken wings ($12), BBQ pork fry bread ($7) Saigon steak ($20), shaken beef ($17) and birds nest noodle($14).\\nThe rice paper chips were quite tasty and had good seasoning but the chips feel and taste as though they are soaked in oil. (I know they are deep fried chips but maybe work on trying to get rid of at least some of the oil in them.) \\nThe Fry bread was one of my favourite snack breads as I was a kid and it's the reason why I had to come down to the restaurant and try it, I love that they stuffed the usually empty frybread with food  because the savoury BBQ pork with the bitter leafy greens really compliment the sweetness of the frybread. This is definitely of the items you've got to try! \\nUncle Hings chicken wings are described as a spicy fish sauce recipe and they are tasty as well, it smells a lot like honey garlic but tastes Similiar to sweet and spicy, they really weren't too spicy tho, just a little heat on your tongue. Also one of the items I'd recommend! \\nMy boyfriend ordered the Saigon steak, I was disappointed in the flavour of this dish. The presentation was extremely pleasing, but the potatoes tasted like bland potatoes and they were a little too hard for my liking. The steak didn't have anything special on them either, just tasted like a regular steak with almost no seasoning. This dish was a thumbs down for me. \\nThe Birds Nest Noodle was a chunk of crispy rice noodles, sort of like crispy chow mein style on a bed of what they call sauce vert, it tasted a lot like pesto and cilantro, (I wasn't a big fan of the sauce) with mushrooms, corn, bok choy and a soft boiled egg on top, the presentation of this dish was also spectacular, but the flavours really weren't there for me, it tasted very Similiar to a Chinese house special chow mein with less salt, they categorized it under the salads section, so that could be why, but for me it really was just an overglorfied chow mein. I can definitely see some people loving this dish but it just wasn't for me. \\nThe best for last, the Shaken Beef, omg, it is the best beef I have ever had in my entire life, it's sous vide so it's extremely tender, so creamy and basically melts in your mouth. The flavour of it reminds me of this stir-fry dish my mom used to make for me as a kid. The shaken beef was an extremely simple dish with the beef wok-fried in its own juices on a bed of rice, but it is so amazing, it really took me back. I definitely recommend you try this dish!! It's phenomenal. \\nAtmosphere: The atmosphere here is very crisp and clean. The decor is minimal and simplistic, with the furniture also complimenting this, it fits well in Yaletown. They have the bar situated in the middle with the kitchen being half-open concept so you can almost see what they are doing. I love the wall that leads into the bathroom, it has blown-up family portraits of the owners family I suppose, the pictures definitely looked like Vietnamese family style. Very nice touch! Gives it a little bit of a homey/personal touch and cancels out the pretentious vibe that a lot of modern restaurant have.\\nService: I must say I was disappointed to notice that the there is a shared tip-pool here with all of our tips going into a bucket. I should have figured though as three different servers approached us during our meal. Not to say that the service was bad, but it would give me a more personable experience at the restaurant if only one server were taking care of our table. \\n\\nFood: 5/5\\nAtmosphere: 5/5\\nService 4/5 \\n\\nOverall, my experience here was amazing, I will definitely be back and would definitely recommend anyone to come here as the food here is amazing and takes a modern approach on traditional Vietnamese dishes and flavours. Many of the appetizers we got were portioned out as a good amount for two people to share, I would say to get maybe two appys and one main each for a good amount of food, the three entrees we shared between the two of us were way too much food, but I just had to try everything."},{"name":"Chilli Duck Thai Cuisine","address":"829 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Delicious, cheap, Thai.

I wanted to yell, \\"Would you want to eat here?!\\" When they finally seat us, it takes 15 minutes for water and take our order. The things that bothered us was that the staff was NOT understaffed, they were just doing things that didn't have to be done at this moment when you have a customer. The Japanese lady in a kimono seemed like the only one brining out food and talking to people. We felt bad for her and it's not her fault that other servers were incompetent. \\nIt was funny how it took FOREVER to get service and get our food, but when it comes to bringing out the check, it was lightning speed.

Also, it did not taste like it had been seasoned at all.  However, I was pleased with the tenderness of the meat.\\n\\nWe also ordered a side of rice and beans.  The rice was not too dry and was pretty well-seasoned.  The refried beans had bits of ground beef.

Long story short, when the best thing you can get from the menu is an order of fries, one should worry. \\n\\nAnd you know, this could just be another bad restaurant with good intentions that doesn't execute well, but I feel (felt?) drawn to Estelle's because it bills itself as southern. As a Southerner, I'm always interested in New England interpretations of the real thing, but, in my opinion, before you interpret anything, you should know what the original is and master that first. Case in point: greens. If you're in a southern place, you should have greens--preferably collard--on the menu. The chef says he has greens, but they're different types of greens and they're essentially...VEGAN?! Did I just hear everyone I know back in my old Kentucky home roll their eyes and walk away from the table?! \\n\\nPerhaps. Now I know you can do vegan greens, but I'm not going to eat them. I am just not. Maybe a better way to categorize this restaurant is what everyone else has said: a great place to get some beer (extensive, fun menu) and people watch a bit and have...french fries.

To be honest I wasn't expecting much, even while pulling up into the parking lot.  Sure the place looks new, but it also looked really sterile.  My thoughts were more focused on how long the place would actually last.  After trying their product, all those fears went away.  This place will do very well.\\n\\nParking is available in the lot in front of the building.  There aren't too many spots, but as of the time of writing they were sufficient.\\n\\nThe place is a bit understaffed.  When I went, it had only been open for some 3 weeks, so I understand if the operations still had a few kinks being worked out.  The lady behind the counter often disappeared behind the kitchen door for several minutes at a time.\\n\\nAs I didn't know what to try, I ordered 1 of each.  All of them were absolutely delicious, especially with the included dipping sauce.  The only one that stuck out (in a bad way) was the BBQ chicken one, which I found rather dry.  Also, the sauce is too heavy and thick.  For the same price I would recommend the butter chicken one instead.\\n\\nAs Kenneth N. has mentioned, the samosas here are very uniform.  I suspect there's got to be some kind of magical samosa packing machine in the back.  Too bad the door doesn't have a window, or I would've gladly popped my head in for a look and a quick worshipping.  As Kenneth has also mentioned, the samosas aren't greasy at all, unlike pretty much every other place I've ever tried in my life.  Their product is excellent, and I can only hope that they keep up the good work.\\n\\nMy only other complaint is that the samosas aren't bigger.  They're not too bad as a snack at $1-2 each, but order a pile of them and the cost shoots up very quickly.  They're so delicious that I could probably eat 20 of them in 1 sitting.  But this place does offer discounts starting at 5 or more of the same flavour, so the solution is obviously to eat in bulk.\\n\\nWhile I normally wouldn't go out of the way anywhere to pick up samosas, this place has won me over.

I've tried to eat several times and the stars never aligned for whatever reason. This place is very hard to get a reservation and I've tried walking in a couple times and the wait time was usually an hour plus. The food was good, but not great, the beer is AWESOME, and the service is very good. The ambiance is very cool and industrial which can get a little loud in the dining room due to all the concrete. We sat on the patio which was heated and was actually warmer than inside which the ladies appreciated. The patio is reserved for walk-ins, so this is your best bet if you are walking in.\\n\\nWe had the mussels and ceviche for appetizers, which we both good, but nothing crazy. Prices are on the entrees are very reasonable. I had the whole fish of the day ($26) which was a snapper prepared with a tropical fruit medley over rice. My wife had the salmon which was perfectly prepared. If you are a raw bar person you might as well get the Island Creeks, since they are the least expensive and come straight from the owner's farm.\\n\\nSince they can't serve liquor here they go out of their way to make up for it with copious beer and wine options. I had an awesome passionfruit beer from Hawaii and a really good german style beer from Jack's Abbey, one of my favorite local brewers. I was curious as to why they didn't have any Trillium on the menu when they are located right next door though? The beer is almost worth coming to this place in of itself. \\n\\nThis is one of the places in Boston that I would say is a \\"must try\\", but plan in advance or walk in at off-peak times as it is pretty hard to get a table here."},{"name":"Ruth's Chris Steak House","address":"45 School St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"ok i know a lot don't like to rate the chains too high but almost every time i go here i have a great meal, and i often go during restaurant week, service is excellent, filets are great, nothing to not like......we did not have reservations today and it was busy but we got in and everyone thoroughly enjoyed their meals.....i think is is consistently better than some of the other steak places in town,  but will have to keep trying them all."},{"name":"Raglan Road Irish Pub","address":"1640 E Buena Vista Dr","city":"Lake Buena Vista","stars":"4","text":"This restaurant is located in Disney springs.

Good but I prefer charred and grilled version better; \\nLamb chops - cooked perfectly;\\nPrawns - between this dish and lamb chops, I can't decide which one was best;\\nPaella - good but quite salty, I'm guessing because of the morcilla.. so be ready for a punch of salt;\\nBeef tartar - fantastic! The quail egg was the \\"cherry on top\\". \\n\\nOverall: Good size portions. The \\"recommendation\\" is 5 items per 2 people but no way is it doable (not if you are my size for sure), way too much food! Great service, warm atmosphere, creative bar menu, lovely patio. Valet or street parking if you get VERY lucky. \\nDefinitely a must try"},{"name":"Falafel King","address":"48 Winter St, Ste 1","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I am currently on vacation in Boston with my family and I have to admit that ever since I have discovered yelp I've been addicted to it. I can't go to any place that I haven't been without jumping on yelp to check out food. I suppose if yelp was a girl, I'd already be married.\\n\\nToday is day 2 of our 7 day mini vacation and before we made it to falafel king for dinner stuffed ourselves at Quincy's Market with fried seafood and fries. Not to mention, we went to Mike's Pastry's on Hanover street in little Italy directly after to buy some canolis which were recommended by a friend. We ended up devouring some gelato after we bought our canolis and brought them back to the hotel. Hopefully you get the picture that by the time we decided to go back into the city to get falafel king, my whole family was still full from lunch. However, after reading the reviews of falafel king before heading out around 6:00 PM, I was excited to stuff my face with even more food.\\n\\nAnyways, we took the subway to the park and had no problem finding falafel king which is located down Winter street which is an alley with shops like Gamestop and Staple's. We weren't ready to eat just yet, so we took a walk down to the end of the alley, turned around and walked into the building where falafel king was. Yes, it does smell like rotten sewer waste right outside that Chinese take-out restaurant and in other side alleys on Winter street.\\n\\nAs we arrived, we were the only ones waiting in line and the guy was nowhere to be seen. About 30 seconds later he appeared and gave us 3 falafel's dipped in hummus. We told him that we read about this place on Yelp and he was very gracious that we came to try his place out. Ended up ordering 1 falafel plate which came with 3 falafel's, rice, salad, hummus, and a piece of flatbread ($7.30) and 1 chicken kebab plate which came with about 5 generous pieces of tender, juicy, and flavorful chicken, 1 falafel, rice, salad, and hummus ($7.30). The owner wanted to give us 3 extra falafel's, but we told him no because there was no way we were going to finish those 2 meals between 3 people, so he ended up giving us 1 extra. We got on the subway and brought the food back to the hotel. The rice was extremely tasty as was the salad. The hummus and the falafel's were the highlight of the meal. The hummus was unlike any other hummus I have had and the falafel's had the perfect crunch on the outside and the right balance of spices, salt, and garlic. \\n\\nThe guy told us that they are closed on weekends because parking is atrocious in the city of Boston and they hand out $75 tickets, so they are open Monday-Friday for the business people and apparently the lines are often out the door. All in all, falafel king is truly the FALAFEL KING!!!"},{"name":"Jason's Deli","address":"4705 Ashford Dunwoody Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Jason's is a nice break from my usual fast-food diet.

I imagine most of their business is done at lunchtime.  \\n\\nWe decided on the Must-O-Khiar and the #1 and the #2 which are basically the same dish except one is served with rice and the other with flatbread.  \\n\\nThey brought out some flatbread and feta and onions before our meals.  I don't know what kind of bread it is but it reminded me a pit of pizza crust, but with sesame seeds on it and some oregano.  It was really tasty with the feta and raw onions combined.  I would come back here just to eat the bread. \\n\\nThe kababs we got were really tasty.  I've never had a ground beef kabab before, but this was really good.  Of course it reminded me of a hamburger but it was really well flavored.  The rice was ok.  I would have like it to be a little more seasoned, but it was fine how it was.  \\n\\nReading the description of Must-O-Khiar, I thought it would be like tzatziki sauce which really like, but I wasn't a huge fan of this.  I'm not sure what it is supposed to taste like but the aftertaste was somewhat reminiscent of fingerpaint.  \\n\\nOne entree was more than enough food for two people so we ended up taking the other one home.

Well, sure enough, this is the place.\\n\\nTo start, beer.. all of the beers you could ever want. Whether you are new to craft beer or you are a seasoned vet. (which we all love to think we are), The Porter will have something to please your palate. From rare casks and firkins to various vintages of bottled beers, the beer selection here is always astounding. In my humble opinion, it is the best beer bar not just in Atlanta, but in the entire region. They feature a range of brewers, from that lone Mississippi brewery to heavy weight craft beer brewers like Bell's and Dogfish Head. However, they don't stop at our countries borders. Expect many Belgian beers on tap too.\\n\\nNow, for the food. To start, this isn't your ordinary bar food. The Porter always impresses with their daily specials (appetizers, entrees, and desserts) as well as their usual menu. I can't say enough good things about the Belgian fries, hush puppies, and the burger. If you're more adventurous, try one of the many specials they have, if you're lucky, you'll catch the legendary Deathwich.. a daunting sandwich for even the bravest.\\n\\nAlso, did I mention the atmosphere here is amazing? Early brunch on Sundays is nice and calm, but the weekend nights can get a bit hectic. Try to shoot for a weekday night if you like a more calm atmosphere. If you're like me, you might settle in so much you find it hard to leave!\\n\\n\\nIn short, legendary beer bar, amazing selection for the novice to the pro, fantastic food, and a great scenery.

The ambiance. Located in the middle of a vineyard in scenic, pastoral Driftwood, it makes a great getaway from Austin for the night.  The restaurant is set up in a pair of rustic log cabin type houses. You can drink beer with the family/friends and listen to the live band play while you wait for a table. When you enter, you pass by a smorgasbord of food roasting on the open pit. Where else can you dine on the porch of a country log cabin with a sweet band playing in the background and pretend like you're a pioneer keeping it real in 1890? \\n2. It's BYOB, so you can drink at your leisure. But it's a dry county, so plan ahead.\\n3. The BBQ sauce. Seriously, the honey barbeque flavor is like nothing you've ever tasted and it kicks the meat flavor up a notch. I am thoroughly convinced that what people like about their meat is the sauce. You could throw their sauce on a cardboard box and it would taste good. \\n4. They serve all you can eat, which they call family style. If more than one person orders it, they'll bring you a big platter of meat.   \\n\\nThe not-so-good:\\n1. The food. I'm a purist when it comes to BBQ meat, and their meat is really only about a six out of ten. It's not awful by any means. But I think the sauce is covering up some flaws in their BBQ game. The brisket I've had was not good. The sausage is good, but sausage doesn't require any skill to cook. The ribs are good. The sides are seriously lacking in variety and technique. But by the time you get served, you'll be so buzzed with beer and good down home Texas vibes, you really won't care about the meat. \\n2. It's in the middle of nowhere with nothing else out there, so plan on this trip taking the whole night. \\n\\nOn the whole, it's a great experience and is a must for everyone living in Austin to try at least once."},{"name":"Hastings Racecourse","address":"188 North Renfrew Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"This place is only depressing if you make it so.

But I was surprised to have gotten a coupon emailed to me the other day with the title \\"While Some Doors Close, Others Open\\" and at the bottom of the coupon it showed 3 stores that apparently are closed. 2 of those 3 stores I frequent because of location--the Buckhead store on Peachtree and the Atlanta/Marietta store on Powers Ferry.  So I just need to know what is going on. Are they permanently closed due to business factors or was it because of the flood or what. I was just in the Buckhead store about 2 weeks ago.

I generally go for the teas (the hibiscus mint and gunpowder are amazing!), because the coffee seems a little flavorless. Great desserts and pastries, but I'd rather not pay 6 bucks for a tiny slice of cheesecake.

It was recommended to us by my father's coworker. So being Puerto Ricans we were very excited to try this place. Well first off, if you don't speak Spanish, you're a little screwed because they don't understand English very well. We went at a time where they were playing live music. It was extremely loud. The speakers sounded distorted and you couldn't even hear a thing that the person sitting next to you was saying. You literally had to yell across the table to talk to someone. Onto the service. It was plain awful. There was an hour wait and almost another hour before we got our food.We were never checked up on for drink refills or to see how we were doing or how our food was. Now onto the food. Now I'm a professional in the culinary world so I know good food. Especially good Puerto Rican food. First off it took forever for our food to come to the table. Then it was the wrong stuff and it was cold. I ordered the skirt steak medium rare. It was cold and came out medium well. Gross. My boyfriends and my dads pork chops were also cold, dry and very over cooked. My grandparents ordered the Pollo Al Ajillo. It didn't look like that at all and again their food was cold and dry. My mom orders the snapper filet which she said tasted like they just boiled the fish. In this whole time that were were eating, no one came to ask how the food was, check to see if we needed anymore water or anything. My grandma and my dad ordered sides that never came to the table and my boyfriend ordered the mixed rice and beans. He received white rice with a side of beans.\\nWe came for quality time, good conversation and good food in a nice environment to remind us of the island. What we received was horrible service, horrible food and an environment that made it difficult for us to enjoy each other's company without having to yell at one another just to talk.

The chili was totally different from our first experience - it was watery, bland, and just barely edible - totally shocking! The chicken fried steak was excellent, I'm starting to think that fried foods is the way to go here (fried chicken and fried chicken liver have been standouts).

I want something different.  Wife doesn't want to go too far from our suburban home to get a sit-down meal.\\n\\n\\"Let's try 5 Seasons North,\\" I suggest half-heartedly, worried that they'll be crowded on a Friday night.\\n\\nSurprise -- we were seated almost immediately, and while the main dining room was reasonably full at around 7:30pm, it wasn't packed with a line of people waiting for a seat in the foyer or at at the bar.  I think part of the reason is the location -- it's hard to see from it's \\"right beside an office park entrance\\" corner spot on Old Milton Parkway.  We've passed it for years after eating elsewhere and felt stupid for not thinking about it until we were fed and full.\\n\\nOur waitress was pleasant and attentive.  She kept up with requests for refills the entire meal and checked in on us regularly.  She even accommodated a slight issue with our beer order that would've otherwise put a damper on the evening.\\n\\n3rd star - Reasonably priced upscale food\\n\\nAppetizers are between $4 and $7 and appropriate portions.\\n\\nSmall / little plates are like tapas on steroids and a good value for your money between $8 and $16.\\n\\nGrilled pizzas are $14 and worth about 7-8 small slices -- plenty for leftovers.\\n\\nThe rest of the menu -- the sandwiches and entrees -- hits the $10 - $20 mark pretty well with portion and quality.\\n\\nSides are $5 and $6 -- more of an afterthought, honestly.\\n\\nI felt like everything on the menu was priced just right and even a bit of a value for what you got. One could easily spend $20 - $30 on little plates for a table of 2-4 and be totally set for dinner.\\n\\n4th star - The good food\\n\\nMy wife and I ordered appetizers, little plates, an entree and a grilled pizza on our visit.  The things we liked...\\n\\nPimento cheese br√ªl√©e ($5, appetizer) - Basically a long platter of crostini with a somewhat creamy pimento cheese spread and some greenery.  My wife loved it.  I felt it was a little too creamy for me, but I'm also not a pimento cheese fan.\\n\\nGulf shrimp and cheddar grit plate ($8 for small size; little plate) - Four grilled gulf shrimp and cheddar grits in a bowl of somewhat spicy sauce (had a Cajun kick to it).  My wife DID NOT like the spiciness, but the shrimp were medium sized, perfectly cooked, and flavorful.  The $16 size of this dish could be a meal (assuming it's doubled).  The best thing I had all night.\\n\\nGranny serrano grilled pizza ($14) - A terrific, albeit salty grilled pizza with ham, apples, and grilled onions, this was my wife's choice for dinner.  She enjoyed it but DID note the saltiness.  We ate leftovers the next day, and I can say that it was the 2nd best item we had that night.  I think it was even better reheated the next day.\\n\\nLost 5th star - The meh food\\n\\nThere were some disappointments the night we were there, but there were minor.  Specifically, my entree...\\n\\n\\"Ploughman's\\" ($12) - This is a German biergarten plate -- bratwurst, sauerkraut, chilled potato salad, and a salad with blue cheese. Honestly -- I only enjoyed the pork-based brat. Everything else was meh and didn't really work well together. It was their cheapest entree, though, so I got what I paid for.\\n\\nFree birthday cake - I shouldn't complain about this, for several reasons.  First, it was free, being it was my birthday week.  Second, we asked to have it to go since we were full anyway.  Thus, it came sans the ice cream from the menu.\\n\\nThat said, it was missing the raspberry compote, and it looked, in the to go box, liked they'd thrown it in last minute.\\n\\nRegardless of the two missed food items, I think Five Seasons North is just what I've been looking for in the 'burbs.  A restaurant with a reasonably priced menu packed with enough variety that I can visit often before I get bored.  'tis a shame I've not been here for several years before now."},{"name":"Cackalack's Hot Chicken Shack","address":"26 SE Belmont","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Picked up a leg quarter with fries this afternoon. I wasn't blown away, but it was pretty serviceable. The chicken itself was good, well cooked, not dry at all. I would agree with several of the issues that have been brought up pretty consistently in the comments. The coating is indeed on the greasy side, and there is a lot of it. Also, the leg quarter does take a long time; it's fried with the bone in, so this is to be expected, but mine took a full 30 minutes. Part of that wait was probably due to orders ahead of mine, and to be fair, the dude made it clear that there would be a wait. He also threw in an extra drumstick, which was quite good of him. I didn't find it to be the case, however, that the spice level was unusually high. Having read through the comments beforehand, I ordered the mild, expecting it to be hotter than a typical mild, and it really wasn't, not by much anyway. Maybe somewhere between mild and medium. I'm not a big spice guy, though, so that suited me just fine. I probably wouldn't be inclined to order the hot or the XXX.\\n\\nThe fries were well seasoned, but not as crisp as I generally like them. They were more of the limp shoestring variety. Again, perfectly tasty, just not the style I generally go for. The homemade ranch sauce was very good, a little more dill than you usually find in ranch, which was interesting.\\n\\nIt's difficult (and probably not all that fair) to give a rating based on just one menu item, but if pressed I'd say not the best, not the worst, overall a pretty solid three stars.

It was a good size, if not a little big for just 2 people. The only reason we stopped eating it was because we knew we had entrees coming and wanted to save room!\\n\\nI was very impressed that our meals were held until a few minutes after we ate our appetizer. A lot of restaurants will simply force the entree on you before you have a chance to digest the appetizer. Not here. They are fast with their service, but not pushy. \\n\\nMy friend got the butternut squash ravioli, a dish they've come to be known for. And with good reason. Even with a cream sauce, it was light and incredibly flavorful. I had the shrimp and scallops over linguine with Giacomo sauce, which is a red sauce with a little cream and pepper. Perfection.

Of all the places I've visited, only Chicago even comes close to having the kind of service and quality as the kind of food you get in good ol' Austin, Texas...that is, with the exception of Saba Blue Water Cafe. \\n\\nNow, in all honesty, I must confess that I've visited Saba a good ten times or so in my life and every visit consisted of quality service, tasty beverages and delicious food. But last night was the WORST restaurant experience of my entire life. \\n\\nI was meeting up with some friends for a birthday dinner after the fashion show at Hi-Lo (I was working the show because I am a photographer and blogger for Austin360's The A-list) and, despite the nasty weather, everyone was in genuinely good spirits. My friend, who was a model in the show, and myself walked into Saba to greet our large group of friends who were seated at the back of the restaurant near the kitchen. \\n\\nAnd after I leaned over and hugged one of my friends, I stood up in the aisle, and accidentally bumped my head into a rather large tray that was overly stacked with glasses and dishes. The tray unfortunately plummeted to the floor, and, as I went to help the server out, he turned and yelled, \\"I THOUGHT I TOLD YOU TO SIT DOWN!!!!\\" Since I had just walked in the door and had not been told any such thing, I was quite taken aback. As it turned out, a friend of mine--who is one of the sweetest gals you could ever hope to meet, and weighs about ninety pounds--had, in fact, been the one already told (not asked, mind you), to sit in her seat because apparently she had taken too long to greet our friends when she and her boyfriend arrived minutes before. \\n\\nAs the sweet hostess came to help out, I asked if she could direct me to the owner, as the ill-tempered server whose tray I knocked over began to argue with my friends. The hostess then told me, \\"He IS the owner.\\" I have never been so shocked in my life. The hostess apologized profusely to me and took the owner in the back to calm him down, but he instead went and got our check (before more than half of us had eaten and, in my case, even sat down) and told us that if we didn't like his attitude, we could just leave. \\n\\nMy tiny friend informed him that I worked for an online blog for a newspaper, in hopes that she could get him to apologize to me--after she had already apologized to him for taking too long to greet our friends--and he asked, \\"Which one?\\" When she said the Statesman, he said he wasn't \\"worried\\" about them. So much for bad media publicity. \\n\\nWe paid the bill, thanked the sweet hostess for apologizing for her boss, and as we left were actually apologized to by a number of other patrons who had witnessed the whole ordeal! They were sorry for us, that we had such a bad experience...now, how's that for a restaurant? A customer should never have to apologize for the OWNER of an establishment. \\n\\nNeedless to say, we will not going back to Saba ever again. And it's too bad, too, because I really enjoy the fish tank, the fried calamari, and the Saba blue iced tea...maybe the good food and a lot of business has given the owner fictional \\"rights\\" to treat his customers poorly for no reason. But it doesn't matter either way, because Manuel's on Congress accomodated our large party in a timely, friendly, wonderful manner, and at the very last second, too. Manuel's is much recommended...Saba Blue Water Cafe and the owner who likes to yell at his customers, unfortunately, are not."},{"name":"Trident Booksellers & Caf√©","address":"338 Newbury St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I had a super-huge craving for french toast, and went here during lunch to satisfy my breakfast all-day desires. \\n\\nI ordered the truck stop special: One pancake, home fries, sausage & two eggs any style with toast, for $12.95 and I asked to substitute the pancake for french toast. I said that if it cost a little extra, that was fine.\\n\\nFYI: they will make substitutions. After re-reading the menu I couldn't really understand why. An order of pancakes costs $7.50, and an order of french toast costs $8.95. I would have been happy to pay around $2.00 for the difference. However, they wanted to charge me an additional $8.95 - which seemed ridiculous. French toast with home fries, sausage, eggs, and toast does not seem worth $21.90 to me.\\n\\nWhen the waitress politely told me that she could not substitute the french toast without the $8.95 price hike, I said fine, and that I needed another minute to choose something else. Then the manager came over and asked me if there was a problem with the menu, even though she already told me their policy, and I hadn't asked to see someone. Then he not-as-politely restated that they do not offer an a la carte menu.

Giacomo's was one of those places. Let me explain.\\n\\nI ordered their famous lobster ravioli, which was served piping hot in a garlic cream sauce. Delectable! The ravioli was obviously made fresh, and the lobster meat mixture inside them was just right. My companion ordered the veal parm, which I tasted, and thought was also excellent. The side of \\"ziti\\" (which actually was penne) that accompanied his veal parm was practically inedible. It was cold, overcooked, and completely unappealing. The bowl sat lonely at the side of our table, until the perplexed waiter took it away. This seems to me to be some kind of sacrilege if one is boasting an Italian menu, particularly in the North End. Fluke? Maybe. Since the penne was not the main star of our show, we didn't put that much stock into it. Sometimes, pasta goes wrong. Thankfully, we were both pretty pleased with our entrees. The table of four next to us ordered some enormous seafood platter that included lobster tails, mussels, clams and the like, which smelled really good. \\n\\nThe service was somewhat disappointing-- two and a half stars. Our server, who had a loud, speedy, and jarring voice reminded us of a police radio dispatcher. He slid our water glasses towards us, reached over us without saying excuse me, forgot my diet coke, and kind of gave us that rushed feeling. After waiting almost an hour in the cold on a weeknight, we didn't really appreciate it.\\n\\nThe other stuff: How can I not mention the wait? A line down the block, even on weeknights. I can't even begin to imagine what this place must look like on a Saturday night. I generally don't deduct for long waits (note: I five-starred Cuchi Cuchi AND Zaftig's, both of which are notorious for their long waits), but I found both the wait and the method of handling their waiting customers less than impressive. No list, no names, no reservations. Anything goes. No protection from the cold or rain, no little morsels of sustenance for hungry waiting customers. Won't penalize for that one, just making a point. Dude. I watch Gordon Ramsey. \\n\\nThe space was really unexpectedly small. The tables are jammed so close together, that the people from the table next to us had to actually get up to let us in and out of our seats. Two and a half stars on the space, setup, and customer service. \\n\\nSo what's a girl to do? If Yelp allowed me those damn half stars, I'd feel pretty good about awarding Giacomo's three and a half stars. Fourish-star food, minus a little for all the other nonsense. After some thought though,  I'm sorry, Giacomo's, but I'm rounding down to three stars. There's just a little too much room for improvement this time around.

Just enough time to get in the chow down mood with some wine and beers. I am a big fan of the beef ribs and brisket. I skip the potato salad and too sweet for me sauce.

It's beautifully positioned at the edge of Hill Country and well kept, creating an awesome ranch vibe for us tourists. \\n\\nObviously though, you come to this place for the Legendary BBQ and I think it was well worth the 20 minute drive off the freeway--not to mention the flight from Minneapolis and drive to Austin.\\n\\nAdmittedly, I'm a Texas BBQ novice, but it's going to be really tough to beat the Brisket I experienced here. Per the recommendation of our friendly waiter, I tried some of the 'bark' pieces of the brisket and I savored every last bite. The sausage too, was just fantastic. Grilled and smoked to pure perfection so beautiful it made me realize that good BBQ is an art.\\n\\nI didn't find the pork ribs to be as amazing as the rest of the meat. I'm a huge ribs fan and was prepared for some super-tender BBQ, but ribs at the Salt Lick were drier than I would have guessed. Maybe I'm missing something and should be asking for a different part of the ribs. If that's the case send me a message. \\n\\nI was also unimpressed by the sides. I had the coleslaw and beans. Neither was that great. \\n\\nRegardless, the rest of the meat more than made up for the disappointment in the ribs and sides.\\n\\nAs far as ambiance, this place is great. I would love to get a group of friends together and spend the evening out here, and hopefully I can live in Texas someday to make that happen. Being within driving distance of this place would be a hell of an amenity.\\n\\nThe hospitality by the manager (I think his name was Lee) was also much appreciated. He saw my wife and I taking pictures of the pit, and he offered to take our photos. To help make it more memorable for us he had the chef fork a slab of ribs and let us hold it in our photo. Yes it was touristy and a half but it's a great photo!\\n\\nI'd love to hear from true Texas BBQ folks that have recommendations for us to check out next time (hopefully soon)!"},{"name":"Sake Japanese Restaurant","address":"910 Washington St","city":"Braintree","stars":"4","text":"Had an amazing sushi experience here.

I really liked the decor especially the tall ceilings. The atmosphere was great to catch up with friends. Our waiter was wonderful. He helped suggest a beer to my boyfriend after the one he wanted was no longer available. He also helped us pick out a bottle of white wine since no one was familiar with any of the extensive list they had. We started with two dozen oysters to share. Every single one was fresh and delicious. The accompaniments were not our favorite as they all had champagne in them and were somewhat bubbly. For dinner I had fish and chips.

Mike's isn't my thing.  The shell can be soggy, depending on how long it sat there, but more importantly to me, the filling is too thick and sweet.  Its consistency is almost like frosting, and the powdered sugar overpowers the ricotta.  Not so at Maria's.  It's filled to order, and it's runnier, less sugar, more cheese, which makes it more decadent and richer, yet at the same time, so much easier to eat.  It's quite literally difficult to finish a pastry that is too sweet, but I can eat dairy fat all day.\\n\\nI would say Modern's is closer, but the last time I had one there it was a little too sweet.  Hands down though, Maria's ricotta pie is better.  The filling is softer and creamier, while the pastry is moister, and richer.  Modern's almost eats like a cookie with filling that has bite, which you would not expect from ricotta/marscapone filling.\\n\\nI've also tried a chocolate spice cookie that I cannot remember the name of and that was great.\\n\\nI'm not a big fan of the doughy marzipan in bakeries, I generally prefer the more delicate kind in chocolate shops, so I don't have much to say about their marzipan.

Mike and I went here to celebrate our one year anniversary--because isn't one is supposed to go to a fancy Italian place in the North End to celebrate something so cheesy?\\nI got the fusilli with vegetables and goat cheese and Mike got something or other with sausage that he loved. My pasta was delicious as well. We got a bottle of chianti that was great, although I don't remember the label. THEN, for dessert, we got tiramisu that was huge and out-of-this-world delicious. Tiramisu is my favorite dessert. I would fight people for it. I want it to be my wedding cake and I don't even want to get married. This tiramisu lived up to all my wildest expectations. The espresso we got as an accompaniment was also high-quality and the sambuca was a licorice punch in the face, as it should be. The whole thing was only about $100--not bad for a fancy dinner.\\nThe restaurant is very romantic and dimly lit. It is small, like everywhere else in the North End pretty much, but that doesn't bother me. \\nWe sat at a little table for two by the window, which was very nice, except for the fact that it was February and sometimes a gust of wind would hit us when someone entered the restaurant.

My fiance's birthday and Mother's Day fell on the same day, so I made reservations well in advance of our arrival, and also asked for as private a table as possible. To my pleasant surprise, despite how busy they were, they remembered my special request, and gave us the most perfect little table in the window for our meal. \\n\\nOnce seated, the waiter appeared quickly with water, and ready to take our drink orders. Maybe I was blind, but I didn't see wines by the glass, but since it was a special occasion, we just ordered a bottle. The bread at the table was very good, and the garlic-infused olive oil (with whole olives) was delightful. \\n\\nWe ordered 2 appetizers, not realizing just how large they would be: the focaccino con caprino--a mixed salad with the most delectable thin pizza slices and goat cheese--as well as the calamari. As I said, both were quite plentiful dishes, and could have been meals in and of themselves. Regardless, they were \\"appetizers\\" in every sense of the word, because we looked forward to the main course despite approaching \\"full\\"! \\n\\nMy main dish was the fusilli pasta with goat cheese and vegtables, which was awesome, and my fiance had a special, chicken parm. Both were extremely good, and were very generously sized. What I loved about this place was its authenticity--there are no fancy little plates here with perfect little arrangements on the plate; the art is in the integrity of the food that you bite into, not how it looks on the plate. \\n\\nWe were so pleased with our experience at Antico Forno--food was great, service was great, and it had a warm, inviting atmosphere, so I just have to give it all 5 stars.

The fries were decent and the mozzarella sticks were good. They serve Coke products, which I prefer over Pepsi. The waitress was on point with drink refills and our check. I read the other reviews about a recent location change. I have to agree the location could be better. A sign on the east side of the building parking lot might attract more business.

We also ordered some sushi pieces such as spicy tuna and salmon and I could taste it was not as fresh as it should be. Another pet peeve I noticed was that our BBQ grille was electric heat based, rather than the gas fire that I was accustomed to, so I think that was a big no-no! Because it defeated the whole purpose/concept of BBQing. For those BBQ connoisseurs, there is a HUGH difference  using flame fire/heat to cook/char your meat as compared to just some fake electric heat. Just based on that, I wouldn't come back here for Korean BBQ. I mean it's such a big mistake to do that, or it's like cooking without salt or using corn oil rather than extra/virgin olive oil, the food Gods are not impressed!!\\n\\nThe only good thing I could say was that our waiter was pretty attentive and did a good job of bring out the food on time, etc.....Other than that, this place had really gone down in quality.

When I booked the reservation, I had no idea it was kind of outside the city center but...Uber to the rescue!  We were a bit early so we ended up getting a beer while waiting.  They have these cool shelve-type things on posts so that you can stand and have your beer if you can't get a spot at the bar. (Although I wouldn't be surprised if the bar is reserved for eating patrons.)\\n\\nI'm afraid I made things harder than they should have been for our server.  We wanted to get separate checks but I guess when she rings things up as two separate, they get plated separately and our small table can't handle it.  Anyway, she was a soldier and split things up for us and did an A+ job at the end when we got our checks.  She was very sweet, accommodating and helpful, even giving us tips on where to for after dinner drinks.\\n\\nNow to the food:  Really tasty!  (For the most part.)\\nTo start, we ordered a dozen oysters (Aunt Dotty's, Summersides and Island Creek), smoked salmon (kind of a chintzy portion for the price), trout pate and the uni toast.  Oysters were super fresh and delicious.  The other three items were flawless as well.  The trout pate turned out to be comfort food.  I almost wanted to put it in a sandwich (a la a tuna sandwich) with all the accompanying pickles.  The uni toast was oceany and well flavored. (2 pieces per order).\\n\\nFor our mains, hubby went with the fish of the day, a whole branzino topped with couscous.  I went with the bucatini because the one past I wanted (it was Pasta Sunday) was done.  And just for shits and giggles, we ordered their highly lauded lobster roll.  Our dining companions also both got lobster rolls.  For sides, we got the cornbread (best version I've ever had) and the corn (hubby loved this more than I did but it was still good.)\\n\\nThe lobster roll was truly the paradigm of its kind.  The meat used was perfectly cooked and plentiful.  I was less thrilled with our other entrees.  The bucatini was ok - a little on the greasy side and pasta not al dente.  Hubby's fish was perfectly cooked and super fresh but there didn't seem to be enough seasoning/flavor  Also, for what it's worth, you're on your own on eating the fish off the bones.  Some places debone it for you tableside or whatever but here, you're caveman-ing it.\\n\\nFinally, the cornbread.  This was an afterthought...we saw on Yelp and though we already had a bunch of food, we felt like we had to get it.  And man...we are glad we did.  It was soooo good.\\n\\nWe decided to save some calories for after-dinner drinks so we all four shared one butterscotch pudding.

Maybe I should've. The hibachi wasn't terrible, but it wasn't memorable either. I could probably whip up something incredibly similar at home, and therefore it wasn't as enjoyable.\\n\\nThe second experience was a little better. I had the toro, which was sliced perfectly and delicious, as well a couple other rolls. I also nibbled off other plates, and what I tasted was delicious. The other people had gone in on two pots of hot oil that you cook all the ingredients in (sort of like Asian fondue). It was the Sukiyaki and Shabu-Shabu. It's expensive at $40 a pot, but easily split between 3 people per pot. The pot dishes were flavorful and I'd highly recommend getting those over the hibachi any day if you're not planning on sushi for the night.\\n\\nSo good sushi, good traditional dishes cooked table side, not so great hibachi dinners. At least the service was always prompt and friendly, which definitely helps pick up the slack of the hibachi meals.\\n\\nMy only other gripe is that the self-parking is hidden away off Piedmont Road, not  Cheshire Bridge. If you come up to the front, you'll have to valet, and while it's complimentary, it feels a little rude to not give anything. Since I rarely carry cash, finding that hidden parking was a godsend!

I recommend the Patch Block Pinot Noir or the Vin de Pays d'Oc Languedoc. They are also a retail wine store, so if you find wine that you absolutely love you can take a bottle home with you.

After eating I can say I would wait longer if I had to. \\nDespite being packed we had quick service. We had five people in our party, to include my almost 70 year old father-in-law and 6 year old kid, and our server was on the ball with answering questions, making recommendations, and getting our orders. \\nBecause of the volume, the kitchen staff may take an extra minute or two to get bigger or more complicated orders; but don't worry, the food is fantastic. Everyone ate a different meal and each one of us loved it. \\nThe only downside (and please don't take my 4 stars the wrong way because it's a 5 for the food and atmosphere); is space. Parking, like everywhere in the ATL, is lacking. There isn't much for a waiting area, so hopefully it isn't too hot outside if you have to wait, and to get more tables in, the walk ways are narrow and you may be seated pretty close to the next table. \\nOverall, this place is one of the best breakfast places downtown.

For $1.50 more they'll deep fry green beans or brussels sprouts; I wish they were steamed, but that's probably too labor intensive.  And you get your choice of three dipping sauces:  the chive and garlic tasted like butter (not necessarily a bad thing), I was much more partial to the blue cheese.  I don't remember the third option.\\n\\nThe Wild Boar slider satisfied my snack craving.  If you've never had boar it's not gamey, just leaner than beef.

Famous for their massive fire pit, they've been featured on numerous television food shows and Instagrammed probably thousands of times. They've grown into a larger venue and have become a huge tourist attraction to visitors of the Austin area. \\n\\nIt's a nice somewhat scenic, green, hilly, half hour drive from downtown Austin. When you arrive you enter a dirt parking lot. So just be aware if you are don't like driving your car on this type of surface. Saturday evening was a fairly busy time though our wait time was only about 10 minutes when they told us it would be longer. They give you a buzzer when you check in then you can buy an ice cold lemonade from their lemonade stand or go get your own drinks next door in their beverage store while you wait to enter the dining area. It's BYOB so some families bring coolers full of drinks and really make a whole event out their visit which I feel is probably the best way to enjoy your time here. They have picnic tables set up outside with lots of shade from the trees for you to sit and chill. \\n\\nOnce inside you pass the infamous massive fire pit on the right. After your photo op they seat you in the dining area full of indoor picnic tables. You can tell this place has been around a while as the furniture and decor look aged, worn and dusty. The table and menus even had a mild sticky film from layers of years of barbecue sauce. The lighting was somewhat dim like a dark old cabin. There was no air conditioning but the fans were blowing so it warm not hot. \\n\\nOur server was great, greeted us with a smile and was attentive. I wasn't used to having table service at a barbecue joint because all of the BBQ joints I've been to are all counter service. \\n\\nNow for the food. My wife and I shared the the Rancher which is a combo of smoked turkey, sausage, ribs and brisket. You have to ask for moist brisket otherwise the default is a lean cut. The sauce was a sweet mustardy yellow BBQ sauce which I felt went very well with all the meats.  The sides were a potato salad that was ever so slightly acidic, and a cole slaw without mayonnaise. I enjoyed both probably more than the main dish. The beans were plain average. You also get a side of bread, pickles and a pickle jalapeno. Be ready for it cuz it's spicy! \\n\\nOverall there was nothing really spectacular about this place that would make me want to come back for the food. I would come back to bring out of towners for a nice Texas BBQ experience. But if taste is King I'd check elsewhere.

Oh do you need more info to make the best choice possible?... \\nThis institution of foodness (Foodness= Fresh Food + Yummy Goodness) has an extensive menu and my goal is to try everything at least once. \\nWhat's hard about that, is that everything has been amazing and its hard to move on instead of trying it over and over again. I love their Fish Tacos. They have 6 original Fish Tacos which can be prepared with blackened, grilled, or crispy fish, or with shrimp that can also be blackened, grilled, or crispy, or any of their other 10 Turf Tacos can also be adapted to fish as well. \\nWhat's my personal favorite? The Baja Fish Taco which is true perfection, the Luau Chicken Taco where I want to just slurp the Creamy Teriyaki Sauce with a Straw, the Steak JimiChurri with perfectly cooked steak and incredible chimichurri sauce, and the Pipeline Pork with their Citrus Pulled Pork. \\nBut let me add the disclaimer now... regular hungry? just get one! Famished? Get two. Or if you are eating like a WWE Superstar go for the gusto and get three. Don't let these la carte prices fool you, these tacos are huge and filling. \\nSecond recommendation: instead of getting two tacos just add a side or appetizer like the Jimmy Crack'd Corn which is eye-rolling, yummy-noises-that-should-only-be-heard-in-the-privacy-of-a-bedroom good. Don't believe me, try it and then when you have a When Harry met Sally moment in the middle of the restaurant or office breakroom then here is my \\"I told you so\\". \\nLast few tips: \\n- Their salsa is actually more like a picadijio and costs extra. I suggest instead that you think of the extra tortilla chips that come with your tacos as extra crisps to sop up the sauce that comes with your taco. \\n- End your meal out right and order the Island Crisps Dessert and be prepared to share 'cus it's huge. \\n- If you get any burger to-go, make sure to have them put the sauce on the side or else you'll be eating it with a knife and fork. Still yummy but not finger friendly. \\n- The Voodoo sauce is spicy but its not a kill-your-taste-buds so would recommend in moderation.\\n- The Lava Sauce is fantastic and can go on everything\\n- Sweet Potato Fries are awesome and so are the Zucchini Fries (which are tempura fried).\\n- Also have to give props to the servers, I call for take out and then run out the door because by the time I get there (less than 10min) everything is ready, packaged, and nothing is missing or not what I ordered.

We were promptly shown to a nice seat (a long wooden picnic table) in a corner by the window and greeted by our friendly waitress who informed me that they DID in fact have sweet tea so we were already off to an amazing start. \\n\\nMy friend and I both ordered the pulled pork BBQ sandwich platter which came with cole slaw, beans, and potato salad.  It was out in about 5 minutes and we were chowing down.  The sandwich was on this large yummy seasame seed bun which was fresh and delicious with tons of carbs and bread loaded with a huge portion of slow cooked (on their fabulous open grill) pulled pork.  I mean this pulled pork was unlike anything I have ever had - and I have had A LOT of BBQ folks - it was literally melt in your mouth good, you barely had to chew it.  In fact, your toothless 100 year old granny could gum it and swallow and be fine, seriously.  \\n\\nThe beans and cole slaw were very good and the potato salad was made differently then what I am used to in Virginia so I wasn't crazy about it.  It was an interesting flavor, it was less mustard and more thick and paste-like, like mashed potatoes and it was cold.  Meh, I could've done without that.  \\n\\nMy friend also ordered the blueberry cobbler with a scoop of vanilla ice cream on it.  I was pretty full by this point but she saved room so they brought two spoons when they brought it out. \\n\\nOHMIERGERRRDDDDD.  It was soooooooo freaking good I wish I could eat that stuff every morning for breakfast and again at night before bed.  It's probably a good thing I can only get this when I go to Austin or Texas once a year now or I would be out of control with it.  It was fresh and delicious.  It was sweet but also had the bread to soften the sweetness, the ice cream was amazing with it, it was warm but not hot and burned your mouth.  It had a ton of blueberries but it was still amazing.  I can't tell you enough how much you need to eat this in your life in order to be fulfilled. \\n\\nThe ambience of the place is cute too.  The parking lot looks like a farm where it has the rows separated by what looked to me like planting sticks to keep plants growing straight and tall.  It's gravel and HUGE.  There is tons of parking - there are a ton of outdoor tables in a nice outdoor area where it looks like they often have live music and there are two huge dining areas inside all with windows all around.

We told her we understood and offered to split our party into two parties so we could be seated inside.  She told us that was not possible (in a very unfriendly manner). It was 90 degrees outside and we had a pregnant women in our party.  We understood and thought that maybe they had lunch reservations for the other, unoccupied tables.  We at outside next to the road.  For the most part our food was good.  I am a vegetarian though and they had very little on the menu for me to eat.  I had to get a salad and have olive oil and vinegar on it because even the dressing had anchovies in it.  It was ok, basically a house salad.  Our server (a girl with yellow hair) was really nice and almost everyone else liked their food (except for one other person).  My husband had the lobster roll and said it was very good.  The worst part of the meal was when we went inside and saw that half tables were still unoccupied.
