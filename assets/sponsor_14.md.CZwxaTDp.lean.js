The music effortlessly complements the style of the place and is at a decent volume to hold a conversation with your group while you enjoy a lovely meal.\\n\\nWhich brings me to the only cautionary word of advice: the place is small including the kitchen. Keep that in mind when considering what you want your evening to look like. One would think it's common sense to pick a bigger chain restaurant or fast food if you're in a hurry on a weekend evening or at least ask the staff about wait times before hand if the place is packed. It's not a sexy trait to have when you're needlessly rude to restaurant workers.

I stopped by around 5pm on a Friday and had no trouble getting a table. The inside is basically just like Kasa was, but with some new pops of color. Here's the skinny on the experience:\\n\\nGood:\\n- The service. Very friendly and attentive.\\n- The drinks. The red sangria was tasty and my friends cocktail was also good.\\n\\nMeh:\\n- The food. \\nWe started with the guac/chips and when it came out I immediately wondered where the avocado was. It was basically pico de gallo with a little avocado. Not what I was expecting. Not bad, but I wouldn't call it \\"guacamole\\".  The chips were also a bummer.. no real flavor, just nothing to love about them. I hate to say it but Trader Joe's has better tasting chips.\\n\\nNow my review of Tacos is solely based on the vegetarian options. Maybe the meat options are flavorful, but these were pretty bland. We had the fried cheese/blackberry, pinto bean & avocado, and kale & potato. We agreed that they were \\"ok\\", but definitely not something that would bring us back. \\n\\nWe ended with the choco tacos dessert. Again, it was just ok, but we didn't even finish it, and I never leave dessert behind.\\n\\nDon't take my word for it, especially if the meat options entice you, check it out for yourself.

When we came in, they gave us forks vs chop sticks. I point this out because this is usually a sign to me that the restaurant is trying to cater/condescend to the American palate and the food isn't going to be very good. In this case, this was totally what happened. \\n\\nPea Vines with garlic: Here they call them snow pea leaves whereas I have always heard of them as pea vines, either way, these were the best part of the meal. They were as we expected they would be and were quite happy with them.\\n\\nPan Fried Salted Squid: I have always seen this called salt and pepper squid but again, they seem to name things a bit differently here. What I find odd, is that when I ordered it the waiter himself called it Salt and Pepper squid, seems he realizes their menu uses unusual names. This dish was not bad, but it was certainly not as we expected it. The squid was adequately cooked but it lacked flavor. Usually this dish is spicy, this one wasn't spicy at all, the main overriding flavor was actually sweetness, which while often a component of the flavor is not the front note of this dish in my experience. It lacked all the flavors we have come to expect from this dish and was a bland \\"Chinese\\" version of italian calamari. I wouldn't order this again.\\n\\nTender Chicken and Salted Fish Fried Rice: Horrible. I love Salted fish and chicken fried rice. It's my absolute favorite fried rice in the world. This was the worst version I have ever had. This dish is supposed to be pungent, and I mean stink up the restaurant pungent. Not as bad as stinky tofu, but close. This version had no smell at all and for that matter no flavor. Furthermore, they deep fried the chicken pieces and the salted fish pieces making the salted fish taste almost bland. They then used carrots and peas... I have never had it like that, it's usually stir fried with some lettuce. Overall it seems as if they took this amazing, flavorful dish and dumbed it down for the \\"American/White\\" palate. In doing so, they made it just boring fried rice. I wouldn't order this again."},{"name":"Kobe Japanese Steakhouse - Orlando","address":"5605 S Kirkman Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"We came in tonight for a friend's birthday dinner.

The texture is very different than your typical salmon, yellowtail, or tuna cuts. It's melts in your mouth like a paste and has a very mild taste (not too too fishy).\\n\\nSake Toro Nigiri -- The fattiest cut of salmon served atop a finger of rice with a squirt of wasabi. Simple. Excellent.\\n\\nPortions are very generous and I have a tough time getting the whole nigiri into my mouth in one bite (like you're supposed to). But no complaints here! Just more to enjoy! The Itamae pride themselves on presentation, and the rolls and nigiri come to your table beautifully garnished.\\n\\nThe waitresses have been attentive and genuinely friendly. We usually order two rounds and they were eager to suggest other rolls and nigiri we might enjoy based upon our first round. One waitress encouraged us to try the monkfish liver, and I'm so glad she did! I would never have chosen it on my own.\\n\\nThe setting is very intimate. Lighting and decor is just right for a romantic dinner, but a larger gathering of friends would have a good time as well.

Our reservation was for 8:15--we were seated at 9:30. Why even have reservations? The hostess seemed to care less if we sat there and rotted to death at the bar. The only shining light was that our bartender offered us an appetizer after we'd been sitting for 45 minutes, but not a word from the hostess. Very unprofessional. I and one other member of my party ordered the shrimp and crab pasta--both of our dishes were served lukewarm. I liked the flavor of the dish, but the other person thought it tasted like Chefboyardee. It was a tiny portion. Another person ordered the pork chop, which was a generous portion and had good flavor. If you're hungry, get the chop. The custom cocktails were very good, however when I ordered a glass of red wine, it was served with red wine caked in the stem and pedestal of the glass. Unsightly and again, very unprofessional. The glass sat there and made a big red stain on the table--I would have asked for a paper cocktail napkin to wipe it up, but our server seemed to disappear. By the time he re-appeared, the damage was already done.

All in all - this place is top notch food wise. I would describe the approach to the food, however, as \\"backyard chic\\" - which some die-hards might struggle with, but I liked. What I mean by this is that there is a modern cuisine approach to the portion sizes and plating (the d√©cor and environment is very laid back and casual with a good energy). My issues with Sweet Cheeks (which is why I went 4 stars, not 5 and even flirted with giving three) was the pricing to portion size. We were challenged trying to figure out how much food to order and as a result, we wound up WAY over ordering, largely because our waitress misguided us. She was \\"selling\\" too hard. For instance, she said the smoked turkey leg (which was great) was ideally suited for one person, when in fact two legs came on a place and it was very easy to share. Either better pricing or a slightly different configuration on the old-school Chinese restaurant style menu (two from section A, three from section B) I think would go a LONG way as the food here is really top notch.

They included a thin slice of roasted pork in the bowl as well; very nice.  The noodles, though not house-made, were tasty with a nice toothy bite. The broth was delicious. Drop in the pureed garlic and sesame seeds garnish into the broth, mix up and enjoy. \\n\\nI'll definitely be going back, and though I would love to try their other soups (soy broth based), I'm going to have a hard time NOT ordering the Kakuni Ramen everytime. \\n\\nSo that you understand which Portland restaurants I'm comparing to, I've tried Wafu, Biwa, Mirakutei and Miho. If there is Kakuni ramen out there in Portland better than Yuzu, please let me know."},{"name":"Fujiya Japanese Foods","address":"912 Clark Drive","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"It's out of the way for me but a one-stop shop for preparing for a sushi hand roll party! \\n\\nThe fish is relatively inexpensive and you can grab some containers of Japanese deli items as sides for your sushi.

SO GOOD. I was having the poached eggs and proscuitto and was pleasantly surprised to see how much proscuitto was on this batch.) our son just had a meltdown and refused to eat his scrambled eggs or be consoled.  My husband whisked the baby away to his car seat and I boxed up the food in order that our meal might be the only one ruined and I was out the door when the manager chased me down.\\n\\nShe told me she was sorry our meal had been interrupted and from experience knew how frustrating it was when your kid makes a planned meal go to hell and gave us coupons for two free meals--or as she said, to come back and have a date on our own.  Now, she may have just been feeling particularly empathetic, or grateful we chose to leave and not disrupt a busy Sunday brunch, but either way we were really grateful and when I told my husband I think it really relieved his frustration of breakfast being ruined.\\n\\nAnd this isn't even the first time this has happened! Everytime I have gone to Northstar they head off any potential problems--their credit card machine is taking a while? They told me just to take a seat and not worry about it, on the house.  A piece of my pizza fell on the floor between the kitchen and my table?  They already have another pizza in the oven AND gave me a coupon for a free meal.  They think I've been waiting too long? Apologies? I forget that I'm supposed to not be eating corn and order tortilla chips? They replace them.  I realize the rice salad ALSO has corn in it?

Dance clubs are fine for shouting at your friends; coffeeshops, not so much. \\n- The parking situation, especially when there's a game at the stadium across the street, is pretty dismal. \\n- They stopped carrying cake in favor of 'cake-in-a-jar' and only-OK cupcakes (more style than substance). Their cake and pie used to be SO GOOD and now the desserts all feel overpriced and hipster-trendy. I usually get a disappointing cupcake, but I don't look forward to dessert there like I used to. \\n\\nNow, the highlights! \\n\\n- I really like their Gouda bacon cheeseburger. Thick bacon, not too greasy, warmed/toasted bun. A total winner. \\n- The crawfish avocado salad is delicious. \\n- They have a good variety of pretty tasty coffee and make solidly tasty coffee drinks. \\n- If you have a large group with varied tastes (we have carnivores, omnivores, vegetarians, beer lovers, people who don't drink, and families with kids), they have a good range of options. \\n- The back porch area is great for groups, when they aren't having live music. You can be loud and hop tables without worrying that you're disturbing the other diners. \\n- Their staff is generally friendly, cheerful, and helpful. They remember regular customers and if you go say \\"Hey, the music is REALLY LOUD back there!\\" they'll turn it down (this was not always the case, but now it is). \\n\\nOverall, it's a good place to go for a cup of coffee and a burger or a salad, but they should scale back to one trendy dessert and replace either the cupcakes or the cake-in-a-jar with actual cake."},{"name":"Bagel 13","address":"6725 N Cocoa Blvd","city":"Port St. John","stars":"4","text":"New place here in Port Saint John and very much appreciated!

A great spin on a traditional dish, similar to battered zucchini flower, with a light  and tasty batter.\\n\\nThe smoked king salmon was a 24 hour cold smoke of a fish just spawning, and fattier.  The light flavor worked well with the beets, though the flavor also was a bit timid, mild. \\n\\nUnfortunately, from here we were let down.  The halibut with ceci beans was also very timid, without the pop or punch you would hope from the greens and fish mingling.  Again, the sauce was hiding somewhere in the dish and the salsiccia was foamy, lumpy and flavorless.  Our pork and beans on the side were similarly bland and dry to our taste.  And the biggest disappointment was our pasta selection.  It's not on the prior menus, so I can't recall exactly what it was!  (that is telling)  Porcini mushrooms with fusili I believe.  Bland!  I had to hunt for the mushroom flavor.  \\n\\nThey had run out of the rhubarb desert unfortunately.  The wine service is principally Italian and approachable. \\n\\nAll in all, it's still just opening.  The other dishes looked good on paper and I'm sure like many places they will hit their stride.  Their choice of cocktail purveyor will help.  However, here is my biggest gripe:  Just a few days ago, we heard the sad news that Anthony Cafiero was closing Racion.  His interview stated \\"for every Renata that opens, a Racion must close\\".   Racion was one of the most inventive, exciting and tasteful restaurants in PDX.  It was a delight, and from the beginning we were wary that it might not survive just because it isn't what typically succeeds in Portland.   That it must close metaphorically because PDX would rather have another Italian joint, another wood fired Pizza, another shot for the middle of the road is a sign of our lack of true culinary adventure in a town overloaded with exciting comfort food."},{"name":"Agave Azul Cocina Mexicana","address":"5248 Red Bug Lake Rd","city":"Winter Springs","stars":"4","text":"Over priced, rude staff and underwhelming Mexican.

When you arrive you order up front cafeteria style, serve your own coffee, and set your own table (fun and convenient!) The kitchen area is open concept so you can see and interact with the cooks while they make your food. Coming home has a real \\"Cheers\\" vibe. It's clearly a community hub as the servers seem to greet many customers with familiarity. The food is delicious and customizable and comes quickly without fuss. For me, the greatest thing about this spot is that in spite of how small their space is they go out of their way to make children welcome. They provide buckets of beautiful toys and seem genuinely cheerful about having little ones around. It's just an all around great atmosphere and my favourite breakfast in New West.

The chips were fresh and tasty, the salsa was good and the other ranch dressing/cayenne pepper concoction was, well, totally a takeaway.   Disappointingly, the food was bland, across the board.  Also, the rice on all four entrees was tepid.  We agreed that the best part of the entrees were the refried beans but, they too, were barely warm.  The flan was tasty, the fried ice cream was a nice portion and had corn flakes as the shell and the Mexican doughnuts were so-so.  The three dipping sauces were very watery and ho-hum.  Because this is a chain, I can only blame corporate recipes for the tasteless food but the restaurant is accountable for serving room temperature dishes.  Three out of the four of us would not return.  To their credit, the outside seating was full and people seemed to be enjoying themselves.

The menu was rather limited, but the food was spectacular nonetheless. Well, at least the tostada was, the fries were also very good, but just short of spectacular.\\n\\nI'll start with the fries, these were just shy of perfect. They were of a perfect size, perfectly seasoned with a wonderful spicy spice, and the saltiness came from the absolutely amazing sauce on top. They also came with micro cilantro, which was wonderful!\\n\\nI have two small critiques about the potatoes. The first is that they could have used a couple more seconds in the fryer. While they were cooked really well, the additional seconds would have added that wonderful, coveted, tiny little crispy shell. The additional critique I have is that I would have liked just a tiny bit more sauce. Because it was the element that added salt, once it ran out, the fries needed a little salt element. \\n\\nIf these two have been met, then the fries would need either ketchup nor salt nor pepper. \\n\\nAt this point, I would like to mention that I was debating whether or not this should cost the Munch Mobile Kitchen a star, but I decided it shouldn't. These critiques are very small, and with a massive line of hungry students, I am not going to deduct a star. \\n\\nNow, the part you've all been waiting for, the braised pork tostada. This was absolutely wonderful, everything came together beautifully. One of the things I look for in food is for balanced flavors, another is proportions. \\n\\nIn terms of flavors, there was crunch and freshness from the radicchio, sweetness from the marinade, spice from the crema, as well as from the seasoning in the marinade. They also didn't overdo it on the cheese, which is quite important.\\n\\nAdditionally, with so many flavors working together, it is very easy for something to get overwhelmed. With this dish, this was not the case, nothing got overwhelmed. \\n\\nMy only note is that there could have been a little less pork. While having extra protein is quite great, the veggies ran out, and there was still some pork left. It changed the flavor profile, obviously, but extra protein is not a reason to complain. As such, please don't take this as a complaint, but as a note.\\n\\nAlthough, the tostada at the very bottom, which was able to retain its crunch, was perfect for finishing the left over pork. The tostada itself was quite good too, I have no critique against it. \\n\\nVery friendly service, especially with a large crowd of students who aren't all exceedingly polite."},{"name":"Cambridge Brewing Company","address":"1 Kendall Sq, Bldg 100","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"This place gets 4-stars for the bar/beer and 2-stars for the restaurant.\\n\\nThe good first.  The beer is really, really good, and the bartenders are very knowledgeable about helping you find one that you like.  What's the word for a beer-sommelier?  That's what they are.  On the downside, the bar can be deafeningly loud (some people like that, I don't), and the servers have the same arrogance that comes with being a beer-sommelier.\\n\\nThe bad.  The food service is unexcusably awful.  The waiters are rude, forget requests, there aren't enough of them when things are busy.  I don't want to be fussed over (in fact, I hate that), I just want my waiters to be professionals.  They aren't.  To top it off, they commit the odius, unforgivable practice of putting a \\"suggested gratuity\\" at the bottom of your bill, at the amounts of 18 and 20%.  Sorry, but a tip means a tip - I get to decide, not you.  Putting that at the bottom, especially after receiving terrible service, feels really insulting.\\n\\nThe food...is ok.  I would definitely get a burger again.  At 11-bucks-ish, they are reasonably priced for what they are.  The other food attempts to be gourmet, but it just isn't.  It's bland, nothing-special food that I would not have a problem paying $8-9 for at a cheap cafe, but not $17 for (hello, risotto!).\\n\\nSo, in summary, I will definitely be back here for the beer, repeatedly, especially if I can sit outside during the summer.

After the hostess sat us, 10-15 minutes went by with not a single person greeting us or letting us know someone would be with us shortly. We saw 3 other waiters who seemed to be not so busy and the hostess who was standing at the front. With that being said, we decided to leave since we didn't have time to wait around due to the flight my friends had to catch. Please note, I've been to Stephanie's dozens of times, I have a server life threatening food allergy and Stephanie's has always been amazing. I don't trust any restaurants but I trusted Stephanie's. When my friends and I were leaving, I went to let the hostess know that we were actually headed out and out menus are on the table. She looked at me and just said \\"okay\\" in a very rude way. I have never complained, never said anything to anyone before, but feeling comfortable at Stephaine's, I thought maybe I'd let the hostess know why. I told her, \\"I just want you to know, we sat there for over 10 minutes without anyone saying anything to us. In the future if you could let someone know we have been waiting that would be appreciated.\\" Never have I ever seen someone react this way, let alone an employee of a nice restaurant in Boston.... this hostess LOST IT. Anyone else would have said, \\"thank you for letting me know, have a nice day!\\" She started attacking me with her words, screaming at me, swearing at me, TWO of the employees literally had to HOLD BACK this hostess because she was so out of control. My mind was blown that this is the way she was acting and treating me. Like I've said before, I never ever complain and truly felt like Stephanie's would be a safe place to give a nice little suggestion to. I went to school for hospitality. The customer is ALWAYS right no matter what. Even if I was in the wrong, the hostess should have agreed with whatever I was saying. Not only did the hostess make me feel incredibly embarrassed for screaming at the top of her lungs at me, I truly felt threatened for my wellbeing as she was leaning over the hostess stand to literally get in my face. My friend and I walked away very quickly, feeling as if she would actually physically attack me. I am the most understanding person. I truly feel horrible for this hostess's and for Stephanie's on a Newbury because they now have that reputation. Everyone who was sitting outside on the patio saw what happened and I am sure were just as mind blown as I was by the way a Stephanie's on Newbury employee was acting towards a customer. I truly am disappointed in Stephanie's for hiring someone who has such a short temper. I understand people have bad days or wanting to give people a chance but this was incredibly uncalled for. I walked away shaking because I was so freaked out. My friend called the restaurant to inform the manager, who said they will address the situation and said goodbye. I hope this is a lesson learned by Stephanie's and truly do hope they actually did something about this insane situation. With that being said, I will not be going back to the restaurant because I am scared of seeing this hostess again. No customer should ever feel that way. Stephanie's is truly a wonderful restaurant with amazing food and overall awesome employees but this crosses the line completely."},{"name":"Musashino Sushi Dokoro","address":"2905 San Gabriel St, Ste 200","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"My friend and I simply weren't impressed.\\n\\nFirst of all, it is hard to find.

My first was last week before the official opening.  Meet some friends there they recomended the place.  The entertainment that evening was a Band EEZ Featuring Andrew Luv, They were Great.  Good vocals and they mixed things up by playing a little bit of everything.  A little ole school dance music, some jazz and some pop tunes.  The service was a little scattered.  I ordered the Crab Cakes.  They were very good but the sauce that they put on top of them was cold and that made the Crab Cakes cold, but they were good none the less.  I then viewed the drink menu and to my surprise they were charging an average of $9 to $10 dollars per glass and not a good pour at that.  You would think we were on Park Avenue or something instead of the strip mall that we were in.  The decor was nice but I think that the chairs that they have there are too big for the space.  Every time someone went to the bathroom I had to move my chair so they could get by.  Over all it was a somewhat pleasant evening.  My second visit was after the concert in Casselberry where the Band EEZ opened.  They invited everyone down to JT after the concert.  I believe the space is too small for what they trying to do.  They only have 11 tables and if you don't get there early you have to wait outside for a table to become available.  After getting in after a little wait, we had a party of 7 or 8.  The waitress comes to our table and takes everyones orders.  The food starts to arrive and no one at our table has and flatware and everyone observes that the food coming out of the kitchen is luke warm.  Now with all of the food offerings being tapas you would think they were cooked to order being such small dishes. That wasn't the case.  The owner was busy scaning the club determining how people were sitting rather than seeing if everything was satisfactory at the individual tables.  My second visit was worse than the first.  I hope that they make a go of it seeing that there too few venues here in orlando for live entertainment.  Maybe they should put up a suggestion box or do like some of the other places in orlando do and put a survey on the reciept to get some feedback.

When someone called to confirm day-off, I said \\"anyway we'll end up on the patio?\\" Her response was \\"we can't put parties of 7 on the patio.\\" Would have been nice if the original person had told me this!! It was gorgeous out and several people in my party were really looking forward to sitting outside.\\n\\n2) I was curious what beans were in their Mediterranean three-bean salad, so I asked. I was put on hold as the girl went to find out and when she returned, she said \\"we took that off the menu yesterday.\\" Darn!\\n\\nOur experience at Stephanie's was not much better. My fiance and I showed up about 5 minutes before our reservation and checked in. We were told we could be seated when everyone showed up. A few minutes later, a few more people showed, so we checked in again to see if we could be seated. We didn't get seated until over a half an hour AFTER our reservation time. And rather than give any explanation or apology, all we were told - 20 minutes before being seated - was that our table was being set.\\n\\nAs for dinner: the food is good. It's not amazing or the best I've ever had, but it's decent. I ended up with the Red beet and Vermont goat cheese salad: poached asparagus, chick peas, toasted walnuts, pickled onions, chopped tomatoes, sourdough croutons and baby spinach. Tossed with orange mustard vinaigrette.\\n\\nThere were definitely NO croutons, I believe lettuce instead of spinach, and a creamy dressing instead of vinaigrette. My friend ordered her salad with no dressing and it came DRENCHED in dressing.\\n\\nI also got the Blackberry Mojito: rum, fresh mint, fresh blackberries. Granted, it was listed under the martinis, so I shouldn't have been surprised that it came in a martini glass, but there was no mint whatsoever and the \\"fresh blackberries\\" were apparently the little \\"plops\\" floating around in my drink. We think they were the little bumps on blackberries. This was not worth $13.\\n\\nOverall, I ended up paying $37 for a salad & a drink. Now, I know Newbury St. is expensive and I was prepared to spend money, especially knowing that Stephanie's is always raved about and is one of the more expensive places. But this was not worth it. It's definitely over-hyped and I would not return."},{"name":"Bagel Palace Deli & Bakery","address":"2869 N Druid Hills Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"I went here for the first time on a Saturday afternoon and it was quite empty.

Fantastic change of course, that I wish more restaurants implemented.  \\n\\nI was much more pleased with this second try with Copious. I got a few small plates to sample, a few of which I had to take home cause I was full after eating two small plates. The Roasted Beet & Goat Cheese Salad was wonderful.

The dressing was refreshing, there was a decent amount of chopped red and golden beets. Several big clumps of the goat cheese, too.\\n\\nNow I know what all the craze is about for mashed cauliflower. OMG, the pillow-fluffy accompaniment to their Roasted Pork Belly starter was on the level of addictive. Really great subtle garlic notes.

Not just the food which is one of the best Italian meals I've had in Portland, but as well as the staff and the atmosphere. I recently just booked a reservation at Renata for my 35th birthday. I saw it on Portland dining month and wanted to check it out finally. Not only were they wonderful in making sure I had a table for my full party on a Friday night, but they went above and beyond upgrading my party in their private dining room due to a last minute cancellation. It was a sweet surprise I didn't even expect and made my birthday that much more special. I appreciate that very much. The staff was knowledgeable, extremely helpful, and very pleasant to be around. From the hostess to our waitress it was all around a delightful experience. AND THE FOOD!!!! Pasta, pizza, salads, everything was done to the nines. The flavors, the ingredients... it was one of the most delectably tasty dinners out I've had in a very long time. I can't recommend this place enough. Wether you wanted a delicious pizza for a causal dinner out, or a good date night spot with a little candle light and wine, Renata really has it all.

I went back to Candi's this weekend, this time with my wife, mother, and father. The service was quite a bit better this go round. The timing of the food arrival was a little off- we had ordered the biscuit beignets to be brought out first, like a breakfast appetizer if you will, and it ended up coming out last, also my wife's food came out long after the rest of ours. But this is a small quibble considering how ridiculously delicious (and inexpensive!) the food is. \\n\\nI ordered a stuffed biscuit and it changed my life. I know that sounds like an exaggeration, but if you look at my earlier review, I noted that I enjoy discovering new approaches to familiar dishes. Another reviewer here likened the stuffed biscuit to a calzone. I completely agree. They wrap their biscuit dough (which is seasoned to perfection) around pretty much anything you want. Mine had bacon, sausage, kielbasa, onion, and pepper jack cheese (dubbed The Meateyore). The biscuit dough was soft but not undercooked. The stuffing was plentiful but not unmanageable. Together, it made for a miracle in my mouth. My mother ordered a Sop 'em Up Biscuit that was also mouth watering. My wife ordered the Viva La Candi, which is what I ordered- and loved- on my previous visit. My dad had an omelet. I didn't get to try his, but he said it was great.\\n\\nI'm still gonna say the place could tighten up its service, but the food is undeniable and at these prices, I'll let the slack service slide. Candi's a new favorite."},{"name":"FuddoYama Ramen","address":"8610 SW Hall Blvd","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"The black garlic Ramen was delicious!

Great balance of meatiness from the pork, saltiness from the seaweed, slurpiness from the noodles, and richness in the broth. And there was a hard boiled egg on top which always makes things better.\\n\\nThe staff was very friendly and attentive. Our food came to us quickly. The environment of the restaurant was pleasant.

I'm not a duck fan, but the roasted duck is tasty and pretty perfect. In typical tapas fashion, the dishes will come out in shifts based on when the chef is done making them, but it keeps the table eating and enjoying themselves.\\n\\nMy tips?

Let me preface my comments by saying that I only have experience with the restaurant part the establishment, not the bar or club. \\n\\nI have always been quite satisfied with the food here. I have been a regular customer here for the past 2 years, and as a Boston native, I can say it's some of the best Chinese food I've had around this area. The food always arrives promptly, the service is great, and the prices are very reasonable. It is a great restaurant for college kids. The food is American Chinese - great scallion pancakes, crab rangoon, chicken lo mein, sesame chicken, pork fried rice, etc. There are some great lunch combos as well if you want an inexpensive meal with variety. \\n\\nThe restaurant is very clean and the waiters and waitresses do their best to take care of you as soon as possible. It's best to avoid the restaurant during late night hours on Friday and Saturday if you want a quieter, quicker dinner. I've dined here on Fridays and Saturdays at regular dinner hours and had nothing other than a great experience. I've also had my fair share of late nights there with friends during the rowdy hours after a night out. Anyway, I love the place. As soon as your water glass gets low, they fill it. With some of the waiters and waitresses there is a bit of a language barrier, but they are hardworking and ready to help you have a good experience.

The second time a friend and I ate at the bar. This was my first time dining in the bar, which is in the back of the restaurant, separate from the main dining room. There are TVs in the bar, which is nice if you want a nice meal and to catch a Celts or Soxs game. As always the wait staff was amazing- if you don't know what you want to drink, just leave it to Tim! On both occasions I ordered the original tonkotsu pork ramen; however, I substituted the soup noodles for the yam noodles, which are delicious, and added watercress. There many different add-ons, from veggies to meats, that are reasonably priced. The tonkotsu broth is thick and almost creamy, making it very filling and extremely flavorful.

Overall, the salads make for a decent decent daily lunch and the breakfast dishes make the restaurant a worthwhile brunch destination. But the dinner options disappoint; they're bland, surprisingly unimaginitive, and limited in number. Specialty drinks are very small and exquisitely expensive. Portions are appropriate at Harlow, prices a bit on the high side, but most vegetarian restaurants lean that way. \\nWhat really irks me is the 'higher than thou' attitude of the staff and the lack of service. Don't bother asking any questions about the food. Your only answer is on the menu. Need to make an adjustment due to taste preference or allergy? Nope. You'll be met with a minimum of one set of rolling eyes. Probably more. Look clearly at the staff: I've never seen such a group of people who refuse to smile, dress as extras from the Walking Dead, have immaculate hipster haircuts, and couldn't give a shit about their clientele. \\nThe sign at the front counter states that 'your server will bring you silverware.' Well, first, you don't have a server. You have somebody that transports the food from the kitchen counter to your table. There's a big difference. \\nYou have to order before you sit down, and NOBODY will ever stop by your table to see how the meal is or if you need anything. Second, the server sometimes brings a fork, sometimes doesn't, and that's it. So if you require a spoon or a knife, it's one more trip to the counter. \\nLest we forget, Harlow likes to add a 10% gratuity to the bill if your party's order is greater than $75. FOR WHAT? For nothing. It's just because they can.\\nLook at the clientele and you'll better understand. Harlow is filled with young fashionistas who know how to appoint a restaurant, make it just cool enough to get away with mediocrity but still remain a popular destination for the 20s and 30s crowd.

Here's how I'm rating this:\\n\\n1.) Menu Variety: Sarpino's has a great variety of items; pizza (of course), salads, sandwiches, calzones, pasta dishes, bread items, and chicken. The typical frozen desserts (cheesecake, tiramisu, chocolate mousse) that make it to your home edible, but still a bit frozen in the center as well. I haven't tried any of the calzones or pastas due to the pictures of the items on the site. They just don't appeal to me. Since Sarpino's has so many ingredients and sauces, it's not too hard to edit the order to make a specialty pasta or sandwich of your choice. I typically grab a gyro for lunch. Now, it's totally not authentic gyro meat, but it does the trick for my gyro cravings. I always add cucumber, feta, and black olive = YUM. The pizza is average. Better than your average chain (Pizza Hut/Dominos/Papa Johns/etc), but nothing like what I'd get back home. I'm still looking for my magical pizza parlor. Also, don't bother with the chicken wings. They are frozen and just... not... tasty. Dried out sauce, dried out meat, obviously frozen, but not quite sure if they're cooked completely. \\n\\n2.) Delivery/Customer Service: There has only been one time that I have been disappointed with the delivery service - mainly because I was so hungry. I was watching the clock, peeking out the window, giddy with excitement. \\"THE PIZZA'S ALMOST HERE!\\" After watching cars go by, hoping it was the pizza, I gave up. Right as I did, I got a call that the delivery was on it's way and that they had some trouble since my address got cut off on the receipt. Totally fine. It happens. Since there is NO CHARGE for delivery - yup, NO charge - also no minimum order - !WHAAAAT! - so that means I can order a sandwich and not have to worry about rackin' up the bill and the leftovers. Every delivery guy I've had has been super friendly as well. \\n\\n3.) Consistency: This is the only part I have to be \\"strict\\" about. I've had a few orders get messed up - missing items on my sandwiches, salads being pretty skimpy (compared to previous orders), etc. The salad thing was a big one, since we split the salad up with all the roommates, one is usually enough for us to all have a nice portion. It's at the point where I'm always debating on getting two salads, just in case they decide to be a bit skimpy. The pizza is sometimes hit or miss as well. I'll usually split a pie with my boyfriend, his side with toppings, mine plain ol' cheese (I'm vanilla like that). Consistently, his side is HUGE. Not a huge deal at all, but eh - I want my pizza halved 50/50. \\n\\nOverall, I really enjoy this location and will continue to be a regular with this business."},{"name":"Sweet Cheeks Q","address":"1381 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"Well,what to say about this place...great big fluffy biscuits,the best I've ever had,served w/addictive honey butter.Great beer list,good wines-a tasty riesling from upstate N.Y.

It was cold and the quality was AWEFUL.  It looked and tasted like store bought battered and fried product and the marinara was canned.\\n\\nEntrees, not much better.  I had the Lamb Tips  and she the Chicken Parm.  We also go the broccoli rabe for a side.  THE lamb was very basic and without much flavor and the starch that came with the lamb was flavorless boiled potatoes that were chucked into a fryolator.  Guess that's how Sabatino's \\"roasts\\" there potatoes.  Gross.  The Chicken parm was average, but it looked like take-out on a plate.  The broccoli rabe was actually good.  Cooked well with good flavor and garlic.\\n\\nSplit the Tiramisu, which was obviously bought from someware and simply scooped out and slapped onto a plate.   Which after the appetizer and entrees probably wasn't a bad thing.\\n\\nSo for two people to eat a really bad meal with 2 beers and a tip....93 BUCKS!!!\\n\\nNo worries for me, as I will NEVER return to Sabatino's.

Fresh, hot, and came out at around the right time.  That's the only reason that the star rating is as high as a 2.  The service was, quite honestly, the worst I have ever received.  About a 40 minute wait for a table, understandable as it was quite busy, so my wife and I went to the bar. Here we witnessed a single bartender that was swamped. She had to do the bar, restaurant service, and run her own food. We waited over 10 minutes to give our order. When our table was ready I could not get her attention for my check and after another 10 mins just walked away to my table. I figured she'd notice I was gone and come looking which she did at the end of our meal. Our waiter seemed pretty attentive until we have our order, then he was nowhere to be seen until I noticed him racing past our table towards the end of our meal. My wife ordered some margaritas that were terrible. First one was loaded with triple sec, way too sweet. She asked for one with less triple sec and it was just tequila and lime juice. The replacement was pure sugar with the triple sec again. Finally told the waiter to just take it back.\\n\\nI'll probably try this place again in a few months once they work the kinks out but until then I'll go to Senor Tequilas."},{"name":"Carrabba's Italian Grill","address":"8355 International Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"The owner PJ Jones Is Awesome.

I was really looking forward to trying Gari. I thought our experience would be great. Instead we dropped almost 80 bucks and left hungry, after eating mediocre food. \\n\\nThe inside is very cute, I'll give a star on that. Plus I loved the plum sake, then service was ok the first half of the meal..The menu is very fusion, so thought I be creative and get a large fusion maki roll. I decided on the volcano roll for $16. It was supposed to have shrimp, scallops and crabmeat. I could not make out any scallops or crabmeat in it.  I don't think they were put in. It was a big disappointment. Basically it was a shrimp tempura maki presented standing up, then with a syrupy mushroom sauce all over it. Can you say Americanized...\\n\\nMy bf had an appetite for something new so asked the server to have them make him sushi and sashimi platter. She asked how much he wanted to spend, he said $25-30 bucks. Now they have a sushi and sashimi special with a ton of food for 28 bucks so we said something like that but with some creativity. What he got was terrible. They gave 4 pieces of sushi, then used the torch on them to cook them, not even making then sushi at that point.  Then a cucumber roll and 5 pieces of another roll which was a glorified california roll. We both were like ok, they are going to bring you sashimi next cause that was small and we knew the cost of the stuff on the plate was lower then his range he said to make it. He finished, still hungry then the server came over to see if we needed anything else, he said is there something else coming for me? she said no. Then he asked for a breakdown of what he got for the price. She claimed it all added up to what he said. He was obviously disappointed and was more to find out she charged him the top of what he would spend when the bill came over ($29). Meanwhile the servers went to the back and started whispering. Totally awkward. Our bill was almost $80 (4 pieces of sushi, and 3 rolls with some sake) and we both left completely dissatisfied! \\n\\nOn another note, the sushi chefs looked extremely unenthused behind the bar. It was a Friday evening with the place a quarter full so there was plenty of opportunity to wow customers. \\n\\nIf you go there (there are such better places in the area but if you do anyways), don't fall for the fusion crap that's overpriced..just stick with the basics and don't ask them to make you something unique.

I know I have.  To help ease this wish, ai3 and Peace Design joined forces with the Fifth Group to create a seaside experience in the space that once housed Vickery's on Crescent Avenue transforming it into an up-scale yet casual seafood dining spot called Lure.  The coastal aura of Lure helps relieve that urban edginess and gives our land-locked city the feel of being near the beach especially when sitting on the comfy patio, and who doesn't love that feeling?  At the helm of this eatery's galley is Executive Chef David Bradley who has worked his way through the various other Fifth Group endeavors and has learned to cast his lines in the right spots to pull in the freshest seafood available. But what makes this seafood so good is that Chef Bradley has a knack for preparing his catch in a way that it never loses the delicate nuances of the sea.\\n\\nIn addition to the fabulous seafood, Lure has a beverage program like none other.  The mastermind behind the extensive and mind-boggling offerings is Sommelier Vajra Stratigos, who is the Fifth Group's beverage director.  Whether it's a classy cocktail, a glass of spectacular wine, thirst quenching housemade shrubs, or an exotic drink made with sh≈çch no matter your desire there is enough playfulness with any of the choices to set the stage for a most relaxing evening.  The drinks I was most fascinated with were the ones made with sh≈çch - first it is not offered often, but more importantly it has such clean lush flavors making it one super-smooth sipper.  Using yeast isolated from dianthus flowers, the distilled barley Sh≈çch Nadeshiko is known for its rich fragrance and elegant taste, but Vajra amped it up by adding fresh tarragon and licorice root.  The other that beckons some delicacies from the raw bar is the Sudachi Sh≈çch that's distilled molasses infused with sudachi juice- a Japanese fruit similar to a lime - as a nice twist, citrus oil and skins are added to this award honored liqueur giving is a seductive liveliness that is so easy to enjoy. \\n\\nAt Lure, the main attraction is the best seafood in ATL, and its freshness makes such a difference in mouth feel giving it that just off the boat taste. The raw shellfish offering typically consists of magnificent East Coast oysters - which are known for their salinity and opulent flavors, plump quahog clams, and just maybe the sweet yet succulent highly rich in omega-3 Taylor Bay Scallops from Buzzards Bay in Massachusetts; have fun exploring the uniqueness's of these luscious morsels by choosing some of whatever's available. If raw is not your thing, Lure has some amazing fruits of the sea appetizers to tease and please the appetite. The Smoked Scallop Crudo are thinly sliced scallops from Georges Bank that are briefly cold smoked with olive wood which adds depth to the rich buttery flavors of these delectable delights. The other smoked offering is the Seafood Platter whose presentation is somewhat like a charcuterie but instead a potpourri of Neptune's delights with Atlantic salmon, bluefish, and rainbow trout p√¢t√© that beckons a glass of William Fevre Espino with its rich citrusy fruit and palate coating creaminess - this makes for one awesome insatiable pairing.\\n\\nThe small plates are meant for sharing, but after the first bite you might not be in the mood to share.  The boquerones are slivers of marinated Spanish anchovies that are served on manchego toast points with a dab of saut√©ed sweet onions- it's a yum.  If fried is your thing both the Rhode Island Calamari and the Ipswich Clam Bellies will satisfy any New Englanders craving for a taste of home, these crispy tender delights are full of ''le go√ªt de la mer''- the taste of the sea.  There's the \\"make it yourself \\" wrap of grilled octopus and pulled pork that's been marinated in a housemade Vietnamese fish sauce, mixed Asian herbs, and is served with a spicy nuoc cham sauce that you fold into bibb lettuce leaves making each bite a hands-on thrilling adventure. The dish not to be missed is the grilled whole rainbow trout from the Bramlett's fish farm in North Georgia.  The way this pristine fish is prepared is what dreams are made. The head on trout is stuffed with fresh thyme, tarragon, and lemon then grilled perfectly giving it a nice char finish and topped with a sweet and tangy muscadine butter - picture perfect presentation with the flavors are simply unforgettable.\\n\\nWhen you think its time to pull in your line, leave room for that one last bite, as the desserts are as satisfying as the other menu catches.  The delectable guava and coconut bread pudding that's topped with roasted hazelnuts and a creamy vanilla custard- like cr√®me anglaise will surely help reset your sweet dream button. Lure with its top-notch wait staff is ready to assist anytime to cast your line to hook up with the freshest seafood."},{"name":"Stauf's Coffee Roasters","address":"1277 Grandview Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Staufs is amazing.

I live in Revere and have driven by this place many times saying I'll try it another time but I am reminded that I am probably going to get an expensive version of mall \\"Thai\\" food.  Well I broke down the other day and decided for a late lunch on Saturday.  I wanted to find out what authentic Thai tastes like.  I sat at the bar and noticed an American man sitting in the corner with the staff delegating.  The first thought popped into my mind was that he was married to someone in the staff.  As I waited for my order of Penang Chicken Curry the American man Ron approached me welcoming me to his restaurant explaining \\"you're probably wondering what a guy like me is doing here, well I am the owner, I am a French Chef who lived in Thailand for 23 years and married to my \\"better half\\" who is Thai\\".  He asked me if I ever had Thai food and I couldn't answer other than mall kiosks and from a trip to Key West at a floating Thai Restaurant upon the recommendation of my friend who has ties to Thailand but wasn't good.  Anyway the man introduced himself as Ron the owner and so we got into a conversation about have I ever had Thai food and told my experience.  He went over the menu about the dish that I ordered and explained about spicy whether or not I like it and I can handle most spicy dishes but he explained that the dish and his chefs are authentic....(it says so on the sign).  \\n\\nThe service was fast and staff very welcoming and as I waited for my dish I noticed that every customer walking through the door was on a first name basis with Ron and he was very welcoming to his customers.  It was a mix of Thai and American.  The place has a very welcoming atmosphere and staff and is not to big or too small to where you can get that kind of personal attention.  I was feeling good about this place so far.  When my dish arrived I was impressed with the presentation and portion but the rice cup was too small for the dish I thought.  It was sweet with the right amount of kick.  I loved it.\\n\\nThe next day I was at my friends house who lives in Jamaica Plain as well as my friend who has ties to Thai and my buddy from J.P. and his wife mentioned the best Thai they had was here in Revere.

It seemed the barista had a cool-girl complex going on, and I didn't appear to be a cool hipster strolling through her coffee shop. Anyways there is a door on either side of the place. So I start walking towards one to finally pee while she makes my coffee... and she's all \\"you're going the right way, you're going the right way, yep, you're definitely going the right way\\" umm?? Am I? So I continued walking to the door and this guy was sitting at one of the tables chuckling \\"oh, she was just joking, the bathroom is actually on the other side\\" so I started walking towards the other door trying to not bring so much attention to myself, I mean jeez I am so so sorry I have to pee. Anyways I'm walking across the place and she's holding out a key for me to use, I go to take it, and she pulls it away? Ha ha? What? And she's like \\"I'm gonna need you to chill for a sec, take a breath. Take a breath with me come on 1 2 3\\" huhhhh??? I was truly confused. All I did was try to buy coffee from you and pee. I'm beyond sorry that I don't have this chic vibe you are apparently looking for. So whatever, I played her game. At this point I wanted to be like forget it I'm getting coffee somewhere else but I didn't want to draw attention to myself or embarrass HER. Anyways she finally gave me the key, I peed, I came out, she shamed me some more in front of the other customers, and so on. Coffee tasted awful, tasted like alcohol almost. Maybe my taste buds were just tarnished from that experience. Who's to say? Ended up tossing the coffee after a couple sips because I could not believe what just happened.  I was having a great afternoon until then. I hope the baristas can be taught to have some more respect for customers, and lose the extremely unwarranted attitude. I've never had such a strange experience in a coffee shop."},{"name":"Stauf's Coffee Roasters","address":"1277 Grandview Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Ok here goes.

An elder family member really wanted to come here so I bit the bullet and headed over. The restaurant (if you even call it that) is small and dingy. The place has 5 small tables which look more like furniture they got for free off Craigslist. The ground is dirty and I didn't even want to find out what the washrooms looked like. Printouts of random sushi combos and menu items were randomly taped on the walls. The Chinese lady taking orders seemed a little grumpy and kept turning around and barking orders to the poor workers behind her.\\n\\nWe ordered a dish of salmon and tuna sashimi, an Alaska roll, and house roll. We were given Styrofoam plates and plastic soy containers. I know this is more of a takeout place but it felt like we were dining at a homeless shelter. The sashimi and sushi pieces were twice as large as any other Japanese restaurant and unfortunately, that's the only good thing I can say. The sashimi was stale and overly slimy - it tasted like week-old fish from Superstore's clearance section. I was seriously contemplating running to Shoppers for some Imodium. The burrito-sized house roll was jammed with random ingredients and fell apart when you tried to pick it up. The end pieces were more like small pizzas than a piece of sushi. \\n\\nOur meal cost $25 which isn't bad for the sheer volume of food but I can think of better ways to spend my money.

It was pretty busy and the hostess was very nice.  She answered a few of my questions easily and was descript enough that it helped me finalize my lunch order.\\n\\nI ordered the pulled pork sandwich ($11) on a bulky roll (or you can get it on Texas toast = toasted white/wonder bread).  It comes with 1 hot scoop and 1 cold scoop (in other words 2 sides).  I picked the cole slaw and mac n cheese.  I also decided to order the salt and pepper potatoes ($3).  The S&PPs were to be a little test..I figure that if you F up french fries then you probably shouldn't be in business...right?\\n\\nI cracked open the 'fries' 1st (I wanted to eliminate any possible steaming effect).  Much to my surprise they looked more like if you deep fried an apple peel...thick, curly, semi chunky and golden brown...and guess what, they were damn good!  Just the right amount of salt and pepper, hot, crispy and alot of them.\\n\\nNext, I opened up the sandwich.  It comes with 3 little BBQ sauce samples, a side of raw onions as well as some homemade pickles (think bread & butter style).  The meat looks great : charred and juicy.  The bulky roll is more of a traditional white bread / hamburger roll, and is grilled.  This sandwich alone was awesome.  Tender meat, luscious, smokey and all around good!  At this point I was a little heistant to try the BBQ sauces...but I had to.  And all 3 were very good, so you can't go wrong whichever way you go with that.  Oh, the raw onions, might have been good on the sandwich but I didn't use them...and the pickles were very good too.  I ate them alone: tangy, crisp and sweet.\\n\\nThe Mac N Cheese was great too.  Came in a small plastic container, like the smallest one you can get at a deli for pasta salad or whatever.  I read some say it was greasy, but I strongly disagree.

I never hung out here much or had the food, but the drinks were fine. Well, the new version s pretty damn awesome.

Not only are e syrups that Blair makes top notch, but when mixed up according to actual long lost tiki recipes, you know you're in for a treat. And these drinks are going to take a minute to mix.

Both are excellent options, but don't go to one expecting the treatment you'll get at the other.\\n\\nAt lunch, service is snappy and the meals are a terrific value. Most lunch specials cost about $7.50 and include fried rice, soup, an egg roll, and a chicken wing, and come with hot tea.  We're usually able to box up about half our meal for a future lunch and still leave satisfied.  Food isn't exactly traditional; it's about what you'd expect for \\"Chinese lunch\\" in a suburban commercial district.  Their service is phenomenal - unless you've got an unusually large group, you'll probably be seated as soon as you walk in. You'll have a waiter of your own, but you can count on being looked after by a half-dozen other staff members who will bring your food and keep your drinks always full.  Service is extremely fast - once, I timed 18 minutes between the time I walked in the door and when they handed me my check - but you never feel rushed, and they'll keep refilling your drinks long after they've brought the bill.  Everyone is friendly but professional, and you really get the sense that they all have a stake in making your meal enjoyable.\\n\\nDinner is something else entirely.  The first time I went, it was something of a shock: the restaurant had become much quieter and more formal, and the menu was much more a-la-carte.

I don't go there for dinner nearly as often as I do for lunch, but have never been disappointed.\\n\\nLet me also take a moment to tell you about the chopsticks.  A lot of restaurants give you dinky, splintery break-apart chopsticks even when you dine-in.  Canton Cooks gives you long, solid, plastic ones.

The burritos have also gone down in quality. \\n\\nThe service the last time I went here was awful. Our waitress had an openly hostile demeanor. She didn't write down our order, which made me wonder if she would remember it all. Lo and behold, she forgot my entire order of three pupusas. I had looked her in the eye when I ordered them, so I know she heard me. She avoided our table for the next fifteen minutes. My husband went up to the counter where she was, and asked about the missing pupusas. With an attitude, she said that I had never ordered them. When my husband insisted that yes, she did order them, she denied it again. He asked for them to be made, anyway. \\n\\nTen minutes later, the food came out. The pupusas were good as usual, but I was pissed at how we were treated. I am usually easy going, as far as service is concerned, and I am generally understanding when a mistake is made. However, her nastiness and denial was unacceptable. After that experience, in addition to the other issues mentioned, I don't plan on going back. There are plenty of places in East Boston with great pupusas."},{"name":"Hale Pele","address":"2733 NE Broadway","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Hale Pele. Despite having the cheesy look and vibe of a 1960's hawaiian snuff film, you still managed to warm my soul. \\n\\nThis place is sort of hidden on one of those quaint and unassuming streets in Portland. You know... the ones full of wonderment, gravy, and exoctic island drinks! Hale Pele is a tad small, so if you roll-in with a large group you might want to call ahead and ask for the back booth area. Even though this place is a tad on the tiny side the drink menu is staggering, with all kinds of island or tiki styled cocktails. Each cocktail having a brief description of the drinks ingredients and city of origin. \\n\\nI went with the Vegas drink or course, the Lapu Lapu. This drink is styled more like a Mai Tai, in the sense that It's not blended (slushy), but mixed with multiple rum options and fruit juices, surprisingly it was not super sweet. The Lapu Lapu has orange, lemon, and passion fruit juices in a blend of rums. They will explain the list of rums in the drink, but who cares you're on the islands mon!\\n\\nThe decor in here awesome, picture Gilligan's Island in the middle of a Hunter S. Thompson hallucination. Flying inflated puffer fish, bright colors, and tiki masks everywhere, one of which comes to life when you order the Volcano Bowl! \\n\\nThis large bowl of booze awakens not only your drinky senses, but the booze gulping gods as well. When the Volcano Bowl make it's appearance, the sounds of a lava eruption echo through the place long with steam coming from the walls. To top it off, once the bowl of heaven is delivered they light it on fire, shooting a tall, but brief fireball into the air. This place could give Frankie's Tiki Room in Vegas a real run for it's money. \\n\\nHeaded to Portland and want to do something that's not so Portlandy?

I had the red curry and it was just the right amount of spicy and had the bamboo shoots chopped pretty thin (which was great). The thai iced tea was made with ice cream (I think), so it was especially yummy. My only complaint was that while the restaurant was pretty empty for a Sunday afternoon, we were still sat by the bathrooms. Why not give us a better seat? I didn't ask, but it seemed like a common sense thing to do. The owner came and greeted us and was a super nice guy. What was confusing however was that he was working at the bar on a laptop and was watching a movie without headphones...

This place may look like it has something going for it over Tin & Taco, but it doesn't seem to hold up - it tasted like standard downtown bar fare with a little creativity.\\n\\nThe staff: Bartender was fine, we didn't make any conversation (he stayed on the other side of the bar my whole visit) and he didn't seem to be super stoked about their concept (it's a new restaurant, I usually expect the staff to be selling the place, but everyone was sort of on autopilot here - including the servers).

I also had the basil and tofu rice dish, which I really liked, it was spicy, in a flavourful way and not a hot kind of way. The BF had a carrot, celery, and ginger juice, which was really good. I usually find vegetable juices to be a bit too bitter for me. He also ordered the Nucau bowl, which was kind of like a salad on top of a rice and steak (tempeh) dish.

The \\"Hawthorne Mac\\" is made with crappy Daiya cheese and after having tried Daiya's m&c out of the box recently, it tasted exactly the same. Definitely encourage Harlow to come up with their own homemade nut cheese rather than Daiya and make this worth the price. Also I gotta say the chai is really, really bad. Please get your hands on some Prana Chai and do it right for the price (and offer almond milk, which is much more neutral for chai) - Portland has a lot of bad chai and this was no exception.\\n\\nOther than that this is definitely a great go-to place for the vegan and vegan-friendly.

The patio was indeed private as we were consistently stopped by security when trying to go outside (even though I was with the birthday girl herself). Our \\"bar section\\" was anything but private however. The worst part of the night was the bar service. They had two slow, unfriendly bartenders on a crazy busy Saturday night. They were definitely slowed down by the fact that it appears that they are required to use jiggers to make drinks. The first round took 30 minutes to get and the second round another 25 minutes. We wanted to purchase shots as well but be careful what you order as the bar is not fully stocked either. We tried to order cafe patron, they didnt have it. Then Jagermeister, they didn't have that either. Of course our bartender had to check first as she wasn't even sure!!! We finally got so exasperated that we left as we had noticed several of her party guests had already done.

The decor is very upscale and the waiters were very friendly and helpful. \\n\\nThe food was definitely above average. Like many Italian spots, they gave you bread and olive oil to start.

The stuff at Primo is a very deep golden color (the first sign of a quality oil) and has a great acidic taste. Really nice. \\n\\nI had Linguine and Clams.

Chef Ruston Richardson and the amazing kitchen crew delivered. \\nLet me start with the most pretentious. James Bond screwed me over. I'm a dirty martini girl. And everyone who drinks vodka martinis, makes baby Jesus cry. I'm just saying. The reason I love gin---is because of the botanicals that come to the surface in a good one. It makes me happy, ok? And when you shake the hell out of gin....you wash away all the really lovely delicate botanical notes and ice crystals form and well (i hate ice), and, well, you just ruined my damn drink. So at the expense of 007 jokes and eye rolls, I always ask for my damn martinis stirred and not shaken. And I accept all the flack, bc I get to drink a slice of heaven in the end. That said--- excellent martini, Sir (very cute) Bartender.  \\nMy friend and I kicked off the night with a serving of the Brussels sprouts and the green ceviche.\\nSO good. The sprouts had a beautiful poached egg in top that was perfect and the blue cheese, Lardon (pork fat), and croutons that complimented the sprouts were so perfect. I'm not a fan of pork or bacon or anything from a pig. But the Lardon was not overwhelming to me and actually enjoyable. \\nThe green ceviche was perfect. There are times I've bitten into a dish like this and just puckered at how sour/tart the citrus in it is. This was done perfectly. The citrus was not overpowering so I was able to actually taste all the other really lovely things happening in the dish. \\nFor dinner my friend got the Prawns over spaghetti squash and i got the scallops with cauliflower magic happening all over it. I didn't remember what was in my friends prawn dish----but when she let me taste it, I was really pleasantly surprised by what I *think* --- was cumin/coriander and some other masala-esk notes. So good and really flavorful!\\nNow---I am not a fan of scallops. Mostly because the ones I've had have been cooked very poorly and have turned me off of them. By the waitress highly recommended them and I will always listen to their recommendations. When I got my meal, my friend was talking about something that I really wanted to listen to, but as soon as I bit into my meal, all I wanted to do was be quiet for a minute and taste everything. So so so good. And that's my professional opinion. Every part of this dish was balanced and playful and lovely. It made my heart happy. (I paired this dish with a white wine....and it was the perfect compliment.)\\nWe let our waitress pick our dessert and she chose the churros. Because I'm 12, when the dish came out, I began to make a stream of phallic jokes. All joking aside-----holy potato --- this desert was soooo good!! The apples dolce---yes!! The horchata cream--yes!!! The crunchy outer layer and soft inner layer of the cinnamony churro---yes!!\\n\\nMy ass was happy. :) and there's a lot of it, so that's a lot of happy. ;) \\n\\nThe experience of Coast:\\nBlink and you'll miss it. You have to be looking for Coast to find it and when you do, you've struck gold. It's small and intimate yet open and energetically bright. How is it that EVERY. SINGLE. Staff member here is gorgeous? Inside and out. Our waitress was a raven haired goddess who was so nice and patient when we took roughly 30 minutes to order a drink. (So sorry). We took our time ordering---kept our menus with us, and just stayed present through each course. And it was worth it. I stick out like a sore thumb in Austin because I love dressing up and my closet rarely sees a shoe with an heel less than 3 inches. I loved having a place where I could dress up but still be at home with my child-like, 12 year old spirit.

I'm Cambodian, and growing up/living in Minnesota, there just aren't really any Khmer/Cambodian restaurants around here (in spite of our pretty decent Khmer population). I traveled to Boston for a work trip and my coworker told me about Num Pang Kitchen. It's located in the Mall that's connected to the Marriott Copley hotel which was where I was staying, so I HAD to check it out. When I got there, it took me awhile to figure out what to order because I really did not recognize a lot of what was on the menu as being traditionally Cambodian, or Cambodian at all. That kind of confused me. I took a chance and just ordered one of their sandwiches that was on special which was the Khmer sausage. Looking back, I wish I had just gotten the steak sandwich. The sausage was actually pretty good but not totally what I expected. Overall the sandwich tasted like it was trying to be a banh mi sandwich but didn't quite get it right. It wasn't bad by any means at all - in fact, flavor profile was pretty good. But it also wasn't that great that I would order it again. I also wasn't a fan of the type of bread they used - maybe because it tasted so much like it should be a banh mi sandwich that I really wanted it to be made with crusty French bread and it wasn't?

We arrived with no reservation and asked for a table for 7. They were super nice about us just popping in and were ready to seat us immediately, but I asked if we could hang out in the club-like bar. Very nice room. Impressive wine and creative cocktail lists, but prices challenge those in NYC...$15 for cocktails and wine was $8 and up-up-up. My colleagues all commented on how the cocktails pack a punch and the wine was well presented in upscale stemware.\\n\\nWe were seated quickly upstairs in a balcony room and started perusing the menu. The crab cakes and other starters were highly recommended by the server. Once I had crab cakes that were basically big lumps of crab barely held together by some crumb at a roadhouse in Baltimore. This is the standard by which I measure all other crab cakes. The ones at Stephanie's were OK -there were some lumps of crab...tasty but not much heft on the palette, in fact a little mushy. The spinach and artichoke dip was well presented with plenty of pita chips. Appetizers rate a 3.\\n\\nWe worked our way around the menu, sharing bites - shrimp salad, mac and cheese, a very nice soup,a fish special. The flavors were ok, but a little over-salted. The size of the portions (massive) was actually a turn-off. I hate feeling like I am wasting food. My shrimp salad mountain was mostly composed of lettuce without dressing and just 3 giant shrimp which were overcooked and rubbery and lukewarm. The truffled mac and cheese had one burst of truffle aroma, then I couldn't taste it anymore because it was overwhelmed by the prosciutto and cheese in the mix. The cuisine has good intentions but needs some oversight and finesse from chef so I am rating a 2.5-3.\\n\\nDesserts were very good - the server recommended gingerbread cake so passionately that we had to give it a try. Light, melt in your mouth, gingery goodness. I would skip the ice cream on this next time - it overwhelmed the fine crumb. We also tried an apple caramel bread pudding that was very nice. Desserts get a 4.\\n\\nVery friendly, intuitive, and knowledgeable guidance from the millions of white shirted, long apron-ed service staff, including our server David. We were never left wanting and never rushed. I would give service a 4.  (However, on our way out, I did see lots of the staff hanging out by the kitchen yucking it up - wonder if that accounts for some of the knocks on service other reviewers have given?)\\n\\nSo to wrap it up - the elements are right - service, ambiance, selection, flavor...but the presentation and quality of the food -- served in overly large portions and not cooked up to the standard the environment and the service suggests -- left me feeling the overall rating is a 3."},{"name":"Diesel Cafe","address":"257 Elm St","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"NO FREE WIFI\\n\\nI'm visiting town.

The folks here take very good care of their customers and I have much respect for that.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the BBQ itself was pretty darn sub-par.  My Pineland Farms Short Rib looked delicious at first, but turned out to be intolerably dry...ie. I barely made it halfway through the rib with the help of copious amounts of the trio of sauces at the table.  My friend's Berkshire Pulled Pork and Great Northern Brisket were decent for the first couple bites and essentially inedible thereafter from the dryness.  My bro's Berkshire Pork Belly was very fatty and nicely seasoned, though bear in mind that it's nearly impossible to screw up meat that's at least 50% fat...and there were still several dried out pieces in the mix.  The saving grace was the very generous portions all-around - you'll be plenty full provided that you can actually finish the food.\\n\\nI did really enjoy the Mac N' Cheese, homestyle with tons of flavor.  That turned out to be the highlight of the meal sadly enough.  Sweet Cheeks has a great, lively atmosphere and exceptional service that was enough to bump it up to 3 stars, but Chef Faison has some serious work to do with her BBQ."},{"name":"Hong Kong","address":"1238 Massachusetts Ave","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3","text":"Ordered chicken chow mein, got breansprouts, fail?"},{"name":"Saz√≥n","address":"1816 S Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Tonight I was looking for high flavor, but lighter than traditional Tex-Mex fare and I found it in the Pipian Verde Pollo plate.

I'm going to try to replicate that at home.

Again, it took us another fifteen minutes to speak to anyone. Finally, we were acknowledged and we gave our drink orders. In another ten minutes, our drinks finally arrived.

While we sat there, we saw a waitress come out and look around. Although she made eye contact with me and I tried to wave her over, she ignored us. This happened three more times before again, we decided to go over to the bar and get our own drinks. \\n\\nAs expected, the bar tender ignored us for as long as she could. The bar was not even busy so she stood talking to a co worker until my husband went over and asked her for two beers. She rolled her eyes and made it seem like we were inconveniencing her. She continued her conversation for a while before she even walked over to the tap. Finally, we paid our tab and started to drink our drinks. While we sat there, we overheard the bar tender complaining about our tip to one of the servers. We gave her a few dollars but we were not happy about the service therefore we did not overtip. I personally was highly offended upon hearing this. I've worked as a waitress since I was a teenager and I am a very good tipper. This being said, I am a fair tipper. 15% is not great but its fair for the service we received. If anything, she should have gotten less. It was so rude and inappropriate of the bar tender to be complaining at all, never mind so clearly in front of us and other customers. \\n \\nAside from the staff, one of my other concerns is the atmosphere. It seems like a lot of... sketchy (to put it nicely), people hang out around/outside of the patio. I have even witnessed a fight outside! It is uncomfortable and distracting to be around! For this reason, I've always refrained from bringing my children or my parents. \\n\\nOverall this place is unfriendly, unprofessional and not worth it. I will never ever ever be returning.

Also, I felt like I was in Dallas. Places like this need to get out of Austin!!! I only went here because an out of town guest chose it.

I received all the dishes at different times, which made it pretty easy to continually eat my dishes, and offer servings to others. The meat dish was tasty. Different types of meat with amazingly tart mustard on a bed of untoasted naan (minute drawback). The salmon was well done with an interesting mayonaise sauce. I don't like mayo, though it still worked well, but still a bit ick. The latke-like fritter bed it came on was just a terrible after-thought. It was rubbery, hard to bite off, and really didn't belong with the dish, I feel.\\n\\nOh, the baby back rib? Divine. There was a long wait between my two first dishes and this one, but I must say it was pretty worth it. It crumbled in defeat at the sight of my fork and gave itself over entirely to me.

When I told her that wontons is really a worthless gesture, her response was \\"At least it's better than nothing.\\"  Well, yes my nothing is what they will get from me.

That would normally mean a 45 minute wait and a noisy, raucous crowd.  However, on this occasion the place was not too crowded and really pretty quiet, which was nice.  BJ's is one of our favorite spots to hit up for menu and you get the recipe for multiple Grubgraders visits.  The only negative is that sometimes the place gets super busy.  There is nothing special about the exterior, and the interior is clean with an upscale, contemporary d√©cor.  BJ's has really nice table spacing, so you will not feel like you're sitting on top of another family.  There are lots of widescreen monitors on the walls, so this might not be the place for a first date if you have a touch of ADHD.\\n\\nHigh marks:  Clean, contemporary, nice table spacing\\nLow marks:   Can get extremely crowded, exterior a little bland\\n\\nService:  Grade B-:   Overall, we received pretty good service on our visit.  The low score is actually due to some bad advice we received from our server.  We will go over the food in the next section, but if you are a server reading this blog, take note: if you offer your unsolicited opinion on how to tweak a dish, you'd better be right.  Unfortunately, our server botched this, and you can read the details in the next section.  Food and drinks came out quickly, and we never had a prolonged wait for our server to attend to our needs.\\n\\nHigh marks:  Accurate, quick service\\nLow marks:   Bad advice from server\\n\\nFood/Spirits:  Grade B:  As previously mentioned, BJ's Brewhouse in one of our favorite spots.  While they usually have really good food and excellent pizza, the real reason we like the place so much is the mixed drink menu.  As a beer drinker primarily, I usually do not have any problem finding adult beverages to enjoy when we go out, but Katina has it a bit rougher.  Since she primarily is a cocktail person, Katina is particularly fond of establishments with large drink menus.  BJ's has a big drink menu, and pretty much every drink Katina has sampled she has enjoyed.  On this occasion, she sampled BJ's Berry Jack Lemonade and the Strawberry Splash.  Katina thought both drinks were tremendous.  I had a couple of their seasonal Octoberfest beers and a BJ's PM Porter.  I have tried all of BJ's home brews and enjoyed them, but I advise you to go during the winter when the seasonal beer is the Grand Cru.  Definitely try one, and if you enjoy it, order a second - just hand off your car keys before you do because that particular beer packs a big punch.  Most of BJ's menu is delicious, but we happen to be particularly fond of their deep dish pizza.  On this occasion, we sampled the new Pepperoni Extreme pizza with sausage added.  Our server talked us into ordering it with hand tossed crust instead of the normal thick, deep dish crust.  This turned out to be a mistake.  The pizza was good, and there was a ton of pepperoni on it, but the thicker crust would have evened out the flavor more.\\nNow, let's get serious.  I hope many of you give BJ's a shot if you haven't done so already.  And we normally are not big dessert connoisseurs - we have found it hard to maintain our sweet figures if we eat too much of them.  However, if you go to BJ's and do not order a Pizookie, then you are seriously damaged.  Think of a huge, perfectly cooked, warm, soft cookie - sounds good, right?  Now throw some ice cream on that!  Pow!  Pizookie.  Enjoy.  \\n\\nHigh marks:  Great cocktails and beer, Pizookie so good you'll need to go to confession  \\nLow marks:  Pizza needs deep dish crust\\n\\nValue:  Grade B:  You will get pretty generous portion sizes at BJ's, and since I know you are going to follow my advice and order a Pizookie, plan on leaving stuffed.  If you have the will power to go to BJ's Brewhouse and just get an entr√©e and appetizer, your wallet will be pretty happy with you.  You are also no fun.  If you give in to temptation (like we always do) and add a couple (or half dozen) drinks to the tab, and you can get a little pricey.  BJ's drinks are not cheap, but they're awesome, so you'll have to decide for yourself if they're worth it.  We think they are.  \\n\\nHigh marks:   Generous portions, good food\\nLow marks:   Adding drinks and dessert will drive your bill up"},{"name":"Steak ‚Äôn Shake","address":"12163 S Apopka-vinland Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"2","text":"Absolutely horrible.

They have a nice-looking patio, but we opted to sit inside because of the local Juneuary weather (I even had to close the window next to our table, which is too bad).\\n\\nEverything about my experience today was excellent. Prompt and friendly service, even as we were (as usual) indecisive about what to eat. The food was really really, really good: the lobster ravioli and the lasagna were both perfect, in creamy sauces that didn't feel too thick or heavy. The polpettine appetizer (minced tuna and eggplant baked into little balls in a spicy tomato sauce) was also very very good. Even the bread tasted fresh - I don't know if they bake it on site but it definitely seems like it could be.\\n\\nThe lunch menu is not very diverse, with only a few mains to choose from and most of them are vegetarian. However, if everything on the menu is as good as the items we had today, there should be something for everyone. They also claim to be \\"ocean wise and free range\\" and offer gluten-free pasta on request.\\n\\nThe prices are not cheap, so this is a place to splurge on rather than to go to on a regular basis (for me that is. Your budget might be different, of course, in which case next time, you're paying). For the two of us for lunch (two mains and one appetizer, no drinks and no dessert) our bill came to $66 incl tax and tip.

I should have stayed away! After being seated and given menus at least 10 minutes passed before we were given water and another 10 minutes before we  were asked  if we were ready to order.

A few more spoonfuls and I bit at least 2 big hunks of garlic. NOT good. It was brimming with tofu and straw mushrooms and looked good, but unfortunately it was mediocre at best. \\nNext came out luncheon plates. I ordered shrimp with lobster sauce and pork fried rice. My rice was OK, but had a weird smoky after taste. The  Shrimp with lobster sauce contained 2 shriveled shrimp and  the most SALTY ( and I mean salty) lobster sauce I have ever had. It was like they emptied a salt shaker into my food., It was inedible. \\nHubby fared a little better with boiled rice and General Goa's chicken.

A regular sized burger is pretty large so you may want to opt for the 'little' one.  Fries are above par for fast food restaurants...you get to choose between 'cajun' or regular (get the cajun).  A regular is enough fries for two people.  Eating peanuts and leaving a mess on your table is one of the 'perks' (maybe it'll remind some of you of the Ground Round).

Here's why: as others mention in reviews inside the decor is lovely and classy but the service, as others also mentioned, was confusing. The place smells amazing when you first walk in. The host had us order directly at the host stand and as I was their for lunch so I chose the Biriyani special. But we were never seated with a menu and allowed time to really look at the menus options. From what I did see while standing awkwardly in the entry way reading the menu I was disappointed to see for the biriyani while there were two chicken and a vegetarian option the other option was goat- not lamb like I'm used to but I thought I'd give it a shot. The host told us to have a seat and my friend and I were the only ones in the dining room. The table we chose by the window was not fully set and I was never brought silver ware so I ended up just taking it from another empty table. The food arrived in a reasonable amount of time and smelled lovely still but I was surprised it was served on a sort of low class looking plastic lunch tray with little compartments to keep all the different parts separately. Practical I suppose, tho not visually appealing. The server didn't explain any of the food to us and since I didn't have menu to reference again I assume I had some sort of seasoned potato side, two sauce options that I expected with biriyani, a mystery veggie and a little doughy dessert along with the goat and rice. Everything was seasoned amazing and the flavors were great but I was again disappointed the goat had seemingly none of the fat trimmed from it so there were a lot of unedible chewy bits and I had two HUGE bones lumped in with other nonsensically cut 6 inch long sliver pieces of goat. Plus since all I had was a butter knife it wasn't exactly easy to cut things into manageable bite sizes or cut off the unpleasant parts. Once we were done we also were left confused at the table and never told to again go back to the host stand to pay, rather than them bringing the check. We figured it out after sitting awkwardly for a while. Our server really never checked on us other than a few water refills and they never asked how our meal was until the very end (like 30 minutes after it was given to us) nor did they offer a box or the check. So- food was generally good (other than I wish it were lamb and they need to better butcher their goat), ambience lovely, customer service was lacking- tho everyone was polite, albeit not attentive.

Since then, I've had the Chicken & Avocado Sandwich and the Thai Burrito, which were equally fabulous. Of these, I think my favorite is the Thai Burrito - a delicious combination of chicken, veggies, brown rice, and peanut sauce. But really, everything I have (minus that one sad trip many years ago) had been fantastic. \\n\\nI've been to both the Clintonville location and the Short North one - both locations seem similar though the Clintonville location seems larger and works better for a big group. I prefer this one for a couple reasons:\\n1. Like someone mentioned below, the patio is larger and more comfortable to sit at.\\n2. Jeni's is next door. Not saying I always go there afterward...just sayin'.\\n3. I live nearby so I'm biased.\\n\\nOverall, I think Northstar is a good place to go if you have groups of people, especially if they have varied dietary needs.

There is a male server there that is a bit, well, socially awkward but he generally gets the job done adequately. Unfortunately, I will never go here again.\\n\\nWe had gone here a couple of times before (my partner really likes/liked it), so when we saw a Groupon Now deal for this a few months ago we bought it. We told them that we had the Groupon at the start of the meal. When it came time to pay the bill my phone was having problems displaying the barcode number (I don't have a data plan, which hasn't been an issue in the past I just load it up ahead of time, but this time I couldn't reload the page to fix the display issue). The waiter said a number of times that I must not have paid for it and I assured him that yes I had, I just didn't have a data plan so I was having problems bringing up the Groupon. I was pretty flustered at this point, so he left to give me time to figure it out. Imagine my surprise when I overheard him tell another staff member (in a fairly loud voice) that someone hadn't paid for their Groupon and that they were \\"scammers\\".\\n\\nMy partner (who has a data plan) was able to install the Groupon app onto his phone and log in to my account. So when the server came back we were able to redeem it just fine. The server did not apologise, he just said \\"Oh so I guess if someone else has this problem we can give them the password to our wireless.\\" \\n\\nThe comment he made was totally unprofessional and it is ridiculous that he made it anywhere near the hearing range of a customer. While I didn't expect him to apologise for his comment, which he didn't know we had overheard (I really should have said something but I was so angry that I was pretty tight-lipped by the time he came back), I did expect an apology for being so very unhelpful and not listening to what I was saying.

I thought the Ultimate Omelet would have the varying meats (chicken, ham, sausage) IN the omelet, but they were piled on top of it. The omelet itself was delicious and had a ton of saut√©ed spinach and other fresh veggies. They gave A LOT of food for a very low price. Even though I was starving when I went in, I couldn't finish my meal at once and had to save it for later.\\n\\nI was curious about the pancakes and tried them- they weren't that great. Definitely NOT something I would get again or recommend. I felt they just covered them with butter and was a little sickened by the thought. If you're going to coat something in butter, then at least make it taste good enough to not let the patron think about how unhealthy it is. I know they were busy when I went in, but I distinctly said sausage for the meat. I ended up with bacon. I'm not a big fan of bacon, but it wasn't that big of a mix up for me to never go back there again.\\n\\nThe sole waitress that I ordered from was clearly frazzled by all the customers, but did not snap at me or rush me out the door.

They also have a great selection of wines that are reasonably priced and the hard liquors I so often crave.  The flatbreads are all decent to good, but definitely nothing amazing or special in anyway.  Whomever created some of the flatbreads had to have not been too experienced in the culinary arts.  For instance, the steak and blue cheese flat bread is covered in balsamic glaze.  Everyone in my party who tried it agreed that the balsamic drenching turned what would have been a decent flat bread into a mediocre one.  Also, the quality of the steak on it was clearly not good.  It actually tasted like taco bell meat.  \\n\\nThe Morrocan flat bread is decent.  It comes with curried chicken, cheese, and peppers.  But, definitely not amazing.  Nothing that I've tried in the past on the menu is amazing, just a decent and relatively cheap way to eat light.

There was that slightly stinky fishy smell when you first walk in, which had me concerned at first, but it didn't seem to linger long.  The waiter was quick, pleasant, and refilled our water glasses throughout dinner before a quarter of it was drank.  We split Spicey Tuna Maki, Crazy Maki, California Maki, and Salmon Monster Jr Maki.  All four were very tastey.  The tempura flakes, which had a lighter, sweeter consistency than most other sushi place I've been to, made the rolls especially delicious.  The decor is modern and trendy, with large close up flower prints serving as the wall decorations, and a small green laser design flashing in one corner, giving it a slightly fun/techno feel without being obnoxious or distracting.  We sat between a couple on their first date, a six-person dinner party with a newborn baby, and a mom and dad with their daughter.

My salad was fine, not great. My favorite part about it was the fish sauce based dressing, which was so good that I was drinking it out of the container. However, the quality of the lettuce in my salad was pretty sub-par, and the tofu was not spicy at all, in fact it was relatively tasteless.

It's only separated by a black curtain, so some of the noise still comes through, but it's not distracting and gets covered by the music.  I get that this is a speakeasy vibe, but it's honestly too dark to even read the menu.  My wife had to put the candle on her menu and I saw another table pull out the flashlight on their cell phone (phones are not allowed according to the sign).\\n\\nTo start, I ordered a martini and my wife had wine.  The cocktail glass was not kept in a cooler.  No big deal, but many bartenders will add ice and water to pre-chill the glass before pouring the cocktail.  That didn't happen, which results in a luke warm drink.  Also had to ask for a twist.  No garnish was given or offered.\\n\\nThe rolls and butter that arrived before the meal were delicious.  Tasted a bit like cornbread.  We both ordered steaks and a couple of sides to share.  My steak was cooked perfectly, although the chef had a heavy hand on the salt.  My wife said her steak was cold and had too much pepper, so there seems to be some inconsistency with the seasoning.  I didn't detect any pepper on mine and we got the same cut.\\n\\nSides were disappointing.  The sauteed mushrooms were just chopped button mushrooms.  Not much flavor here.  The creamy spinach was exactly that, spinach with cream poured on top.  When I'm at a steakhouse and see creamy spinach, I assume this will be creamed spinach - rich and full of fat and cheese, not a soupy bowl of spinach.  Not great.\\n\\nOverall, I just didn't feel like this lived up to the reviews I had read.  It's not the most expensive place for a steak, but it is not cheap either.  For the price we paid, I expected more.

Nowhere on the description for this item did it state \\"pesto\\" but after waiting 25 min for our food my \\"salad\\" came out with a giant blob of burrata (which was delicious), two slices of tomato, and a glob of pesto underneath all of this. Unfortunately I am allergic to pesto but instead of waiting another 25 minutes just for them to scrape the pesto off the bottom of the plate I decided to eat around it. Also on top of the burrata was a toothpick with about 4-5 pieces of \\"rocket\\" in an absolutely delicious dressing. The description on the menu DID state there was rockets so naturally I imagined more than a couple pieces toothpicked onto the cheese, it definitely left me wanting more since i thought i ordered a salad...As for the salmon it was delicious and a good portion. That was until I got about 4 bites in and realized the middle was nearly raw! I was one to believe that you can't really screw up salmon, but how does that happen!? Again, i had already eaten half of it from the ends and really didn't feel like waiting for another to come out so i left half of it. If you're going to cook the salmon rare you should at least inform your guests so they can choose the temperature. Just so disappointed I paid $20 at lunch for a salad with 4 greens, 2 slices of tomato, pesto I had to eat around & half of a raw piece of salmon. \\n\\nIf you're at the north shore mall and want delicious food go to Burton's instead, they hit the nail on the head every time."},{"name":"Chipotle Mexican Grill","address":"101 Summer St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"It is definitely nice to have a Chipotle downtown, and this location gets the job done.

The chilis are good, the pork is good, but the tongue taco with lots of the green sauce is where it's at.  It's just good.  Why are there not more of these?

The reason for the three stars is that while it's dirt cheap to eat here, it's not always the highest quality and the sushi isn't always prepped correctly (cut wrong). Still, for the price you can't really beat it. If you want simple rolls, you're looking at a couple bucks for 3 maki.

If someone like me with a steady job finds it out of my budget to go with the healthy take-out option more often than once every few weeks, how can we expect those without the luxury of discretionary cash to go anywhere but straight to the drive through?

They did accommodate to sit is early which was nice.\\n\\nAfter being sat down, our server comes by about 5 minutes later. He doesn't introduce himself or ask if we are first time diners to orient us to the menu instead just ask for drinks (which was fine because he was nice enough). My husband asked about different wines and the server made a recommendation for a sparkling rose not on the menu. My husband agreed, about 5 minutes later the server just came back with my glass and empty handed for my husband. He apologized and said they only had one bottle or something. We proceeded to order, we start by asking for their house bread. Immediately the server tells us they are out of bread... I've never heard of this happening before, how does a restaurant run out of bread. I can appreciate them ordering bread responsibily to prevent food waste, but this was still early in the night! I'm also bitter because this was going to be my only source of carbs since we didn't want to order pizza or pasta.\\n\\nWhy we didn't want to order pizza or pasta? The pizza was small and about $20+ per pie. Not that we're cheap , but just hardly seemed worth it. Plus they all (minus one pizza) had meat and my husband doesn't eat meat. The same goes for pasta, which my husband was really upset about (that they all had meat.\\n\\nHe ended up just ordering a salad and I ordered expensive skirt steak ($36) that wasn't even that good or flavorful. Also they didn't even ask me how I wanted it cooked. Thankfully I wanted it medium rare.\\n\\nAfter we ordered we just about never saw our server again and barely were asked to see how we were doing. At this point it wasn't that busy, I was shocked at how poor the service was. Lastly, it is so loud in the restaurant.

It's a hole in the wall. I'm not going to go as far as calling it a \\"shack,\\" but it almost feels like one. This is more of a quick lunch or take-out place than it is a restaurant to sit down and enjoy a meal. I like it because it's akin to Israeli street food. The kitchen prepares many of its ingredients daily, including their own taboon bread.\\n\\nThe restaurant is on the La Vista side of the shopping center, facing Whole Foods. It's in a small corner spot. They've crammed a lot of tables into the limited space and there's some covered seating outside. During peak periods, parking can get tight so you may have to park around the corner and walk over.\\n\\nPita Palace has chicken shawarmas (freshly shaved off the spit), falafel (made of ground chickpeas), schnitzel (breaded chicken), pargiot (dark meat cornish hen), white meat grilled chicken, seasoned beef kabobs, hamburgers, and veggie pitas. You can order the falafel and meats in various forms, e.g. inside a pita pocket or wrapped in laffa (taboon bread). The laffa wraps are quite big, significantly bigger than the pita pockets. They are comparable in size to a Mission-style burrito (such as Moe's or Chipotle). It's a lot of meat/food.\\n\\nPitas run about $7-10 each, laffas run about $8-13 each. If you don't want a pita or laffa, you can have the meat served on a baguette, in a salad, on as an entree (double meat, for roughly $15) with salad bar items.\\n\\nI recommend ordering the laffa because taboon bread can be hard to find in Atlanta, especially freshly-made taboon bread. Taboon is made out of chickpea flour and is traditionally used as a flatbread wrap in Jewish cuisine. It's soft and slightly spongy.\\n\\nThere's a self-serve salad bar that is used by both customers and staff. The salad bar has hummus (chickpea spread), baba ghanoush (eggplant spread), spicy sauces (jalapeno, habanero), Israeli salad (tomatoes and cucumbers), pickles, red cabbage, coleslaw, pita chips, fried eggplant, sauerkraut, and other items. The salad bar is included with most orders.\\n\\nIf you order a sandwich/wrap, the staff will use ingredients from the salad bar, Subway-style, to customize your order. I like to load my laffa wraps with lots of stuff: hummus, baba ghanoush, Israeli salad, red cabbage, pickles, and slaw. They also have sauces in squeeze bottles, such as tzatziki yogurt sauce. It is good stuff. Don't put too many sauces/spreads inside or your meal will get messy towards the end.\\n\\nThe meats I suggest ordering are the shawarma, pargiot, and beef kabobs. You can see the chicken shawarma rotating on a spit behind the counter. I think this is their most popular meat and it's not uncommon to see it completely gone by the end of the day. The shawarma and the pargiot, both marinated chicken, taste somewhat similar. However, the shawarma chicken meat is sliced thin while the pargiot chicken meat is chopped into small chunks. Either way, you can't go wrong. The beef kabobs are delicious. The beef patties are nicely seasoned with onions and spices and are flavorful and satisfying. I think the meat portions are generous.\\n\\nOverall, I have found the ingredients to be sufficiently fresh and the wraps to be tasty and filling.\\n\\nService is good.\\n\\nBottled water and soft drinks are available in a fridge. If you want tap water, you have to get it yourself from a bathroom-looking sink that is oddly placed in the short hallway leading to the lone restroom. Funny enough, it's not the first time I've seen something like that."},{"name":"Gigi's Cafe","address":"6320 SW Capitol Hwy","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"The food is fine.

I glanced at the typical Chinese take-out menu, ordered pork fried rice and a can of Mountain Dew, and looked for a table.  The place was empty so I had my choice.  \\n\\nEvery table was coated with an emulsion of grease and I'm pretty sure that type of film comes only from \\"cleaning\\" with a none-too-clean rag.  I'm not, however, sure what dribbled down the front of the trash can before it hardened into a crust.  Maybe I'm better off not knowing.  The sun-bleached magazines piled on the windowsill added a touch more ambiance.\\n\\nThe rice came about two minutes after I sat down.  It was drowned in so much soy sauce, it was nearly black, and after a couple of forkfuls, it reminded me of why, when we were children, my mother, great cook that she was, poured buckets of catsup over everything: without all the soy sauce, there was no way that rice would have made it from my mouth to my throat to wherever the hell else it goes before it comes out the other end.  The rice kernels were so hard and so dry, I wondered if they'd been cooked.  But they had a real nice soy sauce flavor.  I guess that microscopic cube of pork enabled the chef to call it \\"pork\\" fried rice instead of just \\"fried rice.\\"  \\n\\nBut the can of Mountain Dew was excellent, so an extra star just for that, and for the box for empty cans thoughtfully provided by the proprietor.  It's always nice to be charged the redemption value and have the seller ask for the can back.

There were 6 of us and overall it was a decent experience. Their restaurant week menu absolutely sucks and I am sure they will tweak it should they participate again. Most restaurants give you multiple choices per course, however they only give you 1 option per course. The food is served family style, so this menu didn't work for a a bigger group.\\n\\nThe regular menu falls in line with a traditional italian menu... primi, secondi, etc. However, they do also have a separate section that is more tapas style where you order by the bite. For instance, 1 fried ravioli is $2 and so in order for our table to all try it, we had to order 6 of those. Overall the food was good, the only thing I would not order again would be the roasted pumpkin, it was dry and bland. High lights of the meal were the ravioli, Grissini, and the pork meatballs.\\n\\nThe service was excellent and the food was served quickly throughout our meal. Only knock is that we waited 15 minutes for our table passed our reservation time. They have an extensive wine list and it is priced on the high end. We didn't order by the bottle, because we were all drinking different types. The cheapest glass was probably $8, but most were priced around $10-$12.\\n\\nThey have a ways to go and I am sure their menu will change over time.

This was my staple meal all through college and it was sweetly nostalgic to have it again, and done well.  Husband got the fish sandwich - again, nothing too challenging but delivered what it promised - fresh fried fish in a bun with savory fries on the side.\\n\\nSome things weren't so great, though.

Not enough bark overall for my taste. Of the options, the pulled pork is the best. The brisket has so much fat it has a wet and greasy mouthfeel, which is decidedly unpleasant. The burnt ends are a little better. Chicken is decent.\\nThe biscuits are most notable for coming with a fantastic honey butter. In and of themselves they are pretty good too. Note that they are huge, a basket of 4 could serve 6 easily. \\nThe sides are decent - my favorites are the broccoli cheese casserole, baked beans, collards, and the mac and cheese. If you're not into the meat you can order the lunch lady tray, which consists only of 4 sides (hot or cold). A bucket of biscuits and a lunch lady tray is an excellent value. \\nThe sweet tea passes muster with my picky Southern wife, which is saying something. The cocktails here range from fair to terrible. Beer selection is solid but uninspiring.\\nFor all that, I come here pretty often, because it's close by, the atmosphere is great for groups of pretty much any size, and the service is excellent.

I strongly recommend trying the sausage, egg and cheese sandwich, even now, thousands of miles away, I can picture the buttered bread collapsing around the hot cheesy links and the delicious scrambled egg inside.  The eggs benedict is also real good, and sometimes I skip breakfast and go straight for the cheeseburger, which is actually a patty melt!\\n\\nService is a cut above most Cambridge restaurants.  They are pretty much run by one family, the children, polite and friendly serve and wash the dishes, the father, as many men now do, is in charge of cooking, and the matriarch runs the show.  She is very friendly, but as the boss she has no time for shenanigans or people keeping the door open when there is a blizzard outside.

It is across the street from the Middle East and T.T. the Bears or whatever that place is called, and it is always fun to get one of the window booths and watch the different types of musical groups getting setup for the night ahead.  \\n\\nThe clientele is a more or less inoffensive cross-section of central square's rising star.  You might see more people you know than you'd expect for such a small place, but if any particularly unsavory characters from your past appears in the booth next to you, well take another bite of your sausage, egg and cheese sandwich and forget about them.  There must be quite a few harvard and mit students since the place was significantly less crowded when the students were out on break.  \\n\\nTiming is the one thing that sucks about his place.  They don't open until 8:30am, so if you work, you can't eat there during the week.

You see, my family and I booked an overnight stay at The Gaylord Palm hotel, in Kissimmee; and, a stay for us wouldn't be complete without a visit to Old Hickory.  Of course, I picked Thanksgiving evening to dine there, which turned out to be better than the buffet restaurant, which was booked to overflowing, even to taking over the lobby!\\n\\nWe arrived shortly before our reserved time of 6:45 PM; and, were told we would be notified as the reservation time approached. Unfortunately, it took two people to tell us that as the first woman to greet us was not fluent in English; and, could barely communicate our status.  The other lady who jumped in to help logged us in on the iPad; and, I informed her we would wait in the bar.\\n\\nOur bar visit was superb, with excellent service and drinks provided by Alena, our server.  We were expecting to be seated rather quickly, so we went ahead and cashed-out as soon as our drinks were delivered - an excellent Negroni for me; and, a creative ginger beer concoction with Oriental Five Spice for my wife.\\n\\nAfter nearly an hour; and, a few visits to the host stand, I met with Benjamin, the manager, who assured me they were running 30-to-45 minutes behind; and, he was seating 6:15 reservations when ours was yet another half hour away!  Had we been told the wait would be up to an hour after our reservation time, we would have lingered in the bar.  \\n\\nHowever, the arrival of a large group, including two large hound dogs (not service dogs) made it necessary for us to vacate the bar.  I have allergies and am immune-suppressive, so I don't mix with strange animals.  I know the hotel is pet-friendly; but, two large dogs like that just do not belong in an area where people are eating!\\n\\nSo, we camped out by the host stand; and, were seated almost immediately...  Abdel was a phenomenal server, as have been all of our servers at Old Hickory.  We've dined here on many occasions, usually around Christmas, Mothers' Day, a birthday or anniversary.  \\n\\nSo here's the rub; when we were escorted back to our dining room, there was only one other table already seated, there were at least 5 tables vacant.  Through our entire dining experience, two tables remained completely empty... I know there are allowances for pacing; and, kitchen capacity, etc.  But, to put people out of their promised time by almost an hour seems unreasonable, when there are tables available.\\n\\nSo, we ordered three Thanksgiving Dinners at $75 each; and, everything was delicious - the Pumpkin Soup was incredible, the Squash Salad too!  In fact, I upgraded for $10 more just to try both!  We also ordered a bottle of Orin Swift \\"F\\" to go with our meal; and, an extra dessert of the Chocolate Souffle for our daughter.  With cocktails, appetizers, mains, dessert and win, including tip, the total worked out to almost $150 per-person.  That's a pretty steep price for any meal.  \\n\\nWe enjoyed unparalleled food quality and creativity; we had great service; but, the miscommunication, the lack of experience, and the wait just detracted from it.  And, the price is high, higher than other comparable steakhouses in Central Florida.  So, 3-Stars on this visit."},{"name":"BJ's Restaurant & Brewhouse","address":"1414 Polaris Pkwy","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"Why still serve pizza but drop calzones? Why drop pot roast?

I've heard mixed reviews of Frank's over the years and have often wondered if the restaurant's popularity is due to its nostalgic factor or if the food is truly something special. \\n\\nThe interior was as expected. A timeless style accentuated by dark wood trim throughout the dimly lit dining area. A lounge area is separated by a half wall and frosted glass dividers. I heard they once had a piano player for live entertainment, but this unfortunately has been discontinued. I think the live piano would be a nice addition to the atmosphere. \\n\\nBread is served in a small square shape apparently meant to be shared by all at the table. We found it rather difficult to split the tiny loaf that was more suitable for a family of mice and we each ended up with a small piece of bread. They will, however, bring more bread upon request. \\n\\nThree and a half shiny stars for the food at Frank's tonight. My steak tips were cooked on point with my grilling standards - perfectly medium with a very visible pink center and just the right amount of char on the outside. The bbq marinade has a decent flavor, but it took me a couple bites to decide if I actually liked it. I chose the saut√©ed mushrooms and mashed potatoes for my sides. I was pleased with the generous portion of mushrooms and I've never met a mashed potato I didn't like. Now, this was by no means one of the top steaks I have ever had or even close, but I enjoyed my meal tonight and it really hit the spot. Also, it was a reasonably priced meal for its quality and portion size. \\n\\nThe service on the other hand missed the mark for me. We had a wonderful server. I wish I could remember his name, but he did tell us he has only been working at Frank's for a couple of weeks. He was very helpful and attentive.  Unfortunately service tonight was painfully slow although the restaurant was not overly busy. Our server apologized for the wait which justified it was not simply our raging appetites leading us to believe the kitchen was underperforming. The food was indeed taking too long. We also had a ten minute wait for a table upon arrival although the restaurant was more than half empty. \\n\\nMy Frank's wrap -up: Good food, the new waiter is a real asset to the restaurant, slow service, decent atmosphere, bread too small, bring back the piano.

If you're not feeling yolky, get the breakfast chicken sandwich with hot sauce, all of which will fill you up quite well.\\n\\nI didn't get to try any of their sweet stuff, aside from the toast with homemade jam. If the rest of their sweets are like that, then its certainly worth a try.\\n\\nFor the most part, if you don't want to spend $40-50 for brunch for 2 at Cafe Luna, Brookline Lunch is certainly worth a shot.

GO.\\nIf you want the full version, read on...\\n\\nI've lost count of how many times I've been here for brunch with b. We went here for dinner once; while the ambiance at night is cool for drinks and hanging out, dinner was rather forgettable. We've only been back for brunch since then because the first brunch experience was one of the best we've had in Boston. While recent visits have been a little shaky (change in the kitchen?), we can usually depend on this place for something delicious to fill our tummies. They have a pretty small brunch menu but all you really need to get is this:\\n\\n1. Share a Scotch Egg. Or not and just get your own. It's a hardboiled egg wrapped in crispy sausage! What more could you want? The mustard that it's served with is like strong-wasabi-up-your-nose-hot. I hate the feeling but I go back for more. (Is this what addiction is like?)\\n\\n2. Smoked Fish Cakes. It's like an eggs benedict but with smoked haddock and potato cakes instead of English muffins. And it's served with a brightly colored cherry pepper hollandaise sauce, which is lighter than the usual hollandaise.\\n\\n3. Toffee French Toast. A thick brioche bread with toffee sauce (YUM!), blueberries, and maple whipped cream. We swore that the size and thickness of the french toast was increasing every time we ordered it. It was getting monstrous! But when we got it this past Saturday, it had shrunk down to a more manageable (but still very filling) size. One of my favorite french toasts among the ones I have tried in brunches around Boston.\\n\\nService is usually pretty prompt and friendly. There was one guy who served us a couple of times before (seemed to be a manager or some sort?), who was courteous but never smiled. The owner, however, is super friendly and wears a kilt!

The first real 70+ degree day in PDX, and so I met my friends outside on the patio. \\n\\nFirst thing I noticed was the large tap menu.  Sweet!  I decided to have three different kinds of beer.  The first was a Spaten lager, which never disappoints (well, unless you get it in an import-only green bottle...skunk!) The second was an imperial stout that was absolutely delicious, and the third was the a hefeweizen, which was nice, given that it was a true hefe rather than an American wheat beer.  Just as a note, true hefeweizens have a banana/clove note to them.\\n\\nWhile enjoying my beer, I got an order of the Belgian fries.  These were really well made, and I could have eaten them all night.  We also ordered some of the sausage bites, but those were a bit tepid, which isn't a good temperature.  They should be hot or cold, but tepid makes me wonder about the end result of eating them.  Could get nasty.  For dinner, I had the beer cheese soup, which was really more like a cheese dip...in fact, they serve it with chips.  A bit on the gooey side for beer cheese soup, but the flavors were nice.  I am just not used to eating queso dip with a spoon.\\n\\nThe grounds are a bit industrial, but still very inviting.  Nice view of Grand Central Bowl.  But there was also a smoker outside that was slow cooking some chicken.  The smell added to the ambiance.\\n\\nThe place straddles the 3 and 4 star range, but the service brought it down to three.  As others have noted, the service is a bit slow, and our server, while friendly, was a bit forgetful.  Many times we had to remind her that we had ordered something that had not arrived when she was bringing something else.  She wasn't giving us attitude or not working hard, just forgetful.  Not the best thing when you run out of beer.  This is the same trend you get from McMinnnimmanaimnens, and it's too bad that the trend is spreading to other pubs.\\n\\nWould I go back?

They also have a bunch of fresh ingredients to add on to your salad or pita pockets (lettuce, pickeled turnips, red onion, olives, lettuce, and their own Hubbly Blend, which is a mix of tomato and cucumber) they also have several home made sauces to top off your food with.

The couple next to us, celebrating their anniversary at Yakuza, had to ask us for our water pitcher - as the waitress wasn't paying close attention to them either.  After waiting 20 minutes for the rest of our food, the waitress did bring us an extra plate of Hamachi, telling us literally that the kitchen had made an extra by mistake.  \\n\\nI'm not one to usually complain, but did speak to the manager.

Not the biggest fan of their bubble tea. They use the powders and it definitely comes through in the taste. The boba itself was decent though. I probably would not order this again, with or without the scoutmob deal.\\n\\nThe Seoul burger -- angus beef patty with sesame arugula salad and ssam sauce, was tasty, but nothing special. The ssam sauce tasted like a teriyaki, or maybe diluted hoisin sauce? The salad was refreshing. I'm a big fan of lotus root, and the lotus chips sounded really interesting. While they were good, I didn't get much lotus flavor. It was comparable to a potato chip. The sweet potato/yam fries were done really well. I liked the honey drizzle on top, and unlike Jang C.'s, ours were cooked all the way through.\\n\\nMy friend got the Bulgogi rice bowl. This is probably comparable to bibimbap at a traditional Korean restaurant. There are less mix-in choices though. It only came with carrot/onion shreds, and I believe the same sesame arugula salad. My friend ordered kimchi on the side and I think it made the entire rice bowl way too vinegar-y.

We could not get our server to bring drinks, and he acted like he was doing us some big favor to actually show up at our table.  All 8 of us sat there for over 30 minutes with empty glasses after we were done eating.  We were there to celebrate and wanted more drinks... I'm talking about beer glasses, wine glasses, margarita glasses, and even water glasses.  ALL of them empty for over 30 minutes!!  We could not get any drinks!!!  What a joke.  We all left and went somewhere else to spend our money.  The management at this place is a total joke.  The manager actually came to our table and we loaded him up with all the plates the the terrible server had not bothered to collect...  We had been done with them for a very long time.. but instead of realizing that his server was worthless, he seemed bothered that he had to carry our plates. You would think he would have gotten a hint, but nope..  He seemed oblivious...Many better options in Boulder.  I cannot figure out how this place stays open.\\n\\nTerrible customer service!!

All the way ingredients (pardon the pun) are there for a great Monday night football or Friday dinner out.\\n\\nSo, here's the small issue that I have with Old Chicago at Mall 205, and I do love Old Chicago at Mall 205, but the service is consistently slow.  If you're looking to order food or drinks in the bar area and you're not sitting right on the bar, it takes forever to get the attention of staff and even longer once the order for food or drink is taken.  I have never understood why such a first class, appealing place doesn't put the money into one additional server.  The answer maybe is that they don't have to., because they have a consistent clientele.\\n\\nThat being said....I'd recommend Old Chicago and I'll happily go there.

Not because it's a hole in the wall (I rather like holes), but because he seriously talked about it so much in the past year and a half - and even more today, as he salivated every single time he said \\"Pita Palace\\", which was no less than 800 times. \\n\\nBecause of his over-hype I was fairly prepared to be disappointed. Just being honest. But it was actually really, really good. \\n\\nFirst, the service was spectacular. I don't honestly know how it could have been better. It was friendly and genuine and not rushing. I like that. \\n\\nWe both got the shawarma pita and after I loaded it with pickles, tomatoes, cucumbers and onions it was pretty damn delicious. \\n\\nI also got 2 falafel on the side just so I could try them. Generally I find falafel to be rather flavorless and boring, but after having some super amazing falafel in Chicago a couple weeks ago I have found myself wanting to try then wherever I go.

I don't mean that in a cynical way, as there can be plenty of \\"best bacons\\" in my book... as long as it is meaty, fatty, and savory, I am good to call it amazing.\\n\\nThough I found this local establishment to be cranking out true English grub--there was a family of 4 straight up Brits; very attractive accents, I might add--I was, in the end, a bit disappointed. The menu is full-on straight out of the place from which America became an \\"English\\" speaking country.\\n\\nApparently, they go with Balson's back bacon (the classic English style?) from Atlanta, which originally came out of England in the 1500's. Weird, but cool. It won the Chronicle's \\"Best Bacon\\" category. My only beef (hehe, \\"iron\\"y--hehe, pun\\") is that their is a bit of confusion... the website claims it is North Carolina bacon. Maybe they use North Carolina bacon produced in Atlanta?\\n\\nAnyway, I went with a pastie (don't just Google image pastie before putting on the \\"filter\\") and their pancake+bacon. At $5 and $4.50, respectively, these offerings were quite affordable. Especially since FE is basically a self-service sort of establishment. You will surely find something that you will enjoy here.\\n\\nThe pancake, which is akin to a crepe, does not have the lacy texture of a French crepe, is awesome. It is HUGE and a bit on the savory side of the sweetness spectrum. Just smother it in syrup, and you'll be good to go. The bacon was a bit small, about 2X4. No, not a wooden plank-size piece; those dimensions are in inches. It was savory, meaty, and very similar to country ham. Maybe the whole North Carolina hog claim explains why I felt like I was eating in the South again rather than the FAR East.\\n\\nThe pastie was good and flaky, but inside, my onion and cheese filling boasted very tough potatoes. Additionally, they didn't heat it through well enough. Lastly, the cheese was not really tasted, though I can't claim that I know EXACTLY how a cheese and onion pastie should taste, ratio-wise. But... the onions were not in abundance in number or flavor. Can someone bring me an outrageously good pastie?\\n\\nAll in all, a cool experience, but not something I would run south for everyday. I may just stick to the occasional baked good at the FM for now... until this joint truly gets high accolades."},{"name":"King Fung Garden II","address":"370 Boylston St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3","text":"tonight was the first, and DEFINITELY not last, time we ordered from king fung.  we live right around the corner from one, and down the street from many other, chinese restaurants of various caliber....but after reading the reviews of this one, we were increasingly interested, and we were VERY happy with our choice, and very much agree with all the other reviews, prompt delivery, hot food, flavorful, AMAZING portions...all around delicious...we were [semi-] joking about ordering a second time tonight....yes, folks, its THAT GOOD!"},{"name":"Cactus Club Cafe","address":"1085 Canada Place","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Our server Ellie Kwo was the best server I've ever had she was so nice and cute.

There are a lot of tacos to choose from, something for everyone. On Tuesdays they have $15 unlimited tacos with unlimited chips and salsa as well, which is a fantastic deal.

I was here back when it was Mulberry and I liked it then, but I think I like it even more now. (It's been over a year, wow!)\\n\\nI attended one of their preview nights. The renovation is beautiful and the menu looks awesome. I wasn't in the mood for alcohol and they didn't have a drink menu, so I asked if they had lemonade. I expected some Simply Lemonade to be delivered to me or to be told that they didn't have lemonade. When my lemonade arrived, the waitress told me that it was freshly hand-squeezed lemonade. I could not believe it!!! At work, one of our core values is \\"create delight\\" and the definition of delight is the difference between expectations and reality. They really blew me out of the water on this one and I hadn't eaten anything yet!\\n\\nNow that I've finished fangirling about the lemonade, here's what we ate:\\n\\n1. Snapper crudo: snapper \\"sashimi\\" topped with blood orange and crispy garlic. There are more ingredients on there. Absolutely beautiful presentation! It was a refreshing appetizer with a variety of different flavors which kept my taste buds very excited and pleasantly surprised. You got the taste of snapper and then boom, the citrus juice from the blood orange. Out of nowhere, you get a bit of crispy garlic that throws you over into the saltosphere. What a rollercoaster. I'd go again :)\\n\\n2. BBQ prawns: awwww shiiiiii. Um yes. A thousand times yes. I prefer to eat shells on as the shells soak up a ton of flavor from the jalapeno corn puree. I'm telling you, the juice is in the legs. Some of you may think eating shells is gross, but to each his/her own. I'm just keeping it real here. That puree is life and the bread comes from Easy Tiger so you already know it's bomb. This was my favorite dish.\\n\\n3. Scallops and pork belly: you got your pork belly and your scallops, then some potato strings, smoked maple polenta, and pickled strawberries. I thought this dish was very inventive. The pork belly looked burnt on top, but it didn't taste burnt at all. What is this magical sorcery?! I think a lot of people would like this dish, but it's not for me. I prefer my pork belly cut either in thin slices or diced. I have never enjoyed polenta - texture isn't my issue, just the taste of polenta. I'm sure they made it well though! The pickled strawberry had an interesting flavor profile that just kind of hits you out of nowhere. Potato strings were very good, added a nice light saltiness. My favorite part of the dish were the scallops. They were perfectly cooked and I would eat a whole bowl of them if I could. \\n\\n4. Brownie sundae: this was good. Real good. Nice and comforting, it leaves you in a bit of daze and you just want to curl up and cuddle or something. So, funny thing, I tend to eat my food in sections. I tend to eat items individually rather than mixing up my food and incorporating all of the flavors into one bite. My reasoning is that this allows me to capture the flavor in the item's purest form. However, someone made a good point that the chef probably makes the food intending for all of the flavors to be eaten together. The brownie itself was very fudgy and rich. The coconut creme was super light. It was like a cloud immediately dissipating in your mouth. It had a very subtle coconut flavor to it. Because eating the brownie alone was very rich to the taste, I decided to take my coworker's advice and eat all of the components together. Alright alright, I confess it was amazing. The fried banana ice cream with the brownie and then a bit of berry coulis (berry sauce) and cornflakes on there - the combination was magical. We'll take it one step at a time to reform my section eating behavior though :P\\n\\nOverall, the atmosphere was great. The waitstaff was courteous, explained the dishes, and top notch.

Great library location, btw.\\n\\nDecided to come back one Saturday afternoon while in the area.  I have to say this is definitely the cutest little taco house with a small patio and outdoor picnic table sitting.  The playlist is great, and the music is loud, which put me in a great eating mood.\\n\\nUnfortunately I have to say the food was so-so.  Note that they don't have a liquor license so the drink choices are pop, homemade lemonade, jarritos, coffee and water.  I sure would have loved a margarita on a warm sunny day but it's all good.\\n\\nI ordered the fried cod tacos and the beef shoulder tacos.  Their portions are quite large so I would say 2 tacos per person is sufficient.  These are not the smaller snack size tacos and they do offer a choice of flour or corn tortilla.  I would say that the protein choices were okay, however the additions somewhat lacking.  Definitely needed quite a bit of hot sauce to add to the flavour on top of the shredded iceberg lettuce.\\n\\nMy counterpart ordered the chicken and waffles and it was very disappointing.  First of all, fried chicken ended up being a sad looking small filet of breaded chicken that tasted like they came from a frozen package instead of a full piece of fried real chicken.  I would say it was a hybrid between a chicken finger and a chicken cutlet? The mole sauce tasted like plain chocolate syrup and the waffle (waffle fries? I'm not sure) were meh.  I think maybe they added this on the menu for kids who are picky about what they eat and would only eat something that looks familiar so this is their version of chicken fingers and fries. \\n\\nOverall, I was somewhat disappointed by the food but really enjoyed the venue.  This is definitely an unique  spot in the quiet Dunbar neighborhood, but there are so many other fantastic taco spots in the city that I wouldn't venture all the way out here just to try this restaurant.

Just because I'm scared I'll be let down. I try to go into it with low expectations and secretly hoping to be blown away. I somehow always end up comparing the poke here to the poke in Hawaii and I really shouldn't. \\n\\nGetting to the point. Stopped by here for dinner before a concert. Got here around 545 and there wasn't a line. Since we've never been here before, my husband and I took a little while to peruse the menu and decide what we wanted. We had a couple questions and asked the person at the counter. Not only did she know it was our first time here, she was very short and seemed impatient with us. There wasn't anyone else waiting or else we would've hurried ourselves. Not a great first impression.\\n\\nWe ordered the Keefer and a regular poke bowl with sockeye salmon and ahi tuna. The regular bowl came with either rice or salad and 3 topping choices. My husband being the picky veggie eater just chose to have the wakame and tobiko (+$1). The portion size was good compared to other poke shops. Sauce was nice but looking at other people's orders they really pile on the sauce so ask them to go easy if that's what you prefer. The Keefer bowl had ahi and albacore tuna, avocado, sprouts, wasabi peas and wakame salad. Super delicious! Completely blown away at the combo and amount of food you get. I'd say it's the most affordable of all the places I've been to. Very impressed.\\n\\nIt's not authentic poke but it is very suitable for the demographic! I highly recommend this place if ur craving poke or in the area!"},{"name":"Kadoya Japanese Restaurant","address":"1063 Davie St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"LOVE this place!

I had no love loss for the 75 Caf√©. Sure, the food was fine and affordable, but I refused to give this restaurant my business because the owner treated his staff terribly. Every time I visited this place, I witnessed the most abhorred conduct by one human to another, and I became ashamed of myself for not reaching across the counter and popping that jerk.\\n\\nThe Boars Nest Deli couldn't have been a sharper contrast to the previous den of despair. Designed to resemble a 50's diner, it was bright and cheery compared to 75's dungeon-like d√©cor. In addition, their menu consisted of more than two dozen sandwiches and wraps with a wide variety of quality ingredients. In time, I sampled nearly all of them, but my favorites to this day are the New York Central (corn beef, pastrami, Swiss cheese, sauerkraut, and Russian dressing on rye), The Mumbles Menino (chicken salad, hot peppers, onion, lettuce, tomato, and Russian dressing on a sub roll), The Brusci (cracked pepper turkey, muenster cheese, roasted red peppers, and spicy deli mustard on a sub roll), and The Greek Tycoon (grilled steak tips, cucumbers, feta cheese, tomatoes, onions, green and red peppers, Greek olives, oregano, and special dressing in your choice of tortilla wrap). Though I've never seen anyone order it, there's a joke sandwich on the menu. The A-Rod is full of bologna, plain yellow mustard, and bland American cheese. Yep, that sounds about right. It's like we used to say back on the farm...you can put lipstick on a pig, but it's still a pig...unless its purple lipstick, then it's an A-Rod.\\n\\nAlong with the cold deli sandwiches, there are a variety of hot deli subs, such as meatball, Italian sausage, chicken cutlet, and eggplant or chicken parmesan. Finally, there are salads (for the health conscious consumer) and hot daily lunch specials. Early risers will be happy to know that the Boars Nest is open for breakfast, and serves a range of omelets and breakfast sandwiches. Other than the variety of menu items and the quality of the ingredients, what helped to differentiate the Boars Nest Deli from the 75 Caf√© was the owner. Billy was a salt-of-the-earth type who truly valued his employees and customers. Unfortunately, Billy sold the restaurant in December 2009, and while the menu hasn't changed and the new ownership is equally as nice, the prices have increased just enough to make this restaurant a bit too expensive, in my opinion. A sandwich, salad, or lunch entr√©e with a can of soda often exceeds $10, which is difficult for me to justify spending on a daily basis. Therefore, based on value alone, I cannot give the Boars Nest Deli better than three stars."},{"name":"101 Steak","address":"3621 Vinings Slope SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Yes, yes, and yes! \\n\\nMy husband and I wanted to go out to dinner to celebrate a new client. We chose 101 Steak, because it's near our home and we had never been before. Plus, we really wanted a big ol' hunk of red meat and you gotta go to a steakhouse if you want a good one. So we made a reservation and got spiffed up to go out!\\n\\nBesides the slightly confusing walk from the parking deck to the front door, EVERYTHING was fantastic. I don't use that term loosely either. \\n\\nThe greeting from the lovely hostess and the General Manager at the front door was friendly. We immediately noticed that the lighting was pretty much perfect. For some reason we're both lighting dorks -- truly it can impact our experience if it's too bright or too dark, or if there are big holes in the lighting. But the lighting here is wonderfully even and at the perfect level.\\n\\nWe were seated at a banquette deuce and greeted by our server Cory. He's one of those guys you can tell has been in the business for years and he's great at what he does. I mean, the service was perfect in every way. He's knowledgable about the menu items, he will offer an opinion, and he was happy to decant our wine and engage us in conversation. (We're pretty chatty diners)\\n\\nThe food -- THE FOOD!! We shared a Caesar salad (sans the anchovies) as our first, and we each got the 8-ounce filet. I added Bernaise to mine, which came on the side and was lovely. Very eggy, rich and just the right amount of tarragon for my taste. We each cut our filet down the middle and set half aside to take home. It took everything I had not to eat the entire thing, but I knew I'd regret stuffing myself, so I was a warrior and I only ate half. It was tender, cooked perfectly mid-rare and was wonderful paired with the sides we chose.\\n\\nAnd OMG the sides! First of all the portions on the sides are huge and we ended up both eating some with our meal and we had enough to take home for an entire second meal! We chose mushrooms to go with our steaks which was a great call, and the roasted brussels sprouts which came bathed in a heavenly ginger-soy glaze with sesame seeds. Note that we're serious brussels sprouts eaters -- as in we almost always order them out and we roast them regularly at home -- and these could be the best ones we've ever had.\\n\\nWe shared a bottle of our own wine that we brought (corkage is $25) and enjoyed our celebratory dinner with not ONE issue large or small to remark on.

I grew up in this town and I've been going here for years, and I persist in having some sort of nostalgic attachment to it, but...it's terrible. Let's face it.\\n\\nFOOD. They sell meat, which is of indifferent quality (on our last visit, my husband's strip steak was so dry and chalky even at medium-rare that I almost preferred my own almost turned-tasting porkchop). They also sell vegetables, mostly of the potato variety. On this same visit, we left a baked potato uneaten, it was so shriveled and over-microwaved and sad. People, I do not leave potatoes uneaten. It really went against the grain. But it had to be done. You know what else we left mostly uneaten? The side of mushrooms. THEY WERE SAUTEED WHOLE. No one even bothered to trim the shrivelly ends of the stems. They also didn't bother to cook them all the way through, or with any seasonings. Mmm, mostly raw, unseasoned button mushrooms! My favorite!\\n\\nAlso uneaten, the side of applesauce served with my porkchop (itself in a sickly-sweet maple bourbon glaze; I should have known better). My husband tasted the applesauce because he didn't believe my rather florid description of how bad it was, but then he spit his bite out, soooo....I did polish off the mashed potatoes; they were mostly butter and pretty delicious. They also now serve salads that have actual green things in them, not just iceberg, so that's cool.\\n\\nAMBIENCE: This is an authentically old-school, dim-lit, vinyl-upholstered sort of steak house. I do not hold this against them. \\n\\nSERVICE: The service may best be described as \\"diner-like\\". I also don't hold this against them. What I DO hold against them is that after we went, they **canceled our OpenTable reservation** so they wouldn't have to pay the table fee on us.

The stories I have about this particular place are numerous; but I'll stick with my favorites.\\n\\nMy first date with Jennifer was really laid back. She had responded to my ad on Craigslist (we are not ashamed to admit it) and after I sorted through the crazies we talked for three weeks and then decided it was time to meet in person. Austin Java provided a relaxed atmosphere where the conversation and the food blended into warm jittery feelings, and just a little twinkle in our eyes. Jen had the Gouda bacon burger and I had the blackened tuna sandwich. I asked for the tuna rare and it was perfect.  We eat here regularly so I will now flash forward about two months.\\n\\nSo now we are yet again headed over to Austin Java for lunch. As I approach the restaurant from the south on Lamar I notice something rather cool and very rare in the parking lot. Sitting stately next to the building was a Ferrari Enzo. The car is amazing in person. The near 700 horsepower combined with the formula one style paddles and the shape alone will make even the slightest car guy swoon. The car will set you back roughly $1.5 million but I guess the owner wasn't in the mood for an $80 porterhouse with truffle foam and micro green salad (thanks Marcel) . Jen and I went in to order and then positioned ourselves outside for the usual people watching. We usually get students, families, bicycles whizzing by, etc. I will mention the delicious spinach artichoke dip and the turkey sandwich because there is a food review in here somewhere. I always get mine with the mayo on the side with extra cranberry sauce.\\n\\n Any who, at that time my wife bet me dessert if I could pick out the owner of the Ferrari. I must admit I had already cased the restaurant to see if I could pick him/her out. I was thinking maybe Richard Garriot but I have met him and didn't see him. The bet was serious as my wife was pregnant and the dessert of her choice was important nourishment for the baby. I had my own dessert picked out in my head (stuffed pistolette at Evangeline) because I knew in my mind I could spot this person by his taste in cars and clothes; so I thought. \\n\\nIn and out came the patrons of Austin Java. Hmm.. White t-shirt, giant Afro stuffed under a Megadeath hat and vans.. Not my vote.. Guy in a nice dress shirt, tie, well maybe...Then my wife spoke up and said that's him. My wife exclaimed he is good looking and it looks like he has got a $400 haircut. I peered at the man with neck length blonde- brown hair, jeans, perfectly pressed linen shirt, and yes flip flops. Could she be right? Three seconds later his girl walked out of the door and they headed towards the parking lot. He opened the door of the dazzling red stallion and after securing the passenger door slipped in  the driver door and brought the car to life. Its an amazing sound. If you have been to Austin Java you realize the parking lot is small and after completing a near perfect Austin Powers 9-point turn positioned the car to leave. Once the light changed on Lamar he nudged the car onto the pavement and with a sound that I would describe as trumpets from car heaven took off into the distance. \\n\\nThe moral of this if there is one is that it doesn't matter how much dinero you got. You go where you know your gonna get a great meal. Jen and I will always return to Austin Java; not just for the memories but the great food and atmosphere as well."},{"name":"Wine Bar George - A Restaurant & Bar","address":"1610 Buena Vista Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Very knowledgeable waiter (chris) with great wine recommendations.

One of those gift certificates was to Davide, and it's been waiting patiently for us to use it since August. We've been so busy that it took us until Spring Break to pay them a visit!\\n\\nAs everyone knows, Kitchen Nightmares paid Davide a visit between then and now, as well. I felt really bad watching the show and then going to Davide, because I'm not a creepy fail-voyeur; I'm just a person with a gift certificate. As I predicted, it felt really voyeuristic to be there, and that feeling didn't factor into my review.\\n\\nDavide is about a mile from the Government Center T stop (Green Line), and that's a lot easier to deal with than the Blue or Orange Line stops that are closer. The walk to Davide was beautiful, and we got to take in the glittering waterfront and the excitement of the day before St. Patty's in Boston. It's windy this time of year, so if you plan to walk through the North End, bring a scarf. And if you plan to spend any time in Government Center's T stop, bring a set of earplugs, to combat the screeching trains/buskers.\\n\\nDavide itself was not recommended to us very highly by a local business person back in August; he reported that the food was overpriced, and typical Italian fare. Despite that warning, I forged ahead, and I am glad we did, because I really hope these folks continue to persevere.\\n\\nWe got there around 7:30PM. It is not an accessible venue, to my knowledge, as it is down a flight of stairs (though the women's bathroom is wheelchair accessible). There was no host there to greet us. It took a full minute before anyone acknowledged us. The person who acknowledged us was Anthony, one of the owners, and he was warm and cordial. They (he) did ultimately seat us in an excellent corner booth. The booths are these demi-lune cuddle cups that are just perfect for a romantic evening; I could have fallen asleep on my beloved's shoulder, it was that comfortable. The d√©cor is definitely up-to-date, and I was particularly interested in the new light sconces GR brought in (the sconces are sawed and spraypainted plexiglass that were then etched through the paint - a cool effect). The restaurant is actually pretty big once you get inside; there are three separate rooms/spaces, and a full bar.\\n\\nIt is restaurant week (week two, in fact) in Boston, and yet I was pleased to see that maybe only half of the diners I overheard were asking for the prix fixe menu. We asked for the full menu, as well. There was a good, full assortment of appetizers, and I only regret that we weren't hungry enough to eat a bunch of them, particularly the eight million kinds of bruschetta.\\n\\nThe water server did that pushy thing where he tried to make tap water sound like dog shit so we'd feel embarrassed and buy something better. Needless to say, I didn't subsequently order drinks. The bread was spongy and moist, and rather than butter, it came with a small bowl of olive oil that had basil in it (very green and springy). \\n\\nOur server knew everything about the menu. This was very helpful and we certainly took her suggestions under advisement. We ordered the pappardelle (short ribs and ribbon-thick pasta) and the cacciucco (clams, mussels, shrimp, and cod in a saffron-tomato broth). Both dishes were quite good. I think we were both surprised that the pappardelle didn't have more short ribs involved in it, but the thick pasta appeared hand-cut, and, though stuck in clumps, tasted nice. It was pleasantly filling. The cacciucco was a heaping bowl of awesome, and an empty bowl of win. The cod pleasantly reminded me of baccala, and the (two) shrimp were shelled (bonus for me). The mussels and clams were small but fresh, and their shells were all open wide when they arrived, and when I plucked each of them out. The crusty bread slice that came with it was absolutely necessary to my ability to soak up all the juicy, saffrony, tomatoey fish bits at the end, and I made absolutely no pretense of hiding my actions. It was the kind of dish that you like more and more the more you eat. I found a few bits of shell and a cod bone in the dish, but since I didn't crack a tooth, I focused on the excellent flavor.\\n\\nAfter we ate, I must be honest, the tiramisu upselling was really annoying. I don't know if it was the server's personality, or whether that's an encouraged thing, but it was off-putting. Our server did, however, check in the kitchen for us to find out if there was enough cheese variety (because there was a big gathering there yesterday, and they'd served lots of cheese). There was, and so we were able to order the cheese plate. \\n\\nTheir cheese plate is phenomenal! Pecorino romano, balsamic-drizzled parmigiana reggiano, and fontina served with green olives, and *house-made apricot compote*. Oh yes. Yes yes yes. YES!"},{"name":"Kobe Japanese Steakhouse - Orlando","address":"5605 S Kirkman Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Hibachi style cooking.  Friendly staff, quality food and fair prices.

I went once with a group of just 4, but the other times with groups of 8-10.  Their food is usually pretty solid - from the tapas menu i'm always sure to get their mussles, because you get a huge bowl of em for not too much $$$.\\n\\nThis most recent trip i went with 9 others for their \\"appetite stimulus\\" menu - a $16 3-course meal.  They rotate their appetite stimulus menu on a weekly basis, but just cuz it's a tapas place doesn't mean their portion sizes for the 3-course meal are small!  I had a fantastic mushroom and fennel soup, which was much larger than i was expecting, and easily would have been a $5-$8 bowl.  I then got the steak entree which had a large portion size and was cooked perfectly - I probably would have paid $12 for that plate alone.  The dessert I chose was an oreo crumb bar dessert with dulce de lece, bananas, and whipped cream.  Also easily a dessert of $6-$8 value, I was so full at this point I couldn't even finish the dessert (rare for me).\\n\\nAll this for $16, plus specials on drinks too - $6.50 sweet margaritas, $6.50 wine flight of 3 wines in either red or white, and you can't go wrong with a pitcher of sangria!\\n\\nSo why only 4 stars, you ask?  Our server was kind of lame.  Though mostly attentive and relatively quick and I'm sure serving in such close quarters is a challenge, she would hand off hot plates to us (tho she'd warn us it was hot, it was really a little too hot for us to be handed off), when one of my dining companions asked what ingredients were in the succotash she was told it was \\"just corn,\\" and when it was brought to her it had other ingredients, one of which she was allergic to, so had to send it back.

I feel like they still use a large amount of preserved ginger to mask the lack of depth. As for the pork, they give you quite a big piece of pork belly, but the meat itself is flavorless, which just makes it a very flabby... icky affair when you have to eat it. The noodles are not cooked evenly(some parts are clumped uncooked) and do not give that characteristic \\"bounce\\" that you get when you bite into the noodles. I went to try the new ramen multiple times, and the quality stayed consistent.\\n\\n//Dinner: 4/5 stars\\nMusashino offers some unique options that I feel like you can't get anywhere else in Austin, the thing I feel like some options are drastically overpriced (ex. katsu curry for 16$). Their grilled fish items on the menu (cod, bass, salmon) are fantastic choices, and are as good as most izakayas that I've been to. The fried softshell crab app is a nice choice, as well as the fried shrimp that comes with it's tail raw, and body deep fried (forgot the name). As for sushi, I think the monkfish liver and shimazushi (white fish with chili on top) are great options.\\n\\nThe overall service is great, and the interior looks quite amazing. As always, I recommend sitting at the bar for the best service when ordering a lot of nigiri or sashimi.

(Please keep note that we arrived at 8:05pm...this will be useful later on). I then noticed the owner who was sitting off to the side socializing who came up to us and told us there would be a wait and we were welcomed to sit outside despite it had just rained. I told him it is too wet and asked to be seated inside. He agreed. We were then greeted by a regular clothed gentleman about 5 minutes later. We informed him we were waiting on 2 other people to arrive. (They both arrived within 5 minutes). We then had to wait for this gentleman to walk by again..once he did we informed him the entire party had arrived. He assured us a table in 5 minutes. 30 minutes later, we were finally seated. During this wait, we weren't even offered a menu or even a glass of water. Once seated, it took another 5 minutes to be greeted, which we learned at this time the regular clothed gentleman would be our server. He seemed flustered and all over the place. He was constantly turning around and focusing on other things as opposed to listening to our requests. He left to get us waters....we finally received waters nearly 10 minutes later. I then had to remind him that he had not taken our drink orders. He told us \\"I got yall\\" and proceeded to take our food order. I order an app after considering the entire table was starving. The server even asked me if i wanted the app to come out before my food. (Assuming he was joking, I replied \\"uhhh yea\\"...but I soon learned that was a serious question)\\n*Fast forward 45-50 minutes later, the app arrives.  (Which was literally mozzarella sticks) He sits the plate down and informs me that our food is coming out right now. At this point im wondering what was the point in ordering an app? \\nAnyways, food arrives. Well half of the table. The other half still had to wait another 5 minutes which I believe to be a \\"no no\\" in the restaurant world. There was Literally a problem with everyone's order. My order was missing my side and the lobster tacos were disappointing. The lobster meat is so finely chopped that it is hard to even be sure it is lobster. One order was missing a side order of shrimp. Third order, the mashed potatoes were bland and salmon was tough and dry. The fourth order was supposed to be 1/2 lb of shrimp for the shrimp bowl. It was literally 1/4 of a lb if that. We called the waiter over and informed him of the issues. He wanted to challenge the amount of shrimp, said he would bring my side out, and then informed another guest \\"ohhh yea i spoke to the kitchen, i meant to tell you, they dont do side orders of shrimp\\". We were all like uhhhh when were you going to notify us of this? Not to mention the menu CLEARLY states \\"add a side of shrimp for $6\\". He then speaks to a manager and tells us he will bring in additional shrimp for the shrimp bowl and the side order. 10 minutes later, the shrimp for the bowl arrives but no side order. A manager finally comes over to check and we inform her that we never received the side order. She checks on the status and comes back to inform us that the order was never put in, but she will get it rushed and not added to our bill. (The only highlight of the night). By this time it is about 10:15-10:30. The wait is entirely ridiculous for the size of the place. There are about 10 chairs at the bar, and about 8 tables in this entire establishment. We even had to wait 30 minutes for the server to come back to get our checks. \\nOverall, I would give this place 1 star. The service is horrible and the food is not that great. Oh and the drinks are pure syrup. We all complained about them and the server responds \\"oh wow someone should talk to the bartender because that has been everyone's complaint all night.\\"  Uhhhhhh \\"Someone\\"? Smh. Even a couple next to us sat down after us. After waiting for so long, they just got up and left. Customers continued to walk in without acknowledgement which I find to be extremely unprofessional.

I always get \\"The Cali\\" bowl because I LOVE the crab meat in this bowl. It makes for the perfect variety with the spicy sockeye salmon. I find their portions to be fair and I like how they only have one size. A lot of the other poke places have different sizes for you to choose from, but I always find that if I get a small, it's not enough, and the larger sizes are too much. The portion here is perfect. If you come here, you MUST get their \\"Coco Pandan\\" drink. I am hooked!!! I can't leave without this drink whenever I'm here! It's so tasty and it gives you the perfect balance since this is a sweet drink, with your savoury poke bowl. This isn't the place to go to if you have large groups wanting to go for a private sit down lunch. The space isn't the biggest, so you most likely will need to share communal tables. This is the only downfall, as you may need to wait for seats if you go during busy times of the day, or you can just do take out if this is really an issue. However the clean and sleek interior design makes up for it. Their service is always on point too. I remember the very first time I visited, the guy helping us was extremely informative about their menu and gave us many suggestions on what toppings to choose depending on the bowls we picked out. Every time I'm here, I always hear the staff asking customers whether they've been here before. The service definitely has a lot to do with why I love coming back all the time - of course, their poke is worth the drive too!

My friends and I decided to order the special dining month menu as well as a couple of other dishes to share between us. We ended up getting the Salumi Board and Mixed Lettuce Salad to start then the Canestri, Tagliatelle, and Halibut for our main dishes.\\n\\n\\nThe Salumi Board was generous with mounds of lonza, spicy coppa, and chicken liver pate. The meats were rich and flavorful with pieces of asiago cheese, pickled vegetables, and olives dotting the platter. The presentation was perfect, I loved finding a pickled carrot or cauliflower floret hiding under a scrap of meat.\\n\\nThe salad greens were fresh and crisp with fluffy clouds of shredded parmesan cheese sprinkled across the top. The sweet cipollini onions and roasted shallot vinaigrette were a heavenly combination of sweet, smoky, citrus flavors.\\n\\n\\nThe Tagliatelle was a mix of tagliatelle pasta with bolognese, broccoli and oregano. The sauce was thick with meat and vegetables like a good bolognese should be, I only wish there had been a bit more of it in the dish.\\n\\nThe Canestri consisted of canestri pasta mixed with braised beef, charred fennel and rosemary. This was one of my favorite dishes, the pasta was coated in a silky sauce, no doubt from the braising, while the beef was so tender it practically melted in the mouth.\\n\\nAnd finally the Halibut, which I ordered because halibut is currently in season. The halibut filet is pan seared and served atop braised fennel and grilled endive with puddles of a meyer lemon sauce dotting the plate. The halibut was fresh and flaky with the meyer lemon sauce lending a creamy, sweet tang and the grilled veggies adding a nice char flavor to the palate.\\n\\nThe dining room at Renata is open and could get a bit loud at times, but I also spied a very attractive patio that will make for great summer dinners under the urban Portland skies.

They have a good selection of wines, and while I think the flatbread is what they do best, there are a few tasty appetizers too. Yesterday afternoon I was in need of a hangover cure and found myself craving the lobster mac n' cheese - which is exactly as advertised, a small plate of hot, cheesy macaroni goodness with chunks of lobstah and triangles of flatbread. Someone in an earlier review called it Cheez Whiz. That is very likely true (I posted a picture so you can judge for yourself) but in my condition it is pretty much exactly what I wanted. Not a ton of lobster in it, but there's enough. If you're craving a better quality cheese, they also have a baked goat cheese app with tomato bisque and garlic bread.\\n\\nI shared a flatbread as well - the fig and prosciutto and bleu cheese is my fav - and props to them for having an \\"add bacon to anything\\" option. The fig and prosciutto is pretty much the only one I won't add bacon to. :) The white pizza and the turkey, pear and brie are both good with bacon thrown on.\\n\\nIf you want to watch a game or just enjoy their happy hour specials, there is a bar area around the curve in the back that you might not even notice if you are just coming into the restaurant. Also, their Wine Down Wednesdays events can be nice as well - $20 for wine/apps and funky tunes by DJ BMF and mingling on their outdoor patio.

The bottom line..?     Kouzzina left me confused and very disappointed. \\n\\nOur party of four had a nine o'clock reservation on a Sunday. (They actually forgot to put our reservation in the computer and had to scramble for a good excuse for our seating delay). Despite 1/4 of the tables being visibly open, we waited an additional 25 minutes to be seated; they claimed to be short-staffed. I guess even Disney is feeling the economic crunch and making cutbacks. There is no bar  inside Kouzzina to have a drink and wait, so I walked 100ft down the boardwalk in the rain to grab a couple beers from a friendly pizza vendor and brought them back. \\n\\nUpon being seated, the restaurant itself struck me as being odd. There is no way you will convince me it was redecorated for Ms. Cora's latest endeavor. I don't know what restaurant was previously in this location but  I don't think they redecorated at all. The ambiance was... well... there was no ambiance.  The large rectangular room is open, brightly lit and feels like a deserted beer garden hall with exposed wood beams and dark wood trim everywhere. The walls were very stark and typical Lowes/ Home Depot  light fixtures on the ceiling.  It felt uninviting, almost unfinished. Even dimming the lights just a little would have helped immensely. There was nothing I could spot that even hinted you were at a Greek restaurant, let alone a restaurant attempting to gain credibility from a \\"superstar\\" chef. \\n\\nWe started with grilled grape leaves stuffed with feta and grilled cheese. Blah, blah, blah. Nothing to write home about. You could have fooled me that the grape leaves were grilled and the cheese was only warm.  So far, I was entirely underwhelmed. I'll probably repeat myself later on but, so far I have had better Greek food at local Gyro shops.\\n\\nAs a main course I had the braised lamb shank. Salty. Very, very salty. If I were a deer I would have been ecstatic. It was tender, but horribly over-seasoned. Other things we ordered: whole crispy fish - somewhat bland and more poached than crisp. It was served almost room temperature. We also ordered the grilled flank steak. This pissed me off. Once again it was absurdly salty and tasted poached. It had either been previously frozen in brine which destroyed the texture of the meat or marinated to the point of decomposition. It looked good at first but had a pasty, over-cooked consistency and a grey color throughout the meat. Medium rare?  Not a chance. You could easily get a better steak at a Sizzler, and I hate Sizzler. We would have sent it back but for the fact that our waiter, however polite, was frequently busy with other tables, or helping to yell \\"Opa!\\" with other waiters while carrying a cupcake with a candle and chanting a loud, rehearsed birthday celebration speech to just about every table in the place. Have you ever eaten at a restaurant and become very tired hearing the loud happy birthday song over and over? This was it. Find me a restaurant with a Michelin star or a high Zagat rating that engages in this type of silliness. I dare you. \\n\\n What else... fisherman's stew. Rule number one with shellfish: don't overcook it. They broke rule number one and two. This tomato-based seafood stew was overcooked, over seasoned, then allowed to sit way under the lights to be served tepid. It was unpleasant. \\n\\nThe drinks and sangria we ordered helped to soften the overall blow but when the $200 check arrived I sincerely wished we had just eaten at a local Greek diner where the food would have been undoubtedly better. \\n\\nThis restaurant is an embarrassment to Ms. Cora's reputation and is nothing less than a comedy of errors. A squeeze of lemon and dollop of garlic does not make a restaurant Mediterranean. The food was  poorly executed at best. What happened to quality control? Was  Chef Dee Foundoukis a Hell's Kitchen reject?\\n\\nI would argue that anyone that rates this restaurant above a two needs to have their head/palette examined.  I am desperately searching for something positive to say about the experience but with the exception of good conversation among our table of friends, the evening was a disaster. We didn't even want to risk the challenge of desert. \\n\\nIf bland decor, mediocre service, tepid over seasoned food make you smile, make a reservation. In my humble opinion If Ms. Cora has any pride in her reputation she would march back to this place post-haste and make some radical changes immediately. It is an extremely poor reflection of her talent and needs to be completely re-worked. \\n\\nThe next day, we had the all you could eat breakfast buffet at the local Shoney's.  Despite my disdain for buffets, it was far more satisfying than our meal the night before at Kouzzina. Do yourself a favor - stay away from Kouzzina. There are some wonderful restaurants in Orlando at every price range.

After that come the Europeans, out of towner's and the bougie wannabes. Drinks are not good, staff is ok. Entering the club be prepared to walk the longest distance of your life.

Walk up stairs, make a left, walk up more stairs, walk down a long hallway, pass coatcheck, pass bathroom, walk another long hallway, turn right and there you are. \\n\\nLong story short: Very nicely decorated.

Once inside I do like the wood plank covered walls and the HH room with glowing red fire pit but I'm not satisfied by atmosphere alone.  \\n\\nTheir typical rolls don't leave much to the imagination and are fairly inconsistent. For a place that could be taking advantage of its location in the midst of consumer hell you'd think the bar would be set higher. I'm betting the employees aren't happy here and sadly it's left showing all over the food. One thing I love about sushi is seeing a passionate chef's artistic expression on my plate.

My friend got a cheese plate to start which was equally as good and satisfying. For an entree, I got the mushroom ravioli. It came in a light tomato sauce with slice of tomato and eggplant. Everything went really well together and the ravioli was delicious. It was also just the right amount, I was pleasantly full by the end of dinner and still had some room for dessert! Someone got the trout and someone got the salmon, both of which were cooked beautifully. One of them commented that she almost never finishes her meal when she goes out to eat but had to keep eating the salmon it was so good! \\n\\nWe also made a reservation the day before and were still able to get a table for six people at 8 pm, which was unlike some other restaurants we had tried to go to.

It was early afternoon on a weekday, and I think we were the only ones there - which is not surprising, as it is located in a quiet suburb and thus I can't imagine there being much of a 9-5 lunch crowd. (To their credit, they do serve lunch every day.) The owner-cum-server is actually from Scotland, so I'm happy my first time in a Scottish pub was somewhat authentic. Make that gastropub. \\n\\nWe started off by ordering a round of cocktails - hey, we were on vacation. My libation of choice, the Maggie May, has cemented itself in my memory as one of my favorite drinks. Made of pineapple and lavender infused gin, grapefruit, honey and ginger ale and served in a mason jar (always seals the deal...), it was refreshing and light. Its list of ingredients could have leaned it too sweet, but nay - it almost tasted a bit diluted, like rainwater - and I say that in a good way. It went down easy, perfect for a dewy spring day.\\n\\nI don't remember too much about my sausage sandwich, except that it was satisfying and less overwhelming than it looked haha. I also appreciated the option to have an arugula salad on the side instead of fries. Girl likes her greens :) The best part of the meal was the surprise cake brought out at the end for the birthday girl among us, compliments of the chef! I'm not a big fan of the traditional yellow cake, so I couldn't contain my excitement when we got a just-made sticky toffee pudding punched with candles instead. It was divine! (\\"Pudding\\" across the pond being more of what we call cake here, than the custard-like, Jello-y concoction you might be thinking of.) There was also whisky in the confection, bookending our meal with some more swigs of liquor, that good friend of ours...\\n\\nIf living in suburbia means lazy afternoons spent in cozy gastropubs with mason jar cocktails and Scottish ex-pats, why the hell not? ;)"},{"name":"Carrabba's Italian Grill","address":"931 N State Road 434","city":"Altamonte Springs","stars":"3.5","text":"It was our first visit to this location.

We have since been disillusioned. First, the environment. The process of waiting in line to order BEFORE you get a table means, if the place is busy, you have no idea if there will be space to sit down when you make your order. And the place is certainly busy. Also, with a room full of diners the noise level can interfere with having a conversation. My husband is slightly hard of hearing in one ear and has a very hard time. I get rather tired of raising my voice. \\n\\nThird, my favorite menu item changed drastically. I loved the Huevos Rancheros, which used to be two artfully placed mounds with eggs on top, drizzled with delicious avocado sauce and lightly accented with salsa. The last time I ordered this it was an unrecognizable mound totally swallowed up in salsa. I couldn't get any other flavor past the salsa unless I scraped it off. Did they feel the need to sacrifice flavor for quantity? I have also experienced inconsistency in other dishes -- one day I saw huge walnut pancakes that filled the plate with a generous sprinkling of walnut halves. The next visit a friend of mine was given two much smaller pancakes with chopped nuts as an afterthought.\\n\\nFinally, we were treated rather rudely one morning when we came in early to beat the crowd. We were the only ones waiting in line, but the counter attendant needed to do odd jobs around the restaurant, including giving himself a good body stretch against the counter, not acknowledging us and letting us wait ten minutes to order.

We received our drinks in a timely manner and then ordered our apps/salads.  Just before our apps came out they took our meal order.  I split the wedge salad with one of my friends and it was very good.  For dinner I ordered the filet mignon and for shared sides we ordered the polenta, fingerling potatoes, spinach and French fries.  My filet came out and it was plated beautifully and cooked medium as I asked.  I have to say I think it is the best filet mignon I have ever had, I think it had some kind of seasoning on it, not sure but it was so good.  The sides were all very good.  Now you would think French fries are French fries but these were unbelievable, everybody at our table was commenting on them.  For dessert I got the salted caramel cheesecake (I think that is what it was called), it came with a  snickerdoodle cookie on it.  It was delicious.  Now back to Drake and Sarah, the were very attentive during our whole visit, Drake knew the menu and was quick at recommendations when asked.  Sarah was always right there and helpful during our visit.  I wish her all the best.  Now my one suggestion would be some kind of  green beans (and that is because it is the only cooked veggie I eat).  I can't wait to go back for dinner but I also want to try the lunch and brunch.  If you haven't tried this place, I would highly recommend trying it."},{"name":"Little Sheep Mongolian Hot Pot","address":"2400 Seton Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"AYCE is back!!

So, I can't say that their sushi it actually amazing, just the harvest roll. \\n\\nOverall, we had a good time, but I think it was more the company than anything else.

When I was a youngin' in high school, I would've never thought of going to a steakhouse as my taste buds weren't quite matured yet for a great steak.  In fact, I didn't even know this place existed back then.  \\n\\nBut if this place has been in business for that long and then some (since 1938), they have to be doing *something* right!  \\n\\nAnd I'm always a sucker for a good steak!  \\n\\nI heard of Frank's when it was featured on an episode of the Phantom Gourmet and the episode in particular emphasized their prime rib.  There's the 10oz, the 16oz and the King Cut at over 22oz.  Yes, please!  \\n\\nBoy, that medium rare prime rib was awfully pretty (and over 22oz big).  I almost didn't want to eat it.  \\n\\nIt was great!  That side of mashed potatoes that came out were nice, too.  Not too chunky (for those who don't like it that way), and real potatoes.  Yum!!!  I usually get a salad beforehand, and their salads are perfectly fine.  Just enough to take the edge off of your hunger (*do* come here hungry) before the main course comes out. \\n\\nPretty much every time I've gone here, I've gotten the King Cut prime rib, because I'm a creature of habit.  However, last night, the hubby wanted to try their Tomahawk Delmonico Steak.  It's $49.95, over 3 pounds of meat, and Frank's recommends it should be shared.  \\n\\nMotherf**er is HUGE!!!!!  And *beautiful*. It looks like something from The Flinstones!!\\n\\nIt's *thick*.  We ordered it medium rare, the best way to go, and it was a bit charred on the outside, which really only adds to the flavor of it.  A bit of marbly fat, as steaks like this usually are, seals the deal on taste. \\n\\nAnd it's quite a novelty...two lovely older ladies that were sitting near us were getting quite a kick out of our faces when we saw it come to the table and when we took that first bite.  \\n\\nJust typing this out makes me want to go back there tonight to have another one. \\n \\nAdditional notes...another reviewer mentioned this is the type of place where the waitress is going to call you \\"hon\\" and that's why she liked it.  I agree.  It's part of it's charm.  And service is friendly.  No pretentiousness.  Just good eats and relaxed atmosphere.  \\n\\nTheir parking lot in the back is a bit awkward to navigate, and small.  However, there is additional parking across the street at the bank after hours.   Otherwise, it's street parking. \\n\\nI'd like to see more of a diversity of draft beers, but I can deal with what's given if I'm hankering for a beer.  Otherwise, there are some nice cocktails offered.\\n\\nSolid place."},{"name":"Bittersweet - Cafe & Confections","address":"836 Main St","city":"Louisville","stars":"3.5","text":"Stopped in on a hot afternoon.

Not that it is much of a palace, but more of a proper bagelry with all of the schmears, bialys, baked goods, and everything related. I showed up just before 10am and the place had a good crowd gathered at tables and waiting to place orders. I stepped up and the nice girl behind the counter took my order in a rather... odd fashion. \\n\\nI wanted to order four bagels total -- two cheddar with egg, cheese, (one with turkey sausage) and two others with a schmear. The other two were a egg & onion bagel with jalapeno cream cheese and a blueberry bagel with butter. The bagels were great, though the cheddar bagels had a bit of a sweet tinge... My only observation and thought on constructive criticism is how they take orders and then move onto preparation. \\n\\nThe schmears I wanted were in a completely opposite part of the shop. In the deli section, mind you. So, the poor girl had to deal with orders coming out of the kitchen, had to work on toasting bagels in the awkwardly placed toaster, and had to run to the other side of the shop to get other items. I'd highly recommend they move these items into a centrally located area for a short time during their morning rush. The whole process seemed quite off and I was worried some things would be forgotten from my order. Luckily, though the process was a lengthy one, I walked away happy with everything. \\n\\nI'd definitely return for breakfast as it is close to my wife's workplace. The bagels were good and I'd love to try a few other things on the menu."},{"name":"Little Sheep Mongolian Hot Pot","address":"2400 Seton Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"This place isn't thatttt good.

We arrived at around 3-3:30 when the restaurant was about 1/4 full, we wanted a booth so we picked a standard 4 person one against the wall to sit at; it was dirty so I grabbed some napkins to wipe it off, no big deal. We sat there for maybe 5 minutes and then questioned if there was table service on the floor. That prompted us to move up to the top area and try sitting at a larger booth, we had a server then show up right away and ask \\"How many is this for?\\" Rather than introducing herself or even wearing a smile. When we told her eventually there would be a total of 4 but it may be an hour or so at which point she cut me off and said you can move BACK to the smaller booth because this is for 6 or more. I've worked in restaurants and I get the fact that she is wanting to maximize her tip earnings, I have no problem with moving however she went about it the wrong way and ADMITTED that she saw us sitting at the original booth and decided not to approach us for some reason. The customer Service skills of a few other employees were subpar to say the least but our actual servers attitude was by far the worst. I chose this as a meeting place for my friends yesterday opposed to our normal hangout at a few bars in the Short North area but clearly that was a mistake.

I'd tell him what meat I want, then he'd read the choices to me.. then I would inquire about it, then he would ask the front cashier lady, then he would repeat it back to me. the whole process wouldn't haven't been so infuriating if the lady had not been so uncooperative and playing \\"21 questions\\" with us. \\n\\nUS: what kind of sauce comes with that?\\nHER: brown sauce\\n( no sh!t sherlock. like that tells me what flavor that is. brown sauce could be ANYTHING! )\\nUS: is it watery or thick? \\nHER: thick\\n( wow, can you be any less descriptive? )\\n\\nafter however many questions were asked, we just picked whatever. I wanted 2 dishes: any stir fry with spare ribs and an all veggie stir fry. so, in the end we got \\"spareribs with black bean sauce and bitter melon\\" and \\"mixed vegetables\\".\\n\\nwhen the bf brought it home, he commented on how crappy of a job the food packer was. I examined the bag and saw it for myself. it's like the person just threw everything in there and hoped that the containers will take the shape of the bag. the spareribs dish was packed in a cheap, thin styrofoam container AND worst of all, it was cracked! as for the other dish, it was stuffed into a chinese take out box with sauce filled to the rim. obviously, they're being way too cheap with the packaging because these were all the wrong containers for saucy dishes! therefore, all the sauce was leaking out into the bag and all over the plastic wear and sauces. I mean, it was so messy removing everything out. what a nightmare. [ see pictures ]\\n\\nboth dishes ended up tasting below decent. the bitter melon (spare ribs dish) wasn't steeped long enough, so the bitterness was too overpowering. the sauce was supposed to be black bean, but it was mostly oil. you could see the fat separating in the dish and all the oily air bubbles. blech. sauce was bland. had to revise it with things I already had at home to make it edible.\\n\\nthe mixed vegetables was a little worse than the spare ribs w/ bitter melon. the sauce was supposed to be thick but the vegetables ending up watering down the sauce. also, sauce here was bland as well. water chestnuts were random. if there were descriptions in the menu, this could have been avoided (hate water chestnuts). the bamboo shoots and water chestnuts were easily identified as canned food. oh and rice was a bit overcooked and dry. \\n\\nmoral of the story, don't be lazy to go to buford highway for better and authentic (and less expensive) chinese food. this place is far from authentic. sure the people are chinese, but the food isn't true chinese food. dishes are more americanized than anything. also, please don't order carryout from here unless you want to be eating straight from the bag."},{"name":"Harlow","address":"3632 SE Hawthorne Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Prasad has opened its new SE Portland outpost in the old Bridgeport space on Hawthorne, and I couldn't be happier for it.

This place draws the business lunch crowd probably because of decent lunch prices and a beer for the adventurous stressed out workers.  I ordered the light (under 575 calories) chicken tacos.  The tacos are in a corn tortilla shell and were quite tasty.  I had 4 tacos for $5.75 along with black beans, a little coleslaw, and salsa.  This was on par with taco truck prices.

Their dinner prices are more around $10-15 especially for pasta and seafood items.  \\n\\nI ended the meal with a pazookie, which is a warm, deep dish cookie with ice cream on top.  The kids size is $2.75 which was a decent deal.

For $8.35 taxes included, I got a bowl of noodles with lamb and beef, a bag of bubble waffles, and a lemon coke. Solid deal.\\n\\nThe average: Taste and quantity. While the price was right, the taste did not blow my mind. The soup base wasn't overly flavorful and the noodles pretty basic. As a self-proclaimed hungry man, the portion size was on the smaller side. Noodles were plentiful but they really skimped on the protein. Looking behind the counter, I could see endless bags of pre-made bubble waffles sitting under a heat lamp. Fortunately for me, I tend to like them on the crispier side. \\n\\nThe bad: Wait times. According to my receipt number, there were only a handful of orders in front of mine. What I didn't know was each order included 3 to 5 different menu items.

My friend order the tsukemen.\\n\\nThe gyoza came out cold and was not freshly pan fried. It all stuck to each other because when pan friend gyoza get cold it's not crispy anymore and they all stick together. For being how slow everyone got seated it seems like the gyoza was not made to order but all pre fried and just sitting there. \\n\\nMy ramen was also luke warm and my friend tsukemen noodles the broth that's suppose to be super hot so you can dip the noodles in was coldish warm. She didn't even finish it. Very very disappointed and it's sad for them to tarnish this brand because my friend has been to the one in Tokyo and she said it was amazing!

I'm not getting paid to write this review (that would qualify as the world's best job), however, I could see how one might receive that impression after reading it.  The fact that I live in the building that this restaurant calls \\"home\\" also hasn't influenced my opinion--I'm just trying to figure out how I'm going to restrain myself from taking the elevator straight into the heart of culinary heaven multiple times per week.  I'm not a native Atlantan.  I'm not even a Southerner.  I'm a Midwestern transplant who has been hearing rumors about Watershed and the goodness that it dishes up ever since I moved here.  Naturally, I was disappointed to discover that the original location had closed.  However, from what I can tell--it's back--and bigger and better than ever.\\n\\nFrom the minute you walk through the double doors into a spacious entryway, you feel a particular vibe and energy emanating from the space that pales in comparison to the ambience that lies beyond in the bar area and dining room.  Southern rustic charm complete with wood paneling and soft, subtle colors adorning the walls elevate the space to an upscale yet strangely familiar and comforting space.  The bar area was extremely spacious and inviting and the dining room was well laid out, giving diners a feeling of \\"home\\" while maintaining enough distance between tables to give you a sense of privacy during the meal.\\n\\nThe cocktail list was impressive--try a Cool Heat or a Hemingway--either way, your tastebuds will get a good workout with some of the best mixology on Peachtree.  While we didn't try any of the Bar Snacks in anticipation of a large meal, I kept eyeing the large caramel-glazed popcorn balls with bits of bacon mixed in that were strategically placed on either side of the large bar.  For dinner, we tried the fresh hearts of palm with country ham, fried oysters, and beef tartare.  The taste and textures were amazing--as was the freshness of the ingredients.  For dinner, our party tried the tile fish, vegetable plate, blue crab and lobster ragout, and the steak salad.  The meal simply blew me away--the tile fish was quite simply the best piece of fish I've ever eaten and the pecan dust sprinkled on top brought an unexpected crunch to the dish that put it over the top.  Last but not least we sampled 'The Mess' and the Pecan Banana Bread Pudding for dessert which were the perfect end to the meal.\\n\\nWhile Watershed is still working through it's growing pains--waited ~30 minutes to be seated past our reservation time and took ~15 minutes to be waited on at the bar--it's something that will definitely come with time and is completely worth the wait.  I can't wait to return for Wednesday night fried chicken and Sunday brunch--not to mention sampling the rest of the regular dinner menu.

It's decent, and for the price, you can find better.  But when you couple the food with the charm of a full blown Mcmenamins, it's very cool.  This locale doesn't have it.  If you must eat here, do so during happy hour, get Cajun tots, a ruby ale and enjoy the bargain.

The key is to turn onto Production Way and then the first left into the parking lot and then either a left or right - but you have to look into an alley way of sorts to actually spot the entrance. It's a shame there isn't a bigger sign in the front to draw the Universal crowd. In addition to the great food and reasonable prices, the atmosphere is modern and comfortable with outside seating available. We did have an opportunity to chat with the owner/head chef and the GM which gave us more reason for the high rating. The only down side is the entree menu does not have many selections so it might be helpful to have chef specials to add to the menu. As I mentioned, the bread is a killer - we had 2 large pieces which filled us up so we took some of our dinner home with us."},{"name":"Savona Coffee House","address":"1898 SE Columbia River Dr","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Huckleberry White Mocha!

It had a few surprises in terms of cartilage or bone making it into my bite, but it was cooking medium well just the way I asked, and was extremely succulent. There was a moment of zen when I took a bite. And then another one when I'd worked through half the steak and came across a ridiculously tender section of the steak that just melted in my mouth. Add to that the side of baked potato with sour cream and butter, and another side of salad (you know, for the guilt), and we've got a winner.\\n\\nOh, and then have the caramel apple pie which comes with icecream. Oh. My. GAWD.\\n\\nSeveral hours later, I didn't need any Tums or antacid or anything. I polished off a huge portion of food, steak no less, and dessert - and I didn't feel like I was going to die or collapse into a coma.\\n\\nStill, I can't see myself giving this place more than 3 stars. I don't know why. I enjoyed my meal, I didn't have a negative after-effect, and the dessert was delicious. The wait staff was top form (until it was time to take our check away - we waited for 20 minutes until she finally picked it up).

Harlow exceeded all of my foodie expectations when I was shopping around the Hawthorne District. You grab a menu and order at the counter before finding a seat. Service moves fast so even if tables are taken, chances are there will be some free once you are done ordering. They have espresso drinks, vegetarian and vegan dishes, raw cheesecakes, pastries and smoothies. We ordered the chili bowl and the polenta with eggs dish. Both came out fast, hot and looked just as amazing as they tasted. We also ordered a chai latte which was on point. The polenta and eggs dish was SO delicious. It was filling but not heavy with perfect seasoning and the polenta has been on my mind ever since. My partner enjoyed his meal equally as much and we just looked at each other with eyes that seemed to say, \\"We need to move to Portland immediately.\\" The prices are reasonable for the freshness and quality but they are definitely city prices. The aesthetic of the restaurant is simplistic with clean walls and funky paintings hanging. You can grab a seat at the window bar if you wish to people watch while sipping your chai and saying \\"mmm\\" with every bite you take. Onlookers will surely be jealous.

We each ordered a cocktail and decided to share the chicken wing appetizer . I got the Fenway Fiz (888 blueberry vodka, rosemary simple, mint, lemon and champagne). Since we were hungry, we all ordered various trays at once. I ordered the pulled chicken, farm salad and Mac and cheese. The drinks too over a half an hour then we were informed that the fryer was backed up so the wings would be delayed. Finally, the appetizer and trays came out an hour or longer wait.  The food was good. My friend asked for blue cheese to dip her wing in and the waiter brought over blue cheese crumbs. I was disappointed that the waiter did not try to make our experience better by offering to give us bread while we waited or comp something on the bill. It was $112 for 3 trays, 3 drinks and an appetizer. I  have been here before and everything was fine. But I could see the other tables experiencing very slow inattentive service.

Although the management claims to have continued the restaurant's long standing commitment to its founding principles, I'm inclined to think that it's but a shell of its former self.\\n\\nFood: We opted to start with a bottle of Riesling, which arrived in a thick plastic bag masquerading as a wine bucket. I've never been served a bottle of wine in a plastic bag before, but I suppose there's always time for firsts. For appetizers, we opted for the spicy pork and olive meatballs and the pork belly wraps. The meatballs were perfectly cooked, but the pork belly was disappointing - the dish arrived with three of the most flavorless and thinly sliced pieces of pork belly that I've ever ingested. For an entree, I opted for the grilled berkshire pork chop, which was decent, but not overly memorable. We also ordered a side of mac n' cheese, which arrived late and more frigid than a penguin's teat. We returned the dish to the kitchen, which was the first time I've done so since moving to Atlanta two years ago. The replacement arrived 10 minutes later and was piping hot - unfortunately, by that time, our entrees had already been cleared. To add insult to injury, the waiter charged us for it - I definitely wasn't looking for a handout, but comping the side dish would have seemed like a reasonable gesture for the inconvenience, particularly considering the bill was already well over $100.\\n\\nService: Friendly, but inexperienced. Aside from the fact that the waiter clearly forgot to enter the mac n' cheese order and then had the kitchen rush the dish to the point that it was served partially cooked, his basic wine knowledge was lacking. Upon inquiring about whether the Riesling was on the sweeter side, he replied, \\"well aren't all Rieslings sweet?\\". As if it couldn't get any worse, the wine was drier than the Sahara - the bottle was also served lukewarm and he gave a heavy first pour, so the wine didn't have time to chill. \\n\\nAtmosphere: The new space is more expansive and aesthetically pleasing than the former location. I particularly liked the large centrally located bar, the high ceilings, and the subtle color palette. There is also a large outdoor patio overlooking Peachtree. During my Saturday evening visit, the clientele reeked of Buckhead and the dress code was teetering on business casual.\\n\\nCost: Expensive by most standards and overpriced in many cases. Bar snacks are $4-$7, appetizers are $8-$10, and entrees are $20-$35. Sides are $5-$8. \\n\\nOther: Watershed is closed on Monday's. Lunch is served Tuesday-Saturday, 11:30AM-3PM, while dinner is served Tuesday-Thursday, 5PM-10PM, and Friday-Saturday, 5PM-11PM. Sunday brunch is served from 11:30AM-3PM.

The food was ok and pretty well priced, but I probably wouldn't bother going back.  My hummus was really good, but the eggplant was sliced extremely thin and was extremely greasy.

I told her I didn't want cold sauce on hot chicken, so she took it back to warm it up. 7 minutes later I went back to the counter to inquire about the sauce, they said she was looking for something to warm it up in. Really? Okay, I finally get the sauce although my wings are now luke warm, whatever. My husband asks me how long we've been waiting, I noticed that it's been 32 minutes since we ordered. I get ready to go inquire when a guy from the kitchen comes out and says they're out of green peppers, do I want another topping? I asked if they had started on our pizza yet, he said NO. What?

The bagels aren't quite as good as what I've had in Manhattan's lower east side, but I must admit that I was pretty impressed to find bagels of this quality in the South. Golberg's also offers a fairly comprehensive selection of sandwiches with almost every bread, deli meat, and topping option imaginable. They also have jars of bread and butter pickles at the table and offer you a complimentary fill-up of your soft drink to go, which were both welcomed deviations from the typical restaurant norm.\\n\\nService: Goldberg's offers take out and sit down service. However, either way you choose to order, the service at Goldberg's is simply unparalleled. The wait staff is incredibly friendly and efficient. The manager even makes a point to come to every table multiple times throughout the meal to ensure that all is to your liking. If you aren't satisfied with something, they will fix it immediately, no questions asked.\\n\\nAtmosphere: The atmosphere is random. The actual seating arrangement is similar to a cafeteria, but the walls are adorned with a series of chochkies that have absolutely no relation to one another. On my last visit, I noticed a wall mural of Frank Sinatara  in front of me, dancing show girls to my right, and the Adam's Family to my left. However, I can overlook these visual atrocities because Goldberg's food and service are so stellar.\\n\\nPrice: Incredibly inexpensive for the size and quality.

Located right in the middle of Newbury street, this is more of a social spot then anything; a place to seen and be seen as they say. \\n\\nLunch: I was truly unimpressed with lunch. Options were limited to basically salads or sandwiches, none of which sound terribly appealing to me. Service was up to the usual Stephanie's standards, but the place seems much more rushed and buzzing then later on in the evening. Portions are generous as always, but lacked any defining flavor or characteristics. I didn't see anything come out of the kitchen that I couldn't make at home in a couple minutes or get at the local sub shop for half the price. Very forgettable meal.\\n\\nDinner: This is what I mainly come for. They formerly had an open faced turkey sandwich which was among the best I've had. Toasted white bread, juicy sliced turkey, cranberry sauce, stuffing, and mashed potatoes. Not sure if this is a seasonal item, but if so, should definitely be put in place year round. Dessert is where this place really shines. My single favorite dessert item in the world is served here, the apple bread pudding. It's unlike a traditional bread pudding in that it has a bit more structure to it. They drizzle it with a nice thick caramel, and serve a large scoop of fresh vanilla ice cream on top.

I know they have kinks they will need to work out so even though I did not enjoy my entree, I will definitey come back a second time and re-evaluate my experience with them then.\\n\\nBeing that it was a Saturday AND the first week of their opening, it was PACKED! Luckily I had made reservations for a party of 6 so we were seated about 30 minutes after our reservation. \\n\\nI ordered the Grilled Orata. Orata is supposed to be a mild fish...let's say I was not happy with my plate and neither was my friend. It was not fresh. The fish was fishy and it had skin on it. I'm picky when it comes to fish, it has to be fresh and without skin (my fault since I forgot to ask)...so I scraped the skin off and ate all of it anyway only because the fish was $22....now PRICE -- I felt the portions were small for the price you were paying. One other thing to note -- the entree doesn't come with sides either! So for $6 you can add a side to your entree! Folks - we are not at a steak house here...you would think your fish would come with something....So you are looking at $28 for a piece of fish that is smaller than your hand and a small side. I am more than happy to pay top dollar for quality food, but this I thought was a little on the ridiculous side for something so small and far less than mediocre. My husband had the Bacatini Amatriciana for $14. He wasn't impressed with it either. It was mediocre. My gf had the Papperadelle for $15...probably the best dish at the table. This is what I'll be ordering on my next visit...good amount of good quality pasta! All in all, I had high hopes for the entrees but most were only mediocre.\\n\\nI will say that the desserts made up for my terrible meal.

That was the plan - go in guerrilla-style, try another ramen joint and then Yelp afterwards about the experience.  Shabu?  Come on, what's so special about that, that'll be a boring Yelp even though it's my favorite meal.\\n\\nWell, I came out packed filled with shabu.  Sorry ramen, maybe another day, cause Shabu & Mein's hot pot blew my expectations right out of the water.\\n\\nFirst, really cute waitress.  Emily was so very nice, and honestly looked like she wanted us to have the best experience.  She was a bit short-staffed (she literally had like 12 shabu tables at once) so service was a bit slow, but not her fault!  Plus, I immediately gave her points for giving me a hugeeee chunk of BBQ sauce when I told her we would need extra as we used a lot.  She was also fairly attentive to my water level, a direly important element when eating the sodium packed shabu meal.  I'd request for Emily in the future again when I come by. :)\\n\\nSecond, the decor and seating are great!  Contemporary but wooden, giving you a clean 21st century Japanese feel.  Also, can I mention just how GIGANTIC the tables are?  Literally, when our waitress brought us to the table, it could have fit 6 people easily.  We were two tiny asians.  I was so tempted to lay facedown on the table and roll around (while avoiding the hot plate of course)!\\n\\nThird, food.  Ohhh the food.  I would first say they had the best basic beef ever - for $16, it's only slightly more than most of it's competitors, but the beef was so fresh, and the fat perfectly marveled within the meat.  It was absolutely delicious!  Also, the veggie dish that came with was also very impressive - you had your standard cut corn, spinach, watercrest, napa, daikon and tomato.  However, they also included enoki mushrooms, a slice of king oyster mushroom, and woodear mushrooms.  The portions were also very generous, and so very fresh!  I did miss the carrot and tofu that could have been included, but overall a very solid veggie combo.  Lastly, we tried to \\"Ramen\\" up our shabu by getting the tonkotsu (pork bone broth meant for ramen) soup base as well as one portion of ramen noodles.  I love this option!  The soup was SUCH a good base for the hot pot - it made it very savory, and was of course watered down (otherwise it would have been too salty for hotpot).  Also, compared to other places, you can get the WHOLE pot without a divider with the same soup base, for the same price.  That's like technically half the price of other places if you're okay with getting the same broth in a shared pot. The ramen noodles were also very \\"Q\\" - chewy, fresh, soft.  Absolutely delicious!\\n\\nUnfortunately, there were a few misses - the lamb didn't stand out as much with certain pieces being a bit too dry, the udon was a bit thin and would disintegrate at certain areas, and the fish paste taste was very lacking and not as chewy compared to some other shabu restaurants.  However, these points were overly eclipsed by everything else.  I'll definitely be returning with more fellow fans. :)"},{"name":"Agora Sports Bar & Grill","address":"84 East Ave","city":"Austin","stars":"2","text":"Got the groupon since I had $10 free to spend I decided to go with this.

Unfortunately I don't have many good things to say... I ordered the Chili dusted grass fed beef sub with hopes that my beef craving would be satisfied. In one word ...disappointed. Yeah, maybe I should've just done the smart thing and got a burger...who knew?! The mediocre sub roll was soggy and the mango salsa now that I think about it wasn't the best pairing with this sandwich anyhow. \\n\\nI don't even think the truffle aioli made it onto the sandwich because I certainly couldn't tell. Did I mention that the \\"chili dusted ness\\" was not apparent until a burp maybe a few hours later.. I wanted to like you CBC I really did. I went with co-workers at lunch this time so beer was not on our radar but if I go back I will definitely get drinks. \\n\\nThe lamb meatballs and golden raisin bread dish was my second choice. A few of my coworkers ended up getting it and apparently I didn't miss out on anything.

I am from TX, so when I heard about this place I was so excited to come check it out. We got there a little before 6pm on friday, hostess was great and very friendly. Once seated, we waited a ridiculous amount of time for our server to even approach the table, we wanted some  drinks bad I mean it is friday, right?! Finally we flag down this guy who I guess was a busser, and he basically got our drink order. When the server finally showed up, we were a bit fed up for the wait, plus the busser was already back with our drinks...this guy took better care of us than the server did, since he was more interested in the large party that she got seated with.\\nAnd now on to the food.....I got the ribs and my other friend got the sweet cheeks tray. All the plates were way overpriced and not as good as I was hoping. The ribs were very bland, sauce did not stick at all. The 2 sides my friend got with his meal were very small portions and the pulled pork was super dry and swimming in grease. Yuck!\\nI came here expecting to have the best BBQ in Boston, since it's supposed to be owned by some girl that didn't win Top Chef. What I got was a reminder of why I didn't eat BBQ in this town. This place is trying too hard to seem like the are fine dining, but their product is worse than food you buy off the street. First of all, BBQ at those prices is a ridiculous concept. Obviously this Top Chef girl has never been to the Lone-star state, it would be the same as having a fine dining Mexican restaurant. It just doesn't work, BBQ is supposed to be fun, tasty and in a relaxed setting, what I got was a very stuffy atmosphere and mediocre food. Seriously the BBQ truck in the south end has better ribs than this place, and if you don't know about that joint, well you better find out. And lastly, we ended up running into the busser who basically WAS our server at a bar later on that night, only to tell us he was fired for no reason, go figure!

The reason this place got 5 stars wasn't the waitresses fault, or immediate service I got, it was the combination of the wait time for the food and when I received it, it was warm to cold. I couldn't remember what I ordered exactly, but what I do know is it came in a large cup like thing and it was a mix of bananna shaping the cub with meat on the inside. Everyone around me had it so why not. They have a variety of them so just ask and I'm sure they'll explain it to you. Pretty sure it was a variant of their tostones relleno. I myself am Cuban and I know tostones aren't usually very hot when they come out of the kitchen or when it's order on the side, but mine was colder than room temperature. That, and the meat was warm. No smoke at all when it got to me so I'm not sure how long it was sitting waiting. With that said, the food was great, no complaints at all. I just don't understand how it took 25 minutes for 1 small dish and got to me cold on top of that. If you're wondering if I would come here again, I would because the food itself was tasty, but I'd only give it one more chance before I spend my money and TIME elsewhere."},{"name":"Jim & Patty's Coffee","address":"4130 SW 117th Ave","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4.5","text":"This place is definitely for coffee people.

They give you about half a pound of meat and the you can add on two sides (one cold, one hot) for $6. I was hoping the meal would already come with sides considering the price, but nope. The meats were really good and I liked the sauces provided. Three options - your basic molasses based bbq sauce, a Carolina vinegar sauce, and a jalapeno sauce. I loved the jalapeno sauce! Normally I don't think jalapenos are spicy, but this definitely had a kick to it! The sides were good too - I ordered the mac & cheese and farm salad. I really liked that the salad included brussel sprouts. It had a bit too much dressing that caused the greens to be a little soggy, but it was tasty nonetheless. I thought the mac and cheese was good, but could've done with a little less bread/cracker crumbs.\\n\\nOverall it was a good meal, but our meal came out to be around $60 before tip!
