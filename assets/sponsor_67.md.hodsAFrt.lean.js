When someone in my party tried to tell her how the bills would be split, just attempting to be helpful, she interrupted him and said she'd split them later. She took our drink orders and brought them. And then left us alone for 20 minutes, every glass at the table empty. We saw her a couple times for other tables but she never stopped back for us until after we got our food. I went to the bartender and said since our server is ignoring us, could she please refill my drink. She was very nice and accommodating and asked if there was anything else I needed. Shortly after that, I guess her name is Anne (5537) according to the receipt, seemed to be more observant to our needs, filling everyone's drinks. I don't know if the bartender told her or not that I said we were being ignored. She offered to fill my soda. Not only was it warm, despite being poured over the ice left in my glass, it was flat. I've never had someone bring me warm flat soda before, this was a first. A disgusting first. There was a soda fountain right next to our table. And she brings us a jug of warm flat soda. My boyfriend's water that she brought for him was also warm and melted all of his ice within a minute or so. I don't even know what we did to deserve this kind of treatment. Half of us are in our 30s, there were a couple younger people at the table. Maybe she thought we were young and wouldn't tip her well and weren't worth her attention. Maybe she saw that our group had 7 people and our gratuities would be added in automatically so she didn't have to work for it. Either way, how we were treated was unacceptable. I hardly ever complain, I'm not hard to please. I don't have high expectations. But Anne had no intention of meeting even bare minimum expectations. When I emailed this complaint, there was a box to mark how I preferred to be contacted, I said email. They called and then emailed when I didn't answer. I'm not really a phone person, I said I preferred email. Why is that an option if they're going to disregard that? They tell me to call them so I do, maybe I'll at least get a refund for the horrible experience? Nope. They just wanted to apologize over the phone.

As one of the confused, ravenous masses, I can safely say this place is heaven. Their ice cream flavors are fantastic, but I usually opt for froyo (hard or soft) and a whole heap of toppings, instead. The sugarfree flavors are chemical-tasting but not bad, and the lactose-free coconut milk ones are a great alternative if dairy makes your stomach hate you. They also sometimes have lactose-free hemp flavors, but I've never tried 'em.\\n\\nThe Harvard Square location is almost always busy; I've never been there when they don't have a line. It also has one of the more zoned-out group of employees, but this has never really bothered me all that much... except when they skimp on the toppings (I'd say this happens around 30% of the time).

For $6, $7 and $8, I expect a good margarita!  For $2.99, well, that's different... you get what you pay for.  And margaritas at Las Margaritas are NOT $2.99...far from it...\\n\\nIt really doesn't matter if your atmosphere is fun, servers are attractive, and prices are fair (although on the high side for Mexican food) if your drinks are almost undrinkable and your food is nearly inedible.\\n\\nI most recently went during a Cinco de Mayo celebration there, and could not find a single soul who liked their margarita.

We arrived at the restaurant by car at about 7:30PM. The area in front of the restaurant is marked for valet parking and we waited several minutes, assuming the valet was in the process of parking another diner's vehicle. Finally, my wife headed into the restaurant to enquire but could not seem to get the attention of the ma√Ætre d' or other staff. Eventually, another diner, who was waiting for her table, observed me standing by my car and came out of the restaurant to tell me that there was no valet parking on weekday evenings despite what we were told when we made our reservation.\\n\\nUnfamiliar with the neighborhood, and with no guidance from the restaurant staff, I drove around several blocks marked exclusively for resident parking before finding the garage at Copley Place - which was kind enough to accommodate my car for a mere $30 and a four block walk back to Petit Robert Bistro.\\n\\nI arrived back at Petit Robert at about 8:05PM to find my wife standing on the sidewalk, having been told there would be a \\"slight delay\\" before our table would be ready. The \\"slight delay\\" was approximately a half hour and we were seated at about 8:35PM. It was several more minutes before bread was brought to the table, with the waitress executing a remarkably graceful pirouette without even a pause to take a cocktail order. Another ten minutes passed before I managed to flag down a member of the wait staff and request a simple vodka on the rocks.\\n\\nApparently, the bartender was also very busy, because it was about twenty minutes later, a little after 9:00PM, when a waitress returned with the cocktail and took our dinner order.\\n\\nAt this point, it having been almost two hours since we had left home to set out for the restaurant, both my wife and I felt that the use of the restroom would be good idea. I suggested she go and that I would follow upon her return. However, she found a line of about four other diners waiting to use the single available toilet and her \\"adventure\\" took about a quarter hour.\\n\\nNever wanting to shirk a challenge, I set forth on a similar mission and found a presumably different array of four diners waiting for the lone restroom. The effect was reminiscent of being on an airliner just as the movie ends and everyone heads for the lavatories at once.\\n\\nWhile waiting in the restroom line, I was standing in front of the restaurant's bread warmer. I was amused to see a small sign, in both French and English, advising that tongs were to be used to handle the bread. Alas. all three members of the wait staff whom I observed retrieved the baguettes by hand, and one person refilled the bread warmer by dumping a box of bread into the draw, also poking things around manually.  C'est la vie.  \\n\\nWhen I finally returned to our table, my wife's pat√© and my soup had been served. Aside from its having cooled somewhat while I was on my mission of desperation, the soup was still reasonably flavorful.\\n\\nDinner was finally served to us at about 9:50PM - more than two hours after our arrival at the restaurant.  Like the soup and the pate, the entr√©es were tasty and attractively presented. It was truly a shame that we were so ravenously hungry by then, and growing stiff from prolonged sitting (with the blessed exception of the interludes standing in the toilet queue), that we gobbled our meals rather than taking the time to savor the chef's creations.\\n\\nNormally, I would enjoy desert and coffee following the meal, but by then it was well after 10:00PM and we still had to walk back to the Copley Place garage and drive home. Hence, we requested the check and settled up our account.  \\n\\nAs we were leaving, one of the waitresses - not the ma√Ætre d' - apologized for the saga of the evening, explaining that the restaurant had been running a promotion and that everyone came at once.  This seemed a little odd because it appeared that most of the diners had reservations and that the restaurant must have had a good idea of the number of customers to expect.  If the promotion was to increase dollar sales, it would appear to have been successful; but if it was intended to introduce new customers to Petit Robert Bistro in the hope of building repeat business, it was a dismal failure - and may have soured many existing customers in the process.\\n\\nIt is very unusual that I write to any establishment and I intentionally let a week pass to allow some perspective on the experience. It was my hope that time would mute my memories of the evening but did not.  Hence, I sent a courteous letter expressing much of what I have written above.  Now, two months latter, I have received no response, either by mail or by phone.\\n\\nIn summary, our experience at Petit Robert Bistro may have been the worst dining experience I have had in the past decade and something for which any establishment should be deeply ashamed.  \\n\\nI shall not return."},{"name":"The Waffle Window","address":"4708 NW Bethany Blvd","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"The staff was super friendly!

I wanted to have dinner in Decatur, so I decided to give Sun in my Belly a try. I made reservations for 6:15 p.m. When I arrived at the restaurant, the greeter couldn't seem to find my reservation in the system. Once he found the reservation, I still had to wait for five minutes before I was seated. After being seated, I waited for 15 minutes before a server came to my table and asked me if I even wanted something to drink. The server wasn't warm or welcoming at all. She was cold and careless. I asked for water and soup because I was waiting for a guest. The soup arrived in a timely manner, but once my guest arrived, the service got progressively worse. My guest and I placed orders for appetizers, and proceeded to wait an HOUR!!! People who came in after us were seated and served while we sat and drank water out of small mason jars. The server never even came back to check on us. After about an hour and ten minutes, I asked to speak to our server. She came into the serving area, and never even looked our way. She served everyone else around us. At that point, I had had it! Enough was enough! My guest and I got up, went to the check out area, and canceled our order. My server was in the front, and with a sarcastic look on her face, dryly asked me what the issue was. I told her that the wait was unreasonable and that no one even checked on me or my guest while we waited for an exorbitant amount of time. She snobbishly said, \\"Oh, sorry to hear that. The soup is on us.\\" She wasn't moved at all that her service was less than subpar and that money was walking out of the door. I intend to call and speak to a manager tomorrow. I would also like to talk to an owner. I would love for the owner/owners to know that they have rude and callous people working within the establishment. When the product is good, but the service is bad, the business won't last. I will never go to Sun in my Belly again!!! I went about fifty feet away to Wahoo Grill.

When we entered the dog area, it was clear that my pup Harley was by far the smallest dog there which had me a little worried. I let him off the leash, to walk around, and he was very timid at first. I felt like an overprotective mother on the playground, following him around. Soon after, something miraculous happened. Harley started socializing with the other dogs. They were all very well behaved and played with him gently. \\n\\nMy friend arrived and we grabbed coffee and stood outside in the yard watching our pups play. The culture here is extremely dog friendly. Everyone treats every dog as if it were there own.

As I often mention, I keep to a mostly plant-based diet, and my daughter is 100% vegetarian, so we both love going to Casa de Luz: their menu is always vegan, organic, gluten-free, and delicious!\\n\\nIf you haven't been before, upon arrival you'll be first treated to beautiful landscaping, with greenery decorating a long walkway leading up to the front door. Inside, the lighting is kept dim, and strings of lights hang from the ceiling. The effect is soft and relaxing. Overall, the whole vibe of the restaurant is earthy and centered on wellness, with an Ayurvedic proverb painted above the entrance: \\"When diet is wrong, medicine is of no use. When diet is correct, medicine is of no need.\\" American healthcare system, take note.\\n\\nAnother special part of visiting Casa de Luz is that they serve only one meal at mealtimes, rotating with each day of the week. It might seem odd that you don't get to choose what you eat from a menu of many choices, but the simplicity of it is actually a refreshing experience--one less thing to worry about in your day.\\n\\nWe helped ourselves to self-serve soup and salad as we waited for our meals to be brought out. The soup consisted of butternut squash, zucchini, and cabbage seasoned with cilantro, pepper, and tamari, a type of premium soy sauce made with extra soybeans. It was light but still flavorful, perfect as the autumn night dipped into the upper 60s (brrr!). The salad was mixed greens in a sunflower mint dressing. The greens were crisp and fresh, and even though there was a lot of dressing on them, the taste of it was rich and cool, not at all overwhelming.\\n\\nWhen our meal was served, it was a plate of four items: brown rice topped with a parsley sauce, pinto beans, gorditas, and blanched greens under a layer of walnut dill sauce, plus a small amount of pickled radish. The rice and beans were pretty standard, but cooked well. It seemed like the blanched greens didn't have any kind of added seasoning, but the walnut dill sauce really elevated them to a new level--the savory nuttiness was heavy and satisfying, almost creamy.\\n\\nHowever, the gorditas were without a doubt the winner of the night. They were small corn tortilla pouches filled with mixed veggies, guacamole, pickled cabbage, and cilantro. Flavor-wise, most notable were the smooth, salted-just-right guacamole and tart vinegary punch from the pickled cabbage. We thought they were absolutely heavenly!\\n\\nAll in all, the meal was not overly filling but still full of flavor, and densely nutritious. You can even immediately feel your body break into a standing ovation for feeding it so well. The restaurant also offers an array of healthy dessert options ranging from puddings to fruit tarts, but we passed on those for the night. Since Casa de Luz is one of our favorites, we will definitely enjoy dessert during a future visit."},{"name":"Dalo's Kitchen","address":"1533 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Pretty good Ethiopian food and they even had a live band the night we dined there.

The idea is really nice, but in a town with 3 Flour locations, you simply have to make better sticky buns to have them on your menu. [-0.5 star]\\n\\nThe brunch menu is fairly big, so it can be a little tough to pick what you want! Service was pretty hilarious -- our waiter advised me not to get a couple items on the menu (such as the hash -- comes with ground beef, not corned beef or steak). Very nice person, and the team kept our coffees and waters topped off. Super relaxed brunch with a well oiled team.\\n\\nFrench toast was outstanding -- probably the best I've had in Boston so far. Nicely sweet and incredibly moist -- actually wet in the middle. Apple compote isn't my bag of tea (can have some funky flavors IMHO), but the core french toast technique more than made up for it. Recommended!\\n\\nA spinach omelet was interesting -- basically they plated the sauteed greens and then put a single layer of egg on top of it. The eggs were a little overdone (dried out). Probably should avoid.\\n\\nAnother highlight of the meal though were the little potatoes that came with the omelet in a small cast iron Straub ramekin. These were excellent and must have been cooked in some sort of meat fat. Addictive.\\n\\nCoffee was very good but not great -- nice hotel coffee. Interior of the restaurant was pretty hotel-y, what with the funky hotel lounge music and no interior windows. I had trouble imagining how they can convert into a steakhouse at night. The nice thing is the room is pretty spacious, so you can slowly wake up over coffee without feeling caged and claustrophobic (cough cough Mike & Patty's).\\n\\nAll in all, a bit pricey at $55 for brunch for 2, but it was a great way to wake up on a lazy Sunday.

The problem is that with all the better choices in Boston, at this price point, I may never give them another chance.  \\nWe came here for the lunch special and were seated promptly without reservation.  The dining room was almost empty because it was hardly 1130 but during the visit only about 3 other tables  were seated. My guest and I ordered the 3course $22 prix fixe. I anticipated an excellent value based on the location's reputation.  This place occupies the space which once housed the Federalist, a Boston institution known worldwide for its wine list. For startersI went with the  the tar tar which was very good.  The Steak Frites, which I ordered rare came out nearly well done.  This would not have normally been a mortal sin, since steak gets cooked off temp all the time.  Normally how it works is steak gets cooked burnt or undercooked and then sent back, it happens all the time even in the best of places.  The issue was that after finally getting the attention of our absentee server and informing him that both our steaks were burnt no attempts were made to reconcile.  We were simply served our dessert which, by the way, looked like it fell off a food distributor truck. Because I had to make an appointment I had actually paid in cash during the middle of service so that we could make a quick exit. For this reason I asked to see the manager, explaining my issue with the two burnt steaks.  When she finally arrived she had not been explained our issue nor did she make any inquisitions, I feel as if she may have been a hostess just promoted to supervisor, she certainly did not yet have the experiance to be a manager in a high end restaurant.  To her credit it seemed to be lack of training rather than inexperience that made the situation less bearable.  After the fiasco we did actually get our money back, thats a first for me in a fine dining establishment. I realize that my experiance was bad and that this place probably only kicks into top gear during dinner - but please if you are in town visiting beacon hill don't waste your money, go to Beacon Hill Bistro down the street or if you want a pure steakhouse for similar money get in a cab and ask to go to Grille 23, Morton's, Abe&Louies, Capital Grill, etc."},{"name":"Park's Edge","address":"913 Bernina Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Park's Edge is the place to go when you want to relax and enjoy great food.

Although the first two times I went the food was amazing, I will never be back to this particular Tasty Burger after my visit this past Thursday.\\n\\nLet me tell you, there were about 4/5 workers occupying the cooking space and that was way too many. In theory, I can understand if it gets packed (which I'm sure it does), every cook is needed, however, it was pretty empty (with only 2 other people aside from my family). Due to this, they formed a huge circle, wasting time and being inappropriate (language and physical motions). They took way too long to make the food, way too much standing around, and way too much inappropriate discussion without proper attention to the food. One of the guys cooking went to wipe down the area where the onion rings are placed and he used a rag to clean the space but also used that same rag to clean off some cooking device. I'm such a germ freak that I really didn't like that, but what made things worse for me is when this same guy was preparing a man's box of onion rings, he dropped a bunch on that dirty, germy counter, and put it in that man's box anyways. For me, if I were working there (and I do work with food myself) those onion rings would've went in the garbage, not in someone's box. Even my mom turned to me and said, \\"are those OUR onion rings?\\" and although I felt bad for the man, I reassured her they weren't. Also, during this time some girl (who I presume based on her relationship with all the workers .. was an off the clock employee) was in the cooking area distracting the workers, touching food, and requesting that they make her some food and a drink. This disturbed me because I just saw her come from Dudley Station where the buses are and anyone who knows this community knows how FILTY Dudley Station is. Therefore, she shouldn't have been touching anything without washing her hands. I watched her come from outside and go directly to the grill space. She did not even wash her hands! If I hadn't already paid for my food I would've stormed out of there. Thank God my parents and I didn't get sick. ALSO, the cashier girl kept playing in her long ponytail. What is the point of having your employees keep their hair up if they keep touching it? I prayed my food didn't have hair in it since she kept running her fingers through it and packing everyone's food. Thank God I didn't have hair in it. I feel like I avoided a lot of sickness on this particular day and I will take this second chance at good health as an opportunity to NEVER come back to this branch of Tasty Burger. I thought it was doing my community a great service to finally have some good fast food nearby but I was wrong. What happened to the polite cooks that used to be there? What happened to the cashiers who cared about being hygienic when packing your food? What happened to proper management who regulate who's in the cooking stations? What happened to having fun WHILE actually working?\\n\\nAdvice to upper management, if you really want this particular branch to last a long time, you need to hire manager who is unbiased and willing to regulate their workers. When I went Thursday evening (May 25) I couldn't tell if there was even a manager on duty based on how disgusting and inappropriate everyone was in there. Please get on top of making sure there is a manager to keep that filthy handed off duty girl from the cooking station and making sure that the employees are actually working. Also, when you hire this manager, make sure he/she is not afraid to tell the cashier to stop playing in her hair and pulling strains out because this is gross. Vulgar language is also a huge no no. This isn't the Cheesecake Factory, but I did pay a pretty penny for my food, only to take it home, be afraid to eat it, and realize there wasn't even lettuce on my burger. Even my dad said his burger wasn't NASTY but it was not as GOOD as it usually is. I'd rather take the 30 minute drive to the Fenway location.

You can either order off the menu or do the buffet. The options on the menu were kind of weird - I had trouble just finding a basic breakfast dish that I really wanted. So I chose the $22 buffet. I had a made-to-order omelet that was a bit underwhelming to be honest, some fruit and a little pastry, plus coffee. My waiter had pity on me and charged me for the continental buffet (which I didn't even see listed) since I didn't really eat very much. That was something more like $16. In all, I'd say the breakfast was OK but certainly not much I'd write home about.\\n\\nI stopped in again one evening with two friends for a drink, and again I found it confusing.

I live down the street, and came in on a Thursday night with a couple of my friends for a couple beers and some food. We planned to sit at the bar but since there was some event which took up half the bar, we opted for a high-top table near the bar. We ordered some beers from the server when she finally came over. To our surprise the beers came out very quickly. We proceeded to place our food order and that's when it really went downhill. Upon our first sip of the beer, we knew we did not get what we ordered, an IPA does not taste like a lager, but by then it was too late as our server was now be nowhere to be found. A couple of us just sucked it up and drank our wrong beer, as we were quite thirsty, the other had to exchange his wrong beer at the bar, to which the bartenders were more than happy to oblige. Our food took close to an hour for wings, chowder, a burger, and a sandwich, unacceptable. When we finally got the food the wings were dry and cold, the chowder had a congealed film on it, and the burger was crunchy and way overcooked (was ordered medium, came out very well done). I might have said something had our server came back around, but waiting another hour for the kitchen to remake it would have probably put me off the idea. We ate what we could stomach since we were very hungry after waiting an hour and grabbed the check as soon as the waitress was found again.\\n\\nNeedless to say it was not an overall pleasant experience. Having come to BBG quite a few times before, I knew their food has always mediocre at best, but this was a new low.

Really the perfect way to unwind with friends after a long week.\\n\\n9/28/07\\nI finally had the Vino Vino experience that I have been hearing about.

My flight had been delayed earlier in the day messing up dinner plans and since I didn't get to my hotel until just before 9:30, I thought the on premise (inside the Marriott) Riverbend Bar and Grill was my best bet.  It's inside the lobby and is actually quite large with a lounge area, dining room and bar.  Since it was late I plopped down at the bar and immediately got a water.\\n\\nFor dinner on this evening I decided to order the steak tips, medium.  According to the menu it consisted of herb marinated steak tips along with some French fries and asparagus.  It came to the table somewhere between 15 - 20 minutes after ordering and looked pretty good.  I first tried the steak which ended up being interesting.  It had the charred flavor on the outside but maybe a little too much so as that overpowered the meal with its bitterness and I could still taste it afterwards.  They were also different sized pieces and so I think they were all cooked to a different temperature.  Whenever I got to the middle of the meat though it was pretty tasty.  The fries for the meal were a bit limp and could have used some seasoning.  Last but not least was the asparagus which I think was covered in a salt, thyme and butter sauce.  That made it absolutely delicious although some of the asparagus ended up being stringy when cutting it, almost like a celery, leading me to believe the smaller pieces were overcooked as well.\\n\\nThe bottom line for me is that I may head back here again in the future.  My food was decent and while there was a little something I didn't like with each item, it had potential."},{"name":"Fuji Sushi Japanese Cuisine","address":"1449 Lee Rd","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"The food was great, service was wonderful.

If so many other Yelpers hadn't left reviews praising the food I would say it must just be down to its prime location (right outside the skytrain station).\\n\\nI'm big on d√©cor and ambiance, and while this place wasn't at all shabby, I found it pretty bland and a bit severe. When I feel content to be in a place even before my food comes, I know it has good ambiance; at Ki I wasn't content even while eating. It just wasn't the kind of place I could really settle into. I could be wrong, but I remember a lot of dark wood and dark colors, without nearly enough bright color and warm lighting to balance things out.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the food was also a bit disappointing. My father and I ordered several different types of rolls (one special roll and the rest off the core menu) and none of them were all that great. They were dry, not particularly big, and not overly flavorful. Plus, enough rolls for a satisfying meal was more expensive at Ki than it would have been at several other sushi places in New West (such as Okonomi or Kojima). I think it would be difficult to have a satisfying dinner here for under $18-$20.    \\n\\nBottom line: of the ten or so sushi places I've tried in the Vancouver area, Ki is my least favorite. It has the subpar rolls of a much cheaper restaurant, without the cheaper price tag. I might give it a second try, but definitely only for lunch, so I won't be wasting as much money if it's disappointing again."},{"name":"Dhaba Joy","address":"2900 Guadalupe St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Freaking yummy stuff right there!!\\n\\nI love Dhaba  Joy SO much\\n\\nIf you go there buy one of everything!

I think the spicy orange sauce is fantastic, the salmon nigiri is perfect and the spicy tuna is delicious. The fried rice and chicken they have on the buffet is also very tasty. I've only ever eaten off the buffet, so I can't really comment on anything else there. I don't ever get anything other than water to drink, I made the mistake of getting Coke the first time I went. They give you a small can of coke and a glass of ice. Refills aren't free for anything other than water. While the lighting may be sketchy and low, I haven't found it to be a problem while eating. And the employees do yell, but not at each other or customers, they're just simply yelling out which plates need to be refilled on the buffet in Japanese. There is also a very sweet man who will yell out arigato as you leave, he is very interesting if you take the time to chat with him.

The other option (at a sit down restaurant) is you are stuck with a to-go box and have to remember to eat it in time.\\n\\nNoodles & co has a wide variety of dishes and lot of customizable extra protein options (chicken, beef, tofu, pork etc), so you can have a wholesome meal. My personal tip.. if you are an adult and do not get enough veggies, then dont waste your money on the Wisc mac and cheese. other than that, their japanese and indonesian options are quite good with grilled chicken. \\n\\nService is nice and the price is correct, competitive with Chipotle etc. Also, they dont push you to get drinks unlike in a sit down restaurant. \\nThey have a decent ambient setting to sit down with friends and enjoy your meal.

There wasn't a wait to be seated, but there was a water main issue, which they were able to figure out in 5 minutes before they seated us. I have to say, the dinner and beer prices are really affordable. $3-6 draft beers for local brews is unheard of in a restaurant and definitely not at a bar. Food was SO on point. We ordered an appetizer and beers to start. \\nSalmon dip - nothing too special, but it was a simple starter to a great meal ahead. It also went well with our beers. It was a part of the weekly supper club specials. \\nCocoa & Espresso braised beef short ribs - omg. Extremely tender and rich in flavor. I wasn't expecting much from a dinner entree under $15 at a restaurant predominantly known for their brunch  options. The sides were tasty - but the marinade on the short ribs? I had to be held down to keep from picking up the plate and licking it clean. \\nFried Chicken - came with Mac and cheese and greens. While it wasn't as mind blowing as the beef short ribs, it had a crispy but not too thick breading. Definitely satisfies any fried chicken craving. \\nOf course, we also had to order a dessert. The strawberry shortcake bread pudding was a rich and slightly sweet dessert that we downed pretty quickly. It isn't what you would typically think of as a bread pudding, but it was buttery and delicious. \\n\\nBrunch - 3.5 stars\\n\\nThere was no wait on Memorial Day Monday around 1pm, which was pretty surprising. We were back to get a taste of the highly anticipated brunch menu. It was definitely busier than our dinner here but not packed. Service was definitely slower that day - our server was pretty slow. \\nWe were able to finally make our order in the noisy dining area, after the server described the special to us - The Hangover, which was basically a glorified egg McMuffin. She pointed out they weren't serving the Belly Benedict, which was really all I wanted. They only served it on weekends, and even though it was Memorial Day (Monday), they weren't serving it. I ended up ordering Alison's famous pimento cheese omelette. Both dishes were just ok, although the honey glazed bacon was PERFECTION. Too bad there wasn't more of it in the omelette. The pimento cheese left a greasy mess trailing all over the omelette and plate. It was tasty but just too much pimento cheese (is that even possible??). The biscuit we ordered on the side, on the other hand, was delicious. The strawberry preserves that we drizzled on top of the soft, warm biscuit was to die for. \\n\\nOverall, brunch was just ok. Nothing special that we needed to drive all the way down here for. But the DINNER menu is what threw us off and has officially made this our go-to dinner spot.

Unfortunately, it was downhill from there.\\n\\nI opted for the spring greens salad, which consisted of a pile of greens topped with unattractive blobs of goat cheese.  That's it.  No tasty tomatoes, red onions, or other accompaniments.  Very blas√© . \\nThe scallop entree also failed to delight.  The scallops were fine, but the fingerling potatoes were overcooked and tough.  The mushrooms didn't add anything to the dish, except for the fact that they turned the liquid on the plate a totally unappetizing brownish, brackish color.\\nThe chocolate layer cake I chose for dessert was very rich (just the way I like my cake), and I suspect they used a bit of coffee or espresso in the batter to bring out the richness of the chocolate.  Yummy.\\n\\nOverall, though, this steakhouse is nothing to get excited over.  Maybe I made some poor dish selections, so if I'm ever privileged enough to give them another shot, I certainly will offer another review.\\n\\nFor now, the review I offer is two stars for the food, supplemented by an extra star for the service."},{"name":"Turf N Surf Po' Boy","address":"407 Lavaca St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I'M CONFUSED\\n\\nHow is EVERTHING here so Good.

To the Yelp  community: stop throwing around five star ratings. This is not a five star restaurant. This is not a four star restaurant. This was my worst dining experience in recent memory. You've misled me and I'll never forgive you. Same to you, Zagat.\\n\\nBooked a Saturday night table and reserved a duck for my girlfriend's birthday. I was very excited and the reviews I've read bolstered my confidence. I was ready for a unique meal featuring local ingredients.\\n\\nThe restaurant was quiet and intimate - though pretty empty for a Saturday night at 9. We were seated and our water was filled. That was the extent of service for the first ten minutes (I was a waiter once, I clocked it). We looked around the room trying to figure out the decor choices. A barnstar? Fake candles? Egregiously uncomfortable chairs? Mere oddities in light of what should be a delicious meal, right?\\n\\nWe were brought two bread rolls a piece - lovely, someone noticed we're here. Stale and flavorless. Perhaps this was to highlight the butter. I have no respect for a place that serves bad bread. ESPECIALLY one with French leanings. It's so, so easy.\\n\\nOur waitress finally arrived and inquired about drinks. I picked a French wine that was the only highlight of the evening.\\n\\nBefore our appetizers were brought out, we were presented with two small bowls of a creamed corn soup with caramel popcorn. Bad start. Flavorless soup and soggy corn...just a weird combination. We were confused but still excited for the  appetizers - a citrus trout tartare and a fried egg risotto with snails and mushrooms.\\n\\nThe presentation of these dishes was outstanding - truly beautiful with colorful spring flowers dancing on our plate. Then we both took bites. The tartare was served with what could only be described as Red Lobster popcorn fish bites and the overall flavor was...totally non-present. The fried egg tasted as though the snails were killed with Salts and the whole dish was like eating salted lead. This is not summer menu fare, so why is it on the menu?\\n\\nThoroughly disappointed at this point -- with no one to tell. Our waitress had disappeared and the bus boy had no mind to inquire why our plates were basically untouched. Back to the wine, pray for mind-blowing duck.\\n\\nOur duck was presented then carved in front of us. The skin was crispy and sweet, but the meat was under whelming and a bit dry. It was served with a roasted pear, which was nice, but to the people raving about the stuffing -\\nyou are insane. It was soggy chunks of plain bread and further detracted from the meal. Turnips and carrots continued to weigh it down. Again, how is this summer fare?\\n\\nDisheartened, we stopped eating and a puzzled busser asked if he could clear the table. Yes. Our waitress, smiling, returned and offered dessert menus. I explained that we were to this point terribly disappointed with our meal and would forego dessert (something she would have learned after our first bite had she been around) and she offered to bring the chef out. I've never needed to speak to a chef before at a \\"five star\\" restaurant with a 27 Zagat rating.\\n\\n15 minutes elapse.\\n\\nShe brings OUR CHECK.\\n\\nShe explains that he is very busy (No. He's not. There's no one here, he just doesn't want to be held accountable in the dining room.) and I follow her to the packed kitchen. I explain to the chef that I had such high hopes for this special occasion and now my girlfriend's birthday was essentially ruined. The appetizers we bland and over-salted, respectively. (He claims people have raved about the egg.) He is holding back a smirk the entire time, clearly too accomplished as a chef and owner to have his meal called into question. He explains that I should not have eaten it if I did not like it (was he checking the busboy upon return?). I told him we did not eat the appetizers and no one asked if we were enjoying it. He offers nothing but \\"I'm sorry it was not to your taste. I'll look into the service.\\" Which is a pompous chef's way of saying, \\"I'm sorry you don't have fine taste.\\" He looked at me like I was a kid trying to get a free meal to impress his girlfriend. Please.\\n\\nBoth my girlfriend and I have been fortunate to dine at 2 and 3-Star Michelin\\nrestaurants in France and hole-in-the-wall burger joint gems. We know good\\nfood and good service. Salts represented neither. We've had much finer meals at\\nRendezvous down the street at a fraction of the cost. Salts was uninspired\\nand bland, at best. I was THRILLED we did not get the tasting menu.\\n\\nThis is the issue with a chef being the owner. He did not offer to comp any of the dishes we did not eat, he had no interest in asking, \\"what could we have done better?\\" I have never been so irritated with how I was treated at a restaurant.

I do enjoy short rib and it was one of the seasonal specials. I should have gotten a steak but since it was Sullivans and I have heard good things, I took my chances.

There is no seating at this restaurant. There is no door to this restaurant. There is no inside to this restaurant. This place is literally a DENT in the wall, it's so tiny.\\n\\nI order the fried chicken poutine, which consisted of fries, cheese curds, white and brown gravy, and buffalo chicken pieces (for the record, I was asked if I wanted green onion on top, but I declined).\\n\\nThe chicken and poutine was definitely an interesting mix. All in all, all three necessary components of the poutine (fries, cheese, gravy) were passable in flavour. I was slightly disappointed at the amount of cheese curds in my poutine, but maybe Fritz and elsewhere has spoiled me.\\n\\nThese guys really aren't bad. If they opened up a location out my way, I would definitely be a regular, as their poutine definitely beats out KFC, New York Fries, and other fast food chain options that surround me. However, with places like La Belle Patate and the like just steps away, Mean Poutine just fades into the background."},{"name":"Fuji Sushi Japanese Cuisine","address":"1449 Lee Rd","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"I really enjoyed this sushi place.

Whether it is lunch, dinner, or happy hour, you can expect a somewhat diverse crowd (though in most cases, this place will tend to attract the same clientele as the III Forks, Ruth Chris, and Trulucks of downtown - you just won't feel obligated to wear a jacket or button down and may spend a little less on your meal.)\\n\\nDuring lunch, you can get a soup / salad and entr√©e for $20 (called the \\"Business Lunch\\"), or you can opt for fairly large portioned sandwiches for under $14.  Yes, the food is relatively pricey outside of HH, but you are at a steakhouse - what did you expect?  On a related note, I have never been particularly impressed with the steak here, so if you are wanting a steak, you should look elsewhere.  The only beef I would advise choosing on their menu is the burger.\\n\\nI love the French onion soup here.  I have never particularly cared for French onion soup.  So let me be perfectly clear when I reiterate that I love the French onion soup at Sullivan's.  Hell, I would be hard-pressed not to love something with a half-inch layer of broiled cheese, sitting atop the usual beef broth / caramelized onions combo.\\n\\nA far as appetizers go, we usually start with the calamari.  It is prepared with a sweet and spicy thai chile sauce and is very good -- almost as good as the calamari at Eddie V's in my opinion, which is prepared in a similar manner. \\n\\nI also like the burger here (go with the gruyere!)  -- especially with the $5 happy hour price tag attached.

Apparently, it is only a weekend item and I was quite disappointed.  Getting over that initial disappointment, though, I began to look at the menu.  The menu is somewhat new-age in what it offers in rethinking the southern menu items, but it fits the Bohemian atmosphere that pervades throughout the many layers of the interior.  After some thought as to what we were going to eat, we decided on the following:\\n\\nSteak and eggs\\nShrimp and Grits\\n\\nYes, Shrimp and Grits...it just sounds odd, but it was something that I had to try.  I almost didn't get it, but I sucked up the courage and ordered it.  I didn't know that I would ever get the chance again.  When the meal arrived I was somewhat stunned at the presentation -- it was a bowl filled with cheese grits and shrimp that had been sauteed in stewed tomatoes and spices.  Very simple in its presentation.  Feeling rather demure about eating this concoction, I took a bite of the grits and found that they were amazingly awesome.  I didn't want to ruin that flavor and so had a bit of the steak.  It was okay -- tad over-seasoned.  The eggs were eggs, quite difficult to ruin them unless you just don't cook them properly.  \\n\\nI returned to my dish and went for the shrimp this time.  They were not rubbery and the flavor was good.  Happiness was setting in.  Then came the big leap as I picked up some of the shrimp with some of the tomato and grits.  The flavors just melded into my mouth.  Whereas the shrimp and tomato might have been a bit over-seasoned, the smoothness in the cheese grits mellowed them enough to make a cool Jazz party in your mouth.  I ate they entire meal.  \\n\\nI WILL return here.  I have to return here.  I might not order the shrimp and grits on every trip, but I do love the grits and I really want to try the biscuits and gravy!"},{"name":"Grill 23 & Bar","address":"161 Berkeley St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Sorry but $14 for a titos and soda is absolute highway robbery.

Located on Charles Street in Beacon Hill, it's narrow but cozy inside and it's a nice, casual spot to grab a pie. We had a reservation, which I would recommend given the popularity of this place, and we were seated quite quickly. As we looked over the menu, it was clear by observing the tables around us that the turnaround time was pretty short from ordering to getting the food to the table.\\n\\nGiven the name, I assumed that the fig and prosciutto pizza was the most popular one but our waiter indicated that Red Sox with his favorite. It had tomato sauce, roasted red peppers, caramelized onions, mozzarella, Italian sausage, and a lemon aioli drizzle. I was skeptical about the sauce as I don't typically like a lot of sauce on my food, and definitely not topping my pizza. But, this actually worked quite well. The pizza was so flavorful and well seasoned, from the meat to the red sauce, to the veggies on top. \\n\\nWe opted to split the pie with half Red Sox and half Bronx Bomber, which was essentially cheese pizza topped with pepperoni and basil. Pepperoni pizza is a classic so it was great to try their version of it. Large pieces of deli sliced pepperoni topped the mozzarella cheese. The crust was thin but it remained crispy, particularly under the Red Sox portion.\\n\\nPizzas are primarily between $20 and $25. They also offer appetizers that are hearty such as chicken parmesan sliders and meatball sliders, as well as salads, pasta dishes, entrees, and a few sides. We tried the garlic, rosemary and parmesan fries, which were very underwhelming with packaged parmesan cheese sprinkled on top and whole sprigs of rosemary. We did not detect any garlic, salt, or pepper, all of which those fries needed.\\n\\nThe service was swift and adequate but certainly not overly friendly. The efficiency was good here.

Then comes the appetizer, which is a chicken/lentil pie in phi-lo dough covered in powdered sugar. Sounds bizarre, but is very tasty. Then came our entree and I had the Lamb skewers over basmati rice, and my wife had the lamb shank. Both were exceptionally tasty and well seasons and the portion sizes were extremely generous. My wife had to take some home for lunch the next day. And to top it all off, we had a coconut custard for dessert along with a flavorful sweet tea which they serve with a flourish. \\n\\nAll in all a fantastic meal, extremely friendly and helpful waitstaff and very good value for the price. Would definitely recommend. My only issues with the restaurant (and they are fairly minor), is that there aren't really any choices in what you get for starters or dessert, so you may be stuck with a dish you might not care for (*I don't like salsa, so their salad wasn't really appealing to me, though the babagannush was good and I am not a fan of coconut, so the dessert fell a bit flat for me even though it was well made and tasted okay). Plus it was during the week, so there was no bellydancing... that might have bumped it up to a five star :)"},{"name":"Sun in My Belly","address":"2161 College Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Velvet ropes and Dominatrices\\n\\ngotta concur with Zach below.

The house coffee is a little weak but adding a couple shots makes a mean Jumpin' Java for a good price. And if you get to the shop early enough, there's a great selection of tasty pastries and doughnuts. The cream cheese danish tastes like eating cheesecake for breakfast! Variety is one of Papaccino's strong points. There's lots of drinks (coffee, tea, juice, kombucha, etc.) and choices of milk (Hemp, soy, cow, almond) as well as a cereal bar, sweet treats, bagels, breakfast sandwiches, paninis, fruit, hard-boiled eggs, and more. Don't forget to download the Perka app on your smart phone so you can earn free coffees and pastries. \\n\\nI usually get our coffee to go so I can drink it while I finish waking up at home, but sometimes I take advantage of the ample outdoor seating that flanks both sides of the shop.

If I'm dog sitting, I can tie the dog up to the bike rack near the door and wait for my coffee to be ready without worrying that she's okay because the floor to ceiling glass windows facing Woodstock Blvd. allow me to check on her from anywhere near the counter. There's a ton of cozy indoor seating with lots of comfortable armchairs, couches, and tables as well as a kid's play area in the back corner that's separated from the main floor by a short wall. Papaccino's is family friendly, but the way the play area is constructed keeps kids out from under the feet of other customers and keeps the noise level down. It's nice to visit a true independent neighborhood coffee shop that has a relaxing and friendly vibe thanks to the awesome baristas, good-natured crowd of regular customers, and variety of seating, food, and drinks.

(let's hear it for roasting veggies in duck fat!) i was amazed at the perfect presentation of the duck itself, which they carve only after showing you your order whole on a platter. also be forewarned that this was a huge meal. huge. you may think you're done, and ready for desert, until they ask you whether you would like some more duck. we barely finished ours, and seconds, my friends, easily dissuaded us from ordering desert, despite an incredible looking menu. \\nalthough this place is a bit pricey, i will also pass on the high praise that led me to seek it out. reservations are recommended, as the restaurant is so small, and when you make said reservation, you may also want to pre-order the duck, as the matron of the establishment mentioned that they serve a limited number each night, and often run out. i'd like to think of this restaurant as the type of place i would go for a thanksgiving dinner, if i weren't cooking for myself. their food is straightforward, hearty, and rich, when you definitely need a little comfort-food pampering on a cold day."},{"name":"Aashirwad Indian Food and Bar","address":"7000 S Kirkman Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"Very slow service.

For such a classy and expensive place, it was surprising to see a diner in the late evening wearing a turquoise hooded sweatshirt.  There needs to be some semblance of a dress code.  To their credit, the table was ready at the 7:30 reservation time and they were kind enough to allow us to warm up at the bar and delay our seating for 10 or so minutes.  The service was friendly and knowledgeable about the food and pairings with wine.  However the food was mediocre at best.  The fried calamari appetizer had no special spicing and was served on a very thin layer of what I assume was tartar sauce - not nearly enough to spread on each piece of calamari, so the majority of it was basically plain breaded squid.  The crab cake appetizer was as crunchy as a falafel - I don't know if this was the intended preparation, but a good crab cake to me is moist and flakey.  Not to mention the crab cakes were topped with some chopped pickled vegetable and again served on a thin layer of mustard sauce not nearly enough to mask the taste of \\"pickled\\".  The steaks everyone in the party ordered were all very good, but they damn well better be!

Would love if they offered a vegetarian version of the tacos, but there does seem to be enough things that a vegetarian could eat (my son is one so I always check the menu for him). For vegans, there is a hummus option to go with the soft pretzels, as well as a salad that could easily be ordered without cheese.

Having said that...\\n\\nAppetizers were good. We shared Crispy Shanghai Calamari (which came glazed with some sort of yummy sweetish sauce already on it), Chilled Seafood Sampler (Chilled Stone Crab, Shrimp Cocktail & Oysters on the Half Shell, Jumbo Lump Crabmeat & Avocado Haba√±ero Salsa) -- this was good and the oysters were fresh and yes, for $48 this was expected!! Cheese Steak Egg Rolls (very good!). Other than the seafood such good appetizers can be gotten elsewhere...so yeah sorry but not wow'd. \\n\\nNext...The Shrimp & Lobster Bisque was okay -- it seemed overly buttery and not so much \\"lobstery\\". So a bit on the rich side for me. Finally for the entree I had the 8oz Filet Mignon maybe I made a mistake and should have gotten the 12oz or 16oz? But this was not your \\"cut with a butter knife\\" steak...it was dry and hard, even though it was pink in the middle. For a high end steak house it was unacceptable simply because as a steak house the signature is the steak. \\n\\nFor those of you who may be going to this place for the first time, its a classic steak house this means sides are \\"family style\\" meaning the size is 2 servings and they are extra $. I thought the sides were okay. We shared the White Cheddar Au Gratin Potatoes (ok, kind of bland), Steakhouse skillet mushrooms (mushrooms weren't extremely fresh), tempura onion rings (artery clogging good, as they should be!), 3-cheese mac with garlic butter crust (by the time this dish got to me it wasn't warm anymore....so meh), and the Crab fired rice (pretty good). \\n\\nAll in all it was good meal, but not as good as a $120/person meal. If you are entertaining clients and paying with the company card go for it, if you're spending your own money I can think of many places in Austin that would give you more taste bud tantalizing experience for the same price or less.

If you have a lit cigarette indoors, please do me a favor and stamp it out on your eyeball. That was my sentiment every time I tried to visit The Standard. For Atlanta's highest indoor smoke density, that place gave The Clermont a run for its money. I'm pleased to say, no longer.\\n\\nThe Standard has undergone a reboot. Out of the ashes (pun intended) Young Augustine's has emerged. I'll venture to guess the remake was due in-part to the 2009 murder of their bartender, but I also think the indoor smoke played a role in their sluggish sales. According to the CDC, today, only twenty percent of Americans smoke. Let's assume, just for a minute, that non-smokers mostly prefer a non-smoking eating and drinking environment. Disenfranchising up to eighty percent of the market is generally not good for business, and I think the owners of The Standard recognized that. Apart from clearing the air, they've spruced up the interior, menu and beer list.\\n\\nThe d√©cor is dark wood and low illumination. The space is open and uncluttered. You will find a small {but intriguing} chef driven, seasonal menu featuring items like the Short Rib Grilled Cheese Shallot Sandwich, Scallion Pancakes and Duck Fat Fried Fries, all of which are good. The portions are generous, and the food is cooked precisely. Most importantly, Young Augustine's features a rotating, twenty eight tap, craft brew selection that would give any beer connoisseur pause. If The Brick Store Pub is the gold standard, Young Augustine's shares the silver with The Porter in L5P. It's definitely worth a visit.

Although not initially intrigued at the prospect of Italian and Asian cuisine together....the execution was perfect.  The ambiance was perfect and polished.  Our server was friendly, helpful and was knowledgeable when directing us to wine...I got exactly what I asked for when advice was sought.  The appetizers could have been entr√©es (not in size, but in complexity and quality), I recommend the Moo Shi Duck over scallion pancake with hoisin glaze...amazing.  The scallion pancake was a surprise and was more of a biscuit, but it worked perfectly and had an amazing flavor reminiscent of scallion pancakes, but better.  For entr√©es we had the catch in a bag and the pork chop Milanese, which were both grand slams.  The pork chop was the best I've ever had in terms of tenderness, done-ness and taste (quite a statement).  The sauce and cheese were perfect compliments and made for a decadent dish.  As for the catch in a bag, which on this day was filet of sole with a shrimp glass noodle stuffing, pan seared & roasted in an edible rice paper served with Asian vegetables & hoisin glaze.  This dish was AMAZING.  The fish was so fresh, not a hint of fishy smell, just a clean deep water flavor accompanied by thai basil, cilantro & ginger.  This dish could be easily over salted, but the chef seasons it perfectly.  Speaking of which, chef Maxwell (last name) was kind enough to come out to our table to greet us and inquire about our food...bravo!  Downsides?  The prices are steep, but you get what you pay for, as they say.  Also the crispy wantons with foccacia served with chili duck sauce and hummus....a strange combination.  To be honest I could do without the hummus, its nothing special and is out-shined by the great tasting chili duck sauce.    I will definitely be back to maxwell's 148.

My husband had one that he described as a little spicy and loved it too. Needless to say, my daughter was raving over the one she ate. \\nOf course we looked them up right away and found out this was a local chocolatier. (Add this to my list of why I love Portland). \\nA few days later, on my daughter's birthday, she decided she didn't want birthday cake but wanted a trip to the chocolate cafe instead. Of course we obliged. The cafe is a cute little shop that displays chocolates much in the same way other places display jewelry. My daughter chose some truffles to take home and ordered a chocolate shake to have there. They have different size boxes to choose and build your own chocolate gift box. I think the single chocolate truffle mini box is adorable and would love to give or receive that as a cute little gift. My daughter chose a nine piece box (they had up to 40 pieces which cost $75). While there, I had a delicious mayan hot drinking chocolate. It was thick and rich but I really enjoyed it. \\nThe only little (eh) thing about this visit is that the workers seemed to be preoccupied.

Definitely a nice place, with nice ambience, kind of loud, but aside from all that, the food was a big disappointment!\\n\\n There was an array of 6 steaks ordered at our table, every degree of doneness, and not one of these $50 steaks was cooked properly.  Overdone, underdone, you name it.  And I get that that sometimes happens, but I'm not very understanding when it happens at a high-end STEAKHOUSE and you're paying $50 for that piece of meat a la carte.   I mean, really?  You can't even cook a steak to its proper doneness?  I do a better job myself at home! \\n\\nUnfortunately, the overpriced sides were no better.  First, how are you already out of tater tots at 7:00pm on a Saturday night????  What is this Boca???  A big early-bird rush?   Big disappointment!!  Backup hash browns were overcooked and hard.  Again, I'm expecting better than this when I'm paying $10 for that side, which in my opinion, despite what they imply, is basically enough for 1 person.  And the mashed potatoes? Who ON EARTH - IN A STEAKHOUSE, no less -  puts turkey gravy on mashed potatoes???  Yes, turkey gravy!  And the turkey gravy wasn't even that good!   You have that much faith in your mashed potatoes that you have to slather poultry gravy all over them?  Also, overpriced for the portion size.  Asparagus side was small, and again, overcooked.  Not tasty at all.  Brussel sprouts - the new fad veggie - was overcharred and pretty much inedible.  ONLY FOOD POSITIVES:  Side salads were not bad and the clam chowder was different, and yummy.

We get there exactly at 8 and are seated promptly. Ten minutes later, we place our order: 3 orders of Combo A + pasta, yam fries, fried oysters, fried shrimp w/ mayo, and garlic bread. We were told upon ordering that the fried oysters and other appies might take about 20 minutes - we were okay with that. So 20 minutes pass and there's no sign of our food, even the garlic bread isn't here yet! We follow up with the waitress about our garlic bread as that's usually the fastest thing to come and she goes into the kitchen and comes out with nothing. Another 5 minutes pass and we wave down another waitress to ask about our garlic bread. She immediately goes into the kitchen and brings out a bowl of garlic bread. I'm pretty sure they were pre-made and sitting under a warmer the entire time. We finish our garlic bread incredibly fast since at this point we were all pretty much starving. Our main dish still hasn't come yet, and when we follow up with the waitress she says that because they make each table's food one at a time, ours will be coming soon. 40 minutes after we order, our Combo As finally come. To be fair it did taste pretty decent, but without the added pasta the serving size would be really tiny. \\n\\nSo what about the appies we ordered? We followed up with the waitress AGAIN and told her that if they were going to take too long, just cancel the order. She goes into the kitchen and immediately comes out telling us that she'll cancel the yam fries because it's going to take too long, but the other appies were on their way.

WRONG!  Shrimp fresh rolls had one tiny shrimp in each, chicken and tofu was very bland and my red curry duck had 3 small pieces of duck swimming in coconut milk and bamboo shoots and green pepper. The curry itself lacked even the slightest kick of a red curry. This was a very disappointing experience and I just threw their menu in the recycling bin. Never again.

So after finally getting an order placed, we waited 45 more minutes for a half dozen raw oysters. Yes, 6 raw oysters took 45 mins to prepare at a seafood restaurant, yeah, about that. \\n\\nDuring this time at least 5 parties of people came in and received all of their food including a party of 7. After complaining to the waiter and the manager about the wait there wasn't even so much as an apology. The waiter even tried to come back with a sarcastic quip which is incredibly bold for someone who screwed up, didn't put in the order and was marginal at his job, at best. We waited another 30 mins for the actual entree which hadn't come so I had the hostess go get the manager from the kitchen. I'm sure some think this wasn't enough time but mind you during this time we watched literally 20 people who came in after us get their food which was ridiculous considering we were only 2 people.  I told the manager that we were leaving and that we would pay for the drinks and the order of oysters that we had. This was probably about 25 dollars. \\n\\nThe manager said that she would take care of the entire meal but we elected to leave.

We brought our drinks from the bar and ordered some apps. We started with East Coast oysters which were SO delicious/fresh! They came with three sauces which accompanied the oysters well. We also got the tots which were balls of deliciousness + inside there was bacon and tons of flavor. The sauce with the tots was beyond amazing. (They are great with their sauces - haha!)\\n I had one of the three specials for dinner. A petit filet mignon & asparagus with crabmeat on top - all of which had so much flavor. My SO had the surf and turf which he thought was good. Balance of meat and veggies was on point. The food was presented well!\\nOne minor thing is we realized we had to ask for bread in order to get (as a starter). We asked for them when dinner came (after we saw other tables getting them) and they never brought. But everything else was beyond amazing - our server was super cool too.

It was my dear brother's birthday and of course this was the steakhouse of choice as they have not been.\\n\\nTo start, we ordered a dozen oysters and fried calamari. The oysters were good, although it was not shucked perfectly clean. There were still some sand residue on some of them. The calamari portions were small and there were a lot of fried onion fillers in there, it comes with a side of spicy mayo which I didn't care for - I prefer the usual marinara sauce.\\n\\nFor the main course, half of us ordered the 100 Day Aged Prime Ribeye ($54). This is absolutely one of the best pieces of cow that I have ever tasted, certainly top 1-2 in my book. It beats out the Kobe Cap Steak that I have had here previously. It was cooked perfectly (medium rare), it was tender af, tasty af, just fatty enough, and there were virtually no chewy tendons. I did not touch the side of veggies and caramelized onions - it's not necessary.\\n\\nMy gf ordered the Dry Aged Prime NY Strip ($67). It was a bit overly charred and a tougher piece of meat compared to the ribeye. It was not bad, but considering it was $13 more expensive & 4oz smaller than the more delicious ribeye, without hesitation I'd wholeheartedly recommend skipping the NY strip and go for the ribeye.\\n\\nFor sides, we got the broccoli rabe, tots, and lobster mac n' cheese. Nothing particularly stood out. It's a waste of money in my opinion, expensive and takes up appetite from the steaks.\\n\\nDesserts we got cr√®me brulee and cheesecake which the server brought out in candles. It was tasty. We were charged for both desserts - it would have been a nice gesture had they taken at least one off the bill, not that we would mind paying the extra $10 on the $500 bill. The cake costs next to nothing and is so trivial that it's a no-brainer. \\n\\nService was excellent. Not intrusive at all, but he also did not neglect us.

Essentially an American-style dim sum experience. Each chef is in charge of one small tapa-sized masterpiece all night and diners can enjoy watching them hard at work in the open and very visible kitchen. Once they have a dozen or so prepared, they then make their way around the dining area to each table explaining their concept and asking the table if they would like to try it. ALWAYS SAY YES! When diners say yes, they simply mark it on the table's menu/tab which also has the price and description so diners know what they're saying yes to. As the menu is constantly changing according to what chefs want to make based on what is in season and such, each experience will be unique. Therefore, I advise to take advantage of each selection because chances are, you won't come across it again (unless of course you return the next day). \\n\\nWe ordered a bottle of Pinot noir and ordered the shrimp-n-grits, an autumn salad, pork belly, tunnbrodsrulle (a Swedish Street food), and pork skin risotto.

Good quality, decent portions, decent price. I highly suggest the eggs benedict for breakfast. Super pretty presentation, awesome taste. Random other thought- I love how affordable their coffee is. A number of restaurants will have you pay upwards of $3 for coffee and it drive me bonkers- not here.\\n\\nNOT GOOD:\\nThe waitstaff is nice but either poorly trained poor managed or just oblivious. Every time I've been sat I end up waiting for a server for a solid 10 minutes. My gut is they are understaffed, but regardless there's no reason to keep people waiting forever. My waiter has been kind every time, but I felt the constant need to flag people down because I wasn't sure when they'd drop by our table.\\n\\nOverall I think there's a lot of hype surrounding this place. While the food is solid and the atmosphere is traditional hipster trendy brunch feel, the slow service drives me bonkers and has me wanting Petit Marche or Flying Biscuit instead.

Unlike a lot of other places with pasta, there wasn't that much pasta. There was, however, a lot of butter and oil at the bottom of the bowl, making it kind of soupy. The blackened nachos were appetizing, but really not worth the $12, since it was mostly just cheese dip and chips. The fried platter was good.

The place is a little crowded. Going to the restroom requires squeezing between chairs and negotiating a gauntlet of women's purses hanging on the back of their chairs. Decor is sweet, but seems a little dated. I'm over concrete floors. Please hang something on the walls, the rooms are loud and noise bright, hard to carry on a conversation. I kept thinking maybe if the food was GREAT it would be worth it though, everything looked good on the menu. Unfortunately, the food was ultimately disappointing, and even frustrating. You feel like it's almost there, but just misses. My Savory french toast was good, but could have used a bit more flavor. I ordered some sausage patties on the side and got these little burnt hockey pucks. Generally it seems all the portions are smallish. My recommendations 1) do something about the noise, 2) don't be so stingy with the spices, 3) work a bit on portion size and presentation, and 4) maybe slightly smaller stations for each waitron, 5) they desperately seem to need a wait stand or two somewhere, too much has to come out from behind the counter."},{"name":"Redd's in Rozzie","address":"4257 Washington St","city":"Roslindale","stars":"4","text":"My husband wanted to try this place for lunch, and I went along with him.

I don't understand how people could say it's so loud you can't hear the person across from you. However, it is one of those places where it seems everyone is talking loudly. I find this to be a lot of fun, and the energy reminded me of Girl and the Goat in Chicago, which is as big a party as you can have at dinner. If you're looking for quiet and romantic, this is not the place.\\n\\nSo on to the prices. Everything's expensive, that's true. However, some of the portions are pretty decent, and we left very full after purchasing about $125 worth of food. We were so full in fact that we opted for an after-dinner drink instead of dessert. Had something called the Witch Doctor, which was amazing. Drink prices are typical for this sort of place. Bottles of wine start around $40 and cocktails are $10 a pop - again, totally standard prices for this quality of restaurant. I didn't have any issues with wait times for drinks as some folks noted.\\n\\nNow, I am not a fan at all of traditional Chinese dim sum. I just don't like the food. Tried it so many times in so many Chinatowns, and I've finally thrown up the white flag. This, however, is NOT dim sum. The fact that you don't order from the menu traditionally is where the similarities end. The chefs actually come to the table, and clearly describe the food that you're getting. (When's the last time that happened for you at a dim sum place?) It is natural to feel a small bit of guilt when declining as you can tell these chefs put their hearts and souls into their food, but that just means you're a good person. None of the chefs were offended when we passed on food, and were very gracious.\\n\\nFood highlights? Foie gras. Kobe beef roast. Squid ink pasta.\\n\\nMy one big piece of advice would be to consider bringing people with you if you're a couple. Our meal was very short: We were in and out the door in a hour and fifteen minutes. Having some friends along would prolong the experience and make it more fun. Chef Kevin Gillespie came by our table (very humble and gracious of course) and confirmed that as his recommendation: The best party size is 4-6 people.\\n\\nHowever, we will back and bring our friends.

Some will give a detailed description others will keep it short and simple.  Six of 14 offerings were sampled with 2 glasses of wine for $125 before tip.  All but one scored top marks.  Service was very sharp, helpful, and friendly from beginning to end.  \\n\\nThe single factor which made the experience a 4 star instead of a five is the pacing of the dining experience.  It's just too fast.  There is a lot of bustling activity throughout the restaurant. Dishes come in waves from different directions.  The result is a quickening of the consumption of each serving. Diners should be allowed to sequence the dishes in some order or at least complete one dish before another is presented for selection.  The waiter who seats you adds to the pressure by telling you that you will have only one opportunity to select a dish as it is offered. - which I don't think is true.

I was up early on a weekend and arrived at 8:15am (they open at 8) to find a line already out the door and almost an hour's wait. Woah! Fortunately I was all on my own, so I got in early to sit at the bar. If you just want to go and try the food, this definitely seems like the most efficient strategy - I left behind at least a dozen couples or groups who were still waiting in line before me. In the end I waited maybe 30 minutes at most.\\n\\nAnyway, on to the food - the whole menu looked delicious and it was hard to choose, but eventually I tried the blackstone benedict (eggs benedict with sweet thick-cut bacon). I really like that they offer half benedicts (only one egg and one slice of english muffin) because the normal size is a bit big -- but I would happily have eaten the whole thing in this case. Amazing! the bacon was thick, tasty, perfectly cooked, and a great mix of sweet and salty. The hollandaise sauce was tangy and delicious. Would definitely order again. So yes, definitely lived up to the hype food-wise, but the wait time is obviously a down side. If you do want to come with a partner/group, I'd recommend aiming for a non-peak time or prepare yourself for a wait. Seems the bigger your group, most likely the longer you'll wait.\\n\\nEdit: came back a second time, on a weekday with a friend. We got there around 9 and the line was just as long as the first time I came, possibly longer. We got lucky though and only ended up waiting about 30 minutes; the 8am settings were starting to change over, and many of the groups ahead of us were larger, so we got called up early when a 2-person table opened up. \\n\\nThis time I tried the pulled pork pancake and it was absolutely amazing huge as well. I only ordered the half portion, and I couldn't even eat half of that; the full serving must be four meals' worth of food! It sounds like an odd combination, pulled pork and maple glaze on a pancake, but it was absolutely delicious and I highly recommend trying this.\\n\\nThe good news is that apparently another location will be opening in Vancouver somewhere on Main Street hopefully in fall 2017, so here's hoping that reduces the waiting time a bit!"},{"name":"Sun in My Belly","address":"2161 College Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Sometimes, it doesn't take something inventive to blow you away.

There were few items on the menu that were labeled gluten free, but they do offer gluten free pizza so I thought I would try that.  There is a hefty up-charge for the gluten free crust - $5.  I think that is the most I have paid for gluten free pizza crust in Columbus thus far. The pizza was incredibly disappointing.  The toppings were delicious, but the crust was absolutely terrible making the whole thing largely inedible.  I know that they do not make the crust in house so I would suggest possibly sourcing the crust from someone else in the future.

I have never, *ever* had such great martinis - EVER.  Perfectly crafted, and served with ice stuck to the glasses (and don't get me started on the blue cheese-stuffed olives).  Such a contrast from No. 9 Park the night before.  The Hendricks gin aromas hit me in nose right off.  Delicious.\\n\\nBread service is varied and impressive.  Especially loved the flatbread/cracker.\\n\\nMy steak was cooked to perfection.  This is a rarity because it calls for a red-hot surface to get it Black and Moo (seared rare).  You can skip the sauces, which are flavorful and lovely, but you won't need them.  The ribeye steak has amazing flavor, no gristle and little extra fat, and is supremely tender.  It is aged beef like you have never had.\\n\\nThe calamari is the best I have ever had, and I order it frequently at other restaurants.  It was tender, crispy, and flavorful, served with fried onion straws.  The sauce is a bit too sweet for the dish, IMO, and I did not use it after a few bites, but the dish was not lacking for it.  The portion was generous as an appetizer for two, or you could have it as a main course with a salad.  This leads me to their wedge salad: a truly amazing rendition of an old classic, with a poblano ranch dressing, and is also a generous portion.\\n\\nSides are all a la carte.  The creamed spinach was good, as were the mashed potatoes.  The fried baby artichokes were other-worldly, and are a must, if you like artichokes.\\n\\nThe service is friendly, swift and professional.  The place is noisy, but not too, and buoyant.

We went in at like 3 PM which is a random time to come but it was really quiet and our server was really good.  We were his only table so he had nothing better to do.  For food I got 3 rolls- spicy tuna (my fav yum!), california, and unagi.  All very good and fresh.  Also got the house salad which is the best salad I've ever had at a japanese place- it even had real parmesan cheese on it.   The whole thing was great.   The only bad part is that I could only eat 1.5 rolls and took the rest home and then forgot them in my car.  What a waste!  Oh well that just means I will have to go back for more soon!"},{"name":"Sun in My Belly","address":"2161 College Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"We have enjoyed many meals here at SIMB but tonight was a disaster. The service was unbelievably slow and disorganized. I felt bad for our server because she clearly knew that the service issues were affecting the entire restaurant. The patrons seated behind us simply walked out after waiting for service. It went downhill from there. Our wedge salads were served on hot plates which wilted the lettuce of course. We still ate the salads to avoid further delay. We both had fried chicken dinners, which were OK but they were dark meat - no breasts - and the portion size was small compared to other restaurants in town. The menu was also very different from their website, both in selection and price. Their signature meat loaf and shrimp & grits are now gone, and most entrees are priced higher. A restaurant must keep their website up to date to stay competitive, as this is the primary source of info for most patrons. I hope that SIMB evaluates their service and makes appropriate changes. Also they need to do something about the flies - they were everywhere tonight."},{"name":"Grill 23 & Bar","address":"161 Berkeley St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"An old friend brought me here a few nights ago.

I really REALLY enjoyed the meal and look forward to many more here. I think the prices are  reasonable for what you end up taking home. \\n\\nInstead of bread they give you olives w/pits while you wait. I cant stand the smell of them so I took a pass while my partner in crime (PIC) enjoyed them. \\n\\nApp: Pane della Tagliatella: It's (6) warm foccacia breadsticks of onion, tomato and olive (2 each).  LOVE the onion!!  On my next visit I'll request all onion instead of the mix of the three. The tomato was my second favorite and I didnt try the olive.  The best part was dipping them in LT's spicy olive oil!!  Jensen (our server) suggested we try it.  Glad he did, we loved it! \\n\\nEntree: Mare Monte (Risotto served in a mushroom cream sauce dressed with shrimp): Today I learned \\"dressed\\" means just for decoration. I didnt order the dish so the two shrimp plopped in the middle wasnt a disappointment for me. Sorry folks, Im no connoisseur so I describe risotto as mushy rice.  I was expecting mushy rice and we got mushy rice.  I didnt like it at first but the mushroom flavor ended up being pretty good.  I wouldn't know or be able to tell otherwise but my PIC mentioned it was slightly overcooked.  Oh well, more leftovers for me!! \\n\\nEntree: Mezza Luna Pasta w/ Casalinga Sauce!! Yep! Set that right here my friend!! Per the menu description, it's pasta stuffed with goat cheese and bacon then tossed in a tomato sauce with pork sausage, cheeses, basil, mushrooms and pine nuts.  However, you can see from the picture the sauce is orange-ish.  I thought tomato sauce = marinara sauce, or some variation of it.  This looked a lot like vodka sauce.  Either way it was good, very good!  I could taste the cheese and bacon through the sauce so it wasnt too heavy. I'd get it again but Im looking forward to trying something new. Oh! PIC mentioned my dish was slightly al dente which was great because that's how I prefer my pasta. \\n\\nDessert: Both filled, we still made room for dessert.  We ordered the Tre Bombe and the tiramisu.  The Bomb! has a slight hazelnut deliciousness!  The bottom layer was a little too rich for me, same went for the dark chocolate on the side.  I really enjoyed the top two layers with the white chocolate instead.  The tiramisu was perfection!!  There's really no way for me to describe how good it was without coming across perverted.  Just order it, you'll like it. \\n\\nService: Jensen was our server and did a good job; he seemed personable and eager.  Steve, the manager, was also very nice and stopped by our table several times to make sure everything went well. Jensen carried around this nifty wireless POS (point of sale not piece of $#!%) system that allowed him to submit our orders while standing at our table. Closing out was also a breeze because he was able to swipe the card while in our presence.\\n\\n\\n ****UPDATE from second visit****\\n\\nSette Formaggi Pizze:  Holy crickets!  That's a ridiculous amount of cheese!!  This was no doubt a 3 lactose pill endeavor and I still ended up getting a tummy ache (lesson learned? pills can only do so much). It's seven cheeses individually placed in different sections of the dough rather than a even distribution of them.  I like the idea, gives you a chance to have different flavors all from one dish. It was a little heavy on gorgonzola.  Ultimately, I really liked it, just dont think I can handle all that moo mix (cheese).  I passed on taking this bad boy home. \\n\\nSorrentino Pasta with Amatricana sauce:  It's pasta stuffed with juniper spiced pork(speck) and parmesan then tossed in a tomato sauce with bacon and onion. This is what I was expecting from a tomato sauce(see pic) and it was heaven in my belly!!  As much as I loved my previous meal, this one was even better!!  The actual pasta size was smaller(no big deal) and not as al dente(slight disappointment) but I still thought it was great!! \\n\\nCheesecake della Tagliatella: I didnt try it but I hear it good although the raspberries were a bit strong. \\n\\nCioccofondente: This dish comes with a side of dark chocolate which I knew I didnt care for so I asked for white chocolate instead. I can now say I would prefer this dessert over tiramisu any day!!   So yummy!  It was fluffy then crisp and not too sweet.... delicious"},{"name":"Havana Bistro and Caf√©","address":"7975 S Orange Blossom Trl","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"meh! mediocrity at its best... food and service....\\n\\ncoffee is good tho.  but it usually is in miami."},{"name":"Phnom Penh","address":"244 E Georgia Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Been going to this place since I was a very young girl.

The fries are excellent, too.\\n\\nI only order smoked meat \\"fat.\\" That's the only way to go as far as I'm concerned.\\n\\nTheir Triple Chocolate Cake is one of the best chocolate cakes I've ever tasted and well worth the $6.99.\\n\\nHowever, my complaint centers around the small portions of everything, especially the poutine which if you want it instead of fries with the platter, you pay extra for.  Okay, fair enough; but what you get comes in one of those small bowls.  If you are going to charge me extra for poutine, give me a healthy portion, please.\\n\\nMy other complaint is the music; most times I am there, they are playing hard rock which I cannot stand.  If I'm going to pay an arm and a leg for food, I am not going to be forced to listen to music that unnerves me.  I eat out a lot; Dunn's has lost 90% of my business simply because of the music they play...and I am also the loser because I miss out on the smoked meat.\\n\\nWhen will restaurants realize that you will lose customers with music that not everyone likes but won't lose any customers with music that may be bland but doesn't offend?

The cocktail I replied, she looked confused and went to the barkeep. She returned quickly and asked, \\"So you want the one with vermouth and all that?\\"\\n   I responded yes, an Americano. Apparently she just learned what an Americano was at the bar, maybe the barkeep too, who knows. It arrived correct to my relief.\\n   My Wife's RED Wine, however, was cold and corked. Hmm, okay.

It was one of those magical places that people still recall fondly now 15 years after it closed.  \\n\\nMy mom always tells the story about how after Jennie's father sold the restaurant and retired it never felt the same.  She said that even though they kept the same dishes that the Swiss Inn used to be famous for she said it never tasted quite as good.  She always used this as an proof positive that you can taste how much someone cares about the food that they are cooking.  \\n\\nAnyway I tell that story because the Swiss Hibiscus lives up to the pretty much impossible expectations that the Swiss Inn set.  The food isn't exactly the same as the old Swiss Inn, but through the haze of memory it FEELS the same.  The tiny dining room, feels cozier than the high ceilings would lead you to believe largely due to the warmth of the wait staff, and the food, does it's damnedest to prove my mom right about being able to taste how much a person cares about the food they cook.\\n\\nSo if that seemed like a lot of words without actually describing a single dish... it kinda is (sorry), but I felt like i could skimp on specifics since literally every dish we've had here over the course of probably a dozen or more visits has been spectacular in it's own right.  I'm particularly partial to the emince zurichoise (although that's possibly a result of being so proud that i finally figured out how to pronounce it), but it's pretty hard to go wrong here.  If i have a pro-tip, I'd recommend finding a way to save room for the ice cream sandwich (ordered with a side of chocolate sauce of course) which is way better than you'd expect, but like i said it's almost impossible to order \\"wrong\\" here.\\n\\nThis is probably the easiest restaurant in town to recommend. The food is not simply delicious, but easy to love, the ambiance is casual enough that you can (and should) bring your kids, but intimate enough for a date, and the service is always amazing.

The pork belly buns are very good. The noodle soups are lacking in flavor, especially the pork chop noodle soup. The broth was very bland, it's just a giant bowl of noodles in bland pale broth with a tough fried pork chop on the side.

There has always been that vibe at Vino Vino under the new owners, a certain superiority on the part of the people who work there, but it was worse than usual. OK, bluntly: our server seemed probably drunk, and also he seemed to dislike us. He kicked our chairs (accidentally) more than once. He spilled water on the table, reached across the table to refill wine glasses. He drifted off in the middle of doing things. He poured wine into glasses inconsistently (kept skipping the person who wasn't drinking as fast as the other two but still was drinking). Once we declined to order a 2nd bottle of wine, he snatched empty wine glasses off the table the second he deemed them empty. \\n\\nIt's a shame. The food was honestly some of the best I've had in Austin lately. The wine was top notch. But the service made me so uncomfortable I can't imagine going back.

On one occasion I'd misread the sign (being tired and hungry) and requested onion rings, to which I received an exasperated, clearly annoyed reply, \\"We don't HAVE onion rings.\\" Thanks, dude, for the soft delivery on that one...maybe a, \\"Sorry, we don't serve onion rings here\\" or something like that would be better - but that's clearly subjective.

The barn-like beamed JVCC has multiple TVs and clubhouse seating (sofa's and over stuffed chairs) in addition to the restaurant tables, so a wait was not foreboding.\\n\\nUnfortunately our wait turned longer as a mix-up in the kitchen sent our order out as take away, discovered only when the it reached it's destination and they called to report they had the wrong food.  They put in our order again, and since the owner himself was our waiter, he comped our dinner and asked the kitchen to rush.\\n\\nWe enjoyed the founder's pizza, a calzone and a gluten free Bianco pizza, as well as some \\"Village Fries\\" with bacon and cheese and a side of ranch dressing.\\n\\nThe food is very good.  Unfortunately they seem to need some help in the kitchen and additional wait-staff.  \\n\\nWith so few choices near Jerome Village,  Pasquale's is a great option for those in upper Dublin, Jerome Township or who hanker for the pizza they remember from Westerville.\\n\\nIn spite of the long wait and kitchen mix-up, I am sure we will be back."},{"name":"Rosa's Pizza","address":"62 Broad St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Went there for lunch today.

We ordered the mini chirashi and udon combo which had a few slice of fresh fish atop sushi rice and a bowl of warm udon. The udon we left for a little while since it came quite early and unfortunately we let it get soggy but the flavour was simple and tasty. The sushi rice for the chirashi needed a little bit more vinegar but overall, not bad for the price! We also got toro and hamachi nigiri which were well priced and although the rice below was a bit heavy handed and lacking in seasoning, these were nice cuts of fish! The shiso ika is something id never tried and its as surprisingly refreshing. A little slimy because of the squid but was a bright burst of flavour. Last, the spicy chopped scallop was again, a little heavy on the rice but had plump and fresh scallops nestled within.\\n\\nOverall, I was unfortunately not feeling too hungry and couldn't full savour every bite but was glad to try out this authentic sushi place.

We were really excited to try the steaks. I had a craving for it for a while now. I got the new york strip and bf got the dry aged new york strip.  We did a taste test to see which tasted better. the dry age is definately better and you are paying more for it.  The taste was more defined than the regular one I had. The bleu cheese mashed were ok, you couldn't really taste the bleu cheese ( and i love bleu cheese) . The asparagus was a bit dissapointing, i like them to have a bit of a crunch and they were very limp. The best part of the nite was definately dessert. Get the Caramel Profiteroles, omgosh its heavenly!!!! The coffee ice cream, chocolate sauce and almonds , yum yum yum!!!!!!  The chowder is delicious too! really good flavor and unique!\\nAlthough I really like the place, the steak was good, it was extremely loud.  Also we got seated next to a party of 10 who were obnoxiusly loud, dropping F bombs and making references to gays , which is soo not cool. It was soo annoying. Luckily our dinner ended before they got out of control. Also, we went to grab a drink at the bar because we had to wait a little for our table to be ready and the bartender there is unattentive and ignored us for a while before he asked us what we wanted.

Previous to this experience, Ive eaten here 3 times before. Although the food wasn't the best, nor the service, I can see why people give this place such a low rating after tonight. I will try to summarize the key points briefly. \\n\\nOrdered salmon sashimi for it to still come out half frozen and inedible. The other half came covered in brownish spots which made it look like and taste really old, not fresh in the slightest. Asked the waitress for another dish because it was unacceptable, she gave us an excuse that all of them were like that and there's nothing she could do. \\n\\nAsked to speak with the manager, told him that the sashimi he is serving is inedible because it was half frozen. He instantly became irritable and rude stating that all his salmon sashimi was like this and that since we've ordered our limit, we couldn't get another plate. Seriously? You serve us inedible food and tell us pretty much to just shut up and that we can't order it again even though we haven't eaten it. \\n\\nWe wait 30 minutes for our food to come out while seeing everyone around us get their plates. I ask the waitress if our foods coming, she says she'll go in the back and check. She comes back saying that there's nothing currently ordered for our table. I figured she lost our sheet and asked for another one. At this point everything has been going wrong so far but at least our foods coming soon so that's good right? \\n\\nThe beef and chicken teriyaki we ordered tasted like rubber and like it had been microwaved instead of cooked. The sushi rice was a chore to eat and everything had no flavour unless you drenched it in soy sauce.  Every dish we had was either subpar or mediocre. Definitely a waste of your money \\n\\nGet this, the best part is when the waitress brings back our first order that she supposedly lost an hour ago. She literally didn't even think to ask us if we wanted to eat twice of everything again and just continued on with the order an hour late. My water was never refilled, I had to ask for soy sauce plates. The owner doesn't know how to communicate and deal with dissatisfied customers without blowing up and getting upset that we dare complain about his shit food. \\n\\nHonestly the worst experience I can imagine and I URGE anyone that's even thinking about trying this cheap AYCE sushi place to STAY AWAY."},{"name":"Golden Temple","address":"1651 Beacon St","city":"Brookline","stars":"3","text":"Very disappointing experience here on Christmas.\\n\\nFamily and I (total of 5) visited around 3 o clock (with reservations).

Our waiter was slow and barely spoke a word of English. I usually wouldn't mind this but he got two of our orders wrong. When the food did arrive, it was lukewarm and came out in sections.

For our entree, my wife and I both ordered the chicken souvlaki and it was seasoned well and very tender. The greek salad it was served on was also quite good. They made my 4yo daughter a \\"pizza\\" that consisted of pita bread with melted mozzarella topped with slices of gyro meat. She loved it! For desert we got a baklava and a slice of the chocolate cake. I didn't try the cake, but it seemed to disappear pretty quickly from my wife's plate.

This complimentary loaf of bread comes out nice and warm and once topped with the apple butter, melts in your mouth. My favorite dish is the Misty Isle Mixed Grill which comes with a piece of grilled chicken, sausage, mashed potatoes (and gravy), and root vegetables. Delicious! Also, SAY YES the onion web on the appetizer. Okay, so it sort of looks like a birds nest, but you won't even think about that once you taste it. A combination of fried potato and onion strings, this is sooo good. As for the beverages, I would recommend trying one of the beer samplers for $15 and you get to keep a souvenir glass. Finnegan's even occasional live music in the bar area. Service here can be hit or miss. It can also get busy here so go early for lunch or dinner to avoid the crowd.

My friend wanted the eggs Benedict, which is only available on the weekends (it was a Thursday) so our server recommended \\"the hangover\\" which isn't on the menu. Sunny side up eggs, sausage, and avocado on one of their homemade biscuits topped with sirracha and served with cheesy roasted potatoes. We substituted the sausage with fried green tomatoes and it was awesome. I've had fried green tomatoes from all over Atlanta and I have to say I think they're my new favorite! On top of all this, the price is totally reasonable!

I had the pineapple fried rice and my sister had the chicken larb.  Both entres were really good. The larb was a little spicy but not over the top.

There are several screens for viewing games/ sporting events though you wouldn't be able to hear anything. The queso is great!!\\n\\nCONS:  The rest of the food is sub par.  This bills as a seafood restaurant but to me its more of a downscaled bar seafood knock off joint.  The chicken wings seem to be some sort of preprocessed wings rather than just fresh wingettes/drummettes.  The fried oysters which they fry in cornmeal (they should use flour) contain more \\"fried\\" than oyster.  Now the burger is pretty good as well as the queso but the fried fish i've had and wings and other items were just fair. I also despise that they do not have short  glasses for cocktails and drinking out of a cup is NOT an option.  So when I order a vodka tonic its 2 oz of vodka and a glass full of ice and tonic (though i order doubles)\\n\\nOverall, Despite my CON'S the atmosphere and drink specials make this a great place to bring friends and have a drink or two...or 3.  It's not the \\"lets go on a date\\" type place.. Actually I'd say 4 stars drink.............2.5 stars food"},{"name":"Gunshow","address":"924 Garrett St, Ste C","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"This approach to dining was really interesting. It was cool to have the chefs who prepared the dish come out, show it to, tell yo about it and you decided if you wanted to try it. I felt a little guilty about saying no to some of them, but I knew what I was holding out for. It all looked amazing. \\n\\nWe had the following...\\n\\nCrispy pork belly and octopus\\nKorean squid pancake\\nVietnamese chicken wings\\nShort rib\\nToasted Old Fashioned\\n\\nAll the food was amazing. My girlfriend is a big fan of Top Chef and Kevin Gillespie and I've started to become a fan of the show and him. It was kind of cool to have him come out and present his dish. Of course we tried it (short ribs) and it was delicious. \\nHe seems very nice and accommodated  fans who wants to take pictures with him and seemed very gracious with people telling him they were fans of him and the show. \\n\\nThe only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because it is LOUD in there. The acoustics are bad and the music was loud.\\n\\n2 things I should mention as well is that I would not go here with a group of more than 4 people because the way the food comes out, part of a larger group would get left out since the whole thing lasted about 1:30 and the food comes out in a staggered manner.

I drove all the way from Sandy Springs for a 7:15 reservation after driving for 60 minutes I was looking forward to a nice glass of wine. So when we sat down and looked at the menu I was disappointed to see that the wine I wanted was a $2 up-charge. I decided on a different one and was very surprised when they served my wine in a pretty small glass, not only smaller than I had there before but it took 20 minutes to get it. Next for my salad I ordered an arugula salad that came out small with spinach almost no cheese and when I asked the waiter he said they had run out of arugula???? Let me know next time!!!!!! We ordered our entrees at 7:45 and they were still not out at 8:30, I asked our waiter and he said they would be right out well we finally got them at 8:45, unacceptable and ridiculous!!!!! I had ordered the scallops since the woman next to me had them and they looked good. When I got mine it was half a portion, 3 small scallops, really! I wait 60 minutes and I don't even get a full meal and also had cold kale! I asked the hostess why so small she said that was the Scoutmob portion! Needless to say they should let you know that the Scoutmob portion is much smaller than the regular. I also thought it was interesting that my friends portobello mushroom sandwich had arugula on it,Hmmmmm, I thought they were out of arugula, I guess that was just for the Scoutmob salad. We took our desert to go because I couldn't bear the thought of waiting another 30 minutes to get it!!!! Overall this was one of the most disappointing dinners I have had in a long time. !!! It would have at least helped if the waiter came over and and apologized but we never saw him again. The hostess was apologetic but the woman who dropped our check down could have cared less. Not only would I never go back there for dinner but I would also never go back for brunch!!!

When we first entered this place around 2pm, the waitress was already speaking to us in rudely manner, but because our group of 10 people were very hungry, so we just ignored the way she spoke to us and focus our mind to order food. Since we were unfamiliar with the place we wanted to ask her for some directions to get the market around North Vancouver and she flatted out said she didn't know anything, and then went to eat (I guess she might have been hanger since she hadn't eaten).

Almost all of us ordered Pho and spring roll, but I ordered vermicelli noodle with grilled meat and fried egg rolls. I tried some of their Pho' broth, I definitely agreed that it tasted really well seasoned. As for my order, the vermicelli noodle, well the noodle was a little bit dry, so I think they left it out for a long time. The meat was decent, but their fish sauce was very tasty, And this was why I was able to finish my bowl of noodle. I must say their spring rolls and the dipping sauce is not as good as other places that I've tried.

At 8:09, still no arrival, so I called and they said it was out for delivery. At 8:39 called again and was told he must be around the corner. At 9:03, the food arrived. Nearly two hours after we ordered. They brought no napkins, no silverware, and no chopsticks even, so we were left with cold food and no possible way to eat it, not really handy for curry. They didn't make the food correctly, but they have since adjusted the price to refund us for the incorrect order, and finally our boba tea contained one single tapioca boba between three boba teas!  you cant make this stuff up.

Its texture was rather spongy and the flavor was unusually sour.  On a positive note, the service was attentive and friendly.

My table of 4 ordered 2 whole pizzas (each of up selected a 1/2), salads, and wine. The waitress was friendly and helpful. We sat right across from the pizza oven and had fun watching them make the pizzas. \\n\\nSo, all and all the meal was really good but there were two drawbacks that I experienced. First, we arrived 10 minutes early for our reservation and waited 25 minutes for our table. There was one hostess who was also doubling as take out food man and answering the phones. While the place is tiny, it seems like he really needed some assistance. It was stressful! The place was packed (a good thing) but it was cold and there was nowhere to stand inside (bad thing). I dragged my friends all the way int o the city just to eat there so the wait was a little frustrating. Twice we got called up for a table and twice were sent back to wait again. Worse than the wait was that every time a new person arrived, they had to push past the whole crowd and struggle to get to the hostess. I couldn't help but feel really claustrophobic. Basically, their crowd flow wasn't working. \\n\\nSecondly, for being a popular Tod English restaurant we were surprised to see major wear and tear all around the restaurant. Two of the stools at our table were broken, there was a hole in the ceiling above that had been patched with black electrical tape. We also noticed another few bumps and bruises too. Alright - not a major deal, but surprising for such a tiny place right one Beacon Hill. \\n\\nAnyways, the drawbacks are minor.

There is no Hostess, or at least not a visible one.  Instead there is just a bar, and an obviously overtaxed bartender, who I assume doubles as a Hostess?  Regardless, we had difficulty getting anyone's attention.  The fact that we had an 8:30 reservation was obviously useless.  Now, I've had to wait after making reservations before, but at least I was greeted upon entering the restaurant.  Once we finally got his attention, we stated we had a reservation and asked for a wine list.  Now this wine list...very interesting list.  Lets just say, its horrible.  Something around 20 selections, 65% of which are over $100 a bottle. Cheapest I noticed was almost 60. Lets be real.  Even the finest establishments make most of their money off of the $40 bottle.  This restaurant apparently only wants to sell by the glass, which is in itself a huge ripoff  (Cheapest red:  \\"red blend\\", $10 a glass).  I'm not accusing of egregious mark-up here, as there was a bottle of silver oak Cabernet at a very reasonable profit markup I noticed, so i'm assuming the rest are likely reasonable too.  It's really an issue of poor selection.  Let's get some nice moderately priced wines on the list, had we saw anything reasonable we wouldn't have hesitated to make a purchase (hell, just throw a primitivo on the menu, low price point, crowd pleaser, no one has to know its the same grape as a zinfandel, it sounds exotic enough).  \\n\\nSo after looking at this ridiculous offering named a wine list for about 10 minutes, we were all but forced to this tiny purgatory of a table right next to the bar (apparently someone didn't like us standing by the bar, i'm not really sure).  Our drink order was finally taken (a reasonably priced lagunitas draft for me and a silly priced chardonnay for the lady).  The only semblance of service we had all night. And this table, well, I'm not really sure what it is.  Initially we thought it was just for waiting, but there was silverware on it, and the man who sat us stated he would be back for our appetizer order (which he never was by the way).  This was very confusing because the table was extraordinarily low, and was circular with a diameter no more than 20 inches.  Certainly not even remotely enough room for two people to dine.  Not that that mattered anyway, because that was the only interaction we had with a staff member before we left.  \\n\\nAfter receiving our drinks we proceeded to wait, and wait....and wait.  I can only assume we were forgotten.  After about 30 minutes, we just left.  Kind of without paying.  They had already redeemed the living social voucher we had, which more than covered our drinks.  Even though the voucher was for a full meal, almost $90 value, we had had enough.  It was worth taking the loss just to get out of the place.\\n\\nThe restaurant seems to tout that it is Not On Park Avenue (Hence the name, NOPA), but i'm not really sure why.  Are the implying that being on Park avenue is a bad thing, that they are different and in some way better?  Having dined many times on Park Ave I can say they are miles behind, at the least consistent service is received at some of the overpriced establishments on Park.  \\n\\nI can only assume that this small restaurant was overwhelmed due to a recent livingsocial released.  That they weren't ready to meet the increased demand.  However, I have never had an experience so bad.  Communication is all that is needed, don't overbook your restaurant.  I will be complaining to living social and attempting to get a refund through both them, and American Express whose card I purchased the deal with.

I'm only going to criticize the food as the service is what you would expect at most Chinese/Asian restaurant, they expect you to order, eat, pay & go! There's no time to waste, which i understand. However, the food was truly disappointing for me, my expectations were high (maybe too high)! \\n\\nWe ordered the famous wings along w/ buttered beef, deep-fried spare ribs, spicy basil clams & frog legs. Prior to our food arriving, saw this guy next to us wolving down a platter of wings all by himself. I thought to myself, 'damn, they must be GOOD!', which in turn raised my expectations even further. First to arrive was the spicy clams in a clam juice basil broth. The clams were probably the best dish of the night, it was surprisingly tasty & delicious. Buttered-beef was next, it was 'okay' in my view, something different. It had slices of raw beef layered on a plate marinated in this vinegar mix w/ lots of herbs. Then comes the wings served with a Pepper-lime juice dip (the dip is not for those w/ any oral wounds b/c it will sting like a b*tch!) After the first wing, i asked myself, \\"am i missing something? A-ha! must be the dip, let me try another one w/ a bit more!!!\\" So i tried another wing w/ a bit more dip, all i got was the same tasting wing just add the stingy pain to my mouth! To be honest, the wings are acceptable, but not nearly as good or as tasty as some would describe. The frog legs came next & it was prepared in a similar fashion as the wings (battered & fried). Spare-ribs were also done the same way. So in the end, I didn't know if i was tasting chicken, frogs or pork! they were all DEEP-FRIED!??!?! \\n\\nWhen the bill arrived, i almost had a heartattack & it's not because of the greasy deep-fried entrees. Our party of four spent well over $22.00/person & we were only half-full. Usually, I dont mind paying good $$$ for tasty good food, but @ Phnom Penh, i think NOT (not anymore at least).

After the appetizers left the table we waited another 30 for the entrees - do they even know what a paella is?

It's kind of like a big common back yard where you can let your dogs run free with all the other dogs. Yes, lots of play fights break out between the dogs but in my experience most of these are just that - play. And that's why I take my dog here. Occasionally a truly aggressive dog may come along so it's best to keep an eye on your pet, obviously, but people come and go from the coffee shop area to the backyard area and it seems like there are always people keeping an eye on the dogs.

Most of you who consistently read my reviews know that my son has food allergies and I have dietary restrictions. We mentioned those to Nydia and she was awesome at ensuring everything was taken care of.\\n\\nWe started with drinks- I had the proprietary whiskey flight, my husband had an orange blossom Pilsner and mom got a Jamison and ginger. I loved the whiskey flight and my mom's mixed drink was strong.\\n\\nOur appetizer was a pound of large stone crab claws ($128). We'd never had them before and decided to splurge since we are on vacation and are much fresher than the ones shipped to Vegas. They were awesome- there were 9 large crab claws and each of us got 3. There was a creamy dipping sauce that was reported back to me as \\"delicious\\". Nydia brought us out our house salads and fresh bread. The bread was AMAZING. Even though I didn't taste any myself, I knew it just by smelling it (weird, I know... But sometimes I miss gluten!). It was fresh, light and chewy, warm, a little cheesy... In a great way. The salad greens and veggies were crisp and served on a cold plate with a nice vinaigrette dressing. \\n\\nSo now on to our main courses.. T Money ordered a hot dog with fries p 24 oz Porterhouse and Ma Dukes ordered an 8oz filet mignon. The hot dog was big and the house fries were so crispy and perfect. They cut up a half of an actual potato and fried it. Husband's porterhouse was Pittsburg style, rare. Cooked to perfection. I ordered mine blue- also cooked to perfection. The aged beef literally melted in your mouth. The filet side of my porterhouse was heavenly. Seriously. My mom commented hers was also so tender that she thought she would be able to cut it with her fork if she tried. \\n\\nAll in all, it was an amazing meal. Total time from start to finish was about 2 hours but with absolutely no complaint from us. It was a steady stream of food and drinks, we never once thought we'd been forgotten- even though they had two very large parties and almost every table and booth full.

It carries a truncated menu selection of classic, everyday Taiwanese dishes. Its cooking is pretty authentic but its flavor is lacking and repeatedly leaves me wanting. \\n\\nCrispy fried chicken (aka salt & pepper chicken) is a must have and their best dish. It's thinly coated dark meat chicken chunks, deep fried, and seasoned with a white pepper salt mix. It's very good and you can also get the pork cutlet the same same way, too. One thing they can improve is to add more fried basil leaves, a typical accompaniment that adds extra crisp and contrast to the dish. They're pretty stingy with it. B-\\n\\nBeef noodle soup is a beef stew served with fresh noodles. It's a popular dish in Chinese cuisine and its flavors and styles are as varied as the weather on a Portland Spring day. Wei Wei's version is not very spicy and yet not strongly flavored. Not sure what cut of beef they use but typically the meat should ideally have some connective tissues with it as well, for additional texture. The soup is on the bland side and the noodles aren't as thick as they should. Again, it's pretty authentic but that doesn't necessarily mean it's good. C+\\n\\nThey also have baos! In case if you don't know, they are steamed buns that sandwich anything from stewed beef to pork belly and accompanied by some sort of sauce, pickled veggie, crushed peanuts, and/or cilantro. At Wei Wei, the bao fillings tend to be on the smaller side, and the flavor is lacking balance. They don't use or not use enough pickled mustard or other veggies, which provide a tart, salty contrast to the meat. Go to Gourmet Noodle Bowl in Seattle for excellent beef noodle soup and baos in the area. C-\\n\\nThe experience of dining at Wei Wei is reminiscent of eating at Ikea. The decor and feel is clean, bright, and Scandinavian. It's a welcomed change to the stereotypical Chinese restaurant, but at the same time, it's a reflection of their cooking - again, a bit bland, which is probably a chosen tactic given their location in Sellwood. Their credit card machine is one of those chip readers that take forever. Come on, time to upgrade to Square!\\n\\nLastly, their menu pricing is a bit high, given it's a quick serve restaurant and their food portions.

The fries are also excellent here, they tend to swap out the potatoes seasonally; so you get a different tasting batch of fries when you visit. \\n\\nLove the self-serve soda since if you need a refill you don't feel awkward about asking an employee for a refill.

Now I am sitting here wondering what else they are coating with butter?  The grilled chicken?  They obviously have olive oil from the dressings (now I better check that this isn't veg. oil)  So, I am very disappointed - now, I have to strip out not only the feta cheese (dairy free diet), but now my grilled onions, only because they haven't figured out that to claim to be healthy-you would think they would know (1TBSP) butter has 7 grams of sat. fats vs. 2 in EVOO; is dairy and could easily be substituted for healthy fats without compromising flavor by using EVOO."},{"name":"Flying Biscuit Caf√© - Midtown","address":"1001 Piedmont Ave","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"I usually hate grits, but I love the cheesy grits here!

I want to say I loved it, in fact, there were many excellent aspects to it - but I can honestly say that it was just OK.\\n \\nThe best bits: \\n\\n1. I cannot fault the quality of the meat and the cooking of the meat - 5 stars hands down. Fillet mingon cooked to perfection - rare and hubby's dry age strip was perfectly medium rare (and medium enough that the fat had melted a bit and was just delish).\\n\\n2. I also think that the atmosphere was great - ok, not really romantic, but we took the advice of \\"karate chop\\" Meg and booked upstairs which was a good move as it was really noisy downstairs. The atmosphere was what I would call a traditional american upmarket steakhouse, more like the sort of place i have been to in san fran rather than in Boston. Bright, airy and shiny and bustling - totally oldschool which was a cool new experience.\\n\\n3. The breads were awesome, as were my profiteroles and the truffle tater tots - yummm. Oh and I would say that the sides were plentiful. We had the broccoli, asparagus and tater tots between 2 and we had more than enough.\\n\\nSo why only give it 3 stars you may ask?\\n\\n1. SALT ahoy. Man the seasoning on the steak and on the asparagus and on pretty much everything was getting to the unbearable stage by the end of the meal. At the start it was just really salty but tasty, but by the end of the meal Hubs felt it a real struggle to eat the rest of the steak, not because of the cooking - as said above, that was flawless - but the salt. NOT nice. I was also relishing the inside bits of the steak to to take a breather from the battering my tongue and upper pallete took.\\n\\n2. The little touches weren't there. hubs is allergic to nuts, and we did mention this to our server, but most of the deserts come with some nut based aspect to the dish. We ordered creme brulee which came with an almond biscotti. We asked it to come without the biscotti and it came just like that. Which obviously was fine, but when paying $300 for dinner it would be nice if a little dollop of ice cream or something had been added to replace it. \\n\\n3. Temperature - it was FREEZING. I was wearing a LBD and had really dressed up, but I had to keep my cardigan on all night. I mentioned it to the server and he just said \\"I know\\" Man I was FREEZING goose pimples and everything!\\n\\n4. Price of drinks. Now I know I should expect to pay a premium for drinks at a place like this. I do expect to pay more and I don't really grudge it, it's all part of the experience BUT $21 for a tom collins and a gin and tonic? come on - that's way more than top of the hub! Can't even reallycall a g and t a cocktail and lets face it a tom collins  - gin,  simple syrup and soda - hardly creative mixing there. so $25 incl tip seemed rather steep.\\n\\nRelated to that, they wouldnt let us put the drinks onto our table - we would have tipped the barman, I don't see why they had to make us pay there and then - but that's just a ninor aside.\\n\\nAll in all we had a lovely night, but I was left feeling really disappointed. The meat was some of the best I had EVER tasted, but was just spoilt but the heavy handed use of salt.\\n\\nUnfortunately I will have to say just A-OK and save up to try another establishment later."},{"name":"Turf N Surf Po' Boy","address":"407 Lavaca St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Tacos - fries - Poboy & 2 drinks over $35 for lunch plus $10 to park - wow- tried to get nachos- wings & queso but not available till after 5- seems to be happening place-the good was good but too pricey for me for lunch."},{"name":"Turf N Surf Po' Boy","address":"407 Lavaca St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Cheers to that one time I spent $23 on a meal, and ate too much too fast, with absolutely no regrets.

Those go with every drink.\\n\\nThe cocktails were interesting, though there are others on the house list that I look forward to trying. The Morningsider was served too strong almost every time. I suppose it is dumb to complain of such things.

In practice, I hope to discover a H&F burger-type item on the menu to keep us coming back. I don't think the GF will be returning to nab some more of those cheetos.\\n\\nAll that said, I'm still a huge fan of the whole thing, and I think the Family Dog can thrive on great cocktails and three awesome menu items. The chips put the appetizer course in the bag. If the burger and wings rock, we're basically there. \\n\\nI hope the menu changes regularly, because this could be a fun testing ground for a talented chef developing drinking-focused food (separate from the sometimes self-important gastro pub idea).

I asked the waiter if it was suppose to taste like that, it had a moldy taste, and he said he didn't know, and apologized. He didn't offer to get a new one though or offer something in place of it which I thought was weird.

We also ordered calamari as an appetizer and it was really good too.\\n\\nLater we ordered a pizza to take to our room. It was really good. Only thing was they didn't have any plates or utensils to eat it with. The waitress handed me a wad of cocktail napkins, and when I just looked at her with what must have been a puzzled look, she said she would see if she could find some plates or something. She ended up giving me a couple of carry out containers which i ripped the lids off to make some makeshift plates. No luck on the utensils, but it was pizza...so it was okay, and I give credit to the waitress for trying to help. \\n\\nWhen I got back to our room, an outside pizza vendor had slid an advertisement under our door, and if we would have known we could have gotten the same size pizza with more toppings, 20 wings, and 3 cans of soda...cheaper.

First they rinse your hands with warm water. Then comes the lentil soup, Hummus salad with bread, Bastille Royalle appetizer which was similar to a phyllo sweet pastry filled with eggs, spices, and chicken. We ordered the fish and vegetarian potato eggroll type dish in a savory tomato sauce.  The fish was amazing. Just ask for a fork. The white fish had a creamy white sauce with olives and mushrooms and the salmon was cooked to perfection in a tomato pepper sauce.  The fish was fantastic. The vegetarian dish was ok, but I would definitely order the fish again if I came back to dine.  The belly dancing show was fun, and our dessert of fruit salad and mint tea was a treat. Our waitress kept refilling our tea, and there was no rush to leave the restaurant. It wasn't crowded like some places can be on holiday weekends, and the food was amazing.

I've eaten the food, had the coffee, and had beer and mixed drinks here. I'd say they do it all pretty well in a no-frills kind of way. \\"Local flavor\\" is an accurate description, as it fits really well in Reynoldstown.\\n\\nThe interior has a traditional coffee shop arrangement of little tables with uncomfortable chairs alongside the cluster of sofas surrounding a coffee table. WiFi is provided, and most seats can reach an outlet. The covered patio (outside the dog park) has a decent amount of additional seating. They have some board games (inc. a Mental Floss trivia game), magazines, and books. There's a smallish projector, but I'm not sure what they use it for.\\n\\nCafe: Local Counter Culture Coffee is served, along with Two Leaves and a Bud tea. Prices are fairly inexpensive for the area ($2.29 for a large coffee). I've eaten various things including a grilled pimento cheese sandwich (no longer appears to be on the menu), house salad, and the breakfast burrito. All were very simple and inexpensive - shows you can charge just $6 for a sandwich with chips if it doesn't come on an oversized plate with a guacamole smear and house-made chipotle aioli. Also, there are multiple vegan options.\\n\\nPark: If some other reviews make you concerned about the conditions of the dog park, I would just reiterate what I said earlier: it is no-frills. You're in Reynoldstown, not Midtown. The \\"park\\" is basically a large dirt yard with tables and chairs and a couple of dog-related things scattered around (e.g. a fire hydrant and water bowls). Also, especially on the weekend, *lots* of dogs, mainly medium to large ones. Dogs typically need to be comfortable with a little rough play. Owners are often friendly, usually polite. You can bring your food and drinks out into the dog park if you like.\\n\\nBar: Moderate selection of wine, craft and \\"cheap hipster\\" (e.g. PBR) beer, and simple mixed drinks.

This hotel did not live up to any of these. Upon check in we were made to feel as lesser guests because we booked through an outside website. Being told that they usually do not hold for late arrival (we arrived at 9:00 pm) when not booked directly. I had to explain explicitly that our two night stay had been pre-paid and with subtle eye rolling (seriously) I was allowed the keys to the room. Included with the rate is a free breakfast buffet or one item off the breakfast menu. We booked the room for three people and did pay the additional fee for the third guest. We received only four breakfast coupons for the two days we were there. We explained that we had three people in the room and had indeed paid for the third guest . We were told in no uncertain terms \\"you only get to breakfast coupons per room\\". Moving on to that issue of parking. You have the choice of $25 a day for valet or $22 a day sir self park. Wanting to have the availability of our car without bothering anyone we chose self park. Again made to feel this choice was in poor taste!  The room was spacious and well appointed on casual glance. Unfortunately beauty was only skin deep. The pillows were lumpy and uncomfortable, dust and dirt in corners, and the shower head and faucet were loose from the wall. The ceiling was bubbled, cracked and peeled. Towels were not thick and soft-like would be expected in this type of hotel. The blow dryer was inoperable.

For years even with the growth of so many competing similar it remained for me and others the most mouth watering steak menu. \\nIn recent years not only has competition of newer and bigger venues caused havoc with Sullivans but their unwillingness to maintain their product and service level quality has become widely noted. As business has diminished from the heydays a decade ago they have gone through managers and GM's like water through a fire hose and worse yet the product has grossly suffered.\\n\\nWhile I don't get to go as often in recent years and yes with opportunity to try newer venues, I did dine with a business associate a few years ago. I had raved about the steaks and had high expectations. Well it was disheartening when both of us were thoroughly disgusted with the two NY Strips that arrived at out table. I felt bad apologized but had quietly hoped it was an anomaly and wasn't willing to write off. Though the often publicized team turnover, the attempts to draw more business through \\"cheaper fare service nights\\" and and lower priced bar entree menus did raise some concern about the future.\\nOk so fast forward for Fathers day my daughter flew into town and knowing how much I and she in years past loved  the steaks and service at Sullivans surprised me by taking me to dinner there last night Sunday eve.\\n\\nTo start with the store was very quiet given it was after 8pm so no crowds or harried servers. Our server, lets call Ed ,....Ed.....had the personality of an walnut, and seemed to both of us just simply disinterested. Not to say he wasn't attentive he was but was somewhat hurried, matter of fact and just plain bored with his job. Most odd was unlike most servers today who are 20 somethings and move from job to job Ed was a middle aged individual who seemed to be within his career field as a professional server. but clearly the \\"steam\\" was gone.\\n\\nDinner... well to jump to the end dinner meant the very end for me as a Sullivans fan after nearly 15 years.\\nI only ever order without exclusion the NY Strip Steak. Most often the smaller size which like it's bigger brother in years past has always made my mouth water just thinking about....In its heyday this steak was a a very thick 100% gristle free melt in your mouth cut of beef. \\nHowever it was anything but that a few years back when last I had with my business partner and again last night had to rank as one of the very worst steaks you might find downtown. It was presented as a breakfast thin piece of meat. Worse yet it was nothing but chewy gristle and while I tried so hard to hide from my daughter she quickly saw how frustrated I was. She was taken back by the presentation as well. Given the hour, her own dinner enjoyment and ED's overall personality or lack thereof I decided it is what it is and now the routine fare at Sullivan's....this standalone $36 piece of steak is precisely what you get at the Outback or a Longhorns for exactly half the price or a third of if include the sides.\\nTo re enforce the overall degradation of quality now at Sullivans the Asparagus we ordered to share between us, once always presented as a most succulent choice thin and perfectly cooked stalks were primarily the cheaper thicker cuts and very chewy.\\nMy daughters petite filet \\"appeared\\" to  me to be fine and while she made no comment I chose to not sample in the end. \\n A coupe of final notes. I saw another customer at the bar who had also ordered the full size Strip and I took careful note. While it clearly appeared and presented as a much better piece of meat more along the lines of its former self it still could be easily seem to have fat and gristle around the edges. In either event why the smaller version is not a a section of that but rather a completely separate cut of \\"breakfast\\" like cut steak is now beyond me....other than dollars and cents.\\nAlso while I was still finishing my streak for good or worse as I was hungry and had so looked forward to, my daughter finished hers, in between was the asparagus plate with one remaining stalk. When Ed removed her plate he matter of factly and without question removed the asparagus plate which I had been eyeballing to finish with my entree off the table and was gone. We both just looked at each other dismayed.\\nSullivans is a chain store they have now clearly opted to cut corners to make up for their customer count loss over the years. They have ignored their past roots and return customers and now present inferior product at the same very high end prices. As corporate is disconnected from local and staff changes like the wind there is no sense of past or past product quality and customer expectation of so sliding cheaper product in is their choice.

It's a stone's throw away from Pioneer Square and the Arlene Schnitzner Hall. I have heard of Brazilian grills and have yet to try it.  I heard of this new place from a friend and I had every intention of making reservations when it opened. Still do. As luck would have it, I got to preview the place tonight and I must say, you are in for a treat.  \\n\\nWe arrived early and even though we were told that they were running behind, we were seated pretty much on time.  We did wait for about 5 minutes or so, it was long enough to sit at the bar and order a drink. I like that the bar is at the front of the room when you walk in.  Most places have the bar tucked in the back or off to the far side. There are bathrooms on the restaurant floor and more downstairs.  \\n\\nIt was a full house and space was tight. There was a lot of dodging around other patrons, servers, and meat handlers.  Why yes, meat handlers. I don't know what their official title is but these people go around the room looking for the green coaster on your table. Flip it to green and the meat handlers will stop at your table to tempt you with delectable meats like bacon-wrapped filet mignon or chicken breast, pork ribs, or ribeye. It is a wonderful meat parade. If you are a vegetarian, stay away.  I can't remember the exact number of meats available so I'm going to say there was more than 8. \\n\\nThere is also a salad bar that is not like your usual buffet salad bar (thank goodness!). It would be nice to have signage to let you know what kind of salad was being offered but I'm sure if I really wanted to know, one of the nice people in charge of the salad bar would have told me. Speaking of which, I must mention the large wheel of cheese. At this cheese wheel is a guy just digging into that cheese as if it is his only job. (Can you imagine having a job like this? People ask you what you do and you tell them that you cut cheese. Pun intended.)\\n\\nThey have a nice wine collection.  You can see it behind a glass encasement. It's a floor to ceiling display of wine.  We didn't even pour our own wine the entire night.  Every time one of the staff saw that our glass was low, they would fill it back up. Same with side dishes. Along with the salad bar and the meats are some side dishes that go along with the meal.  According to the website, there are more side dishes but you'll have to request them specifically. These are such things like beans and rice. What they do put on the table is fried polenta, fried plantain, and garlic mashed potatoes. There is also a basket of cheesy bread rolls. All very delicious. \\n\\nThe staff is very nice. Granted this is the second night and there are probably some kinks to work out, everyone was friendly and eager to please.  There was a small error on our bill which was easily corrected. Props to the tall, blond server (I wished I'd gotten your name to give you a proper shout-out) for remembering which wine we ordered. That was amazing to me considering the the all-around chaos of a pre-grand opening. I like when people know their stuff. \\n\\nDessert was also delicious. I had the strawberry creme which is fresh strawberries blended in ice-cream and the sweetheart had the papaya creme which is the same thing but with fresh papaya. There were other offerings like creme br√ªl√©e, chocolate mousse and cheesecake to name a few. Our desserts were light, just as the server said, and it was a perfect end to the meal. It might not have looked as fancy as a creme br√ªl√©e but it was perfect. \\n\\nAnd that, my friends, is that. \\n\\nP..S. Fogo de Chao does offer valet parking."},{"name":"California Pizza Kitchen at Polaris","address":"1500 Polaris Pkwy, Ste 1238","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"CPK is a chain, but it's definitely one of the better chains.  You'll pretty much always get a really good, high quality meal here.  You will pay for it, though.\\n\\nThey used to have a location at Easton as well which closed.  This location at Polaris is easy to find as it's right at one of the mall entrances, and there's a huge parking lot.  They have a patio section for outside seating as well.\\n\\nService is typically pretty good, although on this occasion the server seemed to really be rushing us out the door.  We kept saying we wanted to take our time, but she kept coming back asking if we were ready to order.  Then when we ordered dessert she said \\"So, you'd like that to go?\\" and seemed disappointed when we wanted to eat it there.  \\n\\nThe food, though, was excellent.  Try the avocado club egg rolls.  Delicious, crispy rolls chock full of bacon, cheese, and avocado.  We opted for the kung pao spaghetti with chicken and the Sicilian thin crust pizza.  Again, both were excellent.  The spaghetti was perfectly al dente, and the dish was definitely spicy and chock full of peanuts.  The pizza was crispy, and the meats were robust and hearty and complemented by the basil and oregano.  For dessert we went for their seasonal strawberry shortcake dessert.  Not bad.. lots of strawberries, but the cake seemed more like a scone than a shortcake.  Still good, though.  Tip: their key lime pie is quite good.\\n\\nOverall the food was excellent at CPK as always.  I still have sticker shock sometimes at the prices, though.  Entrees are easily $15+ (including pizzas).  The dessert prices also seem crazy.  At least $8 each PLUS $2 more if you want a scoop of ice cream.  $2??  We do keep coming back, though....

Ordered carry out: funky roll (8.95) and dublin roll (11.95). They ended up charging me $22.45 for both which is not reflective of their menu prices online. And why would you tax me on TAKE OUT? The funky roll is supposed to have tuna, yellowtail and eel and green onions. Mine was maybe tuna, definitely cream cheese, and what appeared to be asparagus. Their rolls used to be robust and filling. Over $22 later and I am still hungry. The only redeeming factor is their half priced sushi til 6:30pm (dine IN only) that runs through the week and even on Saturdays. Skirting corners and skimping on portions it's no wonder they've resorted to groupons (only good on dining in).

From what I've heard from other servers in the Cambridge/Boston area, this is not a first.  Some have reported that at least a half dozen individual servers have been dropped for nothing more than a single bad review on the internet.\\n\\nFor me, this is a deal breaker.  I believe it is ethically important to patron businesses that treat their servers well.  Anyone who has spent time as a server knows that it is an incredibly demanding job, both mentally and physically.  It takes a lot of skill to juggle the orders of dozens of customers at once.  It's disrespectful, at best, and repugnant, at worst, to dismiss an employer because of an anonymous statement posted online.  \\n\\nAnd let's be honest, Charlie's Kitchen, as a dining experience, has always been subpar.

I can absolutely say that I enjoyed my time there. It was a nice atmosphere they managed to culture in there. I think those who have given this place an extremely negative view should give it another chance; I believe that they have changed a few things around including the menu.\\n\\nOne thing that I can't seem to shake off is the image that they're trying to pull off. It seems like they're trying to pull off a high end exclusive restaurant. According to my neighbor, she and her friends wanted to check out this place. They, however, were turned away because they did not have a reservation, yet according to her, the place was nearly empty. Yet, when I went, I noticed that some people who had no reservations -- keep in mind that it was very busy -- managed to get seats but not everyone. From what my observations if you looked like a businessman, you had a greater chance of getting seated without a reservation. I wonder if the whole reservation system is a way for them to maintain a certain clientele. Either way, it seems like you should try to reserve a spot.\\n\\nWhen I was there, I noticed that it seemed like other than my table, everyone had at least some gray hair. The server seemed quite nice.\\n\\nAnyway, onto the food. It was surprisingly good. It did take quite some time for the food to arrive. The Tuna Tar Tar (not sure why the elected to spell it that way over tartare) was beautifully presented. The tuna tasted fresh and had a nice subtle seaweed salad and sesame flavor. The pickled vegetables that went with it were quite subpar; it was incredibly sour and acidic. I love pickled vegetables, but this was just very disappointing. \\n\\nThe Margarita pizza was okay. The thin crust was well done, but my chief complaint was that they went way too cheap on the basil! On the entire pizza there was no more than four slivers of basil. The pizza sauce was not worthy of note. The tomato slices on top were a nice touch, but they should have chosen some really nice flavorful tomatoes rather than plain boring ones. The pizza was not horrible for the price and the quantity served.\\n\\nI also managed to try their burger and steak. The steak was well cooked, but I can't say that it was truly something spectacular. The price was definitely a bit steep. The burger's price was still a bit steep. It was a significant step up from a McDonalds burger, but that isn't saying much. I think they used a potato bread bun that really added a nice sweet touch to the burger. If you're in a rush, the burger will do just fine. If however you have some more time on your hands and a means of transport, there are significantly better burgers at a much better price point around.\\n\\nOverall this place is \\"A-OK.\\" I think it beats having an abandoned building there, but again, that's not saying that much.

Although it was a memorable 5 star experience on my last dinner visit, this evening was not as perfect as I had hoped.  Unfortunately it was missing a lot of the wow-factor and most of our food was average at best.    \\n\\nWith it being the 1st game of the NFL season the place filled up very quickly.  It's a bit swank here but you can dress down, it's Austin so no worries.  Raquel was our waitress, she was superb the whole night.  Very responsive, customer service oriented, and smiled all the time.  \\n\\nSelect bar appetizers and cocktails are $5 all night long, and there are a couple of beer specials too.  I started out w/ the Tavern Sliced Steak which came out timely and was excellent, a great deal for $5.  My party arrived and we ordered the Blue Cheese Chips and their \\"Best Burger In Town\\".  I was so looking forward to that piece of meat.  \\n\\nUnfortunately we were disenchanted in regards to the overall quality of these dishes.  The chips were like regular potato chips drizzled w/ blue cheese and crumbles, some green onions.  It's really no big deal, but I guess I was expecting a little more from a respectable steakhouse - perhaps a thicker cut of potato and a more robust dish.  The burger was far from the best, it just didn't taste that good.  I had it cooked medium-well but it was dry, the bun didn't taste fresh, and I was expecting a much juicier and tastier burger.  I'm sorry, but it doesn't compare to some of my hot burger spots around town.  \\n\\nAnother Debbie Downer was the fries that came w/ the burger.  My friend caught on quickly to a \\"fishy taste\\", we couldn't make out so we looked through the menu and didn't see any fried fish.  But then a-HA!!

I actually re-joined yelp just to sing Sapori di Napoli's praises. Service, food, atmosphere (for families or adult friends), authenticity- this is the Italian restaurant in Atlanta that I've been looking for for almost 7 years. \\n\\nLong version:\\nWe came here w/ a party of 11 at 7:30 on a Saturday night. We had a reservation, and our table was ready for us when we arrived- a good sign right off the bat. We had 1 small child and 2 tweeners with us. We were all treated with incredible hospitality. From the moment we walked in the door until we walked back out of it, we received spectacular service. And despite my obnoxious family, um, not making our server's job any easier, he remained uncommonly patient and cordial. Humorous, even, but without treating us like a captive test audience for his standup routine like some servers tend to do. One of the best examples of customer service I've experienced in a long time.\\n\\nIt was my mother's birthday, and without going into specifics, I'll just say that the restaurant really rolled out the red carpet for us with some extra touches. She said later that it was the perfect restaurant for our celebration, and she meant it. The restaurant staff made us feel like they were celebrating with us.\\n\\nThat brings me around to the atmosphere. Our fellow diners also made us feel as though they were celebrating with us. I don't know if I would call it romantic (although it was rainy and cold- I could certainly imagine a nice night on the patio), but I would absolutely call it fun, energetic, conducive to conversation and group- and family-friendly. I would feel equally comfortable coming here with children or with a group of fellow 30-somethings looking for adult conversation over a few bottles of wine. Quite honestly, it reminded me of some of the trattorias I've been to in Italy (but more fun than many of them). \\n\\nLast but the opposite of least, the food was much, much better than I anticipated. Just outstanding. It is readily apparent that the guys in the kitchen are from Italy and that they're genuinely recreating the food from back home. I've spent time in the Naples Bay area, and SdN's dishes- from the salumi antipasti (one of the best I've had in town) to the pizza (right there w/ Antico- better Diavola, actually) to the pasta (hand made pasta, great sauces)- were not only authentic but better prepared than half of what I've eaten over there. Speaking of the pasta, I notice that relatively few of the reviews of this place even mention it. That's really a shame, because quality homemade pasta isn't easy to find in Atlanta, particularly at a reasonably priced restaurant. (Pro tip, Atlanta- you'll start enjoying your meals more if you drop this ludicrous \\"Neopolitan pizza wars\\" mentality. It's embarrassing. /rant)\\n\\nA couple items: \\n-The parking is free on nights and weekends. The lot is a bit small, but if it's full, it seems you can reasonably expect a spot to open up fairly quickly, as they seem to do a decent bit of takeout business.\\n-I'm not sure if you're still supposed to order at the cash register or not. They graciously seated and served our large party at our table, but I don't know if that's the norm.\\n-I still need to find out if they allow you to bring your own wine for a corkage fee. That might be mentioned in one of the previous reviews, or of course a quick phone call will answer that.\\n\\nSummary: Don't go here expecting to be reminded of another place in town, and you won't be disappointed. Can't wait to go back."},{"name":"Buffalo Wild Wings","address":"6000 North Terminal Pkwy","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"First off food wise it's a Buffalo Wild Wings, so the menu is pretty standard.

I eat this dish often in various restaurants and am familiar with raw tuna.  I stopped eating, not wanting to risk it before my 15 hour flight and moved the plate into the center of the table. The server passed by my table and offered me a refill on the iced tea, which I accepted. She did not inquire about why my meal was virtually untouched when she offered the refill, nor when she delivered it.  After 20 minutes or so she presented me with the bill (no offer for coffee/dessert, nor an inquiry about the tuna). As I paid the bill for my non-eaten lunch I asked her if she was going to ask me about why the meal has been left and she appeared shocked that she should ask. I told her that after tasting it I was concerned it might be off and she immediately started to tell me that was \\"that's impossible, we have the best seafood\\". I don't doubt the quality of the produce the restaurant orders, but it's not \\"impossible\\" and not the reaction of someone concerned with customer service (or my wellbeing if in fact it was off - the jury is still out...).

I absolutely enjoyed this food!  I am a huge fan of Ethiopian food and have had it in other states many times over.  \\n\\nI have a friend who is a foodie like me and is always interested in tasting new cuisines.  I took her and her granddaughter with me.  My friend absolutely loved it and her granddaughter liked everything but but the bread.\\n\\nWe ordered three dishes and shared them all.  I decided to try this place because it had a good number of reviews on yelp and the majority were  good.  As soon as we walked in and I saw Ethiopians there eating I KNEW this was an excellent place.  When you go into an ethnic restaurant and the people of that ethnicity are there---that is a SEAL of approval!\\n\\nThe only reason why I did not rate this a 5 is because the service was not good.  Every time I needed something I had to find the waitress.  Other than that it was an excellent experience.

From the soft crunchy bread to the cole slaw to the [nontraditional] mesclun and tomato on top, and finally the mindblowingly delicate and tasty catfish...it was fantastic.

The bar area is great for gathering and sharing a drink before dinner. They had us seated in a semi private room towards the back of the restaurant. The area held a table for about fifteen people. It was a really great atmosphere for celebrating -- not too secluded but we were set apart from the other diners and we had a floor to ceiling glass wall to see straight into the kitchen and what the chefs were creating. The events coordinator worked with us to provide a limited menu, customized with the birthday girl's name. Really cute. The food was also good. Seasonal and unique. There were plenty of veggie options, some fish, and a variety of tasty meat choices, too. The desserts were also decadent. I would love to go back and dine in the main area with the full menu but I definitely recommend 4th & Swift for celebrating special occasions with friends."},{"name":"Park's Edge","address":"913 Bernina Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"i think we should have just gone for brunch like everyone else b/c it sounds like the food's a touch better (although now I don't think we'll ever return).  \\n\\nWe went late one friday night after friends highly recommended it for dinner.  So we were looking forward to a delicious meal.  The location is nice and quiet and we sat on the patio.  Initial service was fast but once our drinks came out, it's like she forgot all about us and only came out for her obligatory taking-of-our dinner order.\\n\\nFor appetizers we shared the scallops which she raved about.  I was hoping for a nice seared scallop, instead the 2 scallops lay limp in a pool of salty sauce.  Almost like it was sitting in soy sauce, no nice sear at all.  The dinner menu itself was incredibly disappointing, with practically every dish with mashed potatoes and broccolini as sides....that's really boring and lame.  I ordered the seared red snapper that I don't believe was seared but rather floured and pan fried...but soggy and not crunchy.  The sauce was also funky and did not pair well with the fish.  Sadly, the only items that were edible were the boring mashed potatoes and steamed broccolini.  My husband ordered the lamb medium rare.  It came out medium done and the flavor was fine, not great.  \\n\\nNow our waitress never came out to check on us, we even had to ask another waitress for silverware since ours was removed with our appetizer dishes.  Then when we got our check, she charged us for a $12 glass of wine we didn't order.  When my husband brought it to her attention, her reaction was quite suspect.  She wasn't terribly apologetic, just matter-of-fact.  So he thinks she did that intentionally in case we didn't check our bill.  \\n\\nAnyway, we were both terribly disappointed in this place.  The food was just awful and we spent close to $80 for our meal...what a waste!

Baja Breakfast Sandwich on a Garlic Bagel  is delicious!"},{"name":"Sun in My Belly","address":"2161 College Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"In need of a trendy cafe for brunch? Just hop or skip on over to Sun in My Belly. I love how this Kirkwood cafe's is housed in a old hardware store right across from MARTA tracks. Sun in My Belly can get slammed, so definitely plan your brunch arrival time appropriately. They are open for dinner, but I've only tried brunch.\\n\\nSo far, I've dined on Alison's Famous Pimento Cheese Omelette ($11) and the Belly Benedict ($14). The omelette was awesome; if you like pimento cheese and bacon, get this, no question. The only downside to this dish was that the egg wrapping seemed to be the skimpiest component actually; if they could toss in another one, that'd be swell. Luckily, pimento cheese and bacon were plentiful. I could even taste a little smokiness, I thought. The hashed potatoes are generous chunks seasoned appropriately. I was a little wary since sometimes larger pieces can be tough inside but the potatoes were soft and delectable.\\n\\nThe Benedict is accessorized with a chipotle hollandaise and comes with bacon hash, sauteed spinach, and a buttermilk biscuit. I was worried about the spice level of the hollandaise, and I thought it was spicy when I had it, but the kitchen can certainly put it on the side for you, no worries. The garlic-spinach saute was way garlicky, excellent. The biscuit is quite scrumptious also. Overall, a tad salty, but still recommended.\\n\\nSpace is at a premium here. The parking lot behind the restaurant is minuscule; be ultra-careful backing in and out. Street parking is another option. And you may have to do some shimmying; the tables are pretty close together, and the aisles are narrow. If there's something I don't like while dining, it's having your chair/coat/bag repeatedly bumped by passersby. Sigh. The service is fine, no issues in that area. The kitchen sure is efficient; I got my omelette in less than 10 minutes."},{"name":"Phnom Penh","address":"244 E Georgia Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Perhaps one of my favorite stops when we are in Vancouver BC.

As others have stated, the outside is depressing and parking is what I would consider unreasonable.  We experienced the same uninspired check in staff others have commented on.  After paying for parking, we realized that there was none available when we returned.  Another front desk staff was happy to refund our fee, but at the expense of having to wake up before 8 to begin paying for street parking.\\n\\nUnfortunately, we wouldn't have been able to experience much of a sleep-in anyway as housekeeping entered our room at 9 am, knocked a half hour later, and attempted to enter again around 10.  All very strange since we were only staying one night.  Our room was also located directly next to the laundry chute, which squeaked loudly and slammed shut the numerous times it was opened.\\n\\nOur particular room was laughably small, very loud from the air conditioning in the wall, the shower curtain was over a foot short from side to side, and the view was entirely of the top of the next building.  I do have to say the bed was extremely comfortable and wonderfully cozy.\\n\\nWhen we checked out, we were asked about our stay.  I relayed our experience to the woman at the desk, and she was clearly listening and writing down our concerns.  She apologized profusely, and I assured her we weren't looking for any sort of compensation.  She offered us free breakfast which we declined (my husband was set on Pine State Biscuits!), and asked if we were planning on staying there again, but I nicely told her probably not.  \\n\\nHer interest in rectifying the situation plus the comfort of the bed are the reason it gets two stars instead of one."},{"name":"Havana Bistro and Caf√©","address":"7975 S Orange Blossom Trl","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"I have to give this place a 5 star because not only is the food outstanding but the owner makes you feel at home.

The recent sale of $4 for (6 boneless wings OR burger OR 4 tenders) AND a side of fries is actually a good deal. I'd suggest you get the tenders as the new boneless wings are INCREDIBLY small, like, smaller than Chick-fil-A nuggets. After mentioning that to the cashier, he said multiple people came back after getting their food to complain about the portion.\\n\\nLike I said before, your experience is totally different every time you visit.

The lunch menu was a standard Italian-American menu - the regular Eggplant Parmigiana, Chicken with Ziti and Broccoli, Lasagna, etc. etc. I chose to have the chicken with sausage and peppers. The bread that they brought was warm - not a good rustic crusty bread, but still pleasant when eaten with butter.

The rest of it was just as if someone had left the pasta in the pot and forgot about it for 10 minutes, decided to serve it anyway, and dumped a jar of microwaved store-bought sauce over it. I ate the meat and left all of the noodles.I'm surprised by all the decent reviews - you can even see by the pictures that the food is swimming in watery sauce and grease!

It was 9pm on a Friday night and they had run out of pizza dough.  Crazy, I know.  But rest assured, this Beacon Hill hot spot created by famous (and sexy) Chef Todd English, puts out some of the best pizza I have ever had.  Thank God they had the dough this go around.  A thin crispy crust with fun toppings is the name of their game.  Figs allows guests to order their pizzas half and half with a large array of specialty pies.  We ordered our first pizza half portobello/caramelized onion and the other half fig and balsamic jam, gorgonzola and prosciutto.  It was borderline ridiculous.  The fig and prosciutto side had so many flavors that combined to form beautiful artwork in my mouth.  Yes, it was that good.  The portobello and caramelized onion side was topped with a generous drizzle of white truffle oil and Fontina cheese.  The truffle oil was decadent and made such a happy marriage between the onions and 'shrooms.  It'd be hard to say which half was the better half on this pie.\\nThe other pizza we ordered was half Spicy Calamari special and half \\"Red Sox\\".  The calamari was perfectly breaded and fried-truly the best calamari I've come across.  It came piled on a spicy marinara with sweet peppers, arugula and topped with lemon aioli.  The saltiness of the calamari along with the spiciness of the sauce and the sweetness of the ailoi was darn right delightful.  The other half- \\"Red Sox\\" was a more traditional pie with Italian sweet sausage, peppers, onions and interestingly drizzled with a honey mustard aioli.  This pizza also, won awards in my book.  If you're ever in Boston, go here.  Then, go again.  \\nThe pizza is ridiculous, the ambiance is dark and candle-lit with laughter and loud conversation galore and the service is satisfactory.

The Boy had a bacon cheeseburger, also the regular size, with lettuce and extra pickles, ketchup and mustard, and we shared a large fry (\\"large\\" is an understatement! wow!

Good flavor, good value, definitely meant to be shared (I'm guessing I could probably share the smaller size portions, too!).

By the time I reached home, I found that it leaked inside my car as one of the box in which Malai Kofta was stored was actually broken. The lid of that box was completely shattered and it really pissed me off. I had to clean my whole car to get rid of the smell. When I called to report this, the person at Aab was not at all apologetic instead offered me to go back to the restaurant and get that particular box replaced. I seriously don't understand why people just don't get the meaning of 'service'. I would drive back 4 miles just to get a replacement box of my dish?? And with a horrible attitude of that person??? My overall experience was aweful and I would never return to this place. Also their Malai Kofta dish was pathetic. I think they completely misunderstood the meaning of that dish.

This ain't it.\\n\\n\\nBeen coast to coast, back and forth, up and down. For time immemorial (or at least, ever since I got my driver's license), my restless, vagabond spirit has sought to appease its seeming eternal cravings, forever wandering in pursuit of the Best BBQ in the Universe. Predictably, there's a long list of coulda-woulda-shoulda bbq eateries littering the landscape, both at home and abroad. There's an even longer list of the woeful, clueless, and ignominious, aka the \\"never, EVER shoulda trieds \\". A place may earn distinction for doing one particular dish better than just about anywhere else, then fall hard into mediocrity w/the rest of the menu. Then there are places like Famous Dave's, which rates a little above the curve on a couple things, and falls well behind the curve on the rest. From everything sampled, Famous Dave's do a couple of things pretty well, and a couple others go straight to \\"Why did you even bother\\" infamy.\\n\\n\\nFirst, their service was EXCELLENT and the place was spotless. Can't give them enough credit for this. Star numero uno!\\n\\n\\nSecond, their variety was quite good, and I liked their well-disseminated baskets of sauce. \\"Devil's spit\\" was laughable as far as Scofield Units are concerned, but it was zesty and flavorful. Thanks also for offering catifsh-- though I'm still trying to determine what to make of the breading. Star numero Dos!\\n\\n\\nFinally, their sides were good---they made the corn muffins fluffy and super moist, without feeling the need to avalanche your ass w/too much sweetness or shortening (Podnah's please take note). Really enjoyed the broccoli as well--but how hard is it to do steamed broccoli? Sometimes what you DON'T put in a dish is at least as important as what you do, and I'm very grateful they didn't drown the one uncontested healthy part of our meal w/a bunch of faux nacho cheese or other bull-crud. Add 1/2 star for the sides.\\n\\n\\nWish I could add more stars for the Main Event-----the meat(s), but that would be a slap in the face to the many places that manage to get it mostly right---even here in as white bread a big town as you'll see, this side of Boise or Cheyenne. This is a BBQ joint, after all, right?... can't expect a critique to overlook the Main Event out of sympathy for the inspiring rags-to-riches story of Dave. Even if his story is only 10% truth and 90% myth/hype, the man is doing some good in the world and I wish him delirious levels of success. Who knows, maybe he condescends to read some of these anonymous reviews, and turn them into positives. Here's hoping so. Onto the meats...\\n\\n\\nThe sliced pork evoked distant memories of  Safeway deli's Chinese sweet 'n' sour pork--- and upon further reflection,  may even suffer by comparison.\\n\\n\\nThe chicken was ok--- tender w/an understated, was-it-in-the-back-of-the-pan-and-miss-most-of-the seasoning insouciance. Wish it was more overstated. Wish it were more \\"souciant.\\"\\n\\n\\nThe hot link was fairly spicy, and enormous. So far, so good. But hate to say it, tasted just a little like canned cat food smells. Do I wanna see how their sausage is made? Actually, I do!\\n\\n\\nThe ribs were ok. Wanted to like them more. As another Yelper pointed out-- even Tony Roma's figured out how to do great ribs--- how hard can it be???\\n\\n\\nThe Brisket was unspeakably bad. Tender w/o having any of the virtues that normally go along with it. Very fatty cuts, yet incredibly, very little flavor. How in the WORLD did they manage to do that? The fat is usually what gives it most of the flavor...! This brisket has the HUGE misfortune of being the first I tried since enjoying My Brother's 5 ka-jillion star Brisket. That sets the standard till further notice--at least for this Yelper.\\n\\n\\nThanks Dave, and sincere wishes for your ongoing success. 2.5 stars may seem stingy, but it wouldn't shock me to check back in years to come, and be forced to modify my star rating..."},{"name":"Joe's Crab Shack","address":"600 E Riverside Dr","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"The redeeming quality of this restaurant is the view.

The skin is fluffy, the fillings are juicy and flavorful. They are even better than some of the best Baos I have had in Asia. There is so much craft and precision that goes into making each of these and the price is well worth it. Below are my reviews of each flavor:\\n\\nPork: probably my favorite and a crowd favorite. Juicy but not greasy. You can tell that they use very good ingredients as the pork is firm but not tough, yet moist.\\n\\nLobster: this is my second favorite and their special offering. It is an unexpected flavor, a combination between west and east. It kind of reminds me of ginger and scallion lobster dish you get in Chinatown, but with some corn and other western twists.\\n\\nVegetable: Simple and light, with some dry tofu bits and green veggies (bak choy maybe?). It is more flavorful than you would expect from a veggie-anything.\\n\\nCurry beef: this one is pretty filling, a little sweet and savory. the beef is nice small chunks with carrots, the curry is closer to the Japanese/Asian curry than Indian curry. If you like any curry, this is the one to get.\\n\\nI am also pleasantly surprised by the low calorie count of these. Two buns will probably fill up an average appetite and will still be under 600 calories."},{"name":"Hook Line & Schooner","address":"4600 W Village Pl, Ste 3009","city":"Smyrna","stars":"3.5","text":"The grilled crab legs and chargrilled oysters were great.

I found Z'Tejas via Yelp, but I regret not asking the locals what is a \\"good\\" Tex-Mex restaurant. \\n\\nFirst, I'll start with the good. This franchise location had a nice patio deck area where my boyfriend and I had our brunch. We went on a Saturday morning of Memorial Day Weekend, which was surprisingly not busy. Also I was feeling the DJ who was playing a really good mix out on the deck as well. I started my brunch off with some delicious cocktails! I had the cucumber jalapeno margarita and prickly pear margarita. The cucumber jalapeno margarita was very light and refreshing--perfect for the hot and humid weather. I love eating prickly pears, so I instantly loved the flavor and sweetness of the prickly pear margarita. Our waiter was the bomb! I wish I could remember his name. He was a young, nice guy, and he was super personable and highly attentive. Since my boyfriend and I weren't around here, he took the time to give us a list of some trendy, obscure bars that only the locals would really know about. \\n\\nThe not so great about Z'Tejas was the food unfortunately. I found the food being far from Tex-Mex. My meal, in particular, lacked the Southwestern/Tex-Mex flavors I was hoping for. I ordered the breakfast relleno, and my boyfriend ordered the chicken and steak fajitas. The breakfast relleno is just an Anaheim pepper stuffed with an omelette. It did come with a green and orange sauce, but I found both sauces bland. My boyfriend's fajitas were pretty basic and no better than fajitas from Chevy's."},{"name":"CK Shanghai","address":"15 Washington St","city":"Wellesley","stars":"3.5","text":"I have been going to CK Shanghai for years and when they first came to town I thought the food was first rate. Lately, however, I find that quality is slipping. This week, I got into Logan at 8 and wanted to settle down in front of the presidential debate at 9. Called CK from the Pike - ready in 10 - picked up when I got into town - enjoying hot and sour soup at 9 in front of the tv - all good. \\nOn the positive side, the people who work there are so nice and the hot and sour soup is consistently delicious. However, the Sesame Chicken was overly sweet, heavily breaded and way overcooked. The tangerine beef - same deal. My biggest problem is that the menu never specifies whether the dishes are breaded or not, with veggies or not.  Both dishes were accompanied by overcooked broccoli. I think our takeout meal was probably one of the last they prepared for that day. But for $35, it should have been freshly cooked and as good as if we walked in at 5.
