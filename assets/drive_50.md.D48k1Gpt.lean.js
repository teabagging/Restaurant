I just returned from a 3 week trip to Europe. I had a bit of jet lag Sunday morning and woke up early. It was a pleasant surprise that I found Phoebes to be open at 7:00 AM. Since I was alone, I sat at the bar. At this time there was one couple sitting at a table and a family of 5 at another. The waitress was not that great. I had to ask her for water 4 times. My crab cake Benedict was good. My main issue? The TV 5 Feet from my head was blaring Fox News. I make it a point not to patronize businesses that have Fox News on when I walk in. That's my preference. Since no one was watching, and, I was forced to, or, leave my meal uneaten, I politely asked the waitress if she could put it on a different station if possible. She did not. Though I know people's political views are different, I felt like I should be able to enjoy my meal in peace. I will not go back. I tipped the waitress over 20%, though in retrospect, I probably should have been less generous. My friends and I eat out about 5 times a week.

I came here with my mother and little sister because my mother remembered taking me here as a child and wanted to share this with my sister. Well disclaimer we came on Black Friday so it was a wee bit busy but nothing crazy. Walked in and were walked to our seats immediately. The male host with glasses tried to seat us next to an aisle and my mother asked to sit next to the wall because she doesn't like people walking into her or having my sister close to a busy walkway. The host told us that he would but the other server of that section just got sat and so he couldn't seat us there. Well the female manager with glasses came over and said it was ok. So we sat down and immediately ordered an app from the computer thing on the table. Our server took a while to come to us and when did seemed to not care. We had to ask a few times about crayons and paper for the lil one. Our app came out. We got the chips with salsa and guac. Well don't bother. There isn't enough of either of the guac or salsa for the chips. As we were waiting I decided to sign up for the rewards program assuming I would want to come back. Couldn't do it on my phone but could on the computer. Well we waited and waited and waited for our food. The lil ones pizza finally came out and we continued to wait for our food. Now I would have forgotten the time if the two tables who came after us hadn't eaten , finished, paid, before we even got our food. The other four top in our row had the server go up to their table and the lady asked about the food and the brunette server looked at her and said yeah it's Black Friday, crazy huh. Shrugged her shoulders and walked away. I feel like the was the definition of a server saying idgaf. I ended up busting out laughing and so did the middle two top table. The server wasn't ours but I couldn't believe she would respond like that to a mother and her two children who as we talked is also a server. Our male server came over three times. I paid the bill before we were done because I just wanted to leave as soon as possible. We waited 45 mins for our two burgers. The male server that took care of us didn't care. Best part what was he could tell we weren't happy but I doubt he wanted to tell his manager considering the burger behind is in a burger was wrong somehow and already had to have the manager over. So honestly I don't plan on coming back to red robin. The only person in that restaurant that I dealt with that didn't piss me off was the female manager with glasses.

It's LEGIT.\\n\\nThank you Andy Ricker for gracing Portland with the dishes you deliver. \\n\\nFamous For:\\n- IKE'S VIETNAMESE STYLE FISH SAUCE WINGS (***Get it spicy***)\\n\\nWhat have I tried (from my several visits)?\\n- IKE'S VIETNAMESE STYLE FISH SAUCE WINGS: Ahh yes, the infamous chicken wings! I've had them spicy and regular and I prefer the spicy version better! Comes with pickled carrots, radish and cucumber to cool your palette from the zing of heat! Great with sticky rice or just by itself! This is a popular dish and is available all day long! I like that they give you some wipes to clean your fingers from getting down and dirty!\\n\\n- PAPAYA POK POK Over the years I have built up a spice tolerance, but this one takes the cake! Eaters beware! This thing is really delicious but can leave your tongue tingling from all chili seeds surprising you in every corner! The spicy green papaya is quite authentic and you might want some sticky rice with this one! [**spice alert**]\\n\\n- YAM MAKHEUA YAO (eggplant dish) is a little spicy but not so much. It's do-able and I love that the eggplant is cooked oh-so perfectly! Served with some fish sauce, shallots, diced up boiled egg and cilantro - which are all incorporated into this lovely dish! Great for a side and wonderful for your average heat palette! \\n\\n- PHAT KHANAENG (brussle sprout dish) is a milder spice than the eggplant. If you're looking for something for veggies to your meal, this might be a go-to! My cousin doesn't even like eating his brussle sprouts and the way they grilled and cooked this baby had him going for seconds! Seriously! \\n\\n- MUU SATEH (pork satay dish) I preferred this dish over the ribs! I loved the peanut sauce and this TOTALLY complimented the satay! There about 4-5 pieces of satay available. If you're unsure what to order, this one is a safe bet if you're not going for something totally outrageous!\\n\\n- KAI YAANG (chicken dish) You can order 1/2 bird or full. We opted for the 1/2 since we were going to endure a bunch of other goodies. The chicken was cooked moist and great with white rice if you're not into sticky rice. Comes with two sauces: One is savory soy-sauce based and the other is a sweet/spicy sauce which is a good surprise to the dish! If you're unsure what to order, this is a safe alternative if you're not going for something totally outrageous as well!\\n\\n- KUNG OP WUN SEN (prawns cooked in a clay pot dish) This is a simple dish and the noodles cooked in the clay pot reminded me of Filipino pancit bihon. It was a simple dish for me. Was quite decent in my book.\\n\\n- SII KHRONG MUU YANG (ribs dish) I probably wasn't a big fan of the ribs. On paper it sounded the best thing to order and we had to have it. But when we got the dish it was kinda dry and more bone and barely meat. Came with two dipping sauces: 1 savory and 1 sweet but wasn't a big fan of the whole thing overall. I thought the sauces had more oomph to the dish than the meat itself. \\n\\n- MUU PAA KHAM WAAN (boar dish) If you can't really handle spicy food, but would definitely like to try out some boar, this is highly recommended. Not because it's going to make you want to eat more rice or pickled veggies to counter-balance the heat, but because the dish is so gosh darn yummy you don't care how spicy the heat level is because you're getting a good dose of flavor and kick you probably won't regret having your tongue so scorched! [**spice alert**]\\n\\nDrinks: I've never really had the alcohol here because I REALLY LIKE their DRINKING VINEGARS! I know the sound of drinking vinegar sounds like blasphemy, but let your guard down because it's just a simple flavored syrup that they mix with club soda or something along those lines to make a refreshing drink! I really like the LYCHEE, PINEAPPLE and TAMARIND ones!\\n\\nAwards and such:\\n- Andy Ricker: James Beard Award - Best Chef of NW (2011)\\n- Featured on Food Network's Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives [3D's] (and another place I would agree with Guy Fieri!)\\n- Featured on Food Network's Best Thing I Ever Ate\\n- Noted on Yahoo article's for \\"Best 20 Restaurants in America\\"\\n- Noted by the Daily Meal in \\"Top 101 Restaurants in the U.S.\\" (Ranked 12th)\\n- And many more awards throughout the years!\\n\\nFYI:\\n- Expect to wait for dinner approx. 1 hour or more.\\n- Depending on the time you go, depends on the menu (they don't offer everything all day) There's a menu for lunch 11:30 - 2:30 pm, mid-afternoon 2:30 - 5pm and dinner from 5 - close.\\n- Parking is on the street/nearby neighborhood streets.\\n- Yes this place used to be Andy Ricker's House! \\n- If you live on the East Coast, he just opened up a chicken wing place in NYC!\\n- If you don't want your nice $$$$ coat smelling like SE Asian food, I recommend not wearing it here.

You may find better steak and seafood places, you will also pay a lot more and that is why I love this place.  Great place to take friends, co workers or a date and have money after for dancing.\\n\\nSo I have been here more than 7 times now at both their downtown and Arboretum locations for all the occasions mentioned above and usually on my own dime and its still a great place as mentioned in my much shorter review.  I'll start from the top.  The wine selection is a really good one to complement your meal - especially the Malbecs/Cabs and Pinots.  I've tried the filet (mainly 12 oz filet) but also the Ribeye, plus filet with crab and bone in filet and all were prepared and tasted a fantastic medium rare.  I've also tried the scallops (wonderful), sea bass (good), swordfish (good), and sole (really good).  But you have to leave room for their family style sides of truffle mac and cheese (really good) and crab fried rice (really good).  Their veg sides are also really good but at some point your stomach needs to decide between that and dessert and I'll suggest you punt the veggies for their blackberry cobbler and dark chocolate mousse.  Yeah it will be that good and you have probably already had to loosen your belt and if on a first date had to excuse yourself from all the deliciousness to catch your breath to focus on your date.  I forgot to mention the oysters or crab cake.  So quickly, not the best selection but good and the crab cakes have alot of lump crab.  Finally the service.  The service I have had has been great every time I've been here.\\n\\nSome recs:  Make reservations.  If going to the downtown one save 20 min and use the valet.  Don't get the chicken ( I saw one reviewer had a bad experience because she got the chicken so you are at a steak and seafood place - get the steak or seafood).  If you want chicken go to a chicken place.  Come hungry and wear a belt to loosen later or for the ladies a nice dress that can hide a swollen belly after that dessert.  Enjoy!  As noted, I have paid alot more for steaks in this city, NYC and most major cities in the US.

In fact, I joined Yelp to just write about how great this place is and how bad Kasbah is.\\n\\nEver since Ararat met its unavoidable and expected demise, I've been wanting to check out Phara's. 4 of us went there today, Sunday night at 8:30pm, to end my birthday weekend. The interior is like a breath of fresh air with all the carpets from the wall removed. But the backyard/patio was the real treat. With string lights hanging over head and nice music playing, the atmosphere couldn't be better.\\n\\nThe staff was amazingly nice and friendly - 1 thousand trillion times better than all the staff at Kasbah combined....+1. Phara herself came and greeted us. We ordered the appetizer sampler and it was definitely above par. I ordered the Lamb Shank, which is worth it if you can spare $21. I barely touched it and it fell off the bone - lamb this tender and juicy is hard to find. Definitely try the habanero garlic sauce.\\n\\nAs for my birthday treat, Phara - who was not belly-dancing that night - put on her whole costume and danced for a good 30 minutes, including a very nice happy birthday song. Of course, the free baklava helped. We tried the mango ice-cream - pretty delicious.\\n\\nHookah - we got the double apple mixed with mint, and it just kept going and going. We went through 2 coals and finally gave up trying to finish the tobacco. I felt their tobacco was pretty good quality. Phara told us where we can pick up good hookah supplies besides Arabic Bazaar.\\n\\nSo let's see, atmosphere - cozy and relaxed; staff - friendly and helpful; hookah - best yet in town; food - arguably the best middle-eastern fare in town.\\n\\nNext time you get fed up with the service at Kasbah or are just wanting to hang out with friends and chillax with a hookah - hit up Phara's."},{"name":"Terry Black's Barbecue","address":"1003 Barton Springs Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Okay!

The biang biang noodles were also great, the textures of the noodles, tofu, and lamb worked well together. The lamb kinda reminded me a chilli, it had the same consistency and I saw a few beans in there. But after having the sloppy joe, I thought it would've been nice to get something with maybe a chunkier consistency. The green papaya salad was just okay to me. It reminded me a lot more of a coleslaw and even though it was listed as spicy it didn't pack too much heat. It was also a lot drier than traditional papaya salad and didn't have that a lot of the  flavor that comes with fish paste/fish sauce which I felt took away from it. I definitely prefer the Thai/Lao/Cambodian version of papaya salad. The gai lan was pretty delicious, but I felt like it was a huge plate of vegetables and a bowl of rice that they just added onto the menu to fill you up in case the food wasn't enough. I'd rather they just added a different dish. \\n\\nThe Cheap Date Night Menu also offers 1 dollar off dessert so we got the Michelle's Affogado.

It's chicken and gyro over rice. It comes with a small side salad. I think it's just lettuce, tomato and cucumber. However, sometimes I see pickles in there. I always order some pickles and [red] onion on the side. I am not sure but I think the onion is mixed with a bit of sumac. Whenever I  cook at home and prep a side of onions for kebaps, I add tons of sumac and parsley to the onion mix. Maybe that's why I can't really taste it in their mix.\\n\\nMy boyfriend and I used to drive all the way down to their UT location prior to their Braker Ln location opening. The drive was always worth it. Seems like this newer place is short on staff. I know they were quite busy during Ramadan and all but now that it's over, there are times when the line is quite long. I don't think it has anything to do with the cooks nor food preps, rather the cashier and/or person taking the orders. \\n\\nI tried calling in on two occasions to place an order for pick up and no one answered the phone. Another time after waiting in line, once it was my turn to order I had to wait while the register was used by another person because he was ringing up a pick up order. I see two registers on their counter but sometimes two people share one. One looks older than the other and I have never seen it being used. Does it work? If not, just get rid of it :-p\\n\\nBut I digress, once an order is placed the wait is usually not very long. The staff is always very friendly and quickly give you extra stuff (yogurt sauce, hot sauce, extra pickles etc) upon request without giving you a look. Y'all know what 'look' I'm talking 'bout. The one you see at other places where they either charge for extra stuff or give you just enough to shut you up but with a look that makes you feel you're being a cheap, greedy f*ck if you ask for more but deep down you know you'd like more.\\n\\nYou should try their mint lemonade (made in-house) at least once - it's quite refreshing.\\n\\nP.s. the pic of the combo I posted only contains gyro meat, no chicken.

The tofu curry with coconut rice was the biggest disappointment. 13.50 for two mounds of rice and some cubes of tofu seems crazy. The rice didn't really taste like coconut and the tofu was pretty bland, not at all what I consider curry flavor.

It is exactly a mile from his place, which thankfully merits us an excuse to drive here. We came on Sunday, and I had very little time, so rather than waiting in line (probs 15 minutes) we sat at the bar. \\n\\nThe menu had SO many things that I wanted to try... I ended up getting an omelette w/ cheese, bread, and a strawberry banana smoothie. The smoothie was refreshing, not too sugary, and fresh. I would totally stop here just to get a smoothie to go! I accidentally forgot to order an egg white omelette, so I got really sad when I saw the yellow egg come to my plate. Thankfully, Greg saved the day, talked to the waitress, told her it was our fault but that we would want another omelette. She was very nice and got us a new one within 3 minutes, and only charged us the minimal amount for a new egg (like.. $1.00).  I don't know how much merit my review of the egg can give, since the waitress made it not the chef.... but it had the perfect amount of cheese in it! \\nThe bread was some special type, that was thin kind of like a bun, but had a lot of flavor... I would complain about the butter though as it seemed like margarine \\"I can't believe its not butter!\\" .  Spend a few extra bucks for the real thing.\\n\\nIt was interesting sitting at the bar, as I am pretty sure the people next to us were on a first date.. or as greg said ,\\"the morning after\\".

Even if you're 30 and look it (I'm not, thankyouverymuch) the bouncers will look you up and down distrustingly as they scrutinize your ID and credit card. Once in, the bar is PACKED with sorority-type girls and the grossest of white-hat frat boys I've ever seen. It's nearly impossible to get around the bar. \\n\\nThis all would have been okay (and they might have hung on to three stars) if the following situation hadn't occurred. My roommate and I decided to hit up Whiskey's for a few drinks before meeting friends a little bit later. I ordered 2 drinks and handed the bartender my debit card for the bill ($15 for 2 weak drinks). Instead of putting the slip and card on the bar like a normal person, she tried to hand me the slip, card and a pen, all with one hand. Since this is almost impossible, she dropped my card behind the bar. I went ahead and signed the slip while she looked for it, certain that I'd be getting my card back a few seconds later. Nope. She can't find it. And isn't really willing to look since there's tips to be made elsewhere. She glanced around for a minute or two and called the manager over. He told me I could call back around 3:30 after they closed to see if anyone came across it while cleaning. No apologies, no comped drinks, and no way for Lisa to pay for the rest of her fun night out. Even though I was seething a little, I did in fact let a friend buy my drinks for the night and called back at 3:30 like instructed. No card. They can't find it. Now, if you've seen the bar at Whiskey's, you'll know there's only a limited place it could be! So why the hell can't anyone find it? They told me to call back in the morning, just in case. So I did. And they couldn't open the register to tell me if it was there, so they told me to come in in a few hours. Since I was headed that way anyway, I did. Still no debit card and no way to pay for ANYTHING ALL WEEKEND. Where the hell could this thing have gone?!?!? I spoke to another manager who couldn't explain where my debit card could be residing and still didn't offer an apology for my inconvenience. This is completely unacceptable. I understand accidents happen, but I don't understand treating your customers like they're disposable.

They deftly handled these and fried the chunks ever so perfectly to the point of perfection. Love this dish, favorite of the evening, hands down. The Cobia and Escolar were distant seconds. Might I add, the Escolar also had a sweet potato component :). The Cobia very much reminded me of the walu walu at Uchi. That dish is also reminiscent of citrus, tart, sweet, and rich unctuous fish swimming in a delicious broth meant for bowls to be brought to lips and shunned from spoons. \\n\\nAnd the desserts!

They took our name and phone number down, which was nice because we could explore the area while we waited for our table to be ready. This was pretty much perfect timing, because a lot of the local shops close at 6. \\n\\nWe were seated after exactly an hour. Our server (Candace?) was very friendly, knowledgeable, and efficient.

The plate looked underwhelming when it came out, but I was very impressed with the food and it was just the perfect amount, leaving room for dessert. It's not like average restaurants where you're served a ton of mediocre food. This food was quality and very delicious. For dessert I got a vanilla cream puff. They're as big as your fist, so definitely enough to split, or to take some home.

Their wine selection isn't huge but the quality is great and I enjoyed it. I highly recommend ordering by the bottle because the glass is but a few sips. Not sure why they located themselves right next to a wine store though. I ordered the sausage flatbread and it was like cafeteria food quality.

Even after ordering, she had to come back to our table to ask if I really wanted my burger with no bun since she forgot to mention that to the kitchen. After quickly responding Oh god yes ha she fixed that situation. But then the wait for the food began. A burger with no bun and veggie Totchos (nachos with tater tots is an ingenious idea, especially for marketing the place) should NOT take over 45 minutes to make. In the meantime, we did get to see the table next to us receive their finished check devoid of the credit card they gave to pay it which surely made us more confident. \\n\\nThe only saving grace was that the food was pretty good. My burger was well cooked and the onions, lettuce and tomato were fresh.

So this time I went there today and told them I was in a major hurry so I wanted to order for take out. I sat in the lounge for ten minutes and no waiter came so I walked up to the bar to ask the bar tender to take my order. I ordered two cauliflower appetizers and two Parmesan chicken dinners to go. I saw the bartender then find the waiter and give him the order and I saw the waiter put my order into the computer. I'm waiting and waiting and the waiter still didn't acknowledge me to even offer me water for at least another 15. He then comes over with the machine and NO itemized bill and the machine says it's just over $54 so I paid it and tipped him before I even got the food. The receipt I got was from the bank machine, not an itemized receipt. A few min later, he brings the bag and I walk out, I drive home and I notice it is missing one dinner although I made it clear I ordered the same thing for my partner and I. So now we're home and had to share dinner and I called the manager to tell him the deal to be told they didn't charge me for two dinners anyways and that they could cook another one free of charge. I explained my partner just got out of serious surgery from a broken neck two hours before so it's impossible for me to come back and get the other dinner. I explained he wasn't allowed to eat after midnight and this was his first meal post op. Again the manager reminded me that I wasn't charged anyways. Screw the money. The point is they screwed up my order. I then told the manager that since I can't come get the meal to just mail me a gift card. He now says he had to talk to the manager higher than him to do so? What a gong show! The appetizers were plain and gross and the service got my second time now was worse than my last review. Bad customer service.

Upon getting off the freeway to go to this place we were a little hesitant. Born and raised in Clark County, Hazel Dell area wasn't particularly a destination of mine. Usually I like to venture into Portland to eat out. I told my mom, \\"this parking lot reminds me of a dive bar\\", and she told me that it used to be a sports bar called The Hideaway. However the sign looked new and cute so we ventured inside, and I'm really glad that we did. The interior was really cute. It had a nice country atmosphere and everything was clean. The people working there were very nice. We both ordered brunch and opted for the Virginia Girls Eggs Benedict. Griddled tomato, poached egg, hollandaise sauce, and bacon on a wonderful toasted piece of sourdough bread. It came with the option of fresh fruit or hashed potatoes. I went for the hashed potatoes. When I first received the plate I was a little concerned by the lump of potato mush, but it was actually surprisingly good! Everything on the plate had a lot of flavor, but it wasn't all over the place. All of the flavors went perfectly together. I'm going to be honest, I wasn't expecting much from this place. I thought it was going to be one of those places I'd go to, feel fine about, forget about it and never return. I was definitely wrong. I highly recommend their brunch, but I'd like to go back to try something from their lunch/dinner menu. Moral of the story: don't judge a book by its cover.

There were also pots of herbs and long plantings of rosemary in the spacious patio dining area outside. BTW, they take reservations! Score!\\n\\nThey have the open kitchen concept, and it was so interesting to see the Sous Chefs at long wooden tables just before the kitchen, using their knife skills and preparing the produce for the Line Chefs to take to the next level. \\n\\nWe expected it to be trendy, and possibly a bit pricey (you get what you pay for with fresh produce).

Really creamy and scrumptious.\\n\\nMy husband tried the Umami Burger for his main dish. It was a nice sized piece of grass-fed beef, cooked to a perfect medium, mushrooms, caramelized onions, mayonnaise, arugula, and parmesan, surrounded by a fresh, soft, flax seed bun. A Kale, Parmesan and lemon chopped salad came on the side and was very tasty, kind of like a really healthy Caesar salad.\\n\\nI opted for the Fish Tacos for my meal. Two grilled, light and moist fish filets on corn tortillas, topped with avocado, greek yogurt, cilantro, a crackling fresh cabbage slaw, pickled onion and sprinkled with tangy cotija cheese. Fresh, flavorful and filling!

The first meal was the go-to combination of roast beef and chowder. The chowder was excellent, lots of clams, wonderful flavor. The roast beef this time was too well done, and a bit dry. For all their wonderfulness I don't know why Kelly's doesn't have bbq sauce available at the condiment bar. Sometimes I order extra sauce on my sandwich and get too much.

Having been tormented by it being a \\"Hot New Business\\" on yelp, dining partner Errol was twitching from not having yet written a review.  There was a coincidental Memphis Tigers basketball game on in the dining room.  In a battle not unlike the battle of fried chicken being waged throughout the South, Memphis was battling their Kentuckian nemesis in Louisville (sorry, Colonel).  There was a good buzz, and lots of happy customers.  Tables were available at 7pm.\\n\\nHostess Gus pointed the three of us to a four-top (no purse-hooks here, so we needed an extra chair for the lady) right in front of the kitchen. After concerned looks from my dining partners, I spotted a better table being abandoned by departing customers.  I flagged down Store Manager Gus, who said it needed to be cleaned, and went to track down a rag.  My dining partners tapped Hostess Gus again, who just said \\"No, it's too dirty\\", instead of giving us the opportunity to wait the 45 seconds to get it ready (it just needed a wipedown). So, +1 for Store Manager Gus!\\n\\nOur needs were catered to very nicely by Server \\"Tony\\" Gus.  He was prompt, available, but not obtrusive, putting to good use the skills he gathered in his Hospitality Management studies at the University.  When he asked what we'd like to drink, I couldn't imagine anything other than \\"sweet tea\\" at a place like this, and our plastic \\"souvenir\\" cups never went empty.\\n\\nBeing the good yelpers we are, we wanted a good sampling of stuff.  We started with fried green tomatoes.  $1.35 per slice seems a little steep.  They were served with an uninspired plastic packet of premade ranch to dip in, like McNuggets.  Our main order consisted of an eight-piece \\"family style\\" meal (2 breast, 2 leg, 2 wing, 2 thigh, plus beans and slaw).  We added a mac-and-cheese, because... Duh.  Mac and Cheese!  No truffle oil here (nor would I expect any).\\n\\nWhile we waited (not long) for our food to arrive, another couple yelpers were leaving, who had visited the original Gus's up in Memphis.  As her review described, Gus's can be a 5-star experience, but ONLY if you notice you are making orgasmic moans with every bite.  Since we didn't hear anything of the sort, our expectations were set.\\n\\nWe kept asking Server Gus if there were any Family Gus here at the restaurant, and he said there were, and asked if we would like to meet one.  It felt sort of odd, especially while service was really getting busy at that point.  But Family Member/Corporate Gus did come out to meet us.  He spoke a little about the history, the plans for expansion in Austin/Texas.  He brought a passion to fried chicken like I've never seen before.  Later, Server Gus told us that our short conversation with Family Gus \\"made his night\\". \\n\\nI want a place like this to be divey, and not have to negotiate metered parking amidst all that construction downtown.  After tip, our tab for three was over $60, which, for a down-home meal and no alcohol, doesn't feel right to me.  I did LIKE the chicken, but I wasn't in love.  None of the sides were really memorable, and the pie was, well, a little wet. \\n\\nI am bumping this up from a 3-star review because when I, a professed white-meat hater, convinces a fellow dark meat lover to just try the breast because it was easily the juiciest (but not greasy) flavorful piece of white meat fried chicken I have ever had, I have to consider more than just an \\"A-OK\\" rating.  The chicken is the star of the show here, as it should be.\\n\\nSince the upscale fried chicken shop \\"competition\\" has already established base on SoCo and N. Burnet, I can only assume after they establish a following here, a new Gus's will be opening somewhere with parking, either east (11th?  6th?) or South (Lamar between the river and Oltorf?) or maybe in Oak Hill.  \\n\\nAnd I'll probably just get a take-out plate, and pair it with my own sides at the house."},{"name":"Gus's World Famous Fried Chicken","address":"117 San Jacinto Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Good?

My wife's vegetarian broth was surprisingly flavorful, with the distinct yet subtle aroma of dried shiitake mushrooms in the broth.\\n\\nService was friendly and efficient.  The two waitresses covering front of house seemed a little overwhelmed (the restaurant was packed on a Saturday at lunch time), but they made sure we had everything we needed, and the food arrived pretty quickly.\\n\\nI tend to favor more traditional preparations, so I'm not sure Xi Xia's offerings exceed the already superlative noodle soups to be found at Jiu Thai or Chinese Beef Noodle Soup.  But there's not doubt that the folks at Xi Xia know how to make a noodle, and soup to accompany it, and therefore they're a welcome addition to Columbus' Chinese food scene."},{"name":"Alqueria Farmhouse Kitchen","address":"247 King Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"One of my favorite places for dining out!\\nGreat service, fanatic food, and easy parking.\\nLove it!"},{"name":"Baretto","address":"10710 Research Blvd, Ste 314","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Yesterday, my partner and I decided to make our first \\"reconnaissance mission\\" and check-out the neighborhood's newest arrival.

The first dish was the dan dan noodles with spicy peanut sauce. I don't even know why we ordered this since it's not even a traditional dim sum item. It was served in a novelty takeout box to appease the non-Asian crowd. Next came the crispy salt + pepper calamari and jalapenos. By jalapenos, they mean two. Plural - still counts! The batter was soft as was the actual calamari. They were completely under seasoned with no hint of salt or pepper. Again, not really a dim sum dish. The crispy pork belly bao was fried instead of braised, which took away a lot of the flavor. Mine had the tiniest evidence of half of a daikon slice. I hate myself for getting one for $4. The shiitake mushroom and chinese greens potsticker dumplings were even worse. No hint of any shiitake because whatever greens they used completely overwhelmed anything else in flavor.  Lastly, the tea smoked ribs were over-salted. \\n\\nThe only enjoyable item was the lychee soda, which came with actual bits of lychee.

I don't consider myself to be picky with restaurant food but I couldn't ignore the problems.\\n\\nI was shocked when one of my wife's crab cakes benedict was served with an overcooked solid poached egg. They replaced ONLY the egg, and it took the kitchen so long to get her a new egg that the crab cake was cold by the time it came out. The side of hashbrown casserole was also barely lukewarm, although the flavor was great.\\n\\nThe beets in my beet hash were inconsistently cooked. Half of the beets were undercooked so I couldn't stick my fork into them. Half of the beets were fine. It was also served with guacamole which was really spicy. The underside of the scoop of guac was brown (oxidized), but overall I loved the smoky flavor of the beets in this dish.\\n\\nThe nutella crepes were ridiculously tiny and so tough and chewy I could barely cut them with my fork. They were barely edible. I thought crepes could only be undercooked or overcooked and crispy, not tough and chewy? Three teeny tiny crepes run $9. The strawberries in the berry compote were mushy so much that I didn't touch them even though I love berries. The texture reminded me of strawberries that either were frozen or rotten.\\n\\nEven the chocolate chip pancake had problems. The first pancake was visibly burnt and tasted it too. If the server who delivered our food heard us remarking on how it looked burnt, he turned and left instead of addressing the issue. Our table's server replaced the pancake. I enjoyed the replacement because I like mushy pancakes, but unfortunately the chocolate chips were crispy and burned because the chocolate was directly exposed to the griddle. I thought it was pretty easy to make chocolate chip pancakes? We were charged $1.50 to add chocolate chips to the pancake, an upcharge not listed on the menu or by our server.\\n\\nOur server wasn't very attentive although the restaurant wasn't busy, and was especially absent after we got our food. \\n\\nI visited with my young baby and although there is a changing table in one of the restrooms, I wouldn't consider it a kid friendly place. I brought a very small, maneuverable stroller and could barely get it in and out of the restaurant as the aisles were very narrow. If the restaurant had been full, it would not have been possible.\\n\\nEverything on the menu SOUNDS amazing but the food clearly doesn't live up to expectations or the hype around this restaurant.

This place is a knock-off of how the food should be presented and flavored.

The down side is the lack of authenticity and the sides are extremely small.  I had lamb and green (Goman) with Injera (Bread); when it arrived it looked like a Mexican fajita dish with a small scope of Gomen and a lack luster piece of Injera.  The waiter realized that the Injera provided wasn't going to be enough and proactively brought me a few pieces.  The additional pieces he brought were really good, but the dish was just WRONG... hunks of lamb with onions, peppers and garlic which weren't really processed (finely copped).  When I walked in, I should have looked at peoples dishes and realized this wasn't the place for me, but I didn't and I was completely underwhelmed.\\n\\nFor those who love this place, PLEASE go and try another Ethiopian place, probably even the one in lot shared by Desta will give a better prospective of how the cuisine should taste.

I am literally standing at the front door looking around waiting to see if someone will welcome me, say hello, how can I help you. Something!! The guy at the bar and another guy literally looked right past me. Didn't even smirk or smile. No wonder it's dead and they are offering a discount. They need it!! Why because their Customer Service SUCKS!! Big time. I got tired of waiting and just walked out. By the way, their bathrooms were dirty. The toilet is broken, meaning it moves when you sit down, and instead of the soap dispenser, they are cheap and bought one from Publix. Not that that's bad, but it's the fact that you can tell it was running low so they added water to fill it back up. Hence the soap is diluted. This place needs a whole new internal remodel and teach their staff customer service. Might need a whole Restaurant Rescue and make over!! The food may have been good last time I was here, and may be good in general. But Service is Everything. If you don't have that, you most certainly won't have business. They just lost a customer! I will not be going back. \\nOverall, I recommend don't waste your time. If you want great service, this is not the place!"},{"name":"The North End","address":"","city":"Boston","stars":"4.5","text":"Being half Italian this part of Boston is special to me.

I finally got to try it out this past Sunday and the results were very good.  I went with a large group (nine people total) specifically to try their $7 Sunday menu.  They must have over 20 different appetizers for you to try for only $7 a plate.\\n\\nAppetizers ordered:\\nSpreads - tzatziki (yogurt), htipiti (red peppers), skordalia (potato), melitzanosalata (eggplant) - served with grilled pita bread\\nGrilled oysters\\nDolmades - grape leaves stuffed with tomato, bulgur (whole grain), cumin yogurt\\nCod fritters - served with potato-garlic puree\\nBaby beets\\nGrilled octopus\\nSteamed mussels - served with feta cheese\\nSeared tuna\\nGreek meatballs\\nGreek potatoes - potatoes cut into disc shapes (served with ribs and also more tzatziki to dip in)\\n\\nWe also ordered one Lavraki (Greek sea bass), the pork ribs, and loukoumades (Greek doughnuts) for dessert.\\n\\nWhere do I begin?  First of all, everything was delicious and skillfully prepared.  The tzatziki (yogurt) spread is most common at Greek restaurants.  I think everyone at our table agreed the skordalia (potato) spread was the best, a little thicker and tangier than the rest.  It had a really nice texture.  Another hit (relatively speaking) was the grilled octopus.  I've never eaten octopus prepared in this fashion.  I've only eaten octopus raw (in sushi).  The grilled octopus tastes very different from raw octopus and tastes more like you're eating a land animal than seafood.  The wood-grilled flavor is strong.\\n\\nThe dolmades have a small kick to them and just melt in your mouth.  The octopus and baby beets are served with yummy microgreens.  The sea bass is served to you whole, including the head, but it is completely deboned, which is very convenient.  Most people would think of the head as just decoration, but you can eat the collar meat from it.  It also comes with a side of kale.  The mussels are steamed with feta cheese, so the bottom of the broth includes tasty bits of feta.  The spreads, sauces, grains, purees, etc. were all quite good and we made sure to eat every last bit from our plates.\\n\\nFinally, we had loukoumades for dessert.  These are the equivalent of Greek deep fried doughnut balls that are soaked in a honey syrup.  Needless to say, those were delectable.\\n\\nService was excellent.  Our server was Corey and he was very knowledgeable.  The manager came to check on us once.  The entire time we were there, there were two men playing bouzoukis (Greek \\"guitars\\").  I thought that was a really nice addition to the overall ambiance.  The older gentleman started playing a great rendition of \\"The Godfather\\" theme towards the end of the night.  Valet parking here is $2 not including tip.\\n\\nCoincidentally, Kevin Gillespie was eating a couple tables away and said hi to us on his way out.  He said on his Facebook page the next day, \\"I had one of the most amazing meals I have ever had last night.  It was at Kyma in Atlanta.  Every dish was as flawlessly executed as I have ever seen.\\"\\n\\nOverall, Kyma offers some of the finest Greek food in Atlanta and it's probably my favorite of all the Buckhead Life restaurants.

The surroundings are definitely \\"Greek\\" and if you've ever been to Greece you'll notice that sensibility has carried over.  It's got high ceilings and is very comfortable. My only quibble was that the music was a little loud on our most recent visit, but not overly so.\\n\\nService:  We sat at the bar and the service was terrific.  Our bartender was very helpful in choosing wines for us (we tasted several before settling on two we liked very much) and he struck the right balance of being there when we needed him and absent when we didn't.  \\n\\nFood:  This is where Kyma really shines.  I'm sure they have great non-fish dishes but the fish there is SO GOOD that we just can't bring ourselves to order anything else.  We had a dorado and an Arctic char that were both prepared grilled with just a minimalist touch. The dorade had a caper butter sauce and the char was grilled with olive oil and herbs.  You have to be VERY confident in the freshness of your fish to serve them that plainly because the fish is going to shine through.  In Kyma's case, it shined brilliantly.\\n\\nValue:  Like I said, it is a bit pricey with many fish dishes running about $40-43 per pound (you get less than a pound so the net is in the low $30's) and single glasses of wine are mostly $12-16, but the quality is outstanding and there are lots of appetizers that are much less expensive and very filling.  We could have had 2-3 appetizers each and been nicely full but, like I said, they just do SUCH a good job with their fish...

Smart, given the family-oriented neighbourhood they've opened in.\\n\\nSo about that coffee: delicious -- the clear star of this beauty show. The ever-popular pour-over method is done to perfection, and the deep, rich espresso in their Americano highlights the smooth quality of their beans. Any coffee nerd would give their stamp of approval to Matchstick. This one sure did. \\n\\nI'm on the bandwagon, and have no desire to jump off anytime soon."},{"name":"Vancouver Christmas Market","address":"1055 Canada Place","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"I feel bad that there are so many bad reviews of this place.

I was so excited about this dish... but disappointed with the actual execution. This was more of a take on paella, with orzo and chorizo not really coming together, accented with a fried egg, Grana Padano, avocado, and a charred tomato salsa, plus fresh tomatoes. The dish was hot but the salsa was cold, which was a little unpleasant. \\nLES BOULETTES: BF's pick, spicy moroccan lamb meatballs with poached eggs. This was a more successful dish, and the tomato stew was much spicier than anticipated. The heat was mellowed out by the \\"raita\\", which seemed to be more of a seasoned sour cream, and accented with black olives. \\n\\nDespite the fact that our server seemed to be helping half the tables in the dining room, she came around frequently and was attentive and personable.

I was pleasantly surprised by the authentic Indonesian flavor they were able to incorporate into the dish and the level of spiciness they added to it. It was delicious and a MUST order when visiting this restaurant. \\n\\nThe Filipino Blooming Fun Yun was also good. It is served with a side of banana ketchup which is a common sauce in Filipino cuisine. As a Filipino, I am not sure how this dish was Filipino aside from the banana ketchup.

I'm pleased to give a drastically improved review while my belly is perfectly satiated, my tongue reminiscing the lovely bold flavors of my meal. \\n\\nI was asked to give Counter Culture another try, both by Sue, owner and cook, and by a patron who holds the restaurant dear to his heart. I was eager and willing to appease Sue because I love to see that, while my review was very low (one star) she was genuinely concerned with the quality of both food and service at her business, and she was confident that my unfortunate first visit wasn't a true reflection of Counter Culture, itself. And she was right. \\n\\nI went to lunch alone today. I love doing that. To sit alone at a restaurant, it gives you a chance to soak in your environment more clearly than if you are distracted by company. It causes you to have a silent conversation with your food instead of your food being the silent party at a group's table. I felt a bit swept away to somewhere nondescriptly exotic as I enjoyed the breeze and the beams of sun shining through my umbrella down onto those iconic turquoise tables. \\n\\nI ordered a coffee and the Raw Bruschetta to start. \\n\\nTheir sugar is made by Domino, made in the US, and is certified organic. They offer either soy or almond milk with coffee - I had soy, it was lovely, simple and just what I wanted. It's easy to get a bad cup of coffee at a restaurant at lunch. This was fresh, refilled promptly and piping hot. \\n\\nThe Raw Bruschetta: First thing that struck me was the boldness of flavor in the pesto and cashew cheeze, and that they played very well with each other. It's topped with fresh, diced tomatoes - robust and firm. The bruschetta itself (housemade flax crackers), being raw, must be tricky to make. But they have achieved a texture that is firm, not crisp, but just right, with a healthful, grainy flavor. When you bite into it, your teeth make that slight chop like you're cutting through a very al dente pasta. Then there's a chewiness that smacks of granola and is very pleasant. This dish works very well. At $5.00 for just two \\"bruschetta\\" crackers, I thought the price staggering for the portion - but when eating here you have to keep in mind that fresh, local, and organic ingredients, which are cornerstone of Counter Culture, cost more, and that cost is passed on. They make up for it with providing a very satisfying product. \\n\\nFor my meal I had the Quiche of the Day - today it featured roasted tomatoes... and onions, anaheim peppers and spinach. \\n\\nMy first thought was \\"How does one make a quiche - by definition, an egg dish - without eggs?\\" The answer is \\"At Counter Culture, they make it very well, indeed.\\" The quiche is fluffy and flavorful, with texture a bit looser yet surprisingly similar to a traditional egg quiche. It lacked salt but they provided me with salt, pepper and two choices of hot sauce. It was delicious and I'm munching on it now from my to-go box!\\n\\nFor my sides I had the roasted vegetables and kale salad. \\n\\nThe kale salad is delicious - crisp, fresh and perfectly dressed with the most flavorful carrot slices. Its simplicity is perfection. \\n\\nThe roasted vegetables are to die for. I took my first bite of a sweet potato and my mouth exploded with flavor - sweetness, savoriness, peppery, just the right amount of heat and a nice firm roasted skin gave way to a smooth, creamy center. Sue later told me her vegetables are cooked in coconut milk, which is more healthy and certainly bursting with flavor. I can honestly say I've never had a better vegetable dish served to me at any restaurant. The beets were well seasoned and tender, the cauliflower was just soft enough with a nice crisp bite to it. \\n\\nMy service was wonderful - the server was training a new hire. They were both helpful and gave me just the right amount of attention, and the server from another section refilled my coffee at one point simply because he was doing so for his tables and was being attentive. \\n\\nThis was a great experience and I think Counter Culture is on its way to accomplishing Sue's goal: Providing delicious Vegan food that is healthful and appealing even to carnivores - that her restaurant wouldn't be turned away for being bland or suffering from the common stereotypes of Vegan food. And while I have little to no experience with other Vegan / Vegetarian restaurants, I CAN say that, as a staunch carnivore, I thoroughly enjoyed my meal and will happily (now) cast my recommendation that people support this local gem while eating healthy, even if its just every once in a while!"},{"name":"Parish Cafe and Bar","address":"361 Boylston St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"Was here again recently in June of 2015, and this place was even better than I remembered.

I had heard great things and discovered their menu had a couple of vegetarian options, so I was totally in. Both times I've visited I arrived shortly before the lunch rush (about 11:45am) and it didn't take long to get through the line. The space itself is small but cozy and very inviting. I love that they offer outdoor seating and communal tables inside. They have their menu up on chalk boards and you order right at the counter. There's no sneaky business here, as their kitchen is viewable from where you order. \\n\\nOn both visits I ordered the Weezie's Cheesie. It was so freakin' good the first time that I couldn't pass it up the second time. It comes with veggie cream cheese, muenster cheese, honeycup mustard (I'm obsessed with this and need it in my fridge), cucumber, alfalfa sprouts, red onion, tomato, and is served on a toasted 9-grain bread. This sandwich is so big, it needs pierced with a skewer just to keep it together. Despite its size, both times I ordered it I ate every single bite. The tomato and cucumber are cut rather large but other than that the ingredients work amazing together and are proportioned well.

It was raining and this place had no wait and ample free parking. My husband had heard of the name before so we figured why not? \\n\\nWe were a little confused upon first entering but soon found out how it worked. You grab a tray, a paper plate, and start by scooping your own sides. Then you go to the checkout counter where they give you whichever meats you want and cups for drinks. I can never resist creamed corn so I got a heaping spoonful. My husband got himself potato salad and green beans and then we got sides we both liked and could share which were beans, coleslaw, and a slice of jalape√±o cornbread.\\n\\nFor his meat he chose pork ribs and brisket and I got a jalape√±o cheddar sausage link. It was $35 with drinks which was fair for the amount of food we had. They have 3 sauces on the table (regular, sweet, and spicy) along with paper towels and the normal fixings of bread, onions, and pickles are complimentary. We tried each of the sauces and all 3 were great, especially the spicy.\\n\\nI really enjoyed the creamed corn and beans but I didn't feel the rest was anything to write home about. The sausage was good at first but when it got to room temperature turned into a bologna like texture that I found unappealing. The cornbread crumbled and fell apart at the slightest touch of a fork, and the coleslaw was drowning in dressing. \\n\\nI would come back honestly for just the sides, but next time will try a more standard item like a chopped beef sandwich. It's not the best BBQ I've had in Austin, but I will say that it wasn't the worst either. The atmosphere is welcoming and the staff are nice.

So we'll go out in style - instead of the usual four paragraphs of Errol prose, I'm just going to list one particular night's prix fixe menu and tell you what I thought:\\n\\n1. A single Blue Point oyster, with a dollop of citrus foam - as I savored this slowly, I wondered why people feel the need to consume 144 of these on any given Travel Channel show. That's just gross. Incidentally, this comes with a flute of sparkly white, they gave me a cup of Cuvee. \\n\\n2. Sweet potato chunks, with chevre, green tomato, & kohlrabi kimchee - Barley's salad/light side course is always interesting & colorful. It makes me anticipate what's coming up next. \\n \\n3. Cured lamb loin with cottage cheese between a sour rye cracker - never had this one before. You know those cheese & cracker things you get from a vending machine? It was like a very cool version of that, from a very hip vending machine. Okay, that was probably my worst metaphor ever.\\n \\n4. Oyster mushrooms atop a pine caramel panna cotta with trout roe - I didn't get much out of the mushrooms, but the caramel panna cotta was amazing, a remarkable sweet and savory combination. I kept wondering how they did it.\\n\\n5. Steamed Cobia with romanesco in dashi & turnip - this was a magnificent dish. Totally freaking cool. A perfect square of fish in a Barley Asian dashi.  One of those \\"Just gimme a bowl of rice and more of this stuff\\" moments. Yes, please.\\n\\n6. Biscuit, apple butter, bacon - ever do a \\"tea service\\" with your daughter and her dollhouse? What you want is Barley's tiny little biscuits & bacon, instead of little cookies. Oh, these were very tasty. If they made them \\"Hungry-Man\\" sized and served them by the platter, the South would truly rise again.\\n\\n7. An Escolar piece, with sweet potato & radicchio - my dinner companion enjoyed this one more than I did, probably because I kept comparing it to the cobia dish, which was silly. My bad.  \\n\\n8. Beet gelee with tangerine & kefir - a mid-course palate cleanser. Clever. \\n\\n9. Duck, with broccoli & sesame - the best dish of the night. The best duck I've ever eaten. That's about it.  \\n\\n10. Pupusa, with shrimp mousse filling & escabeche - I thought the taste of masa overpowered everything else, and the total effect was too \\"heavy.\\" A little much for me. \\n\\n11. Hoe cakes with black eyed peas & hot sauce - Nobody does hoe cake like Barley. You've seen variations of this dish here before. Yummy.\\n\\n12. Wagyu ribeye, with bleu cheese & potato - they always do a last-course play on beef here. This time, I kept thinking of Don Ho's \\"Tiny Bubbles\\" - \\"Tiny Medallions, in my mouth...\\" Okay, I do a lot of internal singing at Barley. You won't notice.\\n\\n13. Whey panna cotta with citrus, beet, & coffee dirt - Kyle McSkinny does the best desserts in Austin and I'm not even going to try to describe his stuff, because I'm not really sure what it is most times. I'm just fascinated with what he makes up. \\n\\n14. Barley cake with sweet potato, whipped caramel, & brown butter - Okay, it was like three different cakes crumbled over whipped cream and chocolate, and we're looking at it trying to figure out which component was what and finally just went at it and started going, \\"Mmmmm, mmmmm, mmmmm!\\" because that's what you do with great desserts. A perfect ending.\\n\\nAnd some quick update points: It's now a flat $70 a person. There are optional wine and beer pairings. Make reservations. If there are two of you, the bar is still the best seat in the house. Plan on being there at least two hours. If you don't know something, ask. They will now ask you what kind of food allergies you have, and they'll work something out. You won't see the menu, because the Barley Experience is all about being awed and surprised with what you get next. It's always my favorite staff, the coolest ambiance, and I think the best restaurant in town.

I bought it in order to drink it, and yet I must wait because it's currently undrinkable. \\n\\nACTUAL REVIEW OF SHOP AND NOT A GENERAL RANT IN THIS PARAGRAPH:  Fortunately they had a variety of non-caffeinated teas, which I obviously need because I'm spastic enough without the caffeine, and I got something with honey and an Egyptian sounding name, and a rather yummy kruller type pastry.  Employees were friendly and helpful with my tea-newbie inquiries.  The tea was decent.  The kruller not too sweet, but just right.  The shop was busy even on a snowy day, and rather warm.\\n\\nSPECIFIC SHOP RANT: What really blew my mind was that they served hot tea in an iced tea glass.  Centuries of British and Chinese ingenuity and perfection of the teapot  and cup tossed right out the window.  Not only must I drink too-hot tea, I must grasp a smooth piece of rounded glass that is soon to be also hot, which then develops condensation to make the glass even more slippery.  No teapot to keep the tea I haven't drunk yet hot as I work to cool the tea I'm about to drink in a separate, shallower cup with a nice handle away from the heat.   Just a glass meant to hold a lot of ice and a plastic insert that holds the tea leaves for which they gave me nothing to place it on when I finally determined I could drink my tea.\\n\\nSo, probably won't be back. I'm sure they're relieved.  Hot tea in an iced tea glass . . . . *mutter*\\n\\nUPDATE:  I received a private message from the owner, who provided the usual 'we want our customers to be happy' note and that I can always make special requests to make my cup 'right' for me, which was nice.  I encouraged him to respond publicly to me here, although I don't know if that's still a thing businesses can do.  \\n\\nI'm just not that interested in tea itself to make the trip back, but if anyone manages to get iced tea served in a teacup at the sip house, let me know.  ;-)"},{"name":"Gold Train Express","address":"4530 10th Ave W","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Good food, great value, no ambience, cash only.

Quite the dilemma. So it was with a healthy dose of skepticism that I headed to Amrheins on Sunday. \\n\\nI'm happy to say that all fears were put to rest as soon as I stepped inside and saw the massive buffet awaiting my girlfriend and I- an omelette station, carving table, pastries, fruits, salad options, as well as numerous other traditional breakfast choices (eggs, pancakes, sausage, bacon) and a variety of lunch AND dessert options were all laid out. In short, the type of spread that you would hope to see if you're going to pay 18 bucks per head for an all-you-can-eat meal. \\n\\nMy girlfriend went primarily for old school breakfast and had good things to say about the bacon, eggs, and pancakes. I opted for the lunch side of things, and particularly enjoyed the tomato and mozzarela salad, honey barbecue chicken wings, and macaroni and cheese (which we both tried and agreed was amazing). While numerous wings and several servings of mac left me with little to no room for dessert, I was hard-pressed to pass on all of the cookies and cakes they had available.\\n\\nBrunch for two with coffee, OJ and soft drinks came to 50 bucks, but I couldn't argue the price after such a satisfying meal.

It's hard to pick a favorite, so I would honestly suggest going and trying both!! The Migas Poblanos is a little bit hearty due to the black beans, so just be aware of that.

The Swami is another popular choice around my office: brown rice with greens, carrots, broccoli, onions, raisins, tamari almonds, and their outstanding curry miso sauce.

The waitress kept telling us 'we don't move chairs' without any explanation.

I can cook it in my own kitchen (I buy habichuelas and gandules in bulk at BJ's) and 2. I have actual blood relatives on La Isla and 3. I grew up in the mecca of Puerto Rican food that is Chicago (i.e. the birthplace of the jibarito sandwich). It's also important to note, I'm super excited I found this place, randomly, while searching yelp for pasteles and discovered they have what is possible the ONLY jibarito in New England. \\n\\nSo alright, we find this place hidden, as the name suggests, in South End, and walk in completely famished. Worth noting, there are only three tables in the entire place, so don't show up with your mom's birthday party of seventeen. Anyway, we knew our order off jump. Having been in Boston several months, I've had jibarito on the brain for a while. Upon ordering, we were immediately scoffed at, because we asked for only one meat per sandwich and they serve up their platano goodness with a \\"tripleta\\" (three meats: roast pork, ham, and beef). So I can't order a jibarito de pernil (roast pork)?  Ok... Sidenote: the jibarito as created in Chicago, is typically one meat (usually steak, sometimes pork or another singular meat) sandwiched between gigantic fried plantains and topped with lettuce, tomato, American cheese, grilled onions, and garlic sauce. For experience's sake, we tried it their way. Complete with mayoketchup (the official sauce of Puerto Rico), pickles, and shoestring potato chips.\\n\\nI will not call this the best jibarito of my life. BUT I will say, the consistency of the platano was perfect, and this version of a jibarito is 100% alright in my book. I would definitely go to Mana Escondido before going a lot of other places in Boston, and it's refreshing to have a tiny taste of home without having to stray too far. Important to note, the arroz con gandules could use a little flavor pick-me-up, like maybe some salchicha (farmer's sausage) or jamon (ham).

They opened up recently in December 2019, so it was very new when I attended. They were also running their soft opening special which made the dinner price $25 instead of $30. \\n\\nFirst of all, they're an AYCE sushi and bbq place. They're also very new, and the place reflects that. There are three conveyor belts and booths on each side of the belt. On the belt, sushi and various sides such as salads, veggies, and rice keep turning for anyone to grab. On top of the belt, there are trains that deliver special ordered meats for you to grill. \\n\\nSince it's very new, everything's high tech. The sushi \\"conveyor belt\\" I mentioned is actually not a belt at all. There are shifting platforms in which the dishes float on. The meats are ordered on a tablet in the booth. Since you're not requesting to a server, I found this way is much more faster. Most of what we ordered came out in couple of minutes. The grill in the can be controlled digitally using buttons such as heat and fan. The fan is also right at the rim of the grill, so there's not much smoke coming out of the grill itself like how they do it at Breakers. Overall, very impressed!\\n\\nThe food quality is where things took a hit. The sushis are somewhat mediocre. There are some nigiri that were decent, but most of the rolls were too saucy or dry. They're also unlabeled, so it's hard to know sometimes what they are. Some of the meats were pretty good such as filet mignon. But most of the meats are unseasoned and not marinated. When we seasoned it ourselves (there are salt and pepper on table), it was much better. There's a lot of variety of sushi and meat though. \\n\\nOverall, there are lots of kbbq and sushi buffets that are better than here. However, none of them offer it together, especially with this much efficiency. If I were to rate the sushi and bbq part separately, I'd give them 3 stars, but with the special pricing and how they're just starting out, I've given them 4.

I drove for almost an hour to go pick it up a week later when it was supposed to be ready, and they had no idea what I was talking about when I gave them our name. They also didn't seem too concerned with the fact that someone actually told us that it would be ready, with the words we requested written on it. It was as if that was not something they did, but we were told on the phone that it was. Then they kept asking me what it was supposed to say, and I took that to mean they were looking for it, and wanted to know what it said for reference purposes. So I tried to remember what my wife wanted it to say and rattled off a very vague and general description and waited some more. Turns out, it wasn't for reference - it was so they could go write it really fast on another cake. At that point I just wanted to get the heck out of there because it was my birthday and this wasn't looking up at all, so I just paid for the stupid thing, thanked them, and left. I opened the door to leave just as someone else was walking in, so I proceeded to walk to my car to open the trunk, placed the cake in there and hopped into the drivers seat. I checked my messages on my phone, but while I was looking down, I noticed a woman outside the front door shouting at my car, apparently. I hadn't been paying attention to anything outside my car prior to that because as far as I knew there wasn't a reason to, and I was on my phone. But as I looked up at her, she turned around to walk inside and slammed the door so hard I thought all the front windows were going to shatter. It appeared as though she was shouting at me, or my car,  but I couldn't possibly imagine why. I wasn't rude, I didn't refuse to pay, I gave no indication of any kind that I was even as angry about it as I truly was, so I cannot explain this behavior, or even really validate that it was directed towards me to be honest. But I certainly won't be returning anytime soon. Or .. ever. They really couldn't have cared less about the cake we ordered, even after the huge wedding order we placed just a few months before. A simple apology would've gone a long way, but pretending like they didn't do anything wrong and acting like I was expecting a service they didn't offer was incredibly unprofessional, and annoying. Things like that make me feel like I'm in the twilight zone or something. It was a very juvenile interaction for a business. Maybe it was just the staff that day, but what else do I have to go on? I don't plan on getting married again and I only have one birthday a year. \\n\\nUpdate after owner reply: \\n\\nUnfortunately I think you're referring to a different customer's experience. Not only does this sound nothing like what happened to me, but there weren't any flowers on my cake and the box wasn't propped open when I got it. There was nothing but writing. Also I'm sorry, but I would never expect someone to come outside to angrily shout at me, and then slam the door as hard as they could after my cake was already in the trunk and I was seated inside a closed vehicle if they were trying to pleasantly advise me to keep a box propped open that wasn't propped open to begin with."},{"name":"Desta Ethiopian Kitchen","address":"3086 Briarcliff Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4.5","text":"I met up with a group of 8 here and service probably suffered a bit because of that, however the food did not.

That's the only way I would describe it. Respectable, gourmet burgers and parmesan truffle fries. \\n\\nI like how the restaurant makes sure that everything is complete when they serve it out. What I mean by that is the parmesan truffles fries are entirely coated with parmesan cheese and garlic while the burger is fully built out with flavor. I hate places that throw out fries with parmesan and garlic topping as an afterthought when it's supposed to be a complete thought. Same thing when a place makes burgers. Make sure the burger's toppings work together in unison to deliver an impactful statement. Hopdoddy does it right. Thanks, daddy! I mean thanks, doddy!

Once you open the glass doors, walk all the way towards the kitchen and grab a menu. You walk up to the cash register to order and grab a number.\\n\\n# Look over the menu and select the burger that begs you to eat it. Order the parmesan truffle fries. Hopdoddy does the parmesan fries right unlike so many restaurants that lazily execute it\\n\\n# Once you grab a table, a server will make his appearance to check up on you and to ask if you need anything else. You don't order again at the register. You can order more stuff and beer with the server at your table."},{"name":"Maenam","address":"1938 W 4th Avenue","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"With so many wonderful accolades on Maenam, this seemed to be the perfect restaurant to try that wasn't west coast farm to table.  They're on Vancouver's best restaurant list and even in Canada's Top 100 restaurants.  Like I said... well regarded for it's flavours and service.  In Toronto we have our own regarded fine dining Thai restaurant but it hasn't seen the same awards or nods as here.  In comparison, I'm a bit of a loss at what happened to the Thai flavours in our dishes.\\n\\nMaenam is right beside my other 2 fantastic discoveries in Kitsilano... Fable and Rain or Shine ice cream.  It's a nice spot ... modern warmth but leaning towards the minimalist.  The golden hues of the many wood panels help keep the noise level down.   It's needed a bit as we could clearly hear the tables beside us and their family debates.  \\n\\nService here is efficient and quick but we were missing any of the warmth or active interest that we experienced in Fable or Nightingale.  It just seemed... a bit functional and that's it.  There's nothing wrong with it but I would hope service be a bit more welcoming for a restaurant of this calibre.\\n\\nThe menu reads really well with a lot of variety of vegetarian, seafood, and meat dishes.  A lot of interesting dishes that go beyond the mundane pad thai and khao soi.  With a bit of help from the staff, we were able to pick 3 dishes to start and see where it takes us.  I'm honestly glad we did this cause we were struck on how small these plates were for the price point ... especially compared to the amazing dinner at Fable a few days before.\\n\\nBrussel Sprout Salad - This was a nice side to have ... sprouts cut thick and then fried up crisp.  There is an Asian-esque sauce that is savoury and leaning towards a darker soy flavour.  But one thing that I noticed quickly... good but not Thai.  It was missing the sour bright citrus or the pungent fermented notes of fish sauce. Yes there was an underlying sweet note but then it just resembled a sweet soy sauce which could be Japanese or Indonesian.  3.5/5\\n\\n8 Spice ling cod - This was a main but what arrived was more of a shared plate portion.  Smaller definitely but not minuscule.  I believe whoever is cooking is executing well as this one had tender soft cod encrusted in a hot crunchy crust that wasn't too thick.  That was well done but the sauce is where it faltered.  Yes it was a nice garlicky thick glaze that had a sweet undertone to it but ... once again, it was missing the Thai flavours. \\n No acidity, bitterness, or pungent flavours... just soy, garlic, and sugar.  And the sauce was quite syrupy sticky... it ruined the crispy crust quite quickly.  3.5/5\\n \\nStir fry of beef rib & holy basil - Tender beef rib was easy to tear into with just a fork.  This dish had a bit more variety of vegetables thrown into it and giving it more visual appeal.  I liked this one a bit more as it didnt have a stick glaze that just made every bit too sticky.  The only big issue again is flavour.  It's not bad but it's just generic Asian.  It's missing the Thai undertones ... no sour, sweet, or pungent.  Just soya sauce with a hint of herbs.  3.5/5\\n\\nI would say that the overall execution and cooking of the dishes were good... nothing was wrong there but the flavours were not Thai.  Perhaps this is modified to suit a more North American palate but I was hoping more of the boldness and sharp balanced tastes that I've come to appreciate in the cuisine.  Comparing this dinner to a few doors down at Fable, this one was more expensive for considerably less good food and flavours weren't a stand out.

It's not completely out of budget but at the end of the day you have to acknowledge that you are paying 10 dollars for a waffle sandwhich, but to give them credit, 24 diner has very similar pricing. I ordered the mother clucker and the waffle fries. I wanted a plain chicken and waffles without all the extra toppings but it was 12.75. So you can't get the plainer option for cheaper... There is also an option to tip which is funny considering you order off ipads. \\n\\nThe food came out at a okay pace and the presentation was very nice. I did note that the chicken itself was very tender but the breading was very peppery for me, the breading was also falling off. The waffle was decent, a little too sweet, and the sriracha mayo made it even sweeter of a combo. The waffle fries were very tasty and fried nicely, they tasted just like the kind you get at pluckers.

Aside from the stupid conversations you'll wind up eavesdropping on, this place IS pretty cool. \\n\\nSo, the hipsters migrate downstairs into the smoking section or out to the porch, leaving the main room surprisingly empty and quiet.

No. It's provided by Personal Telco, which is a weird provider if you're trying to connect with something besides a laptop (*cough* Nintendo DS! *cough*) because it requires you to confirm your connection through a browser window.\\n\\nIf you're vegan, you're in heaven here!

Overall, it was positive. My second was a few weeks ago at their new location. It did not go all that well. If I didn't already know they have the same owner, I would say Barley Swine is a cheap knock off of Odd Duck. I adore Odd Duck, deeply. When I'm there I feel home, and everyone there is a big reason why. At Barley Swine, I felt like a one night visitor at an overpriced motel never to return, and everyone there was a big reason why.\\n\\nThe impeccable service I recall from the 1st visit was nowhere to be found. Gone was the feeling that the staff truly cared and wanted you to enjoy your dining experience. Our server was kind of nice, but it felt fake. Many of the staff did not look happy to be there. The food runners seemed like they were just reciting lines when explaining dishes rather than having any real interest or excitement. It took 30 minutes between our last two dishes and no one said a thing or checked in on us even once. It's possible it was an off night, but I've never experienced such lackadaisical and oblivious service at Odd Duck.\\n\\nAs for the food, it was strongly suggested to me by a Barley expert that I go the tasting menu route over their a la carte option. I failed to heed his advice. Perhaps the service and food would have been better, but I would think the service should be on the same level regardless. This is what we had:\\n\\nWagyu Rib Steak - First, this is not a steak, it was a portion of a steak. To say it's a steak is misleading. The meat itself was good albeit with some bites being over salted. We did not like the baked beans that accompanied it.\\n\\nSmoked duck - This was pretty good and had a comforting flavor to it.\\n\\nPig skin noodles - I'm a fan of chicharrones, ordering this was a no brainer and I liked the concept. Unfortunately, it had very little depth. It was pretty much just hot sauce with pork skin and I've had much more flavorful pork skin and hot sauce elsewhere. It also came with shrimp dumplings that tasted on the same level as ones you can buy from the frozen aisle of your grocery store.\\n\\nShiitake pasta - This dish was really good and was our favorite despite the tiny portion. The charred vegetables added a nice smoky flavor that balanced well with the acidity of the sauce that was housed within the delicate pillow-y pasta.\\n\\nCarrots, peanut, ranch, herbs, avocado - This was Odd Duck-esque, but not quite there. Over salted and quite petite.\\n\\nThe presentation of the dishes was excellent yet I have little to no interest in eating pretty looking food if it isn't actually tasty. We ended up going somewhere else for dessert.\\n\\nAs for the atmosphere/design, it's similar to Odd Duck, but not as self-assured. It's not bad, it's just that the original Barley had its own identity; its own charm, its own character, and it was cozier. I also liked the surrounding South Lamar feel better. Things keep popping up on Burnet, but this stretch of it feels like a wasteland currently and I'm also not a fan of any of their strip mall neighbors: Bufalina Due or Lick.\\n\\nI got Odd Duck from the moment I walked in the door. Me and Barley just aren't there and may never be. I'm ok with that.\\n\\nP.S. If you're going to make a reservation, be aware that if you need to cancel and you don't cancel 24 hours prior to your reservation you will be charged $25 (for a la carte) to a maximum of $85/person (for tasting menu). Perhaps this is a new trend some restaurants are doing (Odd Duck doesn't do it), but I haven't come across it elsewhere outside of Nick Kokonas's Tock ticketing system."},{"name":"Schmidt's Sausage Haus","address":"240 E Kossuth St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"Another top spot for my Columbus, Oh trip.

Not too large with open windows and an open bar. It looked like the rooftop did not have shade for coverage. For the lunch menu, we ordered crab cakes and grilled octopus as appetizers. The crab cake was a good size and sauce for one. The grilled octopus was my first time eating octopus and they did not disappoint. The crisp and flavor. For our entrees, we had the mahi mahi fish tacos that were two large with a lot of sauce and French fries. The second entree was the option of hot or cold lobster roll on a toasted hotdog bun. Relatively small and you get more butter flavor than lobster and that came with fries. Last dish was the steak tips which were cooked very well with cilantro rice and asparagus.

The place was hard to get to especially with certain gps' bc the address listed will place you 6 miles south of the restaurant.  if you put in 82 e. berkeley st - that should put you right around the corner of it. \\n\\nonce we actually found the location, the person in charge there gave us some scallion pancakes on the house, so that was very nice of him.  however, my MIL can do a better job in making those.  The texture is not dough-like but more crunchy-oily - wasn't feeling it. \\n\\nalso the decor at the place was very cheesy IMO with the empty tea cans holding the chopsticks and silverware and chinese newspapers as placemats.  honestly, looking around, we were the only Asians there so that should've alerted us more.  \\n\\nHubby ordered the sweet and sour soup and it was pretty tasty, not as thick as you would find in chinese restaurants, which I like better.  I ordered the Thai pork lettuce wraps.  It was more Vietnamese style with thick pork meatballs versus being in chunky pieces and the dipping sauce wasn't even peanut flavored.  It was more of the vietnamese \\"ngouc mam\\" fish-style sauce.  \\n\\nwe got our check pretty quickly and went to chinatown less than a mile away to order double lobster dish for $15.  if you really want good chinese food and not pretentious asian fusion, save your money and head over to chinatown. \\n\\nthe service was great and i hate to leave an unsatisfied review, but this place did not do it for us."},{"name":"Weather Up","address":"1808 E Cesar Chavez St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"For a long time now Weather Up has been my absolute favorite bar to go to. It's a great place to bring a date. It's a great place to throw a party. Hell, it's a great place to play Cards Against Humanity.\\n\\nYou walk in and you are transported to a New York bar, which makes sense as the first two Weather Ups are in NYC. But this Weather Up still maintains an Austin feel. It's chill. You can walk in wearing swim trunks and a tank top, or wearing your favorite vest and necktie.\\n\\nThe first time I went to Weather Up I was greeted with the same great service as I was last weekend. I went up to the bartender, Carolyn, and she made me (what would become) my favorite drink I have ever had, the Noche Buena. It's not on the menu, but that's how this place rolls. You tell them what you like, and they (being the masters of their craft) will make you something they think you will like. And if you don't like it, just let them know and they will fix it.\\n\\nEvery time I go to Weather Up I don't even look at the drink menu anymore. I just ask one of the bartenders there to make me something with whiskey (no citrus) and they always put something amazing (and new) in front of me. You can't beat that.\\n\\nAnd the food! Kristine Kittrell is the head chef, and Weather Up would be hard-pressed to get anyone better for their kitchen. The food is on point, and the menu changes often. There are times when I am sad to see a favorite item of mine no longer on the menu, but then I find three new things that I can't live without.\\n\\nAll of this said, I wouldn't recommend bringing in a big group on a Friday or Saturday night. But that should be obvious! It's a CRAFT COCKTAIL bar! The point is that you are getting a cocktail that takes time to make. If you pack the place up on a busy night, then it will be a while before they get to you. If you want to bring a big group in, do it on a Thursday or a Sunday.\\n\\nAlso, I will reiterate one more time that I have always had great service at Weather Up. Lately I'm always skeptical of people that say they received bad service at a craft cocktail bar. There is a trend in Austin to go out to places like this and act snobby and entitled, and that's coming from someone who grew up in Austin. And people should keep in mind that you get what you give. I'm not saying that this is the case with any of the other reviewers, but I've seen it happen several times.

Which might seem like a brash way of comparing two places, as they are night and day. The waitstaff seem very pretentious, and the prices; mind you. For a small diner in the same parking lot of a gas station, in the less than glamorous part of town, don't meet the price point for the quality of service. I just don't get it. I was seeing stellar reviews from those opinions I trust, and I guess I am out of the loop. \\n\\n\\nThe scotch egg redux was tasty. Everything else was lack luster. The fried///grilled chicken be mindful is (brined//brine) before it is fried. So it looks pink. Is what the manager explained to us. It being dark meat. This is how it looks. I know that you can eat chicken so long as it meets the safe internal temperature of 165¬∞ Fahrenheit. \\n\\nThe way it was explained was very halfhearted and seemed like she had explained this a few times before, since she started it off with \\"We get this all. the. time\\" And the body posture she was conveying left much to be desired, and seemed like we were the ones who were in the wrong for being concerned that the chicken was literally pink. I want to like this place, I really do,  But with how aloof and uncaring the people who work here seem, if you are not what it looks like is a regular. I would honestly skip this place, and choose somewhere else to brunch, it tries too hard to be trendy, and gets lost in being too snobby.

It's against my better moral judgment and against my ethics as a social scientist (ha!).\\n\\nThe waffles at Flavour Spot are relatively basic--not super crispy and they taste like normal waffles. I also felt that the menu of fillings was quite basic, too. I was totally satisfied with the sausage and maple waffle, which should be a breakfast staple, but while I was chowing down, I couldn't help but fantasize about the bacon, basil, and brie waffles over on Hawthorne.

My chicken had great taste and I could tell fresh micro-herbs were used in the garnishing but it was cold!! I was seriously taken aback at that as was expecting this food item to be warm!

The attitude of some staff is better than the attitude of other staff, and some staff are more knowledgable about the products than the other staff.  That means their service is really inconsistent, and this is not acceptable if they are trying to be an upscale bakery.  The staff definitely need training on the product knowledge and on the service, and the manager obviously did not train his staff well.  The manager might not care about the service because he might believe that their products and their company's name are enough to attract customers.  If he instills this kind of proud or arrogant attitude to his staff that they don't need to thank customers, then no wonder the staff are providing inadequate services.\\n\\nFrom the desserts that I'd tried, my observation and my interaction with the staff,  I believed all the stories that I'd heard about this place.

I've not even before now gotten a taste, even though I have had a couple Ethiopian co-workers before. Even though I'd never had it, my anthropologist major curiosity had me at least familiarizing myself with Ethiopian food a little bit (including the, *horrors* to some people, eating with one's hands).\\n\\nSo, one of my friends wanted to get a couple of us together to go out here.\\n\\nIt's funny when I'd looked up where this place was how many times I've apparently driven by it and not known it was there (I suppose because even though it's on Briarcliff near Clairmont, the actual intersection has a Popeye's that kind of hides it). Still, not seeing a two-story building is a little funny, though my anal retentive driving habits don't really have me looking at most anything but the road, speed limit signs, and what other vehicles as doing (back home, there were plenty of \\"Did you see me? I was waving at you when you were driving.\\" with me saying, \\"No, I was driving.\\" conversations).\\n\\nIt was about 8:15pm when I got there, and getting past the Popeye's I took a chance that the restaurant with only \\"Ethiopian\\" lit up on its fa√ßade at about where the map pin said it should be was Desta (when I actually got in the plaza and slowed down to plaza speed, it's then when I saw the unlit \\"Desta\\" above it and \\"Kitchen\\" below). Until I saw that I was still hesitant because the map when I'd looked up the place also said there were at least two other Ethiopian restaurants in the same plaza.\\n\\nI was the first one there, so while I was waiting for my friends to say they'd arrived, I peeped around. I noticed they have a drive-up window, and I saw people go in and out of the neighboring post office. There were a few young loitering guys who gave me pause a little (like, stop hovering around my car, dudes). I'd noticed as well a catering trailer with social media emblems all over its backside. Finally, they said they were inside by the host stand, and so in I went (note: the drive-up window is on the complete opposite side of the main entrance).\\n\\nI saw one of our party of three and said hello, seeing my other friend chatting it up with one of the staff. When he was done and came to join us, my first question to him was about the wait time, because I did see various strong advisories/counsels to making advance reservations and I was hungry. He'd said about 10-15 minutes. It turns out he had, until about two years ago, frequented Desta pretty much weekly, and that the staff person with whom he was talking actually recognized him even though it had been a while. Meanwhile the host, an older man clinging to his reservations/customer queue iPad and seeming kind of bored as he spoke, said a table had opened upstairs and we could sit there if we wanted.\\n\\nNo: my friend wanted to sit at his staff friend's downstairs table as he'd requested. Soon, we were there. The room was fairly cozy, and it seemed smaller than the building's size from outside seemed to indicate. She introduced herself: Natsanet. As she said her name, I noticed it embroidered on her button-down, green Desta uniform shirt (different than most everyone else, who wore fuchsia/lavender Desta uniform t-shirts) along with \\"Team Lead\\". She quickly spouted off to my seasoned Desta customer friend what was probably a standing order, and he modified it slightly to \\"very brave\\" kitfo for he and our other friend, and then assorted tibs with extra injera. I decided on the vegetable platter, which is pretty much a sampling of mostly everything they offer on the \\"vegan\\" section of their menu.\\n\\nMy other virgin-to-Ethiopian-Food friend described the kitfo when he'd gotten it as \\"lasagna in sushi form\\". They quickly devoured it. As they were eating my vegetable platter arrived. It was pretty to look at, though it came with not quite enough injera initially to take care of everything on the plate. I pretty much used my index finger to food to mouth for a good bit of the remainder until my seasoned friend offered me another roll.\\n\\nOverall, we enjoyed our meals, feeling absolutely full (probably in good measure due to the injera itself). My favorite out of the ten different offerings on the plate was probably -- no surprise -- the shiro. It took a little bit for Natsanet to come collect our cards for payment (and even my friend started to have a face, like, \\"We're kind of ready for you to come get this.\\"), but we settled up finally and bid farewell.\\n\\nI suppose this was a safe way to introduce one to Ethiopian food gently, especially since they've been around long enough. I'm glad I went, and that we were in the care of someone who knows her stuff.\\n\\nFan."},{"name":"Sweet Tomatoes","address":"474 W State Road 436","city":"Altamonte Springs","stars":"3.5","text":"Much cleaner than the other Sweet Tomatoes that I've been to.

We just wanted to enjoy a meal under the stars so my girlfriend pulls out her iPhone & taps the Yelp! app to find a nearby place.  1st place to pop up that met this criteria was this establishment. We almost drove place the place but was able to find a parking spot right out front.  I noticed a tall man stand out front with kitchen clogs on.  As we got close to the door the man ran to open the door & warmly welcome us in.  It was quite quiet for a Tuesday night but that did not deter us from making a beeline to the small outdoor patio. We got there right as the sun kissed the horizon & the clouds had hints of pinkish blues.  Besides the hues of the sunset there were quite a good number of handsome boats waiting for the summer to come. Your ears could hear the lapping of the waves right on the other side of the dry docked boats.\\nThe enthusiastic man in the clogs happen to also be the owner, Said.  He brought us menus & asked us if we felt more Italian than pub grub. We were hungry & open to anything.  So he informed us he also owned Alia Restorante located right next door & grabbed us more menus in a blink of an eye. Said was so happy & honestly proud of his establishments so he sat down to tell us about his cultural & cooking background. Which was fascinating to hear. In between tales he also informed us of the specials. He really wanted to fulfill our culinary desires & was willing to modify anything we ordered. The frutti di mare special caught my ear & then he recommended to lay it all on a bed of rice to soak up the seafood juices.  Plus he found out I was Thai & we like our heat so he was going to turn up the dial a bit.  Before our meal a hot chili soaked in olive oil came out with some hot rolls, which by the way was sent back by Said because he felt they were not hot enough. A perfect starter to the swiftly served main course that came out in in a gorgeous traditional blue Moroccan tagine which had a lid that also served as receptacle for the shells.\\nNow lets talk about this dish. I have had it in many places, many times & many ways but I can honestly say this was one of the best examples I have every had. The generous amount of mussels, clams, octopus & shrimp all danced together with an assortment of spices & rice.  The heat was perfect, not too hot that it masked all other flavors & not weak to the point that black pepper would be spicier.  I am drooling just writing this review. Every several moments Said would come check in & open himself us to us about his thoughts on life, food & whatever else came to mind.  I could taste that he put his heart & soul in his food, that is something quite special & normally only reserved for the kitchens of people's homes. \\nNow this is only the tip of what these establishments had to offer.  Hookah, live music, belly dancing were options down the road.  These hidden gems are the true reason why services like Yelp! are great. We expected just a meal but instead we got an experience.

Our waiter was Tony, who was awesome! He acknowledged this was our first visit. He explained every page of the menu  with his personal recommendations. He checked on us a good amount of times and refilled our water frequently( this seems like a tiny thing but other restaurant couldn't keep it consistent ). The food was delicious, we ordered one appetizer and two entrees, definitely too much food, I even didn't finish half of my bento box. The long horn slider was very delicious, the beef patty was fresh cooked and served with bacon, fried onion in a king's Hawaiian bun, palatable! Definitely should try one of their specialties, either burguishi or sushi sandwich, it is a kind of Asian fusion that blowed my mind at least. Their bathroom has some interesting decor with some weird background commentary playing.

My friend mentioned the delicious Buffalo Chicken Dip at this restaurant and my interested was piqued. \\n\\nAt noon on Sunday, the restaurant was still pretty empty. I noticed the large bar area and wooden details. It was very clean, with neat and tidy seating. For a restaurant/bar next to a ball park, this place looked quite nice and not rundown like some places in that same location might. \\n\\nWe ordered the appetizer combo platter, which was perfect! At most restaurants, a regular dish that's featured on a sample platter is scaled down and served in much smaller portions. We mostly ordered the platter for the buffalo chicken dip and were surprised to see the massive portion presented to us. The dip was accompanied by loads of fresh pita chips and fried wontons. The dip was the kind of stuff you want to eat when watching a game or hanging out with friend. So bad, but so good. And not too spicy! (I'm a wimp when it comes to heat). Included on the platter was 3 pulled pork sliders topped with fresh coleslaw. The buns were great- no one wants a lame, doughy bun. I would liken it to challah bread or brioche? We also were treated to Philly cheese steak spring rolls. Basically, all the delicious components of a cheese steak wrapped in a wonton and fried. Umm...delicious!!\\n\\nThe portion was so generous, and we took the remaining chicken dip home. The service was so-so, but we let it slide considering the day before the whole city was probably crawling up and down Yawkee celebrating, no doubt packing the bar.

Sacred medicines that Native American people have used for thousands of years should not EVER be sold, much less for $60. I was utterly appalled that these items are being sold and marketed the way that they are. I hope the owners can take some time for self-reflection and understand why selling these products is inappropriate and disrespectful to First Nations people. Items such as white sage, cedar, sweet grass and palo santo should be gathered by individuals that understand the medicine and should never be sold.

The first red flag was that nobody called me to confirm my reservation. For a restaurant that is over 100 years old, I expected that they'd follow the standard protocol to confirm. I called Amrheins the evening before, and the hostess assured me that the table will fit all 12 of us. She even asked if there were any elderly guests in my party (we had none), which I thought was considerate.\\n\\nWhen we arrived, they brought us to a round high-top booth table that could probably fit only 6 people comfortably. This was poorly planned on their part, and the staff could not offer anything besides bring out a few extra chairs, but to no avail. We were squished like sardines, along with all of our coats and purses. Mind you, we are pretty average-sized people. I had zero elbow room and felt like a T-Rex struggling to use its arms. Because it was a booth table and not individual chairs, we had to coordinate getting our food from the buffet at the same time. If someone sitting in the middle had to use the restroom, all of us would have to get up and let that person free. It was honestly one of the most uncomfortable dining experiences.\\n\\nThe AYCE brunch buffet is on Sundays only, in Amrheins's bar room. $25 per person covers food, coffee/juice/tea, tax, and gratuity.\\n\\nHighlights: omelette station, carving station & desserts\\nFail: *cold* steak, mashed potatoes, yogurt (bowl not properly kept on ice)\\nMIA: waffles, French toast, chicken pot pies - I was actually looking forward to these specific items, which were listed on the web site.\\n\\nEverything else tasted mediocre.

Being a group of four, we were able to sample some delicious dishes, most of which come from their dinner menu. Of the starters, we got the chicken and mushroom coconut soup which was hearty, a little sour and piled full of chicken and mushroom chunks! The thai mussels were also plump and juicy without being salty but still very tasty. \\n\\nThe seared tuna salad was my favourite of the night since the tuna itself was raw in the middle but no hint of stringiness and melted in my mouth! The steak salad was okay as well but i must admit, the flavours for both were quite similar being heavy in sour, cilantro, onions and shallots making for tasty bites. \\n\\nThe two curries we tried were the green curry with beef which came with more meat than I would expect for a dine out menu and a thicker curry that wasn't too spicy but still packed a punch. Of the two, I enjoyed the tumeric curry with seafood because it had a great coconut flavour but also extremely aromatic and came with quite a few prawns, mussels and cod. \\n\\nThe 8 spice ling cod and chicken cashew were our choices for the stir fries and both were some of the best dishes of the night! The chicken cashew had lightly breaded and deep fried chicken chunks that were doused in a sweet-savoury sauce but was not over sauced or too oily! The 8 spice ling cod was crusted in a delicious caramelized breading that was again, not too thick, and was well cooked but the best was the sauce! It was sweet but had balance to it that brought out the flavours of the fish quite wonderfully! \\n\\nFinally, we got all three of the desserts including an extra order of the banana roti. The banana roti had bananas wrapped in malaysian roti and topped with some vanilla ice cream. The roti itself was a little bit too dense (not flaky) but it was had a great sweetness level and although I wasn't a fan of the texture of the condensed milk ice cream, the rest of my family loved the flavour compliment to the roti. The fresh young coconut sorbet was like biting into frozen coconut milk and perfect for coconut lovers but the best part were the tropical fruits (lychee, logan, jackfruit) that topped the sorbet. They gave a little burst of freshness with each bite of the heavier ice cream. Finally, the black sticky rice was my dad's favourite with a sticky rice base that was a little bit too loose (not glutinous enough) with some coconut syrup, fruits and tapioca. The textures in this little bowl were complex which i loved but i found the actual rice with syrup too sweet on its own.\\n\\nService was also great with ensuring that our meal was peanut free and the way the dishes were timed made for a great sharing meal! All but the starters came together and a huge bowl of rice accompanied the curries making a delicious thai meal. \\n\\nOverall, the DOV price is great for trying out a Vancouver-famed restaurant but the food, service and experience was all amazing."},{"name":"Cilantro and Jalape√±o","address":"131- 123 Carrie Cates Court","city":"North Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Did not eat a meal here but was pleasantly surprised by the variety of Mexican spices and treats!

But the place has another history, as well.\\n\\nThe North End is Boston's oldest residential neighborhood. Rich folk, hookers, the Irish, Eastern European Jews, and eventually, people from Italy top-to-bottom, have all taken a turn at occupying the blocks running from today's Central Artery to the waterfront.\\n\\nBy 1930, the neighborhood was entirely Italian. But, over time, the housing stock deteriorated, while the City pursued a plan to improve Boston's transportation infrastructure, no matter the affect on its citizens, and the majority of Italians left the North End for the suburbs. \\n\\nMore recent preservation and investment have revitalized the old neighborhood, but, notwithstanding local efforts to hold onto the North End's Italian heritage, there are fewer Italian families living there now than at any time in the past 100 years, they having been replaced by gentrifying, white-collar singles.\\n\\nToday's North End resembles an Italian-American theme park, where more Italian restaurants operate now than did so 90 years ago, and where the occasional feast or procession will draw as many as a quarter-million visitors to a neighborhood of 10,000 residents. \\n\\nBut the restaurants serve good food, and the festivals are promoted by local Italian-Americans, so there's a thread of authenticity running through this scaled-up, 21st-century iteration of the North End as an ethnic haven.\\n\\nOne wonders what the rising population of Millennial renters will offer the community, when responsibility for its care falls to them."},{"name":"Coast to Coast Fish House","address":"19206 SE 1st Street, Ste 102","city":"Vancouver","stars":"5","text":"I've been eying this place for a while.

Dimly lit restaurant with mirror walls, Glass dividers, white ceiling, a fresh fish display, and oysters sitting on ice. We started with some little neck clams and a variety of oysters based on Taylor's recommendation our server. The raw stuff is really fresh, some of the freshest I've had. Each oyster tasted unique, I especially liked the shigoku's from the west coast. But the high light to me was the clams!!!!! I couldn't stop we even had clams for desert haha. After the first set of clams the 2nd and 3rd servings the clams got much bigger for some reason, never seen little neck clams this big, but I wasn't complaining they were briny, plump, and super fresh all you smell is slight salt water(which is what you want, no fishiness) and same with the oysters super fresh. But being raw clams are much harder to find I enjoyed them so much more. For entree I had the Chilean sea bass in menuiere sauce, and my girl had the Parmesan crusted flounder with crab stuffing. My bass was cooked perfect super moist and melting in your mouth, same with my girls dish except hers was a lot more savory and heavy because of the crab but still amazing. There entree are simple yet complex flavors I was throughly impressed. Even the bread that raisin bread was the bomb!!! \\n   On to the service, our server Taylor was pretty good he was strait to the point and left us alone when needed.

It's raining, it's cold and I feel sick. Boyfriend comes in and prods me to get ready, we have to go to dinner with his friends. I cough weakly and contemplate telling him to go on without me while subtly hinting that he should pick me up something to eat while he's out. But I heroically fold myself into an upright position and resolve to go even if it kills me, which I see as a distinct possibility.  \\n\\nI find myself sitting at a table in Amriheins, thankfully far away from the propped open door letting in cold damp drafts from outside. I look at the menu and instantly feel a little better. Shepherd's Pie, Chicken Pot Pie, Pot Roast with mashed potatoes and roasted vegetables?! What is this, Grandma's house? Soft, easy to chew bland-ish but comforting foods... just what the doctor ordered. \\n\\nI got the pot roast and it was everything I hoped it would be. The meat pulled apart with ease, the mashed potatoes were soft and creamy and almost as good as sitting on the couch, and the roasted veggies were tender and plentiful. Huge portions, but that didn't stop me from mowing down the whole plate except for a few lost pieces of meat and veggies. It was damn good. \\n\\nHere's where things go wrong. My friend ordered the poutine, which I had severe misgivings about just from its description on the menu: horseradish and vermont cheddar?? What kind of place is this?! It arrived, and even though I knew it was from hell, I dutifully loaded my fork. Upon first chew I knew I was right. Tangy and sour from the combo of vermont cheddar blobs (which I love, don't get me wrong, just not on poutine) and runny horseradish sauce, the flavor of the gravy was completely drowned out, and the texture lacked the trademark chewiness of cheese curds, making it a soupy sour concoction that bore only the slightest resemblance to poutine. No gusta. \\n\\nPrices are on the high side at about $20 for most dinner entrees, but as I said the portions are generous so you could probably make two meals out of it. \\n\\n(I think I'll know when I'm truly a grownup because I'll stop writing things like \\"you could totally get three meals out of it if you ration properly.\\")"},{"name":"Cherrywood Coffeehouse","address":"1400 E 38th 1/2 St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"If there was a picture of a hipster coffee bar in the dictionary, Cherrywood Coffeehouse would be that picture.

The ambiance was great, and the place had some neat decorations that had my eyes darting all over the place! I had heard the sandwiches were specialty here, so a friend and I decided to split two. \\n\\nThe sandwiches are combinations thought up by local chefs in Boston, and the menu gives them and their restaurants credit. What a great concept! \\n\\nFirst up: The Benny* / $13.25\\nCreated by: Ken Oringer, Chef/Owner - Clio, Boston\\nVietnamese-style, spicy grilled chicken breast on a baguette with assorted julienned vegetables and mint coriander mayonnaise. Sided with spicy purple cabbage slaw tossed with diced tomatoes, fresh mint, Thai basil, and cracked peanuts.\\n\\nThis was reminiscent of a Bahn Mi sandwich. It was delicious and the spicy cabbage slaw was awesome. So many textures here, kept every bite exciting. Only thing it needed was some spice, perhaps some sriracha!\\n\\nSecond up:*The Rialto / $13.50\\n Created by: Jody Adams, Chef/Owner - Rialto, Cambridge\\nThinly sliced prosciutto, buffalo mozzarella, and basil pesto on garlic and olive oil rubbed Texas toast. Served with a mixed green and sundried tomato salad with a pine nut dressing.\\n\\nHow can you go wrong with this sandwich? While I didn't notice it on the menu at first, the bread is texas toast.. which is SUCH A GREAT CHOICE. Usually these sammys are made on ciabatta, which I never really loved.. you know what happens.. the bread doesn't rip right and you never get the right bite. Not with texas toast. The salad was just okay.. too much dressing.. it was delicious.. but basically just a really wet salad. \\n\\nService was fast and friendly.

With a full open bar, a small kitchen and a few TVs, this place packs 'em in at a time when many bowling alleys appear to be on the wane.  \\n\\nWhile we bowled, we sampled the recommended French Fries with the Pig's own unique spicy mayo dip along with a couple of cold bottles of brew.

So here we go for first impressions: \\n\\nLocated right near Park T-stop down a dirty side alley this treasure is a Boston experience all on it's own. JFK loved eating here, and Bill Clinton and Hilary followed in his footsteps during the DNC.\\n\\nThere weren't many people inside--a 60 year old man with one of the worst fake tan sunburns I've seen. White around the eyes and lobster red with an ugly little wife stuffing herself with lobster, the rest of the place was filled with stout men at large oak circular tables with button-ups and a sort of smug half smiles--red faced and bloated. \\n\\nThe bar surrounding it was entirely made out of oak, very old Harvard-Boys-Club-Esque with big round tables and huge platters with those silver plated tops on them. This was very cool. \\n\\nAt first, I was put off because as we entered it was painfully quiet and conservative inside. My boyfriend pointed out that it felt like we had just walked into someone else's house by mistake. They placed us at a table where we were sitting away from most everyone else in the restaurant. Despite the atmosphere which, at first, was a culture shock---the food was a horse of a different color.\\n\\nTHE FOOD. WAS. AMAZING.\\n\\nI ordered JFK's Lobster Stew---fantastic--big, plump chunks of buttery, fresh lobster in a thin, tasty broth. Amazing.  I would go back just to have that soup.\\n\\nI also got the Lobster Savannah--a giant stuffed lobster overflowing with delicious stuffing and piping hot and also got Escargot for an appetizer--everything was extremely, mouthwateringly good. \\n\\nMy dad seemed pleased with the place and said he liked it because it was \\"Different\\" and \\"very Boston.\\"\\n\\nI recommend eating at Locke Ober at least once during your stay in Boston and splurge because out of all the places I've dined at here in Boston this restaurant was probably the closest to what I pictured when I first thought of Boston.\\n\\nHowever, when my father asked the waiter to tell him a little about the history of the restaurant he told him that he would go get him a write-up---and came back with 4-5 pages of reading material on printer paper. We felt this broke the grand antique illusion just a bit and may just be evidence of a weak server.\\n\\nI have the feeling that Locke Ober may be way past its true glory days but this place has some of the best high-end food I've had in Boston and depsite the strange atmosphere, it's a total recommendation for a somewhat conservative dinner. I also gave this three stars because the food is PHENOMENAL but the atmosphere was really strange. I had an excellent dinner but I took off two stars because despite my instincts to give it five--I don't think it could be as GOOD as it could be--but do try it at least once--it's well worth it."},{"name":"Din Ho Chinese BBQ","address":"8557 Research Blvd, Ste 116","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Quite possibly the best Chinese food in Austin.

The chef's selections of tacos, sides, and tamales are the same each time, but you can request which you want and don't want.  The tacos are a mix from both the $2.50 and $3.50 range.\\n6. It's valet parking ONLY unless you want to park it yourself on 3rd St NW (which is where they park in the Dialysis Clinic lot when that closes for the day).  It gets pretty tight back there because of the other businesses that operate on 3rd St, so valet might not be a bad choice.\\n7. Do not get smart and try and park in the Gear Revival or 935M parking lots/garage.  You will get booted, and you will be unhappy.\\n8. The bar selection is good.\\n9. $10 weekday lunch menu is alright.\\n10. Chips and salsa are not free, and the chips are whole, deep fried tortillas (the small ones).\\n11.  Your food is served on little tin trays because #1.\\n\\nThe pork belly, spicy chorizo, wild boar, and sesame ribeye tacos are a must have.  The baja fish, veracruz fish, and chicken (more like a curry) tacos are less than ideal.  The salsa verde that comes with the chips has a little bit of a kick.  The rice bowls are served with green, red, and yellow peppers on top which are cold compared to the hot rice and meat, the grilled corn has a lot of cotija cheese on it (for better or for worse), the chipotle slaw is more wet than creamy (again, for better or for worse), and the stewed beans with pork is delicious.  Rotisserie chicken ain't half bad either.\\n\\nTL;DR, valet parking is good, tapas style, non-chicken and non-fish tacos are good, bar is good, and atmosphere is lively and different."},{"name":"Barley Swine","address":"6555 Burnet Rd, Ste 400","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"A local friend and yelper recommended this place to take out of town peeps.

I actually dislike most of the dimsum that is offered in the chinatown restaurants (greasy, bland, and some things just dont taste like they should. . .cardboard anyone?) But in Myers+Chang, they don't do dimsum that way; they stick to the small sizes, delicious little portions of noodles, chicken, tofu, beans, whatever they have is good. PLUS, its a fusion of flavors, so there is a lot of taste and variety in each dish.

The chicken itself was tender and juicy without being overly greasy, and it was plenty spicy and flavorful on its own -- we didn't end up needing the sauces at all.  The pieces themselves were smaller than average when compared to other fried chicken places we've been to, but they were plenty big for lunch.\\n\\nOur thoughts on the sides:\\n- Baked beans: Sweet and tangy with a good texture and consistency.  5/5.\\n- Collard greens: Well cooked and spiced with no grittiness. 4.5/5.\\n- Slaw: Pretty finely chopped, on the thin side but not runny.  4/5.\\n- Mac and cheese: Tasty and went well with the Crystal hot sauce, but the cheese was too runny and not thick enough for our tastes.  3/5.\\n\\nThe service was OK if not the most friendly (perhaps due to the lunch rush), and the price was reasonable for what we got.

The pizza is great, prices are reasonable and I love that it's family owned! They are very involved in the community and I think that's awesome!\\n\\nUnfortunately, the service is really hit or miss. There have been a few times that I've ordered a pizza online, \\"well done,\\" which is an option on their online ordering system, but received the pizza not how I wanted it. One time I asked them to bake it again and the woman at the counter scoffed at me and rolled her eyes. Another time, I opened the box in front of them and they told me I needed to move to the side so they could help others. It just felt really dismissive and not customer-centered. \\n\\nBut, there have been other times that service was phenomenal! \\nWhen opting for delivery, I've never been dissatisfied with the driver! They're really friendly and appreciative of my business! I always tip the drivers well because they are so awesome! Additionally, one time when I picked up my order, the manager was there and decided to fulfill my request for ranch dressing with my pizza at no extra cost! It's really the small things that I appreciate! \\n\\nSo service-wise, they can be really great and other times can sort of leave a bad taste. \\n\\nTonight was one of those \\"bad taste\\" nights. I had some friends over who wanted to get some pizza. Of course, I suggested DHOP since it's so close and usually pretty good. We wanted to add our own toppings at home and I remembered seeing an option on their website where you could opt for \\"No Make\\" meaning they wouldn't bake it and you could take it home. So, I had my friend call over to DHOP to ask if we could order two pizzas and not have them bake it, just carry it out unbaked. The person on the phone scoffed at my friend, told her that this request isn't possible. My friend then told the person on the phone that it's an option on the website and that it's been done before. The employee proceeded to argue with my friend then hang up. I'm disheartened to say the least. My friend looked at me in shock and said she felt stupid for asking. No one should feel stupid when requesting services from a service-oriented business.  Either this employee doesn't know that the website allows this option (and that we've done it before) or they didn't want to help us with this request. Either way, we decided to go pick up frozen pizzas from Stop and Shop instead. \\n\\nI really hope the service here improves"},{"name":"The COOP: A Southern Affair","address":"610 W Morse Blvd","city":"Winter Park","stars":"3.5","text":"I have eaten at the COOP several times now and can tell you it is absolutely one of my favorite places to eat around the Orlando area.

We were then greeted by the nice bartender who explained the menus , since we have never been there, and offered us a drink immediately. There was tons of choices for oysters, so she explained them ALL to us which was amazing. We took her advice and tried some from the east coast and some from the west. She was so friendly and we hope we see her again. \\n\\nThe Food: Out of this world! The island creek oysters from Duxbury were the best that we tasted! The others were good as well, but the island creek were the best ! We also had steamed little necks, and for dinner lobster risotto and friend clams. Both amazing. The fried clams melted in our mouths, with no sand whatsoever. The lobster risotto was a special , that had a huge lobster tail and claw on top. \\n\\nWe will definitely return soon, and even better the owner was there shucking oysters the whole time we were there.

She took our drink order but for some reason gave us an attitude and rolled her eyes at us, TWICE which was just rude since we ordered a quick drink order.  After waiting a little bit another waitress came over to our table and asked if we were ready to place our orders and we told her no not yet we are only ordering appetizers and she informed us that they are closing the kitchen in 10 minutes so no dinner entrees which we understood the first time around.  After receiving our drinks we ordered our appetizers which was calamari, fried cheese, salata, greek meatballs.

After the food arriving at our table we asked the person who delivered our food if we could have 2 more plates and 2 more silverware sets and we were only given 1 silverware set and nothing else so we had to ask AGAIN which then we got 2 plates and then once we asked AGAIN we got the other silverware set.

The chicken and lamb pita sandwiches are about three tiny pieces of meat rolled up in a pita with a thin pickle slice and a huge slathering of garlic, pressed, and flattened to heat. It's so small and the garlic is so overwhelming and spicy because there is so much of it that you cannot even taste the meat. It's very little food. No sides unless you make it a combo. We had the platter last time which is more food, but more expensive. We were trying to feed the family economically but we all walked away hungry and spent $40 with no drinks or sides. I'd suggest offering one side with the sandwich or put more in it and reduce the garlic."},{"name":"Piazza Italia","address":"1129 NW Johnson St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Why have I lived in Portland for 7 years and I've never been here!?

Newsflash, folks - this is Atlanta and it's 2012 - it's not like there are naked broads traipsing through the restaurant as your food is being grilled. That being said, Hae Woon Dae is likely one of the most authentic, albeit expensive, Korean barbecue joints that you're going to find in Atlanta.\\n\\nFood: During my visit, our party of four opted for a Korean-style pancake as an appetizer, and the pork bacon, beef tongue, marinated chicken, and beef ribs for entree meats. The meats were cooked by the waitress and served with lettuce wraps and a series of accoutrements, all of which were fresh and flavorful. The serving portions were all adequate for the group - for the most part, you should plan to order at least one plate of meat for each person at the table. \\n\\nService: Not particularly personable, but competent and efficient. Contrary to many of the other reviewers, I had absolutely no qualms with the waitress cooking the meat for us. As far as I'm concerned, the staff can go to town on the bucket of coals all they'd like. They obviously do this for a living, so their grilling skills are undoubtedly far superior to someone walking in off the street.\\n\\nAtmosphere: The interior of this place is fairly dark and run-down, so this isn't exactly the type of place you want to take a first date unless they have an appreciation for novel cuisine. The dining room consists of a series of centrally located tables, as well as individual dining rooms along the sides - each table has its own private grilling area in the center. \\n\\nCost: As other reviewers' have noted, this place is slightly overpriced for the quality and the quantity of the food. In the end, you're largely paying for the experience. Appetizers are $10-$15, barbecue meats are $15-$16, and dinner entrees are $9-$15. \\n\\nOther: First time visitors may have some difficulty finding this place - it's located in the plaza at the corner of Buford Highway and McElroy Rd (on the right side of the road if you're heading north). Parking is free in the plaza lot. Hours of operation are 11AM-6AM daily, expect on Wednesday when they close at midnight.

However, if you are in the mood for cheap, decent-quality and fairly tasty sushi and rolls, Kiku may be exactly what you are looking for. \\n\\nKiku offers half-price sushi and rolls for dinner every single day (dine-in only).  Some may argue that the \\"regular\\" menu price for the sushi and rolls are already \\"double\\" the price of similar sushi restaurants, but my husband (who absolutely loves sushi and seems to know his stuff about it) disagrees.  He says that the menu pricing for the sushi and rolls is pretty standard, so the half-price special is a great deal.\\n\\nWhen we are craving sushi but don't really want to spend big bucks on it, Kiku is our go-to place.  My favorite rolls are the Spider Roll (soft-shell crab) and Volcano Roll (topped with a mixture of scallops, sauteed vegetables, and roe).  I have to admit, the sauteed veggies that top the Volcano Roll remind me of Chinese stir-fry, and the roll is not like any other Volcano Roll I have had, but it's a decent roll.  The Spicy Tuna Roll is pretty standard but also good.\\n\\nI'm not a fan of nigiri (pressed sushi rice topped with raw seafood) so I haven't had it myself.  However, with the understanding that the seafood served here isn't the best quality, I would suggest that you primarily stick with the cooked sushi rolls or those that have a very minimal amount of raw seafood.\\n\\nOverall, Sushi Kiku gets 3.5 stars for their good, value-priced sushi and rolls.  On average, service has been \\"A-OK\\" as well - not the friendliest of employees but certainly not rude, and the food is served in a reasonable amount of time.  My husband and I are aware that Kiku offers a lunch buffet, but we have not yet had the opportunity to try it.

It wasn't busy when we got there but did pick up while we were eating. \\n\\nFirst impressions: small parking lot and spaces for that matter! Inside the place there's not a lot of seating which I was a little surprised at. Seems like this is mostly a to go place by the set up. I really liked the idea of this place so was eager to try it. \\n\\nI got some kind of Mexican pita and husband got the chicken shawarma. It didn't take them long to make them and we sat down to eat. \\n\\nI didn't like how the pita is so thick and heavy. I thought it would've been a little thinner and I don't know, warm?! Both our pitas were almost ice cold and that was a huge disappointment. Being cold, it made them hard too. Maybe if they weren't cold the whole meal would've been better but I wasn't impressed with the quality of the ingredients. The lettuce was brown and wilted, chicken was grayish and chewy and the rest of the veggies weren't ripe or fresh- like the tomatoes were almost pale pinkish white and flavorless and not a vibrant, red. color like fresh tomatoes are. \\n\\nI ate 3 bites and pitched the rest of mine. My husband ate probably 75% of his but he said he wouldn't get it again and just ate it not to waste money and he was really hungry. \\n\\nI completely agree with the reviewer who said this is like the subway of pita places.

At this newer location in Bexley, however, I had a frustrating experience. The cafeteria-style line works only if people are properly trained and can hear patrons. There was zero communication between the employees in the line. Also, the music was extremely loud. So we ended up saying the same thing over and over all the way down the line. This took forever, and there were countless flies flying around and landing on the food as the line moved very slowly. When I finally made it closer to the register, I asked for a glass of wine. (No one offered a beverage.) Seating was scant, so we were lucky to find a table. In stark contrast, I went to CoreLife Eatery at Olentangy the next day.

The food here is very good and the service is always awesome. \\n\\nOn my last visit, my party had two chimichangas and one side of beans. Both of the chimichangas had vegetarian green chile and tofu added (which cost extra). The bill, which we split evenly, was $17 per person. \\n\\nTheir chimichangas are very large, but they don't include any sides (they do have guacamole and sour cream, though). They are very tasty and I would highly recommend trying one. \\n\\nOur service was incredible as always. Everyone was attentive and very helpful. As the adage goes, our water glasses were never empty. \\n\\nMy only issue is that our party of two ended up spending $34 for two chimichangas with one side of beans. While this did include the added green chile, tofu, and tip, it still seems very high to me. Perhaps others would disagree, but in my experience with other Mexican restaurants, two vegetarian chimichangas with only one side of beans are typically less than this. \\n\\nDespite this, I will go back. I will just stay away from the vegetarian chimichanga and opt to order another dish that doesn't have add-on costs. \\n\\nTo sum it up, Casa Alvarez has good food and great service, but if you're adding extras to your dish, it can get a little pricey."},{"name":"Rudy's \\"Country Store\\" and Bar-B-Q","address":"11570 Research Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"On our last day in the area we did not want to drive out to Salt Lick nor wait in line for hours at some overhyped Food Network recommended joint.

A fantastic addition to the Oviedo area."},{"name":"American Girl Boston","address":"1245 Worcester St","city":"Natick","stars":"3.5","text":"Can you despise the devil but still admire his goatee? \\n\\nEverything about American Girl Place (store + cafe) is so wrong, yet so right.    In this day and age of wide-spread poverty, cholera epidemics, earthquakes, tsunamis and terrorism, it's hard to believe that there is a sect of Americans (of whom today I was one of) who are not just buying stuff but waiting in line to get $10 haircuts for our dolls.  Economic engine or sign of the apocolypse or both?\\n\\nIn any case, I took my two girls here on an early-release day from school, and let me tell me you THAT WAS GENIUS.  If you ever attempted a trip to an American Girl store on a weekend, or heaven forbid, near a gift-centric holiday, you'll know it's like trying to get on the last helicopter out of Viet Nam.   But on the day I went, the store was empty, and the employees were on the lookout for customers.  Therefore, my experience was aberrant.\\n\\nSo if you if you can suspend disbelief, that is that these American Girl dolls are real, and you are a parent who can enjoy a pretend tea party (not the political kind) with real food, then it really can be a nice moment or two.  However, if you're watching your budget, have a poor imagination, or care about food quality and value, you're in the wrong place.\\n\\nIt starts with being seated.  Again, this is usually a head-slapping process where you are waiting to give them your money.  On this visit, we were seated promptly and we had our choice of seats--we sat by the window.  The waitress (who rocked) brought us two chairs for the American Girls and each American Girl gets their own little teacup filled with real pink lemonade.   I thought this was a sweet touch-- it's literally a thimbleful, and the waitress gladly refilled it when the girls had drained it dry. \\n\\nThe food menu is interesting, too-- they make you pay $16 for each lunch, but each lunch comes with a 'starter' and an entree.   We chose the warm pretzel bites (yummy), fruit with yogurt (standard), and very veggie platter (I asked for mostly carrots).  These were beautifully plated affairs, but their beauty was alas, their best feature.  Their quality was no better than that of the nearby mall kiosk selling the same wares.\\n\\nFor lunch, my girls quizzically ordered the spaghetti and meatballs, and I had the spinach salad with chicken.  Though appetizer-sized, my salad was excellent and fresh.  Much better than I thought.  I was impressed with the range of items both on the menu and in my salad-- I thoroughly enjoyed it.   The girls enjoyed their pasta, but avoided the meatballs. Based on the one I tried, which had the texture of a sponge full of paper mache and almost no color, I can only conclude that they were made of soylent green and should be avoided at all costs.  \\n\\nFor dessert we ordered the warm cookies and milk.  This is a dessert that has been popping up at high-and-lowbrow places over the years and it's hard to mess up.  The cookies were nice and the milk was cold and everyone was happy. \\n\\nIn conclusion, though I strenuously object to the existence of the American Girl store, and the idea that grown men and women are given the job of cutting the hair and trimming the nails of some kid's doll, I have to admit that it's a reality, and in small doses during non-holiday times it can be almost charming if the experience makes your daughter's smile light up.\\n\\nThe cafe gets high marks for its beautiful arrangement of foods, as well as its inclusion of healthy foods like fruit, vegetables, salad and fish entrees.  It's rare you take your kid to a theme restaurant that serves tilapia.  Is anyone actually ordering it?  That's for the AGP staff to know, but it tells me someone's heart is in the right place, nutritionally speaking.   \\n\\nFrom a value perspective, be forewarned: this is not a place for people on a budget! $16 per kid is a lot, especially when the kids would be happy just to eat pretzels and dessert.  You'll also get the saucer-eyes when your kids tell you that their dolls need new clothes, and you'll really feel the pinch if you need either a new doll or doll furniture, that is nearly as expensive as the real thing.  Unlike Jordan's furniture, the American Girl doll furniture showroom does not feature \\"underprices\\"\\n\\nLastly, if you can get there on an off-day (not a weekend), it's totally worth it, if only to admire the goatee of the devil."},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Delicious street vendor style Thai / SE Asian food.

The sushi was so good. I love the Monster roll the most. The salmon skewers, and sauteed spinach were my favorite hot items. I also loved the Miso soup and vegetable fried rice. I arrived at 1:30 PM, and was able to rack up on sushi for me and my boyfriend( who arrived at 2 PM). The kitchen does not  cook any more food, or prepare any more sushi after 2 PM on Fridays and they also put the food away at 2:15 PM. All of the good Sushi and entrees will be gone. I will be back, but I want to enjoy the food unrushed. We just happened to be running late this time, so I did not leave as satisfied as I did on Valentine's Day. Next time I will come around noon or 1 PM. They still have the best sushi that I have ever tasted."},{"name":"Buster's Bistro","address":"412 S Sanford Ave","city":"Sanford","stars":"4.5","text":"Ok, this place deserves 5 stars for interior and execution but I'm giving it 4 based on personal taste.  What does that mean?  Tell ya in a bit.\\n\\nI'm not sure why it's called a bistro because it isn't but that doesn't detract from what has to be fasted shell to complete bar construction I've ever seen in my life.  In five weeks they went from a bare shell to open and running.  It appears they did this by creating a really cool space that combines class without pretension.  It's a minimalist interior that still feels welcoming.  Nice bathrooms too.\\n\\nThe bar is very large for the space with a bunch of taps lining the back bar area.  They are beer and wine only so if you want liquor you'll have to pop next door to Fat Rats.  They have a European style glass \\"chiller\\" that quickly sprays cold water into your glass before the pour the draft.  I think it helps with over foaming as well but don't quote me on that.  There is a glass for almost every beer they serve here washing them must truly suck.  \\n\\nService has been excellent and attentive and most importantly informative.  The informative is very, very important because the beer list is Belgian.  This is where the 4 stars instead of 5 comes into play for me.  I love the Belgian beers that I love but some of them I simply cannot stand.  Belgium makes beer like no other country in Europe with a huge range of styles.  However, the hop is not as forward in Belgian beers as in German or in British Ales.  That's fine but after a couple of sweet, malty Belgian dubbels or such I'd like a crisp hop heavy beer to cleanse my palate.  They do have Stella but I like German and Czech pilsners for prolonged drinking if I'm not dabbling in the incomparable American craft beer scene.  Belgian beers are of the highest quality and they probably have something for every taste but I'd like to see them add some selections more to my taste.  Minor gripe I know.\\n\\nLong story short...if you like quality beer served by people who educate you without beer snob attitude then this is your place.  Along with the Imperial it's making downtown Sanford worth the drive if you're willing.  Oh, and I think they're starting to serve food!"},{"name":"Gennaro's Eatery","address":"12 Blanchard Rd","city":"Quincy","stars":"4","text":"Me & my wife order from here alot.

Parking - pretty much right beside the convention center so don't be cheap and just valet or be prepared to walk a few blocks. \\n\\n2. Place doesn't look like much at all on the outside, but failry nice inside, even though they clearly are out of space as we sat out in a big plastic tent. Will definitely prefer to sit inside next time. \\n\\n3. BARs - there are 2 bars here, one small on on inside and one on the patio. Good selection. \\n\\n4. They don't take reservations but 6 of us showed up around 8:00 pm on a Saturday night and only waited around 20-30 minutes, which gave us time to try a cocktail. \\n\\n5. MENU - can't say enough about this. Really nice to find a menu with a different selection of items that you won't typically find anywhere else. THe appetizers (corn dog shrimp and calamari) were very good, and the Jalapeno cornbread that I read about was very good. Cornbread isn't served until your meal is laid out so don't be expecting it to come with the popcorn (oh yeah that's one of the free appetizers to help your friends). My wife had the Ham & Bean Soup which she loved as well. We also got both versions of the Macaroni and Cheese (one is an appetizer and one an entree) both were too die for while I'm sure high in calories..but what the heck it is the holidays. \\n\\nI got the rainbow trout and the ms. got the flat iron steak, both to die for. Our guests tried the Pork Loin and everything was great. \\n\\n6. DESSERT - desserts are very good. We got Peanut Butter Mousse and Red Velvet and shared with 6 at the table. Huge portions here, so no need to get one for yourself. \\n\\n7. SERVICE - Our waiter was very fun and energetic and stayed on top of our party of 6, even though a couple of the guys drank a beer in like 5 seconds and were pounding (something their wives were on them all night about). \\n\\nIt was a bit odd that they automatically added gratuity on parties of 6, where I'm used to that being done on parties of 8 or more. This costs our waitress as we were ready to put on 20% or more for gratuity but out of principal noone at the table wanted to put on more given they already added. I'm curious what others feel about this. I'm always a big tipper, just thought the autoTIP on just 6 of us was a bit odd. \\n\\nHope you guys and gals get a chance to try this one soon. The uniqueness of the menu alone is worth checking it out with a fun group. \\n\\nGood luck!!"},{"name":"827 Rays Kitchen + Cellar","address":"3519 Ranch Road 620 N","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Well tonight was our 3rd time at Ray's ( there was an accident on 620 this evening so we couldn't get down to some of our favorite places!)

So I went here with high expectations and hopes (despite the fact that it now has nothing to do with those prior establishments) and was certainly not disappointed.  It could have been damn close to a 5-star experience, except for the fact that they brought my dining companion a glass of stale vinegary wine to start, and then didn't bring the replacement that was asked for for a solid 10 minutes.\\n\\nOne thing I definitely don't understand is people complaining about the small portions at this place.  If you want a 4-pound entree for $12.95 then yes, you may be disappointed and should probably stick with the Cheesecake Factory.  Seriously, I'm 6' and most definitely not a light eater and I walked out of this place perfectly satisfied.\\n\\nWe started with the \\"Fried Artichokes with A√Øoli\\" from the \\"Petites Bouch√©es\\" menu (I know, intentionally ordering a small dish to start and to share no less, how terrible!).  The artichokes were cooked perfectly, lightly battered and deep-fried, but of course the a√Øoli was what made them really stand out.  Incredibly tasty and combined with the amazing fresh bread that was brought out, it was a great way to start things off.\\n\\nFor an entree I had the \\"Classic Proven√ßal Beef Daube, Mashed Potatoes with Olive Oil\\".  The beef brought on a flashback to the braised shortribs I'd recently enjoyed at Toro (which, to be honest, I slightly preferred to this dish mainly due to the sauces that were used at Toro and here).  The real winner here was the mashed potatoes.  Oh my GOD were they heavenly.  The potato was essentially a delivery mechanism for mouthfuls of butter, cream, and olive oil.  Astoundingly decadent and delicious!  My companion had the \\"Grilled Sea Bass, Slow Cooked Fennel, Sauce Vierge\\", and I have to say that as good as mine was, I think hers was better.  Next time I go, I'm ordering that dish (assuming it's still on the menu, of course).\\n\\nBy the time dessert rolled around we were both thinking it would be nice to have something sweet but we weren't quite convinced any room remained.  The waiter suggested we consider the trio of sorbets (blood orange, coconut, and raspberry), and I'm ecstatic that we took his advice.  The judging was unanimous: Raspberry was the favorite based solely on the intense flavor, followed closely by coconut due to it's decidedly un-sorbet-like creamy texture, and last but by no means least, the blood orange.  At one point I was laughing hysterically at the look of sheer bliss on my companion's face, which prompted her to ask if others in the dining room were going to start wondering if she was reenacting the diner scene from \\"When Harry Met Sally\\".  I have to say these sorbets were entirely worthy of such a reaction though!  To top it all off the waiter brought us some delicious handmade nougats to take home.  We opted instead to eat them then and there, and after simply asking nicely he brought us some more to take home.  Yum!\\n\\nFinal verdict: A well-prepared, well-presented meal in a nice relaxing & romantic atmosphere, for prices that seemed quite reasonable (yes, it's not cheap compared to your local chain restaurant, but it's not at all expensive given the quality of the food).  I'll be back, hopefully soon, despite the minor glitch with the wine early in the evening.

I made my best attempt to roll in with an open mind, telling myself to not be influenced by my previously unfortunate experience.

I have gotten either an ice coffee or an ice cappuccino from there the past few times and they are always disappointing. Instead of keeping the ice coffee either cold or room temperature like it should be, the boiling hot coffee from the pots is poured over an overfilled cup of ice. What your left with is a watery substance that vaguely tastes like coffee and it's not even filled up all the way! I have gotten the \\"eye-opener\\" before that the owner always recommends, I guess it is a type of espresso shot, and I'm sorry, it is absolutely disgusting and will ruin your coffee even more.

As expected from reading other reviews the wait was long (1.5 hr estimate on a Friday night which turned out to be extremely accurate) so we stopped here first to put our names down. The whiskey lounge across the street is a great place to grab a drink and wait and they'll even tell you when your table is ready over at Pok Pok.\\n\\nWe got the famous fish sauce wings which I would give a 3.5/5. Quite salty as other reviews have mentioned so it's nice to eat with the cold cucumbers/carrots and veggies they provide on the plate. The fish sauce flavor is nice and there's a good amount of spice and the skin is crispy but a bit dry. Overall pretty average though since we've definitely had lots of great Asian style wings in the bay.\\n\\nThe Khao soy was my favorite dish of the night. The broth is absolutely what makes this dish. It's extremely flavorful and the coconut, curry and spices come together in a very creamy and aromatic broth. The chicken is very tender. I opted to finish every last drop of this broth while we still had food remaining in other dishes.\\n\\nThe boar collar was my second favorite. Be warned it's quite spicy! The great texture of the meat soaks up the sauce of garlic, chili's and fish oil nicely cut with citrus for a well balanced dish. I definitely recommend ordering the sticky rice with this and munching on the cold mustard greens they provide with it to help balance the heat.\\n\\nLast thing we got was the Kung op wan sem, or the glass noodle clay pot dish with prawns and pork belly. I wasn't a huge fan of this and we didn't end up finishing most of the noodles. The noodles were quite dry and sticky and flavorless. They didn't seem to catch any of the flavor in the rest of the clay pot despite our incessant mixing. The prawns were delicious with the citrusy fish sauce they provide and the pork belly is quite tender as well.\\n\\nNext time I would just order the khao soy and boar collar with sticky rice. The wings were too salty for my taste (I'm still thirsty even as I write this hours after the meal)."},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"This is only the best bookstore of all time!

I've always been a huge, huge fan of the cookies at Uppercase. I made the drive to UBC dozens of times a year (long after I graduated) just so I could buy a batch of Marbellous cookies to share with visiting friends and family. They would never fail to be amazed by how large and soft and crumbly and PERFECT these cookies were. Even the most serious foodies in my group (a very well travelled bunch) admitted that they had never tasted a cookie with such incredible texture and flavour.\\n\\nBut alas! The last couple of times I went, the cookies have been small and stale and utterly terrible! At first I just thought I got a bad batch. But after a few months, it seems that the cookies aren't made the way they should be. They seem to make only one or two batches a day, and just leave them there (instead of making fresh cookies every hour, as they used to). The cookies have a hard crunch, and none of that soft crumble underneath (that made biting into these cookies so much fun).The generous portion of white choclate has been replaced by a miniscule, miserly piece (doled out by a penny pinching Scrooge McDuck no doubt.) And that's when they actually made the cookies at all.\\n\\nMany times I was told they didn't have any cookies. And when I asked when they would make the next batch (so I could go wait in my car) they said they may not make any more that day! Ridiculous! Especially when you consider that I came over several times on weekdays at 10:00am or 11:00am in the morning. It's not like I came at the end of the day expecting cookie miracles!\\n\\nThe girl at the counter was friendly, and the service was great, which is why I've given them two stars. Now I don't know who is in charge of management and cookie preparation, but I am dismayed by the state of these cookies.

But that's ok.\\nThat said, the food was so delicious. We went during the 2:30 to 5:00 hour when the menu is small but I still had a hard time choosing. I ordered the fish sauce wings because the menu basically said I have to, and they did not disappoint. Pungent, sticky, juicy, savory. I ordered them spicy but I think they must have mixed our wings with someone else's because I did not get any heat. I didn't mind.\\nI heard the owner talk about his drinking vinegar on NPR (The Splendid Table)  the other day and like a good food media consumer I decided to try it. I was a little nervous to drink a vinegar mixture but I found it to be the perfect refreshment to the big flavors of the wings and the shredded pork over coconut rice. Tart, slightly sweet and the soda adds a good bit of fizzy.\\nThe service was pretty typical Northwest style. Dry and efficient but otherwise unremarkable. I wonder sometimes if higher minimum wage keeps places from hiring enough people, servers in Seattle and Portland always seem to be in a rush. It doesn't bother me, but it's on the brain lately because a friend recently complained the service is unfriendly in the Northwest. I digress.\\nThe ambiance is cool and warm and mostly open air.

You know why, Yelp originally had the business address to their office and not the actual restaurant. Why did you do this to me, Yelp!\\n\\nPrior to knowing the correct one, I tried to look for it only to go home alone and empty handed. Sigh. The next time I had the craving for frozen dessert, I was armed with a more resourceful approach by so desperately calling them up to ask - \\"where are you?\\" (joined by a croak in my voice with one tear falling down my right eye and my tummy growling in the background. No this isn't a prank call.) Take note of this or else you will end up disappointed while walking endlessly along Seymour like I did when all along they were at Hornby. :(\\n\\nThis place has a lot of potential. At the moment I can hear the crickets chirping. However, like others have mentioned it's still under soft opening. It needs background music and WiFi access to attract local residents to hang out and patronize the place.\\n\\nI spoke to the store keeper, Henry, and their frozen custard offering was very promising as the main attraction. In fact they are currently thinking of scrapping gelato altogether. Which means that the gelato display case is currently not being used at all. I asked why they can't just use it to display the frozen custard variety which is very much hidden and he said it wasn't visually colourful unlike the others because they don't add artificial colouring. Most of the custard they make is light yellow regardless of flavour because it's influenced by the egg yolk. Chocolate is the only exception, obviously.\\n\\nFrozen custard is different from ice cream because apart from cream and sugar, it contains a high percentage of butterfat and eggs yolks and has less air incorporated in the mix. The result is a thick, creamy and smooth treat for your mouth.\\n\\nMilwaukee Market Creamery had four flavours when I visited the place - vanilla, banana, coconut and lemon. Although I thoroughly enjoyed the banana frozen custard with the presence of fresh banana pieces, I believe the classic vanilla wins hands down to suit any palate. Because of on-site preparation, their flavours change so it would be good to call from time to time to check what they have concocted.\\n\\nThey currently have two sizes which is either a two-scoop or three-scoop order. And you can enjoy it in a cup or on a waffle cone (my choice of serving, unless you decide to have it prepared as a sundae).\\n\\nTheir menu is still expanding, but I can only hope whatever they introduce they keep the frozen custard variety. We already know where to go if we want our soft serve, gelato and frozen yogurt. But for frozen custard, this place has got to stay!"},{"name":"Powell's City of Books","address":"1005 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"5","text":"!!! WOW!!!

I visited recently, and this review reflects impressions over the years and comments on my most recent visit. \\n\\nThe food here is great, and as its nickname suggests, its calamari is the best on the planet. Together with a little marinara, it's truly sublime. The other specialty is Black (squid ink) linguine with garlic and olive oil or with scallops or puntenesca sauce. Again, some the the best pasta you'll ever eat. \\n\\nThe restaurant is tiny. Only five tables, so expect to sit among or with strangers and expect very tight quarters. The kitchen is in the same room and is wide open in front of you. I still haven't decided after all these years if the size is an issue or part of the charm. It's also noisy, between the closeness of the tables and the kitchen. \\n\\nI've noticed a couple of trouble spots on my most recent visit (after not going for about 6 years):  each entree is now served directly in the skillet in which they are cooked. I am certain we used to be served on dishes or bowls. I DO NOT enjoy eating food out of a frying pan!  May I please have a dish?!  The wine is now served in plastic cups and again it didn't used to be that way. Glasses with stems, please. NOT PLASTIC!  I also noticed there isn't a line up of people a half a block long anymore. It used to be that no matter when you came, there was a line, and that was part of the charm. Why is there no line anymore?  Finally I noticed the clientele has changed:  it is no longer locals, Italian Americans, tourists and young hip couples. It's now patronized almost entirely by Asians. At one point, we were the only Caucasians among some 25 Asians and Asian-Americans. Not sure what this means or how to interpret this, nor am I making any judgement about it. I am merely reporting what I observed and experienced. \\n\\nIt's amazing how the Daily Catch has evolved from my first visit in 1983.

Coquille is entirely seafood centered, and I love it. Their dishes range from comfort to elegant, and they deliver both with extravagant skills and flavors. I had bookmarked Coquille for awhile, but after seeing their seafood platter, I knew I had to go immediately. \\n\\nThat night, I made a reservation for 5:30. Upon arriving, my friend and I requested the seashell seats, and the server gladly seated us (and even thanked us for letting him know what we wanted). The ambiance was good - not too loud and very relaxing. However, I did find the tables arranged a little too closely. \\n\\nWe ordered the medium seafood platter, neptune mushroom, and scalloped potatoes. \\n\\nMedium Seafood Platter (9/10)\\nThe platter consisted of 8 oysters, 5 snow crab legs, 2 uni with ikura, 1 lobster, a number of shrimps, and samples of crudo and cold appetizers. Everything was served on a big plate with a bed of ice. I was impressed by the presentation and would prefer to have this over the conventional seafood tower. Everything was phenomenal, and my favorite was the uni. Despite the huge portion, my friend and I finished it with no problem and even wondered if we should've gone for the large order. However, I did find the oysters to be a little smaller than most I've had at other places. \\n\\nNeptune Mushroom (9/10)\\nBeautifully coated with a generous blanket of cream (or milk) and cheese. I've always loved mushrooms, but I never thought I'd ever have mushrooms made so delicious (although a bit rich and satiating). The mushrooms were cut into long, big slices and their flavors well preserved under the cheese blanket. \\n\\nScalloped Potatoes (8/10)\\nWe wanted to get another seafood dish, but somehow we ended up ordering scalloped potatoes from the sides menu. I don't regret it, though. The potatoes were cut into thin slices, and each were cooked to the perfect texture - soft but not yet grainy. However, after two rich dishes (mushroom and potatoes, both cooked similarly), I got full really soon. \\n\\nOverall, Coquille is definitely worth a second visit. I will go back at least twice: once to try their other seafood dishes, and once for their chirashi bowl (served at lunch)."},{"name":"Wings Over Somerville","address":"519 Somerville Ave","city":"Somerville","stars":"2.5","text":"where's our food?!\\n\\ntheir delivery  s u c k s .\\n\\nguy rings the intercom to the building, we answer immediately, tell him come up, buzz him in, and he disappears?!  \\n\\nunit number and instructions were on the order, clear as can be.  we waited an hour for delivery, no dinner, and they're not answering the phone.\\n\\nordering and having the delivery flake out is as bad as it gets... first and last order from here."},{"name":"Weather Up","address":"1808 E Cesar Chavez St","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"My boyfriend and I ventured to Austin, TX for his 30th birthday.

Itz the r0x0rs!!!  b3st fo0dz EVAHHH!!!\\nRave rave rave reviews of this place - best in Portland - despite my skepticism since I knew it started as a food cart.  I heard it again and again.  I wondered what the buzz was about, so I came with a friend on Friday with time to kill, a couple yuppie food stamps ($20) to give it a whirl.  I was prepared to be floored.  \\n\\nThe experience: Did you want to do anything Friday night besides stand on the street corner for a few hours in the cold or under cheap-*ss plastic tarps hung from even cheaper slap-dash patio overhangs?   Do you want to stand in a long line for at least an hour or two to get jammed into a seat elbow-to-elbow either outside in the cold/wet or down in the basement where it's hotter than h*ll with other folks that'll be battling for the same wait staff for a refill?  Wanna do all that when there are literally 100 other Thai places in Portland but you just have to go to that hip place everyone's talking about?  Then this is your location!\\n\\nAfter arriving and putting our name on the list, we were told it'd be at least an hour.  We went over to the bar they'd bought to pass the time.  No seats there either by the way.  We stood and ordered a drink.  Mine eventually arrived after a solid 20 minute wait while I sat and WATCHED it sitting on the back bar for 10 of those minutes.  They were woefully under-staffed for the hordes.  After the requisite hour+ of getting constantly bumped and jostled around in the bar because people were constantly coming/going - thankfully our names got called.  \\n\\nWe were lucky.  People were smashed in everywhere around the restaurant under, I kid you not, plastic tents with clear-plastic walls to keep out the cold.  The people in them looked miserable. We got to go to the basement bar - and took a seat at the bar when given the choice between that and being smashed into a 1x1 foot table in the middle of 20 other people.  \\n\\nWe were starving by then - so we ordered noodles+chicken and a few other tidbits.  More waiting with the odd refill when the bartender wasn't getting overrun.  Food itself - a solid C-.  The chicken was fine inside but burned a bit on the outside - flavor was odd and very forgettable.  The noodles were dry and just got worse as I ate them.  Overall - very forgettable.  \\n\\nThen they kick you in the jimmy when you get the bill.  It's WAAYYYY too high for what you get.  They try to 'dress up' the dishes in odd bowls/etc to make it look like you're getting something exotic - but you're not.  And it certainly doesn't justify the price.\\n\\nOverall - blew 3 hours, got some chicken and noodles that wasn't so great, dropped $20 more than it was worth, and felt exhausted after fighting the crowds.  Neither of us was impressed we went out elsewhere for an appetizer to kind of cleanse the palette.\\n\\nI'll again re-iterate - nobody should have to wait 3 hours to get food unless I can call and make a reservation remotely and show up when *I* want.  The last time I saw other places that force people to stand on street corners for hours waiting for food went away when the iron curtain fell.  Oh, and NEVER take a first or second date here.  The experience of getting treated like a number, constantly bumped and jostled around, practically dumped in some strangers lap while taking a 50/50 shot at eating outside under tarp-o-land and spending exhausting hours doing it will ensure a bad impression let alone kill all conversation.\\n\\nOnly thing I can think of is that all the amazing reviews come because the patrons who write them are near starved to death after waiting for so long - and ANYTHING will taste an order of magnitude better if you've been forced to wait that long to get dinner.\\n\\nNo Pok Pok, you can go-go, cause you make me cry-cry."},{"name":"Mad Mex - Columbus","address":"South Campus Gateway, 1542 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"Everything is delicious except the carrot cake, it was dry... but I don't go there for that, I go for the other food...

I came to Boston for biz and my gorgeous colleague took me to this place for dinner.  It is one of her favorite places in B-town.\\n\\nWe got there a little before our reservation time, so we went to the bar for a cocktail.  I am all about wine (to a certain extent) but when the by-the-glass-wine list starts at $10 for the cheapest, I forgo that for a cocktail.  Seriously, all restaurants should have a decent $7 house chardonnay, cab and merlot. When a glass of wine is equal to a cocktail and when you don't even have a clue about the wine,  forget it.\\n\\nAlso, I am so tired of these stupid ass trendy cocktails i.e. \\"rye with basil, peppermint and beer\\"  or \\"beer with ginger ale and thyme\\"  Please new food and drink trend setters, get over yourselves its gotten inane.   So I didn't bother reading the tiny pint of their selection of nouveau drinks and asked the bartender to make me something vodka based with cucumber and not very sweet.  I don't know if there is a name to this but I guess cucumber is so 10 minutes ago.  This drink had vodka, lemonade and fennel juice.  It was actually very good despite that fennel juice is on my list of inane cocktail ingredients.\\n\\nOK the food.  Very good.  Not over the top fabulous but very good.  My colleague and I split an order of fried clams.  They were amazing.  We also split a clam/chorizo stew and a lobster roll.

If you don't agree with me, then go to LA and after you've been in the land of I-wanna-be-like-someone-on-TV, then come talk to me.  In contrast, in Boston,  people sitting at the bar alone are reading books.  Put an ear to the conversation next to you, it most likely will have some substance to it. So Boston always has a leg up for that.  On top of it, this place has great design.

Our half of the table ordered a bunch of different things: boar collar, papaya salad with the salted crab, the spicy crawfish, and the pork belly. All these along with the sticky rice on the side. The boar collar was really spicy but it went great with their frozen greens. The spicy crawfish was really yummy too and a little spicy (also had a side of greens with it). The papaya salad with the salted crab was SUPER SALTY! They warned us it would be salty but we wanted to try it. It was still good, and if you eat it with a piece of cabbage it lessens the salt. The sticky rice also helps with the saltiness or spiciness. The flavors were really different and something I've never had. The meat of the pork belly and the boar collar were tender. The pork belly was hands down the favorite because of the tenderness of the meat and deliciousness of the sauce. \\n\\nOverall, it was a good experience.

Imaginative interpretations on standard fare that don't go overboard but still manage to surprise you. The menu is short and everything is made from scratch (beware long menus--means things are made up way ahead of time and they will be stale!). Everything was beautifully presented, the service was great--attentive, unobtrusive, and I was never rushed even though I was a single diner (lots of places try to hustle out a single diner to free up the table for two).  Definitely worth the money--and it's a pretty average price for good artisan food in a big city, frankly. \\n\\nWhile munching on the plantain chips, which are addictive, frankly, I started with a deconstructed Dark and Stormy made with Zaya 12 year-old rum (unusual--a very good rum)--delish and served up in a zombie glass so one can appreciate the layering of the ginger and the rum. (Btw: if you read the complaint below about the mai-tai, pay no attention: a mai-tai is not supposed to be red and yellow, it's supposed to be made with rum, lime juice, and orgeat as a base--it will look kind of murky--that's the original Trader Vic's recipe.) I ordered one of the evening's specials: the Brussels sprouts. Transcendent experience! They were halved, grilled crispy on the round side, and served with a kind of shallot confit. YUM. At that point I ordered a glass of malbec (sorry--don't remember which label) which was recommended by my server--she did not steer me wrong--spicy, fruity, with depth; just perfect with the rest of my meal. \\n\\nI also got the grilled squash in a sweet chili sauce with crispy shallots. It was good, but the sauce was a little on the sweet side for my palate (most people would have been fine with it). I ordered the albondigas, which had a subtle, yet enticing flavor, complemented by the sauce and fresh chopped herbs. They came topped with three exquisitely grilled slices of home made bread--grilled in a press so they had big grooves in addition to grill marks. This all managed to be elegant and rustic at the same time. The bacalaitos fritos are what it sounds like: cod fritters. They were topped with a soft dollop of potato/cod mixture--also good and the chef did not cut corners on desalting the bacalao. Dessert: an apple tart (puff pastry square) with the a small scoop of ice cream in a cordial glass--the latter topped with the most spectacular spun SALTED caramel cluster I've ever seen. It was a shame to eat it, it was so pretty but that didn't stop me. \\n\\nYes, this is all WAY, WAY too much food for one person, even for someone who likes to eat a lot--I knew I needed leftovers for lunch tomorrow (it will be a big lunch) so that's OK, I only ate half of everything (except dessert).

When I first started coming here I would have given it 5, but I know better now.  \\n\\nI will say first of all that the food is legitimately good, and if you are judging it solely on that it deserves at least a 4.  It is the only, if not one of the few at most, legit veg/vegan restaurants in the Boston area.  What I meant by this is that there is no attempt to use meat replacements.  Tofu and legumes.  That's it.  The entree designs are pretty basic and all very similar but they back this up with smoothies and a juice bar.  Most of the stuff is vegan and I am pretty sure if it's not that it can by made that way.\\n\\nWhat I am REALLY starting to get sick of is the attitudes of the staff here.  I have had multiple close friends who have worked here but anyone who I don't know has never exactly related me warmly or made me feel welcome.  I feel like I am squatting in an exclusive club which is ironic for the general name and mantra of this place.  \\n\\nI have learned not to ask questions.  When they ask you if you are sitting up or downstairs just pick one.  This may mean you go downstairs and find no open tables and then have to go upstairs again and also find no open tables.  Then they'll mix up where your order goes and they'll blame you for that.  If you start to walk away after scanning your phone for LevelUp they won't politely tell you it hasn't processed.  They'll snarkly remark that you shouldn't \\"run away\\" and then glare at you.\\n\\nThe place is definitely overpriced in my opinion.  If you order anything more than a basic entree you're probably gonna be spending close to $20 per person and for a place that is considered casual dining that's a little much.  With so many people behind the counter you can still end up waiting 15 minutes before getting your food.\\n\\nThere is a lot of hype around this place and maybe the locations in Salem and Lowell are better, but I am all but through here.

With 1,800 reviews and 4 and a half stars, my dad and I had to try it out. We were not disappointed. \\n\\nThe restaurant has a very nice ambience (not too loud, considering the amount of people inside). We sat at the bar. The bartender(s) were very nice and very knowledgable about the the menu and the oysters on the raw bar. Our bartender was very helpful in letting us know what oysters to order. We went with his suggestions and ordered 3 Island Creek oysters, 3 Row 34 oysters, 3 First Encounter oysters, and 3 Spring Creek oysters.\\n\\nAll 12 oysters we ordered were delectable. Some were a bit salty, but all were full of flavor and tasted fresh. The brine did not deaden the flavor at all. They tasted like they were just pulled out of the Atlantic. I never had oysters that tasted so fresh and fantastic.\\n\\nFor our main course, we ordered the ICOB Bouillabaisse  and the Lobster Roe Noodles. There was a slight mishap with our order and a Lobster Roll arrived at our table instead of the Lobster Roe Noodles. We sent the lobster roll back, and my dad and I shared the ICOB Bouillabaisse while the Lobster Roe Noodles were cooking.\\n\\nThe ICOB Bouillabaisse was good, but nothing extraordinary. It is what you would expect from a seafood broth/stew. The halibut was the best part of that dish. It was so full of flavor and it soaked up the broth and the flavor of the other seafoods in the dish.\\n\\nThe real hit was the Lobster Roe Noodles. The shortrib was braised to perfection and it was fantastic. Second the lobster; it was cooked just right and was delectable. The noodles also had a perfect seafood taste, as they incorporate the roe into the noodles themselves. The sauce was also a very nice complement to the rest of the dish. This made the entire dinner.\\n\\nAll in all, I would highly recommend ICOB to anyone visiting Boston.

Went there with my wife and child.  It's a small place with maybe five booths, 6 tables that seat 4-6 people, and a few seats at the bar, so probably not the best for large groups.  Service was friendly and timely enough.  The menu has enough variety to come back quite a few times.  I'm never a big fan of televisions in the dining area, but I'm probably in the minority.  At least the volume was down. Gringos (like me) can celebrate, because the chips for the chips and salsa shatter with a satisfying crunch!  The salsa was a little bland for my taste, and even though I requested salsa that was \\"mas picante\\", it too was fairly tame.  I was hopeful the corn tortillas for my tacos were handmade, but despite the fact they weren't, the remaining ingredients were fresh and delicious.  The enchiladas ARE prepared with handmade tortillas and were also delicious.  Everything was well seasoned.  Presentation was average.

The cocktails are good, probably the best part. For some reason the mashed potatoes are way over salted which I found strange. One other aspect that keeps me from rating this place higher is the cost to portion ratio. My cousin paid 17 dollars for a steak salad which isn't unfair but the amount of food she got was scarce.

Let me start by saying Kizuki is not your typical Japanese izakaya, or at least not one like I ever frequented while in Japan.  This isn't the hole in the wall, milk crate on the floor seating, banter with the wait staff while consuming lots of beer/sake between dishes, get blotto before staggering off to take the train home kind of establishment I got used to.  Yes, you can order from a host of small dishes to go with your sake and/or beer, but with Kizuki's gorgeous interior, it's more attuned to high-end Western restaurant norms.  Dishes arrive in a set order served by the uniformed staff and guests eat/drink in reverential near-silence.  No out-of-tune impromptu karaoke singing by tooted salary men here (and that's a good thing)...\\n\\nWe ordered takoyaki and bowls of the garlic ramen (with pork belly and soft-boiled egg).  Kizuki's take on the takoyaki was a bit different than the street food version I scarfed up by the box-full in Tokyo, but very nicely done, with lots of sauce, mayo and shaved bonito waving around on top.  The broth and ramen were excellent and my family slurped it up with gusto.  We also got a free order of deep-fried gyoza that was mistakenly brought to our table, but I'm not complaining, though I tend to like mine pan-fried/steamed.\\n\\nThough not the best ramen and broth ever, overall, Kizuki is a place I will be visiting again.

Saigon noodles with all your Thai ingredients and goodness, piled high with plenty of crispy chicken and a side of a few orange slices and what I presumed to be duck sauce.

The Japanese Curry Chicken was just as delicious; perfect for someone who wants a curry dish that isn't accompanied by the numbing spiciness that a lot of curry dishes come with.

I've eaten here in the past and had great experiences, but yesterday was a bit different. \\nThankfully we got a free parking spot on the street so that did not add to the headache I was about to get from dining anxiety. \\nMy boyfriend was experiencing TFK for the first time, and I as a returning customer, was excited for him to try it out. It took a little bit for them to seat us which was rather odd because there were probably about 20 empty four top tables during their \\"busy dinner hour\\". After being seated our waitress, who was seemingly very green(new) with the restaurant, came to the table and greeted us politely. She then proceeded to tell us about some of the specials and a little bit about the seasonal menu. She explained that all of the ingredients on the menu were \\"anti-inflammatory\\" and that was why they didn't serve pork. Lol. (Totally unrelated by the way. As long as you source good wild, unprocessed pork, it's fine)  \\n\\nNow, that may be true for most of the ingredients on their menu, but it is not true for all of them when you consider that every person reacts differently to different ingredients in regards to inflammation. I follow an autoimmune protocol lifestyle, which means a lot of foods cause inflammation in my body. Eating out is a treat for me so I try to be very cautious as to what I eat when I do dine out. \\n\\nI first asked to try the soup upon request that the waitress confirm the fact that there were no nightshades in it. (She had no clue what that even was.) When she returned to the table after checking on that a second time, she corrected her answer and said that there indeed was jalape√±o in the soup which eliminated it for me. Crisis averted. Awesome. \\n\\nGoing back to the seasonal menu I noticed that there were not going to be very many options for me this time. I won't make the mistake of not looking at the menu online before I go again. As a last resort, and in an attempt to stop the anxiety attack I felt coming on, I handed the waitress my allergy card and asked her to work with the chef to find a dish that fit my lifestyle. After a few trips back and forth for confirmations on ingredients, we settled on a very plain Poke Tuna bowl. \\n\\nIt was later brought to the table by a woman who appeared to be the Manager on Duty. She explained the ingredients in my dish and which ones they eliminated, which was great! Then the waitress brought a small dish of Tamari sauce to the table as a dressing. Thoughtful, but it's made from soy, so I also couldn't use it. Even though the manager insisted I could. After I brain farted on the fact that mushrooms, which I reintroduced about a year ago, are listed as nightshades, she queried in the most condescending tone I've heard in a while. \\"What diet are you on?\\" \\"The Autoimmune Protocol\\", I replied. I wanted to correct her use of words and tell her it's a lifestyle, not a \\"diet\\", but I could feel her internal eye roll as she silently cursed me in her mind. I think she was having a bad night, so I smiled and let it go. \\n\\nThe food this time was good for my boyfriend who got the seasonal salad, but it was only ok for me. Nothing I couldn't make myself at home for a fraction of the cost. The overhead music was great. But the service sucked, from the entry to the meal. Slow and unappreciative it seemed. It also didn't help that our dining neighbors looked like they had both just sweat out their Advocare overdoses from their post work workout. Yuck!

I'm a fan.  I've heard of Kukai Ramen & Izakaya when I briefly lived in Seattle and I didn't have a chance to try it, I was excited when I heard that they are opening a location in the Portland-Metro area.  It took me awhile to get out there because I realized that I rarely go out to Beaverton anymore.  \\n\\nWe were out in the area to check out the Beaverton Night Market only to discover that it was a disaster so we decided to bail and go for some ramen.  There was wait, about 20 minutes or so, and they would seat us unless our whole party was there--our last person was about five minutes away.  Service was very quick and efficient.  Someone came to bring us water and took drink orders when sat down.  Then returned with the drinks and took our food order.  We ordered an appetizer and a bowl of ramen.  I settled on the Chicken Kara'age and Garlic Tonkotsu Ramen.\\n\\nNot a huge fan of Takoyaki, maybe I've only had really poorly prepared Takoyaki in the past so I get turned off by it.  My friends insisted it was good there and had ordered it for everyone to try.  Surprisingly, it was pretty tasty--I think the key is not to overpower it with so much mayo and Bonito flakes.  Other appetizers we shared was the chicken kara'age, fried chicken wings and Tempura.  The chicken wings was the best, good overall flavor, crunchy on the outside and moist on the inside.  I preferred it over the chicken kara'age.  The tempura was standard, nothing special.  I think we ordered too many appetizers because I couldn't finish my ramen.  The broth was garlicky and tasty, the noodle had a bite to it, and the egg...oh my god, the egg.  It was perfect, soft-boiled correctly and rich in flavor--almost like the boiled/poached it in soy-based liquid.  \\n\\nI was so full that I don't know if I appreciated the ramen, it got daunting trying to finish it and I left half of uneaten.  I need to come back and have just the ramen so that I could finish a bowl and be able to hold it in high regards."},{"name":"Cantina Laredo","address":"1680 29th St","city":"Boulder","stars":"3.5","text":"Service sucked butt and the restaurant wasn't even busy.

On a group level, however, the experience probably ranks closer to a four. The dishes I ordered, save from the deliciously gamey lamb tartare I had to start, were pretty underwhelming. My duck entree was comprised of maybe five or six thin strips of duck breast drenched in a lavender jus--tasty to be sure, but not remotely filling. The caramel almond tart was a complete misnomer, as it barely contained either of those ingredients. Instead, what I received was a chocolate tart with caramelized sugar crystals jutting out and a sprinkle of almond dust on the side. Not satisfying. To top it off, the yogurt sorbet that accompanied it was rather bland and far too icy for my liking.\\n\\nAs I said, the experience I had as part of a group was much better. I went with Andrea B. and her family to celebrate her birthday, and the restaurant was wonderfully accommodating, seating us in a large private room overlooking Boylston and the Public Gardens.

I even made a joke that she must have studied the night before to give us recommendations and talk about the menu. Food: appetizer of calamari was bomb. I ordered Mac n cheese, and it was HUGE and delicious. \\n\\nOne star: tab time. We asked for separate checks and to just split the wine and appetizer 3 ways. We get our bill and there's a mysterious 1/9 bottle of wine charge, in addition to the bottles of wine we had ordered. We inquired about this, and was told by the waitress that she messed up and would have to have the manager fix it. The manager comes out and tells us that he can't delete the wine off because of their system, but that we could adjust our tip accordingly to make up for the extra charge. We said we didn't want to do that because she was awesome and well, rude. He finds out it's my bday dinner and tells me he'll take the dessert off the tab since it's my birthday and that he'll re-run our tabs. Awesome - wasn't expecting that, and was super appreciative that he did that. Comes back out and the tabs have become super weird and he's figured out what we should each pay with a 20% tip. I looked at my tab and was super confused how I was paying way more than what I had even ordered and then giving a tip off that, so I asked and showed him the original bill and tried to explain to him that all I should pay was what I had ordered. Unfortunately, he didn't want to listen to anything I had to say or wanting to understand and he kept talking over me and asking me to listen to him. Finally, my friend stopped him and said that he was being rude and that he wasn't providing very good service to us. I think this made him flustered, and I honestly don't think he meant to come across that way, cuz his attitude changed immediately. He apologized and then said he'd comp us the bottle of wine as well, and then came back with the tab. I wish I could say that this fixed everything, but the tabs were still messed up and I ended up just paying what I was going to originally pay because I was so frustrated and embarrassed that I had to argue with the manager about what we were being charged.

I ordered the kobe beef burger with sliced angus beef and my brother had the classic pepper beef with egg on top. The sauce that came with my dish tasted really well but without the sauce or just the use of the standard sauce that were provided didn't add much depth to the dish. My brother's dish, on the other hand, tasted pretty good with the standard garlic sauce. But it didn't cook for as long as I hoped it would. At the start, the food was too hot to eat so I had to wait a while and later on it just got too cold. Compared to Hong Kong, my dish was kept warm throughout my entire meal.

I've stayed in other JW Marriott hotels across the country and this one just didn't have that comfortable feel to it. I'll discuss that part later but first let me talk about check in. Marriott has an app that you can download on your phone that allows you to check in, via the app. So after checking in, I received notifications thru the app stating: YOUR ROOM IS READY but each time, I'd go to the desk and the staff there would tell me that there were no rooms available despite me showing them the phone notification. After about the 4th notification, I FINALLY got into a room and the room had a funky smell like wet carpet AND there was mold on the curtains. My stay was costing me over $700 for a few days so there was no way I was going to accept that. I asked for a new room and the second room had exactly the same issue! WTH?!! I was thinking that maybe guests were leaving their windows open during a rainfall because, otherwise, why would the curtains have mold?  But anywho, I marched my butt back down to the front desk to express my dismay and was given yet another room. This time, the room was better but there was a problem with the air conditioner. The room seemed quite warm when we entered. We lowered the thermostat and headed out to the pool. I saw a maintenance woman in the hall on the way down and told her about the problem. She promised to take care of it but never did. We really just wanted to try to enjoy our stay so I didn't make a big deal. I just wanted to get to that pool. After returning to the room later that day and noticing the room was super warm, and then sleeping that first night in the heat, I called down again. Maintenance arrived as we were leaving for dinner the NEXT NIGHT so we left them there to do the repairs with hopes that it would be cooler when we returned from dinner. When we returned, the room was definitely cooler BUT whatever they did, caused dirt to fly out of the vents. The beds were now layered with visible dirt or dust. It was all over the furniture, inside of my luggage and all over the floor. It was a MESS! So I wiped down as much as I could because we were tired and I didn't feel like dealing with it at the time. Also, during our stay there was a problem with the water from the tap. It turned brown for some reason. So when you turned on the faucet for the sink and tub, light brown (like watered down tea) came out and the water in the toilet looked that way too but for some strange reason, no one told US anything but apparently, everyone else received notices under their door and bottles of clean water. Not sure how or why we were left out of being notified. My sister was also staying in a different room and she is the one that told us after I mentioned that the water in our room looked gross. I went to the front desk to see if I could get clean water as well. The young man apologized and gave me 2 bottles of water. Definitely not enough for a family of 3 for drinking and brushing teeth but ok! Our room had a balcony but the balcony was so small. It didn't feel safe and secure enough to hold our weight and we are just average sized adults (I'm sure it was safe but I'm tall and so is my husband so It just felt weird standing there) so I didn't get to enjoy it. I did ask if there were larger balconies available. It didn't need it to be large though, a standard sized balcony would have been fine. This is definitely not a standard balcony...I'd say probably half the size. One step out and you were already at the rail. The woman at the desk notified me that they do not have any other type of balcony so it almost felt ridiculous that we paid for the upgraded room with balcony and we didn't get to enjoy it but yeah! Overall, the room was very standard. For what they charge, I think upgrades are needed for some of the rooms. The beds were ok, but maybe mine was a little old because it was not nearly as comfortable as the beds I'd slept in at other JW's or Ritz hotels. Upon check out, I discussed my concerns with mainly all the dirt left behind by maintenance as well as the water issue. The woman listened with a blank stare, apologized in a robotic tone and smile and then said she would issue a $50 credit towards my bill and since we had spent so much at the pool for lunch each day, I was happy to accept that . This just was not a very pleasant stay though the property itself has the potential to be great, they fell short with us. I won't count it out because the pool here is fabulous and mainly because of their lazy river. I love Marriott hotels and I am a rewards member for several years now. This is one of maybe 4 or 5 Marriott hotels I've stayed in while visiting Orlando. Orlando World Center, also a nice pool, had customer service issues as well.

We also really enjoyed a fish and coconut dish that is best described as a supercharged version of \\"typical\\" Thai food.  We didn't particularly like their take on mango salad with crab and found the fish sauce off putting.

Say what you want about Guy Fieri, but a lot of the places he features on his show are places doing good food the right way, and The Meatball Stoppe is no exception.\\n\\nLocated in a strip mall, about 15 minutes outside of the Universal Studios area, when you walk in you can tell right away that this is a family run establishment. Dripping with charm, we were seated by two incredibly friendly waitresses. \\n\\nOur waitress, Jessie, was a delight from start to finish. She asked where we were visiting from, walked us through the menu, and even made sure we were enjoying our baked mozzarella the right way (we don't dip, we scoop!), and as an admitted soft drink vacuum, she made sure my cup was never empty. She gave honest and helpful reviews of which dishes she liked best and made an already amazing experience that much better. Jeff & Isabella, if you're reading this, you made a great decision hiring her.\\n\\nAtmosphere and service out of the way, let's move onto the most important part: the food. For starters, we had Baked Mozzarella. The mozzarella was fresh, the sauce it was served in had a little bit of heat and wasn't too sweet (which I hate) and the crostini served with it were toasted perfectly. My girlfriend and I devoured it and we were both close to licking the crock it was served in clean.\\n\\nFor our entree's I had the penne pasta with spicy pork sauce, and my girlfriend ordered the Meatball Trio, which is three meatballs of your choice (out of the 13[!!!] available options), served with a side (she chose the white bean ragu), and a side salad (we told them to not bring the salad.. we were on vacation, after all!). The meatballs she chose were the Vegetarian, Nonna's Traditional, and Spicy Pork. The Nonna's Traditional was one of the best meatballs I have ever had. It was light, and flavorful, and had an amazing texture. The Spicy Pork was just that: very spicy, and very porky, which also means it was very delicious! My girlfriends favorite though, bar none, was the Vegetarian \\"meat\\"ball. She did not know what the ball was made of at the time, and loved it. She loved the whole meal and was a proud member of the clean plate club, but she said the Vegetarian was the shining star of the meal (I'm sure she'll write her own review soon enough). It was only after the fact that she found out it's made using mushrooms... and she HATES mushrooms! So congratulations The Meatball Stoppe, you got my girlfriend to not only eat mushrooms, but to love them as well... at least in that dish!\\n\\nMy penne pasta was cooked perfectly, and the Spicy Park sauce was so. Freaking. Good. I love spicy things, even though I have almost no tolerance for spice, but I was so addicted to the taste and the burn that I couldn't stop going back for more. I would wash the floors there just for Isabella's recipe. \\n\\nWith a flight to catch, we grabbed some desserts to go (again with Jessie's guidance), and hit the road. I can't speak to the desserts since I'm not a dessert guy, but my girlfriend must have enjoyed them because they didn't even make it onto the plane (because they were eaten).\\n\\nSo that's it for The Meatball Stoppe! Amazing service, amazing vibe, amazing food. Do yourself a favor and get your butt over there. And if you're able to get that Spicy Pork Sauce recipe for the love of all that's good please let me know!!"},{"name":"Pok Pok","address":"3226 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Oh man Pok Pok.

The new place looks neater than the old, but service is just as pathetic. The owner has hired a few waitresses, but it took about half an hour after we entered the restaurant for someone to take our order. It looked like 1 waitress was only hired to fill water glasses, she asked us 2 times if we wanted to drink water before the order was even taken. The owner looked busy walking around the restaurant and 15 min later, guess what, the owner was taking our order! What the hell were the waiters there for?  The food arrived another 1/2 hour later. Again, the order in which it arrived was messed up. Let's get this straight, if you claim to serve Indian food, serve it in the way Indians eat! The curries (with a side of rice) came out first, the starters came 10 min later, the naan another 10 min later, when the curries had gone cold. When we complained to the waitress who served us the food in the wrong order, we got a dose from the owner saying \\"if you have any complaints, please talk to me, the owner. My staff gets upset when people complain, you have a problem with the naan, let me give them for free, I'll not charge you for it\\". Yeah right, even if you were giving away free naan, I wouldn't eat it with cold curry! \\nThe menu has a \\"when available\\" section, which includes fresh rotis, which is the basic Indian bread, (naan is not what Indians eat on a daily basis), but rotis are pretty much never available at the restaurant. \\nSo, a tip to all other Indians who love authentic Indian food, call in and order a take out of curries, go home, make rotis (which you can probably do faster than this restaurant), reheat the curries and enjoy the the food in the warmth of your home, without the cold comments of some bratty owner to bother you. \\nA tip to the owner: hire a few more chefs, instead of waiters who just serve water, revisit your menu to include more vegetarian starter options, bring out food in the right order- \\"starters first, then the main course\\", that includes naan. Do not bring out the naan in place of dessert, when the curries are cold and almost all gone, because we were so hungry we ate it all up with the rice. Make rotis more frequently available, trust me, any Indian would pick rotis over naan."},{"name":"Moonshine Patio Bar & Grill","address":"303 Red River St","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"I took a group of people here for a work dinner.

Anyway, that isn't my particular reason for downgrade this time. On my most recent visit, we were told 20 minute wait for a table. After 30 minutes we were told there were still a few tables ahead of us, so I quickly did some shopping at TJ's, got my parking validated by them, went and reparked the car. 30 minutes after the first 30 minutes of waiting we were the only two people waiting in the lobby area, so we inquired again (mind you, the hostess stand had our number to text updates, too). \\"You're next on the list.\\" Another 20 minutes, people coming and going, still no sign of being seated. Finally, after almost 90 minutes of waiting we were so hungry we decided to just eat at the Whole Foods hot bar. We told the THREE hostesses we were leaving, and got our parking validated. They said \\"Oh, are you Kat? Your table has been ready for 30 minutes!\\" I'm sorry...but how, with three employees performing the same job function of standing around a podium and coordinating seating, and only one couple in the waiting area, did you not think that maybe we were the party of two waiting to be seated?

(I guess eating with the elderly pays off!) \\n\\nWe started with drinks, they have an odd assortment of beers & the bar has some pretty awesome drinks. I got the House made Butterscotch. Its a hot drink. It made my tummy nice and warm.. did I mention it was cold & rainy out?\\n\\nWhen ready to order I had to go for the fish sauce wings. Eveyone said they were awesome, so, like a lemming, I went for it. (SCORE!) Yummy can't cover it. Devine still isn't good enough. It was like heaven...in my mouth. My partner in crime went for the boar collar (piggy is so tastey!) And did the happy dance at the table. Spicy and oh so awesome. Our friend got a ramen-esq dish and something with sausage, both were to into their meal to say much till they were done. HIGH FIVE POK POK!\\n\\nSo you're wondering, why the 3 stars? Totally on pricing. My 6 wings were 12.00. They were good and all but wings for 12 bucks? Seems a little high to me. Its a pricy joint for \\"street\\" food.

Left to decide with the note \\"I'll go get you some bread\\" my decision process was relatively straight forward as I the two items most raved were on the standard daily menu - though I must admit the daily Johnny Cake dish and the lobster with uni stuffing sounded delectable.  With my order in mind it was at this point that I became aware of something, however - the folks at the bar were cheering loudly as the Red Sox had apparently just gone up by four in the game...the game I was supposed to be going to in about two hours...the game that had (unbeknownst to me) been rescheduled to a 1:05pm start due to the Bruins.\\n\\nWith Jillian returning to the table with bread as promised and confirming that the game had indeed been rescheduled I explained my predicament to which she was sympathetic stating she'd understand if I wanted to run and see if I could at least use my ticket to get in and see the stadium, but with the game now in the 8th inning I decided to call it a loss and stay; I could always do one of the Fenway tours the following day.  A bit disheartened my order was placed and with that Jillian promised to bring \\"milk and cookies on the house\\" as a consolation prize and left me with bread - a basket of pillowy Honey whole wheat paired with salted almond honey butter that was nearly the flavor of sweetened peanut butter and just as creamy - the best table bread of the trip.\\n\\nWith the kitchen upstairs and orders starting to appear for other tables in the restaurant I sat and listened to the light overhead music while checking for missed e-mails about the game's time change on my phone but my browse was interrupted in less than ten minutes when Jillian returned with my appetizer course of Local Clam Chowder with Hand Dug Clams, Buttermilk Biscuit, and House Cured Bacon.  Served piping hot and of medium thickness this creamy potage was everything Neptune's was not - briny yet balanced, smoky yet subtle, and absolutely chock full of clams and less-so with potatoes.  Decorated with three buttery ping-pong ball sized biscuits as opposed to generic oyster crackers this was a soup worthy of its $10 price tag and I was glad to have bread with which to soak up every bit of it.\\n\\nWith the soup sopped it was at this point that the bar groaned according to my phone the Sox had miraculously managed to give up four in the top of the 9th and the game was headed to the bottom of the ninth and for the first time I thought to myself that maybe, just maybe there was a chance I might luck out and as good fortune would have it my main course arrived just as the game headed to extra innings.  Having heard great things about ICOB's Lobster Roe Noodles but somewhat skeptical given my cynicism for beef I'd decided to take the chance for two reasons - one was that my dining partners the day prior didn't even remember short rib being included in the dish and the second was that both Jillian and one of the guys at the table across the way stated \\"you can barely taste it\\" and although they were wrong in that regard as I certainly coul taste it, the piled high plate was very impressive.\\n\\nTitled officially as \\"Lobster Roe Noodles with Grilled Lobster, Braised Short Rib, Pecorino, Chanterelle Mushrooms\\" and featuring each ingredient in plethora plus green peas the star of this dish was most certainly the house made noodles - briny and smooth, perfectly al dente and the very flavor of lobster roe - yet at the same time, the flavorful amalgam topping the noodles was not far behind in the flavor department with notes of sweet, savory, ocean, and earth all competing equally for palate space.  With the lobster snappy, the short rib melting in the mouth, and the sauce somewhere between butter and smoky pan jus there was really nothing left to be desired and although pricey at $27 this was the sort of dish that could have easily served two as a lighter meal.\\n\\nWith two outs in the bottom of the 10th and the game still tied Jillian arrived at my table to collect my empty plate and asked if I was still interested in dessert - a difficult call as everything had been so excellent, but an option on which I deferred first of all because of the game, but also for the sake of my 9:00pm reservation at O-Ya.  With the bill settled and a hefty tip left for the great service I made my way to the street and part jogging headed for the stadium where I would not only get in but would also watch one inning from the 6th row behind home plate and the next two from the top of the Green Monster until JD Drew ended it with a single to score Crawford in the bottom of the 14th...the crowd went crazy, I later went to O-Ya for one of my best stateside meals in recent memory, and if I ever come back to Boston I'll most certainly return to ICOB."},{"name":"Kismet Cafe","address":"411 W 24th St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"This place is one of my favorite places to eat by UT.

The gyro meat is always seasoned well and consistent too. \\nThe deal for the gyro sandwiches is perfect on a UT student's budget. I believe its like $5.55 for a wrap and side (get the fries, they have some seasoning on it that is awesome).\\nThe dishes themselves are more authentic compared to other places I have tried.. but  if I am feeling greek, this is my spot, along with Phoenica bakery. The dishes are a little more pricey, but you get what you pay for... some tasty combinations of hummus, meat, or falafel, and a salad like fatoosh and rice, hard to beat the price, considering what you are getting.\\nThe chicken shawarma is another one of my favorites... and the dishes are quite filling, enough to possibly split plates, unless you are hungry. \\nI recommend this place over Arpeggio gril any day.

Once I bit into my first saucy wing, there was no feeling of disappointment and I understood why they are well-known for this dish. While we ordered the wings to be spicy, it was on the mild side. I was not left drenched with heat in my mouth and did not find myself constantly reaching for water. Asides from this, the sauce is sticky with a great combination of salty and sweet. The flank steak was overly priced IMO for a few thin slices. Avoid ordering the their version of the Thai Tea, it was watered down and needed more cream.\\n\\nRecommend coming to Pok Pok to atleast try their wings, everything else on their menu are not the typical Thai dishes you'll find at most restaurants since it's Thai street food.

The restaurant is literally RIGHT off of the station so it's not hard to get to.\\n\\nWAIT: Make reservations.  We made reservations about 2 weeks in advance and the only times available were 5:30pm or 9:30pm.  We took the 9:30 pm.  Thinking we might get a better time we came around 6:30 and asked how long the wait was - 2 hours.  Make sure you make reservations far in advance.\\n\\nATMOSPHERE: I loved this atmosphere.  It's what I like to call New England trendy.  You can tell it's trendy with the hanging lights in the middle, the dark ambiance, and white furniture with the New England/coastal feel to it.  Very nice for a date or birthday dinner.\\n\\nThere is seating along a window on stools and then some high tables right in the middle next to the bar and then regular booths and tables on the further end.  I think anywhere you sit will be a great experience.\\n\\nFOOD:  The food here is expensive no doubt but if you want an excuse to spoil yourself with some good food then splurge a little.  Split between the two of us, 2 dishes and oysters was enough.\\n\\nISLAND CREEK OYSTERS - Me and my boyfriend don't really like oysters, we've had it probably 2 times and they were always kind of gritty and slimy.  But hey, if you're in Boston and at a place called Island Creek Oyster Bar...you can't not get oysters.  Our server was very helpful in deciding what kind to get for newbies and he suggested the island creeks.  They came out with a cocktail sauce and another citrus-y sauce and lemon.  I just put lemon on mine and it was AMAZING.  Super fresh, not too grimy or gritty and had a nice flavor, on the salty side.  We were very impressed.\\n\\nFRIED OYSTER SLIDER - It's $4 each so we got one each and they are pretty small.  It has a brioche puffy bun and a fried oyster with a pickled radish inside.  The oyster was perfectly fried and you could barely tell it was an oyster.  The radish added that needed tang and spice to cut through the rest of the fried oyster.  It was small, but a good second dish.\\n\\nLOBSTER ROE PASTA - get this split in 2 and it's  barely enough for one person so if you order other food then you should be satisfied.  The noodles are like fettucini and orange in color.  They didn't have much flavor.  This was probably the least impressive dish.  They give you a good amount of short rib and lobster and zucchinis I believe. I was hoping it would be more bursting with flavor but it was just subtly tasty.  Almost like a light veggie and seafood pasta without much sauce.  \\n\\nOverall though, we loved this place and I was quite impressed.

They have your standard sandwiches, paninis, cookies etc. a huge selection of drinks, espressos, lattes,  any combination of syrups and caffeine that you can think of. They blow Starbucks out of the water. The main selling point is the employees, they know EVERYONE. People walk by and wave and they wave back, people come in just to say hello and grab a quick coffee and the owner whos always there knows each by name, even remembers what drinks they like. You never see old fashioned customer service like this! This is the way to run a business deep down, connecting with all the customers. They have a few coffee shops around beverly but I've only ever been to this one. It's a bit of a drive for me, so whenever I decide to go all the way here, its only for What's Brewin. They are cash only which is tough for me, but I can't complain since they have so much positive going for them.

I went to this place with my wife on our 7th anniversary because she had heard so many \\"good\\" things. We ordered 1 fried calamari app, & 2 black pastas (1 squid & clams in red sauce, the other shrimp in \\"white\\" sauce). The appetizer was good, but the pasta was awful. The squid & clams black pasta was super chewy, it was like eating a Twizzler. The shrimp black pasta was equally bad and had about a pound of garlic as well as no white sauce but rather ton of oil... It is safe to say that we did not eat the food and left it virtually untouched in the pans they came in. The nice waiter approached our table and saw that we had not touched our food and at that moment we asked for the check and he asked how come we had not eaten our food, and we told him how bad it was and he decided to change it for another type of pasta and we accepted. When the waiter told the chef what we had said and what he was doing for us, the chef started yelling that we should eat our food, and saying who doesn't like garlic, the chef came close to calling us stupid. I could not keep listening to that and got up and told the waiter I would pay for the food even though we did not eat it, it was TOO embarrassing plus our anniversary dinner was ruined! While I was talking with the waiter the chef kept yelling and I decided to pay for the entire bill and take off(again we did not eat any of our food), I was not going to listen any further to the indirect insults of the RUDE chef...

Mussels were outstanding with a light and subtle broth, which proved a perfect match to the bread!  For main courses we had the crispy Redfsh and cedar plank Salmon.  Redfish was good and solid.  Would not order again, but was not disappointed with the meal at all.  Only feedback was that the sunchoke puree it was served on was cold, which seemed odd.  The Salmon was a homerun.  But for the fact I want to try other things on the menu, I would order that every time.  Perfectly cooked (I asked for med-rare), hot and crispy in the right places, with a great subtle flavor profile.  Loved it!  For dessert we shared the Pecan French Toast.  It was perfect.

The main event didn't dissappoint. 6 generous slabs of chinese 5-spice laden pork belly over rice, noodles with stewed pork, boiled cabbage and a variant of kim-chi. Quite a spread.

The menu has expanded to serve a wider selection of vegan comfort food, including dinner entrees, dessert options, a weekend brunch menu, and many opportunities for a la carte ordering.  \\n\\nI'd skimmed Yelp reviews before going and saw that many people complained about it being hot inside-- I noticed this was definitely true!  It was just a/c-less enough that our whole table noticed we were slightly uncomfortable and sticky.  Don't skimp on the A/C, CC!\\n\\nThe lentil p√¢t√© was a light, nutty spread infused with tarragon and served with rice crackers-- we checked in on Yelp to get it for free! :)  Sandwiches range from jackfruit BBQ to Philly seitan and arrive on fresh, satisfying local bread with a gluten-free option.  (I tried my friend's cashew cheese and apple sandwich.. it was okay but nothing to write home about). \\n\\nThe cashew \\"mac 'n' cheeze\\" was very flavorful but on the dry side, and the roasted root vegetables were finely diced and underwhelming.  Garlicky greens also fell short in both flavor and texture.  Beware the bold (but tasty!) kelp noodle pad Thai, which arrived with lots of heat and no warning!  The friend I was sharing with was unable to take more than two bites of it before forfeiting! I thought it a little strange that the waitress, who was otherwise very detailed and patient with our many questions, failed to mention the heat in this dish...\\n\\nDonut holes and brownie bites are glorified descriptions for raw nut and fruit balls; opt for the cashew \\"cheezecake\\" or coconut ice cream sundae instead.  \\n\\nOverall, Counter Culture is a welcome addition to Austin's lacking vegan scene.

The interior decor was instantly recognizable and similar to Rathbun's- chic, warm, and modern using wood on walls, iron as accents, concrete from the original building structure, and dark leather chairs.  The open kitchen lets you watch the hustle and bustle of staff, and open dining room allows for great people watching.  There's also some great outdoor seating, tables and lounge-y chairs.  Our server was very attentive, with the only hiccup occurring when someone else served our entrees, and mixed them up.  \\n\\nI started with a glass of cabernet that paired well with my enitre meal- my appetizer was an excellent ahi tuna poke- just enough sesame and soy (I abstained from the wasabi mayo).  My entree was lamb porterhouse medallions with creamy polenta...the lamb was excellent, but I wasn't as much of a fan of the mint jelly glop that came with it.  The polenta was a little congealed, but it was tasty.  My dessert was delicious- a simple banana pudding with toffee and pecan crunch- the best part was the sliced bananas lining the bottom of the cup.

This review is for the restaurant. I'll start by saying that the other Yelp reviews are very accurate, though occasionally a bit harsh. If you're looking to get a good idea of what to expect, you can trust them to paint the picture. We went to Commonwealth with a reasonable sized group for dinner, and for that I'd recommend it, but I'd be a bit wary of going as a couple. The restaurant is certainly still working out some kinks. First things first, ambiance. I really liked it. I would describe it as urban chic meets Vermont farm. Lots of wood tones and dark colors, and it works well. It is bright, so not the most intimate, but still very nice. There is a solid if not overly inventive drink menu and all the drinks we had were prepared well. The beer menu has a very good select of craft beers. The food menu is much more limited. There are only about 8 entree selections. Vegetarians beware, I would look elsewhere. None of the entrees were vegetarian friendly, so you'd be limited to salads and sides. Here's the biggest thing about the menu: you basically create your own meal by picking an entree and then sides, steak house style. The problem with this is that if you're a couple or smaller party then this quickly becomes very expensive, raising an average meal price to the mid to upper thirties for a modest portion size. If you're in a group and can spread the cost of the sides around the table, things get more reasonable. With the separate entree/side approach you're also not getting the benefit of inventive food preparation, since you are basically throwing your own components together. This is fine, but if I'm going to shell out that much money for a meal, I'd like to see a bit more artistry in the food. That said, everything we had was very well prepared. Simple crafted fare, well cooked meats, delicious vegetables, mac and cheese, steak frites, no bones to pick anywhere. The only food negative is the dessert menu. Yes, it looks good on paper. Yet if you could mess up what is essentially an ice cream sundae bar, they've done it. $5 will get you not even a dixie cup of ice cream, plus an additional $2 for each and every topping. Without exaggeration I have never been more disappointed at the cost/quality ratio for an item ordered at a restaurant. Our entire table just laughed at it. I wish I had a photo, but since it was gone in three bites there wasn't much time. Finally, service is friendly but a little amateurish still. I think they will work this out, it looks like they have a good crew and everyone was trying hard, they're probably just a little green.\\n\\nSo, bottom line: good for groups, pricey for couples. Solid if not overly inventive food. Vegetarians beware. Avoid dessert."},{"name":"Rocking Frog Cafe","address":"2511 SE Belmont St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Great atmosphere, amazing donuts, good coffee.

We were lucky enough to arrive in time for the first seating, 5 tables, with three parties sitting at one large table. My party was sitting at a separate table.

The woman delivered all of the appetizers, but only after chatting a while with one specific table...except she delivered our appetizer to the table next to us, another party of 3 Asians. I figured it was an honest mistake and after a while, we managed to flag her down and tell her that while that other table didn't order the calamari, we did. It was pretty good.\\n\\nThe chef next cooked all of the entrees. We ordered a large order of the pasta, and she delivered us a small bowl. After some effort, we flagged her down to ask if this was the large size. She told us wait a minute, and after a while, she took it away and put it at the other table. Apparently in a restaurant of 5 tables, and 7 parties, she kept mixing up our two parties! It was frustrating, because between each mixup, she would take forever to come back and find out she made a mistake, and then take more time to fix the mistake. The other two diners found the aglio oglio pasta not well mixed, in that some parts of it were very bland, while some parts were correctly seasoned.\\n\\nShe never came by to refill our water.

The soup is also good because you get to pick how spicy you want it and what ingredient you want (beef, chicken, kimchi, seafood, mushroom, or mixed).\\n\\nTheir soup yesterday was one of the best, if not best, I've had (and it usually is).\\n\\nWe also got their pancake which I (at first) thought was a bit expensive at $15; but I was wrong, it was worth it. They do a much better job cooking the pancake than other places which I've had it. The pancake exterior was crispy and perfectly browned. I'm not sure if it's the chef who was there that night who was really good or if they are typically this good. \\n\\n\\nNotes:\\n\\nWhen they bring you the soup they give you a raw egg. This is meant to be cracked into the tofu soup. \\n\\nThey will also pour some tea into a large stone bowl which has burnt rice stuck to it. This is meant to be a light after meal soup. It's something Korean's  traditionally eat. \\n\\nIf you are looking to drink. Get some Baekseju. This is a Korean alcoholic drink with a variety of herbs and ginseng that goes really well with barbecued meat."},{"name":"Maple Street Biscuit Company - Oviedo","address":"978 City Plaza Way","city":"Oviedo","stars":"4.5","text":"Here on vacation and visiting a friend we  decided to try this Hot and new spot .

Thank goodness we got there early and there were only two of us--it IS a very popular spot, as Yelp had indicated, and there was already a crowd waiting to get in. We only had to wait about 5 minutes and got seated at one of the tables by the front door. It was a little cramped and there was a draft every time people came in and out but it wasn't too bad. It was a very homey and lively place, and our waiter had quite the strong and charming Italian accent. They started us off with some very good complimentary Italian bread while we perused the menu. As soon as I spotted the rigatoni with mushroom/peas/sausage in cream sauce I knew I had to try it--I'm a sucker for mushroom/peas/meat in cream sauce dishes. My friend got the spaghetti with mushrooms and shrimp in pesto sauce after spotting it on the table next door. While we were waiting for our food we took in all the kitschy stuff over the place, especially the various soccer jerseys pinned to the ceiling--they love their soccer in here! There was also a giant replica of that statue face where you stick your hand in to see if you're telling the truth (as seen in Roman Holiday) by the bathrooms. I did not stick my hand in. The food came out pretty fast and it was really good! Perfectly al dente pasta and well-prepared sauces with fresh ingredients--very homey-tasting. The only quibble I have about my dish was that the sausage seemed a little too rich. Usually these kinds of dishes come with less bits of meat which keeps it from getting too rich and salty.

Had it been Sunday, or even 9am, I would have understood the crowd. This place was packed. Even though the 15 minute wait did not kill me, everything else was slow and delayed and it was not busy enough to justify their slip ups with our order.\\n\\nThe food was pretty good, well mine was at least, and no one in our party was terribly disappointing. It is IHOP and a chain, we did not expect a lot, we just wanted a decent and affordable and quick breakfast (it was already 11am). Honestly, they only got the decent part right. \\n\\nI was temped to do fried chicken and waffles. They had it on thier 7 for $7 menu, but I was afraid the IHOP version would ruin one of my favorite dishes. So I passed on that and decided to go with the Chicken Fajita Omelet. The waitress really mis-pronounced fa-JEEEE-ta with a thick southern accent. I did not know whether to laugh or cry.... But nevertheless, I really REALLY liked my Chicken Fajita Omelet. It was beyond decent. But the pancakes that come on the side really needed some more butter. Even though my food was beyond decent, some other people in our party had food below decent, so overall it averages out to decent.\\n\\nThe Hearty Ham & Cheese Omelet was very hearty. There was so much cheese on there it hurt my fiancee's tummy. She usually likes cheese, but in moderation. I can really over do it on the cheese and my iron stomach gives me no problems.

He liked the spicy hashbrowns and said the eggs were.... yup you guessed right, decent.\\n\\nI cannot remember what my brother's girlfriend got, but I can tell you what she thought about it.

It is so close to Disney, no surprise that it is touristy. The restaurant could have been a bit cleaner, and so could the staff. They were friendly for the most part, and like I explained above the food was decent. But the 2 stars comes from the mess ups.\\n\\nFirst, it took them forever to bring me a glass of water with the tea that I ordered. It also took them a long time to refill our coffee pot and my hot water for my tea. But the worst was that they essentially forgot my dads meal. My mom thinks a different waitress stole it for her table. Regardless, they need to be more organized especially if they are going to be that busy at 11am on a Friday. We had all pretty much finished our food by the time my dads Spicy Scrambled came to the table. That was not cool. We offered to wait for him, but he insisted that we did not let our food get cold. \\n\\nTakeaway: food is decent, service is bad. It is crowded and touristy. While a McDonald's breakfast may not taste as decent, it will be quicker and less disappointing after you waste you time for less than stellar service.

I really expected to have an amazing meal here based on prior reviews. As I mentioned, the food presentation was lovely. It had a modern upscale feel. The decor is really hip and stylish. We ordered the Chicken Pad Thai which I felt to be overly sweet to the point where I said that I felt like I was eating dessert noodles. The plate was even garnished with a small pile of white sugar along side a small pile of dried pepper flakes...odd to me.  Next was the Green Curry, usually my favorite dish...pretty much my standard, although this time I opted for beef rather than Pork. I did not care for their version of this dish at all. The beef was very chewy and the sauce had an overwhelming taste of what I believe was Kaffir lime leaves. Last, we got the Crab Fried rice. There were so many bits of shell in this dish that I started to lose my appetite pretty quickly. It was quite bothersome to keep removing them from my mouth. Service was attentive from those that delivered the food and checked in on us. Our original server who took our order was not as friendly as I would have liked. We only saw her again when she delivered the check. I should note that we were approached by the manager/owner(?) and asked if there was something wrong with our Curry as it was noticed that it was barely touched and that we did not want to take the leftovers home.  I was caught off guard, so I quickly said everything was fine and that I just didn't want to take it. In hindsight, I wish I had shared my feelings about the meal. I believe that to be a very difficult location to maintain a prosperous restaurant. I am hoping that my comments are noted and wish them well.\\n\\n**Edited to add: Very shortly after I posted this review, I received a genuinely kind response from the owner of Soi 9 apologizing for my experience and suggesting I give them another chance. That means alot to me and shows me that they care about their customers' experience in their establishment. I will definitely consider going back for another try.

My table ordered the raw oysters, fritto misto, fried oyster and octopus toast from the happy hour menu and the mussels in the regular menu.
