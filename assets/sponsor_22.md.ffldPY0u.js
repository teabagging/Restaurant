So from the moment I walk into the restaurant, they've got their work cut out for them. I don't have a problem or knock anyone for being busy and so having a wait. And it's their restaurant so they can make their own rules about reservations. But this review starts them with a 3, so the food and service better be damn good.\\n\\nUpon arriving we were promptly seated. On a good note, they seated the first two people and we ended up 7 people total. So that worked out.\\n\\nSadly, the service otherwise left something to be desired. It really was bad. Not one of us had been here before and it's not your typical restaurant. Our waiter barely explained anything in spite of us asking numerous times how it worked.\\n\\nHonestly love the concept and the food was good. But not knowing what we were doing, it was difficult. And we hardly saw a waiter or waitress during the meal, after the food was delivered.\\n\\nOne thing is that while the food was good, because the broth was quite tasty that we cooled everything in, we needed salt and longed for some sauces. Sadly, we never had any or had the chance to ask for any.\\n\\nAt the very end, when we were paying, we saw the entire table next to us, who had just arrived, get up and go over by the soft-serve ice cream and start doing something there. When we later inspected, thinking maybe there were toppings for the ice cream, we found they have a bunch of sauces! Had we known this when we sat down, this would have made a HUGE difference for our dining experience! Sadly, it was not our luck.\\n\\nFor a more than $200 meal for 2 people, we were sorely disappointed. And it wasn't the food, the place or the concept as all that was great. It was the service or, rather, the lack of it.\\n\\nAn epically amazing dining experience was utterly sabotaged by the service experience. If not for my wife's love of this type of dining/food, sadly, I would not return. Which is hard for me to say.

St, Honor√© kicks out some of the better French pastries in town.

The third to our party was me, arriving a little later, and they weren't sure if I wanted a salad, so they decided to wait until I arrived to order it. I arrived a couple minutes after 8, and walked up to the counter to order a salad, and the lady told me she had already put a couple of the items away, so I was not allowed to order one. I looked over, and literally every topping besides the salad was still at the salad bar. There was also 30 minutes left of when customers could still walk in, and two other tables of customers, one of which showed up after us. So I guess if you arrive after 8, you can't get a salad, and if that's true, I think it should be posted somewhere.

Therefore, I will not cut them any slack for the incredibly slow service. Upon walking in, not a word. No sign saying to wait for hostess or seat yourself. After a minute or so, someone was kind enough to say sit wherever you'd like. We took a seat outside.  We were one of two tables that had patrons. We waited several minutes for the waitress to come out. I asked for water and a margarita (Thursday special, don't judge me, it's always 5 o'clock somewhere!). My coworker had the pink lemonade which she said tasted more like flavored water. I didn't get my water and but she was 'kind enough' to give me a double margarita (without my asking, just realized after getting the check). The food was delivered after waiting an uncomfortable amount of time. I ordered mucho macho nachos with ground beef, and my coworker, the crab rolls. I requested a side of sour cream when I ordered, it didn't come out with the food, and still . . . No water. I asked for water and sour cream. Got the sour cream, no water. Well, I ate as much as I could with the amount of time left on my lunch hour and asked one final time for water. Bingo!!! I finally got water (several jalape√±os later).

So good but only finished half my meal as I was already full! \\n\\nTwo other friends also ordered the miso black cod and the rest ordered the NY steak w/Cajun spices. They could not get over how big the portions of fish and steaks were. One friend who goes out to fine dining a lot was shocked how much black cod she had on her plate for the price she's paying. So true because I've paid $$ for a little piece of cod sitting on a big white plate, that I ate up in literally three bites! \\n\\nOthers had ordered seafood chowder or the crab cake (to die for too) as starters and strawberry cheesecake or orange flan as dessert options also.

My husband ordered prime rib and asked specifically not to have and end piece, but was served an overcooked end piece. I ordered surf and turf, filet was overcooked and shrimp scampi was a handful of deep-fried shrimp with sauce served over a mushy rice pilaf.

Also got cocky and asked for the most expensive wine they had (to see if I'd actually like it since I usually don't like wine). It was $100 for 1 oz of wine.

I ordered a bacon, egg, and cheese on an Egg Bagel. The fact they had egg bagels made the experience even better because I have not been able to find that flavor of bagel locally in Orlando.

I pulled up Yelp and the menu seemed to meet our needs due to the fact we both had a hankering for salad. We were informed to grab a seat upon entry and were immediately provided with menus. Additionally, our drink order was taken. Aside from the regular menu, they were featuring a 2/$20 special to include an appetizer and two entr√©es. We didn't take advantage of this offer, but it certainly was appealing. In looking over the special menu, the warm pretzels caught my attention. I didn't see these on the main menu; however, I asked if we were able to order. Wowzers! These soft pretzels are served with a queso and will knock your socks off. They're also graced with butter; therefore, these are scrumptious with or without the cheese. I implore you to try with the cheese because I feel you'd be missing out otherwise. \\nMy friend opted for the Mediterranean salad with chicken for her lunch. I ordered the Caesar salad with blackened chicken. Albeit, my chicken arrived grilled. Nonetheless, it was delicious and I didn't bring the snafu to anyone's attention. The tangy dressing is what makes this Caesar so tasty and there was no shortage of croutons. My friend equally enjoyed her salad and was unable to finish it as the portion was vast. For beverages, she enjoyed a Shock Top on draft and I had an iced tea. The tea was fresh brewed and my glass was never empty. Our server Laura did a great job taking care of us.

Let's begin at the very beginning. \\nI made reservations thru OpenTables as we were celebrating our 25th anniversary. \\nWe get to the hostess & she asked high or short table, since my spouse has knee issues w/a major limp I requested a short table, the hostess rolled her eyes and told the other girl, \\"take 'em upstairs\\". As we followed her we thought she was going to offer the elevator which made more sense then taking 2-flights of stairs but she was in a rush & actually made it upstairs about 2 mins before us, at this point she looked frustrated having to wait for the disable. \\nThen, she gives us the 1st table by the stairs which felt claustrophobic & kinda dangerous, one wrong move & you may just find yourself free-falling down a flight.

In a 2 hour period our water glass remained empty a few times, at this rate I'm thinking perhaps they should leave a jug on the tables or use bigger/taller water glasses.

It took them over an hour half just to bring out food, but the food they brought out was for the two other friends. On top of that, they had gotten the wrong flavors for the wings that they order and told waitress that but nothing was done. Birthday boy and his girlfriend still didn't get their food yet. We asked for the manager to complain, then we had to wait another 30 minutes for him. We had three of us all asked for him at different times and finally one of our friends went towards the kitchen and just waited to complain for the manager since he wasn't showing up to our table. Manager came by to apologized and compensated the meal for the birthday couple. All of us gotten 15% taken off from our meal. We had to wait a bit just for the check as well and some of us had gotten wrong orders on our checks. It literally took us three hours just to leave and most of our time had been spent their waiting.

Definitely be prepared with your food choices prior to getting in line to order. Using a relatively friendly computer kiosk, you place your order and walk away with a table number. The window seating looks out onto the SW 3rd Street with some communal seating on the outside patio. Food was prepared and delivered to our window seating quickly. We shared a sampling, opting for yuzu rattan. The broth was hearty and the noodles fresh...delicious. The kaarage we ordered was fried nicely and was moist, side sauce didn't do the kaarage justice though. The star of the meal was for sure the spicy chicken bun. The bao roll was perfectly steamed, the chicken was crispy with a perfectly matched spicy chili sauce and a little bit of cucumber for balance. I was still thinking about and wishing I bought an extra for later at home. Mixed drinks, sake, wine, and beer are available. I enjoyed washing it all down with a cold bottle of Pellegrino sparkling water. Nice quality utensils and table settings. The restaurant was clean, especially for how much traffic is moving through.

I ended up getting one scoop of thin mint, which had pieces of oreo cookie pieces, in a waffle cone and holy moly, I don't know what they put in their ice cream but it was incredible. This was also on a hot, Texas day where the 'Real Feel' was over 100 degrees fahrenheit and I had just finished a workout with a lot of front squats, heavy deadlifts and hip thrusts so to say the least, I needed some ice cream.

We mistakenly thought it was open at 11am, so arrived just then to be told it doesn't open until 11:30, so walked around a few blocks to kill time, then were right back at 11:30 to be the first customers of the day.  \\n\\nWe took a 2-seater table outside on the patio in the sun, but then they opened the big awning to provide shade for the tables as it was actually getting too warm in the sun.  Never thought I'd say that in May, but true!  Anyway, the outside is mainly four-seaters, with some six-seaters, with the whole seating section wrapping around the corner of the restaurant in a cozy courtyard style between brick office buildings.  Standard black metallic tables.  Some flower beds.  When you go indoors, there's a large front dining section of tables and booths of brown, with a large celebrity mural painting on one wall, high ceilings, overall casual atmosphere.  By the time we left around 1:00, the patio and this dining section were totally full and it was a bit loud with all the conversations going on, to the point I don't know if music was playing or not. There's a third back dining room but nobody was in it, so guess they seat people at the front first and then work their way back.\\n\\nFriendly service.  Staff definitely kept busy with the lunch crowd.\\n\\nI tried the Local Organic Vegetarian Black Bean Burger (Slow Tractor Farm Black Beans, Pepper Jack Cheese, Roasted Garlic & Jalapeno Mayo. $11) which was very good.  The only downfall I guess would be that it was a plain white bun and guess there isn't an option for whole wheat or any other variety.  The patty was thick and soft with some whole beans visible.  Good fries.  Very filling.  My partner had the Cubano (Honey Chipotle Roast Pork Loin, Swiss, Hop Mustard. $10) which looked a tad on the small side to me, but I think that's just because places are making food items larger all the time, so this was actually closer to a proper portion size, and fine for the price.  He enjoyed.  The fries were good.\\n\\nI am not a huge beer lover but liked the Tall Tale pale ale.  Ordered the 9oz to be safe in case I didn't like it, but the bartender poured a pint out of habit, so I got the next size up for the price of the small.  :)  Followed it with a glass of pinot grigio though because all beer I find too filling and gassy with meals, especially in the sun, and I needed to maintain my energy for other afternoon outings.\\n\\nThe only thing we really found odd was that they don't accept debit/Interac?  Is this normal in Boston?  Or the US?  In Canada, we all use debit for 99% of our purchases and they have the portable hand machines, so you rarely even have to go to a cash register on your way out.  We were lucky to have a back-up credit card.\\n\\nDefinitely would go back and I'd like to try the spinach risotto or mushroom pizza."},{"name":"Lure","address":"1106 Crescent Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"We came here on a Saturday night and made a reservation in advance which worked out well since the restaurant was pretty packed. There is valet parking for the restaurant which costs $4, and there is also limited metered street parking. The restaurant itself has dim lighting with wooden decor so it has some nice vibe to it. As we were seated, our server came by and asked for our drink orders as well as provided highlights of the menu. \\n\\nWe decided to ordered several appetizers to share so we could try out as much as we could of the menu. This is what we ordered:\\n\\nRaw Oysters on the Half-Shell: They had 5 selections of different kinds of oysters ranging from a little over $2 to almost $3.50 each. Our server described each type of oyster so we could decide what to order. We ended up trying 3 different kinds but they were all really fresh while being accompanied by lemon, cocktail sauce, and horseradish.\\n\\nSteamed Mussels - This was a bowl of mussels in a wine-based garlic sauce that came with some crunchy bread to dip. The mussels themselves were a little small but were very fresh just like the oysters. We enjoyed the broth that was used which had great flavor.\\n\\nBaked Crab Dip - Best item of the night. I can't even describe how smooth and delicious this dip was because it just pretty much melted away in our mouths. This came with small pieces of bread to dip with and had a rich tomato based flavor.\\n\\nAs for my entree, I decided to order the grilled swordfish which was hearty but I think it was my first time having swordfish which I don't think I am a big fan of. Nonetheless, it tasted fine and had some tasty farro and charred corn on the side.

I have brought all my friends to CC's (our exclusive nickname for it) and they have all walked away stuffed and hooked to the point where they will text me asking me what to order the next time they are there with friends of their own (yes spread the gospel my CC minions).\\n\\nAlthough Canton Cooks II is a little more spacious then the older one, the atmosphere is one you would find in any other standard Chinese restaurant. Nothing special but there is some kind of hidden charm I find whenever I walk through those double doors to the sweet aroma of my ancestors. It's like they don't care about looking pretty or fancy and just let their food to do the talking. \\n\\nAnd speaking of the food, it simply is the BEST Chinese food in Atlanta. The best way to enjoy a fine establishment of this sort is to bring 6-8 people and order a bunch of dishes and just share it all. You get to taste a wider array of flavors and also end up paying much less than if you were to go with one other person and only order 2-3 dishes. \\n\\nMe and my crew's delicious CC's adventure begins with a couple orders of the fried crab rangoon. Ughhh so freaking good with the sweet and sour sauce all over my body, I mean on the rangoons :/ ..... They come out fresh out of the fryer bearing little pieces of hot cream cheese and delectable chunks of crab meat in them. Then we get a couple bowls of the Wonton Noodle Soup. Hands down the BEST you will find anywhere (make sure to add some of dat chilli sauce for you spicy lovers out there). \\n\\nThen out come the entrees. Salt and Peppa squid is clutch. So good. Sometimes we order it extra crispy. Another go-to-dish is the pan-fried crispy noodles. You can get it with chicken, beef, seafood, or house. I prefer the house because you get a little bit of everything. When we can afford it we go with the Seabass. It's AMAZING. Fried or steamed, it's to die for. Make sure to pour some of the sauce it comes in over your rice :D The bbq duck, general tsao's chicken, fried pork chops, and mongolian beef are all classics too. Can't go wrong with any of them. \\n\\nIf you crave some exceptional Chinese eats then you need to do yourself a big favor and go to Canton Cooks II.

There is a large entry area with the hostess stand and I enjoyed a pineapple mojito while I waited for my friend to arrive.  We met the manager and talked for a few.  My friend arrived and she got a pineapple mojito, as well and then we were escorted to our booth.  The booths were quite roomy and the entire dining area was spacious.  Noise was minimal, although we were there after the dinner rush, I believe.  Service was on point.  I ordered the Jumbo Lump Crab Cakes, which sat on a bed of creamy polenta, wilted spinach, and topped with spicy remoulade.  Crab cakes were creamy, yet were perfectly browned on top and bottom.  Polenta was cooked perfectly and paired well as a base for the crab cakes.  The remoulade was spicier than I anticipated, but not unbearable. My husband got the Best Ever Burger, which is a blend of chuck, short rib, and brisket topped with bacon jam, dijonnaise, white cheddar, lettuce, and tomato.  Huge burger with great flavor.  He paired it with french fries.  My friend ordered the Shrimp and Scallop Risotto, pan seared with pancetta, fennel, and asparagus on a bed of cauliflower \\"risotto\\" and sun dried tomato pesto.

I watched one woman scraping food off her fingers back into a bin of food (not sure what it was on her hand or what the food was in the warming bin, but eww.) The food I got was barely warm and the refried beans were as thick as two day old mud and had no flavor at all. The best part of the whole meal was the tortillas, and those are really hard to screw up. The girl working the register at the drive through took my card and walked away with it. She didn't bring it back until I got my food, which took several minutes once I was finally acknowledged (not sure why because all they had to do was spoon it into a to go container).

I love the open layout, and have enjoyed it ever since, particularly the Newsfeed Cafe.\\n\\nAt the same time, while I get that the library has (understandably valid) rules against eating in the main areas, the rules against outside food elsewhere are both ambiguous and unevenly enforced. Today, during a full day of studying, I needed a break to eat lunch (a salad that I had admittedly purchased elsewhere). Because there are never enough seats or places to eat to begin with, I found an open spot at the end of a long table in the Cafe to quickly eat said salad. Out of nowhere, I was swiftly approached by a manager (the infamous Karen other reviewers speak of) and was very rudely \\"reminded\\" of the \\"no outside food\\" policy, and was told to leave. Now, it would have been reasonable if she spoke to me politely, but this woman came at me with one of the most condescending, cavalier attitudes I have ever seen in customer service.  Not only that, she spoke to me in a way that made me feel embarrassed in front of a large crowd of people given her unnecessarily nasty tone. There is no reason to speak to me like a child. I was so in shock I didn't know what to say.\\n\\nI have been coming to this library regularly for years, and have been nothing but a decent patron (a patron who in that time has spent literally hundreds of dollars on food and drink alone at Newsfeed).

The kitchen closes at 3 though - a potential downside for some like myself who study late. There are bagels and pastries that are for sale until they run out so get there early if you only eat a certain type of bagel. The seating is plentiful, although it fills up quickly and at all times. I love that there is outdoor seating which is perfect for chatting and sunny days. The biggest downside to Stauf's in my opinion is the shape of the coffeeshop itself. It's an old building and although they made some repairs, I would like to see updated bathrooms and floors.

Strong, but not tasting quite as strong as they must have been... This place apparently prides itself on the margaritas, and, judging from the sip I tried, they certainly were good, but anyone can do a margarita - the caipirinha takes a little more skill...\\n\\nAppetizers were good and reasonably priced - dinner entrees were a little too upscale for us that evening, but certainly looked delicious as they went by ($15-20 range - I had to give this place 4 stars as the appetizers were good and entrees looked good, but since I didn't try them, I wouldn't want to up anyone's expectations too high...).\\n\\nThe atmosphere friendly, the waitstaff entertaining (though our waiter did have a snake-skin belt that looked more snake than belt - slightly creepy, but cool. but creepy). The patio was gorgeous, for a Colorado summer evening. The lamps, bar and table settings were trendy in a hip nuevo Latino way. It would be a great place to impress a date. I would happily go again.

Brightly decorated, is exactly what it needs to be: a great lunch spot to get something fun yet comfortable.. Something different enough from your own lunch routine to keep you coming back regularly enough to see what's new.

My wife was pleased they had a vegan option. So, she ordered the Vegan 101. \\n\\nThe blackberry melt was good. But great. But good enough that I want to try more. I think I was expecting the same level of excitement I had at the Redlight yelp event. So, I was a bit disappointed. My wife didn't really enjoy her sandwich.

It has a very fast casual feel, as you order at the counter and your food is brought out to you. \\n\\nMy first visit was 3-4 years ago. A friend in Columbus recommended it so we stopped in for a burger. While I don't remember a ton of the details of that trip, I remember that we sat down right away and that the food was very high quality. I remember thinking it was a tad expensive, but worth it for the great quality food. \\n\\nMy most recent visit was a little crazier than the first, and obviously more memorable since it was just last weekend. Walking in we didn't see the menu. It turns out that they're posted on the wall just inside the door, but the entry way was so crowded that we didn't see them past the sea of people. One of our friends nabbed a couple for us to quickly review before ordering, and we were shocked at the prices. I got two eggs, two sausage patties and a biscuit for $13. That didn't sound like enough food for me so I added a strawberry smoothie for another $6. Adding the smoothie ensured I left full, but if my dad had been there he would've left hungry and upset at the prices.\\n\\nWe were there around 10:30am on a Saturday and we were super lucky to get seats almost right away. A couple left a table and we were the first to nab it up. While we were there we saw several people standing and waiting, and watched the line to order form out the door.\\n\\nObviously the food here is great, otherwise it wouldn't attract this kind of traffic. My eggs tasted like butter. The sausage was good but very rich - a lot of seasoning. The biscuit with Michigan cherry jam was definitely the best part of the meal. My husband also got the Cowboy breakfast but with poached eggs and bacon (instead of my over medium and sausage), and he agreed the biscuit was the best part. \\n\\nI really struggled with deciding on a star rating for Northstar. I think I would visit again, but probably not for breakfast. The food is good but I just can't wrap my head around these prices. I'm sure there are other amazing breakfast options in this area, so if breakfast is what you're looking for keep looking!"},{"name":"Chipotle Mexican Grill","address":"11513 Regency Village Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"2","text":"Very disappointed , put my order in via Chipotle  app for first time delivery , food order description was correct on app and also on receipt but order was still  made wrong !

Because this place is so popular and they have limited seating, we had to wait about 30 minutes to be seated. We also had to split our group up into 3 and 4 because the wait for a large-enough table would have been more than an hour and a half. The waitress did ask a different recently-seated table if they would move so that our group could sit next to each other, which was really nice on both the staff's and the customer's parts.\\n\\nWe all ordered the all-you-can-eat dinner and chose to go with the full spicy broth. The broth is very oily and very heavily flavored, which we enjoyed, because it kept its flavor for the full duration of our meal. During our two rounds of food, we ordered beef, lamb, pork, fish, meatballs, calamari, mussels, shrimp, various vegetables, and much more. Our table of 4 ordered ~70 servings total of ingredients. A few that stood out were the meatballs with fish roe (very flavorful and interesting texture) , lamb (we really liked the texture and gamey flavor), tong ho (kind of like Chinese celery; really interesting taste), various mushrooms, and the pork belly (thinly sliced and melt-in-your-mouth tender). Everything was fresh and beautifully prepared, and the waitstaff came regularly with water and broth refills if needed. \\n\\nTo maximize your experience, I recommend avoiding ordering too much of the \\"filler foods\\" like fried chicken, tofu, rice, and noodles. The meat is where it's at. We maxed out at the second round (out of three total), but made the most of each round with 4 or 8 servings of various ingredients. We topped off the night with generous helpings of the included frozen yogurt.\\n\\nIf you're looking for a place to eat massive amounts of delicious hotpot, this is it. Just be wary of the wait times and come with 3-4 people or more to make the best use of your money. \\n\\nGood service, excellent food, no glaring flaws. 4.5/5 stars."},{"name":"Toasted","address":"1945 Aloma Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4","text":"I really enjoyed the big cheese and the cup of tomato soup.

Being right on Hawthorne, it's a nice place to stop for some fuel before shopping around. The service can be a little spotty at times; the people at register seem bothered at times, not sure if it's just a bad day, or if that's just how they are, but it can be a little bit off-setting.

The roasted veggies are a must for me. As for the sauces, I definitely recommend the avocado cilantro. It's light, but full of flavor from that cilantro, and creamy from the avocado. It doesn't make the bowl mushy, but it does add that kind of 'adhesive' to get that perfect spoonful of everything.

If you want sweetness you can then control it with the maple syrup freely available at the table -- but if you use too much you'll mask any coconut subtlety in this dish. Maple syrup a bit on the watery side but still very sweet so taste it first before drowning your plate.\\n- Overall a bit plain and uninteresting especially for $9.75 unless you can't get a reasonable gluten free waffle elsewhere. Pass and get something more interesting.\\n\\nChicken Karaage Hash - $15.25; two eggs, sesame seed, nori, Sweet Ass Chili Sauce\\n- Usually when I see \\"hash\\" I think diced potato golden-browned into hash but here we get largish chunks of mixed roots in what adds up to a rather filling bowl that's fair value at $15.25.\\n- Chicken is really good. Enough crisp to it plus the use of seaweed adds an interestingness to it.\\n- If you are a lighter eater, you might want to partner up with a friend and together share this with an appetizer so you won't over-order.

Yes, it's true, as Yakuza was voted for having the best burger by Portland Monthly in 2009. The venue has two large garage doors, which when open make it very inviting on a nice day. There are long wooden tables and a bar with a patio out back, the minimalistic decor compliments the space well.\\nI went with a large group who also sought the famed burger, so I figured I I'd start with something else first. Why not sushi I thought to myself? I mean this is a Japanese restaurant after all. I love spicy foods so I decided to order the only obvious choice, the \\"really spicy roll\\". It consists of ahi tuna, avocado, cilantro and Thai chili. However what I got was a \\"really small roll\\". I mean for $12 I expected a lot more - of anything! The roll had maybe 6 pieces the size of an unshelled walnut. It lacked any kind of texture except mushy rice and I would like to rename it to the really bland roll rather than really spicy. I was left disappointed so the burger had better not fail to exceed my expectations.\\n\\nMy first mistake, I decided to split one with a friend. Next I asked is it really Kobe beef? The waitress replied yes, so it was ordered accordingly - no more than medium rare. After what seemed like an eternity of waiting the famed burger arrived. I took my half and after my first bite was transported to a world where cows massaged with sake are praised like gods, hoisted up on 24kt gold gondolas and paraded around while naked women shower them in rose petals! Um, I mean it was delicious. The meat was perfectly cooked, moist, flavorful and the star of the show. Now I usually don't recommend overshadowing quality beef with condiments. However these ingredients created a harmonious union from one luscious layer to the next. The bun, freshly baked was like an airy pillow inside with just the right amount of crust. The goat cheese acting as a binding agent held the flavors together while offering a rich, creamy, texture without being overly dense. The shoestring potatoes were a perfect balance of soft, crispy and lightly salted. The house made catsup was more like a tomato jam, brightly flavored with a touch of acid. I'm not even a fan of mayo but the spiced variety used added just the right amount of variation in flavor to make this burger special! Dare I say it was so good that bacon my celebrity meat was not even needed! Well I won't confirm that until it's tried. Bottom line ... It was totally worth $12, so much so I ordered another one all to myself. \\n\\nSO if you're looking for an out of body burger experience at a place you'd least expect, head to Yakuza and get your MEAT ON!"},{"name":"Cactus Club Cafe","address":"1085 Canada Place","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Awesome food awesome views and awesome service!

So, we decide to go order in person instead of online; annoying, but worth it for some to have blue cheese breath for the rest of the afternoon. \\n\\nWe arrive and are met by a clearly irritated employee who definitely does not want to take our order.

The average age of other patrons was easily 50+ on a Saturday evening.  We received scorned looks from most of the patrons as I spent the ENTIRE dinner trying to shush my children. They didn't deserve that. Morone's has much to do in terms of creating a kid-friendly atmosphere like better background noise, some crayons, maybe something small to much on (crackers etc) would go a long way. So if you have kids, stay FAR away!  Food-wise, the chicken alfredo was dry (maybe sat under a lamp too long) but still good. Service since we were so far from kitchen, was hit or miss. Time to get foos to us was on the longer side.  The servers were very pleasant people, but tended to serve the tables closer to kitchen much more.  We were chomping on ice a few times.

For as much hype as we had heard about it, we were not very pleased.  We all got the regular 2 patty burger but with different toppings.  While i absolutely loved all the options for toppings including caramelized onions and mushrooms, the biggest and most important failure of the burger was simply the flavor.  I think that it was because of the fact that it was organic possibly.  It just simply lacked flavor.  I also think that the meat was under salted.  I got the side of fries which were also very sub par.  While i love that they took the healthier route of frying them in olive oil, the fries were mostly over cooked and broken in half if you will.  The kicker was obviously the price.  Selling organic meat is expensive, i get that, but if you cannot produce an immensely flavorful burger and fries (and drink) for $11+, then you are going to have a tough time in this town of plentiful burger joints.

I don't understand why people would give a sushi restaurant bad rating if the curry does not come out to be thick enough or if the chicken is dry. Give them the fair rating for what they are for: Sushi. For sushi, especially the more traditional style sushi, Musashino is THE place to go in Austin. I have sushi all over the world, including the famous place inside the Tokyo train station and the world famous Tsukiji fish market. Musashino is the little sushi oasis in Austin. I usually  like hamachi, haramei and madai. But yesterday, the blue fin tuna was just exceptional --- just as good as any place from the Tsukiji market.\\n\\nThe new place is nice. Easy parking. Plenty of outdoor sitting. Service is good. So if you want to save money, don't go there. If you want the world best curry, don't go there. If you want a hamburger, or pizza or chicken, don't go there. But if you want good sushi but can't visit Japan, go there and you won't regret it."},{"name":"1927 S'mores Company","address":"1126 SW Alder St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Personally thought the Marionberry S'mores with White Chocolate was overwhelmingly sweet.

A very simple dish served piping hot that revealed the subtleties of its flavor slowly. My companion had pasta with carbonara sauce, but asked that they hold the pancetta. She said this was very good as well. While the Tiramisu was good, the Semifreddo that I had was unbelievably good. Hard-to-share good. Yes. That good.\\n\\nBut the noise. Good God, the noise. I guess it doesn't help that the vaulted ceiling creates an almost parabolic reflection of every sound below, and to their credit, the proprietors have installed sound deadening cloth panels on the walls. (Although this too is odd. What they have are taupe rectangles of cloth adorning every wall. I never thought I'd pine for Marimekko, but please?)\\n\\nThe real problem is how densely Teatro packs in their customers. I could not fit my fist between the table to my left and the table to my right. And the table wasn't very big. Sure, I don't know the economics of running a restaurant, but I do know the aesthetics of comfort.

Since it was a Tuesday there was a deal on the Dharma Bowl and my mother went with that and I had the Goddess salad. We also ordered the chai tea. \\n\\nThe first thing to arrive was our chai and it was amazingly flavorful. You can really taste the ginger, but it doesn't overpower the rest of the drink. Our food took a while (30-40 minutes) to arrive but after seeing them I understood why. The portions were HUGE and my salad alone could've fed two people. In NYC that amount of avocado would guarantee a price tag upwards of $20. Since my dish was solely vegetables with no carbs/starches I definitely appreciated the hugeness of the meal. Although I did like my meal I found it a bit lacking when compared to my mother's dish. Her tofu was perfectly firm and has an amazing teriyaki-esque glaze, all her veggies were grilled to perfection, and her rice had an interesting texture that was reminiscent of a risotto.\\n\\nWe paid a little over $30 which was a steal for the quantity and quality of the meal we were eating.

At the beginning, we asked our server, Charles, some basic questions, questions that any server should be able to answer about the menu.  While I do not have allergies, my friend does (to beans and to certain types of nuts), so it is imperative for a server to have reasonable well-informed responses to said questions.  My friend also indicated that these were allergies, so the server was appropriately alerted to this issue.  At the beginning of the meal, friend also asked about the carrot cake on the dessert bar, wanting to know if there were nuts in it.  He was assured there were not, but the server had to go ask first because he didn't actually know.  \\n\\nFor appetizers, he ordered oysters, and I ordered a \\"wild\\" mushroom saut√©.  For $12, I essentially got half of a piece of buttered toast with some saut√©ed (NOT wild) mushrooms and butter.  Tasted fine, but the quality did not warrant the price because it looked like they took some regular Wonder bread and button mushrooms from Kroger to make the dish. My friend's oysters on the half shell were served baked with cheese (not as advertised in the menu and not clearly explained by server).  \\n\\nIn terms of the entrees, the server tried to talk my friend out of what he initially planned to order, simply because the server did not want us to order the same thing.  When he did take the order, he asked neither of us for temperature requests on the steak.  Friend always orders rare with a push, and I always order medium rare.  Neither were asked, and as we were eating appetizers, we flagged over the server to tell him explicitly what temps the steaks should be.  It was clear he had written down whatever he felt like, which ended up being medium for my \\"rare\\" friend and (lucky guess!) medium rare for me.  \\n\\nBecause it was obvious he made a mistake, he tried to cover by bringing us a little soup appetizer, something akin to a gumbo...decorated with black beans.  Friend really couldn't eat it, due to the allergy.  \\n\\nSteaks came out...totally wrong.  Friend got something that looked mid-well, and I got something that was medium.  I worked in the industry for years, so I know what various steak temps should look like.  When we notified the server, instead of simply taking the steaks and assuring us that it would be fixed, he asked if he could take just the meat off the plate and leave us with the skillet beans and mashed potatoes.  Um, that's not how it works if you are trying to establish yourself as a fine dining establishment.  He took the plates, and the second time the steaks came out, his was medium rare, and mine was more on the \\"done\\" side of medium rare, but fine enough.\\n\\nThen to desserts.  We ate from the Valentine's Day dessert bar...and sure enough, after eating several small bite-sized portions of carrot cake, friend realized there were nuts in it.  Fortunately, his allergy is not a severe one, and he did not consume enough to land himself in the hospital, but the lack of server knowledge/willingness to get information right is alarming and could potentially cause real jeopardy for the establishment.  His lips are still swollen, but he will be okay.  \\n\\nI don't think our issues were isolated.  We saw a food runner try to drop off entrees to the table next to us who was in the process of finishing their entrees, and while on the way back from the restroom, my friend overheard some other customer saying their meals were overcooked.\\n\\nOverall, the server was friendly, but there were just too many mistakes, and there was no appropriate recompense.  While our first experience (last July) here was pleasant, the second was frankly a huge disappointment, and with so many other great options in the city, it would take substantial convincing for me to revisit this establishment for a meal.

The selection is huge.  The large Bento boxes (takeout lunch kits) are only ~$6.  This place has the best pre-made takeout sushi and is often larger and better than takeout from your typical sushi joint in Vancouver.  There's a small seating area in the front if you choose to eat cafeteria-style.  They also offer catering.\\n\\nThere's also a tiny section for Japanese VHS rentals (really?  VHS?!?) and magazines.  But the other draw is the grocery store and the small butcher counter which pretty much has every Japanese ingredient you desire.  This is where your wallet can suffer some serious damage.  Some items are very reasonably priced (i.e. $2 for items like candies, drinks and seaweed), but you'll end up hating yourself for dropping $4.50 on a small bottle of imported Japanese milk coffee that are about $1.50 each in Japan or $7 on a bottle of okonomiyaki sauce.  Oh well, it's expensive to import stuff and they definitely don't move the units like a large supermarket chain does.  \\n\\nThere's few other places to go for hard-to-find Japanese items.

Idk if it was because they didn't have that many choices, or if I was just being picky today. Not sure. I was stuck between the battered fish sandwich and the the crab and shrimp sandwich. I chose the fish sandwich which was about $17 bucks. A little pricy for lunch if you ask me. I asked for the hot pepper slaw to be placed on the side although I did find it to be tasty. Not your run of the mill mayo filled coleslaw. The sandwich also had a creamy remoulade sauce on it and B&B pickles. \\n\\nThe fish of the day was Catfish so I was happy with that. However, I've not had batter dipped catfish before so that was an interesting twist. It seemed to be a good ratio of batter to fish. Not much flavor though. The bread and remoulade sauce really saved the sandwich. Of course the fries were yummy and crispy. I also had dessert, I had to get the hot milk cake. I loved how our server knew exactly how it was made and why it's called hot milk cake. She even told us that it's a family recipe of the owner. It did not disappoint, hence why I couldn't get a photo. It was so good!!!!! It's a very moist, rich, yellow cake with caramel and sea salt topping. We also had after dinner coffee.

My date and I had a pretty diverse sampling from the tapas menu and we were a bit underwhelmed. We started off with the rare tuna, which was alright, the salsa was the best part and there wasn't really enough tuna on there to get a great idea of the flavor, or maybe it was just that the tuna wasn't that fresh. Sort of walks the line between small plates and not worth it. Next, we had the escargots in garlic butter sauce which was really good, definitely recommended. Continuing our winning streak, we got the goat cheese, eggplant, pesto and veggies stack which might have been the best thing we ordered all night. Next up on the list was the petit filet mignon, which was good, not great. A little dry and lacking some flavor, not to mention a bit overcooked. The biggest disappointment of the night was the angel hair pasta with mussels, calamari, shrimp and littlenecks. It's baked, so it came out very dry, the calamari was overcooked and tough and the entire plate was just bland as could be. The menu says \\"garlic lobster broth\\" but it seemed like that part was skipped entirely. For our last (sixth) dish, we had the pan-sauteed sweetbreads which was really good and one of the biggest dishes, would definitely recommend it. As for the restaurant experience, the interior is very old-world Spanish which was nice, but the service wasn't anything to rave about. The hostess sat us right next to another party even though the restaurant was completely empty, which was awkward, and we had to ask for new plates after we filled ours up with seafood shells.

The bar was sparsely furnished, the dining room is very dark, with an open kitchen taking up much of the dining space. Our server was a pleasant young girl, who had the misfortune of telling us that there was no soup on the menu, no specials for the evening, and that they had not set up the coffee pot yet, so no coffe was available. It was not a great start, but we were willing to give it a fair chance since this was a soft opening. One person in the party ordered a salad for dinner, while the remaining 2 ordered full entrees. The salad was brought right away with the message that our dinners should be right along. They did not arrive for another half hour, and by then the first person served was already done with their meal. I ordered Haddock Francese over pasta - the sauce itself was very good, however, when I took my first bite into the fish itself, I pulled 3 good sized bones out of my mouth. I informed the waitress and she said she would inform the owner. About 15 minutes later a woman came to the table and asked if everything was okay. I told her it was until I pulled 3 bones out of my mouth and that was when she leaned into me and said \\"Well, you know, ALL fish has bones\\". I responded that yes they do, until you CLEAN. them before serving, and not for the money that I was paying. She offered me another meal, or a dessert or appetizer multiple times after I declined each of her offers. Why would I want dessert when I had not even eaten dinner, and especially with no coffee to serve with it? When we received the bill, there was no adjustment made for the dinner that they removed from the table after one bite, which made me even less happy than I already was. I mentioned to my server that I was not happy with the way I was spoken to by the other woman, who turned out to be a manager, and wanted to know why she would give me free food but not credit my bill in any way? The server asked for my name and number to give to the owner, but I declined, because at that point there was nothing he could do to make my experience any better, and if he was going to offer me something to come back and give them another try, then thank you, but no thank you.

Sweet Cheeks Q is far, far from sweet.\\n\\nThe headline says it all. Our expectations were set to precise, smart, confident Tiffany from Top Chef, but the food and service was more akin to something you'd expect from Food Network's resident knucklehead.\\n\\nThe Sunday after the 4th we were reading online about where to eat and have a few drinks when we saw a fun blurb about Sweet Cheeks having a classic Texas BBQ spread. The main draw for us, since they're very hard to come by in Boston, the hushpuppies.\\n\\nYes, hushpuppies!\\n\\nAlso, I used to watch Top Chef, and when I saw it was (red-headed, sssssssnake) Tiffany's restaurant I thought, \\"Great. The menu will be delicious and everything  we order will be perfectly executed. This restaurant definitely won't burn us like so many others!\\"\\n\\nWrong. \\n\\nDead wrong.\\n\\nRe-animated then re-dead wrong.\\n\\nStraight up, the worst part was the service. Awful. God awful. And I suspect the bad service (and poor management?) explains eveything else that went wrong, too.\\n\\nMe and my partner are laid back as hell. Give us water, drinks, and the waitstaff can disappear all they like, whatever. But leave us without anything except a crumpled menu flapping in the wind? No thanks. And especially not at these prices.\\n\\nSo, our waitress (who I won't describe except to say that she's the one with the sleepy eyes) may be a nice girl but she's in the wrong frigging business. I know it was a holiday weekend, but it wasn't even busy. And no matter how many tables she had, she could have asked for help. (At the end, a more competent waiter did come and ask if everything was ok. It was too little, too late by then,  though. \\"Just the check, please.\\") \\n\\nWe did see tv's Tiffany taking a stroll outside and talking to customers. I felt like they were in a different restaurant. Maybe we should have eaten inside where the waitress's manager would see the cluster? I've noticed Tiffany has mellowed on tv, maybe she's mellowed off tv, too? Who knows.\\n\\nFinally, the water came. Then later a round of drinks. Then we tried to put our order in and the waitress announced that there were no hushpuppies (wtf?) and just walked away (wtf?) Then... no waitress.\\n\\nWe sat for a good 10 minutes after we'd finished our beer and cocktail, thirsty and hungry, our order not even placed. We seriously (for real) considered leaving cash on the table for the drinks and buying some apples or something at the Star Market across the street.\\n\\nAnyway, one hour and fifteen minutes later another server brought us our food, which looked and tasted like it had been sitting. You know, fine dining. I had the fried chicken and TIL Texas-style fried chicken simply means leftover fried chicken, where the breading can be slipped off the meat like an old sock. Yum! The mac and cheese was Texas-style, too: lukewarm, with a funky aftertaste. Not a big step up from KFC and Velveeta with Ritz crackers,  really.\\n\\nAll in all, Sweet Cheeks Q was a huge diappointment. Letdown of letdowns. The most frustrating part? We watched several other patrons arrive half an hour after us and they got served first. That's unacceptable. Served food and drinks, mind you, not just water and \\"no hushpuppies.\\"\\n\\nTiffany's done a remarkable job building her brand and setting high expectations, from starting out as the villain of the first season of a breakout tv show to a series regular who seems like an extremely well respected chef who knows exactly what she's doing. Sadly, the actual dining experience at Tiffany's misses the mark wildly. Wildly. There was nothing sweet about Sweet Cheeks. \\n\\nMy partner and I love hitting up new restaurants but time and again we walk away saying something like, \\"Instead of spending our money here, let's just go out less and save up for the places with exceptional food and exceptional service every single time. One and a half meals for two at a place like Sweet Cheeks equals one meal for two at an Abe & Louie's or The Captial Grille, as far as price goes. Think about that! It's insane.\\n\\nAnyways, it's just food. It's just one dismal meal. Best of luck to Tiffany. I hope she gets it together and trims the fat before it's too late and bad word of mouth sinks Sweet Cheeks.\\n\\n(Oh, and our waitress should get a check up. I'm low energy but she's low zombie.

Not only is it an interesting part of town with funky little coffee spots but it a great place to hang out for a while. You also don't feel rushed and it's pretty much self serve so you can sit down to check out the menu and decide when you want to order.  Mind you it does get pretty packed on weekends during brunch time but the line moves pretty quickly.\\n\\nThe menu is full of many healthy items, like a whole page devoted just to Juices, Smoothies, and Elixirs.  Everything from Wheatgrass shots to funny juice names like \\"Whichdoctor\\" when you need to kick up your immune system.  They even have a whole coffee menu that has not just coffee but things such as 3 types of Mochas, Turmeric tonics of sorts and even a Harlow Mushroom concoction that looked interesting.  Had just had my coffee fill so I was here on a mission to some sort of vegan brunch to warm me up on a kind of wet winter kind of day.\\n\\nI love how you can get any menu items in the morning hours like wraps and bowls even when they had a lot of breakfast items.  Normally I like to eat lunch for breakfast and such.  You know things like eating leftover pizza for breakfast and all but when I saw the word Rancheros I was like oh wow a vegan Mexican breakfast dish, how cool is that.  Says it comes with either Smokey Tempeh or seasoned Jackfruit.  Thought about the choices for a while because I was trying to visualize which would be the better choice.  I would say I'm not always a fan of jackfruit as meat as the tastes of this can be all over the board so I went with a more safe choice for my tastes and got the smokey tempeh.  I like anything with smoke (not inhaling) by the way:R\\n\\nJust as a note this place is not totally vegan but is all vegetarian.  They mostly let you choose regular eggs to some of the dishes instead of the vegan meats.  I thought that was much more respectful as you were not paying to take vegetarian items out. I saw they also had honey as sweeteners in some of the drinks but again easily switch out to agave etc.  \\n\\nRancheros came with two tortillas, the Tempeh, with Ranchero Enchilada sauce on top with beans and corn, kale and guacamole.  All was topped off with a Jalapeno cashew sauce on top and pickled Jalapenos. It looked all great and tasted good too.  The Tempeh came in little tater tot sized pieces and went great with the beans and sauces.  Even with all the jalapenos it was not all that spicy so I added some of the hot sauces they provide on the tables to kick it up a bit.  Overall it was filling and a great start to my day.  Warmed me up and I loved hanging out getting some work done after my meal as you don't feel rushed even with it being pretty packed.  The only thing I would have loved was  a few  roasted potatoes thrown in there.

Well, upon arrival the very rude lady at the door was adamant that I didn't  have a reservation so I had to show her the TWO confirmation emails I received.  They had no record of the reservation and I was advised that it was a \\"glitch\\" in the system..ugh!  The owner attempted to fix the problem by bringing in a table from the outside for four (which made us feel like misfits) and separating my party by making two of the six sit at the bar..therefore, we could not celebrate together which broke my family's heart.  Although the owner tried to mitigate by comping a bottle of champagne (which I had to request) and removing two of the six entry fees, i don't feel that it was adequate.  None of us should have paid an entry fee and only four of us was able to enjoy the comp'd bottle of champagne because the other two had to sit at the bar while we sat at a picnic table in the middle of the floor.  Meanwhile, there was an empty table beside us for two which could have accommodated us all sitting together.  They should have asked those two who had not arrived to sit at the bar upon their arrival and allowed us to all sit together.  In addition, they \\"ran out\\" of water glasses and served us water in a champagne glass.;  And, to top it off, when it was time to pay, there was another \\"glitch\\" in the system that couldn't take my Amex card so I had to scramble to pay another way...we all left the establishment vexed and I had to quickly come up with a plan B which required me spending even more money than I planned.  Not only will I not be going back, I will NEVER recommend it to anyone.  I am in a business where I have to recommend dining options to my clients all the time, and this used to be one of my go-to recommendations.  I cannot take the chance that any of my clients will have such an experience.  It makes me sad because I used to really like Jazz Tastings but this experience has changed my entire view of the place."},{"name":"Primo","address":"4040 Central Florida Pkwy","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Okay folks, this is a wow, wow, WOW restaurant. I was staying on the property for a meeting and the last night a party of seven of us got dinner here. It all starts with the staff, so applauds there, great staff, top to bottom. \\n\\nFirst of all, I knew it would be special because when I was taking a stroll I came upon the backside of the restaurant and observed their wondering garden. It gave me an inkling of what I was in store for. \\n\\nStarted with the meatballs--They come in three's, don't plan on sharing. You will want all three.\\n\\nBread and olive oil were good. We also got a mixed meat and cheese platter that also had a honeycomb. So good.\\n\\n\\nI carefully went over the menu and decided on the lobster fettuccine with crab. It had a longer. more pretentious name, but I don't have a menu in front of me.  All I can say is this was one of the top 3 seafood dishes I have ever had! It comes with three big crusted shrimp on top that are delectable. This dish must have had almost a pound of lobster in it, so that was surprising as well. But the jena se qua in this dish is it's subtle yet present spices. I would not call it a spicy dish, but I would not call it a non-spicy dish either. It has the certain indescribable collation of ingredients that entice but not overwhelm. I felt it just had such wonderful balance. The lobster was cooked correctly, the shrimp was cooked perfectly. WOW\\n\\nNot one person in our party was not super pleased. Duck was great, pork was great, pizza was great and the steak was great. I did not hear a single word of the negative from any of our party. So that is rare and worth the time to write this review.  I am a Platinum Elite with Marriott, so there is a good chance I will come back to this property and if I do, you can bet where I will be eating dinner."},{"name":"Rogue Eastside Pub & Pilot Brewery","address":"928 SE 9th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"If the OBC has declared a BrewPub as worthy, dammit, it is.  \\nIt's about the beer, and being happy with it, and this is sure a place to indulge in that.

The experience definitely left me less than impressed and the food wasn't amazing enough for me to try a second time. A few notes:\\n\\n-I arrived right when the restaurant opened and got a table for my group of girlfriends. I ordered a drink for myself and the waiter was kind enough to check on me a few times while I waited for others to arrive.\\n\\n-However, once all my friends arrived, a new waiter appeared and this one kept disappearing! Not literately- I could see him check on a table across the way multiple times over, but we always had to flag him down to come to us.\\n\\n-As for the food - it was just ok to me. Nothing I tried was super tasty to the point I wanted to order another bite..even though it would only cost me a few dollars.\\n\\n-My main gripe is how the evening ended. When our check arrived, I noticed it was a bit more than I expected. Why? Every cocktail (about 5 total) was charged at full price when they should have been half-off. No problem- I'll just flag down the waiter, but nope. This guy was actively ignoring me! I tried direct eye contact, raising my glass, even a slight wave. Nothing! I finally (even though I HATE raising my voice) had to call out to the waiter \\"Excuse me!\\" the 5th time he sped-walked past our table without a glance.\\n\\n15 minutes later the whole mess was sorted out, but it definitely left a bad taste in my mouth. I do not like feeling that I'm a bother when I'm paying good money for food and drinks. What's more is they place an extra 20% charge on my debit card for gratuity. I pay cash for tips and in all the years I've dined out in Austin, I've never had that happen to me before. Once the charge cleared, the extra 20% disappeared, but I was still bothered I had to call to find out why I was charged more than I signed for on the slip. Just one more annoyance that confirms I won't be coming back."},{"name":"Caffe Paradiso","address":"255 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I have been going to this caf√© since the early 2000s.

You know, if you are like me, you might feel good steak is hard to come by in Boston. I've been to the big establishments (Capital Grille, Abe & Louie's) and have always felt that the actually steak at these places were always a bit mediocre. Not here. Not a chance. \\n\\nBefore we get into the food, let's get the basics of the place down. This is a 5-6 table speakeasy-esque steakhouse at the back of JM Curleys. I had heard about it from a fellow foodie in NYC who had seen it in a list of secret restaurants on Yahoo. Intrigued, I made a reservation (by e-mail only). When I arrived at JM Curley, the waitress escorted my date and I to a room hidden behind the bar. It was kinda too cool.  We ordered two drinks from the bar (it has its own) and waited - be prepared to wait. It was 45minutes from sitting down to eating. \\n\\nFood: I had the dry-aged New York Stripe - damn. It has that buttery but almost lightly-fried crisp surface that reminds me of the steak I get at Peter Lugar's in Brooklyn, NY. The meat will just melt in your mouth. Go ahead and get the foie gras butter for the steak too (order just 1 - its enough to share with 2-3 people). My date for the night had the Tenderloin which she adored...but my NY stripe was better.\\n\\nThe sides were also excellent - we had 3. The tomatoes; which were done very nicely, cut in half, lightly fried. The french fries were just the way I like 'em: thin, crispy, lightly salted. The Mac & Cheese was good, but I probably would pick something else next time. We were too full to get dessert.\\n\\nIt definitely does a good job promoting its air of secrecy and exclusivity but, most of all, delivers quality.

They have great Dank bomb deals, which makes it a great spot for hanging out with friends to grab some drinks. \\n\\nFood wise, their meat is lower quality compared to other Orlando KBBQ places. They bring the grill to your table, which is unlike other restaurants where the grill is built into the table. I wish they had the built in grills, because the grills they provide will sometimes run out of gas. These grills also hold a lot of oil from the meat, so you constantly have to dump the oil out into the little bowl of oil by the spout. Also, for some reason, these grills cause a lot of oil to splatter. Every time I come here, it's like a war zone because I always get splattered by oil! This never happens at the other KBBQ restaurants I go to... The tables also don't have a ventilated area, so you come home smelling like pork belly lol. Other than that, their food is average. My favorite meat is probably their marinated pork belly, which is marinated in a sweet sauce. \\n\\nI will likely continue to come here when I am in desperate cravings for KBBQ. I hope to see that they upgrade their grills and meat quality in the future. Progressively over the years, they have bumped up their prices for college night KBBQ, so I'm not sure how worth the deal is anymore in contrast to other restaurants.

This burger tasted so good that I almost thought it was real meat; the flavor and texture is spot on, and I really liked how Toasted prepared and presented it.\\n\\nUnlike many other reviewers, I was not a huge fan of the truffle fries; I don't know whether it was the truffle oil or the rosemary, but I found something about them overpowering. The fries themselves were cooked well though, and they were crispy and fresh. \\n\\nMy boyfriend ordered the \\"Mac Attack\\": a grilled sandwich with swiss, cheddar, muenster, jack cheese, arugula, applewood smoked bacon, and mac & cheese. His food was a bit too greasy for him, so he was hesitant to give it another go, but I will definitely be returning to get another Impossible Burger, and perhaps a different side."},{"name":"Sinju Japanese Restaurant","address":"7339 SW Bridgeport Rd","city":"Tigard","stars":"3","text":"Apparently, Sinju is one of Bridgeport Village's oldest tenants so they know how to satisfy customers.\\n\\nThis is a great spot for a business occasion.

There is literally one booth that fits like 4 guys, 3-4 more tables that fit like 2-4 and a bar area that seats like 2 or 3 people. \\n\\nOne downside: this part of the restaurant is literally separated by a curtain. Thus, the hustle and bustle of the JM Curley area is still very loud and people kept stumbling into this area and asking to be seated because the wait at JM Curley was very long (and they seemed pretty buzzed already). I feel like for the price point they need to make the environment better than what it is.

Both were very tasty. \\n\\nNext came the bread. It was room temperature and just sat on a table... that was next to the bathroom... that was a little weird.

The pork chop was VERY nicely cooked and moist. I was surprised how well cooked it was actually... It was also a huge piece of pork chop. The baked potato was ok too... had similar toppings as what was on the wedge salad. \\n\\nOverall I really liked the food and handcrafted drinks.

Sizzler and Red Lobster were really the only two options our parents would give us since they were close to home.  My mom was a great cook, so eating out wasn't a regular occurrence and made the times we did special. I often wonder if my children will be too opinionated and unappreciative of dining experiences because we take them to so many places, far more that I experienced as a kid. It's easy to take things for granted when there is an abundance. I sometimes find myself (as an adult) not appreciating food and family time like I should because we have no shortage of it. Suddenly things begin to get compared to the \\"best we've ever had\\" instead of enjoying the moment. \\n\\nSizzler brings me back to a simpler time in life, when my parents said \\"Let's go out to eat\\" and my heart filled with excitement. My go to dish was the Malibu Chicken. I don't know why, and can't reasonably explain it, but I love this dish. I feel like a kid every time I eat it and I completely know it's just a cheap slab of chicken and ham with melted swiss cheese, but  when I'm in a mood like I was tonight, it's more satisfying that the best five course meal money could buy. It connects with something on the inside of me that just can't be rated.\\n\\nSo while some of you may laugh at a 5 Star rating for Sizzler, the little boy in me thinks it should be a 10!\\n\\n\\nNOTE:\\nService tonight was excellent. We tipped our server extremely well for her wonderful attitude after working nearly the entire day on Christmas Eve.\\n\\n\\nYelp100 [14]"},{"name":"Al Hawr","address":"3500 SW River Pkwy","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Great restaurant!

The places has also long had a nice outdoor entertainment area featuring lots of local and area bands. \\n\\nThe last owner just opened the place and didn't put much effort into the inside. The place now looks newer ,remodeled and up to date.  We did come to tonight. specifically for the wings. We will probably go back again and try other things and hopefully see a few bands this summer.\\n\\nI use to be, and perhaps still am Columbus' foremost expert on Buffalo wings. Even though I gave up  the Columbuswings.com website I still enjoy a good wing. We didn't know that the order we were about to place was tonight's special.  Being a weekday workday  we didn't want ant alcohol or softdrinks with caffeine or sugar.  We ordered water.  \\n\\nThe waitress came back and told us in order to get the special we had to order drinks.  My first reaction was that wasn't mentioned on the menu and I don't like being labeled a cheapskate because I ordered water.  We do go out on weekends or non work days and spend a little more.  The waitress probably thought we were cheap because she didn't hear us order fries with it. We figured that one when they didn't come with our order.\\n\\nNow to the wings. Clearly they want to make this a little upscale, or try to differentiate themselves from other wings.  They marinate 24 hours, dry rub, bake, deep fry, massage, and read poetry to their chickens before taking their wings.  Ok, I am kidding a little bit.  But they wouldn't score well on the authentic Buffalo wings scale, but they are good and their sauce isn't just another Franks or Anchor clone.  Many people, including myself will like them on their own merits. The hot sauce is a proper heat level and is definitely unique.\\n\\nThe fries when they came were fresh cut seasoned fries.  I would have been happy with Fresh cut fries, but clearly this place was to be seen as something serving something a little more than just standard bar fare.  The seasoning also was unique, it was good.   \\n\\nWe will be back again to try other appealing looking offerings.\\n\\nNext, I hope they re-do the parking lot.\\n\\nOur second visit here was a Friday night and a good local band was playing so we were outside in the patio area.

The small plates are individual sized, and were great for sharing.  The menu is mostly focused on pastas, but does have some other selections, so felt a bit limited to find wheat free options that weren't small plates.  Everything our group had and shared was A-OK.  The stuffed calamari was a bit tough and tasteless.  I think they stuffed it to offset the poorly cooked calamari. Everyone's favorite thing here though was the cheese.  The house made mozzarella was amazing, and the cheese plate was delicious.  The desserts were here or there, nothing to save room for.

Atlanta Burger Week!  (atlburgerweek dot com - a yearly event that offers up $5 specialty burgers around town)  My 7 friends and I had 50+ places to choose from and we decided on The Imperial on 4/26/17.   Because it had a big PIMENTO CHEESE BALL!

Just make sure you watch the clock:  6pm means 6pm!\\n\\nWednesdays:  Wine Wednesdays!  1/2 Price bottles of wine every Wednesday\\n\\nThe Parking Situation:  Free!  There's a rough (unpaved) little lot in back that actually can fit a good number of cars if people don't park like idiots.  When they do, consider back in the neighborhood on Mead Road if you can't snag a place out front on College.  Or take MARTA to the East Lake station and walk three blocks east.\\n\\nWe manage to grab a spot on the outdoor patio, which is lovely.  They have enough awnings and umbrellas so you don't have to melt out there in direct sunlight.  We figured that it might get busy because of Burger Week and it did.  But we went about 6pm and it didn't start getting too crazy until an hour or so later.\\n\\nThe food was delicious.  Have I mentioned the big PIMENTO CHEESE BALL?  All of us had the burger offering, which was The Pimento Smash Burger (description in photo).  Burger, fries and a \\"What We Have\\" beer (also a standard staple on the menu that changes up periodically) = $7.50.  Quite the deal.   I can't speak on anything else or their every day sort of offerings, so I'll have to make a return visit on a normal day.  If their food is anything like this special offering though, I'll be super jazzed to go back.\\n\\nThe patrons there were also lovely.  Everyone was very nice, conversations were had across tables, everyone seemed to be in a very good mood.  One couple even shared a glass of their wine with us when we oohed and aahed over the label and they decided we needed to taste it.  The staff was a little less friendly, though:  not very conversational, and I'm not sure I saw our server smile once.  She had a little bit of an attitude and she did mess up our tabs at the end  (though this being a busy week-long event, I'm totally willing to give her a pass -- we were able to sort things out among ourselves).  The only other mishap was a friend having part of her beer spilled on her by the owner who delivered it.  I think it would have been nice had she received that for free since it was quite a spill all over her shirt and jeans (I assume the owner has the ability to make those decisions).

I thought standing in the express line would count for something but apparently not! I was invisible to them! How can they not notice me? I'm 5'6 wearing blue scrubs!!!!!!!

This Burger King is where it's at. And I totally recommend it. \\n\\nGranted the parking lot kind of looks like the kind of place where people do all sorts of off-the-radar transactions, and I see more people eating in the parking lot of this place than at any other fast food joint I've gone to. But hey, the prize is not the parking lot but rather what's inside the restaurant. \\n\\nThey've done a great job modernizing it. Seriously, the dingy dirty and cheap feel of the old Burger King places is gone, and this place feels solid and well-designed. They've got flat screen TVs, these fancy soda dispensers where all the liquid comes out of the same hole, and these great high seats for eating your meals. \\n\\nAlso, their food is wonderfully consistent. Seriously, it's kind of a blend between McDonalds and Shake Shack in terms of taste and time between when you order and when the food is ready. I've been there several times during the past few months, and the Whoppers and fries just keep tasting their same wonderful selves. \\n\\nOh yeah, the place is clean. I haven't used the bathroom because I have  a bit of a phobia about parking my can where many others have occupied, but usually when a restaurant is that clean in the serving area, the bathroom follows suit. \\n\\nAs for the staff, everyone there is really nice, and yes, they all seem to be Brazilian which is actually a tremendous asset because I salivate just thinking about churrascarias with their pichana, fraldinha, and beef ancho. So having Brazilians prepare the food just seems to make it taste better. \\n\\nOne thing I keep noticing there is how efficiently everyone works, and they do it while smiling and being nice. How rare is that to see in any fast food restaurant? It's a terrific model for how a fast food restaurant should be run.

I understand it's always been a popular place with locals and also underwent a management change in recent years. I visited Rocco's a couple years ago, which I believe was under the current management, and at that time had a good experience with the food, service, and its cozy atmosphere. Last night one of my best friends and I stopped in randomly after viewing some Christmas light displays in Tewksbury. However, last night I witnessed some serious confusion amongst the waitstaff and found this experience quite different from the last. I find Rocco's to be a bit on the pricier side, when considering the cost of most entrees, and I think the dining experience should flow like a well-oiled machine to reflect this. \\n\\nWe decided to sit at the bar so we could catch a little bit of the Bruins game. The bar scene was busy, but seemed manageable from a customer's prospective. When we first sat down there were two bartenders, but one left after setting us up with menus leaving the other to fend for himself. He seemed friendly and chatty, but a little overwhelmed at times. \\n\\nA large delicious-looking salad topped with grilled chicken passed by us as we glanced over the menu. It was placed in front of a man on the opposite side of the bar and met with some resistance. I overheard the conversation and soon realized he had actually ordered chicken fingers. The salad went back to the kitchen as my friend and I exchanged confused glances. How did that happen? \\n\\nWe put in an order for calamari and sipped on some special Christmas-themed cocktails. My friend asked the bartender, in a moment that seemed less busy, if he would take a picture of us. This is our traditional 'girl's night out' to celebrate before Christmas, so she was trying to capture the moment. The bartender told us 'no' with some lengthy explanation of why not. For the record, due to the background noise I could not hear/comprehend the explanation very well, but the bits and pieces of it sounded quite silly. In the time it took for the explanation, he could have just snapped the photo. Rejection is never pleasant, even in its smallest form. Fortunately a very friendly woman at the bar jumped right up to take the picture for us. \\n\\nCue the calamari... which arrived at the bar to our left by a very confused server who did not know where to place it. The server and bartender then had a brief discussion as we tried to get their attention. The bartender seemed to forget where it was supposed to go as well. Hmm... we must have really thrown him off when we asked for that photo. Once we claimed our calamari, we all came to the realization that we did not have plates or silverware. However, the guy at the other end of the bar did finally receive his chicken fingers, so not a total loss. \\n\\nOh, could we have some napkins too? Thanks.\\n\\nThe confusion between servers was really bothering me, but fortunately the calamari was delicious. The live entertainment began as a solo artist did a little guitar and vocals act. All was well until the mysterious pizza came onto the scene. \\n\\n\\"Wait, is that my pizza?\\" I pondered as I watched it set down in front of the people next to me. They had ordered after us, so why was their pizza out? Then I saw the look of confusion on their faces as they sent the pizza back to the kitchen. I then realized that it was indeed my pizza being shifted around and wouldn't you know it soon landed in front of me. \\"Don't worry, they didn't touch it\\" I was told. Thanks for the reassurance, but it's probably not as warm after it's round trip back and forth from the kitchen. \\n\\nMy friend's salad arrived soon after and the same guessing game continued. The pizza, referred to as The Romano, was very good and my friend said she liked her steak salad. She claimed to be happy with the experience overall and probably would have offered an extra shiny star if she were a Yelper. Unfortunately you are stuck with me and I expect far better than this dog and pony show. \\n\\nI could not understand why the bartender had so much difficulty keeping track of the orders and I believe this shows a lack of interest in the customers. This experience will stick with me and I most likely will be a hesitant to come back to Rocco's in the future. If I do return, it will be for the calamari."},{"name":"Watershed on Peachtree","address":"1820 Peachtree Rd NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"So glad I finally got to try this place. Nice atmosphere, large drink selection, and delicious food. We ordered the fried chicken, which was amazing. It came with collard greens, pickles, one deviled egg, and two biscuits with a spicy honey spread for them. So tasty. I didn't want it to end. Large portion. It comes with a leg, thigh, and small breast. Other than the fried chicken, the other menu options were not that appealing to me, and the fried chicken is limited, so me and my friend got the last order. A group of 4 next to us saw how much we were enjoying the fried chicken, and how good it looked. They tried to order it, and they were told there was no more. So I'm happy we got there first. To go with the meal, I ordered the brut champagne, which is my favorite, sauvignon blanc, which is another favorite, and the flower rose. Didn't like the flower rose, gave it back. For dessert we had the Baked Atlanta which is a banana pudding with cr√®me br√ªl√©e. Reminded me of a baby baked Alaska. It was really good, and I'm not even a banana pudding fan, but I would definitely order that again. You're looking at $140 with tip for two people if you buy multiple drinks by the glass, or if you order more than 2 mixed drinks per person. I love the carefree parking. Big plus for me because tedious or paid parking drives me crazy. All you do is take a picture of your tag, and they handle the validation for up to 6 hrs. Very cool.

We also got a serving of the Taiwanese soup pork dumplings. Dumplings were ok, wouldn't get again. We only got it because they were out of the spicy calamari :(( \\nThe hot pot was nice and they said it was shareable for two people but it really felt like one hearty portion. It would be ok if I wasn't hungry but I also grew up always having a feast during hot pot. If you wanted to have a feast here you would rack up a HUGE bill. All in all ok but I wish for more food. I would rather come here for ramen, it was more filling. We also got the Japanese whiskey flight to share, and they were able to give us extra glasses to split. Awesome assortment, really different flavors. A barkeep came out to explain each sample to us.

Brewmaster Will; brewer Kevin, and chefs David Drew & Jonathan. They are simply the best. They make fantastic beer & food and always make you feel welcome. Even when they are super busy they make sure you're well taken care of.\\n\\nThe menu is updated every season, which I appreciate. The salads are the freshest, full of good locally sourced things, as is the beer. I also love the burgers . . . sometimes I branch out and try other things (you really can't go wrong here). Normally we're here during weekend brunch. I can't do eggs, so I avoid all the amazing breakfast dishes, but one time I had the breakfast tacos without the eggs, and they were delicious! That dish comes with tater tots and beans, so it's a lot of food. Everything is priced very fairly as well.\\n\\nOne of my favorite things about coming here is sitting at the end of the bar and talking to other customers, in addition to the staff. We've made quite a few great friends who are also regulars.\\n\\nWith respect to the beer, I have loved almost every one I've ever tried here. We always get a pitcher to start, and then branch out a bit. Probably my favorite house beers are the Amber, the Zwickel, and the Charles River Porter. Certain beers that are on seasonally we always look forward to as well, such as the Red God that is on right now. I simply can't say enough good stuff about their beers. You can't get fresher, more accessible, reasonably priced beer anywhere else in the area. \\n\\nAddressing the person who wrote in a review some complaint about the bathroom, I should say that the bathrooms were renovated in the past year, when The Smoke Shop next door was being built. \\n\\nI hope my husband and I live in this neighborhood for many years to come, and we will keep coming here as often as we can.

I don't mind paying a high price for food - as long as the taste justifies the cost. But this restaurant is ridiculously bland. Scallops were too hot when they arrived, they were underseasoned (if any seasnoning was used at all) and I enjoyed the bed of arugula it was on more than the scallops themselves.\\n\\nThe asparagus soup wasn't too bad but for $12 I would imagine they could have spared a little more crab meat than the little tablespoonful scoop looking up sadly into my eyes.\\n\\nThe salad was the biggest disappointment of all. How are you going to charge me $14 and give me only spinach, barely any goat cheese and portobello mushrooms?! I can run to the grocery store and put this together. The dish had NO unique flavor or ingredient, it was the most basic salad I have ever eaten.\\n\\nTheir wines were terrible as well. I tried a glass of their Chardonnay - it wasn't fruity OR oaky, it just tasted like it was sitting out for a while and the burning of the alcohol overpowered the poor grape. \\n\\nPinot Grigio was faint. Too faint. I know a good PG when I drink it, and this was not it.\\n\\nRiesling - it was okay. I still think the alcohol burned through the sweetness of the grape but it was much better than the Chardonnay. \\n\\nHighlight of the whole experience like many have mentioned is the freshly baked bread you are served while you wait with the dip, which consists of eggplants, capers, olives, perhaps some roasted peppers and olive oil, at least those were the ingredients I was able to pick up. \\n\\nIf it wasn't for the Groupon, I would have never come here.

Located on Orange near St. James Cathedral and Insomnia Cookies, Hubbly Bubbly is another venue that is running with the \\"create your own\\" concept. \\n\\nDuring our most recent trip, my wife and I walked over from our offices to meet for lunch. Since this place is relatively new and clean, you have to be sure to get there early to avoid a line. We took a look at the menu and headed towards the back of the venue to start our order. \\n\\nThe first choice you make is whether you want a pocket sandwich (think your classic gyro setup) or a salad or hummus bowl. Since I like gyros, I went with the pocket sandwich. You then choose a protein (falafel, lentil, chicken, or steak/lamb). I have tried the falafel and the steak/lamb choices. In both instances, I received an acceptable amount of protein, but you could definitely tell they weren't going to get any extra meat here.The final step was to add your toppings, which included lots of different types of vegetables and sauces. Since I like gyros, I usually get tzatziki sauce and a few vegetables to go with it. \\n\\nThe drinks here are solid (including some fun beers) and the staff is fairly polite. So why the 3 stars? Well, the reason is twofold. First, the proteins my wife and I ordered on both trips were just not that good. While we haven't tried the chicken, the falafel, lentil, and steak/lamb (as well as the hummus) were either dry or just not very good flavors. This sounds weird because I know they cut the lamb right off the vertical rotisserie, but both of our meats (we both did lamb on our second visit) tasted like they were old and stale. \\n\\nThe second issue was the \\"create your own\\" concept. While I generally like the new trend of picking your own ingredients and don't necessary knock Hubbly for offering it, Mediterranean food is usually made with a specific flavor combination to achieve tasty results. My attempt to put something together in line with ingredients I know I like has often resulted in food that didn't taste right. My big recommendation for this venue is to put together some standard flavor combinations on their menu for people to point to and order. I'd rather have someone knowledgeable put together a flavor combination so that I have the option of ordering something I know I'll like. Having these suggested combinations (that people can still tinker with to fit their personal preferences) would go a long way towards making this venue stand out.\\n\\nOverall, Hubbly Bubbly has some solid features. The clean venue, good drink options, and good concept make this one of the better downtown Mediterranean venues. However, the lack of standardized suggested combinations and proteins that don't always taste fresh (I'll give this place one more try to see how the chicken goes) drops this down the list of restaurants for me (for now) to recommend checking out in Downtown Orlando."},{"name":"Cafe Il Nido","address":"780 Thurlow Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"The food was great, but the service......... probably the worst I've ever experienced.\\nSo we had two waitresses for our table and one with the long hair was very nice.... she recommended us their special for that night and she was very polite and friendly.

I'll admit, I was a little skeptical given the location--very very dated area, but I figured we could try it out.  It also gave us a chance to divert from our usual route home and we were able to hop on 290 East and catch the toll to our house, thus avoiding some traffic we normally get caught in. \\n\\nWe tried the sesame chicken, sesame beef, and the honey crispy chicken, fried rice, steamed rice, egg rolls and egg drop soup (my hubby's favorite).  Hands down favorites were the sesame beef, fried rice egg rolls and the egg drop soup.  The sesame beef was crispy and fresh, no weird after-taste and it didn't taste like a cheap old piece of beef, it was freshly cooked and the sauce didn't overpower the beef.  I loved the egg rolls because they were crispy and didn't have an abundance of ginger...I'm not a fan of ginger--I know it's used pretty often in Asian cuisine, but to me it is very overpowering like cilantro can be.  For that reason, the honey chicken was my least favorite item--it had a lot of ginger flavor in it as well.  I'm not saying it was bad, I just personally don't like the flavor profile of ginger so I wouldn't order that again, but if you like the essence of ginger...you might enjoy it.  The fried rice as side dish was so good and fresh, not stale, greasy...but very simple and delicious.

And most chain restaurants fall in he trap of turn-and-burn poor customer service. And since most of these chains can be found in other areas of Orlando we just don't go here. \\n\\nSadly this one falls into that category. Have never had any issues with a Carrabbas until this one.  The place was dirty with sticky tables, dirty floors, and staff that ever looked like they were two seconds from losing it or just hated their life.  We got Sat at a table with one set of silverware and did not get any until we asked after our entrees were delivered. \\n\\nThe Italian salad that comes with the pasta had basically no dressing or toppings as advertised.  The Caesar, on the other hand, was drowning in dressing. The minestrone soup was basically water with loads of cabbage was flavor less. \\n\\nWhen entrees came my Shrimp and Scallop Alla Vodka was swimming in water. No flavor at all because they barely drained the pasta so all the water had diluted the sauce.  I also love basil and don't mind it as a garnish. However, if you are going to put it on as a garnish at least chop some up and sprinkle it over top.  I did let management know about my dish and he said he would get it re-tossed.  I would have figured just make a new one but as expected by it being cooked again the seafood was rubber.  Which I would have been fine if, as a kitchen maneger, I would have set the seafood aside and then added it back in at the end to avoid over cooking.  It did have more flavor the second time but still was far from the creamy sauce advertised. As a previous cook in many places I know pasts water can be a pain. But that's why you take the extra seconds to let it drain no matter how busy you are. \\n\\nTwo last things that bothered me about this experience...the table beside us also had an issue with one of their kids meals and the sever kept making excuses like 'oh yes they mix cheese in the sauce sometimes' and 'the kitchen is in a hurry so they probably just didn't mix it right'...I mean if you work in any restaurant, chain or not, you are there to follow the recipe and produce the dishes that are expected by the diners.  The experience should not be adjusted just because it's busy.  Make if right the first time. This hurts a chain especially because you are giving people a bad impression of your standards. \\n\\nLastly, I am a better than average tipper, even when having bad experiences.  I know in this area there is usually a little note on the bill letting the diner know what tip amounts are usually accepted. I found this extremely deceiving to people who are not paying attention, especially tourists.  A comp second pasta was added which I am guessing was for my dish that was fixed. Even though I got the same fish back. (The shrimp and Scallop I had half eaten were still in the bowl that's how I knew it was same.) While that extra dish wasn't added in the total I owed it was used to calculate the net total which the tip was based on.  So therefore people who do pay attention are paying a tip on an amount they didn't actually pay. As a restaurant employee in my past I have no issues with servers getting the tips they rightfully deserve but don't deceive your diners who aren't paying attention. \\n\\nBasically just avoid this and any place on I-Drive if you are a local.  It is not worth getting treated like you are a tourist who they assume doesn't care."},{"name":"OH Pizza & Wings","address":"18 Dillmont Dr, Ste B","city":"Columbus","stars":"4.5","text":"Great pizza, fast delivery.

You'll be so proud of me.\\"\\nKevin's mother would nod her head, convinced that he was right. \\nWhen Kevin would go to school each day, he would tell his classmates the same thing, and they would nod and smile, convinced that he was right. \\"Just like his daddy,\\" other shrimp would often be heard to say, referring to Kevin's father, who was rumored to have been among the crew of one of the best po' boys ever served in New Orleans.\\n\\nUnfortunately, the story of Kevin does not have such a happy ending.\\nYou see, Kevin and a few of his friends were caught a while back. Kevin's mother watched with both fear and hope, but as he was being dragged from his ocean home, he yelled to her, \\"Don't worry 'bout me, Ma! I'm gonna make you so proud!\\"\\nAfter being brought onto the land, Kevin and one of his little buddies were separated from their other friends. Following a brutal process involving being boiled alive, beheaded, his legs being amputated and his flesh ripped from his shell, and then being frozen for months, Kevin and I crossed paths at Canton Cooks, located in the Whole Foods shopping center at Roswell and Hammond. Poor Kevin had nothing to be proud of. He had no flavor. He was tough and chewy. I sincerely hope that his mother never hears the truth, and that no one back in his hometown learns of this disgraceful end to so promising a life.\\n\\nI considered ordering the baked Western-style shrimp, and asked the server what \\"western-style\\" means. The explanation provided to us in both English and Chinese did nothing to elucidate, but was sufficient to explain that Canton Cooks does not sell fresh seafood, with the exception of the single Dungeness crab in a sad, filthy tank, who stared angrily at me throughout my meal. Their seafood is almost exclusively frozen. I asked for more time to decide what to order. Another server came minutes later, and I tried to order spare ribs. But he explained that they do not have spare ribs, and that the items identified as such on the menu are more like pork chops in sweet and sour sauce. So I tried to order the duck, but he again tried to dissuade me, saying at one point, \\"Try some chicken? General Tso?\\"\\n\\nI couldn't believe it.\\nMy Chinese waiter was trying to convince me to order not an old Cantonese specialty, but a dish that was likely invented in some Chinese restaurant's kitchen at the height of the disco era in Manhattan.\\nI pressed further about the duck, and he eventually relented and returned to the kitchen to submit the order, only to reappear at my table moments later to apologize for having no more duck.\\n\\"What's good,\\" I asked. \\"What do you like?\\"\\nHe shrugged his shoulders.\\n\\nFlustered, I asked for the House Fried Rice, which he, again, tried briefly to steer me away from, but in the end was what I got.\\nAnd this was how I met Kevin. Poor little Kevin. Sad Kevin. Tossed into a mound of rice, previously frozen chicken and char siu, there lay Kevin among a dozen or so other tiny shrimp.\\nOn another plate were some cubes of fried tofu mixed with frozen veggies and soaked in some manner of sweet oyster sauce gravy.

Two I lived a great chunk of my life here and in LA (which has a koreatown...) I've been going to Toji's even before they were finally \\"forced\\" to do AYCE (all you can eat) BBQ for their evening menu, since it was only AYCE for lunch. Ever so slowly their service has been getting worse and these completely unheard of rules started appearing. \\n\\nFor example today, the owner (who never smiles, if she doesn't want to run this business then don't...) told my family that she can only change out the grill once. REALLY?! So what happens to a lot of the folks that enjoy marinated meat? That tends to burn the grill after it's first round. Never heard of such nonsense at a Korean BBQ ever in LA or even non-AYCE places in Beaverton. So I called her out on it and her excuse was because it takes too much labor. \\n\\nI won't complain about the food quality because when you go to places like this where it's AYCE you really don't go for quality. This concept of AYCE is only happening now sadly while places in LA have been moving on and now do Korean BBQ based on quality USDA choice meat instead of AYCE.\\n\\nIronically for the people who have not experienced Korean BBQ or only have tried it a few times head over to K-Town BBQ since they have been doing well and progressed since their grand opening last summer. Only rule they really have is a 2 hour limit but I don't think that is even strictly enforced nor is it unfair. K-Town BBQ is the reason why Toji even extended it's AYCE to evening menus because of the competition so that's why I said \\"forced\\" up above. I only hope more places and ideas come up from LA to really give people the proper cultural experience, better quality restaurants, and create competitive prices.

The extra charge is worth it with the fresh garlic and cilantro added in. This naan is the perfect utensil for shoveling all the tasty Navaratan Korma goodness in your mouth, I promise you. \\n\\nOn my latest order I also got the vegetable samosa and it did not disappoint. It came with two different sauces and both were great. Don't hesitate to add this appetizer to your order. Their menu even says it's vegan, very cool. \\n\\nI will definitely be ordering from Haveli Bistro again and if you haven't tried it yet, don't let the 3.5 star rating fool you, this stuff is pretty darn good. I can't speak for the environment or service because I've only ordered delivery, but it's a great choice."},{"name":"Papa John's Pizza","address":"3653-C Flakes Mill Rd.","city":"Decatur","stars":"2","text":"Once a week.

On the food front, we got the vegan agadashi bowl (which my friends loved!), vegetarian omelette and I got the vegetarian benedict. The portions were good size, we asked for well done omelette but it was not, I asked for medium eggs on my benedict but they were over easy.

On bakery side, does have enough pastries to make your mouth water.  Wife and I got two coffees (Iced Vanilla Latte and a hot Mocha) and I got a Nutella Beignet.   The coffees weren't tasty probably due to having a bit too much milk and not enough flavor.  Can be corrected immediately by asking for more flavor.  Beignet was fresh and tasty.

We knew it was going to be expensive so we cut out the wine. We ended up with the following\\n\\nSplit a Cesar salad or is it Caesar lol\\n\\nCowboy ribeye for me and porterhouse for the wife \\n\\nSide of mac and cheese \\n\\nChocolate souffl√© for dessert. \\n\\nCost $150 with $30 tip. \\n\\nServer was good. But you got the feeling right away when we said no wine that he was disappointed bc that takes away a lot of his tip. The rest of the night he was just going through the motions. Nothing terrible but definitely didn't wow us. I know spending $150 is a drop in the bucket there considering they have whiskey shots for $185 but I really want to feel like I'm eating at an expensive place no matter how much I spend. \\n\\nThe food: we split the salad and it was an average salad . Can't mess that up too badly. Cowboy ribeye was ok but I have had better for cheaper. Basically if you want it seasoned you have to pay extra for their sauces. The wife had the porterhouse. I talked her into it bc she's a big filet fan. I probably should have just stayed quiet as the filet part was extremely small and the New York strip on it was very dry and didn't have much flavor. It just didn't stand out as a $53 steak. \\n\\nCoffee for the wife was reasonable coming in at $4.00 .. they put it in some kind of press pot where it holds the grinds at the bottom. She got 3 cups out of it. \\n\\nFor dessert we got the chocolate souffl√© coming in at $15.00. I have to say that was the best part of the meal and that is not a good thing when it's a steakhouse. \\n \\nMy overall feeling is this place was just average on a place where you have high expectations. You shouldn't feel like the server is disappointed that you are not spending 500-1000 but that was the impression we got. This will be the 1 and only time we go here. If it was called old hickory souffl√© and that was the main sale item, we would be back.

We got seated towards the back with all the giant tables with the lazy susans (my favorite!)\\n\\nFor a party of 11, we ordered two of every dish, with the exception of one. Unfortunately, their website isn't functional / doesn't have a menu, so I can't list the actual names with their prices, so I will do my best. \\n\\n_ dou miao (pea shoots) $11.95\\nI don't see this on the door dash menu, but I'm going to assume it's the sauteed snow peas. I did notice that their menu at the restaurant wasn't 100% standard naming conventions (mapo tofu, for example). I also didn't do the ordering, so I'm not totally sure what the English name was, I just remember hearing dou miao. Standard green vegetable and it's one that I always like to get when eating at a Chinese restaurant.\\n\\n_ mapo tofu $13.95\\nThis was named \\"Spicy Bean Curd with Pork\\" on the menu. I had a feeling that this was mapo tofu, so my bf and I looked up how to write it in Chinese, and sure enough, that's what this was. Mapo tofu was delicious. Always one of my go tos when I visit a Chinese restaurant for the first time. The tofu was soft and the spicy flavor was perfect. \\n\\n_ Fried pork cutlet $14.95 (potentially Spicy Salted Chops)\\nI'm not sure again, which dish this is on the menu, I assume spicy salted chops. But this was so good. The pork was nicely tenderized and very crispy and hot. Not spicy at all though. So if this IS that menu item, then yea, don't expect it to be spicy, but it could very well be something different on the menu. \\n\\n_ Fried Squid $16.95 (potentially Pan-fried spicy salted squid)\\nThis one was really good too, don't get me wrong, but compared to the fried pork cutlet, I didn't care for it as much. If we had not gotten the pork cutlet though, I think this would've been a star for sure. The pork cutlet though... that's what I remember more. \\n\\n_ beef and noodles $13.95 (potentially beef lo mein)\\nWe asked for it dry, so that the noodles and beef weren't swimming in sauce. Excellent call on my friend's part, because it made it much more enjoyable and felt significantly less heavy this way. Delicious.\\n\\nThe server was great.

The 'spicy tuna' mixture was bright red - if you can imagine a sushi roll that contains a slew of tomato paste/ketchup instead of a meat mixture while the jicama was plentiful and thickly cut. So essentially it was a gross, incredibly unappealing combination of really crunchy vegetable and super sweet-slightly spicy, squishy tomato sauce with little minced bits of tuna. It was also sloppily rolled, barely holding itself together as we picked it up. My poor boyfriend gave an attempt to defend the kitchen staff, \\"Maybe it's a new cook\\". Just no.

They serve wine, cocktails, and small plates.  Reservations can be made on the Disney App, and Open Table, but you can also walk in (easier said than done depending on the time of year).  \\nI love the wide selection of wine available.  There really is something for everyone and the bartenders are happy to let you try a sample before you commit to a whole glass.  Last night for example I tried a gruner veltliner which you don't see many of so the bartender happily poured me a sip first to make sure I liked it.  On another occasion I was looking for something sweet and the bartender recommended a muscat and when it wasn't to my liking he then poured me a Riesling that was more my style.  \\nMy husband likes wine, but is more of a cocktail guy and they have a selection of cocktails, but also a full bar so they can make whatever you desire.  \\nIf you are looking for a bite to eat I haven't had anything bad here.  The meatballs are great.  The burrata was delicious, but a little heavy on the tomatoes.  The mac n cheese bites were awesome.  The pork was yummy.  The chicken skewers were probably my least favorite, but were still good, just not as good as everything else I've had.  I haven't found anything that I wouldn't order again and there are still many more things to try.  \\nIt is a bit pricey, but you are at Disney Springs so I guess that is somewhat to be expected, but the prices of the small plates can add up fast, not to mention the wine.

They even have a selection that is more exclusive and expensive that they sell by the ounce.  \\nThe bartenders have been friendly and very knowledgeable, but I've had a couple servers who didn't know much about wine and that was a bit frustrating.

Service was fast and courteous and we were table touched by what looked to be a manager during lunch, so had we needed anything they would have been on it.  Server was a nice older lady who was prompt with everything and gave us a few heads up when we ordered.\\n\\nFor example, we started with pickle fries and she asked if we wanted her to go ahead and put them in now so the kitchen could get them started.  Pro-level move.  I can appreciate that she understands the timing of the kitchen during a potential lunch rush.\\n\\nThe pickle fries were meh.  They were definitely battered (true batter, not breading) in house, but I'm not understanding why Goldberg's just doesn't fry up the spears you get with your sandwich.  These were greasy and limp with the batter falling off.  The batter needs to be stiffer if you're going to fry pickle spears cut longways the size of french fries.  Like I've said before, frying food is truly an art form and I think Goldberg's may need to go back to the drawing board on these.\\n\\nWe both got sandwiches and planned to share the halves of each one.  I got the Famous Po' Boy and S.O. got the Brooklyn Reuben.  When I ordered the Po' Boy (Famous since 1972), the server asked if I wanted a side of mayo because the sandwich comes out dry.  This is where I probably should have asked a question or two, but I didn't and asked for some Russian dressing for it.  I got onion rings for my side, S.O. got coleslaw.\\n\\nFood comes out and the onion ring order is a platter-full.  Huge side order.  And definitely a frozen product (the battered kind you find in most diners).  The Reuben was okay, but I've never had so many caraway seeds in my sauerkraut before--it almost over powered the sandwich.  I've had better, but I've had worse too.\\n\\nPo' Boy comes out and it's...interesting to say the least.  First of all, it's a cold sandwich, but in the picture it looks toasty and warm (https://www.goldbergbagel.com/menu/deli-classics/).  Nowhere in the description does it say it's served cold, but that's fine--not what I expected but it's been a menu staple since the Nixon administration, so clearly it has a fan base.  But not only is it a cold sandwich, but it was CLEARLY made yesterday or the day before.  The whole thing is cold, including the bread.  I open it up to slather some Russian dressing on it and the pickle slices are almost dried up.  Blech.  This is the level of a gas station hoagie.  Famous since 1972, huh?  Is that when this thing was made?  You should be ashamed to serve this thing and I feel like an idiot for falling for the \\"famous\\" branding.\\n\\nThe food is cheap, so I guess you get what you pay for.

The only reason I didn't give them 5 stars is because my boyfriend got the pasta Primavera and although it was tasty it was drenched in too much oil that he even had to drain it. Another thing is our pasta cane with 2 piece of bread each that they just threw in the bag on top of our pasta. I wish they had wrapped it first because taking out our meals was messy as bread crumbs were scattered everywhere. Overall this place has really good food. I'll definitely be ordering from here again!"},{"name":"Yuzu","address":"4130 SW 117th Ave, Ste H","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"If you're dying to visit Japan or pining for traditional izakaya food but can't figure out how to swing it on an imaginary travel budget you may just have gotten your wish.  That is, if you can find this not so supersecret izakaya.  There's no signage but at least they've painted their name very unobtrusively on the front door.  Just go to the Canyon Square Mall on Canyon & 117th & it's the dark space next to the Korean restaurant with Best Teriyaki on the far end.\\n\\nFor those of you who've been to traditional izakaya, stop reading & just get thee to Beaverton.  (Whoever thought I would write that??)  For the rest of you.  Think of the classic Japanese salaryman who toils away in the city, the city that is a 2h sardine can commute away from home & working unpaid overtime is the norm.  No better way to avoid karoshi then to take a breather at your local pub with plenty of booze & nibbles, right?\\n\\nNibbles: no fusion cuisine here, just very traditional small plates meant for sharing.  For you eggplant lovers try the yakinasu: grilled eggplant with bonita flakes & ground ginger.  If you're beer drinkers, check out the tori no kara-age: succulent chunks of chicken marinated in a soy-ginger sauce, dredged in potato starch then flash fried.  Don't forget to squeeze some lemon over it!  For the adventurous who want to give your TMJ a work out, try the konnyaku: sweet potato jelly cake made savory with soy sauce, it has a very chewy consistency like chicken hearts.  As for the ramen, it's the best I've had in the US.  Fresh chewy ramen, savory pork or soy broth that's not greasy, & a good balance of wakame, green onion, & meat.  The char-siu with egg won my heart over the katsu-ramen & I haven't even tried the tempura udon yet!  Next time we get the butakaku: tender pork belly in a sweet ginger soy sauce, we'll know to order a side of rice to slurp up the extra sauce.  [drool]  At this point we were about to reenact the restaurant scene from The Meaning Of Life but that didn't stop us from sampling the gyu negi: beef flank steak wrapped around green onion in a teriyaki sauce, then cut  & displayed like a sushi roll.  Kawaii!  The beef was a bit tough but otherwise great flavors.  Shared a tokurri of Murai Family Tokeubetsu Honjozo sake which had a light, slightly sweet citrus finish.  I wish I could find Kubota Hekijyu junmai daiginjo in PDX but that's another story.  \\n\\n$64 + tip for 4 stuffed, happy people regaling each other with wolf's tales, bizarre international delicacies, & state of the art techno toys while the proprietors showed off their golf-clubs to the regulars.  So get thee to Beaverton & do your part in preventing karoshi.  http://static.px.yelp.com/photo/S3UoY7a5RbgrrpPF6RuzxQ/l"},{"name":"El Arroyo 5th Street","address":"1624 W 5th St","city":"Austin","stars":"2.5","text":"They need to close this down.

I brought clients out to discuss business and was hoping for a great outcome, however this was the worst experience I've had at any Orlando steakhouse. I was embarrassed by the staffs knowledge, service and communication. There are to many excellent fine dining establishments in the area and this will certainly be the last time I go to Del Frisco's. My first experience here was terrible as well so I thought a second time may be worth it since I was nearby at the annual Workers Compensation conference. For one our server Ronnie, whom initially approached the table to tell us he was our server was absent merely the entire time. He greeted our table awkwardly and literally never came back. He instead led his trainee in the dark and never even came to help him or approach our table during all the misunderstanding and stood to the side seemingly flustered , and had his trainee do all the work at our table leaving him to deal with issues without any guidance. We ordered drinks and the Sommeliers suggestions about wine were questionable and when asked for a dry oaky wine. I received a sweet smooth wine with no tannins and little to no oak flavor what so ever but because of all the misunderstanding already I decided not to mention the drink selection . I asked for a wine to pair with a strip and received a light bodied wine with little to no finish. The table ordered a filet, NY Strip and a ribeye. The food runner brought two NY Strips and a filet and told me that one of the NY Strips was a Ribeye. Surprised that the food runner was uninformed of the food he was serving, we proceeded to inform the staff of this and the staff had my guests cut into their steaks which were medium well to well done when they were ordered as medium rare. Nonetheless, all the steaks and food were brought back to the kitchen where we waited another 20 minutes. The second try came out and the sides were cold, the NY Strip was overdone again and the ribeye had a nice piece of  hair on it to compliment the steak. This was just delightful. The server, Ronnie never came back to the table and I was embarrassed for him being in the industry myself. However for his trainee Stephen, I commend him for making the situation right and taking the initiative to make sure that he was doing all he could to make the situation right. He was polite and attentive and given the circumstances did a great job at handling the situation. This was a complete let down and sadly, I nor anyone in my party will be returning to Del Frisco's. There are many better options nearby.

It's nice to know that it was a clean glass, but that's a bit much.\\n\\nAs for that first appetizer? Chicken karaage. It was thigh meat, which I actually tend to like, but normally they'll tell you if it's not breast meat. It was actually pretty tasty, but it was not karaage. It was good, marinated chicken, more at home on a skewer than pretending to be fried at all. Sad trombone. Strike two was that I went for the entree version (because, say it with me, I'm a glutton) and it was about the size of a generous appetizer portion. Not recommended. \\n\\nNext, shishito peppers. Fine. Nothing to complain about, well-enough seasoned with flaky salt and oil, but definitely the least interesting of any I've had in Portland, and it's available in an awful lot of places. \\n\\nAlmost immediately, our burgers arrived. Asked for more (bottled) beers, and I had finished my burger before they arrived. The burger was nice, but for twenty dollars, it was a bit of a farce. Very scant amount of ch√®vre, but that's probably something you don't want to overdo. The five-dollar \\"jidori\\" egg? You could get four dozen at Freddie's for the price, and if you know from a spatula, you could serve them better. Mine was over-hard, thus not contributing much to the burger. The shoestring fries adoring the burger looked nice, but tasted a little acrid. If this burger was ten bucks, and available at a dive bar I liked drinking in, I'd probably order it again. As it stands, Portland has far too many better burgers to make me want another of this one. \\n\\nFinally, I had inquired with our server about something not on the menu and got no answer. (I was asking about natto, and knew it was a long shot.) Asked another server and he suggested ume instead, which was sweet of him, but quite a bit of a non sequitur. I got a tuna hand roll instead (glutton) and it arrived fairly soggy, as if it had sat for a bit on its journey to me. It was bland, but sizable (7$).\\n\\nBasically I'm giving this place two stars because the burger was definitely worth eating (if not buying) and because I like that they offer health care to their staff, otherwise it would have been a pretty terrible experience, given the expense and aggravation. Maybe they had an off-night, but I cannot recommend Yakuza at all."},{"name":"Rogue Eastside Pub & Pilot Brewery","address":"928 SE 9th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"What the hell?

It's spicy because it has quite some chilli oil in the soup. Yet, it's so aromatic that I can't stop eating.\\n\\nThe tan tan noodle is not the usual one with peanut butter but with mean and garlic. Of course lots of spicy sauce/oil to give you the chengdu style flavour.\\n\\nWhat we like a lot including our little one is their buns.

Why the 4-star rating down to a 1-star rating, you ask? It has nothing to do with the food. The food is still delicious and consistent. I'm miffed about this restaurant's business practice for a couple of reasons:\\n\\n1. Last time we were here we ordered a couple of soft-boiled eggs to go with our ramen as this was not included, but as an add-on topping for $1 each. Three months later this add-on now costs me $1.50 per egg. Why?! Does this mean if I come back in another 3 months, the egg will cost me $2?! I was just at the market and I did not see any increase in price on eggs and I buy pasture-raised eggs! \\n\\n2. The restaurant's Yelp page offers a free topping if you check-in. But wait for it... it comes with a stipulation--you have to write them a review first in order to get this free topping. But let's face it... if I go in there and show the proprietor my 1-star review, will she give me that free topping? Seriously. So, I had to show her my review from three months earlier. She comped my soft-boiled egg but not my husband's because he did not write a review.

We had heard great things about the infamous \\"yakuza burger\\".  So we ordered a pair of those, their hamachi sashimi (as an appetizer), and a spicy tuna roll for good measure.\\n1. Hamachi Sashimi was served nicely with some blood orange and pomegranate with its own sauce which made it quite nice.  There were 5 pieces of fish (a little on the smaller side but expected for eating in the city).\\n2. Spicy tuna roll... Quite different from a traditional Japanese restaurant.  I will say that I have a very good tolerance for spicy food, and I don't know if they mixed the roll up with their \\"extra spicy\\" roll but the chili's they used were almost unbearably hot.  We managed to eat the entire roll, but all that being said I wouldn't order it again.  Coming from a pure blood Japanese man, and a pure blood Korean woman (who loves super spicy food), order their spicy stuff with caution.  It's not the same kind of spicy one expects at an Asian restaurant... More of a Thai or Latin spicy.\\n3.  The yakuza burger... I don't have much to say other than it was about average and from a guy who has eaten a lot of burgers (in n out, five guys, killer burger, umami burger etc.) this burger was not anything terribly special for the $15 price tag.  The flavoring was good, had a unique taste and was cooked well.  \\nAt the end of the day, it may have been a combination of the hype and my higher expectations, but I'm going to deem this a mediocre experience... The staff was very friendly and attentive, albeit a little slow on the water and soda refills for a 80% empty restaurant.  We had a gift card we got for signing up for Comcast back in September so the $64 (pre-tip) bill was completely covered (even including the 5% wellness tax for the employees which I do wholeheartedly support).  \\nBottom Line~ worth a try if u are looking for something different and willing to spend some dough?

However, in Portland, I've noticed that usually they are food CARTS.  Any many of them!  With only a little over a full day in Oregon, our food choices had to be smart.  We went to the Carts On Foster lot, which was the home of several food carts that rated really high.  \\n\\nNow, my original goal was to eat at the Bari Food Cart as a snack in between lunch and dinner.  Their signature Panzerotti looked too good to miss.  And, original at that, because I have never seen this Italian dish before.\\n\\nSo, before I continue, I guess I should explain a little what a Panzerotti is.  Thing of a calzone, but instead of being made with pizza dough, it's made with a light, airy, crispy, and slightly-chewy outer layer.  And, it's deep fried instead of baked.  I want to compare it to McDonalds pies when they were fried (I guess that shows my age), but that wouldn't be doing it justice.\\n\\nAnyway, we got there and there and were perusing the menu when the owner, Walter (more on him later), let us know that he was all out of the small size Panzerottis and it would take another 30-45 minutes for more.  Bummer, because we wanted to try a few, and because we got something else to try at another cart.  No problem though.  We got a large Pepperoni to split.  The pepperoni was so good that we waited the 30 minutes to try a few more:  Pomodoro and Pesto.  Both were just as good as the first one.  The Pomodoro was made with tomato and FRESH mozzarella, which makes a huge difference!  My only wish was that it had fresh basil.  But, to be honest, I got my basil fix from the Pesto Panzerotti, which is made with a basil pesto.\\n\\nI didn't want to miss my only dinner meal in Portland, so I had to stop myself from ordering more.  If not, I would've tried all the different Panzerottis.  No seriously.\\n\\nAs for Walter, he is the coolest guy around!  If I wasn't so hungry, and he wasn't so busy making these delicious things, I could've just stood there and talked to this guy for hours.  Even with his heavy Italian accent, I understood every word he said, and he is just so personable.   He didn't seem fake like he was just being nice just because I was a customer.  He's a genuine nice guy!  There's not many of us.  :)\\n\\nIf you're a newbie to the Portland area and looking to try one of their famous food carts, don't hesitate to come here.

They were also unfortunately waaaay over cooked.\\n¬∑        Tomatoes.  They should be lightly fried so that they still retain shape and texture. These were also well over cooked.\\n¬∑        Eggs. Very nicely cooked\\n¬∑        Fried bread - Outstanding that they fry the bread and not simply use toast. This is a very British aspect to the breakfast and brownie points should be awarded. The bread was nicely fried too. I would suggest using 'bigger' slices of bread though\\n¬∑        Mushrooms. Very nicely cooked\\n \\nMissing - Baked beans and black pudding. Both rather essential to the full English breakfast!\\n \\nCost - Way over priced!  In Boston they do a truly fantastic full English/Irish breakfast that has all the trimmings and the size is enormous!! I have failed to complete my plate on a couple occasions. They charged $9.95 for theirs and I would easily pay $15 for the amount of quality. The Full English here cost $12!  There was a cheaper version for $8 but it only had 1 of each item instead of the 2 that came with mine. \\n \\nCornish pasty - The size, shape and filling all appeared to be accurate. I think the only and main issue was simply the taste and seasoning, or lack of both I should say.  My nan used to make them for a living, I used to eat hers every chance I got.\\n\\nI hope the British owners do an inspection of the quantity and quality of their Full English plates and pasties. Provided this classic meal bears the restaurant's namesake, we hope to return again with the promise of a TRUE, AUTHENTIC Full English experience."},{"name":"Dante's","address":"350 W Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"This review is solely for their pizza. \\n\\nAfter eating gyros and chicken all weekend we were dying for something different and what's a better option than pizza. We ended up getting a whole combo pie for $28 split among 6 people and it was definitely enough. \\n\\nThere was no line for us around 10PM on a Sunday night so we went straight to the window. Ordering is a bit confusing since the server made it seem that we could get as many toppings we wanted but eventually said we could only order 2 meats/2 veggies. The wait for the pizza is about 20 mins so feel free to walk around the area to kill time. \\n\\nTHE PIZZA: They cut the pizza into huge slices so each slice is basically 2. I'm a pizza fanatic so I had high expectations and sadly this place didn't quite hit the spot but it works when you're drinking. The pizza crust isn't that crispy and is on the softer side.

It was only 50 cents extra which is a small price to pay to try something new. I did like the snow bean though and I definitely want to go back to try more flavors. The coffee was also really good, and I love their to go cups! The top is almost like a sippy cup which makes it really easy to drink out of with minimal spills.

However there was apparently a wait for a patio table, which was sad.  But there were TWO empty tables, so we were given a table after all, which was nice!  But then all waitstaff very pointedly ignored us for a good ten minutes after that.  Possibly longer, because I remarked to my group, \\"Did we die on the way here and no one can even see us?\\"  It was kind of nuts, but I was starving so we stuck around.\\n\\nEventually someone came to get our drinks and asked for our food order, but we didn't even have menus.  I wish we'd known enough to just guess, because the waitress took that opportunity to not come back for a while.  We ordered two apps and a couple beers.  The flaming cheese that according to the menu is NOT DIP is very remarkably similar to cheese dip, only the cheese was much faker.  Like, it stuck to the roof of my mouth much like velveeta would.  We also got the southern poutine which was insanely messy, but very tasty.\\n\\nI got a burger, my husband got wings, and my friend got a burger also.  The burgers were tasty but on the small side.  Think Grindhouse-sized.  I got mac and cheese for a side and it was really good but would have been better if it were hot.  My friend liked her burger and my husb liked his wings, though he said they were under-sauced.  Overall the food was decent but not crave-worthy.  It is worth noting that they probably deep fry their bacon as it's curly and not straight and completely crispy. Personally I like a higher quality, chewier bacon, but maybe you're into that sort of thing.  I don't know your life.\\n\\nThe server was eventually much friendlier but by then I didn't care anymore.  The whole visit was probably around 2 hours, and it should have been half that.  It seemed like everyone was running around completely overwhelmed, and from a cursory look I'd say the servers each had too many tables.

I also watched the two other tables get the bread and ricotta spread delivered immediately whereas I had to ask for ours (the beginning of a long night of lackluster service). The ricotta ball was cold and the whole thing was less flavorful than last time. We ordered the Arancini, seafood Fritto misto, crab bruschetta and pork meatballs. The meatballs were TINY and also, weirdly different sizes. I'm assuming they're hand made but come on. The sizes were all over the place. The seafood misto which I LOVED last time was horrible- we had three shrimp, a few rings of calamari and the rest was shaved pieces of zucchini and sweet potato and onion I think, most of which had been fried into a giant congealed piece.

She dropped those and disappeared- someone else brought our pasta out and we were still sitting there with piles of dirty app plates, bread plates and silverware. We had to ask another server to please bring us fresh plates. The risotto was good but lord- I thought the portions were small in my previous review, well, they've shrunk more. The mezzaluna was a JOKE- I think someone literally forgot to put filling in it. See photo for evidence.\\n\\nSo to sum this up, had it not been HH prices the meal would have been ONE HUNDRED AND NINETY DOLLARS WHICH IS A JOKE. So, go, but only for HH. The portions are too small and quality sooo inconsistent. Like Olive anD June You have the makings of a fantastic spot but LOWER YOUR PRICES or up the portions and I suggest you start stuffing your mezzaluna!!

Maybe because it's not a coffee drink, don't know. But it tasted very watered down, just a hint of chai without the spice flavors I love. I sweetened it a bit and could taste it a bit more, but still not what I was wanting. \\n\\nI'll come back and maybe try coffee. I still drink it, just not as much as I used to.

Ok,  wine is not your strong suit. I ordered a celebration whiskey,  we all joked about the big ice cube... never got that drink,  never got to experience the big ice cube,  hearts were broken. Maybe I should ask for it you say? We saw our server about 3x total after that,  and none of those times had service in mind, I just wanted to make sure I moved enough for her to hastily brush my table of crumbs in such a mechnical forceful way. \\n\\nNext was dinner recommendations,  she again clumsily read directly from menu,  with obviously no knowledge of what she was serving,  this is why tips should be built in to the cost,  I feel obligated to tip this person for her guidance and expertise,  she had neither. \\n\\nAfter ordering an appetizer,  she hurdily asked for our menus,  maybe after we order? Nope she really wanted them,  so she left one. \\n\\nShe was a mechanical busser turning from table to table in our section taking mass orders in one fell swoop, classy, having her read descriptions off our menu then turning to the couple next to us and mechanically clearing plates off both our tables at once,  this is obvs 1st world problems,  but in the first world where you pay 190$ for a 2 top and expected to and do leave a 40$ tip,  well I want 1st world problems service I guess. \\n\\nOverall we felt rushed,  there was no knowledge transfer or expertise of anything on the menu from wine to food to drinks,  and we were so meh'd by our servers meh,  we didnt want to rock the apple cart and actuallly tell her our pasta was nearly inedible from a heavy salting hand, she may have explored why we ate 3 bites and let the plate go uneaten,  but that would require some 'court awareness' on her part,  lets just say she missed a couple of wide open passes for layins. \\n\\nWe will be back,  we will sit at the bar and treat it like the food truck service we got,  just give em your order,  bring the food,  eat the food,  pay the bill.

The reason for the visit yesterday was Skogsta. Remember that name. It's their line of acacia wood products. I've been eyeing it since last year. I decided after sitting on our crappy chairs at home, it was time to suck it up and buy it. There was no deal going on. I simply couldn't wait until the next 3 chairs and get the 4th free. My butt couldn't wait anymore. It needed a decent chair at the dining table. \\n\\nWe picked up two chairs and cringed at the price. I had to keep telling myself \\"Remember, $69.99 is pennies compared to how much regular crappy mdf veneer chairs cost. You'll pay more everywhere else for solid acacia wood. Don't cry...pay it once and don't look back.\\" We also got two stools because growing up in Asia...we didn't have chair backs. Stools sit more people around a round table. Apparently not everyone loves stools so I just got one for my own butt. My guests can enjoy chairs with backs and all. \\n\\nAnyway, we were annoyed at the computer because it said they had 2 more benches in stock. Often the computer is wrong. You're safe if it says 5+ items. I find anything under is a hit or miss. Sometimes vindictive or lazy people hide them for later or toss them aside anywhere in the store if they change their mind. I've been two times in recent memory where my \\"in stock\\" items were both nowhere to be found. FML that meant another visit, then another until I got my hands on it. \\n\\nI LOVE these chairs and the stool. They're so beautiful. Now I want the table.

I ordered the pulled pork, ribs, mac and cheese, and salad. The meat was superb. At first, I ate it without the provided BBQ sauce because I forgot they existed, but even without the added sauce, the meat was delicious. Very juicy and tender. The mac and cheese had a whole lot of extra panko crumbs that I ended up scrapping off. The actual mac and cheese was good--however after eating into it longer, it tasted kind of like velveeta. The salad was okay but that was only after I removed the Brussels sprouts which tasted like chlorine. I also ordered a biscuit which came with honey butter. That was probably the best part of the meal. I ended up paying like $30 something for this whole meal.

Only about 3 of the tables are fully covered. The restaurant is community seating so we sandwiched ourselves in between 2 other couples at a 6 top. Not a big deal - we lived in New York for a few years where communal seating is pretty normal. \\n\\nBy about 1:15 they were out of Eggs Benedict, Biscuits and Gravy, Quiche, and the Hash... plus the beignets.

Part of my lackluster impression can be blamed on me: I didn't realize it was an authentic ( I guess?) German seating arrangement with long tables that must be awkwardly shared with strangers. It's also super loud, to the point where conversation is nearly impossible during peak hours. It's also very crowded and an uncomfortable space to navigate through.  If you don't mind any of the above-or even thrive on it-then this could be your jam.\\n\\nAlas, an environment that was not in sync with my uptight American sensibilities was only the beginning.  The only beer available is Hofbrauhaus brewed. I ordered the Hefe Weizen, after being told it was akin to a Blue Moon (to be fair, someone at the table told me this, not our server who was too harried to dilly dally.) I did not find it Blue Moon-analogous. What I did find was that it was bitter to the core and simply undrinkable. I am many things, but a person who wastes beer or sends things back I am not. \\n\\nWhen our server arrived, I told him he could take the still full glass away, as I didn't like it. Which he did, no questions asked.  This bugs. They can't ask what the problem was, or Gott forbid offer something else? I can't even remember the last time I sent something back, if ever. Do they NOT do this anymore? Finding no non-Hofbrauhaus beers on the menu (at least on the menu I had) and a server who couldn't be assed, I skipped beer and just split some appetizers. \\n\\nThe good news is the food was pretty good --we shared some pretzels and potato pancakes. But I didn't go there for food. I went there to drink like the freakishly short German that people frequently say I resemble (danke shon, my tiny Irish ancestors.)  Instead, I left with a gut uncomfortably full of pretzel salt and regret. \\n\\n(And also with an uncomfortably full bladder because I could not bring myself to hack through the near impenetrable sea of sweaty bodies to get to the restroom.)\\n\\nI wouldn't voluntarily return. \\n\\nTL;DR: very loud, very crowded, did not love the beer or service.

We came in around 9 and ordered several appetizers plus entrees for the 4 of us.  We ate later than usual because of a movie.  The entrees came out either with or before the appetizers.  We tried to cancel some of the appetizers that weren't delivered when we got our entrees,  but our waiter said it was too late.  He should have either warned us from ordering so many apps or else made sure that the dishes came in their proper order.  Instead we had a table loaded with everything at once. He didn't seem the least bit sorry.   We had to ask for more water and wait for at least 10 minutes before the bus boy finally brought some.   The impression this restaurant gives is that they could care less about us as patrons, though they seemed to be very attentive to some diners.  Perhaps they only treat their regulars well, something we will never be, based upon this experience.  High prices plus lousy service do not a winning combination make.

The agedashi tofu was actually quite decent and the portion size was pretty generous. I got Yuzu's signature Kakuni ramen as my main dish and it was actually quite good! I have high expectations for ramen and Yuzu did not disappoint. I liked the texture of the noodles that were used-they were more on the firmer side. The broth was nice and rich, but not overly so.

There is ample tables and seating with outdoor seating available.  The interior design is Rustic Contemporary with a slight Industrial touch.  As many individuals that flow through here, this Starbucks is relatively clean, and seems to be kept quite clean throughout the day.\\n4.5 out 5\\n\\nCustomer Service - \\nFor any business, Customer Service is a VERY BIG DEAL to me as a consumer.  And, it should be to you, as well.  This Starbucks does meet a base standard, but that being said, this is Starbucks.  Despite being busy, the Customer Service should and could be better.\\n3.0 out of 5\\n\\nStaff Friendliness - \\nUsually you are addressed with a greeting when coming in, unless it's busy.  And, when they are, you are obviously greeted accordingly at the register.  For the most part, the Starbucks staff don't come off as snooty or anything, and occasionally, I have witnessed them engaged in small talk with the most frequented customers.\\n3.5 out of 5\\n\\nBathroom - \\nNow, this is often an overlooked area of many businesses.  Bathrooms are an important part of a consumer's experience.  Besides the obvious usage, the bathroom also has an affect on the senses and is also where people wash their hands.  As many Starbucks that I've been to, this one isn't as clean nor as well kept.  Understandably, it is opened to the public and is often used by the homeless and transients, but bathrooms need attention. \\n2.5 out of 5\\n\\nProduct - \\nNow onto the product.  The reason why I visit Starbucks when I am in the mood for a coffee or espresso drink, for the most part, is the consistency.  I often order an iced Americano or an iced Caramel Macchiato.

(Note: although we couldn't dim sum cart service, we were still able to order from the dim sum menu) \\n\\nFrom my understanding the menu rotates, but nothing stood out to me. The food was ok, nothing blew me away. I think we ordered 6 plates total. The spaghetti pasta was a little undercooked and you maybe got 3-4 bites out of it for $16. The desert was ok too. My cocktail was small, maybe 4oz. My bf spent a lot of money here for the two of us and we were still hungry. Treated him to Banger's shortly after. \\n\\nFor being named one of the best new restaurants from a prestigious magazine, I was a little disappointed. I do want to come back, but I'll be sure to come when the menu stands out to me.

They kicked out my friends because we had one extra person that showed up and they said we could not pull up a chair. \\"You have to wait for another table if you have 7 people instead of 6.\\" Then when I tried to order a yazi daquiri my waiter scolded me saying \\"that will take the bartender too long\\" (its on the menu so...). I also tried to order what I get every time I go to cazuelas (a chalupa with beans instead of meat because I'm a vegetarian) and he told me they could not substitute beans for meat and  that I would have to order something else. I was very disappointed overall. My friends couldn't eat with us and the waiter was fighting me on every single thing I ordered. He also didn't bring us chips until we asked for them.

I wanted to try some of their Chinese dishes here prior to taking the bus back to Seattle. The keyword being try. Instead I had an almost Japanese breakfast.\\n\\nSince I arrived just before 11 am, they were still serving breakfast. I decided to give them a try rather than look for another place nearby to eat. The breakfast menu is limited. On the plus side if you are looking for a Western breakfast, they have this here. Though it seemed mostly of the typical eggs and bacon type stuff. But consider it a plus that they have Spam and Arabiki sausage.\\n\\nThere were also a few Asian selections. Most of them were different types of congee and then there was the Zen breakfast set ($13.95) which seemed the most untypical of the selections and the one that stood out to me. I decided to explore this dish. I enjoyed some Illy coffee ($2.75) while I awaited my meal.\\n\\nThe interior of this restaurant is modern with an Asian flair to it. There seems to be two bar areas. One to the left of the restaurant and then one inside the main dining room.\\n\\nMy meal was served in numerous small plates rather than on a bento tray. Items include the fish of the day (salmon in my case), pieces of nori, miso soup, tamago (labeled as egg roll on the menu), umi, firm tofu with ginger and rice (choice of white or brown). There was also a bowl of plain congee which is Chinese and the likely reason this meal is not labeled as a Japanese breakfast.\\n\\nFor the most part, the meal was enjoyable. This was a healthier breakfast option than going for the eggs-bacon fare. I would have liked a larger portion of salmon and had something other than soy sauce to flavor the congee like sriracha sauce.

I'm going to Disney World!\\n\\nThe girlfriend was in Orlando all week working. Tagging along later in the week, I was unencumbered by such mundane concerns. By Friday night, she was pretty beat & ready to unwind. Since we were staying at Disney's BoardWalk Inn, we stayed close for our 1st dinner together in Orlando. Kouzzina is right on the BoardWalk & is a Cat Cora restaurant. To find out if the Chairman would approve of 1 of his Iron Chef's efforts, we gave it a shot.\\n\\nKouzzina's decor is intimate & rustic. Even pretty late, it was still busy but it only took a few minutes for us to be seated. Our server was nice, attentive & humorously quirky. Looking to expedite the unwinding process, the girlfriend ordered a round of Metaxa Ouzos. I added a Greek Island Iced Tea, which is like a Long Island but adds Ouzo. Chilled Ouzo shots make for a great aperitif & I liked the anise flavor twist of the Greek Island Iced Tea.\\n\\nFor a starter, we ordered the Crisp Calamari with Lemon. The girlfriend ordered Slow-cooked Lamb Shank served with Oven-baked Gigantes Beans & Pepper Sauce & I ordered Greek-style Lasagna with Bucatini Pasta, Cinnamon-stewed Meat Sauce & Bechamel (Pastitsio). Shortly after ordering, our server brought us bread with 3 olive oils.\\n\\nThe bread was good & the olive oils were intriguing. Each of the 3 had a unique flavor that was distinct from the other 2, but still unmistakeably olive oil. While contemplating the olive oils, our Crisp Calamari with Lemon came. It's basically fried calamari served with sliced thin fried lemon circles. The fried calamari pieces were perfectly prepared with a wonderful, delicate, thin crispy fried shell. The fried lemon circles were sour, of course, but added a nice flavor element when eaten in the same bite as the fried calamari.\\n\\nNot long after finishing our Crisp Calamari with Lemon, our entrees arrived. The girlfriend's Lamb Shank was a seriously big piece of meat. My Greek-style Lasagna was presented in a deceptively not-so-big looking ramekin. Our server warned us more than once that Kouzzina's Greek-style Lasagna was very heavy & filling dish. I scoffed. It certainly didn't look intimidating to me inside its cute ramekin.\\n\\nBoy was I wrong. Kouzzina's Greek-style Lasagna is like the titanic spawn of lasagna bred with mac & cheese.  So much cheese. So much creamy, heavy cheese along with macaroni-esque bucatini pasta + cinammon & anise flavors mixed into the meat sauce. The weight of this dish could easily smite the stomachs of the Gods.\\n\\nIts comforting yumminess only spurred on complete & total consumption. In the end, I was condemned to a fate of food coma oblivion. Before being dispatched by my Greek-style Lasagna, I tried some the girlfriend's Lamb Shank. It was tender, moist, falling off the bone & absolutely delicious. In addition to actually being even more flavorful than the Greek-style Lasagna, it was the more sensible, less debilitating dish.\\n\\nFor the girlfriend, dinner at Kouzzina was a relaxing & satisfying way to decompress from the work week & start the weekend. For myself, my 1st Disney World dinner at Kouzzina was an exercise in overindulgence. Given the grandiosity of all things Disney in Orlando, overindulgence was the appropriate way to kick off my long Disney World weekend."},{"name":"Caffe Paradiso","address":"255 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"After so many Starbucks coffees, I'd forgot what quality coffee tastes like, namely cappuccinos.

Best Italian in general, best artisan pizza, best handmade pasta, all with a super fun, eclectic cocktail list with all menus constantly changing. And I have to say, everyone was very much right. Renata hit all of those marks, plus one everyone failed to mention: best seasonal fare! It's like I ate all of the best parts of summer for dinner last night.\\n\\nThe hubby and I shared the tomato-melon salad, the mais pizza (with corn, arugula, cherry tomatoes, and mozzarella), and the pappardelle (with braised duck ragu). The salad had the best tasting watermelon I've ever experienced, and was so refreshing. The perfect start to the meal, and a very generous portion that could easily be shared by up to four people. The pizza I swear used whole wheat flour, and had the perfect chew. It was softer, in the way of Napoli pizza. The pasta was remarkable, and so perfectly made. Handmade pasta is an art that takes a long time to learn, and the expertise was very well-demonstrated by the chefs! \\n\\nFor dessert, we shared some olive oil cake and cannoli. Both were so wonderful, but the cannoli stole the show. Dessert isn't to be missed. So save some room! Oh, and the bread is made in-house. It's served warm and is fabulous. Get the bread. Do it. DO IT. Besides, you'll want to try one or two of their ever-changing cocktails and you'll need something to soak up all that liquor!\\n\\nI can't wait to come back in the fall to be able to try that menu. It's so great when a restaurant is able to perfectly encapsulate multiple themes. Until Renata, I thought Nostrana was the best Italian in the city. And in many ways, Nostrana is a great restaurant.

Apparently Jim & Patty's is iconic for their mochas, so I opted for the habanero mocha. \\n\\nTheir 12 oz mocha was definitely huge by normal standards for some reason--plus there were two chocolate-covered espresso beans tucked in the saucer, which was a nice touch. The mocha had a FIERY kick. Like I took a sip and nearly started wheezing. Actually, no, I started wheezing for sure. Now that's a flaming mocha. I enjoyed that a lot, and I loved the way the chocolate with the habanero pepper and cinnamon created a silky yet spicy blend. \\n\\nThe coffee cake was massive, and could easily feed two people. Huge chunks of crusty cinnamon sugar bits studded a layer of marionberry, and then there was a large layer of the cake itself. The cake was buttery and slightly dense, and overall this was delicious. Still, I wish it had been heated a little and that there was more marionberry to balance out the cake and crust--but I can see why J & P's coffee cake is so famous. \\n\\nI'm on a mission to explore every notable coffee shop in the west side of town--and so far I've been much pleased!

Not even close.\\n\\nHawaii has the best Poke. Period. Full stop.  Even the Poke they have at the ABC convenience stores are head and shoulders about every Poke bowl I've had in Canada. Places like Pacific Poke try to capitalize on the surging popularity of Hawaiian Poke by putting their own spin on presentation and taste.  \\n\\nI tried a \\"Keto\\" Bowl (\\"ahi\\" tuna, ahi negitoro, miso black truffle vinaigrette, shoyu ramen egg, ginger jicama, avocado, nori and wasabi peas).  The tuna was a paler shade of pink/beige which is one of the indicators that it is lower grade.  The ahi tuna in Hawaiian Poke, even the cheap ones, are always red, even crimson.  We ordered ours on brown rice, but in hindsight, we should have ordered it with something with less carbs such as quinoa or kale.  Taste-wise, it neither excited nor offended.  For something called \\"Keto\\", I felt the tuna should have been way fattier.  \\n\\nThe next bowl we tried was the \\"Cali\\" Bowl which featured spicy sockeye salmon, crab & shrimp, pickled red onions, organic seaweed salad, avocado, nori and spicy mayo.  The sockeye salmon was better than the tuna, probably because salmon are indigenous to BC's coast. I couldn't tell if the \\"crab & shrimp\\" was the real thing, or imitation versions because of the way it was mixed in.  It looked very colorful and attractive. Again, the taste was okay, but forgettable.  \\n\\nPrice-wise, we paid almost $40 after tax and tip for two bowls.  This is an alarming figure.  When you go get sushi, you are paying for the ingredients, but also for the skill of a sushi chef to assemble said ingredients into a maki or nigiri.  That skill often requires years to master, so sushi chefs are obviously not paid minimum wage.  Poke bowl practitioners, on the other hand, only need to dole out the required quantities of ingredients into a bowl using pre-measured scoops.  They're like Subway Sandwich \\"artists\\".  Poke bowl restaurants should be democratizing the \\"sushi\\" experience by making \\"sushi-like food\\" more affordable for everyone.  But, I imagine that these places are very lucrative because the prices are high, and the labour is cheap, meaning a large profit margin.  At $40 for two people, I'd rather go to a sushi place.  But, if the bowls were in the $10-$12 range, Poke places like this would be a terrific value.\\n\\nIf you want terrific Poke, go to Hawaii.

I ordered kung pao squid, confirmed 2x while ordering and pointing at the menu, and still got Kung Pao chicken. I wasted half my dinner eating it before I noticed (all I noticed was it wasn't appetizing, I hated eating it, I had nothing but chicken for 3 days and did NOT want chicken again tonight). When I brought it up to the waitress and asked for the manager, she didn't bring the manager. When they corrected it, they charged for kung pao squid ($2 more) even though its technically leftovers at this point and I might not eat it. They also balked at giving rice to go with it (half the rice given with the meal ended up being eaten with the chicken) and when I MADE them comp it the waitress was obviously annoyed by my request.\\n\\nI'm sorry if I sound spoiled, but if I'm dropping $25 on food like this I should at least get what I ordered. Why spend that kind of money on a bad meal? If I wanted bad chinese food I'd order from the craphole across the street from me and it'd at least be cheaper to make up for the quality!

But our waiter was very good about placing the orders up front, so at the strike of the clock at 12:30, our mimosas were on the table.  \\n\\nTo eat, a friend and I tried the Duck and Potato Hash, which came topped with a fried egg,  smothered in onion gravy, and served with a side of local greens. Our waiter described the duck as being marinated and braised(?) overnight, so we were expecting a cut of duck meat. However,  as the name suggests,  it is a hash - so it's like pulled duck meat mixed in with the potatoes. At either rate it was tasty - the duck was tender. The greens were crisp.  The gravy was tasty. Not a bad deal for Sunday brunch."},{"name":"Caffe Paradiso","address":"255 Hanover St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"I went here with a friend and we really enjoyed our tiramisu... until we got the bill!

I had the opportunity to check them out for a corporate dinner the other night, and they mostly lived up to expectations.\\n\\nI arrived the other night and the first thing I noticed when I walked inside was the large area I can only describe as a glass-enclosed wine cellar. The hundreds and hundreds of bottles of wine let you know that Del Frisco's knows their wine.\\n\\nAfter having a drink over at the bar, my party was seated at a large table inside Del Frisco's beautiful open dining area and given menus. Del Frisco's actually has more than just steak in that they have a huge seafood offering. Many of their seafood options looked so good that the person handling our party decided to order crab cakes and another item that I can't remember for the entire table. As they were bringing those items out, our table decided to order an absolutely GIGANTIC bottle of Caymus. While I'm not much of a wine drinker, the bottle was fun and the wine was absolutely fantastic. The sommelier (btw, the entire waitstaff was great) then suggested another wine to follow that wine to go with our dinner, and that wine was ALSO fantastic. Who knew that you could order wine to compliment wine?\\n\\nAfter drinking wine and having the seafood appetizers (the drinks made it hard to remember all the various items we ate), everyone placed their order. I decided to order the bone out prime rib along with some sauteed mushrooms (the latter a suggestion from my father-in-law). Maybe it was the drinks or being full from all the pre-entree items (their Caesar was pretty good), the one thing that kept my night from being a 5 star was the steak. I ordered medium rare, but the prime rib was still fairly tough and didn't really have much flavor. I still finished most of it because it was an acceptable piece of prime rib, but I was a little disappointed that their steak didn't blow me away. Everyone else loved their steaks, so I'm hopeful that my steak is better next time. \\n\\nOverall, Del Frisco's is a good steakhouse that provides great service, amazing non-steak items (and quality steak as well), and one of the best restaurant wine experiences you will have in Orlando."},{"name":"Josie's Pizza & Wings","address":"1225 S Hiawassee Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"Great local pizza joint with reliable friendly service in MetroWest.

The only downside is that I think you're paying for more than it's worth, but over all, still a great restaurant (especially considering Austin's weak food scene).\\n\\nSo the restaurant has a lot of gimmicky stuff (definitely one of those \\"modern,\\" \\"hip,\\" \\"foodie\\" restaurants lol) but for one of those places, this place actually delivers on taste and innovation. Aside from price, I didn't like how they had \\"dim sum\\" style dishes carted around (feels like cultural appropriation to me because dim sum is supposed to be homey, fast, and cheap which this place definitely wasn't lol) but still warrants a 5-star review.\\n\\nWe started off with drinks, which were just meh. You can easily find better (and more innovative, if that's what you're looking for) drinks elsewhere.\\n\\nFor food, we started with the beef tartare. This was the best thing that we had that night. They had different textures throughout the dish, which made it so enjoyable, and the taste was phenomenal (insert chef's kiss here). Would come back just to eat that tartare.\\n\\nNext was the agnolotti pasta. Again, great balance of flavor. My only reservation about this dish was that it skewed towards the sour side. But again, they included a wide variety of textures, so that every bite was surprising in texture but pleasant in taste.\\n\\nNext was the crispy pork shoulder. The flavor honestly fell a little flat on this one, but the flavor was still pretty unique. Mainly the sauce was heavier, and super salty, with the smokiness not well-balanced by other flavors. The pork was super tender, and again, there was a play on textures (I'm sensing a pattern here). The textures game was a bit weaker for this dish. Definitely the weakest dish we had all night.\\n\\nWe also got 2 \\"dim sum\\" dishes: the murder point oyster and the sourdough with whipped beef tallow. The oyster was pretty good, but the smallest oyster I've ever (EVER) had in a restaurant lol. The whipped beef tallow was absolutely divine and tied with the beef tartare. The whip is mainly butter, but the subtle but heavier beef flavor definitely shines through and mixes so well with the sourdough. Normally I'm not a fan of sourdough, but the flavors here definitely meshed well. Just basing off flavor profile, I'd guess that the beef tallow is probably your best bet between the 3 choices of spread (didn't try the other 2) but maybe I'll have to go back and try everything to make a truly informed judgment.\\n\\nLastly, we got the caramelized corn cake. Again, super pleasant texture (it reminded me of Momofuku corn cookies). The cake was nice and moist, but each bite was interspersed with a little bit of the harder corn. The 3 different sauces on top also made the dessert not boring, and it was over all a pleasant and mild finish to the meal (not super sweet, which I enjoyed).\\n\\nOver all, I'm impressed with this place. Again, my only real qualm was with the \\"dim sum\\" aspect and the price. The drinks were okay, the service was great, and the food was the best I've had in Austin. Definitely will be back!"},{"name":"Emerald Lounge","address":"200 Stuart St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"This club sucks.... Paid $450 for VIP.

The fact that they have a nice assortment of animals hanging from their window is a good indicator.  Everything from squid, chicken, duck and crispy pork is on display and seems disheartening to some not used to it.  I grew up going into the shops of Chinatown in NYC as a young boy and learned from my mom that a place that is willing to show their goods publicly deserves to be tried.\\n\\nMy old standby here is the trio special.  It is a great combo of roasted duck, steamed chicken and roasted pork over rice and bok choy.  They also season the chicken with a very tasty garlic mixture which can be spread on everything.  I also recommend getting the hot oil for a little added heat.  Another must have dish is the wonton soup.  For people who loves \\"real\\" wonton soup that is delicate and light, this is a place to go.  The filling is also delicate and very tasty.  A nice touch is they separate the wontons from the broth so when you get home the wontons have not all fallen apart.  I actually eat them without the soup usually because they are that good.  The chow fun is very flavorful and portions are generous.  There is a dish there that I get that is made of tripe, stomach, etc. which many places do not have.

In those travels, I have picked up the following tips on making this place less likely to suck:\\n\\n1.  Bring two forms of picture ID.  My first time going there the bouncer asked all of us for two forms of photo ID, which I did not have.  The only reason I was able to get in was because my brother had two IDs and the addresses on our drivers licenses matched, so the bouncer conceded that mine must be real.  Generally, the bouncers here are blatant jackasses - they let our friend from Ghana (who has a foreign ID) in one week and the next they said that the very same ID card \\"looked fake\\" and would not let her in.  So, no matter what, be prepared to have some issues at the door.\\n2.  If you go into the bar, order ANYTHING but a Scorpion Bowl.  As many others have noted, they taste like watered-down Kool-Aid and are served in unwashed bowls (gag gag gag).  You'd probably contract less germs from licking a toilet.\\n3.  On that note, try to avoid the bathrooms.  I can't speak for the men's room, but the stalls in the ladies' room are about 2' x 2' and require a staggering feat of contortion to be used without making a mess.  Since most of the frequenters are trashed and need to evacuate the copious amounts of alcohol they've consumed, the situation gets grim fast.\\n4.  Go with a group.  The music on the dance floor usually kicks off with campy 80s hits (\\"Hey Mickey,\\" really?) that are only fun if you're dancing like a fool and joking around with other people who appreciate the godawfulness of the situation.  The selection usually gets good later on, but the DJs can be spotty to say the least.\\n5.  Make sure there's a guy included in your group.  If you're female and care about keeping your personal bubble intact, you will need a male line of defense against the sketchy Tonys and Viggos and Werts who will stand in the corner of the dance floor leering at you for 25 minutes before they attempt to swoop in like horny vultures and feast on you by way of skanky grinding.\\n6.  Watch where you step while you're dancing.  Invariably, some dingbat manages to spill his/her drink all over the floor (or if you're lucky, all over you!), and invariably, some other dingbat doesn't notice and takes a nasty fall as a result.  Make sure that (1) you are not either of those dingbats, and (2) that if the second dingbat is near you, don't get taken down in the process.\\n\\nThose are my tips for making the Kong standable.  Even if you follow all of them there's a good chance that the evening will be a bust, but it at the very least, it makes for fun, geez-can-you-believe-that-happened stories afterward."},{"name":"Taqueria Los Hermanos","address":"4418 Hugh Howell Rd","city":"Tucker","stars":"4","text":"After all of the help from fellow Yelpers, I decided to try out Los Hermaos, after my disastrous experience at Los Loros off of Clairmont Rd and N.

Found some small bone fragments in there too. I ended up taking two bites and threw it away. I wasn't even going to to bother rinsing off the chicken and hunting for stray bone to feed to my dogs. I cannot figure out given the amount of orange colored oil I poured off the top of this why the heck the chicken is so dry.\\n\\nThe Chicken Tikka Masala was sadly not much better and I only say that because there was less grease floating on top than the \\"Korma\\". If you asked me to blind taste test this and tell you what dish it was, I could not tell you it was chicken Tikka Masala or even some sort of curry. It tasted like some sort of peppery thick sauce mix with some instant mix element added. It was not even slightly creamy so their version seems to have no yogurt, cream, or coconut in it at all. It was like a chicken chunks with a thick paste that was more pepper and spice than tomato, garlic, ginger.\\n\\nIf I hadn't eaten at restaurants here and abroad selling these same dishes perhaps I might consider this restaurant's interpretation of these dishes might be a regional thing. \\n\\nBut this is one of perhaps 2 of those restaurants where I thought the food unrecognizable.\\n\\nEven worse, the food quality is not even tasty for its own sake."},{"name":"Greenleaf Juicing Company","address":"810 NW 12th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"I love this place!\\n\\nI love the pearl location because it's super close to 24 hour fitness.

There's a thick-ish patty (maybe...1/3 inch thick patty) with tomatoes, lettuce, VERY thinly shaved onion, Tillamook Cheddar, special sauce, and bacon for me on a soft appropriately griddled bun.

I can eat an In-n-Out burger once a week. It's awful but I can because it's not greasy or at least it doesn't ooze oil/butter. This burger...you will need to sit and digest it for a bit. I view this as more of a...once or twice a month kind of burger. Enough to hit that sweet spot and memorable enough to tide you over until you need your next hit. \\n\\nAlso...it's pricey. $12 for a bacon cheeseburger and a side of fries. Considering I paid 13+ in Texas for a double double, 2 cheeseburgers, and one order of fries...a small part of me screams that I am no longer in Texas. For Portland standards?

Dip inside the market, hang a right and walk through the back through the doors and voila. \\n\\nInside - Since it's a cooking school, it's almost homey with sofas near the front and various size wooden tables and chairs along the left portion of the inside. Rest rooms are also available, somewhere. I didn't use it but the girls in my group did.\\n\\n[Service]:\\nFast casual setup. Order at the counter - via ipad, then give a name.

I think if you're really hungry, you might want to split this and a bowl with a friend. \\n\\nSushi Bowl - Savory Salmon - I think I preferred the bowl more than the burrito just because there was more seaweed salad and that gave contrast to the texture of each bite, between the buttery smooth salmon and rice.

The salmon was buttery smooth and the sauce complimented the fish well without overpowering it.\\n\\nSauces are also available near the table by the sofa's. \\n\\n[Total Bill]\\n\\nThe bowl and burrito average out to a little over $11 each. \\n\\n{Summary}:\\nSpeaking with Judy, the owner, she stated that this concept of the pop up is just a temporary thing and mainly done out of foodie love that her and her family share. That same love that they wanted to give ATL a chance to try since we've been missing for a bit since Cali and NY started the food trend of this type. The wait to order and then for the food to be made, might turn off some that are used to instant gratification. This ain't no fast food drive through.

If you were wondering where all the rum goes, it's apparently being put in this tiramisu. (I could have sworn I sensed Kahlua in it as well.)

This is one of my favorites, but today I went for a quesadilla filled with Barbacoa and cheese.  It was accompanied with shredded lettuce, sour cream, rice and beans.

This what happens when a draft of a review sits on the computer for too long and you post late. \\n\\nDavide --pronounced DAH-VEE-DAY; not the name David with a cool French accent-- is a household name around these parts, as it was featured on Gordon Ramsay's Kitchen Nightmares.   So you would think that I would have known about it the night I went there. Truth be told, I don't watch Kitchen Nightmares or any other shows of the sort because, to be quite honest, they make me a bit tense. It can be a brutal and unforgiving business, and I simply prefer not to see the ugly side of it, as I know it all too well. \\nWe showed up an hour early, which wasn't a problem, given the multitude of empty tables.  We had hoped that, if a table was not available, we could sit at the bar and wait.  There was a bar, but it was for servers only to pick up drinks for their tables; not a place where coworkers can grab a drink after work.  The restaurant is located in a basement of what appears to be an apartment building.  It is a rather dark space, but the darkness gave it a romantic feel.   Sandy and I were enjoying a nice, quiet dinner when a random thing occurred. An 80's new-wave song started playing in the background, replacing the typical, contemporary jazz, or the classic \\"that's amore.\\"  Call me crazy, but there is something about hearing Depeche Mode's \\"strange love\\" that clashes with the surroundings.  \\nThe food at Davide was quite good, and our server was excellent.  We went over the wine list with him, and he recommended a \\"Super Tuscan,\\" which is not one of our common picks, and we found this to be an excellent suggestion.  And, of course, being in an Italian restaurant, I had to try the house tomato sauce.  This sauce, to me, is the nucleolus of these establishments. Tomato sauce is one of 5 \\"mother sauces\\" from which thousands of other sauces are formed. The sauce itself is simple, and consists of a few relative ingredients; but it is the care and passion of the creator that transforms these few ingredients into a precious cauldron of love.  Davide can give even the most cutthroat Italian mamas a run for their money with their version of this classic.  For our entrees we had the lamb chops and rib eye steak.  The lamb was cooked well and was served with an artichoke crepesella drizzled with a balsamic reduction. This was very good.  I had the rib eye which came with baby arugula tossed in a lemon truffle dressing and shaved parmesan. When it arrived at the table, to my surprise, it was pan seared. Now, I know this is a divided view, because there are folks out there who prefer that their steaks be prepared in this way, rather than grilled or charbroiled. I enjoyed it, but I am one of those diehards who prefer the char of a grill; especially wood grilled!\\nIt appears, to me, that Davide's biggest hindrance is its location, and I am not sure that Chef Ramsay's revamp did much to boost traffic for the long-term. We went on a Saturday night in July, and it was very slow.  We thought that it might have been due to a festival going on a few blocks away on the main strip of the North End (Hanover Street), but additional research from other reviewers made similar claims.   Davide is situated away from the main foot traffic of people that come to visit the historic North End. I think this creates an incredible challenge for them, and leaves the inner circle of restaurants with a stronger advantage. \\nOverall, our experience at Davide was very good, and I would not discount going back there."},{"name":"Nicole's Pizza","address":"639 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"We were visiting Boston and wanted to pick up a pizza as we walked back to the Airbnb we were staying on Tremont Street.

Very rarely (pun unintended) do I find a steakhouse that knows how a Medium Rare steak should be cooked. I ordered the New York Strip, medium rare. Upon cutting into the steak, it was a beautiful pink with a warm red center....literally the definition of what medium rare should look like. It was also very tender, juicy, and well-marbled (aside from the small layer of fat that naturally occurs on the steer's back). I also had a two of my girlfriend's pork ribs. They were perfect: not too fatty, but tender and came right off the bone. The BBQ sauce was perfectly set from the grill; even the end rib had a hint of char that reminded me  that these bad boys were cooked over an open flame.\\n\\nAs for the service....\\nI was blown away at how friendly everyone was. Our waitress, Katrina, had her timing down perfectly. She was there early on to take our drink order, and then almost sensed when we were ready to order food. Not too bothersome, but present whenever we needed something.\\n\\nThe assistant manager delivered our food and came back after we had dug in to make sure everything was up to par.

The quiet deafening, the light seemingly escaped into the vastness of the great Northwest before suddenly returning as if someone flipped a celestial light switch. Was the end of time near? If this was going to be our final meal, it seemed clear that we should eat a bunch o' tacos. \\n\\nIn a tiny strip mall perpendicular to Main Street in downtown Tigard and barely visible from the street, we found Taqueria La Fuente. Nondescript from the outside, the inside was simple, yet clean with several laminate-top booths and tables. The hot, fresh homemade chips and salsa quickly arrived compliments of the friendly server who warmly welcomed us on this historic day.\\n\\nA Dos Equis Amber draft (16 oz - $4.25) seemed like a good way to start, quickly followed by a side order of guacamole ($2.95). The beer was cold and frothy and the guacamole as good as any restaurant guac I have had, simple, flavorful and larger than those others charge twice as much for.\\n\\nTacos were the star of this show. We ordered the Crispy Tacos ($8.50) and Tacos Mexicanos ($8.85), coming three each to the plate with no rice and/or beans. The crispy tacos came deep fried with two medium tortillas each, filled with carne asada (or your choice of meat), lettuce, tomato and cheese. A little leftover guacamole, metaphorically, was the icing on the cake. The tacos Mexicanos were simple, as they should be, one with carnitas, one with carne asada and one with shredded beef (cabeza), all on large, soft corn tortillas, topped with chopped white onion and cilantro, and accompanied by sliced radish and lime wedges. If they do tacos this well, I can hardly wait to return to sample the other menu items because these were some of the best restaurant tacos I have had in recent memory.\\n\\nOn our second visit, they were closing soon, so we did not go nuts, ordering the go-to Crispy Tacos and a Cheese and Onion Enchilada ala carte ($3.25). I also tried the House Margarita ($5.50), asking for it blended with salt, but when it arrived it was \\"on the rocks\\". I did not make an issue of it being so late. The margarita was OK, not big and not very strong, so I think I will stick with the cerveza from now on. The enchilada was presented quite nicely with shredded lettuce, a drizzle of sour cream and some chopped cilantro, but the toppings masked the flavor of the enchilada which was what I wanted to taste.\\n\\nThe service was impeccable - friendly, efficient and professional. We even received a complimentary order of Flan at the conclusion of our second visit, fluffy and delicious as any I have had. Taqueria La Fuente was the \\"star\\" of the show and a \\"bright\\" spot on an otherwise dark day, celestially speaking. At just $24.55 before tip on our first visit, this was one of the best values I have seen in my two plus months since moving to Portland, hence my nearly perfect rating ...\\n\\nCombatCritic Gives Taqueria La Fuente 9 Bombs Out Of 10 ...

Given only the Chinese name and directions on how to get there, I was elated to see that they specialized in Chinese BBQ.  Seeing the roast pork on the meat hook, I thought, \\"Wow - is Master Hung a challenger to *the* HK BBQ Master?\\"\\n\\nI insisted we ordered the BBQ sampler plate - and eagerly licked my chops in anticipation.

Some may like the fatty cut, but I found overly mushy and bit over-seasoned.\\n - roast duck - very fatty again and we didn't get any duck breast\\n - BBQ pork [cha siu] - this was very lean, almost dry and had a gamey aftertaste as the flavouring was pretty weak - did not like this at all\\n - white cut free range chicken - was best out of the four - pretty juicy and didn't have the 'free range' taste I normally associate with this dish\\n\\nNeedless to say, I was pretty disappointed.  When I walked up to the wall to check the trophies - they were all just awards for various soccer tournaments (sigh).  Based on the Chinese BBQ stuff alone, I would have probably scored them a 2.5/5.\\n\\nHowever, as the meal progressed, all the other dishes were well above average.  The fried rice, sweet and sour pork, eggplant clay pot and veggie dishes were great.  I was wondering why the restaurant was so popular, there was my answer.  I would give them a 3.5 or 4/5 for the other dishes - so I took the average between the two scores.\\n\\nPretty good and popular restaurant (despite being far away from the main Richmond 'strip') - however, the self-proclaimed BBQ mastery/specialty is a let-down."},{"name":"Bill Miller Bar-B-Q","address":"709 E Ben White","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"Amazing barbecue place.

Mine is Cucinova- better pizza, maybe slightly slower.  MOD makes fine pizza, just not great pizza.  I think it's the crust and cheese- zero flavor.  \\n\\nTheir toppings are great, so to smother the cheese and crust and amp things up, I recommend building your own and avoiding their specialty versions.  You can get as many toppings as you want, no upcharge, so pile them on.  In order to try to change up the crust/cheese flavor deficit, I did two things this time.  First, got the mega crust.  This makes it thicker and puffier, but adds zero flavor, and is not worth the $2 upcharge.  I then added ricotta, which gave some nice flavor variety; however, there's still a ton of flavorless mozz, and only a little ricotta, so it didn't change that aspect much.  I had them add chicken, spicy sausage, bacon, broccoli, corn, roasted garlic, and tomato sauce with some pesto.  \\n\\nI also had a small asparagus salad, which was bits of asparagus on lettuce (I love asparagus and had hoped for more.)  A very good salad, though.  When the pizza came up, it looked great.  I asked for BBQ on the side, thinking I might need to add flavor. The toppings really did do a good job supplying that, so I just dipped crust in the BBQ.  The veggies were good, the meats were good.  The sausage was sadly not spicy.  Generally, the toppings made for a good combination.\\n\\nFinished with a \\"no-name cake,\\" essentially a homemade King Don.  Good cake and filling, very good chocolate coating.

Literally no one was there but it still took them over 30 minutes to bring out basic hamburgers and Caesar salads, since that's the kind of meal we had to resort to after the chowder incident.

Not only did she donate food, but she went way above and beyond donating more than we could have ever asked for.  Since then, her kindness has never waivered whenever we've asked for her to participate in other events.  And, every time I've eaten at her restaurant, she always calls me by name, even after all these years having moved away from the ATL.\\n\\nENVIRONMENT:  It's nestled among strip mall heaven/hell in the northern suburb of Roswell/Sandy Springs.  It shares the same parking lot as Whole Foods, Ross and Petco (no animals...from this establishment were harmed/consumed in this review).  The restaurant itself has about six (four-seater) booths, six large (ten-seater) tables and about six (two-seater) tables.  \\n\\nSERVICE:  No frills.  They take your order promptly and the food comes out just as expeditiously.  One interesting note about Cathy's business acumen is how she staffs her restaurant.  She astutely recognized a fair amount of her patrons are of hispanic descent.  She therefore promptly hired spanish-speaking servers to cater to that population.  Just from pure observation, I noticed this community frequenting CC multi-fold to where at any given time, over half the restaurant's patrons could be hispanic.  Very smart business person indeed.  Otherwise, you still have a fairly large Asian population that frequents this restaurant, even though it is off the beaten-Buford Highway-path.  Yet another good sign of a delicious Asian establishment.\\n\\nFOOD:  Ahhhhh...now to the good stuff.  I cannot remember the last time I had a bad/average dish at CC's.  It also helps that I tend to stick with what I know and appreciate.  Rather than explain each and every dish, I'll just give you a quick rundown of what I've had.  Salt n' pepper squid, cabbage cups with ground pork, general tso's chicken (my mom's favorite dish), sea bass (steamed and pan-fried (I recommend the latter)) (by far my most favorite dish here), beef chow fun (with sauce), seafood chow fun with special house sauce, spicy eggplant and pork hotpot (my dad's favorite), orange beef.  \\n\\nI cannot attest to the authenticity of the dishes (whatever that means in this day and age), but what I can attest to is the yumminess (if that's a word).  For me, I'll take yummy over authentic any day.  \\n\\nOVERALL:  Over the years, CC has garnered a huge loyal following.  So, unfortunately, you will find yourself waiting quite a while (30-45 minutes) during peak meal hours (lunch/dinner).  Frankly, words don't do the food justice and certainly don't take my word for it.  I'd rather let the food do the talking.

There was live music and the ambiance was lovely I was excited to have a good time. After being seated with the rest of my party who had already been eating drinking and enjoying music we were asked to get up. Mind you it was after 10pm so we were confused. We asked to speak to the manager because we had just ordered more food and drink. No manager available but the hostess said we needed to get up because they had someone there who wanted to do bottle service in the booth. We were so confused why would you ask us to get up. It literally went back and forth for almost 30 minutes until I cancelled my food and drink order because they suggested we stand at the bar to eat! LOL RIGHT? No way! They paid their tab and we left.\\nI was upset because I was excited to eat drink and hear some music. \\n\\nI had to give them a second chance so I invited a friend to check it out in a Thursday with me. I made reservations a week in advance but when we got there they asked us to be seated with another party!!! We were like huh I don't understand. The hostess went on to say its shared seating after 10PM I was like well last time I was here you all demanded we get up for another group that had reservations. Anyway being confused and not wanting to join a group of complete strangers we just stood at the bar frustrated. We ordered a drink and then were approached by the hostess saying she found us a seat. They say us with a group of ladies but at this point I didn't care I was hungry and the shoes I wow were for sitting not standing for long periods of time. We sat we orders the pizza and a big Caesar salad and it was actually delicious. The live music was amazing and the guy can sing his butt off. However the service at the host stand and all the of the seating issues need improvement. They should also have management present because those ladies had no clue what to do.

Hong Kong style cafes can either be hit or miss.  Our family came here for lunch early enough to beat the rush (which starts at around 11:30am).  We were promptly seated in a booth but it took around 7 minutes to catch the attention of a server to even take our order and my son had to stand and flag someone down.  They do provide free hot or cold drinks with the food, though.  I ordered a hot almond milk tea which was quite hot but fairly bland (tasted more like boiled milk).  The service leaves much to be desired and the quality of the food is average(our noodle and fried rice dishes were very greasy).

I arrived about 10 minutes before they stopped serving breakfast.  I didn't get to the front of the line until 30 minutes after they stopped.  there was no apology, nobody pre-emptively taking orders (like they were doing in the drive through), it was just wait there for your chance to order and then get shuffled off to the side so you could then wait for your order.  There was nothing from the cashier apologizing for my delay or giving me even a time estimate on how long my food would take.  No, after I paid for my two sandwiches and chicken strips, I had to wait another ten minutes to get my food.  Invariably, once I did get it-it was just warm.\\n\\nI was there for  45 minutes before I got to eat food that wasn't even hot.  Perhaps the flavor would have been better had I been eating hot food, but what I ended up having is a overpriced chicken sandwich that I wouldn't be able to tell it was different from McDonalds/Wendy's/BK.  Yes, I could have notified them that my food was not hot and I would prefer something hot, but I was famished at this point and I couldn't see waiting another 10 minutes to make my \\"fast food\\" experience go even longer.

It's walking in on a Friday night for the first time ever and not one of the 3 people at the counter acknowledge my family. Finally 3 or 4 minutes later, a kid turns around and sighs. I tell him we aren't sure if we just sit or order at the counter (since menus are just laying around there). He says well we close at 9. I look at my phone 8:20. I say ooookay. He says pizza takes 25 minutes. Again, I'm perplexed. It's just 4 of us, one is a teenager that will scarf down half as soon as it arrives.  I say, well can we still order. Answer: 'we close at 9.'

I ordered the same thing as last time plus the buffalo chicken one (can't remember the name). So freaking good.

This place is smaller than Izziban but it's big enough to have several big groups. \\nSo here you have the option to do korean bbq, hot pot, sushi, or other entrees. At this place, some people can do all you can eat and other people don't need to. But don't sneak around to eat all you can eat if you're not doing it, that doesn't seem right.\\nThere is happy hour deals for all you can eat kbbq ($20 without tax) and other stuff! Look at the happy hour menu!\\n\\nAnyways, I noticed every few weeks from then there was specials especially when pokemon go came out. There was a pokemon roll ball. It seemed interesting but I didn't get it. I don't think you can still get it since the pokemon go fever is down by the way.\\nI like the set up here. It's pretty nice. \\nYou do not get your own side dishes here like Izziban does it. They give you the side dishes and if you want more, they will give you more. It's unlimited. There's two sauces; dank sauce and kbbq sauce. I really like their kimchi cucumber and beanspouts one. I do wish that they give out leaf wraps. It will hit the right spot for all you can eat kbbq. I do admit when they give out little meat portions. So we always order more plates at the same time so we don't need to wait for them to cut the meat out. \\nThey cut it pretty thin which I like cuz it's not too thick to chew and gets some crispiness. And it's way faster to cook with. Like any other place, if there's too much side over meat that has not been eaten, they will charge you leftover wasting fee. I think that's why they give you little by little meats which is kinda smart but for my hungry stomach, it's a no. And I don't like wasting food anyways. I don't think you can to-go the leftovers so try to order what you can eat. Don't order too much. Know your limit first before you go ordering crazy, even if you're in a big group cuz you'll never know.\\n\\nOkay, now to the other stuff. Their volcano roll, dank wings, and their sashmi are pretty good. Happy hour deals are $5 for dank wings and volcano rolls. Pretty good deal to me! Their dank wings have some spice to it so just warning ya if you can't hand mild/medium spicy food. The spice adds up when you eat more wings. I think there's like 5 or 6 wings that come with the happy hour. Definetly get volcnao if you want rolls.\\n\\nTheir tempura ice cream and tempura oreo are pretty good! Try them! Defiantly get this on your birthday!"},{"name":"Enjoy Cafe 1 Plus1","address":"8171 Westminster Highway, Ste 200","city":"Richmond","stars":"3","text":"In short, this place is an unglamourous, good value, middle-quality Hong Kong-style cafe with one of the worst washrooms in Vancouver. It's not fancy, but it does the job every time. Avoid using their bathroom if at all possible - it gives ones in Hong Kong a run for their money. For the long version, read on!\\n\\nMy parents prefer HK-style food that's good value and in Richmond so we've come here regularly for dinner, and sometimes breakfast and lunch. The portion to price ratio is pretty good and the food is usually pretty tasty. We like their Chinese-set menus where you get a dish, rice, and a soup (Chinese-style or western, like a cream or tomato soup). They have ample parking and there usually is no wait for a table. The two-seat tables are a bit close to each other and makes it hard to get in and out, and you hear everyone else's conversations without much effort. The service is okay. It's sometimes hard to flag staff down, but not terrible. They access cash and debit only.\\n\\nThe washrooms are abhorrent. It smells, there are stains everywhere, the taps eek out water, and if just a terrible experience. I try to avoid using it.\\n\\nOn this particular day, I was here with my parents and had two dishes to share. The swirl eggs and shrimps fried rice noodles had lots of crunchy shrimps, the egg swirl was quite good, and the rice noodles had a nice fried texture. We also got the Singapore-styled fried vermicelli and this had a good kick and had smaller shrimps, ham, bean sprouts, and green pepper. These dishes came with a drink and I like that choosing a cold drink has no extra charge, unlike a lot of places. The hot milk tea and hot coffee were just regular affairs and nothing to rave about, but not bad either. We couldn't finish everything and got some of the vermicelli packed up.\\n\\nOverall, a no-frills HK-style cafe that's a better value than most other places in Richmond.

Of course, El Arbor was slightly douchey and hit/miss, but the outdoor deck was charming. It's a crime to waste a space that wonderful.\\n\\nSo, when we heard that Shawn Circiel was opening an Italian restaurant there, we were really excited. I've yet to find an Italian place that I love, love, love, and I was hoping that it would be Olive & June. \\n\\nWe made reservations for dinner a few nights ago. When we walked in, we noticed that the restaurant was about 85% full on a Wednesday night. All the tables on the patio/deck were taken, so we were relegated to a booth on the second floor. \\n\\nIMO, there's a disconnect in design between the first and second floor. The downstairs area seems... a little too well-lit and cheap. The lighting exposed the really well worn floors. \\n\\nUpstairs, I felt like we'd stepped into a different restaurant. It's a bit cozier and more intimate upstairs. \\n\\nAnyway, I started with the endive, grape, and anchovy salad. Overall, I liked the idea. I wasn't super keen on the long strips of anchovy laying on top of the salad; the texture was slightly off putting, but the flavor combination was almost spot on. My one teeny complaint is that their salad options are not vegan friendly. \\n\\nFor entrees, I had the orata with a side of beets and the guy had the spaghetti pomodoro. The orata was wonderful. It reminded me of when I used to go camping and fishing as a child. The fish was fresh and well cooked. \\n\\nI wasn't a big fan of the beets. They were served with a very citrusy sauce that made them overwhelmingly sour. \\n\\nThe guy really enjoyed his pasta, but the best part of the meal was the bread and ricotta spread. OMG. \\n\\nThey should just make that. All. Day. Long. \\n\\nOverall, service was good and friendly, and I liked the general vibe of the space.

We took special note of the time we first received the food to cook, since we were being timed. \\n\\nThe meat is served in 2 separate plates initially, to each side of the table. This amount of meat took us 20 minutes to cook. We then ordered another 2 plates of meat, which didn't arrive for another 10 minutes. They were not busy, and we were on the meat clock, so to speak. So the entire table sat there, with no meat to cook, or even eat (as we'd previously finished the small portions) for 10 minutes waiting for more food.\\n\\nAfter receiving that, we cooked the much smaller portion in less than 15 minutes, and ordered a 3rd round of meat at the 45 minute mark. She told us that we had only 1 hour, and she would not serve us any more. \\n\\nAfter unsuccessfully arguing the time frame, we were all so frustrated that we conceited. She then came back about 10 minutes later and said that the manager would make an exception since no one gave us a \\"final call\\". How kind of the manager to allow us to order more BUFFET FOOD while we were WELL INSIDE THE ONE HOUR WINDOW! \\n\\nWe accepted, but were forced to give an extremely accurate count of exactly how many pieces of meat we wanted. \\"If there are any leftovers, you will be charged\\" she threatened. \\n\\nAfter eating our final plate of 3 marinated chicken thighs and 4 marinated pork loins, we were finished. \\n\\nThe food was acceptable, but the service was horrendous.

It's legit. I'd have to visit more often to know for sure, but the dinner I had here was fantastic.\\n\\nAnyone know the story behind Canton Cooks (https://www.yelp.com/biz/canton-cooks-atlanta) and Canton Cook II? The two restaurants are only 5 minutes (1.5 miles) apart on Roswell Rd in Sandy Springs OTP (outside the perimeter).\\n\\nFor a period of time, the original Canton Cooks had what many, including myself, considered to be the best Chinese food in Atlanta. It was friggin' delicious. This was in the early to mid 2000s. However, from my experience, the restaurant had its ups and downs in the years that followed. I *heard* the chef at the original Canton Cooks moved to this location. It opened in 2011. I wonder why they decided to leave the 's' off of Cook...\\n\\nIf the hearsay is true, then I'm totally not surprised because eating the food here was like taking a trip back in time to when the original Canton Cooks was at its peak.\\n\\nCanton Cook II is located in the LA Fitness shopping center behind Sandy Springs' popular sushi buffet, Nori Nori. This is pretty much your traditional, casual Cantonese restaurant. There's booth seating aplenty with large round tables in the back, equipped with Lazy Susans of course, for family-style dining. Great for groups. They've got aquariums with fish, lobster, and crab. Like the original Canton Cooks, No. 2 is open late -- until 11pm on Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, and Sunday nights and until later on Friday and Saturday nights. They're closed on Mondays.\\n\\nThe restaurant has one of those massive Chinese menus with well over 100 items: appetizers, soups, hot pot, lobster, shrimp, fish, crab, oysters, clams, duck, squid, scallops, chicken, beef, pork, vegetables, fried rice, chow mein and lo mein noodles, egg foo young, Cantonese-style chow mein and chow fun noodles, and noodle soups. It's Chinese comfort food. Expect to spend about $12+ each for most entrees and at least $20+ each for seafood dishes. Lobster costs around $27 per order and fish and crab entrees are seasonally priced (we were charged $28.95 for our pan-fried sea bass). Lunch specials are available for around $8.\\n\\nA group of six of us ordered the following:\\n\\n* Spicy Salted Squid - $12.95\\n* Beef Chow Fun (Dry) - $12.95\\n* Garlic Snow Leaf (snow pea tips) - $12.95\\n* General Tso's Chicken - $11.65\\n* Pan Fried Sea Bass - $28.95\\n\\nThe portion sizes were generous. These five dishes were more than enough food. I was particularly impressed with the quantity of snow pea tips they gave us. It was more than I've seen at any other Chinese restaurant. The leaves were just piled on into a dense, thick stack and they were absolutely delicious. Garlicky and delectable. This veggie was probably my favorite dish.\\n\\nThe beef chow fun was excellent and again, big portions. Beef chow fun is a popular Cantonese noodle dish made with wide rice noodles stir-fried with beef, bean sprouts, and scallions. It's a greasy dish, but quite flavorful. Highly recommended.\\n\\nThe spicy salted squid, also known as salt and pepper squid, was top notch. The best salt and pepper squid I ever had was at the original Canton Cooks in the early 2000s. This one was just as good, if not better. Crispy, meaty, not too oily, and seasoned just right. It was essentially the perfect salt and pepper squid with sliced jalapenos and chopped lettuce and scallions. Also highly recommended.\\n\\nSomeone at our table was craving General Tso's chicken, an Americanized Chinese dish that makes me think of Panda Express or mall food court Chinese. Canton Cook II's version was actually pretty darn good. Nice and thick, tender chunks of fried chicken in a sauce that was both sweet and spicy, served with sliced onion and pepper. Yum.\\n\\nThe pan-fried sea bass was a hit. Our friends sitting at the table next to us ordered it among many other dishes. It was one of their favorites, so we ordered it too. The pan-fried sea bass takes a bit more time to prepare, 15 minutes we were told by the server. It came out in less time than that. The fish was mostly boneless and came topped with ginger and scallion and was served in the same savory brown sauce that Cantonese steamed whole fish is served in.\\n\\nThe presentation of the fish was interesting because part of it was puffed up. I guess the puffing happens during the frying process. With all the fried food we'd already had, I probably would have preferred steamed fish instead, but the pan-fried version was still good. Very crispy and tasty.\\n\\nService was A-OK. The dishes came out quick. There was a bit of a communication barrier with the servers. Fortunately, someone at our table spoke Chinese. Ultimately, you should be fine.\\n\\nI look forward to returning."},{"name":"Pflugerville Sarpino's","address":"13000 North Ih-35","city":"Austin","stars":"3","text":"I order delivery from here often, and have really never had any problems or been disappointed.

Not a big issue, but it would probably be easier to carry and clean if it was filled less. We ordered an assortment of lamb, beef, pork belly, vegetables, and noodles. Everything tasted fresh, but the lamb tasted a bit more gamey than the other XFY's I've been to - I admit this may be my own taste buds, but food was great regardless. One thing that I did notice was that they didn't deliver one of our orders that was marked, and I believe the reasoning is that they don't want you to order more than you can eat. It would save them a trip if they trusted the customer to eat everything or held true to the extra food charge. \\n\\nThe staff is very friendly, and our waiter checked up on us often throughout the meal.

We received a glass of wine with lipstick on it (not a huge deal, it happens), and the waiter kindly brought it back to the bar to be exchanged for a clean glass. He returns with yet another dirty glass and when we bring it to the waiter's attention, he gives us an attitude and swipes the glass off the table. \\n\\nNext, we order the tuna tartare. I am deathly allergic to peanuts and communicate this to the waiter. He told us they'd prepare the dish without peanuts. Naturally, the dish shows up COVERED in peanuts...

She is the only reason why I'm giving this review two stars. She took care of us from that point on, brought the waiter over to apologize, comped a few of our items and presented us with a $50 gift card. The worst part was the waiter, who could've caused a potentially fatal allergic reaction, didn't even seem genuine in his apology and only seemed to apologize because his manager dragged him to the table. \\n\\nI appreciate the level of effort the manager put in to rectify the situation, but my friends and I will not be returning to Stephanie's."},{"name":"Bogie's Place","address":"25 Temple Pl","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"There are 73 photos on this page yet you won't see any of mine.  I'll explain why as I continue on with the review.\\n\\nWe came across Bogie's Place while searching new places to try in Boston.  I must say that the photos helped us in making our decision to try it.\\n\\nThe place is small with very few seats.  To find it, you have to enter the bar, JM Curley, which has a very small sign outside of it and that makes it easy to miss.  Once you enter, to your left, you will see an entry way that is closed off by a curtain.  There are signs.  One says \\"For Adults Only\\", the other says \\"No cell phones\\".\\n\\nWe were about to enter when a server at JM Curley approached us and questioned us.  We told her that we had a 5 p.m reservation.  She said she had to check to see if the waitress in there was ready to receive us.  It turned out that there was a waiter and he was ready for us.\\n\\nMuch to our surprise, we were the only customers during our entire meal.  Our server introduced himself to us and talked about the place and the menu.  There was background music which was apparently his personal CD that featured classically trained singers singing  songs from the last 30 years.   While it was interesting and pleasant, given the theme of the restaurant, we both thought that music from Bogie's hayday (30s and 40s) would have been more appropriate.  We, perhaps, should have pointed that out.\\n\\nWe both ordered drinks.  I tried one of their specials, the Shinobu which consists of: \\"Bombay Sapphire Gin, Japanese Yuzu Citrus, Lychee Puree, Salted Basil Oil, Ancho Chili Oil\\".  This drink had a mix of hot and sweet in it and supposedly with each sip one was supposed to experience a different taste.  It didn't quite happen like that but it was a unique drink.  My husband had a Bloody Mary which he found to be super spicy.\\n\\nFor our main course, we both ordered  the 8 oz filet cooked medium rare.  I forget all the toppings/sauces on it but most memorable was the red wine reduction which, to me, almost overpowered the filet.  The filet itself was cooked properly and very tender.\\n\\nFor our sides, we got sauteed mushrooms and grilled asparagus.  My husband ate all the mushrooms (which were button ones) which was fine with me.  The portion was rather generous.  I ate the asparagus which was grilled to perfection.\\n\\nFor dessert, I got a plate of four mini cannolis which had an undercurrent of cinnamon.  While I could have done without the cinnamon, they were tasty.  My husband had a small bowl of lemon sorbet.\\n\\nI tried to take photos.  While the waiter was making our drinks, I snapped a photo of the small dinner rolls which came with the meal.  He noticed I did this and I got slapped down (well...figuratively).  Then I got a mini lecture.  He mentioned the \\"no cell phones\\" sign but I didn't take them with a cell phone.   Next, I was told that they were trying to recreate the feel of an old speak easy and that if you took a photo of yourself in a speak easy, the cops could see it and come after you.  I pointed out that back then, photos had to be developed and it would be days before anyone saw them.  He admitted that I got him there.  I also pointed out that there were photos on Yelp.  He said those happened when he had to leave the room to get food.  So...I didn't take anymore photos and I won't put up the photo of the dinner rolls.\\n\\nAll in all, a good meal that we enjoyed.  I will say that if they don't want any photos taken,  they need to be very specific in their signage.  My guess is that some of the photos posted were done knowing that they were doing so in violation of the rules.  While others were taken while being unaware of the rules.\\n\\nStill, it was a unique experience with good food.  As for Bogie's --- they really need to make it crystal clear that they don't allow anyone to take photos."},{"name":"Copious","address":"520 S High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"3.5","text":"Copious had been on my \\"must try\\" list in Columbus for while.

The atmosphere seemed to be very cool/not too stuffy. The service was a challenge for our particular visit. I debated between 3 and 4 stars.\\n\\nMy friend and I booked an early seating (10:30) for a Saturday brunch. I think we may have been the second party seated, but we were greeted with smiles. We both ordered drinks, which is where the problem started. My friend asked if they could make a mimosa with grapefruit juice. The waiter said absolutely, but much later came back with what appeared to be a traditional mimosa. The waiter was confident that it was in fact grapefruit, so we let it go. I got a Bloody Mary and was a happy camper with it.\\n\\nThe food was particularly delicious. I got the Copious Hash with braised short ribs and scrambled eggs. My friend got the Chicken and Waffles. Both of us were very happy with our food. It was satisfying and delicious for brunch.  \\n\\nWhile we were eating the band started to set up to play. It created a great atmosphere.

I don't think that I've ever seen the store staff more than 3 registers regardless of whether it's peak hours or not.  In addition, you can almost always count on 1 or 2 of the self checkout stations to be out of service.  It seems like management makes zero effort to repair them.  There's also no room for the long lines to form which creates awkward and uncomfortable situations where people can't get around the lines or others cut lines.

Sichuan Garden offers Chinese food minus the dragon wallpaper, dimly lit interior, and orange vinyl booths. Instead, this stately building delivers classic charm with worn hardwood floors, an ornate open staircase, wainscoting, and large windows to let in natural light. The restaurant is set within the Baldwin Estate, a Woburn landmark, and is divided into a few different rooms including a separate bar area, which I hear is popular with locals. \\n\\nToday we were seated in the front dining room. Aside from one painting on the wall, this room is a bit stark. It consists of four or five tables and is acoustically challenged as tables are close and the room is without much background noise, therefore voices carry easily. We were here between peak meal times and I guarantee you could hear a pin drop. This may be appealing to some, but I'm sure the couple at the nearby table heard every word of our conversation. I believe there are different dining rooms throughout the building, but I have not been beyond the front room. I am not sure if the second floor is used for dining. \\n\\nThe staff here is very welcoming and friendly. We experienced great service by all who interacted with us. In fact, the three stars I'm granting this restaurant are mostly earned by the staff. Although I love older homes and find the building charming, the restaurant is somehow lacking a bit of atmosphere. Perhaps it just feels like an unusual setting for Chinese cuisine. Oh, and speaking of the food....\\n\\nThe food, Sichuan style, is not my typical go-to Chinese as I prefer the traditional Polynesian or Mandarin variety. I guess I'm more for the American-ized Chinese food. We ordered luncheon combos with a side order of Crab Rangoon. The food was decent with the exception of the hot and sour soup. The soup was included with the meal, but all four of us pushed our bowls away after the first bite. It had a weird, thick and slimy appearance. We all tried the vegetable rice which I thought was cooked well and tasted okay. My mom seemed to really enjoy the rice. The duck/sweet sauce is pink in color which is different and takes a little getting used to. It sort of made my rice look like a crime scene. I thought the chicken fingers and Rangoon were on point, steak teriyaki decent, and chicken wings super crispy in a good way. My brother had a Mai Tai and gave it a big thumbs up. I bet there are some delicious dishes on the menu that I am missing out on, however, as we stuck to the basics today. \\n\\nLong story short (too late). There was a fly in the restaurant today. The doors were open, which was great because it was a beautiful day. A stray fly is the price you pay for fresh air.

So I thought an update was in order. \\n\\nFirst the lack of parking I encountered last time seemed to have been corrected. We were able to find a self parking spot this trip. Also different was the outstanding service we received from Chloe. This visit we had one server from start to finish. Unlike my last visit were the service was done by a team. The food was as good as I remembered. A classic steakhouse experience. \\n\\nThe highlight of this evening was our stop at the bar. I was perusing the specialty cocktail menu and nothing appealed to me. My husband ordered Tequila and I just asked for water. The bartender instead of just accepting my \\"no\\" at face value, engaged a conversation with me to determine what I was in the mood for. I told him all the listed cocktails looked sweet and I didn't want sweet. He asked if I liked cucumber and I said yes. He made a vodka gimlet with muddled cucumber. It was delicious and refreshing! Our friends who joined us for dinner all ended up ordering one because they loved it too. I will be back just for that drink!"},{"name":"Cook Out","address":"403 Moreland Ave SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Complicated Order. I wanted to order 2 cook-out trays to go. \\n\\nFirst tray: one 1/4 burger with cheese \\"no condiments\\" and no onion. She looked confused. \\"Ok, a burger with pickles, tomato, lettuce and cheese\\". The cashier then proceeded the tell me what I should say to order. \\"You mean a burger without...\\"   Not completely sure what is entirely included on burger, I restated my wants for a burger WITH....  But she went the \\"you want a burger without\\" route.  We have this with/without burger exchange a third time, at which point I am now confused about what I would be getting. She sighed with impatience and asked about the two sides. I choose French fries and chicken nuggets. But, she goes back to the burger, I guess to repeat for clarity, I don't know - I am confused at this point. Once confirmed, she asked about the two sides again. I had to speak slowly: French fries and chicken nuggets. And please, a vanilla shake. All she said was $7.01. \\n\\nAt which point, I dropped the hurdle of placing an order for the second tray and made my way to McDonald's. \\n\\nIf you think the drive-thru driving/ordering is confusing, try going inside. \\n\\nThird time is not a charm."},{"name":"Good Dog-Bad Dog","address":"7000 NE Airport Way","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"Flew back into PDX and was starving, so my first stop off the airplane was Good Dog Bad Dog.
