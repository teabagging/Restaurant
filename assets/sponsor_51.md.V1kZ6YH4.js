We went last weekend for my husband's birthday and were very impressed.  We got a chance to chat with the owner, the head of Mixology, and the head of the wait staff. \\n\\nLet's start with ambiance.  This place is amazing.  The owner is an interior designer.  Everything feels very 007/James Bond.  Our party of ten was seated in a semi private dining area that is separated by the rest of the place with a see through bookshelf with all kinds of pieces on it.  The table and chairs of this area reminds you of a board meeting room for the CIA or some high level elected officials.  Such a great ambiance.  Elsewhere in the restaurant you can see all kinds of interesting art work, velvet booths, etc.  There is a bathroom inside that has a wall of weapons on it which is very cool and a great talking piece.\\n\\nDrinks.  OUT OF THIS WORLD.  I mean they make their own in house ginger ice cubes.  This isn't a bad spot to get a mocktail either.  Everything is presented beautifully in glasses.  If you are a drink snob you MOST DEFINITELY will appreciate this spot.  Many of our group love a good old-fashion and everyone agreed this is the top 5 best old fashioned they ever had.\\n\\nFood.  How awesome is it that their menu is called a visa and it changes to a different country every 90 days!!!  They also have standard menu items that don't change.  We caught this spot when the menu featured Colombian tapas.  Everything was very good and plated very nice.\\n\\nThings That Make This Place Stand Out.  The owner and head of wait staff explained they don't strive to have this place promoted heavily other than word of mouth.  They only use the most fresh and most practical ingredients for their drinks and food.  If you bring someone new, you are considered a \\"Diplomat\\".   As stated earlier, you get to have real conversations with the owner, head of wait staff, and head of mixology so you know that these people really care about this place, the food and drinks that are served, and the overall ambiance.\\n\\nI am currently pregnant so I had mocktails (amazing by the way), so we most definitely will be back after I have my son so I can partake in all the cocktail menu has to offer.  This spot is now in our roladex of go-to spots for bomb drinks, nice filling tapas, or when we bring people in town.\\n\\nThe minimal drawbacks (and I mean they are seriously minimal):  Things can take awhile to come out of the kitchen and arrive at the table very sporadically...that wasn't that big of a deal.  Also, this place can be very hard to find.  It's right next to the marta station on 10th street.  If you are coming 85N get off on 10th street and make a right, then make a left on west peachtree, and an immediate right into the parking garage attached to the white marble-like building...they validate for this lot.  You will then need to walk down some stairs and the place is discreetly on your right.  I think they incognito vibe is kinda what the owner is going for, but it can be difficult to find for newbies."},{"name":"Miko Sushi Japanese Restaurant","address":"1335 Robson Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"This is probably my favorite sushi place in Vancouver.

You order from a kiosk, find a table, flag someone down to clean it for you, go to the drink station to get your beverage (don't bother with the coffee, yuck!), and get your own silverware as well.  After all this, I was a little shocked that the pastries they give you are essentially the same quality as something you would get from a gas station.  My main entree wasn't much better.

Not only that, the waitress was admiring how great of a burger my husband ordered with an egg added. \\n\\nThank god my husband was hungry! That burger definitely filled him up!

Your dining experience starts with cast members shouting family names trying to match available seats with tables. Add in some tired, cranky kids, strollers, mobility scooters and their equally exhausted owners and chaos begins. Once seated, the main dining room - while beautiful - is basically a typical Disney set masking a cafeteria. Yes, the snowfall outside is gorgeous, but the faux peace and serenity does little to mask the noise inside. Hundreds of families competing to talk over their adjacent guests does little to add to the ambience. Dear Disney, why do you not use textiles or sound baffles to deaden the volume in this massive spaces?!!\\n\\nOur meal was good, but not the kind of good a $450 meal (for 3) suggests. Yes, we had a $100 bottle of wine. Our first courses were ok, absent my cold escargot that was sent back. Main courses were overly salty. Rubbery scallops and undercooked lamb were both disappointing. Dessert was cute, but suffered the challenges of mass production. Macaroons on all three plates were soggy, the chocolate truffle too sweet for even the most avid sweetaholic and the \\"grey stuff\\" in a cup the best on the plate.\\n\\nService is rushed, mechanical and robotic. They are moving so fast they cannot even get orders correct.\\n\\nYes, this is Beauty and the Beast dining, but I'd honestly skip it and actually enjoy a nice meal elsewhere."},{"name":"Taqueria Lindo Michoacan","address":"4035 SE Division St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"This place is my standby when I'm craving tasty Mexican food on Division. Cash only. They also do carryout orders.\\n\\nTacos are simple and delicious (meat, cilantro, and chopped raw onion), served folded in two corn tortillas. Three is a fine lunch, four is good if you're hungrier, particularly around dinnertime. At a buck fifty each, they're a bargain. \\n\\nI usually get the supreme burrito, rather than the standard, since I crave cheese, guacamole, and sour cream with my burrito. The supreme includes useless shreds and chunks of lettuce that would otherwise detract from it, so I highly recommend asking them to leave the lettuce out. They're busy and get a lot of variation in their orders, so make sure that any substitutions are made clear. A normal-size supreme burrito will fill you up at dinner for $5.50. If you're looking for something the size of a small house-cat, go for the super-size supreme, which features a larger tortilla, stuffed accordingly, for $7.\\n\\nAs for the meats, I would recommend the carne asada as the most reliably delicious of the bunch. It's tender and perfectly cut, with a nice \\"from the grill\\" taste. The carnitas can be the best option altogether, but sometimes (but not always) they're a bit greasy for my tastes, so I reluctantly award them second place. The Pastor is good, though I sometimes find myself wishing it were spicier. Finally, I also liked the barbacoa when I had it, but it's not always available, so it helps to have a second choice on standby when ordering it.\\n\\nThey make their own sauces there, which is nice. While normally I'm more of a red sauce kind of guy, I like the green sauce better here. In particular, it works really well in concert with the richer ingredients like sour cream and guac. The red is smoky, which is nice, but it overpowers everything else in the flavors of whatever you're ordering, so I wouldn't recommend it.\\n\\nLindo Michoacan is definitely the cheapest full-size meal on Division Street.

The food did not change, except the ribs went from boneless to bone-in during the dinner transition. We drank hot tea and only asked for refills of hot water to the young man that walked past our table. We could not figure out who our server was. After two plates of food and in the middle of eating fruit, it was finally made clear who our server was supposed to be.  Fang comes over to our table and tells us that lunch is over and we have to leave. We stated that we were still eating. She said pay me now. We were in utter disbelief. My husband and I looked at one another for moral support. It took everything not to give her a few choice words as she repeated this rhetoric multiple times as we stated we are still in the middle of eating and they we would pay at the completion of our meal. She again, said No, you pay ME now. We said fine we will pay now (as our meal was ruined, I guess I don't want salad or ice cream or perhaps a plate of sushi and seaweed salad. All the things I was considering prior to this exchange) but we are going to pay at the front. The young man who did bring us tea was nearby and I wish he would have been the one to assist us, but I believe he was only cleaning tables sigh :( \\n\\nI am mortified by my experience as people had begun to look over at our table. Did she think we wouldn't tip, pay??? Did she think that this was the best way to get a good tip??? What was she thinking? I was belittled, humiliated and forced to exit early for a meal that was paid for. It's such a shame as I like many of the choices at the buffet and our last experience was great.

I decided to try it as it was close to the campground and open until 11pm. We arrived sometime after 9:30 and although the trays were not filled, it was hot and there were plenty of options to choose from. I decided on hot green tea, as I assumed I would devour some fried foods. Surprisingly I stayed away from most of it as there were so many better options. In all honesty, I tried several but after eating clean for so long my palette did not welcome any of it. To the bin it goes. The waitress was attentive and not overbearing. Quite pleasant. There indeed where plenty of sushi options. I had plenty of the strings beans and broccoli that I picked from a mixed vegetable dish, as it was much more crispy. Yum just the way I like. The ice cream was made from real cream which was so appreciated.  All in all I would return. There are so many areas with food and something for everyone. The only negative was that some trays were empty and most were low. Again, everything was hot.  Clean bathrooms. My advice is be sure to refill food faster and also try a different chicken for the chicken and broccoli as it was a bit gelatinous. Hubby tried the ribs and said they were tasty. A little sweet for my palette on that particular day. But I may try it again, as I used to enjoy the rib tips ok NY. Yea, that's exactly the ones they make here. You know what I'm talking about Brooklyn in the house. Certainly worth a try if you are starving and want to keep your bill below $20 for 1 person. I believe it is $8.99 for lunch and $12.99 for dinner with a 10% off coupon if you check in on yelp.

The seafood was hot but the broth stayed cold and it was really great. I am still in shock on how they managed to keep it that way. The portion sizing was perfect.\\n\\nThe dessert trio was good but not great. The rose stain glass on the plate is actually sugar paper and totally safe and edible. There's a certain way to eat the desserts to make sure you don't feel sick from how rich it is. I always started off with the macaroon and then moved on to the truffle then I finished with the white chocolate Chip tea cup filled with the grey stuff. \\n\\nAlso while dining there I am old enough to drink so I decided to try 2 of their wines and soon i hope to go back to try their champagne.

IT'S DELICIOUS! Don't believe me? ASK THE DISHES! \\n\\n   Actually just ask anyone!!! Be Our Guest is an incredibly place to dine in, especially for dinner. \\nThe ambiance is spectacular, absolutely beautiful.  There are 3 rooms you can be seated in.  The ballroom is by far my favorite. Makes you feel like a princess and gives you the full Disney experience.  The West Wing is also nice.  A good Disney touch but it is extremely dark and actually a little chilly.  So wear a jacket and keep your eye on the portrait of the prince whenever the storm comes.  The last room is I believe called the book room/library? It's basically just a room with portraits from the movie.  My least favorite room but it's nice to walk around in after you've finished your meal just to take a look. \\n\\n   Before I start with the lunch and dinner tips and reviews let me help you out with the most important part. Getting a reservation. Because let's face it, it's near impossible and quite frankly probably IMPOSSIBLE to just walk in Be Our Guest.  \\n   You basically NEED a reservation and they get snatched up fast.  If you buy your ticket to Disneyworld ahead of time be sure to log onto the mydisneyexperience app and try to make a reservation everyday for every time that you'll be in the lovely Magic Kingdom. Dinner is absolutely ideal but lunch is excellent as well so don't pass up the opportunity to dine here if all the dinner times are taken. \\n   Now, let's say you didn't buy your ticket so far ahead of time, or you forgot or were unable to get a reservation. If you are extremely lucky you can try very hard on the app the two days before and especially the night before/morning of that you will be in Magic Kingdom. People tend to cancel their reservations around then so you have a fighting chance if you keep checking.  I've made many last minute reservations to Be Our Guest the morning of or night before. So there is hope! Just keep on swimming!! \\n\\nLunch- is quick service but you're still going to need reservations.  Most of the food is the same, however I admit dinner selection is bigger as well as more delicious.  My favorite thing to however is also available during lunch, which is the braised pork.  It's absolutely delicious and to die for!!! Don't miss out on it!!!!!!!!!! \\nThe dessert selection of lunch mainly consists of cupcakes.  I highly recommend the Master's Cupcake. Super moist chocolate cake with a nice swirl of the grey stuff(it's delicious). \\n\\nDinner- a nice sit down and order establishment. It's also the only time and place you'll be able to have a meet and greet with the Beast. \\nThe food is superb. I highly recommend the braised pork.  The steak is excellent as well.  The French Onion Soup is also delicious. \\nI've eaten at Chef de France in Epcot and I have to say I prefer Be Our Guest.  It's cheaper, food is equally as delicious and has an impeccable ambiance that satisfies my Disney nerd. \\nThe dessert for they grey stuff IS delicious. Is it my favorite thing ever? Okay no. It's hyped up, but still highly recommended in my opinion. It's all part of the experience!!! \\n\\nSo enjoy this step into fantasy because Be Our Guest really is one of a kind and there is reason why it's such a difficult place to get a reservation for.  You won't be disappointed!!"},{"name":"Meehan's Public House - Atlantic Station","address":"232 19th St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Although the menu is somewhat limited you get a lot of good food for the money.

The flank steak is the most beautiful, freshest, and brightest red meat I've seen (if ordered on the side).

I grew up loving the Beauty and the Beast movie and it is my favorite Disney film ever. I didn't give it a full five stars because of how overpriced the food is, but you really pay for the experience. The best recommendation I can give is to be sure you reserve online prior to your trip visit. Somehow my bf and I got lucky with A New Years day reservation during lunch, we booked it back in September. \\nWhen you walk in to the restaurant, you'll use your magic band to confirm reservations and order with one of the staff members. After you place your order, you pick where you want to sit. I only remember seeing the West Wing and the Grand ballroom. We chose to sit in the West Wing and luckily there were seats open. The attention to detail of this entire restaurant was amazing. There were props of the rose in the glass, the mirror, the beast's portrait and the torn curtains. The ballroom was so gorgeous that if you pay attention to the windows it has the snow feature, almost as if it was real. Everything looked like it did in the movie, I can't wait to be back for dinner on our next trip to Disney world.\\n\\nHere are the items we tried from the lunch menu:\\n\\nSeared Tuna Nicoise Salad with poached egg: This was good and very fresh, the portion was pretty good. I really enjoyed the salad dressing.\\n\\nBraised Pork: This was accompanied with roasted green beans and mashed potatoes. The flavors in this dish added nicely and was actually better than my tuna dish. \\n\\nMaster's Cupcake topped with \\"Grey Stuff': The dessert was my favorite and the reason why i think most guests are intrigued to go here.

Alas, this time we should have stayed with one of our regular spots. We pulled in and saw one car in the lot (we should have taken this as a sign), but we ventured towards the front door regardless. There was a piece of paper on the front door indicating that there was a UFC fight on pay per view that required a $20 per head cover charge. We paused and started to discuss it, when the doorman said we could ignore it since we were just there for dinner. Granted, the cover started at 7pm,and we arrived at around 630. We accepted and entered. \\n\\nOur waitress was friendly, but seemed unsure of herself and had to ask for confirmation of our order several times. We ordered the nachos and their Prime Rib special. A few minutes later my salad arrived, and it was lackluster at best. The dressing was yellowed and looked like something that had set on the shelf too long. I dared a few bites, but spared the balance. Five minutes later the doorman approached us and said they would be collecting the $20 per head for the fight. We looked at him in a dumbfounded manner based on what he told us before we even entered. We informed him that we hadn't received our dinner yet, and he assured us that anyone present at 7 would have to pay. We flagged down our waitress and explained what he had said before we entered, and she said not to worry. We took a little solace in that, and our nachos arrived just after. The nachos were right on par with my salad, bland and obviously microwaved. My Prime Rib made its appearance at our table, and I honestly thought they had cooked up a chuck steak instead. Even coloring across the slab, when it was ordered medium rare. In cutting into it, it looked to be a very sub-prime cut. None of the usual characteristics of Prime Rub whatsoever. The seasoning was bland as well, not at all what I would have expected given the $24 price tag. It was accompanied by broccoli that looked old, and was room temperature at best. Then came the garlic mashed potatoes, which were cold for the first several bites, but were flavorless. I understand this is bar food, but if you can't get nachos right, what hope is there? \\n\\nWe paid our bill and left at 7pm, and received a brief and insincere \\"sorry\\" from the staff. All in all, we were completely unimpressed and will not be returning. I would suggest that if the new owners want to see a system and service that works, buy your staff dinner at the Broadway Saloon. Then you can see how great service and good food is done.

It's self bus and you order at the window and take a number where someone brings you your order from the kitchen in about 20 minutes, the place is busy be prepared to wait or get it to go. The food was great my husband practically licked the plate it was that good. The green sauce was my favorite but they were both amazing and I recommend getting your order Christmas style so you can get a good taste of both of them.

I ate here yesterday with my hubby and family and STILL cannot stop thinking about how delicious and well-made the food is here. I am sad to see not too many people parked in this establishment's lot whenever I drive by, and all I can say is they are missing out on a heavenly jewel of tremendously spiced cuisine.\\n\\nThe decor  of the place, both inside and out, will not impress...but do not let that sway you. Hit up the buffet between 11-3pm on the weekdays and you will be taking your palate to pleasure town. Your wallet will be happy too since the cost is 8.95 per person. Trust me...the quality and taste of the food is worth MUCH more than that. You have an array of succulent dishes to try and plenty of sauces to pair with. Dishes include vegetarian options with okra, onion, peas, mushroom, potatoes, all in their own array of spices, some with tofu (and some not), and all drenched in mouthwatering curry sauces. You then have several chicken dishes, and staples like tikka masala, and their tandoori chicken (literally falls off the bone). I was so impressed at how fresh and tender their chicken was- most indian buffers disappoint me with hard and crusty tandoori. And no one wants crusty tandoori...believe me. And oh...back to the tikka masala. I wish I seriously had lined my purse with ziplock or smuggled in a tupperware (haha would never do that, but it tempted me), because that sauce was TO. DIE. FOR. And as for your carbs, they got that on lock too. Naan was fresh and conplimentary (kept em coming!), and the bismati rice was very soft. Perfect for sucking up all the wonderful sauce. Yum! Oh and, since I'm not sure of their actually name I came up with my own...try the honey balls! They are warm and gooey and melt in your mouth and a perfect balance of sweet and savory. My husband and I got lots of laughs out of enjoying the honey balls hahaha. Seriously though...so good.\\n\\nThis is THE place to go for indian. I love Moghul too. But I even found Royal's staff to be friendlier than Moghul's enployees. Good indian cuisine nonetheless, from both restuarants. Overall I would give Royal 10 stars if I could.

We smartly came right when they opened (at 11am) - and NO line up (thank goodness).  \\nThe interior is beautiful, just as everyone mentioned - bright, roomy, and welcoming. It has very tasteful d√©cor, from the wallpaper, light fixtures, and the stained glass. My husband were seated promptly, and served with cucumber infused water (YUM!)  - up to this point, I would be giving Ahn + Chi five stars.\\n\\nI have to minus one star for their STICKY menu.  For a restaurant that does not take care of the menu, doesn't deserve 5 stars in my books, regardless of how good the food and service is... Any way, the menu selection is not huge; however it has good variety, and unique items. We tried B√∫n B√≤ Hu - beef brisket, Vietnamese ham, pork hock and thick vermicelli in spicy broth ($14) and the Om Bowl - Grilled organic tofu, crispy spring roll, okra & shiitake mushroom over a bed of greens & mixed herbs (vegan, $15). The food came a little slower than expected, knowing that the restaurant was less than ¬º full. Nevertheless, both dishes were excellent! The price was reasonable, justified by the picturesque presentation and creativity of the dishes. \\n\\nAnother one star deduction for our level of thirstiness after lunch - perhaps it was the MSG in the dishes?

The service is superb - and it's no wonder they've received a handful of James Beard awards for best chef and outstanding wine service.  The servers are also knowledgable when it comes to wine and they have an extensive wine list.  We went with the servers recommendations and were happy with the suggestions.\\n\\nThe food itself is also quite good.  My favorite for the night was definitely the tricolor sea urchin pasta.  While I am not a fan of foam (a la the late 2000s trend), this dish was definitely not over-foamed and I hardly noticed.  \\n\\nThe remainder of the dishes were mostly well balanced and pasta was certainly al dente.  The meats were tender and well flavored.  I did think a few dishes were a little too salty for my palate, but I do tend to eat very lite.

Both good... the pork ones were very large, and my favorite of the two.

Gone are the days of the Disney Village, where those interested in some peace and quiet could leave a theme park, and hop on a bus to a quaint little shopping and dining area and eat some of the better food found in the Disney World complex.  While the quiet and quaint are long gone, Disney is trying to make up for it with the food stars that are dotting the soon-to-be Disney Springs area (once Pleasure Island) known as the Landing.  The best for allergy concerns BY FAR has to be Erin McKenna's Bakery, an offshoot of her popular Babycakes bakery in New York City, that specializes in making high-quality baked goods without most of the most common allergens found in cupcakes, donuts, and breads (gluten, dairy, eggs and soy).  Now, how does it taste?  As good, if not better than you'd expect.  A family with varying dietary needs will be very happy with the taste and consistency of all of the offerings, and allergy sufferers will feel like they were let loose in their own personal food paradise.  All of the things we tried were outstanding, the standouts were the fun and varied donut flavors and the cinnamon-sugar toastie loaf (like a turbo-charged pound/crumb cake) which tastes as good as it sounds.  \\nTo be frank, the area around these shops has little seating at this time.  My hope is that the landing once construction is completed will have more for these small boutique shops with limited indoor space.  We were able to find some tables near the crabhouse and Irish restaurant just a few yards down from the bakery.  At peak times, finding a seat may be more difficult so get them packaged well to go.  Also, DO NOT try to access the Downtown Disney area after 5:00 PM without a serious traffic jam in either direction due to the HUGE amount of construction and limited pedestrian access as a result.  My advice, visit for a breakfast or early day treat and then find your way into the parks later.

I wasn't particularly impressed with my take-out order from this 4.5-star rated Thai Restaurant. I'm sure my 3-star review reflected that. \\n\\nWell my second try netted me a delicious meal. I've been kind of obsessed with som tum gai yang lately. That's roasted bird (chicken or game hen) with papaya salad. The spicy, tangy, salty, fishy papaya salad is a crispy, crunchy offset to the savory, juicy marinated roast chicken. It's a pretty healthy meal and when done right, is insanely delicious. \\n\\nThe roast half chicken from Thai Fresh is awesome. The marinade goes deep, with color and flavor penetrating well into the meat of the chicken. The broiled skin has a nice delicious fatty flavor and bright orange color, and the sweet dipping sauce provides a sweet compliment to the savory meat. The quantity is plentiful and juicy all the way through. While they don't offer a combo dish, you can order a chicken and salad and it would easily be enough for two people to make an average size som tum gai yang combo. Just be careful. If, like me, you prefer your som tum spicy, these guys will deliver. I went 4-hot today (I think that means 4-stars in their vernacular) and it's face-melting, nose-running, lip-burning hot. They don't fuck around. I expect to be experiencing this fiery spiciness again in a few hours on the outro. \\n\\nThe folks here are super nice too. One look at my order and the guy asked if I had been to Thailand. We discussed the different styles of som tum and where he found his favorite on his last trip (from a stall in front of a 7-11 in Chiang Mai). He asked me to let him know how I liked it... well, here it is. \\n\\nI REALLY like it. Had this been my first visit, this would be an easy 5-star.

I am so confused by the Yelp rating and many good reviews, but I see similar experiences to mine sprinkled in so I have to wonder if there is a rogue team that takes over the place one day a month or something. \\n\\nWe walked in this past Saturday around 8:30pm and was sat right away in the patio. We were able to order a bottle of wine and some appetizers (raw oysters and steak tartare) pretty quickly. About 15 minutes went by and we got our wine. Not a big deal, but they weren't busy and there were plenty of people working so not sure why other than apathy or maybe they are just trying to give the true Parisian experience where you are ignored for no good reason. When they did deliver it, they actually brought it to the table next to us, who was also waiting an unusual amount of time. Luckily, they denied the bottle and it eventually found it's way to us.\\n\\nOysters and tartare came out shortly after. The oysters were actually quite decent. The tartare though was about as bland as can be and, with the quail egg, ended up being almost like some kind of mushy baby food. Admittedly, we ate it, but I wouldn't order it again. \\n\\nOur entrees, bouillabaisse and duck, came out in a reasonable amount of time. That said, I wish they spent a little more time preparing them. Actually, less for the duck, cause that thing was torched dry. And the bouillabaisse - they should be ashamed at calling it that. More like a poorly executed gumbo, with a thick sauce of not cooked flour and a minuscule amount of poorly cooked seafood. \\n\\nIf they are going for the Parisian tourist trap experience they nailed it. Slow service, sub par food, and overpriced for what you get (it would actually be reasonably priced if they executed well). At least on the evening of April 29, 2019. It seems from other reviews they nail it most other days."},{"name":"P&R Restaurant And Ice Cream Parlor","address":"208 Dudley St","city":"Boston","stars":"3.5","text":"I ordered food from here and it didn't taste that great.

The biggest thing that I want to mention is to make sure to LOOK at what you are booking as there are offers for rooms that are non refundable. The claim is that they offer a \\"discount\\" with these offers versus the standard AAA rate. To be honest, I swore that I used the AAA rate as that is common when I book a room, but their accounting department apparently said that I did not.\\n\\nWhat I didn't realize was that they billed my credit card the ENTIRE amount of the stay beforehand and not a standard deposit like most hotels do. \\n\\nFast forward a couple of weeks and my travel companion had a serious medical condition that caused a narrowing of a bile duct in his liver. After weeks of suffering this condition, we realized that there was no way that we could make this trip until he recovered (he is still undergoing treatment).\\n\\nSo when I went online a week before our designated stay at the hotel to cancel, it made mention on the cancellation notice that I would lose the deposit paid. \\n\\nI then proceeded to call the hotel where I was linked to accounting where I got a voicemail. I left my name and number, but no response. I called the next day and got the same - linked to accounting, voicemail and subsequently, no response.\\n\\nTwo days later, I sent an e-mail where I requested a response before having to report this to management - I received no response for over a week.\\n\\nAfter one week, I did get a call from an accounting representative. She was apologetic about the lack of response, but informed me that she had been on vacation and that her back-up should have responded (he didn't).\\n\\nSo I explained the situation with regards to our cancellation being for a medical emergency. She asked me to forward my confirmation e-mail and once I did this, I immediately got a response stating that they could not reimburse ANY of the cost of the reservation because that rate was non-refundable.\\n\\nSo in addition to my partner having a very serious medical condition that caused us to cancel our trip, we also lost close to $800 because of good ole cold, corporate greed!\\n\\nDue to this lack of sensitivity, I will NEVER recommend friends or family to stay at a Crowne Plaza or any IHG owned property. The other two hotels that we booked hotels at on this same trip were very apologetic about the medical emergency and one that had charged a $51 deposit, credited my card the NEXT DAY!\\n\\nI would encourage IHG to start showing a little empathy when it comes to someone having a life threatening medical emergency. A one week notice of cancellation should have been well enough time to still sell the room to another guest. My thought is that they probably did and then just pocketed our $800 with no thought whatsoever.\\n\\nShame on you, Crowne Plaza and IHG!"},{"name":"A Brasileira Bar & Grill","address":"2417 S Hiawassee Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"2.5","text":"True Brazilian restaurant.

That said, it's pretty ordinary, a little overpriced, and the portions are inconsistent.\\n\\nI've come here twice now. The first time, I ordered three tacos al pastor. I was pleased that they came with just cilantro, onion, and a slice of lime. I've still yet to find a carne al pastor in Portland that really delivers perfection. El Local's was pretty good, with a little sweetness and tanginess, but I thought it needed a little more kick. While adding salsa helped, it defeated the purpose a bit by drowning out the original flavors of the meat. Each taco was $1.50, which is a good price, but they weren't double-wrapped in their tortillas, and none of them had tons of meat. Too bad, as the tortillas were great! Unfortunately, unlike with some other Mexican carts in Portland, I was still hungry after three tacos. They weren't at all bad, but they didn't really knock me out, nor did they really fill me up. \\n\\nToday, I had a carnitas burrito. As it didn't come with sour cream, I had them add it to the mix, which featured meat, rice, pinto beans, cheese, and guacamole. Big and fat, it was expertly wrapped so as to contain its generous portions of ingredients. The carnitas was solid, though perhaps it could've been a little more moist. I like it when it's really shredded and falling apart, and El Local's was a little drier and chunkier. The rice was OK, but nothing special. The beans tasted pretty dry and undercooked to me, which was a bummer. The guacamole was quite tasty. Clearly freshly made. I really liked how big the burrito was (especially in contrast to the tacos), but at the same time, it was not at all mixed. One bite would give me nothing but pork, another nothing but sour cream, and another only beans. Had it been mixed better, perhaps the juicier ingredients might've improved the beans. $7 is a little steep for a burrito, but I'd pay it for something that truly delivered. This burrito, while decent, didn't merit that price tag.\\n\\nSalsas here generally tasted kind of diluted. The roja seemed like it would've been great, had it had a little more kick to it, and the verde was nice and fresh, but it didn't impart flavor nearly as well as it could've. There was a dark green salsa, too, which was much spicier, but fairly one-dimensional. Again, a really nice salsa might've improved the burrito some, but it didn't here.\\n\\nEl Local isn't bad, but it's not really great, either. If it delivered a little more on taste or quantity, I'd give them another star. In the meantime, I think I'll go to the other carts in the pod and seek Mexican food elsewhere. If I'm really feeling Mexican food and am at that pod, I might return, but only for a taco or two to satisfy a craving, not for a whole meal."},{"name":"Playoffs Sports Bar And Grille","address":"512 Middlesex Tpke","city":"Billerica","stars":"2.5","text":"This used to be such a better place, but something must have changed.

What pissed me off was when my 21-year-old friend was turned down because her ID was vertical and from New York. I don't understand why they did this since her ID was unexpired. When asked why, they replied with, \\"We do not take vertical IDs\\". I don't understand why they don't since it is legally still valid and it clearly states the person is of legal age to drink. The manager was also very unprofessional and you can tell he was nervous to break the news. Ended up going to Yard House and was served with no problems. If they are so nervous about IDs they should buy a scanner, instead of losing customers!!!

My other half orders the bbeodagi gamgatang (spicy pork bones) which also come with stone rice. \\n\\nAlso we ordered the Korean cold noodles (Mui Naengmyeon) which is pretty good for those hot days. \\n\\nOn the down side service can be improved as this is a family own business, they should hire more servers. Also in regard to side dishes they have only  kimchi (spicy cabbage) and spicy turnip. They should provide more side dishes ie potatoes etc. \\n\\nOther than that the ladies that work there are super nice and always give me extra kimchi ;) will come back !"},{"name":"Bobby's Burger Palace","address":"6000 N Terminal Pkwy, Gate 26 Concourse B","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"I expected better from a restaurant with Bobby Flay's name on it.

In reality, of course, I can only ever try up to 2 pots of tea otherwise I get too full.\\n\\nIn addition to your tea, you get a selection of both savory and sweets (they have a couple of different dietary options available). The traditional version that we had on our visit included the following savory items:\\nThai red curry egg salad with mango chutney, red pepper, red onion & cucumber\\nMumbai chai tea infused apple butter with sliced apples & smoked cheddar on a warm croissant\\nLemon-herb mascarpone, cucumber & arugula\\nHouse-made port fig compote on ciabatta with prosciutto, pears & brie\\nTarragon chicken salad, candied walnuts, salt roasted pears & pickled grapes\\n\\nThe middle layer of sweet items included:\\nChocolate layer sponge cake with whipped ganache\\nRose cupcake with raspberry mascarpone frosting\\nLemon cream cheese tart\\nGlazed Thai tea dome cake with coconut jelly\\n\\nAnd the top tier consisted of:\\nCitrus scone with devonshire cream & house-made strawberry jam\\n\\nAfternoon Tea/High Tea might sound a bit dainty but don't underestimate how filling it can be. Pro tip: Don't just eat all of the savory items and eat the sweet items last... You'll most likely find that it's too much of a sweet overload at the end of your meal. Instead, mix things up and eat a little savory, a little sweet, and then repeat.

I probably wouldn't have finished the turkey and jicama slaw sandwich if it weren't for the bacon and avocado - holy goodness.

It was through one of the many food delivery services that service Portland: this one happened to be door dash. Delivery was going to take an hour, which was fine since it would get here in time for my husband to eat after he got off work and I could keep working myself. But 45 minutes after they accepted payment, the delivery guy called to let me know the owner was demanding cash payment (she didn't take cards), and still had to prepare the food. Anyone who uses food delivery knows they should have had the order ready to go (or close to ready), and they were ALREADY PAID! They don't submit the order without payment. I called the food cart to see if the problem was the delivery guy or the restaurant, and the lady said she does not contract with any delivery service, she needs to be paid, and it is a scam. As I was explaining that I already paid her, she hung up on me. Mind you, I spoke to the delivery guy and she told him she still had to cook the food and it would take another 20 minutes--this was after she demanded cash payment. Meanwhile, while I'm looking for a customer service number to door dash to cancel, they call to let me know the restaurant said something about her pin machine being down and refused to fulfill the order, which sounds less like a scam and more like someone who had another problem and decided to cancel the order last minute. After the customer waiting almost an hour and a delivery guy waiting for at least 30 minutes. Maybe the food is good. I don't know. Maybe the lady is as lovely as the reviews say. I don't know. I do know that she hung up on me. I also know I've used door dash several times and never had any problem until tonight. I also know that I don't trust people who change their story so many times and try to get a cash payment for something that was already paid for. How this woman stays in business is beyond me. That wasn't just bad customer service, it was weird as heck.

I'll be sure not to forget the next time I'm looking for a yummy lunch, and am so indebted to some local Cambridge friends for suggesting this place during a work outing.\\n\\nWe stopped by at the peak of lunch on a week day and it was busy. Luckily, the light rain outside deterred other patrons from sitting in the outdoor seats that were adequately protected from the showers, and we were able to find a place to relax and eat. Although the people working there were inundated with orders, they were very friendly and looked like they were trying their hardest to bang out the food and still make it look presentable. The food I saw other people looked really good, as I spied colorful quiches, heart-warming soups, toasty sandwiches, and rich desserts.\\n\\nFor my lunch I had the Crema grilled chicken sandwich. Oh my goodness, it was so delicious and I especially liked the cheesy corn spread and the generous slices of fresh avocado, piled high on top of juicy chicken on perfectly toasted sourdough bread. Now that's what I call a sandwich with soul! I was also able to try a sample of some of their desserts that we shared as a group, and although the chocolate brownie, chocolate chip cookie, oatmeal cookie, and homemade granola bar were good, the mud pie was awesome.

Last night, however, was a very different story. Such a disappointment, and I was honestly embarrassed to have brought my friends here. After having such a wonderful experience here the first time, I decided I would take my 3 friends along. We again purchased the Groupon and I made a reservation for all 4 of us a week prior. We drove over an hour to get there and we arrived just before 7pm, an hour before the comedy show. The waiter told us we didn't have a reservation. I insisted that we did. He said they were filling up quickly, but he would still be able to squeeze us in. I was relieved, but not for long. After he sat us it took about 20 min before a waiter finally came over with menus. We ordered food and drinks. All of our food came out a different times, about 15/20 min between each pizza and each app. In all it took about 2 hours to finally receive all of our food orders. When we asked one of the waiters if our pizza was still coming he snapped back at me that we should have placed our orders before the comedy show (we actually did, but I wasn't going to argue with him). When my pizza finally came at about 9pm it was wrong, despite telling our waiter I had a dairy allergy. When we wanted another drink our waiter told us we would have to order another from the bar. We did that. And then another waiter got mad at us for ordering drinks at the bar when we were seated at a table. None of the staff was even remotely on the same page. And the comedy was painfully bad. The only good thing about this experience was the food.

I will write a review for both the breakfast buffet and dinner. In short, the breakfast was edible but the dinner is when things got really bad. \\n\\nBreakfast: it's ok, but expensive. The food was fair. It wasn't the best but for your money you'd think that they would at least offer free coffee or juice. The eggs were really rubbery and the potatoes were hard. My husband literally spit out the biscuit, it tasted horrible. Waffles that you can make were fine. It was edible but not the best. The only reason my review gets 2 stars instead of 1 is because the breakfast was edible. \\n\\nDinner: ok, this was terrible! When you walk in, it's literally like a ghost town. You often naught find anyone at the hostess table. Imagine that you walk into a sit down restaurant and you find no hostess and no one in sight to seat you. It immediately gives you weird vibes. We had to walk around and chase down servers that intentionally did not make eye contact with you. We actually ended up ordering to-go because we didn't feel like sitting there being subjected to sub par service and having to tip on top of that? No thanks. \\n\\nFinally when someone acknowledged us near the hostess stand they told us we had to order to-go at the bar. Ok... so we walk to the bar and sit down and the bartender says \\"you don't order here, you have to go over there\\" and pointed half-heartedly to this small station where there was no one at.. so we were getting annoyed at this point but we walked over and stood there awkwardly for about 5 mins until someone finally acknowledged us.. mind you several waiters walked past us before we were acknowledged. \\n\\nOk, now to the food. It was so bad... the fries were soggy and limp, the chicken on the salad was dry and overall everything just tasted sub par. My salad also had several\\npieces of lettuce that were dark brown. The food was also lukewarm .. you could tell heat lamps were used and nothing tasted fresh. \\n\\nAll the negative reviews here are accurate. The wait staff is unhelpful and unfriendly, the food is below sub-par and the atmosphere is off. Furthermore, in just walking around and observing, we saw a lot of tables were dirty with leftover dirty dishes for god knows how long they were there. Try to avoid this place at all costs.

The service was polite, and prompt. There is a little quirk though. In the middle of a restaurant is a small high table, where they carve the duck that people order. The odd thing is there is a table for two right next to this carving table. People were seated at this table, and it seemed odd to me to sit there and have a ducked carved right next to you, when you didn't even order duck.\\n\\nNow for the food, we were brought a small amuse-bouche a squash soup topped with foam, it was pretty yummy and hey it's free, I have low expectations when it's free.\\n\\nFor appetizers we had the Soft Cooked Farm Egg (with Burgundy Snails, Foraged Mushrooms, Steel Cut Oat \\"Risotto\\", Spring Garlic) and the tuna tartare (it actually has a fancier name). The farm egg was probably the most interesting part of the meal, it was served over steel cut oats cooked risotto styled so it was infused with flavor  and parsley -which gave it a lovely green flavor. I did find it slightly salty.\\nThere was, on top of this \\"risotto\\", a runny egg and a piece of prosciutto, while it looked pretty, I am not sure it added anything.\\n\\nThe tuna tartare came on a plate with a splash of spring edible flowers.

It's good, cooked right, lovely cut of meat, nice slice of fish, but it's nothing special, as in the flavors aren't surprising or unique, as in you might forget what you had a month later.

Parking is plentiful, unless you come around lunch when all the local professionals are taking their break. No complaints on a lovely sunny day like today. You line up and look at the menu of pre-made bowl options. Definitely healthy oriented, and I love that the calorie estimates are beside each bowl. After all, you can \\"eat healthy\\" all you want, but if you're at a caloric surplus, you're never going to lose that extra body fat. Anyways, I was feeling a little hungrier than usual, so went for an option that actually topped the 500 calorie mark, the peanut butter and jelly bowl. It had froyo, granola, but was topped with a big scoop of peanut butter circled with some jelly. It was exactly what I imagined such a concoction would taste like. The fat from the PB was just enough weight to turn an otherwise light dish into a filling one. Everything tasted fresh, nothing was overpoweringly sweet either. These bowls are quite large, as by the end of my meal, the frozen yogurt was starting to melt. \\n\\nStaff was very friendly, being patient to describe the options and customizations available.

The cashier was very friendly and explained the menu to us. The menu was impressive to me because they offered a great variety of items for GREAT prices.

Granted, additional toppings are $1, but you might still be able to find a bowl that has all your desired toppings.\\n\\nI tried the Summit Bowl and subsituted the cherries for bananas while my friend tried the Greens Guru. My friend really enjoyed his bowl and would return to Rush Bowls again! I will also be returning to Rush Bowls in the future, but had one minor issue with my bowl. \\n\\nFirst I will say that I LOVED the granola and honey that was on top. But, I loved it so much that I ate almost all of it first and then tried to eat the remaining portion of my bowl. The acai was overpowering for the bowl and I could not taste any strawberries or bananas in my bowl. I think that  if I ate the granola and acai portion bowl all together instead of it separately, I would have enjoyed it a lot more.

I'm not sure what the fine print is or what the hang up was but our bartender did not give us the deal. Another bartender asked if something was wrong and we explained that we had signed up for the app so he said he'd fix our check. Our original bartender came over to the other bartender and was asking what the problem was like she was annoyed he was fixing it. It still wasn't correct, i paid $12.50 instead of $11 but it wasn't worth saying something again. Moral of the story, ask all the questions and get the full story before expecting to get the deal because obviously we missed something and our bartender wasn't willing to provide us with the information so we knew for the future.

The restaurant was a lot bigger than I was thinking it was going to be, it has a bar area, dining room and private party area. \\nWe had reservations for 5:30 and were sat right away. We were one of four tables in the restaurant at this time. Our server was very prompt with coming to us and filling our waters, getting us table bread and seeing if we would like to order. The menu was very reasonably priced. Most appetizers were about $12, pasta dishes from $15 to $20 and meat entrees were between $20 and $30. My favorite part was that mixed drinks were only $8! Since we were doing restaurant week it was $30 for a three course dinner.We ordered the meatball appetizers which were great pretty good. The meatballs melted in your mouth and I liked that it was served with garlic bread. For our main course we ordered the chicken Parmesan and lasagna. Both were very filling good sized portions.  I thought the lasagna was very good. The sauce on the chicken Parmesan pasta was unfortunately a little grainy and watery.\\nFor dessert, we ordered lava cake and the cannoli. I thought both of these were delicious but nothing overly exciting.\\nOverall, it was a good experience but the food wasn't anything that I couldn't make at home with the same quality. I think they need to work on training their staff more. Every time we got a new course the server gave the dish to the wrong person at the table, I saw her do this to multiple other tables as well. Also when we left, the hostess and some other servers were at the host stand having an unrelated to work conversation and not one of them turned to tell us to have a good night.\\nI think this place is a good place to go for dinner in a convenience situation but I would not take the time out to plan to go here."},{"name":"pho d'lite","address":"4415 Skyline Drive, Suite 2","city":"Burnaby","stars":"3.5","text":"What a disappointment, ordered 3 bowls of pho to go. 2 beef 1 chicken.

When I got home I had to flood them with hot sauce and a pepper sauce just to try to wake them up. \\n\\nWould I order them again? Yes, but I would go home and put onions, garlic and seasoning in them and slow cook them in a frying pan. They needed a kick for sure.\\nMy husband purchased the dinner portion of chitterlings and he did not like that they put his chitterlings on a bed of rice. He would have rather paid for an extra amount of chitterlings than to pay the dinner portion($5 more than lunch)and get rice under his chitterlings. He felt he got less chitterlings because they were place on a bed of rice but he paid more money than the lunch portion.\\nThe collard greens were delicious and the potato salad was good too.\\nThe bagger could have saved money by asking if we needed hot sauce as I threw my unwanted packs away. Most take out orders may need condiments but they should ask the customer rather than bag them anyway, because the condiments may get thrown in the trash if not needed.

In hindsight, I should have stuck with the T&T food court instead. Being completely empty during lunch hour was probably a sign...\\n\\nThe store is quite small, with 5 or 6 tables and a high counter. I wanted to dine in, but ended up ordering at the till because there wasn't much direction given as to what to do nor were there any menus at tables - just the big menu over the till. The menu was confusing as there were items listed with prices, but the there was what I guess were their feature items which had pictures, but no prices?? I took my chances and ordered something with a picture, not knowing the price - the mixed beef pho. Ended up being around 10.50 after tax. There also isn't a choice for size. I would say my bowl ended up being in between your average small and large. In terms of dollar vs quantity, it was pretty reasonable compared to other places. I found the broth a little on the sweeter side, so I am guessing they go a little heavier on the rock sugar. It was quite clean and clear, which I like. The mixed beef comes with beef balls, brisket and \\"raw\\"beef. The raw beef was completely cooked when I got it, so that was quite disappointing. I would say they are on the stingier side when it comes to the protein.

You need to make a reservation to wait in line to order food yourself off a tablet-- only to then need to go find a table yourself (just like any other of their quick service places). Maybe we hit the place on an off day, but the food was awful. Half the orders were cold, the chicken and several other dishes were unseasoned, and the fries were soggy (and also inconsistently portioned since I literally had twice the amount of French fries as my sister-in-law).  The atmosphere was kinda cool, but it didn't seem like anything particularly above any of the other places in Disney.  The whole concept of the restaurant was just really bizarre. You're essentially making a reservation to get quick service food that's lower quality than elsewhere in the park even as the prices are marked way up and the atmosphere nothing special.

He loved this drink so much that he had to ask him what to ask for to get it again the next time we come in. I got the remedy 44 cocktail off the menu and was honestly a little hesitant because it had balsamic in it and sounded a little different .. But it was so delicious.

You can see right into the kitchen as there is nothing blocking the way.  The kitchen kind of looked unorganized and almost like a post apocalyptic trade station. There is a large glass counter that has different kind of pizza that you can get by the slice. On the wall by the register there is a huge large print menu that takes up the whole wall.  This definitely feels like a pickup pizza place as there was only 3 tables to choose from. It looked like a nice store with some great natural lighting \\n\\nMenu - not your average kind pizzas that's for sure. If you are looking for the same ole same ole kind of pizzas like pepperoni or what not then you won't find that here. All then pizzas have a nice unique twist on them.  They all looked wonderful so it was hard to choose which one I wanted. There was just so much variety and unique ingredients for each pizza. They have the normal red sauce but also a chimichurri sauce as well. Plus there was also an oil base one and pesto. They technically have 3 sizes but not really. The small is only for gluten free, so if you want a large gluten free you are out of luck. Same with the regular, you can only choose between medium or large. But the menu is an amazing concoction of different kinds of pizza.  The one downside was that there weren't any prices on the main menu board. If you want to see the prices I highly suggest looking at the paper menu\\n\\nService - the service was good. The younger gentleman was helpful and explained how things worked since it was our first time. He gave some good recommendations and was overall pleasant.  The guys in the open space that is a kitchen thou were all kept to themselves. \\n\\nFood - I ordered the Damon pizza which came with salami, green chiles, red onions and bell peppers, roasted garlic bulbs and a spicy slaw. The pizza was a huge wonderful looking concoction of awesomeness.  I have never had a pizza with this kind of ingredients so I was eager to get started. The pizza was cooked well but there was little to no sauce so you couldn't taste it all all.  The other ingredients thou all worked together pretty well. The green chiles had a nice flavor and gave some nice heat. The garlic bulbs added a nice compliment to the rest as well. The spicy slaw was very interesting to me. It was good and added a unique twist. All the ingredients worked well together and definitely gave me a taste of something I have never had before. It was a unique taste that overall was good. \\n\\nOverall - the pizza was good, but nothing spectacular. It had it's uniqueness but it wasnt the tastiest pizza I have ever had. On top of that, make sure you order from the paper menu. The price point here is extremely high and the prices are not on the main menu.  My pizza alone cost $30.  As soon as the cashier told me my total I felt like I had got kicked in the nuts. I didn't want to make a scene or anything so i regretfully handed him my card. I died a little bit on the inside. While my pizza was enjoyable it definitely was not worth the steep $30. Adter reviewing the menu the cheapest pizza was like $23. That's a pretty steep price point. I see alot of people enjoy ESP, it was ok and enjoyable, but I just don't see how at that price point. There are tons of other pizza joints like ESP that offer better pizzas at a better price. But yeah it was my fault for not checking the price before ordering, but if I had then I probably would have ordered a salad."},{"name":"Jack and Harry's","address":"1850 N Courtenay Pkwy","city":"Merritt Island","stars":"4","text":"Love this place.

The ramen is very good as well -- the fish and pork tonkotsu broth was fatty, fishy, and yummy and the tomato veggie ramen broth was on the acidic side but also quite. The ajitama was perfectly runny although the ingredients skew on the sweet side (the wood ear mushroom and tofu in my veggie ramen were both sweeter than I'm used to).

One is a room for families with young kids, which includes toys for the kids to play with while the adults sip delicious coffee. There is a large room where you can hang out and talk or have a meeting (while sipping delicious coffee). AND, you can get some work done here if you want to, because there is also a separate quiet room that is perfect when you need to concentrate. I've never seen a coffee shop that is more family-friendly and kid-friendly while also being a perfect place to work. And if you want to hang out outside, there's a large backyard with picnic tables. Even the bathrooms are perfect, one of which has a changing table and baby supplies. The staff is super friendly. The owner is perhaps the sweetest person I've ever met. Go here. Bring your kids. Bring your dog. Bring your colleagues. Bring your appetite, because you're not going to want to stop eating."},{"name":"Burnzie's Old Trail","address":"72 S Grener Ave","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"This place is dope.

And definitely a generous portion of uni. But because of that I'd only recommend it to uni lovers. I LOVE the broth they give you at the end. I'm a huge fan of washing meals down with a good hot soup. \\n- Hot sukiyaki soba: my least favorite. The broth had an interesting (weird?) sweet bacon flavor that I couldn't quite put my finger on. \\n- Green Tea Mille Crepe: a bit small for $9.50, but oh so good. \\n\\nOverall, the prices felt reasonable.

The salad bar was full of at LEAST five different salads, a few assorted slices of cheese, pasta, bread, crackers, and fruit. If the meat (or that addicting cheese bread) doesn't satisfy you (which is almost impossible), the salad bar is FULL of options. Even vegetarians would love this place!\\n\\nWe were in food heaven.

For our other starter, we opted for the Uni Zukushi - four samples of uni atop ika, ama-ebi, hotate, and otoro accompanied by pickled wasabi. Frankly, this blew me away! We absolutely loved it because we love uni, and the chef is so generous. Finally, we ended the meal with the sashimi dinner plate, which came with an assortment of chef's choice fish, ships leaves, and lemon slices - so much better than the typical sampler.\\n\\nAll of the ingredients the chef uses - even down to the ginger salad - are of extremely high quality.

I informed the server who then got managers involved and two of them came over to apologize for the mishap. That was great. They brought out a fresh plate and the second one actually tasted very different-- Markedly better than the one with the bones I had before.. Anyway, the coursing got messed up and I ended up taking more than half of it to go so I didn't really get to enjoy the dish because it's best served fresh.\\n\\nPretty surprised that they didn't comp the dish that was messed up off the check.. Negative points for that missing level of service. Come on, St Regis. I thought you were better than that.\\n\\nAlso had the hamachi starter and the short rib pierogis. Both were great.

There is literally a \\"personal\\" 60 inch flat screen monitor for every last soul occupying a seat.

I've never seen anything like it. \\n\\nGo during a Mexican national (or club level) soccer game, and you'll be able to view it from any angle (horizontally and vertically!) of your choosing.

I don't know - maybe I've just lived a sheltered existence. But I digress...\\n\\nPersonally, I think the waitresses' attire borders ever-so-slightly on demeaning, but that's never stopped Hooters, and at least THIS place isn't actually NAMED after a slang term for a part of the female anatomy. \\n\\nOther than that, Ojos Locos offers up what should be expected of a (small-ish) chain of its type - decent food, passable (if a bit obsequious and fake-flirty) service from the ladies, a small army of on-site security, and the possibility of getting into a fist fight (or worse) on any night when the Tri-Color loses a futbol match to the US or other regional rival. \\n\\nThe bathrooms seemed clean enough, the food wasn't delivered in a particularly speedy fashion (but no mistakes were made even after we started to think they would be), and the waitress told us that our first beer was going to take a while because, while hopping up and down, she \\"had to use the bathroom real bad\\" - and take a while it did. I am just glad that she had time (in theory, anyway) to wash her hands (And punch back in? Do they allow bathroom breaks on the clock?). \\n\\nThe parking lot is huge, there are numerous restroom options, the clientele wasn't particularly macho or douchey the night that I went,  the food is pretty much as described on the menu and reasonably priced, and the service is just north of \\"meh\\", but not worth actually complaining about. \\n\\nAgain, it \\"is what it is\\" - not too many actual \\"Cons\\" to list - just a bit underwhelming and I'm sure the neighbors don't appreciate the rolling regional blackouts due to the Megawatts of electricity they must use for the TVs and sound system.\\n\\nAll that said, I'm sure it could be an awesome place to watch March Madness or an NFL game day (or even both at the same time if it were even possible) - at least if you need to have a view of EVERY GAME from your seat."},{"name":"Bar Louie Plaza on University","address":"4100 N Alafaya Trl, Ste 167 & 173","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"Great service and great drinks!

Roll the clock ahead and the area is now hyper-gentrified, hipster and a legitimate destination.  Unfortunately, the near-campus N. High Street dives which were a highlight of my time at OSU have also been gentrified, but that is a topic for another review.\\n\\nBakersfield is one of seven locations in a regional chain of Mexican (rather than Tex-Mex) drinking and dining establishments.  While their food is good, the emphasis is upon alcohol; scotch and tequila, in particular.  A group of ten coworkers met at Bakersfield after work on Tuesday, and had a great time.\\n\\nIn the mood for a cold beer on a hot day, the Saugatuck Neapolitan Milk Stout hit the spot.  Most of our group drank margaritas, sampling the various menu and blackboard versions, and tasting each other's freely.  There was a consensus that one was far too sour, and another too salty, but the names of the offending margaritas weren't remembered.  The Milk Stout was a decent craft beer, with an interesting berry palate, but understated hops character.\\n\\nAs for dinner, we all went for the house dinner assortment.  Bowls of tortilla chips, fresh but commercial in taste, were complimented by very good versions of guac and pico, and very pedestrian chipolte sauce and cilantro chimmichurri.  Quite a while later, after the chips had been picked through, plates of queso, black beans, pickled jalape√±os and other accompaniments were brought.  They were as good as the now-depleted guac.\\n\\nNext to arrive were heaping platters of salad, in a vinaigrette dressing.  Amidst much mixed greens were detected small cubes of avocado, diced bacon, red onion, cotija cheese and a few sliced hearts of palm.  This was a tasty salad, but there was easily enough of it served to make a hearty meal for the ten of us.\\n\\nMini tacos, an assortment of six per platter, with five platters brought to the table, concluded the dinner.  Of those sampled, the mahi led the pack; fresh, made flavorful by a citrus salad addition and nicely accented by tabasco and cilantro.  The braised short rib taco was decent, although its flavors were a bit muted by an abundance of onion, cilantro, queso fresco and shaved radish.  The ratio of meat to vegetation fell short of the mark.  Finally, the pork al pastor missed the mark completely; neither flavors nor balance paid homage to this classic Mexican dish.  These quibbles aside, the tacos were good and the night out great.\\n\\nBakersfield draws crowds heavily from the Gen-X and Millennial sets, and offers live music-- although not on the Tuesday evening we were there.  The wait staff was hip, friendly and conversational-- in addition to fulfilling the rudimentary tasks of their job quite well.\\n\\nTry the Russell Street Parking Garage, about two blocks away.

I was curious to see if I would be charged 15% for being wasteful since I didn't finish my entire salad.  I am pretty sure that the wasteful charge applies more for folks who request gobs of meat and then only take a bite.  Anyhoo, no waste charges for us.\\n\\nThe meat was pretty dang delicious.  My paleo-loving hunter gatherer partner went down the list to be sure he sampled every item, and he was pleased with each offering.  From the moist bacon-wrapped chicken (you had him at bacon - he doesn't love chicken normally), to the filet and the chicken hearts (he made me try a bite - \\"That tastes like an olive, but gamey,\\" I said.), my generally critical man friend was thoroughly impressed.\\n\\nWe finished with some papaya ice cream thing and a caipirinha, and chatted with Suzan as we were wrapping up our meal.

The downside is it feels very rushed and un-personable if you do not know the menu or are with others who have not been there before. Even after pre-ordering and waiting the food then you still have to again wait for. My advice is to use the Chick-Fil-A one mobile app and just bypass the line.

It was not money well spent.\\n\\nFirst, the decor is...like Frank Sinatra's rec room in 1956. The staircase is beautiful, but that's about it. Wood-covered walls, weird uncomfortable wooden chairs from Betty Draper's kitchen set... Not a fan. We were seated between the bar and the kitchen, and the noise in that place was nightclub-level. We were shouting at the each other all night and the waiter couldn't hear us.\\n\\nSince it's a steakhouse, we expected gargantuan proportions, so we took it easy on the appetizers and instead split a Caesar salad. It was the blandest Caesar I have ever tasted. I don't even think it was dressed. Bald romaine lettuce with shredded, bagged parmesan cheese in it. Gross.\\n\\nThe bf had the Delmonico and I had the steak frites and broccoli gratin. The bf won't eat broccoli, so the frites were my attempt at balancing the side dish disparity as nothing else on the menu called to him. \\n\\nThe food was served with an obvious disregard for plating or presentation. Not in a chic, minimalist sort of way. Just a steak on a plate. That's kind of offensive when I'm paying over $100 for dinner.\\n \\nThe bf loved his steak. It was 20 oz, and probably 1.5 inches thick, which is surprisingly thin for a steakhouse of this calibre. It came with a small mound of caramelized onions, which turned out to be my favorite thing of the night. It was cooked to his liking. \\n\\nThe waiter told us that all the beef is grass fed. I don't know if I believe that.\\n\\nAs another poster mentioned, my steak frites were really frites with a side of steak. The steak was small and cooked to my liking. It was not well-seasoned, however, and I needed steak sauce to eat it. The frites were the thin variety served in a comically large proportion on the plate. They were cold and way overcooked to the point that they were tough and stale-tasting. They were described as being tossed in gremolata. Gremolata my ass. They tasted of nothing but salt. No lemon, no garlic. LOTS of salt. Wayyyy too much salt. The bf hated them, and I had only a few bites.\\n\\nThe broccoli gratin was similarly lackluster. It was fairly bland, there was very little cheese, and the gratin top was more like borderline burnt grated, bagged (again) cheese of an undeterminable origin. I could do this better at home, by a mile. It was also the smallest portion of anything we were served at about 1/4 the size of my portion of frites.\\n\\nThe waiter was nice, but the service was slow and not very attentive. Definitely not the level of service I would expect for that price point. \\n\\nThat plus a couple cocktails was about $130. That's not toooo bad for a steakhouse but super overpriced for the quality.\\n\\nI won't be coming back. You know who does everything better than Grill 23? Mooo...

So this may be an unusual review, since I'll be making direct comparisons to Thai Son. \\n\\nI ordered a small pho with rare beef, brisket, tendon and tripe. I think it was a #17? (At TS, I get the similar rare beef, beef shank, tendon and tripe.)\\n\\nLOCATION: Since I live in Cambie village, TS is much more convenient to get to.\\n\\nDECOR: HP is clean, bright and tastefully decorated. Umm, is this a real Vietnamese restaurant? The lack of hole-in-the-wall-ness almost makes me wary. Oh, and guess what? HP accepts credit cards. What the what?! What kind of Asian restaurant is this? (Thai Son is cash only.)\\n\\nPRICE: At $6.95 for a small here at Hai Phong, this is pretty great value. However, a small at Thai Son runs for $5.65 and it's more filling.\\n\\nBROTH: Although I like TS's broth a lot, HP's has a slightly more complex flavour. HP wins here, but not by much.\\n\\nNOODLES: Noodles at HP were a little overcooked, definitely lacking that al dente quality. Maybe this was a one-time mistake, but I've eaten at TS often enough to know that they consistently cook their noodles well, plus they're more generous with their noodles. TS wins here.\\n\\nMEAT: Holy meat balls, is that ever a lot of meat! My rare beef, brisket, tendon and tripe was mainly beef, but it was cooked to perfection, so no complaints there. My one minor issue was that I enjoy my beef sliced as thin as it can be sliced, and HP's was cut a little thick for my taste. TS has thinner cuts of meat (albeit less), and are more generous with the other toppings ie tripe and tendon. I'd call this a tie.\\n\\nGARNISHES: Both (oddly) serve lemons instead of limes. Both are generous with the basil. But HP serves their beansprouts raw, for which I have to love them. HP wins this round.\\n\\nPS: My mom had the bun bowl with spring rolls and lemongrass chicken. She said it was kind of bland, and the spring rolls were quite small and more like Chinese spring rolls. She was not impressed.\\n\\nPPS: They had an interesting assortment of music playing (at least for a Vietnamese restaurant), which ranged from Destiny's Child (playing as I sat down - nice!) to some sort of sappy Phil Colins-esque song.\\n\\nFINAL VERDICT: It's always great to try new restaurants, and Hai Phong was fairly good. It was a close competition, but I'm staying loyal to Thai Son. Any other challengers?"},{"name":"Temazcal Tequila Cantina","address":"660 Legacy Pl","city":"Dedham","stars":"2.5","text":"Horrible. It was just horrible. We weren't offered any soft drinks or beverages, they just filled the table with glasses of water. The appetizers weren't too bad all though the calamari was rubbery, the nachos were ok as well. They were both nothing to write home to. The entrees were absolutely gross. I had ordered one grilled chicken taco and one carne asada taco, it came with rice and black beans. The tacos weren't big but they were an okay size. The presentation of them was pretty good but it didn't make up for how bland, tasteless, and COLD they were. They were in soft corn tortillas which were not warmed up and almost tasted like a thick pita bread. And it's contents were barely luke warm. The rice on the plate lacked seasoning and it had some corn in it so that enhances the crunch & flavor that the rice lacked. Overall it needed to have salt and Saz√≥n which I was expecting from a restaurant that prides itself in being a \\"cantina\\" mexican restaurant. The black beans tasted like canned Goya beans, not dry cooked beans and it definitely showed. Chipotle tastes 1000X better than this place. The table had 8 people including myself and only 2 finished their meals. More than half of us had gotten the tacos and none of us ate even half of ONE.  Mind you, that looked like one of the most appetizing things on the menu. Speaking of the menu, it's not transparent, it just has a few things in Spanish to make the place seem authentic but it was really horrible.

However, saying that (in today's age) it is important to ensure their patron feels they made the right choice. \\n\\nFinal thing which stuck with me was how good my omelet was. I ordered a Vegetable Omelet with Feta and Cheddar cheese. Perhaps it was the combination of the eggs and feta cheese, but it was amazing. The Omelet was cooked well, not runny and was filled well.

I've been to Chez Nous twice, and I'm glad to say it is good food with good attitude. The host chatted with us about the wines and food and made us feel welcome. The service was good the entire time and the food was worth our time and money. We wanted a relaxed, lip-smacking experience, and that's exactly what we got.\\n\\nI went for the Menu du Jour because I wanted a bit of everything. It was a tough choice between their Pate Maison (don't know how to do accent symbols in Yelp) appetizer and their daily soup special, but I chose their chilled cucumber soup. Delicious! Light, summery, with a touch of mint (this theme will repeat in dessert). The man had the tomato bisque with roasted red bells and found t delicious too.\\n\\nFor the main course I had their Truit au piment fume, and the man had their charcuterie plate (from the appetizer menu). This worked out very well for me because I didn't have to miss out on eating pate :)\\n\\nThe trout was roasted perfectly and flaked off the skin with no effort. The creamy paprika sauce was delicious, and the trout was neatly topped with a nest of fried julienned leek. On the side were carrots and a roasted half-tomato.\\n\\nThe charcuterie plate was well put together, with several styles of pate and sliced meat. I didn't taste enough to review it since my fish was so filling and excellent.\\n\\nWhile the prix fixe menu only offers Creme Caramel (yay for flan without the cinnamon!) and Mousse au Chocolat, you can upgrade to any of their other desserts for the difference in price between the mousse and what you want. The hostess sold me on their dessert special. I forgot its name, but she described it as two meringues in a bed of creme anglaise vanilla sauce, topped with almonds and caramel. The description itself didn't sound too special and I was imagining two crunchy cookie islands on a custard ocean, but I took a chance. And THANK GOODNESS I DID!\\n\\nFirst off, they weren't crunchy meringue cookies. They were soft, fluffy and airy, with a freshly whipped sheen on them. The custard sauce was light in texture and sweetness, offset brilliantly by a beautifully amber caramel sauce which balanced its sweetness with a hint of bitterness (not yet bitter though). If I had to change anything, I would cut back on the sliced almonds, but that's only because I only eat almonds if they've been roasted and salted. Much like my chilled soup, this dessert was light and summery, yes, with a touch of mint :)\\n\\nSo is there a downside to all this deliciousness? Just one - the man ate so much that he had to excuse himself and take a short walk while I finished dessert. Sounded like he needed to ward of an imminent food coma.\\n\\nYou still need a reason to go eat French food here? How about the fact that they don't have a website that makes you embarrassed when you try to look up the menu from work?"},{"name":"Jiko - The Cooking Place - Temporarily Unavailable","address":"2901 Osceola Pkwy","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"This is one of the best restaurants I have eaten in my entire life!

We opted for their amazing breakfast buffet and it did not disappoint. Boma is located inside the Jambo House section of the Animal Kingdom Lodge and is an African cuisine inspired buffet. Now I would take that term loosely. There were only a handful of dishes that were African inspired while the rest were your normal standard breakfast fare. The service is good also. When they ask you for coffee or juice, get both and definitely order their Jungle Juice (combination of lemonade, pineapple, guava, orange, and papaya juice) and you won't be sorry! Dangerously addicting. \\n\\nWe tried a bit of everything but some of our favorite things were definitely the Mickey Waffles with some delicious sausage and bacon. It was so simple but they were cooked perfectly! They also make omelets to order and have a huge selection of pastries and other breakfast staples such as yogurt, fresh fruit, potatoes, bagels and such. We went a little crazy and tried to eat a little bit of everything. I especially enjoyed their bobotie (African spiced corned beef hash) with Chakalaka (African tomato stew). However, my absolute favorite thing that I ate there was the French Toast Bread Pudding with Pecan Praline Sauce. This was so good that I went back for seconds. It is very sweet though so it easily doubles as dessert. I actually used the pecan praline sauce in place of maple syrup for my waffles and pancakes. It was that delicious. \\n\\nThis was one of the best breakfast buffets I've been to (ever) and I think the price is also quite reasonable for being located inside a Disney resort. Not to mention, Animal Kingdom Lodge is also beautiful. You will walk out very happy and stuffed.

So busy, in fact, that they can't even be bothered to create actual names for their food.  Instead, they just assign a letter and a number to each dish.  You want an appetizer?  Try A4.  Noodles?  N6.  Curry?  C2.  No wait - make that C3.  Don't like what you ordered?  Try a different number next time, asshole.  The Thais don't have time for your bullshit.\\n\\nHowever, just in case you don't feel like rolling the dice on a meal or making 12 trips to Thai Passion before you're lucky enough to come across it, I'll let you in on a little secret.  The only letter and number combination you'll ever need to know is this:  N2.  Say it with me.  N.  2.  If you think you might have trouble remembering it, here's the trick - flat rice noodles (N).  Basil (0.5).  Tomatoes (0.5).  Onions (0.5).  Bell Peppers (0.5).  Simple mathematics.  Even a Thai can do it: N+0.5+0.5+0.5+0.5=delicious.  \\n\\nAnd the best part?  They're open until 3am EVERY NIGHT.  That means you can get the N-mother-fucking-2 pretty much whenever you want.  For example, I left W. 6th St. around closing time last Friday night.  On my way out of the bar, I hit the speed dial on my phone for Thai Passion (which is, you guessed it, N2) and placed my order.  It was ready by the time I walked the 3 blocks to get there.  \\n\\nThere's only one downside to the late-night eats.  Past 1am, you will typically be walking into the restaurant drunk, and they always seem to have a bunch of really cute Thai girls working around that time.  You might want to roll the dice, but if I've learned anything from my buddy who visits Thailand on a regular basis, it's this:  cute Thai girls are often really Thai boys.  \\n\\nY'all ain't foolin' me."},{"name":"Bakersfield","address":"733 N High St","city":"Columbus","stars":"4","text":"I have tried stopping at Bakersfield when it's not so busy. It always seems to be busy though even in the middle of the afternoon. That is, the servers seem to act like it's busy since the wait is so long. As for the food it's good but overpriced. The hipster douche in you will like this. \\n\\nIt seems everyone knows that urban hipster with Johnny Cash in their iPods and who drinks PBR or low quality beer ironically. You'll probably find them here. All the time it's filled with people who want everyone to know they're not trying to be cool. The inside is tables made from barrels which look really cool but these are hard to sit at. The bathrooms are impossible to get into when it's busy. It seems a bit overpriced for the amount of food. The chips are good but salty. It's not right having them without the guacamole. It's chunky but it's really spicy with peppers. The tacos were really small, though tasty. A taco is about the size of those little tortillas you get with fajitas. These would be okay if they weren't fucking $3 to $5. It has two vegetarian choices. The hongos is portobello, and has some kind of kale slaw. The huitacoche is corn fritters, actually corn mold, and poblano. It seems to be more of a bar than a restaurant. The best is the drafts of PBR for $2. Also on draft are Breckenridge and Modelo Especial. Some unique beers include Hell or High Watermelon and Lone Star. Cocktails are about $9 to $10. They underpour them so you should skip those. Margaritas are $5 and these are a lot better. The best ones are the Bakersfield and the spicy. Both are made with El Jimador Blanco. The spicy is made with jalapeno. As for the tequila and whiskey it's pretty good. There's over 30 kinds of whiskey here. \\n\\nI would recommend going to Bakersfield earlier when it's not so busy.

It normally comes with your choice of either a sweet citrus scone or a savory cheddar scone but you can get both for an extra $2 (which we wound up doing).\\n\\nThe inside of this shop is cute and bright and has (as expected) references to Peter Pan and Neverland throughout the store.\\n\\nThey don't provide you with large tea pots at your table - the tea is instead brewed at their counter and they provide you with small metal tea pots. On the plus side, this lets you try out a bunch of different types of tea. On our first order, we tried the Dragonwell (a wok-pressed green tea) as well as the White Cherry (a blend of five green and white teas with coconut and dried cherries). I found the White Cherry to have a very appealing fragrance.\\n\\nThe scones were accompanied with Devonshire cream and house-made strawberry jam.\\n\\nI really enjoyed the crust on top of the citrus scone.\\n\\nThe sweet items included the following: a lollypop made of dark chocolate, quinoa, sour cherry, pistachio, and rose; a cheesecake with rhubarb and custard on a brown butter oatmeal base; a triple chocolate mousse cake with raspberry and hazelnut; and a key lime tart with strawberry-basil salad and graham-whipped cream. My favourite was the mousse cake.\\n\\nThe savory items included the following: pumpernickel bread topped with peas, ricotta, mint pesto, and pine nuts (pretty good if you like peas); roti filled with paneer, cashew korma, and tamarind chutney (the cheese has a chewy/squeaky texture to it which is typical of paneer); a house-made bao with pulled chicken, mango slaw, and ramen (I didn't taste the ramen); speck and fior de latte with a balsamic-onion relish on foccacia (speck is a cured, fatty pork slice and fior de latte is a semi-soft cheese like mozzarella - I really enjoyed the relish on this); and a creamy citrus crab salad with avocado in a light and crispy sesame cone.\\n\\nFor our second round of tea selections, we picked the Tiger Lily Jasmine (a blend of Fujianese tea with layers of jasmine flowers), and their best-selling Take Me To Neverland (a signature blend of chocolate and peppermint). I'm not usually a fan of peppermint tea but this was nice because the peppermint was not too strong.\\n\\nSince this was Easter, our meal was completed with a Mocha Chick Macaron.\\n\\nIf they had High Tea like this in Neverland, I'd never want to grow up either."},{"name":"Donut Queen","address":"5842 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"This was the absolute worst donut I've ever had the displeasure of putting even in my hand.

The ordering process was disorganized to the point of absurdity--it took a cast member more than 10 minutes to enter our order into a kiosk after we stood in line after arriving for our \\"reservation.\\"  We experiences two of the dining rooms--the cacaphonous cafeteria like grand ballroom space and the darker, more lair-like space of the west wing.

But alas, such is life. Relationships end; we move on; we try the new restaurant that takes over the space vacated by its failed predecessor. I think that Slate may at least be managed by the same people as 219 West, perhaps even owned by the same people. I'm basing this solely on the fact that their WiFi is still named 219 West. \\n\\nAnyhoo, brunch was fine. They have $1 mimosas, which is my jam. We actually started with a $12 carafe, but I don't think it was a good deal. We probably got 6 mimosas from the carafe. I suppose there is an argument for paying for convenience, but I'm ballin' on a budget, so I'll order them individually if I go back. The service was pretty slow, but our server was really nice. I had a side of mac and cheese with crisp pork belly. The mac and cheese was super creamy, which was awesome. Sometimes mac and cheese is dry or not very cheesy at restaurants. Not the case here. The pork belly was a great compliment to the pasta. No complaints at all about the food. I ordered the side, but received the entree. Our server said that's a pretty common mistake made by the kitchen, but assured me I was paying for the side. Jiggs got the House Potato Hash, which looked incredible, and David got the Stuffed French Toast, which changes every week. When he had it it was pumpkin, and while he does not like pumpkin flavored things usually, he really enjoyed this dish.\\n\\nI love that they have a patio, but I think they'd be better off getting rid of their couches and having more actual tables. The outdoor tables are also really made for 2 people, so it was a tight fit for the three of us.

By no means is the food authentic, but it has decent flavor. Go for the chili ramen.\\n\\nDining in the restaurant is kind-of a bad experience. Service takes a very long time and servers are inattentive. It's hard to flag down your server too; seems as though they are purposely avoiding their customers.

It has a homey bar feel inside with all the wood, but it was very peaceful at lunch time.  So much so I was not sure if they were open at first.  Our waitress was kind and helped us very well.  Tried the crab cakes to start and when they came out I paused for a second because the top looked burnt.  Tried it and it was not so that was good to know, but it was not a great crab cake.  It was just ok, the sauce with it reminded me of Mc Donalds' big mac sauce, maybe a little more mustard flavor to it.  There was slaw with it, but it didn't balance out the flavors.\\n\\n  For entree I had the bacon-wrapped meatloaf which has mashed potatoes, the veggie of the day (it was green beans), and onion strings on it.  Green beans were great, so were the mashed potatoes.  The onion strings were alright, really didn't eat too many.  The bacon-wrapped meatloaf was just okay to me.  It comes with a sauce on it that I did not think really brought any new dimension to the dish.  I tried with the mashed potatoes and onion strings and the meatloaf overpowered the other flavors.  For dessert had the peach cobbler.  I have southern roots and have grown up on peach cobbler so when it came out I recognized this was a tad different.  It was warm with vanilla ice cream on top.  There was a crumbly crust with it which brought more flavor to the table but not much.

It's timeless!  The decor has not changed at all in 35 years.  The same yellow hand-lettered specials board.  Same glass over checkered tablecloths.  BBQ Duck and pork hanging in the window like a proper Cantonese noodle house should.  The sign that said \\"Please put umbella in bucket\\" is gone, but it was there for years.  On Lok is so unfashionable that it's hip, although on my recent visits, there was not a man-bun to be seen.  The menu hasn't changed, although the prices are slightly higher than they were in the 80s!  They also take debit cards now, which is quite the handy improvement over the past \\"cash only\\" policy.  \\n\\nI want to give this place 5 stars purely for the nostalgic twang that I experience when I walk through the door, but this is functional food, not fine dining.  3.5 is probably more accurate.   Bishops, it ain't...\\n\\nMy goto bowl is BBQ duck with Sui Kau noodle in soup.  Sometimes you hit the duck lottery and get all breast meat, and sometimes you get some bonier bits.  It's all good though.   Crispy skinned livery buck breast and the tasty tissue along the ribs where the 5 spice marinade is concentrated.  Just enough duck fat to get your cardiologist wagging his finger at you.   Don't forget to spit the freshly stripped bones on the table like the old ladies from Hong Kong...   And the Sui Kau are great!  Very much like wontons, only better.  Big, plump pillows full of pork, shrimp, bamboo shoots, and black fungus.  Perfect when dipped in your custom condiment mixture of soy, chili oil, and black vinegar. \\n\\nThis is a Hong Kong style Cantonese noodle house, with no pretension whatsoever.  It's very much in the style of the now-closed but much loved Hons on Keefer street in Chinatown.  Last visit I was unable to convince the waitress to give me Shanghai wide noodle in my soup, but hey, pick your battles.  The bottom line is that On Lok still satisfies, even after 35 years.

Since this was a new dish for me, I cant compare to the authenticity but I will say it thought it was excellent and would order again.\\n\\nFor the entree we chose the Large Pepperoni Pizza. Almost immediately after ordering I questioned the decision to go with the large versus the individual size. Shortly after that when a server passed by with a massive pizza. I knew i had made a mistake. Even worse another member of out party of 6 had ordered one as well hoping to share with the rest of us. 1 would have been plenty. When the 5 non-vegetarians were done, there was still almost a full pizza left.

To me the toppings were uneven. \\n\\nMy main issue with the service was that one entree was brought shortly after Salads and Appetizer and was essentially finished before the other entrees arrived.

A pretty smart idea, if you ask me!\\n\\nSo after waiting maybe ten minutes, we got our seats. The waitress was friendly enough, but the service wasn't anything special. After some deliberation, we settled on the Spinach Gomae, GAMI Sashimi Salad, Salmon & Avo Roll, and Spicy Salmon Roll.\\n\\n\\nSpinach Gomae: When the spinach gomae arrived at the table, I was a bit surprised by the size, but I guess for $3.45, you do get what you pay for. The sauce on the gomae was great and flavorful; however, there was a bit too much sauce on the spinach for me. Other than that, it was a solid appetizer.\\n\\nGAMI Sashimi Salad: The sashimi was fresh and tasted delicious! The sauce was average, nothing too special. For $8.95, it was a pretty good sashimi salad.\\n\\nSalmon & Avo Roll: To be honest, the roll was a bit small. The individual sushi was oddly cut so that each piece was a different size. The salmon and avocado were really fresh, however. For $3.95, I definitely got what I paid for, as the roll was on the smaller side for sure.\\n\\nSpicy Salmon Roll: The spicy salmon roll was great! It was a tad too spicy for me, but the taste overall was delicious.

We had their prix fixe menu and had their special of the day, which was grilled salmon that was draped with a cream based sauce made from crab. It was quite delicious, I split it with my boyfriend and we were both pretty full. We also ordered their appetizers. We had something that was similar to bruschetta. We had their salad with a light vingarette dressing on it.

For entrees we had a black lodge steak and peppers sandwich, sausage plate with housemade bratwurst ($14) and a hatch Chile queso burger special ($5). We didn't like the steak sandwich as much - there was a lot more fat and chewy bits in it compared to the asada fries. However, the bratwurst and the sauerkraut were really good. \\n\\nFor drinks we tried: the lagerbier Hell, which was a light lager; a dark lager which looked like a porter and had coffee flavors but was light and not at all bitter; and a British bitter.

You're purely paying for the chance to dine inside one of the 3 rooms available in the castle: The West Wing, where the beautiful \\"Rose\\" is. This room is also the darkest out of the three. And I mean so dark that you probably wont be able to see what you're eating. There's also the Library where you'll see Belle and the Beast dancing.

Sadly, even though all 3 rooms are equally beautiful, it is no where worth the money you're paying. \\n\\nWe were there for breakfast so we ordered the Feast A La Gaston (Scrambled Eggs, Herb-Roasted Potatoes, Apple Smoked Bacon, and Chicken Sausage) and the Open-Faced Bacon and Egg Sandwich (Poached Eggs, Applewood Bacon, Brie Cheese, and Arugula on a toasted Baguette). Everything is served with a selection of pastries and fresh fruit. There's something you need to understand here. You seat yourself and they deliver the food to you. I was so disappointed when our food arrived because it was served cold. For $25 a plate, I expect my food to be served hot. My open faced sandwich was a pretty decent size though and my eggs were THANKFULLY poached properly. The Feast A La Gaston was just your usual breakfast fare. I think you can honestly get the same thing at ANY breakfast spot (actually you can probably cook this at home). I think the only good thing about our breakfast was the assortment of pastries that came with our entrees.

I hadn't walked by the area, so was pretty impressed with the build out.  There's some steps to go up (as well as a long wheelchair ramp).  The steps and a privacy wall basically make the large deck feel closer to a rooftop deck than the simple elevation it is.

Definitely a good vibe.\\n\\nI sat at the bar, and ordered the fried oysters as well as the cod fish and chips.  Food was good.  The right amount of deep fry, the food almost seeming light, with no heavy oil taste/texture.  The bartender did ask me what I thought of the jalapeno tartar, and while it was okay, it felt more gimmicky than tasty.  I had been hoping for a little bit of heat but only got a hint of jalapeno flavor.  That being said, the oysters and fish were both good plain (though I did add some tobasco to the oysters and some malt vinegar to the fish after tasting).  The food is more comforting than amazing, but was exactly what I was looking for on this rainy evening.\\n\\nDrink wise, I had the Definitely Not IPA on the bartender's recommendation after mentioned I was looking for something hoppy.

The sausage had no taste, and had been sitting out past its plating time.this was the only dish without marinara sauce on it. \\n\\nThe calamari by itself had no taste; more specific, the batter had no seasoning. The mayo(?)-based dipping sauce was good, but I like to taste a variety of flavors, and these dishes weren't measuring up. \\n\\nTo use up my gift certificate, I tried the Tiramisu dessert. This was a very odd rendition of the classic. It's two scoops of the dessert made to look like they were gotten from a tub of ice cream? Just look at the picture. Theres was no creamy mascarpone cheese mixture, instead an icyish gelatoish concoction on top of the cake. Bottom line, was it worth $8?

If you've been there, of course you're going to make comparisons. But you've got to take into account the price difference when doing so. Of course the salad bar isn't going to be as extensive, and I expect the meat to be of slightly lesser quality than Fogo. I think that both establishments are worth the price they are charging. \\n\\nThat being said, this review won't be a comparison between the two. I've been here twice, once with a coupon (can't remember whether it was Groupon or Scoutmob) and once without. I found everything to be pretty consistent between the two visits.\\n\\nAt dinner, $35 gets you all you can eat meat, salad bar, and carb sides. I've never perused the carb section of the restaurant (they have fried plantains, rice, and beans), but have enjoyed the garlic bread and cheese bread they pass around. The salad bar is okay and if you want to eat just off that, it's $10. It contains your basic lettuce with choice of toppings and dressings, as well as pasta salads, pico de gallo, tabbouleh, tuna salad, and cole slaw. \\n\\nNow to the meats. Meat meat meat. Grrrr meat. \\n\\nI'm not going to lie here, I strongly believe that medium is about as cooked as you should go here. I had a well done piece of filet by accident and it was not good. Personally, I go medium rare and have not been disappointed. The rump steak, top sirloin, ribeye, and NY strip were all very good. I was so busy scarfing all of that down that I didn't get a chance to ask for medium rare filet. But oh well. The other issue is that a lot of the pieces have at least some fat on them that you have to cut away. \\n\\nHere's the nice thing about this place. Once they've brought around most of the offerings, they'll ask you if there's anything specific that you want. My SO's father wanted NY strip well done (tragic, I know) and they made it happen. The first time it came out, there was still a bit of pink, so they took it back right away and burnt it to his satisfaction. \\n\\nSpeaking of the service. Overall, I am happy with it. We waited a bit before the meat started coming and we had to ask for the check (even though it was quite clear we were finished), but those aren't big issues. As mentioned earlier, they do accommodate you. And while you're eating, they're very attentive. And I keep saying \\"they\\" because it seems they've got a team effort thing going here. \\n\\nSo yes.

For appetizers we had the Havana egg rolls and the Patatas Bravas(potato chunks covered in this delicious cheese sauce) both very good. Next we had the Nshima Patties and the Mar I Muntanya Al Xocolata (land and sea or in other words chicken and prawn). Very good but I wish the chicken had been served with something to accompany all the sauce that was around the dish. Lastly, for dessert the Y√πtou Box and Housemade Coconut  Pistachio  Cardamom  Sorbet. The desserts were my favorite.

This restaurant also has a bar to match.\\n\\nMy girlfriend and I love tapas and arrived at the tail-end of a Friday happy hour. We were excited to try this place at the recommendation of a friend. We started off with an Aviator cocktail and sangria at the bar. Not only was the bartender outstanding, but so were the drinks. They were so expertly crafted... I've never had better drinks anywhere. And I dine and drink at a lot of restaurants. We had so much fun talking with the bartender and watching him craft drinks that we decided to eat dinner there as well, rather than at a table or out on the covered balcony.\\n\\nTo start off, we order the olive, cheese, and Marcona almonds plate. Delicious and just what we needed to match the drinks we just downed. I ordered the crab-stuffed piquillo pepper, which was very nice. The slight sweetness of the pepper nicely complemented the briny, yet sweet, goodness of the crab. We also order the eggplant and Manchego flatbread. I have to admit that I am a sucker for anything with eggplant, and this appetizer did not fail us. It was very distinctive and richly flavored because it came with a fried egg. The egg and flatbread was very much needed, as it helped us soak up some liquor!\\n\\nConsidering all the appetizers we ate, I am surprised we made it to our entrees! My girlfriend is vegetarian and she ordered the Moroccan spiced vegetable cazuela while I ordered the Harissa roasted chicken. Her dish was unforgettable. It was so delicately cooked that the veggies still retained their flavor and texture. The sauce was liquid heaven and seasoned just right. Outstanding. My roasted chicken was perfectly cooked. Not dry but not undercooked either. The saffron added such a wonderful depth of flavor to the chicken that went great with the earthiness of the arugula and olives.\\n\\nNeedless to say, we were STUFFED. However, we the food that we were treated to was so fantastic we felt it would be an injustice for us to leave without dessert. We opted for the pear galette. The honey creme fraiche that accompanied the warm, just baked pear was indescribably complex and satisfying. This is a must-have, indulgent dessert when you visit.\\n\\nAll in all, we had such a wonderful experience that we just did not want to leave. The bartender was so welcoming and the food was so stellar, I wish I could visit from San Antonio every week.\\n\\nThis is the perfect place for a romantic dinner any night of the week.

The restaurant was not very far and since it was an asian buffet, I knew we would be served fast. The service was good. \\n\\nI had wondered whether the food tasted better just because we were tired and hungry but my family decided to go a second time and they enjoyed it just as much.

Then when I came on another trip, but friend mentioned that Lunch is quick service and you just wait in line. So we walked up to the castle and only waited in line for about 5 minutes.\\n\\nYou first wait in the library and order your food at these touch screen computers, pay right there, and then you have these gps roses that you take to your table. When you choose to sit, the staff will find you and bring your items to you. I got the Braised Pork.  It was cooked perfectly and with amazing juicy flavors. For the price of around $13 it was definitely a good deal. \\n\\nThe inside seating areas are so beautiful. There are three rooms where you can sit. The West wing is a dark room that looks like the Beast has destroyed it. Slashes on the curtains and even the painting of him. Every once and a while, a loud thunder will happen too. The center piece in here would have to be the Enchanted Rose. The East Wing, or better known as the Rose Gallery, is probably the least popular of the three. It has nice seats and pictures of all the characters on the walls. A statue of Belle and the Beast dances in the middle of the room. Last, and my personal favorite room would have to be the Grand Ballroom. It is a 2 story room with high ceilings and with the beautiful angel babies painted on the ceiling. Chandeliers light up the room and it really does bring you back to when they danced in the movie. I sat down, took a second to breathe, and really was amazed at the ambiance of this place.

There's couldn't have been more than a dozen tables so I'd imagine this place gets packed quick.\\n\\nI got the meatball pho ($6.50).  The broth was fine and the noodles were good.

I had to spit them out and ended up a pretty large pile of pieces of fat.  I was even more dismayed by the fat pieces I couldn't spit out.  This was the only time I'd ever seen so much fat on meat.  It was pretty nasty in fact and if I didn't hate wasting food so much I definitely wouldn't eaten them (I seriously don't waste food, even single grains of rice).

My bedroom could have been a Belle fan club meeting place. I had Belle sheets with matching pillow cases, posters, pajamas, snow globes, you name it. So it was no surprise that when we decided to go to Disneyworld, getting reservations at Be Our Guest was number one on my to do list. Seriously, I did so long before we even had our hotel stay booked. \\n\\nDisneyworld allows you to make reservations 180 days in advance, and I cannot stress enough the importance of doing so. Even if you are coming for breakfast or their quick service lunch instead of dinner, reserve yourself a spot so that you don't miss out! A card is required to secure your place, so be sure to check their cancellation policies to avoid any last minute fees.\\n\\nOnce inside the castle, you will be ushered into a hallway where the talking knights are located. They are hilarious and a good distraction for hungry kids who tend to get fussy while they wait. As soon as your table is ready, the master will invite your family to dinner and Lumiere will show you to your seats. This is a great photo opportunity, so have those cameras ready. \\n\\nOur table was located right near the window where you can watch the snowfall \\"outside\\". Between that and the gorgeous ballroom ceiling above us, I actually found myself getting emotional a few times by how realistic it was. You truly feel as if you stepped out of reality and directly into the fantasy world of the movie. \\n\\nOur server was wonderful and stayed in character the whole time which was fun. He brought freshly baked bread (by Mrs. Potts of course) to us promptly, with a plate of softened salted butter alongside. My husband ordered a beer while I got a glass of the Enchanted Rose. It was crisp with lots of fruity notes. \\n\\nKnowing I would be over indulging in desserts, I decided to get the garden salad and bowl of French onion soup for dinner. The salad was excellent and I loved how light the champagne vinaigrette was. The soup was gloriously cheesy, and the rich broth had a mild roasted onion flavor. My husband had the roasted chicken breast with an heirloom tomato and arugula salad that he said was also very good. \\n\\nFor dessert of course we had to get the grey stuff, and indeed it is delicious! It tastes like a cookies and cream mousse, it isn't heavy like a frosting. Not knowing they were going to give us a complimentary one, we ordered the tart as well which was heavenly with tiny edible chocolate pearls on top. Sadly the strawberry cheesecake wasn't as good, so stick with the grey stuff and you will be golden. \\n\\nAfter our meal we had the chance to walk around and explore the other rooms which I thoroughly enjoyed. The Beast is there at dinner as well so you can have your picture taken with him. The food and the atmosphere together made it one of the most memorable meals of my life.

Though, he warned me that I would either really like it or really hate it.\\n\\nI liked it.\\n\\nFirst off, the place is pretty narrow and easy to miss among on all the businesses on Fraser.  Look for the green Totoro on the signage (seriously - Miyazaki, please don't sue this joint).  The joint is small but looks recently renovating and they have booth seats.  They also played HK movies when I was here.\\n\\nI was finishing a cigarette outside and joined my tablemate who was already seated.  I was asked, \\"You're getting the baked pork chop on rice, aren't you?\\"  I grin and shoot back, \\"Do I have any other option?\\"  I'm a man of patterns and that's how serious I am about BPCOR... HRDCOR!\\n\\nI ordered my standard (pending ISO 9001 certification) baked chop on rice and cold HK Milk Tea/Coffee (a.k.a. 'Yuanyang' or 'Lovebird') -- for $8.50.  No extra charge for ice - we're off to a good start.  My yuanyang was good and strong - not oversweetened and stronger presence of coffee which I liked.\\n\\nService was pretty slow but friendly - the waitress apologized for the speed since she was working along and tending to 4 or 5 tables.  My friend's brisket/enoki pot came pretty quickly (came out boiling and was pretty good), then a wait for our included drinks and quite a wait for my BPCOR (standard given the baking).\\n\\nFirst off, the BPCOR is huge and comes in a deep ceramic bowl - the waitress warned me that it's *very hot* and added that she wasn't kidding.  When servers tell me that, I usually do the Seinfeld thing and touch the dish anyways.  I can't decide if \\"I-just-wanted-to-see-what-your-idea-of-'hot'-was\\" or I take it as a dare -- but I believed her and let the bowl rest for a bit.\\n\\nWhen I dug in, I was impressed liberal use of ingredients: lots of tomato sauce and baked cheese.  As I dig deeper, I found tomato chunks... corn... peas... and OMG... CARROTS?!?!  Many HK cafes will have 2 or 3 of these 'standard' additions - but not all 4.  Impressive.  Some joints add mushroom and/or onions - I much prefer peas and carrots on my BPCOR.\\n\\nThe pork chop is thinly sliced, but a good batter that retained a decent crunch despite being being covered in sauce and baked.  Props.\\n\\nThe bed of fried rice below had a lot of egg - but I didn't get that slight chew/char from well-done fried rice.  It actually seemed a little mushy to me - almost like fresh rice rather than overnight rice was used.  But I'm going to assume the chef doesn't deserve to be dragged out to the street and shot for frying with fresh rice - so it might be a disadvantage of deep bowl.\\n\\nThe other disadvantage is that with the deep bowl, you have to be more careful with your sauce/porkchop distribution - there's a lot of rice and if you're not careful, you'll be eating plain egg-fried rice by when you reach the bottom.  And yes, again like Seinfeld with his thoughts on fudge distribution in sundaes.\\n\\nTo be honest, with the shape of the bowl - I think it might be excellent idea to heat the rice bowl from the bottom claypot/stonebowl rice style.  Adding that charred/hardened rice at the bottom to a BPCOR would take the entire dish to another level and result in a never-ending wave of ecstasy for me.  But then again, having to fry the rice, deep-fry the chop, claypot the rice and bake the entire thing would be a monstrous investment of time -- especially for an HK cafe where value and speed is king.  If I was Heston Blumenthal and was on a obsessive search for perfection, this would be a worthy area of research though.\\n\\nOverall, I liked the unusual BPCOR they serve up at Dragon Lord - just wished the rice had more of a chew.  But right now, it's BT Cafe (http://www.yelp.ca/biz/bt-cafe-vancouver) vs. Dragon Lord for my favourite BPCOR in Vancouver.  More sampling and research is required though.  Contact me directly if you wish to fund my research for the perfect BPCOR/cold yuanyang.  Donations over $100 will be issued a tax receipt.\\n\\nCash only (for research donations and for Dragon Lord)."},{"name":"Bon's Off Broadway","address":"2451 Nanaimo St","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"In the words of Triumph, the Insult Comic Dog: \\"I took a poop on...

The veggie was probably the best I have ever had. It is made with mushrooms, quinoa and ground chick peas. it came with a giant pickle and lots of sauce options on the table. I love spicy so I topped mine with a jalapeno sauce. Daniel ordered the crunch burger which I did not try but he said it was delicious. He also had a cookies and cream milkshake but I stuck with what I love- red wine. My wine was a red blend and a generous pour for $9.

Think salt and pepper shrimp from dimsum. The noodle soup was alright. They made it spicy for me but all they did was dump chili oil on top. The noodles were thick and rounded, soft.

I mean lets face it they have been around forever and have quite a bit of creds and I figure I owe them more than a few chances.

I happened to be searching google for recipes and through some freak accident Java Noodles popped up. I saw a pic of their Beef Rendang and just knew I had to try it. I cancelled my plans to cook and decided to call Java Noodles. I got the Rendang Daging Padang and the Shrimp Rolls. \\n\\nNow the previous times I ordered (well over five) they always took more than an hour to deliver to my work place which really isn't to far away from their restaurant. This time they got here in 30 minutes. The food was fresh hot and packaged so that it could easily be carried. I was so impressed by how this food was packaged, everything was tied and secured the Rendang was in a plastic Tupperware and none of the sauces had spilled.  The driver was also insanely friendly and seemed to know exactly what door to meet at. He even called ahead to let me know he was almost their so I would have time to make my way through my cubicle bee hive to the door. \\n\\nWhen I ordered the Shrimp Rolls I didn't really know what to expect. I assumed it may be something similar to an egg roll but decided to chance it as I need to fill out my order so I would meet the minimum purchase for delivery. What I got was some sort of amazing shrimp fritter like thing. The sauce it came with tasted like sweet sweet heaven and I couldn't have been happier to be eating them. \\n\\nThe Beef Rendang was so dang good! It was sort of like a sweet and savory pot roast infused with coconut flavor! Sprinkling toasted coconut on top of the dish was super nice touch and every bite really was filled with savory coconut overload. I was also amazed at the size of the portion you get.. Its like almost half a beef roast and could easily be a meal for two to three people. \\n\\nI've said Java Noodles was boring before.. but apparently I was wrong.

I chose Carolina beef stew which comes with white or yellow rice (I opted for yellow), two sides (I chose macaroni and cheese and mashed potatoes), and a corn muffin. My boyfriend got the meatloaf with mashed potatoes, macaroni and cheese, and baked beans. I enjoyed all of my food. The beef stew had large, tender chunks of beef. It only had one carrot which was a little odd, but I appreciated that they didn't skimp on the beef as some places do. It was served over yellow rice that was perfectly cooked and had a nice flavor. The macaroni and cheese was creamy and had a hint of a mustard flavor that went very well with it. The mashed potatoes were smooth and topped with a flavorful gravy and the corn muffin was yummy as well. My boyfriend loved his food as well. \\n\\nI think we definitely have a new favorite for the days I want to throw calorie counting to the wind and just enjoy some well prepared, delicious comfort food.

Also, either put some butter on the table or come up with a house dipping oil.\\n- My biggest peeve was probably not putting enough pasta on the plates. Both my dish and the wife's could have had another handful of pasta (which probably costs less than 50c !). I thought maybe it was just us but when I looked at the table next to me they had a side order of pasta that was so small it was embarrassing.

First off, it was sooooo slow and it was not busy. We came in for brunch and there were plenty of empty tables. We ordered spinach, bacon and egg pizza, French toast and the carbonara. The spinach, bacon and egg pizza was okay, nothing outstanding - the bacon was overly salty. I like the breakfast pizza at Russell house more. The French toast was weird for me... it had a weird savory undertone to it like peppercorns? I understand that it came with bacon but that wasn't the savory undertone I tasted. The carbonara was terrible. The pasta wasn't just al dente... it was practically hard where it felt like it wasn't cooked at all. I recommend the carbonara at coppa instead. I think I was just disappointed that the food took so long to come out and so long in between items.

The bus from my conference to the airport got me there with plenty of time to spare.  I was looking up dinner options at ATL and ultimately decided on BBP.\\n\\nWhen I got there, there was a long line of people and the system for ordering/paying/getting a table seemed confusing.  I spotted an open seat at the bar and grabbed it.  I was promptly greeted by Woods.  He was one of the nicest, most personable bartenders I've ever met!  We chatted about my trip, crabs in Maryland, and more.  One of the most hospitable bartenders I've ever come across.  \\n\\nAt this location only, they make an ATL burger - a burger topped with pimento cheese and fried pickles.  I was eager to try it so I ordered it along with a side of sweet potato fries, as well as multiple cactus pear margaritas since I didn't really have anywhere to be.\\n\\nThe food came out pretty quickly; unfortunately, they brought out a green Chile burger instead, along with my sweet potato fries.  I brought this to Woods's attention, who immediately apologized and assured me my ATL burger would be out shortly.  He also topped off my margarita which was a very nice gesture.\\n\\nWhen my new food arrived, I first tried the sweet potato fries.  I've had these at other BBPs and they are some of the best sweet potato fries I've ever had.  The ones I got were lukewarm and kind of limp.  I'm 95% sure what they did was put my first order of sweet potato fries off to the side when the wrong burger came out, then gave me the same ones instead of fresh ones.  This is the sole reason I'm withholding the fifth star.\\n\\nThe burger, on the other hand, was amazing.  Cooked to a perfect medium well as requested.  The beef was seasoned perfectly, the pimento cheese was melted just the right amount and was delicious, and the fried pickles were nice and crispy.  Probably one of the top 3 burgers I've ever eaten in my life.  10 stars for the burger.  \\n\\nIf I'm ever flying through ATL again, I'll come back here even if I'm in a different terminal; it's just a short ride on the airport train and you don't have to go through security again.  Hopefully Woods will still be there with his hospitality and smile."},{"name":"Be Our Guest Restaurant","address":"Magic Kingdom Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"We were able to snag last minute reservations on our last day at Magic Kingdom and boy am I glad.

We did have some more concerns this time about the food than previously. However, the service is absolutely stellar and the wine list is impressive. Multiple people congratulated us on our wedding anniversary, as did the custom menu that congratulated us. In terms of the food, we loved the least expensive item on the menu, which was the coleslaw. This an absolute must try. You must also try the bread, which is some of the best I have had anywhere, obviously made fresh today. One can either get a four course meal or a six course meal. We opted for the four course. The wines, which are automatically matched to your food selections at additional cost, are all good. We did have some reservations about certain of the food courses. The salmon entr√©e was bland and just OK. The uovo egg with crispy chicken skin was disappointing, but after telling our server that we didn't love it, he took it off the bill. The duck breast was the best I have ever had, and my wife loved the ravioli. One dessert we had was coconut themed and the other was pineapple themed, and both were great. Overall, we thought perhaps Frasca has dropped down a notch from where it was, but they still do such a great job of welcoming you, treating you well, crafting the food, and making a big deal about your special occasion that it is still five-star when compared to other fine restaurants.

You can't say that about every Vietnamese place in Boston--some are uneven in food quality or service; some used to be great; some have always been awful.\\n\\nThe standard for quality of course is pho. It's very good here. I'm seeing reviews that say the soup was cold and the meat wasn't cooked but I don't believe it. When I get pho, the broth is at almost perfect temperature, sometimes a little hot, but never too cold. The ingredients are cooked the way they're supposed to be. But all of Xinh Xinh's soups are great, because their broth bases are damn near perfect.\\n\\nTheir fish ball soup--a lot of people new to Vietnamese food don't consider it, but if you've always wanted to try it, try it here first. Light, clear broth with fragrant seasonings, cilantro & onion and mild bite-size fish balls.\\n\\nTheir chicken soups vanquish all evil, especially the kind that makes you come down with a cold. Or if you're hung over, or have a so-so stomach.\\n\\nBeef satay noodle soup: It's got a kick like a horse. It's hot as Catholic penance. Your sinuses will be blissfully clear.\\n\\nI agree that the portion sizes have gotten a bit smaller over the past year and the prices are a little bit higher. Okay first, nobody needs to wear that pho on their asses for weeks afterward. I couldn't really finish all the noodles in my pho before. Second, if smaller portion and slightly higher price means I still get quality food, then I will pay it. They could add an \\"extra large\\" option for customers whose stomachs are apparently the size of a buffalo. \\n\\nBusinesses in Chinatown are paying ever higher rent, and the community is in danger of being priced out of existence.

I've eaten at every highly-rated Ethiopian restaurant in Portland and I seek it out in every city I visit. I have yet to find a place that does it better than Queen of Sheba. Many places in town seem so afraid of offending people with spice that their miser wat tastes like they poured a can of Progresso lentil soup onto the injera. QoS's food is spicy, but not just hot-spicy; the flavors are rich and savory and complex and comforting. I always leave in a better mood than when I arrived, even if I show up feeling tip-top.\\n\\nHere's a bonus for vegans: They use spiced oil, not butter, so all of the vegetarian dishes are actually vegan. Speaking of which, many places use so much oil/butter in their food that the injera beneath turns into a goopy mush.  At Queen of Sheba, it's perfect; the injera soaks up just enough flavor to make it delicious but not so much that you can't continue to use it to scoop up stews.\\n\\nI agree with other reviewers that their house cocktails are not terrific, but the waiter is happy to mix a drink to your specifications. But if you're drinking, just get yourself a pint or two of Mac and Jack's African Amber. They always have it on draft and it pairs perfectly with the food. I'm not just saying that because it has \\"African\\" in the name, I swear. I'm better than that.\\n\\nSeveral reviews complain about the service, but please understand that the woman who's waiting your table is also seating customers, mixing drinks, bussing dishes, working the register, and answering the phone.

I shudder to think how close I came to blacklisting the place for such a petty reason, because it is now my favorite restaurant in the city, hands-down.\\n\\nA few years ago, the owner told me that his family owned a farm in Ethiopia to which he would return twice a year to oversee the harvesting and mixing of the spices used in the restaurant's berbere, the spice mixture essential to Ethiopian cuisine that typically contains around fifteen ingredients. Are you kidding me? That demonstrates a dizzying degree of love and care, and it shows.

The restaurant definitely needs an update or just rip out the carpet and put in tile flooring. We were seated upon arrival, there was no one else in the restaurant the weekday we dinned.  Someone did come in as we were leaving. \\n\\nOur waitress was on the phone in the back and it took a bit of time for her to come to take our order because she was chatting on the phone for about 5 minutes. They bring free tea. I felt like it was very watery and could have been brewed longer. There were no tea bags in the tea holder, so it must have been made in the kitchen.  I ordered the lunch special - beef and broccoli, hot and sour soup and an egg roll. My friend ordered the sweet and sour pork on the regular menu. My meal came out before hers and I didn't want to start eating before her, but she insisted I start. I wished our meals had been brought out together. \\n\\nThe hot and sour soup was good. The beef with broccoli was just okay. The egg roll was just okay. I have absolutely had better. The portions were very large for a lunch menu, which was nice. \\n\\nThe serving of sweat and sour pork was huge. Again just okay tasting.

When he did, my friend ordered a margarita (we are both 24, graduate students at Georgia Tech and had consumed alcohol at the restaurant previously) and he returned her license saying that they had a new policy and wouldn't accept out of state licenses. (One might think this pretty absurd considering Atlanta is a city to which many people travel and thus, refusing to serve alcohol to all of those with out of state licenses would preclude them from earning a lot of revenue.) We decided to leave to drink and eat elsewhere but not before speaking to the manager. Our waiter made sure to follow us over to the manager by the way. We explained our grievance and the manager then said that they in fact had to scan out of state licenses before serving alcohol, something our waiter did not say, aka he lied to us about the policy, and instead refused to serve us. Had our incredibly rude waiter asked to scan our licenses we would have complied, considering our licenses are very much legal. The manager and the waiter showed no remorse and offered no apology the rudeness to which they had treated us with. \\n\\nAdditionally, I had been to the restaurant prior to this visit and received what I thought at the time was the worst service of my life (until the above event occurred).

The calabacitas ( zucchini , corn, and onions) I had added to my papas bowl ( eggs, potatoes, chile verde, cheese) was yummy.Zucchini was perfect.  Hot sauce was spicy hot. Yay. My dinining companion's huevos rancheros( beans, chile verde, eggs, potatoes) was savory. Great beans. Food was quick to come out and hot temperature wise. Perfect over easy eggs. \\n\\nWe realized after we got our food that we needed something to mop up the chile verde so we went back and ordered a side of tortillas (2/$1.50).

He was friendly and efficient but I couldnt help feeling it could somehow be organized better.  Order at the counter and pay. Coffee behind the register, help yourself. Water by the door, help yourself. Food was served without flatware or napkins. I asked another customer how to find the silverware...it was in yet another spot, between our table and register, and my dining companion found napkins behind the register. Also we  loved the music ( rockabilly maybe?) but thought it was a little loud. \\n\\nI felt like they need a flow person to organize their space.I wanted to help them.

It took another 10 minutes for the waitress to come over and take our order- we were starving. We put the food order in and waited another half hour with the waitress no where in site to give us an update on where our food was. It seemed like she was avoiding our table completely. We had to ask a bus boy for more water. She finally came over frantically apologizing for the wait- the kitchen was backed up she said and our food should be out in 5 minutes. Whatever that's fine but I wasn't too impressed. 20 minutes went by and no food or waitress in sight. When we got her attention finally she came over apologizing AGAIN and said our order wasn't even sent to the kitchen! How could that be and how did she pick up on this 45 minutes + later?! She said they were out of the dumplings that my friend ordered and asked if there was something else she wanted but did not provide a menu until my friend asked for one. How are we supposed to know whats on the menu? She said it would take 5 minutes and she would take the food off the bill because of how ridiculous this was. They were not \\"packed\\" by any means and there were several open tables around us so I was very confused as to what the issue was. It didn't take 5 minutes it took another 20 minutes until our food came out and by that point we asked for to go boxes and the check. When we got the check she didn't take any food off which she said she would. We didn't have the time or patience to argue with her about this, we just wanted to go home. We asked to pay separately since I ordered a cocktail; and what do you know she messed that up too- split it in half. I feel like our entire meal (minus the drink) should have been comp'd!

I just had water to drink. The meal took about 15 minutes to arrive.  It was presented on a large plate covered by a pointed witch/Sombrero-type hat thing as a lid made of natural fiber that was lifted off revealing a large pizza-pie sized roti/chapatti-looking disc about 18 inches in diameter that was a dark beige color with air holes laden throughout, kinda like a giant flapjack but not really. (Kinda sounds like I'm trying to describe a UFO sighting.) All the food items were placed on this rather alien-looking edible disc with the food items nicely spaced apart.  A couple bonus rolls of this disc material were atop as well. No utensils are given as this is a hand-eat as is Ethiopian food. The bread thing was like foam rubber in the haptic sense and was very spongy. I do emphasize that this bread thing is like nothing you've had. Not just some krummy ole' pita bread or some store bought thing. It was fun to pick up and play with and make mini-burrito-type bites and create mash-up flavor combo rolls. \\n\\nFlavors of the food items were assorted and curries were there as well as rosemary and many spice combos that were unique and flavorful with some items being spicy. I didn't really bother with analyzing what I was eating but I think there was lamb and chicken and beef and lentils and cabbage stuff and random things and an egg too. All was very good. The cost 19 bucks and I was very satisfied as it was a large volume amount of food especially when all of the bread thing was consumed. \\n\\nI must say this place was a great surprise and was very different from anything I had. It may be described as sorta Indian-like but milder curry-wise on the spices and more earthy in flavor and the bread thing was so fun to eat as its haptic appeal was mental.\\n\\nHighly recommended!

Be Our Guest is no exception! \\n\\nAs others have noted, there are NO reservations for lunch and dinner reservations are hard to come by.  We went for lunch and stood in the sweltering noon sun for 45 minutes.  There is NO SHADE in the line...It's so bad they actually hand out parasols in the line and put out ice-water and small disposable shot glasses so you can hydrate yourself.  They should have built the line inside the restaurant so you could look around and find out where you want to sit before you even place your order.  \\n\\nOnce you get in you are directed to one of the worst ordering systems I've come across...you place your orders on a touch screen, which has probably been touched by thousands of dirty hands...always nice right before you eat...I hardly found it convenient or intuitive, but we did manage to place our order in under 15 minutes...I'd think a server could do it quicker, but I guess this way there are no paper menus and they can change the offerings online on the fly...I'm not even sure if you can say \\"no tomato\\" or \\"extra cheese\\", when ordering.  It was frustrating to try to order for a party of 9 with kids in tow...You scroll thru the menu and add items to your order...when you are done you take a magic \\"rose\\" or use your Disney \\"bands\\" (which are still being beta-tested at Disney.)  Both of these have GPS so they bring your food right to you wherever you decide to sit.  That was neat, but didn't make up for the long wait or the boring food.  \\n\\nI had a 13 dollar roast beef sandwich which was very chewy.  That's the best I can say for it.  A couple slices of lunch meat on a roll with some kind of mayo spread...not impressed after that long wait in the sun...The desserts looked good, but I didn't have any...you also have to order them when you place your order at the start of your \\"ride\\".  I'd never wait in that line again.  If you have young kids or are enamored with Beauty and the Beast, I'm sure you won't even notice what you are chewing on as you look at all the lovely decor.  \\n\\nAs others have noted you order a drink but its on the \\"honor\\" system if you get a fountain beverage.

My husband and I love Disney World and we consider ourselves to be big Disney fans. The Be Our Guest restaurant is a Beauty the Beast themed restaurant that serves French inspired food in the Fantasyland part of Magic Kingdom. Belle being my favorite Disney princess is the reason we just had to come here. They mostly only take reservations but we just happened to find a seat that day without a reservation. This happens rarely so it's advisable to always have a reservation. Once you enter, you will be brought to an area where you can order your food electronically, then find a seat in one of the three themed rooms and a server will bring out your food to your table. The Beast's castle is fantastically \\"imagineered\\". As I mentioned, there are three sections where you can sit in the restaurant, the central Grand Ball Room which is beautiful beyond words, the West Wing which is inspired by the Beast, and The Castle Gallery which is inspired by Belle's library which has a larger than life rotating statue of Belle and the Beast waltzing. The castle itself is such visual masterpiece that you can't help but be swept up into the story of Beauty and the Beast. From the red napkins that are folded into a rose shape, to certain menu items like \\"the Gray Stuff cupcake\\" (which was delicious!), as soon as you step into this magnificently opulent castle, you feel like you are a part of this classic story. Even my husband who doesn't really have an opinion about Disney princesses was in awe of the beauty and splendor of this castle. Please visit all three sections to see the magnificent details.\\nThe food (although pricey like all restaurants in Disney) was really very good too. \\nWe loved this restaurant and would recommend it to anyone visiting Magic Kingdom."},{"name":"East Side Pies","address":"13265 N Highway 183, Ste B","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I really wanted to absolutely love this place.

The margaritas arrived first, and we had to remind the waitress to bring drinks. The cheese and margaritas were good, and so we ordered another round.  This one I ordered on the rocks, and the waitress complained they were running out margarita glasses. When mine arrived it had at least an inch of rainbow colored bubbles on top of it (un-rinsed soap of course). Fortunately for my party, mine was the only one this happened to.\\n    I ordered a combination dinner including a taco and a tostada with a side of sour cream. The taco was good, but the tostada came with meat instead of beans as ordered.

She relented when I assured her I did not have one, but it was irritating experience.  \\n    The bill was just under fifty dollars for me and my friend I was paying for, which I found reasonable. In addition, my friend (who likes this place) had one of their promotional cards, which makes the 11th meal free.  Unbelievably, the waitress returned with the promotional card, informing us that the owner/manager (one person) believed we had used a hole punch ourselves in order to reach the 11th meal.  She warned us of talking to him, saying that he could not speak English well.  But we insisted, he was extremely rude, and shook his head while my friend was talking to him. He eventually gave us a new card with credit for 9 meals, because (as he conveyed in very broken English) he believed 2 of the hole punches to be fraudulent.  Utterly ridiculous.  I have no idea how he believed he could keep customers this way.  They must of really needed the money, and I now understood the waitress's attitude of blaming the customer first.\\n   Overall, the food was simply adequate, the drinks were good without soap, and the service was THE worst I've ever had (and hopefully ever will).

Unfortunately, Bob's Muffin Shop won't be it.   \\n\\nUpon arrival, I realized this place was probably a cash only joint and we were sadly sans cash.  They have a no-name ATM up front, but it was out of order.  I let one of the waitresses know, who said it was out of cash and asked the manager to fill it.  So instead of getting money first, we sat down at a booth in the tiny dining area.  The first thing I noticed was that the place was visibly unclean, dusty, and crumby everywhere.  Seeing this, I'm instantly less excited about eating here.  Still, I guess this isn't completely atypical for a greasy spoon diner, so I remain hopeful.  Our waitress got our coffees and waters and took our order quickly.  I ordered scrambled eggs with homemade corned beef hash, hash brown potatoes, and for just $0.50 extra got a chocolate chip muffin instead of toast.  (Its called Bob's Muffin Shop, I had to get the muffin!)  The muffin came up first - an appetizer of sorts - grilled on the range with butter.  A pretty good muffin, I mean, what's not to love about a warm chocolate chip muffin with butter?  Unfortunately, the food went downhill from there.  My hash was unreasonably greasy and onion-laden (yes, I know corned beef hash is greasy, but this was too much).  One bite of potatoes had an extremely acrid taste, and sure enough when I pushed one of my potatoes with my fork, underneath was a small puddle of what I can only assume was burned oil from the grill.  My husband's ham and cheese omelette was slimy and had some unidentified charred ingredients in it (not ham and cheese).  We could only stomach about half our meals before it was just too gross to continue.\\n\\nI wanted to leave post haste, but upon finishing my meal the ATM was still out of order, so I had to ask a second time for assistance.

It arrived fast, and was very fresh, served on an ice cold plate. It was very refreshing. We also ordered a pizza to split. The pizza we chose was \\"The Prosciutto and Cantaloupe Pizza\\", which is obviously not rum of the mill,  it is different and worth trying. It also arrived fast and contained a hearty portion of the meat and cantaloupe. It was fresh and fulfilling. The menu states it's for one, but it easily fed me and my friend, and we still had some leftover. It was $23.00, which is not a bad deal for Disney. The service was good, and all the servers were very attractive and staying true to \\"the EPCOT way\\", were actually from Italy! The experience was very good. I know that Disney restaurants can be very expensive, but I found this place to be very reasonable, although I did see pizzas that were over $40.00 and entree choices that were around $30.00. It just depends how much you want to spend and what kind of experience you want to have. The wine and drinks are a little pricey, sometimes $13.00 for a mediocre selection, but then again, it's Disney. I would suggest this restaurant to get out of the sun or rain and enjoy a truly good meal and experience."},{"name":"Crema Cafe","address":"27 Brattle St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"4","text":"Excellent spot to grab an iced coffee while on Harvard campus! Sweet and tasty treats to nom as well!"},{"name":"Be Our Guest Restaurant","address":"Magic Kingdom Dr","city":"Orlando","stars":"3.5","text":"I don't care what anyone says about Be Our Guest Restaurant, because I absolutely ADORE it! The food shouldn't be a deciding factor of whether you should go here--it's very affordable compared with the other quick service or table service restaurants at MK. Personally, I think the food here is delicious, yet I know most of the mixed reviews are due to poor food quality, apparently.  Just like how taking castle pics or riding Splash Mountain are must-dos for any vacationing family/couple/group of friends, coming to BoG is a must do as well, simply because seeing the restaurant is an immersive and magical experience in itself.\\n\\nBy writing this review, I'm probably jinxing myself from easily getting a reservation here in the future, but I don't care. It would be a sin, not to share this information for inquiring future WDW vacationers.\\n\\nWe first got in line at a small booth at the front of the restaurant to check-in. We had a 10:30am ADR, at the start of their lunchtime. From check-in until we left, the staff was consistently friendly and helpful. As we walked towards the restaurant, we appreciated the beautiful scenery by the walkway. The beast's castle was small, yet very pretty. We could see a waterfall by the castle that was perfect for photo-ops.  At the entrance of the restaurant were gargoyle statues that might've looked more menacing at night. \\n\\nThere was a short line to order food, but because we pre-ordered online, we were directed straight to the pre-order cashier to pay for our food. Although it was a bit difficult to understand her, the cashier was a very sweet middle-eastern woman.\\n\\nThen we walked into the grand ballroom. It was nothing short of breath-taking.  The Beauty and the Beast theme played softly in the background, and I was so overwhelmed. No way this place was built in 2012. They must've shot the 1991 film in here: live action background with animated characters. That has to be it. \\nThere weren't many people yet, as they were either finishing up breakfast or starting lunch like us.\\n\\nI headed straight to the West Wing which was starting to fill up, but we easily found seats. It was a very dark, small room with torn drapes hanging from the ceiling and the rose under the glass was hidden away in the corner, shedding off petals occasionally. At the center in the back of the room was the Beast's torn portrait. Every 10 minutes, lightening was heard and his portrait flashed dramatically. There was a romantic yet eerie, ominous vibe.\\n\\nWe got our food in these cute little brown food carts with plastic windows so we could see the food inside. It freaked me out at first that the workers told us to sit down, and they'll find us. We inferred that they were able to determine our room location via magic band. And the cart people just wander around the room until they find the correct number of people at a table that doesn't have food.\\n\\nHubby got the Coq Au Vin style braised pork and I got the potato leek soup. The pork was very soft and tender, like pulled pork, but with hearty beef broth flavor. Salty, but that was leveled out by the yummy starchy mashed potatoes and crisp, yet flavorful haricot verts. The potato leek soup tasted very leeky, yet still had a full starchy flavor from the potato. I regret not getting something with more protein, like a croque monsieur maybe, but those didn't look that great.\\n\\nBy the time we finished, people were flooding into the West Wing to dine there until it was very crowded. We walked across to the Rose Gallery which had it's own personality. Think if Disney made a Beauty & the Beast quick service with one theme, this is how I imagined it would look. Bright, open, plenty of seating and tons of grand portraits of Belle with her castle friends. It was like a dine-in art gallery with a statue of the beast & Belle dancing at the center. \\n\\nThe middle eastern woman who took my preorder earlier let me order a Master's Cupcake from her rather than wait in the ever-growing line to order food. Hubby and I ate our cupcake in the Rose Gallery, and it was delicious! The chocolate cake was fluffy, moist and light. The frosting was whipped cookies and cream. It was smooth and gray (and delicious! Don't believe me, ask the dishes). There were small oreo cookie pearls on top of the cupcake and a chocolate thing that said 'Be Our Guest' on it. A perfect way to end our meal. \\n\\nWe spent 15 more minutes, after dessert, to explore around the Grand Ballroom.  If you looked out the windows, you could see that it was dark out and actually snowing outside. The ceiling had paintings of babies with wings, like it was the Sistine Chapel and there were huge chandeliers everywhere. I knew I wouldn't come back here, for a while so I relished every moment. \\n\\nAs I said before, this is a must-do for MK. I'll definitely be coming back for my next WDW trip."},{"name":"La Cocina de Consuelo","address":"4516 Burnet Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Best tortillas soup ever!!!

The additional Japanese type grill was quite busy.  I want to reiterate that this place was clean.

However, I am so glad they got this catering because althought it was basic food, such as potato salad, sandwiches, salad, and cookies, it tasted AMAZING. I had a turkey sandwich and it was REAL carved turkey, not deli sliced turkey. The bread tasted like it was baked fresh, the cookies were light and fluffy/nutty, not heavy at all, which made it easy to eat more than one :) The salad was delicious. The set up looked very professional despite it only being sandwiches and salad. There was a variety of sandwich options: ham, turkey, veggie. The cookies really are delicious. The only feedback I have is that they should have left business cards/menus/ or something to indicate where this food came from. It was so good that we actually asked around to see if anyone knew who ordered and catered, but, I think if they left a menu it would have reached more people.

However, the only critiques I have are that the portions were fairly moderate as I only received 3 small wedges of plantains and the tacos were only half filled with ingredients.

You can do half and half two types of pizzas for that size, so great way to feed 4 for $50 (which for disney is good). The melon and prosciutto was unique but delicious, so great for a hot summer day.\\nI'd eat earlier to avoid the dinner rush, since it can get loud in the restaurant, and the back dining area is a bit quieter than the rest of the place.

Every single thing I tried was extremely tasty. We had an ADR and were able to be seated early which was nice. We had a very friendly waiter. I absolutely loved the decor inside. I had been following Via Napoli since it opened this year and was excited to give it a try. The cool wood burning fire stoves with the faces and being able to watch the chefs at work...love it! The restaurant is quite loud though which I'm not sure why they didn't work out the acoustics properly in the construction.\\n\\nFor my appetizer I had the calamari. This was some of the best calamari I have ever had and I think that's because it was not overly breaded. It wasn't sopping in grease and had just the right layer of deep frying on it. My friend got the fried risotto balls. O.M.G. These were so incredibly tasty, I can't even express it. I adore risotto and to have it inside of these crispy, fried balls cooked perfectly hit the spot perfectly. My main pasta entree came in a creamy white sauce and was extremely tasty! I couldn't finish it all and had to take half to go. I ate it for lunch the next day microwaved and it was still very good! My friend got the wood-fired pizza with prosciutto and melons on it. It was, hands down, the best pizza I've ever had. I live in Chicago and eat a lot of pizza and I usually don't like it. This pizza had the most amazing crust I've ever tasted, wood-fired or not. No red sauce makes me instantly a fan =P, the toppings seemed kind of strange but blended together perfectly with the melty cheese. Yum! For dessert I got the Ugly But Good which was huge! I felt bad for a kid sitting at the table next to me staring in envy. I liked my friend's ricotta cheese fritters even better then my dessert though. I would dip them in the chocolate sauce and ahhhh so tasty! Honestly, this entire meal was so good!!! I loved it!!!

It has an amazing view of the Boston skyline. That's about it. High prices that do not match the quality of the food. I had the clam bake - the lobster, mussles, and clams must have been cooked for an hour and could barely chew them. The bread must have been left on the counter for a week because I thought my teeth were going to break biting into it. Once the corn and clam chowder cooled down to a palatable temperature, it was watery and tasteless. The appetizers were underwhelming.

Because this is in close proximity to UCF, you will most likely be carded . We also decided to place orders for food since we knew it would start to get slammed.

And when it finally does...I have already moved out of Crestview. So, when I finally venture back over to my old hood, rest-assured I'll be stopping by Brentwood Social House. The parking is sparse and it's not he easiest spot to access. Plus, I got heckled a bit by a neighbor man about my parking. Albeit it very legal, I don't think he liked me too close to his house. I decided to move and had to circle the block a few times before a spot finally opened up in their lot.\\n\\nFirst of all, the service was superb. I don't think it's a coincidence that the first thing you see once you walk through the door is their glass case proudly presenting pastries. So, naturally I go straight for their house-made lemon cake along with a Lavender tea to accompany said cake. In conjunction with the pastries, you're also greeted by a friendly barista as if they were awaiting your arrival. The best part about the service, though? They find you! That's right - you take a number and they roam the fairly large coffee shop looking to serve you. This is something, at least, I don't usually encounter at a coffee shop. Typically, they call you up to the counter to administer their medicine...er coffee. \\n\\nSecondly, the space, well, is spacious. At first, I was disappointed to see every table taken by a fellow laptop-addicted friend, so I moseyed on to the muggy outside (yes, there is a whole yard with picnic tables if you do decide to make an outdoor outing out of it) only to discover there is a  whole other side to the Social house that is deliberately designed for children. I am not talking a meager book collection and sad, broken, need-battery toys. I am talking a whole built-in shelving unit with books, gadgets, widgets, and toys to excite even the inner-child in me. But more importantly - to excite the mom in me. I can take my kid here and not be judged for it! Hooray!

The food came out very quickly starting with the takoyaki and crispy chicken. The takoyaki was standard but hit the spot - hot and delicious. The crispy chicken is a must - the side sauce nicely complements the dish, and the chicken is juicy, perfectly seasoned and does not taste saturated in oil. There's a dash of honey (?) on the chicken which was a great touch. Wish it were slightly more crispy though! \\n\\nAs for the ramen, we ordered the karaka men with a tonkatsu broth that had a pleasant level of spice and was not too rich in fat, and the miso ramen which had a richer broth that was nicely balanced with the miso. The noodles were al dente. Each had a generous serving of char-siu that was slightly charred, providing that extra umph of flavor.\\n\\nThe establishment was super clean and the staff were pleasant and attentive.

With every speech, they defended their quality, with no substance. At every turn, it seemed a rehearsal for a play about a 5-star Italian restaurant, each item prepared by a prop-master rather than a 5-star chef. Each course served by an actor rather than a passionate, food-educated, server-friend. Throughout this important night for us, we were disappointed.\\n\\nWe arrived at 5:24 in a freezing-cold blizzard & the doors were locked. When they let us in at 5:27, there were 8 people rushing around, dropping menus and placing last-minute decorations. We were nudged to stand near the inactive bar where we spent another 8 minutes dodging the frenzy of freaked-out employees. It was as if we arrived far too early for our 5:30 reservation. At a full 360 seconds early, our arrival was traumatizing. \\n\\nWhile it's a pretty room, there's a disconnect in the hearts of the employees. The manager seemed unsettled. There was a harried, confused look on the face of each person. While we loved the diversity of the staff and were lucky to have a new & intelligent waiter, neither could make up for the inconsistent quality of the food and the chaotic, confused front-of-house service.\\n\\nAs we gazed upon our forced-menu, we were hoping to add an appetizer before hopping on the $95 meal-train, but were talked out of it because we were to receive a special nosh due to our birthday guest. With it's sub-tiny portions, we were hungry throughout the meal - and the special birthday promises were half-hearted. \\n\\nThe staff tried to be upbeat, but they are not 5-star-quality trained. This is a management problem - not the waitstaff's fault. We love to connect with the hearts of the people around us. Trying to connect with this waitstaff was a challenge. There was fear in their eyes, a reticence. As they wandered around the rooms, they seemed anxious. This comes down to training - as well as confidence in the leadership, which was limited on this night. \\n\\nIt's easy to be fooled by pomp & circumstance (rather than expect a deserved 5-star experience), especially in a small town like Boulder. If you compare Frasca's slight-of-hand & ego-pricing to worthy 5-star restaurants, Frasca falls short. In addition to well-trained hosts, guides, food experts & waitstaff, top restaurants offer treats throughout the meal, as if to say, \\"We know our pricing is high, but we want your night to be special.\\" Not here. \\n\\nThe raviolo was delightful. The duck was excellent. The octopus was perfect. The squab was tasty. This amounted to 4 (very-small portions) out of 10 tiny products we felt were top-shelf. The lobster was sad, as if it landed in an ill-suited bowl meant for porridge. It was topped by a droopy thing that was both impossible to cut and potentially terrifying. The carpaccio, although draped to form an enlightening mandala, was without flavor or concoction. \\n\\nEven the formaggi (cheese as dessert) was poorly planned. Two bitter cheeses & a blue cheese. The idea here would be to have 3 unique cheeses. If you're truly paying attention to the palette of your customers, how do you miss this? How do you miss so much?\\n\\nThe final bill came to $550 for 4 people, which would have been a great deal IF we were dealing with a unique, high-quality experience. Had we spent this money wisely, we would have gone to four (4) friendlier, more consistent restaurants for the same total price. \\n\\nFrasca represents how money, momentum and charade can cloud perception. She is like a soulless, sexy prom date who proudly giggles as her hair bounces atop her shoulders. Or the flexy football player who has no idea he is without a measurable intellect. \\n\\nFrasca is out of touch with its staff and it is ill-equipped to provide an honest value in this class of service. When God gave out excellence, Frasca said, \\"Nah, we'll take the shiny salami cutter instead!\\" (Find it near the front door.)\\n\\nThe final crumb on this crumbled Entenmann is that just 15 min after our dessert, the house manager rushed over & frantically offered, \\"Loved having you, can we get your coats?\\" Subtext: \\"LEAVE NOW!\\" Really?! WOW. Just WOW! A first for us! \\n\\nWe were all very kind and left with gratitude. I was not going to blame an entire staff for an inconsistent chef and a stressed-out manager with her ill-timed, unconscious shoving out the door. We weren't even given a chance to enlighten her or her frenzied underlings.\\n\\nI later spoke with a manager to inspire an upgrade here at The Frasca Museum. He apologized then sent us a personal note, which was very kind. ALL WAS WELL!\\n\\nBUT THEN the house-manager's husband aggressively pursued me via FB, email, phone and in-person at my office, angrily asking me to change my review. This was STALKING and the house-manager should have tempered him. \\n\\nTrue 5-star professionals don't fall apart, enroll bullies or take feedback personally.

Our party of seven- we did have a reservation- was seated right away, but our server took at least 30 minutes to serve us our wine and another 20 to take our appetizer/meals orders.

If it was not for the appetizer, I think most of the party would not have been satisfied.

After giving our credit cards, the server spent an additional 20 minutes complaining about the math and the fact that we split the bill. Our server also told us how much to tip them, stating that we should at least leave 18%. This restaurant had a lot of potential of making repeat customers, but left us all wishing we had gone down the street."},{"name":"Red and Green Brazilian Steakhouse","address":"5979 Buford Hwy NE, Ste B1","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"This place was EXPENSIVE.  I tried this out for my birthday, my brother got us a groupon for 4, for half off.  The original price of our meal with two bottles of wine would have been $212, but instead was $106. \\nDespite the groupon, the waiter told us that we have to be charged 18% of the $212 (value of the meal w/o groupon) and she told us it would be around $45. \\nMy math says that is $38.16.  So I do not know why she wanted to round up.  The bottle's of wine that were included in this groupon were basic wine bottles you could get at the grocery store for $10 and under, and they were charging $29.99 for those bottles.  The bottles we were allowed to include in our meals had to be $29.99 and under.  If it was greater, then you were responsible of paying the difference.\\nMy sister had a fruit fly in her cup, and the \\"cheese ball\\" bread that they serve tastes disgusting!  It tastes like bread with gooey dough that hasn't been cooked enough in the inside. \\nWe were excited to try every meat available, and had to request chicken hearts which took another 20 minutes or so for them to cook. \\nThe ambiance was nice, beautiful, and pleasant to dine in.

I arrived at 12:05 and sat at the bar awaiting to be greeted. I quietly sat there for 15 minutes as servers and bartenders passed by, essentially ignoring me. It was not until I had reached out to a bartender, Beach, to ask about my order. Instead of actually checking, he continues to make drinks and when he finally does check, fails to update me that it is not ready. As 12:30 approaches, I ask him if the meal is ready and he told me that he would check again. Ten minutes pass, I ask another server if she could check if my To go order is ready. She reports back to Ryan who then tells me that they did not get the order and then questioned if I had called the right restaurant. After pulling my phone out and showing them that I had, Ryan who I assume is the manager on duty told me that they would be able to make my meal for free. First off, they made no apology which to me shows zero accountability for the lack of professionalism in this situation. The root of my frustration is that if Beach could do his job decently (not even as a bartender but as an effective communicator) and tell me that my meal wasn't even placed, I could have left and not wasted my time at the bar. \\n\\nThis location is ultimately known for having very late and horrible service.

I have to give it only a 3 for a few reasons. \\nReason's it is really a 5:\\n1. It is beautiful! This theatre is just so incredibly pretty and new, it really feels like luxury. \\n2. The seats! The seats are beyond comfortable! they recline and are loungers, so you can stretch out and really enjoy the movie. \\n3. The food. Great selections and something really different for a movie experience.\\n4. Happy hour. Even if you do not want to see a movie, the lobby has a full size bar so you can come in and enjoy happy hour drinks and food. \\n\\nThe reason I gave it lower:\\n1. The price! The tickets are more expensive than most movie theatres, including AMC at Disney Springs. \\n2. The food. The food is really good, but there is not adequate space for you to actually eat. The tiny little table you have is barely big enough for you to set your plate on. \\n3. Waiters. I totally understand that they are new and are working out some kinks but we never had a waiter return to see if we wanted anything, yes you can push the button but still. They dropped my friends pizza and had to make her a new one and they never brought our bill. We could have walked out not paying and they would have had no idea. But my husband and I being good people had to find the waiter to pay. When we got into the theatre, our waiter just stood next to us waiting for us to order. It was very uncomfortable and I felt rushed. I also asked if something could be left off and he did not know. \\n\\nI do really like that they have a full bar in the lobby (which is small) that you can have happy hour before going inside. I do wish we would have gone into the theatre earlier to really look at the menu and maybe start eating because once the movie starts, it is dark! You cannot see your food. My sandwich, which was really good, was falling apart and I could not see to get it back together. This theatre has some kinks to work out, but I do think it will be a great place to see movies, especially for date nights. I do look forward to going back once everything gets settled. It really seemed like everyone was standing around not knowing what to do.

We ate at lunchtime when the restaurant operates in a quick service format, which is much cheaper than dinner.\\n\\nI had the cup of potato leak soup, which was good. The soup was smooth and creamy. The onion flavor was very prominent, and a sharp onion flavor lingered on the back of the tongue between bites. \\n\\nI tried a bite of my dad's cup of French onion soup. The French onion soup was also good. The soup was piping hot and featured lots and lots of cheese which is the best part of the soup in my opinion. Of course, I love cheese so much my dad says I must be a mouse. I told him I was happy to be a mouse so long as it was Minnie Mouse.\\n\\nThe master's cupcake, chocolate sponge cake topped with what Disney calls Lumiere's grey stuff was delicious. The grey stuff is cookies and cream mousse and delivers on the promise with a strong cookies and cream flavor. The cupcake is topped with crunchy, crispy \\"pearls\\" and a thin piece of white chocolate.\\n\\nDisney usually makes excellent unsweetened ice tea at its restaurants. I was disappointed that the Be Our Guest unsweetened ice tea, made from black tea, was very strong. I mentioned the issue to a server, politely suggesting that they have a professional taste it and consider replacing it. She ignored my suggestion but unhelpfully asked me if I would like sweetener for the unsweetened ice tea since it was strong.\\n\\nThe kids meals are very small portions - too small for children over 9 or so. \\n\\nI was very surprised, given Disney's attention to detail in the flavors of their adult meals, that the kids meals were very basic and bland (unseasoned). If your kids are picky eaters, in that they don't like different foods or flavors, then the kids meals will likely suit them. If your kids generally eat what the adults eat and like different flavors and spices don't order the shrimp or the macaroni. \\n\\nThe whole-grain elbow macaroni was served in a small bowl with marinara and shredded mozzarella on the side. The amount of marinara was about the same as a side of tartar or cocktail sauce and was insufficient to coat all the macaroni, and what was coated was underdressed. This lead to a refusal to finish the macaroni which I understood because who wants to eat plain macaroni? \\n\\nThe shrimp of the shrimp and broccoli kids meal was also bland and unseasoned. There was no flavoring from the grill. The dish consisted of six small shrimp.\\n\\nThe broccoli florets served with both kids meals were inconsistently sized. One floret was huge and very difficult for a little one to cut. The difficulty in cutting due to size was exacerbated by the fact the broccoli was very undercooked. I like al dente but not almost raw broccoli unless it's on a salad.\\n\\nThe peach applesauce was thick and tasted of both peaches and apples.\\n\\nThe server was very nice and surprised the little girl who was celebrating her birthday at the next table with a small dish of Lumiere's grey stuff shaped like a Mickey head and a birthday card.\\n\\nThe restaurant offers opening seating in your choice of three dining rooms, each with different themes. The main room, which is also the largest, is set up like a ballroom or fancy dining room. \\n\\nThere is also a smaller room decked out like the west wing, very dark with ripped tapestries; thunder and rumbles add to its atmosphere. We originally sat in this room but moved before the food arrived. We were seated at a table for four along the back wall near the corner. It was so dark I could not see details of my family's facial expressions across the table. \\n\\nA third small dining room is also available. The room features a statue of Belle and the Beast in the center and portraits deck the walls.\\n\\nBe advised the ladies restroom does not have enough stalls for the size of the restaurant. There will be a line. (Pro Tip) Do not stand directly behind the door; it will hit you when a guest opens it not knowing that there is a line on the other side."},{"name":"Donut Queen","address":"5842 E Burnside St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"This was a tough review.

It just looked like the sort of place you'd go to find a great donut. The gentleman inside was incredibly nice. I ordered two apple fritters and a raised donut with chocolate frosting which came out to $5.00 - a great price.\\n\\nThe fritters were hot and fresh and massive. The raised was clearly fairly fresh as well. As soon as I got to the car I had to try the fritter. I was disappointed to find it was just really oily. Oil was pooled in places and the fritter's dough just wasn't fluffy like you'd like.\\n\\nThe raised donut was better, but not mind blowing. It was totally solid (and didn't have the grease problem), but there wasn't a ton of good flavor either. \\n\\nI've heard so many great things about this place, I couldn't go lower than 3 stars.

For my last stop, I invited my friends to join me at Continental Seafood Restaurant to enjoy a $178 set menu for 6 people. \\n\\nit is my first time dining here. When I was selecting which restaurants to go, the menu from Continental Seafood Restaurant immediately attracted me. It is a 7-course menu that can feed 6 people. I invited four friends to tag along, and it was exciting for me because it has been a long time since I have such a fancy Chinese meal. \\n\\nThe first two dishes are Crab Meat Fish Maw Soup and Roasted Pork with BBQ Duck. The soup is beyond my expectation, with a generous amount of crab meat and pieces of fish maw in it. The big bowl can fill up to 7 small bowls, so my friends can go for the second round! I love the crispy skin from the roasted pork, and the ratio of fat and meat is perfect. \\n\\nThe Sautee Jumbo Prawn with Superior Soya Sauce arrives next. Again, I am surprised by the portion, which I believe it has more than 10 jumbo prawns in the dish. It is flavorful, but unfortunately, I wish the prawn itself can absorb more of the soy sauce flavor. It tastes somewhat bland on its own. \\n\\nThe next dish is the one that excites me the most - Braised Lamb with Bamboo & Chinese Mushroom in Hot Pot. Lettuce is included on the side. Putting lettuce in the braised lamb hotpot is a common thing to see, as it can absorb all the flavors from the sauce. This type of hotpot is rare and often expensive in Vancouver. Therefore, I am surprised to see this on the menu. The lamb is tender and flavorful! I would totally order this again next time I am here. \\n\\nThe last two dishes are also as fabulous as the others - Pan Fried Black Cod with Soya Sauce and Sticky Rice with Preserved Meat & Sausage. The black cod is cooked and seasoned perfectly. It is soft and flaky, but I hope it is more \\"pan-fried\\" than deep-fried as it looks they dipped the fish into corn starch prior to pan-frying it.\\n\\nThe sticky rice is one of the best sticky rice I have eaten in Vancouver. You might think I sound exaggerated, but I love the egg strings are so thin that the flavor is in every ingredient of the dish. It is not overly seasoned, and I won't feel too heavy after eating more than a bowl.\\n\\nUnfortunately, we didn't get the dessert, which is also included in the set menu because we were too full with quite a bit of leftover. The server offers us red bean sweet soup and fortune cookies. \\n\\n*** Overall Impression ***\\n\\nContinental Seafood Restaurant is rated at 3.9/5, and I think it totally worth at least 4.5/5. Almost all of the dishes are perfectly seasoned and cooked, and with this $178 set menu, it can probably feed more than 6 people. If you do the math, each person is paying around $35-40 after tips and tax, which is reasonable for a fancy, high-quality 7-course meal. The restaurant is spacious and clean, with good service. I will definitely return on my own time to try their dim sum and get the Braised Lamb Hot Pot once again. \\n\\nTaste : 4.5/5 * Service: 4.5/5 * Ambiance: 4.5/5 * Quality-Price: 5/5"},{"name":"Great Harvest Bread Company","address":"8926 SE Sunnyside Rd","city":"Clackamas","stars":"4.5","text":"Wonderful smiles and great service.

I still love their cart service - I believe this is one of two or three cart service dim sum spots left in the city. Some people don't like the cart service because the food isn't as fresh, but I've never found that issue with Continental. If you want to order off the menu and have any dish cooked up fresh, you can do that too. \\n\\nI keep consistently coming back because they always have my favourite dim sum dishes: \\n+ Ha gao \\n+ Siu mai \\n+ Prawn spring rolls \\n+ Prawn tofu/prawn eggplant\\n+ Sweet bbq pork bun\\n+ Deep fried prawn wonton\\n+ Curry fried squid\\n+ Steamed prawn roll\\n+ Custard egg tarts\\n....I like prawns, okay, and Continental delivers on all the prawn dishes.

Each consecutive visit just got worse. A few days ago my wife had the unagi don and though the rice was leftover from the day before. Being Asian she knows her rice and knows what day old rice tastes like and how its texture is. My bento box was so-so. The tempura was great, no problem there except for the size of the zucchini piece. Cut far too thick for a proper cook. The salad was pedestrian, nothing special but my rice/teriyaki chicken was dreadful. The chicken hadn't been cooked recently and certainly not made to order as it came fast. The rice was gummy and not very appetizing. Maybe it was day old as well, not sure, I like day old rice when my wife makes a batch and we have leftovers the next day.  I didn't even bother eating the Cali rolls that came with it as they didn't look tasty at all. The best thing on the table was either the tea or the napkins. I mentioned these things to our server and instead of apologizing she told me I was incorrect and said she check with the chef. As I was paying she came out of the kitchen and just walked in by without a word. I generally still tip when I get bad food as it's not the servers fault but the way she handled it, including the non-apology, forced me to enter 0$ as my debit card tip option.

Hunger.\\n\\nWalking back into the central court at Bridgeport (Hey Boss! Lets build an outdoor mall in a place where it rains a lot!!!) and there was that new hamburger stand, Joe's Burgers.  Seems like a viable option since we were not in the mood for overpriced pizza or a bad noodle place (names were withheld to protect the innocent).\\n\\nJoe's is a kiosk, so you walk up to a window and order from a limited menu of burgers, dogs, fries, drinks and shakes.

I ordered a classic cheeseburger combo and asked if I could upgrade to the chili-cheese fries (fearing calcium deficiency I occasionally load up on cheese).  It perplexed the poor girl taking my order, but we got it done.\\n\\nWhen my food arrived the chili-cheese fries were covered in onions.  I have been eating chili-cheese fries for a while now and never have I seen them come with onions.  I have seen an option to special request them, but never with them on them... especially when I ordered my burger without tomato and onion.  Put two and two together, people.  I must have looked upset because some lady asked what was wrong, I stated that the menu does not list onions on the chili-cheese fries.  She told me it didn't say anything about cheese either but it was on there and would I like some without cheese?  I looked to my right at the menu, it clearly says CHILI CHEESE FRIES.  So I opted to pick off the onions as I wanted nothing to do with this woman again.\\n\\nThe burger was not bad, it wasn't anything great either, but it was a serviceable burger.

The pavilion also protects from sun and/or rain. (In cooler weather it also provides a tiny bit of warmth. Maybe it's the body heat? There are no walls, but I swear it's a little warmer under there.) If you prefer, you can bring your own chairs and sit on the lawn.\\nEach event has a variety of vendors available to shop. I have purchased items for the kids, souvenir type items are available (magnets, glassware, clothing, etc.) packaged food and jewelry. Of course tents are set up serving German cuisine including schnitzel, potato pancakes, torte, sauerkraut and wursts. Menus are written on large sign boards. Wait on line and order from the staff. Napkins, cutlery, mustard, etc are located at a table after you pay.\\nThe food options have expanded this year. At the past two events we attended, a food truck was on site that caters to vegetarians. Well done. Also this last event included a private space to nurse baby. I know many women are comfortable nursing baby in public, but some babies prefer a quiet space and are distracted by all the goings on. So again, well done. There was also a cigar truck at this last event; off to one side so as not to interfere with the smells of German food cooking. \\nThere is an obstacle course in the woods for the kids and an archery area, plus organized games like tug of war for the little ones. It really is a family friendly venue. We usually meet up with friends and enjoy the day.\\nBanks and banks of porta-potties that are surprisingly clean and include a hand sanitizer dispenser are located at either end of the event area. Sometimes there is a line, but there are plenty and usually you can get one quickly.\\nArrive early for on-site parking at their most popular events. You may still have to walk a bit to get to the event space, but it's an easy walk along a tree lined path from the lot. Keep in mind, this 'lot' is dirt and grass. Because cars are parked there in all weather, the ground is uneven so watch your step and if needed, let staff know you need to drop someone off before parking. If on site parking is full, they will bus you in from an off site lot. Please do not try to walk in from off site. The street is busy. Be patient, they'll come for you.\\nA handful of German beer companies on site dispensing their golden elixir for a fee and if you prefer, a bar near the pavilion offers wine and mixed drinks. Coffee is available in the little shed where desserts are for sale. The milk, cream and sugar are to the side of the building. \\nEveryone we have encountered at the events has been friendly.

Lastly we tried the veggie burger which is very unique. I wouldn't eat it everyday, but I liked the unique creativity , combination of flavors, and the delicious bread. While we didn't love everything, most of the food was great, and I can't wait to try new items when their menu changes. \\n\\nService was also excellent overall. Only issue was that we ordered one food item that was forgotten. I'm sure they would have fixed this and brought us the item if we mentioned it, but we just let it go. We had a reservation and waited a few minutes for a table since it is a popular place. The lounge area for waiting was comfortable with big sofas and the overall ambience of the place is awesome and makes it worth the visit.

Pick your appetizers and extras then decide how you want your hibachi or poke. I went with a steak hibachi. I checked off steak, rice as my base, then you get 5 veggies. I chose green beans, cabbage, corn, bean sprout, and carrots. Then you get to pick a sauce for them to mix in, I went with teriyaki.  Lastly you get dipping sauce on the side, I went with the sweet n spicy....all I can say is wow. They cook everything to order . It was hot n fresh off the grill. My veggies were perfectly cooked. I dont care for them to be under cooked or raw and they were not. These were outstanding.  So good I might even be able to just get a steamed veggie bowl here. The sauce was good too.

I have been traveling around the city eating various pho for about 12 years now.  I hate to say it, but this was quite possibly one of the worst pho experiences to date. So, so many things went wrong.  Other than the food being tasteless and boring (I'll get to that in a minute) the service was nothing impressive either.  I was sat down at an extremely wobbly table (which I was able to fix with a rolled up napkin) and I was given tea and a menu almost immediately.  Unfortunately, I was given enough time to read the menu front to back about 3 times.  I didn't have a waiter to my table to take my order for at least 12 minutes. Now 12 minutes might not seem like a long time to wait... but when you are sitting at a table by yourself and all the tables around you seem to be getting attention, 12 minutes kind of is a long time to be ignored. I ordered and it was about another 10 minutes for the salad rolls to arrive. Oh the salad rolls... what a disappointment. They were just.... not good. This might be the first time I didn't polish off my salad rolls like they were going out of style.  I only managed to eat half the order. They were made with very small shrimp and some chopped salad lettuce.  No flavor at all.  Even the peanut sauce was bland.  I had to load it full of hot sauce to try and enjoy the experience some.  It didn't help.  These were just the saddest, little, salad rolls I have ever encountered. \\n\\nOut comes the pho.  It was full of tendon.  Which would be okay I guess..... if I had ordered it with tendon! Again, had I not been so incredibly hungry I would have sent it back, but I continued to eat. I figured it would still be good, so may as well just eat what is in front of me. It was not good.  Again, it was very bland.  Well, other than the large amount of onions they put in the bowl, it was very bland. They were pretty skimp on the basil and jalapenos they brought to the table, so I couldn't help the lack of flavor with that too much.  I loaded this bowl down with hot sauce!  More hot sauce than I have ever used on anything. \\n\\nWith so many great pho places in Portland, these guys would rally need to step up their game for me to return.

The burger was simple, yes, but it was delicious. It was cooked nicely and the patty was juicy and flavorful. The onions, lettuce, pickles, and tomato tasted very fresh as well. The only reason I took off a star was because of the fries: they just weren't that great, were small, and a bit flimsy. The onion rings were great though, so I'd suggest going with those. We ordered a chocolate shake. It was BOMB. It was so creamy and chocolaty, but not overwhelming. Like others have pointed out, the shakes are made with Bluebell Ice Cream so you know they are good.

He was much more interested on whatever was on the screen of his cell phone than anything we had to say. I asked him for some hot Chinese mustard and he walked me to the condiments that included basic ketchup and yellow mustard. When I reminded him of the spicy part, he pointed to the 4 empty bottles of Siracha sauce.\\nWait, it gets better! Watching him and the other staff was truly an instructional on how NOT to treat guests. Our dirty dishes piled up, they would come by and pick up some, never all though. The thought of offering another fountain drink to replace the empty ones never crossed their collective minds, I'm certain. More than once we witnessed Leo come into the dining area, do absolutely nothing, turn and walk back out, usually with his cell phone in hand. We even saw him clean a table with one hand and read a text(?) from the other, and once walked into another patron because he was so engrossed in his phone. \\nThe only reason I posted one star was that some of the food was decent, and the price was reasonable, beyond that nothing, and I mean nothing about this dining experience was positive."},{"name":"Bread & Co","address":"1230 W Fairbanks Ave","city":"Winter Park","stars":"4.5","text":"This place is so good. \\n\\nI heard about them online and really wanted to stop in during their soft opening to see how everything was, and I was not disappointed.

They serve two specific soups each day of the week, one special rotating dish, and a selection of banh mi sandwiches and beverages including bubble tea and Vietnamese coffee.  Also, the owners are always there, and are so so lovely. \\n\\nThe first time I went, on a Saturday, my dining partner and I shared the Chicken Curry Soup, and the daily special, a fragrant and flavorful Beef Stew.  The second time, on a Wednesday, we shared the Spicy Beef Noodle Soup and the Chicken and Bamboo Shoot Soup.  I've also tried the \\"strong\\" iced coffee with condensed milk and the taro bubble tea.  \\n\\nThe Chicken Curry Soup was delicious.  The broth was a flavorful yellow curry with coconut milk, and aside from their classic rice vermicelli noodles were large, perfectly cooked pieces of bone-in chicken, carrot, and potatoes. \\n\\nThe Beef Stew was served with either noodles or baguette, and we opted for the baguette, which is the same style of baguette used for Banh Mi - thin, crusty exterior, with a very soft white interior.  The stew similarly had large pieces of carrot, and potatoes, as well as large tender pieces of beef.  The broth was delicious, and definitely had some ginger and lemongrass, as well as some other fragrant herbs such as thai basil, and probably some star anise, cloves or cinnamon. \\n\\nThe Spicy Beef Noodle Soup included slices of cooked beef, pork, and ham, in a slightly spicy beef broth.  For some reason I was expecting a broth more reminiscent of the Taiwanese style beef noodle soup but this was much lighter.  Still very delicious but different from what I expected.  My dining partner loved this soup, but I preferred the other option that day - \\n\\nThe Chicken and Bamboo Shoot Soup was SO good.  It was a really light but flavorful broth - there is just that perfect richness and flavor that comes from a simple light broth that has been lovingly tended to for hours upon hours.  This is that broth.  Again, there were pieces of tender bone-in chicken, along with some chicken breast, as well as the vermicelli noodles, all topped with sliced bamboo shoots, cilantro, and crispy fried shallots. \\n\\nThe food here is delicious.  It is so reasonably priced.  The service is wonderful.  What else do you need? Nothing.

Pork tenderloin sandwich is better than the burger. So is the beef pot roast sandwich and the grilled Reuben melt too. Seafood and chicken game is strong here.

Surprisingly there are low calorie salads and soups on the menu and they are just as good as the other food despite being light choices. So members of your family or group can each decide if they are going to be naughty or nice and nobody gets left out even if on a diet. This is so rare for fast food places.

Unfortunately, at around 3 am my youngest and I woke up throwing up. My mom woke up with cold sweats and abdominal pain. This is the 1st time my family goes through this. I wondered how many families where impacted? I was offered a free meal for the inconvenience.

Located in swanky Buckhead, Atlas makes every diner feel like a special guest.

I had heard great things about it, so we decided to check it out around 11:30 a.m. on a Sunday.  Oddly enough, we didn't have to wait in line because we opted for an outdoor table.  \\n\\nFOOD (4/5): Decent tasting food.  There wasn't anything special about it, but it hit the spot. I ordered scrambled eggs with hashbrowns, bacon, and a biscuit.  What was nice was they asked me how I liked my bacon cooked.  I prefer for mine to be crispy, which was exactly how it came out.  I also asked for a side of gravy to go with my biscuit.  I ended up getting turkey gravy (like you would put on top of turkey at Thanksgiving).  I was expecting the sausage gravy that you typically get with biscuits and gravy.  Perhaps my server was just confused since there are Yelp reviews that say they have sausage gravy.  My husband got the special - pastrami sandwich with green beans.  He thoroughly enjoyed it and had no complaints.  The one complaint I have was with their coffee.  It had a burnt taste to it in both of the cups I had.  \\n\\nSERVICE (5/5):  I thought everyone was pretty friendly.  We didn't have to wait too long to get our food.  It seems like there's a lot of regulars that keep coming back here.  It's nice to see locations have that kind of support from the community.  It seems like the outdoor section where we were seated was a shared section because we had different servers who came to check up on us. \\n\\nIt is a smaller location and easily crowds on the weekend.  I'd plan to come early or anticipate a wait.  All in all, this place is pretty reasonably priced and locally owned.  I'll definitely come back.

Let me set the scenario for you Yelpers: my parents, whom I love beyond words, were in Portland for vacation (they had previously lived here 5 years) and my dad was reuniting with old work friends and what not. We have a fairly large table out on the deck including my boyfriend and I, drinking beers having a good time. The patio is pretty active and starting to pick up since it's a nice early August afternoon. My mom and I decide to order some food and this is where I start getting frustrated with their service. In general, the servers there are ehhhhh, ok. Not super friendly but not completely dismissive and for god's sake would someone tell the bartender that his shit does, indeed, stink? I get it, dude. You're really hot and think that just because you're a hot bartender you can get by with barely the friendliest service. Not saying he's rude but more like he looks at your ID, not at you and asks you what you want, serves it and moves on. ANYWAYS, so before we order food the server (a female) is obviously busy with her tables and when we do decide to order food she replies with this, I shit you not- \\"The kitchen is really backed up so don't expect your food to come out right away.\\" To my mom and me. Umm, do you want to run that by me one more time? I get what she's saying- they're busy but the way she said it really rubbed us the wrong way. Coming from a bevy of shitty food service jobs, I know the right and wrong way to let a customer know that the kitchen is behind. Plus, it's not like our table was being rude in anyway and we weren't constantly demanding beers. Oh, don't worry, at this point we're not expecting much which sucks because I generally do like this place. It's got an awesome back patio and good happy hour and close to work and my coworkers and I have been there before and had a really good time. This experience however, kind of soured my view of RT.  Luckily, a busser/server wearing the teeniest tiniest dress was extremely nice and friendly. Romtoms IS cool, so much in fact that the hip looking servers and bartenders forget that the people ordering the beers work for a living, too.

Boma is one of the two main restaurants within the Animal Kingdom Lodge, and it is a fabulous buffet featuring the cuisine of Africa.\\n\\nI truly had no idea what to expect (ostrich eggs? giraffe steaks? filet of African cichlids?).....I did not know what they offered, but I was willing to give it a try. What I found was a delightful restaurant, set under thatched roofs and themed like an African marketplace. Much like a lot of buffet restaurants, you grab a plate and start sampling different types of food as you walk along the buffet line. Many of the foods look very familiar to an American audience, but there are specific flavorings, sauces, soups, and pastries which are authentic to the many different countries of Africa.\\n\\nA lot of the food is vegetarian-friendly (vegan and gluten-free, too). I skipped the traditional tossed green salad station, and went straight for the soups: spicy Nigerian peanut soup, coconut-chicken-curry soup, and carrot-ginger soup to name a few. Then there were bowls of stew: oxtail,  Cape Malay lamb stew, and a Moroccan harira stew with lamb, lentils, and chickpeas.\\n\\nEven though I skipped the tossed green salad, they had couscous, quinoa, hearts of palm with lentils, and an avocado, grapefruit, and papaya salad. Wow!  All of these flavors, colors, and textures were fabulous!!\\n\\nFor the entr√©es they had whole-roasted salmon, roast chicken, a spice-crusted beef sirloin, and something called Pap and Chakalaka, which is a spicy South African dish of onions, tomatoes, and beans. There was a kiddies section with Mac & Cheese, chicken nuggets, pasta & meatballs, and other sorts of rugrat grub.  The buffet station with vegetable side dishes had several different types of rice, cabbage, and roasted veggies.\\n\\nThe dessert station was my favorite with traditional cheesecakes, brownies, coffee tarts, and fruit cobblers, mixed with guava panna cotta, and my new all-time favorite dessert -- Zebra Domes. These are Amarula mousse dome cookies covered with a chocolate ganache and striped like a zebra. Move over Girl Scouts, I've found something better than Thin Mints!\\n\\nWe were all pleasantly surprised by the very delicious food, and the friendliness of everyone working the buffet lines. The chefs would take the time to answer questions about the ingredients and the way that things were prepared.\\n\\nIn the end, we ate entirely too much food, but loved every bite.

Our meal came out to $43.55 before taxes so it's a bit on the higher end when compared to some other dim sum restaurants (most of the dishes were medium except for the squid which priced as a special dish).\\n\\nEven given the size of the restaurant, there was a bit of a wait by the time we left. However, I think this might be more of an indication of their lack of efficiency. If you're looking for a dim sum restaurant that still serves push cart dim sum, it's not a bad place to try out. But if you're looking for a specific dim sum dish, it might be better to order the dish off the menu instead of waiting for it to come out."},{"name":"The Consulate","address":"10 10th St NW","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Simply amazing.

All in all, I still think it was a good deal compared to other Brazilian steakhouses. That would end up costing a lot more at other establishments. \\n\\nUpon entering, you'll notice the cool fountain to the right and the atmosphere felt pretty jazzy. You are greeted by the host and from there the host will lead you to your seats.\\n\\nThe salad bar was good, although I just wished there was a bit more variety.\\n\\nThe amount steaks that came to us was just right in my opinion. I got to try most of the meats although it took awhile.

I was so disappointed in my crispy coconut shrimp entree that was supposed to come with sticky rice. They forgot the side dish so all I got was the shrimp positioned all over this massive pile of puffed rice noodles inside this huge puffed rice clamshell. It tasted disgusting and looked ridiculous. The server never came back to check in and when she did I asked about the puffed rice monstrosity and she said that was not the side of rice, but an edible presentation piece.

The cioppino I had for dinner the night before was *to die for*--I just wish I'd been given more bread to sop up the gravy.

Are you sure everthing I orderd is in there? She assured me it was. Well guess what. The order was incomplete missing several items. Of course I was home already with people wondering where their order was. I called them and they put me on hold for ten minutes. Finally the girl on the phone offered to put me in their blackbook for a free cheesecake slice next time I visit. Obviously they have problems filling orders.

The bread was thick and foamy and toasted on both sides till it was hard and almost black.in nawlins the bread is not toasted.Its olive oil dressed and fresh and yummy.  The olive salad was mainly black canned olives with a few green ones and no spice at all.No celery. No onions. No spices.  Seasoning and vinegar and heat were all missing. Very sad. And the olives were presliced from the can not chopped and hand pitted like a nawlins olive salad. As for meat I was expecting at least a quarter inch of meat or more as their menu picture shows.  But what I got was literally six thin shave slices of deli ham. Thin as carl buddig meat.I counted them. Six.  And five overlapping shaved hard salami slices. So very little meat in fact I thought about calling them again but didn't want to waste any more time with them. \\n\\nFor ten dollars one would think that there would be tasty fresh bread. Nicely spiced and correct recipe olive salad. A goodly pile of meats. And flavor. I got a dry crusty ham shave melt with canned olives. So sad.

Probably one of the best in fact. You are taken on a special culinary experience that will leave you satisfied and enlightened.\\n\\nAtmosphere: 8\\\\10\\nJiko is the kind of place you can come for any occasion to get an authentic experience of African cuisine, and the restaurant itself caters well to that expectation. There are different areas to the dining room, however we were placed in one of the side rooms that had about 5 or 6 tables for groups which made the perfect setting for a quiet atmosphere. \\n\\nService: 7.5\\\\10 \\nOverall the service was very good needless to say, everyone who helped us during the night was very professional, friendly and kind. We were promptly brought to our table upon arrival and almost right after our server brought the drink and food menus and explained some of the favourite options to us. We decided to go with a wine flight consisting of 3 different types of African wines chosen carefully by the sommelier. The sommelier was considerate to allow us the try the wines before having the full pour. Each wine was great and it was fun trying to dissect the differences between the three. \\n\\nOne critique I have about the service was part of the ordering process. I'm not sure if our server was having a bad night, but they didn't sound very enthusiastic about the dishes they were telling us about, and when I asked for some favourites and must have's they didn't have much more to say than \\"everything's good\\" which is a particular turn off for me. \\n\\nDuring the beginning of our meal they showed us where the baked the flat-breads and did a mini tour of the restaurant. And to top it off at the end of the meal they offered to take a family picture for us.  \\n\\nFood: 8.5\\\\10\\n\\nTo start the evening they brought cold African tea which was refreshing and had a sweet hinge to it. A perfect way to open up the palate. Afterwards they brought out the bread with whipped butter to start us off. This was all \\"included\\" in the meal. \\n\\nTaste of Africa (15$) - This dish had flax seed naan bread served with four different inspired dips, all with contrasting flavours. The bread went well with the dips, offering a variety of flavours including pappadum, sesame fatir, hummus with pomegranate. \\n\\nWatermelon Salad with goat cheese, and micro-greens. (seasonal). \\nThe fresh taste of the watermelon and what appeared to be a local African fruit (didn't get the name of it), was incredible and light to start off the meal. The goat cheese gave it an extra kick of savour which complemented the other ingredients well. \\n\\nMushroom flatbread (14$) - Another starch starter that wasn't heavy but was a great addition to the meal. The three different mushrooms all had unique qualities that brought out garden flavours. Topped with ricotta and herbs , this dish is another adequate choice for a starter. \\n\\nOak-grilled fillet mignon (49$) - This plate was a beautiful thing to look at let alone eat. Either way the beef was cooked tremendously, packed with juicy goodness from the grill taste and paired with squash mash dots placed perfectly over the plate. This dish takes a toll on the wallet but makes up for it with the taste it gives. \\n\\nBeef short rib (48$) - Probably my favourite dish of the night, the short rib was fall of the bone amazing! The sukuma wiki collared greens hidden underneath the rib were wonderful with a slight bite. Also waiting underneath was samp and beans cooked perfectly and the demi glace was just the exact sauce the dish needed to make it perfect. \\n\\nSeafood Curry (47$) - A quad-fecta of oceany delight comprised of lobster, calamari, shrimp and mussels all thrown together in a coconut curry sauce which had a slight zing to it but not super spicy all topped upon a bed of saffron infused rice! Interesting to be on the menu, but I suppose when the restaurant is African inspired it includes many different flavours and varieties of dishes. well done. \\n\\nKilimanjaro (mousse cake) (11$)- With pistachio crumble and peppercorn meringue this sweet treat was a great dessert option to share, and it almost made me feel guilty tearing apart, having been so beautifully plated. Definitely a highlight of their dessert menu. \\n\\nSafari sunset (carrot cake) (11$) - Topped with lemon creme, citrus gel and candied carrots, this was another great rendition of a cake most people would snub at the choice of many other options. I would certain eat carrot cake all the time for dessert if it was served like this. \\n\\nOverall impression - Jiko is a memorable experience that is hidden inside the amazing property of the Animal Kingdom resort. Walk off your meal by exploring the outdoor gardens and \\"safari\\" area and do some animal observing. The food and service were exceptionally good for the most part and I would suggest getting your best value out of this restaurant for any couple or family with children who are a little older."},{"name":"Pepper Box Cafe","address":"932 SE Morrison St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"Ever since I've been a little kid I have had a strong affinity for green chiles.

We had to ask for tea and were given only a tiny selection of panchan. Tables around us received at least two more types of panchan. At least they did keep our dishes full.\\n\\nThe chigae - in our case a tofu and seafood soup - was good, but not great. No raw eggs were offered (boo!) and the portions were rather small. The seafood consisted of a couple pieces of tiny shrimp and a single mussel, along with some chopped clam. It had a good shellfish flavor and there was plenty of tofu. And mom liked it. \\n\\nI wouldn't go out of my way to eat here again.

It is a no frills Vietnamese restaurant that serves up flavorful and authentic dishes. I came here with a group of four on a Friday night and was seated right away. Their menu is huge, full of every combination possible and there is something for everyone. They are known for their vermicelli (bun) bowls and they did not disappoint. We all got a different type of bun bowl (steak, chicken, egg roll, and tofu). I've actually never had a vermicelli bowl so I wasn't sure what to think but WOW. The bowl upon arrival looks beautiful and I didn't want to mix it all up it was so pretty. The steak was perfectly cooked and the peanut sauce...I could've drank it. My understanding from a friend who frequents Vietnamese cuisine is that Vietnamese peanut sauce is darker in color and is a bit more acidic compared to the traditional peanut sauce. I loved it and enjoyed the mild peanut flavor with the acidic and I couldn't get enough. I dumped it all into my bowl and mixed it around and the bowl was empty pretty soon. This will become a regular for us. Thank you Pho Paris for the delicious food!"},{"name":"Izumo Sushi Japenese Restaurant","address":"13631 100 Avenue","city":"Surrey","stars":"3.5","text":"Absolutely gross! The fish is not fresh.

IMO hands down best banh mi in town and some of the best food in general. I ate here 3 times in one week. The ambience is cozy and you can definitely tell that this place is a mom and pop. The hours are alittle odd so google it before you go. \\n\\nCost: everything is relatively affordable and makes sense for austin. The pho ranges from 9-10 bucks and the banh mi is only 6 bucks. The appetizers range from 3-8 dollars. My favorite being the crispy pork roll and the chicken wings! \\n\\nTaste: the taste is divine. The banh mi is perfectly crisp with the right ratio of fillings. The chicken wings are hot and crispy. They make asian style wings. The pho is really good too and there's this hint of cinnamon that I can't decide if I love or hate. The meat is always tender here. Oh and they don't use msg in the pho and it's fresh everyday. The crispy pork roll is really good and I like the crispy roll in the center! \\n\\nOverall: check them out and they may become your favorite Vietnamese restaurant in town."},{"name":"Anh and Chi","address":"3388 Main Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Now is there really another Modern Vietnamese restaurant in Vancouver that is more happening than here? The answer is NO. There is not. Anh and Chi has done an excellent job creating a bright and fresh and vibrant atmosphere while serving darn good authentic Vietnamese. The food is decorative, and the restaurant has a great vibe. \\n\\nSome of my favorite dishes here:\\nCay Me - Tofu salad roll is excellent!\\nChicken Skewers - Made w Chicken Thigh\\nCha Gio - Best spring roll in Van! They also have a vegetarian version\\nGi Rau Mung - Water spinach beef salad!!!! My fave fave fave!!!  Sometimes I get a bowl of rice and just eat this as a meal all too myself!!\\n\\nI have not yet tried but i have seen everyone order the Eggplant skewer. Looks excellent and next on my list.\\n\\nThe rice plates are also excellent because rumor has it that their kitchen staff is the OG kitchen staff from Pho Hoang, the owners parents former restaurant which was in this exact location. A little bit of what makes this restaurant so special is that \\"Anh and Chi\\" means brother and sister. And a brother and sister team that own this restaurant carried on their families legacy and also turned it into their very own.\\n\\nI want to come back soon to try their tasting menu. There is just soooo sooo much to try here.\\n\\nAlso, if you have a chance, try their cocktails! Excellent!

I can see why they love this place!!! It gets super busy on the weekends which makes it hard to get a table so I recommend going during the week. \\n\\nThe Chicken 65 is a favorite of my friends and boyfriend. I love it with the sweet chutney (?) that comes with it. I honestly don't taste a difference with the creamy looking chutney but it doesn't hurt to have it. I don't taste too much spice considering how red it is. It's so light and crispy.\\n\\nThe butter chicken comes with a slab of butter on top which makes it taste richer. It comes with pieces of dark meat I believe. The chicken tikka masala comes with white meat. There's a bit of a kick to them if you're sensitive to spice so be careful! \\n\\nThe naan is best if you eat it in the store. It's so crispy and delicious with the butter chicken or tikka masala! I would recommend 2 pieces of naan per order of curry, I had so much masala left using only one piece of naan. \\n\\nI've also had the tandoori chicken which has an amazing smokiness if you'd prefer something that's not fried like the chicken 65. \\n\\nFor 3 pieces of naan, an order of butter chicken and 2 orders of chicken 65, I paid less than $30.

With an unlimited budget, I'll have a superhero-themed wedding - the wedding party will be the Justice League; my best man will be dressed as Superman - I'll be exchanging vows with a bride dressed as Wonder Woman and I'll be in a Batman costume.  After exchanging nuptials, the wedding banquet will involve 500 of our closest friends, lots of cognac and sharkfin (sorry, but this is a *DREAM* wedding) and dancing the night away as Earth, Wind & Fire plays live.  Just call me an old-fashioned hopeless romantic with simple dreams.\\n\\nThe site of the banquet?  Pink Pearl, of course.  It's really the only Chinese restaurant big enough to host a party of this magnitude.  As Melissa F. points out, no matter how crappy this place got - Pink Pearl is classic Vancouver and, as far as I'm concerned, the only proper place to host a wedding banquet.\\n\\nI'm torn on how to rate Pink Pearl (the name seems to a euphemism for a part of the female anatomy rhyming with 'Doris'... but I digress...).\\n\\nIt's featured in Vancouver tourist guides for 'authentic' Chinese food and probably the longest standing dim sum/Chinese banquet joint in Vancouver.  Ask some old school Chinese Vancouverites and they will tell you this is the amongst the first Chinese restaurants to be opened outside of Chinatown.  So, this place is an institution - not just for East Van but for the entire city.  Oddly enough, it's just down the block from Brave Bull's (another East Van institution).\\n\\nHowever, over it's storied legacy it increasingly catered to Western and tourist tastes and it steadily slid downhill and Chinese crowd went elsewhere.  I remember coming here a few years ago for dim sum and I swear I was the only Chinese client present.  Even my non-Chinese friends could tell this place sucked.  I think that explains most of the bad reviews for this place.\\n\\nAlso, a lot of people will consider this a 'shady' area of Hastings - it's by the docks and there are streetwalkers around here at night.  It was neglected as people caught on this place actually sucks.  Then - the place caught fire and the place was closed for months on end (my first guess was insurance fraud).  I felt surprisingly saddened - where was I going to hold my dream wedding?  It's just so old school Vancouver.  It's like an old deaf and blind dog - it's functionally useless but you can't help but love it.  I know all the old businesses in this area are being bought out for condo developments, so just a sign of the times, I suppose.\\n\\nSo I was excited to hear it was renovated and reopened under new management.  It's now spiffy clean.  I came here for dim sum - even with a 10-table daytime banquet and the usual Saturday morning dim sum crowd, maybe only 60% of the restaurant was occupied.  I took a peek and there are mahjong tables in the VIP room as well.\\n\\nThe dim sum carts are now gone and the made-to-order dim sum items were up to par with the usual standard in Vancouver now.  It's now a place that I would actually eat at now because the food is good (nothing mind-blowing, but solid) - not just for nostalgic appeal.\\n\\nYou can't knock the huge parking lot and you can pretty much walk in at anytime and grab a seat.  They also have 20% off if you order and close your dim sum bill by 11AM.\\n\\nI'm glad Pink Pearl is back and I don't have to make excuses for it anymore and make appeals towards sentimentality.\\n\\nDon't think you ever see a fat Chinese man dressed as Batman pop-locking to 'September' performed live by the surviving members of Earth, Wind & Fire?  Probably won't happen - but your best chances are to pop by Pink Pearl on September 21st, 20XX.
