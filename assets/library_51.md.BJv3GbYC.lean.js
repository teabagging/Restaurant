Not sure if that is a testament to how how long, chronologically, this particular franchise has been at this particular locale, or possibly, could it be the last time anyone in all of print media felt compelled to give a little love....? \\n\\nWe loved that 5Gs offered such a swell assortment o' toppin's, incl. the grilled onions and mushrooms, though they (shrooms) were undoubtedly of the canned variety, they were still a welcome addition and difference from most chain restaurant offerings.

One cross word, or harsh glance and *poof* evil carbs immediately teleported to ones buns or perhaps somewhere even less flattering.\\n\\nOne other observation, and Lord knows it's a small thing.

The waiter was perfunctory, more like a wait-bot. Hmmm. Looking over the menu, I'm seeing a number of dishes that have chili, and as chili and the two of us don't get along in any way shape or form, I know I'm going to have to be very specific with the waiter about what's in the food. So I look him straight in the eye and say \\"we're interested in A, B, and C, and we absolutely cannot eat chili, is there going to be a problem?\\" and he says \\"no, no problem.\\" And you can see where this is headed: first dish he brings out, and there's chili all over it, which I know because my lips and tongue are burning. I can tell you, I'm pissed, I'm really pissed, and if he had bothered to come back I'd likely have shoved the dish down the front of his pants and walked out. But I didn't want to upset me wife any more than she already was, between me eating the chilis and she eating the chilis and me wanting to do damage to the wait staff.

Recently this place has gone downhill. Went this past weekend for breakfast and had an entirely horrible experience from the get go. The hostess skipped us and seated three other parties that arrived after us and then when we asked we were told they wanted to give us a more comfortable booth. We were promptly treated by our sever who was attentive. My husband ordered eggs over easy which came out with clear whites. When he asked to have them cooked some more the waitress said he didn't know what over easy meant. Over easy does not mean clear egg whites. I had ordered cheesy hash browns and scrambled eggs. My scrambled eggs looked like a plain omelet that someone stepped on and the hash browns were burnt with a congealed glop on top. My husband had to go to the bathroom (no doubt due to eating raw eggs) and there was no toilet paper or paper towels.  Breakfast is the easiest meal of the day.

They were good, but not incredible.  \\nAt the end of my trip to Portland, we decided to go back and see if the other flavors were available. We hit the jackpot.  They were a little slow and the girl behind the counter spent a lot of time talking to us about the flavors and having us sample each one. \\nOne of my favorites surprised me. The salt ice cream with caramel was great. I am not a caramel fan, but the salt ice cream really helped to make this unforgettable.\\nThe marionberry habanero ice cream is perhaps the best ice cream on earth. It is vanilla ice cream with a berry/habanero swirl. The first bite you think is quality fruity ice cream and then the heat hits you and your mind gets blown. Perhaps this is not for those that can't stand to have anything spicy, but if you can take a little heat, go for it.\\n\\nGo here, no matter what the weather."},{"name":"Momiji Japanese Cuisine","address":"3720 Mt Seymour Parkway","city":"North Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Super, super rad Japanese food!\\n\\nOwners are insanely hard-working and nice, food quality is top-notch and yeah, it's the place I go when I want Japanese after work.  \\n\\nSupport them and you won't regret it!"},{"name":"Palmyra Mediterranean Grill","address":"10020 152 Street, Suite 167","city":"Surrey","stars":"4","text":"The food is fresh, well flavoured, and delicious.\\nI love their hummus and one of the yogurt dipping.\\nI've had take-outs from this place several times from my mom before I head down there myself.

I can't remember the name, but the one made with tequila, St. Germaine, sauvignon blanc and lime was amazing! For appetizers, we had the french onion soup and escargot. For dinner, we had the roasted half chicken and petit calf's liver. While all of the food was delicious, the petit calf's liver was outstanding. Unfortunately, we didn't have time for dessert.\\n\\nNow for the oh-so-slow service: I arrived on time for our reservation and was seated promptly by the hostess. While waiting for my friend to arrive (about 15 minutes), the only service I received was having the water glasses filled. My server never stopped by to welcome me and ask if I wanted a drink while waiting. Big no-no in my book. When my friend arrived, the hostess told her I hasn't arrived yet and I had to go get my friend to sit at our table. It was then another 20 minutes before the server stopped by our table. Seriously? It was a busy Friday night, but this is inexcusable. We place all of our order - food and drinks at once. It was 15 minutes before we received our cocktails and another 10 (25 minutes total) before we received our appetizers. Once we finished eating our appetizers and the plates were cleared, it was another 30 minutes before our entrees arrived. At this point, we had 15 minutes to eat and pay for the meal before we had to leave for the theatre right down the street. We should have had plenty of time with nearly 2 hours scheduled for the meal, but with the slow service, we couldn't have dessert and had to wolf down our food. We were also never asked if we wanted more drinks. Argh....\\n\\nSo, maybe we just had a bum, hardly-ever-happens crappy service at Petit Robert. I hope so because the food was so freakin' good. But that experience was enough to make me not want to go back. Maybe I'll try another location one of these days, but not anytime soon.\\n\\nI'd rather go somewhere we the service is good enough that I don't have to ask after my food and wonder if two hours is long enough to schedule for a leisurely dinner."},{"name":"La Fiesta Mexican Grill and Catering","address":"3000 Curry Ford Rd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"First went there 3 years ago and liked their food a lot.

We like meat.  \\n\\nBefore our plates of meat came out, we were served two types of breads-one a wheat bread to be topped with salted butter and honey, and one white that was best with the salted butter.  Both were tasty.  The charcuterie plate came out and was very substantial and delicious.  I can't recall each of the different options it came with, but one was a rillette, a pate, a mortadella, and two more cured meats.  It was all delicious.  \\n\\nThe hot dog and burger came out and ohhhh, man.  What a treat.  The burger was topped with avocado, a fried egg, and cheese and the medium rare was more like rare, but it was fine with both of us.  The burger was deliciously beefy and a treat.....definitely above and beyond a typical burger.  Again, it was a splurge, and should be above and beyond anything you normally get.  It definitely was.  The hot dog was HUGE.  Insert your own joke here, will ya?  It was hands down the best hot dog I've ever eaten.  I mean, it should be, it was like $16.  The bun was a buttery little taste of heaven, and the sauerkraut that sat atop the dog was perfect.  The dog had a good snap and amazing flavor, and was really the size of a sausage.

Service was a little discombobulated (service has never been Till's strong suit), but everyone was friendly and enthusiastic about the offerings, and the spread of baked goods was pretty impressive.  There's some counter seating in Izzy and Mo's itself, but more importantly you can sit anywhere in the outdoor seating area that they share with Till.\\n\\nWe ordered the Izzy Bagel and the Mo Bagel, both of which took a little bit of time to arrive.  The Izzy had house-cured organic salmon gravlax, cream cheese with caviar, and capers on a house-made bagel.  The salmon was beautifully flavored, and the slight hint of caviar in the cream cheese was one of those innovative touches that I'm so fond of Till for doing.  There was also a small side of pickled sliced carrots.  The Mo came with house-made hummus, which was slightly coarser than the usual stuff you find at Middle Eastern restaurants, and also had nice chunks of raw garlic, plus a few green olives and figs.  We also walked away with a few baked goods for the next day.\\n\\nLike Till, dining at Izzy and Mo's is neither particularly quick, nor particularly cheap.  But it's GOOD, and in my view, worth both the price and the wait.

I've tried other egg tarts around Boston's Chinatown before and Winsor's egg tarts were the best in Boston's chinatown by far. By 1130 AM, I overheard a waitress telling another customer that they have already ran out of egg tarts!!\\n\\nAnother dish that I would highly recommend to all you dimsum lovers would be the XO carrot cake. That is some good stuff! However, it is a rather big serving and sharing it with your friends would be a good idea as it can fill you up pretty quickly. Also, my friends and I agreed that their siu mai, pork ribs and shrimp cheong fan are MUST-HAVES when you visit Winsor. One thing that really disappointed me were the custard buns :( The filling in the buns is a little more solidified than I'd like it to be, and there wasn't that tinge of savory taste to that sweet filling that traditional custard buns should have. \\n\\nHaving said that, price here is super reasonable. We ordered a table full of food and only paid 13 per person. Definitely my go to place for a dimsum fix whenever I visit Boston again."},{"name":"El Camino's","address":"3250 Main Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3.5","text":"Decent tacos, though the beef was a bit dry.

Truly top quality ingredients are tasted and the passion for food shows through in most cases. \\n\\nThe service in the short times I've spent there seems to depend on the person serving and the mood in which they are allowed to be in... considering the environment. At times it's absolutely platinum-dining-wear on a black satin tablecloth, where at others I wish I had brought the silverware my aunt gave me rather than donating, and white butcher paper for a table cloth... but....wait!!!

I can't remember the last time I saw such nice looking greens in a salad! They were tossed in a very light vinaigrette, and it was seasoned beautifully. Some might say it was salty, but it wasn't it was perfect! For entrees my wife had the burger and I had the pork. The burger came with caramelized onions, white cheddar and a creamy whole grain mustard on thick cut toast. The meat was super tender, and tasted like it was ground 30 seconds before it was cooked! It came with roasted potatoes that were perfect. \\nThe pork dish was roasted pork shoulder with braised kale over creamy polenta. The polenta tasted and felt like it was cooked to order and the kale tasted farm fresh. The pork its self was cooked to perfection, and seemed to be scented with fennel. The dish almost smelled and tasted like a delicious Italian sausage! \\nAnother good thing is that they always have a few good beers on tap. They had Ninkasi and Amnesia.

Some of the pieces were fatty, but the meat was moist and flavorful.  It came with a small cup of pickles which helped cut the fatty, salty flavor.  The sandwich was huge and I was stuffed afterwards.  A little later, I wanted to try a bit of my jerusalem bagel and ended up eating the whole thing.  It had a chewy texture and was topped with chili powder and sesame seeds.  \\n\\nTogether with a 15% tip, my total was just under $20 which was more than I typically spend on lunch.

More than anything, I'm giving 4580 three stars for its staff failing to use common sense. The restaurant is open until 2:30 p.m. for lunch. We arrived five minutes until 2 p.m. The waiter seemed so desperate to leave that he told us that they were closing. We then brought it to his attention that it is posted on the website that the restaurant closes at 2:30 p.m. We turned to another employee and asked for confirmation as to when the restaurant closes; they said 2:30. At this point, we were wondering why someone had not simply said; we're happy to serve you, please have a seat. Instead, they seemed confused and irritated that they had to seat us after the closing time was made clear by us to them. Of course, this makes for a really uncomfortable dining experience because we knew that they just wanted to get the hell out of the restaurant. Consequently, any degree of comfort, relaxation, and enjoyment were pretty much undermined. It was even more disappointing because I brought someone to the restaurant for the first time after speaking highly of it. That was also undermined. The waiter's desire to get out of the restaurant also made for poor service, purely due to a lack of attention. As we were wrapping up our lunch, four women came into the restaurant in two separate parties. The waiter, once again said; we're closed instead of saying; welcome, we're happy to serve you. We looked at our watch and it was 2:29. If I were the owner, I'd be annoyed as hell if my staff were simply focused on going home as quickly as possible. If it's not past the closing time, it's revenue. Our lunch was about $35 for two people without alcohol. If the other two parties had a similarly cheap lunch, that's $100 in revenue that would have been missed if the waiter would have been able to simply turn people away. In turn, there were other patrons there still eating. Fortunately, the chef seemed to have enough sense to tell the waiter that the women could be served, and so they were sat. It was obvious that the waiter was irritated and irked that he still had to work, at his job no less. I think the owner ought to have a clear discussion with his staff. If they don't really want to be there, fire them. There are a lot of people looking for jobs, why ruin a great ambience and excellent food with uncommitted employees that can't think from the perspective of an owner. In turn, they should learn the food, the drink, and the expectations of the clientele, which is always to be served as if the choice of a restaurant matters to the customer. There are over 400 restaurants in Boulder; that's stiff competition, which means that in the future, when we have a choice, we're going to pick a place where we feel welcomed and not rushed given all things being equal in terms of food quality and ambience."},{"name":"Chipotle Mexican Grill","address":"6607 S Semoran Blvd, Ste 108","city":"Orlando","stars":"3","text":"The first time I visited a Chipotle restaurant I was on a work assignment in Charlotte, NC and the food was absolutely amazing.

I concluded we would end up spending almost the same money at either place and many people said the service at New American Cafe was horrible.  So we went for the $$$ place.  The Museum and Restaurant were not very busy.  we were greeted with a friendly smile and were taken to a table immediately (I did reserve online before leaving home).  It seemed like we waited at least 5 minutes before the waiter came over, but once he did, he was very friendly and attentive.  My husband and I both enjoyed the food immensely.  The bread basket was filled with 2 small pieces each of 5 different types of bread.  Loved 4 of the breads.  Very fresh, came with a small dish with fresh butter.  We each had the 2-course meal; hubby got crab cake and eggs Benedict; and I got Greek Yogurt with fresh fruit & granola and eggs Benedict.  The Benedicts each came with a tiny black iron skillet with potatoes, which were ok.  I'm not a huge fan of potatoes with my eggs anyway.  But I also felt that the skillets were somewhat tacky; don't think they went with the decor/feel of the place.

I LOVE THIS CHICKEN. Compared to other places, their chicken is moist and the skin is so crisp. It's always scalding hot because it's so fresh. Also, their pieces are way bigger than other chicken restaurants.\\n\\nWe always get the 10 pieces of chicken (we like dark meat, it's also cheaper than white or mixed), fries and a large gravy. We also pump like ten little cups of ketchup and I use about seven of them myself. My friend loves to scoop the gravy. She dunks the whole piece in and again for each bite. The fries are crinkle cut like from my childhood. The gravy is smooth and perfect. There are never any leftovers... it's Goodbye Chicken... but we're usually back every couple of months."},{"name":"Nando's Flame Grilled Chicken","address":"204-3000 Lougheed Hwy","city":"Coquitlam","stars":"3.5","text":"Usually my go-to place whenever i work out here at the Steve Nash in this same massive plaza w/ lots of free parking.\\n\\nIt's one of the bigger ones, about 50 seats and more, good corner location.

I used to work in a sushi restaurant, and I will seriously be surprised if this place is open next year. \\n\\nMy husband and I had some time to kill in Portland and so we decided to get some sushi for lunch. We were a little wary of the 50% off sushi and rolls sign and the fact that it was completely empty inside, but decided to try it anyways. \\n\\nThat's when things really started to hit the fan. \\n\\nFirst, the waitress was on the phone ignoring us and waved us to seat ourselves. By the time she finally got us water and menus she was still on the phone. She didn't tell us about the obscure legend of the sushi menu, which happened to bite us in the ass later. She didn't ask us what we wanted to drink or introduce herself, just threw down some menus and walked away, talking on the phone still. When she finally was off the phone she maybe said two words to us. \\n\\nSecond, our food was spaced out so that my husband was finished with his teriyaki chicken before I got my sushi. When I did get it, it looked completely unappetizing. The size of the pieces was ENORMOUS, which made it difficult to eat, the avocado was mushy, I almost choked on the lukewarm eel because of all the bones, and the fish was warm as well. \\n\\nThird the waitress comes with a bill that is much higher than what I was expecting, and when I asked why, she finally then explained that only certain items are 50% off. I told her that's very misleading given the way the menu is written along with the sign out front, and then explained to her why I was unsatisfied with my meal, gesturing to my plate that still included 18 of the 24 pieces that were originally served to me and said I refused to finish my food because it was disgusting. She still said I had to pay the whole bill. I told her to split it with cash and a couple different cards since I wasn't prepared for an amount 2x more than we thought it was going to be, and she came back saying not one but all of my cards were declined. Even when I spelled out for her how much to charge per card she wasn't able to run them, and proceeded to lecture me on how I should be more mindful of my finances. I showed her on my phone my available amount, which was more than enough to cover the bill, and instead of trying it again she just said not to bother and to leave when we were ready. \\n\\nI asked for the manager's phone number so I can make a formal complaint, since they have help that is incompetent and can't even run a credit card correctly, and I plan on calling him tomorrow to let him know what a horrible experience we had. My husband says the only redeeming value was the miso soup and his chicken teriyaki, but that's not saying much because they are almost impossible to mess up."},{"name":"Zaftigs Delicatessen","address":"1298 Worcester St","city":"Natick","stars":"3.5","text":"For the wayward vegetarian who somehow finds themselves eating at this place, you can do much better.

The free bagel chips are not that enticing, I wouldn't bother. Pickles are mediocre, which was a surprise at a deli.

I had a lengthy conversation with someone who worked there and told me that I would find the \\"Italian home\\" I was looking for in Midtown Atlanta.  This employee also spoke very well of the wine program.  When I arrived I was pleasantly received by the hostess and I chose to sit at the bar.  There was no one designated to work the bar, it seemed to me, because all of the staff would pop in behind the bar and use the computer, grab things that they needed, etc.  None of them had any words for me.  All of them looked at me.  Finally one of them decided to offer me some assistance.  I asked for a menu and after a long wait had to ask for a beverage menu.  I decided to drink water because I was not very impressed with the wine list.  I read the food menu thoroughly and was very interested to try a number of items, but when I asked this server's opinion I got an auto response that was undeterminable.  I ordered my food and waited around ten minutes for bread which arrived just before my caesar salad.  I enjoy caesar salads in Italian restaurants only but in this case I could barely eat the salad.  The dressing tasted like mayonnaise and the slices of cheese tasted like plastic.  It took me way too long to find someone willing to allow me to add fresh black pepper to my salad as well which was very aggravating.  As for the bread, it was edible but not very moving.  I was not offered any vinegar with the bread and there was no way I would be able to get anyone's attention to get any so I left the bread alone.  When my Ravioli's arrived I was offered fresh parm which was a nice touch but once I began eating I was appalled.  The Ravioli's were very hard which at first I took for an Al dente approach.  I decided to continue eating them just to see if it would get any better but sadly it did not.  I dissected one of them while I sat there alone at the bar to find a mush that resembled nothing from the description, however no one ever stopped by to find out if I was enjoying my meal.  These ravioli's tasted like Chef Boyardi beef ravioli's that had been left on the counter for a few days.  awful. and expensive.  I looked at a dessert menu which looked nice but I dared not get burned 3 times in one meal.  Absolutely disgusting.  When I told my server how unpleasant the meal was as I was paying my bill, the server simply said, \\" geez, usually it is pretty good.\\"  No apologies, this server or this restaurant did not care one ounce about me.

None of the dishes were bad, but most I honestly don't remember, with only a few that actually stopped the conversation with awe.\\n\\nWhat tipped the star scale for me tho was the service.  Our waitress was knowledgeable and PATIENT and willing to joke around with us.  Just like a sushi restaurant, we ordered in fits and spurts and giggles and she handled it all very well.

Might be paint or flooring, or machinery still airing out from being brand new but it was noticeable and unpleasant. Another small yet large annoyance was the (ladies) bathroom; it smelt like wet dog and and there was no paper covers for putting on the toilet, eww! (Note when I say there was no paper covers there is not even a holder installed not that they ran out and it needed to be refilled).\\n\\nThe food itself was good! Nothing that I would consider over the top rave worthy but it is good quality and taste. \\nThe bread was soft and fresh and the veggies were crisp, tomato was not soggy (this is important!). \\nNegatives were there was too much mayo, no sliced pickles to put on the sandwich and you have to add mustard to the sub yourself, which if I am paying you to make my food I want it ready to eat not to have to fix it myself. Really how much longer does it take to just spread some mustard on the bread for me vs giving me a packet to do myself. \\n\\nThe noise level was higher than average. It is a small tight shop with one speaker for music towards the back of the store by the restrooms. I'm not sure if they have it so loud because they think the customers care to hear the music vs having conversation or so the employees have something to listen to while working. But they (the employees) yell their greeting at you when you walk in due to it.

I was impressed by the cooking of chef Naomi Pomeroy after watching Top Chef Masters. I was even more excited to have the opportunity to visit Portland and dine at her restaurant.\\n\\nBrunches at Beast seem almost like exclusive events, having only 2 seatings each Sunday at 10am and 12pm. Doors open exactly at the time of seating, as patrons are allowed to enter and sit at long community-style tables. Reservations are a must. The cozy restaurant is small and quaint, with an open kitchen on one side and the plating table right in the middle. It's nice to see the chefs working to prepare all the ingredients and plate all the dishes just a few feet away. Seeing everything come together from scratch gives the diners a feeling of comfort that the food is fresh and cooked with care.\\n\\nWe started brunch off with a light bing cherry clafoutis topped with a smokey and crispy thin slice of maple-glazed bacon and some powdered sugar. The pastry was soft, creamy, and had an almost flan-like texture. Fresh pitted cherries added a rich dark fruit flavor and some sweetness. The dish was paired with nice crisp white from Germany.\\n\\nOur second course was exactly what I pictured in my mind as the ideal brunch entree. A lovely fresh poached egg sat on top of some potatoes, romanesco, maitake mushrooms, and summer squash, all with some hollandaise sauce poured over them. To make things better, delicious tender duck confit gave the dish its savory element. Some mustard greens, a drizzle of chive oil, and a slice of crispy bread on the side finished off this picture perfect and tremendously tasty \\"Beast Hash\\" dish. A low acidic Beaujolais from France paired nicely with the dish as well.\\n\\nFollowing the main entree, we had a small plate of cheeses with some fresh farm greens. The cheese were a French sheep cheese, an Italian goat cheese, and a cow's milk cheese from Washinton state. This dish was paired with a chilled smooth white wine from France that had a hint of sweetness to it.\\n\\nTo finish off our meal, we had a chocolate truffle cake. The creamy cake tasted rich and had a very smooth texture, topped with a peach leaf and white chocolate mousse that was not too sweet, so it balanced well with the chocolate cake. A strawberry rose from France was paired with this dessert.\\n\\nOf all the food I ate in Portland that weekend, the brunch at Beast was my favorite. The food was not only fresh and delicious, but all the wine pairings complimented the food well, and I could really see the thought that went into each dish. Portland should consider itself lucky to have Chef Pomeroy at the helm of such a wonderful restaurant. I cannot wait to go back and treat myself to dinner.

Chicken, farm greens, scallion bread. I tried the greens first and they were delicious. I tried the bread and was underwhelmed with the first bite, but by the last bite, I'd have wanted more. It was quite good. The chicken was the frustrating part. It tasted amazing with the bed of gravy. It seemed well cooked all the way through, but the temperature was lukewarm at best, and varied between pieces (the drumette was the coolest piece, the wing the warmest, and the thigh in between). It struck me strange enough to wonder if it had been already made and waiting for someone to order it just to send it out. The greens were nice and warm, perfect temperature for a cool evening, but strangely, the chicken didn't match. Despite the amazing flavor of the chicken/gravy combo, that one minor oddity was what I took away from the meal.\\n\\nEverything else finished up in short order, and the bill arrived and was paid efficiently.\\n\\nI'd be happy to try it again, under the assumption that it was a quirk the first night I went there."},{"name":"The Butcher Shop","address":"552 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"The Butcher shop is legit.

Somehow, somewhere in between yelping and googling to find Maki Maki in Allston-Brighton, I stumbled across Maki Maki Woburn (I don't believe there is any affiliation). After navigating the backroads of Woburn to avoid the drudgery of 95N, I finally came to Maki Maki, which is way in the back of this plaza-type area....\\n\\nInitial thoughts:\\nSuspect...it was surrounded by office type buildings that had shuttered for the night, and there weren't many cars in front of the restaurant...\\n\\nBut...let me say... WOW!\\n\\nEnvironment:\\nNice, sleek, modern. Not too loud, not too quiet, not too light, not too dark. The hostess set us up at \\"the coolest table\\" (her words) - a big table in an alcove facing the sushi bar in the center. Yes, it was very cool.\\n\\nHow it works:\\n$23.99, all-you-can-eat (not buffet) dinner. They give you a menu, you order, they bring. It was a bit confusing b/c when I called and checked reviews, it seemed like you could only order 1 or 2 plates at a time, and then you open the menu and it says that sushi/sashimi comes with \\"1 piece per order\\". But no fear - the waiter asked how many pieces we wanted, and we had no problems with not being able to order enough or having to wait long in between orders. I do think they should make it a bit clearer how the ordering process works though.\\n\\nFood:\\nQuality was excellent. This knocks Minado out of the park. The sushi is hand-rolled (as opposed to a press), so the fish sticks to the rice as it should. Quality of the sushi/sashimi is also great - I didn't get the chewiness that you get with cheap sushi. We ordered about half the menu... everything from beef tataki to sashimi to rolls to salmon teriyaki to \\"Oreo Delight\\" (translation: tempura fried oreos! no lie.). Some of the rolls were kinda forcin' it (\\"Patriot Roll\\" - has fried banana in it?? Strangely it kind of worked, the gimmickiness aside...), but overall the food quality and presentation (yes, presentation at an all you can eat) were great.\\n\\nAll-in-all:\\nI actually like the \\"all-you-can-eat\\" format better than the \\"buffet\\" format - food doesn't get wasted, food quality is superior, and as long as they can keep the quality up like this and have attentive waitstaff like tonight, this is a keeper!"},{"name":"Pasta Da Pulcinella","address":"1123 Peachtree Walk NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"First off, let me say that the service was excellent.

Beef or chicken with bitter melon are my favorites as well as authentic Mongolian beef which unlike many local restaurants that add all sorts of veggies so they can short you on the beef Yummy provides a lot of beef and spice, so you may want to order it mild if you are sensitive to spicy hot dishes. \\n\\nI usually do not start my meals with soup but I have found that their egg flower soup to be the best, with true chicken broth flavor and an assortment of fresh vegetables including sliced snow peas which to me is unique to Yummy. \\n\\nLily is right, they serve the best Walnut shrimp.

We were told with all the appetizers they can add additional pieces to accommodate the size of our party which I found to be a plus. The deviled eggs were small delicious bites. My only complaint was that they skimped on our bacon pieces which were smaller than what I thought we'd be getting compared to other yelpers photos. \\n\\nWe also had for appetizer, the Hog n Hooch. These were huge! I was expecting small sliders sized biscuits but no, the thick cut of pork belly was monstrous and hanging over the biscuit. Definitely a plate you would share. \\n\\nAlso from the small plates, we had the Red Neck Nachos. Yes, that's the items name. What it is is pork rinds and creamy grits. Very tasty. \\n\\nFrom the supper menu, we had the chicken and waffle and half pork rib rack. The waffle was delicious, had herbs in it which gave it a savory taste. Can't have waffle without the syrup. There were three pieces of lightly battered chicken. The dish came with a spicy hot sauce for the chicken. For a first time having chicken and waffle, I am glad I tried it here and I was very impressed.  I would definitely order it again. \\n\\nThe pork rib were dry about not fall off the bone. It also had a thick BBQ sauce. I was highly disappointed. If this is also what they throw into the bucket of chicken for an additional $15, then I will pass and just get the whole fried chicken with no ribs. Way too dry.

Asked if I'd like \\"some gravy for dipping\\" I declined (once again, worried about portion sizes as I'd ordered three different dishes) and with a pat of Land O' Lakes Whipped Butter as the alternative condiment I will note that although slightly sweet with an ample crunch this is the sort of bread that is made for dipping - not that it was bad, but more that it was a sort of dense carbohydrate sponge that would prove useful as subsequent plates arrived.\\n\\nOrdering half portions in order to maximize tasting while saving stomach capacity, my first dish to arrive would be a $6 plate of gnocchi described as \\"homemade potato dumplings sauteed in a fresh plum tomato sauce and topped with fresh mozzarella and baked.\\"  With the dumplings clearly handmade and so light they seemed ready to float off the plate and the blend of slightly sweet yet subtly spiced tomato sauce and creamy cheese providing just the right amount of flavor this \\"half\\" portion was easily two-fold the size of an average plate of restaurant gnocchi and served piping hot without suffering from the sogginess that maligns lesser preparations it was substantially better than most, as well.\\n\\nWith the gnocchi plate mopped clean with a slice of bread my next course would arrive with bread of its own and a flavor profile somewhat similar to the gnocchi, but a lot more spice.  Titled simply \\"Tripe\\" and described minimally as slowly simmered in Fresh Plum Tomato Sauce served with Toast Points I was told that this was one of the \\"chef's favorites\\" and at $6.50 for what was easily half a stomach it again proved vastly better than its price would dictate.  Savory, light, rustic, and flecked with spicy notes of black pepper plus pecorino, garlic, and notes of cumin and paprika this was tripe done right and thankfully light despite the significant portion size.\\n\\nRealizing at this point that three half-portions was enough that dessert probably was not in the cards and unable to resist wiping up the tripe sauce with the crunchy garlic bread my final course arrived steaming hot from the salamander oven and as good as the first two courses was it proved to be the best of the night - and amongst the best rustic Italian dishes my Midwestern palate has ever encountered.  Described simply as \\"Layered Eggplant\\" and ordered largely on the word of my server who called it his favorite \\"non-meat\\" dish on the menu this half-eggplant arrived in three thick rounds pan seared to a supple consistency supported by a fried panko crust and sandwiched around whole roasted tomatoes, layers of fresh mozzarella \\"from a store just down the street,\\" and topped with a thick garlicky basil pesto sauce.  To say the least it was delicious, to say more would just be hyperbole - order it."},{"name":"Eat Me Thai","address":"6364 Fraser Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"This Thai shop located on Fraser, close to 49th Avenue.

And service was good, though we detected an odd accent on our waitress that disappeared and then reappeared throughout the meal... witness protection program? Or should we say, vitness protection program?  Also noted: cute t-shirts on all the staff.  Where do we get one of those?\\n\\nOverall verdict: yum.

With the tag of Mirchi and being a south Asian restaurant we stepped into a restaurant with good ambiance. We were told that there is only buffet. I was initially surprised that the buffet counter is small one. There were no appetizers at all which was the first surprise of many which was on store. I am a veggie - all I could found in main course was a over cooked Aloo Gobi, chana masala (which was relatively good) and a dal fry (which I had to believe it is dal fry). There was no flavored rice at all for vegetarians - only one very dry plain rice option was available which none of us could eat. We were served Nan in table - which was inconsistent; some were good, some were half-raw which all of us had to avoid. By this time, as many of you could imagine, we just wanted to run away from the place by paying ~$9 per plate with the hope that none of us have to take a sick day-off !!!"},{"name":"Cinco Mexican Cantina","address":"2851 Akers Mill Rd SE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"Went here Saturday night.

But no one really looked nor cared! \\n\\nSecondly, there are only a few tables throughout the tiny space, and they're all high tables, which kinda exudes that 'casual' atmosphere. \\n\\nNow, I'm all about casual, except the prices are SO expensive, you'd think that you were making an event to have a damn good steak. $44 bucks for a 14oz (heaven-sent) steak- ok, not too bad- PS, sometimes you have to ask for the steak because it's 'off the menu'. But you have to order sides and apps a la cart. Think about it- $44 for a white plate with a slab of steak on it. The idea of it makes me sad. \\n\\nBut in their defense, the steak was truly an amazing experience. As was the steak tar tar. And, not gonna lie, the ambiance was friendly and relaxed, which made the night extremely enjoyable. They never rush you to get the eff out, no matter how many people are waiting for a seat at the 'butcher block' (a block where meat is usually cut, but used as a waiting area for people waiting to be seated!)

I think management should take some time and figure out how to check out order take outs (perhaps have online ordering) and figure out how to alleviate the long lines.

FOR EXAMPLE....waiting in line 15 mins you SHOULD know what you want to order by the time to get to the cashier.

I went here over the winter holidays like every other day with friends and family and it was the perfect environment to relax casually. \\n\\nTheir menu is long so there are a lot of choices. But these aren't just the same old choices you would find in any mexican restaurant. Rather, Holy Taco brings the real deal... they are a truly authentic pan latin american restaurant with food options from all over South and Central America. Let me just say, I studied Spanish and Hispanic culture throughout college and I have lived in Argentina, Costa Rica, and Mexico... so lets just ignore all the pretentious critics who clearly know nothing and let's listen to me for a second. \\n\\nAny restaurant serving tapas is a clear sign that there is a chef who knows his shit.  Oh, and I saw a lot of complaints about the chips being too greasy and fluffy. And while I do agree that they aren't my favorite kinds of chips, that is how they are served in Mexico. They didn't just like blow up in the frier on accident. Each chip is two tortillas doubled over. I'm sure if you tried to sell Kroger brand tortilla chips in Mexico it wouldn't go over so well. But I mean... this is America and so maybe they should change their chips just for all the ignorant folk. \\n\\nHm, my favorite tacos were the brisket and shrimp. Their guacamole is freaking amazing... and when I told my waiter how good it was he said \\"I know. It's like Holy Guacamole!\\" Which I probably laughed at harder than any normal person should. He was funny... but I'll get to the service in a second. My boyfriend had the pork belly torta (sandwich), after it was recommended, and it was sooooooo delicious! Oh my god. It was a little fatty but so are pigs, you know? I also like their corn... your probably like \\"oh cool... corn.\\" But seriously, their corn is crazy delicious and comes out perfectly roasted and decorated all pretty-like. Now for the margaritas... they are SUPER delicious! God! The waiter recommended the organic margarita and of course we thought he was just trying to rip us off so we ordered one normal one and one organic one and although both were delicious, the organic was truly amazing. \\n\\n\\nNow for the service. The servers here are truly beautiful. They are all so attractive and friendly. It must be hard to get a job here because if you're fat or out of shape, you don't work here. I think they interview their employees in the urban outfitters dressing rooms. The first server we ever had was the cutest little soft spoken boy/young adult! He had the cutest shoes and glasses and although he was soft spoken, he turned out to be really funny. While he wasn't serving us, him and another waitress were dancing to the music and you could tell they enjoyed working here which is always a good sign of good management. I never caught his name but I have been served by a young lady named Narrobee, who is just so sweet and so beautiful. She was very knowledgeable about the menu and answered all our questions. There have been several others but no names really stuck out like hers. \\n\\n\\nAnyways. Holy Taco is the best EVER!

There are a few reasons for only 3.  First of all, this is after their soft opening, so I would have hoped some of the kinks would have been worked out.\\n\\nAmbiance and service were great, but the food still has some adjusting to do.\\n\\nCrudo - good texture and flavors, I liked the Himalayan salt, and grapefruit gastrique - a good combination\\n\\nThe scallops were pretty good too - the sauce on the side had a lot of kick but the cucumber sorbet would mellow things out.\\n____\\n\\nBaby Octupi - it was alright.  Beans were cooked well.  The chorizo . . . well, it was hard to find, and if you rolled it all up together it would amount to 2 green peas.  Overall the dish did not have any variety in texture. It was all kind of mushy/chewy/soft.  I wish the baby octopi would have had a little more crunch\\n\\nPork Cheeks - I can't say anything was wrong, but I wouldn't say it was amazing either.  They were served in a bowl that sat on a rectangular platter.  Why am I mentioning the plating?  Because there was a liner on the platter . . .the lining was a cut up piece of their menu . . .  It was another copy of their menu . . . I am sorry, there's nothing creative, cool, or ingenious about that . . . Why a liner?  Because the bread was on it?  I have no idea.\\n\\nMussels - they were tasty, but really- mussels are usually good because you don't mess with them too much.  A good broth, but something you can make at home, but my problem . . . another liner on the rectangular plate . . . another menu . . .\\n\\nSquid Frites - another word for calamari.  Very lightly battered rectangles.  This liner was a blue and white checkered plastic sheet (think fish and chip places).  I thought it was undercooked.  Barely fried to get a light golden color.  Garlic aioli was standard.  Once again nothing that stands out.\\n\\n\\"Poutine\\" - this had promise, but it was very salty. Think saltier than McDonald's French Fries.  The \\"tater tots\\" were the first sign i had of a different texture, but that was very salty as was the ham hock at the bottom.  We sent this back, and the manager was polite and professional.  He came back later and said the ham they got was too smokey and salty.  He apologized and took it off.\\n\\nOur waiter was receptive to the feedback.  He didn't take things critically or personally, but accepted our opinions and said he would relay that back.\\n\\n_______\\n\\nGive this place some time and I am sure it will show promise.  I think they want to jump on the small plates/sharing bandwagon, but they lack the creativity to pull off original flavors like Barley Swine.\\n\\nI would not rush to jump in there.  Give them another month or two.\\n\\n______________\\n\\nI don't know if it is always posted here, but the owner replied to me pretty quickly.  The liners/menus are part of their efforts to be green - reusing.  Functionally, they also wanted to place something so the various items would not slip around.\\n\\nProps to the owner for a prompt response and explaining things.

But I'll feel better after venting.  In my defense, there were no comment cards when we asked for them.\\n\\nWe arrived at the Colonial location 10:30 or so on a Saturday morning, ravenous. The parking lot was not full, so we were hopeful that there would not be too much of a wait to be seated.  Thankfully, there was no wait at all, and the restaurant was far from full.  We were seated right away, but it was at least 15 minutes before anyone even showed up to get our drink order.  Among our group an iced tea, mimosas and coffees were ordered from a young man who showed up at our table eventually, but with no apologies or explanations as to the delay.  Another 10 minutes went by before our drinks arrived and at that point we were asked if we were ready to order.\\nMy sister quite politely but very pointedly said \\"yes, we are ready, we have had  -plenty - of time to look at the menu\\" but this was completely lost on our hapless, barely present server.\\n\\nOrders were put in, drinks were consumed.  Coffee - watery, weak.  Iced tea - weak, watery.  Mimosas - questionable.  I suspect it was just orange juice.  Maybe Tang.  I don't know.  \\n\\nFood finally arrived, and it was hot and we were hungry so we ate it.  Nothing special, I am sorry to say.  I think Toojays food is probably on par with Dennys.  Perhaps the pastries are something special, as most folks seem to say, but I haven't got much of a sweet tooth.  \\n\\nIt's not really the food I have a problem with though.  It was the complete lack of awareness on the waitstaff's part.  We were waiting for a long time for, as far as we could tell, no discernible reason.  When we asked for a comment card before leaving, the response was \\"we don't have comment cards\\".  It should have been \\"Was everything OK?  We don't have comment cards, but if you like, you could talk with the manager.\\"  Or, something like that.  \\n\\nI can forgive mediocre food if it is backed up by good customer service, but I find poor customer service appalling and unforgivable.

Overall, we had a very good experience.\\n\\nI found out beforehand that they don't take reservations, so I was a little nervous about having to wait around for a while - but that was offset by the fact that most other restaurants in the area that WERE taking reservations only seemed to have 5:30 or 9:30 available. So, we either needed to be an elderly couple or...a little younger than we currently are in order to get a reservation nailed down. :)\\n\\nBut my nervousness was somewhat justified. We ended up waiting for a table for a little over an hour. This was mildly annoying. But to the credit of the wait staff, they made the standing around as enjoyable as possible by letting us order a drink and appetizer.\\n\\nWe were finally seated at the bar, and greeted by a very friendly bartender who seemed very knowledgable about everything on the menu. I ordered a steak, and my wife got the lamb. Both were absolutely delicious. My wife thought the lamb was a little overdone, but I thought it seemed great (now you see what I have to deal with.) My steak was very tasty, and an absolutely huge cut of meat - much more than I was expecting. I may be less of a man for admitting this, but I couldn't finish and had them put it in a doggie bag for me. My side was delicious as well - I don't recall the name, but it was basically a sweet corn risotto.\\n\\nI can't speak too much to the wine selection, because I'm a beer geek. But their selection seemed extensive, the staff was knowledgable about it, and my wife enjoyed the 2-3 glasses she had. The beer I had was great.

But as a patron you also find yourself getting much more of an inside look at the staff there. They all seemed pretty stressed and spread thin; probably due to the standard Saturday night rush. You could see the stress and exhaustion on their faces, which made my wife and i feel a little bad.

I like a smoother preparation where the grounds aren't sandy and stuck in my teeth. I like to keep it simple on topping, just hot fudge usually. they have cold \\"chocolate\\" in a squeeze bottle. ugh. then there's the price. we would rather pay by weight since we usually get a small amount of a few flavors. we chose the medium cups. they charge by the cup size so it ended being ten dollars for four small plops of runny weird stuff. we could've chosen the smallest cup but we weren't prepared to not want very much of the offerings. hoped to like this spot but ended up just missing swirl."},{"name":"Beat Brasserie","address":"13 Brattle St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"Delicious Easter brunch.

I had been here before but it was much busier (Saturday). Weekdays... not so much. My date and I walked in and no one seemed to be working. We eventually wandered into a seating area where I learned it was open seating only after I asked a waiter. After seating, I realized that one server was serving our area of 7 tables, thus the slower service. This night my date and I ordered from the Eat and Play combo menu ($16 for an entree and a $10 play card). I ordered the Double cheese burger and my counterpart ordered the Philly Cheese-steak. I have to say the food is no frills just what you expect. You mainly go for the atmosphere. The food quality was pretty much average, maybe a little below your normal chains (Chili's, Taco Mac, etc). But the server (Rob) was polite and tentative to our requests. Drinks were refilled in a timely manner and we got the 'is everything ok?' as expected. After dinner we went to the arcade area, this is what separates D&B from other chains. They have a wide collection of arcade games (new and old) as well as ticket games (new and old, decent prizes too).

It was good, but not spectacular. The chicken was breast meat which can and was on the dry side. The sauce was not spicy and a little too tomato-y for my taste. I like creamier pastas and should have known that I was not going to like this dish. The pasta however, was a nice texture and the fresh ricotta was perfect.\\n\\nTo accompany our dishes, we each picked a seasonal drink from the menu.

So on 12/11/2014 several yelpers got together for a Buford hwy UYE at Las Palmeras, thanks to our Host Dan for finding this place. I have been to only few Honduran restaurants before, when I used to travel on work. \\n\\nThe restaurant is very close to Buford highway, which has myriad Asian and Latino restaurants. 'Restaurante Guatemala' used to be at the same spot before they closed . The restaurant can be accessed via Shallowford rd and but one can also enter from entrance of 'family dollar' on Buford hwy(closer to chamblee-tucker rd) and drive through the strip mall to go to other side. And there is plenty of parking available at this strip mall. \\n\\nWhen you enter, you will see special board right away. The place is huge with so many wooden plank booths, tables and chairs, big speakers for loud Latino music, jukebox and bunch of arcade gaming machines. They even have a pool table. \\n\\nWith all this, when I entered the restaurant was completely empty, devoid of any customers. But few did come in later. \\n\\nAt Las Palmeras, menu has familiar sections - appetizers, house specials, entrees and drinks. It wouldn't be an Honduran restaurant with out Baleadas in the menu and you will see it everywhere in the menu here as well.  \\n\\nBaleadas is kind of Honduran street food, which is basically a large flour tortilla folded with refried beans, sour cream and other variant ingredients like veggies, avacado or ground meats depending on the cost and needs. At Las palmeras, they have Baleadas with meat(Baleadas con carne), eggs(Baleadas con Huevo), avacado(Baleadas con aguacate) or with all the above ingredients(Baleadas con Todo). \\n\\nThere is one single fish item in the menu - spiced deep fried fish. Other than that they have items you will find in menu of any other latin cuisine like pastelitos, enchiladas, Fajitas, grilled chicken & steak and different types of soups(yes, they also have tripe soup). And other than soft drinks, they also serve variety of beers. \\n\\nTalking about soft drinks, they have horchata, pi√±a and Jamaica displayed right in front. So we know it's available. :)\\n\\nSo I arrived first and the manager/host seemed surprised when I said that we made reservation for 20. I guess, they never really thought we would show up. Then he frantically started making few phone calls and mentioned that his daughter would be here very soon!(I think she was our waitress) No harm done.\\n\\nThen we waited for someone to come give water. After about 20 mins, when the manager came to take drinks order, we asked if we could order food as well. But he wouldn't take food order, just kept repeating that he is only taking drinks order first. We then realized that the kitchen isn't fully ready for us yet. \\n\\nWhen they finally took out orders, it took about 50 mins before the food started coming out. \\n\\nI ordered,\\n1) baleadas with steak and eggs(I just asked for eggs but they brought one with steak and when I said mine was supposed to be eggs, the waitress just added some scrambled eggs to it). But the baleadas was good - the refried beans, steak and egg combination was delicious.\\n2) beef soup with carrots, potatoes and nice chunks of beef. It was flavorful and delicious. If I come back to this restaurant, I will definitely order this again. \\n\\nI really want to like this restaurant, they are low profile and my food was decent.

I didn't even want to touch my menu because it was sticky and had its own special smell to it. Then to top it off our waiter had a bad attitude- like we were taking up too much of his time and couldn't be bothered with us. We had to ask for utensils and ketchup when we ordered a hot dog plate for our kid. And to make it worse he took a way the latter before we were even done with it, but didn't take my empty plate away---huh?! After our meal I walked by the bar and the special funk was even stronger there and  trash was strewn around the floor that included paper AND food. Disgusting! The bathrooms were even worse and the floors were wet. The only  reason I'd probably come back is to play the games."},{"name":"Kings Dining & Entertainment","address":"50 Dalton St","city":"Boston","stars":"3","text":"Thank you King's!

The food and the service were uninspiring. I came on a Saturday night, easter weekend around 845. The place was about 50% full. It took probably 15 minutes before a waitress greeted us for our selection. We knew what we wanted and we ordered everything at once. Unfortunately they didn't have the shiraz we wanted. We didn't get our bread until we asked for it, we didn't get our wine until we asked for it. We waited a minimum 15 to maybe 20 minutes before asking. Perhaps that was too short. We were biased in thinking with restaurant only 50% full that service would've been more speedy. We were wrong. Our waitress was kind enough to bring a different red wine and not charge us for it. For that I commend her and the management. The food was indeed average, the tender filet tip was slightly chewy, the wild boar had a sweet chewy consistency, perhaps in line with how wild boar meat is supposed to be.

Having said that, the tofu I was delivered was \\"cakey\\" with a slight oaky flavor and did not mix well with the uncooked, crisp snap pea pods and stiff carrots.  Asian food is VERY important to vegetarians and tofu is widely available in Orlando so receiving a tofu based meal that tastes undercooked and oddly bland is not a good omen.  Please consider another tofu option and in the very least make sure the vegetables in vegetarian dishes are not raw.

But a disclaimer - both visits have been during the week, so crowding/noise was not an issue.\\n\\nGreat atmosphere - cool d√©cor, good size (not too big/small), and I like that the bar area is quite separate from the dining area. I thought the waitstaff did a good job - attentive and on top of the game, without being too overbearing.\\n\\nFirst visit was a bit odd - the owner walked around holding his daughter while talking to everyone, which I found strange. A lot of the dishes weren't cooked properly - underdone asparagus, slightly greasy fries, overdone quail egg.\\n\\nSecond visit was way better (keep in mind, i went around 5 on a Tuesday). Tomato soup is rich and perfectly portioned. House salad is excellent - they add flair with fried capers and a delicate vinagrette. For an entree I had the lamb burger, which was super tasty, the rosemary bun is excellent and the fries were cooked to perfection. My partner had salmon, which I didn't get to try - he liked it too much to share:) We ended with the flourless chocolate cake, which I would prefer to be a smaller size, but served with more ice cream (it's super rich!).\\n\\nOverall I dig 4580.

When the burgers finally came out my friends zucchini fries were very cold and both of our burgers were made wrong. They mixed up half of the toppings that were hers and put them on mine and vise versa. We ordered their specialty burgers too so it wasn't like they mixed up the build your own burgers. Normally I don't send food back but these were really bad. We asked for each burger to be remade and had to wait another 30\\nminutes for them. The new ones were made correctly but mine ordered medium was well done so it still wasn't that classic juiciness that I expect from graffiti. The server was very nice and apologized a lot, said there was a new cook. The manager did comp our burgers so that was nice that they tried to fix the problem hence why I give them two stars.

They have some nice wines there as well.  Give some of their wines a try.  The guy had a dessert wine sampler that he highly recommended.  We also order a bottle to split at the table actually I think it spanned into two bottles but I was trying not to count as I hit my limit at the second glass.\\n\\nI had the Potato Gnocchi which comes with pumpkin, leeks, and the in season chanterelles.  Very tasty and just the right amount of portion.  Not too much, so nothing to take home but not too little that you were eating off other people's plates.  Just right and tasty for someone like me who will eat a burger but generally is not a fan of most meats.\\n\\nThe rest of the gang tried a couple of desserts.

Still, I hadn't visited during my first year living in the neighborhood, most likely due to the appearance of long waits (the place is very small).\\n\\nIt turns out that the waits are really not that long - there just isn't much waiting space, so even one group waiting can make the place look overly packed.  Once I discovered this (and the delicious food), I've been happy to have Toast as my neighborhood breakfast joint.\\n\\nMy first visit was with Mindy C. (you can find her review here too), and she had more problems with the place than I did.  I generally don't have issues with service unless it's overtly rude or neglectful, and I've found that the Toast staff have always been attentive and friendly, albeit a little stressed with running a cramped and busy restaurant.\\n\\nIn general, a restaurant is a hit with me if I find myself fantasizing about one of their specialty dishes.  This was the case for me with the No Meat For You.  When I first tried it in the winter, this omelet was made with kale, onions, mushrooms, and ricotta cheese and quickly became one of my all-time favorite breakfast dishes.  The spring variant, with asparagus instead of kale and a different kind of cheese, isn't quite as good but still tastes amazing.  I haven't done much culinary exploration outside of this dish, 1.) because I'm vegetarian and there are fewer menu options and 2.) because I love it so much, but I'm assured by my friends that the other entrees are good too.\\n\\nSome drawbacks - the place is so small that it feels cramped and often noisy.  As my sister said during our last visit, it's hard to have a conversation when you can hear every word the people next to you are saying.  The place is terrible for large groups (ideal party size is two), and when said large groups are there it slows up the service for everybody else - the food wait was three times longer than usual the last time I was there due to the party of eight that had arrived before us.  Also, the food is expensive if you're used to chain restaurants for your breakfast or like to go out for breakfast every weekend.  And, If you're used to chain restaurants, you probably won't find your favorite breakfast combo here, although you will find creative dishes playing with similar ingredients.\\n\\nThat said, the smallness is part of Toast's charm as a neighborhood restaurant, and to that degree I like the intimacy of its atmosphere.  The slightly higher price makes sense in light of the restaurant's locally sourced, organic ingredients, and although I miss my winter No Meat For You, I love that they're trying to keep their dishes seasonal.  I also love the creative spin they've put on going out for breakfast, with complimentary mini scones and delicious juice blends.\\n\\nToast may not be the best breakfast joint in town, but as the one I'm the most likely to visit on a Saturday or Sunday morning, it absolutely fits the bill.  (I haven't tried their dinner yet, but I've seen menus for it and it looks equally promising.)"},{"name":"Tasty n Sons","address":"3808 N Williams Ave, Ste C, Hub Building","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"So I'm from out of town, was just trying to rely on yelp to try good stuff, know what I'm sayin?

After cutting off half of the bread the sandwich didn't taste bad, but as a person who I usually likes a fattier piece of meat I was not pleased when my sandwich had entire pieces of fat instead of meat filling a good portion of it. \\n\\nI was completely let down and grossed out when I watched what happened next. One of the young men who worked there brought back his dinner from chipotle and was eating it at the end of the bar.  One of the young ladies working was grabbing a few bites between tasks. We already were making jokes about her not washing her hands but it was no longer funny when we watched as the food was falling out of her mouth and she pushed it back in with her hand and Continued to serve people and make drinks.  I couldn't believe that she did not wash her hands once. \\n\\nI will not be going back."},{"name":"The Picnic House","address":"723 SW Salmon St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"The food here was solid, the atmosphere was interesting and fun, and the staff was friendly.

This was a bummer because we did really like it, but we've just never gone back because we don't really feel like sitting there.

The price was very reasonable 14.95.  \\nThe restaurant was very empty which was too bad as the atmosphere, music and service was great.

It's a quaint Mexican restaurant with an uncomplicated menu and easy on the pocket pricing.\\n\\nThere's no fusion here. Just home-made tasting meals with the right amount of watered-down spicing. But the dishes are surprisingly tasty from burritos, tacos, wraps (burritos without the beans) as well as plate and combo specials.\\n\\nService is good and fast. They bring your menu, take your order and remove your finished plates. It's really as simple and effective as that.\\n\\nSince the place is small, there is only just a few available tables and I think the most number of people they can squeeze in a rectangular table is a group of seven.  And that's already from the kitchen counter to the glass window. With that I advise to definitely go off-hours or early dinner or you can wait like we did for 30 or more minutes.\\n\\nMy favourite drink which I would love to strongly recommend, but may not be for everyone is the Horchata. In North America at least Horchata is synonymous with a rice-based ingredient combined with milk, sugar and spices the likes of cinnamon, nutmeg, vanilla and cocoa. The amount and strength depends on the maker, of course. This particular drink at Salsa and Agave has a good amount of sweetness and cinnamon spice. If you like both, then don't hesitate.\\n\\nThree stars because there's not much fanfare left once you've gone thru the whole shortlist.\\n\\nBut overall, a real nice effort to introduce Mexican food in Downtown Vancouver."},{"name":"The Manchester Arms","address":"1705 Virginia Ave","city":"College Park","stars":"4","text":"I walked over to this place from one of the hotels down the street in search of a casual atmosphere for a late lunch.

There are also combination plates advertised on the wall above the counter. The buffet is a steal at 5 bucks and change. This is by no means great Chinese food; however, I have to say it is fresh and properly seasoned. I was pleasantly surpised.\\n\\nThe 2-3 entree's I sampled  all tasted fresh and hot. Stuff does not seem to sit for too long. The fried rice looked sketch but was surprisingly good. Fried Shrimp were very good too; hot, fresh and especially great for those who do not want to eat Chinese food. There are also fried potatos for those who do not care fried rice. Egg rolls were substandard and they only have packets of fake / artificial Chinese Mustard. But I like the other offerings.\\n\\nThe employee's are friendly and personable.The staff will keep bringling out hot fresh provisions from the kitchen. There seems to be a brisk business from the area's blue collar workers.\\n\\nI was shockingly surprised to find the hot and sour soup to be quite good; 9 out of ten times low rent Chinese buffets muck it up. CC;s is well seasoned and chock full of fresh mushroom and tofu. Egg Fu Yung was done well also (although perhaps a bit on the greasy side). Stop here for a quick, flavorful, and really inexpensive lunch (though please note the sketch atmosphere will not suit everytones tastes). \\n\\nPerhaps the place deserves 3.5 stars (for sheer value alone); however, on this visit I will go with three."},{"name":"Highland Kitchen","address":"150 Highland Ave","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"I'm thrilled there is such a fabulous restaurant not immediately on a T stop.

What was odd was that it didn't stop there.\\nI ordered a fruit salad and noticed that the taller of the two blonde barkeeps went into the kitchen and spoke with the cook for about 2 minutes.

Then she asked me how it was and before I could finish saying anything she turned away with a scowl on her face. Then she and the other blonde barkeep started taking video or pictures of the bar with us in the frame. We turned away to avoid this but we didn't know how long they were shooting. Then the shorter blonde cuts me off as I'm approaching the bathroom (I've been through that so many times with women that don't like seeing us together just to get a rise out of me). Finally as we are cashing out the taller blonde asks my husband if we want separate checks. I'd seen this woman checking out our wedding rings several times. And from the posts of other people here it looks like they both my make a point of looking at women's wedding fingers.

There is a small wine list, a small bar, a reasonable selection of draft & bottled beers and a specials menu that is always worth checking out.\\n\\nThe decor is a bit spare, all stained concrete and modern light wood, but a pleasant chatter develops in the full restaurant and the overall effect is pleasing.  I was not at all bothered by the noise level some reviewers have mentioned, nor the lack of a host/hostess.  You could hit every table in the place from the door with a lightly tossed breadstick, so a host seems kind of superfluous.\\n\\nThe Insalata Caprese featured tasty dried tomato and fresh mozzarella and a flat bread that is like crack.  I opted for the beer-braised beef short ribs that were on special, and they did not disappoint.  They fell from the bone with a bare nudge of my fork, and melted into beefy beery goodness in my mouth.

I've passed this restaurant many times and thought nothing of it, but after trying the dumplings I knew I had to try the restaurant. I went with my boyfriend and we split the Gyoza appetizers (so good!), I had the pad Thai, and he had the tempura udon. I was so impressed with all the food. I'm normally not a big tempura fan (it's a little too rich for me) but after trying the tempura soaked in the udon broth, I would totally order that. The noodles in the udon soup were also really yummy and tasted so fresh. Since we ordered both Thai (pad Thai) and Japanese (gyoza, tempura udon) and both were amazing, I can vouch that they do both types of food really well.

I also loved my sandwich with duck ham which is not ham, but duck cured like ham. That alone was pretty cool! The duck and the combination with green tomato and blackberry jam was amazing. Both sandwiches came with a yummy potato salad on the side. Not the mayo kind, a tangy mustard kind.

Ordered the chix and waffles of course, which was battered just right and was huge.  You definitely get the bang for your buck here!  We also ordered a bucket full of ribs, more fried chicken, and biscuits.. that bucket was humongous!  We were a bit overwhelmed by it, considering we order about 7 small plates and 3 big plates, so we didn't finish it even though it was delicious.

The round table is filled with additions to your food such as capers, pickles, croutons, shredded cheese, siracha, oil, vinegar, etc. The skinny breadsticks aren't anything special. I thought the house salad with lemon vinagrette was above average. The tomato soup was good. One family member had a pepperoni pizza which he thought was OK but not great (sausage comes as little pellets). Another person had mac and cheese that was good, and enjoyed her Greek salad. The homemade cakes look yummy. I told one manager? that it's too bad all the children's menu items contain cheese since we have a dairy allergy child in the family. He assured me the cook would make something without cheese but too bad there isn't another dairy free item on the menu. Lots of bacon in menu items too.

The ice cream is rich and creamy, but I do not find it any better than places such as cold stone or other local ice cream shops.

It's got everything: the shoebox architecture of a converted used-to-be-something-else business, the dim lighting, the artwork (bonus points for the old-fashioned bicycle mural), the cozy seating, the open kitchen, the rock 'n roll soundtrack, the just-friendly-enough wait staff, the unique cocktail list, and the long lines for brunch. \\n\\nAnd especially, the excellent, locally-sourced, creatively prepared food. \\n\\nThough it seems the majority come here for brunch, my wife and I stopped by for dinner on a recent Friday evening. After a short wait made tolerable by alcohol (try the ginger lime rickey, which is refreshing with a snappy bite that'll grab your attention), we were told two \\"very tight\\" seats were available at the large communal table in front, and given the choice of sitting there or waiting for a private table. Seeing as how those were all squished together with patrons practically rubbing knees, we figured the communal seating was as good as any other. It WAS a bit of a squeeze to get in, but once seated, we were fine. Except, during the course of the meal, I dropped both my napkin and fork. Try retrieving those in close quarters with nary an extra inch of space! I felt like a contortionist. Fortunately, nobody gave me a second glance. \\n\\nThat turned out to be a good thing. Communal dining isn't for everyone. The table was large enough that, even though we were sharing space with a dozen other diners, it still felt strangely intimate at times. We exchanged pleasantries with our neighbors, and everybody ooh'd and ahh'd over everyone else's meals, but for the most part we were able to focus on each other. \\n\\nNot counting the complimentary salted nuts on the table, we began with Josh's Meats n Steve's Cheese toro bravo charcuterie, a diverse board that included an array of cured meats, cheeses, fruit, bread, and crackers. Best of all was the decadent venison pate and the house made dijon mustard/jam compote. A creamy, pungent blue cheese was reliably tasty, especially paired with the sliced apple. Nothing too weird on this board, like Interurban's head cheese or aspic coated meat, just a solid, straightforward selection of appetizers. \\n\\nChoosing an entree was tough, as there were probably half a dozen dishes on the menu I would have been thrilled with. I decided on the Cast Iron Cassoulet √† la Bouvier that came with grilled chicken, hot links, and pork belly, all swimming in a decadent (Olympic-sized) pool of creamy white beans. This classic French dish did not disappoint, and I came nowhere near close to finishing it. My wife ordered the pork chop with bacon jam, and quickly declared it the best pork chop she'd ever eaten. Thick, double-cut and juicy, the pork was tender, and the bacon jam was the perfect savory/sweet accompaniment, acting much like a chutney would EXCEPT THIS HAD BACON IN IT. Score! We also ordered, as side dishes, collard greens (tangy and irresistible) and a wild mushroom bread pudding that was also, be still my pig-lovin' heart, topped with bacon jam. Delicious. \\n\\nEven though we were bursting at the seams by then, we couldn't leave without trying the chocolate potato doughnuts I had heard so much about. Really oversized doughnut holes served on a plate with cr√®me anglaise, these might have been the highlight of the evening. Hot out of the fryer, they were crispy on the outside, moist and chewy in the middle. The way the flavors and textures melded together, complementing one another with each bite, was amazing. First you got a starchy, chewy bite of the doughnut, then the crisp outer edge, perfectly seasoned with cinnamon and sugar for a much-needed injection of sweetness, followed by the milky creme on the bottom of the plate. Oh, man. Now I'm drooling. \\n\\nIt's a rare restaurant that earns 5 stars from me, but Tasty 'n Sons is a notable exception. If not for the cramped seating, I might have given it 6.

The lunches usually include the salad bar and garlic knots, which I also take more than my fair share of. They are not great at refilling the salad bar, so arrive early for lunch. The lasagna here is terrific, made fresh and brought out steaming. Calzones and sandwiches meet all the expectations of a traditional pizza shop.

The interior is the classic cheap seats pizzeria style, with the required real pizza oven at the center of the action.

The online menu looks much more boring.  I ordered a dish that was basically a chicken enchilada and a steak taco. It wasn't too bad, the rice and beans were the best part. My wife had the pork with a cheese quesadilla and poblano mac and cheese. That mac and cheese was excellent, the best thing we ordered.\\n\\nOverall I was happy.

My friend had been to Beast once before, and had an amazing experience; however, he agreed that this night's dinner was definitely lacking in quality.  So here was the menu:\\n\\nZucchini & Basil Soup w/ Lemon Oil - I was so unimpressed with the soup. Firstly, it came out only luke-warm, and secondly, I think there was too much lemon oil and couldn't even taste the zucchini in the soup. I wish I could have returned it.\\n\\nCharcuterie Plate - The chicken liver mousse on the leaf lard cracker was definitely my favourite. The steak tartare with quail egg on toast was pretty good, too. I did not care for the pine-tip cured sockeye salmon or the pigs head terrine lemon zest with sherry and parsley.  The foie-gras bon-bon was also disappointing.... it was so sweet that you couldn't taste any foie gras flavour. What a shame, and a waste of foie gras. \\n\\nGlazed Pork Belly on Bread w/ Pickled Green Strawberries - I cook pork belly myself, and thought this particular dish wasn't executed well at all. The pork belly was a bit tough, but should have been very tender.  I was wholly disappointed here.  The flavour of the sauce; however, was flawless.

Our waitress seemed not up to the task of balancing so many tables on a busy Sunday morning.  She was friendly but not consistently helpful.

Even the waitress agreed that the pizza is normally just cheese, tomatoes and sausage.  Thankfully they took it back and recreated what should have come the first time.

Whether your sitting inside by the windowed walls that completely open up in the summer to give you that outdoor breeze, or at the bar to watch the sushi chef work his magic while you sip on sake and wonder how the hell he gets those rolls so tight, or just sipping on sake in general - there is nothing I don't love about this place.

And I suppose I could have requested no dairy, but I don't really see the point is spending $25+ on an entree if I'm going to remove the most delicious part of it.\\n\\nI suspect I also enjoy lower class plating.  I would have preferred a bed of mashed potatoes instead of a sprinkling of roasted baby potatoes.  I like to feel as though I will not run out of any ingredient on my plate.  You know, a puddle of sauce instead of a drizzle. Or a gravy boat is even better.\\n\\nThe pork terrine I ordered was decent.  Neither notable or outstanding, I finished half of it before I ran out of potatoes, brussels, mustard mousse, and red pepper puree.\\n\\nPerhaps I was supposed to be forking gigantic mouthfuls of pork terrine into my maw and taking teeny little dabs and nibbles of everything else, but I feel like then the whole meal would have just tasted like pork grease.\\n\\nI think we are just not meant to be.\\n\\nI've also not experienced a place where you have to pay for your bread then pay for butter.

I also tried the arancini, which normally is $9 but on that particular night, only $5! I enjoyed them, but found the romesco sauce that accompanied them to be a bit off.

The conversation with other diners was very interesting, so no issues. The spinach soup was a great starter, the charcutiere plate was six types pate/foie/rillette (the steak tartare was the only real miss) but I thought it could had used something a little more firm (salumi?) for texture balance. I thought the next four courses (steak, salad, cheese, brownie) were very good but lacked any outstanding attributes except for the sauce with the steak which was fantastic. It was also a little odd to have the salad after the steak as a little break from the meat (charcutiere) would have been nice. The palate cleanser after the steak was quince, elderflower liquore, and grapefruit, and was quite bracing in its cleansing.\\n\\nThe wine paring was excellent with all the courses however it leads to my only real complaint: It would have been nice to see more local/OR selections in the cheese plate (France and Quebec were two of the three) and on the wine/beer list (one lone pinot) or wine paring (all EU wines).

So last Friday I went with my potential financial adviser.  I suggested the place and he made us a reservation for 12pm.  We showed up and they had the reservation but it wasn't too crowded so we probably would have been fine without one. We got a great seat by the window.  I figured this place would be good for a business meeting because it's quieter than a lot of the downtown lunch spots and we had room to spread out the papers.  There's a radiator like thing by the window so it gave us more room.\\n\\nI ordered the home made veggie burger. The burger can be vegan so long as you leave off cheese and the aioli.  I like that they have a home made veggie burger instead of the typical frozen vegetarian patties that you get at most places.  Because it's home made and vegan it doesn't stick together that well and does fall apart eventually but it was still good!  It does have room for improvement but the flavor is very good! And it's home made and vegan so yum! The bun was a little glossy - like perhaps egg washed so ask about that if you care.\\n\\nThe veggie burger came with fries and a side salad.  I asked to exchange the fries for a side veggie like brussel sprouts but they said no. =(   They said they could do a large salad instead but I opted for the regular version of 1/2 salad 1/2 fries.  It was plenty of food and I actually only ate about 1/2 my fries. The burger comes with 2 tomatoes but no lettuce so you have to use your salad for the lettuce if you want it on your burger. Kind of wish they had given me more greens.  \\n\\nMy potential financial adviser got a fish dish over spinach. It looked very healthy and low fat (well besides the olive oil all of it).  He didn't' finish his spinach and I wanted to scold him for his bad eating habits but didn't feel like we were at that point in our professional relationship yet. =)\\n\\nI got a diet coke and he got ice tea; the diet coke tasted a little odd but nothing to mention.\\n\\nThe service was good and the prices were reasonable.  They also offer other salads and side dishes that can be made vegan (like the brussel sprouts which even has the word vegan by them).  It looks like  they don't serve foie gras anymore which makes me really happy; good thing because it's really cruel and makes me sad.  It's always a catch -22 when you go to these french influenced restaurants that have great vegan options but then serve foie gras! It's unfortunate because I can't get my vegan friends to come with me since most boycott restaurants that serve foie gras. But now that it's off the menu I may be able to get them to come (though I wonder about the pate...)\\n\\nHowever the service could have been a little better. A restaurant like this I would expect that extra touch.  You know like since I asked for no dairy on my burger the waiter maybe could have connected the dots and offered me olive oil with the complimentary baguette instead of butter.  Or offered me a different sauce with my veggie burger since I declined the aioli.  \\n\\nWe ended the meal with hot tea for both of us.\\n\\nIt was a good experience and my professional date enjoyed it as well.  I think he was pleased with everything, which was  good thing since he paid for it! \\n\\nI've been getting their emails a lot lately.

Honestly, I wasn't all that impressed with the pretzel.  It was boring and the expensive beer cheese wasn't all that good.  Beer cheese is a bit of a  specialty in Louisville where I'm from(as in everyone knows someone with a secret recipe for it), and this stuff is just okay, but not great.\\n\\nHowever, the atmosphere was perfect, the service was perfect, and you made me look like super genius location selector to my friends.

The seafood pasta had good seafood but the homemade pasta wasn't good at all. To add fuel to the fire we didn't get any bread of salad like anyone else has and no refills on the water.

Since we're not opposed to chatting up the bar neighbors and the bartender, we decided to stay.\\n\\nFood:\\n1.  Blistered Shishito Peppers - this was by far our favorite item.  The char on the peppers was perfectly done and made the flavor of the pepper jump out.  And the cheese/vinegar accompaniment is just perfect.  Highest recommendation on this item!\\n2.  Flatbread Oxtail Pizza - very tasty, but not outstanding.  The oxtail was cooked well, tender and flavorful, but the mushrooms did not add much and had a disappointing texture.  Overall still very good.\\n3.  Tsukune meatballs - these were good, but the menu is a bit misleading.  Traditional tsukune are usually grilled, but these are battered and deep fried.  Since my girlfriend is a purist when it comes to Japanese food, she was disappointed.  For my part, they were flavorful and well spiced, but I was not really in the mood for something fried.\\n\\nDrinks:\\nI can't remember the names of the cocktails we ordered, but we love to experience the custom cocktail creations around town, so we ordered several of the specials (between the two of us) and they were all outstanding.  The cucumber cocktail (apologies for the non-specific reference) was our favorite.  The bar was super-busy, even for a Wednesday, so don't expect to sit down and have a hand-crafted cocktail in your hand within 60 seconds.  Have some patience while your bartender works and it will be worth the wait.\\n\\nService:\\n\\nThe bartender who helped us was inviting and friendly, very helpful with explaining menu items and never seemed impatient with our incessant questions - even on such a busy night.  He also asked for our genuine feedback on the food and drinks and when we expressed our surprise about the fried tsukune, he apologized sincerely and bought us a dessert.

Lots of filling sandwiches and meals in the $8 - $13 range."},{"name":"Pizza Days","address":"111 Brighton Ave","city":"Allston","stars":"2","text":"I hate giving a poor review, but I was pretty unimpressed with this place. I only went because I bought a Google deal ($4 for $8 worth of pizza). I think the pizza has potential, and it's great that they've put the effort into having an online presence, but I never saw an update for the order - it only counts the minutes since you put your order in. So I finally got there, and the 7\\" pizza was about the size of a microwaveable one (just for reference), and equally bland. The chicken was incredibly dry, and they don't have a warming tray, so by the time I got home, it was very cold. If you have the option to go elsewhere, I'd do so.\\n\\nAlso, I made the mistake of picking up the order, forgetting that this is one of the worst areas for parking, so I'd suggest coughing up the extra $2 for delivery if you hate driving in circles and risking tickets!"},{"name":"Dime Store","address":"837 SW 11th Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"3.5","text":"The service was great here.

We didn't come for the hotpot, but it looked pretty popular. The setup is good for groups; I think there is also a room towards the back for a large party to reserve. The menu is rather large, which makes me feel like they are spreading themselves too broad and should focus more on quality rather than quantity, but none of the dishes that we had were bad. My favorite was the double-cooked pork (a little bit on the spicy side, but it almost felt like bacon), but the dim sum dishes (xiao long bao and shumai) were a bit disappointing (maybe they were frozen? Not sure, but the soup dumplings were definitely lacking in flavor for the broth). However, we also didn't get to try most of the dim sum dishes since we went on a Wednesday and they offer the full dim sum menu on weekends only, so we might go back and check that out.

A wonderful accident. \\n\\nYes, I know you know it. Yes, Pok Pok super-Chef, and yes, GQ, and yes, even though I read restaurant reviews religiously and sometimes buy a GQ I still didn't know about Ping. But hey, don't discount just being in an area and walking by a place and taking a gander at their menu and knowing that you MUST grab some of that.\\n\\nHere's how it happened: 1) I was in the area (24-Hour Church of Elvis), 2) although I had a box full o' Voodoo Donuts I didn't want that for dinner, and 3) I had some blisters the size of quarters on my heels and couldn't walk anymore and Ping was across the street from the parking lot and the outside looked intriguing and the menu looked inviting.\\n\\nMy dining companion had filled up on sushi earlier and eaten about three donuts but I was still feeling a bit hungry so we wandered around and were about to leave Chinatown for something else when I glanced over at the little corner place right by the parking lot, checked the menu, and said, \\"Here.\\"\\n\\nWe really enjoyed the feel of the place with its distressed (burned, old) wood on one wall and the vintage-bordering-on-kitsch tchotchkes and the intimate yet not crowded space. The servers and hosts are dressed in Goodwill-paired-with-Prada chic and will not steer you wrong. Have questions? Feel free to say it's your first time there and what shouldn't you miss. They did not point me to the most expensive dishes, which wouldn't set you back much since this is a small plates/Asian tapas-ish kind of place but still, and instead asked my what sort of flavor profiles I liked.\\n\\nEach table has a \\"foomp\\"-top (the kind you pop up with your thumbs) carafe of tap water as a standard so that you may serve yourself, but I started with a salted lemon gin drink (gorgeous to look at, better to drink) along with some spicy peanuts (lime leaf, chilies, garlic, and sea salt) that were addictive if missing the lime leaf flavor a bit. That went directly to the steamed pork bun that was also gorgeous to look at but the dried pork was a little too little inside the overly large bun. The pork and spices were overpowered by the bun. \\n\\nIn very short order (at that point it wasn't busy so I can sort of understand getting things out quickly) our shared order of roasted potato skewers (skewers are two, minimum) arrived and they were lovely. Four quarters of red potato per skewer with a drizzle of spicy mayo. Delish. \\n\\nOur server asked if we liked spicy and with an affirmative on our part she recommended the baby octopus skewers. Ping-O! Beautiful. Oh so beautiful. And spicy but so worth it. Perfectly grilled, just turning to that not-quite-burned color and toothsome without being chewy. Yum.\\n\\nAt this point I am getting to the end of my hunger and my friend is sated from his earlier dinner(s) and potatoes but I have one dish left and that? Woo! Out of this world. We are talking about the \\"tea smoked magret duck breast with szechuan pepper salt.\\" Let me pause for a moment, won't you? I am not, not at all, not by any means, a duck fan. I find it too, you know, too everything. Too rich, too gamy, too fatty, too expensive, too too, but this was amazing. The breast was sliced into perfectly even pieces. The color was a, well, meaty reddish-brown with a perfect layer of creamy fat that didn't overpower the spices or meat and wasn't in the least bit gamy. The serving temperature was so exact that the flavors were only enhanced by the dipping salt that melted a tiny bit, so long as you didn't bathe the slices in it.\\n\\nSo, yeah, I guess you could say that Ping was worth it for us. Can't speak as a professional reviewer who has eaten everything on the menu but the few things we had would make us show up again if we're ever in the area again. \\n\\nGo for it.

I don't suggest it unless you enjoy chicken livers with a different more chewy like calamari texture. Very different, but whatever floats your boat) I gave it a second try, my boyfriend and I. We ate at the bar, and the bartender was super friendly and nice. He helped suggest great beers to pair well with our taco choices, and this time I tried the bacon taco.... Which I can honestly say I live for this taco. It's so scrumptiously delicious especially on a corn tortilla. Omg. I dream about it. So much so, that before we moved to Atlanta, we lived about 3 hours away and my boyfriend had to make a business trip here. He ended up eating at holy taco, and knew he would be cruising for a bruising seeing as though I couldn't join him. I've got the sweetest guy who ordered me a bacon taco to go and drove it 3 hours just for me to eat it. And yes it was still pretty epically amazing. I highly suggest this place, the best food, the best beer selection and their specialty drinks are pretty delicious!!!"},{"name":"4 Rivers Smokehouse","address":"11764 University Blvd","city":"Orlando","stars":"4","text":"I'm from Texas, and I've been on the search for real barbecue.  4 Rivers is as close to Texas as it gets in Orlando.

Make no mistake- a trip to Rino's is best approached as an experience.  Even if you arrive early, you should expect to spend on the order of 4 hours or more at the bar.  Personally, I had no problem with this.  It gave us ample time to relax, sample some yummy appetizers, and drink giant, cheap Peroni's ad nauseum.  When it was finally our turn, we stumbled across the street in a happy boozy haze and sat down to one of the most fantastic meals of our lives- lobster ravioli, veal scallopini, fruite de mare... all amazingly fresh, huge portions, and perfectly cooked.  We haven't stopped talking about the meal since, and although we left belt-poppingly full, the whole meal came out to just above $100.

Winsor will do it if you're in a bind and can't find any other dim sum place, but I'm sure Boston has got to have at least one better one out there.\\n\\nOne thing I couldn't decide if I liked or not was their paper system of ordering, as opposed to them pushing the carts around.

The first was that the Patatas Bravas was not very flavourful when we got it - they were busy and might have not taste-tested the sauce very well because it could have used more paprika and salt. This was not too big of a deal for us, not enough to stop coming at least. The second misfire was a grave one for me. \\n\\nI found a hair in my polenta.\\n\\nBeing a germaphobe I almost threw up. The waiter apologised and took the plate away, and offered to replace it for me. I was very hesistant and we were both done with brunch by that time already but I took him up on the offer anyway. They cancelled the charge on our bill, but I felt that my dining experience was already compromised. \\n\\nP/S: They keep marketing their novel concept of a shared dining experience to diners (\\"Oh we encourage everyone to share their food here as part of our unique shared-dining experience!\\") but I'd like to remind readers that in most of the world outside America, this is merely called regular DINING. It's really not that novel of a concept. Try not to make a big deal out of it, as you might not realise how you're insulting other customers who have this 'unique experience' as part of how they were raised. \\n\\nOk I'm getting off my little soapbox now."},{"name":"Eat Me Speak Me","address":"340 Church St","city":"Decatur","stars":"4.5","text":"Fun visit over to Decatur to a vacation feeling little spot we found on Yelp that made us feel like we were in the French Polynesia !

Thanks for Watching.\\n\\nIt was a stunning shock to the Boston Yelp Community when the restaurant called IVY abruptly closed its doors last October. Situated at 49 Temple Place in Downtown crossing and well known for an inexpensive \\"small plate\\" menu, IVY appeared on the surface to be doing fine. However, a Special 60 Minutes investigation shows all was not fine at IVY's. Many Yelpers reported questionable service issues ranging from rudeness to frequently mistaken orders.  Then in March 2010 one yelper wrote of becoming ill after eating here (although that may have been more a reaction to her company for the evening) Consequently on October of 2010 IVY suddenly ceased all operations, leaving a vacant store front and many unanswered questions in its wake.\\n\\nBut here is where the story takes a sudden turn for the better. On Tuesday May 24th A new fine dining restaurant, under new management and the new name of 49 Social has opened in its place.  Featuring New American cuisine with a distinct international influence, as well as a wide selection of wines and creative cocktails, the new fine dining restaurant is owned by Talal Zaiter and managed by his nephew, Samir Zaiter , both experienced  players in the Boston Restaurant scene. Rounding out the crack management team is bar manager Kimberly Frankson (a 5 year veteran of Radius) and top Boston chef Michael Lishchynsky.  Officially opening to the public on Thursday, patrons were universally awed by the renovation work done by the Zaiter's. \\"It a nice space.\\" Zamir  commented modestly. In fact what was already an elegant \\"space\\" has been up graded considerably to now featuring 3 floors, two bars, museum quality Chandeliers, and ornate detailing at every turn. When asked about Service issues in the old IVY, Samir firmly commented \\"I am not going to put up with that!\\"\\n\\nAs per the food served: Most patrons seemed Greatly impressed by the generous portions bought with an average of $15-$50 per person (full menu below) And everyone seemed to like the drinks.\\n\\nThe future on 49 Social remains to be seen.

You can choose from various noodle types, broth, veggies, meats, etc. to make your own meal. This makes it great tasting for you, but it probably doesn't make it fast. Also, we were seated right away, but it took a while to get the attention of our waitperson to take our order. This could have been an isolated issue because all other personnel were very responsive.

I love the food!  It is fresh, plentiful, and delightful.  However, I had a similar experience to some of the other reviewers.  My husband and I arrived around 6 pm on a Monday night.  There were 3 tables for 2 that were open.  There were 3 parties ahead of me, which had 3 in the party.   As you can imagine, I was fairly excited.   I asked the hostess how long the wait would be, and she said, not long, only a few minutes.  In my mind, that meant about 15.  I went to the bar across the street, and waited....for 2.5 hours.  The entire time, the bartender kept asking if we wanted another drink.  We would hesitate for 20-25 minutes, assuming we'd be called at any moment...nope...then we ordered 1 drink to share.  This continued for the 2.5 hours.  People around us who had never been to Rino's asked us if this was common.  I told them to expect to wait about an hour.  Several of the groups in the bar around us left, as they too were told it would be a short wait, and they were now very long in to their unexpected stay at the bar.\\n\\nWhen we were finally called for our table, one of the original empty tables was still empty.  I asked if the kitchen was short on workers that evening, and the waitress said no.  The dining room was definitely not filled at 100% when we sat down, nor when we left.  Not sure what the deal was.\\n\\nI don't mind waiting IF I know there will be a wait.  Then it is my choice to stay or not. Being told a few minutes, and then waiting 2.5 hours is ridiculous.  It's insulting.  \\n\\nI live in a 220 unit condo building in Boston.  Recently similar comments about Rino's were posted on the internal blog.   I hope Rino's considers their policy and the impact on their customers as they are starting to create waves of unhappiness in the local community.\\n\\nAgain, the food is fabulous.

I have been coming to this location for 6 years now. I work across the street from Cinco and the reason I always come back is because of the awesome staff. I'm a rooftop diner/drinker and I will say that Cinco has one of the best if not the best rooftops in Atlanta. I've see it change over the years for the better but I still desire a little more, especially considering there is now more favorable competition from the newly opened Braves Stadium (The Battery). \\n\\nI understand that Cinco don't want to be associated as a sports bar but the best way to address competition is to adapt to the competition. Especially if you already have TV's that play sports plastered throughout your facility. There is so little that needs to be done to make the rooftop, which is where all the money is mainly generated from, the highlight of the restaurant. Downstairs is already perfect so I'll focus on my spot which is ALWAYS the roof. \\n\\nAs a long time patron I was ecstatic when they upgraded the rooftop with paint, sliding windows and a roof extension. This means my favorite spot can be enjoyed year round! I will say that I wish they would at the very least finish upgrading and fixing some of the equipment on the rooftop. This includes newer TV's, better frozen machines, fixing the fans that are not working.  These little changes would go a long way in keeping customers engaged, comfortable and entertained. It's hard to watch the staff who are the best in the business struggle to do something as simple as make a frozen margarita because the machine is constantly broken. It's not their fault they are only working with the tools they are given. Cinco management please help make your staff truly efficient by fixing these items on the rooftop. \\n\\nOne last thing please bring back the DJ. It's great to have live music during the week but to be honest I don't really want to hear cover bands when trying to unwind on a Friday or Saturday evening with friends. The DJ was one of the best ideas for rooftop entertainment when implemented. Nobody was out of control, no fights, no nonsense. Everybody would be drinking, singing and bobbing their heads to the wonderful music that was coming out of those speakers. I purposely would invite a group of friends to come out on the nights a DJ was present. We always had a great time and would close out the bar on those nights. Something I have not done since. BRING THE DJs BACK!\\n\\nSo in closing, this is still my favorite place to hang out, have a good and drinks, speak with the regulars and new faces.

It doesn't really matter, I don't think any one seat is better than another at a communal table and it's really not the restaurant's fault if you sit to someone annoying.  It takes a while to get beverage service going for 26 people with only two servers, but once the ball got rolling dinner was good.  First course: Cream of Fennel Soup with Salmon Roe.  Second: Charcuterie with a foie-gras bon-bon and sauternes gelee that was out of this world, also chicken liver mousse, head cheese terrine, steak tartare with quail egg and pork rillettes, all of which I rarely enjoy, but this was fantastic.  The main course was definitely the most memorable: Cognac brined pork with house made sauerkraut, and a duck and veal demi.  WOW.  There was no need for a knife, it was so tender.  I would have licked the plate if I weren't in public.  The salad course was arugula and radicchio salad, a little bitter, it was ok .  Fifth course:  Cheese plate with some REALLY neat cheeses, one of which was almost the exact smell/taste of stinky feet, but I liked it :-)  Dessert was an Apple Tart with creme fraiche ice cream.  I enjoyed the wine pairing very much with the first and second course, but the rest were disappointing.  The third wine fell incredible flat, especially when paired with such a rich succulent pork dish.  The dessert wine was good.  I did not enjoy the pace of the meal.  After two hours of sitting around I started to get anxious and tired.  The whole thing lasted about 2.5 hours.

After passing by for over 2+ yrs I've debated on stopping in but assumed it was just another over priced low quality winter park restaurant. \\n\\nI thought today was a new day. I got off after working a 12 hr shift and had the biggest craving for chicken and waffles. I figured what better way to feed that craving than with something new that seemed to have high standards. \\n\\nWe arrived at 10:35, just 5 minutes after opening, and we were the second table to be seated for the day. We reviewed the menu even though I already knew what I wanted, so we placed the order for chicken and waffles and the biscuits and gravy. We intended on eating the biscuits as an app since it's considered a \\"snack\\" then moving on to the fried chicken. Well that didn't work out. Everything came out together so you had to try and eat the biscuits quickly so the other food didn't get cold. \\n\\nThe biscuits and gravy consist of 6 micro biscuits with a bowl of gravy and pepper Jam. We weren't too crazy about the pepper jam so that was pushed to the side. The biscuits were pretty tasty for what little I could enjoy them since we were kind of rushing so the chicken didn't get cold. The gravy was ok and had very minimal sausage. \\n\\nAt this point we have yet to see what the hype was about but we still had the star of the show to eat. The amazing Nashville chicken and waffles. At first glance you notice 2 very small chicken thighs on top of thick fluffy waffles. \\n\\nI just knew this was gonna resolve any doubts I may have had. As I start to dig in I notice the chicken is almost room temperature at this point but I was hungry and didn't care. I take my first but and you get the good spice from the chicken; but then your hit with a very dense and overly dry waffle. It was nothing Like it looked. Not soft or fluffy, just dry to the point where you have to wash every bite down with a drink. \\n\\nI stopped our server and asked if this was normal and expressed my dissatisfaction. He responded yes because they add corn and walked away. After waiting with no return I asked someone to send the waiter back over so I could again express my dissatisfaction and stated that I did not want that dish because we couldn't get it down. At that point he took it to the back where the manager and kitchen staff tasted the waffles. The manager came over and agreed it was very dense and dry and apologized. She stated it changes often and this may have been a bad round. At that point she asked if we wanted anything else and I expressed my desire for the Nashville chicken. After a few minutes of talking the outcome was if I didn't want the waffles i couldn't have chicken.  So I was forced eat something I didn't want or leave starving. At this point an hour had gone by and all we had was a snack of biscuits, and no option for chicken. \\n\\nWe decided it was best to leave since we couldn't have the main item we went for. I'm confused how ordering just the chicken was a problem, but considering the manager noticed to waffle issue and didn't care much to resolve it i could only take it as my business wasn't valued by them. It's sad to see this was the outcome because with the lack of resolution and satisfaction I can't see myself going back. I wanted to love cask and larder but they just wouldn't allow that to happen.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nAfter leaving a social media review for this company , the resolution they took was to block me.

The others had a whole bunch of different sushi. The vegetable tempura on my plate was pretty good. I liked the variety that they've used. I was disappointed at the shrimps though, there were 5 pieces of them, and they were all a bit soggy, and more importantly, the shrimps were anorexic, or bullimic, i can't tell, all i know is they must be from Hollywood, as skinny as they were, I was still very hungry for shrimp tempura after dinner was over. I tried a bite of the sushi that was on our table as well,  it was the salmon. It defintiely tasted like it was farmed, it was VERY fishy. Salmon sashimi should NEVER taste fishy, ever at all.

We are a hard group of girls to work with, lots of requests, girls arguing at the table, some didn't understand the style of service, and the staff was very patient with us which is much appreciated.

Since the style of service was family, meaning we all order stuff and share, we tried to all pick something different from one another. \\nThe big highlight for me was the Pork Chop with the plum was fantastic. Big cut of meat, tender and flavorful. The Bouillabaisse was one of the best things I have ever tasted in my life! Full of seafood, huge flavor, dripping crostini cheesy garlic bread into the soup, absolutely mouth watering!! The Linguini and Ragu Mascarpone was great as well. John's Meat & Steve's Cheese was good, could have had a little more spunk/creativity, maybe a more interesting spread or compote to pair with the cheese, but overall a good dish. The Bacon Wrapped Dates were fantastic. I could eat them all day. The Steak Frites came out perfectly cooked and was another great item that we had. And I will finish this review with the Maize Loco. If you've ever hung out with Hispanic neighborhood and seen the guys with the carts making corn with mayo, cojita cheese and tapatio, this is exactly what Tasty n Sons is imitating and they scored big!

It was a little loud when we walked in with the live music, so it was a little jarring considering I had a small hangover headache and was looking for some hair of the dog.

But the food came out of the kitchen pretty quickly.\\n\\nFor drinks, I started with the bloody mary and the wife had the \\"biggie\\" mimosa.  Neither of us were too thrilled with our selections . Firstly, the mary had waaaaaaaaay too much cracked pepper, I was picking large bits of peppercorn out of my mouth with every swig (and even some whole uncracked corns) and wound up with a pretty massive pile of it on my napkin by the time I finished the drink.  The \\"biggie\\" mimosa is mostly triple sec and orange juice in a pint glass with ice and a splash of sparkling wine, not what my wife thought she would get (she was hoping for a real mimosa, just a lot of it served in a large glass).\\n\\nSecond round of cocktails was a regular mimosa for the wife and an airmail for me (rum, honey, lime, sparkling wine) and we were both pleased with those.\\n\\nSo the reason for the 4 stars is really because of amazing food.

I then had the Dirty Bird which was outstanding, if not a heart attack on a plate - fried chicken biscuit sandwich topped with bacon, a fried egg, and smothered in sausage gravy.

Being an insatiably curious individual, I find myself contemplating things of questionable merit, and difficult to quantify in all events, most of the time. To wit: I wonder constantly if it is on the whole a \\"Good Thing\\" that we graduate 10s of thousands of Law School students, most of them deeply in debt, and a good many of them w/political axes to grind, each and every year. Can this POSSIBLY translate to anything good for the greater society? Also I wonder: What happens to all the students who start as well as manage to finish those ambitious and very expensive culinary schools so heavily advertised on such award-winning daytime tv as \\"Cheaters\\".... where in the world do they all go? Not even a tiny fraction can go on to be \\"Chef to the stars\\" or work those lavish tour cruise liners. What about the other 99% of them, including the ones that might have \\"not quite finished\\" their course of studies? I'll tell you right now: no small number of 'em wind up here as productive members of the ever-growing Portland grub-o-sphere....\\n\\n\\nIf this seems like a \\"left-handed compliment\\" it truly is not meant to be; there's so much high grade, highly individualized grub available to us these days! Believe it, I chat a lot of these restaurant and food cart folks up! They have stories and are usually bursting at the seams to share them. You might be surprised at how many of these entrepeneurs learned their trade from the likes of Cordon Bleu. That brings us in a decidedly round- about fashion to Tasty 'n' Sons...\\n\\n\\nFor a 4 star review, I have decidedly mixed feelings about Tasty 'n' Sons. I share the sentiments of those Yelp reviewers previously expressed, incl. Aaron W., about portion size vs. price. My baby back rib plate was $19 for about 8 small ribs and about 6 small potato wedges. I also agree that  it is really lame that they refuse to offer carry-out. Some of us work non-banker hours, and it is very difficult to make it there during their limited operational hours. I realize some dishes don't keep very well, but offering take-out could only grow your business. Why would  you ever look down your nose at this possibility? there are three LARGE hospitals very nearby Tasty's, chock full of swing and grave shift workers.... if you could successfully tap into that market, ,show 'em what Tasty's is all about, you'd be thinking about franchising in no time....\\n\\n\\nAs for the actual fare of Tasty 'n' sons: they have some of the BEST collard greens I have ever had, a surprisingly LARGE bowl full, chock w/succulent chunks of bacon! I've had greens all over in the country, and I can only think of 2 or 3 others that can even hang in the same territory as Tasty's. A great value for the price, but unfortunately, that was the exception to the rule, in my experience @ Tasty 'n' son. Then there were the baby back ribs..... unbelievably tender. A half-heartedly harsh look from  you is all it takes to make the meat fall off the bone. That is a true indication of SKILLED cooking! However, I'm a spoiled brat when it comes to the 'cue, and I want smokiness, I demand heat, I need my pork ribs to reverberate their awesome-ness in my mind and in my soul, long after the plate's been cleaned. On technical execution and again, getting the ribs moist and tender to perfection, they score a slam dunk. But the Soul factor is very painfully lacking, and missed........\\n\\n\\nA final word about the service: it was 10 star quality. I never got my server's name, but she was unbelievably nice, attentive, and pours some wicked strong drinks (try out their Lion's tail, or the Tom 'n' Jerry). People are so quick to judge and to blast service when it's mediocre or worse; how many are as quick to sing praises when it is due? Looking around the bar at a busy lunch rush, I saw all the server staff just totally on their game, keeping folks happy, gettin' the dang thing DONE. Thank  you Tasty 'n' Sons for making it so easy to still rate you very highly, despite any misgivings!  From everything I experienced,  you were worth the hype.\\n\\n\\nps: I'm still not sure if so many lawyers stacking up, year after year after year, is such a great thing. And yes, I did, in a round-a-bout way, admit to watching the occasional episode of 'Cheaters'. Guilty pleasures, baby.

I had to pretend to leave by heading towards my vehicle for the bartender to yell \\"Are you going to pay your tab\\" so I replied \\"yeah if you give it to me I asked for it over an hour ago and you are all screwing around not doing your job\\" That's when she said\\"You don't leave tips\\". I had only visited there once before as a paying customer for breakfast on my birthday by myself and I left a tip. A few nights before my last visit I had gone up there with a friend who was buying pitchers. At the time I had absolutely no money I was just hanging out with my buddy. I felt bad when the person I was with couldn't leave a tip so I decided to come back up when I got paid to reimburse the waitress. That evening she was there and not attentive to me but was to others and was friendly to everyone except me. After I left I called the manager and he was just as rude to me. He proceeded to inform me that my check was left in a mason jar but nobody ever let me know that. I have never been to any bar or restaurant where that practice is customary. Having a manager making excuses for the behaviour of their employees is very unprofessional and irresponsible. Maybe the inside staff is better than at the bar but the whole experience has soured my opinion about their business"},{"name":"Taste Select Wines","address":"202 W Cesar Chavez St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Went on Sunday night (my girlfriend and I celebrated Valentine's Day post-marathon!) and enjoyed ourselves immensely. Spent about 30 minutes sampling wines prior to dinner; I must admit although I do enjoy drinking wines I don't know much about them except what I like! The choices they offered were amazing but it would have been helpful to have a little synopsis about each wine under the bottle; it's almost a little like Russian roulette and I would have enjoyed reading a little about each wine prior to drinking it. Also, if I'm about to pay $8 for a taste I would like a little read on it! I know that they have folks who work there who are \\"experts\\" but not much to offer us on Sunday evening. \\n\\nThe dinners we had were great! My girlfriend and I split an appetizer of sweetbreads; she had the chicken sandwich and I the pork skirt for dinner. The sweetbreads were fried and were complemented by cheese grits (not your regular cheese grits!!); I forgot to ask what kind of cheese they used in the grits but they were delicious. Not a big fan of soggy sweetbreads and these were fried, crispy and the crust held the sweetbreads together just right. The chicken sandwich was large and accompanied by a salad of spinach with a homemade vinaigrette; both very tasty. The pork skirt was grilled to a medium and served on a bed of risotto and sweet caramelized (?) onions with spinach. The sweetness of the risotto was a little overpowering at first but mellowed. All in all a delicious meal that wasn't \\"out of this world\\" expensive. \\n\\nIf you went strictly for dinner and had a glass of wine with dinner, a couple could get out of there under $60. The fun was in tasting the wines (they don't mind if you keep going back and tasting others during dinner vs. ordering a glass of wine off the menu) and that did drive up the price to about $90 for a couple. \\n\\nA question...should you tip on the price of dinner if no wine is served by the server? Our dinner was about $50 and we spent about $35 on the wine tasting (which is \\"do it yourself\\"); do I tip based just on dinner service or on the total bill?? What do y'all think?? \\n\\nOne drawback- Taste's website mentions a live Jazz band and Cabernet specials Sunday night; saw neither one that night and no one mentioned anything about a Cab special. A little thing but need proof in advertising... \\n\\nOverall, great experience and would definitely go back as there are a lot of appetizers that I want to try!"},{"name":"Social Vinings","address":"3691 Vinings Slope Dr, Ste 4110","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3","text":"This time around I ate dinner at Social.

Most important they were cooked to the right temperature.  The red wine reduction added a nice touch of flavor.  The bleu cheese potato cake that came with it as a side was quite tasty as well.\\n\\nFor my desert I ordered the mini ice cream cones.

Our server was very helpful and we enjoyed the times he came around. \\n\\nWe opted for the wine flights, which were a very nice way to get a taste of something new for those of us who don't have a whole lot of experience with such things. We took the advice of the masses and chose the crab cake and crab-infused Mac and cheese. Those were very good and I would recommend trying at least one of them. Our entrees were awesome. The crab dishes were much better than other places to which we are more accustomed to. The sheer size of each piece of crab made this experience far better than any other we had until this point. No more digging for crab meat - each piece was pre-cracked and large enough for a full meal. This was a particularly nice detail, given that most places charge an arm and a leg for crab dishes that hardly leave you satisfied. \\n\\nOverall, I'd say this is a wonderful place to spend an evening and would recommend it to anyone willing to up the ante for a spectacular date. \\n\\nPro tip: If you're looking for a way to cap off the night with a great way to relax, follow with a trip to Brass House downtown.

I heard it they use all local suppliers, including the butcher right next door to the restaurant. Upon arrival I was impressed immediately with the decor and vibe. The tunes coming through the speakers were top40 z100 type music, which right away detracted from the mood. \\nWe were sat right away at the kitchen bar which was a delight to watch the cooks work. The service was quick enough but felt slightly condescending. When the waiter found out my girlfriend and I each wanted our own meal we were given a disapproving look and an answer of \\"we encourage people to share their plate here.\\" - gross another detraction.\\nThe main reason I wanted to dine here was I hear that their Reuben  was the best in portland. And it was good - but there was more effort out into the presentation than the actual sandwich. There was gobs of sour kraut, but minimal meat. While tasty, it was a letdown - certainly not the best in town.\\nThe same could be said for the drinks. Way overpriced. $8 for what looked to be a 10oz glass filled with ice and topped with a weak Bloody Mary mix. The effort seemed to be more in the garnish and the spice than the booze.\\nThe brussel sprouts on the other hand were phenomenal. Absolutely delicious.\\nAll in all a decent joint - but over priced and not great serving portions of meat or booze. I would recommend heading across the street to 5th Quadrant. The atmosphere is just as nice, they have a better Reuben, and their beer is top notch."},{"name":"UFO Pizza","address":"6024 NE Glisan St","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I really don't know what these folks are talking about.

Forget Boston's North End, get on the T and make your way to East Boston and go directly to Rino's Place.\\n\\nIt's rare to not find a single flaw in a meal. Rino's Place was one of those rare places that deliver a flawless meal. I had seen Rino's on an re-run episode of Diner, Drive-ins &Dives the previous night while channel surfing. It just so happened that I was going to be in East Boston the following day, I knew where I would be eating the next day. Rino's opens for business at 3:00 in the afternoon on Saturdays. I arrived at 2:45 and there was already a sizable line waiting to get in. By the time the doors opened it was obvious that the more than a few people would be waiting for a table. \\n\\nAfter reviewing the sizeable menu I decided of an appetizer of octopus, mussels and clams in a red sauce. Since I was alone I got the  1/2 order for $6. For the main course I got the Rino's Special, veal, chicken cutlet, shrimp, mushrooms (shitaki, oyster & porcini) in a cream sauce made with brandy, veal stock, butter and cream. After a short wait may appetizer arrived, the  1/2 order looked like what most places serve as a full order. It looked amazing and tasted even better. The octopus was perfectly cooked, not even a hint of toughness, the mussels and clams also perfect, the sauce was rich and smooth and tasted of fresh tomatoes and was the perfect sauce to bring it all together. Two pieces of crusty bread rounded it out. FYI - the full order would make a perfect sized meal. \\n\\nNext the Rino's Special, once again this was cooked and seasoned to perfection. It's hard to describe how good it truly was. The veal and chicken were tender and juicy, the shrimp not a hint of toughness. The brandy cream sauce was light and complimented the veal, chicken and shrimp instead being overpowering. The mushrooms added an excellent earthy flavor to the dish.  Perfection, taking the in the overall meal it's changed how I view Italian food. \\n\\nDuring the whole meal service was excellent. \\n\\nDon't be intimidated on the worn look of the neighborhood. Seek out Rino's for a very memorable meal; just be forewarned you are very likely to have a significant wait for a table. It's hard to believe that Rino's could receive any negative review. Yet looking at some fellow Yelps there are a few. All that I saw had to do with the long waits. Keep in mind it is a small place and very popular. It's popular for a reason, it's is that good. In life nothing is free, there will most likely be a longer than average wait. This is the price you pay. My advice is to muster your patience, and plan for a wait. You will be rewarded.\\n\\nNote - Reservations are accepted only for parties of 6 or more. Casual dress is ok, remember it's a neighborhood eatery."},{"name":"Miyako Sushi","address":"2341 E Hastings Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"3","text":"There was a long lineup at Sushi Nanaimo, so I used Yelp to find another nearby Japanese restaurant.

There was only one other party in the dining room and a good number of folks hanging in the bar area when I left.\\n\\nFor my dinner I enjoyed a 3 course meal consisting of the following:\\n\\n. Crispy Summer Rolls (6 pieces) $6 Cambodian crispy summer rolls filled with pork, carrot and onion, served with fish sauce for dipping\\n\\n. Beef Stew $10 Served with rice noodle and garnished with scallion, cilantro and roasted garlic \\n\\n. Sweet Banana in Coconut Milk $6 \\n\\nA satisfying meal indeed!\\n\\nThe rolls were hot and crispy.  My only negative mention is that the filling to shell ratio could be improved upon.  The rolls were narrow, so they didn't have all that much stuffing, so you mostly taste the crisp shell.  Also, a little sauce spoon would be useful in this case to avoid double-dipping since the double dish can't be lifted and poured out of.\\n\\nThe beef and noodle dish was simple - a hill of rice noodles and beansprouts topped with about 9 pieces each of tender beef and carrots (yes, the carrots were tender too... not mushy... not raw tasting... just right!) and garnished with a generous amount of roasted garlic, swimming in a reddish broth.  A good choice for a cold night.\\n\\nThe dessert arrived steaming, yet not mouth-burning, to the table.  A generous portion of sliced bananas floated in the coconut milk soup dotted sparingly with tapioca.  I loved this!  And it was plenty for 2, or maybe even 3, to share.  Tip - finish this onsite as it does not keep or reheat well.  The banans turned tough.\\n\\n3.5 stars\\n \\n***\\n\\nOn the website it says that they offer 1/2 priced apps at the Happy Hour at the bar 5-7pm on Mondays - Fridays.  Turns out it has changed to $5 appetizers according to the board out in front of the restaurant and confirmed by the hostess who seated me."},{"name":"Shoal Creek Saloon","address":"909 N Lamar Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"Awesome place to stop in to eat!

It looked like they did not wait to have the grill heat up, resulting in a gray-ish brown piece of meat covered in brown sauce.  Yuck.  The rice on the sushi tasted like it had too much vinegar in it which was off putting.  The fried food(seriously, how do you mess up fried food?), was super oily and heavy.

They only offer valet service which is not free - it was $25/night. I believe since they ONLY offer valet it should be complimentary or offer somewhere to park ourselves. Also, there is only 1 driveway so twice in 1 weekend, we had to wait in our car for other guests to load/unload their car before we could leave the hotel.

You arent missing much if you skip this place."},{"name":"The Butcher Shop","address":"552 Tremont St","city":"Boston","stars":"4","text":"FINALLY went to the Butcher Shop on Sunday - I've been wanting to go for ages, but the one time I've tried before we thought it was just full of people waiting for tables, and it turned out we'd blundered into some kind of special private event... so awkward.  Luckily we managed to leave without anything other than a few evil glares from people there.\\n\\nAnyways, pick your time to visit Butcher Shop carefully.  You will have to wait for a table because it's really small and really popular.  So go hungry but not too hungry, or try and game it to minimise wait time (as an FYI a rainy Sunday at 7:30pm the day before the marathon worked pretty well for us - we waited only about 15 minutes).  Also one of the things I really liked about the Butcher Shop was that they have a large table by the bar where you can wait, and even order food and drink to keep you going without standing awkwardly over people who are trying to eat or drink at the bar.\\n\\nIn general, the Butcher Shop was worth the wait.  The food and drink was generally excellent, the service was slow at times, but generally good.  The portions (except for the meat dishes) were definitely \\"European-size\\" but to my mind that just means you have room to try more stuff.\\n\\nWe shared burrata and a selection of pates to start.  I am queen of the burrata, and the cheese itself was perfect.  I do think it could have been accented slightly better though - there wasn't much accompanying it.  The pates were really excellent though - we had a selection of duck rilllete, duck liver and pate de campagne and all were delicious.\\n\\nFor main course, I personally liked the limited selection because I felt it meant everything was likely to be much fresher.  However I was devastated to hear they had run out of the duck, which was what I had been craving all day.  The lamb I ordered instead was good, although perhaps a little too well done for my taste - I would have liked them to ask me how I liked it.  The pork loin and the lamb ragu were both very good.  However the poussin could have been better - the confit was not the best.  Still nice though!  And we had the fingerlings with aioli as a side which were really yummy.\\n\\nWe shared dessert and ordered the chocolate mousse and date cake.  The date cake was a little dry, but the mousse was DELUMPTIOUS.  This was the one thing that I was a little sad was a European size portion :(\\n\\nWe also ordered a LOT of wine by the glass and I don't think any of us had a bad one.  The gruner veltliner was perfect: light and crisp but flavourful.  The bordeaux was also really good, not too tannin-y but very flavourful.  Finally the dessert wine (a muscat) was sweet but not too sweet and verged on fizzy.  Such a delightful way to end the meal, I ended up having 2 glasses :)  The waiter did a great job of recommending good wines for us.\\n\\nSo, Butcher Shop is definitely on the pricy side, and you will have to wait a while, but for sure worth the visit.  A fine dining experience in a laid back and casual environment."},{"name":"Beat Brasserie","address":"13 Brattle St","city":"Cambridge","stars":"3.5","text":"Great service by bartender Andrew from Kansas City.

I thought there would be a wait, as other reviewers have experienced, but we were able to start bowling immediately.  I don't know what standard prices are for bowling these days, but at Kings it's $6.25/person/game, with a $4 shoe rental fee.  Kinda costly for me, but I wasn't paying!\\n\\nThe lanes were set up for cosmic bowling, or something like that. There were 4 large television screens showing ESPN, and scoring is electronically calculated on these tiny screens at your lane.  I did like the little animations that came up, giving tips on where to throw your next shot, or a little cartoon about what your shot (or lack of a shot) is.\\n\\nWe also ordered food. The food is not their strong point, in my opinion. We got a small order of wings, which were really bad. Some were so greasy, others not enough sauce. Seemed like a haphazard job to me. We also ordered a cheese, pesto and sundried tomato pizza, which was slightly more edible.  Drinks are also expensive, but there is a nice selection of vodkas and rum.\\n\\nWe then went on to play pool.  Again, no wait. I really liked the pool area. Dark, roomy, with really nice dark brown leather chairs.  Pool was $14 an hour, which I think is fairly reasonable.  \\n\\nKings had a bit of a loungy feel to it. Aside from bowling and pool, there are video games and air hockey.  I'm thinking darts have to be back there somewhere too. It's a fun place to go for a date or if friends are in town and you don't want to travel into Kenmore, especially on a game day.  Located right near Berklee and the Pru, so it's really easy to get to from the Green Line."},{"name":"Istanbul'lu","address":"237 Holland St","city":"Somerville","stars":"4","text":"Wow is this a great amazing change from the slow boring holland street cafe that used to be here! So happy that this moved in instead! The service was great and even though this place is small, the new decor makes it so much nicer than the place that was here before!\\n\\nIf you like to be adventurous with your food, this is a great place to come, mainly because you don't really know what everything is on the menu unless you are in fact Turkish. ha ha A lot of the terms and things are not fully explained so Deanna and I had to ask our waitress some clarification questions, which can be fun, but I would like to know all of my options up front :-)\\n\\nWe decided to split a few tapas and one of their sandwiches. That sandwich was well worth the low price because it was pretty big! Nothing came on the side and it was full of their in house made falafel type mixture and had this amazing yogurt type sauce on it. For $6 I think was the price it was a steal for how tasty it was.\\n\\nWe also got one of their baked eggplant tapas which definitely caught our taste and temperature sensors off guard---when something is labeled as baked, it makes it instantly seem like it will be a hot dish! Well, this one was cold. I guess this is one of the few dishes they don't make fresh but make in the morning instead. It was only okay in my opinion mainly because that kofka sandiwch was so much more flavorful and way more fun to eat. \\n\\nBut their fried zucchini bites in this sauce as a tapa was also pretty top notch. Especially when paired with some of the best free bread I've had in a while and this free bread comes with a delicious red pepper aioli type sauce for dipping which should make anyone happy. \\n\\nWe ended our meal with their house made baklava only this baklava was round, in cylinder shape and it was much harder and more cinnamon based than other baklava I've had, so I'm glad I could experience a new version of this dish! Definitely makes you want to order some milk though. That thing is pretty crunchy and sticky! But I will definitely be back here to try more of their tapas! And they are all big portions for tapas for a change too!"},{"name":"Epicure Market","address":"1025 Cannon Dr, Ste 105","city":"Dripping Springs","stars":"4.5","text":"Wonderful food and service!

My husband gave the salad high marks but there was something left under the filling in the eggs during prep (onion skin? paper? yuck.) The flavor of the chicken was excellent but I have to agree with lizzie: there wasn't much meat for four pieces. The gravy on the mashed potatoes was light and nicely garlicky but the biscuit was a hockey puck. \\n\\nThe seating needs to be rethought; most of the tables are lined up in a row so you are elbow to elbow with strangers. It also gets incredibly noisy when the restaurant fills up so it was hard to have conversation without straining to hear or raising our voices. For me, that's a turnoff - if I can't hear the person or people I'm with, half the fun of going out for a meal is ruined.\\n\\nIn short, I've had better food in a nicer atmosphere, so I give it meh-two-stars."},{"name":"Cantina La Mexicana","address":"247 Washington St","city":"Somerville","stars":"3.5","text":"Good food at appropriate portion sizes and prices. \\n\\nWe got the \\"Bases Loaded\\" ($8) and the \\"Enchiladas Relleno\\" ($7), from the lunch menu even though it was a Sunday.\\n\\nWhen we asked the server a question about the two different sauces that can come with our meal, he suggested a mixture that worked out really well.\\n\\nWe also ordered two house margaritas, and for no reason at all we got them in large glasses instead of smaller ones!

The service and atmosphere are fine, but it has the feel of a big chain - somewhat generic and impersonal. But no particular issue with it outside of that. Everyone was friendly and attentive. Except the hostess, who needs a little more customer service training and a little less 'tude. \\n\\nMy real issue was with the food, which was mediocre. And for the price, I expect much more than mediocre. OK, crab legs were good and tasted fairly fresh. Everything else was just very disappointing. The brandy perppercorn cream sauce smothered any natural flavor out of the steak au poivre. French fries looked good when they arrived - thin cut and golden. But biting into it, it tasted like processed potatos - mushy and flavorless. The jalapeno salmon was also mediocre. Fish tasted fresh enough, but absolutely nothing special to how it was cooked. Mediocre sides.\\n\\nThe fact that this place has so many good reviews makes me feel as though the dumbing down of dining (thanks to the big chains) that has already happened en masse in the quick serve and casual dining spaces, is underway in the fine dining arena as well.

This place seats maybe 50 and if you come around 12:30...well just don't. A long wait is no biggie, but it is if you're told it won't be that long. Minus a point for the inaccurate wait estimate and Mrs. Flinstone. Wait is 30 minutes. No another 20. Oh \\"girl-with-a-Flinstone-character-name\\" came back, I have to seat her first at what would've been your table that accommodates 4 (the mantra of this weekend was \\"I HATE WILMA,\\" and girl, watch your back if you ever come to NYC, I'll be stealing your tables left and right). After over an hour-long wait we felt like a bunch of arses for standing next to eating people for so long, where we were constantly in the way of the servers, since there is no real waiting area.\\n\\nWe could've been blowing up fireworks and watching dragon heads munch on lettuce! And apparently we could've come back long after our table had been called and still have been seated. And once we waited for 30, we were too invested to start over somewhere else. Grr.\\n\\nFinally seated at a communal table, we over-ordered after staring longingly at food being served during our fraught wait. Steamed shrimp noodle, siu mai, har gaw, steamed chicken buns, sticky rice, beef chow fun, lo bo gaw. It was all average at best. We're used to SF dim sum and NYC definitely serves it up better than this, so maybe it's all relative.

We started with a creamy carrot soup topped with an unnecessary salsa verde. My favorite dish of the meal, the charchuterie plate, came next. The foie-gras bon bon lived up to its reputation. The chicken pates were exceptional, paired with a suprisingly spicy grain mustard. Next came a forgettable salad. In preparation for the main dish a campari, grapefruit granata tickled my tongue. I was wary when I read beef and turnip potpie was the feature, but boy oh boy was it the best saucy beef I've ever tasted topped with a creme fraiche pie dough. At this point I was pretty full and satisfied, but two courses remained. Unfortunatley the cheese plate and lemon buttermilk souffle were not very appealing. Cheese is pretty much my favorite and none of them stood out, although my dinner mates disagree. The souffle was so bitter I couldn't finish it, although again my dinner mates wolfed theirs down.

With the hipster menu design, the emphasis on cocktails, reasonable prices, decor so unpretentious it's almost pretentious, and busy/friendly vibe, it's a great restaurant masquerading as a casual neighborhood. spot.\\n\\nThe food made me think that the kitchen staff must be made up of people who are there just to have fun dreaming up new recipes and combinations.  The best example of this is something called \\"devils on horseback.\\" You can only eat one or two they are so rich, a date, stuffed with goat cheese and wrapped in bacon.  Sounds impossible and weird but turns out to be delicious.  Here's the kicker, there's no pit in the date, instead they've put an almond in the center, which at first I removed (thinking it was a pit), any way I thought that was awesome.  Except for how filling it is and the fact there are four to a serving, I would consider it the quintessential amuse-bouche.  Tres amusante!\\n\\nWe had the pig and pickle plate, again, someone in the kitchen must be having fun frying pork lardoony things, serving them with more pork, sliced, a shredded chicken pate, and various sweet pickles, bread and mustard.  \\n\\nThe pickles are another thing that makes you think they are having fun in the kitchen--who bothers making their own pickles in a casual restaurant?  They were a little sweet for me, but I appreciate the effort to do something like handmade pickles that seems very honest in a retro--and very Somerville--way.   \\n\\nThe roasted half chicken is delicious and small but very filling, in part due to a rich gravy, and so was a skirt steak with soft roasted cloves of garlic, served over a large latke that made a nice foil for the meat.  Nice to have a change from fries. \\n\\nThe cocktails are very good, beware if you are a lightweight like me, they are large and very strong, I was almost slurring my words after one \\"Buckminster,\\" but it was nice and cold and a good aperitif.  My husband said the mai tai was solid too.  \\n\\nMy only caveat about the food is it is very rich, and very salty.  Most people probably appreciate this but I felt like my arteries and blood pressure and digestion were just thrumming trying to cope with this meal afterwards.  Or maybe it was the drink.  Fun and enjoyable, but maybe not something you want to do very often.  \\n\\nThe service was friendly and competent, water glasses filled, menu explained, a little anxious to clear but not to the point of being intrusive.  There are no placemats or tableclothes on the bare boards of the table, which I'm not crazy about.  \\n\\nIt's Lent so I'm not eating dessert--I must confess however, the meal I had was in every way NOT in the Lenten spirit of renunciation.

They apparently focus on the sour and funky yeast strain styles of beer, which is ambitious on their part and refreshingly unusual. So it's not just a cool setup, but a fairly solid product too. I think the main draw, as I saw it, was the incredibly welcoming and huge tasting area, though. Everybody is having a good time in the shade of some trees and enjoying a pour from a variety of innovative brewing creations.  They really treat their guests nicely with how things are set up here.\\n\\nSimply put, this is a must visit spot when you're in the Austin area.

Parents or other adults who are coming to town. Reasons: food is delicious and pleases those who have discriminating taste, and also those who may not be adventurous enough for some of my other favourite establishments; takes reservations.\\n2. Brunch, when you don't want to wait. I have avoided writing this review for a long time because I don't really want others in on the secret. It must be a secret, right? Because I can't understand why there isn't a wait here down the block every weekend. But, much to my delight, there isn't. I've rarely ever had to wait at all here for brunch (but if you do, have one of their great cocktails at the bar while you do). I'm going to say never, actually. But the food is so good! The service is friendly, and quick, and everything is tasty. I have dreams about the breakfast spaghetti carbonera (which might have just been a special, because I haven't seen it in a while). I'm also terribly fond of the duck hash (my favourite hash in town), as well as a the monte cristo. And just a few weeks ago, I ventured away from the previously mentioned favourites and had the Dutch Bambino with vanilla peaches, basil, and fresh whipped cream. Not too sweet, not too big, just the perfect thing to satisfy someone with wants to go sweet instead of savory first thing in the morning. Oh, and if instead you want rich and decadent you can't go wrong with the crab cake benedict. Amazing.\\n\\nSo, a solid five stars, but please don't turn this place into another Portland brunch place with lines for hours. Let's keep it the little neighbourhood gem it is. (the gem, I'll travel across town for)."},{"name":"Little Bacch","address":"1198 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"3.5","text":"Better than Bacchanalia, IMO.

It will be on the right after that..\\n\\nWHAT TO ORDER: Beef Tartare, Chocolate Souffle.\\n\\nWe came there with a party of four. After ordering cocktails, entrees and desserts, it was a long wait to get things started. The restaurant was also not filled with people, as it is supposed to be a hidden place, and it comes with a big price tag.\\n\\nThe bread before dinner was just okay, not as good as Bacchanalia. What surprised me were meat dishes and sweets. \\n\\nBeef tartare was so spot on with high quality fresh beef. It was such a unique flavor that resembles no other dishes I've had. Duck confit has a crisp yet soft skin with great meat. Rainbow trouts were also the best fish I've had for a long time. \\n\\nI seldom ordered Chocolate Souffle, thinking I wouldn't be surprised about that. Boy, am I so wrong. The chocolate souffle is my favorite of tonight. It was moist, soft, combining every quality a cake has to one single dish. I couldn't think of anything to improve it. Just perfect! I used to buy canneles from Paris Baguette, and didn't understand its goodness, until today. That's how it should taste like.\\n\\nBecause service was really slow, it should be a 4.5, but I'm in a forgiving mood and give Little Bacch a 5 for its impeccable food.

We were seated at the end of a very empty counter right next to the service window.  Ok by me, as I work in a kitchen, & I wanted to watch what was being done back there, but I was also right up next to the only other two people at the counter.  Kinda weird. \\n\\nWe were greeted by a server promptly, informed of specials, & asked for coffee.  Note:  this is our second visit.  First time for dinner, not so great, but I don't like to write reviews based on the first visit.  Relevance to this note:  last visit the coffee was not good.  This time the coffee was not good.  It's Stumptown.  It's brewed weak, it's lukewarm, it's hard to get a refill.  \\n\\nWe ordered.  We were informed our food would come out as it was ready.  OK.  Cool. We planned to share. (by the way, this is NOT family style.  Family style is when it all comes from the kitchen at the same time on big plates.  If I served my family one thing at a time, they'd all starve, & I would never eat!)\\n\\n The sweet biscuits came first, & were delightful.  I ordered the Shakshuka with merguez sausage added.  My husband ordered Moroccan Chicken Hash.  I also asked for a side of pimento cheese.  After asking the cook, our server said, \\"yes, we can do that!\\".  The Chicken Hash came first.  Egg cooked perfectly.  It was fantastic.  No toast with it, though.  Our side of pimento cheese came, but I had nothing to eat it with, so I asked for a side of bread.  We were promptly given some wonderfully chewy bread.  There was quite a long wait between dishes.  We were very thankful for our bread & pimento cheese.  Finally my Shakshuka arrived.  Also delicious.  It came with toast & another side of bread arrived.  Huh?  We had ALOT of bread.  \\n\\nThe bread & coffee sort of explain 4 stars.  No excuse to not serve really good coffee hot.  Why not tell me we would get more bread with my order? Or mention that my dish has toast on the menu?  No one was hurt, but it was weird.  The 3 stars comes from the service.  It's hurried.  There's seemingly no thought put into things like mentioning the bread service & how it works, It took a really long time to get our check.  It was a Monday morning, not a leisurely Sunday. The hostess sort of dumped us off.

Luckily for them this isn't beeradvocate, so we'll give them a solid 4.\\n\\n\\nThe first reason for this is their location: it's kind of out of the way, which makes sure that it looks like a legitimate backyard in the middle of a rural area. On top of that, the view is lit-up and spacious and it's next to a (similarly fun-looking) pizza place, in case you get hungry. Jester King itself operates like a beer garden: you order beer inside and take it out yourself. Outside, there's an unlimited supply of water, which you're sure to need while sampling one of the many available beers. \\n\\n\\nWith all of these upsides, it's no surprise that Jester King can get busy. This leads to long waits at the bar, where the staff tends to act very reserved.

I asked one question about a roll and she took ten minutes to go ask - they have no roll descriptions so you are left to remember what that roll is made like everywhere else right? WRONG...

I went through the whole ordering part, got to the phone number part (so almost done with my order) and the clerk abruptly announces she has to go because she has a customer! I asked \\"am I not a customer too?\\" She says yes, but she (the customer in the store, I was ordering on the phone) is waving at me. After saying bye, I has no idea if the order was in or not.

Add to that the din of the crowd, and my party of 4 had to yell at each other across the table.  The food was just ok.  The drinks were good.  The service was not very good, but we wrote that off as it being a new place and the servers getting their bearings.  One of the people in our party ordered a drink, only to be told they were out of it, so she ordered another.  Another waiter brought her the first drink, then our waiter brought her the 2nd.  He said he would just leave it for her and apologized for the mix up.  When the bill came, both drinks were on there.  We didn't complain because she drank both, but he clearly made it seem like he wasn't going to charge her for it.  We ordered a bunch of food items - all of which were fine but not great - and then left there and went directly to another restaurant to eat again.

The chicken is usually nice and juicy and I have discovered that their guacamole is great on chips. And oh the chips! The lime salt that they put on them has got to be the greatest thing ever. \\n\\nChipotle will always stand above Freebirds in my mind because the meat is so much more flavorful. At Freebirds I have to put the devil sauce on the steak burritos just to make it comparable to Chipotle's amazing steak. \\n\\nAnother great thing about Chipotle is what I can only describe as the post-chipotle poo.

Very much a suburb haven for families, parties for local high school athletes, cheap dates of established couples and very much the working class burger place  in a middle class neighborhood with huge servings and very little attitude.  Its kind of a \\"guy\\" place as well....atmosphere is secondary to serving size, taste & value for the money [note most of the positive reviews so far are from men].  Regarding attitude, in fact the help is perpetually \\"up\\" and scream \\"5 at the door\\" when 5 new customers walk in.  Its big, its greasy, its clean (fortunately) and not for regular consumption (like multiple visits per week) because you'll drive our cardiologist nuts!  \\n\\nA note on the \\"happy talk\\" other reviewers below are overly upset about.... I'm not big on forced  corporate \\"upness\\" either, but you can get that anywhere from Jamba Juice to Starbucks and its just \\"the way it is.\\"  Especially during a near-Depression where working class young people who are fortunate enough to get these jobs will do just about anything to keep them (12.5% unemployment in PDX on top of a huge underemployed population...jobs are impossible to find).  I suggest be cool, relax, and realize these folks are trying desperately to keep their jobs!  Final comment on atmosphere I'm not a big fan of the musical choice....its exclusionary.   I'd rather hear some Isley Brother's \\"Go For Your Guns\\", Mother's Finest, Funkadelic or some Rufus mixed in with my Pink Floyd, Steve Miller Band or Cheap Trick because as kids this is what our \\"sounds\\" were like...we were fluid and moved back and forth alot so, they might pick a less exclusionary musical choice to make many more of us feel \\"at home.\\"  Now onto the food....\\n\\nI always order the cheese burger and if I've been working out lots I go for the double burger.  Everything is fresh from burger to condiments and cooked while you wait.  Condiment bar is always clean as is the bathroom and while you wait there open boxes with roasted and salted peanuts in a shell for you to munch on.  I guess this is proof that they use peanut oil?  Also I usually order fries...and thats the big story here...the fries are really, really, really good.\\n\\nWhen my partner and I go together we split an order of large fries and have enough to take home as a snack!  Served in a cup thrown in a bag, these huge things have the skin still on them and are distinctly \\"anti-Big chain\\" in that they are clearly made In-N-Out style fresh and without too many preservatives (i.e. Supersize me & the McDonalds fries that never ever die!).  They provide malt vinegar which can be poured onto the fries ala authentic British fish-n-ships; makes me fond of the one good eating experience I had as a child living in England!   These fries are incredibly good, unforgettable and the reason you come back!\\n\\nThe burgers are pretty darn good, but I would not say that they are the best I've ever had.  However, as a fast food product it is high end and, thankfully, not that expensive!  It is very nice that the condiments are fresh and this adds to the quality of the burger-eating experience...real mushrooms, fresh lettuce and tomatoes, bacon that isn't overly processed etc.\\n\\nOverall a solid eating experience and definitely an example of a somewhat higher end working class burger joint and a clean place to boot!  I'm not sure what some of the other reviewers expect at a place like this, but if they like In-N-Out Burgers in California this is very much the same thing with bigger servings!  Five Guys Burgers and Fries is a worthwhile fast-food choice and remember that the real story is those delicious and plentiful fries."},{"name":"Pig Floyd's Urban Barbakoa","address":"1326 N Mills Ave","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"I had read the earlier reviews for this place, and a few people mentioned that the restaurant still had to work out some kinks, so I decided to wait a while before I checked this place out.\\n\\nWhatever kinks they had were ironed out when I went.

I had the most frightening experience EVER.  I parked behind the restaurant and entered through their back entrance.  It takes you through the main dining area which is kind of strange.  I would hate to be seated back there on a busy night, I can't imagine the foot traffic while trying to enjoy dinner.  Thankfully, when we were there it wasn't busy and we were seated on the side across from the open kitchen.  This brings me to my complaint.  As I walked passed the OPEN kitchen to get to the hostess desk, I noticed that one of the chefs was trimming his fingernails (then was picking at the skin on the palm of his hand) while in the kitchen!!! YUK!!!!!!!  I didn't say anything at first because I was just trying to process what I had seen.  Then my friends showed up, I mentioned what I had seen.  They had eaten here before and said to stay and give it a try.  I still have no idea why I stayed.  Service was inattentive at best.  The waitresses seemed to congregate at the back of the restaurant, hanging out and chatting.  We got no refills on water, wine or bread.  To me the restaurant just seemed really loud, I could barely hear my friend from across the table.  Tables were too close together, too, which I'm guessing doesn't help with the noise level.  The food for the most part was pretty good. If the atmosphere was more pleasing, I would consider returning.  But after seeing what goes on in their kitchen and inattentive staff, I think I'm all set.  Worst of all, I went up to the hostess after dinner to let her know what I had seen.  I asked to speak to a manager and she informed me there was no manager on that night.  Really?!! No wonder why you have chefs grooming themselves in the kitchen and waitresses too busy chatting to take care of their patrons.

Let's face it, summer has shrunk and even on sunny days, grass often glistens with the days moisture, making a tarp the only sensible blanket option. \\n\\nSo is Picnic House a real substitute for an outdoor picnic? No, but it's a clever premise, a picnic box purveyor for lunch meetings or ready-made sustenance for a wine tasting adventure in the valley. I've never actually had their picnic boxes and while $12 seems a bit pricey for a box lunch, the quality of their food makes the price seem like a steal.\\n\\nMore on price: My perfect lunch price is $5 because it's a meal that one does not typically devote much time to beyond sitting at ones desk or a quick jaunt to a nearby food cart. However, for a longer, lingering lunch either on a weekday or weekend, the offerings at Picnic House are well priced and well positioned, as there are several combos (sandwich, soup, salad) that give any clock puncher a sense of choice in an otherwise mind numbing day. The portions are also incredibly generous, providing additional rationale for a spendier lunch.\\n\\nOnto the offerings: From the bavette (beef) skewers to the pickled shrimp, PH knows meat. And unlike the 'bacon with a side of bacon' craze dominating Portland, the vegetarian options are bountiful and delicious. My current veggie faves are the mushroom soup and nutty brown rice salad. The soup is not cream with a side of shrooms, rather it is the exact opposite, allowing the mushroom flavor to shine through. And the salad could be the requisite homage to the city's many vegans and frankly a pile of tasteless veggies on a bag of steamed brown rice. Instead, fresh veggies abound, making this one of the most unique salads I've ever tasted. As a carnivore, I'm hard pressed to fill up on a veggie meal, but whether it's the grilled cheese sandwich or a soup/salad duo, I always walk away full. You know, after a helping of Picnic House's signature rice pudding. \\n\\nThe owners of PH also own Puddin' on the Rice, a well, rice pudding restaurant, which has only until this point, existed in my darkest food fantasies. Kudos to one of the owner's grandmothers because as I understand it, her recipe inspired the rice pudding that is the foundation of every creative flavor of this age-old dessert served at both Puddin' on the Rice, as well as Picnic House. My girlfriend claims to hate rice pudding and after agreeing to try a bite (of both coconut and pistachio), has now taken it upon herself to perfect her own home grown recipe of the stuff. \\n\\nAnd how 'bout that space: One can't help but wonder if Picnic House would stand on its menu alone (and I believe it could) because it's difficult to separate the food from the space. Living in a cavernous setting, the space recalls that of a bank at the early 20th century. One expects Mr. Drysdale and Ms. Hathaway to saunter down the stairs that extend into a mysterious second floor, right off the main dining space. It turns out the space is the old lobby of the original Heathman Hotel and I think about what a treasure it must have been to discover the walls and floor and other remnants of a simpler time and more intricate architecture. This is a perfect space for getting lost in hours of conversation, as you sit in a low lit room, with generous space between tables. The seats are not incredibly comfortable and noise does travel, but if you can't beat 'em, join 'em--I've started bringing larger parties and it's a perfect place for happy hour and meal sharing. \\n\\nPicnic House has quickly become our post-Fox Tower movie dinner go-to spot and really the place we find an excuse to go to whenever we find ourselves downtown. After a show at the Keller, we were delighted to bring friends there because upon entering the space and cracking open the menu it's obvious that this isn't just another Portland dining establishment--it's a labor of love, with creative cuisine, inviting ambiance and if I can't have a picnic, at least I can have Picnic House."},{"name":"Salt & Straw","address":"2035 NE Alberta St","city":"Portland","stars":"4.5","text":"sweet tooth highlight | unique\\n$$\\n\\nIf it's your first time in Portland, it is a MUST to stop here.

You're so tempted to get it, but you know you'll never wear/use it. Muqueca was kind of like that for me.\\n\\nThis place gets so many five stars! The menu also seems like it's entirely oriented around the authenticity of Brazilian food. I really wanted to like it because I lovee homey authentic dishes, but dammit! I just couldn't get into it!\\n\\nThe staff was wonderful. It was my first time at the restaurant and our waitress made really good suggestions. I decided to follow through by ordering the Mariscada, which is a variety of seafood with cilantro, tomato, onions, and coconut milk. I think the dish was good, but I feel like the coconut milk kind of dulled down the potential of a cleaner and  much brighter flavor. The dish came with farofa, which is ground yucca that tasted kind of oniony (really good) and plantain moqueca, which was pretty good too. Maybe I just don't have the tongue for the Brazilian authenticity, but I thought it was just okay. To me, it was just a stew that's served with rice.\\n\\nFor an appetizer, I ordered the fried yucca, which is chunks of yucca served with a special sauce. The special sauce tasted almost identical to zesty ranch and the fried yucca was kind of plain. It was like eating big steak fries with ranch almost. I've had yucca prepared differently multiple times and loved it, but this one was probably the most boring one I've had it.\\n\\nIf you love stews and all that hearty good stuff, I'm sure you'll enjoy this place. It's size is small, but bright in colors. It has almost a cute tropical feel to it. \\n\\nUgh. I feel like an ass for giving this place 3 stars, but I'm just being honest...

Takes FOREVER to be seated now despite an abundance of open tables (waited close to 10 minutes this time). According to the manager Michael, that is Too Jays corporate policy. To have customers stand in line until they are ready to serve you. Beyond that statement being absolutely ludicrous (the clientele is largely elderly) its not true. We still waited over 10 minutes once seated for a waitress to EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE US. Once we finally were, our order came out wrong for the third visit in a row.  Aforementioned \\"manager\\" came to the table, rattled off a few tired excuses about being busy (isn't that a good thing?) then got very snippy and asked what we wanted him to do about it.

Again everything was cooked perfectly, served hot with onions and peppers on a sizzling fajita pan, seasoned very well and came with two individual plates of crisp lettuce, fresh tomato, sour cream, rice and refried beans and hot soft toritllas.

Definitely recommend going here for a wide range of food - definitely going back. The service was great too - our waitress was very sweet and prompt. Overall I highly recommend."},{"name":"Nino's Italian Restaurant","address":"1931 Cheshire Bridge Rd NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"What a lovely evening what a lovely place. We started with the calamari and then moved into wonderful shrimp pasta dishes. They serve bruschetta as a complimentary nosh when your drink order arrives. The house red is so smooth and mellow. Then for dessert we had profiteroles and coconut cake. Lord it was so satisfying. The ambiance with very sexy Italian music was very relaxing."},{"name":"Slidders Pizza","address":"13848 Tilden Rd","city":"Winter Garden","stars":"4","text":"We order from them quite often. My son, while only 8, is quite a picky eater and has declared them the best pizza on earth. It is pretty darn good, and I'm from New Jersey. I haven't tried their wings but should. I have had their salad and that was good. Just like their pizza, it is one price and then you put as much stuff on as you want for the same price.  The owner is very often working there and is very friendly.\\n\\n We will be moving in about a month and will be closer to Winter Garden Pizza, which we also like, so we are a little sad that we won't be likely to get Slidders anymore. But if you are closer to Slidders than Winter Garden Pizza, it's DEFINITELY worth saving the time and gas to go to Slidders. They are a little different but equally as good. If we are ever driving through the area, I'm sure my son will want us to pick up a Slidders pizza. \\n\\nIt is just a pick up place with a small counter to sit at; not a dine in location to bring a group."}]`),N={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:z},data(){return{searchQuery:"",visibleCount:6,poemsData:E,isLoading:!1}},computed:{filteredPoems(){return this.searchQuery.trim()?this.poemsData.filter(s=>{const e=this.searchQuery.toLowerCase();return s.name.toLowerCase().includes(e)||s.city.toLowerCase().includes(e)||s.text.toLowerCase().includes(e)}).slice(0,this.visibleCount):this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(s=>setTimeout(s,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},j={class:"search-container"},H={class:"card-container"},O=["disabled"],F={key:0},D={key:1};function R(s,e,n,f,i,r){const c=p("PoemCard");return a(),o("section",null,[e[3]||(e[3]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"üéâ Restaurant Reviews ü•≥")])],-1)),t("div",j,[e[2]||(e[2]=t("span",{class:"search-icon"},"üîç",-1)),b(t("input",{type:"text",class:"search-input","onUpdate:modelValue":e[0]||(e[0]=h=>i.searchQuery=h),placeholder:"Search..."},null,512),[[v,i.searchQuery]])]),t("div",H,[(a(!0),o(y,null,m(r.filteredPoems,(h,g)=>(a(),k(c,{key:g,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),r.hasMorePoems?(a(),o("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:i.isLoading,onClick:e[1]||(e[1]=(...h)=>r.loadMore&&r.loadMore(...h))},[i.isLoading?(a(),o("span",D,"Loading...")):(a(),o("span",F,"See more"))],8,O)):w("",!0)])}const q=u(N,[["render",R],["__scopeId","data-v-fc075a97"]]),V=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"library/51.md","filePath":"library/51.md"}'),G={name:"library/51.md"},Y=Object.assign(G,{setup(s){return(e,n)=>(a(),o("div",null,[I(q)]))}});export{V as __pageData,Y as default};
