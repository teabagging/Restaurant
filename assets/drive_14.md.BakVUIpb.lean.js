As with most Ethiopian dishes, the entree was served with injera, the soft/sour/spongy bread, which I am not a very big fan of, but it tastes OK when eaten with the entree.  You can request French bread in white or wheat if you don't like the injera.  Meta beer was sweet and you should definitely give it a try if you like trying out different kinds of beers.

Onto dinner, I had the mussels - decent sauce (hard to go wrong with a generic white wine and cream sauce, though I must say that Provence still takes the cake on this one), opted to have a side salad rather than the fries and that was quite decent as well (beets, goat cheese, mixed greens, vinaigrette dressing).  We also shared the brussel sprouts - an amazing must have!, lobster mashed potatoes (not as good as poutine but commendable).  Onto dessert - that's where they really hit the mark.  We were there for a pre-wedding dinner for the family, and they surprised the happy couple with a dessert platter, on which they wrote 'Congratulations' in white chocolate around the outside.  The plate included the cheesecake, various brittles, and fresh fruit.

My side salad had the onions I had asked not to have included and the lettuce was wilted and kind of gross. Our food was all cold, probably because it took so long to find its way to our table. Then, on one of the extremely rare occasions our waitress decided to come by our table and bring us drink refills, she decided I would get water with lemon, instead of the iced tea with lemon I had been drinking. I had written this place off a long time ago for exactly this type of service in the past, but recently came back for lunch only because I was with work friends and did not pick the location. At that time we had a pretty good waiter and a decent experience, so today I decided to bring my kids.

I had four different flavors, which I now believe were (as I look at the truck's Facebook page) the \\"Key Slime\\" (a Key Lime-esque cupcake), an Orange Cream Dream, a Lemonata and one Peanut Butter Choco-Rama. I took them home with me, and it didn't take long for me to eat one of them upon arriving at my house. All four cupcakes were excellent! If you see Maria-Cristina N.'s recent review, you'll see that most, if not all, of the cupcakes have a custard-like filling (it's small and not overwhelming; I found my fillings to be in the center of the bottom of the cupcake, and right underneath the icing), which was a pleasant and welcome surprise. I'm not sure any cupcakes I've ever had have had anything like that. Both the icings and the cakes of each cupcake were delicious and had a perfect mixture. Of the cupcakes in the Orlando area that I've tried, these and the ones from Blue Bird Bake Shop are the best. I don't prefer one over the other; both are first-class.\\n\\nOf the four that I ordered, I assumed that I'd love the Choco-Rama one the most since I can't get enough of the P.B. & chocolate combination.

I really want to believe the kitchen was just having an off day, but the food was not good. Soggy fries, badly burnt broccoli, marinara sauce ketchup? For the prices listed on their menu, I expected their food, at the very least, to be properly prepared. I was incredibly disappointed. Also, something seemed to be off with the restaurant's ventilation as the fumes from the kitchen motivated my asthma to rear its ugly head. And while I am certainly asthmatic, I'm not so sensitive to be set off by anything- my attack was brought on by a considerable amount of smoke.\\nIf judged for food on its own this place would get 2 stars at best. However, an extra star is given for the amazing beer and the friendliest, most fun bartender one ever did see. I ordered both the lime Kolsch and the red light district- a chocolate strawberry stout. While the beers were definitely on opposite ends of the spectrum, both were incredibly satisfying and delicious. The beer menu has lots of variety and I think any beer drinker could find a drink at Burnside that wholly meets their needs. \\nAnd then of course there was the bartender who was attentive, funny, and just the right amount of quirkster. \\nI know I'll come back for drinks, but I'll probably steer clear of the food menu- with the prices being what they are, I just can't afford the risk of another dissatisfaction."},{"name":"Bijou Cafe","address":"132 SW 3rd Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"House made scones and french country.

First, we got an order of the oyster omelette with salad and a homemade biscuit on the side. The oyster omelette was unbelievably delicious--the oysters (which were local to Oregon) were lightly dredged with cornmeal, which gave the filling the perfect amount of crunch. They were complemented with delicious fried onions and lean chunks of bacon, which gave the omelette a delicious savory and smoky flavor. Everything about this dish was amazing--the flavors and textures came together so well and were so unique and memorable! The salad on the side was so simple yet so tasty--just a few leaves of lettuce and fennel, tossed in a slightly acidic dressing. And don't get me started on the biscuit, which was perfectly golden brown, crusty, and flaky, with the perfect amount of crunch from the cornmeal. Our server gave us marionberry jam on the side to go with the biscuit, but I found the biscuit was absolutely perfect eaten just by itself! In fact, I would go so far as to say that this was the best biscuit I've ever had so far.\\n\\nThe second dish we got was off the specials menu, which was written on a chalkboard. We got the apple German pancake (also known as a dutch baby), and it came with homemade whipped cream on top. Wow.. The filling turned out to be very similar to an apple pie filling with slices of apple in cinnamon. This went perfectly with the dough of the pancake, which was puffed, soft, and pillowy, yet dense. Even though the pancake looked like it would be very sweet, it was not overwhelmingly so, and it was absolutely delicious!\\n\\nOverall, Bijou Cafe was one of my favorite meals in Portland--the dishes here were nothing all that fancy, but they were so creative in their combination of flavors, and the execution was so on-point!

We walked away full and happy and will be back, often. \\n\\nThe brisket was seasoned well, smoked just right, and very moist, unlike other places that get carried away with the spices to the point it's too hot to eat or you can't taste the meat.  They keep it simple and authentic, which is refreshing.  There are 3 different BBQ sauces, all good (one hot if you're into the numb tongue thing---not me, I want to TASTE my food) but I preferred the sweet one. Their mac and cheese and coleslaw are delish.  Can't speak to the other sides but they looked good and you can choose COBBLER.  Yum.  And why complain about \\"serve yourself\\" sides when that means you can pile it on yourself for the same price getting a much larger portion than if a little bowl was handed to you.  The only thing I could suggest is that they add a \\"green\\" option to their lengthy side list, but that's asking a lot.  Again, this is a BBQ place.  I get it.  \\n\\nAnd one last tip folks: don't EVER, EVER go into a BBQ restaurant in Austin or anywhere else  in Texas for that matter, and ask if the sauce is \\"gluten free\\".

Dinner for three friends that included six tacos, chicken, corn, dessert and two drinks each came to about 120 bucks!  I admit, the drinks were pretty good, especially the humo y fuego which had a nice spicy kick.\\n\\nFrom the outside, it looks pretty non-descript, but once you step inside, it's an explosion of light, color, and noise.  The place is packed with people and the noise level can get a little overwhelming. \\n\\nThe ordering process is a little different as well, similar to ordering sushi.  Once you're seated, the waitress gives the table slips of papers that includes a list of all of the menu items, and you just select what you want.  After you've made your selection, there's a blue card that you insert into a card holder at the front of the table that tells the waitress you're ready.  At first, it seems a little odd, but makes a lot of sense.  I especially liked the idea of just putting up the card when you want your waitress as opposed to having to flag down someone.  \\n\\nItems we tasted include:\\n\\nChips and salsa verde - the \\"chips\\" was presented as one big fried tortilla which was a little weird for me, since it showed how greasy the tortilla was.  \\n\\nhalf rotisserie chicken - which was cooked perfectly, but lacked any pop of seasoning.  There's several bottles of sauce at the table that helped add spice and flavor, but it would have been nice if it was served with a chimichurri sauce or some other sauce.  \\n\\nFor tacos:\\npork belly\\nspicy chorizo (my favorite)\\nsesame ribeye \\n\\ngrilled corn - I've had elote corn before and this doesn't measure up, a little too much mayo or something that kept me from taking more than a couple bites\\n\\nDefinitely save room for dessert.

We arrive around 12:30 and there was plenty of seating available. We didn't have any trouble being seated without a reservation. \\n\\nTo start we each ordered a cup of clam chowder. At $5.50 a cup (or $10 a bowl!) I expected something really good, but instead got relatively bland chowder with a whole lot of potatoes. It wasn't as bad as soup in a can but it sure was overpriced for what it was. Definitely doesn't taste like fresh New England clam chowder though, more like something you get at Red Lobster. \\n\\nOur waitress didn't come back to take our lunch order until we had already finished the soup, and even then we had been done for at least 5 minutes. \\n\\nMy husband wanted to try a few oysters, so the waitress (who was new on the job apparently) recommended a couple and my husband chose a couple others. He also ordered fried shrimp with corn on the cob, while I ordered grilled shrimp with corn as well. I wanted to substitute the cole slaw for cornbread (the sides are the same price) but since the slaw is just a small portion, they wouldn't do it. So I agreed to $4 extra for cornbread and told them just to hold the cole slaw. \\n\\nThe food didn't take long to arrive, but both my corn and the oysters were noticeably absent. My grilled shrimp had some sort of sauce/marinade that wasn't bad (but also wasn't on the menu). I was hoping for plain shrimp. The cornbread was...weird. It looked like it was fried or something, it was not normal and not that great. \\n\\nI had to mention to the waitress that I never got my corn and it was brought to me quickly. We thought maybe the oysters would follow the meal but they never did. We filled up from our meals so we didn't mention them to the waitress, and we didn't get charged, so it's like we never asked for them. \\n\\nWhen we got the check, neither the oysters nor my extra side were on there, which helped make up for the fact that the cornbread (and generally the whole meal) wasn't good. \\n\\nIt's unfortunate, it seems like it could be a good place for a seafood lunch but overall is VERY VERY overpriced and not very tasty.

Toasted chibatta bread with a fried egg, smoked salmon, and caper cream cheese. It also comes with an arugula salad with artichoke, tomato, and red bell people (also with salmon). I would order this EVERY time I go back. It's THAT good. The salmon is fresh, the egg is cooked perfectly (sunny side up with the yolk runny). The arugula salad was a PERFECT compliment to the dish.\\n\\nFricasse ($17)\\nGood dish. It comes with TWO fried eggs, braised short ribs, with some other minor toppings. All of it comes in a bowl where you mix it up and devour it. However, once it's mixed, it got a little too oily for my liking.

Barley Swine did not disappoint. \\n\\nThe kitchen offers one option: a prix fixe seasonal tasting menu of locally-sourced dishes. On this occasion, it was 13 courses for $85 with an optional drink pairing for an additional $45. I decided against the pairing (includes champagne, beer, and wine), but my companions said it was solid. There is an extensive a la carte drink menu as well. \\n\\nThe courses were incredible from start to finish. The plating was gorgeous and the flavor combinations were innovative and bold. The plates were small, a few bites each, but we were all pretty full by the end of the long meal. My top 3 favorite dishes:\\n\\n1. Roast duck breast with turnip cake, cabbage, and rosemary oil. The cut was succulent but not chewy, with a firm, fatty crust and soft pink center. The savory turnip cake was phenomenal. This is one of those dishes you wish you could rewind and eat twice. \\n\\n2. Cold butternut squash soup with pecan curd and bacon. The textures in this dish--crispy ribbons of fried squash, firm chunks of bacon, and creamy softness of miso--keep your palate guessing. The soup is sweet and nutty, accented by the occasional morsel of savory bacon. \\n\\n3. Wagyu beef with sliced green papaya and avocado. A fantastic hot dish with thick slices of tender steak topped with sliced serrano and crushed peanuts on a bed of avocado. This truly showcased the chef's talent for concocting complex flavor and texture profiles. \\n\\nThere weren't any major flops. The blackened octopus terrine was the consensus weakest dish due to its mildness, although I didn't think it was possible for tiny cubes of watermelon to taste so amazing. The shrimpwurst with braised pig skin also didn't wow me as much as the others. In general, I thought the meat and vegetarian courses far outdid the seafood.\\n\\nThe final four courses were all highly creative desserts: a butterkin cake with lemongrass jello, a salted strawberry fig newton, a bon bon with molten peach-yogurt filling, and a frozen candy bar. The latter was the best of the bunch, with a thin caramel-chocolate exterior encrusting rich coffee ice cream. You'll find a surprise or three if you look under your \\"plate.\\" I did find the desserts a little over-saccharine, but you can probably chalk that up to my nonexistent sweet tooth. \\n\\nBeyond the food, the atmosphere certainly enhanced the experience. The d√©cor masterfully evokes a rustic barn-like feel, with faded wood panels throughout and rows of Mason jars containing preserved vegetables and fruits. In keeping with its farm-inspired theme, the attire is casual--jeans will do. The service was top-notch, with pacing that was efficient without being rushed. Three of the seven individuals in our party had dietary restrictions (vegetarian, no pork, no beef) and the kitchen/waitstaff were able to seamlessly integrate their alternate courses without interrupting the flow of the meal. \\n\\nAll in all, I would count Barley Swine as one of the top 10 dining experiences I've ever had. Absolutely worth the lofty price."},{"name":"FLIP burger boutique","address":"1587 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Stopped in for a couple of shakes last night...

Not only was Blue Star a nicer store to visit, with a clean open space and easy visibility of the entire baking and prep process, the inventory looked so much more interesting and enticing. \\n\\nWhere Voodoo donuts were standard donuts made 'special' by slathering them with sugar and crushed up junk food, Blue Star donuts start with a fundamentally different dough recipe - resulting in a lighter, yet somehow more substantial texture and a more pronounced flavor - and then elevate their donuts to the next level with truly innovative flavors.\\n\\nWe split two donuts - Raspberry Rosemary, and Lemon Poppyseed. Both flavors were outstanding and we immediately agreed that Blue Star redeemed the whole donut thing for us.

Also, their \\"ice cold beer\\" is anything but.  When you emblazon \\"ICE COLD BEER\\" on your front window, it had better be ice cold.  Following in the kitschy-folksy-vein, they serve their beer in Mason jars.  That would be fine, except I kept dribbling beer down the front of myself as if I'd been shot up with Novocaine.  Just get some pint glasses.  Jesus.  Then there's the too-loud-for-the-hour \\"eclectic\\" music.  I'm sure we're all impressed that you can meld Tom Waits and Skynyrd seamlessly.  Now turn it the fuck down.  Basically, this place is annoying.  Just serve some food people can stomach and beer in glasses that don't piss beer down your chin like a drunk on a bender.

Other reviews are correct when they warn you to beware of the pizza burn here!  But the pizza is outstanding.  The sauce and sausage are easily the best I've tried in town so far.  The crust tends toward the chewy side, and I'm more of a crispy crust guy, but that's only a minor criticism.  I find that the pizza can be a little sloppy, so it's sometimes hard to pick up a slice and eat it by hand.  I usually saw the small corner off the slice and eat that with a knife and fork, and then pick up the rest.\\n\\nBe aware, it's cash only!  But definitely worth it if you're in the area.

It was delicious. The patty was small in diameter but thick.  I thought it looked small at first but I was completely satisfied and have no complaints about the size. (that's what she said.) LOL, but we also got milkshakes.  The one that I got is no longer on the menu. It was the pineapple upside down cake. I know that they rotate their shake menu, so it is possible it may return.

You won't find many risks or novelties on its menu, but you can guarantee that these classics are finely prepared.\\n\\nWe started with the highly recommended piroshki, which are buttery, flaky, mini crossaint-like pastries with a savory meat filling. They were accompanied by a creamy tarragon butter sauce that was also delicious with the excellent mini French loaf that started our meal.  The lamb shank and veal piccata were our main courses. The shank was an exquisitely hearty portion that is worth a splurge, and the veal piccata was classically prepared with three nicely sized, thin cuts of meat. We rounded out the meal with one of the best creme br√ªl√©e dishes I have had. No bells or whistles, just a classic recipe with a rich, smooth vanilla custard and a perfectly burnt sugar layer on top.\\n\\nGo in with the right mentality. This isn't trying to be the new flashy Midtown hangout with a famous executive chef. This is an established, reliable staple in a Virginia Highlands neighborhood with some history.

We could barely hear ourselves think (forget about having a conversation) and it wasn't just us. The people at the tables on each side of us were yelling just to be heard by their tablemates. As best as I could tell, it's loudest in the middle (where we were sitting) and quieter on the sides of the dining room and they need to get the acoustics under control.\\n\\nSecondly, two out of the three burgers we ordered were fantastic, but the third one was a total mess. It was ordered as medium rare and came out dry and medium-well (more well than medium in my mind). The server never came by the table after the burgers arrived to ask us how there were-in fact, she didn't show up until long after we had finished- so barring starvation, my tablemate decided just to eat it. A bad burger at Flip is still better than 90% of the \\"good\\" burgers in town so he decided to make do. \\n\\nLastly, when she finally arrived back at the table after we were finished, we mentioned to her that burger was over done and she just wandered away and came back with an amended bill with the burger taken off. The person was very embarrassed because he ate the entire thing and didn't want to be the asshole guy who eats something at a restaurant and then complains just so he can have it discounted (he's old school like that).  I ended up going to the manager to ask that the burger be added back to the bill and at that point the manager wanted to give us free shakes or something...all in all the server and the manager weren't very good at reading the situation. Honestly, the server could have asked if we wanted the burger taken off and then we could have refused and then she could have thanked us for our feedback and told us she'd follow-up with the kitchen so it wouldn't happen again. Done and done. Simple. \\n\\nIt didn't have to be quite the to-do that it turned into. I know it seems weird to complain about being offered a discount when the food wasn't cooked to order, but it just seemed that nobody was taking the time to listen, to comprehend and think and then interact with us in a way that made the dining experience enjoyable.

Two friends and I came here for a catch up session over a meal. Like the usual Korean restaurant, you get service by buzzing the button on the side of the tables. The interior still had the same layout of the restaurant it used to be, except everything was cleaned up and is nice and modernized. They brought us the menus and a jug of (literal) iced tea. I'm almost certain it was genmaicha, but it being iced versus the traditional hot tea was SO refreshing.\\n\\nWe decided to get the galbi samgyeopsal, bulgogi, and the ddok mandu gook. All the food comes straight out of the kitchen, so unfortunately we don't have a legit Korean BBQ in the area just yet. That being said though, you won't be leaving the restaurant with smoke lingering in your clothes. It came out relatively quick along with the banchan. They had quite a few choices of side dishes including several kimchis, a few pickled dishes, fish cake, and a salad (some items are refillable so don't be afraid to ask). The samgyeopsal and bulgogi come out in scalding hot cast iron pans with some vegetables under it. The samgyeopsal had a nice bite to it, and the bulgogi was nice and sweet. However, my only issue with it was that since we don't have the choice of how well cooked it is, they both lacked that \\"crispness\\" that you get from cooking it on top a traditional grill. The gook came in a bowl served with nori, egg, rice cakes, beef, and dumplings. The rice cakes were nice and tender, but the mandu were a bit too overcooked and started falling apart when we tried to pick at it. Everything in the bowl came out a bit too peppery for my liking, but I can't say that with certainty since I'm not sure if it's because I don't know the food culture or if it was actually just too peppery.\\n\\nThe service here is very kind and thankfully it wasn't too busy when we first came in. The price of it however is kind of steep, but if I'm being honest, it probably equals about the same if not less than driving out to PoCo for Korean food.

My brother had his reservations about the menu since he's more of just a classic burger type guy. After convincing him to take a leap of faith he ordered the Philly burger, fries and a hot chocolate milkshake. By the end of dinner, all that was left on his plate was the cup the ketchup came in. He loved the burger and the mushrooms on it was just an added bonus. I ordered the Gyro burger which was great. The burger was cooked to perfection. The bun was toasted nicely, and the flavors were great. The things I  didn't like were the vodka battered onion rings and the hot chocolate milkshake. The onion rings were battered nicely. I just didn't think they taste good. The milkshake had an explosion of cinnamon which was just too much for our taste. The menu was a little pricey. Sides were an added price, and the cheapest milkshake was $5. I will say though its definitely worth the price.\\n\\nThe atmosphere is what you expect for the Howell Mill area. It has a funky, edgy, alternative type feel. All of what Richard Blais is about. The dining room is small. It only has a  couple of booths and a couple of tables pushed together to make one long table. It wasn't busy, but if it was, I can imagine that we would all  probably have to sit together.

My wife and I stopped by for Sunday brunch and the parking lot was filled, but our arrival coincided with one vehicle's prompt departure, so timing favored us. The line of customers waiting to be seated was long but, if you chose one of the frequently overlooked small tables near the entry, you may be seated promptly. These are small tables, and some would find that uncomfortable. In a crowded restaurant, noise can make conversation difficult, especially with a screaming child nearby. The Babica Hen has redesigned the floorspace (since La Provence) to improve the economy of space. \\nService was prompt and attentive; my coffee cup was never actually empty before it was refilled, and I appreciate that. Our server was very pleasant, despite the hectic pace of a full house, and I appreciated that even more. \\nWe ordered breakfast, since we'd overlooked it earlier, and I enjoyed my eggs, toast, potatoes and bacon. My wife ordered a Belgian waffle with a flavorful, sweet syrup, and a side of fruit. We enjoyed our breakfasts very much and look forward to our return. Yes, I recommend The Babica Hen Cafe for breakfast, brunch or lunch. It is locally popular, so expect lines, a 10-15 minute wait and close proximity between tables.

While the food is fairly similar to some Indian cuisines that are very popular, Gurkha brings its own Himalayan touches to the menu, so I suggest everyone give it a shot.\\n\\nI went with a friend and we got a bit of everything. We tried their teas - the masala tea was a nice milky chai-type drink, and the Tibetan tea was rich in dairy in a peculiar yet delicious way I've never really tasted in tea before. We also got the phuraula, which are actually spherical lentil paste balls seasoned and fried and served with a flavourful dipping sauce. They were great fun to eat, and one order of them is plenty for two.\\n\\nOur entrees were the himali chicken, which comes with a wonderfully creamy curry-like sauce that goes great with rice, and the lamb chili, which is one of the best-tasting meat dishes I've had in a long time and comes with onions and nicely crunchy peppers as well. I don't know what's in the lamb chili sauce, but it tastes amazing. The staff also kindly asked us how spicy we wanted it, and we got both dishes at medium, which felt like the perfect heat.\\n\\nWe also had a steamed bread roll, which came with its own dip but was great for eating bits of the meat dishes as well, and both entrees came with a reasonably modest portion of rice and a small amount of salad nicely topped with mango sauce. For dessert we split a dish of kheer, which was a simple, coconuty take on rice pudding with some mild spices and raisins that I really enjoyed.\\n\\nThe inside of the restaurant, up on the second floor, is small but feels very cozy, and we got a bright window seat overlooking the rooftop in front of the building, which is covered in a lovely layer of moss.

( Mostly gloppy cheese on crust that had the consistency of wet cardboard ! )  But decided to dine in with friends a few nights ago.   I will say that they prepared an excellent dinner salad for an additional $2.25 added on to the price of my entree.   ....And that's the only positive thing I can report.   Eggplant parmigiana was decidedly mushy and completely unseasoned.   There were virtually no italian spices in the pasta/marinara sauce.    My dinner companions split a stromboli which was better.   But if you wanted sauce with that,  you had to pay an additional dollar.  ( And this was scribbled on the menu after they had struck a line through the stromboli description that stated \\" sauce is included \\" !! )   Had the egglant parm been good,  it would have been worth the $11.95 but, again, it was so bland and mushy that it was a total non-event.  The waitress was overly solicitous ( we were the only patrons in the place on a Monday night ... ) but,  to her credit,  when I told her that the eggplant parm was not very good after having been asked,  she did ask if I wanted to substitute something else for it.

See the review from Kelley M (which I now wish I would have read before coming here)?  That was pretty much us as well.\\n\\nThe wife and I came by after work on a Saturday around 5:30.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that the place wasn't packed (half full at the most).  The restaurant is located in a small strip mall at the corner of SW Terwilliger and SW Barbur, and is roughly a mile from our house.  We've gone to Chez Jose in the past, and while our experience there has been fine (nothing great, but the food there is OK), we were hoping to find something new near our home.  \\n\\nThe restaurant seems fairly small from the outside, but once you go inside, it's actually fairly decent size.  The host/manager took us through the back of the restaurant through the lounge area (which seemed nice enough), and seated us in a private booth in the back (just outside the lounge).  The waiter brought us our complimentary chips and salsa (which were fine), and then took our drink orders.  As the place wasn't really all that full, I was a bit surprised that it took so long for our drinks to arrive (a bit over 10 minutes), but when they came they were fine as well (have had better and much worse margaritas - they do a decent job here).  At that point the young, friendly waiter took our food order, and the wife and I then chatted a bit over our drinks.  Again, I was a bit surprised that it took so long for our food to arrive (we ordered some happy hour nachos, some tostados and enchilada plate, so nothing complex or complicated).  After around 15 minutes or so, the waiter came back to see how we were doing, and to advise us that our food was coming momentarily.  We were hungry, so this was good news.  While he was there, I figured I better order another round of margaritas.  The margaritas arrived about 5 minutes later, but not our food.  And so we commenced to wait.  My wife finally got up to ask the manager what was going on with our food order.  Again, we were told it would be out momentarily.  We waited another 15 minutes, whereupon the waiter once again came by our table to tell us our food would be ready shortly.  He apologized, noting the kitchen had had to handle a large party and so was backed up.   But not to worry, our food would be right out.  This was such obvious BS (there were no large parties in the restaurant), and I told him he'd previously lied to us about that (our food coming right away), so why in the world should we believe him now?  We told him to bring us our check so we could get out of there (which took almost another 15 minutes).  \\n\\nTalk about a weird experience.  Like Kelley M., it seemed like the owners could care less about our dining experience (or lack of one).  No one said a word to us about our experience (in fact, I got the impression this was something of a normal experience here), they just presented us with the bill for the margaritas, ran our card and adios.

They are stroller friendly and have 1 highchair - now that I'm a new mom, I notice these things.\\n\\nAs for the food, I LOVE their waffles. The chocolate lavender dip is the best- my friend doubted me and ordered the dark chocolate but when he tried my dip, he was instantly in love and wanted to trade.  My favorite entree is the saumon fume, very good flavors and well priced.  The portion size is good for me but for the hungrier folks, they can add a side of their bacon which is very good too. I've had some of their other dishes like the Le Peameal (thinking it would have the same bacon they give you as a side, but no, its different) and Fricassee but those dishes weren't that great.\\n\\nAs for the drinks, their Lavendar Latte is OK if you like Lavendar.

I've been coming back to this place since. The naans are seriously one of the best in the biz. They are soft, supple and ever so tasty when strewn in with some coconut flakes and other condiments. I can just eat the naans as a meal all by themselves. My philosophy is that if a place serves you good appetizers, their main courses cannot be that far off. And I was right!

FYI Wait peoples of the world -- if your table is talking amongst themselves about another establishment, don't tell them how much that place sucks in great detail because they would only hire you as a bus person not a waiter. This is especially true if you are a bad waiter, never refill bevies, forget half of our order and make inappropriate comments through out the meal... \\n\\nAlso, if you are the hostess, don't only greet the male patrons and completely ignore the female ones. Also, don't complain for 5 minutes about a co-worker to your friend while a paying customer stands in front of you waiting to ask a question. \\n\\nOkay enough of that. The food. The best entree of the night was the parm crusted sole. It was crispy, appropriately salty and yummy. Kung Pao Calamari, good heat but got soggy quickly because the plate had too much stuff going on.

It's funny, because the first time I came here with my husband, we had some stuff that was incredibly high-level (I have not had fish as good as the fish I had here, and I am including fish prepared by my grandma in that comparison: steamed and then flash-fried yellowtail snapper garnished with candied kumquats - seriously, that was the best preparation of fish that I've ever had) and a couple of things that were pretty okay, and one really disappointing dish (genmai fried rice, which had a mysteriously gritty texture). I noted all of this on the comment card, not expecting anything to come of it. Then, if I didn't get a really nice e-mail back from Joanne Chang herself-- who is totally my hero as someone who was all \\"up yours, business world, I am making baked goods instead\\" and also \\"I am making not just baked goods, but THE BEST baked goods\\" and also really accessible via Twitter and her cooking demonstrations and the like, even to excitable nerds such as myself--who promised that we'd get a good version of the genmai fried rice, and indeed we did get a very delicious bowl of genmai fried rice the next time we came in. Since then, it tends to be a place that is gone to for an occasion that is special.\\n\\nMy favorite are the short rib tacos, the savory, almost candy-like pork spareribs that dissolve as you pick them up off of the serving plate, the dan dan noodles (they're unlike any other dan dan noodles that I've had, but still really tasty and I daresay refreshing), but on the past couple of visits, I think my favorite thing is the spicy silky tofu, not unlike mapo tofu but even better. The miso-glazed carrots are a don't-even-consider-missing-it item, and their scallion pancake? Me gusto!!! Also, the homemade sodas are great. I don't drink booze, so I needn't feel like a wiener roast sipping a Coke while the big kids have cocktails, not when I have a tasty, fancily-adorned glass of lychee-vanilla bean soda in my paw!\\n\\nI understand that there have been some staffing changes recently, so I'm writing this now before my husband and I stop by next week on our anniversary. Since nobody is piping up about \\"man, the quality of this inauthentic hipster Chinese place has gone WAY DOWN, man,\\" then I assume that quality is still great. Another thing that I've noticed is that every time we go, all of the people working there seem like they're genuinely happy to be there, even if it's crazy-busy and it seems like literally all hands are on deck. Think about the last time you went out to eat and had your table waited on by someone who seemed genuinely enthusiastic and happy to be working, not just going through the motions of rolling off the night's specials and wishing that they were somewhere else. That's what makes this a five-star joint to me: while the food can run from three-star (at worst) to five-star (at best) quality, I believe that this is a very well-run business deserving of my time and dining-out dollars. They take feedback very seriously, they prepare food very well, and they seem to be doing right by their employees. And yes, I feel instantly much cooler than I actually am when I walk in the door: there are thoughtful details like the placemats made out of Chinese newspapers, buckets of chopsticks to suit your material preference, and a visually stylish Blade Runner-esque atmosphere: someone obviously cares a lot of about the details of creating an atmosphere, and it works really well! I don't often get the feeling when I go out to eat that I'm in a place that's not only striving to make money, but also striving to make sure that they deserve it.\\n\\nFinally, for as much as some people will crap on this place because it's not serving traditional/authentic/cheap Chinese fare, I think they've missed the point. It's not trying to be any or every Chinese restaurant, so by all means, go to Chinatown if that's what you want (people seem to love that refrain here on Yelp when it comes to M + C). It's not even trying to be a Taiwanese place. It's an Asian fusion restaurant, which is usually the kiss of death in my opinion, but it's a fusion restaurant that actually manages to fuse S/E/SE Asian cuisine with Western food incredibly well. Sure, it's not cheap, but I don't think they're trying to pretend otherwise.

I've had fried chicken in Asia, Europe, USA, I've had fried chicken that is famous and expensive (Hattie's in NY, Willie May's Scotch House in NOLA) but Gus's is the best. The place is a tiny little corner restaurant located downtown. The inside gives you this Southern family picnic vibe. The chicken is fried in peanut oil, giving it a unique flavor, the skin ends up being perfectly thin and really crispy. The meat is very incredibly juicy, even for the breasts, which are usually dry. The chicken comes only in spicy (as the fried chicken gods intended) but it is not too spicy its just the right amount that balances a juicy salty taste with a notch above just a \\"kick\\" of heat. I always get the three piece white and it is an insane value, especially for DT Austin or any restaurant in general. Two breasts, a wing, slice of bread, and two sides for $10 bucks is more than fair in my book. \\n\\nSides... I hate coleslaw. Usually when something comes with coleslaw I'll just throw it away (not worth the calories). Gus's....I gave their coleslaw a shot, I actually like it. Is this how coleslaw is supposed to taste?

It's not fancy and it's not dumpy.  \\n\\nThe \\"house\\" chardonnay wine was $9 a glass.  Are you kidding me?  I pay $7.50 to $8 a glass at Alma Nove....$6.50 or less at the '99 and $8 or less everywhere else.  A friend ordered Beringer rose and she paid $8 for a named wine, even if it is rose, it was less than my house chardonnay.  My friend had fried scallops, also cut in half.  He was not happy at all with that.  He also had a Tangueray and tonic and paid $10, much higher than he is used to.  We often decide whether or not to return to a place based on how fair they are with the alcohol prices.  \\n\\nWe won't be back here for a long while....but that's not the only reason.... . They have NO POTATO except FRENCH FRIES....are you serious (no baked; no mashed)?  NO COOKED VEGETABLE (just a salad or cole slaw).  These are FAST FOOD RESTAURANT options.  Just couldn't believe it.  For the prices you pay, you should have a real option on the starch side and a real cooked vegetable.\\n\\nOn the plus side, there is a common table where you can join others.  Nice idea, but on a Sat. night at 6:30P, it was still empty and it holds at least 15 people.  None of the high chairs either at the bar or at the common table had backs....none of us liked that.  The view is really nice; location is a little out of the way, but not bad for us because we live less than 15 minutes away.  We ate at the bar and the service was friendly and available....good job you guys!  The bottom line is that we won't be running back to this place and, it's a shame because it's so close to us!"},{"name":"Hopdoddy Burger Bar","address":"1400 S Congress Ave, Ste A190","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"yeah. hopdoddy is a meh. there's a half dozen better (and cheaper) burgers on south congress alone. my friend and i got the llano poblano and the el diablo (which are essentially the same burger, actually). you'd think with all that peppery cheese and roasted poblanos they'd be able to get a better, more robust, flavor into their burgers. but they don't. although the meat was moist, the burgers were actually pretty dry and just generally unimpressive - especially at the price.\\n\\npros: good beer, even got to drink it while i stood in line to order; the meat tasted very fresh; the fries were above average and probably hand-cut.\\n\\ncons: the burger was dry and rather bland; pricey"},{"name":"Xian Sushi and Noodle","address":"1801 E 51st St","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Our server Tania was outstanding!

The peppers were slimy, a few rotten pieces of lettuce, 3 blocks of cheese that I barely found and the worst surprise saved itself for last when I gagged up a piece of chicken jelly..WTF? Changing my rating from a 5 to 3..Because that's no bueno.

There are three options; we chose the \\"long walk on the beach\\". Each pre-set option caters to different dietary needs, so this restaurant gets some extra points there. The oysters came with a wonderful mint ice; it was a unique experience for me. The dan dan noodles had wonderful flavor, and it was a decent portion for two people. The stuffed trout was delicious - everything was cooked well, and the flavor profile was awesome. My favorite item though was the miso glazed carrots. They were downright fantastic! It was a large portion, and I kept eating them even though I was stuffed. The flavor was sweet, savory, and strong. It was a wonderful side dish. This pre-set meal was definitely enough food for two people.\\n\\nSo while the atmosphere, food, and drinks met my expectations, the service fell flat. Our waitress was unfriendly, had vacant stares and conversations with us, and wasn't a good seller of the restaurant menu.

He apologized & quickly went & had my drink replaced. My new drink came, & even though my friend & I already totally lost our appetite already, we played nice & continued on with our meal. The bartender must have thought making my drink stronger would completely make me forget what just happened...ummm yeah.  Next, we were brought out 2 rolls & 2 pieces of cornbread & 2 (dirty) bread plates. Luckily, it's tough to screw up bread so the rolls were warm & good.  I wish I would've known at that moment that the rolls would be the last warm part of the meal we'd experience & I would've stuck with eating all rolls all night.  As we were awaiting our $11.50 lobster pot stickers, we both starting nibbling on this weird yellowish/greyish colored cornbread.  The cornbread literally tasted worse than cardboard & was cold & hard...so we immediately stopped.  Ten minutes later, our lobster pot stickers arrived.  Following the cold theme of the night, our 6 pot stickers were ice cold.  I thought, at least these involve lobster so they must taste decent. I took my first bite & was overwhelmed with wayyyy too much soy sauce & ginger flavor, so much so that it's virtually impossible to tell what kind of crumbles of meat is in this thing.  They grind (what they call) lobster into mush almost like tuna fish and put the smallest amount of crumbs in each lobster pot sticker...so disappointing!  When you cut open the pot sticker, looking at these teeny tiny crumbs of meat inside, you can barely (if at all) tell it's lobster.  To tell the truth, it truly looked more like imitation crabmeat.  There was so much soy & ginger flavoring that nobody would be able to tell the difference. My friend immediately hated them, mainly because they were so ice cold, but also due to the odd, \\"non-lobster\\" flavor of these things.  We were done with the app.....& waited....& waited.....& waited even more for our entrees to come. We waited almost 25-30 friggin' minutes for our entrees to finally come out.  She ordered the $20 lobster roll & I ordered the $32 clambake.  They arrive to our table...you guessed it, ice cold!  Ughhhh.....can this get any worse?!?!?  My friend's lobster roll had that ground-up, mushy (whats they call) lobster with wayyyyy too much mayo mixed in that it all looked white in color then the New England kiss of death for a lobster roll -lots of lettuce and celery.  This was served with a pile of home made looking potato chips that were ice cold & lacked any sort of crunch due to how long they had probably been sitting out in the kitchen.  Onto my clambake, that per the menu, was to come with 1 1lb chicken lobster, steamers, mussels, potatoes, chourico and corn - sounded good on paper - how bad can you possibly screw up steaming basic lobster and stuff.  I have gotten a good number of clambakes in my past and warned my friend it will probably look like an obscene amount of food, but it's usually more bang for your buck.  My plate ends up being the smallest clambake I had ever seen in my life. It all fit on an average-sized dinner plate.  Not only was the size highly disappointing, but it was, like everything else, ice cold.  This sad clambake was entirely overcooked & came with 5 small steamers (3 smashed, shell pieces strewn about), 5 mussels, 1 tiny red potato, 1 hard cold literal bite of chourico, 1 small lobster & corn on the cob. The steamers/mussels were rubbery & lobster so overcooked the meat came out in crumbs.\\n\\nThe bill came to $78 & I so wished we had used it elsewhere.

I didn't think we would get in because it was a Saturday night, but we were pleasantly surprised that we were sat immediately. The place was definitely cute, and as we sat down, the rest of the table was getting up and cooed about the stupendous culinary treat we were about to indulge.\\n\\nWhen we were greeted by the hostess, we explained that there was a shellfish allergy that we needed to restrict crab, shrimp and the like. The server reiterated this restriction and said sit back, relax, and we're gonna feed you.\\n\\nI have to say, we're total foodies, and we've eaten all around the world, so we may not be the easiest of diners to impress, however, even small food trailer trucks have received 5 star ratings at the elevation and quality of the meals that they've served.\\n\\nThe first dish came out, and it was a caviar taco which was cute and tiny. It was fine, nothing amazing. The next dish came out, and it was a Japanese inspired cold dish with mackeral and various ingredients to eat with a spoon and it was cold, refreshing and very delectable. A+. Now I was excited for the rest of the meal--especially paying $100 each for the meal ($80 + Tip each).\\n\\nThe next dish was a porridge type dish with quail egg. Warm, and sophisticated, it was a treat. Really really loved.\\n\\nThe next was a pork type dish that was good. This is where it went down hill for us. The next dish was brought out and clearly explained to us as a dish with two 'SHRIMP' dumplings atop, and for us to enjoy. Clearly, my date would not be able to enjoy shrimp without her epi pen :) So we had to call the server back to take the shrimp dumplings back. While I ate mine, I was done with my small dish by the time they brought hers back, and all they did was remove it. There was no 'replacement dumpling' which is quite a poor representation of honoring dietary restrictions. While 'chef apologizes' sufficed, we also had to ask for another fork, as she had touched the dumpling with the fork. The lack of attention to detail and service in a menu costing $80/head was pretty disappointing.\\n\\nThe next dish came out, and as he explained and we looked, I was completely let down because he brought out the dish we had just had two dishes ago. We looked at him and said, it looks great, but we've already had this. He apologized and took the dishes and sat them down in front of the couple sitting next to us.\\n\\nThe rest of the dishes honestly were pushing my limits of flavor combination and technique which was ultimately a huge let down. Foie gras jelly donut? When I cut into the donut, the gray foie gras squirted out, and the flavor combo personally to me was disgusting.\\n\\nThe last four dishes were sweet, which I'm not sure if that's usual or not, but I was not completely satisfied by the savory portion, so wasn't really ready for the sweets, and I'm a total dessert person.\\n\\nOverall, I felt that the cost of this meal did not correlate to the service nor the feeling of satisfaction at the end of the meal, and I would have enjoyed much more the culinary creations of say, 'Uchiko' knowing that $100 would definitely fill me up, be beautiful artistry, and service that made me feel like attention was paid on every detail of my experience.\\n\\nI hope this helps Barley Swine adjust/train staff in order to stay competitive in a growing foodie scene that is Austin."},{"name":"Thierry","address":"1059 Alberni Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"Stopped hear to try the macarons-I've had Thomas Haas on my list for ages, but the location just isn't convenient for me-finally, something promising opens in my own 'hood!\\n\\nUnfortunately, they didn't live up to my expectations.

It actually comes with crab and shrimp as well, but the shrimp was overcooked & rubbery. There were several shells in the dish and it was flavorless & very greasy.

It overpowered the taste of the burger. However, this is just my opinion - my roommate got the same exact burger and that was her favorite part of it.\\n\\nOther bad things was that this place was crazy loud - not conversations but the music they were playing. It was mid-day on a Sunday and I felt like I was in a bar.

If you order a water, you get a super small cup for tap water. I like hydration, I'm not cheap. I spent $24 on two burgers, a small fry, and a milkshake - with tip, I spent $26. I feel like if I want to drink water with my meal, I should get a normal sized cup.

Although I've written off the Weidler Koji's (after years of faithful patronage) because of a sudden drop in quality and portion size, I thought perhaps this shop might be different. I was sorely mistaken. \\nFirst, I walked into this surprisingly large establishment, passing through a jet of hot air, scented with the stink of old fryer oil blasting from their kitchen ventilation outlet overhead. I then join my friends at a booth with sticky benches and a table uncomfortably wide for the space, forcing me to awkwardly squeeze my way in (and I am of medium/slender build). My friends had their sights on some happy hour prices (we arrived with 15 minutes remaining), but although we were one of only two tables in the joint, the waitress took over 15 minutes to seek us out. Then she tried to tell us that we had missed happy hour (and was rather pissed off that I insisted that no, we had not). \\nSo, we put in our order, but despite the menu saying \\"see wine and sake list for sake offerings, there was no list to be found. The waitress was mystified, and took another 15 minutes to return with one (during which time she came by with a wine list that, alas, featured no sake). Turns out that the cheapest bottle of sake they had was over $40! So I opted for a piping hot little pitcher of their house sake (which, I was told, they were incapable of serving at any temperature but screaming hot). Fine. \\nFood arrives. Gyoza were very nicely cooked, but were of Costco quality - pasty and relatively tasteless. Angry dragon was very tasty, as was the rainbow roll and the spicy tuna roll. But, just like the Weilder shop, this Koji's has gone miniaturized. The rolls were barely half the size (and thus offered half the volume of ingredients) that they once were. now, I clearly understand cost control. But as a customer I would rather pay a little more than be served munchkin-sized portions. Still, I must give kudos for the flavor of the rolls. The gyoza on the other hand, I would advise against. \\nThe real pisser to this whole event though was the waitress. As she took our order she announced that she was hoping to get off her shift, but now had to stay to serve us. Her attitude deteriorated from the moment I asked to see the elusive sake list to when I asked if we could have some plates for our food (as we were sharing all our dishes), to when I had to go looking for her to ask if we might have another round of beverages. By the time we got our check and were ready to leave (busting our way through that stink-jet at the front door), she was clearly in a foul mood. If were up to me I'd have left her a dollar, just to make a point (which I'm sure would have escaped her). But my friends insisted on picking up the check, and I'm sure they rewarded her handsomely. Oh well. \\nSo, the moral of the story is that, as is the case with the Weidler Koji's, I won't be visiting this establishment again.

I went there with my mom on a busy Saturday night. We were given a 1-1.5 hour wait time for a table for two, so we decided to pass the time by getting a drink at their bar. \\n\\nThe bartenders were very attentive and made for a fantastic experience. As soon as we approached the crowded bar area, we were handed menus, and had drinks within 5 minutes. We both had a margarita (which my mom can be very particular about) and they were delicious! No sour mix - just high quality ingredients. We were lucky about 10 minutes later to snag seats at the bar, and we decided to stay put and eat there. I'm so glad we did! We ended up having such a great night and I can't say enough about it!\\n\\nWe continued to receive great service. The charcuterie dishes we ordered - marinated olives, Mahon cheese, and shrimp arrived quickly and were flavorful. After that, we ended up getting the Paella Mariscos and we clearly did not know what we were getting ourselves into! The pan was HUGE and loaded with mussels, clams, prawns,sausage, chorizo, and more! We hardly made a dent in it, so we ended up with a lot of leftovers (yum!). \\n\\nMy favorite part of the night was when one of the bartenders got up on the bar with a bottle of wine, and went around the bar pouring some into peoples mouths!

At the young age of 8, while some kids wanted to have a Papa Gino's or Chucky Cheese pizza birthday party I was begging my parents to go to Santarpios. In the last decade there have been some \\"improvements\\" like the additional menu items like steak tips and broccoli or shrimp pizza toppings and some updated decor but I miss the wine taps, local crowd and the gerber baby food jar cheese and pepper shakers, a plus is that staples like Tony and his \\"flair\\" or Lefty working the grille are still there.\\n\\nThe BBQ is the best you'll get for the price, Lamb is always juicy and cooked just right as is the house made sausage that has a kick of black pepper both available in a combo along with some true crusty italian bread and some Pastene cherry peppers. The steak tips, eh its just plain average steak tips, nothing worth ordering.\\n\\nThe Pizza is by far some of the best in Boston and New England, higher on my list than Frank Pepe's or Gran Gusto's and on par with Galleria Umberto's but two completely different styles of pizza. You can never go wrong with a Cheese pizza here although some of my favorites would be Peperoni & Onion and Sausage & Garlic White, try them and you'll thank me. \\nThe Fork and Knife are there for the pizza because its old school italian, In Italy you get your own pizza and you eat it with a fork and knife, this is also the only way to start eating it right out of the oven without burning your mouth. Also for anyone who says the bottom of the pizza is soggy sometimes, order it Well Done, its the way they used to always cook it but the typical americanized pizza lover would say that its burnt or over cooked.\\n\\nWhat makes the Santarpios Pizza steps above the rest? Simple they have a style all their own, no where else do they make a pizza in this way.\\nThey make their own dough in house, they shred their mozzarella from huge blocks every day and they heat up (Not cook) Pastene Ground peeled tomatoes with nothing added to it. \\nNow all those things make a pizza a good pizza but what makes them stand out is how its assembled. Course ground corn meal down, Dough spread out by hand, toppings if any down first, THEN the cheese and THEN the Sauce on the very top, Sprinkle a little romano over that and pop it in the oven at 550F.

The chef/owner has an impressive resume. We had great service: knowledgeable about food, attentive to a friend who didn't feel well, helpful on wine selection and willing to split a check based on our purchases. The dill pickle soup is an acquired taste. My wife disliked it. I thought it interesting but not the greatest ever. My wife didn't like her wiener schnitzel. Since we usually have it on a cruise ship we like, it could be this was right and the other an adaptation. She liked her bratwurst.  I had zigeunerschnitzel which is nontraditional but full flavored; also very rich. Vegetable sides were very good, even the steamed (or boiled) spinach which I never liked before. My wife loved her eclairs. The special egg nog cheese cake was not as flavorful as I hoped. As you leave many other pastries are for sale by the cash register in case you need to be tempted further.

This place sprung out of the head of a truly visionary culinary craftsman, Bryce Gilmore, who was prominently present in his open kitchen cooking and overseeing every plate.  I was informed by the restaurant's manager, Jason, that Bryce is also in charge of obtaining all the ingredients for his dishes and uses seasonal local products whenever possible.  The menu was in one instance changed three times within the same day, causing a last-minute rush to the print shop, governed by Bryce's spontaneous creative whim and ingredients on hand.  \\n\\nJason (formerly at Wink) is in charge of stocking the \\"pub\\" with the beer and wine selections, which is also a revolving selection.  Jason chose a nice balance for the 8 beer taps, between local brews (512, Real Ale, Independence and Austin's newest addition, Jester King - I tried the well balanced hoppy ale) and microbrews from other states (California's North Coast Thelonious - a Belgian style ale with a nice hint of berry).  The draft beers come in 12 oz. pilsner glasses, but somehow they look like half the size of a standard 16 oz. pint.   \\n\\nOn to the food.  The fried brussel sprouts.  Adding capers to this dish was genius. Mmmmm. The broccoli dish with ricotta.  Mmmmm.  The pasta stuffed with whipped potato, smoked trout and egg, garnished with bits of apple.  Unbelievable.  The combined flavors of smoky chorizo and grilled baby octopus.  Delightfully tasty.  The cheese plate (should be renamed to \\"beet and cheese\\", as there were equal portions of both) - the beets were sweet with hints of cherry, and the combined forkful of beets and cheese popped in my mouth.  The potato, goat cheese and leek fritters were amazingly creamy yet light.  The clam chowder soup was sinfully creamy and buttery with bits of seafood and clams-in-the-shell.  The pecan ice cream coffee porter float was the perfect ending to a meal I didn't want to end.  \\n\\nMmmmmmmmmm!\\n\\nTip: Arrive after 9 pm week nights for less of a wait, or after 10 pm on weekends.

Yes, the wait can be crazy, especially if you go during peak hours on a weekend, but if you can swing it into your schedule to go after the lunch hour on a weekday, you'll pretty much walk right back to the counter. Even when there's a wait, you can get free cucumber water or whatever you want from the bar while you're in line. Speaking of the bar, the cocktail menu is really interesting, with some oddities (the mostly beet Bloody Mary is good, but probably not preferable to a regular tomato juice one) and several really great cocktails (such as the Bubbly Blonde).\\n\\nI think the only burgers I haven't had are the K-Town Belly (it's a pretty new addition), El Diablo (I love spicy food, but I'm worried it might be too much), and La Bandita (I'm sorry, but there's no way I'm going to order a back bean burger at a famous Texas burger joint). Anyway, every burger I have had has been off-the-charts amazing. The patties are juicy and perfectly cooked, the buns are fresh, warm, and buttery, and the flavor combinations in all of the signature burgers are superb. I honestly cannot pick favorites, but The Magic Shroom, The Terlingua, The Goodnight, and the Llano Poblano are all great. The Ahi Tuna Burger is also a standout, with a huge, delicious slab of tuna and a wonderful combination of teriyaki, wasabi, and ginger. \\n\\nIf you're visiting Austin, don't miss it, and if you live here, just try to go sometime other than High Lunch Hour or Saturday evening at 7."},{"name":"FLIP burger boutique","address":"1587 Howell Mill Rd","city":"Atlanta","stars":"4","text":"Came for a late lunch with one of my foodie friends and I enjoyed it.

It kind of reminds me of a better version of a streak and shake burger. The sweet potato tots were decent but I liked the onion rings better. I could have done without the Krispy Kreme shake because 1) it was very small and not worth the price and 2) I didn't really get a Krispy Kreme taste from it.

This restaurant has a great vibe as soon as you walk in. We sat upstairs at a round table which had plenty of space for us, platters of food, drinks, etc (I hate being squished when it comes to a proper dinner). The Chef sent an amuse bouche six ceviche spoons, one gulp of deliciousness to get us started. Thanks Chef! Next we had a seafood tower, snow crab, lobster, prawns, oysters, clams, mussels, served dramatically with dry ice. I'm sure I've missed something... but you get the idea. Next we had 2 platters of sushi rolls. If you've eaten sushi at the average Vancouver sushi joint, it's probably a bargain and quite ok but if you go to Coast you get the freshest fish made by the best sushi chefs who pride themselves on their art which was apparent with the presentation of rainbow rolls and beautiful sushi cones on our platters. Absolutely gorgeous, we practically licked the platters clean. We joked that the owner should keep his sushi chefs under lock and key as soon as their shift is over. I had more snow crab for my main accompanied by a caesar salad, which is served in a half wedge style and other mains at the table were halibut on a bed of pea puree risotto, seared tuna, steamed clams, and striploin steak. Each and every dish received raves although I didn't get to taste them all (sad face). We started with a wonderful viogner and a pinot noir to follow, sorry I didn't order the wine and was too busy chatting to read the labels. Finally we had a wonderful platter of dessert put together for us and the standout on the platter was a homemade crunchie bar that brought back a taste of childhood for me. Wrapped up with a final brandy and we were done like dinner. Our server Trevor, as well as managers Manny, Sarah, and many others really made our evening a pleasant treat.

Instantly walking in I smelled the savory aromas of homestyle soul food, a welcoming and warm scent.\\n\\nGus' Fried Chicken is located in downtown Austin in pretty hip part of town, so it's cool to see such a simple establishment in rather urban setting.\\n\\nThe menu here offers a selection of different platters, ranging from dark to white meat and varying numbers of pieces, I ordered the three piece platter of dark meat which comes with 2 thighs and 1 leg. Additionally each platter comes with bread, slaw and beans (the sides can be substituted for $0.50 each) I decided to switch the beans and slaw for Mac' and cheese and collared greens.\\n\\nThe food was really delicious, the chicken itself was crispy and had a little kick to it, but not overly spicy. Thighs and legs both had a nice juiciness to them, however I preferred the thigh in terms of taste, it was slightly more flavorful. I can still hear myself proclaiming mid-meal how much better this fried chicken was in comparison to other fast food chains. The breaking had a satisfying crispness to it that you are hard pressed to find in other fried chicken places. \\nFor the sides, I really enjoyed the collared greens, which had excellent seasoning to them. The Mac' and cheese was average and I didn't eat the side piece of bread either. The star of the meal is definitely the chicken.\\n\\nOverall, Gus' is a solid place for some good chicken that doesn't try to do more than it can. Good food that is true to its roots and offers nothing more than flavor and satisfaction."},{"name":"Anna Bannanas NW","address":"1214 NW 21st Ave","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"Absolutely love this place.

I came here for lunch with my coworker and the service was so poor neither of us wants to come back for the amazing tacos. \\n\\nIt was not a particularly busy lunch service for them, and it took almost 10 minutes for the wait staff to bring water and menus to us. \\nWhen we ordered drinks, a different staff member brought them out and went to a few tables asking around since she did not know she was supposed to bring them to our table.\\nWhen taking our order, the waiter asked if we wanted separate checks, and we said separate. \\n\\nWhen our food arrived, I thought one of my tacos was missing as I thought I ordered 5 and my coworker ordered 2 and there were only 6 tacos on the plate. All of our tacos were combined onto the same platter which made it hard for us to remember which we ordered. This problem would be even worse if you came with 3 or 4 people. Bartaco needs to separate orders on different plates.\\n\\nLater when I got the bill it was combined (surprise for me since we specifically said separate), it confirmed that I did not receive my chicken taco. I told the waiter about this and he said that was odd since he specifically added the chicken taco to my order. I find it weird that the kitchen did not explain that they ran out of chicken tacos or me another taco. After asking the waiter to split the bill and noting that I did not receive the chicken taco, I was even more surprised to see that the chicken taco that I never received was still on the bill. \\n\\nIt took 20 minutes for the waiter to mishandle the bills at the end of our meal and for us to pay, which annoyed me further after all the mishaps during our lunch service. \\n\\nOn a side note, my coworker and I shared a guac, which should have been split half and half onto both of our bills.\\n\\nIt is a shame that the wait staff and management are clueless at how to be good at their jobs because the food here is excellent."},{"name":"The Yum Yum Cupcake Truck","address":"","city":"Orlando","stars":"4.5","text":"ok so im only giving this place 4 starts cause i didnt loooove the red velvet cupcake.... it just didnt do it for me \\n\\nhoweverrrr.....

You will circle and circle and circle around this place before you decide to bite the bullet and pay for parking.  This is more of a City problem I know, but if you're going to Gus' for chicken then it counts.\\n\\nI thought the fried chicken was AMAZING.  Here's how good it is: When I read the menu I saw that everything is fried in peanut oil, and I am allergic to peanuts.  Now I've had food done in peanut oil (Five Guys) and I can eat it, but it usually isn't enjoyable bc my throad and mouth will itch and I have to drink gallons of water to wash it out.  That being said I could not stop eating this chicken!  It's THAT good.\\n\\nComing in a close second is the mac & cheese.  I get downright depressed when someone makes a bad mac & cheese, or hands me something that tastes just like the Stoffers brand.  Thankfully this does not disappoint, and if you're ordering a side I'd say you can't go wrong with this.\\n\\nThe fries were wildly disappointing.  They were cooked to perfection and of a nice size (I hate shoestring fries with a passion) but they added way too much salt.  And I say this as a self proclaimed salt monster.  I love salt.  I kill for salt.  Dessert for me is a bag of fritos and a glass of ocean water.  And these fries were absolutely LOADED with salt.  Gus must buy salt from one of those tanker trucks that carry gasoline to the gas station...\\n\\nAnd last, we ordered a 2 piece and with 2 sides, but they brought us the 2 piece plate (which comes with slaw and beans) PLUS the 2 medium sides.  This was WAY too much food for 2 people, and obviously not what we wanted.  We wanted just 2 pieces of chicken and the sides, bc my gf and I do not like slaw or baked beans.  We paid it without question, but the server should have asked us to be specific if he was paying attention.

I knew about Pollo Campero from my Salvadorean boyfriend who says its like the KFC of his homeland. With this in mind, we headed inside and ordered some grilled chicken with rice, beans and sweet plantains. The smell inside this place is intoxicating, and there's good reason why: the chicken is cooked with flavorful spices and a hint of lime and it's so juicy, sooooooo juicy. They give you a corn tortilla with your meal and you have the option of choosing from a myriad of little extras at the free salsa bar, which reminded me a little of Moe's (the burrito place), but with a wider selection, including jalapenos, cilantro, chopped onions, different types of salsa, hummus, etc. All very yummy stuff. However, there is a caveat: make sure to take a lot of napkins with you if you're ordering it to go because the chicken is quite oily, but trust me, you won't mind.

We would have...but hey, different strokes for different folks. This gave us an excuse to try something new. \\n\\nI'd heard of Navarre, but didn't know what to expect. The menu was a little confusing; we didn't know what constituted a \\"small plate\\" vs. a \\"large plate,\\" but our server was very helpful in explaining things. It's a dim sum-style restaurant, only instead of bringing the food to your table, you check off what you'd like to order on a pad of paper. Interesting concept. \\n\\nThe food - all of it - was amazing. I have never experienced such depth of flavors before; each dish sang. The sauteed mushrooms were an earthy delight, perfectly seasoned with salt, pepper, and rosemary. I could have made a meal of these on their own. The crab cakes were moist and luscious, packed with huge chunks of sweet crabmeat and a sweet chile dipping sauce. Probably the best I've ever had. The leg of lamb was sliced thin, cooked medium rare, and accompanied by an olive tapenade that brought out the rich flavor. I wasn't even sure I liked lamb before trying this, but I'm a convert now. A sliced pork dish was similarly bursting with flavor. Even the salad, with a pleasantly salty olive vinaigrette, was firing on all cylinders. \\n\\nMy only complaint is the portion size of the plates. I know, I know - small plates are, of course, going to be small. But when you're a group of four, and they bring a plate of two crab cakes - which taste phenomenal - you're not going to be satisfied. Same goes for the lamb and pork. We all got to try maybe 2 or 3 thin slices apiece. And the potato pancake was basically one potato. Sure, we could have ordered more plates - and we did - but still, there should be some warning about the amount of food you'll be expected to share four (or however many) ways. Large plates worked better: there were plenty of mushrooms to go around, at least. I would stick with large plates next time. \\n\\nUPDATE: There *was* a next time. This time around, we felt like old pros when it came to ordering. In addition to some of the standouts we fell in love with on our first visit and couldn't help but order again (seriously, that leg of lamb and those crab cakes...wow), we added a Spanish/Italian cheese plate that included four varieties. The winner was a taleggio that was perfectly creamy and flavorful. We also ordered rabbit, because I'd never tried it. You know how they say unfamiliar dishes \\"taste like chicken\\"? Well, rabbit really *does* taste like chicken, and it's got the same consistency as white meat. It was very good, too - served in a rich broth of bacon cubes and mushroom. We tried dessert this time, too. The devil's food cake was sublime. Once again, Navarre was firing on all cylinders. I would boost the rating to 5 stars, but it's a very compact and crowded space, and the wooden bar stools were uncomfortable. The chairs aren't much better. Tight quarters and a lack of comfort keeping this place from earning a perfect rating...but only barely."},{"name":"El Chilito","address":"2225 Manor Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"3.5","text":"I visit El Chilito because I can walk there from my apartment.

Seated for 20 min, no service. Our table wasn't far from the hostess podium, and was directly adjacent to the bar. Saw lots of servers, none came forward to our table. I got up and pointed out the obvious to the hostess. Of course, she was trying to change out her shift, but flagged a waitress down and pointed us out. Another 5 minutes pass and our \\"volun-told\\" waitress gets around to us after checking in on her other tables. \\n\\nIn short, my friends asked questions regarding the menu that never got answered - our waitress forgot to ask in-between the 15 or so minutes it took to fulfill our drink orders (waters, tea, and a soft drink). Service for drinks - slow. Service for meals - slow. Service for check and receipt - slow. The place was not slammed, in case you were wondering. Lots of open tables, and waiters visibly clustered at the bar area. The split check we requested (only 2 ways) was incorrect and needed revising. We were there for 2 hours for only 4 shared plates of basic menu items - the excitement to try out Gordough's menu greatly depreciated after that first half hour; I think we were all trying to minimize our orders to speed up the process. One of my friend's kid actually fell asleep at the table...I envied that kid. \\n\\nWe all agreed in the parking lot, we should have left within the first 20 minutes instead of being treated like an afterthought. It kinda kills the dining out vibe when you have to remind the staff of your existence as a customer. \\n\\nSo, if one star is equal to the restaurant's very existence (as zero stars aren't possible), then the second star I must qualify.

Too high a spiciness level tends to destroy the ability to really taste food. \\n\\nSweet potato fritters: Piping hot and delicious. Like sweet potato french fries in knish form, but way better.\\n\\nTamarind glazed cod: Delicate, but not flimsy. The cod was excellent and the salad below really made it pop.\\n\\nAsian-braised soft tacos: Messy and scrumptious.

Slightly burned around the edges, nice and crispy, the way it should be. Seated at the long bar chomping away is what East Boston is all about. The star of the night though was the mixed grill: peppers, sausage, and lamb and steak tips on one place with homemade bread, cooked fresh on the grill. All of which were tender, cooked to perfection, and downright flavorful, studded with spices and seasonings, you could tell these weren't bought in sausages either. They were homemade.

I got the 2 piece plenty plate with collard greens and Okra. \\n\\nThe chicken (one thigh one drum) was a bit dry especially for dark meat, with the breading not having that signature crunch. I was hoping for a bit more seasoning in the breading as well. I'm comparing to my southern travels to Memphis, Atlanta, Greenville, etc. A bit disappointing. \\n\\nI opted for the collard greens as I've had it many times at 4 Rivers. Tasted a bit different, much more sweet then I'm accustomed too, which isn't a bad thing, just not my favorite. The okra was solid. Crunchy on the outside, slimy on the inside. \\n\\nLines are typically long to get the cafeteria style food. My biggest complaint though was the luke-warm food. Everything was served pretty cold and I have no clue why; the line was out the door so I know food was being replenished very quickly. \\n\\nTo end on a high note; sweet tea was incredible.

Granted it was highly due to the horrible beginning of our experience there.  We tried to call ahead to find out what the wait was, but kept being redirected to a voicemail service for the pr firm.  When we arrived we were told it would be a 20-25 minute wait for a party of three. The young hostesses were rude and definitely thought they were above everyone else.  Needless to say, their behavior far from improved when after 50 minutes, I inquired about our table.  I was told it would be a few more minutes, then watched parties seated that arrived after us.  So our 20-25 minutes was one hour and 15 minutes.  If it's going to be a long wait, that's fine.  Just please let me know.  Underestimating by that extent and exhibiting such unprofessional and offputting behavior should call for the termination of these girls. I'm sure there are much better hostesses out there who would be happy to take their position and behave properly. \\n\\nOn another note, our waiter was fantastic. The food was ok, but none of us were wowed by the experience. I felt like my burger was going to fall off the bun the whole time bc it kept sliding around.  Then the sweet potato tater tots were rather mushy.  The onion rings and fries were fine, but not memorable. They were out of Krispy Kreme donuts, so we didn't get to try that shake, but the nutella one was rather fabulous. \\n\\nBetween the bad service at the onset and the lack of the wow factor that I was expecting, my friends and I won't make the effort to come back anytime in the near future."},{"name":"Medina Cafe","address":"780 Richards Street","city":"Vancouver","stars":"4","text":"tricky to review this one.

We'd been wanting to go here for a while since we'd heard good things.  We tried one Saturday night but the wait was appalling (and it took a good ten minutes for the \\"host\\" to even acknowledge us).  Then we ended up going last Saturday before a play, showing up at 5:30 when it opens.  By the time it opened there were enough people in line to fill the restaurant.  Even before they opened the bartender was giving us the evil eye through the window.  As we entered she continued to give us dirty looks, presumably because the arrival of guests meant she was going to be completely overwhelmed by cocktail orders, and the restaurant hadn't seen fit to employ two bartenders (yet they had two do-nothing \\"hosts\\").  \\n\\nWe were seated and ordered cocktails.  During the 35+ minutes we waited for our cocktails, we enjoyed a constant arctic gush of air from the air conditioning vents (this is in January).  About 1/3 of the restaurant had their winter coats on, including me (plus hat and gloves).  We requested an adjustment in the heat but the useless \\"host\\" and \\"hostess\\", who stood in the warm corner of the restaurant doing nothing, actually said, \\"well, it's not cold over here\\".  Eventually our cocktails came, much much later, and they were good.  We had the datiles (date-almond-bacon wraps) which were amazing (hence the 2 stars) and a mediocre, hard-fried, tiny plate of calamari.  Our waitress was friendly, although we had to beg her for a glass of wine once our cocktails ran out.  \\n\\nFor an entree I got adobe-spiced churrasco (beef), which would have been delicious if it hadn't arrived lukewarm.  Within a few bites, thanks to the frigid air (did I mention the frigid air that was jetting at us the whole time?), the meat was cold.  Not just room-temperature, but like refrigerator cold.  Finally, towards the end of the meal (1.5 hours later) they finally turned the heat on (after 4 complaints from our table and many more from other tables) and we were treated to hot gusts of air for the last few minutes of our meal, allowing us to take our coats off.\\n\\nI'm not usually a complainer - I almost always have a great time at restaurants.  This seems to be the case of a popular restaurant where they just figure, hey, the restaurant's full and we're raking in money, so why bother making it pleasant for people?

They changed the menu and now the food seems to be lower quality, the prices too high, and there are basically no decent vegetarian options whatsoever.\\n\\nFull Review:\\n\\nI live only a few blocks from Rafiki and have been going there on and off for about a year. They had an amazing menu with tons of unique dishes made from mostly local food. The menu was recently changed and so my girlfriend and I decided to give the new menu a try. We figured they did such a good job before that despite the fact that some of our favorite menu items were taken away, they probably did a good job this time too. We were wrong.\\n\\nFirst, the service has always been excellent at Rafiki. It can get crowded (i.e. it can take a while to get a seat and it can take a while to get your check), but the staff is genuinely nice and helpful. Our drinks came out quickly, one glass of wine and one cocktail both of which were quite good.\\n\\nOur favorite appetizer was an amazing bread and blue cheese plate (the cheese coming from a Vermont farm). This item has disappeared, which was really disappointing. There is a charcuterie & cheese plate on the menu now, but because of the rare meats involved, it's $22 which was frankly absurd for an appetizer. It came with 4 small sample cheeses and more generous portions of 4 meats with mustard, honey, and bread. I am a vegetarian, so my girlfriend ate most of the meat while I had the cheese. The cheeses were good, but according to my girlfriend, the meats just weren't that tasty or interesting -- definitely *not* worth the $22. We were pretty put off by this because it was the only way we could get a cheese plate, which is something we traditionally came to love about Rafiki. Of course, the Vermont blue cheese was no longer part of the dish.\\n\\nThe main course menu used to be pretty varied despite its small size. There were two vegetarian items before, and now there is only one which is very frustrating. As a vegetarian in Cambridge, this was one of my go-to places for a good meal. Now there's barely anything a vegetarian could want for a meal at the prices they charge. The only vegetarian option currently is a \\"gnocchi with goat cheese.\\" \\n\\nAt first this sounded promising, but this dish was terrible. The portion size is extremely small (only about 8 individual gnocchi pieces). The gnocchi itself was not traditional gnocchi at all. Instead it looked more like a limp, fried fortune cookie from a Chinese restaurant. In fact, my girlfriend and I both felt they tasted more like microwave wantons than gnocchi. I thoroughly suggest you avoid them, and so if you're a vegetarian that means unfortunately nothing on the menu for you. \\n\\nHow can a hip, local place with sharp decor and ingredients from local farms manage to alienate vegetarians this badly? They had such a great menu, but now it seems pretty much ruined. If they change the menu soon, there is hope; and maybe they'll change it for the spring and summer. But steer clear if the menu stays as it is right now (Dec. 2011)."},{"name":"Blue Star Donuts","address":"1155 SW Morrison St, Ste 102","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"I get it...

Granted it was late (90 minutes to close) and the place was neatly empty on a Friday night but better to offer a reduced menu or close early than serve cold food that had been sitting out too long.   \\n\\nWe had the Mezza Sampler plate combining hummus, baba ghanouj, dolma, tabbouleh and tzatziki.  The Tabbouleh amounted to a tablespoon size portion.  The dolma were very small.  The tzatziki had a great flavor but overwhelmed the plate.  The tzatziki was more of a sour cream base than yogurt and featured a sour flavor profile.  This was not bad it was unexpected.   The pita bread was cold and had clearly been sitting out for a while and was not fresh.  \\n\\nWe were going to order the Shawarma Plate but the waiter warned us that the Shawarma was not very good and that diners had not enjoyed it.  My wife and I are both of the opinion that the cooks did not want to turn on the grill but the waiter could have found a more graceful way to say that.  Now, Shawarma is a Middle Eastern staple and it's hard to image a Mediterranean restaurant that can't turn out a decent Shawarma.   The bowl was Aloo Chana was hot, flavorful and everything the menu said it would be (minus pita bread or rice).  \\n\\nOur Hot Moroccan Mint Tea was barely lukewarm.  Flavor was good but it's hard to enjoy a tea that is supposed to be served hot.  The same could be said for the Baklava cold and dried out and without much honey.  \\n\\nAdmittedly we own part of our restaurant experience by the not speaking up about the pita bread, tea, & Baklava and lack of Tabbouleh it also seemed clear from the comments about the Shawarma Plate that fresh hot food was not priority and that the kitchen wanted to shut down for the night."},{"name":"Blue Star Donuts","address":"1155 SW Morrison St, Ste 102","city":"Portland","stars":"4","text":"So clean!

Not bad by any means but not amazing. Not served with any mayo or other dips but they have an aioli that you can ask for. \\n\\nDuck confit. Good presentation with a healthy serving of a tasty salad. The crisp was nice and the duck was perfectly prepared and tender inside. Highly recommend trying this dish  \\n\\nBouillabaise had a really nice tomato saffron broth that had a nice seafood flavour.

I loved how tender and fall-of-the-bone the ribs were and the peppercorn caramelized tops added an extra kick.  The mussels were equally good and cooked in such a savory and fresh tasting broth with the flavors of lemongrass, cilantro and fish sauce--my sister and I couldn't get enough of the broth and actually used the empty mussel shells to slurp it up.  \\n\\nNow onto the bad...the spicy coal black wings were appropriately named as the chicken wings actually tasted and looked like lumps of coal.  They were burnt to the point of maximum dryness and the sauce didn't really help as it was too tangy and spicy.  If it had some honey to sweeten it up, I think it would have tasted much better.  The nirvana chicken congee was bland except for the toasted garlic chips on top and as such, our group didn't finish this after the top flavorful layer was scooped away.  The warm romaine salad was a small bowl of wilted, greasy lettuce with an occasional bleu cheese or pork fat crumble..and somehow I don't think its $6 price tag is justified.  But the most disappointing of all were the stuffed baos.  Instead of being soft and tender, the bun was cold and tough.  The components in the bao also just tasted a bit off.  The braised pork belly was salty and tough; paired with the sour pickled daikon and the sriracha mayo, it just clashed.  I just wished there was some more savoriness or sweetness akin to David Chang's pork buns with the addition of hoisin.\\n\\nI'm not sure if it was just a one-off or perhaps dinner here is much better, but for now I think I'll just stick to Joanne's baked goods at Flour."},{"name":"Pho Van","address":"8557 Research Blvd","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Just had lunch here ..

Not the case with Champions. Yes, the TVs are amazing, and the projector is great too, but the quality of food and service has declined tremendously since they moved from the cozy confines that once existed downstairs.\\n\\nWe went into Champions on a Sunday night planning to meet Jeff and Kelley to watch the San Diego/NY Giants game (Kelley pretends to root for SD, since she grew up there, but was really rooting for NY so that her beloved Broncos could keep their spot in the standings). We wanted a place that wouldn't be insanely crowded but would have the game on, and we figured Champions was the place (we'd been to the old one). When approaching the \\"Entrance,\\" we waited for a few minutes before a standoffish waiter approached and told us, \\"You can kinda just sit anywhere,\\" so we sat down at a table that had a great view of the plethora of TVs and the projection screen. We were promptly greeted by our waitress, Patty, who asked if we wanted menus and got our first round of Diet Cokes to us quite quickly. Patty actually had waited on us during our last visit as well, which we thought was cool.\\n\\nWalking in, we enjoyed the LCD backsplash and walls of TVs, but were not happy with the open-ness of the restaurant, and the fact that it was FREEZING \\"inside.\\" The floorplan was open enough, but it seemed as if the waitstaff was spread thin and had tables all over.  Granted this is a restaurant inside of a hotel, but before at least you didn't feel as though you were a guest of the Copley Marriott.  You even had to go outside of the restaurant to use the bathroom located next to the gift shop.\\n\\nJeff and Kelley arrived a few minutes after, and this is where things started to head downhill. Patty brought over some menus for us.  Now these weren't your typical menus.  They opened funny with some the writing on the back being horizontal and the writing inside was vertical.  It was a hassle just to figure out what was on the menu, and we can only imagine what that would be like a few drinks in.\\n\\nPatty quickly got our companions their first drinks, a tall Mayflower draft beer and a margarita, and also took our order for nachos. The nachos came out and were subpar at best (not bad, just okay, absolutely not worth the $10 we paid). The nachos came out cool to the touch, with a mound of caked on cheese and a pile of olives with a few jalepenos sprinkled in. The salsa was simply food processed tomatoes with a sprinkle of onions, and the guacamole was a bland puree of avocado.\\n\\nNow's where things really take a turn for the worst, Patty grabbed a couple more rounds of drinks, each time paying less and less attention to our table. By the time the SD/NY game was ending (7:15ish?) we hadn't seen Patty for about an hour, nor had ANY of our glasses been cleared from the table.\\n\\nIt wasn't until Kelley began making towers of glasses that anyone bothered to come over to the table, and the gentleman that did come over simply said, \\"Wow.\\" Placed his tray on the table, and cleared the glasses. Patty observed all of this and smiled from afar, but still neglected to stop by the table to inquire as to how we were doing. It wasn't until about 7:30 that we saw Patty again, and when Jeff asked for the check, she ignored him, smiled and walked away.\\n\\nFifteen minutes later, all of us parched, and with all thoughts of ordering any entrees erased from our minds, Patty was nowhere to be found. We began to scour the establishment to find a manager, but not even a hostess was present, just a whole bunch of waitstaff walking around aimlessly. Kelley finally stood up and got Patty's attention on her way by, explaining that we had been waiting a while for the check, which led Patty to walk off and bring our check back about five minutes later, saying that she thought we \\"were just watching the game.\\" A short while later, she picked up the check and split it quickly, and we left, as fast as possible.\\n\\nIn short: Go to Best Buy and watch the game there."},{"name":"Chipotle Mexican Grill","address":"718 Ponce De Leon Ave NE","city":"Atlanta","stars":"2.5","text":"Chipotle is a great chain and serves awesome food but the location at ponce de Leon in Atlanta is horrible.

We ordered the 8 piece family meal.  Another friend came with their family and ordered the 12 piece meal, but they asked for more for the kids.

She began asking me about what was wrong and after I described what the problem was expected the restaurant normal apology and willingness to correct the order. Instead..... I got a debate where I was told that the sausage they served was not a link sausage but rather a ground sausage. I agreed that I am aware sausage does come in the ground from, but assured the lady the product inside the sub was in my opinion a beef based steak product and besides that on top of that there was cheese that was not advertised and I didn't want and also marinara sauce that was not on the menu she still continued to argue that, the sub is made that way. \\n\\nI explained to her that her menu does not advertise the product to have those items (especially cheese) and that having a chopped up meat should be something that included on the menu as when ordering sausage I expected a sausage link in a casing. At this point had NOT been offered any reprisal to my qualm I requested a refund and that I I would gladly return the sub which I had not eaten to display what I was discussing on the phone. \\n\\n I WAS THEN INFORMED politely THEY COULD DO NOTHING except send me the same product again, I was not allowed a refund at this time, as they said I was given the correct item and that the employee would have to ask the boss.  Cappy's i would like to let you know that this in my opinion is not ethical. The conversation then ended b/c they said they would call me back if they could do anything about the issue to which no phone call was made to fix the issue. Luckily grub hub fixed the issue for me and I got a refund for my order.\\n\\nIn the long run I wasn't expecting much when ordering this sub but I urge any restaurant to please advertise all major components of a menu item. If it has cheese please write so, if there's sauce add it to the description. Keeping your customers informed on what to expect would solve this issue.\\n\\n** Note I am one person writing this review sharing my opinions about this restaurant, from my one experience ordering from them.

I'm not sure what happened for the other yelp reviewers who didn't have such a great time here but I would have to speak for my friends and I that we had an awesome time here and we ALWAYS do. The servers are very friendly and ask you how your day was and allow you as much time as you need to look at the menu. And I also actually went to go check out the bathroom because of what another yelp reviewer wrote and I would say that it was very clean. Nothing on the floor and there was even an automatic scent spray thing that made the bathroom smell very nice and flowery. But aside from that because the main point of this place is not its restrooms but its food..I would recommend the seafood sizzling hot pot. Its just the right amount of sweetness and spiciness to really get your senses tingly. there's also the bulgogi or vegetable hotpot but I just love seafood so I usually get the seafood one. But anyone can get what they want because it'll probably be really good. On days that I want meat I get the bulgogi which I belive is marinated very well and it comes out SIZZLING AND HOT. Also some other things I recommend to seafood lovers is the seafood pancake the large version because it comes out in another hot plate and comes out super crunchy and HOT and DELICIOUS. Another thing to check out is their seafood soondubu! Because this place is skd TOFU and bbq..and yeah check out their bbq too! I just come here so much and am left delicious each time so I dont understand the other yelpers that didn't but a restaurant has its good and not so good days and I always manage to have the best time.

I have also tried the \\"Teriyaki Bowl\\" which comes with a variety of vegetables, jasmine rice, and a special sauce (similar to the white sauce at a habachi restaurant). The prices are extremely reasonable and inexpensive if you are looking for a quick yet tasty meal. As an appetizer, get the fire roasted avocado..truuust me.\\n\\nA plus side is that you get to enjoy the fact that there are no waiters or waitresses. I personally enjoy the quick casual restaurants set up vs restaurants with a full wait staff. You order at the counter and take a number similar to Tijuana Flats --Jimmy Hulas has food runners or helpers who bring out your food, refill your drinks, and take your order at the register.

Everyone in the group had a great meal from the fish to an entree salad, which I happened to sample and wish I could sneak in the kitchen to see how they made the dressing.\\nAfter our meal we decided to go with an espresso and some dessert.  The Rasberry Nectarine Cobbler Crisp was excellent, and (I dont say this too often) something I have never had before.  The flavors blended so well and was topped with some yummy ice cream.  Our bread pudding was also good, but couldnt hold a candle to the cobbler, which I quickly moved to my side of the talbe and protected with my spare fork.  The only downside was unfortunatly the espresso, now you know I am a coffe snob and this was over extracted and bitter, but hey its a restaurant and is hard to get a good espresso when the machines makes it without a barista.

She said that she could put it in one of those cheapy plastic containers but she would have to charge me for it. I was really turned off after paying $3.95 for a non-gluten free cupcake, that I would have to pay an additional .75 for a plastic container that would immediately go into the recycle bin. But I did.

I ordered the 2 piece white meat (1 breast, 1 wing) and a side of macaroni and cheese. The chicken was amazing. The skin is perfectly crispy and there's a layer of hot sauce between the breading and the chicken. The seasoning was just the right amount of spice for someone who can't handle spicy but still enjoys a bit of a kick. The meal came with beans, white bread, and coleslaw. The beans were a wee bit too sweet but worked well with the plain bread. Coleslaw was the average cabbage coleslaw. The Mac and cheese was very cheesy with some paprika and cayenne pepper. The cheesiness was great but there could have been more seasoning. Service was fast without making me feel rushed about freeing up a table.

I really love you, so it pains me to assign so little stars. Let me preface this review by saying the food is always, consistently delicious. From my personal favorite the Dirty South (chicken fried steak atop a garlic donut / potato latke, drenched in creamy white gravy and topped with a habanero-cranberry jelly... it's fantastic) to the fried brussels sprouts, I have always left full and happy. \\n\\nHowever, your service sucks. And it's consistently bad. I wish I could say bad service has been a one-off experience, but it's not. I've had terrible service repeatedly, yet I still keep crawling back. Starting to think it's time to end this relationship. :( Please see my most recent visit as an example:\\n\\nThis past Sunday, I wanted to introduce two friends to Gourdough's. Despite all the delicious places that serve brunch in Austin, I championed Gourdough's and I won this round. At 10:20am, I called to see what the wait looked like for a party of 4. The lady on the other end assured me that there were several large, open tables available, but she couldn't guarantee they'd stay open so her recommendation was to arrive ASAP. We did. \\n\\nWhen we arrived 20 minutes later, the host took my name and told us it was a 30-45 minute wait. I could see from the sheet he was writing on that a party of 2 had walked in at 10:15am and been given a 20 minute wait time, so clearly whoever I spoke to on the phone was wrong. Ok, slightly irritating, but not a huge deal. We can wait.\\n\\nWe found a spot at the bar and decided to have some drinks while we waited. We saw several small tables open up behind us right as we were ordering our drinks, so we confirmed with the bartender that it wasn't open seating, and she said we would need to be seated by the host to sit there. Those tables stayed open for almost the entire time we were at the bar, meanwhile dozens of customers waited on the side patio to be seated.\\n\\nAfter 30 minutes, I went to check in with the host to see how much longer the wait was for our party, and I told him we were having drinks at the bar but were closing out there and did want to be seated for food. I pointed to exactly where he could find us sitting when they were ready for us. \\n\\nTables continued to open up around us but not be filled. After another 20 minutes, my friend asked the bartender what was going on. The bartender was super lovely and helpful, and offered to go find out for us. When she came back, she said they were ready to seat us. The host showed us to our table and muttered some lame excuse about how he had been \\"looking for us in the wrong places\\". That is a straight up lie. Gourdough's interior isn't huge, and we had a direct line of sight to him from our position at the bar. \\n\\nAfter we were seated, nobody took our drink or food orders for about 10 minutes (we were all ready to order at this point; we'd been reviewing the menu at the bar for almost an hour). We had to grab a waitresses' attention as she was walking by. Once that happened, the food was a little slow coming out but things went fine.\\n\\nOverall, I'm embarrassed by the service we received since I made the recommendation to eat there. I'm also super frustrated by the way the host treated us, and what's up with making dozens of people wait to be seated when there are so many open tables??\\n\\nGourdough's: I love you. Please get your sh*t together."},{"name":"The COOP: A Southern Affair","address":"610 W Morse Blvd","city":"Winter Park","stars":"3.5","text":"So good.

The relevance of Michelin stars depreciates every year, and these guys stay the same.\\n\\nAll of their ingredients are properly sourced (their fridge is amazing). Their herbs are plucked carefully with pairing knives (so as not to bruise the stems). Their recipes, when not directly from David Thomson's (if you don't know who that is, get on Google now or you don't deserve to have an opinion on Thai food above the level of \\"foodie\\" (which should really be called \\"Amateur Food Photographer\\")) notebooks, are dreamed up by Angus and his back-end All-Stars. Their proteins are seasonal when possible. And, hey - you never know who's just hanging out back there in the kitchen - while I was a \\"Stage\\", I met Chef David Gunawan (who was just there as a small favour. cooking on their wok). I tried their whole menu, and it turned my idea of Thai food at that time, on its head.\\n\\nAlso - the prices are amazing considering what the product is. The wine list too, is top notch.

With those two statements out of the way I can proceed on with my review. \\n\\nOn Tuesday, January 19, 2016 i unassumingly took a train to Back Bay in efforts to meet my friend for dinner. My phone died as soon as I sat down on the train and then my adventure began.  I arrived at back bay and left the station in efforts to find Barcelona where my friend would be waiting. I encountered a CVS where I was sold the wrong cord for my phone, my fault I should have paid more attention. I then asked for directions to Barcelona. You're really close they said, just two lefts and keep looking they said. They were wrong. Phone less and lost I hailed a cab and directed him to Barcelona. I'm not sure of the address I said because my phone is dead please look it up we shouldn't be too far. Awesome. The cab driver took me to the Brookline location instead of the South End location. I had the kind kind manager call the South End location to alert them that I was on my way but also without a phone so, please let my friend know. A walk, a train, a walk, a cab and another walk later I walked into Barcelona.\\n\\nGreeted by the sweetest and kindest (who I wrongly thought was the host) Dre, and directed to my friend. I was almost/basically was in tears after a two hour excursion to get there. I joked about needing all of the alcohol to repair my pride and soul after all of the cold and misery of being trekked all over Boston and back. Dre brought my friend and I to our table and I met Ryan, another curtious, informative and likable server, he just was saying hi and that he was going to be hanging out near our table since it was so warm and was near all of the bread. He was adorable and kind, my friend came over from the bar and we got settled in. The district manager John stopped by and joked asking if we had ever visited their location in Brookline and offered to buy me a beverage after my travels and shenanigans, before I could order a pitcher of red sangria was delivered to our table from Dre (the manager not host-- I'm dumb she's brilliant and amazing) and we were off to peruse the menu. \\n\\nMark and Sarah took care of us this evening. They were funny, kind, informative and people I would honestly enjoy the company of. They made amazing suggestions, from the croquettes and potata bravas to the mushrooms in sherry and the chorizo with sweet sour figs. All incredible and delicious. Ryan our friend who just popped by here and there suggested the albondigas that were great and some delicious dessert descriptions.\\n\\nWe even encountered a bald-headed friend who uninvitedly (word?) joined us and began his efforts to hit on us and join us for our meal, thankfully our friends Ryan and Mark helped us gently remove this crazy from our table so we could laugh, recuperate and enjoy our snacks and sangria. \\n\\nWe also ordered the crepes for dessert and they were also delicious. \\n\\nThe real reason I am writing this review is because I work in this industry myself and I have NEVER (including my own serving skills and knowledge) encountered such warmth, kindness, hospitable, sincere service in my life. And I do this for a living. Dre, John, Mark, Sarah and Ryan transformed a night that I was sure had already been ruined into a truly amazing experience. I would even like to work here myself just based on how my evening went while I was in their care. Truly amazing; I felt so well taken care of that I honestly forgot how truly terrible the jaunt to get there was. Not only will I go back but I will continue to be a loyal customer of Barcelona (South End) exclusively just because of tonight. \\n\\nThank you again so much for helping turn a truly trying evening into one I enjoyed, laughed and loved so much.  \\n\\nGo to this Barcelona, I have never been so well taken care of, ever.

She had picked out the restaurant for her birthday dinner before we found out about the Groupon deal, which we eventually snagged before going.\\n\\nWe were seated right away, which is a plus. A few servers came by at various times to bring bread and some of the items we ordered, but our main server was Ainsley. Ainsley was very friendly and checked on our table multiple times. She gets two thumbs up from me! All of the waitstaff who serviced our table were very friendly, too.\\n\\nThe atmosphere was warm and cozy. There weren't a lot a people at first, but the tables started filling up within an hour of our arrival. Still, the noise level was a bit much when we first arrived. I could barely hear my sister's friend at normal speaking voice, and he was sitting right next to me. \\n\\nWe had ordered buffalo tenders as an appetizer for the table; my sister got the steak tips; her friend got the sirloin; and I got the Yankee pot roast. The buffalo tenders were good. They were nicely sauced and were pretty juicy. However, I wasn't very impressed with my dish. It was a little too salty and in general, there was nothing special about it. Half way through, it became a chore to finish because there was so much of it. This was a bit of a let down because I was really hungry and this didn't quite hit the spot.\\n\\nIn addition to our food, we also ordered a pitcher of Red Sangria. Sadly, the sangria was very disappointing. I understand that sangria normally doesn't have a very high alcohol content, but it really tasted like we were drinking fruit punch. Normally, this would irk me only a little bit, but the pitcher was $35. The pitcher was also quite small for that price point. \\n\\nOverall, my experience was kind of mediocre.

I know pork belly is supposed to be fatty, but I don't think it's supposed to be straight up pork fat! When I bit into the sandwich, I was overwhelmed by the taste of greasy, overly salted, semi-cold, mushy fat, and I had to spit it out. The sides weren't much better; both the coleslaw and the salad were more or less tasteless.

But trust me, you will be quickly drawn to the rainbow of macarons that steal the pastries limelight.  Purple, green, yellow, red...you name the color they have it! The macarons, perfectly domed, perfectly smooth, with it's perfect feet around the middle will fill you with a warm, fuzzy happiness after biting into the perfectly moist meringue and perfect buttercream.  Did I mention perfect? The save the best for last feeling? A whole fruit in the middle for the fruit macarons!! Blackberry's my favorite! The multi-pastel palette packaging is super adorable too and makes such a classy gift! \\nSipping an Americano, black with no sugar and enjoying my macarons on Thierry's patio would have made Rick Steve recommend this cafe in his European guides!\\n\\nRather than flying 8 hours to Paris to have a Hermes or La Duree macaron, I think I might have found the equivalent, if not better just down the street."},{"name":"Veracruz All Natural","address":"2505 Webberville Rd","city":"Austin","stars":"4.5","text":"Absolutely THE best migas breakfast taco EVER.

The smell of lavender was definitely there, but the taste of lavender and caffeine was a bit weird for me. My gf's mom ordered a rosewater mocha, and she loved it. \\n\\nBy the time we got seated the brunch menu was over and it was the lunch menu. MY gf's mom ordered the Fricasse ($16) which has 2 fried eggs, braised short ribs, roasted potatoes, caramelized onions, watercress, applewood cheddar with grilled focaccia.  This is a breakfast item that is served all day.  My gf had the L'ardennais ($19) which is AAA flatiron beef, 1 fried egg, forest mushroom bruschetta, smoked tomato b√©arnaise, ciabatta with watercress salad.  I decided to get the Truite Saissoniere ($16), pan seared steelhead, quinoa and butternut squash salad, espelette caper butter, sunflower seeds and fresh picked herbs, pita chips.\\n\\nThe Fricasse was the best of the three, and I highly recommend it!  The braised short ribs were super tender and the sweetness of the caramelized onions really popped.  It is great that a grilled focaccia was serve as it can be used to mop up all the sauce in this dish.  The focaccia alone was pretty darn tasty with the buttery herbs slathered all over it.\\n\\nWe also had a waffle, which was light and fluffy and delicious to eat on its own.

I went there for lunch today, and ordered the steak tacos for $16 (ridiculous, doesn't even come with anything!). Sounded good on the menu, however, when they came out, I knew they would be bad. First off, the meals came out in 5 minutes...they didn't even ask how I wanted the steak cooked so I assumed it would be at least medium well just in case, and steak cannot physically cook that temperature that quickly with all the other food being prepared (I cook steak all the time and like it medium rare ). The steak was gray, GRAY, and only came with cilantro and onions. No salsa, nothing at all. The gray steak was dry, and the taco shells (came with 2 each) were both broken and everything fell out. It was so disgusting that I had to send it back and did not want to order anything else from the menu. I've felt sick all afternoon which makes me think the steak was leftover and not fresh (especially because it was gray and overly dry). I was embarrassed for the cook to even send those out. Literally the worst meal I've ever had, I've never sent a meal back. \\n\\nAs for the drinks, they were delicious. Poseidon's punch and cranberry bog Rita, also some craft beer.

I am a lover of burgers, whether made fast and furious or carefully and of the finest pedigree and skill.  Unfortunately, i can't scream with glee.  I'd say A-Ok.\\n\\nWe went to FLIP before seeing Kooza and clearly got there just in time.  We were seated promptly at a 4 person table in a space that frankly is pretty damn cool.  A line started forming at the door within 5 minutes of sitting.  This was around 6:15 on a Wednesday.\\n\\nThere's a lot going on in here and every ounce of space is used for seating, to such a degree that tables nearly touch rendering it impossible to sit at all sides of the table.  In my opinion this causes two problems that actually compound on each other.  Because so many people are seated in this relatively small space the restaurant is consequently loud.  And because it's loud it's hard to sit next to someone without hearing their conversation.  And gripes.  And seeing their disappointed faces when 2 rounds of burgers come out that are \\"not acceptable\\".  In all fairness, i'm pretty sure those dudes suck at life so maybe i'm being harsh.  But you know how it is when you're in a loud restaurant.  You yell to be heard and the level goes up again.\\n\\nAnyway, the burgers were all super tasty.  I ordered the turkey burger and it was both scrumptious and healthy (i think).  I ruined my order with the sweet potato tots but was pretty disappointed.  Maybe i caught an off night but the tots were hardly sweet and were very very greasy and salty.  My bro had the Poboyger and scarfed it.  The girls had Flip burgers and i'm surprised they didn't eat their hands on accident.  Those burgers were solid, no doubt, and I'm glad i had a nibble of my fiance's perfectly grilled medium burger.  We also had a side of shrooms (completely amazing) and fries (tasted like fries, yay!).\\n\\nI was satisfied with our service but honestly pretty let down with presentation.  I'm not big on the Blaise fanfare as celebrity-style chefs go but i did really love Element and what he does as a chef.  I guess I expected to see some strange burger stylings and for the most part they came out looking like regular burgers that cost more than 5 guys but have about the same taste.  I hope that doesn't cut deep, Chef.  5 Guys is the bomb but rest assured they don't have your great beer selection!\\n\\nWith all this being said, I'll definintely be back.  I know a place like this will sort itself out.  And i've mentioned in previous reviews (you read them all, right!?) but i'm harder on restaurants that come with higher expectations.  FLIP is great food.  I'm just leaving myself some room for next time.

First off let me say that you can get a serving of 4 baked mussels at all sushi restaurants for about $6, here you get 5 pieces for 8. The mussels weren't very good, and the mayo was only look-warm and barely baked. Having waited 20 minutes for the appetizer (mind you I was the only customer) I decided to just eat them.

Andiamo sits in a strip mall that has an odd mix of businesses.  Once inside and definitely after your first bite you forget that completely.  Despite the open feeling, the live music gives a sense of privacy too.\\n\\nWe've been there several times and the food is always outstanding.  I recommend asking your waiter for a half course of the pasta to make sure you have room for an entree so you can experience both courses.  Most recently I had the mushroom ravioli and chicken in a rosemary shallot sauce.  Both dishes became my new favorites there.  The ravioli is cooked perfectly to al dente and has a wonderful blend of hearty and sweet.  The chicken was amazingly tender (could cut it with my fork) and the rosemary shallot sauce was so delectable I sopped up some of the extra with bread.\\n\\nSome people have noted that Andiamo is a little pricey and I have to disagree.  In terms of what you get, the quantity and the quality, I think it's fairly priced.  You can get an entree or pasta course in the $15 -$20 range; however it's a full meal and you won't go away hungry unlike other restaurants in this price range.  I also think Austin has few Italian restaurants in this price range (and definitely this caliber)  in so many people's expectation is unjustly set.\\n\\nBottom line ... for an awesome Italian meal, go to Andiamo."},{"name":"Ikenohana","address":"14308 SW Allen Blvd","city":"Beaverton","stars":"4","text":"On a Wednesday night - 45 minutes for 6 orders of sushi, 30 minutes for an appetizer.

I realized it was easier if I just stabbed it into the side of the donut. The texture of the dough had a good balance of fluffy wines. The vanilla pudding inside was delightfully rich but not too sweet. The Cointreau added just a bit of bright, citrus flavor without being overpowering. My only complaint is that they seem to sell out a lot or bake things at different times, so it took a few tries to get my creme br√ªl√©e donut. I don't mind as much since that just means they're fresher when you get them, but it does sometimes put a damper on things when you're on the hunt for a specific flavor.

The menu was very simple and the prices were great. As my boyfriend and I were famished, we went for an assortment of appetizers to share. It turned out they were all deep fried and that wasn't planned nor was that a good idea for the waistline but today of all days, I didn't care. \\n\\nThe first to arrive was our 5 spice duck spring rolls which were decent. The duck definitely had an Asian flavour that I recognized, hence the French/Asian fusion theme of the restaurant hinted at. Next was the deep fried pickles and oh man, these were my favourite of the night. For only $2.50 a plate, it was a steal and I loved the dip that it came with. I could eat 3 plates to myself... But I won't. \\n\\nLastly our chicken wings and Mexican poutine arrived. The chicken wings were a very close second to the pickles. They were breaded perfectly and the flavour tasted just like this fried short rib dish that my dad always made for when I was younger. The garlic pieces that came with the chicken wings were awesome and the overall taste somewhat reminded me of Phnom Penh. The Mexican poutine with chicken was my boyfriends favourite of the night. It was different than your average poutine and the flavours were definitely Mexican and it worked. \\n\\nWe'll definitely be checking back in for their day menu. Our server was also suuuuuper friendly and bubbly and made the whole experience even better."},{"name":"Hopdoddy Burger Bar","address":"1400 S Congress Ave, Ste A190","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"Yup, still the same old blah from these folks.

The Bulgogi Combinations, which come with the tofu soup, is what we always order, because it is what we crave and it is so good we are hesitant to even order anything else. The korean restaurant experience is one of the best, with the little plates of sides to pick at, and just the complexity of everything going on in front of you. My wife and I fell in love with the tofu-Korean restaurant experience back in LA with BCD Tofu House, and we were really hoping that we'd find something similar in Portland. So Kong Dong tastes even better!! Our only complaint was that at BCD they keep refilling your side dishes once they go empty, plus they bring you each a little pan-fried fish and an egg to put inside of your piping-hot tofu soup, all for about the same price as So Kong Dong. But So Kong Dong tastes better!! So even though we are used to getting more for our money back in LA, we get a better taste experience here in Portland. \\n\\nI highly recommend this restaurant. And for anyone looking to try the korean restaurant experience for the first time, this is a perfect place to do it at.

It was 2pm on a Friday, and although the front of the restaurant was packed, they brought us through the restaurant, into some back hallways, past some storage rooms, and voila into another dining room in the back! It was actually one of the dining rooms of Chambar, a Belgian-Moroccan restaurant next door. There was a good view from this room; we could see the stadium and quite a bit of the downtown area. It was about half full, but the rest of the tables filled up pretty quickly after our arrival.\\n\\nService: very prompt and friendly.\\n\\nCost: About $50 total for 1 coffee, two entrees, and two waffles. Great deal!\\n\\n* Lavender Latte ($3.85 8oz, $4.30 12oz, $4.79 16oz) - 4.5 stars\\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/caf%C3%A9-medina-vancouver-2?select=6BWlnQxa6t_O0Hf4taoOPA#O9I8LR8KauSx2it5kDgQgQ\\nDelicious! Love the aromatic and pungent lavender smell, which was more subtle but balanced perfectly with the roasted coffee flavor.\\n\\n* Waffle - 4 stars\\n(selected white chocolate pistachio rosewater and fig orange marmalade toppings. $3.15 each, $1 per topping)\\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/caf%C3%A9-medina-vancouver-2?select=6BWlnQxa6t_O0Hf4taoOPA#jykXp9F1lo9Gdkeooa0lPw\\ncross-section: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/caf%C3%A9-medina-vancouver-2?select=6BWlnQxa6t_O0Hf4taoOPA#arbK9A11ylX8__o2TsIbGQ\\nSoft and fluffy, yet moist. I really liked how chewy it was, but it could have used more of a crisp! That added texture would have been great. The white chocolate topping was great, the rosewater being the most prominent flavor - its texture was less viscous (not as thick as syrup) than I expected but still really dense and sticky. The fig orange was pretty good but very sweet - maybe something tart would have paired better with white chocolate.\\n\\n* Fricasse - 4 stars\\n(2 fried eggs, braised short ribs, roasted potatoes, balsamic onions, watercress, applewood cheddar. Grilled focaccia. $16)\\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/caf%C3%A9-medina-vancouver-2?select=6BWlnQxa6t_O0Hf4taoOPA#lBvw-p5txPfsZvAWJGhBbA\\nfocaccia: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/caf%C3%A9-medina-vancouver-2?select=6BWlnQxa6t_O0Hf4taoOPA#6BWlnQxa6t_O0Hf4taoOPA\\nMeat was really soft and definitely dominated the flavor. This came in a slightly watery soup. Overall a really hearty dish, lots of filling ingredients, and all delicious. The focaccia: moist, toasted perfectly.\\n\\n* Paella - 4.5 stars\\n(1 fried egg, curried orzo, spicy chorizo, zucchini, red pepper, roasted corn, grano padano. Watercress, avocado, tomato salad. $13)\\npic: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/caf%C3%A9-medina-vancouver-2?select=6BWlnQxa6t_O0Hf4taoOPA#V95khapXvjBtjBkeSw5Nig\\nWonderful! I didn't realize this would be an orzo paella and this was the first time I've tried it. They were soft and the corn, more like Mexican corn, blended well since each kernel was about the same size and actually added this really nice grainy texture, making the texture more like brown rice. It wasn't too sweet and that worked to this dish's advantage. While the orzo alone was subtly flavored, there was this thick red sauce that was extremely flavorful & tangy (sun-dried tomato-like) that was neutralized perfectly by the orzo. The veggies were roasted just right, the fresh ingredients a great addition, and the egg (you could get it sunny side up or over easy/medium) wonderful to mix in. \\n\\nMenu 1: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/caf%C3%A9-medina-vancouver-2?select=UcPMXkkfJXAsBpsRhRnSJA#UcPMXkkfJXAsBpsRhRnSJA\\nMenu 2: http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/caf%C3%A9-medina-vancouver-2?select=UcPMXkkfJXAsBpsRhRnSJA#cSv_JJjvMfk9JQgOZB5HHQ"},{"name":"Shake Shack","address":"4400 Ashford Dunwoody Rd, Ste 3025","city":"Dunwoody","stars":"3.5","text":"I saw this on yelp and had to give it a try.

Others at my table raved about the burger, seared in duck fat, and we decided that from now on EVERY dish made should have some kind of duck fat incorporated into it.  My cousin looked like he was trying to make love to his Reuben sandwich and another declared her grilled cheese was one of the best and she was wondering if it was cooked in duck fat as well.  \\n\\nMy only complain was the Cohiba.  Geez, serve two of them in one dish or take it off the menu.  This thing is TINY and 7 bucks only gets you one.  It's duck con fit wrapped in a crepe and greens and the size of a man's thumb.

No mention of it in the Xian noodles. The noodles come out and there's a heaping pile of cilantro on top.

It's a bluish/purple glaze, which tastes exactly like blueberry and basil! More like a hint of basil with blueberrry glaze. Man it was so good. The ratio wasn't too sweet - just perfect. The best grown-up donut I ever had.\\n\\nOther flavors we ordered were the:\\n-Sesame Salted Caramel - good, but very different flavors. You can taste every aspect of this donut separately.\\n-Dulche del luche - kind of sweet. No big deal. \\n-Buttermilk - I think it had raspberry on top. Not sure, but the donut itself was great because it tasted \\"cakey\\" unlike the others! closer to the \\"old fashioned donut\\" variety\\n-Original cinnamon sugar donut - very typical. For those people who aren't into the creative flavors.\\n-Maple Bacon - although kind of strange, it was very unique and flavorful.

Late 70s, early 80s is the vibe I get.  Almost a diner type of feel.  I've read most all of the reviews, and I tend to agree that you get a fair portion for a reasonable price.  However, service may not be so good for you if you are non-white.  When I walked into this establishment during lunch hours, I was never greeted or acknowledged, yet servers continued to walk by me as if I were a ghost.  Sensing racism, but not wanting to feel overly sensitive, I chalked it up and waited for someone to seat me.  When someone did approach me, it was done with such disdain in comparison to the way I noticed other patrons, who were all white, being serviced.  The restaurant was not very busy, nor was it approaching closing time, so I had a hard time understanding why it took literally fifteen minutes for me to be seated and to receive my drink.  When the server took my order, (I ordered the bowl of  chili--which was tasty) the waitress told me specifically, \\"You don't want that bowl of chili, why don't you just get a cup?\\"  For a regular sized bowl of chili, I was certain that her implication was for me not to remain and eat for any extended amount of time.

There was a hair in my friend's soup, a hair in one of our main dishes and the waitress forgot to bring an app and main dish to the table.  We didn't ask for the missing items but when she tried charging us for one of them, we asked to have it taken off the bill at which point she insisted that she brought it to us which took my by surprise.

We all went for a little get together after work, and I was very impressed with the food that was offered up before us.  :)  \\n\\nFirst you should know the location isn't largest out there, but it's not cramped either.  Just be warned that as the night goes on and gets busier the wait for a table could be a little longer.  Especially if you have a pretty decent group there to eat.  We arrived just before the rush and managed to get a seat, but then near the end of our meal felt a bit rushed by the small crowd that was slowly forming at the door.  While no one asked us to leave, we did feel bad continuing our visit for too long.  (At no fault to the Orinoco Restaurant)\\n\\nWe started out with a delicious Areras, the Mecheda one actually.  The shredded beef was almost sweet in taste, but was so very delicious.  And the great corn backed 'pocket' that it was with just made it that much better.  Toning down the sweetness, just barely, and really bring out a lot of flavor.  I honestly could have had several more of these as my meal and been in heaven!\\n\\nMy main course was the Parrilla Caraquena, which is like a variety plate of small meats grilled up and delicious.  Of these were Steak (a smaller like 5oz portion), 1/4 chicken, and some chorizo (Spanish sausage).  Everything was great, but with the only complaint being the steak was just a LITTLE dry.  Not even bad enough to discount points, because everything was seasoned so well and just very tasty overall.  The chicken was very moist and great to eat, and the sausage wasn't quiet as spicy as I normally experience but was still good.\\n\\nI wish I was coming back to the Boston area, or at least up there for a regular visit, because there are a lot of things on the menu that I would like to try and didn't get too.  The menu had a lot of great options, and if what I had was this good, then I know I will be missing out on other treats that I missed out on. \\n\\nService was very good, she was able to explain all the options to us, and even special order some items so we could swap for different sides.  Attentive to check on us, but not in an annoying way, and keep full glasses and no waiting for the check.\\n\\n I definitely recommended it for a night out, and with the atmosphere it would actually make for a pretty good date night!

I had an \\"iceberg disc\\" expecting some sort of deconstructed wedge salad with molecular magic compressing the lettuce into a disc with a bacon foam and blue cheese pellets. We got an iceberg salad. Sigh. It was pretty tasty but not what I hoped for. I got the $21 d'lux burger, an indulgent take on the Rossini burger from Burger Bar (Las Vegas) fame. It consisted of black diamond beef, seared foie gras, wild mushrooms, fried shallots, and truffle aioli. This too was pretty tasty, but not transcendent. It was definitely messy...all manner of juices left an unappetizing puddle. I don't recall any foie gras flavor nor any identifiable wild mushrooms. The truffle essence was entirely too subtle. But I finished every last bit. The fries were wonderfully crunchy and perfectly cooked. My wife's Farmer burger did not taste particularly special...it was a burger.

I liked the environment created by the decor and the space. The polish and the kind of fancy is comparable to Starbucks, but it's obviously home grown. An early thought I had was \\"How are these folks making money?\\" because it seems like an expensive space with not a lot revenue being generated per square foot, based on what's happening at the tables and on offer from the counter. I hope it sticks around. Most of my impressions now are faint, because it's been awhile, I haven't ordered much and I had no thought of reviewing it on either of my two visits. So far I've had the coffee and quiche and a taste of the chocolate peanut butter pie my friend ordered. It's all been good, and I'm kind of a foodie. Food-wise, they only seem to be in the business of resale and curation (correct me please if I'm remembering wrong what I learned when I asked), in that they don't bake their pies or quiches or roast their beans, or prepare much if anything on the spot. The menu was not like a restaurant's. But it was a nice place to take a friend and I enjoyed my interactions with the people at the register both times. There's a degree of woo about the decor and statement of purpose, which (this is just me) might have turned me off if it were just a bit more prominent, but it seems well meaning and not proselytizing.  Multnomah Village doesn't really have another nice cafe per se. Marcos is a restaurant. Starbucks is Starbucks.

We arrived before it started to fill up @ 6 PM.  The indoor bar looked like a cool place to hang.  The dining area seemed to have tables in close proximity to each other.  This could be either good or bad.  Same outdoors, but the breeze was gorgeous and the motif constantly changes with street traffic.  We sampled 5 Tapas and a carafe of the Red Sangria.  The carafe the perfect size for the two of us and the sangria was a nice combination of sweet and tang.  We didn't find the Spicy egg plant caponata spicy, we did find it sweet and delicious.  I liked the Beef Spiced Beef Empanadas but there was only two and I ended up eating most of my wives.  She thought it average and would move on next time. As others mentioned the Hanger Steak is one of the better meat selections - which we got with the grilled asparagus - both very good.  The last tapa was the mushrooms and goat cheese.  I thought this was a gamble but it paid off .... for my wife, not me.  It seemed to have too much of a beefy taste but i did like the goat cheese.  Our server was Brian, although all of them seemed to help each other when needed - so the service was excellent.  I'd definitely return and explore some more of this very cool menu.  I probably wouldn't explore much in the drink menu beyond the Sangria thou.

First, I would like to say how awful the parking situation is. We had to park across the street in the Kroger parking lot because some drivers in the tiny parking lot for the restaurant did not understand proper driving etiquette. Once we finally made it inside, ordering was very difficult because they fired questions at a rate almost too fast for me to comprehend. It was also loud, and they did not speak up loud enough for me to hear whatever they were asking me. The chips, guacamole, and even the salsa are all extra on top of what you choose to order. In my opinion, that makes this place a double dollar sign place instead of a one dollar sign place. Now, for the food part...WOW. This stuff is not to be messed with. It is fantastic! The chicken I had in my burrito bowl was deliciously seasoned, and the guacamole was so fresh. And those chips! I don't know what they put on them, but wow, even those were awesome.

Fresh sheets are written on the chalkboard for all to read. \\n\\nA+ for atmosphere (upscale-casual comfort) and for service. Our servers were extremely mindful, knowledgeable and professional (cute too!). Tonight we shared the 7-course menu for two ($45/per person). Since it was our first time, we wanted to be surprised - let the chefs get creative and have free range to work their magic. We were presented with delish, wholesome and comforting dishes: \\n\\n- Bread basket with grapeseed oil (i think) - very fresh. \\n- Antipasti with artichokes, salami, brioche, prosciutto - Loved it!\\n- Cheese Souffl√© - Creamy, succulent, delicious. \\n- Rabbit gnocchi with Lamb Ragu - My favourite, perfectly crafted. \\n- Sloping Hills Pork Belly Agnolotti\\n- Pork Tenderloin w/ quinoa - Very tender. Wasn't a fan of the quinoa. \\n- Chocolate Linzer Tart with Raspberries - mmmm. \\n- Valle Reale 2009 Montepulciano d'Abruzzo ($40) / Espresso\\n- (See photos.) It's not typically a spot where you see people taking photos, but I did anyway for Yelp-sake :) \\n\\nThe $45 set menu is a really great value comparatively to say the set menu at Chambar or West. I totally recommend it. Overall, the food was satisfying and we had a really great experience. \\n\\nWhat's more: \\n\\n- It's very small and always packed - book ahead! \\n- La Quercia picked up three BIG VanMag Awards this year: 2011 Restaurant of the Year, Best Restaurant for Informal Dining AND Best Casual Italian\\n- Suggestion for La Quercia: Share your story and add bios of your Chefs to the website.

I like to think of myself as almost a falafel connoisseur, trying it nearly everywhere I go. Sometimes because it's what I'm craving, other times because it is the only veg item available.

It must be the perfect combination of crispy outside and a nice toothy, chewy inside. And the sauce makes all the difference. Sometimes I opt for hummus, other times tahini (never tzatziki, though). They put two sauces on their pita, one being a tahini, the other a yoghurt based sauce (which I kindly asked that they leave off). The food did take awhile to prepare, the staff wasn't the friendliest, but that first bite (and every bite thereafter) solidified its five star rating.

Even at 10 pm on a Friday... which is when I went.\\n\\nThe line moved fairly quickly and by the time we ordered and got a table, we waited [maybe] 5-8 minutes before getting our food. It was still hot and delicious too. Was it worth the wait? Sure, but the night I went, it was apparently a short line (we were roughly 12-15 people from the door and the line continues inside). Personally, I wouldn't wait more than 30 minutes because it's still just a burger and there wasn't really any big \\"wow\\" factors for me but I LOVE that the food is gathered locally. \\n\\nI had the Llano Poblano (Angus Beef, Pepper Jack, Roasted Poblano Chiles, Apple-Smoked Bacon, Chipotle Mayo) which was really good! I want to go back and try the Greek (Lamb, Feta Cheese, Arugula, Pickled Red Onions, Tomato, Cucumber, Tzatziki Sauce). It sounds delish! There were a couple other of interesting burger options like chicken and tuna. I must add the the fries were also delicious if you like skin on your fries.\\n\\nA big downfall for me is that it was very noisy, like going to a crowded bar kind of noisy which just isn't my scene.

I don't remember his name, but he's Mexican. Came out one night to personally apologize for mixing up one of our orders. Super nice guy, and the food he puts together is amazing. He said he'd been working there for 12 years or something. Once we found this place, we went back half a dozen times in a few months, always getting a visit from our pal. Then one night we brought some friends from out of town, having told them about this great little restaurant we'd found, and it was like we'd gone to the wrong place. Same menu, but the food was totally different (and not in a good way). We looked in the kitchen, and our pal was nowhere to be seen (all women in the kitchen that night). So I guess he was off that night, traveling, whatever. Point being, when he's there, the food is expensive, but worthwhile. When he's not, the food is expensive and bland, at best. In my opinion, when he can't come to work, they shouldn't even open, as they'll just lose customers who end up feeling, as I do, both ripped off and embarrassed for having brought friends here.

Which is always a tricky thing, but everyone here is so professional it is amazing.  Not only professional, but they all seem to have fun.\\n\\nSo much has already been said about the food, but just outstanding.  All small plates, and they recommend you order 3-4 plates all at once.

We were treated to a sweet-as-pie bartender who was both attentive and efficient. My friend ordered the classic burger with an order of french fries and I ordered the butcher's cut with the beet salad. My friend raved about the classic burger; to her it was juicy, cooked to a perfect medium, perhaps a little greasy, (but that's what makes a hamburger taste good) and she liked that the burger was perhaps smaller in diameter but thicker, locking in the juices. \\n\\nThe french fries were also a treat complete with a smoked tomato mayo and house made ketchup. \\n\\nMy beet salad was delicious, complete with goat cheese, arugula, and trail mix dressed with a citrus vin. And my burger... where to start? The patty was perfect, complete with hangar steak, brisket, and short rib. And the blue cheese and the pickled shallots with red wine jam made this burger something to remember. \\n\\nOn to the milkshake, we shared the Krispy Kreme version.

The plate of poki was overflowing with fresh ahi tuna, slaw and rice. The Loco Moco was smaller, but still plenty of food for its price. The Loco Moco had a perfectly cooked egg on top of deliciously seasoned burger patty. The star of that plate is the brown gravy, which ties everything together and gives you that warm, happy feeling that exemplifies comfort food. The poki was among the best food I've EVER had from a food truck. The fact that it was so clean, fresh, and perfectly prepared is beyond impressive and shows great skill and talent.

I have to admit that as some have stated before me, the service was better than the food. I will say that I did enjoy the Steak and Cheese Egg Rolls. After the appetizer, the food went downhill. My fellow diners received steaks that were cooked to the correct temperature, but wicked over salted. The Truffle Mac and Cheese was also over salted. I asked the server what kind of cheese(s) were used, and I was told Gruyere and Parmesan. Now, having had prior cooking experience, I know that one would have to put a heck of a lot of parm to make the cheese sauce (?) that salty. I was then told by the server that American food tends to be over salted. Wait what? I do not believe that to be true as I used to cook in a restaurant that was classified as American cuisine. At least the server took it off the bill. If you want a drink, go ahead  and have a seat. When it comes to food, I recommend just sticking with the egg rolls. For a nice new restaurant in Newton at the Street at Chestnut Hill, I can say there are better restaurants in the complex that I'd rather go to over this one.

We came on a Monday morning and there was a line out the door by 11:30. On a Monday. So...Anyway, despite all that, the line seemed to move decently quickly, and service here is awesome. I'm from Seattle where servers at a lot of places act like you're doing them a great disservice by showing your face, and I was pleasantly surprised to see that even at a fancy, super popular place like Medina, every member of the staff that we encountered was really, genuinely nice. Man, I miss living in Canada. \\n\\nMy breakfast buddy had the salted caramel latte, which was honestly one of the best caffeinated things I've ever tasted. The caramel was really subtle and it was just really well made. I had the daily special called the \\"Coca\\", which was a fluffy/soft baked flatbread with truffled potato puree, greens, bacon, and tomatoes on--the most exquisite batch of flavors I've had the privilege of eating for breakfast. My partner had the \\"Le Complet\\", complete with amazing lamb steak, some delicious af orange sauce, greens, eggs, and pita.

No sides but I think you can order them as a package deal or individually as well. I expected much higher prices as this place is tucked downtown amid The Four Seasons, Convention Center, and a slew of very pricy places.\\n\\nParking is impossible so I'm not sure I'll be back often as there either is no street parking or you have to pay for a garage.

When we arrived at the buffet of sides to choose from, we noticed the mac n cheese was empty. The staff member quickly brought out what we thought was a fresh tray. Unfortunately, it was not a fresh tray and the mac n cheese was cold. But lets get to the good, or should I say amazing! The brisket was life changing!!! I don't use that term loosely but this brisket was cooked to absolute perfection. Juicy, tender and rubbed with what I could only describe as the perfect blend of spices sent from above. Each bite was better than the previous and I literally did not want it to end. The Cajun rice was hot and tasty. I also chose to get the jalapeno corn bread which was good, not great. I was lucky to try a piece of my friend's pecan pie dessert which was simply excellent. \\n\\nThe food was slightly expensive (about $24 for a pound of brisket and 2 sides) but very very worth it.

The fireball roll also had great flavors. Had some heat as it's name implies. The fireball roll was a few pieces smaller than the tropical. Maybe the menu said approx. how many pieces each roll was, but I don't think it did. Might have ordered a different roll if it meant I got a little more. \\n\\nWe also had the Kentucky Bourbon Barrel Ale they had on tap. SO DELICIOUS.

I want to give them more stars than I have here but at this point I just can't bring myself to do it. From the time you walk in you're surrounded by class but sometimes they fall short of the mark.\\n\\nWe were greeted by the Maitre 'D who offered to check our coats and took us to our table. It was a very nice touch but there was just a little too much talking. I depend on the server to explain the menu and answer any questions I might have. Go away now.\\n\\nService was very good and we never had to wait for anything... water, wine, food. We were seated in the bar area because we told them we were there for both dinner and live music. The only problem I had was that after dinner, the server kept asking, Can I get you something else: wine, etc. It kind of made us feel like we were being sold on something, even though we'd just spent a small fortune on dinner. I understand this but it was just a little too often for my comfort because of saying no every time.\\n\\nI like to enjoy a nice glass of Pinot Gris and Oregon was on the menu. So, I said, I want that. Oh, we're out of that? Really? I settled for the Pinot Noir, which was very good at a reasonable price. It was still disappointing that they didn't' t have my first choice. \\n\\nFood? Well, it was a vegetarian dish served on a bed of potatoes and you know what? It would have been very good if not for one thing. SALT! Why do I experience this problem in almost every restaurant I eat in? Are chefs and cooks taught to use it this way? I don't really think so. Salt is meant to bring out the flavors of certain foods, not overpower them.  When using too much to the point of it's all you can taste, the next day you're wishing you had a diuretic on hand. I forced myself to eat it because it's on rare occasion that I send food back or complain about it. I've eaten at Wilfs on more than one occasion so I don't really have an issue with saying that.\\n\\nOne of the reasons we chose Wilfs was for the live music. I'm not really going to mention the jazz act here except to say this: It was OK but not what I would have gone for. For me, the highlight of this act was the drummer. Todd Strait. This guy was amazing on the drums and I would go back just to see him or find out who he's playing with and go there.\\n\\nWhen I'm experiencing fine dining I kind of like to do it in comfort. This place was freezing. I mentioned it to the server who agreed with me and let me know she would do what she could. I watched her for awhile after that and actually, she did nothing.

Unfortunatley I think that fact says more about the relative sad state of pizza in this metro than it does about any exceptional quality of this establishment. \\n     Its got the look and vibe down right, old school to the core with a grizzled dark barroom atmosphere that wouldn't be out of place in New Haven, deep Brooklyn Staten/Long Island, Trenton NJ or most anywhere else in the fertile crescent of pizza, especially that bad ass and ancient looking oven behind the bar.  The same certainly goes for the awesome exterior with that classic sign and location in a old school Italian turned latin melting pot neighborhood that is East Boston,  sort of Boston's own East Harlem.  \\n      Unfortunately the pizza wouldn't even come close to being deemed at best merely acceptable in any of those other serious pizza towns.  Im not saying its bad but I'm damn sure saying its not great.  The crust is far thicker than either NY or New Haven style and decidedly not the least bit crunchy.  It was in fact nearly pie crust like in consistency and was coated on the bottom with a very generous amount of cornmeal, which didn't help the pie much in my opinion and perhaps maybe hurt it with its cloying and overwhelming taste.  The sauce is on top of the cheese in a matter similar to the \\"tomato pies\\" of Trenton NJ but obviously the results are not the same.  Cheese was unexceptional and sauce a bit cloyingly sweet.  The sausage on one of the pies sampled was of a almost disturbingly grey consistency, pepperoni was awkwardly lost under the cheese and sauce and failed to register much on another pie making it almost impossible to tell if you were having the half topped with it or the plain half.  A special Shrimp Scampi pie was very intense and interesting enough for the first few bites but quickly wore out its welcome, & bear in mind this is coming from a hardcore fan of New Haven Clam Pies so I am more than open to seafood pizza.  Curiously enough another house specialty of the place is \\"BBQ\\" which here means beef or lamb kabobs on skewers.  Not sure where this legacy comes from as I think the place is Italian, and not like a great many other area pizzerias greek but they too proved alright but unexceptional, somewhat a bit too rough and chewy on the occasions I tried them.   \\n     At the end of the day the hype about this place further confirms a truism I learned long ago;  Boston just isn't a legit Pizza town.

That much spice right off the bat could ruin a meal. Next was the duck \\"ham\\". It tasted like a piece of raw duck breast seasoned with salt. Chewy and unpleasant. Finally I had the Tuscan salami. This had great flavor but was too dense. They had to slice it soo thin that you could see right through it. On top of that the pickled beans were too salty and the grilled bread was stale. The food deserves 3.5 stars at most but I am going to go back and try some apps or entrees later.\\n\\nThe reason for the two stars was the way the manager was managing. I first sat down at the bar to watch him and the bartender tasting a few different new cocktails. \\nGood for you. Where is mine.

I really appreciated the options of vegetarian and vegan dishes which are clearly marked on the menu.  Each dish is so unique and ordering the vegetarian share platter is an experience in itself.  \\nThe portion sizes are large and satisfying. They also have an assortment of beers including a gluten-free beer, Corona.\\n\\n The ambiance is great because they have a lot of different sections in the restaurant that provide privacy and even when sitting next to another table,  your conversation isn't easily overheard.  They also have a cosy fireplace and lots of decorations that really provide an authentic feel to the restaurant. \\n\\n Gurkha Himalayan Kitchen was actually one of the first great restaurants I tried in Vancouver and seven years later I am still coming year and will happily recommend it to anyone wanting to dine on Davie.

I don't know what's going on but the last two times I've been, I've left feeling completely unimpressed and wondering if my time and money should have been spent somewhere else. \\n\\nLast weekend we were there with an out of town friend who had a great experience at GPH last time he visited Austin. Since our previous experiences were always spot on, we were on board. The service was already super-slow but then, because our waiter was slammed with a HUGE table of 15, our service took an even worse nose-dive. He knew he was neglecting us and apologized. Fair enough. Unfortunately, the food we ordered wasn't very good either. We shared a burger and a dessert. Both were extremely mediocre. Nutella was super scant on the dessert and the strawberries were underripe. Doughnut was dry.\\n\\nIn spite of last week's experience, last night we took a group of 6 people to enjoy an Austin original - and we left, once again, wishing we had taken them somewhere else. \\n\\nOur service was s-u-p-e-r s-l-o-w at 5:30pm. The fried brussel sprouts were delicious but served to us cooler than room temp. What's up with that?  The doughnut \\"buns\\" on our burgers and sandwiches were dense, greasy, dry and off-tasting. The chicken on the Saussy Cock I ordered was about 30% smaller than the bun leaving me with mouthfuls of the bun. Ended up just eating the small piece of chicken alone since the bun was not good. We each left more than half of our food on the plates. We were served HUGE portions of the chips perhaps to make up for the slow service and old buns?  Wait - there's more! The bacon served on my husband's Three Little Guido's was just a little nubbin of bacon on top of mozzarella that was too rubbery...all on the same dry, dense doughnut-bun. Me: \\"How is yours?\\" Him: \\"I'd rather not say\\"  :(\\n\\nIt took so long to get our food that our original plan to order a couple of dessert doughnuts to share was nixed as soon as we started eating our meal. We just wanted to hurry up, pay our bill and get the heck outta there. \\n\\nTruly saddens me that the quality has gone down. Once, I can understand.

The entrees were good, but I found myself a little disappointed with two of them.  My boyfriend got ravioli, which surprised me, he's usually a little more into the seafood dishes.  But it was plentiful and delicious.  The birthday girl got an alfredo dish with home made pasta. The pasta was good, very egg-y.  She didn't liek it, but I think if you're into home made pasta, you would.  My dish was prepared liek a scampi, though it was not called such.  I felt like it was a bit lighter than I would have preferred.  But the thin pasta complimented the shrimp well.  It was a very attractive presentation, as long as you don't mind eyes and legs on your shrimp. :) Welcome to Italy! Ha!  The other entree ordered was a sweet potato gnocchi in a broccoli rabe, marscapone and garlic sauce with sausage.  I would say I loved this as much as I loved the description.  The gnocchi weren't as sweet-potatoy as I had imagined, and I didn't really know where the marscapone was.

The chips were interesting again not my perfect chip, but fresh and tasty. All in all really good food, fresh and tasty. Will be back, but next time I may skip the chips and just get fish and coleslaw."},{"name":"Model Caf√©","address":"7 N Beacon St","city":"Allston","stars":"3.5","text":"Too sceney, between the punks and the hipsters; if I'm stumbling over from the Silhouette at 1:30am, I don't want to have to try this hard.

Well, it's time for girls' night at Kyma, of course!  On a Tuesday night, you'll find your typical Buckhead crowd here.  You know, the ones who probably eat at Kyma every Tuesday and sit in the same booth each week.  The atmosphere is a little stuffy, but the d√©cor is classy and timeless.  \\n\\nWe ordered the traditional spreads with pita bread ($9) to start.  They have a really fun meze menu (appetizers from $7-$12 each), so we decided to each order a couple and share.  Here's what we ordered and whether I'd take it or leave it next time:\\n\\nZucchini fritters- leave it\\nDolmades (stuffed grape leaves)- take it\\nAthenian meatballs- leave it\\nTomato salad with feta- take it\\nSpanakopitas- take it\\nShrimp Saganaki- leave it\\nLamb pie- take it\\n\\nI highly recommend the banana kantaifi for dessert.  Imagine a roasted banana rolled in shredded filo dough, next to a small flourless chocolate cake and a scoop of yogurt ice cream. Yeah, it's worth it. This would be a great spot to take someone you want to impress; the service is flawless and the menu is unique.  While our experience at Kyma was good, I don't see myself rushing back anytime soon. However, I would definitely go back for their patio and $7 Sunday meze/wine menu!"},{"name":"Casa Maria","address":"4327 S 1st St, Ste 102","city":"Austin","stars":"4","text":"The food is great and the owner is a wonderful lady.
